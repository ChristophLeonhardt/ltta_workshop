1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
joining me now to talk about all of this
plus more Republican Governor of Ohio

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,690
John Kasich governor thanks for joining
us today what is your reaction to the

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,070
firing of Steve Bannon do you think it's
a positive or negative step for the

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,460
nation well Jake it lists that's up to
the president you know when the problem

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,260
you have is when you have chaos among
your staff staff in staff out new people

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,029
here new people there it's hard to get
anything done you have to be focused you

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,159
have to build a team and it has to be a
team that can argue including argue with

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,489
the president like my staff argues with
me is the governor but at the end of the

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,360
day we all row in the same direction and
we all have the same purpose

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,850
my concern is when you have that kind of
chaotic situation in terms of staff they

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,090
need to settle it down but the president
clearly has a right to have the people

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,559
that he wants around them the way that I
believe it works best is when you get

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,730
people with different points of view you
sit down you argue out issues carefully

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,390
and at the end you all come together and
if you're not going to go along with the

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,899
leader then you have to leave and so I
don't know what all the inner workings

16
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,040
are but they've got to get some
stability among the staff and I think

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,450
that's probably what general Kelley is
trying to do with so many changes here

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,650
in the last couple weeks but the changes
have to stop and we have to have a team

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,979
you can't keep putting new people in the
lineup and think you're going to win a

20
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,570
World Championship you called the
president's response to the violence in

21
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,770
charlottesville quote pathetic MIT
Romney says that he thinks President

22
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,340
Trump needs to actually apologize to the
nation acknowledged he was wrong in

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,100
order to avoid quote an unraveling of
our national fabric do you agree do you

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,490
think President Trump needs to apologize
I think I think Jake in some ways we're

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,899
looking backwards okay where I want to
look now is what are we going to do to

26
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,860
deal with the fundamental issues that we
have in the country the issue of race

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,960
the issue of police and community coming
together in developing policing methods

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,180
that can unify we've done it in Ohio the
need to reform a welfare system so

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,210
instead of just having people do make
work and a lot of people don't know this

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,199
if you're on welfare you get cash
assistance right now you have to work 30

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,620
hours a week people don't know that if
you don't work we take

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,720
awful welfare the point is is that
effort that those those that time you

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,650
have to be you have to put in to be
responsible needs to be meaningful we

34
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,739
got to get people to job training so
they're not stuck in poverty for

35
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,670
generations we need to think about what
we can do to make sure minorities have a

36
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,140
piece of the pie what we have to do in
our country to make sure that we begin

37
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,220
to discuss the difference between the
wealthiest and the poorest in our

38
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,930
country all these things if we can have
a dialogue on that that is what's going

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,620
to bring people together and people who
have very different points of view if

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,940
they have good will it's amazing how
many we can agree upon governor I think

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,379
one of the issues is that there are a
lot of people in the middle on the last

42
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,730
even on the right who are very troubled
because they believe president Trump has

43
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,060
difficulty condemning white supremacists
why do you think he does seem to have

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,319
this issue do you think he's concerned
about alienating bigots because they

45
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,489
might be a part of his base well look I
didn't see all of his reaction yesterday

46
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,139
to the rally in Boston which was very
uplifting the police were fantastic in

47
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,220
the way they handled it there were so
many protesters saying we reject hate

48
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,359
and my understanding is the president
came out and praised people praised the

49
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,590
police praised the fact that the
radicals were were really marginalized

50
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,109
and that those who marched for against
hate he praised so look I think it's all

51
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,250
Jake about people getting to him and
explaining to him we've got to bring the

52
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,180
country together and you know blaming
one side or another when we're talking

53
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,199
about the KKK or white supremacy there's
there's there is no comparison between

54
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,569
these hate groups and everybody else so
I feel positive about what he had to say

55
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,010
about Boston from what I understand in
the news reports President Trump is

56
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,989
scheduled to hold a campaign style rally
in Phoenix Arizona Tuesday the

57
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,590
Democratic mayor of Phoenix Phoenix has
expressed concern he says he hopes

58
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,910
president Trump postpones it in light of
all the recent events Glen thrush of the

59
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,810
New York Times tweeted quote lots of
nervousness in White House and in

60
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,370
Trump's broader circle about this trip
to Arizona do you have any concerns

61
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,090
about President Trump holding this rally
in twos

62
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,840
in Arizona Jake let me say just a couple
things look the president is our

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,120
president we want him to be successful
people around him have to get to him

64
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,949
including his own family to say okay you
need to show leadership you need to

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,910
bring the country together you're going
to go to Phoenix and make a speech fine

66
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,900
that's your right you can go there he's
got free speech just like the rest of us

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,729
have it but when you go try to use that
as an opportunity to say something

68
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,240
that's going to bring people together
you might recall when he delivered that

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,590
speech to the Congress the day after the
people on CNN said well tonight the

70
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,290
Donald Trump became president he has it
within him if he can maintain discipline

71
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,840
he hasn't within him I think to overcome
this and move forward because if all

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,440
we're doing is is questioning his
motives and what is what's in his heart

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,919
and the right and the left all we're
doing is fighting and yelling back and

74
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,320
forth Jake you are you're all asking the
question how does the country make it

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,030
with all this fighting this is
ridiculous at this point everybody in

76
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,680
America needs to take a deep breath and
think about your children and think

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,990
about our country we don't do well when
all we do is fight so let's all take a

78
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,060
deep breath and let's think about what
we can do to heal some of the basic

79
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,740
issues in this country which are still
out there that's why I'm going to go for

80
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,060
example to Appalachia a lot of people
poor they're not they're not minorities

81
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,919
they're look like you and me Jake the
fact is we got to get to the nub of why

82
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,940
people think they don't have opportunity
and we need to fix that because America

83
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,380
is the land of opportunity I'm sorry to
go on and on here but I just feel

84
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,020
strongly now that we got to just stop it
stop it now and figure out how to find

85
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,800
things that we can agree upon governor
according to a report this week sources

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,240
close to you are saying there's a
growing sense of quote moral imperative

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,620
for president Trump to face a primary
challenge in 2020 now I know you're not

88
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,700
going to announce any plans on my show
and you've made no plans but if

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,409
everything continues as it has been does
a Republican need to step forward to

90
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:42,620
challenge President Trump in three years
well Jake as you said I don't have any

91
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,180
plans to do anything like that I'm
rooting for him to get it together we

92
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,909
all are they were like seven months into
this presidency and you know look what

93
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:57,020
we have to start thinking about all of
us not just the president but down where

94
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,680
we live in the neighborhoods in the
communities we got to build a stronger

95
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,759
America look why am I on this show you
asked me to come on I'm trying to have a

96
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,539
responsible voice to call things out
when they need to be called out but also

97
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,259
to support my country so what I hope is
going to happen is I think we're going

98
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,379
to I hope we're going to have stability
the president is going to learn from

99
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:18,770
these episodes and we're going to do
better that's what I hope is going to

100
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,939
happen we'll have to wait and see
minutes ago defense secretary Madison

101
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,539
ounce that President Trump has made a
decision about what to do next in

102
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:29,900
Afghanistan though though we haven't
heard what the decision is this is what

103
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,050
you had to say about troop levels in
Afghanistan last year take a listen

104
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,249
I've now believed we need to get out of
Afghanistan hi were President I wouldn't

105
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:44,479
be announced in the timeline but I would
give the aircraft that the the Afghans

106
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,830
need and I'd get out of there there an
estimated eighty four hundred US troops

107
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,490
in Afghanistan do you think President
Trump should be planning a complete

108
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,669
withdrawal of US troops well I wouldn't
be in favor of him trying to add troops

109
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,560
here's the thing we've been there
sixteen years we went there primarily to

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,879
make sure that Afghanistan was not going
to be a launching pad into the United

111
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,659
States with terrorism we largely have
accomplished that but somehow we've

112
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,960
gotten ourselves involved in
nation-building trying to build a strong

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,449
central government in a country where
central governments don't work it's done

114
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,580
in a regional way my view would be no I
think we need to begin to leave there

115
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,680
and I think we can reserve the
opportunity to use intelligence to be

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,458
able to strike any of these training
camps any of these places where our

117
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,869
intelligence community begins to think
that they're now building a base in a

118
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,549
launching pad that would be harmful to
us and to our allies so continuing to

119
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,540
put more troops in is not the way I
think we should go I think we should

120
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,620
begin to leave and then I think we
should reserve the opportunity and the

121
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,790
right with the proper
basing of our forces in the region to be

122
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,080
able to strike if we think that there is
an effort being made to create another

123
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,010
launching pad but to just stay there
after 16 years I want our people to be

124
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,930
able to come home North Korea s I didn't
change my mind from a year ago Jethro

125
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,070
it's not nothing not a not a good gotcha
you stand by what you said North Korea

126
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,080
of course is three off threat in the
u.s. and South Korea ahead of tomorrow's

127
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,980
planned military drills between the u.s.
and South Korea North Korea calling them

128
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,330
reckless behavior driving the situation
into the uncontrollable phase of a

129
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,300
nuclear war these exercise of course
come after these weeks of growing

130
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,500
tensions in the region with North Korea
focusing on American targets such as

131
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,540
Guam and possibly Hawaii do you think
that the US should consider postponing

132
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,840
these drills not at this point I think
if they were like two weeks in the

133
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,040
future perhaps we could consider it but
when both general mattis and Tillerson

134
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,510
Tillerson the negotiators negotiated all
over the world have a sense that we have

135
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,800
to keep the pressure on I agree with
that I do I will give credit to

136
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,640
administration that has talked about how
important it is to protect the

137
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,970
continental United States and that we're
going to have every option on the table

138
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,720
and I think it's gotten the attention of
the Chinese a lot of people poopoo the

139
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,170
Chinese are not going to do anything let
me just tell you Jake if I were the

140
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,850
president I today's and we had a regime
like North Korea and they were able to

141
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,630
develop the technology to target the
United States of America we would have

142
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,910
no choice but to take those systems out
no choice and it would change the very

143
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,100
the very fabric of that peninsula and so
if the Chinese are worried about what's

144
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,240
going to happen in North Korea the best
way to get to have things happen that

145
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,260
they don't like is this just to sit back
and do nothing I think they're beginning

146
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,230
to put the heat on on that dictator over
there so at this point I think we've

147
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,760
continued with the exercises but we look
for a way to get some sort of a freeze

148
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,100
on that program of era by a viable
freeze and begin to think about how over

149
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,960
time we could have a more stable group
of people who run North Korea but you

150
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,270
you would not only not rule out but you
would enact a preemptive strike if North

151
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,940
Korea were proven to be
establishing and developing nuclear

152
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,610
capable ICBMs that could hit Unitas EU
yeah well I put it to you this way Jake

153
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,040
I wouldn't take a chance on a government
that unstable and a leader who's that

154
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,149
erratic to be able to have the
capability to launch and to land a

155
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,920
missile in Los Angeles and kill people
there yes I would reserve that right and

156
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,600
I would make it clear to the Chinese I
would send an envoy to see the Chinese

157
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,889
now and say there is a red line we are
not going to sit back and have our

158
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,970
people targeted by this regime and you
can do something about it and if you

159
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,930
don't do something about it you're going
to have to live with the results yes we

160
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,279
have to protect Americans before we
worry about anything else out here so

161
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,089
that so what can happen is the Koreans
can stop all their crazy testing and

162
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,230
then we can get to a point where we can
begin to talk about denuclearizing the

163
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,250
whole Peninsula there's a lot of things
we can talk about but it needs to be

164
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,970
made very clear to the Chinese this is
in your hands and you don't want to do

165
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,240
anything you're going to have to live
with the result because we are not going

166
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,300
to risk the lives of our people I do
want to ask you about health care the

167
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,149
Republican effort obviously to repeal
and replace Obamacare collapsed in the

168
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:21,220
Senate President Trump has threatened to
stop the subsidy payments to Obamacare

169
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,510
that help insurance companies pay family
a faster he made the August payment oh

170
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,350
that would be a disaster you think that
he should are you playing Linda sledge

171
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,319
played now he's got to continue to fund
it no you cannot just cut this off and

172
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:40,690
create more chaos look john hickenlooper
the governor of Colorado Democrat and I

173
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,310
are working together on a plan that can
stabilize those markets which we'd be

174
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,730
glad to present the people in the Senate
I'm hoping we're going to get an

175
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,510
agreement on it we're getting closer and
closer you've got to do this in a

176
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,920
bipartisan way and the thing you have to
do is stabilize those insurance markets

177
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,579
and if you want to you know take away
payments you're going to create chaos we

178
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,420
can't have that let's stabilize those
markets first let's not worry about

179
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,980
Medicaid at this point let's get to
Medicaid Social Security and Medicare in

180
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,300
terms of a package to deal with the
rising debt we have in this country and

181
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,779
do that in a responsible way there's
ways to get this stuff done

182
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,499
Jake believe me I've been there I saw us
reform well

183
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:25,239
I saw us balance the budget I saw us
reform the Pentagon we can do it if

184
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:29,619
people will just get off their political
soap boxes and begin to think about the

185
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:34,329
country because I got a message we all
get old and we all leave this planet so

186
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:37,809
we're going to be judged in many ways by
what we did when we were here stop

187
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:42,969
playing games it just doesn't make any
sense do something be bigger than

188
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:46,539
yourself live a life bigger than
yourself that's what we need to go in

189
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,979
Washington that's what we need to go
across the board in all of the United

190
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:54,759
States with business and sports and
religion across the board let's get our

191
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,489
act together and think bigger than
ourselves

192
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:00,549

Governor John Kasich we always

193
00:14:00,549 --> 00:00:00,000
