progress has seemed painfully slow at times but piece by piece the joint investigation team led by the Netherlands is building its case into the deaths of 298 innocent airline passengers and crew over eastern Ukraine four years ago and the JI t's case points increasingly at Russia today the joint task force has concluded that the missile used to shoot down MH 17 originated from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Russian Armed Forces the International JIT backed the latest allegations with plenty of information they showed photos and videos alleging the particular missile launcher was driven into Ukraine from the fifty-third brigades base near Kursk in southwestern Russia they displayed parts of the missile with a production code indicating it was made in Moscow in 1986 and they suggested they had other data presumably classified intelligence as yet there are no named suspects and no accusation that it was Russian military personnel who shot down MH 17 rather than the separatists Russia has always denied supporting and supplying during the war in eastern Ukraine but the JIT feels it's narrowing in on those responsible and a prosecution in a Dutch Court but the chances of Russians facing justice in a foreign courtroom are vanishingly small Russia doesn't extradite its civilians let alone military personnel involved in a clandestine war in a neighboring country and Russia has put forward an often contradictory collection of counter narratives for why it couldn't possibly have had any role in the needless deaths of nearly 300 people although new for the JIT z' case the substance of their allegations was actually already in the public domain and has been for some time it was a report two years ago by open source investigators Belling cats that first pointed to russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade as the origin of the buk missile system and belen cats say they have another big MA 17 development to reveal on Friday Rory talents out his era sin Petersburg Russia
