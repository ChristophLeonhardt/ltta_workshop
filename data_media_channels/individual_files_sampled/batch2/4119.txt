we're really doing well with North Korea we're really doing we're doing real well remember they said oh it's gonna be terrible they were actually saying three months ago when the rhetoric rhetoric was rather shot do we agree I won't use the rhetoric down now I'm trying to calm it down a little bit weeks of day talk between North Korea and the u.s. hit a snag Sunday when North Korea accused the Trump administration of quote misleading public opinion by claiming that sanctions in tough talk brought the Kim regime to the table and warned that the u.s. is insistent that sanctions will not be lifted until the nor until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons amount to provocation joining me now is sue me Terry former National Security Council analyst on North Korea okay sue me slits I want to just go back and establish one question Donald Trump wants to take full credit for the daytime you're seeing between North and South Korea including the Olympics and everything else to say it's all him you know critics of Donald Trump for saying no it's he needs the credit needs to go to moon jae-in the president of South Korea which is it or along what part of the continuum is that true all over so they're all partly true so it is true that president Trump's pressure particularly sanctions and pressing the Chinese did help and probably even his talk kind of limited I kind of rattled the knuth Koreans like the madman right exactly but president when Jane also did his part obviously you know giving that overture about the Olympics and inviting the North Koreans coming so he was he deserve some credit for that too yeah and of course the North Koreans himself they think they've completed their program if you're a nuclear front right the new year's editorial dress he says I'm done with my program so he thinks that hey I've already shown intercontinental ballistic missile capability that which United States yeah I'm there so I'm going to enter the negotiation for a position of strength so I think it's all part of it it's not that one person should take all of the credit and what do you think Kim jong-un wants he clearly does what a free country right that the world is sort of open tube but he obviously wants to be sort of normalized well he wants to yeah of course was to appear to be a normal leader of a normal country a modern leader I think he wants some respect from the international community he also wants sort of recognition that it is a nuclear power and then it's going to not try to negotiate but about disarmament or arms control not completely new creation of North Korea I think we have a long way to go together you don't see North Korea ever giving up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for normalization what you know complete verifiable irreversible way I think that's gonna be very tough yeah I think to get but they might act they might sign a deal I believe absolutely that Trump Kim summit would produce an agreement yeah the problem is going to be implementation and verification not only the Dacian verification but there's a lot of concern that he will have the upper hand because he will do the homework and know trump better than Trump goes in knowing him oh absolutely he knows President Trump 100% of their North Koreans energy is focused on us right yes and look how many are you guys were talking about your honor we have million half issues were so distracted yeah domestic issues and foreign policy issues Kim jong-un it's all about United States they're doing their homework yeah and then on the Iran deal if you know there's a week coming where Donald Trump could pull out of that deal then if North Korea is watching us get out of a deal that was duly implemented and negotiated by the world then how does that affect their desire to reach a deal with us it's absolutely true that North Koreans have hard time trusting you know if they have done this before where those in 1994 agreed framework on the Clinton years and they thought that since the Bush administration came in from North Korean perspective that's what's called a deal so now if we scrub the Iran deal right North Koreans gonna be like okay how do we trust the United States ever again that said probably from the Trump administration's perspective they think scrapping the Iran deal toughen their position or they have more of a negotiating leverage with the North Koreans because they are telling the North Koreans whatever deal we're gonna have with you have to be tougher right much tougher and let's talk really quickly about this issue of hostages you have you have three Americans two who were taken hostage in 2017 one who's been there since 2015 how does these men's plight play into these negotiations well I think because Kim jong-un wants to make sure that his meeting goes well with Trump they are prepared to release these Americans because they know that this is what we want so it's sort of a you know it's a gesture of administration so I think they will be released and I think there would be an okay condition because if they were in an automobiles condition or in a very bad condition yeah they know it's gonna go sour you know you could there be no point now to the back letting us see sue me Terry just the person I was when I talked about that you're so smart on these issues thank you so much for
