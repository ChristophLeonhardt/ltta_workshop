WHO MIGHT SPEAK OUT AGAINST HIM. THE PRESIDENT’S LAWYER RUDY

68
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:43,237
THE PRESIDENT’S LAWYER RUDY GIULIANI IS VERY CLEAR THAT HE

69
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,605
GIULIANI IS VERY CLEAR THAT HE FEELS HE IS WAGING A PUBLIC

70
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,340
FEELS HE IS WAGING A PUBLIC RELATIONS WAR, THAT THIS IS NOT

71
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,709
RELATIONS WAR, THAT THIS IS NOT A CLOSED-DOOR INVESTIGATION,

72
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,044
A CLOSED-DOOR INVESTIGATION, THIS IS A PUBLIC INVESTIGATION.

73
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,546
THIS IS A PUBLIC INVESTIGATION. AND SO THEY SEE THIS AS BEING

74
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:55,082
AND SO THEY SEE THIS AS BEING THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT

75
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,051
THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT IMPEACHMENT REALLY, THAT IF THE

76
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:58,185
IMPEACHMENT REALLY, THAT IF THE DEMOCRATS CAN TAKE CONTROL OF

DEMOCRATS CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE THE PRESIDENT’S ALLIES

78
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,355
THE HOUSE THE PRESIDENT’S ALLIES FEEL THAT IMPEACHMENT IS

79
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:03,657
FEEL THAT IMPEACHMENT IS INEVITABLE AND THE ONLY WAY TO

80
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,960
INEVITABLE AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THAT IS TO UNLEASH THESE

81
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:07,461
STOP THAT IS TO UNLEASH THESE CONTINUAL PUBLIC RELATIONS

82
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,430
CONTINUAL PUBLIC RELATIONS ATTACK AGAINST THIS ENTIRE

83
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:09,864
ATTACK AGAINST THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.

84
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:12,366
INVESTIGATION. >> RIGHT.

85
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:13,868
>> RIGHT. SO PAUL, DESCRIBING A POLITICAL

86
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:15,837
SO PAUL, DESCRIBING A POLITICAL STRATEGY THERE BASICALLY SAYING

87
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,672
STRATEGY THERE BASICALLY SAYING ANYTHING WE ARE HIT WITH HERE

88
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:18,673
ANYTHING WE ARE HIT WITH HERE LEGALLY ULTIMATELY IMPEACHMENT’S

89
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:19,607
LEGALLY ULTIMATELY IMPEACHMENT’S A POLITICAL QUESTION, IF YOU CAN

90
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:20,441
A POLITICAL QUESTION, IF YOU CAN KEEP REPUBLICANS IN LINE IN THE

91
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,943
KEEP REPUBLICANS IN LINE IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, EVEN IF

92
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:22,877
HOUSE AND THE SENATE, EVEN IF DEMOCRATS WIN BACK THE MAJORITY

93
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:23,845
DEMOCRATS WIN BACK THE MAJORITY THIS NOVEMBER, PROBABLY WOULDN’T

94
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,279
THIS NOVEMBER, PROBABLY WOULDN’T HAVE A 2/3 MAJORITY TO GET RID

95
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:25,946
HAVE A 2/3 MAJORITY TO GET RID OF HIM.

96
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,281
OF HIM. SO IF THAT’S THE BOTTOM LINE

97
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:28,716
SO IF THAT’S THE BOTTOM LINE THERE, I’M CURIOUS, FROM A

98
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:30,251
THERE, I’M CURIOUS, FROM A PROSECUTOR’S STANDPOINT, IF

99
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:31,352
PROSECUTOR’S STANDPOINT, IF YOU’RE INVESTIGATING SOMEBODY

100
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,688
YOU’RE INVESTIGATING SOMEBODY WHO IS EMPLOYING A VERY HIGHLY

101
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,090
WHO IS EMPLOYING A VERY HIGHLY PUBLIC POLITICAL STRATEGY, DOES

102
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:36,758
PUBLIC POLITICAL STRATEGY, DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR WORK AS A

103
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:37,559
THAT AFFECT YOUR WORK AS A PROSECUTOR, AS AN INVESTIGATOR

104
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:38,159
PROSECUTOR, AS AN INVESTIGATOR AT ALL?

105
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:39,460
AT ALL? >> NORMALLY IT WOULDN’T BECAUSE

106
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:42,397
>> NORMALLY IT WOULDN’T BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PEOPLE

107
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,199
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD DECIDE THE FATE OF

108
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,301
WHO WOULD DECIDE THE FATE OF THAT POLITICIAN WOULD BE A JURY

109
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:48,370
THAT POLITICIAN WOULD BE A JURY OF HIS OR HER PEERS.

110
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:49,771
OF HIS OR HER PEERS. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

111
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,172
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO

112
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,107
STATES IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO THAT DOESN’T APPLY TO BECAUSE

113
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:54,875
THAT DOESN’T APPLY TO BECAUSE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL

114
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:55,710
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL FOLLOW ITS GUIDELINES.

115
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:57,312
FOLLOW ITS GUIDELINES. NOT WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION.

116
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:58,513
NOT WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION. AN INTERPRETATION THAT A SITTING

117
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,281
AN INTERPRETATION THAT A SITTING PRESIDENT CAN’T BE INDICTED.

118
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:02,617
PRESIDENT CAN’T BE INDICTED. SO IN THAT SENSE THE STRATEGY IS

119
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:02,951
SO IN THAT SENSE THE STRATEGY IS CORRECT.

120
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:03,785
CORRECT. IT SHOULD BE A POLITICAL

121
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,353
IT SHOULD BE A POLITICAL STRATEGY RATHER THAN A CRIMINAL

122
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:05,787
STRATEGY RATHER THAN A CRIMINAL STRATEGY.

123
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,022
STRATEGY. THAT’S GOOD NEWS MAYBE FOR

124
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:07,789
THAT’S GOOD NEWS MAYBE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

125
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,425
PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT IT’S BAD NEWS FOR THE RULE

126
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,192
BUT IT’S BAD NEWS FOR THE RULE OF LAW.

127
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,595
OF LAW. THE PRESIDENT’S VIEW IS THAT

128
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,797
THE PRESIDENT’S VIEW IS THAT THE -- HE DIRECTS, HE OWNS AS IT

129
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:18,300
THE -- HE DIRECTS, HE OWNS AS IT IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE

130
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,869
IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.

131
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:21,636
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI. HE THINKS THEY OWE HIM A PLEDGE

132
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:22,036
HE THINKS THEY OWE HIM A PLEDGE OF LOYALTY.

133
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:24,506
OF LOYALTY. HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

134
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,240
HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIRECT POLITICAL PROSECUTIONS

135
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,341
DIRECT POLITICAL PROSECUTIONS AGAINST HIS PERCEIVED ENEMIES

136
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,609
AGAINST HIS PERCEIVED ENEMIES LIKE JAMES COMEY AND HILLARY

137
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:27,943
LIKE JAMES COMEY AND HILLARY CLINTON.

138
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,611
CLINTON. HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

139
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:30,946
HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOLE OUT PARDONS AS POLITICAL

140
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,280
DOLE OUT PARDONS AS POLITICAL FAVORS.

141
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:32,514
FAVORS. THAT’S NOT THE KIND OF AMERICA

142
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:35,150
THAT’S NOT THE KIND OF AMERICA OR THE KIND OF LEADER THAT THE

143
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:35,984
OR THE KIND OF LEADER THAT THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION
