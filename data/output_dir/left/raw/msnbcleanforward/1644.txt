THEY’RE NOT WALKING ON OUR STREETS.

213
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,657
STREETS. THEY’RE NOT DEALING WITH THE

THEY’RE NOT DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE

PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE HAVE WITH ADDICTION.

HAVE WITH ADDICTION. THEIR KIDS DON’T GO TO OUR

217
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:08,261
THEIR KIDS DON’T GO TO OUR SCHOOLS.

218
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,497
