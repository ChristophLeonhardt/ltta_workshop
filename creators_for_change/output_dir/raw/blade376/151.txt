1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
right I haven't done a video like this

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,810
in quite a while I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> chill some</font>

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,550
evenings when i get a chance with a a

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:19,830
nice glass of red wine script I've got

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,840
this really nice l-shaped couch behind

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,369
me but I decided to sit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the floor I</font>

7
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,369
didn't feel free to get a drink if you

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to join me I thought I just chill</font>

9
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:43,920
that silence is just amazing I haven't

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:55,710
actually felt that in years really sang

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,539
as stupid as that was getting me feeling

12
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,430
emotional and I haven't drunk anything

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,869
yeah I can assure you I tweeted earlier

14
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,650
this evening how I feel I'm in the eye

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,659
of the storm and therefore like then I

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,360
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy the peace and quiet and you</font>

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,920
know I can close my eyes if I wanted to

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,990
it just look a bit weird on camera right

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and I can breathe the last two years</font>

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:43,229
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-stop really has been and I'm</font>

21
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,790
done a video like this in such a long

22
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,149
time in this it's nice so I'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

23
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,579
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my trademark of making really</font>

24
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,829
long videos but buying out in the day if

25
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,880
you're watching this because you care

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,340
and the people that care are the people

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,190
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share some time with that's</font>

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,980
I didn't wait to start ready

29
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,610
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding this very overwhelming</font>

30
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,470
right now just thinking I just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

31
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,120
haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say to people</font>

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,970
have had some off time you know gaming

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,740
on the computer which i haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,110
ages but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> off its not off time</font>

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing something else assuming</font>

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to make you relaxing</font>

37
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,170
it doesn't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't sleep much I have the</font>

38
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,530
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue where let me let me explain</font>

39
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,290
this my iphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've never managed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

40
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,980
grasp the concept of multitasking and

41
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,690
and how you know if you completely

42
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,280
switch an application off and there was

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">one time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where I went to work I had it</font>

44
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,550
fully charged overnight my<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone and an</font>

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,040
hour later I felt red hot when I took

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
out my<font color="#E5E5E5"> pocket and it was literally five</font>

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,709
percent battery left and it was because

48
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,560
obviously it was processing so much so

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,310
it shut down and I feel and there's not

50
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,720
many occasions where you would compare

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,030
yourself to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> order for him I feel that</font>

52
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what my heart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and what my mind is</font>

53
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,810
doing constantly the last three weeks

54
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've fallen ill twice and I just shut</font>

55
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,090
them and then when I'm ill I'm not

56
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,549
productive i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling great get</font>

57
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">better crack straight on and</font>

58
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,640
it's just been a very surreal year

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,129
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm wondering what am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i doing</font>

60
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">with my life a lot of amazing things</font>

61
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:12,159
have happened a lot of really terrible

62
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,969
things have happened things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love</font>

63
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:19,209
to share with you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason I can't</font>

64
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,210
is because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my golden rules</font>

65
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,639
with being open on the internet and that

66
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,580
is if it involves other people on a

67
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:35,680
personal level then it's not my right to

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,979
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it the irony with one of the</font>

69
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,380
stories that happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a year ago</font>

70
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,690
was the person I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

71
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,759
write an article about me online yeah

72
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,639
which caused people to then ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what</font>

73
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,830
was going on and then they got angry

74
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,169
that I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him about the</font>

75
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,919
issue which you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it</font>

76
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,139
goes but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to take legal action</font>

77
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,330
please get involved my death threats

78
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,340
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> December up to about a month ago</font>

79
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,270
every day I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> log on be shaking inside</font>

80
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,199
sometimes my hands would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be shaking</font>

81
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,099
because it was what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to deal with</font>

82
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">and something I said on a video before I</font>

83
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,979
went to VidCon was people<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say</font>

84
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:31,380
miles way so positive and why so happy

85
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:39,820
and it's not the same thing why would it

86
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,080
the case what it is is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just better</font>

87
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,800
with dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things</font>

88
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,000
after what happened with my ex which he

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
can see on videos on my channel it

90
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,750
destroyed me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was on the edge</font>

91
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,880
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> and utterly in self-destruct</font>

92
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,300
mode evidence of my videos I'm not

93
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,669
ashamed of it I mean I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather have not</font>

94
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,050
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that state but it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just me</font>

95
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:18,130
showing who I was I am moved for it and

96
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,849
it I didn't deal with it good but what

97
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,940
happened this year I dealt with it good

98
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">in him in the persona but inside just</font>

99
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,080
completely ruined and and it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,460
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphone analogy that my heart is</font>

101
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,349
constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> being faster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it always</font>

102
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:49,599
happened since my ex because if I ever

103
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,340
have friends over and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> staying in</font>

104
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,490
the same room even if sleeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

105
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,930
corner<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the opposite side they say</font>

106
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,210
they can hear me grinding my teeth or

107
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking in my sleep if I've ever shared</font>

108
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,930
a bed with someone they can feel my

109
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,490
heartbeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> vibrating the bed really fast</font>

110
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,289
or from hugging someone and I just

111
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:23,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonder what do I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do am i living</font>

112
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,560
too much am I trying to do too much

113
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,000
always got projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my mind and</font>

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,770
although I haven't made youtube videos

115
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,110
as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i used to when i started</font>

116
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,110
youtube I made them every couple of days

117
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,280
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I'm not doing stuff and</font>

118
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,599
I've had people complain to me recently

119
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,030
about not getting involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

120
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,190
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> being arrogant about it just</font>

121
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i'm not making videos or</font>

122
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,699
publicly declaring my efforts doesn't

123
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,460
mean I'm not doing it and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

124
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,960
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are forget forget sometimes</font>

125
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,030
is online community isn't all about

126
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube you know people that go to</font>

127
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,950
youtube gatherings are

128
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,080
youtube community there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are segments of</font>

129
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,360
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're an active part of community</font>

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,790
but there's other ways have been active

131
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,880
as well as you know conventions for

132
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,410
collector items for example there's

133
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,350
conferences various<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you know as</font>

134
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,550
many ways in which as community and why

135
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,850
stand for is using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology for</font>

136
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,910
good and you know I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube's</font>

137
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,840
a part of it but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about finding</font>

138
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,820
different means and I've been fortunate

139
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,669
enough very recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be offered some</font>

140
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,640
jobs which are really great and I'm

141
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,729
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited to put them into practice</font>

142
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,360
and hopefully benefit areas of the world

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,580
my psychology theory I've wanted to do

144
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,670
the past two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm very</font>

145
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,730
proud of with the fact I've disproven

146
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,980
what a lot of people used to criticize

147
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,230
me for years ago which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only worried</font>

148
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,850
about being featured because the truth

149
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,740
with my psychology theory was I had a

150
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">video made which YouTube were going to</font>

151
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,480
globally feature and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no because</font>

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,630
it wasn't ready it wasn't going to do

153
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,150
the job as well as I'd one city and it's

154
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,430
why I haven't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into practice yet</font>

155
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,090
I'm seeing companies as we speak but

156
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,190

161
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,410
any of you don't know I'm since we

162
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,310
believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the BBC is hearts fine job</font>

163
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,280
and constructions becoming our workforce

164

<font color="#CCCCCC">gray the people i work with a great but</font>

165
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,800
you want me to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into perspective I</font>

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,570
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> spending five weeks shoveling</font>

167
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,900
rubble into a skip tens and tens of tons

168
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,910
of rubble you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really working hard</font>

169
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,160
it's not intellectually stimulating I'll

170
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,960
just be completely bored in my head the

171
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,550
whole day and then when i get<font color="#CCCCCC"> home when</font>

172
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm wanting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the stuff intellectually</font>

173
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,110
stimulating like do videos i'm

174
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,410
completely shattered if i'm doing that

175
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">in five weeks and then when i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

176
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,420
working 20 hours a day cuz i was

177
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,450
organizing stick aid which by the way

178
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,140
I'm wearing the shirt off her yes I cool

179
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,160
um stick aid I never did a follow up

180
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
video but UNICEF told me it helped over

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,700
a hundred thousand people over 600

182
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,210
families 1.5 million people tuned in

183
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,090
that was done in five weeks it's a

184
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,660
shoveling rubble or helping a hundred

185
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,000
thousand people it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,050
completely ridiculous concept to me like

187
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,490
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I'm dealing with at</font>

188
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,810
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess it's the</font>

192
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,780
it depends if you believe in destiny and

<font color="#E5E5E5">I I've always debt by I've always had a</font>

195
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,750
having to keep myself grounded I really

196
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,210
feel that I've got something just round

197
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,830
the corner where I'm going to be able to

198
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,350
help the masses which I've done in some

199
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,940
ways but I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that I could do</font>

200
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:49,800
more and no offense you know

202
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just feel like you know I could hold up</font>

203
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,460
a shovel and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone who</font>

204
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,600
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more people that can shovel</font>

205
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,250
out there than people that can do what

206
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,910
I've done it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nature of</font>

207
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,220
demographics that you know it's not

208
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,230
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> around as much as construction has</font>

209
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,270
you know and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just feel like I just</font>

210
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,160
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold out this shovel and go so</font>

211
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and take it off you can do that well let</font>

212
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,300
me go and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help the masses</font>

213
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,110
because that's what

214
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,140
to do in life and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been frustrated I</font>

215
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,300
went for a job at Thorpe Park recently

216
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,269
and I didn't get it I thought I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

217
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,660
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it because it was to be an</font>

entertainer<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the pig creature from the</font>

219
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,550
movie saw they have a roller coaster

220
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,560
there about the solar movie I did the

221
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,720
voiceover for the the second movies

222
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,740
online campaign I've had good experience

223
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,050
in customer service I am very<font color="#CCCCCC"> dedicated</font>

224
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,100
and it was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part-time thing I</font>

225
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,079
didn't get it and I find up and I asked

226
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,279
feedback and they didn't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the</font>

227
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,790
feedback I wanted because it didn't make

228
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:00,070
sense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a blog post about it and</font>

229
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,779
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot people said it was</font>

230
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,970
childish of me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> showed frustration or</font>

231
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,920
jealousy and even the guy who

232
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,399
interviewed me wrote on it all though he

233
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,899
won't admit it was him I know it was him

234
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me arrogant and it just</font>

235
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,850
made me think in life with anything I've

236
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,950
done I've always struggled to stay

237
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,810
passionate and not come across as

238
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,850
arrogant but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you differentiate</font>

239
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,680
the two surely passion on a scale goes

240
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,420
from no passion some more and more

241
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,220
passion until it's to a point that

242
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,740
you're so convinced it's right that it's

243
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,350
arrogance I'm always open to being

244
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,390
proven wrong being wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a bad</font>

245
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,430
thing I understand I wasn't right for

246
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> job why was frustrated about was I</font>

247
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,120
wasn't given the feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause needed</font>

248
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,070
and you know to be called arrogant

249
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,720
because I I went in with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attitude</font>

250
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the job I don't</font>

251
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,480
understand why that was a bad thing I

252
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,040
don't understand why that was a bad

253
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,980
thing and I was supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a TV</font>

I disagree with them but everyone has

294
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,170
the right for their say but I just go

295
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,150
based on experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think the</font>

glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've stayed true to who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

310
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:36,600
and over the years I have just preached

311
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,340
about how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet can change the</font>

312
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">world for the better and how any</font>

313
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,360
one can do well and the whole notion of

314
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,089

315
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,370

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,350
internet is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done so</font>

317
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,689
much for me and my videos have<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

318
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,850
shown how I've progressed as a person

319
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,480
and I hope that that's true inspiration

320
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,009
because my journey has been incredible

321
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,270

the reality is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to switch off</font>

339
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,700
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sign up in going over my head</font>

340
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,080
the past couple years is there's a lot

341
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,390
of stuff i hate about myself it

342
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,030
frustrates me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have flaws which</font>

343
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,550
sounds ridiculous but i did i did a

344
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,960
video when i started youtube which i

345
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,150
might remake one day which was admit to

346
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,930
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not perfect this mother</font>

347
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,470
I'd want to be perfect I just have flaws

348
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:53,520
about me which I hate things I wish were

349
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,190
better about myself to be honest I

350
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't put my finger any of them right</font>

351
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,450
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just more of a feeling tonight</font>

352
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,550
I mean you're in a certain situation you

353
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,290
were like why did I do that I think it's

354
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,300
also when I'm around people who I wanted

355
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk for the RL and I lifeboat</font>

356
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,550
organization I was asked to do a massive

357
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,490
talk at the end about the for today and

358
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,580
you know people clap to what i said i

359
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,880
did this massive talk trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inspire</font>

360
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,350
but meister time i just wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

361
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,480
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people just wish I'd show</font>

362
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,580
you know and it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the issue</font>

363
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:45,110
of passion is my passion justified

364
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,750
or will it will pay off in the end and I

365
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,520
guess I've just got to stick with it I

366
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:56,160
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> as always I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

367
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,940
look back especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> because now at some</font>

368
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,650
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's out there on the internet</font>

369
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,750
is a timeless piece this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a snapshot</font>

370
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,070
in time but I said this a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

371
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago when I did another video like this</font>

372
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,260
which was I hope I don't look back at

373
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,970
this video in a couple years time and

374
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,700
ask myself where did I go wrong after I

375
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,640
turn this camera off why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did I make a</font>

376
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,870
different choice or series of choices

377
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,980
but I guess that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bitter sweet</font>

378
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,570
essence of life her so I'm good night

379
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,419
and I will see whenever I see have a

380
00:20:45,419 --> 00:00:00,000
good one at is to next time
