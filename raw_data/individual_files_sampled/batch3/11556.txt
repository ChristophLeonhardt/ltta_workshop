Israel wasn't being entirely truthful about what happened Oh truthful at all and the Russians have published radar snapshots to prove it the four israeli f16 jets weren't in Israeli airspace at the time of the incident says the report no one of them was just behind the Russian ill 20 baiting an S 200 missile fired at it you can clearly see their game on radar the Israeli jet maneuvered to put the Russian aircraft between it and the missile the missile then switched targets to the larger and slower moving Russian aircraft the moment it hit the f-16 turned tail and flew away all claims by Israel about its non involvement in the tragic incident that claimed the lives of 15 Russian servicemembers irregardless of what happened Israel continues to place all possible and impossible blame on Iran and its allies also promises to continue to defend its interests in Syria meaning bomb Syria will accept that will be harder to do Russia is taking action to protects its pilots Syria will now be supplied with s-300 air defense systems which will change the rules it will be much harder for Israel to mount these little bombing expeditions more the Russians will now Jam missiles and jets attacking Syria from the coast they'll also be upgrading Syria's air defense network it is reasonable in the current situation and is first and foremost aimed at preventing any potential threat to the lives of Russian servicemen it's as the Russian said circumstances have changed and latest events leave Russia no choice and leave Israel upset obviously Russia and Israel have different definitions of the word irresponsible Russia would say that hiding from a missile behind one of its aircraft is pretty high up there on the irresponsibility we're sure that the implementation of these measures will cool some hotheads and will keep them from ill-judged moves that could threaten our servicemen and it isn't just Israel that's angry now that it can't act or bomb or hide behind other planes where and when it will the United States surprisingly aren't too happy either many topics that we'll talk about with the Russians I'm very confident that the their latest decision to move the s3 owner will be amongst them we were finding lots of places where they're working against American interest and will hold them accountable we're so doing National Security Advisor John Bolton calls it a significant escalation a major mistake wants Russia to reconsider and promises to stay in Syria we're not going to live as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias never mind the irony here no other nation in the world has as many of its troops outside its borders as the US never mind also that despite all their talk about Iranian aggression Israel has attacked Syria a heck of a lot more times than Iran has attacked Israel never mind all that what is interesting is that that's a very strong reaction why would the United States be so concerned that Syria can now defend itself a little better the u.s. does sometimes release such information one could argue but it's also reluctant to do so as you point out partly because they claim you know this is classified sources and that is partly because they claim that their work should be good enough we should all take their word and you know this is a damning that we see over and over that they want world public opinion us the public opinion to accept the statements of you government officials at face value and not to demand evidence because they want to preserve the ability to have such authority such unquestioned authority in the future a Russian aircraft was set up 15 people a dead one might of course ask how Israel or the US would have reacted if their jet was set up to take the fall safe bet it would probably have involved a lot of bombs you
