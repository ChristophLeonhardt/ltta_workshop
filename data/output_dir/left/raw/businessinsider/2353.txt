00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,610
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough balance if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a Wall</font>

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,939
want to acknowledge them too much and

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,350
draw attention the fact that you're

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,510
paying yourselves massive bonuses while

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,369
ten percent of the country's out of work

major Wall Street firm tried to assess

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,530
who got it right this holiday season

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,059
start at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your list who</font>

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,730
completely blew it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Goldman completely</font>

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,070
blew it they didn't give<font color="#CCCCCC"> any decorations</font>

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,250
they gave no recognition and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a</font>

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,590
holiday season this is visible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you it</font>

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,690
was it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible inside maybe there's</font>

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,700
no I did ask and they said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,410
are no decorations I asked a security

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,329
guard and he said as of now no

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,210
decorations whatsoever so I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> him a</font>

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,710
d-minus because it's the holiday season

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,270
and we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be giving anybody</font>

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,949
enough and so do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

25
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,220
sort of a Goldman attempt to understate

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,110
things yeah the fact that the firm has

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,360
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> wildly in the press cancel</font>

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,010
Christmas and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,640
another way emphasize it yeah step up

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,880
from go yeah so next next<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst to</font>

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,950
Goldman in my opinion was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merrill Lynch</font>

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,570
they did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good job with their</font>

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">decorations but what I had an issue with</font>

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,369
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they separated but you walk in</font>

35
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,750
and you see the Christmas tree when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,030
get the lobby and then in a completely

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,729
separate location they have the Hanukkah

38
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,979
menorah and I was like some segregation

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,079
on Christmas no this is togetherness

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,180
everything should be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one location I</font>

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,500
