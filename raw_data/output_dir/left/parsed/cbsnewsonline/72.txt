PAUL RYAN AND MIKE PENCE WILL
SPEAK AT THE CEREMONY, DUE TO
LAST ABOUT AN HOUR.
AT 1:00 P.M.
EASTERN, THE PUBLIC
WILL BE INVITED TO VIEW McCAIN'S
CASKET AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY
AND EVENING.
>> WE SEE NOW THE BEGINNING OF
THIS CEREMONY TAKING PLACE ON
CAPITOL HILL.
THE CASKET, CARRYING SENATOR
JOHN McCAIN, WILL BE GREETED BY
THE ARMED FORCES BODY BEARERS.
WHEN HE IS BROUGHT INSIDE, HE
WILL BE PLACED ON THE CATAFAUCT.
30 PEOPLE BEFORE McCAIN.
THEY HAVE LIED ON THERE.
>> BUILT IN 1865.
LYNDON JOHNSON.
JOHN KENNEDY, PUTS HIM IN
EXTRAORDINARY, EXTRAORDINARY
COMPANY.
NANCY CORDES IS OUTSIDE OF THE
CAPITOL.
GOOD MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING, JOHN, THE SCENE
THAT WE'RE NOW WITNESSING HERE
ON THE EAST FRONT OF THE CAPITOL
IS REMINISCENT OF WHAT WE SAW IN
ARIZONA WHEN McCAIN'S BODY AND
HIS CASKET WAS REMOVED FROM THE
HEARSE AT THE ARIZONA STATE
CAPITOL, INGREDIENTED BY A
MILITARY HONOR GUARD AND --
GREETED BY A MILITARY HONOR
GUARD AND HIS FAMILY AND IT WILL
BE TAKEN INTO THE ROTUNDA OF THE
CAPITOL BUILDING.
HE LOVED THE U.S. SENATE.
IT WAS PART OF WHAT HEALED HIM
AFTER HIS TWO FAILED BIDS FOR
THE PRESIDENCY.
IT WAS COMING BACK TO THE SENATE
THAT HE LOVED.
HE WILL LIE IN STATE AT THE U.S.
CAPITOL TODAY.
>> THANK YOU, WE'RE ALSO JOINED
BY BOB SCHIEFFER, OUR LONG TIME
HOST OF FACE THE NATION.
MARGARET BRENNAN, NOW THE HOST
OF FACE THE NATION IS ALSO IN
WASHINGTON.
I THINK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF JOHN
McCAIN THERE IN THE UNITED
STATES SENATE.
HE NEVER WANTED TO BE KNOWN AS
MR. CONGENIALITY.
>> EXACTLY.
NANCY CORDES IS EXACTLY RIGHT
WHEN SHE SAYS HE WAS THE MAN OF
THE SENATE BUT HE WAS A
DIFFERENT KIND OF MAN.
HE WANTED ALWAYS TO DO MORE.
AS A RESULT, HE USED TO LAUGH
ABOUT THAT.
HE USED TO SAY I WILL NEVER BE
ELECTED MISS CONGENIALITY.
HE DID LOVE THAT PLACE AND HAD
EPIC BATTLES THERE, BUT HE ALSO
HAD SOME GREAT FRIENDSHIPS.
YOU KNOW, WE SAW YESTERDAY IN
ARIZONA WHEN JOE BIDEN GOT UP
AND SPOKE AT HIS FUNERAL.
THEY WERE TOUGH CUSTOMERS WHEN
THEY GOT OUT ON THE SENATE FLOOR
FIGHTING THE VARIOUS BATTLES,
BUT THEY WOULD WALK OFF THE
FLOOR AND THEY WERE FRIENDS.
THAT FRIENDSHIP REMAINED.
IT WAS A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP THAT
WE USED TO SEE SO MUCH IN THE
SENATE AND IT IS ALL TOO RARE
TODAY.
.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT
ATTENDED THE CEREMONIES.
>> THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE
ATTENDING THE TWO HAD SERVED IN
CONGRESS TOGETHER.
THEY WORKED TOGETHER ON FISCAL
ISSUES IN 2005 OR SO, BUT
REALLY, MIKE PENCE, FILLING THE
VOID THAT WILL BE NOTICEABLE
GIVEN THAT THE SITTING
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, WILL
NOT BE PARTICIPANTING, THAT IS A
DELIBERATE CHOICE.
MIKE PENCE WENT AND VISITED WITH
SOME OF AMERICA'S VETERANS, THE
AMERICAN LEGION JUST YESTERDAY,
AND INSISTED THAT THIS
ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO
REMEMBER THE LIFE TIME OF SVEN
THAT JOHN McCAIN GAVE TO -- LIFE
TIME OF SERVICE THAT JOHN McCAIN
GAVE TO THIS COUNTRY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE RESPECTS
HIS SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND
HAS OFFERS ALL SORTS OF
RESOURCES TO THE FAMILY,
INCLUDING THE MILITARY HONOR
GUARDS AND THE PLANES THAT
BROUGHT THE SENATOR'S CASKET
FROM ARIZONA TO JOINT BASE
ANDREWS JUST YESTERDAY.
>> BOB, I WANT TO GET YOUR
THOUGHTS, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE
INSTITUTION THAT JOHN McCAIN
WANTED SO MUCH TO PROTECT.
HE WAS AN INSTITUTIONALIST.
HE BELIEVED IN IT.
HE THOUGHT SOME OF THE MEMBERS
FELL SHORT, IF YOU THINK OF SOME
OF THE SENATORS WHO HAVE BEEN ON
THAT CATAPHALS I THINK HE WILL
BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE
GIANTS.
IN SOME WAYS, HE WAS THE
CONSCIOUS OF THE SENATE.
HE WANTED THEM TO ADDRESS
THINGS.
NOT MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO DO
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.
HE AND RUSS FEINGOLD, THE
DEMOCRAT FROM WASHINGTON, WERE
ABLE TO, AFTER YEARS, TO FINALLY
GET THAT LEGISLATION PASSED.
MANY THINGS DON'T LAST FOREVER.
I WAS THINKING AWHILE AGO, WE
WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS.
32 PEOPLE WENT TO PRISON.
THIS WAS EVEN BEFORE SENATOR
McCAIN AND FEINGOLD HAD PASSED
THEIR THING.
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, 32 OF THEM
WENT TO JAIL.
NOW ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THOSE
PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL FOR ARE NOW
LEGAL.
>> BOB, WE SEE NOW, CINDY
McCAIN, HIS WIFE OF 38 YEARS WHO
JOE BIDEN DESCRIBED YESTERDAY AS
JOHN McCAIN'S BALLAST.
THEY HAD 7 CHILDREN, SOME FROM
HIS FIRST WIFE, AND THAT IS HIS
SON, JACK.
YOU CAN SEE HIM THERE IN HIS
NAVAL UNIFORM.
HE IS NAMED JOHN SYDNEY McCAIN
IV.
HE IS 32 YEARS OLD, HE IS A
HELICOPTER PILOT, JUST RETURNED
FROM OVER SEAS, A DEPLOYMENT,
HIS OTHER SON THERE, TOO, A
MARINE, JIMMY, YOU CAN SEE
MEGHAN McCAIN THERE, I BELIEVE,
OFF TO THE SIDE AS WELL.
THE FAMILY WAITS TO RECEIVE THE
CASKET OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN
WHO WILL LIE IN STATE AS
MENTIONED THERE, WILL BE A
CEREMONY TODAY, AND THEN THE
PUBLIC CAN COME, STARTING AT
1:00 P.M.
EASTERN TIME TO PAY
THEIR RESPECTS WHICH I THINK IS
REALLY ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THINGS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY IS
THAT YOU CAN GO TO THE CAPITOL
AND PAY YOUR RESPECTS.
IT HAS BEEN PRESIDENTS AND
LEADERS OF THE SENATE.
THOSE LIED IN HONOR, SOMETHING
DIFFERENT LIKE ROSA PARKS,
PEOPLE OF GREAT WORTHINESS TO
OUR AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE WE'RE
ALLOWED TO GO AND SAY A FINAL
GOODBYE AND SAY THANK YOU FOR
YOUR SERVICE TO THIS NATION.
>> AND FOR A CANDIDATE WHO DID
MORE THAN 114 TOWN HALLS IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE, OF COURSE, HE WILL
HAVE BOTH IN PHOENIX, WHERE THE
PUBLIC WAS ALLOWED INTO THE
MEMORIAL AND ALSO TO GO BY THE
CASKET.
IT IS FITTING FOR THE MEMORY.
YOU ALSO SEE THERE, ANDY,
ANOTHER ONE OF SENATOR McCAIN'S
SONS STANDING NEXT TO MEGHAN AND
BRIDGET, SYDNEY, AND THEN DOUG
THERE AT THE END.
>> ALL SEVEN OF HIS CHILDREN
THERE WAITING.
WE'LL ALSO SEE, FOR THE FIRST
TIME JOHN McCAIN'S 106-YEAR-OLD
MOTHER, ROBERTA McCAIN.
>> AND WE SHOULD NOTE IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT IS JOE McCAIN THERE
BEHIND SYDNEY.
HE LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE SENATOR,
HIS BROTHER, JOHN McCAIN.
>> LET'S PAUSE FOR A MOMENT NOW
AS THE HEARSE OPENS.
THE CASKET WILL BE CARRIED INTO
THE ROTUNDA BY THE ARMED FORCES
BODY BEARERS.
THIS IS A SOLEMN DUTY.
>>> THAT SOUND YOU HEAR
.
>> THAT SOUND YOU HEAR IS
ACTUALLY RAIN FOLLOWING IN THE
NATION'S CAPITAL.
NOT A HEAVY RAIN.
>> FITTING FOR THE MOMENT.
NANCY CORDES IS RIGHT THERE ON
CAPITOL HILL.
NANCY?
>> Reporter: WELL, HOW
REMARKABLE, NORAH, THAT THE RAIN
IS COMING DOWN AS HIS CASKET IS
TAKEN OUT OF THE HEARSE AND AS
THEY BEGIN TO WALK IT INTO THE
CAPITOL ROTUNDA WHERE HE WILL
LIE IN STATE AND COME BACK TO
THIS BUILDING FOR ONE LAST TIME.
WE SAW 12 TO 15,000 PEOPLE COME
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO McCAIN
AT THE ARIZONA STATE CAPITOL AND
THOUSANDS MORE ARE EXPECTED TO
COME HERE TODAY.
AT THE TOP OF HIS STEPS, HIS
SONS SALUTING AS THE CASKET
PREPARES TO MAKE THE JOURNEY UP
THE STEPS.
THE FAMILY IS GATHERED TO KEEP
DRY AS THE RAIN FALL GETS
HEAVIER HERE.
JOHN McCAIN WAS A UNIQUE
BIPARTISAN FIGURE IN THE SENATE,
BIPARTISAN BECAUSE HE DELIGHTED
AND INFURIATED BOTH PARTIES IN
EQUAL MEASURE.
TODAY, WHEN YOU HEAR FROM THE
SENATE'S MAJORITY LEADER MITCH
McCONNELL.
YOU'LL GET A FLAVOR OF THAT.
HE WAS SIDE BY SIDE WITH JOHN
McCAIN IN MANY BATTLES AND ON
THE OTHER SIDE, ON MANY MORE.
YOU KNOW, FOR McCONNELL AND
OTHERS IN THE SENATE, THINGS CAN
BE PRETTY ORCHESTRATED, PRETTY
SCRIPTED THESE DAYS.
NOT A LOT OF SURPRISES.
THERE WERE ALWAYS SURPRISES FROM
JOHN McCAIN.
>> I'M GETTING THE CHILLS KIND
OF WATCHING THIS.
ALMOST STARTING TO TEAR UP
THINKING ABOUT THIS FINAL VISIT
BY THE SENATOR AND IT RAINING.
>> THE BODY BEARERS WHO
EXEMPLIFY.
LOOK HOW THEY ARE CARRYING OUT
THEIR DUTY.
YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT IS RAINING
ON THEM.
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
DEMONSTRATION OF PRECISION AND
RESPECT, THROUGH THE PRECISION,
A MAINTENANCE OF NORMS AND
STANDARDS IN CARRYING OUT
SOMEBODY WHO HAS SERVED.
>> EACH OF THEM FROM A DIFFERENT
SERVICE OF OUR U.S. MILITARY AS
THE OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION THAT
ALLOWS JOHN McCAIN TO LIE IN
STATE SAYS THE NATION MOURNS THE
LOSS OF A GREAT AMERICAN
PATRIOT, A STATESMAN WHO PUT HIS
COUNTRY FIRST AND ENRICHED THIS.
>> THERE IS ALSO A SYMBOL OF
PATRIOTISM AS HIS BODY IS TAKEN
INTO THE CAPITOL WITH HIS FAMILY
WATCHING, STANDING BY.
I WANT TO READ PART OF THE
STATEMENT THAT HIS DAUGHTER
RELEASED AFTER HIS PASSING.
>> MEGHAN McCAIN.
>> MEGHAN McCAIN.
>> SHE SAID MY FATHER'S PASSING
COMES WITH SORROW AND GRIEF FOR
ME, MY MOTHER AND FOR MY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
HE WAS A GREAT FIRE WHO BURNED
BRIGHT AND WE LIVED IN HIS LIGHT
AND WARMTH FOR SO VERY LONG.
WE KNOW HIS FLAME LIVES ON IN
EACH OF US.
POWERFUL WORDS ABOUT A FAMILY
MAN BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK.
HIS COLLEAGUES SPOKE ABOUT HOW
HE REACHED ACROSS BOTH SIDES OF
THE AISLE AND IN PLANNING HIS
SERVICES, HE HAS DONE THAT.
THE PRESENTATION OF THE SENATE
WREATH WILL BE BY BOTH MAJORITY
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL AND
MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER.
>> THERE WE SEE THE INSIDE OF
THE CAPITOL ROTUNDA WHERE THERE
ARE INVITED GUESTS.
YOU CAN SEE THE WHITE HOUSE
CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY IS
THERE.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, ONE OF
HIS BEST FRIENDS.
>> DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD
ROSENSTEIN.
FORMER SENATOR COHEN OF MAINE.
>> HE WILL BE A PALL BEARER
TOMORROW.
>> SOME WERE AT THE CEREMONY
LAST NIGHT AND HAVE ALSO COME,
AGAIN, TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.
WE MENTIONED THE CATAFALQUE,
THIS PLATFORM CONSTRUCTED
HASTILY BACK IN 1865.
INCREDIBLE HISTORY.
NOT ONLY WE MENTIONED THOSE WHO
LIE IN STATE BUT ALSO HELD THE
CASKETS OF MANY OF THE SUPREME
COURT JUSTICES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
RONALD REAGAN AND DOUGLAS
McARTHUR, DWIGHT EISENHOWER.
>> BOB SCHIEFFER AND MARGARET
BRENNAN ARE IN WASHINGTON.
BOB?
>> Reporter: WELL, I'M JUST
THINKING HOW MANY TIMES THAT
JOHN McCAIN HAS GONE ACROSS THE
ROTUNDA, GOING FROM ONE PLACE TO
ANOTHER.
IT IS A ROTUNDA, THE SENATE IS
ON ONE SIDE AND THE HOUSE IS ON
THE OTHER, BUT YOU KNOW, JOHN
McCAIN WAS A FAMILIAR FIGURE IN
WHAT WE ALWAYS CALL THE
CORRIDORS OF POWER.
THOSE SENATE HIGHWAYS, BECAUSE
THE GREAT THING ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE A REPORTER, IS YOU
GET TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE UP
CLOSE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE, YOU KNOW, THE PRESS
SECRETARY AND ALL OF THAT.
THEY'RE GOING FROM ONE PLACE TO
ANOTHER IN THE CAPITOL, YOU JUST
WALK UP AND ASK THEM A QUESTION.
McCAIN, SENATOR McCAIN, YOU
COULD ALWAYS FIND SENATOR
McCAIN.
HE ALWAYS HAD TIME TO TALK TO
YOU, AND HE USED TO LAUGH ABOUT
THIS.
I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SO LONG, HE
ALWAYS SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TWO
OLD GEEZERS IN THIS HALL WAY
FILLED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
WERE 30 YEARS YOUNGER THAN WE
WERE, ALL OF THE OTHER
REPORTERS.
WE USED TO LAUGH ABOUT THAT A
LOT.
WE'RE ACTUALLY THE SAME AGE.
HE WAS SO MUCH FUN TO COVER.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS SUCH A NORMAL
HUMAN PERSON.
HE WOULD GET MAD.
HE WOULD USE BAD LANGUAGE
SOMETIMES.
HE LIKED JOKES.
HE LOVES TO RIB YOU.
HE WAS ALWAYS ASK ME IF I
INVESTIGATED LIVING IN ASSISTED
LIVING AT ONE POINT.
HE JUST BROUGHT A LITTLE
SOMETHING EXTRA.
>> YOU KNOW, YOU MENTIONED
THERE, BOB, THAT HE WAS THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE SENATE.
HE BECAME THE CONSCIENCE OF THE,
SORT OF, GLOBAL ORDER.
AS SOMEONE WHO COVERED NATIONAL
SECURITY, JOHN McCAIN WAS
SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS STOOD UP
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO
SAY WHETHER IT WAS LEAD FROM
BEHIND OR AMERICA FIRST, THIS
WAS NOT THE WAY THAT THINGS
NEEDED TO BE.
ON ONE OF THE LAST TRIPS ABROAD
WENT TO MUNICH AND STARED DOWN
PUTIN AND SAID I'LL BE HERE TO
SUPPORT VALUES.
WE'LL SEE SOMEONE SEATED THERE
AT THE REQUEST OF JOHN McCAIN
HIMSELF, A FINAL STATEMENT THERE
THAT WESTERN VALUES, IN HIS
VIEW, THE GLOBAL ORDER; WORTH
DEFENDING.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THE
RUSSELL BUILDING HERE IN
WASHINGTON WOULD BE RENAMED
AFTER JOHN McCAIN.
THERE IS SOME TALK IN BRUSSELS,
BELL BELGIUM ABOUT RENAMING THE
NATO HEADQUARTERS AFTER JOHN
McCAIN.
>> YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING,
THAT IS AN INTERESTING POINT,
MARGARET.
IN JOURNALISM, WE KNOW
WHO DOES THEIR WORK THEMSELVES,
WHO GOES OUT AND CHECKS OUT THE
STORY THEMSELVES.
JOHN McCAIN ALWAYS WENT TO THE
SCENE OF THE CRIME.
HE WENT TO ALL OF THESE PLACES
AND HE BROUGHT A CERTAIN
CREDIBILITY JUST BECAUSE HE HAD
BEEN THERE AND TALKED TO THESE
PEOPLE HIMSELF.
>> SYRIA, AFGHANISTAN, WAR
ZONES.
>> THAT MOMENT YOU RECOUNTED
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE WAS AT
THE SECURITY CONFERENCE, HAD A
SPEECH PREPARED AND WENT OFF
SCRIPT AND TOOK ON PUTIN RIGHT
THERE IN FRONT OF ALL OF THE
MILITARY LEADERS OF THE MAJOR
COUNTRIES ON THE GLOBE THAT IS
WHAT HE WAS DOING IN A BIG VENUE
LIKE THAT OR CARRYING THE FLAG
OF HIS IDEALS AND WHAT HE CALLED
THE AMERICAN IDEA INTO SMALL
CORNERS OF THE EARTH WHERE HE
THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE BEING
OPPRESSED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT OR
SOME OTHER FORCES.
>> WE NOW SEE THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES, EXCUSE ME,
MARGARET, AND HIS WIFE, KAREN
PENCE, AS WELL AS THE LEADERS OF
BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE
ENTERING NOW TO TAKE THEIR
SEATS.
>> BOB, YOU WERE MENTIONING
SENATOR McCAIN'S HUMOR ABOUT THE
INSTITUTION THAT HE LOVES SO
MUCH.
I ONCE ASKED HIM WHEN HE
REFERRED TO A FORMER COLLEAGUE
AS HIS GOOD FRIEND.
A LOT OF TIMES SENATORS REFER TO
THEMSELVES AS GOOD FRIENDS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HE SAID, WELL, MOSTLY NOTHING.
HE ALWAYS LIKED TO POKE A LITTLE
FUN AT SOME OF THE
INSTITUTIONAL, AND THERE WE SEE
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE STOPPING IN
TO SAY HELLO TO SENATOR McCAIN'S
MOTHER.
>> YOU KNOW, JOHN McCAIN TALKS
ABOUT IN HIS BOOK THAT HE TALKS
ABOUT BEING THE FATHER OF
ADMIRALS IN THE FAITH OF MY
FATHERS.
HE SAYS I WAS MY MOTHER'S SON
AND HE IS REFERRING TO ROBERTA
McCAIN, A REAL PISTOL IN HER OWN
RIGHT WHO HAD A TWIN SISTER AND
THEY USED TO TRAVEL EUROPE
TOGETHER.
ONE TIME AT THE AGE OF 91 WHEN
SHE TRIED TO RENT A CAR IN
FRANCE AND THEY REFUSED TO RENT
HER THE CAR, THEY SAID SHE WAS
TOO OLD, SHE JUST BOUGHT A CAR
HERSELF AND SHIPPED IT HOME TO
THE STATES AND DROVE IT ACROSS
COUNTRY.
JOHN McCAIN RECALLED GETTING A
CALL FROM MY MOTHER SAYING MY
MOTHER IN THE 90s IS DRIVING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON A ROAD
TRIP.
AT 106 YEARS OLD TODAY, A
DIFFICULT TASK OF SAYING GOODBYE
TO ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>>> LET'S
LET'S LISTEN INSIDE THE
CAPITOL ROTUNDA WHERE THE
CEREMONY HONORING SENATOR JOHN
McCAIN IS SET TO BEGIN.
THEY HAVE CHANGED THE FLAG ON
TOP OF THE CASKET, AS IT WAS
RAINING OUTSIDE WHEN THEY
BROUGHT SENATOR McCAIN INTO THE
CAPITOL.
CAPITOL.
>> LET US 
LET US PRAY.
>> WE GIVE YOU THANKS, ALMIGHTY
GOD, FOR THE APPEARANCE AMONG US
OF GREAT MEN AND WOMEN, WHO
SERVE AS INSPIRATIONS FOR ALL
AMERICANS TO BE THEIR BEST IN
SERVICE TO GOD, COUNTRY, AND
NEIGHBOR.
THIS DAY WE HONOR A TRUE
AMERICAN HERO, SENATOR JOHN
McCAIN.
HE DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO
PUBLIC SERVICE AS A VOCATION,
FIRST IN THE MILITARY, AND THEN
IN ELECTED OFFICE.
HE PLACED HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN
HARM'S WAY DURING THE VIETNAM
WAR IN HIS GREAT SACRIFICE OF
PERSONAL FREEDOM IS WELL KNOWN.
AS A SENATOR, HE SERVED WITH
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY, WORKING
BOTH WITH THOSE WITH WHOM HE
AGREED AND MANY WITH WHOM HE DID
NOT.
HIS WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK THE
TRUTH AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT, EVEN
WHEN IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY
EXPEDIENT TO DO SO PROVED TO BE
A RARE PHENOMENON.
FOR THAT REASON, IT WAS ALL THE
MORE PRECIOUS.
AS WE CONTINUE THIS CELEBRATION
OF HONOR, GRANT THAT ALL WHO
ATTEND TO THESE PROCEEDINGS
MIGHT TRANSCEND SMALLNESS IN
LIMITATION AND EMERGE AS PEOPLE
DESIROUS OF BEING OUR BEST
SELVES IN SERVICE TO ALL OF OUR
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS YOU
MIGHT CALL EACH OF US TO BE.
DEAR LORD, THANK YOU FOR
INSPIRING SUCH GREATNESS IN
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND CONTINUE
TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, AMEN.
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, 
MR. 
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MR.
SPEAKER, COLLEAGUE COLLEAGUES,
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND THE
McCAIN FAMILY, IT IS AN HONOR TO
WELCOME YOU THIS MORNING.
WE GATHER TO RECOGNIZE A GREAT
LOSS AND CELEBRATE A GREAT LIFE.
WE CELEBRATE SIX DECADES OF
DEVOTION TO THE AMERICAN IDEA
AND THE CAUSE OF HUMAN FREEDOM.
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WILL
CONTINUE TO MARVEL AT THE MAN
WHO LIES BEFORE US.
THE COCKY, HAND SOME, NAVAL
AVIATOR WHO BARELY SCRAPED
THROUGH SCHOOL AND THEN FOUGHT
FOR FREEDOM IN THE SKIES, WHO
WITNESSED TO OUR HIGHEST VALUES
EVEN THROUGH TERRIBLE TORTURE
AND WHO BECAME A GENERATIONAL
LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES
SENATE FOR OUR NATION HAIRS ITS
GREAT DEBATES.
AIRING OUR GREAT DEBATES IS A
GENTLE WAY TO DESCRIBE HOW JOHN
APPROACHED THE WORK OF A
SENATOR.
I'VE LONG JOKED THAT THE FOLKS
AT HANOI HILTON NEEDED THERAPY
AFTER JOHN WAS FINISHED WITH
THEM.
SOME OF THE COLLEAGUES ATTEMPTED
TO FORM A SUPPORT GROUP OF OUR
OWN.
HE TREATED EVERY ISSUE WITH THE
INTENSITY TO PEOPLE'S BUSINESS
DESERVED.
HE WOULD FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL
FOR HIS VISION OF THE COMMON
GOOD, DEPENDING ON THE ISSUE,
YOU KNEW JOHN WOULD EITHER BE
YOUR STAUNCHEST ALLY OR MOST SUB
YES OR NO OPPONENT.
AT ANY MOMENT HE MIGHT BE
PREPARING AN ELOQUENT REFLECTION
ON HUMAN LIBERTY OR A
DEVASTATING JOKE SERVED UP WITH
HIS SIGNATURE CACKLE AND JOHN
McCAIN GLINT IN HIS
. 
>>>  AND OUR SLIGHTLY STREAK 
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE. 
I WILL MISS A DEAR FRIEND. 
HIS SMILE REMINDED US THAT 
SERVICE IS A PRIVILEGE AND 
WHOSE SCARS REMINDED US OF THE 
GREAT COST THAT BRAVE SOULS PAY 
FOR OUR FREEDOM. 
JOHN FELT LIKE FAMILY. 
BUT OF COURSE IT IS CINDY AND 
ROBERTA AND JOE AND DOUG, 
ANDIE, SIDNEY, MEGAN, JACK, 
BRIDGET WHO COULD TRULY CALL 
THIS MAN THEIR OWN. 
AND BEHALF OF THE SENATE AND 
THE ENTIRE NATION, THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU FOR LENDING HIM TO US 
LONGER THAN WE HAD A RIGHT. 
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING HIM 
WHILE HE SUPPORTED US. 
HALF A WORLD AWAY WEARING OUR 
NATION'S UNIFORM JOHN MCCAIN 
STOOD UP FOR EVERY VALUE THAT 
THIS CAPITAL BUILDING 
REPRESENTS. 
THEN HE BROUGHT THAT SAME 
PATRIOTISM INSIDE ITS WALLS TO 
ADVOCATE FOR OUR SERVICE 
MEMBERS, OUR VETERANS AND OUR 
MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. 
SO IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT TODAY 
NEAR THE END OF HIS LONG 
JOURNEY JOURNEY, JOHN LIES HERE 
IN THIS GREAT HALL UNDER THIS 
MIGHTY DOME LIKE OTHER AMERICAN 
HEROS BEFORE HIM. 
HERE, AS A RESTLESS WAVE 
APPROACHES THE SHORES OF 
ETERNITY, WE THANK GOD FOR 
GIVING THIS COUNTRY JOHN MCCAIN.
>>>  ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 
NATION AND ON BEHALF OF 
CONGRESS, I WANT TO BEGIN BY 
GIVING THANKS TO THE MCCAIN 
FAMILY FOR YOUR MANY YEARS OF 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. 
WE SHARE YOUR ANGER IN LOSING 
THIS--ANGUISH IN LOSING THIS 
GREAT MAN. 
RARELY DOES THIS GLORIOUS 
ROTUNDA FALL SILENT AT THIS 
HOUR. 
ON A DAY LIKE THIS JOHN WOULD 
BE BOUNDING THIS WAY OR THAT 
WAY RIGHT THROUGH HERE VISITORS 
TURNING TO EACH OTHER ASKING IF 
THAT'S WHO THEY THINK IT IS. 
BUT IN THIS QUIET HOUR, WE ARE 
LEFT TO PONDER HOW HIS LIFE 
SPEAKS TO US. 
JOHN MCCAIN DESERVES TO BE 
REMEMBERED AS HE WISHED TO BE 
REMEMBERED. 
A PATRIOT WHO SERVED HIS 
COUNTRY, A MAN, YES, OF THE 
SENATE BUT ALSO A MAN OF THE 
HOUSE. 
A NAVY MAN. 
A FAMILY MAN. 
A MAN WHO MADE AN ENORMOUS 
DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF 
COUNTLESS PEOPLE. 
A MAN OF CONVICTION. 
A MAN OF STATE. 
THERE'S A LINE FROM HIS 
FAREWELL STATEMENT THAT REALLY 
JUST GRABBED ME. 
OUR IDENTITIES AND SENSE OF 
WORTH ARE NOT SCRIBED BUT 
ENLARGED BY SERVING GOOD CAUSES 
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. 
THAT'S JOHN MCCAIN. 
HOW FITTING AND HOW TRUE. 
WHAT STANDS OUT ABOUT JOHN 
MCCAIN IS WHAT HE STOOD FOR. 
THE RICH BLESSINGS THAT ONLY 
FREEDOM CAN BESTOW. 
THE PURPOSE THAT A JOIN CAN 
BRING. 
THE COMMON HUMANITY THAT BURNS 
IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS. 
HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE THE WORLD 
BREAKS EVERYONE AND AFTERWARD, 
MANY ARE STRONG AT THE BROKEN 
PLACES. 
NO ONE, NO ONE WAS STRONGER AT 
THE BROKEN PLACES THAN JOHN 
MCCAIN. 
THE BROKENNESS WAS HIS 
BALANCEST. 
HE NEVER LOST THE JOY THAT TIME 
CAN DEAL OR THE EDGE THAT 
POLITICAL LIFE SO OFTEN SANDS 
AWAY. 
I MYSELF FROM TIME TO TIME 
FOUND MYSELF ON THE RECEIVING 
END OF JOHN'S DISTINCT BRAND OF 
CANDOR HAPPILY SO. 
I REMEMBER THINKING MORE THAN 
ONCE, YEAH, HE REALLY DOES TALK 
LIKE A SAILOR. 
BUT YOU SEE, WITH JOHN, IT WAS 
NEVER FAMED DISAGREEMENT. 
THE MAN DIDN'T FAME ANYTHING. 
HE JUST RELISHED THE FIGHT. 
HE SHOWED US THAT IN THE ARENA, 
THE HONEST BACK AND FORTH, 
THAT'S WHERE THE CAUSE GETS 
BIGGER. 
THAT'S WHERE THE TRIUMPH IS ALL 
THE SWEETER. 
WE GET STRONGER AT THE BROKEN 
PLACES. 
THOUGH THE HIGHEST SALUTED HIM 
HE ATTAINED WHAT IS FAR MORE 
ENDURING, THE ABIDING AFFECTION 
OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS. 
AND IN AN EXAMPLE FOR FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. 
SO I THINK AHEAD NOW, I THINK 
AHEAD TO THE DAY WHEN I LIKE SO 
MANY WILL BRING MY OWN CHILDREN 
AND PERHAPS THEIR CHILDREN TO 
THAT LAWN IN ANNAPOLIS. 
I THINK ABOUT THAT. 
I THINK ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT SAY 
TO THEM. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST 
SOULS OUR NATION HAS EVER 
PRODUCED. 
HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO YOUR 
PART, I HOPE YOU DO IT THE WAY 
HE DID. 
WITH ENERGY AND URGENCY, 
PLAYING FOR KEEPS. 
NEVER BACK ON YOUR HEELS. 
NEVER LETTING PRINCIPAL YIELD 
TO EXPEDIENCE. 
RESISTING THE FALSE ALLURE OF 
THE FLEETING AND BATTENING DOWN 
THE HATCHES WHEN THINGS GET 
ROUGH. 
AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS HAVING A 
REALLY GOOD STORY TO TELL. 
TODAY OUR NATION BOWS IN GRIEF. 
BUT HERE, UNDER THE WORK OF 
RAMEDE AND IN THE GAZE OF THE 
GREATS WHERE SOLDIERS KNOWN AND 
UNKNOWN HAVE LAID BEFORE. 
WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL THING, 
THE CHANCE TO DO FOR THIS MAN 
WHAT HE DID FOR US. 
TO STAND UP. 
TO STAND UP AND TO EMBRACE THE 
CAUSE OF HIS LIFE. 
NO ONE OF US CAN FULFILL THIS 
CHARGE BUT ALL OF US SURE CAN 
TRY. 
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS, ALL OF 
THIS, ITS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. 
GOD BLESS JOHN MCCAIN. 
AND GOD BLESS THE COUNTRY HE SO 
DEARLY LOVED.
>>> LEADER M
>>>  LEADER MCCONNELL, SPEAKER 
RYAN, LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER 
PELOSI, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS. 
MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, MEMBERS 
OF OUR ARMED FORCES AND HONORED 
GUESTS AND MOST OF ALL TO THE 
MCCAIN FAMILY. 
TO CINDY, HIS CHILDREN AND MRS. 
ROBERTA MCCAIN. 
IT IS DEEPLY HUMBLING TO STAND 
BEFORE YOU TODAY AT THE UNITED 
STATES CAPITAL TO COMMEMORATE 
THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF AN 
AMERICAN PATRIOT. 
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN. 
THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO BE 
HERE ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 
NATION TO PAY A DEBT OF HONOR 
AND RESPECT TO A MAN WHO SERVED 
OUR COUNTRY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE 
IN UNIFORM AND IN PUBLIC 
OFFICE. 
AND IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO BE 
HERE. 
IN THE LONG HISTORY OF OUR 
NATION, ONLY 30 AMERICANS HAVE 
LAIN IN STATE HERE IN THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITAL ROTUNDA. 
TODAY, AS A REFLECTION OF THE 
ESTEEM IN WHICH HIS COLLEAGUES 
AND OUR COUNTRY HOLD HIM, 
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN JOINS THOSE 
RANKS. 
THE SON AND THE GRANDSON OF 
FOUR STAR ADMIRALS, JOHN CAME 
FROM A FAMILY THAT PRIZED 
MILITARY SERVICE. 
HE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES 
NAVAL ACADEMY WHEN HE WAS JUST 
17 YEARS OLD. 
HIS SERVICE AS A NAVAL AVIATOR 
TOOK HIM AROUND THE WORLD AND 
EVENTUALLY TO THE WAR IN 
VIETNAM. 
IT WAS THERE ON HIS 23rd 
BOMBING RUN THAT JOHN WAS SHOT 
DOWN AND CAPTURED. 
REFUSING EARLY RELEASE FOR THE 
SAKE OF HIS COMRADES, HE 
ENDURED FIVE AND A HALF YEARS 
OF CONFINEMENT AND TORTURE. 
THEN AS NOW, AMERICANS MARVELED 
AT THE IRON WILL OF JOHN 
MCCAIN. 
BUT CAPTIVITY DID NOT DIMINISH 
JOHN'S SENSE OF CALLING, OR HIS 
COMMITMENT TO MISSION. 
AS HE WOULD LATER SAY, I FELL 
IN LOVE WITH MY COUNTRY WHEN I 
WAS A PRISONER IN SOMEONE 
ELSE'S. 
AND AFTER HE MADE IT HOME, JOHN 
TRADED SERVICE IN THE UNIFORM 
OF THE UNITED STATES FOR 
SERVICE IN CONGRESS, EXCHANGING 
THE RANK OF CAPTAIN FOR 
CONGRESS MAN AND LATER SENATOR. 
FOR 35 YEARS, JOHN SERVED IN 
THESE VERY HALLS UNDER THIS 
VERY DOME. 
AND HE FOUGHT FOR WHAT HE 
BELIEVED IN. 
IN MY YEARS IN CONGRESS, AND AS 
VICE PRESIDENT, WE DIDN'T 
ALWAYS AGREE EITHER. 
AND HE ALMOST ALWAYS NOTICED. 
BUT HIS SUPPORT FOR LIMITED 
GOVERNMENT, FOR TAX REFORM AND 
SUPPORT FOR OUR ARMED FORCES 
SURELY LEFT OUR NATION MORE 
PROSPEROUS AND MORE SECURE AND 
HE WILL BE MISSED. 
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 
YESTERDAY, WE RESPECT HIS 
SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY. 
LIKE MANY OF YOU GATHERED HERE 
I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF 
TRAVELING WITH SENATOR MCCAIN 
TO VISIT OUR TROOPS OVER SEAS. 
EARLIER THIS WEEK, I TOLD CINDY 
OF THE TIME ON A TRIP THROUGH 
IRAQ. 
AFTER ANOTHER 18 HOUR DAY, WHEN 
I WAS LITERALLY FALLING ASLEEP 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A DINNER WITH 
IRAQI OFFICIALS, AFTER THE 
DINNER, JOHN, WHO WAS MORE THAN 
20 YEARS OLDER THAN ME, WALKED 
UP, PUT HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER 
AND SAID MIKE, WE'VE GOT A FEW 
MORE MEETINGS TONIGHT BUT WHY 
DON'T YOU TURN IN. 
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE 
SOME REST. 
THANKS, JOHN. 
HONESTLY, SEEING HIM DOWN 
RANGE, I NEVER TRAVELED WITH A 
COLLEAGUE WHO WAS BETTER TO OUR 
ENLISTED OR HARDER ON OUR 
GENERALS. 
JOHN MCCAIN LOVED THE MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THE UNIFORM 
OF THE UNITED STATES AND HE WAS 
A CHAMPION OF OUR ARMED FORCES 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. 
IN EVERY GENERATION THERE ARE 
THOSE WHO PUT COUNTRY FIRST WHO 
PRIDE SERVICE AHEAD OF SELF, 
WHO SUMON IDEALISM FROM A 
CYNICAL AGE. 
JOHN MCCAIN WAS SUCH A MAN. 
TODAY, HE LIES IN THE PLACE 
WHERE HE SERVED TO THE LAST THE 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. 
SOON HE WILL GO TO REST ON THE 
GROUNDS WHERE HE SERVED FIRST 
THE UNITED STATES NAVAL 
ACADEMY. 
THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WILL BE UPON HIM AS HE GOES. 
AND SO TOO WILL THEIR PRAYERS 
FOR HIM AND ESPECIALLY FOR HIS 
BELOVED FAMILY GATHERED HERE 
TODAY. 
AND WE WILL PRAY THAT THOSE WHO 
MOURN SHALL BE COMFORTED. 
SO WE MOURN WITH THOSE WHO 
MOURN AND WE GRIEVE WITH THOSE 
WHO GRIEVE BUT WE DO NOT GRIEVE 
LIKE THOSE THAT HAVE NO HOPE 
BECAUSE JOHN MCCAIN LIKE 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HELD FIRM 
TO THAT HOPE FROM AN OLD HYMN 
THAT BECAME THE TITLE OF A BOOK 
HE WROTE SOME 20 YEARS AGO. 
FAITH OF OUR FATHERS. 
THE FULL STANZA OF THAT HYMN 
READS FAITH OF OUR FATHERS 
LIVING STILL INSPITE OF DUNGEON 
FIRE AND SWORD, OH HOW OUR 
HEARTS BE HIGH WITH JOY, 
WHENEVER WE HEAR THAT GLORIOUS 
WORD. 
JOHN MCCAIN HELD FIRM TO THAT 
FAITH. 
THE FAITH OF HIS FATHERS 
THROUGH DUNGEONS FIRE AND 
SWORD. 
AND HE HELD FAST TO HIS FAITH 
IN AMERICA THROUGH SIX DECADES 
OF SERVICE. 
WE GATHER HERE TODAY TO HONOR 
AN AMERICAN PATRIOT. 
SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN 
HIMSELF AND WE GATHER HERE 
REMEMBERING A MAN WHO KNEW HOW 
HE WANTED TO BE REMEMBERED. 
AND SO LET ME SAY TO ALL OF 
THOSE GATHERED AND HIS BELOVED 
FAMILY, ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 
NATION, WE WILL EVER REMEMBER 
THAT JOHN MCCAIN SERVED HIS 
COUNTRY AND JOHN MCCAIN SERVED 
HIS COUNTRY HONORABLELY 
HONORABLELY--HONORABLY. 
MAY GOD BLESS THE FAMILY OF 
JOHN MCCAIN AND MAY GOD 
CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA.
>>>  LET US BOW OUR HEADS FOR 
THE BENEDICTION. 
ETERNAL LORD GOD, WHO HAS MADE 
OF ONE BLOOD ALL THE PEOPLE OF 
THE EARTH, WE GIVE THANKS FOR 
THE CONSEQUENTIAL LIFE OF 
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN A DRUM 
MAJOR FOR COURAGE, TRUTH AND 
JUSTICE. 
ACCEPT OUR GRATITUDE FOR HIS 
COMMITMENT TO MAKE DECISIONS 
BASED UPON PRINCIPALS. 
FOR HIS PRACTICING MATIC 
LEADERSHIP DURING TURBULENT 
TIMES AND FOR HIS LIFE OF 
HEROIC SERVICE. 
LORD, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR HIS 
EFFORTS TO DO WHAT WAS IN THE 
COUNTRY'S BEST INTEREST AND FOR 
PROVIDING INSPIRATION THAT KEPT 
OUR NATION STRONG. 
WE PRAISE YOU FOR PERMITTING 
SENATOR MCCAIN TO REMIND US 
THAT WE ARE TIED TO A SINGLE 
GARMENT OF DESTINY NEEDING ONE 
ANOTHER TO FULFILL YOUR 
PURPOSES FOR OUR LIVES. 
MAY THE LIFE OF THIS AMERICAN 
PATRIOT INSPIRE US TO SEE YOU 
MORE CLEARLY, TO LOVE YOU MORE 
DEARLY AND TO FOLLOW YOU MORE 
NEARLY EACH DAY. 
NOW, ONTO HIM WHO IS ABLE TO 
KEEP US WITHOUT STUMBLING OR 
SLIPPING AND TO PRESENT US 
BEFORE THE PRESENCE OF HIS 
GLORY WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT. 
WE ASCRIBE GLORY, MAJESTY AND 
MIGHT, DOMINION AND POWER NOW 
AND ALWAYS. 
WE PRAY IN THE NAME OF SENATOR 
MCCAIN'S REDEEMER, JESUS 
CHRIST. 
AMEN.
>>> AND
>>>  AND NOW WE SEE MEMBERS OF 
THE AUDIENCE AT THE U.S. 
CAPITAL CEREMONY STOPPING TO 
PAY THEIR RESPECTS. 
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL 
CALLED JOHN MCCAIN A 
GENERATIONAL LEADER. 
PAUL RYAN SAID HE WAS ONE OF 
THE BRAVEST SOULS OUR NATION 
HAS PRODUCED. 
BOB SCHAFER IN WASHINGTON YOUR 
REACTION, BOB? 
>> I THINK JOHN MCCAIN WAS 
MAYBE THE BRAVEST PERSON I EVER 
KNEW. 
HE WASN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING 
AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT I WILL 
ALWAYS REMEMBER ABOUT HIM. 
HE WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED THIS 
CEREMONY TODAY. 
HE WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED IT 
BUT I THINK HE WOULD ALSO BE 
READY TO MOVE ON. 
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE A 
LITTLE JOKE OF SOME KIND IF HE 
HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO WATCH AND 
PERHAPS HE IS WATCHING. 
AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT HE SAID. 
I VISITED HIM IN MAY AT HIS 
PLACE OUT THERE IN ARIZONA. 
HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DIE. 
HE KNEW THE TIME WAS COMING 
SHORTLY. 
BUT JOHN MCCAIN REALLY HAD NO 
REGRETS. 
HE WROTE I HATE TO LEAVE LIFE. 
I DON'T HAVE A COMPLAINT 
THOUGH, NOT ONE BECAUSE IT'S 
BEEN QUITE A RIDE. 
THAT WAS JOHN MCCAIN. 
GOD BLESS HIM. 
>> AND BOB, WE HEARD FROM MITCH 
MCCONNELL THAT JOHN MCCAIN 
REPRESENTED AMERICA'S FIGHTING 
SPIRIT. 
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING TO THIS MOMENT FOR A 
BIT OF SPIRIT THEMSELVES AND 
THE LESSON HERE IS THE ABILITY 
TO BE BIPARTISAN AND THE 
ABILITY TO BE OPTIMISTIC IN THE 
DARKEST HOURS. 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SOME ARE 
HOPING IF THERE IS MEANING TO 
BE TAKEN FROM ALL OF THIS, IT 
WILL BE THAT PERHAPS IN FORWARD 
MOVEMENT FROM A CONGRESS THAT 
JOHN MCCAIN WAS FRUSTRATED WITH 
LONG ALONG WITH THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.
