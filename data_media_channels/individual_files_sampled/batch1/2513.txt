Wow a trump win for the markets remember it was the market was supposed to go down who's absolutely supposed to go down it started to go down and we wake up the next morning and it's up and the next day it's up and I don't know where it goes from here because clearly nobody knows where it goes from here which i think is the the main point market timing doesn't work single stock picking really very rarely works we spend all this time in this energy on these traditional ways of investing the political pundits have already been embarrassed because the man got elected and they didn't call it but the market pundits didn't get embarrassed because everyone was calling for a down market and that doesn't happen and so the truth is back up right trying to play those games of where's the Dow going to be this year what sector is going to be up its come on guys the right way to do this is to invest in a diversified portfolio in my case I believe in ETFs and invest steadily and sometimes you're going to think the market is high and you're going to be right darn it and you invested then bummer but you know what you'll invest again the next month and you will have bought on sale and sometimes you're going to think it's high and you'll be wrong I can't tell you the number of people who told me a little worried about a trump victory so I'm going to wait to invest until afterwards and you're just brought you we're just not that good in it we just need to give it up
