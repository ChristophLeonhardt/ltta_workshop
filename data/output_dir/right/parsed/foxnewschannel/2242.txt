ROB: MIKE POMPEO CONFIRMING A
BOMBSHELL REPORT FROM ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NET AND
YAHOO, IRAN WAS LYING BEFORE THE
SIGNING OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR
DEAL.
>> A START WARNING THAT IRAN HID
A VAST ATOMIC ARCHIVE FROM THE
WORLD UNTIL TODAY.
DR. REBECCA GRANT, WE REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.
HOW DOES THIS NOT HELP AND HURT
US?
>> THE INFORMATION IS AUTHENTIC,
THE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE
TIMING.
ON THE ONE HAND THIS SHOWS TRUMP
WAS RIGHT TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF
THIS DEAL.
IN DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH
EUROPE, RUSSIA AND CHINA HOW TO
MODIFY THE DEAL, SO THE QUESTION
GOING FORWARD IS CAN THE BIG FIX
THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THIS
DEAL FIND A GOOD WAY TO MODIFY
IT.
>> THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS
AMOUNTS TO IRAN ACTUALLY
CHEATING ON THE DEAL AND THAT IS
WHAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT, WHETHER OR NOT LYING
IN THE YEARS AND MONTHS BEFORE
SIGNING THE DEAL MEANS THE DEAL,
HOW DO YOU SEE IT?
>> WE ARE PURSUING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS PROGRAM, AND THE
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY, THEY ARE
STILL TECHNICALLY IN COMPLIANCE.
AND TECHNICALLY IN COMPLIANCE
BUT WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A GOOD
SITUATION GOING FORWARD.
PATTY: 1 SPECIAL REPORT LAST
NIGHT, THIS ISN'T A SMOKING GUN
BUT A SMOKING BOMB.
DO YOU AGREE?
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS?
>> THIS IS PARTLY A BLOW BY
ISRAEL AGAINST IRAN, THEY ARE
SKIRMISHING, THEY ATTACKED EACH
OTHER BIT'S BASIS, BUT DON'T
INCURSION, SHOWDOWN, THIS IS THE
FIGHT GOING ON BETWEEN ISRAEL
AND IRAN.
IT IS SIGNIFICANT THEY ARE
CHEATING BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
IN ITSELF TO GET WHERE WE NEED
TO GO.
WE NEED AGREEMENT AMONG
SIGNATORIES AND IRAN TO ACCEPT
RESTRICTIONS ON MISSILE
DEVELOPMENT.
WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO.
I EXPECT A BUMPY RIDE AND OIL
PRICES WILL BOUNCE AROUND AS WE
SEE THIS GOING FORWARD.
ROB: ALLIES SAY ENDING THIS DEAL
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA, IRAN WAS
GIVEN SO MUCH AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE DEAL, BUT TO QUOTE THE
AMBASSADOR, AND BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, IN SANCTIONS BUT WE
RE-UP THIS THING.
AND MORE MONEY, YOU HAVE A DEAL
YOU SIGN, A LOT OF OUR ALLIES
THINK WE NEED TO STAY IN.
THEN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.
>> WE KNOW THE DEAL WAS BAD
BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
MORE AT THE TIME BUT EVERYONE
WANTS A DEAL WITH IRAN.
WE JUST NEED IT TO BE A GOOD
DEAL.
IT ISN'T A GOOD DEAL NOW, NEEDS
TO BE STRONGER.
TRUMP HAS BEEN PATIENT, CLEAR TO
ME HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN OR
MODIFY IT TO KEEP IRAN FROM
DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
IT COMES DOWN TO WHETHER FRANCE,
GERMANY, THE UK AND US CAN AGREE
ON SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE THEM
STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, THE
DEAL ENDS AND THEY CAN ENRICH
URANIUM RIGHT AWAY.
IRAN IS NOT HELPING, THEY SAY WE
