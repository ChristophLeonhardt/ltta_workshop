00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NETANYAHU: Thank you.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(APPLAUSE)

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you...

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:47,885
(APPLAUSE)

5
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:56,185
... Speaker of the House John Boehner, President
Pro Tem Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Minority

6
00:00:56,185 --> 00:01:03,435
-- Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and House Majority

7
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:06,455
Leader Kevin McCarthy.

8
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:14,255
I also want to acknowledge Senator, Democratic
Leader Harry Reid.

9
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:18,455
Harry, it's good to see you back on your feet.

10
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,435
(APPLAUSE)

11
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:38,215
I guess it's true what they say, you can't
keep a good man down.

12
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:39,405
(LAUGHTER)

13
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:52,295
My friends, I'm deeply humbled by the opportunity
to speak for a third time before the most

14
00:01:52,295 --> 00:02:00,255
important legislative body in the world, the
U.S. Congress.(APPLAUSE)

15
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:05,935
NETANYAHU: I want to thank you all for being
here today.

16
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:12,775
I know that my speech has been the subject
of much controversy.

17
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:18,255
I deeply regret that some perceive my being
here as political.

18
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:21,895
That was never my intention.

19
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:28,315
I want to thank you, Democrats and Republicans,
for your common support for Israel, year after

20
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:40,105
year, decade after decade.

21
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:50,214
(APPLAUSE)

22
00:02:50,214 --> 00:03:04,115
I know that no matter on which side of the
aisle you sit, you stand with Israel.

23
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:12,055
(APPLAUSE)

24
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:25,575
The remarkable alliance between Israel and
the United States has always been above politics.

25
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:31,115
It must always remain above politics.

26
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:34,405
(APPLAUSE)

27
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:41,515
Because America and Israel, we share a common
destiny, the destiny of promised lands that

28
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:45,545
cherish freedom and offer hope.

29
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:52,295
Israel is grateful for the support of American
-- of America's people and of America's presidents,

30
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:54,305
from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)

31
00:03:54,305 --> 00:04:05,555
NETANYAHU: We appreciate all that President
Obama has done for Israel.

32
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:14,755
Now, some of that is widely known.

33
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:22,305
(APPLAUSE)

34
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:27,625
Some of that is widely known, like strengthening
security cooperation and intelligence sharing,

35
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:32,255
opposing anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N.

36
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:38,295
Some of what the president has done for Israel
is less well- known.

37
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:44,225
I called him in 2010 when we had the Carmel
forest fire, and he immediately agreed to

38
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:47,085
respond to my request for urgent aid.

39
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:54,145
In 2011, we had our embassy in Cairo under
siege, and again, he provided vital assistance

40
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:56,325
at the crucial moment.

41
00:04:56,325 --> 00:05:02,245
Or his support for more missile interceptors
during our operation last summer when we took

42
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:05,905
on Hamas terrorists.

43
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,585
(APPLAUSE)

44
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:17,345
In each of those moments, I called the president,
and he was there.

45
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:23,045
And some of what the president has done for
Israel might never be known, because it touches

46
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:30,695
on some of the most sensitive and strategic
issues that arise between an American president

47
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,135
and an Israeli prime minister.

48
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:38,075
But I know it, and I will always be grateful
to President Obama for that support.(APPLAUSE)

49
00:05:38,075 --> 00:06:02,285
NETANYAHU: And Israel is grateful to you,
the American Congress, for your support, for

50
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:08,295
supporting us in so many ways, especially
in generous military assistance and missile

51
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:14,295
defense, including Iron Dome.

52
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:18,265
(APPLAUSE)

53
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:24,295
Last summer, millions of Israelis were protected
from thousands of Hamas rockets because this

54
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:33,645
capital dome helped build our Iron Dome.

55
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:36,935
(APPLAUSE)

56
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:46,805
Thank you, America.

57
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,315
Thank you for everything you've done for Israel.

58
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:58,645
My friends, I've come here today because,
as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound

59
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:05,545
obligation to speak to you about an issue
that could well threaten the survival of my

60
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:13,645
country and the future of my people: Iran's
quest for nuclear weapons.

61
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,475
We're an ancient people.

62
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:24,285
In our nearly 4,000 years of history, many
have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish

63
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:26,295
people.

64
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:33,575
Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim,
we'll read the Book of Esther.

65
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:40,395
We'll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named
Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people

66
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:43,805
some 2,500 years ago.

67
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:51,115
But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther,
exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people

68
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:56,565
the right to defend themselves against their
enemies.NETANYAHU: The plot was foiled.

69
00:07:56,565 --> 00:08:01,965
Our people were saved.

70
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:06,355
(APPLAUSE)

71
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:14,725
Today the Jewish people face another attempt
by yet another Persian potentate to destroy

72
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,385
us.

73
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:30,935
Iran's Supreme Leader 
Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred,

74
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:35,885
the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the
newest technology.

75
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:40,385
He tweets that Israel must be annihilated
-- he tweets.

76
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:45,865
You know, in Iran, there isn't exactly free
Internet.

77
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:51,815
But he tweets in English that Israel must
be destroyed.

78
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:58,045
For those who believe that Iran threatens
the Jewish state, but not the Jewish people,

79
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:04,145
listen to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of
Hezbollah, Iran's chief terrorist proxy.

80
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:11,765
He said: If all the Jews gather in Israel,
it will save us the trouble of chasing them

81
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:17,115
down around the world.

82
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:23,965
But Iran's regime is not merely a Jewish problem,
any more than the Nazi regime was merely a

83
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,715
Jewish problem.

84
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:31,145
The 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis were
but a fraction of the 60 million people killed

85
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,735
in World War II.

86
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:39,834
So, too, Iran's regime poses a grave threat,
not only to Israel, but also the peace of

87
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:42,485
the entire world.

88
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:48,725
To understand just how dangerous Iran would
be with nuclear weapons, we must fully understand

89
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:55,645
the nature of the regime.NETANYAHU: The people
of Iran are very talented people.

90
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:58,395
They're heirs to one of the world's great
civilizations.

91
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:04,745
But in 1979, they were hijacked by religious
zealots -- religious zealots who imposed on

92
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:09,235
them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship.

93
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:15,245
That year, the zealots drafted a constitution,
a new one for Iran.

94
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:21,105
It directed the revolutionary guards not only
to protect Iran's borders, but also to fulfill

95
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:25,125
the ideological mission of jihad.

96
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:31,776
The regime's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini,
exhorted his followers to "export the revolution

97
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:32,776
throughout the world."

98
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:40,015
I'm standing here in Washington, D.C. and
the difference is so stark.

99
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:45,145
America's founding document promises life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

100
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:52,145
Iran's founding document pledges death, tyranny,
and the pursuit of jihad.

101
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:58,615
And as states are collapsing across the Middle
East, Iran is charging into the void to do

102
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,895
just that.

103
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:07,905
Iran's goons in Gaza, its lackeys in Lebanon,
its revolutionary guards on the Golan Heights

104
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:11,155
are clutching Israel with three tentacles
of terror.

105
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:15,905
Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering Syrians.

106
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:20,745
Back by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging
through Iraq.

107
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:26,545
Back by Iran, Houthis are seizing control
of Yemen, threatening the strategic straits

108
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:29,405
at the mouth of the Red Sea.

109
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:34,845
Along with the Straits of Hormuz, that would
give Iran a second choke-point on the world's

110
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:42,454
oil supply.NETANYAHU: Just last week, near
Hormuz, Iran carried out a military exercise

111
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:46,885
blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier.

112
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:53,145
That's just last week, while they're having
nuclear talks with the United States.

113
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:58,795
But unfortunately, for the last 36 years,
Iran's attacks against the United States have

114
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,785
been anything but mock.

115
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:04,485
And the targets have been all too real.

116
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:11,235
Iran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran,
murdered hundreds of American soldiers, Marines,

117
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:16,515
in Beirut, and was responsible for killing
and maiming thousands of American service

118
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:19,745
men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.

119
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:26,894
Beyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America
and its allies through its global terror network.

120
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:31,745
It blew up the Jewish community center and
the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires.

121
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:35,245
It helped Al Qaida bomb U.S. embassies in
Africa.

122
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:42,184
It even attempted to assassinate the Saudi
ambassador, right here in Washington, D.C.

123
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:50,024
In the Middle East, Iran now dominates four
Arab capitals, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and

124
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:51,454
Sanaa.

125
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:56,235
And if Iran's aggression is left unchecked,
more will surely follow.

126
00:12:56,235 --> 00:13:04,034
So, at a time when many hope that Iran will
join the community of nations, Iran is busy

127
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:09,084
gobbling up the nations.

128
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:13,134
(APPLAUSE)

129
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:26,005
We must all stand together to stop Iran's
march of conquest, subjugation and terror.

130
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:33,255
(APPLAUSE)

131
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:49,794
Now, two years ago, we were told to give President
Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance

132
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:55,404
to bring change and moderation to Iran.

133
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,725
Some change!

134
00:13:56,725 --> 00:14:06,584
Some moderation!NETANYAHU: Rouhani's government
hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists

135
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:11,245
and executes even more prisoners than before.

136
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:18,705
Last year, the same Zarif who charms Western
diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad

137
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:19,705
Mughniyeh.

138
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:25,874
Imad Mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind
who spilled more American blood than any other

139
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:29,435
terrorist besides Osama bin Laden.

140
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,384
I'd like to see someone ask him a question
about that.

141
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:39,364
Iran's regime is as radical as ever, its cries
of "Death to America," that same America that

142
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:42,695
it calls the "Great Satan," as loud as ever.

143
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:50,294
Now, this shouldn't be surprising, because
the ideology of Iran's revolutionary regime

144
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:56,955
is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that's
why this regime will always be an enemy of

145
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:59,555
America.

146
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:01,324
Don't be fooled.

147
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:08,544
The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn't turn
Iran into a friend of America.

148
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:12,675
Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown
of militant Islam.

149
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:15,624
One calls itself the Islamic Republic.

150
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,015
The other calls itself the Islamic State.

151
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:24,785
Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire
first on the region and then on the entire

152
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:25,854
world.

153
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:31,054
They just disagree among themselves who will
be the ruler of that empire.

154
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:37,344
In this deadly game of thrones, there's no
place for America or for Israel, no peace

155
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:43,735
for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don't
share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights

156
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:51,154
for women, no freedom for anyone.NETANYAHU:
So when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy

157
00:15:51,154 --> 00:16:02,874
of your enemy is your enemy.

158
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:12,475
(APPLAUSE)

159
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:19,465
The difference is that ISIS is armed with
butcher knives, captured weapons and YouTube,

160
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:25,705
whereas Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental
ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs.

161
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:32,515
We must always remember -- I'll say it one
more time -- the greatest dangers facing our

162
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:37,374
world is the marriage of militant Islam with
nuclear weapons.

163
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:44,955
To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons
would be to win the battle, but lose the war.

164
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:59,354
We can't let that happen.

165
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:05,844
(APPLAUSE)

166
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:14,644
But that, my friends, is exactly what could
happen, if the deal now being negotiated is

167
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:17,154
accepted by Iran.

168
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:21,654
That deal will not prevent Iran from developing
nuclear weapons.

169
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:27,554
It would all but guarantee that Iran gets
those weapons, lots of them.

170
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,945
Let me explain why.

171
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:36,105
While the final deal has not yet been signed,
certain elements of any potential deal are

172
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,755
now a matter of public record.

173
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:46,995
You don't need intelligence agencies and secret
information to know this.

174
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:58,995
You can Google it.NETANYAHU: Absent a dramatic
change, we know for sure that any deal with

175
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:03,715
Iran will include two major concessions to
Iran.

176
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:08,834
The first major concession would leave Iran
with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing

177
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:12,535
it with a short break-out time to the bomb.

178
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:18,175
Break-out time is the time it takes to amass
enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium

179
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,525
for a nuclear bomb.

180
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:27,075
According to the deal, not a single nuclear
facility would be demolished.

181
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:31,935
Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium
would be left spinning.

182
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:37,154
Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected,
but not destroyed.

183
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:42,514
Because Iran's nuclear program would be left
largely intact, Iran's break-out time would

184
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:49,304
be very short -- about a year by U.S. assessment,
even shorter by Israel's.

185
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:57,955
And if -- if Iran's work on advanced centrifuges,
faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped,

186
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:01,904
that break-out time could still be shorter,
a lot shorter.

187
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:07,574
True, certain restrictions would be imposed
on Iran's nuclear program and Iran's adherence

188
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:12,794
to those restrictions would be supervised
by international inspectors.

189
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:13,985
But here's the problem.

190
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:20,445
You see, inspectors document violations; they
don't stop them.

191
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:25,384
Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to
the bomb, but that didn't stop anything.

192
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:28,915
North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked
out the inspectors.

193
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:32,035
Within a few years, it got the bomb.

194
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:38,324
Now, we're warned that within five years North
Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear

195
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,495
bombs.

196
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:44,394
Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international
inspectors.

197
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:51,834
It's done that on at least three separate
occasions -- 2005, 2006, 2010.

198
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:58,084
Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut
off the cameras.NETANYAHU: Now, I know this

199
00:19:58,084 --> 00:20:05,185
is not gonna come a shock -- as a shock to
any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors,

200
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:11,134
it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat
with them.

201
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:18,965
The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA,
said again yesterday that Iran still refuses

202
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:23,705
to come clean about its military nuclear program.

203
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:29,564
Iran was also caught -- caught twice, not
once, twice -- operating secret nuclear facilities

204
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:35,725
in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors
didn't even know existed.

205
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:42,884
Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities
that we don't know about, the U.S. and Israel.

206
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:49,644
As the former head of inspections for the
IAEA said in 2013, he said, "If there's no

207
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:55,245
undeclared installation today in Iran, it
will be the first time in 20 years that it

208
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:58,854
doesn't have one."

209
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:04,054
Iran has proven time and again that it cannot
be trusted.

210
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:08,245
And that's why the first major concession
is a source of great concern.

211
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:16,735
It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure
and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout.

212
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:22,165
That concession creates a real danger that
Iran could get to the bomb by violating the

213
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:23,594
deal.

214
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:28,124
But the second major concession creates an
even greater danger that Iran could get to

215
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:32,035
the bomb by keeping the deal.

216
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:37,475
Because virtually all the restrictions on
Iran's nuclear program will automatically

217
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:44,195
expire in about a decade.NETANYAHU: Now, a
decade may seem like a long time in political

218
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:49,965
life, but it's the blink of an eye in the
life of a nation.

219
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:53,324
It's a blink of an eye in the life of our
children.

220
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:59,715
We all have a responsibility to consider what
will happen when Iran's nuclear capabilities

221
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:05,505
are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions
will have been lifted.

222
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:12,725
Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear
capacity that could product many, many nuclear

223
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:15,005
bombs.

224
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:16,874
Iran's Supreme Leader says that openly.

225
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:27,185
He says, Iran plans to have 190,000 centrifuges,
not 6,000 or even the 19,000 that Iran has

226
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:33,745
today, but 10 times that amount -- 190,000
centrifuges enriching uranium.

227
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:39,235
With this massive capacity, Iran could make
the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and

228
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:43,584
this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that
decision.

229
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:50,475
My long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary
of State, confirmed last week that Iran could

230
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:55,854
legitimately possess that massive centrifuge
capacity when the deal expires.

231
00:22:55,854 --> 00:23:01,814
Now I want you to think about that.

232
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:08,175
The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could
be weeks away from having enough enriched

233
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:15,614
uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons
and this with full international legitimacy.

234
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:22,804
And by the way, if Iran's Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile program is not part of the

235
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:29,864
deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put
it on the negotiating table.

236
00:23:29,864 --> 00:23:35,624
Well, Iran could have the means to deliver
that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners

237
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:43,824
of the Earth, including to every part of the
United States.NETANYAHU: So you see, my friends,

238
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:51,364
this deal has two major concessions: one,
leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and

239
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:57,344
two, lifting the restrictions on that program
in about a decade.

240
00:23:57,344 --> 00:24:01,784
That's why this deal is so bad.

241
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:09,564
It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb;
it paves Iran's path to the bomb.

242
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:13,195
So why would anyone make this deal?

243
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:18,014
Because they hope that Iran will change for
the better in the coming years, or they believe

244
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:21,255
that the alternative to this deal is worse?

245
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,775
Well, I disagree.

246
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:29,215
I don't believe that Iran's radical regime
will change for the better after this deal.

247
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:34,854
This regime has been in power for 36 years,
and its voracious appetite for aggression

248
00:24:34,854 --> 00:24:37,834
grows with each passing year.

249
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:42,904
This deal would wet appetite -- would only
wet Iran's appetite for more.

250
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:49,715
Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions
are removed and its economy is stronger?

251
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:55,065
If Iran is gobbling up four countries right
now while it's under sanctions, how many more

252
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:59,294
countries will Iran devour when sanctions
are lifted?

253
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:04,134
Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has
mountains of cash with which to fund more

254
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:06,455
terrorism?

255
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:12,404
Why should Iran's radical regime change for
the better when it can enjoy the best of both

256
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:18,534
world's: aggression abroad, prosperity at
home?

257
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:25,524
This is a question that everyone asks in our
region.

258
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:31,965
Israel's neighbors -- Iran's neighbors know
that Iran will become even more aggressive

259
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:37,175
and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy
is unshackled and it's been given a clear

260
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:44,644
path to the bomb.NETANYAHU: And many of these
neighbors say they'll respond by racing to

261
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:47,445
get nuclear weapons of their own.

262
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:52,344
So this deal won't change Iran for the better;
it will only change the Middle East for the

263
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,764
worse.

264
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:59,054
A deal that's supposed to prevent nuclear
proliferation would instead spark a nuclear

265
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:03,364
arms race in the most dangerous part of the
planet.

266
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:05,985
This deal won't be a farewell to arms.

267
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:09,094
It would be a farewell to arms control.

268
00:26:09,094 --> 00:26:12,894
And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed
by nuclear tripwires.

269
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:21,994
A region where small skirmishes can trigger
big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.

270
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:32,884
If anyone thinks -- if anyone thinks this
deal kicks the can down the road, think again.

271
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:40,104
When we get down that road, we'll face a much
more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered

272
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:49,004
with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential
nuclear nightmare.

273
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:55,104
Ladies and gentlemen, I've come here today
to tell you we don't have to bet the security

274
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:00,015
of the world on the hope that Iran will change
for the better.

275
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:04,765
We don't have to gamble with our future and
with our children's future.

276
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:12,535
We can insist that restrictions on Iran's
nuclear program not be lifted for as long

277
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:26,255
as Iran continues its aggression in the region
and in the world.(APPLAUSE)

278
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:41,175
NETANYAHU: Before lifting those restrictions,
the world should demand that Iran do three

279
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,195
things.

280
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:50,594
First, stop its aggression against its neighbors
in the Middle East.

281
00:27:50,594 --> 00:27:55,735
Second...

282
00:27:55,735 --> 00:28:00,874
(APPLAUSE)

283
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:11,844
Second, stop supporting terrorism around the
world.

284
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:15,564
(APPLAUSE)

285
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:32,935
And third, stop threatening to annihilate
my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish

286
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:38,374
state.

287
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:43,814
(APPLAUSE)

288
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:54,695
Thank you.

289
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:59,854
If the world powers are not prepared to insist
that Iran change its behavior before a deal

290
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:06,284
is signed, at the very least they should insist
that Iran change its behavior before a deal

291
00:29:06,284 --> 00:29:09,774
expires.

292
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:13,274
(APPLAUSE)

293
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:18,124
If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions
would be lifted.

294
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:25,564
If Iran doesn't change its behavior, the restrictions
should not be lifted.

295
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:29,004
(APPLAUSE)

296
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:33,774
If Iran wants to be treated like a normal
country, let it act like a normal country.(APPLAUSE)

297
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:57,624
NETANYAHU: My friends, what about the argument
that there's no alternative to this deal,

298
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:05,475
that Iran's nuclear know-how cannot be erased,
that its nuclear program is so advanced that

299
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:10,894
the best we can do is delay the inevitable,
which is essentially what the proposed deal

300
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,774
seeks to do?

301
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:17,685
Well, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure
doesn't get you very much.

302
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:21,334
A racecar driver without a car can't drive.

303
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:24,594
A pilot without a plan can't fly.

304
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:29,675
Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of
enriched uranium or heavy water facilities,

305
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:35,074
Iran can't make nuclear weapons.

306
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:39,304
(APPLAUSE)

307
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:44,564
Iran's nuclear program can be rolled back
well-beyond the current proposal by insisting

308
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:50,735
on a better deal and keeping up the pressure
on a very vulnerable regime, especially given

309
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:54,725
the recent collapse in the price of oil.

310
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:57,235
(APPLAUSE)

311
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:04,915
Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the
table -- and this often happens in a Persian

312
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:07,524
bazaar -- call their bluff.

313
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:17,894
They'll be back, because they need the deal
a lot more than you do.

314
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:20,804
(APPLAUSE)

315
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:26,784
And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and
on those who do business with Iran, you have

316
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:39,485
the power to make them need it even more.NETANYAHU:
My friends, for over a year, we've been told

317
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:43,505
that no deal is better than a bad deal.

318
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:47,175
Well, this is a bad deal.

319
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,785
It's a very bad deal.

320
00:31:49,785 --> 00:32:00,864
We're better off without it.

321
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:11,134
(APPLAUSE)

322
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:18,134
Now we're being told that the only alternative
to this bad deal is war.

323
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:20,024
That's just not true.

324
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:33,065
The alternative to this bad deal is a much
better deal.

325
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:42,925
(APPLAUSE)

326
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:47,985
A better deal that doesn't leave Iran with
a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short

327
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:49,705
break-out time.

328
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:54,884
A better deal that keeps the restrictions
on Iran's nuclear program in place until Iran's

329
00:32:54,884 --> 00:32:58,494
aggression ends.

330
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:01,175
(APPLAUSE)

331
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:05,834
A better deal that won't give Iran an easy
path to the bomb.

332
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:11,715
A better deal that Israel and its neighbors
may not like, but with which we could live,

333
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:12,715
literally.

334
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:13,825
And no country...

335
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,825
(APPLAUSE)

336
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:21,475
... no country has a greater stake -- no country
has a greater stake than Israel in a good

337
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:26,685
deal that peacefully removes this threat.

338
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:33,264
Ladies and gentlemen, history has placed us
at a fateful crossroads.

339
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:37,484
We must now choose between two paths.

340
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:43,425
One path leads to a bad deal that will at
best curtail Iran's nuclear ambitions for

341
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:51,154
a while, but it will inexorably lead to a
nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression

342
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:58,514
will inevitably lead to war.NETANYAHU: The
second path, however difficult, could lead

343
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:04,544
to a much better deal, that would prevent
a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle

344
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:11,725
East and the horrific consequences of both
to all of humanity.

345
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:16,195
You don't have to read Robert Frost to know.

346
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:24,634
You have to live life to know that the difficult
path is usually the one less traveled, but

347
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:29,175
it will make all the difference for the future
of my country, the security of the Middle

348
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:38,675
East and the peace of the world, the peace,
we all desire.

349
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:44,074
(APPLAUSE)

350
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:58,574
My friend, standing up to Iran is not easy.

351
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:04,544
Standing up to dark and murderous regimes
never is.

352
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:28,064
With us today is Holocaust survivor and Nobel
Prize winner Elie Wiesel.(APPLAUSE)

353
00:35:28,064 --> 00:36:21,235
NETANYAHU: Elie, your life and work inspires
to give meaning to the words, "never again."

354
00:36:21,235 --> 00:36:27,044
(APPLAUSE)

355
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:34,064
And I wish I could promise you, Elie, that
the lessons of history have been learned.

356
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:42,745
I can only urge the leaders of the world not
to repeat the mistakes of the past.

357
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:46,364
(APPLAUSE)

358
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:53,364
Not to sacrifice the future for the present;
not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining

359
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:55,994
an illusory peace.

360
00:36:55,994 --> 00:37:02,275
But I can guarantee you this, the days when
the Jewish people remained passive in the

361
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:06,975
face of genocidal enemies, those days are
over.(APPLAUSE)

362
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:39,955
NETANYAHU: We are no longer scattered among
the nations, powerless to defend ourselves.

363
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:43,185
We restored our sovereignty in our ancient
home.

364
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:48,104
And the soldiers who defend our home have
boundless courage.

365
00:37:48,104 --> 00:38:02,225
For the first time in 100 generations, we,
the Jewish people, can defend ourselves.

366
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:11,374
(APPLAUSE)

367
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:19,545
This is why -- this is why, as a prime minister
of Israel, I can promise you one more thing:

368
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:31,055
Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel
will stand.

369
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:38,685
(APPLAUSE)

370
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:41,124
But I know that Israel does not stand alone.

371
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:48,114
I know that America stands with Israel.

372
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:53,195
(APPLAUSE)

373
00:38:53,195 --> 00:39:09,524
I know that you stand with Israel.

374
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:10,524
(APPLAUSE)

375
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:16,404
You stand with Israel, because you know that
the story of Israel is not only the story

376
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:23,984
of the Jewish people but of the human spirit
that refuses again and again to succumb to

377
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:25,715
history's horrors.

378
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:26,965
(APPLAUSE)

379
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:41,834
Facing me right up there in the gallery, overlooking
all of us in this (inaudible) chamber is the

380
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,334
image of Moses.

381
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:48,535
Moses led our people from slavery to the gates
of the Promised Land.

382
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:54,514
NETANYAHU: And before the people of Israel
entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us

383
00:39:54,514 --> 00:39:59,594
a message that has steeled our resolve for
thousands of years.

384
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:10,794
I leave you with his message today, (SPEAKING
IN HEBREW), "Be strong and resolute, neither

385
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:13,094
fear nor dread them."

386
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:19,904
My friends, may Israel and America always
stand together, strong and resolute.

387
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:23,804
May we neither fear nor dread the challenges
ahead.

388
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:28,114
May we face the future with confidence, strength
and hope.

389
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:41,234
May God bless the state of Israel and may
God bless the United States of America.

390
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:45,425
(APPLAUSE)

391
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:53,804
Thank you.

392
00:40:53,804 --> 00:41:10,564
Thank you very much.

393
00:41:10,564 --> 00:41:23,144
Thank you all.

394
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:31,524
You're wonderful.

395
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:44,094
Thank you, America.

396
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:52,474
Thank you.

397
00:41:52,474 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.
