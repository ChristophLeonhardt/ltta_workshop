51
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,810
travel travel all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place and I</font>

52
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,940
really did get to see a lot this year's

53
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,880
so awesome and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a few things</font>

54
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,320
that I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to speak into the</font>

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,030
ether like I said I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big on</font>

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,120
resolutions per se but there are some

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,780
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I I just want to just speak</font>

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak it into the ether sometimes</font>

59
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,400
if you just speak it out you know it

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,209
just happens more financial stability

61
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:08,209
please um this year I became a lot more

62
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,570
financially stable which really cool so

63
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,130
much so that it was like I could be a

64
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,110
bit bougie when I wanted to be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

65
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,000
will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this i will say money does not</font>

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,620
buy happiness it does not but man does

67
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,370
it make your life easier having the

68
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,720
financial stability that I've had in

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,299
2015 has made life a lot easier so I

70
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,609
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue that trend must</font>

71
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,919
speak that into the ether continue the

72
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,810
trend of financial stability one thing

73
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I would really love is for I would</font>

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,780
really love to diversify my income

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,880
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more most of my income from</font>

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,590
from my full comes from my full-time

77
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,209
work as a producer and I work with one

78
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,680
production company mainly I would love

79
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,530
it if almost half of my income came from

80
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,890
other things besides what I do full-time

81
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,660
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to speak into</font>

82
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,250
the ether which could probably tie into

83
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,410
the first and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to speak this</font>

84
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,610
something that y'all as my subscribers

85
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,350
people who watch my videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> have always</font>

86
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,260
said is that you like my voice fun fact

87
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,738
about me i used to do voiceover work I

88
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,450
used to voice online driver safety

89
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,940
courses so people that are sight

90
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,669
impaired and can't read the text on the

91
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">screen to do their online driver safety</font>

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,840
course of course is you could pay a

93
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,630
little extra and get a narrator going

94
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,280
through the whole thing and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

95
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,950
voiced those but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak into</font>

96
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,660
