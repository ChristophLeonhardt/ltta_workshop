so I know that they said there's 500,000 people here that's what they said two weeks ago and they maintained that it's gotta be more I mean it's not how many people are here my school polls will no longer be a statistic so what's awesome about this March is it's hopeful so yeah ninety-seven percent of Americans want universal background checks and we can't get our Congress to do it but you know what people aren't gonna shut up and the students aren't going to shut up I think tighter background checks would be great bonus talk banning would be fantastic I don't think anyone needs weapons like the ar-15 in their home you don't hunt with them no respectable hunter uses them they're not used for self-defense either you don't need a rifle like that for self-defense and the fact that children get their hands on the mentally ill ones and that they're being ignored like that and being put in a position where they can do that and hurt themselves along with so many other people it's heartbreaking I'm a special ed teacher and I can't even imagine having guns in our classrooms it's the worst idea anyone could possibly come up with I think it's mostly to sell guns and to instill fear in people but guns have no place in public schools whatsoever except on an armed police officer who's trained just that boy who just told his story about losing his twin brother I can't imagine losing my twin sister and I don't know just imagining something like that happening to my school to my friends to my family anywhere you just never know what could happen and it's because these laws aren't being enacted we need these laws to be enacted so that everyone is safe not just at schools anywhere we go we should never have to fear being shot by someone who accessed a gun who should not have had one in the first place we're here to represent our granddaughter is a union high school and we have a daughter a granddaughter who is also a university student and every day we think about this you know it just doesn't see it seems surreal politicians do need to listen to young people young people are the at the forefront of all movements in history why do you think that even if they were in movements when they were young they still can't fathom that the young people today were as right as they were then I think they don't want us to be right because they're scared they don't want to lose their power but they're gonna end up being wrong yeah if you think of all the movements in history that really made a difference ending apartheid the Freedom Riders a Vietnam protests it was young people and that really inspires me so I wanted to be here I just brought up in the 60s and 70s and my sister was pretty big for the mi APO W Bush that's all I really knew I lived in suburbia I was very comfortable and these kids are amazing I mean they're very well-spoken most of them you know who I've listened to and spoken to they know what's going on they're aware and they really have had enough understandably but you know so many times it seems like something happens and we are all big talk for a month three months six months a year and then it just goes away you know there's another crisis that occurs that becomes more important but what could be more important than like saving our children's lives and well NRA money for don't the donors that get the politicians re-elected apparently the blood money they receive exactly but I don't get it I don't understand it I can't I can't imagine how that can be your priority do you think that this at the heart of this issue is corruption because that's really what I think the Congress is corrupt on the variety of issues health care Wall Street Reform the climate change you know we're young and they're not doing anything to protect our future but do you think that this could spurn larger movements against corruption in other areas like the ones I just mentioned I definitely think so and I definitely hope so and I hope that this continues to spur more movements larger movements movements about not just gun violence but climate change and other and justices that our country is facing and I think that it's important that we continue to fight we continue to stand up and that we continue to speak up for what's right I think the movements will be be it health care be it housing there's are so many other issues that are out there that we have been sort of suffering in struggling with but I think now we our voices will be heard and I think I have to compliment the youth they're the ones who are stimulating the elderly if you will and let's say hey guys you need to do more than just you know sit and think about it you need to do something even at 200 years America is a relatively young country and we have a lot to learn from other places you know we're like the teenager in the crowd who you know thinks we know everything and we can't fail and we're failing and we're failing because you know since the 30s the depression the last World War two we've had a good financially speaking and so until it starts to affect and I'm gonna say at white America it never becomes a problem you know and so now these things are affecting the people who matter and the people with money so hopefully there will be some change loudest boos Sarah Huckabee Sanders Mike Huckabee and any NRA member that's coming on the screen loudest Cheers actually sorry Trump just got the loudest boom I think it's because they don't really know what it feels like because you know their kids probably go to public schools private you mean private private school so they don't really experience the things that you know us that go to public schools experience but and Barron Trump you know he's got his Secret Service Trump doesn't have to worry about it himself so why would he worry about anyone else which I think it's ridiculous can you tell me what your sign says get bun no gun not guns I just try to get a rhyme ball so funny but off the serious because I feel like like um ever since Trump has begun presidents there been more like gun shootings and the reason why I'm here at this March is to try to get to show the government that they should try that they should ban guns and make it official law to hear the activism and hear the students talking about voting because that's what's important and it's really great to hear them saying we will vote you out because if we don't change our political climate we will continue to spiral down this path we want justice we want fairness we don't we won't freedom that violence against the innocent person is a crime against humanity it could be a policeman in a Sacramento it could be a drone strike in Yemen it could be what took place there in parkland in a new town it could be what happens and to me off too often in Barrios and reservations we're against violence and militarism in all of its forms you
