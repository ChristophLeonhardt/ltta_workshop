1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
I think about who they could have been
and what they would have been like and

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,760
so yeah those were our future children
future children that are now gone

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,170
Kate plants and the others we spoke with
stored their frozen eggs and embryos at

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,970
University Hospitals in Cleveland
so you trusted that your your eggs your

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,869
embryos would be safe at the hospital
here yeah we've learned yeah you never

6
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,410
imagined this would happen no the eggs
and embryos were stored in a freezer

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,940
tank at University Hospitals which was
equipped with a remote alarm system that

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,620
should have alerted an employee to any
temperature change but the hospital says

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,230
the alarm was off so an alert was never
issued and the lab wasn't staffed

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,969
Saturday night so the temperature in the
tank continued to rise causing the

11
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,690
embryos to thaw we take full
responsibility for what has happened we

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,370
are very sorry that this happened
this is a catastrophic event for

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,109
patients problems filling the tank with
liquid nitrogen may have thrown off the

14
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,470
temperature University Hospital says at
least 4,000 eggs and embryos were lost

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,930
impacting 950 patients what did you lose
that day I lost my reason for being

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,930
alive really starting a family was
really kind of all I had as far as a

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,640
purpose now I'm never gonna know what
those babies they're gonna grow up to be

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,150
Thanks that's what I lost it's just like
the hope for my future and not knowing

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,930
like if I'm going to build and now have
kids to preserve the opportunity to have

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,700
a child attorney Jack Lance kroner is
suing University Hospitals on behalf of

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,020
about 180 families he represents an
investigation for the Centers for

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,850
Medicare and Medicaid Services found
that the very same storage tank

23
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,470
experienced a malfunction in the filling
mechanism and remote alarm system back

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,960
in January the tanks manufacturer denies
it's equipment malfunctioned the

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,549
hospital then neglected to take the
necessary steps to repair the concerns

26
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,450
that were raised months before this
incident ever occurred nor did they make

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,790
your clients their patients aware this
they made no disclosure to the clients

28
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,340
who had eggs and embryos stored at this
facility that they were having problems

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,590
and an a a pattern of malfunctions if
the hospital has already admitted wrong

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,580
doing why the lawsuit well I think our
clients want answers and they really

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,790
haven't gotten them yet we're suing for
what the law allows which is for

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,590
compensation for our clients for what
they've lost and also ideally to have

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,180
changes made that will allow these
systems to be safer University Hospitals

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,110
declined our request for an interview
citing pending litigation but in an

35
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,730
e-mail they told us that patients are
their first priority and they're working

36
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,650
to improve operations at the fertility
clinic still that won't help these

37
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,930
families they lost all their eggs and
embryos and can hardly think about the

38
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,239
painful process of going through IVF
again for some that's not even an option

39
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,829
so that was our only chance to have
biological kids because both of my

40
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:02,549
cancers were estrogen based and so to
pump me with more hormones to get more

41
00:03:02,549 --> 00:00:00,000
embryos is out of the question
