the US intelligence community has struck a deal with Amazon for the company to provide a data storage the online giant's developed a special project tailored exactly to the government's knees Jacqueline fuga explains the line between political business and commercial business is getting thinner by the day especially when it comes to internet and tech giants let's start with Amazon which has just announced a new deal to provide a tailored cloud service to the US intelligence community this secret region yes that's really it's name comes on top of Amazon's existing six hundred million dollar contract with the CIA and other agencies and the CIA's chief information officer couldn't be more excited about the partnership now we named it commercial cloud services our c2s for a reason it's because we want to be like commercial we don't wanna be like government we wanted the Best of Breed that's why we partner with Amazon and they aren't alone just last month Microsoft announced a similar partnership over a dedicated cloud for the US government and their partners Microsoft is partnering with the US government in the journey to the cloud providing both infrastructure and platform offerings to enable digital transformation meanwhile a treasure trove of connections were uncovered between US politics and Internet heavyweights after last year's presidential election in which some of them seemed to have sided with Hillary Clinton now take Google Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta had his emails hacked and published at the end of 2016 they contained several references to Eric Schmidt the executive chairman of alphabet Google's parent company and Schmidt seemed eager to help I met with Eric Schmidt tonight he's ready to fund advisor recruit Talent etc clearly wants to be had outside adviser but didn't seem like he wanted to push others out one of Clinton's digital advisors noted that Schmidt had a team working on important products for the campaign and a memo which also mentioned that discreet conversations had been initiated with Google Facebook and Apple to understand their priorities when it came to the election and their priorities were quickly made obvious especially when it comes to Facebook there was a sense of deja vu when Facebook's chief operating officer was also revealed to be in communication with Podesta pressing her hope and willingness to assist Clinton in the race for the presidency I still want Hillary Clinton to win badly I'm still here to help us I can look forward to working with you to elect the first woman president of the United States with such an intricate web of partnerships between Internet giant's politicians and the government perhaps it's time to worry about our online freedoms getting tangled up in them it should be mentioned that Hillary Clinton's former campaign chair suggested some of the leaked emails could have been doctored professor piers Robinson gave us his take on the situation is something to worry about so notionally governments and business are supposed to function in a way they're independent of each other I think the reality is that there are overlapping interests and influence is exercised and this is a problem it's a problem for democracy those platforms then become extremely useful tools for governments to try to exercise influence and power and it is a real danger it's not a new form of collusion since that it's been there before historically with mainstream corporate media and governments but it's certainly new in terms of the global reach and I think that if these corporations continue to be appear to be acting at the behest of the US government then there'll be an increasing drive for people to leave them go to other platforms which are under the same kind of influence
