hi I'm Malika be loud and you're in the stream you're joining us for our second show this week covering the South by Southwest festival in the US city of Austin Texas today we'll look at how musicians are expressing political activism through their work at a time when politics is becoming ever more polarized funny is at the festival and we'll be talking to three very different artists Jaime le they're Malika and hello from the Fairmont Hotel in downtown Austin so three independent musicians you're about to meet today one is the original 1970s a woman punk rocker one is a reverend activist with a voice like silk and one is a Canadian Colombian who is so eccentric she's like a musical tornado us and exactly what I mean when you meet her but one of the issues that they are addressing with their music stay tuned to find out my name is Sadiq Khan I am the mayor of London and I'm in the street South by Southwest is one of the key events of the year for both musicians and fans with more than a thousand acts playing over the course of the festival many artists are looking to get their music to a wider audience and the festival is a particularly enticing prospect for independent artists whose music has an activist message joining me on set Matt Cohen is arts editor at the Washington City Paper and has written widely about independent music joining us from Austin is Allis bag a musician and writer both based in Los Angeles California she's one of the true Punk originals her first band the bags were part of the influential la punk scene during the late 70s allison released her first solo album in 2016 and now she's at South by Southwest promote her second album blueprint here's a second a Hoban from that album and if I like Liga bopping to your own music set clear house and what does it mean was about Sakura hoppin means she thinks she's young and the whole reason I wrote that song was because I had gone to the 99-cent store where I do you know some of my accessories shopping and these two women just started staring about staring at me and talking about me and when I would look at them to see if they're really like looking at me they would turn the other way and pretend like they oh we're not talking about you and then as soon as I went the other way they'd be like follow me and like you know keep gossiping so I typically confront people who people who annoy me in any way but I didn't on that occasion I just got in when I thought I'm not gonna mess with it I'm just gonna go to my car put my stuff away and it was bothering me even as I was at the car I was thinking I'm Nickelback and let them have a piece of my mind and as I was walking back in I was some people came up to me and started talking to me and by the time I got back in the store the women were gone and I felt this frustration at not being able to talk back so I wrote a song about it instead so I feel like in your son I bent it and I feel like I had the last laugh your fan your fan tweets this is an stone and she says to us at AJ stream I think her message is well expressed in that phase pipe-bomb for the Soul she's smart and heartful and angry for all the right reasons it goes somewhere it isn't fetishistic it isn't fashion its power thank you yeah it's not really meant to be about fashion that video in particular is really about like being confident and feeling like owning your who you are and not worrying about how the other people interpret or try to you know fence you in Mecca that is a message that's resonated with so many people in line you have a lot of fans out there allies this is another one of them Morgan who says she was part of early punk wave that had huge momentum before Punk was sort of co-opted for money by the mainstream legendre lost some edge and focused until riot girl who we actually have a video coming from we've tweeted it out so you can see there take this person goes on to say and now more kids are getting into activism again though technology can distract make you jaded and make you give up Matt I wonder if you can comment on this tweet someone says that Punk lost its edge you followed Punk through the years I dare say you are a fan of punk as well I am a fan of fun did it lose its edge and is it coming back with activism I I think it's I think it's how you look at it I mean you know we're in DC I'm from DC there's been a the punk on the ground here is legendary and it's deeply tied with activism I I don't know that punk lost this edge so much is that a lot of people stop paying attention for a while and now they're paying attention again you know Alice and I'm sure you know you know as well as I do that you and your contemporaries your messages have never never you never stopped seeing your messages all these years and it's just people are paying attention now more than more than ever I mean yeah I feel like that's um that's true I also think that the focus wasn't on you know the diverse voices so you didn't get a lot of you got the wrong impression of what was happening with Punk a lot of times the the bands that got the attention were the ones that had the money behind them so even though there were always groups that were that had meaningful messages and different voices and were saying things in original ways they were not the ones that got the media attention I've seen people go see you what is it that they're coming to see it's not just about the sound of you know what are they seeing I think they're see first of all my songs are very personal but a lot of times the the personal is political so a lot of my songs are frustration for example we have a song frustration with the administration it's called reign of fear and so it comes out for me my most powerful tool for activism is my songwriting and my stage performance I feel like I try to connect with people tell them how I feel and hopefully if we have the same the same sentiments the same emotions the same frustrations we can feel supported and we can feel like there's a community behind you and there's a community behind me where we can create momentum create action and create real change in the world we just share this with you from the wax idols and they're a gothic band in San Fran on the west coast of the US and they describe you as an active and outspoken feminist for decades it hasn't always been in fashion with the music world as it is now so when you see people talking about feminism right now in a nutshell in a sentence what do you think about them I think it's great I think it's wonderful that that there's that feminism has become something that anybody can say they're feminists and not be misinterpreted when I was and I it's hard to say it in a nutshell but when I was younger I heard people talk about post feminism as though feminism had been like there was no need for it I think there's still a need for feminism and people realize now that it doesn't have to do with gender it has to do with equal rights Alice bag enjoy South by Southwest thank you for being here with us on the stream it's my pleasure so I'll wrap up this part of the conversation with this tweet from Gregg Velasquez who actually happens to be Alice's husband he writes it will help you to know her if you look at these two articles that he's linked us that are also on our Twitter feed he says Punk is action and not just music Matt I wanted to get your take on that bat-line Punk is action it's more than music has it always been that yeah I mean absolutely I think in a way what punk started as an action it was it was started as a as an anti-establishment movement and that definition has kind of evolved over the years and you know I think one thing that Alice said that that really strikes a chord and I 100% agree with is that a lot of the voices that kind of started Punk that we're being heard were the ones with a lot of money behind it and we're in this we're in this kind of period thanks to the internet that you know everyone who has a voice has an incredible microphone to have it heard and people were paying attention and so that sound cloud that's you to band camp that's all that and people are you know I think one of the the big things about this this kind of you know rise in activism in the past couple year are especially you know younger people are looking for artists to tell them how to feel and how to act and what's behavior here is one more artist that they are likely looking to joining us in Austin is Reverend of say yo-yo pho Seco he's a st. Louis born musician theologian and activist his music draws on a wide range of styles from Delta blues to Memphis soul the 2017 album in times like these covers issues ranging from black incarceration in the u.s. to gay lesbian and trans character of one of the songs on that album this is called resist and we so we describe the Rebbe as musician theologian activist Rev which order should they be in what's most important all of the above yeah right okay this is Reverend Seth Dolph he tweets in he's thinking about you a lot this morning and this was earlier on in March of this year and he describes he was a musician and organized an author pastor my dear friend I love that revs tweet each other and he was with us in Charlotte so you were in Charlottesville us as we gave grave injustice this week with the persecution at the Andre Harris I'm leaning heavily on Reverend SEC whose music and work again again do you feel that you're now backing vocal I cry well you know it's a lot less to me about vogue and a lot more about what this faithfulness look like so how do I attempt as an artist musician theologian attempt to keep track of the suffering of everyday people and confront the powerful in such a way that leads the world a little better place our dear friends in Charlottesville brother Seth whisper way sister smash would congregate Charlottesville our group of radical clergy who organized to confront and bring a different witness in the face of Nazis marching in the street wanted it right now deandre Harris who was beaten by Nazis is now being prosecuted by the Commonwealth Attorney for being beaten and so he goes on trial Friday and so that community is mobilizing right now you use the phrase radical clergy you describe you describe yourself as a radical clergy what does that even mean well actually I think that's one way to kind of distinguish those of us say from right-wing clergy I understand it as the gospel so the way I understand the gospel is the God was born into the world and born into the body of an unwed teenage Palestinian mother living under occupation to an unimportant people and that according to the Christian myth that Palestinian peasant defeated the Empire and so that's how I come to understand the Gaza I actually think that is the heart of the gospel and that everything else is heresy mija you share two comments we got live via YouTube this is the crow who says musicians can tap into something they cannot though create resistance they may give a voice to feelings and thoughts but they can't create that resistance another person explains maybe why that is general alpha on YouTube says I don't think musicians have the impact that they used to music has become so homogenized and that I'm wondering if some of that has to do with the money where the money for the label comes from and and independent artists not having access to that and so not being able to have as big of a platform so that's an interesting thing that I've written thought a lot about you know is independent artists this is their art this is their life they want to get paid and a lot of times getting paid means kind of getting paid by the systems that you know a lot of times they're speaking out against you know I think of like a band like downtown boys that is a very political outspoken terrific punk rock band from Providence Rhode Island and you know they played Coachella last year and there is kind of a little bit of the controversy a lot of the money behind Coachella comes from you know money that they are kind of against well they kind of took took a proactive stance and said look we're doing this because these are this is our lives we have to get paid the word using the stage to spread our message so you know in a way it's it's kind of what these independent artists taking the advantages they can to get their message out there and kind of reconciling with themselves if you know how that can make an impact to their to their audience that's listening right I mean I was watching you Reverend on video earlier on today and just seeing how you preach how you get the congregation really stoked up really riled up and I feel the activism of black lives matter coming out of your mouth on a on a daily basis there was a beautiful song that you sang I can't breathe we're not going to get you to do performance now but just can you just help share some of those lyrics with us Oh mid-south peace gathering those great organizers down there brother uh Brad Watkins and the folks there in Memphis it's a song written by the peace poets a beautiful group of poets out of New York and I goes um I can hear my neighbor crying saying I can't breathe now I'm in the struggle saying I can leave we're calling out the violence of the reese's police and we ain't gonna stop until the people are free and that was a song written by the piece poets beautiful yeah it's really beautiful yeah maybe cry on life too you don't have any tissue standing by right now anyway composure continued yeah and so I think I think in terms of the power of music I mean there's one thing to talk about who gets record contracts who plays the big conferences and that kind of thing but those of us who the vast majority of musicians are like myself we're going from gig to gig tor tor tor struggling to make ends meet but when we hit the stage something happens to the stage on the stage our people are moved in such a way and that the relationship between musical performance and resistance is well formulated there is no civil rights movement without the voices of the freedom singers there there is no Martin Luther King without Mahalia Jackson right there's no Malcolm X without the jazz musicians who he loved deeply and so there's an interplay between that and then that the artists are only integrity is our commitment to our craft and that I am deeply hopeful well I see not only in terms of music but in terms of cultural production as it relates to painting sculpture there's an entire Renaissance and I think we're gonna be alright that it when I come up from tradition that when we could do nothing else we sing a song and I think we can sing and organize our way out you should come and hang out with us at the stream office you can seem to rust ringtone times of trouble and tribulation full time job their reverence sake oh thank you so much for being at the stream at Southwest enjoy the rest of your time in Austin Texas thank you and I am a big fan and and we are to love you thank you very much stay with us thank you so much Mallika members of our audience are to read and Femi this is Seth he says the Blues are rooted in naming the hard things crying out not hiding from what hurts most in life injustice and pain at home and in the world truly good news cannot be felt and known without first naming the problems I'll read another one from culture fix because they're also big fans and they're at South by as well they write in we often think of arts driven activism as something for the youth but the Reverend speaks to the older generation and provides them an access point to youth lead movements it can be the start of intergenerational work and they end with this saying what the Reverend does is activate religion it's thoughts of prayers plus action so our third and final guest today is Lido Hemi anta a Colombian board artists residing in Toronto she mixes Colombian indigenous music with avant-garde electronica and cutting-edge pop her 2016 album lapa paisa won the 2017 Polaris Music Prize one of the most coveted Music Awards in Canada Monday night she performed at South by Southwest this song is la cabeza dad I went to see leader last night video is here right now that was some concert when you take people into that concert space what do you want to warn them about is going to happen to them I don't like to give them any warning uh-huh I just want people to feel free and I want people to express themselves and I want to be a vessel of love and happiness and resistance so it's a good opportunity for for a new audience when they see me for the first time because you know like hello Here I am and you can't really tell what's gonna happen there's some a lot of people that would be in the audience and that have a general idea but I like and I take pride in my show being being different and unique every time so sometimes I don't even know what's gonna happen so yeah it's exciting let me share this with you this is from Gina Virgil and she says that Lido is originally from Bakula Colombia where my parents come from that's Gina's parents I've always found her lyrics to denote strength and wisdom of women however her track like opposite dad really resonated with me as my first boyfriend in college parents didn't let me date in high school was controlling and abusive you share so much of your personal life right there on stage yeah why because sometimes as women it's hard for us to express part parts of of suffering and abuse because some of us are wired to think it is our fault and and we keep making excuses sometimes that benefit our abusers so I know that every time that I express or talk about my past and things that were not as happy it just connects people to me more and I connect to my audience more and then it helps other women to also speak up when when when faced in these situations and it's also nice to know be reminded that you don't need to stay in an abusive relationship that you don't need to to suffer because you know in in in in patriarchy we just don't have the upper hand so I know that I give a little bit of strength and awareness and love to people so that they can be braver and and and feel more empowered Maleeha we got this comment from someone name is Muhammad she's a musician out of London and she says Nina Simone famously said an artist duty is to reflect the times my art and my activism are intertwined art is activism activism is changed mountain we see all of the artists that we've talked to today this seems to resonate do you do you think that that's true of more and more artists especially younger ones who are entering this business with songs that are trying to change things yeah I mean absolutely I mean I think music and art they're you know they're interchange because making art and music is a is a political act I mean it is it is doing something that is against the grain that is against kind of what's going on so you know especially now with what with what's going on in the world I mean I think young artists and artists in general IR have more to say than any than ever before and they're trying to get their message up there and you know it it it matters and we're listening for me me we have DJ cello here just to end the show with combined with banging beats her only live production of proficiency in production technology she is bridging the gap between the worlds and traditions in a way that touches and moves young people deeply again kudos for you but you thought another six shows to do so out of those six shows do you do you work out okay I'm going to do this in this one I'm missing this one touch the people do you come with an agenda no there's no agenda I guess the one organized part is our songs right we we're her songs a thousand times so that whenever I get to the stage I decide what we're gonna perform do you know what you're playing next you've got six gigs to remember where will people see you next - they're here this week I think the next one is the Tom's
