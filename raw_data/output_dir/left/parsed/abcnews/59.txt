>> I'M GOING TO START WITH OUR 
SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT.
PIERRE, GIVE US WHAT YOU KNOW 
ABOUT THESE FILINGS TODAY.
>> NUMBER ONE, MANAFORT, AS YOU 
SAID, CHARGES WITH 12 COUNTS OF 
MONEY LAUNDERING AND ACTING AS 
AN AGENT FOR A FOREIGN ENTITY.
YOU SAW THE ATTORNEY PUSH BACK 
HARD AGAINST THAT, SAYING THOSE 
TYPE OF CHARGES ARE RARE.
THAT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE 
CONVICTION HE CAN CITE.
ALSO, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS 
CHARGE AGAINST PAPADOPOULOS, THE
NOTION THAT A FORMER ADVISER TO 
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD TIES TO A
LONDON-BASED PROFESSOR WITH 
LINKS, ACCORDING TO THE FBI, TO 
THE KREMLIN.
HE APPARENTLY TOLD THE FBI THAT 
THIS PERSON WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT 
WHEN HE KNEW OTHERWISE.
ON THE DAY AFTER THAT INTERVIEW 
WITH THE FBI, HE ERASED A 
FACEBOOK PAGE WHICH HAD DETAILS 
ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP, AND THE
KEY HERE IS THAT HE CLAIMED THAT
THESE PEOPLE WHO HAD TIES TO THE
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAD DIRT OR 
NEGATIVE INFORMATION ON HILLARY 
CLINTON, GEORGE.
>> OKAY, PIERRE, THANKS VERY 
MUCH.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR 
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 
JONATHAN KARL.
WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A WHITE 
HOUSE RESPONSE FROM SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS TO THESE 
INDICTMENTS TODAY, THE 
INDICTMENT TODAY, AND THE PLEA 
AGREEMENT FROM GEORGE P
PAPAD
PAPADOPOULOS, DISMISSING IT ALL.
>> DISMISSING HIM AS SOMEBODY 
WHO WAS SIMPLY A VOLUNTEER, A 
LOW-LEVEL VOLUNTEER WITH THE 
CAMPAIGN, AND DISMISSING THE 
CHARGES AGAINST MANAFORT AS 
BEING UNRELATED, COMPLETELY 
UNRELATED TO THE CAMPAIGN.
BUT GEORGE, LET ME TELL YOU, THE
COMBINATION OF THESE ACTS BY THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL ON THE ONE HAND,
AN INDICTMENT OF PAUL MANAFORT, 
WHO WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
CAMPAIGN AND HIS DEPUTY, RICK 
GATES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, AN INDICTMENT
OF A MUCH LOWER LEVEL PERSON, 
BUT ON POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE 
SERIOUS ACTIONS, WHICH GET RIGHT
TO THE HEART OF WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE WERE EFFORTS BY THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN TO COLLUDE WITH THE 
RUSSIANS TO GET DIRT ON HILLARY 
CLINTON.
THIS IS A DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> I WANT TO BRING IN BRIAN 
ROSS, OUR CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE P 
VOLUNTEER, BUT IN A MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN MARCH OF 2016
AT THE MAYFLOWER HOTEL, AND ONE 
OF THE THINGS WE SEE THERE IN 
THE PLEA AGREEMENT AND THE 
ADMISSION FROM GEORGE 
PAPADOPOULOS IS HE WAS TRYING TO
WORK WITH RUSSIANS TO GET DIRT 
ON HILLARY CLINTON OVER A PERIOD
OF SEVERAL MONTHS.
>> ABSOLUTE RE.
THESE ARE FACTS, NOT 
ALLEGATIONS.
FACTS HE CONFIRMS AND IN FACT HE
WAS TOLD AT THE END OF APRIL, 
MONTHS BEFORE IT BECAME PUBLIC, 
THAT THE KREMLIN HAD DIRT ON 
HILLARY CLINTON, THOUSANDS OF 
HER E-MAILS.
THAT'S AT A TIME HE WAS ALREADY 
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, GEORGE.
AND HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY SENIOR 
OFFICIALS FOUR OF THEM ARE 
NAMED, ENCOURAGED.
ONE SAID GREAT JOB, KEEP IT UP.
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO TOMAS COW
AND TRY TO SET UP A MEETING WITH
PUTIN THAT DID NOT TAKE PLACE.
>> DAN ABRAMS ALSO HERE.
YOU HAVE THE INDICTMENTS OF 
MANAFORT AND GATES.
WE KNOW THAT GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS
WAS ACTUALLY ARRESTED THREE 
MONTHS AGO, HAS BEEN A 
COOPERATING WITNESS FOR SOME 
TIME.
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.
>> THE QUESTION BECOMES, WHAT HE
HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE THREE 
MONTHS.
IT HASN'T LEAKED THAT HE'S BEEN 
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
THOSE THREE MONTHS.
HAS HE BEEN WEARING A WIRE AND 
GETTING STATEMENTS FROM OTHER 
POTENTIAL WITNESSES?
I MEAN, MANAFORT, THEY CAN MAKE 
A FAIR ARGUMENT THAT MANAFORT'S 
CONNECTION TO THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN, MANAFORT INDICTMENT'S 
CONNECTION TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
IS WEAK AT THIS POINT.
WHEN IT COMES TO PAPADOPOULOS, 
IT'S A MUCH HARDER, IN FACT, AN 
IMPOSSIBLE ARGUMENT TO MAKE 
BECAUSE THE WHOLE STATEMENT OF 
FACTS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT HE WAS 
DOING WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON THE
CAMPAIGN, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, 
WHAT THE CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS WERE
SAYING BACK TO HIM.
SO EVEN IF THEY SAY, IT'S A 
MINOR PLAYER, HE WAS A MINOR 
PLAYER, JUST WENT TO ONE 
MEETING.
THAT'S FINE, BUT IF YOU HAVE HIM
SAYING THINGS TO CAMPAIGN 
OFFICIALS WHO THEY KNOW EITHER 
VIA E-MAILS OR STATEMENTS WERE 
RESPONDING TO HIM, THAT'S WHERE 
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL DANGER 
FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
>> JOHN CARL, SOME OF THOSE 
CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS LIKELY TO 
STILL BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE DON'T KNOW ALL THEIR 
IDENTITIES RIGHT NOW.
LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK.
WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT
AND HIS TEAM FOR SEVERAL MONTHS,
FIRST THAT THERE WERE NO 
CONTACTS AT ALL WITH THE 
RUSSIANS DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
WE HEARD THERE WAS ALSO NO 
COLLUSION, COOPERATING IN ORDER 
TO GET DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON.
NOW YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO WAS IN 
THE CAMPAIGN ADMITTING THAT IS 
TRUE.
>> EXACTLY.
A LOW-LEVEL PERSON, TRUE, 
GEORGE, BUT SOMEBODY THAT WE SAW
AT A MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP 
AND WHO AT THAT MEETING TOLD THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT HE RAISED 
THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE HAD 
CONNECTIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS 
AND COULD BE HELPFUL IN THAT 
CONTEXT.
CERTAINLY CONCERNING.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE HAVE HEARD ADAMANT DE
DENIALSERING BUT THOSE DENIALS 
HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME.
IN THE BEGINNING, THE DENIALS WE
ASKED, MY COLLEAGUE A FEW DAYS 
BEFORE THE INAUGURATION OF 
DONALD TRUMP ASKED THE 
PRESIDENT-ELECT THEN DIRECTLY IF
THERE WERE ANY CONTACTS 
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIANS.
AND THERE WAS A POINT BLANK 
DENIAL.
I ASKED IT AGAIN A FEW WEEKS 
INTO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.
GOT AN ADAMANT DENIAL FROM THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HE HAD ANY 
CONTACTS, BUT THEY HAVE NO 
LONGER BEEN ADAMANT DENIALS THAT
ANYONE ON THE CAMPAIGN HAD 
CONTACTS.
>> JOHN, WHEN YOU WERE AT THE 
BRIEFING TODAY, YOU TALKED TO 
SARAH SANDERS, SAID THERE WERE 
NO PLANS AT THIS TIME TO FIRE 
ROBERT MUELLER, NO TALK OF 
PARDONS.
>> SHE SAID THERE WERE NO PLANS 
AND NO INTENTION TO FIRE ROBERT 
MUELLER.
SHE ALSO SAID, GEORGE, THAT SHE 
EXPECTS THAT THIS WILL BE IN THE
WRAPPING UP PHASE, THAT MUELLER 
IS ALMOST DONE.
SO TO ME, IT RAISED THE QUESTION
OF NO PLANS OR INTENTIONS.
THEY THINK MUELLER IS CLOSE TO 
DONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GET THAT
INDICATION.
AND THE QUESTION IS, IF 
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION IS IN 
MORE OF A LONG-TERM PROJECT 
HERE, DOES THE PRESIDENT 
RECONSIDER HIS LACK OF INTENTION
OR LACK OF PLANS TO FIRE HIM?
>> PIERRE THOMAS, THIS SEEMS 
MUCH MORE LIKE A STRONG OPENING 
ONE-TWO PUNCH FROM ROBERT 
MUELLER.
>> YOU'RE SEEING MUELLER BE 
EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE, GOING 
AFTER A MAJOR FIGURE IN THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
ALSO UNVEILING THIS CASE AGAINST
SOMEONE WHO HAD WORKED ON THE 
CAMPAIGN, WHO BY HIS OWN 
ADMISSION WAS ACTIVELY SEEKING 
TO WORK WITH OFFICIALS HE 
THOUGHT HAD TIES TO THE RUSSIAN 
GOVERNMENT.
AND WHO HAD NEGATIVE INFORMATION
ON HILLARY CLINTON.
>> AND DAN ABRAMS, MUELLER ALSO 
SENDING A STRONG SIGNAL TO 
ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT BE COMING 
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
LET'S BE CLEAR.
IT'S NOT THAT MUELLER MIGHT NOT 
BE DONE.
MUELLER ISN'T DONE.
HE'S NOT CLOSE TO BEING DONE.
THAT WE KNOW THAT, JUST FROM THE
PAPADOPOULOS PLEA AGREEMENT.
HE SPECIFICALLY IS SAYING THIS 
IS A GUY WHO WAS POTENTIALLY 
INTERFERING WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION.
WE HAVE SIGNED A DEAL WITH HIM 
SO WE CAN CONTINUE THAT 
INVESTIGATION.
SO THE NOTION THAT THIS IS 
ALMOST OVER IS PURELY WISHFUL 
THINKING.
>> MAJOR NEWS TODAY FROM 
WASHINGTON.
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER 
HAS SENT DOWN TWO INDICTMENTS, 
SENT DOWN TWO INDICTMENTS OF 
PAUL MANAFORT AND RICK GATES.
FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, FORMER 
DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER OF THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
ALSO REACHES A PLEA AGREEMENT 
WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS,
