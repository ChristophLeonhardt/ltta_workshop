11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,670
the team from Sports Illustrated about a

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,670
year ago and they were casting for this

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,320
up-and-coming issue that's about to come

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,809
out that day I got a call that I was

15
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:47,090
going to be shooting in two weeks in

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,340

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,070
when I was 15 started doing Fashion Week

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,810
traveled the world and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of did</font>

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,540
the whole fashion thing so it's nice to

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,130
transition into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sexy swimsuit world</font>

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,710
I would say the difference between the

swimsuit word on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fashion world is</font>

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,939
fashions a little more it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

29
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:22,430
type of girl you're bringing it's a

30
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more different characters and I</font>

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,100
think when you're shooting for Sports

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,240
Illustrated you really get to be

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself and you know it's kind of rare</font>

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,030
these days everyone's very very relaxed

35
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,799
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crew they're all just cool nice</font>

36
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">people but I was a little nervous and so</font>

37
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time shooting for them</font>

38
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,909
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the first few shots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

39
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,250
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh what do i do and then i slowly</font>

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,079
just felt comfortable and started to

41
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,479
relax and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier once I did</font>

42
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,540
that it's an honor to be headed to that

43
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,549
list with all those amazing top models

44
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,350
that I've always admired because I love

45
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,240
fashion and I've looked at Sports

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,040
Illustrated since I was a little girl so

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,980
it's

48
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,070
kind of kind of seems fake right now to

49
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,830
me that it's happening but I mean it's

50
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,050
such an honor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a part of that crowd</font>

51
00:02:07,050 --> 00:00:00,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> girls</font>
