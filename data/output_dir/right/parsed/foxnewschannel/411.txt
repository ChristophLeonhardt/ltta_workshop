>> I'M USING MY OWN MONEY.
I'M NOT USING THE LOBBYISTS OR
DONORS.
I DON'T CARE.
I'M REALLY RICH.
>> Shepard: WE'RE WATCHING THE
FALLOUT NOW FROM A BOMB SHELL
"NEW YORK TIMES" INVESTIGATION
THAT SPANS SOME 18 MONTHS.
THE TIMES UNCOVERED A TRAIL OF
DOCUMENTS THAT INDICATES
PRESIDENT TRUMP ENGAGED IN
DUBIOUS TAX SCHEMES AND
COMMITTED OUTRIGHT FRAUD.
AS HE BUILT HIS REPORTED FORTUNE
AND BUSINESS EMPIRE.
AFTER THE EXPOSE HIT THE TIMES
WEBSITE ABOUT THIS TIME
YESTERDAY, TAX OFFICIALS IN
NEW YORK STATE ANNOUNCED THEY'RE
LOOKING INTO THE CLAIMS AND THEY
COULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTERS
POURED OVER DOCUMENTS THAT
STRETCH BACK FOR DECADES.
THEY REPORT THEY WENT THROUGH
MORE THAN 100,000 PAGES OF BANK
STATEMENTS, TAX RETURNS, AUDITS,
INVOICES, LEDGERS AND OTHER
FINANCIAL RECORDS AND FOUND THE
PRESIDENT, HIS FATHER AND FAMILY
MEMBERS USED DECEPTION TO AVOID
PAYING MILLIONS IN DOLLARS.
THE ARTICLE IS EXHAUSTIVE.
SO LET'S LOOK AT SEVERAL OF THE
KEY FINDINGS.
FIRST, THAT THE PRESIDENT'S
FATHER, THE NEW YORK CITY REAL
ESTATE MOGUL FRED TRUMP USED A
SHAM COMPANY TO FUNNEL TAX-FREE
MONEY TO HIS CHILDREN.
THE TIMES REPORTS THAT TRUMP
MANIPULATED THE VALUE OF THEIR
APARTMENT BUILDING CLAIMING THEY
WERE WORTH MILLIONS LESS THAN
FAIR VALUE.
SO THEY PAID A FRACTION OF THE
TAXES DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE TIMES INVESTIGATION ALSO
EXPOSING AS UNTRUE, PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S OFT REPEATED CLAIM THAT
HE'S A SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE.
>> IT'S NOT BEEN EASY FOR ME.
I STARTED IN BROOKLYN.
ME FATHER GAVE ME A SMALL LOAN
OF A MILLION DOLLARS.
I CAME TO MANHATTAN AND I HAD TO
PAY HIM BACK AND PAY HIM BACK
WITH INTEREST.
>> Shepard: THE TIMES REPORTS
THAT SMALL MILLION DOLLAR LOAN
FROM HIS DAD WAS MORE THAN $60
MILLION.
WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION,
THE PAPER FOUND PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS GOTTEN MORE THAN $400
MILLION FROM HIS FATHER'S REAL
ESTATE EMPIRE OVER THE YEAR.
ADDITIONALLY, "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" REPORTS THAT WHEN TRUMP
WAS BUT A TODDLER, HE WAS
ALREADY MAKING $200,000 A YEAR.
IT REVEALS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S FATHER CAME TO THE
RESCUE SEVERAL TIMES TO SAVE HIS
SON'S FAILING BUSINESSES.
SOMETIMES USING QUESTIONABLE AND
POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL LOANS TO
KEEP THEM AFLOAT.
IN ONE EXAMPLE, THE TIMES
REPORTS THAT THE ELDER TRUMP
SENT A TRUSTED BOOKKEEPER TO BUY
$3.5 MILLION IN CHIPS IN HIS
SON'S CASINOS WHEN IT WAS GOING
UNDER OR DEFAULTING ON A LOAN
PAYMENT IN 1990 AND NEVER PLAYED
THE CHIPS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CALLING THE
TIMES PIECE A VERY OLD, BORING
HIT PIECE AND HERE'S WHAT THE
WHITE HOUSE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT
TODAY.
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS
INACCURATE ABOUT THAT STORY, IF
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT IS
ACTUALLY INACCURATE ABOUT IT?
>> TOTALLY FALSE ATTACK BASED ON
AN OLD RECYCLED NEWS STORY.
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH VERY
LINE OF VERY BORING 14,000 WORD
STORY.
>> THE PRESIDENT'S LATER SAID
THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND TAX
EVASION ARE 100% FALSE AND
HIGHLY DEFAMATORY.
THE AUTHORS OF THE TIMES REPORT
ARE SUZANNE CRAIG, RUSS BUTNER
AND DAVID BARSTOW.
BARSTOW IS HERE WITH US.
DAVID JOINED THE TIMES IN 1999,
THEN ITS INVESTIGATIVE UNIT IN
2002.
HE'S A RECIPIENT OF THREE POLK
AWARDS, THE DUPONT SILVER AWARD,
TWO CIGNA DELTA KI AWARDS, A PEA
BODY AWARD AND A THREE-TIME
WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE.
DAVID, NICE OF YOU TO COME.
>> IT'S A LITTLE MUCH.
>> THEY'RE ON YOUR BIO.
HOW DID THIS START?
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IT STARTED
WITH A COUPLE DOCUMENTS ON A
COLLEAGUE'S DESK.
>> MY COLLEAGUE, SUE CRAIG WENT
TO HER DESK.
THERE WAS AN ENVELOPE.
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PAGES
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 1995 TAX
RETURN.
WE REPORTED ON THOSE DOCUMENTS
IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION.
BUT IT WAS INFORMATION THAT WAS
KIND OF STUNNING TO US THAT
WITHIN THOSE DOCUMENTS, WHICH
WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT IN 1995
SHOWED THAT HE HAD LOST OVER
$900 MILLION.
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT
MADE US REALIZE.
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP THAN
DONALD TRUMP CANDIDATE TRUMP IN
HIS HISTORY WITH MONEY.
SO THAT WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING
OF US DECIDING, LET'S DIG
DEEPER.
LET'S TRY TO PULL BACK AS MANY
LAYERS OF THIS ONION AS WE CAN.
>> Shepard: AT ONE POINT DURING
THE ARTICLE, YOU WRITE, "OVER
TIME AS DONALD TRUMP CAREENED
FROM ONE FINANCIAL DISASTER TO
THE NEXT, HIS FATHER FOUND WAYS
TO GIVE HIM MORE MONEY.
EVEN IN 1990, MR. TRUMP TRIED TO
HAVE HIS FATHER'S WILL REWRITTEN
IN A WAY THAT FRED TRUMP ALARMED
AND ANGERED AND COULD RESULT IN
HIS EMPIRE TO BE USED TO BAIL
OUT HIS SON'S FAILING
BUSINESSES."
>> THAT WAS A HUGE SURPRISING
FIND FOR US.
WAS WHAT WE WERE SEEING IS THAT
FRED TRUMP THROUGH, YOU KNOW,
STARTING WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS 3
YEARS OLD AND MOVING FORWARD HAD
BEEN ENDLESSLY CREATIVE IN
COMING UP WITH NEW WAYS TO GET
MONEY INTO DONALD TRUMP'S
POCKET.
HE DIDN'T PAY HIM TO BE LIKE ON
HIS PAYROLL, BUT HE PAID HIM TO
BE HIS PURCHASING AGENT, A
CONSULTANT.
HE GAVE HIM THE LAUNDRY REVENUE
FROM THE BUILDINGS.
EVEN AFTER THIS INCREDIBLE
GENEROSITY FROM FRED TRUMP TO
DONALD TRUMP, THERE COMES THIS
MOMENT THAT WE DISCOVER IN OUR
REPORTING THAT THERE WAS ONE
LINE THAT WAS SORT OF TOO FAR
EVEN FOR FRED TRUMP.
IT WAS WHEN FRED TRUMP
DISCOVERED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD
HIRED LAWYERS TO REWRITE A
PORTION OF HIS WILL IN A WAY
THAT FRED TRUMP PERCEIVED COULD
PUT HIS ENTIRE EMPIRE AT RISK.
IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN DONALD TRUMP
SO MUCH CONTROL OVER THE EMPIRE
THAT FRED TRUMP BELIEVED IT
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO USE
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD BUILT FOR
70 YEARS TO BAIL OUT TRUMP'S OWN
FAILING BUSINESSES.
AT THAT POINT IN TIME, DONALD
TRUMP WAS IN BIG TROUBLE IN THE
CASINO INDUSTRY.
>> Shepard: THE TOTALITY OF THE
REPORT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, DONALD
TRUMP CITIZEN, WAS NOT AT ALL A
GREAT BUSINESS MAN, THAT HE
SQUANDERED MANY MILLIONS AND
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.
THAT HIS FATHER BAILED HIM OUT
AND THE NECESSARY TAXES WERE
NEVER PAID BECAUSE THEY FIDDLED
WITH THE NUMBERS.
>> AT ONE POINT, DONALD TRUMP
OWED HIS DAD $15 MILLION.
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS?
IF FRED TRUMP HAD SET, OKAY,
THAT DEBT IS FORGIVEN, DONALD
TRUMP WOULD HAVE OWED INCOME
TAXES ON CANCELLED DEBT.
INSTEAD, THEY FOUND THIS OTHER
MANEUVER, INVOLVED ONE OF
TRUMP'S BUILDINGS, TRUMP PALACE.
WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY EXCHANGED
THE DEBT THAT DONALD TRUMP OWED
HIS FATHER AND INSTEAD DONALD
TRUMP GAVE HIS DAD A PORTION OF
THE BUILDING, A FEW YEARS LATER,
FRED TRUMP SOLD THE PORTION BACK
TO DONALD, BUT THIS TIME FOR
$10,000.
IT'S EFFECTIVELY A $15 MILLION
GIFT IS WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO
WHEN YOU DID THE MATH.
>> Shepard: A GIFT WHICH NOBODY
PAID TAXES.
>> NOBODY PAID TAXES AND
UNREPORTED.
THIS PATTERN OVER AND OVER AGAIN
WHEN DONALD TRUMP GOT HIMSELF IN
TROUBLE OR WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS
TAKING ON SOME BIG NEW PROJECT.
WE CAN SEE IN THE TAX RETURNS
AND THE BANKING RECORDS THAT WE
OBTAINED THAT FRED TRUMP'S
FINANCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY AS THIS KIND OF
SAFETY NET UNDERNEATH TRUMP.
>> Shepard: HOW DID THE TIMES
FIND THIS AND THE IRS NEVER
FLAGGED IT?
>> I THINK IN PART IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE WAY THE IRS LOOKS AT
TAX RETURNS.
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR
YEAR.
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR
YEAR'S TRANSACTIONS.
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS A
MUCH BROADER PERIOD OF TIME.
WE ALSO WERE RECOGNIZING IN THE
REPORTING THAT WE'RE DOING AND
THE SOURCES WE'RE TALKING TO,
THE TRUMPS WERE PLAYING A LONG
GAME.
THEY HAD A WELL-THOUGHT OUT
STRATEGY OF HOW TO AVOID OR IN
SOME CASES EVADE HOW MUCH
AMOUNTS OF GIFT AND INHERITANCE
TAXES.
WHEN THE IRS WOULD LOOK AT IT,
THEY WOULD SAY YOU OWE US A
COUPLE MILLION MORE.
THE TRUMPS WOULD SAY GREAT,
THAT'S FINE.
BY PAYING A FULL MILLION MORE
HERE AND THERE, THEY GOT AWAY
WITH NOT PAYING HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS ON THE REAL ESTATE
ASSETS THAT FRED TRUMP WAS
TRANSFERRING TO HIS KIDS.
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THIS IS AN OLD TIRED BORING
STORY.
HIS LAWYERS SAY THERE'S NOTHING
TO IT.
IT'S A HIT PIECE BY THE "FAILING
"NEW YORK TIMES."
>> SO YOU CAN SEARCH EVERY STORY
EVER WRITTEN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP
AND EVERY BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT
DONALD TRUMP AND EVERY TV
INTERVIEW DONE BY DONALD TRUMP.
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ANY MENTION
ANYWHERE IN ANY OF THOSE THINGS
OF A LITTLE COMPANY CALLED ALL
COUNTY BUILDING SUPPLY AND
MAINTENANCE.
THIS IS THE COMPANY THAT THE
TRUMPS SET UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF
SYPHONING CASH OUT OF FRED
TRUMP'S EMPIRE WITHOUT PAYING
GIFT OR ESTATE TAXES.
SO THIS IS NOT ANNALD STORY.
THIS IS A VERY NEW STORY.
>> Shepard: AND THE REACTION
FROM THOSE IN NEW YORK STATE
HAVE SUGGESTED AN INVESTIGATION
MAY BEGIN.
GOT ANY NEW TAX DOCUMENTS?
THE WHOLE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR
THEM.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THIS STORY
TAUGHT ME AT LEAST, THE END
OF -- IN THE REPORTING FOR THE
STORY, WE PUT OUR HANDS ON ABOUT
200 TAX RETURNS FROM INSIDE THE
TRUMP FAMILY EMPIRE.
THERE'S MORE TAX RETURNS TO BE
GOTTEN.
WE'LL BE LOOKING.
