day 468 of the Trump administration we have breaking news that we're going to break down on several fronts for you tonight we'll catch you up on all of them we're going to begin with a stunning admission from Rudy Giuliani about that $130,000 hush money payment to the adult film star stormy Daniels this money was paid to miss Daniels you recall by Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen he used a household line of credit his own money to pay him you may recall that on Air Force one April 5 just a few weeks back the president told reporters on Air Force One he had no knowledge of the payment well appearing with sean hannity tonight here is what Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News just a short time ago that money was not campaign money sorry I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know it's not campaign money no campaign finance violation so they funneled it through the law firm funnel throw over him and the president repaid it the president repaid it Sean Hannity at that point paused and said I wasn't aware of that that will no doubt create a host of new legal problems for the president we'll have much more on that just ahead also tonight the seismic shake-up in president Trump's legal team on the Russia investigation Donald Trump has hired Emmett flood a veteran criminal defense attorney he was one of Bill Clinton's impeachment lawyers he also worked in the White House counsel's office during george w bush's second-term flood who is a partner at the DC law firm of williams and connolly will be part of the White House counsel's office and the point person for the administration's response to Special Counsel robert muller flood replaces ty cobb he's been in that position since July of last year he'll retire they say at the end of this month there are major legal and political implications that stem from this move say nothing of what Rudy Giuliani said tonight the switch was first reported by the New York Times Matt Apuzzo will join us in just a moment along with Michael Schmidt they write quote mr. flood is expected to take a more adversarial approach than mr. Cobb who voluntarily turned over White House documents to mr. Muller the addition of mr. flood was spearheaded by White House Counsel Don McGann mr. flood is seen as a possible eventual replacement for mr. McGann who has clashed privately with mr. Trump and whose departure has long been rumored our friends over the Washington Post have also been working this story their White House bureau chief Phil Rucker standing by to talk with us his colleagues have written tonight the legal team shake-up his quote putting the White House on war footing with federal prosecutors examining Russian interference in the 2016 campaign this signals a new phase said one senior Trump advisor who was granted anonymity to describe private conversations we are looking at all the options now nothing's off the table but the gloves the gloves rather may be coming off keep in mind this shift comes after reports on what the special counsel could potentially ask the President as well as the efforts now led by Rudy Giuliani to set up that interview here is what Giuliani said about the chances for an interview tonight if they're objective we can work something out if not then we have to shake hands and basically go into a litigation over do they have the power to subpoena and I think they lost that power right now the odds are he wouldn't be interviewed but I don't close my mind to it so this is a kind of negotiation that took place on live television tonight between Rudolph Giuliani and the special counsels office more on that later meanwhile the president continued to send out messages on Twitter assailing the entire Russia investigation quote there was no collusion capital C it was a hoax capital H and there is no obstruction of justice couple more capitals there that is a setup and trap witch-hunt the Muller team however interviewed another witness today former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo and this is interesting he spent three hours with investigators in the special counsel's office during an interview on CNN tonight where he has appeared as a political analyst Caputo's description of Muller's process was chilling the mall team knew more about what I did in 2016 than I knew myself and I think they know more about the Trump campaign than anyone that ever worked there I don't think they're convinced yet that there's no rush inclusion I'd say the Mulla Mulla team is spearfishing I think they believe they know where they're going they're not asking a wide range of questions so that just sets the table for you on a Wednesday night and with that let's bring in the members of our leadoff panel Nicole Wallace is here with us veteran of the bush White House and host of deadline White House at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time here on this very Network and in this very studio plus two Pulitzer Prize winning reporters the aforementioned Matt Apuzzo of the New York Times the aforementioned Philip Rucker White House bureau chief for The Washington Post welcome to you all we'll get through it Paul there is one of Paul Newman's better performances is in a movie called the verdict and he snaps at the great Irish judge played by Melo O'Shea and says your honor if you're gonna try my case for me try not to lose it day one of the new White House Council he perhaps was watching Fox tonight when Donald Trump's other lawyer Rudy Giuliani may have given away the store on this one aspect you know I was touch with Michael avenatti after the kid's head still attached to his body you know he plays a very calm cool and collected attorney on television but I think watching this Trump team boggles his mind in real time as well and I think the fact that Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani who were sort of brothers in arms' as you know campaign guys on the plane the fact that those two can't keep their stories straight it's it's not been two weeks and in those two weeks what Rudy was supposed to do was wrap up the mullet robe he's now really torpedoed the president's central legal argument in the stormy Daniels case which all of the great reporting that Matt and Phil have done suggests that that Donald Trump and the people around him in the white house and in his outside band of sort of misfit advisors are far more concerned their their legal concerns center far more around the the materials that were seized from Cohen's home and offices so Rudy potentially damaged the legal predicament that gives Donald Trump much more grief than the Moller Pro but you know we're going to talk about as well the control room is going to tell me when we have it ready we're working on a longer clip of the Rudy Giuliani the money has been repaid what's germane is what Giuliani goes on to say about Michael Cohen and the relationship between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump the retainer he gets from Donald Trump will we'll come back to that Phillip Rucker why don't you give us the overarching answer about the damage done tonight well the damage Brian is in two realms there's the legal damage which I'm not exactly qualified to talk about but it seems to be significant but there's also the political damage the revelation by Rudy Giuliani exposes the president and the White House press secretary to have been telling falsehoods to the American people they've not been truthful in saying that the president didn't know about this payment in fact he did according to Rudy Giuliani his lawyer that hundred thirty-five thousand dollar payment $130,000 payment rather raises a lot of questions was this some sort of arrangement that he had with other women how was this arrangement arrived at Rudy Giuliani and that Fox interview references a retainer that Michael Cohen had for this sort of work described this as part of their standard agreement sort of the way they did business so it just is a huge hole here I think for the reporting but also for the federal investigators to be digging into at this hour and in the days to come Matt I'm gonna throw you a nice high soft ball here by setting you up with this clip we have found it we've isolated it here again is the wording in question tonight from Rudolph Giuliani and then the following part which we meant to run earlier about the relationship between Trump and Cohen we'll talk to you on the other side having something to do with paying some stormy Daniels woman 130,000 I mean which is gonna turn out to be perfectly legal that money was not campaign money sorry I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know it's not campaign money no campaign finance violation so they funneled it through the law firm Sun Rosen offer him and the president repaid it oh I didn't know that he did yeah there's no campaign finance law zero but you know the president didn't know about this I believe that I know about the specifics of it as far as I know but he did know about the general arrangement I'm going to get the part on the air where he talks about my own relationship with Donald Trump if it takes me the better part of the next hour but we're gonna do it still that was illustrative Matt in part because you watch in real time Sean Hannity is trying to help him out there look so maybe I maybe I've spent too long in the swamp here but but I actually actually can can see somewhat the logic here to the way I want to hear this yeah right no stay with stay with me so so look if you operate under the theory that eventually we were all gonna figure this out right somebody was gonna figure this out and and blow the whole thing open I mean feels absolutely right that this does sort of put the the lie to the White House but you know what when has that really ever stopped anybody from saying something at the White House so if it's gonna come out framing it as there's no campaign finance violation and you know if we start hearing tomorrow this was this was an effort to protect his family or protect his privacy or whatever we started here framing it as this isn't a legal thing this is a personal thing stay out of my business stay out of my personal life then we're in sort of the Bill Clinton territory of what do we want a special counsel to be so while I'm sure this was not this is not the the rollout that they would teach you in public relations school it does sort of frame it does sort of frame it as we didn't break any laws here and you know call it call us on the lie tomorrow hey there I'm Chris Hayes from
