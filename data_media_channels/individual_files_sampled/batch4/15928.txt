oh it's July knife I'm Angela Vance and you're watching battleground hello and welcome back to battleground I'm answer-the Vance it's gonna be a great week we have so much to talk about I was away for about ten days I was in Israel we had a special rebel Israel trip that we took six of our on-air talent with us plus more than fifty of our most enthusiastic viewers who wanted to check out Israel for themselves Katie Hopkins was amongst our journalists she actually went into several West Bank areas in addition to the regular trip that's the 50 or so of us went on is very interesting if you want to see those videos you can see them all at rebel Israel calm well we're back and there's so much to talk about Canadian things to talk about American things to talk about I want to start with some amazing news from the United Kingdom Boris Johnson has resigned he's quite a character you'd recognize him immediately with his shock of platinum blonde hair he resigned over the UK Conservative Party's failure to take meaningful steps to give effect to brexit the attempt by Britain to extract itself from the European Union look at that Boris Johnson resigns it's incredible he's not the first conservative to resign that probably won't be the last it's a just another crisis for Teresa may the wobbly UK PM we'll talk about that in a little bit I just want to remind you what what we're doing here though what this super chat business is what a super chat does it refer to me being super chatty no it's a special a thing that YouTube made Google made as you can see on the right-hand side of your screen there there's the scrolling comments right real-time comments that's really fun and easy for folks who want to be super chatters though if you chip in five bucks or whatever ten bucks your comments is highlighted in a bold color and it is appended to the top of the super chat page for everyone to for an extended period of time so it's not just passing in the night and I do my best to read all the super chats as well so we do this everyday it's only one hour it's sort of light and not overly produced it's not like my 8:00 p.m. Eastern show and I mentioned Boris Johnson resigning which it's interesting we saw a couple days ago Nigel Faraj the great leader of you Kip who retired basically after winning the brexit election saying if brexit were not to be done properly he would have no alternative he said but to return to the battle the political battle he of course remains a member of the European Parliament but he said he would get back in and help fight for a second exit if necessary that ought to focus a few minds moon man ships in two bucks and said I'm at awe at the size of this lad absolute unit I'm not sure who you're talking about him you're talking about me I'll take it as a compliment so Boris Johnson I'm I'm excited that he's bolting because it shows that I mean Boris Johnson is nothing besides ambitious I happen to like the guy by the way but if he thinks the right move is to abandon Theresa main that means that he's done the thinking because he is pragmatic I mean I think he is principled a lot of people don't think so but the fact that he thinks it is to his advantage to quit tells me it will be safe for others to do so and you know what fair deal brexit was crystal clear the brits one out and here we are two year more than two years later and the Tories the party that claimed they would I mean they're the party that called the referendum they thought that wouldn't let the air out of the balloon well to their shock they lost the referendum and now they're half-heartedly negotiating an exit well bloody well liked said it's been two years remember brexit predated Donald Trump and Donald Trump has had five hundred days five hundred and thirty days whatever it is of executing his promises where's the British government to execute the promise to get out of Wrexham and yes it makes sense to do so in an orderly fashion but that's not what they're trying to do they're trying to slow walk it for the purpose of as we say in Canada ragging the puck work-to-rule as they would say they are doing it in the slowest possible manner and the lowest possible manner rather than saying we're out of here and and I think the British people have every right to feel like the Democratic wishes are being annulled by the remain that's the opposite of the leave that leave and remain the two sides by the elites the banking elites the globalist elites the open borders immigration elites good I'm glad that there's chaos for Theresa maybe because she has earned it let's take a few comments here by the way Hannah can you google size of this lad absolute unit because I know what that fellas talking about he's talking about a hotelier in the United Kingdom who happens to be a favorite of Queen Elizabeth so just type in that fellas comment I want to show people what he's referring to it's sort of funny I think he's referring to the fact that I'm a little bit fat but I want to show the original there it's actually a meme blurred picture Mike was asking you Kip well I'm a fan of you Kip I've been a fan of theirs since before the 2016 brexit referendum I've followed them with some consternation as they have deflated in the last few years I've followed the leadership race where anne-marie Waters was given the boot actually she was never imaged she wanted to be I've interviewed Gerard batten their new leader I rather like the fella we had an extended interview we mailed that to all of our UK viewers Chris Rubin Tories and labour are two cheeks of the same ass that's not a very friendly thing to say but I can understand why you would say it's Rita Lee and Tweedledum Tweedledum and tweedledumber I mean I think there is there are important moral distinctions between the British consumers and British Labour Party but on brexit both of them are slow-walking and aren't they and both of them I think are elites who don't care what the regular folks saying can you show that absolute unit there we go in all the size of this lad absolute unit I I think that the commenter was referring to it was claiming that I look like this for this fella runs one of the finest hotels and restaurants in the United Kingdom and he's one of the Queen's favorites so I think someone is implying that that's what I look like I'm not that bad folks I'm not that bad all right let's go back to the comments the new peasants revolt let's finish what Tyler started as a cop in fact I think we love most countries just on their governments look if if you don't like you kept that's fine but in a democracy their results ought to have meaning otherwise you want to talk about demoralization and disaffection from politics that was a clear message all the establishment all the money all the media all the banks all the fancy people all the pollsters were for remained leave was a populist nationalist reaction to the excesses of the European Union and open borders immigration and in many ways that mirrored Donald Trump all the experts said Trump had no chance of winning all the pollsters all the media all the banks all the expert all of Wall Street Wall Street was treilery Clinton if you can believe it and Trump won in fact Trump had his finger on the pulse you may recall he flew to the UK and supported brexit whereas Barack Obama flew to the UK and threatens brexit he said I don't know if you call this Barack Obama in the middle of the British brexit campaign said if you pull out of the European Union sure will negotiate a trade deal with you but you will go to the back of the queue and he said this by the way at the request we've recently learned of the remains so the remaining campaign literally asked a foreign leader to threaten Brits that he would harm them economically if they voted to leave well they voted to leave nonetheless so the same sort of bullying there the same sort of and and note the reaction to Donald Trump's win an attempt to deal agenda my said oh it was hacked oh it was rigged oh we need a recount all that BS they were trying to deal minimize the results of Donald Trump's election 2016 and in the UK since it wasn't a changing of the government right I mean Donald Trump won he just plain old one and he would he took over I mean there were some intransigent embedded Democrats there still are especially in the Justice Department the FBI who were not about to let Donald Trump actually de-facto take office but he took office indeed and it's been fairly successful that's the difference brexit the same attempt to deal Ajith my's it except brexit was an idea get out of the European Union it was not a party so there was no champion of the brexit vote that could say all right clear out all you other parties clear out where the boss now so that it would be as if Trump had won in 2016 but without Trump Trump ISM won but not Trump itself that's what happened in the brexit is the ideal one but there's no actual personification of that idea the closest thing it would be nigel Faraj and he's in a semi retirement he's doing lots of media and he's he's doing his European Parliament gig anyway so that's very interesting to me and we have even though Tommy Robinson our former employee is in prison of course I'll be going to the UK on July 24th to attend his appeal by the way so I'll do some reports from there and hopefully Tommy will be freed that day I I don't want to that my hopes get too high but I actually think that Tommy Robinson's going to be freed on July 24th and I'll give you my reasons for that later but basically that will be two months of hard time that he has served much of it in solitary confinement and I think any judge just on the basis of the rules for parole or a tag as they call it over there would look at two months in solitary and saying you know I let the man out I think Tommy Robinson's going to be let out maybe I'm a fool maybe I'm naive maybe I think that there's justice in a system that has shown itself too many times to be unjust but that will be literally 63 days Tommy was arrested on May 25th his appeal is on July 24th so is that 61 days someone with the calendar can do the math but I think at 60 days I think that's exactly 60 days so you serve 60 days in solitary that's that's like serving a year in regular prison I see Tom young John says intermittent fasting and keto diet may also cure cancer well I had no idea you know I like so many people I try and lose some weight but I don't try hard enough the one time I was successful I did go on the Atkins diet which is very hard to get into especially when you really break that sugar addiction it's really hard but it works trouble is keeping it off but I appreciate the advice all right I've read some comments it's 12:11 I want to show you a video from the United States Oh before I see it I see a super track coming I'm just gonna read that all over the United States Viking in st. says could Trump put economic pressure on the UK government to honor their commitment to brexit it's not bullying to support the democratic process I don't think that's Trump's way I don't nest rumps move I think Trump will use his bully pulpit he might tweet about it that's his favorite thing to do but for Trump to have some sort of economic punishment of the UK for them not following their own internal referendum it doesn't sound like Trump Trump has no problem fighting economically with foreign countries if they are doing something wrong in his eyes to America China Canada on trade for example Mexico on trade for example Iran North Korea militarily but if the UK does not honor its own referendum how's that Trump's business Trump is sort of a d entanglement guy so you think I have no doubt that Trump will say some support of things and tweet about it Trump and Nigel Faraj are friends I don't know if you remember but Nigel Faraj would actually occasionally open for a Trump at his American rallies that's quite something to have a foreign politician open in America but he had the same message of populism and take back your country so yeah I think Nigel Faraj probably working with Trump to come up with that just the right Bond MO the right few words but no you're not going to see academic sanctions it's not America's business I see two wolves chipped in five bucks thank you and said I'm only fight the anti Christian education system well you could be I don't know where you're running from are you in Ontario are you in Alberta are you in the United States are you in the United Kingdom the answer is all of the above isn't it the education system across the West generally is has been colonized by Marxist post modernists Jordan Peterson has certainly shed a light on that at the post-secondary education level but as any mom or dad knows political infection of schools goes right into the tender years I mean I remember when my kids were in preschool and we sent one of them to a science camp well how you're not gonna win at science camp right mix baking soda and vinegar and get a pretend volcano plant a bean and watch it grow you know no no they were even propagandas Tramp rag and icing two three and four-year-olds about global warming three global warming and giving them that schooling and hectoring that ain't science that's propaganda that's politics this was supposed to be some fun some it's everywhere it's everywhere so yeah I'm just talking about its general Marxism but of course it's anti-christian I mean that goes without saying in Ontario the newly elected premier Doug Ford says he's going to do something about it we'll see I think he might I think you might okay they were caught up on the on the super chats my producer friends will tell me if I'm wrong oh I think there's someone from Tom he says Google dr. Eric Berg intermittent fasting Quito cancer all right the googling is the easy part Tom the hard part is actually following it um we talked a little bit about brexit look I'm not an expert in the issue but I know what I like and I like Brits saying Britain means something and prison should not be ruled from Belgium and there are British culture and British laws and you know referenda and democracies you got to respect them and I don't like this shenanigans the cosy elites Donald Trump would say drain the swamp the Ford brothers would say stop the gravy train it's the same in every country I think that's what you're seeing in the United Kingdom but I want to show you a couple of videos the first one is a left-wing protest give them full marks to the left they know how to do an eye-catching propaganda exercise and here are some ladies who are protesting against Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick which is quite something because Donald Trump has not picked his Sikora Supreme Court pick yet but they know in advance they just know it's gonna be a bad pick look at these ladies reenacting Hemmings - hell keep your theology off of our biology get out of our privates there's a coat hanger which is meant to symbolize back-alley abortions so sort of a silent protest a war on women never Gilead Gilead of courses that Christian theocracy I should remind you if you don't know the history of the Hemings tale was written by a Canadian author named Margaret Atwood and if you look back to when she first wrote that novel she said she was sparked to write it by watching the revolution in Iran she said that there is no Christian theocracy in the world there hasn't been a Christian theocracy for centuries the Pope in Vatican City maybe you could call that theocracy but it's not even really that's just sort of a little tiny neighborhood in Rome and it's subject to Roman secular law there is no create I mean there was the Holy Roman Empire centuries ago there is no Christian theocracy but there are theocracies in the world you know it because it's right in their name and you know it because of how they treat women and so many of the metaphors and the symbols in Handmaid's Tale were exactly from the Iranian Revolution but why wouldn't Margaret Atwood especially back thirty forty years ago before Islamophobia was a thing before political correctness and multiculturalism was really a thing why did she set it in a Christian dystopia called Gilead why didn't she talk about it as the Islamic Republic of Iran or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia those are two official Islamic theocracies that actually require women to dress actually much worse those Republic of Gilead Han means because they show their face I don't need to tell you that in both Saudi Arabia and Iran if you were to go out merely as those Handmaid's Tale actors where that's not sufficient for the muta wean that's the phrase for the religious police why is it the Margaret at what is so brave and then forget Margaret Atwood HBO and all the others who were so enthused by The Handmaid's still why are they so brave at fighting against an imaginary theocracy but so timid when it comes to fighting against a real one I don't know but let me tell you about this case of a woman who lives in the Republic of Gilead can you remind me of her name Hannah it's I should have it here Iran teenager dancing I'm just googling that myself here we go made a hoe jaggery that's her name there so the tip of my tongue 19 year old woman and when she goes out she has to cover herself from from the head to toe in a black cloth sack you can say this is her Instagram page do you see that one on the right yeah that's her out and about in a black death bag you see she doesn't even show an inch of her wrist now I think she has to go further and fail her face you could see that she's a very pretty girl 19 years old under the black death garb May Day Hojo bury 19 but when she's at home she takes off her smock and like a lot of teenage girls around the world she likes to tweet tweet selfies likes to Instagram and she likes just to listen to western music and dance and I think she's not a bad dancer we've had a bit of a debate here but the off around the office I think she's got a few moves looks good I mean I don't see a good dancer not she's got those finger guns there I think here she's just actually trying to mimic this is a Justin Bieber song right I think she's just mimicking him there's some other dances like she does his shakira yeah that's just that's Justin Bieber I know his his moves by heart can we put up the one where she does the Shakira song that's the one where she's wearing it there's a bit of a belly dancer I mean so Shakira I think again she's more a mimic than a choreographer in her own right she's got some tats got a little bit of ink it's got some Western lingo going on you know always makes you laugh you go to the third world and folks you don't really know and just they just any English letters put together there's a sort of drill along whatever but how you're not going to like this girl I would see a very commonly laughs she's got some dance moves and sheep my point is you know why I mean there are a million teenage girls like that on the Internet why is this girl let me get her name made a hoja Bream why is she different because she's been arrested now for those videos her Instagram page is why she was arrested she was in the privacy of her own home in her own room yeah she showed a little belly button there as sometimes people do including belly dancers the songs aren't particularly racy some Bieber Shakira songs like that I I think she's a mimic I mean I I if you if you remember Shakira's original video and if you remember Bieber's really I think that was a Bieber song right I think she's just absolutely copying their moves with some skill with some skill it's just fun that's what teenagers do they dance they listen to music in their room you know the post pictures on social media she was arrested by real police in a real theocracy no not in the Republic of gilead or whatever it's called in the Hemmings tale but in the Islamic Republic of Iran the favorite country of Barack Obama the favorite country of Justin Trudeau and Justin Trudeau's brother Alexandre Trudeau who made a propaganda video in collaboration with the Iranian state broadcaster the movie you can google it it's called the new great game Justin Trudeau's brother literally made a pro Iran propaganda video this is the country they love this theocratic dictatorship run by people building nukes and ICBMs they just arrested a pretty girl for dancing in her bedroom and and listening to songs can you believe that of course you can believe that this is the country where they hang gaze from cranes when their former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke at Columbia University in New York City he was asked about the treatment of gays he said there's no gays in Iran and and the left-wing students hell because they didn't have the courage to challenge him but actually he's not lying is he because if he ever finds a gay he kills them so it is actually in some ways accurate to say there are no gays in around because the moment there are then they're killed so this is a real Republic of gilead except it's not just an HBO special because you just know that carinii can counsel of his American Islamic relations would instantly complain Islamophobia linda's are Seward sure we claim Islamophobia you couldn't have the Islamic Republic of Iran being mocked you could have the fake Republic of Gilead being mom except ones real and ones not you know every year the Austria I stopped watching the Oscars I think a lot of people did I think that all those shows they their plumbing new depths for how low their audience is and I think a lot of its politics I think people are sick of you know Robert De Niro bravely taking on Donald Trump how about taking on Iran how about taking on Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea I mean seriously how brave you have to be on to take on North Korea not brave at all they have no friends in the world other than maybe China you're not going to lose the the huge North Korean market in fact most Koreans would be South Koreans who would love the fact you're standing up for freedom for their from fellow ethnic Koreans but Hollywood is so bereft of courage that they absolutely absolutely would never take on this actual massage okay let me catch up I think I missed a bunch of comments I mean just seemed coppied Dessau says some laws are made to be followed others to be broken if you're referring to that dancing teenager I agree with you have I missed any others Hannah no I don't think so I think we're caught up all right so that's my point is and we're halfway done is 12 26 is I just saw those those leftist marchers condemning Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick who hasn't been picked yet well speaking of condemning donald trump's judge who hasn't yet can i show you a little bit of this video taken in new york city by a group called campus reform we've got our own website called campus unmasked if you haven't checked it out you should but campus reform they do good videos and let me show you this video let me say it stayed the obvious donald trump has not yet picked his Supreme Court nominee that will happen tomorrow I think or maybe today tonight it tonight thank you hasn't happened yet but don't tell that to these really woke Millennials take a look I'm Calvin fellows the campus reform today we're in New York City talking to students about president Trump's Supreme Court pick the only thing is he hasn't made that pick yet well people still have opinions on who it was though let's find out I think the big thing that's been in the news today Supreme Court Justice Kennedy stepping down so there's a vacancy I'm all week people were worried about who was going to be this week he made his announcement what's your reaction to the justice that you nominate today I'm honestly not surprised by his choice but that just worse for us I just saw the pic and I was like like it's almost at a point where you kind of expect that some it's not gonna be what you want he's quite you know extreme in his views and I don't know if it would make the Supreme Court very even I see it all over the news that like he's he's like starting a new wave of something something very negative and I'm really scared of what will happen in the future and my choices he'll mate so what reaction have you seen on social media today after the news o outrage should be this is just a reoccurring thing he keeps doing this with different positions and just doing every watts of using his power do so do you feel like his pick is an abuse of power basically yeah it's entire cabinet and everyone he's chosen has been the white supremacist Legion of Doom and it's dangerous to everyone who looks like me you feel like this spring court nominee today kind of falls in that same line quits they should all wear white hoods and burn crosses at the Capitol because that's exactly that's exactly the move that's what they're going for the fact that you would put someone up there that is so racist in is not practicing the quality that we need to see it's again it's insulting and it's he's not gonna last I mean I'm not a fan of the pic I'm really not I did speak to my dad a couple days ago and it goes on and the passion and ferocity or to quote that one lady the outrage that they have and and the pic hasn't been picked yet and then one fella who was talking about the white supremacist Legion of Doom and KKK hats I guess that goes for Donald Trump's black cabinet appointees to maybe I don't know black unemployment in the United States at all-time lows same with Hispanic unemployment whatever don't let facts get in the way of things but it shows just how effective the demonization by the left has been I have no idea who Donald Trump's gonna pick I think there's a chance he might pick a woman and you have never seen misogyny like the misogyny of the left the people who said I'm with her the people said it's time for a woman if it's a woman but I have no idea who's gonna be get ready for the most vile scrutiny and condemnation from the left that calls itself tolerant it reminds me of when one of the greatest justices of the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas who for so long helped keep the flame of conservatism alive when I think was George HW Bush nominated Clarence Thomas I think that's who was well you you remember it was called a high-tech lynching as how it was described you know why because if a Republican were allowed to nominate a black man to the Supreme Court well that's quite dangerous because that shows that blacks can be Republican and Republicans can support blacks and well the Democratic Party takes that vote for granted you can't do that can't do that I think Trump might make the same move tremors have some very senior appointees who are women minorities whatever tell and wait Sharon his campaign a Sarah Huckabee Sanders is doing a good job as a spokesman I think don't you Nikki hailey his ambassador to the United Nations very good I think it's a master to Canada there's a woman his Department of Homeland Security Secretary very stuff tough very tough woman I think there's been some excellent appointees that appear to be made irrespective to race or sex he just appointed a gay ambassador to Germany a very high-ranking position Rick Grinnell I think is the name of that ambassador so yeah all these folks who think they own identity politics is so clearly about owning a certain demographic own blacks can only vote Democrat gays can only vote Democrat or if you're in the UK labor if you're in Canada the Liberals and Donald Trump is disrupting that narrative isn't he so let's catch up here we looked at some of the dancing but I thought those were good dancing videos maybe I'm not hanging out on Instagram enough to know I'm not saying that she could you know win you know Iran's Got Talent or something I bet she could though by the way I'm just saying she's a normal nineteen year old girl having some fun and now she's been arrested Tom young John says bet you $2 said it's Amy Connie Barrett yeah I think that's the name it was pitched if I if I don't know that Judge but I think I saw the name Amy Barrett so yeah I think that could be it wouldn't that be something I'll watch the left freak out let's check the time here is 12 33 I'm just checked because we go till 1:00 p.m. Eastern every day I mentioned earlier that I'm going to go to the United Kingdom I can't make it there this weekend for the big protest but I encourage you to do so on July 14th at Whitehall I see my vast raheem Kassam for the details I'll wait till I hear them before I send an email out but if you're in the UK absolutely go I will be in court on July 24th in London at the Royal courts of justice because I have a feeling my bones Tommy might be released but also because I want to report from the appeal hearing itself I don't want to have to rely on the mainstream media to get the facts for me because it is my observation that with maybe two exceptions in the entire country the media in the United Kingdom despises Tommy Robinson or at least pretends to and what I mean by that is a lot of the tabloids the working-class fun tabloids with naked girls on the page back page or whatever in sports and soccer a lot of those their readers love Tommy but their snooty editors downtown for whatever reason despise Tommy they love writing about Tommy but always disparagingly and it is very difficult to sift through all their calumny a ting to find the facts underneath it I regard myself as a fairly sophisticated consumer of news I mean I used to work for a newspaper I'm president of a video company now I have a tough time getting facts about Tommy Robinson from the mainstream media and I want to know facts I want to be there I want to look at the judge and see what his demeanor is like I want to look at the other lawyers see what they're like and I want to report these facts to you I want to take meticulous notes in the courtroom I want to tell you what objections are sustained you're overruled I want to tell you what Tommy's lawyers are like I want to let you know what the crowd is like in the courtroom and outside there's a lot of things I want to do and I just don't trust delegating that basic fact-finding to the media party that despises Tommy because I am quite certain that if there is something that is unfair or untoward that they will gloss over it and if there's something that is to Tommy's credit they will ignore it or spin it and if there is some trifle against Tommy they will emphasize it and exaggerate it I just seen it with my own eyes on the occasions I would be in the UK with Tommy and then look and see things in my own eyes and then see the media coverage thereafter so I'm gonna go there and and I do have a hope maybe I'm a fool I have a hope that Tommy will actually be released because only in the most dire of cases does someone have to serve their full sentence Tommy was sentenced to 13 months and it'll be two months almost of the day on his appeal but when you are serving solitary confinement that counts for more that ought to at least why is Tommy in solitary people ask me that did he do something wrong did he fight with other prisoners no the opposite he was in Her Majesty's Prison HNP Hall which is in Leeds the city in which he was arrested I understand that HMP Hall Her Majesty's Prison Hall is actually the safest prison in the United Kingdom for Tommy and he was okay there but then for no reason warning or explanation he was transferred to HMP Onley which is dangerous to Tommy and therefore he has been in solitary ever since why was he transferred for what possible reason why I put it to you is transferred precisely for that reason to put him in jeopardy or to force him into solitary and we have yet to hear a good explanation for why that was done Tommy is no threat to himself or to others why would he therefore be put in a prison where he himself was spend who made that decision and on what basis I think there there has to be an inquiry into that of course you know Tommy does not work for me and I am not in a position to launch such an inquiry or to fund one myself but we are helping in the one way we know how which is we've crowdfunded Tommy's legal defence with the cooperation of his family in the direction of the mob you said wasn't gonna meddle in their affairs and I stay in touch with him on actually on a daily basis by email occasionally by phone I try not to bother them so wouldn't that be amazing if on July 24th Tommy is freed you know I on something like that you don't even want to say that because you don't want your hopes to be smashed but I I think that could be actually it could be the outcome I think the idea remember there's two things being appealed first is the length of a sentence and the second is the the his lawyers are looking for bail I won't get into the legalities of it so I think Tommy going home that day is it's a real possibility if the judge upholds the extreme sentence you'll call me a fool for having trusted yeah you could well be right all right it's 1238 we're two-thirds the way done I'm gonna take time to catch up on some super tweets super shots I see Heather Skinner says will be at Whitehall this weekend love your show well thanks very much Heather I hope it's a good turnout there's been some really good turnout before including the the big rally I think it was in early June so hopefully this will be a good one I know Trump's visit is creating some other political percolation hopefully things will be peaceful my one worry about demos as they call them over in in the UK is when you have a public demonstration where anyone on the street can just come on up you could have 5,000 10,000 20,000 good faith protesters on good behavior and you could have one person who acts like a yob gets drunk gets into a fight attacks a police officer god forbid does a Nazi salute one person 20,000 great people you have one third one person and because you didn't restrict access who is he is he truly a right-wing yob or is he an agent provocateur sent by the left posing as a Tommie supporter to discredit Tommie supporters that's my the one risk that I had in mind when Tommy would talk about doing demos when he was with us and he did a few demos including a huge one in you might recall 5,000 people shortly after the terrorist attack of the ariana grande concert there Tommy led a march of about 5000 people in Manchester extremely well-behaved but a couple of yobs made the news and I would bet you I would bet you that they were not legit I bet they were globalist auntie folk not hate plants from the left that's just how they operate all right I got to read some more chatty comments and then I want to I want to do we have any ads today yeah we got one all right so I read some more comments then I'll we'll play a quick ad and then we'll move on to our last subject happy infidel Fox says Tommy's too valuable alive they won't kill him I don't understand what you mean by that I think god forbid if Tommy were killed in prison there would be riots in the UK though and they would some of them would probably be provoked by the left but I think there would be genuine riots because people would know the plain truth which is that he was sent to a prison where his death was a high possibility and he was sent there by the state I don't support rides by the way in case you're wondering but I would understand them if they happened because tommy was deliberately put in the prison where he's in danger he was not in danger at all I don't know why they put him in HMP only and Barnes hey Jason Tommy will never be forgotten I hope you're right oh here's a tweet from Mark Britton Hall is 60 miles from Leeds Boris Johnson third to resigned government will you help Amy bacon lady with three charges against him I think I got an email from Amy over the weekend I got an email I'm just there's all these cases people are bringing to my attention so I guess my question is I want to do my due diligence I think I might have received an email from Amy on the weekend we have some reporters over there in the UK we've got Katie Hopkins of course she's more our commentator but she does do an investigative journalism and we have Jack Buckley and we have Martina Marc Cota so we do have some staff in the UK and I'm still looking through the notes that I received I think it was for the from the same Amy it might be someone else so I'm sorry that's the best answer I have right now because I'm not ready to commit until I do some more due diligence that's the thing Tommy when he worked with us and I'm sure was the same after he left got so many people asking him for help they would contact him via Facebook text message back then he was on Twitter friends of friends and he managed to vet these cases pretty pretty well you'll remember something we had Chelsea right the young lady from Sunderland we had John Fletcher Fletcher's convenience store also in Sunderland we had Nikki we had the dinner lady we had Chris from the Navy we had Knox from the Navy Tony helped a lot of people and he managed to do the triage on his own with his friends because you can remember you could imagine a lot of people want Tommy's help because either they genuinely want his help or they like publicity and a little bit of celebrity maybe they think there's some money in it so Tommy would probably get I'm just gonna guess five to ten requests a day and to sort through those and make sure you're not walking into a trap make sure the person you're talking to isn't crazy isn't so discreditable I mean it's okay if someone you're helping has a few blemishes we all do as humans but are they so odious that they are not that they are not someone that the public would rally to support so Tommy managed to do a pretty good triage and I all I'm saying is that when I get tips about something in a foreign country especially I want to make sure I want to make sure we're not going off half-cocked because our enemies surely would love to see us following disinformation dates vault Ezra's Canadian indeed I am but I have I am interested in the world beyond our borders let me just tell you what's interesting about our trip to Israel which is back from that on Thursday is I thought that we would be like 95% Canadian no we weren't we had people from South Africa Australia the United Kingdom the United States Denmark Hungary and Canada of course and how do we get all these so many Australians and a lot of breaths because the stories we talk about our universal at least to the west and Anglosphere and it wouldn't surprise me if one day we had someone join us from India because they have similar issues they speak English there they have similar issues about Islam and and things of that sort in India it's not that wealthy a country and this was an expensive trip but it would not surprise me if our roots in the Anglosphere continued to deepen I'm glad I'm going to the UK on the 24th because I think people in the UK and Canada and the United States and Australia and all these places I mention will find it interesting and you know I think when I do my reporting I will naturally sort of have Canada in mind because that's sort of where I'm from and what I know but now that I think about it I think a lot of Brits would probably watch my video I think to want to be presumptuous because they've learned not to trust The Times The Telegraph or even the tabloids like The Daily Mail or the Sun either it's not weird that I'm a Canadian I mean this and there I really admire Paul Joseph Watson I think you know that he's not so much a hard news journalist he's a commentator and he's the best in the business by the way I love that guy I hope he comes to Tommy's appeal but that's not his style really Paul Joseph Watson isn't to go out and put a microphone in front of someone he's a good digester and a critic and an analyst so um I think I'm in there to be some doing some news reporting and I think a problem they'll probably be either mainstream media journalists there too but I just know in my bones you're not going to be able to trust a single word they say so I want to bring news back to our rebel supporters but in a way I want to give news to to the Brits too right all right let's let's take a couple of more questions will Bruce it's John Zealand says well Boris Johnson join you Kipp I very much done it I very much done it but look I'm not an expert in the UK you tell me Spencer JPM Trudeau is fake head to dome he held my god yeah we're gonna have more on him tonight on my EPM show um Andrew per sec Ezra what are your thoughts on Doug Ford fighting back against Trudeau well I think he will do it I think he's got to do it I think he's right to do it I think he's a mandate to do it he just won a big election provincially and fighting against the carbon tax was fairly central to that I'm just trying to find some that I make some sense Matt getting laugh-out-loud google throttling the ramble they're supported by the same Zionist bastards I don't even know what to say to that I mean I'm pro-israel as I think a lot of conservatives are I'm also a Jew but I think I would be Pro is real even if I wasn't the same way I'm Pro Taiwan we talked about this before I support Taiwan even though I have no personal ethnic religious linguistic geographical connection to Taiwan because it's a little democracy next to a big bad authoritarian regime and that's how I see Israel the little liberal democracy in a sea of dictatorships caliphates we talked about the Islamic Republic of Iran I mean there's not a lot of good guys over there I have a theological connection to Israel because it is where Mount Zion is I suppose Christians could say the same thing I just think those are boring tweets boring comments David KTV er diversified Kansas economy start manufacturing removable eyebrows it's a funny joke okay Kim sated red pill fill has a video up about bacon lady and okay so the an Amy I'll check out red I really like red pill fill I'm gonna write a note to red pill so I'm gonna I'm gonna check out his video I really like red pill film and Ruby god bless Knox yeah you know that was such a great campaign wasn't it can you just pull up some b-roll of think Knox just want to remind people I don't think Tommy ever served in the military but he sure loves the military and I think they love him back and there's this Navy vet I think his first thing was Gareth right on that knocks KN o X everyone just calls him Knox and he was a bit of a hero but if a celebrity in the Navy and then he got a debilitating condition I'm not sure what was called just throw up any old b-roll think Knox KN o X Maybach guy there and and so we bought him that look at that because the Navy wouldn't get him the proper off-road style there's Tommy you can't show me Knox in that and that vehicle he was in that was an expense that was like an all-terrain vehicle wheelchair it could go on beaches it could go over curbs I just want to show you that because that was Tommy's idea Tommy hated the fact that our soldiers our soldiers UK soldiers but it's the same in Canada especially those I'd love to show that wheelchair again where did our friends just my friends just look at it so he was given like a crappy old wheelchair that's probably good enough for most people but this Knox was a real athlete like in the Navy he would participate in all these like strongman competition type games and for him not to be able to do that and for him to lose his mobility was really really not great but then the Navy refused to give him look at that thing so you see his losses yeah just check this out this thing look at those tires look at those tires and it's easy to control and look at it go just tootle around that thing high mobility look at Tommy Tommy was just thrilled look at that look at that how great was that we crowd fun to that Tommy crowd funding and and that's the that's the right kind of a wheelchair for Knox thanks I just wanted to show that wheelchair because it's not just a wheelchair and I mean Knox tummy would say that his friends would take him down carry him down the beach throw him at the water and he would swim because he likes that high activity lifestyle and he hates if I'm not sure what as to what his illness was if it was I don't want to guess anyways so that was um that was one of the things Tommy did alright I don't even know why I got onto that I got one more story I want to tell you and it's just as well as 12:52 I'm sorry I rambled on there a bit but I just forgot oh I know because I was talking about doing due diligence and you can imagine a lot of people saw that Tommy crowdfunded I think that was like an $18,000 wheelchair I can't remember it was incredibly expensive it was almost like a like a small car and you could see was pretty pretty amazing I think it's the finest wheelchair you can buy actually just those tires on that thing it's that thing go over a curb anyways so the thing imagine that so you see Tommy being chummy with Knox getting Knox is $18,000 wheelchair maybe was 18,000 pounds they couldn't be that expensive you can imagine how many people say Oh Tommy Tommy Tommy help me help me help me and so you got a hundred requests people because everyone wants to hang on Tommy because so much fun and wouldn't it be amazing if Tommy got them an $18,000 wheelchair too so Tommy did the due diligence there I guess what I'm saying is I want to I want to make sure that if we do a campaign like some people are suggesting that we help a me or an or whoever it is I want to make sure we do our due diligence like Tommy did with not you understand what I'm saying like if we can like Tommy helped I don't know ten people so if you can help one person a month you better make a good choice right someone that you can merely make a difference somebody's got a really clear story to tell someone who is not embarrassing in their own way who hasn't caused the problem as you know it's a really bad dude and someone who's willing to go on camera so you can tell the story and raise the funds crowdfunding only works if you can inspire the public so that's that's my point is that do the due diligence and that's journalism that's what journalism is and Tommy had it instinctively Tommy was quite natural with that he has sources and he's got a good instinct all right never Pub Tommy I want to talk about America they take a 30-second break we'll run a quick commercial be back after these short messages don't go away what a huge celebration for freedom would a huge celebration for Western civilization it would be the worst depression in Canada since the dirty 30s all these lies just to stir up uninformed left it all started on Twitter as nothing's ever going to happen because the police is so terrified that this ever getting out as we all know this isn't the first time that Catherine McKenna has driven her Twitter accounts right into the ditch they will not let us win another election with our old tactics mean control that was under way he trumped arrangements in trouble off the chart look at that I hadn't seen that ad before look at all those rebel personalities I think we're missing men Zoid from that though I think we're missing the image Ben Davies from a Hollywood Amanda head the Hollywood conservative Kurt Schlichter Katie Hopkins of course Jack buck B and Martina Marco te' they're in the UK Sheila Gunn read John Cardillo I said big lineup in them I said it's great to see it all together I think we're missing the men's Oy I think we got Adam into that all right it is 12 Jesus oh my gosh it's only four minutes left let me show you what the left has left I mentioned before they like in the UK this is basically what they're doing to brexit the resistance but in America it's got very physical very violent very threatening take a look at Mitch McConnell it's a senator not particularly Trump each senator and there's new move by any Democrat who sees any Republican to threaten them to physically attack them as Senator Rand Paul has been attacked several times as Steve Scalise the congressman was shot here's the latest involving the yeah Louis I apologize abolish ice now I happen to think that it is lawful to criticize a politician I think it's lawful even to be rude to a politician but when you say we know where you live there's a degree of Menace there I don't think that should be illegal but I think it's bordering on an unethical especially when we've seen physical threats and in some cases those threats being carried out I mentioned the attack on Rand Paul we know where you live what does that mean what does that mean does that imply that we're gonna hurt you at your home I understand that Steven Miller the key staffer to Donald Trump in my view especially on issues like immigration I understand that he needs Secret Service protection because he's under so many threats that's how bad it is that's the left that's all they got left that's anti flaw for you quick we got one minute left but the c-band an article of Steve Bannon was just at a bookstore I think he was in Richmond Virginia called the Black Swan he's just looking at books and some Democrats just start screaming screaming in the bookstore now the bookstore owner rather than kicking out Bannon called the police on the screamer and now the left is siccing the mob on the bookstore itself I bet you it'll be torched or have its windows smashed within a week that's the left for you they never change if they don't win an election they'll steal it through violence that's what Breck say is the left lost the election now they're trying to steal it that's our show for the day the hour went by quickly I hope you enjoyed it thank you for all your super chats if I didn't get yours I'm sorry I think we got through most of them if not all of them I'll be back tomorrow and actually I'll be on tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern with my regular show until then on behalf of all of us here at rebel world headquarters goodbye and keep fighting for freedom you
