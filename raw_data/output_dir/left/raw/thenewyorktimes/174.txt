1
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:06,632
Peacocks are the very
definition of showy.

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,914
Look at them strut.

3
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:15,524
But they don't just show their 
feathers to attract females.

4
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:18,043
They shake them.

5
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:19,668
It's called train rattling.

6
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:22,787
The train being that whole
amazing tail.

7
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,030
And the rattling,

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,572
you can hear it.

9
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:29,055
A group of Canadian and
American researchers

10
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:33,486
wanted to nail down the 
physics of all that shaking.

11
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:36,883
They shot high-speed 
video of the birds.

12
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:39,752
And they conducted some 
feather-shaking experiments

13
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:41,543
of their own.

14
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,689
Here are a few of their 
findings.

15
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:46,029
The tail feathers vibrate 
at their natural

16
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,061
resonating frequency,

17
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:49,972
like a guitar string.

18
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:52,902
The iridescent eyes

19
00:00:52,902 --> 00:00:55,812
stay still while the rest of 
the feathers are shaking.

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,959
And males with longer, 
heavier feathers,

21
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,228
don't shake them more
slowly, as you might think,

22
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,030
they shake them faster.

23
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:07,547
The researchers plan to 
build on this foundation,

24
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:10,153
learn more about what 
the female sees

25
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,223
and what she hears.

26
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:14,727
Darwin himself wondered 
about the rattling.

27
00:01:14,727 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it part of the appeal 
or just noise?
