1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
the latest effort to overhaul Obamacare
Graham Cassidy offered by Republican

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,470
senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy
could come to the Senate floor for a

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,550
vote this week now already two
Republican senators have said they are

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,730
no votes Rand Paul and John McCain one
more no vote will kill the bill so all

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,769
eyes gaze northward to Maine to Senator
Susan Collins who over the summer along

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,340
with McCain and Senator Lisa Murkowski
voted nay

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,960
thus for killing the previous repeal and
replace effort how will Collins vote on

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,079
Graham Cassidy
well senator Collins joins us now

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,309
senator good to see you as always your
vote is pivotal on the Graham Cassidy

10
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,899
health care bill where are you yes or no
Jake it's very difficult for me to

11
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,219
envision a scenario a scenario where I
would end up voting for this bill I have

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,870
a number of serious reservations about
it I'm concerned about the impact on the

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,400
Medicaid program which has been on the
books for more than 50 years and

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,810
provides health care to our most
vulnerable citizens including disabled

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,530
children and low-income seniors I'm
concerned about the impact on costs and

16
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,020
coverage we already have a problem under
the Affordable Care Act with the cost of

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,939
premiums and deductibles and finally I'm
very concerned about the erosion of

18
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:35,729
protections for people with pre-existing
conditions like asthma arthritis cancer

19
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,990
diabetes and what it would mean to them
I imagine you've been on the phone with

20
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,220
other uncommitted senators like Lisa
Murkowski and also probably with the

21
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,430
White House how those conversations been
going I have had a lot of conversations

22
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,229
over the weekend with numerous of my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle

23
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,350
and I had a very lengthy conversation
with the vice president yesterday as

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,619
always with the vice president he was
very cordial he made the case he asked

25
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,830
me to think more thoroughly about some
issues I I told him about the very

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,520
analyses of the impact that concerned me
he told me he would get me more numbers

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,270
on the impact on the state of Maine and
on the nation so you say you find it

28
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:33,870
difficult to envision any scenario you
would vote for Graham Cassidy is that a

29
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:43,050
no then what I am doing is as is my
general practice is I would like to see

30
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,840
the Congressional Budget Office analysis
which is expected to come out tomorrow

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,900
morning and I am worried about whether
CBO's been given enough time to

32
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,640
thoroughly analyze this bill which has
been a moving target even over the

33
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,680
weekend I was receiving emails
suggesting that the sponsors of the bill

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,950
are still changing the formula so it may
be difficult for CBO to do the kind of

35
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,600
in-depth analysis that it usually does
but that's what I would like to see

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,000
before making a final decision
but it may be that CBO is going to say

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that this is impossible because the
parameters of the bill keep changing so

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,550
you see oh you want to see a CBO score
as you note there have been other

39
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,440
studies of the impact of Graham Cassady
let me put some of the numbers on the

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,430
screen from some of these studies 20
months with 21 million fewer Americans

41
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,170
covered that's from Brookings States
losing 215 billion dollars that's from a

42
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,230
Valier 31 states losing money that's
from Kaiser as you know the CBO score

43
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,239
even even if you get it in time for the
vote it's probably only going to look at

44
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,310
the impact on the deficit and not look
at the impact on the on the issues you

45
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,450
talk about Medicaid the total number of
uninsured what information could the CBO

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,910
possibly provide you that might make you
support the Graham Cassidy bill well I

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,579
actually expect that CBO is either going
to reinforce those studies that you've

48
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,530
just mentioned all of which I have
digested over the past couple of weeks

49
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,590
or that CBO is going to say that they
simply don't have the time

50
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,510
to do a thorough analysis but you
remember when the CBO did the analysis

51
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,030
of the first Senate bill and the House
bill it was very thorough in analyzing

52
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,980
the impact on the number of people who
would lose insurance on the impact of

53
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:50,160
the changing the Medicaid program and by
the way we would be making these huge

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,040
changes in Medicaid without the benefit
of extensive hearings and that's what we

55
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,660
would would need and so I don't know
whether the CBO analysis will have new

56
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:13,530
information that would change where I'm
inclined to head but it is normally the

57
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,900
way we proceed is to look at the CBO
analysis I'm I'm gonna know tomorrow

58
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,960
morning whether or not CBO reinforces
the concerns and reservations that I

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,200
already have based on the studies that
you've cited or whether CBO is going to

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,970
say that they can't come up with the
kind of in-depth analysis that the

61
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,950
agency usually does or maybe they'll be
as surprised in there I don't anticipate

62
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,280
that but I want to wait it's just a few
more hours to wait to see that important

63
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,290
study so it sounds like a no with an
asterisk unless CBO has some sort of

64
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,890
dramatic change
president Trump had some tough words on

65
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,810
Friday for any Republican senator who
votes the way it looks like you you're

66
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,830
likely to vote he tweeted quote Rand
Paul or whoever votes against health

67
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,340
care bill will forever future political
campaigns be known as quote this

68
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,080
Republican who saved Obamacare assuming
that you ultimately vote the way it

69
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,860
sounds like you're going to vote are you
okay with President Trump calling you

70
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:24,900
the Republican who saved Obamacare you
know my focus is on improving our health

71
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,810
care system and what I would like to see
happen is for us to return to the very

72
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,010
good work that the Senate Health
Committee was doing under the leadership

73
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:41,090
of senators Lamar Alexander and patty
Murray we had four substantive in

74
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,570
hearings widespread participation by the
Senate during the past two weeks and

75
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:53,720
they were very close to producing an
initial bill that would help to moderate

76
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,940
increases in premiums are actually lower
premiums and stabilize the insurance

77
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,270
markets to ensure that people had more
choices

78
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,820
that's the Avenue that we should take
the ACA is some flawed law and the

79
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,960
causes and premiums and deductibles are
real problem for individuals

80
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,490
particularly those who don't get
subsidies and but it's a real problem

81
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,160
for our small businesses so I want to
fix those problems and I see the work

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,860
we're doing in the help committee as the
path forward I think we should do a

83
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,960
series of bills with the first bill
being directed at stabilizing the

84
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,400
markets and lowering premiums senator
Susan Collins from the great state of

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,720
Maine thank you so much we appreciate
your time today

86
00:07:40,720 --> 00:00:00,000
thank you Jake
