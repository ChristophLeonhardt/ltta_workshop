meanwhile Facebook has also been accused of abusing its monopoly in Germany and of inappropriate collection of users data Arty's Peter Oliver reports well this all comes out of a statement from the wonderfully named Federal cartel office they're the main competition watchdog here in Germany they slammed Facebook saying that its users have no idea and have given no consent for the levels of data from them which is being obtained by the social network and that is then being used to target adverts directly at them we're mostly concerned about the collection of data outside Facebook's social network and the merging of this data into a user's Facebook account we're not convinced the users have given their effective consent to Facebook's data tracking and the merging of data into their Facebook account well it also comes as Facebook's been accused of being overly intrusive after introducing new facial recognition software that can recognize a person's face even if they haven't been tagged in a picture it's worth noting this investigation is ongoing here in Germany by the Competition watchdog they say they aren't looking into how data is obtained but they're more looking into the fact that Facebook seems to sit by and watch and observe our lives and interests and then gets information that way for Facebook's part they say the federal cartel offers have misrepresented them by saying that they dominate the social media arena here in Germany as far as Facebook are concerned there are alternatives to them and if there wasn't alternatives only then would they be dominating as it's put across what we are seeing and what we have seen already is sharing data with a third party here in Germany is illegal and it's becoming more and more of an issue and more focus falling on social media outlets not just here in Germany but across wider Europe if we look over in France that's where what's up the messaging application is facing a fine from the French authorities that's after they shared their users data with Facebook of course if we do remember Facebook bought bought out whatsapp back in 2014 what we won't expect from this report when it's published and fallen in the summer is a fine for Facebook but what we're hearing from the main competition watchdog here in Germany is they're going to tell Facebook they need to change the way they go about doing things
