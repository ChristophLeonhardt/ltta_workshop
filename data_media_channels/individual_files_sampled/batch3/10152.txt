I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report you know America's becoming one big ghetto with heroin Eric nodding out everywhere across every socio-economic plane of existence every group Stacy well max the thing you're trying to bring up is the fact that if you tune into the news where you go to look for analysis of what is happening in your economy what is happening in your culture your politics to understand the world around you it's all Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia in the meantime I think Russia is like five or six thousand miles eight thousand miles from here well if you count the whole country it's like thousands and thousands of miles across Russia but right here in this country I saw this image it's a video of these clerks at a gas station shop you know we've just driven across the country and there are many of these gas stations little convenience stores on the gas station and here are these two women nodding off while the customer is trying to pay for her goods and it just made me feel so sad for the fact that this is happening here in this country and nobody is talking about it or putting into context what is going wrong how what what is wrong yeah well it's called the get off vacation of America and if you listen to Gil scott-heron one of the seminal street poets spoken word geniuses of our era you know you would know that this was coming basically America doesn't want to deal with the fact that it's been abusive toward its minority population and put them into economically disadvantaged us ghettos which have led to drug use heroin use and all kinds of problems and as a result of the necessary infrastructure of Prisons to maintain the ghetto of America primarily the black population there's no more money left for with a white population so the geta fication of America is spilling over now and you know obviously you've got these two white women yeah that's what I want to say okay but the fact is what I think is actually the problem relates to our first headline here yeah and that is the copyright cartels the the sort of oligarchies ization of America the fact that basically we have a Pablo Escobar like situation you and I covered it before on the tobacco trail the carnage trail here this town Durham North Carolina was built on the tobacco industry the cartel that the Duke family ran of the the tobacco industry today we have an opioid epidemic because of the cartels from Connecticut the what the family in Connecticut that runs the opioid epidemic but now this also the fact that we have these Oleg our keys has basically led to a situation where not only are we pushing drugs on people but there's no hope of ever rising because here's a study and this is from the New York Times as headline myths of the 1% what puts people at the top dispelling misconceptions about what's driving income inequality in the u.s. so the study looks at all of the myths of of what's causing inequality in the US why the 1% owns 20% of all the wealth in the United States and and basically they look at all the other OECD nations and by comparing the the arguments they can find out that is it's not trade it's it's not the rise of information technology it's not about unions and it's not about immigration either because if you look at other nations with more immigration or more trade or or more IT than America they don't have the same situation and what they found is that it's actually basically the cartels or the government intervention in certain industries and we'll go into that in specifics but it's things like you know the fact that to get a to cut hair in the United States you have to spend like two thousand dollars to get a license in many states just to have the right to cut hair they're like so barriers to entry that have been erected all over the economy all over it through various services and stuff right the oligarchs the wealth concentration the bureaucratic concentration is sapping the economic vitality from this entrepreneurial nation called America and the masa nations and the costs associated therewith of keeping this huge prison population in place are draining money away from all aspects of society and you've got the problems that you would normally associate with the ghetto like people nodding out in the middle of day in the middle of the street heroin not just nodding out like you I lived in Harlem for four years and I'm quite familiar with what happens to a community when it's run by heroin gangsters and what this does to folks and now we're seeing it across every socio-economic strata of America because the same freakin gangsters are running all of society the same drug pushers and opiate pushers that we used to condemn in places like Harlem and other urban areas are now running economic policy in America so you got a nation of freakin not and heroin addict down there at the convenience store you know all jacked up looking for a hit you know and frickin crack whores are running everything in America cracker was jacked up these people are just want to nod out because like this study by the way is by Jonathan Rothwell and he's a senior economist at Gallup and when you're talking about the 1980s when Gil scott-heron was alive and kicking and and and offering his poetry to the world and explaining the situation of the ghetto of America of America Society of the b-movie sort of identification of America so ok copyright cartel is you can't even do that so the fact is that in 1980 the top 1% they're their share of the national income was 11% in 2014 it was 20% and it's increased even more no other nation in the 35 member Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in the OECD is as unequal among those with comparable tax data none have experienced such a sharp rise in equality so what's going on the Gallup economists looked and he said that almost all of the growth in top American earners has come from just three economic sectors professional services finance and insurance and health care groups that tend to benefit from regulatory barriers that shelter them from competition of course we've talked about Obama care this is like part of the health cartel is right here behind us Duke is like part of that whole cartel system of health care in America but they have benefited from the regulatory barriers Dean Baker he's covered the economists in out of Washington DC he's covered the fact that doctors for example you can't just we can't import through immigration doctors because they need to get all the medical certificate certification here in the United States even if they've been trained to France or Germany or United Kingdom anywhere in Europe they or Hong Kong or Singapore great doctors great health care systems there they can't just come here and start offering services to Americans they have to get you know spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get the certification required to practice here my sister Nell got bit by a rat yeah and Whitey's on the moon you know the revolution will not be televised ain't nothing but a b-movie the fact is you've got regulatory capture you've got the capture of these industries of the American economy and they're beating the hell out of people every single day this is like the Harvey Weinstein ization of the American economy where everyone is just getting unmercifully violated 24/7 by these cartel you know snot-nosed jerk-offs that are just listen talk more Galang warrior to offer a better poetry than what you're doing here so again so the groups that have contributed most of the 1% since 1980 our physicians executive managers sales supervisors and analysts working in the financial sectors and professionals and legal service industry executives managers lawyers consultants and sales reps so all the protected industries without this changes these largely domestic service industries finance health care and the law the United States would look like Canada or Germany in terms of the top income shares so again remember by the way we're outside you might hear some airplanes you might see there's some Amtrak train go and passed by there you might hear noises around us just so you know there's noises but here so you don't see a you know checkout counter staff if you driving across Germany on the Autobahn you don't see people nodding off at the checkout counter there because of course they've got some dignity they have hope they have hope that you know that they're the government's not going to prevent them from accessing the economy around them right you mentioned the government there it's not going to allow for certain thing and of course in America there's a huge population that equates the government with something diabolical and evil even though the government is the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights the government is the what yeah well that's right I'm like nodding with you you're not I'm nodding agree yes and however here they are saying that the government in the United States is owned by specific groups of industries that are setting up regulatory barriers to anybody entering that system that's why I think every moment in the United States runs a coffee shop because there's no cartel for coffee apparently but the problems so they go through why these industries are protected and how they're protected what they say is that the problem cited by these analysts includes subsidies for the financial sectors risk taking over protection of software and pharmaceutical patents the escalation of land use controls that drive up Brent and desirable metropolitan areas favoritism toward market incumbents by a state occupational license regulations for example associations representing lawyers doctors and dentists that block efforts allowing paraprofessionals to provide routine services at a lower price without their supervision so the government is erecting barriers i will nod agreement with that here's the big secret in America there is no government there are only corporations yes and we're actually going to talk about that soon I want to talk about this Amazon headquarters and this is very important that your cities I mean we are entering a needle neo feudal corporate state for sure and I think what we see with Amazon basically pitching for a second headquarter it's pretty remarkable right that as part of the deal they are offered to actually run the government in these towns that they're pitching for it much more about this coming your way don't go away right after the break welcome back to the Kaiser report on max Kaiser time now to continue with our conversation with Jameson lop welcome back so you're a third-generation North Carolinian I am and your avatar on Twitter you're holding you're smoking a cigar and yeah I think you're shooting a gun well got might make Bitcoin great again had on yeah I may or may not be holding a gun you can't tell I can't tell but I've seen some other photos you're holding guns now you talking about Bitcoin in terms of individual sovereignty one of the things that I really like about your approach to this and can you talk a little bit about what that means sure I mean to me the the reason that we got into this entire mess and and and created this Bitcoin software and everything that has spawned off of it is simply because we for generations if not you know the entire sum of human history have put trust in other people to take care of the accounting Ledger's to take care of a really power in general you know creating these hierarchical power structures and it makes sense that that has happened you know it's more efficient it allows a society to work pretty smoothly but you're making a lot of trade-offs you're you're over a lot of of your own power to somebody else in order for you to go about your life you know being an ignorant fool but happy right the layers of trust in the system you know when you think about it everything we do you're on the road you're driving you're getting your licenses you're starting a business you your various institutions and everything is layers of trust and there's government layers of trust and so Bitcoin essentially has reinvented how we manage trust in our society because it's through this protocol that is developed consensus which is not centralized and because it's electronic and digital it's frictionless or the cost is almost zero I mean going back to the old days I lived in a little town in the South of France called villefranche-sur-mer which started with pirates saying to the residents you know give us a yearly sum of cash and we'll protect you with our pirate ships right and that's the history of society is that you've mercenaries to protect the town yeah and now that's not really neater anymore right well at least from the the monetary standpoint yeah we said hey we could flip this whole model upside down and instead of us trusting you know certain entities instead we are gonna track everything ourselves we are gonna you know validate our rules and we're not going to trust anybody and then we'll just create protocols and use the technology that has been developed over the past generation or so in order to be able to automate our communication and automate our trust with each other let's talk about the intrinsic value of Bitcoin for a second because one of the easiest ways you can make the case is to say well look at the protocol buy an email right or the Internet itself mm-hmm anyone could come up with a new email protocol but at this point it's so entrenched and so Universal and so pro-pro prolific and out there that the chances of that are very small the people who argue who are in the gold camp who say it has no intrinsic value don't understand that aspect of it and they don't accept the fact that well yeah you could come up with a new email protocol but I could also mine gold on an asteroid I could also mine gold from the sea the probability is minut so it's not worth considering what do you think that it's kind of funny because I actually worked on email platforms before I got into Bitcoin and and yeah I mean email protocol it's very old it's outdated it's simple there's so many things you could do to make it better but the network effect is so huge nobody wants to try to overcome that Network effect it's just not worth it at this point we just build more stuff on top of it keep going that's essentially a Bitcoin yeah and there's a few examples of this protocol throughout the technology industry the HTTP protocol you know these are protocols that are prolific and etc that have a huge value and can you build on that a little bit more we have these protocols that have over the years become very stable people have have come to learn I guess the the kind of eccentricities about them and it's become a standard and so once you have that standard it's it's hard to change it but you can try to extend it and you know add more things on top of it or or even you know create other layers on top of it so I think that that's kind of the perspective that a lot of people on the Bitcoin side are saying is you know extend and build on top of rather than try to replace which is what some people are trying to do but there's just a lot more technical and human challenges to overcome if you want to do that it seems that despite the efforts of big banks like JP Morgan or countries like China to try to derail the Bitcoin freight train they're failing is this the genius of Satoshi and where's it's going well you know it was probably inevitable Satoshi you just happened to be that that lucky person or group of persons who who really found the right combination of technologies and game theory to put it all together I mean this goes back decades so somebody was probably gonna figure out eventually right you have three things that I see you have game theory you have Metcalfe's law which is the networking effect essentially where you have increased returns economics and play the mushrooming the the old example of the fax machine you know one fax machine is worthless two fax machines are kind of interesting but once you get to three fax machines and for the value of the network expands exponentially with each new node right so this is the this is Metcalfe's law then you have to add answer add to that fares law of good money chasing out bad you put those three things together as it's done in this protocol and you end up with a runaway freight train of value asset trading that is undefeated undefeatable and we're at the space where do you agree with that assessment that seems to be the case so far there are you know plenty of skeptics out there who believe that you know something even better than Bitcoin will come in replace it and you know the market will decide but so far so good um futures contracts are being launched in Wall Street's getting into the game a lot of people say well you know in the gold market the problem is all these features contracts they manipulate the price and they're keeping the lid on gold prices how do you see that playing on the Bitcoin space there are some people who who think that you know it's going to short Bitcoin into the ground but I think that a more likely outcome is that you're shorting Bitcoin is a terrible idea anyone who tries to do that is going to get rekt pretty hard well let me ask this so in other words if you look at what's happening with Patrick Byrne over there at overstock he's launching T zero which is zero confirmation date which is if the treating in Bitcoin is the confirmation it totally disintermediate to Wall Street the total apparatus needed to do naked short-selling and all the things that have crippled the gold market for so long are going to be blown away as adoption of Bitcoin takes hold so initially you might have some of this problem but the protocol it's gonna kill those guys it's gonna kill them deader than a bag of nits doornails well and this is just a transitional period right I mean when we're still we're still using the dollar as the unit of account we're what we're trying to get to is the point where we're using Bitcoin as a unit of account so I think it's only gonna you know last for so many years before we get to that high per Bitcoin ization that some people are dreaming up right well I did so I mean Patrick Byrne overstock is I don't know I just angers me to think that there's still Jamie Dimon still breathing oxygen on this in this world that's serial terrorist like that and my let me move on so you self-identify as a cypherpunk what is this all about so the the cypherpunks the origin of the movement really goes back to the 80s a bunch of nerds who they saw the promise of the internet and these new communications technologies but they also saw the dark side they saw what could happen as you know surveillance state comes in and uses these technologies for evil basically so they wanted to build privacy enhancing technologies into the Internet itself on top of the Internet protocols and it just so happened that you know digital money was one of those very interesting things that the cypherpunks thought was important for society to have and they a number of cypherpunks worked on it for decades and it wasn't until 2009 that you know Satoshi came along and actually had an elegant solution there were many many attempts and failed solutions that happened before Bitcoin there are estimated 4 million bitcoins now that are lost you know I've lost God knows how many Bitcoin enough to buy this building probably what do you think about this so the actual effective number will not be 21 million in total it'll be probably closer to 17 million yeah well your thoughts on this and we'll never know for sure I mean you can use various methods to try to estimate that but that's kind of part of the game right is that this is a lesson in responsibility I mean it's a lesson in self sovereignty which means responsibility so the people who get into Bitcoin without understanding what they're getting into they may get hacked but more likely they're just going to be negligent and they're gonna lose their bitcoins and that will be their learning lessons yeah I mean every day people are saying I had a thumb drive it has a hard drive at a paper wallet you know with a few bitcoins on it I don't know where it is I lost it I threw it away I gave it away and now this is quite meaningful in terms of dollars in the sense and that's the learning level so what are your guide to Bitcoin survival because you're somebody who seems to keep your equanimity intact throughout all the drama and all the price moves how do you do it what's your what's your guide to survival Jameson love lots of backups lots of testing I mean the the main problem right now is there is such a high learning curve and so I just tell people you know do not put any money into it until you feel like you understand it enough to be safe and so that for some people that means just copping out and and you know sending their coins to coinbase or Zappo or some trusted provider for a lot of people that may be a safer option but if you really want to go like full self sovereignty full responsibility you need to put in the effort and it's we're talking not just ours but probably days if not weeks of effort of teaching yourself and then actually going through the motions of testing and and doing the appropriate security measures and I have plenty of articles and blog posts about the minutiae of that yeah yeah the website with all the links that you have everything can be found on lock net lop net and yeah you know go there all the time and who else is in this space you know that I file a trace mayor is really fantastic Andreas Antonopoulos that's a lot of videos which which are very good and Peter Todd you know if you want to get more of a technical thing it's got some really great you know videos out there and so what do you think is gonna be the next stage in this ride so you know more philosophically speaking what are we gonna see in the next couple years as as the money becomes a Napster eyes as money is taken from the central banks the central banks get redundant so what does that mean what I mean we talked about people's individual sovereignty you would get battle-ax but what does it mean what else go go run with that a little bit I mean it's gonna change the game significantly so you know we're already at a point where there are so many honey pots out there because now this this digital money is a lot more tempting for hackers to try to get to because once they get it no one can take it away from them we're gonna I think see some you know innovative new types of criminal activity and we're gonna see some innovative new types of of Commerce and regular interaction from an economic standpoint so I'm very interested to see what happens when we can create a completely new type of economy especially one that's like based on micro transactions you know trying to get to that what I would I would ascribe as a crypto anarchist or anarcho-capitalists utopian voluntary future on the Internet one example of that might be that like the yours platform where you're paying micro payments to authors and you know instead of having advertiser Charles X yep I follow him on Twitter as well yeah so so you know the idea where why oh you are s so micro anyway I think we're out of time right but okay it's an excellent idea micro transactions enabling more peer-to-peer and the financialization of everything we do in society without any intermediaries whatsoever making the incentives more clear by actually paying people you know when they give us something of value now that it'll be so much easier to pay tiny tiny amounts all right cool Jameson lob thanks again for me on the Kaiser report my pleasure that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy here but I'd like to thank our guest Jameson lop you can find them at Twitter at lopped L OPP if you want to reach us on Twitter at Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
