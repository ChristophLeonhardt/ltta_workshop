Paris, France
2.
Crews are removing 45 tons of padlocks from
Pont des Arts bridge, ending a tourist tradition.
3.
For years, couples latched “love locks”
onto the bridge as a symbol of their affection.
4.
But the weight of the locks is threatening
the bridge, which was first opened in 1804.
5.
The city will replace the fencing with plexiglass
in hopes that the tradition will stop.
6.
Advocacy groups are pushing to end love locks
to protect other historic monuments around
the world.
