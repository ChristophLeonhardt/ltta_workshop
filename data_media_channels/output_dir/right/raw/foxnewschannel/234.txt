1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:03,778
>> GOOD MORNING, JON.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,281
FOR THE 29th FRIDAY IN A ROW

3
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,116
PALESTINIANS ARE PROTESTING

4
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:10,952
ALONG THE ISRAEL/GAZA BORDER.

5
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:11,553
TODAY'S DEMONSTRATIONS

6
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,253
CERTAINLY HAVE INCREASED NOT

7
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:13,521
ONLY IN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

8
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,590
BUT ALSO IN THE TACTICS THAT

9
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:18,359
ARE BEING USED BY PALESTINIAN

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,760
PROTESTORS.

11
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:19,527
WE'VE SEEN DELIBERATE EFFORTS

12
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,963
TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF ISRAELI

13
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:22,697
SNIPERS AND ACTUALLY A NUMBER

14
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:24,465
OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO CROSS THE

15
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,633
BORDER FROM GAZA INTO ISRAEL.

16
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,702
SO FAR FIVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

17
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:29,103
ONE PERSON KILLED RIGHT BY

18
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:29,671
BEHIND US HERE.

19
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,906
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE SCENE.

20
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,876
THE BLACK SMOKE YOU SEE COMING

21
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,178
FROM TIRES SET ON FIRE BY

22
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,146
PALESTINIANS PROTESTORS.

23
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:39,047
YOU'LL HEAR A LOUD EXPLOSION

24
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:41,149
COMING FROM A PIPE BOMB OR

25
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,482
GRENADE.

26
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:44,619
WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF THOSE

27
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:44,919
TODAY.

28
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,991
ANY WHITE SMOKE IS TEAR GAS.

29
00:00:49,992 --> 00:00:51,125
SETTLEMENT TALKS FAILED IN

30
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:51,426
CAIRO.

31
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,494
A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO TRY TO

32
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:54,662
BRING THE ISRAELIS TO THE TABLE

33
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:56,631
AND PALESTINIANS TO THE TABLE.

34
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:57,565
PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK

35
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:01,035
TO TRY TO FIND A LONGER-TERM

36
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:03,037
SETTLEMENT SOLUTIONS THOSE

37
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:04,672
TALKS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL

38
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,975
LEADING TO ISSUES HERE ALONG

39
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:07,675
THE BORDER.

40
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,577
MOVING FORWARD THERE IS SOME

41
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:10,478
HOPE THAT THESE SIDES WILL BE

42
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,181
ABLE TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE.

43
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:15,283
A KEY PROBLEM NOW THOUGH ON THE

44
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:19,454
GAZA STRIP HAVING TO DO WITH

45
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:19,854
ELECTRICITY.

46
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:21,522
MOST PEOPLE HAVE FOUR TO FIVE

47
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:24,859
HOURS OF DAY OF ELECTRICITY AND

48
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,094
RECENTLY THE PALESTINIAN

49
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,128
AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK HAVE

50
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,029
SAID THEY AREN'T WILLING TO

51
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,531
PROVIDE ANY MONEY FOR FUEL TO

52
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:32,166
THE MAIN ELECTRICAL GRID HERE

53
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:32,533
IN GAZA.

54
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,535
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

55
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:35,303
UPSETTING MANY PROTESTORS.

56
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,071
NOT ONLY LOOKING AT A

57
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:38,239
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

58
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,707
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS BUT

59
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,243
ALSO HAMAS LEADERSHIP ON THE

60
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:43,378
GAZA STRIP AND THE PALESTINIAN

61
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,312
AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK

62
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,849
TRYING TO COME TO A SOLUTION

63
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,484
OVER WHAT WE'VE SEEN BEHIND ME

64
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,885
HERE TODAY FOCUSED ON THE

65
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,954
CONFLICT THAT HAS BEEN ERUPTING

66
00:01:52,955 --> 00:00:00,000
EACH FRIDAY SINCE LATE MARCH
