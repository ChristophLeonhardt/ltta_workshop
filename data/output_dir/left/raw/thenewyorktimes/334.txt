1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,590
“Good afternoon.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,410
On my orders, the United States
military has begun strikes

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,050
against Al Qaeda
terrorist training camps

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,120
and military installations
of the Taliban

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,540
regime in Afghanistan.”

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,520
That was the start
of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,330
“We need the freedom to operate
on the ground and in the air.”

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,790
It’s now America’s longest
war — almost 6,000 days long, in fact.

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,790
Yet few battles or notable
events from Afghanistan

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,660
have taken root in
America’s collective memory.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,010
And that means fewer
signposts to mark

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,405
the long passage of time.

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,210
But if we look at how
long it took to reach

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,620
seminal moments in other wars,

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,030
it might bring America’s 16-plus-year presence in Afghanistan

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,190
into clear view.

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,820
We’ll start with the
Battle of Gettysburg.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,520
This bar represents the
number of days the U.S. has

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
been fighting in Afghanistan.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,810
The fighting at Gettysburg began
811 days into the Civil War.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,940
Many consider this the
most important battle

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,200
of the conflict.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,420
And it took place after
half the war was fought.

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,020
Now apply it to
Afghanistan time.

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,410
It would bring us to
just Dec. 27, 2003.

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,040
There were about 13,000
American troops in Afghanistan back then.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,660
That number would
eventually peak at 100,000.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,540
“In England, General Dwight D. Eisenhower
and his deputy commanders

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,030
chart the liberation
of a lost continent.”

30
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,120
Then there’s the Allied
D-Day invasion at Normandy.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,920
One of the most iconic
moments of World War II.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,430
The culmination of
extensive planning in years

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,850
of fighting in Northern
Africa, Italy and elsewhere.

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,950
That invasion began 913 days
after America entered the war.

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,330
In Afghanistan time,

36
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,020
that brings us to
just April 4, 2004.

37
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,630
Hamid Karzai hadn’t even
been elected as president

38
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,220
of Afghanistan yet.

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,810
And when World War
II neared its end

40
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,390
with the atomic bombing
of Hiroshima, that

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,790
came after 1,339 days of
battle. In Afghanistan time,

42
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,340
that would reach to June 2005.

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,770
Not even a quarter of
the way through.

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,910
Vietnam was America’s
second-longest war.

45
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,010
And the final pivotal
moment was the fall

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,190
of Saigon in April 1975.
That occurred 3,706 days

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,520
after U.S. Marines landed
in Da Nang in 1965.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,340
And in a final comparison
to Afghanistan time,

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
that would bring us
to Nov. 30, 2011.

50
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,090
Osama bin Laden was killed
about six months earlier.

51
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,520
And President Obama had
already announced plans

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,920
to completely
withdraw U.S. troops.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,170
He would later
reverse that decision.

54
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,000
The Obama and Trump
administrations

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,200
would unveil new strategies –
continuing the fight, which

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:00:00,000
goes on to this day.
