the Labour Party won the Lucien by-election but the majority has been slashed by three-quarters the Liberal Democrats came second with a swing of over 20% and the UK vote has collapsed the lowest by-election is over it's finally over it's been a month of serious serious campaigning the Liberal Democrats have been really working their asses off to try and do well in this election and they certainly did and the Labour Party has well they won but I wouldn't call it a victory so let's go through the results first of all I gave you my predictions my predictions were a bit off but not completely wrong either I was right in saying the Liberal Democrats will come second but let's take a look at the full results so labour came first with over 11,000 votes and 50% Liberal Democrats got five thousand four hundred and four votes 24.6% Conservatives three thousand one hundred and sixty-one 14.4% Green 788 three point six percent women's equality 506 two point three percent you Kip three hundred and eighty one point seven percent for Britain two hundred and sixty-six one point two percent Christian people's one six eight nine point eight percent then you've got the monster raving loon YZ then the Democrats and veterans then libertarian then the independent then radical then young people's interesting stuff the the first thing that struck me was I went to the count last night to watch this thing unfold I love counts and watching the amount of votes coming in for the women's equality party was just amazing to see who are these people that are voting for a party that is campaigning for rights that already exist I don't understand it I mean there's a couple of explanations one Lucien East is a very left-wing constituency there's a lot of young hipster sort of types there so they picked up the feminist vote obviously but I think there was something else at play as well and that's the people who turned up so 14 candidates wanted a protest vote and wanted to choose Lily the one that looked the least offensive and what looks terrible what looks bad what could be wrong with women's equality so that's probably had a part to play in it surprised to see the Greens maintaining a vote of 788 it's about the same as last time they got 803 votes in 2017 and although in 2015 the Greens got 2429 which is interesting one thing I haven't mentioned yet actually is that the turnout for this election was abysmal the turnout was 22050 six people which is 33.3% that's compared to 69 point three percent in 2017 and sixty-four point one percent in 2015 so people are obviously tired of elections but maybe people are just tired of politics now the Labour Party's majority has got is now five thousand six hundred and twenty-nine compared to their previous majority of twenty one thousand if we look back it's been a long time since the majority was that small I mean back in 2005 the majority was six thousand for labour but then in 2001 it was nine thousand you know it's it's really astonishing to see and the Liberal Democrats have really worked hard what does that tell us well I think it tells us that there are lots of vocal remain is still out there who are unhappy with Jeremy Corbyn because they think he's too much of a heartbreaker you know the Janet Darby stood up at the end when she won and said that she was opposed to a hard Bragg's it meaning she's opposed to the will of the people one thing actually she did do when she stood up and made her acceptance speech she says I stand here as a proud black woman and everybody went and I'm looking around thinking what like is this an achievement now being black is an achievement you know Janet Davey has got nothing to be proud of she's literally a diversity hire she only got this job because she was putting an all black or women or ethnic minority shortlist she's got nothing to be proud of she's not by intelligent I don't think she's gonna be particularly very good MP and she stood up on stage and said I'm gonna fight my hardest for the people of Lewisham yeah you mean that your party has done for us 26 years and there's still a housing crisis and the the interest of local people are not being represented I mean oh it's just amazing to see that people still vote for these people they still vote for them there was another battle going on not just the battle for second place but there was a battle between UK and for Britain and what I've said before is that if for Britain beat you Kipp then it would be significant if you keep beats for Britain then it's insignificant the reason I say that is you Kipp is a long-established political it's a big brand name people know who they are and to beat a brand new party is not significant whereas if for britain beats an established party then it would be interesting for britain didn't beat you Kip but it wasn't by a tremendous amount you keep got three hundred and eighty votes for britain got two hundred and sixty six a fair effort by Amory waters and for Britain I mean this was a very very difficult Ward for you Kip and for for Britain but the interesting thing about you keep is I've seen people saying online oh you keep vote increased well technically increased him percentage-wise by nought point one percent which is first nothing to write home about but secondly let's look at the real numbers you give got three hundred and eighty votes in 2017 you keep got seven hundred and ninety eight votes so that's half are almost half of what they got last time in 2015 when a memory water stood for you Kip she got almost four thousand votes so you could come from four thousand to eight hundred to three hundred and eighty what does that tell you people are losing interest in you Kip and it's not the only Tut it's not the only proof that we have that you keep a struggling I mean simply look at the council election results they lost over a hundred councillors in the recent council results people are losing interest apart is going to lose its MEP is next year I don't know how a party's you can survive it I don't know how part you can survive that in my eyes it is a death spiral I've said this multiple times before it's a death spiral and I can't see them recovering from it so there we are you keep vote halved the Tories pushed down to third labour wins but with a hugely slashed majority and a turnout of 33.3% I don't think really I think the only people that can call this a victory are actually the Liberal Democrats who've managed to I mean five thousand four hundred for votes they've more than doubled their vote share from last time and comes second and push the Tories to third they could call it a victory but I don't think it means much because Louie chamise is a very interesting constituency in London itself is very different from the rest of the country so I'm looking now it will be interesting to see if another by-election comes along somewhere else maybe up north up north would be interesting because that's really the heart of average normal person's a normal people's opinion is is up north and in working communities London's a very very weird place so yeah there we are democracy in action if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe and download the new rebel app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store you
