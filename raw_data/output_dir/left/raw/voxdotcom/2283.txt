1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:09,110
That’s my wife. And she’s pregnant.When
you have a baby, there are lots of costs to

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,230
consider. Isabel: Carseat, and a bassinet,
a baby carrier, thermometer. Johnny: Wait,

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,310
wait, but how much is the actual hospital
birth going to cost?

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,010
Healthcare in the US is significantly more
expensive than in other countries. Some experts

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,769
say that this is partly because consumers
don’t go around looking for prices comparing

6
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,670
them between hospitals. Like they do when
they buy a car or anything else for that matter.

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,350
So I decided it’d try it out. And see if
there was any way to discover in advance how

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,100
much we would be paying for our baby’s birth.
What happens next is at once depressing and

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,820
horrifying, showing how broken and expensive
the American health care system is.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,300
There's no way I'm the only person who's ever
had this question. Childbirth in the US is

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,570
the number one reason why people go to the
hospital. Almost 4 million women are going

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,040
to give birth this year and most births are
relatively uncomplicated. So you would think

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,460
that with such a common procedure the price
would be generally well known.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,080
VO: I wanted to know how much child birth
usually costs, so I did what any good child

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,950
of the internet would do

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,150
I found this really disturbing study from
the Yale medical school .It analyzed almost

17
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,380
800,000 low risk deliveries in the US, looking
for the variation in cost just for the facilities,

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,240
meaning the hospital rooms and supplies and
stuff like that.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,940
For just the cost of the hospital room, this
study found that the price varied between

20
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:41,310
$1,189 and $11,986. So I realized I am going
to have to go ask the specific hospital where

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,940
my wife is giving birth figure this out. Every
hospital has a giant list they call the chargemaster

22
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,460
which details all the services they provide
and what they cost. And each item and service

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,340
in the hospital has a code. If a doctor spends
20 minutes with you, that’s a different

24
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,090
code and a different price than if they spent
40 minutes with you. Your insurance company

25
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,760
then negotiates a lower price for every single
item on the list. So when my wife goes into

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,680
the hospital, The nurses have a bar code scanner
that they use to scan every item she will

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,600
use. Everything from the IV tubes to the Ibuprofen
gets scanned onto the bill. At the end of

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,630
it all, they put all the codes and prices
onto one piece of paper which they call a

29
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,400
“claim" and send it off the insurance. The
insurance looks at it and pays a certain percentage

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,500
of it based on my policy. The hospital then
sends the remaining balance to me. So I figured

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,990
if I could get my hands on that master list
of prices I could add up the price of the

32
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,810
delivery. Right? Well it wasn’t that easy.
I called the hospital where Isabel is going

33
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,930
to give birth and got a message machine. So
I decided to call a some other hospitals to

34
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:56,520
see if anyone could give me general pricing
information about the cost of birth. So my

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,980
wife is pregnant. My wife is pregnant. My
wife will be giving birth. My wife's pregnant

36
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,010
and I'm trying to get an idea of how much
different services cost. Items that would

37
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,860
be on a bill. Different costs associated with
labor and delivery. Hospital: One moment.

38
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,270
Ok give me one moment let me talk to my team
lead. Certainly, let me connect you with the

39
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,750
billing office. I can connect you with our
financial coordinator. What I'll have to do

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,430
is transfer you to the pricing line. I can
transfer you. Johnny: So now I'm being transferred

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:28,060
to another line. Or something. I don't know.
They're transferring me somewhere.

42
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,629
Answer the phone. Message Machine: I will be out
of the office until Monday February 18th.

43
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:39,959
Johnny: I'm going to hang up and try this
again. Message Machine: You've reached the

44
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:53,290
voicemail of Patient Priceline. I will be
out of the office until February 18th. Johnny:

45
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,970
Everyone's out of the office. All agents are
currently busy with other customers. Currently,

46
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:08,160
all of our operators are busy. I'm sorry,
extension 59 didn't answer. Mash up of hold

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:21,079
messages. Johnny: No music this time? I just
have to sit her on hold with no music. I'm

48
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,059
just trying to see if I can get a number.
Hospital: You will not get a copy of that

49
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:31,509
until after the procedure. Johnny: Ok. Do
you have that information though in terms

50
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:39,139
of like how much certain items cost? Hospital:
no, um they will not present the cost until

51
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,430
after. Johnny: So there's literally no way
for me to discover what the cost is until

52
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,150
after I buy is that right? Hospital: We do
not keep that information on hand. Everything

53
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,599
is processed after. Johnny: Certainly that
information exists in your hospital system

54
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,830
somewhere. Hospital: The itemized copy, all
of that information is done after the procedure,

55
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,330
not before. Johnny: I haven't heard a single
number from anyone about how much anything

56
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:12,240
costs. This is actually starting to become
frustrating. Finally, after two weeks and

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,020
thirty phone calls I got ahold of a pricing
consultant from the hospital where Isabel's

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,009
going to give birth. I finally just got a
call back from a pricing consultant I wasn't

59
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,990
able to record it because she called me out
of the blue. She had taken down all my insurance

60
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,979
information and was able to run it through
her system and come up with an estimate quote.

61
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:35,270
And finally for the first time in two weeks,
I heard a number. She said I would be paying

62
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,039
$347 for my wife's birth. She wasn't able
to give me a breakdown of what that meant

63
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,569
or any items specifically. She was able to
only give me that number. And when I pushed

64
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:52,229
on certain items she said she frankly didn't
know. Apparently prices in a hospital are

65
00:05:52,229 --> 00:06:00,889
beyond even a pricing consultant. And then
one day, this happened. I think Izzy may be

66
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,569
going into labor. Here we go.

67
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,819
I forgot about
healthcare prices for a moment and watched

68
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:23,180
my amazing wife go through a night of painful
labor. She was the hero of the night and at

69
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:32,059
the end of it, we had a new member of our
little family. Oliver was born with no complications

70
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,740
and a two day stay in the hospital. All very
typical.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,100
Well, I got the bill back in the mail

72
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:53,120
The insurance negotiated a lower--[Oliver
cries]. So the bill that came to us--[Oliver

73
00:06:53,129 --> 00:07:00,439
cries] So the bill that came to -- [Oliver
cries]. Isabel: We got the final bill back

74
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,099
and the hospital charged sixteen thousand
dollars. The negotiated price with the insurance

75
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:12,099
company was eight thousand dollars. They covered
90% of it and sent us the bill for $841 dollars.

76
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:18,649
Johnny: That's 500 dollars more than the pricing
consultant quotes me for a typical, uncomplicated

77
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:23,759
birth which is what Isabel had. Our healthcare
system suffers from a big problem which is

78
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,999
that there's huge variation in costs. But
what seems to be the bigger problem is that

79
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:34,830
us consumers have no tools to find out where
we fall in that pricing variation. The hospital

80
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,089
down the street could be a fairly cheap hospital
or it could be an extremely expensive one--it

81
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:42,909
could be 10 time more expensive than the cheap
ones. You have no idea and there's no way

82
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,779
to tell. And hopefully someday this will change.
But in the meantime, we got a really cute

83
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,280
baby out of this whole thing. So, I'm not
complaining.

84
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,620
Thank you for for calling the patient Priceline.
At this time we are assisting other callers.

85
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:10,050
But your call is important to us. Please speak
clearly and leave your name and a number where

86
00:08:10,050 --> 00:00:00,000
you can be reached and someone will return
your call within...
