it's been an incredibly busy hectic day for Vladimir Putin between all the talks negotiations conferences and press conferences they talked about a whole host of issues and themes that have worried Russia and Austria of course one of them being sanctions we any politically motivated restrictions and protectionism these tools for resolving political issues are in the end useless in achieving the ultimate goal they are damaging for both sides and I think that everyone's interested in lifting these sanctions Russia included we realized that it's difficult for individual countries to voice that and you know the reasons why however this doesn't stop us from developing ties with Austria it can indeed be difficult to voice an independent position in Europe on the sanctions against Russia for a variety of reasons one of them being that the United States has kept up pressure in European states to keep the sanctions up another reason might be going against the flow Europe has an established position and the Austrian Chancellor himself said that as his country assumes chairmanship of the Council of Europe Council of the European Union that he won't rebel and lift sanctions against Russia but he did admit that these are tough times and Austria would do what it could to defuse the situation Austria and Russia have traditionally had very close relations and they've been able to talk about things that they disagree on sometimes drastically but in this case today we heard them talking about Syria Austria pledging to help of the humanitarian crisis there they talked about resolving the crisis in Ukraine and the Austrian Chancellor himself said that Russia is a part of Europe and many problems in Europe won't be solved without Russian participation and he's being backed by other new European leaders my pinfu honor that he will support opening our to Russia which has consolidated our which has consolidated its international role in various geopolitical crises in recent years we will push for a review of the sanctions system starting with those that risk punishing the russian civil society another reason for this newfound the eagerness to make up with Russia could be the fraying relationship with the United States the unpredictability of Donald Trump Washington has slapped new tariffs on European companies on European goods and that has incensed leaders all over the continent so making up with Russia could be not only of political but also a financial sense take for example liquefied natural gas that that the United States has been thrusting on Europe that doesn't make much financial sense says the Austrian president said recently there's been some let's call it reproach in the part of some American politicians who suggest that the use too dependent on Russian gas but the fact that's been overlooked is that American liquid gas if I'm not mistaken is true if not three times more expensive than Russian gas so it makes a little sense from purely economic perspective to replace Russian gas with American liquid gas to be blunt there shouldn't be any expectation of sanctions against Russia being lifted any anytime soon overnight though in the foreseeable future but what we heard today as well in the in the weeks preceding this this meeting of these meetings is that the currents in Europe are shifting
