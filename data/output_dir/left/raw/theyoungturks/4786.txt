1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,049
I READ EARLIER

2
00:00:01,049 --> 00:00:06,270
TODAY THAT ROBERT MUELLER HAD
MET WITH THE HEADS OF THE SENATE

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,850
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,420
WE ALL
WONDERED WHAT IS IT THEY

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,559
DISCUSSED.

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,220
IT SEEMS IT HAS BEEN
REVEALED THAT THE SPECIAL

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,720
COUNSEL WILL BE INVESTIGATING
TRUMP PERSONALLY FOR POSSIBLE

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,650
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,019
I DON'T
KNOW WHAT KIND OF CASE HE COULD

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,439
POSSIBLY HAVE AT THIS POINT.

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,540
THE
AMBIGUITY HE PUT OUT OVER THE

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,210
PAST 48 HOURS WAS DESIGNED TO
PUT PRESSURE ON THE SPECIAL

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,359
COUNSEL TO QUICKLY SWEEP THE
ENTIRE THING UNDER THE RUG,

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,739
WHICH IS BY ITSELF OBSTRUCTION

15
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,559
OF JUSTICE.

16
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,940
I'M NOT SURPRISED BY
THIS, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THE

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,940
SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,649
INVESTIGATING THIS WHOLE TIME.

19
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,890
BUT NOW IT IS OUT THERE THAT IT
WILL BE ONE OF THE COMPONENTS

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,890
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,890
I FEEL LIKE IF THERE IS

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,890
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WHY FIRE

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,399
JAMES COMEY?

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,910
WHY FOOT WITH THE
IDEA OF FIRING ROBERT MUELLER?

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:19,970
EVERYTHING SEEMS STRANGE TO
ME.IT DOES MAKE PEOPLE MORE

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,300
SUSPICIOUS.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,730
IF I WAS BEING
INVESTIGATED FOR HAVING

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,220
QUESTIONABLE TIES TO RUSSIA I
WOULD SAY LOOK THROUGH MY EMAIL

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,210
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT.

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,900
IT IS STRANGE HOW FAR HE IS
GOING AND TRYING TO DO AWAY

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,060
IT IS ALSO DONALD TRUMP WHO
HAS SAID ON RECORD NOT FORGIVE,

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,290
NOT FORGET.

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,570
HE REALLY GOES AFTER

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,250
PEOPLE WHO FUCK HIM OVER.

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,970
HE
WILL GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,330
FOR REVENGE.

38
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,450
I THINK TRUMP IS
STUPID ENOUGH TO FIRE SOMEONE

39
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,490
AND NOT REALIZE IT IS
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,490
HOW

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,490
GREAT WOULD IT BE IF HE WAS

42
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,250
IMPEACHED OVER THIS?

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,541
JUST HIM
FIRING THIS GUY THAT THAT COULD

44
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,538
ACTUALLY GET HIM FIRED.

45
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,000
IT'S AMAZING.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,210
IT COULD BE THAT HAS MESSED
UP PSYCHOLOGY MAKES HIM LOOK

47
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,780
CONSTANTLY LIKE A PERSON WHO WAS
DOING INCREDIBLY SUSPICIOUS

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
THINGS.

49
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,960
BUT WE CAN LOOK AT HAVE
CIRCLE TOO.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:34,410
SESSIONS WAS 
ALSO

51
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:42,200
BEING INCREDIBLY SUSPICIOUS.

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,360
ALSO HIS REFUSAL TO RELEASE
TAX RETURNS, IT ALL KINDS OF

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,540
PLAYS INTO THE LARGER PUZZLE.

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,030
IF
YOU WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO

55
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,790
GO AWAY THE BEST THING FOR YOU
TO DO IS COOPERATE WITH THE

56
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,850
INVESTIGATION, AND IT
WILL GO AWAY.

57
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,290
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BEFORE ñ
DEMOCRATS HAVE A POOR ABILITY TO

58
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,530
EXPLAIN WHAT THE RUSSIA

59
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,470
COLLUSION IS.

60
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,520
BUT REALLY IT IS
MOST LIKELY THAT TRUMP JUST AS

61
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,850
BUSINESS DEALINGS AND SOME SORT
OF COLLUSION FINANCIALLY.

62
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,850
SO WHY

63
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,850
NOT JUST SAY THAT?

64
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:32,940
I LOVE THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT
UP ñ I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,720
CONFUSED AND HAVE DIFFERENT
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WHOLE

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,980
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

67
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,069
SOME
PEOPLE THINK DID RUSSIA HACK

68
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,760
INTO OUR SYSTEM AND CHANGE
VOTES?

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,270
I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE

70
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,160
FAILING AT CLEAR AND CONCISE
MESSAGING AS TO WHAT THEY THINK

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,930
THE REAL ISSUE IS.

72
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,910
I ARGUE THE
REAL ISSUE IS MORE OF A CONFLICT

73
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,599
OF INTEREST ISSUE.

74
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,480
EVEN BEFORE
TRUMP GOT ELECTED, I BELIEVE IT

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,800
WAS MICHAEL PUBLISHED A PIECE ON
TRUMPS FINANCIAL TIES TO RUSSIA.

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,709
IF YOU OWE RUSSIA MONEY ARE YOU
MORE LIKELY TO PUSH FOR POLICIES

77
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,358
THAT FAVOR RUSSIA AS OPPOSED TO

78
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,358
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

79
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,668
THOSE ARE
ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED

80
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,069
INTO.

81
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:30,900
DEMOCRATS SHOULD FOCUS ON
AND DO BETTER MESSAGING.

82
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
BY

83
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,110
SAYING COLLUSION ñ MOST PEOPLE

84
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,270
DON'T KNOW WHAT COLLUSION IS.

85
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,130
OR
SAYING HACKING, WHAT DO YOU MEAN

86
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,139
BY HACKING?

87
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:45,229
IN REALITY I THINK
IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING BUT I

88
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,159
DO NOT BELIEVE FOR A SECOND THAT
RUSSIA HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH

89
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,360
THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,559
THE
HILLARY SUPPORTERS THAT KEEP

91
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,770
PUSHING THAT NARRATIVE ARE

92
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,770
RIDICULOUS.

93
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,380
HILLARY NEEDS TO
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT AND

94
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,389
SO DO YOU GUYS.

95
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,509
MORE THAN
ANYTHING, FOCUS ON WHITE AS THE

96
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,090
DEMOCRATS LOST AND DO BEHAVIOR
CORRECTION THERE.

97
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,309
IN TERMS OF TRUMPS COLLUSION,
HE IS COLLUSION WITH EVERY

98
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,309
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

99
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:12,309
HE IS THE

100
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:19,370
FIRST BONA FIDE BRAND.

101
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,710
I WISH
TRUMP ACTUALLY REVERSES SOME OF

102
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,339
THE POLICIES.

103
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,510
THE COLD WAR IS RESURRECTED.

104
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,320
THAT WAS THE ONE GOOD THING I
THOUGHT WOULD COME OUT OF HIS

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:45,020
PRESIDENCY, SOME NORMALIZATION
WITH RUSSIA, INSTEAD 

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,099
IT IS THE

107
00:05:50,099 --> 00:00:00,000
OPPOSITE.
