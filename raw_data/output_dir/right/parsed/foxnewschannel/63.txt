OVER ANYTIME SOON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
A NEW "WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL
SHOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP SETTING A
NEW APPROVAL RECORD, THOUGH HE
IS STILL SLIGHTLY UNDER WATER AT
47% APPROVAL, 49% DISAPPROVAL.
NEVERTHELESS, THE FOR THE G.O.P.
THE TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER.
THE FINDINGS POINT TO AN
ENERGIZED ELECTORATE,
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" POINTS
OUT THAT BUFFETED BY DYNAMICS
THAT BRING GREAT UNCERTAINTY TO
THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION JUST
TWO WEEKS AWAY.
LET'S BRING IN FOX NEWS SENIOR
POLITICAL ANALYST BRIT HUME TO
DISCUSS.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
>> THANK YOU, GLAD TO BE HERE.
>> Shannon: IT'S ODD FOR THE
PRESIDENT AND FOR HIS BACKERS TO
BE CELEBRATING.
HE STILL UNDERWATER, BUT FOR HIM
THIS IS A PEEK AT HIS APPROVAL
RATING AT ITS JUST HEADING TO
THE MIDTERMS, IS HE PEAKING AT
THE RIGHT TIME?
>> PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL RATINGS
MATTER IN MIDTERMS, PARTICULARLY
A PRESIDENTS FIRST MIDTERM.
IT DOES APPEAR FROM NOT JUST
THIS "WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL
BUT OTHER POLLS THAT THE
APPROVAL RATING HAS TICKED UP A
BIT.
IT IS STILL, AS
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"
INDICATES UNDERWATER.
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS AND
THAT DOES HELP REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES IN THIS UPCOMING
ELECTION FOR SURE.
>> Shannon:
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" SAYS
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
THERE'S BEEN DISCLOSURE IN KEY
SWING DISTRICTS.
THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THIS GAP HAS
CLOSED UP.
IF THEY SAY IN DISTRICTS RATED
AS THE MOST COMPETITIVE BY THE
NONPARTISAN POLITICAL REPORT THE
PARTIES ARE DEAD EVEN ON THE
QUESTION OF WHICH ONE SHOULD
CONTROL CONGRESS.
THE LAST ONE DEMOCRAT LEAD THAT
SAME QUESTION BY 13 PERCENTAGE
POINTS AMONG REGISTERED VOTERS
IN SIX POINTS AMONG LIKELY
VOTERS.
FOR THE G.O.P., THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT APP YOU WANT TO SEE A
CLOSE.
>> TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER, RACE
IS TIGHT AND AS YOU GET CLOSER
TO ELECTION DAY, THAT'S USUALLY
THE PATTERN BUT CLEARLY THERE
WAS A KAVANAUGH EFFECT ON
REPUBLICAN VOTERS AND PERHAPS TO
SOME EXTENT ON DEMOCRATIC VOTERS
BUT DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE SO
MOTIVATED ALREADY IT'S A LITTLE
HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY
GOT MUCH EXTRA OUT OF THAT.
THEY WERE HYPED UP TO VOTE.
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE G.O.P.
VOTERS MAY NOW FEEL THAT WAY AS
WELL AND I'M HEARING A LOT THAT
TRUMP HAS A HARD CORE SUPPORTERS
FROM WHOM HE CAN DO NOTHING
WRONG, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER
CATEGORY OF VOTERS AND A RUNNING
TO THEM ALL THE TIME WHEN I'M
AWAY FROM WASHINGTON WHO SAY
THINGS LIKE I DON'T LIKE THIS
GUY BUT I LOVE WHAT HE'S DOING.
I HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME FROM
VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF
PEOPLE IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS AND I THINK THAT'S A
FACTOR OUT THERE AND IT MAY THEN
THEREFORE -- IT MAY BE SHOWING
UP AT HIS APPROVAL RATING TO
SOME EXTENT AND IT MAY SHOW UP
IN SUPPORT FOR CONGRESSIONAL
CANDIDATES RUNNING AS
REPUBLICANS.
>> Shannon: SOMEONE SAID THE
EXACT SAME THING LAST WEEK.
THEY WERE VERY AWARE OF WHAT HE
WAS DOING, BUSINESS OWNER,
FEDERAL JUDGES, THE BENCH.
PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT MADE ABOUT
SUBURBAN WOMEN, FEMALE MOTHERS,
FAMILIES, HOW THEY WOULD VOTE.
THE POLL MAY EXPLAIN WHY THE
COMPETITIVE SWING DISTRICTS THAT
WILL DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE
HOUSE ARE MOSTLY IN SUBURBAN
DISTRICTS AND AMONG SUBURBAN
RESIDENTS THE PARTIES ARE
VIRTUALLY TIED.
44% FAVOR G.O.P. CONTROL AND 45
FAVORITE DEMOCRAT.
>> THAT WAS THE FACT THAT WHILE
THE PRESIDENT DON'T DO TOO WELL
AMONG WOMEN PRESSURE,
PARTICULARLY SUBURBAN WOMEN,
THEY DO QUITE WELL AMONG
SUBURBAN MEN.
IT MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET
THAT ADVANTAGE.
THIS COULD TURN OUT TO BE, EVEN
IN THE HOUSE, A MUCH CLOSER
AFFAIR THAN WE'VE IMAGINED.
>> Shannon: WE ARE BITING HER
NAILS.
>> WE GOT A LITTLE WHILE TO GO.
>> Shannon: TWO WEEKS IN
POLITICS CAN BE AN ETERNITY.
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY SCANDALS WILL
ERUPT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE
IMPACT ON THE HOUSE BECAUSE IF
THE DEMOCRATS RETAKE IT A LOT OF
THINGS WILL CHANGE.
A LOT OF THESE ARE THE
INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON LEAD BY
DEVON TUNIS, OTHER TOP
REPUBLICANS, MARK MEADOWS, JIM
JORDAN AND OTHERS.
BYRON YORK WRITES A VERY
INTERESTING PIECE AND HE POINTS
AT THE THINGS THAT AMERICA
WOULDN'T KNOW IF NOT FOR THESE
INVESTIGATIONS.
JUST A PARTIAL LIST WE HAVE
HERE, THE ROLE THAT THAT DOSSIER
PLAYED IN THE FBI INVESTIGATION,
WHO FUNDED THE DOSSIER, THE
ANTI-TRUMP BIAS OF SOME OF THE
TOP FBI OFFICIALS INVOLVED WITH
THIS WHOLE THING.
OBAMA OFFICIALS UNMASKING FROM
PROFESSIONALS AND INTEL
INTERCEPTS AND THE ROLE OF
FUSION GPS.
>> THAT'S A PRETTY EXTENSIVE
LIST AND THOSE ARE ALL THINGS
THAT WERE UNCOVERED BY THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE UNDER
DEVIN NUNES WHICH CARRIED ON ITS
INVESTIGATION, STERN AND
UNFLINCHING DEMOCRATIC
RESISTANCE, EVERYTHING THEY DID
WITH ADAM SCHIFF, RANKING
DEMOCRAT ON THE COMMITTEE
RUNNING OUT TO THE CAMERAS AND
MICROPHONES ALL THE TIME WITH A
VERY SYMPATHETIC MEDIA AUDIENCE
AND THE COMMITTEE WAS ABLE TO
UNEARTH ALL THAT STUFF AND WE
WOULDN'T KNOW IT WITHOUT IT.
WHAT IS SURPRISING TO ME IS THE
ANTIPATHY TOWARDS HIM NOT JUST
AMONG LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS
WHICH WOULD KIND OF EXPECT BUT
EVEN AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS.
AND I THINK HE'S BEEN UNFAIRLY
MALIGNED IN THE MEDIA COVERAGE,
IT'S BEEN ATROCIOUS.
>> Shannon: IT'S NOT JUST THAT
THESE INVESTIGATIONS WOULD GRIND
TO A SCREECHING HALT.
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THE
PRESIDENT WOULD ACTUALLY THEN BE
A TARGET AND?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD
BE A CONSTANT TARGET.
IF DEMOCRATS GET CONTROL OF THE
HOUSE, I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEY
WILL TRY TO IMPEACH THEM.
SOME MEMBERS WILL WANT TO, I'M
NOT SURE HOW FAR THAT WILL GO,
BUT THERE WILL BE AN ENDLESS
SERIES OF INVESTIGATION AND
CHARGES IN TESTIMONY AND UNLIKE
THE DEVIN NUNES INVESTIGATION
THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL LIKELY
