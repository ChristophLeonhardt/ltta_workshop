<font color="#CCCCCC">he looks he's like all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right here's</font>

87
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,840
today what I choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no I think it's</font>

88
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a default setting or any and all</font>

89
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,390
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump into his mind he will</font>

90
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,819
run through his personal filter of well

91
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,790
I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best right thus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dot-dot-dot</font>

92
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,410
and he just Chuck's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out at everything</font>

93
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">I I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he he doesn't really have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know that Rosie I'm better than everyone</font>

96
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,340
you know perspective on himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

97
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,230
for sure but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than anything</font>

98
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,829
he just speaks as he's thinking

99
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,209
whatever's coming to his mind he just

100
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">says it whereas I think most people give</font>

101
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,609
themselves a beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really think about</font>
