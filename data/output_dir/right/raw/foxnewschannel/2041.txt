IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY AND

THIS IS "THE FIVE" ."

00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:11,705
YET ANOTHER STORM IN WASHINGTON

ADMINISTRATION SOURCES CONFIRM

15
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,655
GINA HASPEL IS WILLING TO

WITHDRAW ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY

00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:31,858

PROGRAM.

20
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,696
THE WHITE HOUSE IS FIRMLY

21
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,064
STANDING BEHIND HER.

22
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,466
>> SHE DESERVES QUICK

23
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:40,234
CONFIRMATION WITHOUT PARTISAN

24
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:41,268
THEATRICS.

25
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:43,870
THE BOTTOM LINE, ACTING DIRECTOR

26
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,105
HASPEL HAS AN UNPARALLELED

27
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:45,872
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIA AND IS

28
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:48,075
THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD THEM

29
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:49,276
DURING THESE DANGEROUS TIMES.

30
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:50,077
SHE WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING SHE

31
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:51,511
CAN TO MAKE SURE THE INTEGRITY

32
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:57,651
OF THE CIA REMAINS INTACT, ISN'T

33
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,653
UNNECESSARILY ATTACKED, AND IF

34
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:01,054
SHE FELT THAT HER NOMINATION

35
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:03,657
WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM FOR

36
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:05,058
THEM FOR THE AGENCY, THEN SHE

37
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:06,860
WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING SHE

38
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,262
COULD TO PROTECT THE AGENCY.

39
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:09,563
AT THE SAME TIME, SHE WANTS TO

40
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:11,398
DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO PROTECT

41
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,267
THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF

42
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:16,470
AMERICANS, WHICH IS WHY SHE IS

43
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,971
100% COMMITTED TO GOING THROUGH

44
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,874
THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

45
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:21,942
>> Kimberly: THE PRESIDENT

46
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:25,479
TWEETED HIS SUPPORT EARLIER.

47
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,213
"MY HIGHLY RESPECTED NOMINEE FOR

48
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:26,913
CIA DIRECTOR, GINA HASPEL, HAS

49
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:27,648
COME UNDER FIRE BECAUSE SHE WAS

50
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:28,248
TOO TOUGH ON TERRORISTS.

51
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:28,915
THINK OF THAT, IN THESE VERY

52
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:29,616
DANGEROUS TIMES, WE HAVE THE

53
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:30,651
MOST QUALIFIED PERSON, A WOMAN,

54
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:31,718
WHO DEMOCRATS WANT OUT BECAUSE

55
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,654
SHE IS TOO TOUGH ON TERROR.

56
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:39,293
WIN GINA!"

57
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:40,160
EVEN PEOPLE WHO USED TOLD US

58
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,228
ROLE THINK SHE'S THE RIGHT FIT

59
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,864
FOR THE JOB.

60
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:46,199
>> WITH A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T

61
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,467
ALWAYS ATTACH HIS DECISIONS TO

62
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,870
THE REAL WORLD, TO DATA,

63
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,072
EVIDENCE, GINA HASPEL IS THE ONE

64
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,141
WOMAN I WANT IN THAT ROOM WHEN

65
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:59,846
EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE GOING INTO

66
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:00,647
SAYING YOU ARE RIGHT, BOSS.

67
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,916
GINA HASPEL WON'T.

68
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,252
>> Kimberly: COMING OUT IN

69
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:06,453
STRONG SUPPORT OF GINA HASPEL

70
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:07,387
SAYING THIS IS THE EXACT PERSON

71
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:09,256
YOU WANT IN THE ROOM AND MAKING

72
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,457
THE DECISIONS IN THESE TOUGH

73
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:13,660
TIMES, DEALING WITH TERROR.

74
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,262
>> Greg: I WOULD CALL THAT A

75
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:16,063
BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT.

76
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,497
WE NEED TO HAVE HER BECAUSE THE

77
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,066
PRESIDENT IS CRAZY IS BASICALLY

78
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,267
WHAT HE SAID.

79
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,470
I WONDER, WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS

80
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:23,904
WANT?

81
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:24,805
THEY NEVER WANT AN ADULT.

82
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:27,474
WHO DO THEY WANT?

83
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:28,275
DR. PHIL.

84
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,242
APPARENTLY THEY DON'T THINK A

85
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,845
WOMAN WHO CAN DO THE JOB.

86
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,246
IF THEY CAN DO THAT TO

87
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:35,115
REPUBLICANS, REPUBLICANS CAN DO

88
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:35,649
THAT BACK.

89
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:38,352
THIS IS A BYPRODUCT OF TEAM

90
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:39,086
SPORT POLITICS.

91
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:40,921
THE OTHER TEAM CANNOT MAKE IT

92
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,090
EASY FOR YOUR NOMINATIONS TO GET

93
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,890
THROUGH.

94
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,492
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

95
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,727
QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERTISE OR

96
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:47,127
TALENT.

97
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:48,061
THEY HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU

98
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,696
ARE NOT ON THE SAME TEAM.

99
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:52,366
THE OTHER THING, THE LONG-TERM

100
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:55,435
CONSEQUENCES OF STUFF LIKE THIS,

101
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:57,904
YOU WILL BE PUNISHED IN THE

102
00:02:57,904 --> 00:02:58,939
FUTURE FOR THE BRAVE CHOICES YOU

103
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,439
MAKE IN THE PAST.

104
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,675
HOW WILL IT INFLUENCE

105
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:02,876
PRESENT-DAY PATRIOTS WHEN THEY

106
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:05,078
HAVE TO DO WITH REALLY, REALLY

107
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,380
TOUGH CHOICES IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

108
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,882
BEING THREATENED OR IT COULD BE

109
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:09,616
AN IMPENDING ATTACK AND YOU HAVE

110
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:12,919
TO DECIDE WELL, AM I GOING TO

111
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,687
SACRIFICE MY FUTURE AND MAKE A

112
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,456
DECISION THAT COULD BE LOOKED

113
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,624
UPON LATER AS ILLEGAL?

114
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:20,494
OR DO I JUST NOT DO THAT AND

115
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,795
JUST MAKE THE WORLD LESS SAFE

116
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:22,062
NOW?

117
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,864
THAT'S THE THING THAT SCARES

118
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:24,464
NAME.

119
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:25,699
>> Kimberly: SO TRUE.

120
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,501
WHAT ARE THEY EXPECTING, THE

121
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:27,868
DEMOCRATS.

122
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:28,869
GOING TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT

123
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:30,370
PERHAPS THEY THINK IS OKAY

124
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,671
BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO IS PUT IN

125
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,773
CHARGE OF TERRORISM AND MAKING

126
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:37,277
SURE WE KEEP AMERICA SAFE SEEMS

127
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,278
TOO TOUGH ON TERRORISTS?

128
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:39,913
>> Dana: I THINK THE PRESIDENT

129
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:40,814
HAS HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF

130
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:44,951
WERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ON

131
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,086
THIS.

132
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:48,088
WE HAVE PROVEN THAT AGAIN AND

133
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:50,056
AGAIN, BEING TOUGH ON TERROR.

134
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:51,925
JOHN BRENNAN, WHO WAS A SUPERIOR

135
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,127
TO GINA HASPEL, WAS CONFIRMED TO

136
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,595
BE CIA DIRECTOR, AND HE DID NOT

137
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:57,497
GO THROUGH THIS KIND OF

138
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:57,864
SCRUTINY.

139
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:00,033
ON SO THE FACT THAT SHE HAS COME

140
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,135
UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES LEAVE

141
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,270
A LOT OF ROOM FOR QUESTIONS AND

142
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,105
HOMES OF THE STRATEGY

143
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:05,539
POLITICALLY.

144
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,375
JUST A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT HER.

145
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,377
AFTER 9/11, SHE WAS ONE OF THE

146
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:11,845
MEN AND WOMEN THAT WERE ASKED TO

147
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:13,713
DO REALLY TOUGH THINGS.

148
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,882
SHE WASN'T THE LAWYER.

149
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,285
SHE WAS THE INTELLIGENCE

150
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:18,652
OPERATOR.

151
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:19,886
THE LAWYERS AT THE JUSTICE

152
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:20,620
DEPARTMENT DELIBERATE OVER ALL

153
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,389
OF THIS, AND THEY SAY HERE'S

154
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,757
WHERE THE LAW IS.

155
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:25,592
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO

156
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:30,063
EMPOWER TERRORISTS THAN TO TAKE

157
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,665
OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN

158
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,500
INTELLIGENCE, WHAT GREG WAS

159
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,167
SAYING, BASICALLY MAKE THEM

160
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,670
SECOND-GUESS THEMSELVES.

161
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,306
SHOULD I, CAN I, WHAT I?

162
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:40,240
THEY HAD THE LEGAL CLEARANCE.

163
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,276
THEY DID REALLY TOUGH THINGS.

164
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:44,344
THEY CAUGHT PEOPLE, I DON'T WANT

165
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:50,951
TO CALL THEM TERRORISTS, LIKE

166
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,853
COLLEGIATE MOHAMMED.

167
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:54,888
THERE WERE THREE TERRORISTS WHO

168
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:59,693
WENT THROUGH THE WATERBOARDING.

169
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:01,661
IT'S NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO BE

170
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,196
USED UNLESS THIS PRESIDENT OR

171
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:04,231
THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR

172
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:10,604
CONGRESS DECIDES TO CHANGE IT.

173
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:13,874
THE SENATOR FROM OREGON SAID WHY

174
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:14,140
HER?

175
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,476
SO MANY WOMEN WHO COULD DO THIS

176
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:16,743
JOB.

177
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,513
ACTUALLY, EXACTLY HER.

178
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:20,680
33 YEARS DEDICATED TO PUBLIC

179
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,314
SERVICE.

180
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,717
SHE ASKED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO

181
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:24,251
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE.

182
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,253
SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBER

183
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:26,286
SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE1

184
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:26,319
SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE,

185
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:26,353
SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE2

186
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:26,386
SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE0

187
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:26,620
SHE WAS TRANSFERRED ON SEPTEMBE.

188
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,889
DOUBTS HER FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.

189
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,190
I THINK THEY DESERVE A LOT MORE

190
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,525
OF OUR SUPPORT THAN THIS

191
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,526
CONDEMNATION DECADES LATER.

192
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:34,895
I DO THINK SHE WILL BE

193
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:35,495
CONFIRMED.

194
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:36,196
THE DEMOCRATS ARE CHOOSING A

195
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,198
REALLY UNFORTUNATE REASON TO TRY

196
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:40,066
TO PUT HER THROUGH THE RINGER.

197
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,835
LET HER GET THROUGH.

198
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,270
SHE IS GOING TO BE CONFIRMED.

199
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,604
STEVE THAT IT'S A GOOD POINT YOU

200
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:44,905
MAKE.

201
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:49,643
SHE SHOULD BE RESPECTED, CHOSEN,

202
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:52,479
BASED ON THE MAJORITY OF HER

203
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,048
BODY MORE, PROTECTING THE

204
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:55,649
COUNTRY, WORKING AT AND

205
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,718
UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS.

206
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:00,554
>> Dana: I HOPE I CAN ADD ONE

207
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:01,054
MORE THING.

208
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:03,890
I DON'T USUALLY LIKE TO SAY THIS

209
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,393
BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR WOMEN

210
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,861
WORKING IN GOVERNMENT FOR HER TO

211
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,663
STICK TO IT, TAKE THE SUPPORT OF

212
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,698
THE PRESIDENT, GO FORWARD AND BE

213
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:13,300
CONFIRMED IS SO IMPORTANT.

214
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,334
SHE SPENT 33 YEARS THERE.

215
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,769
IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR WOMEN

216
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:18,138
IN GOVERNMENT TO GET TO THESE

217
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,272
POSITIONS BUT GOVERNMENT IS

218
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,707
WHERE WOMEN CAN REALLY MAKE A

219
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,075
DIFFERENCE IN LEADERSHIP.

220
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:23,610
HER GOING FORWARD, STANDING

221
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:23,910
TALL.

222
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,845
SHE HAS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED

223
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:26,112
OF.

224
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,781
SHE HAS EVERYTHING TO BE PROUD

225
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:28,114
OF.

226
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,616
IT MEANS A LOT FOR WOMEN BEHIND

227
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,217
YOU COMING UP THROUGH THE RANKS

228
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:35,522
IF YOU GO THROUGH THIS

229
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:37,190
CONFIRMATION.

230
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,462
>> Kimberly: I DEDICATED -- I

231
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:43,496
DEDICATED CAREER.

232
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:44,898
THEY DON'T GET PAID MUCH.

233
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:47,200
THEY WORK VERY HARD, MAKE

234
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,901
SACRIFICES.

235
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,436
SHE SHOULD BE CHOSEN NOT BECAUSE

236
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,737
SHE IS A WOMAN BUT BECAUSE SHE

237
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:54,674
IS THE BEST CHOICE IN CANDIDATE.

238
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,276
>> Brian: PRESIDENT OBAMA

239
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:56,643
COMES IN.

240
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:58,912
ERIC HOLDER SAYS WE'RE GOING TO

241
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,080
GO AFTER THE ENHANCED

242
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,680
INTERROGATION.

243
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,215
LEON PANETTA SAYS BACK OFF.

244
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:05,485
THEN PEOPLE SAY WAIT A SECOND.

245
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:06,286
DOING SOMETHING THE JUSTICE

246
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,088
DEPARTMENT ALLOWED ME TO DO TO

247
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,489
STOP THE NEXT ATTACK.

248
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:11,491
IF YOU READ JOSE RODRIGUEZ'S

249
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:13,093
BOOK, YOU READ WHAT THE CIA MEN

250
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:13,927
AND WOMEN DID.

251
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:15,395
NO DOUBT THEY STOPPED THE NEXT

252
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:15,729
ATTACK.

253
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,064
NOT ONLY DO I HOPE SHE EMBRACES

254
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,233
HER ROLE IN THE BLACK SITES AND

255
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,267
ENHANCED INTERROGATION.

256
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,769
I THINK SHE SHOULD DO IT WITH

257
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:23,269
PRIDE.

258
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,471
I THINK SHE SHOULD INVITE PEOPLE

259
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,406
TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE.

260
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:27,774
I DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

261
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:29,242
I AM PROUD OF WHAT I DID AS AN

262
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:29,609
AMERICAN.

263
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:32,078
I FOLLOW THE LAW.

264
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,313
I AM VERY PROUD OF IT.

265
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:34,848
FOR 32 YEARS, TO GET TO THE

266
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,282
POINT WHERE I AM DEPUTY, NOW

267
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:36,683
ACTING.

268
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,385
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE ME THE JOB,

269
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,519
DO IT.

270
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,888
IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT I DID, HE

271
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:42,689
SHOULD'VE STOPPED, YOU SHOULDN'T

272
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:43,723
HAVE ALLOWED US TO DO THE

273
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:45,325
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT WAS SIGNED

274
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:46,292
OFF BY EVERYONE.

275
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,528
IT COMES DOWN TO VOTES.

276
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,198
RAND PAUL, HE WAS AN EYE DOCTOR

277
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:52,866
AT THE TIME.

278
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,401
PERFECTLY QUALIFIED TO COMMENT

279
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:54,734
ON THIS.

280
00:07:54,734 --> 00:08:00,507
HE DOESN'T WANT TO VOTE FOR HER.

281
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:01,708
IF THE OTHERS HAVE ANY HOPE OF

282
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,509
HOLDING ONTO THEIR SEATS IN RED

283
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,078
STATES, THEY BETTER VOTE FOR

284
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:05,512
HER.

285
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:08,114
FOR HER TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO

286
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,115
BE RONNY JACKSON ON WEDNESDAY

287
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,083
AND THEN HAVE TO RUN TO THE CIA

288
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,785
TO SAY COME ON BACK, WE ARE

289
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,687
GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU.

290
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:14,554
IT SHOWS ME THE WHITE HOUSE WAS

291
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:15,121
SLOW TO BACK HER.

292
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,791
THEY DID NOT GET THE CAMPAIGN

293
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:18,491
GOING.

294
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,126
IF POMPEO COULDN'T GET 60 VOTES,

295
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,661
SHE IS SAYING WHY DO I WANT TO

296
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,396
NOT ONLY NOT GET THE JOB AT ROOM

297
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,899
AND MY REPUTATION AT THE SAME

298
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:26,199
TIME.

299
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,168
I AM HORRIFIED AND EMBARRASSED

300
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:29,135
FOR LAWMAKERS WHO WILL NOT RUN

301
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,336
TO HER DEFENSE RIGHT NOW.

302
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:31,938
>> Kimberly: YOU ARE RIGHT.

303
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,606
SHE SHOULD BE CELEBRATED, SAY

304
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:35,140
WHAT A STRONG, OUTSTANDING

305
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,376
CHOICE THE PRESIDENT MADE, AND

306
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,344
SHE IS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO

307
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,212
SERVE THE COUNTRY FAITHFULLY

308
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,082
DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THOSE

309
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:43,982
TRYING TO BESMIRCH HER

310
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,286
REPUTATION.

311
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:47,754
>> Brian: SHE STOPPED THE NEXT

312
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:48,088
ATTACK.

313
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,690
SHE WAS PART OF BLACK SITES.

314
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,025
>> Kimberly: WOMEN AND YOUNG

315
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:52,892
GIRLS GROWING UP SHOULD LOOK UP

316
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:55,161
TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS TO SAY I

317
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,896
CAN BE ANYTHING I WANT IN LIFE.

318
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,698
LOOK AT THE STRENGTH WHO HAVE

319
00:08:58,698 --> 00:08:59,165
COME BEFORE ME.

320
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:01,501
>> Brian: IF I COULD ADD ONE

321
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,969
MORE THING, OF ALL THE ACTING

322
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:08,308
DIRECTOR'S BACTERIA.

323
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:09,242
BRENNAN, CLAPPER.

324
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:11,244
LEON PANETTA, HAYDEN,

325
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:16,649
McGLOCKLIN.

326
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,651
>> Kimberly: LET'S SEE IF

327
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:19,886
SENATOR RAND PAUL AND

328
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,621
McCASKILL WILL COME FORWARD.

329
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:22,989
>> Juan: I THINK YOU SHOULD

330
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,290
GET POM-POM'S.

331
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,695
YOU COULD BE THE CHEERING SQUAD.

332
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,764
LACKS COHERENCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE

333
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,233
MILITARY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID WE

334
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,501
OPPOSE GINA HASPEL.

335
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,505
WHY WOULD 100 OF OUR AMERICAN

336
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:39,239
MILITARY PERSONNEL OPPOSE GINA

337
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,907
HASPEL WHEN ALL THE INSIDERS,

338
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:43,309
PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE

339
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,278
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, PEOPLE

340
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,412
WHO HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY

341
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,248
DEMONIZED BY THE TRUMP

342
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:51,785
ADMINISTRATION, NOW EVERYBODY IS

343
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:53,520
PRO-CIA.

344
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,921
THE INSIDERS LOVE GINA HASPEL,

345
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:55,889
TRUST OR COME THINK SHE'S

346
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,057
COMPETENT, DENSER DRYWALL.

347
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:59,459
BUT WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THIS

348
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,896
ISSUE, IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING

349
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:03,863
EVERYBODY ON THE INSIDE SAY

350
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:05,799
YEAH, WE LIKE OUR FELLOW

351
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,499
INSIDER.

352
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:07,500
IT'S ABOUT AMERICAN VALUES.

353
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,502
IN TERMS OF AMERICAN VALUES,

354
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:11,371
SOMEONE LIKE JOHN McCAIN, WHO

355
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,972
WAS TORTURED, SAYS I CAN'T DO

356
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,774
THAT.

357
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:16,276
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO IS

358
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,076
DEFINITELY A WOMAN INDEFINITELY

359
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,512
OPEN TO HAVING A WOMAN, FIRST

360
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:20,847
WOMAN RUN CIA SAYS THE MORE I

361
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:23,683
READ, THE MORE DISTURBED I AM.

362
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,585
>> Brian: WHERE WAS SHE WHEN

363
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:26,386
THIS WAS HAPPENING?

364
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:27,821
>> Juan: LET ME JUST FINISH

365
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:28,087
UP.

366
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,657
WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SITUATION

367
00:10:30,657 --> 00:00:00,000
WHERE MARC SHORT AND SARAH
