Hello friends and welcome to another video.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,280
Today, we're going to be testing out questionable fashion hacks from Instagram videos.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,020
Now, we've previously tested strange hacks from Facebook videos with mediocre success,

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,060
and then we also tested out some beauty hacks from Instagram videos

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,380
with just as middling results.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,580
And since then, not only has the Instagram algorithm continued to place these short, strange,

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,000
minimally instructive "life hack" DIY videos on my explore page,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,480
but I've also become more and more intrigued by them.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,900
Specifically these clothing and fashion related hacks,

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,360
which seem uniquely peculiar, both in their scenarios

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,880
and also in the time and equipment you would need to do them.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,340
They seem kind of hard.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,020
As I mentioned in my last "hack" video, my biggest complaint with Instagram videos overall

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,860
is that there's no progress bar.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,580
So there's no ability to scrub, or partially rewind,

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,280
besides replaying the entire video every time.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,280
There's also a culture of "freebooting", aka taking other people's videos and reposting them

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,440
to grow your own Instagram page.

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,660
Now I don't think that these fashion hacks are quite as traditionally "clickbaity" as the beauty videos were,

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,400
but as a sub-genre, they definitely prioritize shock value and animated emojis over helpfulness

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,260
I would say they all fall into a few different hack "families",

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,620
all of which have their own particular tropes.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
First off: solving a common or uncommon clothing problem.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,060
These are kind of like old school infomercial style,

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,640
like what you should do when your fly won't close,

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,240
or your skirt keeps riding up.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,140
Secondly: temporary transformation hacks,

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,300
where you quickly pull, tie or fold an item of clothing to use as another item of clothing.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,840
This category kind of makes the most sense to me,

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,120
because they seem the most time efficient,

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,260
but I doubt they actually turn out looking THIS good.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,640
And finally, destructive or permanent transformation hacks,

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,740
where in you cut up, sew, glue or otherwise permanently modify an item of clothing

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,700
to decorate it or turn it into something else.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,420
In particular, they like destroying bras and yoga pants,

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,060
which are on the whole, not cheap,

38
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,720
which always makes me wonder...

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,580
If you have the time and energy to cut up a pair of yoga pants,

40
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,560
and sew them into a halter top,

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,540
would it not be more cost efficient to just to buy a halter top?

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,680
I guess we'll find out.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,780
Let's start hacking.

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,720
Alright.

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
So I think I'm gonna try and build an outfit with these hacks,

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,360
so first up we're gonna start off with the undergarments.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,520
Alright. So this video was posted by this page called diy_hub_.

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,360
But from the looks of the page I would guess that this is a compilation account.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,120
That's trying to get followers by reposting free-booted videos.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,640
So, this video was probably posted from a bigger page, but we don't know which one,

51
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,820
because there's no credit.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,300
So, the general premise of this hack is that you take some underwear or like boxer brief type things.

53
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,920
You cut them up and then it turns into a bralette, somehow.

54
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,720
This hack is like sandwiched amongst a bunch of other clothing hacks.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
All of which are in the general destroying family.

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,620
In fact actually the first hack in the video is them destroying a bra and then later they create a much worse bra.

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,980
Or I guess we don't know that yet, but

58
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,380
T: How dare you question the hacker

59
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,680
S: But that one seemed like a legitimate underwire situation and this one is underwear.

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
Alright, so I got two pairs of underwear.

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:42,080
Because it wasn't super clear to me from the looks of the underwear that she uses if it's like men's boxer briefs or women's boxer briefs.

62
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,480
I'm gonna start off with the women's pair of underwear.

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,180
Just because maybe thinking about it this like extra hole is not ideal.

64
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,980
Even though I feel like these look more like the pair of boxers she was using.

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,500
Alright, so basically what she does is she folds the underwear in half and then she pins the fabric along this line.

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,620
And then she cuts from the crotch to like sort of halfway through the underwear and then she does la sharp turn like an L.

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
Tadaaa!

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,620
This doesn't look right.

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,700
T: Are we sure these aren't crotchless panties?

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:19,180
S: I think that to be honest the thing that's not gonna work is that I think that the legs of these boxer briefs are just to long.

71
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,840
So, it's gonna be more of like a capped sleeve bralette.

72
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,120
So, this is the bralette on. It actually doesn't look that bad.

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,900
T: I like it

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,400
S: It's a little bit like weirdly fitting around the arms, because the sleeves are like longer in the armpit than they should be.

75
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,320
If you can see this.

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:41,960
I think that you just need like the perfect pair of like boxer briefs that have like very little leg to give you that good bra strap.

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:50,320
So, I'm gonna have to try and either cut the legs off of this or/and try to do these fruit of the loom ones as well.

78
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,940
Alright, so this is the de-legged hanes bralette and here is this one.

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,380
With a bonus frontal pee-hole.

80
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,300
I'm gonna try both of these on, then we'll see which ones better and wear that one.

81
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,240
Alright, so these are the men's fruit of the loom boxers and I think that the strap is like much improved,

82
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,200
but the armpit flaccid fabric is still very present it's like if a bra had turkey neck.

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,540
And then this is our modified hanes bra.

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,320
Which definitely has less of a capped sleeve now, but unfortunately like there is gonna be just like some extra fabric around here.

85
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,860
but it's better than the fruit of the loom pair, so were gonna go with this one.

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,580
I think in general this hack does result in like something resembling a bralette

87
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,480
but I'm not sure that the bralettes that result in the end is good enough that you will actually really want to wear it

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,980
I can only forsee that this hack being used at a pinch

89
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,860
at a time and place that where it's wildly inappropiate to not wear a bra but totally okay to not wear underwear

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,100
like right now

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:00:00,000
you can't see my bottom half but you can see my top half
