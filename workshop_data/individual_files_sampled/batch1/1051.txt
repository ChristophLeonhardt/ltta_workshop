hi i'm malik abhi lad and you're in the stream now live on YouTube the United Nations estimates that by 2025 two thirds of the world's population will face water stress conditions but for some people living in Cape Town South Africa the struggle for water is all they've ever known I am Jake I am the political and social activist and a former cabinet minister in Nelson Mandela's cabinet I killed the AJ stream it's estimated that water scarcity impacts more than 40% of the world's population you don't have to tell that to the people living in Cape Town they know what the struggle for water is like in fact an extreme drought could force the city to run out of water completely the crisis has already taken a toll on Cape Town tourism and agricultural industries it's also highlighting the gap between rich and poor joining us to discuss this in Cape Town's Anthea Limburg a city councillor and chairperson of the water resilience Advisory Committee shanell yo.hannes an activist with the water crisis coalition Michael hello another member of the water crisis coalition and an organizer with the general industries Workers Union of South Africa and Kevin winter lead researcher with the urban water management research group welcome everyone to the stream Xanthia when we last visited this issue on the stream it was in December it looked like this as Cape Town facing a future without water the local government was warning of an impending Daisy row May 18th but when the city was projected to be without water since then that campaign seems to have been scrapped is de0 still a reality well there are many factors that influence day zero and we have been able to achieve quite a significant amount of things that have influenced day zero moving out quite substantially firstly our consumption has dramatically reduced over the last six weeks in itself we've reduced our consumption by close to a hundred million litres of water and this is massively altered the day zero modelling which estimated in desert to initially be in early April one of the other factors that have dramatically shifted to zero out is the fact that the agriculture sector has now fully utilized their allocation for the hydrological season and they are no longer drawing from the dams which is declined the rate at which dam levels are dropping and in addition to that we received water from the Hunan Farmers Association and that water supply has now reached dams within the city's municipal boundaries and have provided additional supply for about a four month period all of these factors including evaporation nipples declining have shifted a zero out to the point where we don't you see that there'll be a day zero scenario in this particular year well Michael you've heard what it sounds like has gone right and we don't see a day zero day zero scenario this year what do you make about what the official from the City of Canton impacted by the whole mantra from solution it has not failed to be the job of the worker and that has actually been changed in the ranging from you know set or advertiser onset in especially in the winery and we shall after the celebrated to nonprofit and that they have not made a lot in the period of the top but the workers actually lost their jobs and they are unemployed and there are two possibly contribution and I mean good luck right so Kevin taking that in mind take a look here this is what the government is is putting out a guide to 50 liters or less per day this is what that looks like 10 liters for laundry for shower nine four flushes five for housecleaning you see cooking you see drinking it's all laid out there we can see what the guidelines are looking like but not too long ago the government was asking people to cut down their usage to 87 liters per person what's next and is 50 liters enough is this going to get the job done so that we don't hit that day zero well 50 inches is really tough indeed it's not easy residents to operate at that level and of course the 50 liters is aimed at residents and it doesn't really touch seriously to other sectors in the economy many of them have tried to make different arrangements to manage their water to bring down the costs of their water but the water demand has been placed almost entirely the burden of the water demand and the answer at the moment that the city is suggesting is all about reducing water demand and autists only around what is demand at the moment reductions I pull up a tweet here from Melissa Melissa says I used to wash my hair three times a week now one time I can't shower every day anymore I wash my laundry even less I cooked differently to use less water I think we need to change the sewer system to use seawater that's just one example that she gave but she's describing her everyday life Chanel you're joining us on the phone what does your everyday life look like oh well firstly I am from the kickflip and do you know what happened to me recently about a week ago actually started a shoe last year with my and my late grandfather passed away my granny received a massive dose so of 18,000 then for pensioner to pray and what happened was that girl who was school because of an underwater leak so in the case less expensively additionally many displaced peoples are from colonial times a faster time person shifted so so like everyone knows that Africa has a big gap between the rich and the poor right so the Oscars being paid less in townships you find many socio-economic issues and one of the issues are you know the massive pipe leaks and and what happened was my mother and mother deceases insensible you know on the back you know so being being how can I say going through the tomb of loss of a husband and was expected to play this ball if not if she fine so so what did we find also is this increase of carriers would indicate that we also find situation in which this pipe system is still not working so for example last week we had we had the same issue with the fact system and we are to switch off our water supply so zanthia what chanel seems to be describing there might be summed up in this comment we just got live via YouTube Jack Arco says is this a natural phenomenon or a result of mismanagement is it true that scarce water has been directed to farming so she's talking about you heard Chanelle earlier talking about leaks massive water bills when the water wasn't actually being used Cynthia what do you make of criticisms like that well this drought is as a result of climate change we've received three years of below average niggles of rainfall 2017 was the worst level of rainfall in recorded history and this is obviously placed great amount of strain on dam capacity but in respect to Shannon's point the city of Cape Town actually has the lowest water loss rate in South Africa at 14 percent which is on par with international standards the average water loss rate in South Africa amongst other municipalities is around 36% and the city has been able to reduce its water loss rate to this extent because of investment in infrastructure through maintenance and upgrading programs and this is a program that we are committed to ensuring we roll out to further minimize water losses within our system because of our water demand management and water conservation C programs over the last year decade and a half we've been able to become the the more efficient in our operations with the lowest water use per capita in Cape Town and this is a record for South Africa as well and this is what we aim to build on but in respect to things such as leaks on private properties if there's an underground leak when your property and you require assistance for paying the martyr water that's been lost the city does have a rebate program where you can make application particularly for more vulnerable groups and pensioners this assistance is provided we are also cognizant of how water tariffs are custard and charged particularly for poorer households so for Perot or indigent households water is free of charge from the first 6,000 liters per month and in this way we ensure that we are proper in how we cost or charge for this basic service then pay you are not repor please Lea does not like to international community you are not proper this state zero has been designed and created for the privatization of water that this has been very healthy of the the Cape Flats and the townships for many years you know we have socio-economic inequalities that is not being eradicated by a government who does not care about our constitutional rights you know we have the leaks in our water in our pipes we have water management devices that you know about that being illegally installed and forced upon the poor these water management devices I hope you can speak to that now and let everyone hear about what what the plans are was this water management devices they are only allowing 315 liters of water to our household according to government which has three people in it however the hassles had in the Cape Flats and the townships have but 10 plus individuals these water management devices do not even have 350 liters because some households only have access to 70 liters of water once the water stops the water is completely Daisy doe on a daily basis for people these management devices are not even being s abs approved we also have evidence of thousands of these devices are arguing basically Michael Chanel Chanel finish finish finish up your sinasohn let's bring Michael and go ahead Chanel thank you so much so basically what's happening to the ways of the millions of plants been put out with water management devices that's been installed and forced upon the POIs you know once the water stops completely it's basically making people prone to die from curable diseases people are dying from disease go ahead with it correct and what the the workers actually get affected in in the community but what is important also to note here that this water restriction affect workers now in the community but also affect them in their workplace where actually occurs actually demanding that these workers must bring their own water actually where would they get their own water out of the 50 beetles that are being provided to charity that they actually actually not even allowed to utilize toilet often when it's when they necessary for them to do so and so when I'm actually being extracted and by this what you call what Crichton or water management crisis that has been created by the city while actually having like wicked that they are actually knowing but they have not actually put up systems in place that will ensure that so yes you can but I want to share with our audience what it is that we're talking about because we're talking about these water management devices people may have no idea what we're talking about take a look at this tweet first from Melissa she says poor people are more likely to have water management devices that restrict water supply they're also more likely to have multiple households on one property so you might find 10 people using 350 liters a day and here is a look at what that device looks like this has pulled up from the city of Cape Town's website this device replaces a standard water meter and it's programmed to provide a daily allocation of water for you to use on your own property accepts as some say in the townships and outskirts of Cape Town there may not be running water in people's homes they go to stations outside of their homes to fill up their water Suzanne thing I know you wanted to respond to the criticism go ahead so I think it's incredibly irresponsible to make statements to the effect that the city has created this water crisis and that the water crisis was created to privatize water firstly the responsible for water provision is that of the National Department of Water and Sanitation municipalities such as Cape Town are only responsible for reticulating water and treating them into to drinking standards the answer and then we'll get back to you go ahead folks I would request the same respect so the city of Cape Town has gone above and beyond its constitutional mandate in responding to this dump if this drug was some fabrication of the municipality of Cape Town then we wouldn't have seen the national government declare a national disaster in respect to the drought the National Department a couple of days ago declared a national disaster for the drought because there is a drought both in the Western Cape the eastern cape and Limpopo and the city half of Cape Town has implemented water restrictions in order to manage the existing water far beaches we've been rolling out water to mine management devices for the last decade and a half and we're not the only municipality that has been installing water demand management devices Durban has been doing exactly the same particularly in response to their drought which they encountered just over a year ago and these water demand management devices are sit in line with the current or existing water restriction levels and if there are more occupants on a property we are able to make a mission and is just okay so I hear what you're saying on the I hear shanell disagreeing but I want to bring Kevin back in here with this suite we got this from solar energy for schools he writes water leaks had been a problem ever since I could walk our infrastructure is old and outdated we need to hold our municipalities and leaders to high standards that standard being that we deserve better what take on mismanagement versus the drought versus how this water management device system is working yeah well I'm a scientist and so I look at numbers and I'm looking for their evidence and so when I hear the stories and and these are not the first time that I've heard stories about complaints of the water demand management devices these restrictive device devices and also very importantly the stories of what I think is a national tragedy in what is happening to workers in the surrounding farmland areas where there is put a production going on there but let's come back the real factors here and what I've been writing down as the conversation has been doing is is that the questions that I need to be asking here around so why are these war demand management systems failing they are all of them from what I'm told are approved by a South African Bureau of Standards so they're not just any devices that get put in place there and if there is failure what level of failure are we talking about and what kind of failure are they responsible for for its resulting in the in the malfunction of them and and so those are the first questions I would ask I think everyone has to start recognizing that we do have to meter the water and the slogan that I use often is if you don't measure something you can't measure it and so for the city to be able to have no meters and nobility to measure the water is extremely serious but I think when we come to what's fair and what becomes extremely difficult for these meters to operate in homes where there are more than four people then there has to be a means by which there can be addressed and so I think there's a lot of work around the fairness and revocation of the instrument itself in responding to people going into poverty and inequality that they actually created a a simple water management you know system even sharing that well yes they is right and but in this drought that workers are not going to lose their job because there are other water shuttle a well water could be actually and received from and when we tried that welcome to not lose their jobs and workers actually not play in the tea province because what we see now and witness here is that the problem that isn't created by government I feel from the city of Cape Town and I want to share with our audience look at what you're talking about just to give this a little bit more context I've pulled up this headline on my screen here Cape Town farmer's laid off a mid water crisis and and that's we're looking at some 30,000 seasonal farm workers who now have no jobs because of this crisis I hear your criticisms there and Dan thing I want to give you a chance to respond but first I want you to have a listen to this video comment we got and someone from Johannesburg this is vishwas they are three times injustice is registering in these communities the first based on inherited inequality in apartheid geographies the day 0 campaign of the DA government has essentially squeezed these poorer communities they carry the cost of this crisis the second injustice is the failure of the state at all three levels this is a climate crisis failed state and these communities are bearing the brunt of it and finally the decisions made by Trump and other petrol he leads to continue extraction and use of fossil fuels has contribute to this crisis as well as ampere so the particular drought has been incredibly severe for all of the users within the Western Cape supply system the city of Cape Town is one of many users that draw from a connect of dams within the western cape supply system at the beginning of the hydrological year the National Department of Water and Sanitation imposed further restrictions targets on all uses that draw from the Western Cape supply system and so the city was given a 45 percent restrictions target by the National Department of water and sanitation and agriculture I received a 60% restrictions target which meant that they needed to operate with sixty percent less water than the previous year and this has had massive economic impacts for those farmers many of the farmers operate outside of the city of Cape Town's municipal boundaries but the department the provincial government of the Western Cape have put in place support programs to assist these farmers during these difficult times it has benefited everybody out there is a prediction for what a cultural area is a protection you're speaking about agriculture so let us speak about the aquifers let us speak about the Philippine horticultural area that the city and the provincial government is giving going it's always not even wanting to protect the philippi horticultural area which is the recharge zone that has so much supplies of vegetables that's being sold and distributed it is basically threatening this piece of land which is thousands of hectares of land with mining on it it is also threatening with the building of these potential areas so why is the government not to attacking agriculture if they wanting to go ahead was mining forces on the land with residential disowning on the aquifer why is the aquifer nothing being protected if even if the city is saying they are protecting agriculture why are you not taking the filipino cultural area so I hear you talking about aquifers I want to bring up this suite we just got from Portus mind who says how does one manage a crowd of 20,000 thirsty people lining up at a collection point for water how will the authorities police the collection of water from natural springs and what happens when sanitation fails or diseases break out so Kevin he's raising all kinds of questions there but the point about the natural springs the aquifers others have raised the point of desalination are any of these potential solutions that you find enticing I think there is a program which is I'm afraid any starting to really get going within the city of Cape Town with supports on their national government to some extent and and this is where moment when cities actually take the lead and to expect you know national government follows it doesn't really take the lead in circumstances like this because national government doesn't operate fast enough and doesn't do things at the appropriate scale this is the moment when we started to look to new governance systems and the cities got to step up to the plate to actually take much more stronger lead here and and to withdraw itself from the idea that national government is the only one that supplies water and what it does come from a variety of sources and ultimately if we are in to a city which becomes long-term more drought prone then desalination is the only way we're going to be able to survive in this with the size of our city under two as the water crisis coalition we completely reject desalination desalination is extremely expensive it has the mental impacts on both social and climate and the ecosystem so for example if you're looking at desalination you are expecting the salt out of the ocean what about the toxins what about the toxins desalination is extremely intensive shanell johannes i have to pause you there I know that desalination is a whole other topic that we can go into unfortunately we are out of time our thanks to zanthia so now Michael and Kevin for joining us with this conversation and of course it will continue online on Twitter hashtag Ajay stream until next time take care
