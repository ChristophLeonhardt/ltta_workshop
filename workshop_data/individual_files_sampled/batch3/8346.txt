I'M ANITA VOGEL. JESSE: WE HAVE SEEN THEM ATTACK CONSERVATIVES AND DESTROY COLLEGE CAMPUSES. NOW ANTIFA IS SINKING TO A NEW LOW. ONE PROTESTER IS TARGETING A WOMAN WHO LOST HER HUSBAND ON 9/11. YOU ARE I'M NOT LIKE YOUR HUSBAND, I AM NOT GOING TO PUNCH YOU. I'M NOT LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND WHO IS GOING TO PUNCH YOU. MY HUSBAND DIED. GOOD FOR HIM. NCPD ARE A BUNCH OF SODOMIZING I AM GRANTS WITH THEIR BULLY STICKS. YOUR HUSBAND CAN ROT IN THE GRAVE. JESSE: I DON'T CONDONE VIOLENCE, BUT THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT FOR WHAT HE SAID. HE'S UGLY. THIS IS THE FACE OF EVIL. HOW DO YOU EVEN HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT ON THE STREET. SOMEONE DECIDED TO HANDLE THAT LATER AND WALKED ACROSS THE STREET LATER AND SAID YOU TALKING ABOUT MY MOM? AND THAT GUY TURNED TAIL AND RAN. PICKING ON 9/11 VICTIM, THE FIREFIGHTERS AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND POLICE OFFICERS. IT'S INSANE. IT GOES TO SHOW YOU ALL HE WAS TRYING TO DO WAS BULLY, HARASS, REVOKE AND PUSH THIS WOMAN INTO RESPONDING. SHE SEEMED PRETTY CALM. JESSE: HE WENT AFTER PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY, POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS, WOMEN, DEAD HUSBANDS. IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THAT. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR COMING FROM THE RADICAL LEFT. BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE UP AGAINST. ON THE STREETS, YOU ARE UP AGAINST THIS TYPE OF PERSON AND IT'S SCARY. IT'S NOT JUST THE STREETS IT'S HAPPENING ON TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA. PEOPLE ARE SAYING STUFF LIKE THIS. IT REMINDS ME OF MY TOM ARNOLD DUST-UP WHERE HE WAS CALLING ME A RACIST AND I RAN INTO HIM. I SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I SAID I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT. HE SAID I DIDN'T MEAN YOU, I MEAN THEY ARE USING YOU. THEN AFTER THE DUST-UP HE GOES ON TWITTER AND YELLING ABOUT HOW HE SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED ME OUT. JESSE: HE WAS ON TWITTER TAKING SHOTS, AND YOU GOT IN HIS FACE AND SAID HEY, BRO, AND AFTER YOU TALKED TO HIM HE'S BACK ON TWITTER? I CALLED HIM A COWARDLY, SLANDEROUS WEASEL. PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS BECAUSE MAXINE WATERS IS SAYING CONFRONT PEOPLE, CHASE YOUR SENATORS DOWN THE MALLWAYS IN THE ELEVATORS. IT'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE AND IT, DANGEROUS STUFF. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO END WELL. JESSE: THEY DON'T LIKE CYBERBULLYING. THEY ARE BIG AGAINST CYBERBULLYING, BUT I GUESS THEY ARE OKAY WITH BULLYING IN THE STREETS. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT RUSH LIMBAUGH. HE HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HILLARY BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. IT'S FRIGHTENING. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT. THEY RESENT THE WHOLE IDEA OF AMERICA BECOMING GREAT. THEY RESENT THE IDEA OF AMERICA AS A SUPER FOURTH FOR GOOD. THE VALIDATION OF ALL OF THESE ODDBALL WEIRD PERVERTED LEFT-WING BEHAVIORS BECOME MORE AND MORE NORMAL AND THE POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT'S ROLE GOING TO ADDRESS THEIR GRIEVE YANTSS? HAVE WE BECOME A COUNTRY OF A BUNCH OF VICTIMS, CONSTANT LIANG ARE YOU DEMANDING SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. JESSE: CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAD PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOW ABOUT SPY GATE. WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THIS GDP GROWTH. WE WOULDN'T KNOW ELIZABETH WARREN WASN'T NATIVE AMERICAN. 1/1024th. I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH RUSH. BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THERE I DISAGREE WITH. JESSE: HE'S RIGHT 99.9% OF THE TIME. YOU MUST DISAGREE WITH HIM ABOUT THAT .01%. HE SAYS SOME THINGS I THINK MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. BUT THAT I THINK IS SPOT ON. I AM HAPPY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT. I SHUTTER TO THINK OF THE IDEA OF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD HILLARY BECOME PRESIDENT. ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN EARTHED. BUSINESS AS USUAL. I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THINGS MOVING FORWARD. I SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT. JESSE: YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE HAD YOUR BEAUTY REST. LIMBAUGH ALSO PREDICTED THIS FOR THE MID TERMS. WE HOLD THE HOUSE AND INCREASE THE SENATE. I THINK THAT'S JUST. I THINK THE DEMOCRAT PARTY DESERVES TO LOSE IN THE SINGLE BIGGEST ELECTORAL LANDSLIDE DENEAT MY LIFETIME. THE ACTIONS THEY HAVE TAKEN JUST IN THE LAST MONTH. JESSE: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THEORY THEY DESERVE TO LOSE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY BEHAVED. I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY AND MAY HOLD TO WATER. I THINK SO. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT ON THE LIMB AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A RED WAVE. BUT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE KAVANAUGH HEARING AND THE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING IS NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR. I KNOW WHERE MY VOTES ARE GOING. I'M AN INDEPENDENT. I KNOW WHERE MY VOTES ARE GOING. THEY ARE GOING RED THIS NOVEMBER 6. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, IT WILL BE
