this poster is creating the illusion that Islam is an inherently violent religion this is of course not true more than 99% of Muslims ignored the call to Islamic extremism by al-qaeda yes true nothing going by the sheer numbers the majority of Muslims have not carried out an act of terrorism oh and by the way even if only about 1% of the Muslim population committed or supported acts of terror that would still translate into 15 million people but there are other numbers that apologists like miss boy GaN tend to steer clear of let's take let's take a look at a UK study conducted by ICM and published on channel 4 a very mainstream source in the UK the study shows 18 percent of British Muslims say that violence is acceptable against people who quote mock the Prophet and 4 percent of British Muslims from the study think suicide bombing is justified to fight injustice that's disturbing well boy gone then goes on to actually champion Sharia law and even the Ground Zero mosque while criticizing the TV series homeland for its depiction of Islam and she wraps the whole spiel up with that do-rag or reminder that islam is the religion of peace all the while ignoring that at time of writing at least the number of deadly attacks carried out in the name of Allah since 9/11 alone according to the religion of peace calm currently stands at thirty two thousand six hundred and fifty-one G if Islam is a religion of peace I'd hate to come face-to-face with the religion of terror in any event the Simmons library also goes on to warn us all not to commit microaggressions that might be deemed as Islamophobic what's an Islamophobic microaggression you might ask well how about this assumption of one's own religious a religious identity as the norm translation comments or behaviors that convey people's presumption that their religion is the standard and behaves accordingly eg greeting someone Merry Christmas or saying god bless you after someone sneezes conveys ones perception that everyone is Christian or believes in God well I'll be merry Christmas's offense of the Muslims but isn't Jesus considered to be a prophet and a messenger of God in Islam it's also complicated isn't it but if that salutation can be construed as Anna Islamophobic microaggression I suppose anything can that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
