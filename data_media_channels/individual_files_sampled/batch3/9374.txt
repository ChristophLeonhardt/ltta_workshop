ASIAN COMMUNITIES THINK THIS IS DISCRIMINATION. JUDGE, WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS CASE? A CASE THAT SUPREME QUARTZ DOES NOT WANT. THE GUIDELINES THAT WERE SENT DOWN WERE A LITTLE AMBIGUOUS. MAYBE THE UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY DO NEED SOME FIRM GUIDELINES. IT'LL BE A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE IT GETS TO THAT. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS SUPPOSED TO CREATE SOME MORE DIVERSITY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. SO NOW IT'S LIKE, WELL, ALL THESE ASIAN STUDENTS ARE DOING SO WELL THAT THEY ARE TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE? BACK OFF WHILE WE MAKE ROOM THE MATH DEMONSTRATES THAT IF YOU TAKE A SEAT AWAY FROM A QUALIFIED PERSON BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE IN ORDER TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, THERE IS A WINNER AND THERE IS A LOSER. IF THE LOSER IS ACTUALLY MORE ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED THAN THE WINTER, HOW ARE THEY GOING TO TESTIFY THAT? THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT RACE MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS LONG AS IT IS ONE OF MANY FACTORS. IT CANNOT BE THE POSITIVE FACTOR AND IT CANNOT BE THE FACTOR THEY WEIGHED THE HEAVIEST, BUT THEY MAY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT. THE ONE WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION OF IT BEING A PRIVATE INSTITUTION AND WHY DO THEY HAVE TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN AND TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANW TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANO TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANT TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANO TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN AN' TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANT TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANB TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANC TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANU TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANE TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANW TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANE TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANK TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANO TO ANSWER TO WHO THEY LET IN ANW THEY TAKEN A LOT OF LEGACY STUDENTS, THEY TAKE ATHLETES. THE INTERNAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IF YOU ARE A FACULTY MEMBER, THE OFFSPRING OF A FACULTY MEMBER, YOU HAVE 50% Martha: 50%! THE ADMISSION RATE IS, LIKE, NINE? AND IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN A ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENT CLOSE TO 25% ACCEPTANCE. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THE SUPREME COURT CASES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS WHICH IS OWNED BY THE STATE IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT CANNOT APPLY THIS IS DIFFERENT. IN 2017 ALONE, RECEIVED OVER 600 MILLION IN FEDERAL DOLLARS. THEY DON'T NEED ANY MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT! THEY GOT 600 MILLION FROM THE FEDS. WHEN THEY ACCEPTED THAT 600 MILLION, THEY AGREED THEY WOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RACE AS ONE OF MANY CONDITIONS. Martha: IF THEY TURNED ON THE MONEY IN THE FUTURE, THEY WOULD HAVE LESS OF AN ARGUMENT. THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT. CORRECT. CAN YOU SEE THEM TURNING DOWN THAT KIND OF MONEY? Martha: THEY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY, JUDGE. DO YOU THINK THAT RACE SHOULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE EQUATION SO THAT NOBODY CHECKS ANY BOXES AND THEY ONLY LOOK AT YOUR NUMBERS AND QUALIFICATIONS? I WOULD AGREE. I THINK FROM THE ASIAN-AMERICAN CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE, IT SHOULD BE A MERITOCRACY. IT SHOULD BE BASED ON YOUR SCORES, YOUR EXTRA CURRICULAR NOTHING LIKE A PERSONALITY. COURAGE, BRAVERY? ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS LIKE THAT? IT'S INSULTING. IT'S INSULTING TO ASCRIBE TO EVERYONE THE ATTRIBUTES OF ONE OR TWO JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE SAME GROUP.
