♪ ♪ Greg: CLAPPING HAS BEEN BANNED IN BRITAIN'S UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER. CLAPPING BECAUSE IT TRIGGERS ANXIETY AND DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM ATTENDING EVENTS. AND IT WILL BE REPLACED WITH A SILENT VERSION OF JAZZ HANDS WHICH IS SAID TO ENCOURAGE AN ENVIRONMENT OF RESPECT. TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY. A MASSACHUSETTS PROFESSOR SAID THE LABEL VETERAN SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PEACE ACTIVISTS. I SAY THE LABEL PROFESSOR SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MESSY DROOLERS. THEY HAVE BOTH BROKEN OUT OF THE ASYLUM GATES OF THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY. NO ONE WANTS TO SAY MAN, THAT'S REALLY DUMB. WE ARE ALL BULLIED INTO SILENCE BY THE TYRANNY OF GRIEVANCE. NOBODY WANTS TO SHARE THE RISK IN CALLING OUT ABSURDITY BECAUSE THAT MAKES YOU A BIG MEANIE. YOU'RE ON A SUBWAY AND A MANIAC IT'S ON. EVERYONE, WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY LOOK AT THEIR PHONES. BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO ASSUME A PIECE OF RISK. THEY HIDE FROM THE MANIAC. THEN HE REALIZED THE MANIAC IS BILL de BLASIO. HE IS SCREAMING. YOUR HEADACHES. NOW THE JOKE IS ON YOU. YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPLAINED THE MOMENT de BLASIO GOT ON YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SHUT UP. WHEN EVERYONE LOOKS THE OTHER WAY, IN CONGRESS, ON-CAMPUS COME IN THE MEDIA MAYBE IT'S ONCE TIME TO SHARE THE RISK. MIGHT BE THE ONLY DEFENSE WE HAVE LEFT. JESSE, THEY SAID CLAPPING MAKES THE UP WITH AUTISM NERVOUS. I THINK THERE WAS A STRATEGY TO USE A REAL ISSUE TO CAMOUFLAGE A SILLY IDEA. IF CLAPPING MAKES ARTISTIC OR ANY ANXIOUS PEOPLE NERVOUS, IT WOULD BE HARMFUL TO KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING ACCUSTOMED TO IT. WHAT IF THEY WANT TO GO TO A SOCCER GAME OR A ROCK CONCERT. THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE USED TOOK CLAPPING. THIS IS ABSURD. Jesse: ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T AN ONION ARTICLE? Greg: I DOUBLE CHECKED. I SHOULD CHECK WITH THE PRODUCERS. Jesse: CLAPPING ISN'T REALLY FOR THE PEOPLE CLAPPING. IT'S THE PERSON PERFORMING. FOR INSTANCE, MYSELF. WHEN I AM ON STAGE, I NEED THE CLAPPING TO KNOW IF MY JOKES ARE LANDING, TO KNOW IF I HAVE THE AUDIENCE ON MY SIDE. I NEED THE AFFIRMATION. THEY ARE MISSING THAT. ALSO Greg: IT IS ALL ABOUT JESSE. Jesse: THE BRITISH ARE OVERLOOKING SOMETHING ELSE. HOME TEAM ADVANTAGE. WHEN YOU HAVE A LOUD CROWD, IT FORCES THE OPPOSING TEAM INTO TAKING TIMEOUTS AND THEY MISS COMMUNICATE. TO YOUR POINT ABOUT AUTISM, THIS DISCRIMINATES AGAINST BLIND PEOPLE. BLIND PEOPLE CAN SEE JAZZ HANDS. GETTING TO THE AUDITORY SITUATION, THERE WERE SOME LOUD NOISES AROUND WORLD WAR II WHEN THE GERMANS WERE DROPPING REALLY LOUD BOMBS ON THE BRITISH AND I THINK THE BRITISH, I THINK THEY SURVIVED. THE ANXIETY IS REAL ANXIETY AND THEY METED OUT. Greg: JUAN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THE IDEA OF PEACE ACTIVISTS BEING CALLED VETERANS? Juan: I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. DIPLOMATS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PEACE ACTIVISTS. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DIPLOMATS, NEGOTIATORS FROM PEOPLE WHO MADE AN EFFORT, EVEN PEOPLE HAVE GONE OVERSEAS LIKE WITH THE PEACE CORPS, THE MORMONS. Greg: THAT IS NOT A MILITARY VETERAN. Juan: THEY DIDN'T SAY MILITARY. THEY SAID VETERANS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN OF THEMSELVES. Greg: SO I AM A TV VETERAN. Judge Jeanine: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THEY GAVE OF THEMSELVES. THEY DID A JOB AND GOT PAID FOR IT. WHEN YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE, CARRY A WEAPON, THAT'S A VETERAN. Juan: OUR SOLDIERS GET PAID FOR IT. Judge Jeanine: THE RISK TO THEM, THE CLASSIC RISK-REWARD. CHANCES ARE SOMEONE IS OUT THERE LOOKING TO KILL YOU. Juan: I THINK Jesse: WHEN YOU PUT A BULLET IN BIN LADEN'S HEAD, YOU ARE A PEACE ACTIVIST BECAUSE BIN LADEN CAN'T GO TO WAR. Greg: I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM THESE DAYS IS NOBODY WANTS TO SHARE THE RISK. WHEN THERE IS A DUMB IDEA, THERE IS A MINORITY OF ACTIVISTS THAT ARE SO LOUD THAT THEY WILL BOYCOTT YOU. THEY WILL COME AFTER YOU AND HOUND YOU. PEOPLE GO, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. Dana: AS YOU WERE SAYING THAT, ALL OF US FOR SO LONG, WHEN WE HEAR THESE KINDS OF THINGS, OH, THAT'S STUPID. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. BUT ALL OF ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE'S AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT YOU CAN'T FUNCTION IN THE REAL WORLD WITHOUT ALL OF THIS CODDLING. Greg: THE SPEECH CODES ON CAMPUS. IN ACADEMIA, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE THE RISK. Dana: REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT OF THAT UNIVERSITY IN OKLAHOMA WHO STOOD UP AND SAID WE ARE NOT YOUR BABYSITTERS. WE ARE NOT YOUR PARENTS. WE ARE HERE TO CHALLENGE YOUR THINKING. HE GOT ALL THE ATTENTION AND MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE LIKE THAT. Greg: MANCHESTER UNITED HAS THE LOUDEST SOCCER FANS. Jesse: THEY ARE NOT DOING JAZZ HANDS. Juan: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO GALLAUDET? THEY ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE PLAYERS.
