118
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,160
what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said well that's their</font>

119
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,690
cultural custom and so they turned a

120
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,270
blind eye to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they had a lower</font>

121
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,730
standard for intervention<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

122
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,290
said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're Muslim is is that an</font>

123
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,440
accurate statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your views that's</font>

124
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,330
exactly what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> judge said to me</font>

125
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,820
so that's precisely what the judge had

126
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,950
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> as he said that this is the way my</font>

127
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,890
family's culture chooses to discipline

128
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,410
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that is within their right and he</font>

129
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,790
has no right<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell them that the way</font>

130
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disciplining their child is</font>

131
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">not right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he felt like that that wasn't</font>

132
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">his place</font>

133
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,570
so yeah essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

134
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,230

315
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">initially I did not leave the house I</font>

322
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,710
I felt confident to leave my house and

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did was apply for</font>

was the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

341
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,110
and of course girls don't live on their

embarrassment to the family and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

349
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">community because my mother was the head</font>

352
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,339
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very embarrassing for her to have</font>

353
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,339
such a daughter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I started going</font>

354
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,490
to university I just happened to<font color="#CCCCCC"> choose</font>

355

<font color="#E5E5E5">change the trajectory of my life I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

358
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,550
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know I know at least a</font>

359
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,529
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his curriculum really well you</font>

360
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice about the three monotheistic</font>

361
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:02,889
Abrahamic religions and I've been

362
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,139
immersed in you know my mother<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

363
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,740

know and like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> head of the Islamic</font>

365
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,680
Studies department and asked her

368
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">education on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one so I took that</font>

369
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:23,620
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the professor that taught the</font>

370
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">course was a Lebanese Christian so he</font>

371
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,170
knew the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arab background and he</font>

372
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,059
understood the Islamic background<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

373
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:36,670
and it was really eye-opening for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it</font>

374
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,019
was the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had ever</font>

of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had always been raised to</font>

Quran the book was so divine and

379
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:52,870
different than anything else in this

387
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,000
started to take this course and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,619
started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of these</font>

393
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,819
started to realize

394
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,350
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been fed a lie and it was</font>

395
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,799
just like this weird simultaneously

396
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,100
feeling really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,929
there were so many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,020
on through but it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

552
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,830
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> sam harris when he was on the bill</font>

554
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,110
harris was speaking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> us them in the</font>

555
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,770
same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would and he was being</font>

556
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know rational and making total sense</font>

557
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,210
of him and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill maher</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were talking about</font>

558
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is done in the same way that they would</font>

559
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,770
both talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> christianity and all of</font>

560
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,600
a sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> ben affleck was calling them</font>

561
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,230
gross and racist<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's when I</font>

562
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,780
decided that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak out and tell</font>

563
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> story because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in my life</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">was congratulating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ben Affleck and</font>

565
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,370
thinking the same Harris was indeed

566
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,890
gross and racist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I realized like</font>

567
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,650
well people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so misinformed people</font>

568
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">really have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no clue what's going on and</font>

569
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,480
so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need my responsibility</font>

570
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,419
they're afraid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being called yeah we</font>

571
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">hasn't mean this is a fascinating</font>
