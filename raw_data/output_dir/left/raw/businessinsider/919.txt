1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
well the question is whether the

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,300
increase is greater than expected and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like an efficient</font>

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,649
market and government but already people

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">are expecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fed to raise interest</font>

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,820
rates and it's already had an impact on

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,700
longer-term interest rates and it

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,890
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an impact on the price of</font>

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,680
the dollar so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is will they</font>

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,109
raise them more or less than expected

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,990
another question is who Janet yellen's

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,810
replacement will be and what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,300
person's stance look like you have a

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,949
thought on who it might be I wasn't

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about hit me I think they should keep</font>

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,820
Janet Yellen on she's great but of

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,480
course Trump won't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an idea who</font>

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,430
you think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be it would be some</font>

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,289
great businessperson probably a man<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

20
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,570
and probably someone who is not really

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,760
focused and impressed by the Fed who

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,340
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shares his values</font>

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,520
about deregulation and keeping out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lit</font>

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,438
the businessmen do their business and

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,150
would that be to work is there what type

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,500
of person<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be the worst person</font>

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting learn effect now you are as a</font>

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">person but what type of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person Ron Paul</font>
