>>> HI, EVERYONE, I'M ADRIANA 
DIAZ, THANKS FOR JOINING US. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS 
CLAIMING A TREMENDOUS VICTORY 
TODAY AFTER SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES RULED TO UPHOLD HIS 
CONTROVERSIAL TRAVEL BAN. 
IN A 5-4 VOTE ALONG PARTISAN 
LINE, THE JUSTICES DECIDED THE 
PRESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT TO 
LIMIT INTRAI OF -- ENTRY OF 
PEOPLE TO THE U.S. FROM SEVEN 
CURRENT, MOST OF THEM 
PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM. 
THEY INCLUDE SYRIA, LIBYA, 
IRAN, YEMEN, SOMALIA, NORTH 
KOREA AND SOME PEOPLE FROM 
VENEZUELA. 
JUSTICES SOTOMAYOR, GINSBURG, 
KAIGON AND BRYER ALL VOTED 
AGAINST THE BAN, WHILE 
JUSTICES, THOMAS, KENNEDY, 
ALITO AND GORSUCH VOTED  TO 
UPHOLD IT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK TO TWITTER 
SHORTLY AFTER THE RULING CAME 
DOWN WITH A SIMPLY WOW! 
THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION 
OVERTURNS A LOWER COURT RULING 
AGAINST THE BAN. 
CBS NEWS CHIEF LEGAL 
CORRESPONDENT JAN CRAWFORD HAS 
THE LATEST. 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, THIS IS THE 
FIRST MAJOR LEGAL TEST OF THE 
TRUMP PRESIDENCY IN THIS 5-4 
DECISION TODAY, WRITTEN BY 
CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS. 
THE SUPREME COURT HAS REALLY 
DELIVERED HIM A MAJOR VICTORY, 
SAYING THAT HIS THIRD ATTEMPT 
TO PASS A TRAVEL BAN FINALLY 
WOULD PASS CONSTITUTIONAL 
SCRUTINY. 
NOW, I DON'T THINK THIS 
DECISION WAS A SURPRISE. 
THE SUPREME COURT BACK IN 
DECEMBER ALLOWED THE TRAVEL BAN 
TO TAKE EFFECT WHILE THE 
APPEALS KIND OF PLAYED OUT 
WHICH WAS A SIGNAL THAT THEY 
WERE PROBABLY GOING TO UPHOLD 
IT TODAY. 
TRUMP PASSED THIS TRAVEL BAN 
BACK IN SEPTEMBER. 
IT WAS HIS -- AS I SAID, HIS 
THIRD ATTEMPT. 
THE FIRST TWO WERE BLOCKED 
ALMOST COMPLETELY BY THE LOWER 
COURTS, HE HAD LOST AT ALMOST 
EVERY TURN. 
AND SO TODAY THE SUPREME COURT 
SAID THAT THE THIRD TIME WAS A 
CHARM, THAT HE HAD FINALLY 
GOTTEN IT RIGHT. 
THE PRESIDENTS WERE ENTITLED TO 
DEFERENCE ON THESE KINDS OF 
QUESTIONS ON NATIONAL SECURITY 
AND PROTECTING OUR BORDERS 
HERE, AND THAT THIS BAN PASSED 
THAT KIND OF MUSTER AND THAT 
KIND OF REVIEW. 
THERE WERE FOUR DISSENTING 
JUSTICES, THE LIBERAL JUSTICES 
WROTE VERY SHARP DISSENTS 
SAYING THE COURT HAD REALLY 
FAILED TO CONSIDER THE 
DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ON 
MUSLIMS, THAT THIS WAS IN FACT 
A MUSLIM BAN, BUT THE 
ADMINISTRATION HAD ALWAYS SAID 
IT WAS NOT A MUSLIM BAN, THEY 
ARGUED THIS WHEN THE SUPREME 
COURT HEARD ARGUMENTS IN THE 
CASE LAST MONTH, OR BACK IN 
APRIL THAT THIS WAS NOT A 
MUSLIM BAN. 
IT WAS FIVE MOSTLY MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES AT THIS POINT, IT 
EXCLUDED THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
THE MUSLIM WORLD. 
AND TODAY THE SUPREME COURT IN 
THIS 5-4 DECISION AGREED THAT 
THIS WAS A LEGITIMATE AND 
REASONABLE EXERCISE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY. 
>> JAN CRAWFORD, THANKS. 
>>>  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
IS CALLING TODAY'S COURT 
DECISION ON THE PRESIDENT'S 
TRAVEL BAN, QUOTE, PROFOUND 
VIND INDICATION. 
THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A 
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT 
WHICH READS TODAY'S SUPREME 
COURT RULE SOMETHING A 
TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
THE SUPREME COURT HAS UPHELD 
THE CLEAR AUTHORITY OF THE 
PRESIDENT TO DEFEND THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
IN THIS ERA OF WORLDWIDE 
TERRORISM AND EXTREMIST 
MOVEMENTS BENT ON HARMING 
INNOCENT CIVILIANS, WE MUST 
PROPERLY VET THOSE COMING INTO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
I WANT TO BRING IN JORDAN 
FABIAN, A WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE HILL. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 
>> BEFORE WE DO THAT, LET'S 
LISTEN IN TO THE PRESIDENT. 
>> OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE AT 
THE TOP OF YOUR GAME, THE FACT 
THAT TODAY'S SUPREME COURT 
RULING JUST COMING OUT, A 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, A 
TREMENDOUS VICT VI FOR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE -- VICTORY FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOR OUR 
CONSTITUTION THIS. 
IS A GREAT VICTORY FOR OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH, AND WE 
HAVE TO BE SAFE, AND WE HAVE TO 
BE SECURE. 
AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE VET PEOPLE COMING 
INTO THE COUNTRY. 
WE KNOW WHO'S COMING IN, WE 
KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. 
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHO'S 
COMING HERE. 
THE RULING SHOWS THAT ALL OF 
THE ATTACKS FROM THE MEDIA AND 
THE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS ARE 
WRONG, AND THEY TURNED OUT TO 
BE VERY WRONG. 
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AS 
REPUBLICANS I CAN TELL YOU IS 
STRONG BORDERS, NO CRIME. 
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING 
AT IS OPEN BORDERS WHICH WILL 
BRING TREMENDOUS CRIME. 
IT'LL BRING MS-13 AND LOTS OF 
OTHERS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 
HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY. 
IT'LL BRING TREMENDOUS CRIME. 
SO I WILL ALWAYS BE DEFENDING 
THE SOVEREIGNTY, THE SAFETY AND 
THE SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
THAT'S WHY I WAS PUT HERE. 
WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY THE 
FUNDING OF THE WALL WHICH WE 
VERY MUCH NEED. 
WE STARTED THE WALL. 
WE'RE SPEND AGO LOT OF ENERGY 
AND A LOT OF TIME AND STARTED 
UP IN SAN DIEGO AND OTHER 
PLACES. 
IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION NOW. 
WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION. 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR AN 
INCREASE IN WALL SPENDING SO WE 
CAN FINISH IT QUICKER. 
IT STOPS THE DRUGS, IT STOPS 
PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO 
HAVE, AND IT GIVES US SECURITY 
AND SAFETY. 
AND WITH THAT, IF YOU -- I 
THINK WE MIGHT JUST TAKE A 
QUICK SPIN AROUND THE ROOM, 
TALK TO A COUPLE OF THE FOLKS 
AND MAYBE, SENATOR, I'LL ASK 
YOU, DO YOU WANT TO SAY A 
COUPLE OF WORDS ABOUT WHY WE'RE 
HERE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING? 
>> WELL, I THINK WITH THE 
LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN FREELAND 
HSEN AND CHAIRMAN SHELBY, WE'RE 
ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET THESE 
APPROPRIATIONS BILLS TO THE 
FLOOR AND GET THEM ON YOUR DESK 
AS YOU'VE INSISTED, NOT IN AN 
OMNIBUS. 
I THINK THE LAST TIME WE HAD A 
CONFERENCE REPORT ON THE SENATE 
FLOOR, THIS WOULD BE WHERE THE 
HOUSE PASSED A BILL AND WE 
DIDN'T, WE DIDN'T -- IT WAS 
2011. 
SO WE JUST PASSED THE FIRST 
THREE BILLS YESTERDAY THAT THE 
HOUSE HAD ALREADY PASSED AND 
WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO TRY TO 
GET BACK INTO BUSINESS IN A 
TRANSPARENT WAY SO THAT PEOPLE 
CAN SEE WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT 
IS DOING. 
>> YES. 
>> WE'RE IN THE FIRST QUARTER 
OF THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS. 
WE WANT TO USE THE -- IF YOU 
WANT TO USE THE FOOTBALL 
ANALOGY. 
WE'RE DOING WELL RIGHT NOW. 
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER. 
>> WE'RE JUST LISTENING IN TO 
THE PRESIDENT DISCUSS WHAT HE 
CALLS A TREMENDOUS VICTORY IN 
THE SUPREME COURT, THE SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICES SUPPORTING HIS 
TRAVEL BAN. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN JORDAN 
FABIAN, A WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE HILL. 
JORDAN, THE PRESIDENT CALLED 
THIS DECISION VINDICATION. 
BUT THIS WAS THE THIRD DRAFT OF 
HIS TRAVEL BAN. 
THE FIRST TWO, OF COURSE, AS WE 
ALL REMEMBER FROM THE PROTESTS 
DIDN'T GO SO WELL. 
SO WOULD YOU REALLY CALL THIS A 
DECISIVE VICTORY FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION? 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S A VICTORY 
IN THE SENSE NOW THEY CAN CARRY 
OUT THIS POLICY, AND WITH THAT 
STATEMENT -- WHAT THAT 
STATEMENT VINDICATION INDICATES 
IS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH THE 
LEGAL SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE IMMIGRATION 
ISSUE. 
HE EXPRESSED THAT FRUSTRATION 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS WE HEARD 
AFTER THE SUPREME COURT -- 
EXCUSE ME, LOWER COURTS STRUCK 
DOWN THAT ORIGINAL TRAVEL BAN. 
FOR MONTHS WE'VE HEARD HIM RAIL 
AGAINST HOW THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS 
HOLDING HIS IMMIGRATION BACK. 
NOW THE SUPREME COURT HAS GIVEN 
HIM THE GO AHEAD TO IMPLEMENT 
THIS TRAVEL BAN WHICH IS REALLY 
THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS 
IMMIGRATION AGENDA. 
SO INDEED A VICTORY TODAY FOR 
THE PRESIDENT. 
>> THE FIRST WAS MET WITH 
MASSIVE PROTESTS AND CONFUSION 
OVER HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT. 
WHAT DOES THIS DECISION SAY 
ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION 
CAN SUCCESSFULLY MOVE FORWARD 
ON POLICY? 
>> WELL, I THINK THE SIGNAL THE 
COURT IS SENDING IS THE 
ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO BE MORE 
CAREFUL. 
THE REASON THAT FIRST ORDER WAS 
STRUCK DOWN IS IT DIDN'T REALLY 
GO THROUGH ANY KIND OF PROCESS 
AND IT WAS OVERLY BROAD, AND 
THE COURTS RESPONDED BY 
STRIKING IT DOWN BEFORE IT 
COULD GO UNDER LEGAL REVIEW. 
THEY WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING 
BOARD, THEY CRAFTED SOMETHING 
THAT INCLUDES SOME CARVEOUTS, 
INCLUDES SOME EXCEPTIONS, 
INCLUDED COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH 
KOREA THAT'S NOT PREDOMINANTLY 
MUSLIM SO THEY COULD TRY TO 
CLAIM THAT IT'S NOT REALLY A 
MUSLIM BAN. 
SO THAT MIGHT BE A SIGN TO THIS 
ADMINISTRATION GOING FORWARD TO 
BE MORE CAREFUL. 
II MEAN, LOOK AT THE FAMILY -- 
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE FAMILY 
SEPARATION POLICY THAT'S GOING 
ON NOW. 
THEY ARE HAVING SOME ISSUES 
WITH THAT. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER HASTEILY 
DRAFTED ORDER THEY CAME OUT 
WITH, AND, AGAIN, IT MIGHT BE A 
CLUE TO THE DECISION MAKERS TO 
BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL. 
>> TO PLAN OUT THESE POLICIES 
WITH MORE DETAIL SO THAT THEY 
DON'T END UP BEING OPPOSED BY 
THE COURTS, END UP GETTING TO 
THE SUPREME COURT AND GOING 
THROUGH THIS LONG PROCESS. 
NOW, IN TERMS OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S REMARKS TODAY, HE 
SAID THAT WHAT HE IS PUSHING 
FOR IS STRONG BORDERS, NO 
CRIME, AND DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN 
BORDERS AND TREMENDOUS CRIME. 
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THAT 
ASKERTATION? 
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING IS THE PRESIDENT 
EMBOLDENED BY THIS COURT 
RULING, EVEN THOUGH, AGAIN, HE 
HAD THESE LEGAL PROBLEMS IN THE 
PAST. 
THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING 
FORWARD ON TWO THINGS RIGHT 
NOW, THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY 
WHICH HAS SULTED IN THESE 
CHILD SEPARATIONS. 
YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF HE'S 
GOING TO BE MORE STRONGLY 
PUSHING THAT GOING FORWARD 
AFTER ASSIGNING -- AFTER 
SIGNING THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER 
LAST WEEK TO STOP SOME OF THE 
SEPARATION, AND ALSO FUNDING 
FOR HIS BORDER WALL. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR 
FUNDING FIGHT WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING RUNS OUT IN 
SEPTEMBER. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS DEMANDED 
FUNDING BE IN THAT PACKAGE OR 
ELSE HE THREATENED THAT HE 
MIGHT SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. 
SO THE PRESIDENT NOW SEEING 
THAT THE COURT IS ON HIS SIDE 
ON ONE KEY IMMIGRATION ISSUE, 
VU TO WONDER IF HE'S GOING TO 
PUSH FORWARD EVEN MORE STRONGLY 
ON OTHER ELEMENTS OF THAT IN 
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. 
>> ON IMMIGRATION, THE HEALTH 
AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY 
SAYS HIS DEPARTMENT STILL HAS 
MORE THAN 2,000 IMMIGRANT 
CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM THEIR 
PARENTS IN THEIR CUSTODY. 
THAT'S AS A RESULT OF THE ZERO 
TOLERANCE POLICY. 
SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION 
SAYING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING 
TO REUNITE THEM AS OF NOW? 
>> THERE'S STILL LACK OF 
CLARITY OVER HOW THESE 
REUNIFICATIONS ARE TAKING 
PLACE. 
WE KNOW FOR SOME OF THEM 
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEIR 
PARENTS, BUT WE'VE HEARD MANY 
CASES FROM THE BORDER WHERE 
CHILDREN ARE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY 
AND THE RECORDS DON'T INDICATE 
WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE, BUT IF 
THEY DO, MAYBE NOT WHERE THEY 
ARE. 
SO THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
RIGHT NOW LOGISTICALLY TRYING 
TO REUNITE THESE PARENTS. 
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T 
REALLY PUT FORWARD ANY KIND OF 
POLICY OR PUSH TO REUNITE THESE 
CHILDREN. 
SO WHILE THIS ISSUE IS SORT OF 
-- HAS SORT OF FADED INTO THE 
BACKGROUND WITH THE SUPREME 
COURT DECISION NOW COMING DOWN 
ON THE TRAVEL BAN, IT'S STILL 
GOING TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE 
FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FIX 
THE MESS IT CREATED. 
>> HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE 
SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON THE 
TRAVEL BAN WILL AFFECT THE 
POLICY ON IMMIGRATION, WHAT 
KIND OF PRESSURE OR SIGNAL DOES 
THAT GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION? 
>> WELL, THE MAJORITY OF 
CONCERN OF THE JUSTICES HANDED 
THIS PRESIDENT A MAJOR VICTORY 
WHEN IT SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS 
WIDE LATITUDE UNDER EXECUTIVE 
POWER TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION 
LAW. 
SO THIS HAS BEEN A CENTRAL 
ARGUMENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S úHA 
THE POWER TO DO THINGS LIKE 
SPLIT UP FAMILIES, BAN PEOPLE 
FROM CERTAIN MUSLIM MAJORITY 
CURRENTS AND THE COURT SAID HE 
DOES -- COUNTRIES AND THE COURT 
SAID HE DOES. 
SO THAT BROAD STATEMENT FROM 
THE COURT COULD EMBOLDEN THE 
PRESIDENT TO TAKE EVEN MORE 
AGGRESSIVE ACTION GOING 
FORWARD. 
>> JORDAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR THOSE INSIGHTS. 
>>>  LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR 
CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT NANCY CORDES 
WHO'S ON THE HILL FOR US. 
NANCY, HOW ARE YOU DOING? 
>>REPORTER:  I'M DOING GREAT. 
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU, AIANA. 
>> GOOD TO TALK TO YOU TOO. 
WHAT'S BEEN THE REACTION FROM 
LAWMAKERS ON THE SUPREME COURT 
RULING ? 
>>REPORTER:  IT'S BEEN COMING 
DOWN PREDICTABLY ALONG PARTY 
LINES, DEMOCRATS OUTRAGED. 
THEY ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS A 
VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO WOULD 
DISCRIMINATE ON RACIAL AND 
RELIGIOUS GROUNDS. 
CHUCK SCHUMER, THE LEADER OF 
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE 
SAID THIS RULING DOESN'T MAKE 
US SAFER. 
THE TRAVEL BAN DOESN'T MAKE US 
SAFER, AND THE RULING DOESN'T 
MAKE IT RIGHT. 
REPUBLICANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, 
SAID, HEY, LOOK, THREE TIMES IS 
A CHARM. 
THE TRAVEL BAN THAT WENT BEFORE 
THE SUPREME COURT WAS WITHIN 
THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW. 
OBVIOUSLY THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT HAD TO TWEAK IT TO 
GET IT THERE, BUT THEY ARGUE 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD A RIGHT 
TO DO WHAT HE FELT WOULD KEEP 
THE COUNTRY SAFE. 
AND THERE'S EVEN A LITTLE BIT 
OF GLOATING GOING ON FROM THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE 
SENATE, MITCH McCONNELL. 
IT WAS MCCONNELL, OF COURSE, 
WHO HELD UP NOT JUST A A VOTE, 
-- NOT JUST A VOTE, BUT A 
HEARING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
PICK FOR SUPREME COURT FOR 
NEARLY A YEAR, MERRICK GARLAND, 
AND SO TODAY AFTER THAT RULING 
CAME DOWN, HIS CAMPAIGN FUND, 
TMITCH TWEETED OUT A PHOTO OF 
MCCONNELL SHAKING GARLAND'S 
HAND -- GORSUCH'S HAND, RATHER. 
NO CAPTION, BUT SIMPLY A 
REMINDER THAT IT IS THANKS TO 
MCCONNELL IN LARGE PART THAT WE 
SAW THIS 5-4 RULING TODAY. 
WE'VE SEEN A LITTLE BIT FROM A 
SMALL SLIVER OF REPUBLICANS, 
ADRIANA, WHO SAY THAT, YOU 
KNOW, THAT THOUGH THE 
ADMINISTRATION WAS FINALLY ABLE 
TO GET THIS PASSED THROUGH THE 
SUPREME COURT, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S INTENT CLEARLY 
DIFFERED FROM THE FINAL 
PRODUCT, THAT HE HAD MADE 
MULTIPLE STATEMENTS INDICATING 
THAT HE WANTED TO KEEP MUSLIMS 
OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, BUT BY AND 
LARGE YOU'RE HEARING AT LEAST 
OFFICIALLY A LOT OF RELIEF FROM 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TODAY 
>> NANCY, WE HEARD FROM SENATOR 
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL EARLIER 
TODAY. 
LET'S PLAY SOME OF HIS 
RESPONSE. 
>> CLEARLY THIS OPINION IS BY 
NO MEANS THE END OF THIS STORY. 
IT IS NO SOLUTION. 
THERE IS NO QUESTION THERE HAS 
TO BE LEGISLATION TO PROTECT 
OUR ESSENTIAL LIBERTIES, OUR 
IMAGE AROUND THE WORLD WHICH IS 
VERY MUCH AT RISK AND AT STAKE 
HERE. 
THE CONGRESS NOW HAS WORK TO 
DO. 
IT CANNOT SIMPLY ALLOW THE 
COURTS TO DETERMINE -- OR THE 
PRESIDENT WHAT OUR FUTURE IS IN 
THIS AREA. 
THERE NOW NEEDS TO BE 
LEGISLATION. 
>> SO, NANCY, THE SENATOR IS 
SUGGESTING CONGRESS WILL NEED 
TO GET INVOLVED, BUT HOW MUCH 
CAN THEY CHANGE THIS AND HOW 
REALISTIC WOULD THAT BE? 
>>REPORTER:  AS OF RIGHT NOW, 
ADRIANA, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO 
BE A HUGE APPETITE TO CHANGE 
THE LAW IN THIS AREA OR IN THE 
AREA OF GERRYMANDERING WHICH IS 
SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAME UP -- 
THAT THE SUPREME COURT RULED ON 
EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS 
UNLIKELY WITH CONGRESS UNABLE 
EVEN TO PASS A COMPREHENSIVE 
IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN THAT 
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS TO 
SUPPORT, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT 
THEY BE ABLE TO PASS SOMETHING 
THAT GOES AGAINST WHAT HE'S 
TRYING TO DO IN THIS ARENA IS 
PRETTY UNLIKELY, ESPECIALLY IN 
AN ELECTON YEAR. 
>> NANCY CORDES, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
>>>  AN OCCUPY I.C.E. 
MOVEMENT HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY FROM NEW YORK TO 
PORTLAND, CALLING FOR A CHANGE 
IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S 
POLICIES. 
THE PROTESTERS HAVE SET UP CAMP 
OUTSIDE SEVERAL OFFICES OF U.S. 
IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOMS 
ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING THE 
HEADQUARTERS SEEN HERE IN 
DETROIT, MICHIGAN WHICH THEY 
TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN ON 
MONDAY. 
PROTESTERS SAY THE EVENTUAL 
GOAL IS TO SHUT DOWN I.C.E. 
COMPLETELY AND TO END WHAT THEY 
CALL, QUOTE, INHUMANE AND 
IMMORAL TREATMENT OF IMMIGRANT 
FAMILIES. 
I.C.E. 
WAS FIRST CREATED IN 2003. 
>>> WE'RE LEARNING NEW DETAILS 
NOW ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT 
DETENTION CENTERS THAT ARE 
HOUSING UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN. 
GOVERNMENT HANDOUT VIDEOS SHOWS 
INSIDE SO-CALLED TENT CITIES IN 
TORNILLO, TEXAS. 
THERE'S MORE THAN 300 
UNDOCUMENTED TEENS HERE. 
IT COSTS ABOUT $700 A DAY PER 
CHILD TO CARE FOR THEM. 
OUR MIRYA VILLAREALE TOURED THE 
FACILITY YESTERDAY. 
SHE'S NEAR THE BORDER IN EL 
PASO JUST NORTHWEST OF 
TORNILLO. 
>>REPORTER:  FIRST THEY TOOK 
HER SON, THEN THEY TOOK HER TO 
JAIL. 
EDIS TELLS US SHE WAS SEPARATED 
FROM HER 6-YEAR-OLD SON AFTER 
THEY CROSSED THE BORDER. 
SHE BELIEVES HE'S IN ARIZONA. 
SHE SAYS SHE'S TRIED SEVERAL 
TIMES TO TRY TO TALK TO HER SON 
AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. 
SHE WAS RELEASE FROM A 
DETENTION CENTER AND IS ONE OF 
32 IMMIGRANT PARENTS PARENTS 
STAYING AT THE ENUNCIATION 
HOUSE IN EL PASO. 
>> THE LENGTH OF TIME THESE 
PARENTS HAVE BEEN IN DETENTION 
IS 25 DAYS. 
>>REPORTER:  TAYLOR LEVY IS THE 
COORDINATOR OF THE ENUNCIATION 
HOUSE. 
>> 95% OF THE FAMILY, THE 
PARENTS WE SPOKE TO HAVE NOT 
PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO THEIR 
CHILDREN SINCE BEING SEPARATED. 
>>REPORTER:  WE TOURED A TENT 
CITY IN TORNILLO, TEXAS MONDAY 
WHERE 326 TEENAGERS ARE BEING 
HOUSED. 
OUR CAMERAS WERE NOT ALLOWED 
INSIDE, BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
PROVIDED THIS VIDEO. 
WE LEARNED CHILDREN SPEND THEIR 
DAY ON A REGIMENTED MILITARY-
STYLE SCHEDULE. 
THEY EAT THREE MEALS A DAY AND 
ARE GIVEN TWO SNACKS, MANY OF 
THEM SPEND THEIR FREE TIME 
PLAYING SOCCER. 
THE TORNIILLO FACILITY HAS BEEN 
OPEN FOR NEARLY TWO WEEK, AND 
IN THAT TIME THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TELLS 
US 70 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN 
RELEASED TO FAMILY OR SPONSORS. 
>> WE'VE ESTABLISHED WHERE THE 
PARENTS ARE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY 
WHEN THE CHILD COMES INTO OUR 
CARE. 
>>REPORTER:  MARK WEBBER IS 
WITH H.H.S. 
>> OVERALL THESE KIDS ARE 
CONNECTED WITH THEIR PARENTS. 
>>REPORTER:  BUT ENUNCIATION 
HOUSE DIRECTOR RUBEN GARCIA 
DISAGREES. 
>> I HAVE 32 PARENTS HERE THAT 
WILL SAY TO HIM THAT IS 
CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE. 
>>REPORTER:  FEDERAL 
AUTHORITIES DISMISSED THE 
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THAT 
ENTIRE GROUP OF 32, ALTHOUGH 
THEY STILL HAVE THEIR 
IMMIGRATION CASES PENDING. 
THE INCIDENT COMMANDER AT THE 
TENT CITY IN TORNILLO SAYS THAT 
THIS FACILITY WAS BUILT 
SPECIFICALLY OF THE SEPARATION 
POLICY. 
HE CALL IT IS A DUMB, STUPID 
DECISION THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER 
BEEN MADE. 
MIRYA VILLAREALE, CBS NEWS, EL 
PASO, TEXAS. 
>>>  COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, 
A DEEP DIVE INTO A RED STATE. 
WHAT'S AT PLAY IN MISSISSIPPI 
IN THIS YEAR'S MIDTERMS. 
>>>  AND A SCIENTIST IS 
MURDERED WHILE ON A CAMPING 
TRIP. 
IS IT A PATTERN? 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> A SUPREME COURT RULING JUST 
COMING OUT, A TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS, A TREMENDOUS VICTORY 
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOR 
OUR CONSTITUTION. 
THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY FOR OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH, AND WE 
HAVE TO BE SAFE, AND WE HAVE TO 
BE SECURE. 
AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE VET PEOPLE COMING 
INTO THE COUNTRY. 
WE KNOW WHO'S COMING IN, WE 
KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. 
WE JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHO'S 
COMING HERE. 
THE RULING SHOWS THAT ALL OF 
THE ATTACKS FROM THE MEDIA AND 
THE DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS ARE 
WRONG AND THEY TURNED OUT TO BE 
VERY WRONG. 
>> THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REACTING TO THE RULING HANDED 
DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT THAT 
UPHOLDS HIS TRAVEL BAN ON SEVEN 
COUNTRIES. 
THEY INCLUDE SYRIA, LIBYA, 
IRAN, YEMEN, SOMALIA, NORTH 
KOREA AND VENEZUELA. 
FOR MORE LET'S BRING IN ILIA 
SHAPIRO FROM WASHINGTON. 
HE'S A SENIOR FELLOW IN 
CONSTITUTIONAL STUDIES AT THE 
CATO INSTITUTE. 
WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS 
DECISION, AND WHAT WAS YOUR 
MAJOR TAKEAWAY FROM THE RULING 
? 
>> I WASN'T SURPRISED THAT THE 
JUSTICES LET THE TRAVEL BAN 3.0 
STAY IN PLACE. 
THAT WAS THE CONVENTIONAL 
WISDOM BASED ON THEIR HAVING 
LET IT GO INTO EFFECT IN 
DECEMBER AND HAVING LET MOST OF 
THE SECOND ONE GO INTO EFFECT A 
YEAR AGO. 
THERE WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE ú 
VEHEMENT DISAGREEMENT. 
I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING MORE 
NARROW THAT WOULD GARNER MORE 
VOTES. 
BUT REGARDLESS, THE EFFECT IS 
THE SAME, BOTH BECAUSE OF THE 
GREAT DISCRETION THAT THESE 
IMMIGRATION -- THAT THE 
IMMIGRATION LAW GIVES TO THE 
PRESIDENT, THE PROVISIONS TO 
RESTRICT ENTRY TO CERTAIN 
CLASSES FS ALIENS BASED ON 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
CONSIDERATIONS AND THEN THE 
DEFERENCE THAT COURTS GIVE ON 
CONSTITUTIONAL AND OTHER 
QUESTIONS WHEN THE PRESIDENT -- 
WHEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS 
EXERCISING ITS NATIONAL 
SECURITY PREROGATIVE. 
SO I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH 
A FOUR GONE CONCLUSION. 
WHAT THE COURT IS EFFECTIVELY 
SAYING THAT ANY PRESIDENT, 
INCLUDING THIS ONE, THE SAME 
RULES APPLY, AND WE AS A COURT 
ARE NOT GOING TO SECOND GUESS 
THAT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO 
BALANCE THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED 
AND MAKE A DIFFERENT POLICY 
JUDGMENT, BUT JUST BASED ON THE 
NORMAL STANDARDS THAT APPLY. 
úT 
RESTRICTIONS AS PRESENTED ON 
THE FACE OF THE PROCLAMATION AS 
IT WAS CALLED ARE LEGITIMATE. 
AND THAT'S THE END OF IT. 
AND IF CONGRESS WANTS TO CHANGE 
THE STATUTOR BALANCE OF POWER, 
THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT, BUT 
COURTS ARE GOING TO DEFER AND 
THE CURRENT STATUTE IS VERY 
BROAD. 
>> SO THE OPINION HANDED DOWN 
BY THE COURT SAYS THE ORDER IS, 
QUOTE, SQUARELY WITHIN THE 
SCOPE OF PRESIDENTIAL 
AUTHORITY. 
HOW DOES THIS THEN DEFINE HOW 
MUCH UNILATERAL POWER THE 
PRESIDENT HAS? 
>> WELL, THE COURT GOES STATUTE 
BY STATUTE, TO AREA OF LAW TO 
AREA OF LAW. 
SO THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY 
HAVE ANY EFFECT ON PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND WHAT HE'S DOING WITH 
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION OR 
ANYTHING ELSE, OR ANY OTHER 
TYPE OF EXECUTIVE ACTION. 
THE COURT LOOKED AT THE TEXT OF 
THE RELEVANT IMMIGRATION 
STATUTE WHICH THE DISSENTING 
JUSTICES, THE MAJORITY POINTS 
OUT DON'T EVEN GRAPPLE WITH IN 
THEIR OPINIONS, AND FOUND THAT 
CONGRESS GIVES VERY BROAD -- 
NOT UNREVIEWABLE BY COURTS, BUT 
VERY BROAD AUTHORITY TO THE 
PRESIDENT, AND MOREOVER, ALL OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OR CANDIDATE 
TRUMP'S TWEETS AND OTHER 
STATEMENTS, THE CONTROVERSIAL 
FIERY RHETORIC AND WHATNOT, 
THEY LOOKED AT THAT, BUT THEN 
THEY SAY THERE WERE LEGITIMATE 
JUSTIFICATIONS AS WELL AND 
CARVEOUTS OF WHICH COUNTRIES 
AND IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE 
REFINERY TO COME TO -- REASON 
TO COME TO AMERICA AND THINGS 
LIKE THIS, THEY WEIGHED ALL OF 
THAT AND SAID, LOOK, WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO OVERTURN THE PRESIDENT 
ON NATIONAL SECURITY BASED ON 
THESE SPECULATIVE ASSERTIONS OF 
HIS NOT HAVING A GOOD ENOUGH 
POLICY REASON. 
SO, YEAH, IN THIS ONE AREA IN 
TERMS OF RESTRICTING ENTRY TO 
THE COUNTRY, THE COURT HAS SAID 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BROAD POWER. 
ANYTHING ELSE, THAT'S A 
SEPARATE CASE. 
>> NOW, JUST SPEAKING ABOUT THE 
JUSTICES IN PARTICULAR, NEIL 
GORSUCH HAS BEEN PRAISED BY 
REPUBLICANS FOR HIS ROLE IN THE 
RULING, WE SAW THAT PHOTO OF, 
YOU KNOW, THE HANDSHAKE JUST TO 
PRAISE THAT. 
THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS FOR 
MONTHS THAT CHIEF JUSTICE 
KENNEDY MAY RETIRE. 
SO WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR THE NEXT 
VACANCY? 
>> WELL, 24 HOURS FROM NOW WE 
MAY BE TALKING ABOUT THE LEGACY 
OF JUSTICE KENNEDY AND THE 
BATTLE FOR HIS SUCCESSOR. 
TOMORROW IS THE NEXT AND LAST 
DAY THAT THE COURT IS HANDING 
DOWN OPINIONS, OR WE MIGHT HEAR 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER, HE 
MIGHT SEND A TELEGRAM FROM 
SALTZBURG SAYING THAT. 
COURT IS POISED AS WE'VE SEEN. 
THE COURT DECIDED 5-4 TODAY THE 
TRAVEL BAN AND A FIRST 
AMENDMENT CASE OF A CALIFORNIA 
LAW WITH ABORTION CLINICS WHAT 
THEY HAVE TO SAY OR DON'T HAVE 
TO SAY. 
SO THAT NEXT JUSTICE IS GOING 
TO BE PIVOTAL. 
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP OR ANOTHER 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IS ALLOWED 
TO CONFIRM HIS NOMINEE, THEN 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS 
EFFECTIVELY BECOMES THE 
MAJORITY OF THE COURT, THE 
COURT'S BALANCE SHIFTS RIGHT IN 
MANY WAYS. 
IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, NOBODY 
IS CONFIRMED OR THE DEMOCRATS 
TAKE THE SENATE AND THERE'S 
THAT VACANCY THAT REMAINS, THEN 
THAT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCE AS WELL. 
SO JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS MEAN 
THINGS. 
WE LEARNED THAT IN THE 2016 
ELECTION WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE 
THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD NOT 
HAVE WON WITHOUT THE SCALIA 
VACANCY CRYSTALLIZING THE ISSUE 
FOR MANY VOTERS. 
SO THAT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO 
BE A BIG CAMPAIGN ISSUE IN 
NOVEMBER WHETHER A NEW JUSTICE 
WILL HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED OR NOT 
BY THEN. 
>> WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. 
ILYA SHAPIRO, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR JOINING US. 
>> MY PLEASURE. 
>>>  VOTERS IN SEVEN STATES ARE 
HEADING TO THE POLLS TODAY, 
COLORADO, MARYLAND, NEW YORK, 
OKLAHOMA AND UTAH HAVE THEIR 
PRIMARIES. 
MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTH CAROLINA 
ARE HOLDING RUNOFF ELECTIONS. 
FOR CAMPAIGN 2018 LOCAL 
MATTERS, WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER 
LOOK AT MISSISSIPPI. 
VOTERS THERE ARE DECIDING WHO 
WILL BE ON THE BALLOT FOR THIS 
NOVEMBER FOR HOUSE AND SENATE 
RACES. 
MISSISSIPPI DEMOCRATS ARE 
CHOOSING BETWEEN A PARTY 
STALWART AND A NEWCOMER FOR THE 
NOMINATION TO THE U.S. SENATE. 
STATEHOUSE MINORITY LEADER 
DAVID BREA AND VENTURE 
CAPITALIST HOWARD SHERMAN 
FINISHED FIRST AND SECOND IN A 
SIX-CANDIDATE JUNE 5th PRIMARY. 
TWO REPUBLICANS ARE BATTLING TO 
REPRESENT THE STATE'S THIRD 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. 
THAT RACE IS BETWEEN DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY MIKE LAGUEST AND 
BUSINESS CONSULTANT WHIT 
HUGHES. 
BOBBY HARRISON IS THE SENIOR 
CRIMINAL REPORTER FOR 
MISSISSIPPI TODAY. 
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM JACKSON, 
MISSISSIPPI. 
BOBBY, LET'S START WITH THE 
SENATE RACE. 
GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON BOTH 
BARIA AND SHERMAN. 
>> WELL, AS YOU SAID, BARRIA IS 
THE STATEHOUSE DEMOCRATIC 
LEADER. 
HE'S A THIRD-TERM LEGISLATOR. 
HE'S BEEN SORT OF A SOLID VOICE 
FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE 
LEGISLATURE, AND HOWARD SHERMAN 
IS A VENTURE CAPITALIST WHO 
SORT OF MADE HIS MONEY IN LOS 
ANGELES WHICH IS WHERE HE'S 
FROM, CALIFORNIA, BUT HE'S ALSO 
THE HUSBAND OF MISSISSIPPI 
PERSON CELIA WARD, AN EMMY-
AWARD WINNING ACTRESS AND WELL 
THOUGHT OF IN THIS STATE, AND 
THEY NOW LIVE IN MERIDIAN, 
MISSISSIPPI, AND HE'S COME BACK 
AND OPTED AROUND FOR THIS 
SENATE SEAT, AND IT'S TURNED 
INTO QUITE A BATTLE BETWEEN 
SHERMAN AND BARIA. 
THEY BOTH HAVE RUN A SPIRITED 
CAMPAIGN. 
BARIA HAS GOTTEN THE 
ENDORSEMENTS OF MOST OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTED OFFICIALS IN 
THE STATE, NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT 
MOST OF THEM. 
AND SHERMAN HAS KIND OF 
DEPENDED A LOT ON HIS OWN DEEP 
POCKETS TO FINANCE HIS RACE, 
AND HE'S DONE BETTER THAN A LOT 
OF PEOPLE EXPECTED. 
YOU KNOW, HIS MONEY MAKES A BIG 
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
POLITICS BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY 
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL ELECTIONS 
DEMOCRATS IN MISSISSIPPI HAVE 
HAD A HARD TIME RAISING MONEY 
FOR THEIR CAMPAIGNS. 
SO SHERMAN HAS PUT ABOUT 
$850,000 AT LEAST OF HIS OWN 
MONEY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. 
IT'S MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. 
>> NOW, IT WAS SUCH A CLOSE 
RACE IN THE PRIMARIES WITH -- 
THEY WERE EACH WITHIN ABOUT 1% 
OF EACH OTHER ON JUNE 5th. 
SO WHO DO YOU THINK MIGHT COME 
OUT AHEAD TODAY, AND HOW MUCH 
DOES IT REALLY MATTER IN 
NOVEMBER? 
>> WELL, THOSE ARE BOTH GOOD 
QUESTIONS, AND THE FIRST 
QUESTION, I MEAN, IT'S SO MUCH 
-- I MEAN, THE VOTE, THE 
TURNOUT WAS REAL LOW AND THE 
VOTE WAS SO CLOSE IT DEPENDS ON 
WHICH CANDIDATE IS ABLE TO GET 
HIS VOTE BACK TO THE POLLS 
TODAY. 
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS SCHOOL 
OF THOUGHT THAT BARIA WHO HAS 
DEEP ROOTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY IN MISSISSIPPI, HIS 
VOTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO COME 
BACK TO THE POLLS FOR A RUNOFF, 
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHERMAN, AS I 
SAID, HAS RUN A SPIRITED 
CAMPAIGN AND HAS WORKED REAL 
HARD. 
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S ANYBODY'S 
GUESS I THINK. 
I WON'T BE SURPRISED EITHER 
WAY. 
NOW, AS FAR AS NOVEMBER, ROGER 
WICKER IS A REPUBLICAN. 
HE'S CONSIDERED A HEAVY 
FAVORITE TO WIN RE-ELECTION. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN 
INTERESTING RACE AND BOTH BARIA 
AND SHERMAN ARE RUNNING 
LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGNS WHICH 
ALWAYS DOESN'T OCCUR IN 
MISSISSIPPI WHEN THERE'S A 
STRONG REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT 
ALREADY IN OFFICE. 
THEY RUN LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGNS, 
AND THEY'RE RUNNING IT AS TRUE 
DEMOCRATS. 
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO 
RUN NECESSARILY TO THE MIDDLE. 
I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT RUNNING WAY 
OUT TO THE LEFT, BUT AT TRUE 
DEMOCRATS. 
THEY BOTH CRITICIZE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WHICH IS UNUSUAL IN 
MISSISSIPPI POLITICS, YOU KNOW, 
VARIOUS THOUGHTS 
ABOUT RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, 
SO THEY'RE RUNNING TRUE 
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS, WHICH, AS 
I SAID, IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE 
CASE IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN 
MISSISSIPPI. 
THERE'S A TENDENCY TO TRY TO 
RUN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE. 
SO I GUESS THEY'RE VIEWING THAT 
THERE'S A DEMOCRATIC BASE OUT 
THERE THAT THEY CAN TAP INTO 
THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP THEM 
TODAY BUT MAYBE EVEN CARRY THEM 
IN NOVEMBER IN THE GENERAL 
ELECTION. 
>> DO YOU THINK EITHER OF THEM 
REALLY STAND A CHANCE IN SUCH A 
RED STATE? 
AND HOW PIVOTAL IS THIS SEAT IN 
THE SENATE? 
>> IT'S CONSIDERED A SAFE 
REPUBLICAN SEAT. 
SO, I MEAN, IF EITHER ONE OF 
THEM -- IF THE WINNER WON TODAY 
WHO WINS IN NOVEMBER IT WILL BE 
THE BIGGEST POLITICAL UPSET. 
I'VE BEEN COVERING MISSISSIPPI 
POLITICS FOR A LONG TIME, IT 
WILL BE THE BIGGEST POLITICAL 
UPSET THAT I'VE SEEN IF IT 
OCCURRED. 
BUT THERE ARE A FEW WILDCARDS 
IN PLAY THAT COULD MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE. 
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, WHILE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS POPULAR IN 
MISSISSIPPI, YOU KNOW, THERE IS 
SOME RESENTMENT TOWARD HIM AND 
PRETTY ENTHUSIASTIC THAT 
RESENTMENT. 
THERE'S ALSO A SPECIAL SENATE 
ELECTION ON THAT SAME DAY. 
THAD COCHRAN WHO IS ANOTHER 
U.S. SENATOR RESIGNED EARLIER 
THIS YEAR FOR HEALTH REASONS, 
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A 
SPECIAL ELECTION TO REPLACE 
HIM. 
AND THAT ELECTION IS GETTING A 
LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE MIKE 
ESPY IS RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT. 
HE WAS THE FIRST BLACK ELECTED 
TO CONGRESS FROM MISSISSIPPI 
SIN RECONSTRUCTION, AND HE'S 
ALSO WITH THE SECOND IN THE 
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. 
AND SOME PEOPLE THINK HE CAN 
ENERGIZE A SIZEABLE AFRICAN-
AMERICAN VOTE BASE AND MAKE 
THAT ELECTION, THE SPECIAL 
ELECTION AS WELL AS THE WICKER 
ELECTION CLOSER THAN IT MIGHT 
NORMALLY BE. 
>> WELL, WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S 
ANY KIND OF SIGNS FOR AN UPSET. 
BOBBY HARRISON, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
>>>  COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, 
CBS NEWS ANCHOR JEFF GLOR TALKS 
WITH VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 
CIVILITY AND THE MORALITY OF 
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS ON 
IMMIGRATION. 
>>> AND SOME HARLEY DAVIDSON 
HOGS WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN 
EUROPE BECAUSE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S TRADE POLICIES. 
NOW HE'S THREATENING WITH NEW 
TAXES. 
DETAILS AHEAD. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>>  USED IT AS AN EXCUSE. 
I THINK PEOPLE THAT RIDE 
HARLEYS ARE NOT HAPPY WITH 
HARLEY DAVIDSON AND I WOULDN'T 
BE EITHER. 
BUT MOSTLY COMPANIES ARE COMING 
BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. 
I WAS THE ONE THAT EXPLAINED TO 
HARLEY ABOUT 100% TAX IN INDIA 
WHERE THEY HAD A TARIFF OF 
100%. 
AND I GOT IT DOWN TO A MUCH 
LOWER NUMBER. 
I THINK IT'S 50% WHICH IS FAR 
TOO MUCH, BUT THEY WERE PAYING 
100% TARIFF. 
NOW PRIME MINISTER MODI BROUGHT 
IT WAY DOWN, BUT IT'S STILL WAY 
TOO HIGH. 
I WILL SAY THIS, JOHN, OTHER 
COUNTRIES ARE NEGOTIATING, AND 
WITHOUT TARIFFS YOU COULD NEVER 
DO THAT. 
AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO 
NEGOTIATE, THEN WE'LL DO THE 
TARIFFS. 
AND JUST REMEMBER WITH THE BANK 
-- 
>> THAT WAS PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP TODAY REACTING TO HARLEY 
DAVIDSON'S DECISION TO MOVE 
SOME OF ITS PRODUCTION 
OVERSEAS. 
THE REASON? 
THE E.U.'S RETALIATORY TARIFFS 
AFTER THE PRESIDENT IMPOSED 
TARIFFS ON ALUMINUM AND STEEL 
IMPORTS. 
FOR MORE WE TURN TO THE 
"WASHINGTON POST"'S FINANCIAL 
WRITER COVERING TRADE AND 
GLOBALIZATION DAVID LYNCH. 
DAVID, THANKS FOR JOINING US. 
>> SURE. 
>> AFTER THREATENING ALLIES AT 
A CONTENTIOUS G7 SUMMIT, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW SEEMS TO BE 
CAUSING MORE CONTROVERSY BY 
THREATENING AMERICAN COMPANIES 
LIKE HARLEY DAVIDSON WITH 
TAXES. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE 
OVERALL END GAME FOR THE WHITE 
HOUSE WITH THIS APPROACH? 
>> WELL, IT'S PROBABLY ANYONE'S 
GUESS, BUT THERE'S TWO POSSIBLE 
OUTCOMES, EITHER THESE TARIFFS 
GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE LEVERAGE 
THAT HE'S SEEKING TO HAVE A 
NGOTIATION WITH EUROPE AND 
PRESUMABLY REDUCE TRADE 
BARRIERS ACROSS THE BOARD, OR 
THEY STAY IN PLACE AND WE'RE ON 
OUR WAY TO A TIT-FOR-TAT TRADE 
WAR. 
>> NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT 
HE'S DOING HERE IS TAKING AN 
AMERICA FIRST APPROACH TO 
TRADE. 
BUT HARLEY DAVIDSON IS STILL 
PLANNING ON SENDING A PORTION 
OF ITS PRODUCTION OVERSEAS. 
SO DOES THE HARLEY MOVE SHOW 
THAT THE PRESIDENT'S TRADE 
APPROACH IS BACKFIRING? 
>> WELL, IT CERTAINLY SHOWS 
THAT THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT. 
A TRADE WAR IS LIKE ANY OTHER 
WAR, THE OTHER SIDE GETS TO 
SHOOT BACK. 
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT PUT 
THESE STEEL AND ALUMINUM 
TARIFFS IN PLACE, THE EUROPEAN 
UNION SAID THEY WOULD 
RETALIATED, AND THAT MEANS 
MANUFACTURERS THAT WANT TO SHIP 
PRODUCTS TO EUROPE LIKE HARLEY 
DAVIDSON FACE HIGHER TARIFFS. 
THAT REDUCES DEMAND FOR THEIR 
PRODUCTS IN EUROPE, AND THAT'S 
AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM FOR THEM. 
AND NOW HARLEY IS DOING PRETTY 
MUCH WHAT YOU'D EXPECT A 
COMPANY TO DO. 
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND A MORE 
EFFECTIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE 
WAY OF GETTING THEIR PRODUCT 
INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR 
CUSTOMERS. 
AND IN THIS CASE THAT MEANS NOT 
MAKING IN THE UNITED STATES 
ANYMORE, BUT MAKING IT 
OVERSEAS. 
>> SO THE E.U.'S TAXES WEREN'T 
JUST PLACED ON COMPANIES LIKE 
HARLEY DAVIDSON, BASED OUT OF 
WISCONSIN, OF COURSE, BUT ALSO 
BOURBON FROM KENTUCKY AND 
TOBACCO IN NORTH CAROLINA. 
DO YOU THINK THE EUROPEAN 
TARIFFS ARE STRATEGICALLY 
TARGETING POLITICALLY IMPORTANT 
STATES TO THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION? 
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT 
THAT'S THE CASE, AS IS THE CASE 
WITH THE TRADE CONFLICT GOING 
ON WITH CHINA. 
OUR U.S. TRADING PARTNERS 
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY TO BRING 
PRESSURE TO BEAR IN THE U.S. 
SYSTEM IS TO CAUSE COMPANIES 
AND THEIR WORKERS PAIN IN 
POLITICALLY IMPORTANT STATES. 
THE HOPE ON THE PART OF THE 
TRADING PARTNERS IS THAT THOSE 
COMPANIES COMPLAIN TO THEIR 
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND 
THEY IN TURN GO TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND SAY, LOOK, YOU'RE 
GOING TO KILL US IN THE FALL IN 
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, UNLESS 
YOU BACK OFF FROM SOME OF THESE 
TARIFFS. 
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE MESSAGE 
THAT MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN 
LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL HAVE 
BEEN DELIVERING TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE PRIVATELY. 
>> SO IF THIS IS INDEED A TRADE 
WAR AS YOU SAY, IS THIS A SIGN 
THAT THE E.U. 
MAY HAVE AN EDGE ON THE UNITED 
STATES AND WILL OTHER COMPANIES 
FOLLOW SUIT? 
>> WELL, OTHER COMPANIES ARE 
CERTAINLY GOING TO FEEL THE 
SAME EFFECTS THAT HARLEY 
DAVIDSON IS FEELING. 
WHETHER THE E.U. 
HAS AN EDGE OR NOT I DON'T 
KNOW. 
I MEAN, WHAT MANY TRADE EXPERTS 
SAY ABOUT THESE SORT OF 
COMMERCIAL CONFLICTS IS THAT 
THERE'S REALLY NO WINNER, THAT 
BOTH SIDES IN A TRADE WAR END 
UP WORSE OFF, AND THAT MAY BE 
WHERE WE'RE HEADED. 
>> DAVID LYNCH, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
>>>  IN A 5-4 RULING TODAY 
ALONG PARTISAN LINE, THE U.S. 
SUPREME COURT UPHELD PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN ON 
SEVERAL PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES. 
THE BAN LIMITS THE NUMBER OF 
VISAS GRANTED TO TRAVELERS FROM 
FIVE PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES, IRAN, LIBYA, 
SOMALIA, SYRIA AND YEMEN. 
IT ALSO ADDS RESTRICTIONS TO 
PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA AND 
VENEZUELA. 
THIS IS THE THIRD VERSION OF 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S TRAVEL 
BAN. 
THE RULING REVERSES A SERIES OF 
LOWER COURT DECISIONS THAT HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY BEEN STRUCK DOWN. 
THE BAN IS -- STRUCK DOWN THE 
BAN AS ILLEGAL AND 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE LAST 
15 MONTHS. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SUPPORTED 
THE COURT'S OTHER FOUR 
CONSERVATIVES IN AN ISSUED 
OPINION HE WROTE THE 
PROCLAMATION IS WITHIN THE, 
QUOTE, SCOPE OF PRESIDENTIAL 
AUTHORITY. 
TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP APPLAUDED 
THAT DECISION WITH WITH LUNCH 
WITH CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS. 
>> TODAY'S SUPREME COURT RULING 
JUST COMING OUT A TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS, A TREMENDOUS VICTORY 
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOR 
OUR CONSTITUTION. 
THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY FOR OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH AND WE HAVE 
TO BE SAFE, AND WE HAVE TO BE 
SECURE. 
AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE VET PEOPLE COMING 
INTO THE COUNTRY. 
WE KNOW WHO'S COMING IN, WE 
KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. 
>> CBS NEWS WASHINGTON 
CORRESPONDENT PAULA READ JOINS 
US NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 
PAULA, THIS WAS A HUGE WIN FOR 
THE PRESIDENT. 
COULD THE SUPREME COURT 
DECISION ENCOURAGE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION TO 
TAKE EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE MOVES 
TO CUT DOWN ON TRAVEL FROM MORE 
MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRIES? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, YOU'RE 
RIGHT. 
THIS WAS A HUGE WIN. 
THIS WAS HIS FIRST BIG VICTORY 
AT THE SUPREME COURT, HIS FIRST 
BIG LEGAL CHALLENGE AT THE 
SUPREME COURT, AND HE WON. 
SO THIS WAS A RARE DAY HERE AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE HE GETS 
TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A VICTORY 
LAP BECAUSE HERE CHIEF JUSTICE 
JOHN ROBERTS, HE UPHELD A VERY 
EXPANSIVE DEFINITION OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY TO DECIDE 
WHO COMES IN AND OUT OF THIS 
COUNTRY. 
AND, YES, THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD ADD 
ADDITIONAL MUSLIM COUNTRIES 
GOING FORWARD, BUT THE MORE 
IMMEDIATE QUESTION IS WHETHER 
OR NOT THIS WILL EMBOLDEN THE 
PRESIDENT ON IMMIGRATION. 
AS WE HEARD RIGHT THERE WHEN HE 
WAS MEETING WITH CONGRESSIONAL 
LEADERS, HE REITERATED HIS NEED 
TO CONTROL WHO COMES IN AND OUT 
OF THIS COUNTRY FOR NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
SO THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME 
COURT HAS HANDED HIM A VICTORY 
HERE AND VALIDATED THIS BROAD 
SCOPE OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL 
AUTHORITY ON NATIONAL SECURITY, 
WE WOULD EXPECT THIS MAY 
EMBOLDEN HIM IN TERMS OF HIS 
LANGUAGE AND A POLICY ON THE 
IMMIGRATION ISSUE. 
>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS 
REALLY AFFECTS HIS APPROACH 
WITH THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE 
THAT'S UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW AT 
THE BORDER. 
NOW, IN TERMS OF THE TRAVEL 
BAN, THIS WAS THE THIRD VERSION 
OF THE TRAVEL BAN, AND THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ARGUED 
THIS VERSION WOULD BE DIFFERENT 
AND WAS CONSIDERED A WATERED 
DOWN VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL 
PLAN. 
HOW DIFFERENT WAS IT REALLY, 
AND WHAT WERE THE IMPORTANT 
POINTS THAT YOU THINK ALLOWED 
THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD IT? 
>> WELL, IT WAS INCREDIBLY 
DIFFERENT. 
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE FIRST 
TRAVEL BAN THAT WAS ISSUED JUST 
WITHIN HIS FIRST FEW DAYS IN 
OFFICE THAT THAT REALLY WOULD 
HAVE PASSED MUSTER AT THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
I REMEMBER THE DAY THAT WAS 
PASSED. 
WE CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY. 
THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS 
COMING, THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW 
THEY WERE GOING TO IMPLEMENT 
IT. 
THAT FIRST TRAVEL BAN, IT HAD 
NO EXCEPTIONS FOR ANY SORT OF 
UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. 
IT DID APPEAR TO BE SORT OF A 
BLANKET MUSLIM BAN WITH NO 
FORWARD THINKING LOGISTICAL 
COORDINATION ACROSS 
ADMINISTRATIONS. 
FOR THE SECOND TRAVEL BAN, THE 
ADMINISTRATION WAS A LITTLE 
MORE FULLY FORMED. 
AT THAT POINT HE HAD A 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
CHIEF, HE HAD AN ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, AND THEY HELPED ADVISE 
HIM BASED ON THINGS THAT JUDGES 
HAD SPECIFICALLY SAID WAS WRONG 
WITH THE FIRST ONE. 
THEN THEY DID ANOTHER ITERATION 
BEFORE THE SECOND ONE GOT ALL 
THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT, 
AND IT DOES SEEM TO BE A MORE 
FULLY REALIZED VERSION OF THIS 
POLICY. 
THERE WERE SURVEYS THAT THEY 
DID WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO 
REALLY VET EACH COUNTRY IN 
TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE 
COUNTRIES WERE ACTUALLY 
PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION 
ABOUT THEIR CITIZENS WHO ARE 
COMING HERE, AND THEY MADE A 
DECISION TO INCLUDE THIS GROUP 
OF COUNTRIES, AND IT WASN'T 
JUST PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM 
COUNTRIES. 
THEY OBVIOUSLY ADDITIONALLY 
ADDED NORTH KOREA AND 
VENEZUELA, SO IT SEEMED LESS 
LIKE A QUOTE, UNQUOTE MUSLIM 
BAN THAT WAS KNOCKED DOWN IN 
THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS AND MORE 
LIKE A NATIONAL SECURITY 
POLICY. 
>> I WONDER HOW THAT BAN ON 
CERTAIN NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS 
WILL AFFECT THIS NOW MOVING 
FORWARD AS THINGS HAVE BEEN 
GETTING A LITTLE BIT LESS TENSE 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND NORTH 
KOREA. 
BUT FOCUSING ON THE BORDER AND 
THE WALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 
HE WILL ASK CONGRESS FOR 
INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE WALL. 
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS RULING 
WILL AFFECT HIS EFFORTS TO 
RECEIVE THAT FUNDING ? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, IT WAS 
INTERESTING WATCHING AT HIS 
CONGRESSIONAL LEADER HOSS CAME 
HERE TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY. 
MANY OF THEM WERE HOPING TO GET 
SOME ANSWERS ON WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT REALLY DOES SUPPORT 
THE GOP COMPROMISE ON 
IMMIGRATION, AND THE FIRST TIME 
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED 
IMMIGRATION AFTER TAKING A 
VICTORY LAP ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT WAS TO TALK ABOUT FUNDING 
FOR THE BORDER WALL AND HOW HE 
CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THAT 
IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING 
SECURITY AT THE BORDER. 
HE BELIEVES THAT WALL WOULD 
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM COMING HERE 
AND ALSO BRINGING DRUGS AND 
OTHER THINGS HERE. 
HE BELIEVESTHAT REALLY IS THE 
SOLUTION, AND ANY SORT OF 
LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE, HE 
WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S 
NOT ONLY GETTING THE FUNDED 
ALLOCATED BUT THAT IT'S 
ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED. 
AND THAT WAS A KEY DIFFERENCE 
IN THE TWO GOP PROPOSALS ON 
IMMIGRATION. 
THE MORE HARD LINE APPROACH, WE 
THOUGHT A LOT OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS WOULD 
REALLY LIKE. 
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT WASN'T GUARANTEED 
FUNDING FOR A BORDER WALL. 
NOW THE GOP COMPROMISE BILL, 
THAT WILL GIVE HIM THE MONEY 
FOR HIS BORDER WALL, BUT AT 
THIS POINT, ADRIANA, IT DOESN'T 
APPEAR THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO 
HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT TO 
PASS. 
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT JUST 
LAST WEEK TWEETED THAT THEY 
SHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER WITH IT 
UNTIL THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS RED 
WAVE AS HE DESCRIBES IT, IT, A 
VICTORY IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS, SO HE CAN GET 
EVERYTHING HE WANTS ON 
IMMIGRATION, INCLUDING MONEY 
FOR THAT BORDER WALL.

DOCTOR FOR A ROUTINE CHECKUP. 
>> THEY CALLED ME AND SAID HE 
HAD ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. 
WE WERE, LIKE, WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN, LIKE HOW IS THAT 
POSSIBLE? 
>>REPORTER:  THE GLAZIER'S 
FOUND THAT OLD LEAD-BASED PAINT 
IN THE HOME BUILT IN 1927 WAS 
CONTAMINATING MUCH OF THE 
HOUSE. 
>> THE WINDOW SILL TESTED 
POSITIVE FOR LEAD PAINT. 
HE WAS JUST SITTING THERE 
WATCHING FOR DADDY AND GOT 
SICK. 
>>REPORTER:  THE GLAZIERS SAID 
ANDREW'S LEAD LEVELS WERE FOUR 
TIMES MORE THAN WHAT'S 
CONSIDERED ELEVATED. 
WAS THERE SORT OF GUILT AS A 
PARENT? 
>> CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. 
>> OH, YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  LEAD POISONING CAN 
CAUSE LIFELONG BEHAVIOR AND 
LEARNING PROBLEMS, LOWER I.Q. 
AND SLOWED GROWTH.
