HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI CATCHING HEAT FOR THESE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ECONOMY UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO ME IN MY LIFE? THAT MEANS I NEED A BIGGER PAYCHECK. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, IT'S ABOUT WAGES RISING IN OUR COUNTRY SO THAT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS RESTORED. TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND YOU SAID, YOU REMEMBER THIS. I WILL NOT TOUCH SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT PAUL RYAN. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. $500 BILLION IN MEDICARE, MASSIVE CUTS IN EDUCATION AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS. HE'S GOING TO WAR AGAINST WORKING PEOPLE. SAW A NEW FOX NEWS PULLOUT SHOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT 44 WHICH MIGHT BE AT THE HIGHEST. AND THE KEY DRIVER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY. THERE YOU SEE IT ON THE SCREEN, I THINK IT WAS 52%. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FACT THAT LEADING DEMOCRATS FOR PELOSI, SANDERS AND OTHERS, ARE WILL LIKE, WHAT ABOUT WAGES. THAT'S THE FASTEST WILL RISE IN WHICH A SINCE 2009. AND IT'S MY PLEASURE TO FACT-CHECK YOU. IT IS. 0.3 IS THE LAST, SINCE HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT, WAGES HAVE BEEN UP CLOSE TO 3% AND THAT'S A FACT. ALSO, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AT AN 18 YEAR HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT PELOSI IS TALKING ABOUT, WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH, THE JOB WAS NUMBERS ARE DOWN, AND DIGNITY 13, THOSE ARE JUST MADE TO ORDER REPUBLICAN ADS. WE WERE LAUGHING DURING THE BREAK ABOUT IT, SHE COULD NOT CUT A BETTER AD FOR THE REPUBLICANS. NANCY, WE LOVE YOU. SO KIMBERLY, BERNIE SANDERS SAYS THIS IS A WAR ON WORKING PEOPLE BEING WAGED BY THE PRESIDENT WHO WANTS HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER CUT MEDICARE, MEDICAID OR SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME BUT IN FACT HIS BUDGETS LOOK INTENT ON DOING JUST THAT. Kimberly: I THINK BERNIE SANDERS HAS BEEN HAVING TOO MANY CAFETERIA LUNCHES WITH NANCY PELOSI BECAUSE THEY BOTH SEEMED CONFUSED. THEIR COMMENTS ARE ONLY HELPING TO MOTIVATE THE PRESIDENTS SPACE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF THEIR ILLOGICAL COMMENTS AND STATEMENTS. WHEN YOU SEE AN ECONOMY BOOMING LIKE THIS, YOU SEE WOMEN, MINORITIES AND BLACKS ALL ENGAGED IN THE ECONOMY, RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AMERICA WANTED. THIS IS WHY HE WAS ELECTED. YOU SEE HERE IS SOMEBODY LIKE NANCY PELOSI WHO IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH, DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. ONE GAP AFTER THE NEXT. IF THAT'S THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY ARE IN BIG TROUBLE GOING INTO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND GOING INTO 2020. THAT'S A PROBLEM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS RIGHT NOW, THAT SOMETHING SUSTAINABLE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF TALKING POINTS BUT THEY ARE NOT OUT OF GAS. Juan: DANA, GOING BACK TO THE POLLING, WHEEZING COMING FROM PELOSI IS AN ARGUMENT THAT, WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE WAGES, THEY CAN'T PAY FOR HEALTH CARE. THEY CAN. FOR THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THEY CAN'T PAY FOR THE KIDS TO GO TO COLLEGE. ARE WE SEEING THE EVOLUTION OF DEMOCRATS MESSAGING FOR THAT? Dana: IT'S NOT LIKE SHE IS MAKING GAS, SHE IS ACTUALLY SPENDING MONEY ON ADS. SO IF SOMEONE IS TELLING THEM THAT THIS MESSAGE WORKS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR VOTERS. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THIS THAT THE REPUBLICANS JUST NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT IS, THE PRESIDENT'S NUMBERS ARE BETTER, THE GENERIC BALLOT IS BETTER. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO REGISTER NEW VOTERS. AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS UNTIL THE OTHER DAY. IN THE VIRGINIA ELECTION FOR THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE LAST NOVEMBER, MORE REPUBLICANS TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR THE ELECTION THEN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. AND STILL ED GILLESPIE LOST. 12% OF THE VOTERS IN THAT ELECTION HAD NEVER VOTED IN A GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION BEFORE US OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHERE TO GO AND REGISTER NEW VOTERS AND GETTING THEM TO THE POLLS. NO MATTER WHAT THE ECONOMIC RESULTS ARE, THEY CAN GET THEIR PEOPLE TO THE POLLS MORE THAN REPUBLICANS. IT SOUNDS LIKE VOTER FRAUD. Juan: BY THE WAY, EXPECT TO PLUS NINE IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATS FOR A GENERIC PREFERENCE. GREG, I WAS LOOKING AT THE POLLS AND, OF COURSE PEOPLE WHO LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY THAT ECONOMY IS THEIR NUMBER ONE REASON FOR LIKING PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO I SAID, WHAT DO PEOPLE BECAUSE HE'S STILL UNDERWATER, 44 OR 45% APPROVE. 51% DISAPPROVE. SO I SAID WHY DO PEOPLE DISAPPROVE OF A PRESIDENT THAT GREG AND JESSE AND KIMBERLY LOVE SO MUCH? AND DANA. Juan: THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT PEOPLE DISAPPROVE IS HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. NUMBER TWO, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT FOR THE JOB, NUMBER THREE, HE'S DIVISIVE AND RACIST. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I THINK YOU JUST POST A QUESTION THAT YOU WANTED TO EXPRESS YOUR OWN OPINIONS WITHIN. YOU KNOW YOU ARE LOSING, DEMOCRATS ARE LOSING WHEN YOU ARE MARKING LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. SO THIS WEEK YOU ARE MOCKING LOW AND EMPLOYMENT, LAST WEEK YOU WERE DEFENDING MS-13. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT, COME OUT IN FAVOR OF MEASLES? WHEN THEY SHOW HER, THE CALIFORNIA LEADER, THE PICTURES OF THOSE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS UNDER OVERPASSES IN CALIFORNIA, SHE CALLS THEM CALIFORNIA
