ABOUT THE 2016 WIN

10
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,220
WAS IT JUST A FLUKE AS SOME

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,422
PUNDITS HAVE INDICATED OR DOES

12
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,625
IT REPRESENT A FUNDAMENTAL

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,827
ELECTORAL SHIFT IN OUR NATION'S

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,429
POLITICS THAT COULD IMPACT

15
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,097
TOMORROW NIGHT'S ELECTION AND

16
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,800
PERHAPS ALL OF AMERICAN POLITICS

THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE GREAT

YOU DOCUMENTED 2016 IN-DEPTH

24
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,119
PICKING UP ON SOME OF THESE

25
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,921
TRENDS BEFORE THEY REALLY

26
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,323
SURFACED ON ELECTION NIGHT.

27
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,490
SURPRISED LOT OF PEOPLE.

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,025
LET ME ASK YOU FIRST.

29
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,027
AS YOU LISTEN TO THAT DISCUSSION

30
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,096
ABOUT THESE PRIMARIES TONIGHT,

31
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,431
THIS IS WHAT'S BREWING.

32
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,866
WHAT IS YOUR HANDLE ON WHAT

33
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,268
MIGHT HAPPEN BASED ON WHAT

34
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,302
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING?

35
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,236
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY

36
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:09,637
INTERESTING.

37
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,738
BRAD AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT

38
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,040
THIS BEFORE WE WENT ON.

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,343
EVERYONE TRYING TO GRAB THE

40
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,611
MANTLE OF THE DONALD TRUMP

41
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,045
CANDIDATE.

42
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,613
THEY'RE TRYING TO PICK UP

43
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:23,017
PORTIONS THAT THEY THINK THEY

44
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:23,951
REFLECT THE MOST.

45
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,421
THAT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE

46
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:27,822
ELECTORATE.

47
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:30,725
IT'S STILL SORT OF UNSETTLED.

48
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,660
IT IS STILL AGAINST THE STATUS

49
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,930
QUO AND IT IS INTERESTED IN

50
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,133
DISRUPTING WHAT'S GOING ON IN

51
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:39,500
ELECTIONS.

52
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,235
IT'S NOT WILLING TO LISTEN TO

53
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,104
WHAT WASHINGTON IS TELLING THEM.

54
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:46,440
>> IF YOU LISTEN TO THE FOLKS ON

55
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,242
THE LIBERAL SIDE OF THE FENCE,

56
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,544
THEY THINK THIS PRESIDENCY IS A

57
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:50,911
DISASTER.

58
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,546
THEY THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A

59
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,448
HUGE BLUE WAVE COMING.

60
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,050
IS WHAT YOU GUYS DOCUMENT IN

61
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,351
THIS BOOK, SOMETHING THAT WILL

62
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,753
CONTINUE TO IMPACT THESE

63
00:01:58,753 --> 00:01:59,120
POLITICS.

64
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,488
ARE THEY RIGHT OR YOU GUYS

65
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,222
RIGHT?

66
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,057
>> YOU SEE IN THE OHIO

67
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,792
GOVERNOR'S RACE, TWO DEMOCRATS

68
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,728
MIGHT BE DESCRIBED NUTTIER.

69
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,929
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN RADICALIZED

70
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,564
IN THIS PROCESS.

71
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,466
THE REASON OUR BOOK, IF YOU

72
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,635
DIDN'T SEE THE TRUMP WAVE

73
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,671
COMING, IF YOU DIDN'T SEE

74
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,140
POPULIST AND CONSERVATIVES WHICH

75
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,207
CHANGED THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY

76
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,642
AND CHANGE THE COALITION.

77
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,044
THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.

78
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,346
IT'S CONTINUED ON IN COMMERCIAL.

79
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,349
THE NFL, DICK'S SPORTING GOODS.

80
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,650
COMMERCE IS BEING DISRUPTED BY

81
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,220
THE SAME COALITION.

82
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,356
>> IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU WOULD

83
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,658
THINK THAT WEST VIRGINIA IS

84
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,760
GOING TO BE BECOME RED.

85
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,761
IT MAY NOT.

86
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,229
MANCHIN IS VERY POPULAR IN HIS

87
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,231
HOME STATE.

88
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,267
>> IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO

89
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,568
SORT OUT AT THIS POINT.

90
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,837
I WOULD SAY LOOK MAYBE IN AUGUST

91
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:50,971
AND SEPTEMBER.

92
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,574
SEE WHAT KIND OF CAMPAIGNS

93
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,643
THEY'RE RUNNING AND WHAT THEY

94
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,545
ARE SAYING IS APPEALING TO

95
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:57,878
VOTERS.

96
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,246
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

97
00:02:59,246 --> 00:02:59,747
ECONOMY.

98
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,749
THEY STILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT

99
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:06,554
THE ECONOMY AND HOW THEY'RE

100
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,488
TREATED WITH RESPECT.

101
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:11,792
THIS IS A CULTURE THAT FEELS IT

102
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,363
NOT BEEN RESPECTED.

103
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:22,069
NOT JUST POLITICS BUT BY BIG

104
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,070
BUSINESS AND SPORT.

105
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,272
THEIR IMPACT IS WELL BEYOND THE

106
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:25,739
BALLOT BOX.

107
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,540
THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE

108
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,274
READ THE BOOK.

109
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,876
I THINK THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND

110
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,479
THERE'S A MOVEMENT GOING ON.

111
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,880
WE'RE STILL NOT LISTENING TO

112
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,048
WHAT ITS TELLING US.

113
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,350
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M CURIOUS

114
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,884
ABOUT.

115
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,689
WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE --

116
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,656
DEVICIVENESS IN THE COUNTRY.

117
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,359
YOU SEE THE RIGHT GOING FURTHER

118
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,060
RIGHT.

119
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,962
AND YOU SEE LEFT.

120
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,464
YOU SEE THIS TRUMP PHENOMENON.

121
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,565
YOU GOT LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

122
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,167
MIDDLE WHO SORT OF WANT TO GO

123
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,370
BACK TO WHERE THINGS WERE.

124
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,272
I THINK MOST REPUBLICAN

125
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,674
CANDIDATES WHO MAYBE LIKE THAT

126
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,475
MIDDLE ZONE.

127
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,377
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT?

128
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,278
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE

129
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:04,678
PARTIES?

130
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,181
>> WE DID A SURVEY OF TRUMP

131
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,516
VOTERS IN THE FIVE STATES THAT

132
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,484
FLIPPED FROM OBAMA TO TRUMP.

133
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:15,890
BY FAR, 89% OF THEM BLAMED BOTH

134
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,757
PARTIES.

135
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,093
73% SAY BIG BUSINESSES CAN'T BE

136
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:19,793
TRUSTED.

137
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:23,597
THERE'S A POPULOUS FUSION THAT

138
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,266
SAY BIG GOVERNMENT BIG BUSINESS,

139
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,267
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE.

140
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,669
HUGE NUMBER OF TRUMP VOTERS IN

141
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,504
OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA AND IOWA

142
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,072
AND WISCONSIN, THOSE VOTERS

143
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,208
VOTED FOR OBAMA TWICE.

144
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,677
THEY DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WANTED

145
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,611
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.

146
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,380
THEY WERE WILLING TO BREAK

147
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,616
PARTING TRADITIONS TO SWITCH.

148
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,851
WE HAVE A STORY IN THE BOOK.

149
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,085
YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE

150
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,087
THOUGHT PROCESS HOW PEOPLE CAN

151
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,255
SWITCH FROM BARACK OBAMA TO

152
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,390
DONALD TRUMP.

153
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,358
THIS THE POOK FOR BUT YOU

154
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,394
>> WHAT ABOUT NOVEMBER YOU

155
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,163
HEARING THERE'S BIG BLUE WAVE

156
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:56,697
COMING.

157
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,501
THE POLLS HAVE SHOWN TO BE

158
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:00,901
UNRELIABLE.

159
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,071
DO YOU BELIEVE THE POLLS?

160
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,372
>> WELL, I THINK POLLSTER HAVE A

161
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,007
HARD TIME WITH TALKING TO

162
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:07,408
PEOPLE.

163
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,343
IT'S PART OF A DISTRUST.

164
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,212
PEOPLE DON'T TRUST TO GIVE THEIR

165
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:12,079
INFORMATION TO POLLSTERS.

166
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,481
THAT'S PART OF IT.

167
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,383
I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE AREN'T

168
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,419
HONEST WHEN THEY'RE POLLED.

169
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,720
I THINK NOVEMBER, WHEN I'M GOING

170
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,590
TO BE WATCHING ARE THE SENATE

171
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:22,890
RACES.

172
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,994
THERE ARE TEN SEATS THAT WERE

173
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,496
HELD BY DEMOCRATS THAT TRUMP

174
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:29,830
WON.

175
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,799
NOT IN THE SMALL WAY.

176
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,766
TAKE MISSOURI.

177
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,070
>> FIVE STATES DEMOCRATS

178
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,805
INCUMBENTS HOLD THAT ARE UP FOR

179
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:38,372
REELECTION.

180
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,273
BMW

181

00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,242

184
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,910
-- DONALD TRUMP WON BY 18

185
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,377
POINTS.

186
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,812
>> WE'LL SEE LOT OF THOSE IN

187
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:45,613
ACTION TOMORROW NIGHT.

188
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:49,917
WHICH MAKES THIS A REALLY

189
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,319
INTERESTING ELECTION NIGHT.

190
00:05:52,319 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S VERY INTERESTING.
