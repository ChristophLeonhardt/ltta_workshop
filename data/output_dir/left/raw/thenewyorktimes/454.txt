1
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,340
I had just gotten out of high school
when Pearl Harbor was bombed

2
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:33,044
and changed our lives.
By 1942, the order would come

3
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:36,214
and we would have to move out.

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,034
We would get sandstorms,
frequently.

5
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:54,544
And the sand would seep into the
living quarters and everything

6
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:59,004
else you forget when
these storms started.

7
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,554
We became “no-noes” so-called.
We were protesting because we

8
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:29,704
weren't being treated as citizens.

9
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:36,226
There were guards, armed guards.
If people got too close to the

10
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:40,574
fence and looked suspicious,
you’d be shot.

11
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:57,184
Tule Lake has really affected my,
my life. Because for a long time

12
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,844
I thought that I was
responsible for it.

13
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:06,034
But the truth is that
I was just the victim.

14
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,104
We have to remember what's
guaranteed in the Constitution,

15
00:02:13,104 --> 00:00:00,000
because it seems that it’s
easy to disregard it, somehow.
