1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,030
>>YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP DID
WHAT HE DOES, HE DENIGRATED

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,120
ENTIRE COUNTRIES AND COMMUNITIES
BY WONDERING ALOUD DURING AN

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,750
OFFICIAL MEETING, WHERE THERE
WERE PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM WERE

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,810
HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND
LIKELY TO SQUEAL, WHY WE SHOULD

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,720
TAKE IMMIGRANTS FROM, QUOTE,
SHITHOLE COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,410
THE CARIBBEAN.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,280
MULTIPLE TIMES,
HE SAID THAT.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
AGAIN, THIS WAS

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,860
NOT WELL HE WAS SITTING IN BED
WITH A CHEESEBURGER WATCHING FOX

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,549
NEWS, HE WAS WITH REPUBLICAN AND
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND THEIR

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,700
STAFF, SO THAT CAME OUT.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,070
HE IS GOING TO DENY HE SAID
THAT, HE TWEETED THIS THIS

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,070
MORNING --

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:48,650
>>BECAUSE WHAT HE CARES ABOUT
IS THE DREAMERS, HE WANTS TO

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,650
HELP THE DREAMERS.

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,650
HE WENT ON TO
SAY --

17
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,130
>>IT USUALLY WORKS OUT WELL
WHEN PRESIDENTS START RECORDING

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,130
ALL THEIR MEETINGS,
HISTORICALLY.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,130
SO HE'S DENYING

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,770
IT, LET'S TURN TO ONE OF THE
INDIVIDUALS WHO WAS AT THE

21
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,770
MEETING, SENATOR DICK DURBIN.

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,059
>>AS SENATOR GRAHAM MADE HIS
PRESENTATION, THE PRESIDENT

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,399
INTERRUPTED HIM SEVERAL TIMES
WITH QUESTIONS AND IN THE COURSE

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,739
OF HIS COMMENTS SAID THINGS
WHICH WERE HATE FILLED, VILE,

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,740
AND RACIST.

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,080
I USE THOSE WORDS
ADVISEDLY, I UNDERSTAND HOW

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,860
POWERFUL THEY ARE, BUT I CANNOT
BELIEVE IN THE HISTORY OF THE

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,330
WHITE HOUSE AND THAT OVAL OFFICE
AND HE PRESIDENT HAS EVER SPOKEN

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:21,360
THE WORDS THAT I PERSONALLY
HEARD OUR PRESIDENT SPEAK

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,810
YESTERDAY.

31
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:35,240
YOU'VE SEEN THE
COMMENTS IN THE PRESS, I HAVE

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:51,170
NOT READ ONE OF THEM THAT'S
INACCURATE.

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,540
>>I DISAGREE IN PART.

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,909
MAYBE
THEY'VE NEVER LITERALLY

35
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,880
SAID SHITHOLE COUNTRIES BUT I'M
SURE PRESIDENTS HAVE SAID

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,460
SOME AWFUL STUFF.

37
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,780
>>HAVE YOU HEARD THOSE
RECORDINGS OF NIXON OR LBJ?

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,780
LBJ

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,340
WAS TALKING TO HIS TAILOR ABOUT
HIS BUNGHOLE.

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,010
>>HE MIGHT HOT HAVE SAID
SHITHOLE BUT HE SAID BUNGHOLE.

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,819
>>TO NO SURPRISE THE PRESIDENT
STARTED TWEETING THIS MORNING,

42
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,069
DENYING HE USED THOSE WORDS.

43
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,432
IT
IS NOT TRUE, HE SAID THESE HATE

44
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,900
FILLED THINGS AND HE SAID THEM
REPEATEDLY.

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,079
WHEN A QUESTION WAS

46
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:37,159
RAISED ABOUT HAITIANS, FOR
EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A GROUP THAT

47
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,169
HAVE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS
IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE

48
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:46,390
THEY WERE THE VICTIMS OF CRISES
AND DISASTERS AND POLITICAL

49
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,750
OF PEOPLE, THE LARGEST GROUP IS
EL SALVADOR, THE SECOND IS

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:58,209
HONDURAS, THE THIRD IS HAITIAN,
AND WHEN I MENTIONED THAT HE

51
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,209
SAID HAITIANS, DO WE NEED MORE
HAITIANS?

52
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,669
>>AND SUGGESTED PERHAPS, FULLY
AT RANDOM, THAT INSTEAD WE COULD

53
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:05,809
PERHAPS HAVE MORE PEOPLE FROM
NORWAY.

54
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:06,809
JUST COINCIDENTALLY IT

55
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:11,299
WAS NORWAY, WHICH I SPENT SIX
WEEKS IN THIS YEAR, AND IT WAS A

56
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:15,160
LOVELY COUNTRY FOR VERY INVITING
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A POLITICAL AND

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,900
ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT I WOULD
LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO MOVE

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,019
CLOSER TO.

59
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,900
BUT THEY ARE ALSO
NOTABLY QUITE WHITE.

60
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
ALTHOUGH

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,599
NOT UNIVERSALLY, MUCH MORE SO
THAN HAITI PERHAPS.

62
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,909
THAT COULD HAVE TIED INTO WHY HE
SUGGESTED NORWAY.

63
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,409
>>I WAS GOOD TO ASK, WAS
EVERYONE YOU MET ITCHING TO COME

64
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,209
HERE?

65
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,909
HOW CAN WE GET TO
THE UNITED STATES?

66
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,810
I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND DIDN'T
HAVE TO PAY, AND I FEEL

67
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,349
LIKE THIS ISN'T FREEDOM AT ALL.

68
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,760
>>IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A
FREELOADER WHEN I WALKED OUT

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
WITHOUT GOING BANKRUPT, I WANT
TO FEEL LIKE I'M INVESTED IN THE

70
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
SYSTEM.

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,469
NO, AND IN FACT
APPARENTLY LAST YEAR ONLY 500

72
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:56,209
NORWEGIANS CAME TO AMERICA TO
LIVE HERE.

73
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,159
>>IF TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
DEMENTIA, ALCHEMY ALWAYS

74
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,150
REMEMBERS TO BE RACIST EVERY
DAY?

75
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,500
>>CHECKMATE.

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,709
>>THEY SAY THAT'S THE LAST
THING TO GO.

77
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:17,849
>>ONE THING THAT MIGHT PLAY
INCOME EVERYONE HE SAYS HE

78
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,029
REPEATS THE SAME THING OVER AND
OVER A LOT, INCREASINGLY IN

79
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,259
SMALL PERIODS OF TIME.

80
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,130
WHICH
MIGHT MEAN THAT HIM REPEATEDLY

81
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,319
SAYING THEY ARE SHITHOLE
COUNTRIES IS IT TECHNICALLY AS

82
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,259
BAD AS IF WE REPEATEDLY SAY IT,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT

83
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,870
TO SAY THE SAME THING OVER AND
OVER, BUT IF HE IS JUST ADDLED

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,419
THEN MAYBE HE'S JUST A
RUN-OF-THE-MILL RACIST AND NOT

85
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,449
AN ESPECIALLY TERRIBLE RACIST.

86
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,449
MAYBE.

87
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,750
>>I'LL JUST SAY THIS, THAT I
REALLY AM SHOCKED TO FIND OUT

88
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,260
HE'S REALLY A RACIST.

89
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,740
HE'S BEEN
A RACIST SINCE THE MOMENT HE

90
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,210
OPENED HIS MOUTH, HE CHASED
BARACK OBAMA AROUND FOR FOUR

91
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,100
YEARS ASKING FOR HIS BIRTH
CERTIFICATE, MEXICANS ARE

92
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,370
RACIST, MUSLIMS CHEERED 9/11 --

93
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,819
>>THE CENTRAL PART FIVE,
HOUSING PRACTICES, IT'S NOT

94
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,039
LIKE THERE WEREN'T CLUES.

95
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,150
>>THERE ARE GOOD NAZIS.

96
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,689
HOW CAN
YOU SAY THERE ARE GOOD NAZIS?

97
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:19,680
>>I AGREE, I THINK THE REASON
THIS ONE STANDS OUT A LITTLE BIT

98
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,990
IS NOT FOR SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE
SAID BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE

99
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,870
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO FIGHT AS
HARD AS POSSIBLE TO NOT STATE

100
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,659
THE OBVIOUS ARE STARTING TO
STATE THE OBVIOUS A LITTLE BIT.

101
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:34,189
ANDERSON COOPER AND DON LEMON
WERE GOING ON SAYING WE HAVE TO

102
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,349
BE HONEST, THESE ARE RACIST
COMMENTS.

103
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,349
WHEREAS A LOT OF THE

104
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,300
STUFF YOU'VE LISTED THERE,
PEOPLE BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,530
TRY TO EXCUSE OR SAY OH WELL, WE
DISAGREE AND EVERYTHING, BUT

106
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,410
THERE ARE HONORABLE POLITICIANS
ON BOTH SIDES AND EVERYTHING.

107
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,410
SO

108
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,229
IF THIS STANDS OUT THEN GOOD, IT
SHOULD, BECAUSE THIS IS

109
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,980
PARTICULAR RACISM, SOME OF THE
OTHER EXAMPLES YOU GAVE ARE GOOD

110
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,669
FOR THIS TOO, BUT THIS ISN'T
JUST A BAD COMMENT, THIS

111
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,270
DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE POLITICAL
DISCUSSION THEY ARE HAVING IN

112
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,770
THEIR MEETINGS RIGHT NOW.

113
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,099
WHAT
SORTS OF GROUPS WILL GET LEGAL

114
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,819
PROTECTIONS, WHICH GROUPS WILL
BE PRIORITIZED OR NOT WHEN IT

115
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,830
COMES TO IMMIGRATION POLICY?

116
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,550
THIS AFFECTS POTENTIALLY WHEN HE

117
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,130
GOES ABROAD THE DIPLOMACY WE
HAVE, DEALS WE MAKE WITH OTHER

118
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,130
COUNTRIES.

119
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,590
IF HE THINKS ENTIRE
REGIONS OF THE WORLD ARE

120
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,020
"SHITHOLES," THEN WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN WE TRY TO LIST THOSE

121
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,749
COUNTRIES IN CLIMATE RELATED
DEALS, SECURITY DEALS, THINGS

122
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:26,749
LIKE THAT?

123
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:28,430
ECONOMIC DEALS, TRADE
DEALS?

124
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,360
>>THIS WILL ULTIMATELY HELP
TRUMP WITH HIS BASE.

125
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
>>I AGREE.

126
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,710
>>AND PROBABLY HALF THE COUNTRY.

127
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,530
>>I'VE SAID 37%, I HOPE IT'S
NOT HALF.

128
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,969
YOU THINK IT'S HALF?

129
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,860
>>THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE RACIST WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR

130
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
TRUMP, I BET.

131
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,120
OR SOME.

132
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,479
>>THAT'S POSSIBLE.

133
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,539
>>THIS WILL ONLY HELP HIM.

134
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,889
IT
KIND OF MAKES ME GIGGLE WHEN WE

135
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,330
TALK ABOUT HE CALLED IT A
SHITHOLE, WHY ARE PEOPLE FROM

136
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,249
SHITHOLE COUNTRIES COMING HERE?

137
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,580
IT MAKES ME LAUGH BECAUSE HE

138
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:07,259
TALKS LIKE ALL THE GUYS I USED
TO WORK WITH, GROW UP WITH,

139
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,779
THAT'S HOW THOSE GUYS TALK.

140
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:11,800
ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,919
THERE ARE THOSE GUYS GOING,
YEAH, HE TOLD THE TRUTH, PEOPLE

142
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,729
ARE GETTING ON HIM NOW.

143
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,779
>>IT'S POSSIBLE.

144
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,949
>>COME ON, HAITI IS A
SHITHOLE.

145
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:22,949
YOU WANT TO GO LIVE

146
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:25,000
THERE?

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,180
IT MAKES TRUMP LOOK LIKE A TRUTH
TELLER WHO IS GETTING SHIT

148
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,699
ON BY THE LIBERAL ELITE.

149
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,419
>>EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE LABELING
THESE COUNTRIES SHITHOLES

150
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,349
BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS FANCY AS
HIS GOLDEN THRONES IS A PRETTY

151
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,500
DAMN ELITIST THING TO SAY IN THE
FIRST PLACE.

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,639
>>IF YOU WERE DRUNK AND THROWING
UP IN TRUMP'S PENTHOUSE

153
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,960
APARTMENT, YOU WOULDN'T THROW UP
IN A GOLD TOILET AND THINK, AM I

154
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,460
IN TRUMP'S HOUSE OR THE VATICAN?

155
00:07:52,460 --> 00:00:00,000
>>EITHER WAY IS A GOOD PLACE TO
PUKE BUT WHERE AM I?
