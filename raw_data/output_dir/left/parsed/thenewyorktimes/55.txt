See it?
Yeah.
Am I just seeing things?
Oh, jeez.
Oh, they’re people.
Oh.
Oh, jeez, they’re people.
They’re people.
They’re people.
I’m going to
take us right here
to this tree where there
in shade and there is sun,
so you could have
which ever you prefer.
So we don’t get
in everyone’s way,
if we can stay over here
on the left hand side,
we’ll be in good shape.
The memorial is
designed for you
to make physical
contact with it,
to actually touch the names.
So do not feel that the
appropriate behavior
that shows respect
is to be standoffish.
It is not.
The only thing
that we do ask —
and I really doubt that any
of you would have the impulse
to do this anyhow —
do not put things on the name.
Coats, elbows, cups,
bags, anything like that.
The other thing I
want to say to you
is this was truly — you’re 
an international group
of people —
this was the World
Trade Center.
People from over 90 countries
died here that morning.
They were Christians, Jews,
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists,
atheists.
Some made their way in
the world washing dishes,
others ran powerful companies,
but almost every single one
of them dies that morning
because they do something
that all of us do with
most of our lives —
they woke up and
they went to work.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
There’s no smoking
in the plaza.
No smoking in the plaza.
That’s quite all right.
Thank you.
So I want to talk to
you about the pools.
Directly in front of
you is the south pool.
The south pool stands in the
footprint of the South Tower,
World Trade Center number two.
So that’s exactly where
World Trade Center number two
stood.
Can everyone see
that line of trees
that goes around the pool?
That line of trees
represents the outer wall
of the building.
So that means in
a few minutes when
we go up to see the falls
and you go past those trees,
you will be standing in what
was once the lobby of World
Trade Center number two.
You’re going to see the falls.
The falls come out in
individual rivulets,
one for each person
killed on 9/11.
Goes down about 20 feet
or so into a huge pool.
In the center of the
pool, another opening
goes on another 10 feet or so.
No matter how
hard you try, you
can’t see the bottom of that
opening because it’s a void,
and the void is a
symbol of the emptiness
that we feel here
over the loss of life.
I’m sure all of you can see
the water under the names.
That water comes
directly from the pool.
What someone will do,
visiting a loved one —
and please feel free to
do the very, very same —
take their hand,
put it in the water,
rub their hand over a name.
Water, of course,
a symbol of life.
And notice how the
names are on the wall.
They are not arranged
in alphabetical order.
For example, people who
worked in the same office
in this building,
they’re together.
Firefighters out on the
same firehouse, together.
Police officers out of
the same police precinct,
together.
We call that
meaningful adjacencies.
People together in
death just the way
they were together in life.
I have a stupid question.
The names of the killers.
Are they —
Absolutely not.
Not.
Absolutely not.
Yeah.
The only place
you’ll find them
is if you should
go into the museum,
there’s a special part
that deals with Al Qaeda.
