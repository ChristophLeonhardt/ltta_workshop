in 2013 the left went nuts over a rodeo clown the rodeo clown was performing at the Missouri State Fair he had the awful temerity to wear a mask of then President Obama we're going to stump Obama now announcer said hey I know I'm a clown the rodeo clown replied he's just running around acting like one doesn't know he is one the media quoted a bystander who compared the act to a KKK rally lieutenant governor of the state condemned the act as did one of the Senators the rodeo clown was fired even though he dressed up as other presidents in the past and on the exact same routine fast forward four years on Tuesday TMZ posted photos of comedian Kathy Griffin was helped host CNN's New Year's Eve coverage for a decade holding a mock-up of President severed head covered in blood Griffin has a long record of anti-trump sentiment of course in February she told MSNBC's Chris Matthews quote I'm big resister and I don't believe in compromise with this president I also think he's crazy I think he's mentally ill he's also an idiot but this photo should cross a rather obvious line it celebrated Trump's perspective murder imagine if anyone on the right had done something similar with Obama the outcry would have been deafening yet the same people who asked for trigger warnings for material that might offend anyone the same people who believe there's a rape culture that pervades America the same people who say president Trump has incentivized the culture of political violence across the land many of them are silent about Griffin's antics why because political violence is no longer taboo in the u.s. it's just another tactic to utilize when useful and when useful and denigrate when others engaged in it that sentiment expresses itself on both sides of the political aisle when Montana House candidate Greg Ginn Forte allegedly body-slammed a reporter prominent conservatives including talk show host Laura Ingraham meaning his victim is was and champion Gian Forte is a sort of stalwart man's man when leftist attacked Trump rallies during the 2016 election cycle the media attempted to paint them as the defenders of the common good against Trump himself the overuse for a cycle of violence is often used by the press to refer to situations in which an aggressor acts violently and somebody defends them but we've entered an actual cycle in political violent rhetoric whereby the violence of the left provokes a direct response from the right and vice versa and it's getting worse if you spend all day proclaiming that you're in a civil war with other Americans that you're part of a resistance it's only a matter of time until you become willing to look the other way at violence itself if Americans aren't your brothers and sisters if we disagree then they will quickly become your enemies Kathy Griffin may think it's hilarious to hold up a bloody head of the President of the United States but she's tearing away at the social fabric far more than president Trump is and those who backs her play are helping provoke their enemies to respond in kind I'm Ben Shapiro this is dementia Pierrot show so Donald Trump today very very very

the program we continue to bring it to you okay so president Trump in my absence I leave for two days and many a thing has happened but the big thing that happened is a very good thing and that is President Trump came out and he rejected the Paris Accord so for people who don't know what the Paris Accord is I think that it's important to spell what this is out so people understand first of all it was basically it basically the Accord was President Obama in the very last days of his administration he went to Paris and he met with all of these nations and they all agreed to voluntarily submit these non-binding resolutions on how they were going to cut their carbon emissions that's basically what it was now there are a couple problems here number one non-binding number two none of the resolutions was rejected and there was nobody there who said well you know Congo you did a terrible job here this is you know that whatever country it is France you're not recommending that you cut enough China you're not recommending you cut enough so we reject your resolution we want you to bring a new resolution to the table and here's an enforcement mechanism basically it was like you and a group of your friends pledged that you're going to lose weight and you get to pick your own targets so you have a friend who comes in and says I want to lose one pound over the next six months everybody a and a friend really needs to lose 50 pounds not a useful thing also no enforcement mechanism so if they don't lose the 1 pound nobody says to them that was kind of bad you said you're going to lose a pound and you didn't so it was basically just a bunch of people slapping each other on the back pretending they were doing something for the world when actually they weren't doing anything for the world Trump pulls out of the Accord because what he says is it's just a way for people to generate anti-us headlines in other words we bomb acum it'ld to a bunch of resolutions about lowering lowering our carbon emissions that we were never going to be knowing that his successor would then have to eat it right that we didn't meet those resolutions then his successor the United States would then be labeled as backing off its commitments being ripped up and down he was making a promise that somebody else's body was going to have to cash and because of that Trump says look this whole agreement is a joke and we're pulling out so Trump speaks yesterday and he gives a very good speech this is why he was elected you know it was for stuff like this here he was explaining what exactly it would do to the United States to abide by the actual resolutions that we had adopted with regard to the Paris Accord compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the owners energy restrictions at his place in the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates this includes four hundred and forty thousand fewer manufacturing jobs not what we need believe me this is not what we need including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely they rely for so much and we would be giving them so little according to the same study by 2040 compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors paper down 12% cement down 23% iron and steel down 38% coal and I happen to love the coal miners down 86% natural gas down 31% ok so the reason that this is good what he's doing right here is he's spelling out a trade-off that Obama refused to acknowledge actually occurs and that trade-off is if you place heavy regulations on American industries jobs are lost if you place heavy regulations on American carbon emissions then there's going to be an economic cost to that and people on the right and the left pretend that this is not the case Trump you'll see later actually pretends the opposite is the case he says well we can have all the environmental as we want and we can also have as much economic growth as we want ie not super true but his balance is closer to the correct balance that Obama's balance was close to the correct balance so he spells out the cost to Americans and he's not going to lose a single vote in 2018 or 2020 based on this there are a lot of people who feel like these regulations and I've spoken in Pennsylvania recently you talk to manufacturers in Pennsylvania they are afraid the regulations are going to destroy their industry and they are right he continues along these lines and he points out that there would be a lot of loss in the economy if you continue along the lines of these Paris Accords the cost of the economy at this time would be close to three trillion dollars in lost GDP and six and a half million industrial jobs while households would have $7,000 less income and in many cases much worse than that okay and this is again true what he's saying is that basically the cost of energy production go up dramatically when you put heavy regulations on energy production and that means that people are going to have less money to spend on other things again true he continues along these lines and this is where when Trump said America first there were people who were saying okay if you were talking about this kind of stuff that I'm with him okay when he says America first what he what he should be meaning is that we can't allow other countries to go on doing exactly what they want with their industries and then unilaterally cut our own economy to no net effect he picks on China here and he's right to pick on China China is not going to make any serious emissions cuts all of the emissions cuts that China has talked about under the Paris Accord are things they are already doing there are things that are already occurring so for example in the United States in the last couple of years we've cut our carbon emissions by three percent that's not because of regulations that's because natural gas has replaced in many cases coal production and natural gas gives off less emissions than coal production it's because our cars are getting more efficient in other words free markets make more green energy than two government mandates government mandates just make people poor but China is going to be able to do what they want and we're supposed to regulate ourselves to no effect here is from saying that for example under the agreement China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years 13 they can do whatever they want for 13 years not us India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries there are many other examples but the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States I don't think that a lot of Americans who are going to disagree with that and he is correct that the reason the rest of the world is so intent on the United States picking up the burden is because they would like to see the United States taken down a peg on the global economic level he points that out and again the exactly correct from President Trump the rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris agreement they went wild they were so happy for the simple reason that it put our country the United States of America which we all love at a very very big economic disadvantage a cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and they wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound in fact ever then that's exactly right finally that the final point that he makes it's really an important one is that even if we were to comply by all of the resolutions that have been undertaken in the Paris Accord again non-binding resolutions undertaken in the Paris Accord it wouldn't really make much of a difference over the course of the century so here he is explaining using data from MIT that if people just did what they were talking about under the Paris Accord it wouldn't actually do anything but would hurt the economy pretty badly even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full with total compliance from all nations it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree think of that this much Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100 tiny tiny amount in fact 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America and this is incredible statistic would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030 after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars lost jobs closed factories and suffered at they right and this is Trump doing the right thing he drops a line in here that I think really sums up what his residency should be about what it what he's always said it was about he said I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris and that is totally fair that is a smart political line now the left has absolutely lost its mind over this and I want to talk in one second about that but first I want to talk about all of the reasons why what Trump did was right but before I even get to that first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over in doe Chino so the nicest suit that I currently own is a suit from indigene oh it's a tailored suit it's it's kind of a blue gray suit really beautiful suit and it's tailored to me the

sense to me in a in a beautiful box I take it out if it's perfectly it's great enzo Chino calm promo code Shapiro okay so a few more notes about the Paris Accord then I only got some left's insane reaction to this because it's totally over the top so number one the Accord was actually a tree but Obama never treated it that way so if Obama really thought this was super duper too very important super-dee-duper important then what he should have done is signed the Paris Accords with some pretty significant American restrictions on carbon emissions and then submitted it to the Senate and use his bully pulpit to get it approved remember treaties under the US Constitution must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate so if he thinks it's that important if the world is at stake if we're all going to dive it's going to be the day after tomorrow and Dennis Quaid is going to be hiding in the subway station while the waves pour through New York City then you would think you might be able to get two-thirds of senators to vote for this thing Obama couldn't even do that when he had 60 senators from the Democratic Party there so the idea that this is ever going to be a political winner for Democrats is really stupid also if you're going to do a treaty do a treaty a second there are some significant legal and implementation problems with the Paris Accord so Donald McGann is the White House Counsel he pointed out that theoretically you could have a court that would strike down the EPA's proposals to kill some of these anti coal regulations on the basis of the Paris Accords now legally should they be able to do that no the left says the courts wouldn't do that of course the left's also said 15 20 years ago that the courts wouldn't impose gay marriage from above and then they did that so whenever the left says the courts will not do this what they really mean is the courts won't do this tomorrow but in the next six months maybe third this would have had no impact like none okay the the statistic the Trump cites there where he says the global climate would be lowered by a grand total of 0.2 degrees celsius by 2100 if we kept by the Paris Accord that is 100% true mit is saying no no no no that that's that's only if people stop dividing by their obligations in 2030 Rabbid the Paris Accord only runs through 2030 so what is he supposed to assume that we're going to Ratchet it up after 2030 chemica sumption is about facts not in evidence for that lets other countries freeride Oren cast out a commentary magazine today China committed to begin reducing emissions by 2030 roughly 1 at economic development would have caused this to happen anyway India made no emissions commitment pledging only to make progress on efficiency at half the rate it had progressed in recent years Pakistan out did the rest submitting a single page that offered to quote reduce its emissions after reaching peak levels to the extent possible this is a definition of the word peak not a commitment in April report by Transport Environment found only three European countries pursuing policies in line with their parents can and one of these Germany has now seen two straight years of emissions increases the Philippines has outright renounced its commitment a study published by the American Geophysical Union warns that India's planned coal plant construction is incompatible with its own target and all of this is fine the only people who get ripped through the United States because of course we're the most powerful we're also supposed to fund like one-third of the entire commitment for all of the for all of the Paris Accord redistribution is put like three billion dollars and Obama and the left have been claiming for years that this is going to create jobs no evidence it's going to create jobs Paris Accord was basically meaningless now that said it is important to point out that you know the the Trump pulling out of it doesn't actually materially change much because the Paris Accords weren't going to be implemented in any case they're going to have the same shelf life as the Kyoto Protocol adopted by the Clinton administration in 1997 never passed by it never ratified by the Senate and basically DOA so it's a big symbolic move but symbolism matters when it comes to this stuff and that's it's the symbolism the left is going nuts over so the left has
