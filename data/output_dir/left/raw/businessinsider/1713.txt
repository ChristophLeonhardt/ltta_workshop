00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
I would have been much more aggressive

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,490
in her bio about how her life is always

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,590
challenging the status quo how she's

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,480
been a very kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change oriented</font>

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,820
person I hope that we can get more that

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,470
coming down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stretch I want people to</font>

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,150
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a woman I just</font>

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't accept things the way that they</font>

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,060
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also think that this is a very</font>

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique election in that if you think of</font>

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,630
the macro messaging it's very clear

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,488
Trump is saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can return to</font>

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,140
some time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had in America some</font>

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,680
magical year in 1968 58 I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">what that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that this</font>

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,969
country has lost and it's a different

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,070
country and we can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and recapture</font>

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,110
that well it is a different country and

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,309
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what would she say it is a</font>

20
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,250
little less glamorous but by smart

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,520
policy decisions that we can shape a

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,859
better future and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's very</font>

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,850
important I think there's a real macro

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,830
future versus past dynamic that really

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,460
underlies this election and I hope that

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:00:00,000
they hit that seam and that theme<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>
