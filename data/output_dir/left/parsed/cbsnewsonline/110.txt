-- 
>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
ITALY ARE HOLDING A JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
BOTH HAVE BEEN IN SUPPORT OF 
IMPROVING TIES WITH RUSSIA. 
>> IN YOUR ELECTION THE ITALIAN 
NATION HAS REAFFIRMED 
SOVEREIGNTY, LAW AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT STRETCHES 
ALL THE WAY BACK TO ANCIENT 
ROME. 
THIS PROUD HERITAGE SUSTAINS 
CIVILIZATION AND IT MUST BE 
ALWAYS DEFENDED. 
TODAY PRIME MINISTER CAN'T SAY 
AND I ARE PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE A 
NEW DIALOGUE BETWEEN ITALY AND 
THE UNITED STATES. 
THAT WILL ENHANCE COOPERATION 
ON A RANGE OF ISSUES. 
THIS INCLUDES JOINT SECURITY 
EFFORTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 
WHERE WE RECOGNIZE ITALY'S 
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE 
STABILIZATION OF LIBYA AND 
NORTH AFRICA. 
BOTH THE PRIME MINISTER AND I 
ARE FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO 
PROTECT OUR NATION'S FROM 
UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION. 
OUR COUNTRIES HAVE LEARNED THAT 
BORDER SECURITY IS NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND THEY ARE ONE IN 
THE SAME. 
LIKE THE UNITED STATES ITALY IS 
CURRENTLY UNDER ENORMOUS STRAIN 
AS A RESULT OF ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
THEY HAVE FOUGHT IT HARD. 
THE PRIME MINISTER IS WITH US 
TODAY BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
ITALY GOT TIRED OF IT. 
THEY DID NOT WANT IT ANY LONGER.
THE PEOPLE OF ITALY HAVE BORNE 
A GREAT PART OF THE BURDEN FOR 
EUROPE THROUGH THE COURSE OF 
THE MIGRATION CRISIS. 
I APPLAUD THE PRIME MINISTER 
FOR HIS BOLD LEADERSHIP, TRULY 
BOLD. 
I HOPE THAT MORE LEADERS WILL 
FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE INCLUDING 
LEADERS OF EUROPE. 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND I ARE 
UNITED IN OUR CONVICTION THAT 
STRONG NATIONS MUST HAVE A 
STRONG BORDERS. 
WE HAVE A SOLEMN OBLIGATION TO 
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS AND THEIR 
QUALITY OF LIFE. 
MY ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING 
HARD TO PASS BORDER SECURITY 
LEGISLATION, IMPROVE VETTING 
AND ESTABLISH A MERIT BASED 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH THE 
UNITED STATES NEEDS VERY BADLY. 
AS FAR AS THE BORDER IS 
CONCERNED AND PERSONALLY. 
IF WE DO NOT GET BORDER SECURITY
, AFTER MANY YEARS OF TALK 
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, I 
WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM DOING A 
SHUTDOWN. 
IT IS TIME WE HAVE PROPER 
BORDER SECURITY. 
WE ARE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF 
THE WORLD, WE HAVE THE WORST 
IMMIGRATION LAWS ANYWHERE IN 
THE WORLD. 
IN OUR MEETING TODAY THE PRIME 
MINISTER AND I DISCUSSED WAYS 
TO ENHANCE OUR COOPERATION IN 
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. 
THAT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH BORDER 
SECURITY. 
I WANT TO THANK THE ITALIAN 
PEOPLE FOR ITALY'S 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
COUNTERTERRORISM AND OPERATIONS 
IN THE COALITION TO DEFEAT ISIS 
WHERE WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS AND IN NATO'S RESOLUTE 
SUPPORT MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN. 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND I AGREE 
THAT THE BRUTAL REGIME IN IRAN 
MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO 
POSSESS A NUCLEAR WEAPON. 
NEVER. 
WE ENCOURAGE ALL NATIONS TO 
PRESSURE IRAN TO END THE FULL 
RANGE OF THE MALIGN ACTIVITIES. 
THE UNITED STATES WELCOMES THE 
PARTNERSHIP OF ITALY IN THESE 
VITAL EFFORTS. 
TODAY WE ARE ALSO ADDRESSING 
THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF TRADE AND 
COMMERCE. 
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR 
EUROPEAN PARTNERS INCLUDING 
ITALY TO ENSURE FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL TRADE. 
A FEW DAYS AGO I MET WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION. WE HAD A GREAT 
MEETING. 
FOLLOWING THAT MEETING WE 
ANNOUNCED A BREAKTHROUGH 
AGREEMENT TO INCREASE TRADE 
BARRIERS AND INCREASE UNITED 
STATES EXPORTS. 
OF AGRICULTURAL, ENERGY, AND 
OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE 
EUROPEAN UNION. NOW IS THE TIME 
TO EXPAND COMMERCE BETWEEN 
UNITED STATES AND ITALY. 
AMERICA'S BOOMING ECONOMY 
SETTING RECORDS IN SO MANY 
CATEGORIES. IT CREATES ENORMOUS 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT. 
LIKEWISE I RECOMMEND INVESTMENT 
IN ITALY. 
IT IS A GREAT PLACE WITH GREAT 
PEOPLE. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING 
CLOSELY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
TO OPEN UP NEW COMMERCIAL 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL REDUCE 
THE TRADE DEFICIT SUBSTANTIALLY 
AND INCREASE OUR MUTUAL 
PROSPERITY. 
MR. PRIME MINISTER, WE 
DISCUSSED THE SHARED GOAL OF 
COMBATING UNFAIR FOREIGN TRADE 
PRACTICES FROM NONMARKET 
ECONOMIES. 
THEY ARE BRUTAL. 
WE ARE WINNING. 
THESE ABUSES INCLUDE SUBSIDIES, 
EXCESS CAPACITY, INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY THEFT, FORCE 
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CURRENCY, 
DEVALUATION AND DISTORTION. 
CARS BY STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES.
IN THIS AREA LIKE SO MANY OTHERS
COOPERATION BETWEEN ITALY AND 
THE UNITED STATES CAN MAKE A 
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE, NOT ONLY 
FOR OUR COUNTRIES BUT ALL OVER 
THE WORLD AND IT IS MAKING A 
BIG DIFFERENCE. 
WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE, 
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE ON TRADE 
AND FAIRNESS. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE FAIR TO THE 
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
THE TAXPAYERS OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
MR. PRIME MINISTER, THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING ME FOR THESE 
IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS. 
WE ARE BOTH OUTSIDERS TO 
POLITICS. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
WE ARE OUTSIDERS. 
I LOOK AT THESE WONDERFUL 
POLITICIANS, AND WE ARE BOTH 
DETERMINED TO PROTECT THE 
RIGHTS, NEEDS, INTERESTS AND 
DREAMS OF OUR CITIZENS. 
I LOOK OVER TO PARTNERING WITH 
YOU TO BUILD ON THE INCREDIBLE 
FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN OUR 
COUNTRIES AND TO CREATING A 
BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR BOTH THE 
PEOPLE OF ITALY AND THE PEOPLE 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
IT IS MY GREAT HONOR. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. I WISH TO 
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 
THIS KIND INVITATION, ONLY TWO 
MONTHS AFTER THE FORMATION OF 
MY GOVERNMENT. 
I TAKE IT AS A SIGN OF SPECIAL 
ATTENTION TO ITALY AND TO ME AS 
WELL. 
FORGIVE ME, I DO NOT WANT TO 
RENOUNCE THE PRIVILEGE FOR 
SPEAKING IN MY WONDERFUL 
LANGUAGE. 
>> 
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY AND 
AFFECTIONATE HELLO TO ALL OF 
THE FRIENDS. OUR RELATIONSHIP 
IS A VERY LONG ONE. 
IT GOES WAY BACK. 
TODAY WE HAVE STRENGTHENED IT 
EVEN MORE AND I AM EXTREMELY 
HAPPY ABOUT THIS. 
WITH THIS VERY FRUITFUL 
ENCOUNTER HERE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE WE HAVE MADE ANOTHER STEP 
AHEAD. IN ORDER TO INTENSIFY 
OUR COOPERATION, OUR WORK 
TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MORE 
ADEQUATE, VIS-C-VIS THE 
GEOPOLITICAL ECONOMIC SITUATION 
IN THE WORLD. 
FROM JUNE 1 THERE IS ANOTHER 
ELEMENT THAT BRINGS US EVEN 
CLOSER, THE UNITED STATES AND 
ITALY, MY GOVERNMENT, AND THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ARE BOTH 
GOVERNMENTS THAT REPRESENT 
CHANGE. 
THEY WERE CHOSEN BY CITIZENS IN 
ORDER TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO 
AND TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE 
CONDITIONS. 
THERE IS SO MANY THINGS THAT 
BRING US TOGETHER, THAT UNIFY 
US IN ITALY AS IN THE UNITED 
STATES, WE ARE DOING WHAT WE 
HAD PROMISED DOING OUR 
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN AND WE ARE 
WORKING TO GET ANSWERS TO THE 
EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CITIZENS SO 
THAT WE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT 
THEM AND WE DO NOT BETRAY OUR 
MANDATE. 
IN THE ITALY AND THE UNITED 
STATES WE ARE PROVING THAT 
CHANGE IS POSSIBLE. 
DONALD AND I HAVE CONCENTRATED 
ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS. 
WE BOTH HAVE AGREED UPON AND 
REACHED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS 
WHICH IN PART WERE ALREADY 
MENTIONED TODAY. 
WE WILL HAVE MADE A GREAT STEP 
AHEAD. 
WE WILL START WORKING IN ITALY. 
IT IS A DIRECTORSHIP BOOST IN 
THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN ITALY 
AND THE UNITED STATES. 
I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE ALMOST 
TWIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH ITALY 
IS BECOMING A REFERENCE POINT IN
EUROPE AND A PRIVILEGE -- FOR 
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MAIN 
THREATS AND CHALLENGES THAT WE 
HAVE FOR US. 
TERRORISM AND FOR ALL THE 
CRISES THAT WE SEE IN THE 
MEDITERRANEAN AND IN PARTICULAR 
WITH REGARDS TO LIBYA. 
SECONDLY, THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT 
LIBERTY -- ITALY HAS A 
LEADERSHIP ROLE AS A PROMOTER 
COUNTRY THAT WILL LEAD TO THE 
STABILIZATION OF LIBYA. 
OF COURSE THIS IS WITH GREAT 
RESPECT TO THE LIBYAN POPULATION
WITH THE UNITED STATES WE WILL 
BE WORKING IN ORDER TO REACH 
THESE RESULTS. 
WE WILL DECIDE WHAT NEEDS TO BE 
DONE IN LIEU OF THIS RESULT. 
I AM TRULY THANKFUL TO YOU 
DONALD FOR YOUR SUPPORT. 
THIRDLY, IN TERMS OF 
IMMIGRATION. 
I ALSO DESCRIBED TWO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, THE INNOVATIVE APPROACH 
THAT ITALY HAS PUT FORTH AND 
THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW HAS A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT LEAVE THE 
WEIGHT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF 
IMMIGRATION ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
THE COUNTRIES OF FIRST ARRIVAL 
LIKE ITALY IS. 
AND AS YOU HEARD RESIDENT TRUMP 
SAY WE APPRECIATE THIS 
CONTRIBUTION WHICH IS PROVIDED 
BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH 
IS PROVIDING GOOD RESULTS. 
WE ARE TALKING A MULTILEVEL 
APPROACH IN ORDER TO TRY TO 
RESOLVE THE PHENOMENON OF 
IMMIGRATION. 
NOT BECAUSE OF AN EMERGENCY BUT 
BECAUSE OF A STRUCTURAL 
APPROACH. 
I WANT TO UNDERLINE THIS IS IN 
MIND WITH THE POSITION OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHICH GOES FROM 
THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY OF 
PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ARE 
PROTECTED AND MAKE SURE THAT 
RIGHTS ARE TRAMPLED OVER 
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE IN THE 
HANDS OF CRIMINAL --. 
I ALSO WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT 
THE WORLD DAY FOR THE EXCHANGE 
OF HUMAN BEINGS IS GOING TO BE 
CELEBRATED. 
I ALSO TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THAT I AM SATISFIED FOR THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS REACHED 
RECENTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES AND 
THE PRESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION. 
I BELIEVE THAT THIS 
UNDERSTANDING IS FUNDAMENTAL. 
WE HAVE TO WORK UPON IT 
IMMEDIATELY BRINGING OUR 
EFFORTS TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE 
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN, ITALIAN 
CITIZENS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS 
OF A MORE EQUITABLE TRADE 
RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS 
COMPLETELY RECIPROCAL. 
ONCE AGAIN, AS FAR AS RUSSIA IS 
CONCERNED, ITALY IS FAVORABLE 
TO A DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA. 
ITALY ALSO CONSIDERS THE 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND RUSSIA IS FUNDAMENTAL
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE POSITIVE 
RESULTS IN A MORE GLOBAL 
PERSPECTIVE FOR STABILITY AND 
SECURITY PURPOSES. 
IN TERMS OF ENERGY SECURITY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I ALSO 
FOUND OURSELVES IN AGREEMENT 
WITH THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THERE IS A GREATER 
DIVERSIFICATION FOR THE SOURCES 
OF ENERGY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THE ENERGY ROOTS ARE 
DIVERSIFIED AS WELL. 
FINALLY I AM SURE THAT WE CAN 
INCREASE AND IMPROVE THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AT ALL LEVELS AND IN 
PARTICULAR THE SPACE AND 
AEROSPACE FIELDS. 
WE ALREADY HAVE A GREAT 
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ITALIAN 
SPACE AGENCY AND NASA. 
WE HOPE THAT AEROSPACE WILL 
BRING TOGETHER AMERICAN 
TECHNOLOGY, ITALIAN TECHNOLOGY 
SO THAT WE CAN LAUNCH NEW 
AIRCRAFT THAT CROSS THE 
ATMOSPHERE AND WILL BE ABLE TO 
BRING THE UNITED STATES AND 
ITALY TOGETHER. 
THIS IS A PROJECT THAT I WOULD 
LIKE TO SPEAK IN DETAIL WITH 
THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. 
>>THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT YOU ARE 
SAYING ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN, ARE 
YOU WILLING TO SHUT THE 
GOVERNMENT DOWN IN SEPTEMBER IF 
IT DOES NOT FULLY FUND $25 
BILLION WORTH OF YOUR BORDER 
WALL AND ALSO DELIVER THE 
IMMIGRATION PRIORITIES THAT YOU 
LISTED IN YOUR TWEET? 
OR ARE YOU LEAVING SOME ROOM 
FOR NEGOTIATION? 
>>I ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR 
NEGOTIATION. 
THIS HAS BEEN MANY YEARS NOT 
JUST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
THIS HAS BEEN MANY YEARS AND 
EVEN DECADES, WE HAVE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS, WE HAVE 
BORDER SECURITY, ALL SORTS OF 
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON. 
WE ARE DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB 
RESCINDING RECORDS BUT WE ARE 
WORKING AROUND THE LAWS. 
I HAVE TO TAKE MY HAT OFF TO 
THE BORDER PATROL, TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, TO ICE WHICH HAS 
BEEN MALIGNED BY THE DEMOCRATS. 
THEY GO INTO THESE MS 13 NESTS. 
NEST OF BAD PEOPLE, KILLERS IN 
MANY PLACES THEY ARE FEARLESS 
AND THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
THEY EITHER GO TO JAIL OR THEY 
GET THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 
I WANT TO TIP MY HAT TO ICE AND 
THOSE BRAVE PEOPLE. 
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY. 
WITHOUT A BORDER AS THIS 
GENTLEMAN CAN TELL YOU ALSO, 
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS A BIG 
FACTOR IN HIS WIN IN ITALY. 
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY. 
THAT INCLUDES THE WALL. 
WE HAVE TO TO END THE LOTTERY. 
WE HAVE TO END THE CHAIN. 
THE CHAIN IS A DISASTER. 
YOU BRING ONE PERSON IN AND YOU 
END UP WITH 32 PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE TO END THESE HORRIBLE 
CATCH AND RELEASE PRINCIPLES 
WERE YOU CATCH SOMEBODY, YOU 
TAKE THEIR NAME AND YOU RELEASE 
THEM. 
THEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO COME 
BACK TO A COURT CASE WHERE THEY 
WANT US TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF 
JUDGES. 
THE WHOLE THING IS RIDICULOUS. 
WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR LAWS. 
I WOULD BE WILLING TO CLOSE IT 
DOWN TO GET IT DONE. 
WE ARE APPROVING THINGS IN 
VARIOUS OF BILLS. 
INCLUDING THE MILITARY. 
WE ALWAYS PUT THE MILITARY AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT VERY HIGH. 
I AM WILLING TO CONSIDER A 
SHUTDOWN IF WE DO NOT GET 
PROPER BORDER SECURITY. 
>> IS THE $25 BILLION THE 
REDLINE FOR YOU? 
>>I HAVE NO REDLINE UNLIKE 
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
I JUST WANT BETTER BORDER 
SECURITY. 
>> MR. PRIME MINISTER, HERE IN 
THE UNITED STATES THERE WAS A 
CONSENSUS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
APPEARANCE AT THE G7 AND NATO 
DAMAGED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THOSE INSTITUTIONS. 
AS A MEMBER OF BOTH OF THOSE 
INSTITUTIONS WHAT IS YOUR 
OPINION ON THE PRESIDENT 
APPEARANCE AT BOTH? 
>> BOTH AT THE G7 AND AT NATO, 
WE HAD A VERY FRUITFUL EXCHANGE 
OF VIEWS AND OPINIONS AND 
POSITIONS. 
I THINK THAT ALL THE POSITIONS 
AND STANCES THAT ARE EXPRESSED 
WITH CLARITY AND PROVIDE -- TO 
VIEW WELL-ESTABLISHED POSITIONS 
ARE WELCOME. 
THERE WAS A FRUITFUL EXCHANGE 
BOTH AT THE G7 SUMMIT AND AT 
THE NATO SUMMIT IN DIFFERENT 
FRAMEWORKS. 
WE FOR INSTANCE IN THE 
FRAMEWORK OF THE G7 SUMMIT, WE 
AGREED ON THE NEED FOR REFORMING
THE SYSTEM. 
IT IS A YEAR OLD SYSTEM WHICH 
CONSIDER CHINA AS AN EMERGING 
COUNTRY. 
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND 
APPLYING THE SAME RULES WITH 
YEARS AND PRIVILEGES GRANTED TO 
THE COUNTRY CLEARLY MEANS THAT 
HAVING A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT 
WELL-FUNCTIONING AND NOT WELL 
RATIONAL. 
-- WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP I 
PERSONALLY SHARE FAIRLY, HE 
EXPRESSED A POSITION AND A NEED 
TO REBALANCE THE EXPENDITURE 
WHICH IS BORN -- IN THE UNITED 
STATES WHICH IS RARELY 
DISPROPORTIONATE. 
THESE ARE REASONABLE POSITIONS 
AND STANCES AND I PERSONALLY 
THINK THAT'S MY TAKE THAT INTO 
ACCOUNT AND I WILL BE THE 
CARRIER OF THE MESSAGE TO TRY 
TO MAKE THE OTHERS UNDERSTAND 
THESE POSITIONS. 
WE MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE 
UNITED STATES TO FIND THE 
BALANCE IN THE INTEREST OF 
ITALIAN CITIZENS, AMERICAN 
CITIZENS AND EUROPEAN CITIZENS. 
>>I ALSO WANT TO ADD TO THAT, I 
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU 
SAID, IT HAS BEEN VERY UNFAIR 
IN UNITED STATES. 
WE HAD A VERY GOOD G7 MEETING, 
THAT IS WHERE WE BECAME 
FRIENDS. 
I THINK WE WERE MORE CLOSELY 
ALIGNED THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN 
THE ROOM. 
IT WAS A GREAT MEETING IN EVERY 
RESPECT. 
NTO, IN PARTICULAR. 
I WENT TO NATO, NATO WAS 
ESSENTIALLY GOING OUT OF 
BUSINESS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE 
NOT PAYING AND IT WAS GOING 
DOWN. 
I CAME ALONG LAST YEAR AND IN A 
FAIRLY NICE TONE I SAID YOU 
HAVE GOT TO PAY. 
THEY PAID $44 BILLION MORE. 
THIS YEAR I SAID IT IN A 
STRONGER TONE AND THEY ARE 
PAYING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS MORE. 
NATO WILL BE STRONG AGAIN. 
IF YOU SPEAK TO THE SECRETARY 
GENERAL, I THINK HE IS THE 
BIGGEST FAN OF TRUMP. 
HE SAID WE COULD NOT COLLECT 
MONEY UNTIL PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CAME ALONG. 
HE SAID LAST YEAR WE COLLECTED 
$44 BILLION. THIS YEAR THE 
MONEY IS POURING IN. 
IT IS LIKE THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAID, TALK ABOUT IMBALANCE, WE 
WERE TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY. 
UNITED STATES WAS TREATED VERY 
UNFAIRLY BECAUSE WE ARE 
SHOULDERING ANYWHERE FROM 80 TO 
90 PERCENT OF THE COST OF NATO. 
THAT IS NOT FAIR. 
WHEN YOU TAKE GERMANY, THEY ARE 
PAYING A LITTLE MORE THAN 1 
PERCENT AND THEY ARE BUYING AND 
PAYING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS TO 
RUSSIA. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO 
PROTECT COUNTRIES FROM RUSSIA, 
BUT THEY ARE PAYING RUSSIA 
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
FOR THE ENERGY. 
NOT A GOOD SITUATION. 
I LET IT BE KNOWN. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE NATO 
COUNTRIES ARE PAYING A LOT MORE 
MONEY AND IT HAS BECOME A LOT 
STRONGER BECAUSE OF IT. 
>>MY I ADD SOMETHING? AS A 
PERSON WHO HAS -- AND AS A 
LAWYER, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT 
WHO IS A STRONG SUPPORTER AND 
ADVOCATE ARE IN THE INTEREST OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE 
AMERICAN COUNTRY. 
HE IS A GREAT NEGOTIATOR. 
I AM TOLD THAT THERE IS A GROUP 
THAT WANTS TO ASK A QUESTION. 
>> -- THE ITALIAN ECONOMY 
PERFORMS -- UNDERPERFORMS 
REGULARLY. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD 
REIGNITE THE ITALIAN ECONOMY 
AND WHAT ROLE DO YOU THINK THE 
EU SHOULD PLAY IN IT AND 
PRESIDENT CONTE DO YOU THINK 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S IDEA WOULD 
WORK IN ITALY? 
>> I BELIEVE THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS GOING TO DO A TREMENDOUS JOB 
ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. 
IN ADDITION TO BORDERS. 
FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT YOU 
NEED BORDERS ALSO. 
YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS GOING TO 
DO A TERRIFIC JOB. 
HE KNOWS HOW TO SELL AND HE 
KNOWS HOW TO PROMOTE A GREAT 
PRODUCT. 
I WILL NOT MENTION THEIR NAMES 
BUT THEY ARE GREAT. 
ITALY MAKES A GREAT PRODUCT AND 
I THINK IT WILL DO WELL 
ECONOMICALLY AND WE ARE THERE 
TO HELP. 
WE HAVE HAD RECORD NUMBERS. 
I HAVE BEEN MORE -- HERE FOR A 
LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AND A 
HALF AND WE HAVE HAD RECORD 
NUMBERS. 
WE HAVE NUMBERS THAT NOBODY 
BELIEVES POSSIBLE. 
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT ONE 
PARTICULAR FACT THAT WAS NOT 
REPORTED MUCH, THE TRADE DEFICIT
$52 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE 
TRADE DEFICIT FOR THE QUARTER. 
I THINK STEVEN MNUCHIN AND MIKE 
POMPEO NOT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN POSSIBLE. 
>> I THINK THAT ITALY WILL DO 
THE SAME THING. 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NUMBERS BUT 
THE SAME THING. 
>>WHAT ROLE WILL THE EUROPEAN 
UNION PLAY IN THE MATTER? 
DO YOU THINK THE EUROPEAN UNION 
SHOULD PLAY? 
>> THAT IS UP TO THEM. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION, JEAN-CLAUDE 
AND I HAD A FANTASTIC MEETING, 
WE WERE HAVING A HARD TIME AND 
AND I MENTIONED TARIFFS ON 
CARS. 
WE GOT ALONG REALLY WELL. 
I THINK THEY WILL TREAT US 
FAIRLY. 
WE WILL TREAT THEM FAIRLY. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TOTALLY 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. 
BY THE WAY, ITALY HAS A $31 
BILLION SURPLUS WITH THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WE HAVE A $31 BILLION TRADE 
DEFICIT WITH ITALY AND WE 
DISCUSSED THAT. 
WE WILL WORK SOMETHING OUT. 
>> I AM VERY ENVIOUS OF THE 
RECORDS AND THE GROWTH FIGURES 
OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. 
WE DISCUSSED THAT BEFORE WITH 
DONALD, THESE ARE SYSTEMS THAT 
CANNOT BE COMPARED BECAUSE THEY 
ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SO THAT 
ARE DIFFERENT. 
AT THE SAME TIME I AM ENVIOUS 
AND AMBITIOUS AT THE SAME TIME. 
AS A GOVERNMENT LEADER I AM 
AMBITIOUS FOR MY ECONOMY TO DO 
MUCH MORE THAN WHAT WAS DONE IN 
THE PAST. 
WE ARE PREPARING FORMS WHICH WE 
WILL BE SUBMITTING TO THE 
EUROPEAN PARTNERS. I DO NOT 
WANT THE TAX REFORM TO BE SET 
ASIDE. 
IT WAS A LEVERAGE IN THIS 
COUNTRY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 
-- IF WELL CONSTRUCTED IT 
REPRESENTS A LEVERAGE FOR 
ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT ALSO 
WORKING DOWN ON STREAMLINING AND
FINDING REDTAPE ADMINISTRATION. 
WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE 
CORRUPTION POCKETS. 
WE ARE TRYING TO SPEED UP CIVIL 
TRIALS, PROCEDURES THAT ALL 
SECTORS TOGETHER WITH THE 
CITIZEN INCOME THAT WILL SUPPORT
-- THESE ARE ALL OF THE REFORMS 
THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE A 
POSITIVE ELEMENT -- OF LEVERAGE 
IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE CAN TRY 
TO REACH THE GROWTH. 
>>I DO THINK THIS, ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE 
DONE, OBVIOUSLY TAX CUTS, BUT 
IT WOULD ALSO BE CUTS IN 
REGULATION. 
I KNOW ITALY WELL AND THEY HAVE 
A LOTS OF REGULATION. 
I KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
WILL WORK HARD ON THAT. 
I THINK FROM OUR STANDPOINT ONE 
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 
THAT WE DID IS CUTTING 
MASSIVELY THESE HORRIBLE 
REGULATIONS. 
I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT, I WANT THE 
CLEANEST AIR, CLEANEST WATER, 
CLEANEST EVERYTHING. 
YOU HAVE 10 REGULATIONS FOR 
EVERY POINT, IT WAS RIDICULOUS. 
IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO GET 
A HIGHWAY OR A ROAD APPROVE. 
WE HAVE THE WEIGHT DOWN IT IS 
DOWN TO TWO YEARS AND HOPEFULLY 
IT WILL GET DOWN TO ONE. 
IT MAY GET REJECTED BUT AT 
LEAST IT WILL GO QUICKLY. 
WE WANT REGULATION BUT IT HAS 
TO BE CUT TO A MINIMUM. 
I THINK THAT ITALY WILL FOLLOW 
SUIT. 
I KNOW THEY HAVE LOOKED AT IT 
STRONGLY. 
THANK YOU. 
>>THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
YOU SPOKE A BIT ABOUT IRAN TODAY
AND I AM WONDERING IF YOU CAN 
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK IRAN 
NEEDS TO DO TO REDUCE TENSION. 
YOU HAVE MET WITH THE LEADERS 
OF NORTH KOREA AND RUSSIA. 
ARE YOU PREPARED AND WILLING TO 
MEET WITH PRESIDENT -- AND 
UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. 
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY PULMONARY 
DISCUSSIONS WITH SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT? 
>> THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY CAN SAY IT. 
SPEAKING TO OTHER PEOPLE 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT POTENTIAL OF WAR AND 
DEATH AND FAMINE AND LOTS OF 
OTHER THINGS, THERE IS NOTHING 
WRONG WITH MEETING. 
WE MET WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A MISSILE 
FIRED OFF IN NINE MONTHS. 
WE GOT OUR PRISONERS BACK. 
SO MANY THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE 
POSITIVE. 
I HAD A GREAT MEETING, THE FAKE 
NEWS DID NOT COVER IT THAT WAY, 
I HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA IN 
TERMS OF THE FUTURE AND IN 
TERMS OF SAFETY AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTING 
ISRAEL AND PROTECTING 
EVERYBODY. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT 
MEETING. 
GREAT MEETING WITH NATO, I JUST 
EXPLAINED THAT. 
HUNDREDS AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS MORE MONEY WILL BE PAID 
TO NATO. 
I BELIEVE IN MEETING. 
I WOULD CERTAINLY MEET WITH 
IRAN IF THEY WANT TO MEET. 
I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE READY.
THEY ARE HAVING A HARD TIME. 
I ENDED THE IRAN DEAL. 
IT WAS A RIDICULOUS DEAL. 
I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL 
WANT TO MEET AND I AM READY TO 
MEET ANYTIME THEY WANT TO. 
I DO NOT DO THAT FROM STRENGTH 
OR WEAKNESS, IT IS AN 
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. 
IF WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT 
THAT IS MEANINGFUL, NOT THE 
WASTE OF PAPER THAT THE OTHER 
DEAL WAS I WOULD BE WILLING TO 
MEET. 
>>YOU HAVE PRECONDITIONS? 
>> NO. 
THEY WANT TO MEET I'LL MEET, 
ANY TIME THEY WANT. 
IT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, 
GOOD FOR THEM, GOOD FOR US AND 
GOOD FOR THE WORLD. 
IF THEY WANT TO MEET I WILL 
MEET? 
>> I WANT TO ASK IF YOU AND THE 
PRESIDENT, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 
NEED TO STABILIZE LIBYA. 
I WANT TO ASK IF YOU AND THE 
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED WORKING 
TOGETHER ON ENERGY PRODUCTION 
IN LIBYA IN SOME WAY. 
DID YOU DISCUSS OIL PRODUCTION 
IN LIBYA, DID YOU SEE A WAY FOR 
THE UNITED STATES TO BECOME 
INVOLVED WITH ITALY'S HELP? 
>> WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM OF 
STABILIZING LIBYA AND THE 
SECURITY TO BE GUARANTEED FOR 
THE IRANIAN AREA. 
IT IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM OF THE 
MIGRATION ROUTES FROM AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES CONCENTRATE IN THE 
LIBYAN AREA, IT IS ALSO A 
PROBLEM WITH SECURITY IN 
GENERAL. 
-- FOREIGN FIGHTERS MIGHT REACH 
THE EUROPEAN TERRITORY. 
AGENTS WHO COULD CARRY THE 
THREAT. 
WE DID NOT DISCUSS IN DETAILS 
THE PROBLEMS. 
CERTAINLY IT IS OUR INTENTION 
TO RESPECT THE LIBYAN 
POPULATION. 
WE ARE NOT TREATED BY THE 
ECONOMIC INTEREST OR ECONOMIC 
SUPPLY. 
OUR INTEREST AND OF THIS POINT 
OF VIEW WE ARE GOING TO 
ORGANIZE AN AGREEMENT WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE ARE GOING 
TO ORGANIZE A CONFERENCE WITH 
LIBYA. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO DEAL AND 
DISCUSS ALL OF THE ISSUES 
RELATED TO THE LIBYAN PEOPLE 
INVOLVING ALL OF THE 
STAKEHOLDERS, ACTORS, 
PROTAGONISTS AND -- WE ARE 
GOING TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC 
ASPECTS AND SOCIAL ASPECTS. 
THE PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS. 
THE PROBLEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
PROCESS OF ISSUING AND PASSING 
LAWS TO ENABLE LIBYA IN 
PARTICULAR TO GET DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTIONS AND CONDITION OF THE 
UPMOST ABILITY. 
-- STABILITY. 
I AM TOLD THAT -- WANTS TO ASK 
A QUESTION. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I HAVE A QUESTION TO BY 
MINISTER CONTE AND THEN PRIME 
MINISTER MAY -- PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
THERE ARE THREE ISSUES ON THE 
TABLE WITH THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION ONE IS SANCTIONS 
TO RUSSIA. SINCE ITALY THE TWO 
MAIN GOVERNMENT PARTIES IN 
ITALY SAID THEY WANTED TO LIFT 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, WHAT IS 
THE OFFICIAL POSITION BY THE 
GOVERNMENT SINCE THE AMERICAN 
-- IS ASKING FOR SANCTIONS TO 
BE KEPT -- GUYS PAP -- GAS 
PIPELINE THAT THE AMERICAN 
DEPARTMENT HAS TO CONTINUE WITH 
THE WORK AND WHY THERE ARE SOME 
ISSUES IN ITALY WITH THIS 
PROJECT AND THE F 35 PROGRAM, 
WHAT IS ITALY GOING TO DO? WILL 
ITALY CONFIRM THE PROGRAM? 
THANK YOU. 
>> I AM GOING TO ANSWER IN 
RELATION TO SANCTIONS ON 
RUSSIA. 
I AM GOING TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID
BEFORE BECAUSE I HAVE TAKEN A 
STANCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
SUMMITS. 
I WILL BE BORING, THIS CONFIRMS 
THAT THE POSITION OF THE 
GOVERNMENT IS NOT CHANGING IN 
THIS RESPECT. 
WE ARE OPEN TO DIALOGUE WITH 
RUSSIA. 
WE DO BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA PLAYS 
A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN ALL 
INTERNATIONAL, GEOPOLITICAL 
PRIZES. 
INKING THAT RUSSIA CAN BE KEPT 
OUT OF THE DIALOGUE ESPECIALLY 
IN --, IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE 
PROBLEMS WE CANNOT CHOOSE THE 
COUNTERPARTS TO DEAL WITH. 
WE MUST ACCEPT A SEAT AT THE 
TABLE AND NEGOTIATE WITH THOSE 
WHO --. AS FAR AS THE SANCTION 
AS SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED WE 
ARE AWARE THAT THE SYSTEM STEMS 
FROM THE MINSK AGREEMENT AND -- 
IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS 
UNTHINKABLE TODAY TO LIFT 
OVERNIGHT THOUGH SANCTIONS. 
HOWEVER, EXACTLY BECAUSE WE ARE 
OPEN TO DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA 
THE POSITION HAS BEEN STATED IS 
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM 
DOES NOT AFFECT THE CIVIC 
SOCIETY AND DOESN'T AFFECT THE 
ECONOMY OF THE SMALL 
ENTERPRISES IN RUSSIA. 
ITALY HAS A INTENSE ECONOMIC 
RELATION WITH RUSSIA IN THIS 
RESPECT. 
IN ORDER TO STRESS ONCE AGAIN 
WITH A FINAL STATEMENT, 
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ARE 
NOT AND CANNOT REPRESENT AN END
. SECOND ISSUE, -- PIPELINE. 
I DISCUSSED THIS WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
I REPORTED TO HIM THAT MY 
GOVERNMENT IS WELL AWARE OF THE 
FACT THAT THIS IS STRATEGIC 
WORK IN TERMS OF ENERGY SUPPLY 
TO ITALY AND TO THE SOUTH OF 
EUROPE. WE ARE PERFECTLY AWARE 
OF THE FACT THAT THIS CAN 
PROVIDE A CONTRIBUTION ALSO IN 
THE RENEWAL OF THE ENERGY 
SYSTEM AND THE ELIMINATION OF 
COAL WHICH IS PART OF THE 
PROGRAM. AT THE SAME TIME I 
INFORMED PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT 
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY BY LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES ON WHERE THE 
PIPELINE WILL LAND -- NEEDS TO 
BE PHASED PROPERLY ONCE BACK TO 
ITALY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I 
WILL DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH THE 
MINISTERS AND I WILL GO MEET 
THE LOCAL MAYORS, THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES AND TRY TO FIND A 
SOLUTION WHICH WILL TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT THE CONCERNS OF LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES. AS FAR AS THE 
THIRD POINT IS CONCERNED, -- IS 
A PROGRAM THAT WAS DECIDED IN 
2002 THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS 
SIGNED. 
IT IS A BIG PERIOD OF TIME IN 
TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT NEEDS 
FOR DEFENSE AND SECURITY. AS A 
GOVERNMENT WE ARE RESPONSIBLY 
EVALUATING --. 
AS YOU KNOW IT IS A PROCESS OF 
ORDERS BEING ISSUED WHICH HAS 
TAKEN PLACE AND THESE ORDERS ARE
ISSUED MUCH EARLIER BECAUSE 
DESMOND. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS 
AND WE WILL MAKE ALL OF THE 
NECESSARY CHOICES IN A CAUTIOUS 
WAY IN VIEW OF THE NEEDS OF 
DEFENSE AND SECURITY BEING 
TRANSPARENT WITH OUR PARTNERS, 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
>>THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA WILL REMAIN 
AS IS. 
AS FAR AS A PIPELINE IS 
CONCERNED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
COMPETING PIPELINES. 
MR. PRIME MINISTER I HOPE YOU 
CAN DO THAT COMPETING PIPELINE. 
WE ARE ALREADY TALKING TO THE 
EUROPEAN UNION ABOUT BUILDING 
ANYWHERE FROM 9-11 PORTS, WHICH 
THEY WILL PAY FOR, SO THAT WE 
CAN SHIP -- OVER TO VARIOUS 
PARTS OF EUROPE. 
THAT WILL BE MORE COMPETITION. 
THE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA WILL 
REMAIN AS IS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU.
>>YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING A NEWS 
CONFERENCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER
GIUSEPPE CONTE. THE PRESIDENT 
SAID HE WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM 
WITH A POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT 
SHUTDOWN SAYING IT IS TIME TO 
HAVE BORDER SECURITY. 
HE AND THE PRIME MINISTER 
SHARED SENTIMENT ABOUT RUSSIA. 
THEY ALSO AGREED TO WORK ON 
TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U. 
S. AND ITALY. 
WE HAVE STANDING BY WITH US, 
MAJOR GARRETT. THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR JOINING US. 
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING HEARING 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF ITALY. THEY SEEM TO 
REGARD ONE ANOTHER AS CLOSE 
ALLIES WHEN IT COMES TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BEST FRIEND 
IN THE EU. 
AT ONE POINT PRIME MINISTER 
CONTE SAID THAT WE ARE ALMOST 
TWIN COUNTRIES. 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP? 
>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT 
PRIME MINISTER CONTE TALKED 
ABOUT -- BEING A REFERENCE 
POINT FOR YOUR. 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF 
TRENDS FIRST STARTED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AND OUTSIDERS SEEKING HIGH 
ELECTED OFFICE AND PURSUING A 
POLICY ECONOMICALLY AND ON 
BORDER SECURITY THAT CAN BE 
DESCRIBED AS A COMBINATION OF 
POPULISM AND NATIONALISM. 
PRIME MINISTER CONTE DID THAT. 
HE LEADS A COALITION GOVERNMENT 
THAT EMPHASIZED SOME OF THOSE 
ISSUES AND SITS ATOP THE 
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WITH A 
PERSPECTIVE NOT UNLIKE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON ECONOMIC 
NATIONALISM AND BORDER SECURITY.
AS DEFINED FROM A POPULOUS 
PERSPECTIVE OR A NATIONALIST 
PERSPECTIVE. 
THEY ARE IN CERTAIN WAYS 
ALIGNED IDEOLOGICALLY. 
IF I HAD BEEN GIVEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY I WOULD HAVE ASKED 
BY MINISTER CONTE TO DESCRIBE 
THE TRUMP EFFECT THROUGHOT 
YOUR. 
IF HE DESCRIBED ITALY AS A 
REFERENCE POINT FOR EUROPE THIS 
HE BELIEVED THIS IS A TREND 
THAT WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 
EUROPE? 
OR IS ITALY MORE OR LESS AN 
EXPERIMENT, BUT A DEFINED ONE 
NATION EXPERIMENT WITH THESE 
NOTIONS OF INTEGRATED POPULISM
AND NATIONALISM INTO THE 
EUROPEAN CONVERSATION. 
I DID NOT GET THAT CHANCE. 
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ENLIGHTENED 
BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S ANSWER. 
>> WE WISH YOU WERE ABLE TO 
ASKED THAT QUESTION. 
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS WORTH 
POINTING OUT ABOUT THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
TWO THINGS THAT WE NEED TO LOCK 
IN ON. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS OPEN 
TO TALKS WITH IRAN AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVELS WITH NO 
PRECONDITIONS. 
I DON'T THINK AND NO ONE IN 
THIS ROOM BELIEVES THAT WILL 
HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON. 
THAT IS A MEANS BY WHICH THE 
PRESIDENT IS SAYING HE WILL 
TALK TO ANYBODY UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN THE HEAD OF 
THE IRANIAN REGIME OVER THIS 
ISSUE OF THEIR PURSUIT OF 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN SUPPORT OF 
TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE 
EAST AND ON THE SHUTDOWN 
SCENARIO, THE PRESIDENT GAVE 
HIMSELF A LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM 
ABOUT THE SPECIFICS. HOW MUCH 
MONEY, WHAT HE WOULD NEED TO 
SEE LEGISLATIVELY. 
MAKE NO MISTAKE THE PRESIDENT 
WAS TRYING TO SEND A SIGNAL TO 
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS. 
HE IS NOT BLUFFING ON THE 
SHUTDOWN AND HE MAY TRY TO USE 
THAT AS A POLITICAL WEDGE ISSUE 
IN THE HEAT OF THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS EVEN IF MANY 
REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING THOSE AT 
THE TOP OF THE LEADERSHIP IN 
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE ARE 
UNENTHUSIASTIC TO PUT IT MILDLY 
ABOUT THAT STRATEGY. 
>> HE DID SAY WHEN PRESSED ON 
THAT POINT BY A REPORTER THAT 
HE HAS NO REDLINE AND THAT 
THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR 
NEGOTIATION. 
THAT IS SORT OF AN OPENING IN 
THE DOOR TO CONGRESS. 
>> CERTAINLY EVERYTHING IS OPEN 
TO NEGOTIATION FOR ANY 
PRESIDENT DEALING WITH CONGRESS.
THE QUESTION OF A SHUTDOWN 
LOOMS LARGE OVER REPUBLICANS. 
SHUTDOWN POLITICS TYPICALLY 
REBOUND TO THE PARTY IN POWER. 
YOU CANNOT MANAGE GOVERNMENT 
AND BE AN EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE 
BODY, REPUBLICANS HAVE TOLD THE 
COUNTRY THROUGHOUT AND THEY 
WILL SAY THIS DURING THE 
ELECTIONS, KEEP REPUBLICANS IN 
CONTROL WE KNOW HOW TO MANAGE 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
IF YOU ARE SHUTTING THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT DOWN AS YOU ARE 
EXCITING YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE 
IT, THAT IS A MIXED MESSAGE. 
ONE THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD 
PREFER TO AVOID IN A MIDTERM 
ELECTION WHEN DEMOCRATS WILL 
SAY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU 
NEED TO ELECT DEMOCRATS IS SO 
THAT THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT 
MANAGEMET OF THE CONGRESS AND 
MORE CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT IS BETTING THE 
IMMIGRATION ISSUE WILL WORK FOR 
HIM NATIONALLY. 
MANY REPUBLICANS THAT I TALK TO 
THINK IT WORKS IN CERTAIN 
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN CERTAIN 
AUDIENCES BUT IT IS NOT A 
ROBUST MOTIVATING ISSUE FOR 
REPUBLICANS GENERALLY IN A WAY 
THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR 
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS IN ALL 
50 STATES. 
>>SHOULDN'T THAT WORRY THE 
PRESIDENT FROM A STRATEGIC 
STANDPOINT? 
LET'S SAY IT RALLIES HIS BASE, 
IF IT DOES MAKE REPUBLICANS 
VULNERABLE IN THEIR HOME 
CONSTITUENTS, DOESN'T THAT MEAN 
HE COULD RISK LOSING SEEDS TO 
DEMOCRATS WHICH IN TURN MAKES 
HIS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA MORE 
DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH? 
>> CERTAINLY. 
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE 
DEFINITE RISK FACTORS. 
YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THEM 
PRECISELY. 
THIS IS A LEARNING LESSON FOR 
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS POLITICAL 
TEAM WHICH REALLY STARTS AND 
ENDS WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF 
AND HIS OWN POLITICAL 
INSTINCTS. 
HE HAD AN INSTINCT IN THE 2016 
CAMPAIGN, A HARD EDGE MESSAGE 
THAT HE NEVER FLINCHED FROM OR 
BACKED AWAY FROM, IT COULD 
PROVE NATIONALLY EFFECTIVE. 
HE WAS RIGHT. 
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTION IS THAT THE 
CONVERSATION IS MUCH NARROWER. 
YOU CAN'T DISTRIBUTE TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS IN THE VARIOUS 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS THAT 
ARE UP FOR GRABS. 
MANY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE THE MOST 
COMPETITIVE HAVE FEWER HARD-
CORE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AS THEY 
DO NON-ATTACHED REPUBLICANS OR 
FIERCELY MOTIVATED DEMOCRATS OR 
INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE HAVING A 
SECOND LOOK OR SOME DEGREE OF 
BUYERS REMORSE SIDING WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. THOSE ARE 
THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO FLUSH 
THEMSELVES OUT IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS GOING TO REPLACE HIS 2016 
STRATEGY. 
THAT IS A NATIONAL ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE STRATEGY IN A MIDTERM 
ELECTION. 
THE VOTES ARE COUNTED AND THE 
RESULTS ARE MUCH MORE NARROWLY 
DRAWN. 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT I 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, SENATE 
RACE BY SENATE RACE. 
THIS IS A BIG RISK. 
>> BEFORE I LET YOU GO I WANT 
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ON TRADE. 
DO WE HAVE DETAILS ON EXACTLY 
WHAT PRIME MINISTER CONTE AND 
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AGREED 
UPON IN REGARDS TO TRADE? 
>> NOTHING THAT I HAVE SEEN 
THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED BY THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
A LOT OF AGREEABLE WORDS ABOUT 
COMBINING FORCES, WORKING ON 
ENERGY, SHARING THE SAME 
APPROACH TO UNDERLYING ISSUES 
AND THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING 
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS A GOOD 
NEGOTIATOR REFERRING BACK TO 
THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT REACHED LAST WEEK 
WITH THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMISSION ABOUT HAVING MORE 
TALKS AND AVOID A FULL ON TRADE 
WAR WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
THAT CREATES AN OPENING AND IT 
CREATES SPACE TO TAKE HEAT OFF 
OF THE ISSUE. 
THE NEGOTIATING STILL GOES ON. 
THE END RESULT IS STILL 
UNCLEAR. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT, IN 
WASHINGTON. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
MORE NEWS AHEAD.
