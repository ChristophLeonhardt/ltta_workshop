1
00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:02,180
I would have never imagined
that Aleppo would be

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,560
described as a wounded place.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,900
Living this now,
you actually see

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,150
the wounds happen in real life.

5
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:15,080
And I think for me, that’s
one of the most painful things

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,610
about being from Aleppo is
to have that kind of shame

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,760
and have that burden that we
actually destroyed our country,

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,131
or watched it being destroyed,
even if there was no way

9
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:27,380
that we could have stopped it.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,050
The wounds are extremely deep,
to the point where I don’t

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,530
know if they will be mended.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,250
So the last time I was
in Aleppo was in 2011.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,680
And went for a couple of
weeks and kind of said

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,030
goodbye to my grandmother’s
home and our home and Aleppo

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,350
in general.

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,630
I went every single day
to my grandmother’s home,

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,000
and I photographed
everything in it.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,220
All of the pieces,
all of the rooms,

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,950
the balcony, her furniture.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,570
I did feel like
this was going to be

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,750
the last time I was going
to be with my grandmother

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,280
in her home.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,240
And it was.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,710
[explosions]

25
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,192
[men shouting]

26
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:15,662
[sound of warfare]

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,150
Watching the war happen,
that was very, very difficult

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,180
because you had extreme
urban warfare happening

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,159
in a historic city.

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,117
[people shouting]

31
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:34,991
[sirens]

32
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:42,520
What happened in Aleppo
is there was a resistance

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,930
against the regime.

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,940
There were protests.

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,650
Many, many, many
peaceful protests.

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,570
The protests were met with
bullets by the Syrian army.

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,360
After the bullets
came, the tanks came.

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,870
After the tanks came,
the airstrikes came.

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,720
During the war over who
would occupy Aleppo,

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,350
it’s separated into two
halves, the east side

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,520
and the west side.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,380
The east side, where
the old city was,

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,300
it was occupied
by the opposition

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,660
to the regime and the
west side by the regime.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,120
It was a military divide.

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,410
It was very arbitrary.

47
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,680
And when you’re from there,
it’s very, very jarring,

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
and it’s very, very painful.

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,459
And all I’m thinking about is
where’s my house on this map.

50
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,250
Where is my grandmother’s
home in this map.

51
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,120
The regime conquered
eastern Aleppo,

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,240
and now has taken
over the entire city.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,710
The city has been gutted.

54
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,280
It’s almost like an earthquake
to the social fabric

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,800
of the country.

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,780
The vast majority
of the destruction

57
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,520
happened in eastern Aleppo.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,300
And it’s in the old city, so
our historic souks were burned.

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,860
The minarets of the Great
Mosque, it collapsed.

60
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,195
And so you’ve lost
these, sort of, icons.

61
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:08,320
If you’re from Aleppo,
there’s certain things there

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,820
that are like your compass.

63
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,302
And those things are gone.

64
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:12,760
And I don’t even
know what it would

65
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,880
feel like to walk in Aleppo
not being able to have those.

66
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,650
But rebuilding is a
part of human nature.

67
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,980
We rebuild after natural
disasters, after wars.

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,590
I hope as an
architect that Aleppo

69
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,310
will be rebuilt in a way that
honors the memory of what

70
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,140
has happened there.

71
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,200
I do believe that
we need to keep

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,340
the memory of the loss
visible, honoring the dead

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,160
and honoring the loss
of our cultural heritage

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:00:00,000
and honoring our homes, that
once were, with dignity.
