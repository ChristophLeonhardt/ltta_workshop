ABBY: HANDSHAKE SEEN AROUND
THE WORLD.
THE LEADERS OF NORTH AND
SOUTH KOREA AGREEING TO END
DECADES LONG WAR.
GRIFF: PRESIDENT TRUMP
TOUTING THE SUMMIT FOR
ENCOURAGING FOR
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
KOREAN PENINSULA?
IS IT THE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
TOUGH TALK THAT LED TO THE
AGREEMENT?
PETE: AUTHOR OF NEW BOOK
JOINS US NOW.
REAPER GHOST TARGET.
YOU SEE IMAGERY AND SEE
DIPLOMACY TO WORK.
IN ORDER TO SEE DIPLOMACY TO
WORK THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF
THAT HAPPENED BEHIND THE
SCENE.
UNPACK WHY A MOMENT LIKE
THAT HAPPENED AND WHO
DESERVES THE CREDIT FOR IT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, TEAM, IT'S
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU THIS
MORNING.
THIS IS THE 12TH GREAT LAKES
SINCE THE END OF THE KOREAN
WAR.
FIRST TIME WE HAVE A
PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION
THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW TO
SYNCHRONIZE THE ELEMENTS OF
NATIONAL POWER TO APPLY AS
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS IT A
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.
SO YOU HAVE HAD DIPLOMATIC
PRESSURE.
INFORMATIONAL PRESSURE.
ALL THESE TWEETS, EVERYBODY
KIND OF LAUGHED OFF.
YOU KNOW,
YOU KNOW THAT GOT UNDER KIM
JONG UN'S SKIN.
HAVE YOU MILITARY PRESSURE
WHERE HAVE YOU THREE CARRIER
STRIKE GROUPS IN THE SEA OF
JAPAN AIR FORCE OF BOMBERS
ON GUAM AND 28,000 GROUND
FORCES ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
THAT'S A VERY CREDIBLE
THREAT BEHIND THE DIPLOMACY,
BEHIND THE INFORMATION
CAMPAIGN.
AND THEN THE ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS.
AND SO THE SYNCHRONIZATION
OF THOSE FOUR PIECES HAVE
APPLIED SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE
TO KIM JONG UN.
AND, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
WE DID IN SYRIA AND HOW WE
HAVE DEFEATED ISIS, WHAT
HAVE YOU GOT IS A PRESIDENT
WHO HAS SAID WHAT IS HE
GOING TO DO AND HE DOES WHAT
HE SAYS.
AND SO IT IS NOT LOST ON KIM
JONG UN.
THE PRESIDENT UNLEASHED THE
MILITARY TO CRUSH ISIS.
THAT HE RESPONDED VERY
FORCEFULLY TWICE AGAINST
SYRIA.
AND HE SAYS HEY, BY THIS
SPRING, IF WE DON'T HAVE A
DEAL, THEN, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING IS GOING TO GO
DOWN.
THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE HAVE
A PRESIDENT THAT IS REALLY
DOING WHAT HE SAYS.
ABBY: THESE IMAGES WE WERE
JUST SHOWING THE AUDIENCE
PRETTY I DIDN'T KNOW
CREDIBLE.
THINK ABOUT THE FIRST TIME
THE KIM DYNASTY STEPPED FOOT
ON SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIAL.
YOU LOOK AT KIM JONG UN
THERE HE IS SMILING.
HE SEEMS HAPPY.
HE SEEMS REALLY MOTIVATED TO
MAKE A CHANGE HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST
SIX MONTHS AND WHAT IS IN IT
FOR NORTH KOREA?
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A FEW
MONTHS AGO THAT HE SEEMED SO
ANGRY WITH THE WEST.
SALUTING OFF BALLISTIC
MISSILES.
IT WAS LIKE EVERY MORNING WE
WERE REPORTING ON ANOTHER
ONE.
WHY DOES HE SEEM SO HAPPY IN
THIS MOMENT?
>> ABBY, THAT'S A GREAT
INSIGHT.
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE IS KIM JONG UN'S
GRANDFATHER HAD A VISION
WHEN HE CAME TO POWER OF
SELF-RELIANCE.
AND SO HE FOCUSED ON
SELF-RELIANCE FOR NORTH
KOREA.
AND THEN KIM JONG UN'S
FATHER, KIM JONG IL HAD A
VISION OF A POWERFUL
MILITARY.
SO HE BUILT THIS MASSIVE
MILITARY WITH ARTILLERY AS A
FOUNDATIONAL PIECE OF IT.
WHEN KIM JONG UN CAME IN.
HE SAID I HAVE TWO VISIONS.
ONE IS FOR A NUCLEAR POWER
AND ONE IS FOR A STRONG
ECONOMY.
AND, PERHAPS, KIM JONG UN IS
PLAYING OFF THE NUCLEAR
PIECE SO HE CAN HAVE A
STRONGER ECONOMY.
SUCCESS HAS A THOUSAND
FATHERS AND FAILURE AND
ORPHAN.
YOU SEE THE LEFT GIVING
CREDIT TO KIM JONG UNITED
AUTO WORKERS UNION'S SISTER.
MAYBE SHE WENT TO THE
OLYMPICS AND WENT BACK THERE
HEY, IT'S PRETTY NICE DOWN
THERE.
THEY HAVE FOOD.
SO, YOU KNOW, SO FOR THAT
MATTER, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IS
