could brexit be over hi I'm from UK I'm Malika Bilal the resignations of two high-profile officials from British prime minister Teresa mayor's cabinet the throne the government into chaos today we explore the political fallout and what it could mean for the future of breakfast right now you are in the stream we are live on al-jazeera and YouTube so leave your comments in the chat Emily and I will try and include them in today's discussion but first have a look at this report from Al Jazeera's Jonah hall trooping into Downing Street a brand new brexit Minister and a brand new foreign minister surrounded by her revamped cabinet tourism a survives as Prime Minister after a turbulent few days but in the current state of British politics there's no guarantee that living to fight another day means any more than just that recent days have seen two senior ministers resign in protest at what resume has chosen as her preferred approach to brexit a business-friendly strategy with close trade ties to the EU some of those who favored a clean break have called it a sellout among them now former foreign minister and Titan of the pro brexit campaign Boris Johnson and David Davis the minister who had been in charge of negotiations with the EU there had been concerns inside Downing Street that Johnson widely thought to cover the top job might launch a bid to unseat the prime minister but that would require the support of other senior brexit supporters in cabinet and outside tourism a said she was looking forward to getting on with a busy week the prime minister trying to give the impression of a leader not in crisis well the resignation letters to prime minister may have caused a stir online but they're just the latest twists in the brexit story entailed hold through a number of hashtags in recent weeks blue ferret use hashtag stop brexit to say officials resigned to save themselves from going down with the sinking ship tell Doran however approves of a so-called hard brexit he'd vote for Boris Johnson to be the next Conservative Party leader but brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt tweets walking out of the government won't make brexit go away and hopes for unity as a means to find an agreement that works I mean thanks Malika so joining us now from London to help us understand where brexit is headed met a co man is the CEO of my life my say that's a youthful ed nonpartisan movement working to foster political dialogue and secure a better brexit Amanda Chetwynd Carson is the co-founder of for our futures sake a youth organization advocating for a people's vote on the terms of the brexit deal and Jonathan Portis is a professor of economics at King's College London he also researches for the think-tank UK in a changing Europe hello everybody I'm just thinking about that that term that phrase break6 shambles looking here Amanda on my laptop laptop Boris Johnson I'm a proud to have served as a foreign secretary it is with sadness and I stepped down here's my letter explaining why is this part of the brexit shambles as far as you're concerned Amanda how would you describe the last three days I mean shambles almost doesn't really go far enough one of their absolute key thing to me Boris stepping down is it's about Boris it's about his own career it's about his in own ego it's not about the country or his even his party to a certain extent if he really really thought that him stepping down was a sign of what was to come for bricks it then his letter would have included what he would have wanted to have seen it would have put like options and different plans on the table but instead it just walked on about himself as always with Boris like the air shambles just doesn't just doesn't even go far enough to be what the last few days have been like Jonathan you're smiling well I agree with that I mean I think you know Boris is about forests and his letter as Amanda said is about him it was full of frankly of lies actually with channel 4 who do a very good fabric series for once actually came out and said Boris his letter is simply lied about the you so I think we can largely dismiss that um but I think the more substantive point is the point that Mandar made which applies not just to Boris but to the more serious Pro brexit forces who don't support Theresa Mays current approach they don't really have an alternative strategy so the problem this is really a problem for the country as a whole not just for the conservative party is um mrs. may strategy is generally it's a lowest-common-denominator strategy nobody remain errs levers most of the Conservative Party the Labour Party no one really likes it but equally no one at the moment has a terribly coherent alternative there's certainly no alternative in which commands a majority in the country there isn't a majority to reverse the referendum despite what Amanda won't like that's just not there at the moment there isn't a majority for the Boris Johnson heart breaks if there isn't a majority for that Teresa may rubbish breaks it and there isn't a majority for that Labour Party let's have our cake and eat it breaks it either so we're at something of a turning point and we don't really know which direction to go it and we don't know Drifter in this well bear it I think that explains why there are so many differing opinions online as well so a couple of people weighing in on the resignations and the shambles this is Rachel who says I voted to remain and I still would my daughter is looking for work in a dance company and European ones are not even auditioning UK dancers at the moment as regards these resignations it's too little and too late I dread to think of what Mr Hunt will do as foreign secretary another person weighing in this is even who says Boris Johnson's resignation is stemming from his foresight the whole Exodus is bound to blow up so he's pressed the eject button before it crushes him that meant a I'm wondering what you think of this last tweet this is a way to get out of things before they all blow up well yeah fortunately I think for our generation it's really disappointing because I think for many young people across the country they've just had enough there's this whole big debate about breaks it across the country I mean Congress it the area and the media that many people still don't understand what breaks it actually means and we just want to sort of get on with there and move on and think about how we could build a country that works for future generations in life or is it happy I agree with Jonathan I don't think there is an appetite for a second referendum or any other vote even though young people of long do probably to remain I think people want to get on and I think it's I agree with their guy perhaps that I think whether you vote to leave remain could involved in a bowl at this point it doesn't matter I think what we need to do is for you to start working together and come towards a common future for the future of our country many the most shocking thing you've just said is that many people don't understand what brexit means how is that possible two years of conversation yeah well I mean the most googled question after we left the European Union oh yeah what which was what is the European Union Google I'm not what highlight if you had a free month period or three to four month period offer build-up to the referendum which you know in this country I wasn't educated about what the European anything about the history of it and that's part of the problem that we had in the UK people don't even know what their local national government does we don't have political and civic education in the UK which is why historically you've had a lower turnout among young people because it's not that they don't care about the issues that affect them of course they do it's about whether they see traditional forms of politics as a vehicle to address those issues that they care about so at this moment you know you have this bubble in Westminster which is constantly talking about brings it and I don't think that for most of the country people are angry I don't fit young people are angry about I think if you ask people whether they're not happy about it they'll probably say - you're normally yeah we don't think Briggs is gonna be a good thing but I don't think if you said to people like I've we've had so many focus groups and events with young people and when you ask them what rights you concerned about losing theirs number-one question they'll say back to you is what I don't know what rights I have to lose because no-one's been educated about it so until people start to see the effects of it that's when they'll probably start to be angry but until then unfortunately you know people don't know what's happening and they just want to go on with it Jonathan let me just share this with our audience it's a piece that you wrote on the 11th of June you're part of a think tank called the UK and a changing Europe Theresa Mays craap sit explain CREP acronym um that was a pun in that the government actually came out with a proposal which said we should have a customs and regulatory alignment period part of the way of solving some of the problems that arise from leaving the customs union and leaving the single market in particular as relate as regards the the border for Northern Ireland um so it was a pun but it does actually describe I'm afraid rather what to really maids breaks it looks like it of course Boris Johnson used pretty much the same language in describing the Teresa may approach to Briggs it during the famous cabinet meeting about checkers last week and I think as I said um the the Bridget that Teresa may has come up with it's a sort of lowest common denominator it keeps us having and half out of the mechanisms of the European Union in particular the customs union single market but it doesn't give us any sort of vote or a voice in how those regulations are made in future so it really isn't going to satisfy anyone and won't satisfy the people who want us to be completely free of me EU it won't satisfy the people who want us to stay part of the single market to maintain freedom of movement and the other mechanisms that that apply at the moment but equally uh there's not really any coherent alternative on the table I'm certainly not coming from Boris Johnson and David Davis as Amanda said they walk down said they weren't happy but they didn't give us any sort of alternative plan and equally we don't really have a coherent plan that involves remaining in the EU hi there given that I think Metis is right in this there isn't an appetite at the moment among the public as a whole to reverse the result of freedom so we are stuck in this limbo and it can last at some point something we'll have to give we will have to make some decisions but we don't seem to be ready for that yet you know it's interesting Jonathan the reason we're in this limbo according to a few people online is because the Prime Minister herself wanted to remain in the EU this is Richard a tweet he sent us saying the EU will be in a far more stronger position now that those two ministers have resigned May is a remainer and she'll do anything to stay in the EU bubble as the old saying goes a leopard never changes its spots and one more person sent us a video comment this is Steven wolf and a former stream guests and a member of European Parliament and he talks about that very same issue have a listen Tereza maids cabinet meeting in checkers effectively delivered a remain a coup and the death of brexit no-one now believes having read the communique that she truly believes in bringing back control of all our laws from the European Union not pay money in some form to the European Union be controlled by the European Court of Justice and also controlling immigration it is very clear that she is delivering a remainer brexit not a true brexit and there our audience couldn't see there well while Stephen was talking you could see Amanda kind of shaking your head from side to side Jonathan I knew and know you want to get in but I want to hear what was behind that for Amanda I just and when they could a remain a coup like ending freedom of movement leaving the single market living the customs union like the word leaving and stop happens three times there like that is not anything to do with remaining the government have gotten a massive charm offensive on this they're trying to sell it as a soft brexit because they think a compromise it's going to be the only way they can get people around this like the soft levers the soft ramona's and that's what they need because currently the reason they just doesn't have a parliamentary majority kind of for anything but definitely for any form of brexit deal that's controversial so when you're leaving the single market and you're leaving the customs union and you're ending freedom of movement and you're ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ that isn't that's not a soft break that has a hard brexit but Boris and David couldn't hack it they didn't they didn't whatever kind of say okay maybe that's okay but that's not and you know yeah we're leaving but we might have the same rules but it doesn't fit with their narrative so that I just yeah to me like that couldn't that couldn't be a harder brexit if you tried apart from like a No Deal if we just left like tomorrow or something but Jonathan um I slightly disagree with Amanda I mean I do think that Tariq Tereza made his proposal whether you call it Hydra soft is a much softer form of brexit then Davis tour jourdan's in or Stephen wolf would like and I think Stephen is who I've been on I think I may have been on this show with him in fact a while back um Stephen is at least consistent his vision of BRICS it makes sense it is we cut our ties with the EU completely we're out completely we turn we're treated as a 2/3 country and were treated by them as a third country and that's logical and deliverable and actually the EU have said if we want to do that we can it's up to us the problem is that a the vast majority of serious economists think it would do very serious damage to the UK economy and business agrees and B it is not what a majority of the people voted for or what a majority of the people want there was never a majority in parliament in the country certainly not in business for the sort of Briggs's Stephen wants so the idea that oh it's all the fault of backstabbing remain errs like Teresa may or it's all the fault of conniving Brussels bureaucrats or so on and so forth which is the sort of narrative you get from Stephen and people like Johnson just doesn't make sense if this is not that sort of private he wants is perfectly plausible but it is not what the British public wants it's not what the British Parliament wants and it would be an absolute disaster for the UK economy so it can't happen the question is what will well or it can have if it does happen it will happen by accident the question is how do we get through this in a way which does somehow command some sort of majority support um I also agree with Amanda however that no clear the Tories amazed half-baked compromise commands majority support either and that's what the last few days I've demonstrated Mehta Amish play this to you I I'm gonna do a come clean I found it on Amanda's Twitter page okay so this is what I found in her Twitter page people throughout UK it's the a brand new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and just listen to what he says towards the end made a very interesting but what I'm saying is that when we have negotiated the terms of our departure this is a huge decisions will have an impact not just for the next five years but the next 75 years the terms of our trade with our the countries on our doorstep is unbelievably important in terms of the jobs the opportunities for young people for many generations and I do think that people should have a chance to have their say on those terms and people should be able to have their say on those terms Boris Johnson has left this is the new foreign secretary met a what did he just say what does that mean you just you just look for people's opinion at this date to go back to having any sort of referendum on them on brakes it won't be helpful at all because don't forget one of the reasons why we had it brings it in the first place is because people felt empowered for the first time through the electoral system we live with we live in a country where if you live in where I live in Hackney for example if you're a conservative voter you've got no chance and your vote don't count and vice versa there are places in across the UK where if you live in a conservative area and your labour votes are your vote doesn't count nationally for the brexit referendum whether you referendum it was the first electoral system where people it was one vote one person and many people thought empowered and that was the way they express so I think if you were to reverse the decision I mean it turns into a bit like a soccer football match you know if let's say for example you had another referendum and then it was rejected and then it was like 50 to 48 in the other side what then happens do we have a further referendum to sort out I think you know I mean that's not the way to go forward I think there isn't an appetite among the public I think people want to get on with it I think I was just listening to what Jonathan and Amanda were saying and again you know when we even when the media the way the media describes Briggs and I don't think it's helpful the more we talk about every Maness what breaks it the more we talk about a hardest wolf breaks it for Briggs it tears I find all sort of languages again well it does is it puts us into these two different camps that existed during the referendum and I don't think it's helpful you know break is mine I think one of the key findings off breaks are the key things that Mozart breaks it is that it divided between young and old between cities and towns between those who are graduates and one graduates and I think the more we keep inviting back to two years ago the more that those divisions are more exacerbated and I don't think it's helpful that the way we move forward I think we need to unify and I think if we were to rejoin if we were to think about saying that you you I think it would have to be through done through rejoining European Union maybe for my generation when we're when we're order but I think if you're talking about repressing breaks it you know I don't think like I think people will lose I mean people don't even trust me why would they trust in the future again hmm Mitsy keeping that in mind I want to share two perspectives one that agrees with you one that may not this is Hayden who says I do extreme I was on a March a few weeks ago with hundreds of thousands of people of all political persuasions hoping we could gain at people's vote the mood was optimistic and defiant personally UK labor have disappointed me greatly but I like others will not be deterred now they got pushed back this is Tom who says in the country the silent majority still want brexit a people's vote are deluded if they think a new referendum could be won especially after the establishment have tried to shaft them Amanda that's really deluded I mean I personally think more deluded is Boris you know he'd like we've just gone through everything he's ever said and even hunt is diluted and rubbed the new brexit secretary like they have these visions that are just so unrepresentative particularly of what younger generations want but I think what's really interesting there was and I can't member the wording but in the second tweet it picked up on being in London and it's all about in London for the March where a hundred thousand people came to that March well I was one of the organizations that helped organize it and I was my friend Ruth um Barry came buses came from all over the country like the whales from Liverpool from Cornwall from Devon from Norfolk like this wasn't the London Metropolitan elite marching through London this was a genuine variety of people like rich poor black white walking through London because they were so annoyed at the fact that we're going to lose jobs are gone economy is gonna be worse like nobody can point to a good news story out of brexit right now and it takes quite a lot to get a hundred thousand people from all across the country walking through the streets of London in a protest I would say Jonathan as a professor of economics who has studied brexit and the economic impact it may have on the United Kingdom and on Europe of course as well would you like to ask one of the guests who is not a professor of economics um well I mean I think the question I'd like to ask met a in particular was I have some sympathy with his point of view as I said I don't think as he he's riding a huge appetite for a second referendum but the divisions he's talked about which come through very clearly in the sort of analysis that I as an economist in my political science colleagues do divisions he come he sets out there there they're not they're not they were not produced by brakes it and nothing in the economic analysis that that I've done or anybody else has done suggests as they will be solved by brakes it if anything they're likely to be made worse by brexit the question I'd like to ask chemist you know given that Briggs it is and I suspect he occasionally agrees with this brakes it is not the solution to the divisions social or economic divisions of the UK um why is it that we should be doing and how is it exactly that we can with Briggs it hanging over us I like leek absorb so much of the political and policy energy in the UK over the next few years you know how do we get how do we how does he see a way through this but I actually find it very difficult unfortunately I wish I had an answer meta is going to ask me that question let a go for it I admire you even try Mattie is thinking up the response may take over it just to solve just to make clear from the start you I am someone who voted to remain probably will still prefer you liking this remain part of the European Union I just don't think that if you do it I think going against the the will of the people I think will open us into a very dangerous route you know they're very lucky in the UK where people are not usually skeptical about the outcome of elections and parts of the world it's a big problem where people don't read and trust the elections and I think that we tried to go back to the res I agree with Jonathan I think there are big problems I think we just done and it's so we run the all parts of parliamentary group and abettor breaks it for young people and we just have a nationwide review on whether young people believe that this current government will be able to deliver that brings it about deliver for future generations and many young people of course don't don't believe that their voices are being heard and they don't feel that you know this government will particularly pursue a brexit that will deliver for future generations because some of the issues like Amanda mentioned that matter to us around freedom movement of course a massive major issues but you know I think we need to have a real conversation with with the European Union about looking about how we can actually go forward and I think part of the problem with Teresa Mae's government is right at the outset they ruled out all the different options that were on the table and I think that I'm good particularly in the conversation that I had with the European Union when I went to meet with them after our report large I think there isn't a real opportunity to think about creating a bespoke deal um I know I sound like a Briton when I say this but you know when we talk about in the we Jamil model or when we talk about the Swiss model these models didn't exist before the Swiss or Norwegian model and so why can't we have UK model that works for our generation I mean ultimately for me you know as I said I've got you to remain yeah I wish Britain never work to do but I think they are thinking about my generation and future generations and I don't care about the politics of it so whether European Union or UK music metier metier and Amanda and Jonathan thank you half an hour goes super fast let me show you something here there's a countdown clock from the think tank that Dawson is part of the UK in a changing Europe how many days hours minutes and seconds before brexit actually happens Milica how should we end our conversation with this live comment on YouTube from Bluegreen who says there can only be a hard brexit and the sentiments of the EU over brexit are clear they've acted to punish the UK at every turn and anything less than hard brexit the EU will use against the UK one per student view thank you guess thank you for community this will not be the last time I am sure we will be discussing brexit and we will continue our coverage online and on al-jazeera as well thanks for watching Malik and I will see you next time you
