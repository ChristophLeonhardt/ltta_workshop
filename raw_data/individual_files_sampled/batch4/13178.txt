you're married how long married now six years okay so yeah kids in in the foreseeable future here you know it's funny you say that I would love to be to point my life where I could have kids and the things I've always had to work so much recently so that's one thing we're definitely working on is finding more balance so we are you know we don't have we don't have the Daily wire budget we're not exactly running the Jim Henson budget that you have here and your heat lamps but you know getting you know getting 16 I would take a 12-hour day most days you know and maybe a ten-hour day here there outside of Sunday and I think I'd have more balanced life so it did they are in the future just not right how does my wife deal with all this I mean it's it's it's hard it's hard yeah it is hard in my wife um she's very supportive you know she did she worked she was a vice president of a contract furniture company she frogged some chairs that don't squeak and she left the job and she's just kind of she doesn't work for me or the company full-time but she's really good in it personally people love her so for showing a guest around or if we need to help kind of book some travel she's been very helpful for her that's been really relieving I think this is with a lot of women you know they think they think they have to work their way up and she did she worked her way up in a company but realize that's not what you wanted to do it is hard on her it's just like probably well your wife is a doctor obviously indeed yes that's the rumor and a very a very attractive lady your wife you've done very well for yourself on and it with us with what we do because like I said this respect my show is substantially at more of a workload to put a Daily Show like are a late night show comedy shows have to be written it yes and and we do the sketches in the production you know it's not really difficult so it's kind of like we had Brian Shaw World's Strongest Man on the show recently we had George daniel cormier current UFC heavyweight light heavyweight champion and it really is a partnership where their wives have to support them in a way that's not typical and weak I know some women are gonna be furious when they hear this but it is a volunteer role but my wife is kind of accepted that okay Steve's gonna need a little more support because he isn't even if I don't help him with one she's not gonna take 20 minutes to eat and that comes down to you know when I'm done working listening to her making sure that her needs are met that's a really important thing if we're gonna bitch about feminism then we need to talk about being real men and that means yes well you know sounds namby-pamby ting you WAIS needs making sure that and that's just that's not just physically and financially we're talking about spiritually emotionally making sure that they feel heard that they feel safe um so it really has been a learning process and I will say that contra did some people who we know my wife's are very strong have you met my wife sure yeah well yeah that's right am i with you she's very stout on personality so for us there was a lot of clashing early on as opposed to some friends who were both Type B personalities where they never argued but some of these people just got divorced like what happened they never gone to marital counseling they never had a fight and the first fight was the blowout whereas my wife and I the arc is it was a lot tougher early on and it got easier do you think we both got any better at marriage or you just round off each other's edges a little bit I think we both we've both both now and listened to much DMX both we've both gotten better at marriage and communication for sure and I think a big a big part of it is is uh you know really learning that people inherently are selfish you know men struggle with pornography men always have for women the pornography is romantic comedy and The Bachelor right if he loves he'll love me just the way I am no man loves you just the way you are he loves you just he loves you as you are but there are things he doesn't like about you just like you know a woman won't try to change me woman's always gonna try to change you I don't have a problem with it means they're trying to better you now if you become the only one that you're working on if I'm working on me and she's working on me and that's a problem when we started our marriage there was a lot of that I was the project you know I needed a lot of work and now we've both both worked on ourselves and and learned how to communicate more effectively and I do think that is something that's really important you know in high-pressure positions or high-profile positions people mocked mike pence you know it's a good example a lot of people don't understand for example if you're alone in a car with a woman who's not your wife someone can snap a picture and it's a big deal even if nothing happened this is correct there are certain pressures that come with your position my position that a lot of people don't know this isn't the celebrity relating yourself from the possibility of sin is a definite yes in any position where you are prominent at all you've got to take the proper precautions you've got to determine what is a worthy risk and what isn't I know this is what what's a worthwhile risk for a guy who painted Mohammedan menstrual blood I got the irony is not lost but no my I wouldn't I wouldn't have been able to accomplish what we have you know what what moderate success we have and I'm grateful for with
