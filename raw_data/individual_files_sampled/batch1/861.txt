country for James Ridgeway reporting the story of solitary confinement in the u.s. has been something of a solitary pursuit for nearly a decade every week Ridgeway visits his local post office collecting letters sent to him from prisons around the country the letter servers key source material because they come from key sources people held in isolation and six by five foot cells for 22 and a half hours a day for days weeks months even years well when we started our project there was there was literally hardly anything about solitary confinement in the press and at a TV or newscast or papers the only way I could connect with people was to letters so just plain letters no phones no emails no real visits no press contacts I sort of thought to myself these guys are reporters what they've got to say is the way in that's the way in that's the way to break the security and you got over 80,000 people in solitary confinement the United States I did over 13 years incarceration five of which was in solitary when we mentioned these numbers to folk they said no this can't be happening in America but yes it is happening America it's happening every day nobody thought about solitary confinement as something that occurs in the United States you might have thought of it as something that occurs in totalitarian regimes around the world but solitary confinement in the United States as a routine and integral and normalized part of our criminal justice system has really been invisible until very recently we can't we were trying to do a report we wanted to do it before you came on down and you're gonna have to make a right go into this parking lot and just can we do anything look can we film anything that on any given day there are more than 80,000 people are housed in isolation in the US prison system some would say that that constitutes a big story the problem is that journalists are not allowed into prisons like Rikers Island here in New York City they have no access and with no access is the story itself that risks being held in isolation underreporting is one problem misrepresentation is another across TV and film prisoners held in solitary portrayed as 21st century boogeyman natural-born killer psychopaths are how to catch and carry killers don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like this isn't that's had an impact a complex story of a huge problem in the u.s. criminal justice system has been oversimplified in popular culture and in public perception I've met people who really believe that the system is balanced that everyone in solitaire deserves to be there because they're violent you know and and but you have never been to prison so the only other explanation is where they receiving these messages from unfortunately there is still a tendency that prisoners in solitary confinement are are portrayed as as extremely dangerous people for whom there really is no other alternative and that's just not the case solitary confinement units in the United States are stuffed to the rafters with the mentally ill with the developmentally disabled people are put in solitary confinement for having too many postage stamps for having too many pencils they are the Walking Dead that's how they're viewed and what can I say I mean you know I don't view it like I've you is a fantastic army of reporters now a lot of them doing so much of anything but every once in a while you you'll get a letter that has real information in it you'll get a letter that has real information in it that's really valuable in terms of understanding of the system works Ridgeway has been documenting that system on solitary watch a website he set up back in 2009 he now has correspondence with more than 5000 subscribed prisoners the site has reported on every angle every detail of conditions in isolation from prisoners diminished human rights through to their mental health the last month that solitary watch published the most recent essay by Jack powers and inmates in Colorado he's been in isolation for almost 30 years and has contributed several compelling accounts of psychiatric trauma and then there's Texas inmate Thomas Whittaker he was facing a death sentence his regular writings may well have had an impact on the Board of Pardons and Paroles which decided to spare him solitary watch get firsthand stories of what these people are being subjected to they of Tennessee of the humanizing folk and given them sense of hope to voice their suffering to the public it should make the Society's trying to investigate whether or not this is actually occurring most reporters in most newspapers media will concentrate on the big bad criminal so we try to bury him point man in a 6x9 cell he's interesting but we don't want him to get out he's sort of a devil and he is evil he's always evil and of course we have places like the Marshall project solitary watch it even vice who have balanced that out by you know injecting and infusing you know first-hand accounts and narratives into the conversation Ridgeway is no longer alone in his campaign to get stories on a solitaire from the inside an inmate would spend in October last year Oprah Winfrey teams up with CBS 60 minutes to report on the conditions of prisoners held in the infamous Pelican Bay State Prison in California and the efforts underway there to reduce the use of solitary confinement sometimes years and even decades at a time in this room alone scenes like that showcasing prisoner conditions have also made it onto Netflix solitary confinement HBO versions in the BBC and it's not just media attention before he left office President Obama introduced a series of directives and guidelines including an outright ban on juveniles in solitary it remains unclear whether the Trump administration will roll back on those promises or commit to continued reform but regardless audiences are finally hearing from some of the solitary voices solitary voices that remain in confinement
