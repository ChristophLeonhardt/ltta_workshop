Hello.
This is Juan Antonio Bayona,
director of "Jurassic World:
Fallen Kingdom." You’re
watching a scene that takes
place halfway
through the story.
We find our characters,
Claire and Owen, Chris Pratt
and Bryce Dallas
Howard, inside a boat —
a massive boat
full of dinosaurs.
And they just survived
a big volcano eruption.
And we still don’t know why
the dinosaurs are there, what
is the purpose with
them, and we still
don’t know where are we going.
This scene came with
the idea that we
needed a thrilling moment
into this long section
of the movie that
felt a little static,
but we didn’t have
many elements.
I came with this idea that
because the characters were
performing a surgery
on a velociraptor,
on Blue, later on, maybe
they will need some blood
to get a transfusion before
they perform the surgery.
So I suggested to
Steven Spielberg
to get a moment of
comedy and tension,
where the characters
are inside this truck
with a T. rex,
trying to get blood.
And he loved the idea.
“Oh.
Ugh."
NARRATOR: It was a moment
very open to improvisation.
It felt very organic, so
I gave a lot of freedom
to the actors, and they
came with brilliant lines.
And of course, we had to
create this big animatronic.
And it was great
because the actors
were able to perform in
front of something real.
There was a lot of excitement
on set, and they used that.
There’s a combination
of animatronics with CGI
as the scene moves
forward in order
to be able to make the
dinosaur perform movement
that would have been
very complicated
with an animatronic.
Also, Chris came
with this idea
of finishing the scene
with Owen jumping
through the mouth
of the T. rex,
and I felt that
was very exciting.
It was a real stunt that he
performed no more than three
times because it felt
pretty dangerous,
and we wanted to
take care of him.
And we didn’t force
him to make it
more than three times.
“Did you see that?"
" Uh huh!"
