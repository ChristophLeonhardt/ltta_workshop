let me show you a hole it's almost hilarious it would be hilarious if it weren't so awful brian Stelter is is plugging The Handmaid's Tale now you all know the handmade cells this dystopian thing is based on a novel I read the novel I haven't seen the show I will tell you that the show is made in part by people I know and people I have worked with who I think are as talented as anybody in Hollywood as talented and intelligent I'm sure the show is good I just didn't happen to like the novel so I didn't watch the show but they selling this dystopian show in which women have lost all their rights and they're forced to go around dressed like the Flying Nun and those big hats I don't know what the point of those big has been Sally Field at least could fly around wherever the hell she lived that's nothing but I don't know why they're wearing these in in this thing but anyway they wear these hats and they're forced to have babies bottle of all blah blah brian Stelter is promoting this as in fact the hands maids tell people have promoted it as being an actual commentary on Trump's America just listen to a minute of this it's unbelievable in the world of Trump plot lines that were once thought to be too outlandish are no longer I would be very happy if my show became irrelevant as quickly as possible Bruce Miller is the creator of Hulu's breakout emmy-winning series The Handmaid's Tale conceived before the election the chilling show went on to capture the lightening of the current political environment our writers room is very news aware Trump pushing out all these hot-button issues brings them to the fore and they become conversations in the writers room hard to fathom since The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian show set in a made-up place called Gilead where women's rights have been stripped under a twisted totalitarian regime we don't do anything on the show that hasn't happened isn't happening to women somewhere in the world it feels like a cautionary tale more than ever what does it mean for this program to be on now and the Trump age has far more meaning and urgency as we see women's rights particularly women's reproductive rights under attack yet again unbelievable now when he says that we don't do anything on the show that isn't happening to women somewhere in the world I agree but it's happening in the Muslim world not this world not the world that we live in the lovely western world that we live in where women have any right you can imagine there is an argument to be had about abortion that we were not allowed to have because the Supreme Court shut the political process down with roe v wade there's an argument to be had about abortion it is not just about a woman's right it is also about the babies right there's another person involved that's not at The Handmaid's Tale that people want to debate abortion it's insane
