a new round of clashes has erupted on the Israeli Gaza border as part of a so-called great march of return the anti occupation campaign by Palestinians started at the end of March Israeli Defense Forces deployed tanks and have been using live ammunition and tear gas to break up the demonstrations some Palestinian protesters have found inventive ways though to counter the toxic fumes they've made their own masks filled with perfume and cotton some of even used fruit and vegetables water bottle we cut it like this because the tear gas causes suffocation especially in young kids we also put onions to block the gas from entering the mouth and nose because it burns them internally we don't have special equipment or material we can't provide proper respirators when we come here they throw tear gas we can't breathe they also shoot us in the legs I use this to protect myself I felt my eyes burning as if ever was in my eyes I started coughing so hard when I inhaled teargas I decided to make my own mask to protect myself if they fired teargas at us I will smell the onion well since the beginning of the standoff there have been scores of Palestinian casualties meanwhile an IDF soldier who shot a Palestinian on the Gaza border during a protest in December has been cleared of wrongdoing by a military inquiry video emerged of him firing shots alongside other snipers who cheered and laughed of the injuries they inflicted Wow I did nothing I was just a demonstration I went for my friends to help them and before I reach the place they shot me the soldier knew that I was going to help them and that's why I was shot camel how ashes from the Palestine Solidarity campaign says Israeli soldiers react to protests in a disproportionate and inhumane way an absolute act of target practice effectively because the cheering from the the soldiers fellow soldiers basically was just completely inhumane and outrageous in the West I challenge them to produce evidence anywhere that this would happen and in any case this shows you that the difference on the one side you have heavily armored armed soldiers and on the other side all you have protesters who might have a stone to throw from a long long way away it's not exactly going to damage the the defense or hit the soldier
