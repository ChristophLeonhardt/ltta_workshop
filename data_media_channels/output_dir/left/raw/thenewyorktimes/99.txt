1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,930
Out here in
agriculture country,

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,680
we can’t just sit around
and hope that things

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,985
are going to get better.

4
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:08,208
I’m a Republican.

5
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,938
I’ve always been a Republican.

6
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:11,754
I voted for President Trump.

7
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:12,660
I want to support him.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,700
China and others have
targeted our farmers.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,210
Not good.

10
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,080
Not nice.

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,210
And you know what our
farmers are saying?

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,730
It’s O.K., we can take it.

13
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,060
These are incredible people.

14
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,595
We can take it.

15
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,130
That makes my blood
boil,

16
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,990
because by God, I’ll tell you this:

17
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,900
I can draw a
direct line

18
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,820
from when the president
started this tariff rhetoric

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,930
in the price of my soybeans.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:58,085
The United States was allowed
to truly get ripped off.

21
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:01,910
In March, the price of
soybeans was $10.50 a bushel.

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,940
Today, it’s $8.50 a bushel.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,890
That’s a 20% decrease.

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,280
I have to tell you, Mr.
President, this hurts.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,920
This is hurting our
long-term future.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,900
This is hurting me.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,525
Whether it’s transportation,
whether it’s production,

28
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,400
whether it’s the clerk
at the grocery store —

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,650
when agriculture
gets sick, everybody

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,430
feels that kind of pain.

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,510
It’s really easy
to be ideological

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,990
when both your belly
and your wallet are fat.

33
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,510
But when you’re
broke and hungry,

34
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,340
then you have to be practical.

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,060
Mr. President, what I
would tell you is this —

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,110
we’ve built these agriculture
markets, for decades —

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,620
your tariff rhetoric serves
to only tear those down

38
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,807
and to provide uncertainty
to the market.

39
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,340
You’re going to
make it back, and it’s

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,500
going to be made back faster
than anybody would know.

41
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,830
Hope is not a marketing
plan.

42
00:01:53,830 --> 00:00:00,000
Hope is not a business plan,
and I know you know that.
