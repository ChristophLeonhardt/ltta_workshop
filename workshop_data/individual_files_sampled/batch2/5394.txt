as you know there's now a vacancy on the Supreme Court and if you turn in Monday at nine o'clock I think you're going to be extremely happy always plugging a time slot good lord all right they're all great but could one choice actually pose a greater threat to the president than the others Brandee reporting in The New York Times today lays bare Donald Trump's cavanaugh conundrum judge Brett Kavanaugh widely reported to be the frontrunner once argued that a president could be impeached for lying the reporting from today's New York Times details Cavanaugh's role in the Independent Counsel investigation conducted by Ken Starr into President Clinton quote he was argued that President Bill Clinton could be impeached for lying to his staff and misleading the public a broad definition of obstruction of justice that would be damaging if applied to President Trump in the Russia investigation but now if Trump passes over Kavanaugh could the decision itself suggest that he's worried about what would happen if he were held to that standard if he could be impeached for lying to his staff and misleading the public the Trump Tower cover-up suddenly looks more ominous to this president the panel's back to help us understand the stakes for the President and for the Moller investigation if Trump picks after today's news and if he rejects Cavanaugh Frank you and I've been talking since this Supreme Court vacancy it feels like 11 weeks ago but I think there's only a few days ago since this seat opened up about the potential cases that could end up before the United States Supreme Court involving the Muller investigation questions about whether or not you can indict a president questions about obstruction of justice question is about whether you can subpoena our president it seems like this was put out there perhaps to maybe give the president pause but but it seems like there's equal peril and passing him over and maybe showing your hands in terms of your degree of concern about the obstruction of justice investigation itself so this is going to be one of the biggest decisions the president ever makes as any president ever ever makes but this is going to be personal for the president and so what we're going to see happen here is he's going to pick the most personally expedia and choice that he can but there's there's a dilemma as you said because Kavanagh there's there's two separate conflicting issues here one is he's come out with it with this researcher this this these statements that seem to say you can be impeached under these circumstances and so that seems to to sway the president against selecting him but in the same vein Kavanagh has previously come out with regard to impeachment excuse me with yeah with regard to criminal charges and said no we can't we shouldn't be filing criminal charges against the sitting president so you've got impeachment and you've got criminal charges so if the president thinks he's going to be impeached he likely won't go with Kavanagh if he thinks he's facing criminal charges as well he will go with Kavanagh and the thing is you can't predict what a Supreme Court justice is going to do but he must be tied up in knots on this right now I can't believe your thoughts yeah I think it's the same I mean from the beginning I the fact that he did work for a Kansas star with that Independent Counsel investigation was a double-edged sword just for the the reasons that Frank pointed out he was somebody obviously who believes in the ability of an Independent Counsel to do his or her job so that cuts against the president's constant messaging that the Special Counsel investigation that's going on in to him is some is nefarious in some way also don't forget that Kavanagh is the chief author of the Starr report which is filled with all sorts of salacious sexual details about Bill Clinton which on the one hand Trump may be happy to talk about but on the other hand it brings more attention to his own issues in that era in that area so there are a lot of conflicting things that will come out in a confirmation hearing that the president may like a lot and other things that he may not like it all what US have a new reporting this afternoon well I think what's striking here is that this is the last of the rollout of Supreme Court justice Gorsuch was something this White House did really well yeah and you know for a White House staff that has faced a lot of dysfunction and it's sort of tripped over its own feet a number of times mostly caused by the President himself that was something they held close to the vest they were able to do so in secret they sort of we knew the final to the president wasn't to be fair the president was involved in the process it was run another White House counsel's alright but Don began the read in at the end of which perhaps prevent me from leaking but that's something they were very happy with and there's internal there's pressure to do that again yeah they really want to get this choice for in Canada is Megantic that's right they they really they know this is a big moment for the president as legacy going forward but they also want this to go really well in this prime time setting Monday night before he goes off I'm ready for the guy that thinks he can be impeached for lying hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
