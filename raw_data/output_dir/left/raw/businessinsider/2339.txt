51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,829
it's it's very attractive so we sell our

subscription on a zip code bases to

57
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,740
individual real estate agents now how

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,210
did the advertising market fair last

59
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,149
year well as you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall</font>

60
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,050
advertising market

61
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">was pretty bad last year but our revenue</font>

62
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,200
was up sixty-five percent year-over-year

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
2009 2008 so we continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow very</font>

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,500
quickly and very pleased<font color="#CCCCCC"> with how we</font>

65
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,940
ended up do you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that expanding</font>

66
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,680
through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes growing the</font>

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
2010 is actually off to a great start

68
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,250
and I think not just at Zillow but I

69
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,470
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of optimism around</font>

70
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,840
online advertising and I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

71
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of positive signals out of the online</font>

72
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,900
advertising space great so what's next

73
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">for zillow are we gonna see an IPO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

74
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">time soon I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you see an IPO</font>

75
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,200
in 2010 I think optimistically it's

76
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,860
possible in 2011 but what's next for

77
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,360
zillow<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be profitability and then</font>

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,890
at some point in my p.o great so is that

79
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,440
it within reach this next year cash flow

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,480
positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's within reach i</font>

81
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,580
think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on on how the</font>

82
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,320
stars align great so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> last question</font>

83
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,270
your value proposition to your customers

84
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,450
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you initially started this business</font>

85
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,590
what was it and how have you seen that

86
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">girl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um when we initially started the</font>

87
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,160
business it was about providing real

88
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,750
estate information and empowering the

89
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,670
consumer with lots of tools letting them

90
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,530
be in control of the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

91
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,540
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its expanded to</font>

92
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,640
include rentals and mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications</font>

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,260
and lending we now have a mortgage

94
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,090
marketplace where borrowers are in

95
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,560
control but the overall value

96
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposition of putting power in the</font>

97
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,860
hands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer really hasn't</font>
