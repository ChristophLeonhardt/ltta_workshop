00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,800
Widow the golden eagle. She's an
extremely unique bird.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,530
She circles over our head
anywhere from 500 to

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,749
four or five 5,000 feet.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,420
When you take a bird that
you know from ground zero

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,900
and you train it, you watch it learn
how to fly, and you see it

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,629
catch its first rabbit or
whatever that is,

7
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,130
you can see the light
go on in that bird.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,199
And you can see it becoming an
eagle right in front of your eyes.

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,890
So he's great, yes 
he's better.

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,979
And then as it gets closer and
closer to release time,

11
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,959
you can see the light come on
their eyes and they really tell

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,000
us it's time to be turned
loose.

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,299
You know it becomes kind of
bittersweet because you've

14
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,809
worried about this bird, you've
taught it all these things but

15
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:16,749
yet now you have to turn it
loose and hope that what you've

16
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:19,180
taught it or, or the experiences
gained with you

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:00:00,000
is enough to have it survive.
