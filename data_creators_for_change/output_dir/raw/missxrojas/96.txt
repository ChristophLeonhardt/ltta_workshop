12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,710
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem strange to me to</font>

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,110
write to him today but it's the little

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,570
frustrations an absent letter and

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,030
envelope too small that lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to feel</font>

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a brat throwing a tantrum but then</font>

Lewis how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> will it be for always</font>

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,140
how often will the vast emptiness

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,570
astonish me like a complete novelty and

21
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,330
make me say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never realized my loss</font>

22
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,500
till this moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then zaidi you were</font>

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,380
horses and individuals a short time

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,060
before he dies he discovers that the

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,189
patient labyrinth of lions traces the

32
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:24,689
lineaments of his own face and rolling

33
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,030
to the well-organized mind death is but

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,259
the next great adventure I miss him I

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,689
want him back his birthday cake could be

36
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,270
a fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> hazard but I will always have</font>

37
00:01:37,270 --> 00:00:00,000
books and I think that's beautiful
