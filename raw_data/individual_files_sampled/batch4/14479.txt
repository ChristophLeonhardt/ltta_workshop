tell me the response by the liberal premier of Nova Scotia to this startling news of 60 billion u.s. worth of the good stuff under their feet well unbelievably Ezzor they've decided not to proceed with it just unfortunately and a prayer for the course around here as you know here in New Brunswick we have a moratorium on shale gas development that means not only will shale gas resources not be developed but also the existing wells that are producing have stopped producing so it's it was a real blow here in New Brunswick and to look across the border you know just across the isthmus to Nova Scotia and see them going down the same road it's really disheartening because I think this part of the world has a lot to offer the rest of Canada and we can stand on our own two feet but we have to be able to use the resources that we have to the best of their ability and unfortunately we're seeing both Liberal government's in New Brunswick and in Nova Scotia now saying no to shale gas and no to development and that's a real problem as right well I mean I find it hard to understand and I think it's because I come from oil and gas country I'm born in Alberta and I've traveled to oil and gas places around the world I was just in Texas with you and I spent some time looking investigating fracking in Pennsylvania I remember we spent a day or two down there so I know how normal fracking is I know it's been going on for you know since almost the 40s I know it's been done hundreds of thousands of times without incident you know in Canada and probably a million times in the States so it just feels so normally most natural gas in North America is frakked it's so normal what what is it that causes politicians to say no to it in the Atlantic so reflexively I mean if someone told me that there was sixty billion dollars worth of anything under have a particular province if it was diamonds or gold or oil or gas or uranium surely there would be a more interest in it than just act now no thanks kick the can down the road how can this just be shrugged I feels like it's just shrugged off without even any consideration well I think that's exactly the case as our answer seems to have been the case in Nova Scotia you know they didn't there was no process of really evaluating what the potential was there was kind of a knee-jerk reaction that said no and I think part of the problem is that although you're well aware that that fracking can be done and is done like you see thousands of times across North America in a safe and responsible way that message hasn't gotten out here in Atlantic Canada and and so there's still you know certainly within the liberal side a real reticence to to develop these resources and I think in the minds of the public they haven't been convinced that that the fracking is as safe as it is and so we've you know advocates for fracking like you and I and advocates for development of our natural resources have to keep trying to reassure people that in fact this is a scientific process that can be done and is done very safely around the world that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the yeas relevant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
