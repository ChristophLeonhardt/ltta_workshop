1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:04,461
This is a polar bear’s life,

2
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:09,099
and this is a polar bear’s life,

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,374
and this, too, is a 
polar bear’s life.

4
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:14,908
They’re all wearing 
collars with

5
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,525
cameras and 
accelerometers —

6
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,714
like Fitbits for bears.

7
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:22,220
Researchers at the 
U.S. Geological Survey

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,858
have put these collars on a
number of bears so they

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,790
can match accelerometer 
patterns with activities,

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,673
like walking or swimming.

11
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,008
And as a side benefit, 
the cameras caught life

12
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:40,924
from a bear’s point of view.

13
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:44,445
Killing a seal when they’re 
out on the ice.

14
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,456
Eating berries when they’re 
stuck on land.

15
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:52,698
Socializing with a 
possible mate.

16
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:54,780
Once they have the
collars calibrated,

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,078
they can track the bears 
for long periods of time.

18
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:01,199
And they can see how their 
activity and energy use

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,543
changes as the climate 
warms and sea ice declines.

20
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:08,769
For now, we get a glimpse 
of what bears

21
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,350
are seeing 
and perhaps thinking.

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,384
“Is this the bear I want to

23
00:01:14,384 --> 00:00:00,000
cuddle with on an 
Arctic night?”
