JONATHAN: ONE HOUR FIVE MINUTES 
AWAY FROM THE PAYROLL REPORTS IN
THE UNITED STATES.
LET'S GET SOME PREMARKET MOVERS.
>> HERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU  
DON'T SAY EVERY DAY.
WE HAVE THE ITALIAN BANKS 
TRADING SHARPLY HIGHER. 
THIS INCLUDES UNICREDIT AND U --
THE COMPANY IS NOT REPORTING  
THOUGH ON THE EURO WIDE TEST  
DUTY IN JULY 29.
AND THESE BANKS ARE SADDLED WITH
A LOT OF UNDERPERFORMING DEBTS  
AND INVESTORS ARE WEIGHING ON IN
A PRETTY NEGATIVE WAY.
UGLY CHARTS.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON JULY  
29. 
STICKING WITH EUROPE, THE 
EUROPEAN CAR MAKERS WERE SEEING 
A RALLY HERE AFTER THE CHINESE  
AUTO SALES NUMBERS FOR THE MONTH
OF JUNE CAME UP STRONG. 
UP 19% ON S.U.V. STRENGTH.
WE'RE LOOKING AT DAIMLER, AND V.
-- V.W. ALL HIGHER. 
THE EUROPEAN STOCKS OVERALL 
SHARPLY.
WE HAVE THE INDEX FOR THE 
AUTOMOBILE OFFERS THE LAST YEAR 
THAT HEADS DOWN SHARPLY SHOWING 
THAT UNDERPERFORMANCE.
ANOTHER WAIT AND SEE. 
LASTLY HERE IN THE U.S., A.M.G. 
GETTING HIT IN THE MARKET.
ANALYSTS WENT UNDERPERFORM BUT  
HE HAS MISSED THE BIG A.M.D.  
RALLY THIS YEAR.
LET'S TAKE THIS CALL WITH A 
GRAIN OF SALT, ALIX.
ALIX: COMING UP, WE HAVE THE  
LATEST ON THE BREAKING NEWS OUT 
OF DALLAS WHERE FIVE POLICE 
OFFICERS WERE KILLED. 
AND THEN BACK TO MARKETS. 
OUR JOB DAY COVERAGE. 
HOW WILL WAGE GROWTH BE 
IMPACTED? 
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
JONATHAN: FROM A BEAUTIFUL CITY 
OF LONDON THINKS BLOOMBERG. 
I'M JONATHAN FERRO. 
AND IT IS OFFICIAL THERMOMETER  
POUND IS THE WORST PERFORMING 
CURRENCY THIS YEAR, WORST THAN  
THE ARGENTINE PESO. 
WE TRADE ON 1.2971. 
HERE'S THE SCOREBOARD.
FUTURES IN THE U.S. FIRM. 
UP .2%. 
DOW FUTURES UP .2%. 
IN LONDON, WE'RE UP AROUND 10,  
11 POINTS.
THE D'BACKS AND EQUITY MARK.
SWITCH UP THE BOARD QUICKLY 
THROUGH THE OTHERS A SIT  
CLASSES.
EURO DOLLAR, UP.
DOLLAR YEN, VERY CLOSE TO THAT  
100 MARK. 
A FOURTH STRAIGHT DAY OF  
DECLINE.
A STRONGER JAPANESE YEN.
YIELDS UNCHANGED OUT OF 10 YEAR 
OFF FULL-TIME LOADS.
WE TRIED AT 1.38% IN THE U.S. 
10-YEAR YIELD.
THAT'S THE SITUATION IN THE 
MARKETS.
LET'S GET TO THE LATEST 
SITUATION IN DALLAS, TEXAS. 
HERE ARE SOME OF THE HEADLINES. 
>> THANK YOU, JOHN. 
IT WAS A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION 
IN DALLAS BUT IT TURNED DEADLY  
FOR POLICE. 
SNIPERS KILLED FIVE POLICE  
OFFICERS AND WOUNDED SIX OTHERS.
THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE AS  
DEMONSTRATORS DEMONSTRATED  
RECENT POLICE SHOOTING IN BLACK 
MEN.
DAVID BROWN CALLED IT AN AMBUSH.
>> THESE SUSPECTS WERE  
POSITIONING THEMSELVES TO 
TRIANGULATE ON THESE OFFICERS 
FROM TWO DIFFERENT PURCHASE IN  
GARAGES IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. 
AND PLANNED TO INJURE AND KILL  
AS MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
AS THEY COULD.
>> THREE SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED. 
A FOURTH WAS HOLD UP IN A 
PARKING GARAGE IN DOWNTOWN  
DALLAS EXCHANGING GUNFIRE WITH  
POLICE. 
THE SUSPECT SHOT HIMSELF BUT  
THAT COULDN'T BE CONFIRMED. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA DISCUSSED THE 
ATTACK WHILE ATTENDING A NATO 
CONFERENCE IN WARSAW. 
>> THERE'S NO POSSIBLE  
JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE KINDS OF
ATTACKS OR ANY VIOLENCE AGAINST 
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THE F.B.I. IS ALREADY IN TOUCH  
WITH THE DALLAS POLICE AND  
ANYONE INVOLVED IN THESE  
SENSELESS MURDERS WILL BE HELD  
FULLY ACCOUNTABLE.
JUSTICE WILL BE DONE. 
>> DALLAS POLICE SAY NO 
EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN FOUND AFTER
AN EXTENSIVE SWEEP OF DOWNTOWN. 
STILL THEY'RE URGING PEOPLE TO  
AVOID THE AREA TODAY. 
IN TAIWAN, A TYPHOON HAS KILLED 
AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE AND FORCED  
THOUSANDS TO BE EVACUATED.
THE TYPHOON MADE LANDFALL ON THE
ISLAND'S EASTERN COAST. 
WINDS WERE AS HIGH AS 100 MILES 
AN HOUR.
AT LEAST 15,000 PEOPLE FLED 
THEIR HOMES.
NORTH KOREA IS CALLING NEW U.S. 
SANCTIONS ON ITS LEADER A 
DECLARATION OF WAR. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE U.S. HAS
IMPOSED FINANCIAL SANCTIONS ON  
KIM JONG-UN HIMSELF AND OTHER 
TOP OFFICIALS FOR WIDE SPREAD 
HUMAN RIGHTS THE SANCTIONS MAKE 
IT HARDER FOR BANKS TO MAKE IT  
HARDER TO HOLD HIS ASSETS.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY IN 
MORE THAN 120 COUNTRIES.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
DAVID?
DAVID: THANKS.
THIS MORNING'S MUST-READ IS A 
MUST WATCH. 
TOM KEENE JOINS US FROM 
BLOOMBERG RADIO.
WE'RE WAITING FOR JOBS TO COME  
OUT AN HOUR FROM NOW BECAUSE OF 
WHAT IT MIGHT TELL THE FED AND  
WHAT IT MIGHT DO. 
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT MARK HAD TO 
SAY ABOUT THE FED.
>> WE THINK THE FED WILL BE ON  
HOLD FOR SEVERAL MORE MONTHS. 
WE DO THINK THEY WANT TO GET OFF
ZERO THE PROBABILITY OF THEM  
HIKING AS HIGHER THAN WHAT THE  
MARKET'S PRICED IN. 
RIGHT NOW, THE MARKET IS PRICE  
IN AT 10%.
CHANCE THEY'LL RAISE RATE THIS  
CAREER AND DOESN'T HAVE THE FED 
MOVING UNTIL 2018.
WE THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO
PESSIMISTIC THAT THE ECONOMY IS 
DOING BETTER THAN THAT. 
DAVID: SO TOM, I THINK THAT'S 
PROBABLY CONSENSUS IN THE LOOK  
AT WIRF THE TERMINAL, IT DOESN'T
ANTICIPATE MUCH OF A RISE AND 
THE FED COMING UP ANY TIME SOON.
TOM: IT'S TOTAL CHAOS HERE RIGHT
NOW.
AND HE NAILS IT.
THEY'RE THE IDEA OF WHERE THE 
MARKET IS, WHERE THE EXPERTS  
ARE, WHERE THE FED IS IS ONE BIG
JUMBLE. 
DAVID: IF YOU GO OVER THE LAST  
FEW MONTHS WHEN THE FED HAS 
DISAGREED WITH THE MARKETS, THE 
FED HAS COME TO THE MARKET. 
HE'S NOW SAYING NONETHELESS,  
THAT THE MARKET MAY BE WRONG. 
TOM: BUT THE KEY THING IS A TIME
FUNCTION OUT TO 2017 AND 2018.
MOST PROS AND THIS HAS HAPPEN 
OFEREDE THE LAST 10 YEARS,  
DAVID, PEOPLE USED TO MAKE GRAND
18-MONTHS PROJECTIONS.
THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY IN THE 
GAME. 
THE GAME IS WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT MEETING OR 
MAYBE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE
SEPTEMBER MEETING AND THEN YOU  
GO ON YEAR END. 
MOST PROS ARE NOT LOOKING OUT NO
AN ANALYSIS OF 2018.
DAVID: IT'S TOO FAR TO LOOK.
BUT YOU HAD SOMEONE ON  
"SURVEILLANCE." 
YOU HAD THE MARK GILBERT PIECE  
WHICH WAS FASCINATING SAYING  
MAYBE A RISE IN THE RATES WOULD 
HELP GROWTH.
TOM: SETH MASTERS SAID IT TO  
THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION 
WHICH IS BRILLIANT. 
I REALLY EMPHASIZE TO PEOPLE TO 
READ MARK GILBERT'S PIECE OUT 
TODAY.
I'LL PUT IT OUT ON SOCIAL.
AND THE IDEA IS IF EVERYBODY  
RAISES RATES TOGETHER, WHAT 
WOULD BE THE OUTCOME? 
THIS IS THE RING FISHER WHO IS  
CONSIDERED THE GIANTS.
AND THE BELIEVE IN IT IS A  
BELIEF BASED ON VERY LITTLE 
EXPERIMENT AND VERY LITTLE DATA.
AND AS PROFESSOR BOWEDER SAID,  
THERE'S A REAL QUESTION OF  
WHETHER IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IF
WE ALL RAISED RATES BECAUSE OF  
CAPITAL INVESTMENT WAS STOPPED. 
DAVID: ALTHOUGH IT HAD TO DO  
WITH DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE 
EXTENT-TO-WHICH THE GRADES -- 
TOM: YOU PUT ME IN THERE. 
DAVID: THEY WOULD HAVE MORE 
MONEY TO SPEND IF YOU RAISED  
RATES.
TOM: YES. 
THE FAVORS DO BETTER AND IT 
WORKS BOTH WAYS BUT THERE'S THIS
WORD, AMBIGUOUS.
THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIGUOUS  
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
MICROECONOMICS OF THESE KINDS OF
THEORIES. 
HERE'S THE THEORY.
THE NUMBERS COME AT 8:30 AND THE
MARKETS WILL REACT. 
IT'S A LIVE JOBS REPORT.
DAVID: WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.
THANKS VERY MUCH, TOM KEENE FOR 
JOINING US FROM "SURVEILLANCE"  
RADIO.
YOU'LL WANT TO TUNE IN EVERY  
MORNING FOR "BLOOMBERG  
SURVEILLANCE" RADIO WITH TOM  
KEENE AND MIKE MCKEE. 
ALIX: WE ARE AN HOUR AWAY FROM  
THAT ALL IMPORTANT JOBS NUMBER. 
HOW ABOUT 175,000 JOBS TO BE  
CREATED IN JUNE?
THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT STANDISH 
IS EXPECTING. 
VINCENT REINHART JOINS US.
THERE'S 175K PUT THE RATE HIKE  
BACK IN PLAY? 
VINCENT: PROBABLY.
SO REMEMBER TWO THINGS ABOUT THE
JOB NUMBER. 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT
OF A STICKER SHOCK BECAUSE  
35,000 WORKERS ARE GOING TO BE  
COMING BACK FROM THE VERIZON  
STRIKE. 
WE KNEW IT WAS SUBTRACTING FROM 
THE MAY TOTAL BUT PEOPLE STILL  
GOT IMPRESSED AT HOW LOW THAT 
NUMBER WAS. 
THE SECOND THING IS THE REACTION
PROBABLY GOING TO BE ASYMMETRIC.
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A STRONG 
ENOUGH NUMBER THAT PUTS THE FED 
BACK IMMEDIATELY INTO PLAY. 
175,000 IN THAT VICINITY WILL 
GET PEOPLE TO PRICE OUT POLICY  
EASING THIS YEAR AND START  
TALKING ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER 
MEETING.
BUT ONLY BE TALK. 
ALIX: BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO  
BE THAT WOULD PUT THE FED HIKE  
NOT ON THE TABLE WAS A BAD MAY  
JOBS NUMBER.
SO WE GET A GOOD JUNE JOB 
NUMBER. 
HOW DOES THE FED NOT BEING  
BEHIND THE CURVE? 
VINCENT: THREE THINGS.
THE FIRST, THEY WERE WORRIED  
ABOUT THE U.K. REFERENDUM.
THAT'S PASSED.
SO IT WASN'T JUST JOBS THAT KEPT
THEM OFF THE TABLE. 
AND THE WORST CASE EVENTUATED.
SO THEY MIGHT SAY THERE IS A LOT
OF UNCERTAINITY.
SECOND, REMEMBER WHAT JANET 
YELLEN SAID AND THAT IS DON'T 
OVERCOUNT ONE NUMBER. 
PEOPLE WILL SAY THIS IS A 
BACKWARD LOOKING READING ON 
WHERE WE WERE IN JUNE.
LOTS OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED  
SINCE.
NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO NEED A  
COUPLE MORE READINGS TO 
ESTABLISH THAT THERE'S A  
MOMENTUM IN THE ECONOMY.
THIRD, GO BACK TO WHAT JANET  
YELLEN WAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE
WAY BACK INTO HER PHILADELPHIA  
SPEECH AND HER PRESS CONFERENCE.
SHE LIKES TO SEE JOB CREATION ON
THE ORDER OF WHAT WE SAW EARLIER
THIS YEAR AND IN 2015.
THAT WAS 200,000 NET JOBS 
CREATED PER MONTH.
THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH HURDLE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A BIT TO BE  
CONVINCED THAT THE ECONOMY HAS  
MOMENTUM. 
JONATHAN: I WANT TO GO ALL THE  
WAY BACK TO THE PREVIOUS  
TIGHTENING CYCLE WHERE WE SAW 
THE 50,000 AND YET THE FEDS WENT
AHEAD AND HIKED RATES.
WHY THE OVERWHELMING BIAS TO  
VIEW THESE SMALL JOB NUMBERS AS 
BAD AT A TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE 
REACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT AND  
JOBS GROWTH SHOULD BE SHIFTING? 
WHY IS THIS THE BEST THING? 
VINCENT: SO I DON'T GET IT  
EITHER, BUT YOU DON'T REALLY  
CARE ABOUT MY OPINION AND WHAT  
THEY SHOULD DO. 
IT'S WHAT I THINK THEY'LL DO. 
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING IT'S THE 
CON JUNK CHER BEING THIS CLOSE  
TO THE LOWER BOUND. 
AND KEEP THE EXPANSION GOING  
THAN OVERTIGHTEN TOO SOON 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE 
POLICY INSTRUMENTS YOU'RE 
CONFIDENT IN IF YOU TIGHTEN TOO 
QUICKLY.
JONATHAN: I CAUGHT UP WITH THE  
PRESIDENT IN LONDON AND HE'S  
WORRIED ABOUT FRESH CREDIBILITY.
A MARKET THAT'S PRICED OUT ANY  
FED ACTION FOR THE NEXT TWO 
YEARS.
THEY TELL US THAT WE STILL  
DEBATE WHICH DATA IT IS AND WE  
DO THAT MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER 
MONTH.
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A BIG 
CREDIBILITY PROBLEM DOWN IN D.C.
AT THE FED? 
VINCENT: THERE IS A PROBLEM.
IT GOES BACK TO THE DEEP WATERS 
THAT TOM KEENE AND COMPANY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT.
I'M NOT SURE IT'S CHAOS YET BUT 
IT'S CONCERNING.
AND THAT IS WE'RE SEEING THE END
OF POLICY GUIDANCE AS AN  
EFFECTIVE TOOL, I.E.,, CONVEYING
THE WHOLE PATH OF FUTURE POLICY 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS 
AND USING THAT AS AN INSTRUMENT.
WHY?
BECAUSE THE WORLD'S TOO 
UNCERTAIN TO MAKE CREDIBLE  
COMMITMENTS.
SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE, LET ALONE
A YEAR AND A HALF IN ADVANCE. 
SO THEY ARE GOING MEETING BY  
MEETING IN THEIR POLICY 
DECISIONS.
PROBLEM IS THEY'RE STILL  
PUBLICING A SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC 
PROJECTIONS THAT TELLS YOU THE  
WHOLE FUTURE PATH FOR INTEREST  
RATE, CONDITIONAL AS IT IS. 
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T 
REALLY KNOW WHAT THE TERMINAL 
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS, HOWEVER  
THIS TIGHTENING CYCLE WILL END. 
AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ARE 
DAMAGING TO THE CREDIBILITY, THE
FED.
THAT'S WHY THEY KEEP ON 
EMPHASIZING DATA. 
PROBLEM IS THE DOT CHART, THE 
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROJECTION  
IS HAUNTING THEM. 
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME. 
IT'S LESS GOOD NOW. 
DAVID: MR. BULLARD PUT OUT THERE
THAT WE SHOULD STOP MAKING  
PROJECTIONS TOO FAR UP BECAUSE  
THEY COULDN'T KNOW IT.
HAS ANYONE PICKED UP ON THAT? 
I WAS SURPRISED THERE'S NOT MORE
OF A REACTION.
VINCENT: IF YOU GO BACK TO THE  
TRANSCRIPTS, ONE THING YOU'LL 
SEE EVERY TIME THE F1C TALKED 
ABOUT A COMMUNICATIONS POLICY 
AND IT WAS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER 
OF THOSE SUBCOMMITTEES AND  
SECRETARY ECONOMISTS, AND THEY  
ALWAYS SAY IF WE DO SOMETHING TO
ENHANCE COMMUNICATION, WE CAN 
NEVER GO BACK.
AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL  
THAT THEY'VE RAISE THIRD BAR ON 
WHAT THEY RELEASED AND TAKING 
SOMETHING BACK SEEMS  
UNDEMOCRATIC. 
IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, TO CHANGE 
THE DIRECTION OF PROGRESS AND 
TRANSPARENCY. 
SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE 
TO TAKE THAT AWAY UNLESS THEY 
FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER WAY TO DO.
ALIX: SEEMS TO BE LIKE YOU WANT 
TO KILL THE DOT.
VINCENT REINHART, GREAT TO SEE  
YOU.
STANDISH CHIEF ECONOMIST. 
LOTS OF JOB DAY COVERAGE COMING 
UP. 
JONATHAN: ABSOLUTELY. 
WE'LL CONTINUE THAT COVERAGE  
RIGHT HERE ON BLOOMBERG.
AHEAD, RICK REED ERR BREAKING 
DOWN THE -- RID RIEDER BREAKING 
DOWN THEA AND BILL GROSS WILL 
JOIN BLOOMBERG TV AND BLOOMBERG 
RADIO FROM LONDON AND NEW YORK. 
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
DAVID: THIS IS "BLOOMBERG GO."
I'M DAVID WESTIN. 
COUNCIL ECONOMIC ADVISORS JASON 
FURMAN JOINING US FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE LIVE. 
â™ª
>> LONDON AND NEW YORK, THIS IS 
BLOOMBERG.
ABOUT ONE HOUR 45 MINUTES AWAY  
FROM THE CASH OPENING IN NEW  
YORK CITY.
THIS IS HOW FUTURES ARE TRADING 
AHEAD OF THE JOBS REPORTS.
FUTURES FIRM FOR THE U.S. 
EQUITIES RALLYING AS WELL.
WITH ECONOMISTS FORECASTING A 
STRONG BOUNCEBACK FROM AN UGLY  
MAY JOBS REPORT.
JUNE SET TO COME IN AT 180K.
JOINING ME IS KEN.
TO SET THE SCENE, WE'VE GOT A 
FED AND A MARKET THAT SAYS NO,  
NO, NO FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.
WE LIVE IN THIS POST-BREXIT 
WORLD WHERE YIELDS ARE LOW. 
AND YOU SIT THERE WITNESSING THE
FUNDS FLOW. 
AND I WANT YOU TO TELL US WHAT  
THE MONEY HAS BEEN MOVING IN THE
LAST THREE WEEKS. 
>> MONEY HAS BEEN MOVING  
SOMEWHAT OUT OF THE EUROPEAN  
EQUITIES. 
BUT NOT A TON.
U.S. EQUITIES HAS BEEN STABLE.
JONATHAN: WHAT DO THE BOND FUNDS
FLOW LOOK LIKE? 
ARE THEY TRYING TO GET SOME 
PICKUP? 
KEN: THEY'RE GOING MORE TO THE  
YIELD TO GET SOME CREDIT SPREAD 
IN THERE. 
SO THEY'RE GOING INTO THE 
CORPORATE FUNDS, INVESTMENT 
GRADE FUNDS.
IT'S MORE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING  
THAN THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS.
JONATHAN: YOU LOOK AT EUROPEAN  
PERIPHERAL DATA.
BUT WITH TREASURIES IN MIND ON A
JOB WHERE WE GET THE LATEST 
PAYROLL REPORT, DO YOU FIND IT  
HASHED TO RECONCILE YIELDS WITH 
PAY GROWTH LESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT
SOUTH OF FIVE?
KEN: A LOT OF WHAT'S CAUSING  
YIELDS IS THE YIELDS IN THE REST
OF THE WORLD ARE SO LOW.
THERE'S CONSTANT MOVE TOWARDS 
YIELDS AND THE U.S. IS LOOKING  
FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE TO A LOT OF 
GLOBAL INVESTORS. 
JONATHAN: FOR GLOBAL INVESTORS  
LOOK INTO YOUR FUNDS, THE 
PASSIVE STORY, A LOT OF PEOPLE  
HAVE PAINTED A PICTURE THAT IT'S
ALL ABOUT COST. 
IS IT ALL ABOUT COST? 
KEN: IT'S A BIG PART OF THE MOVE
TOWARDS PASSIVE IS ABOUT COST 
BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING, THE FLOW 
HAS BEEN STRONG AND AT VANGUARD,
WE'RE SEEING A PICKUP IN ACTIVE 
FLOWS, ESPECIALLY IN FIXED  
INCOME. 
AND EVEN ON THE ACTIVE SIDE T 
ABOUT COST. 
IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY IS MOVING  
INTO THE LOWER COST ACTIVE  
FUNDS, NO THE HIGHER COST OR  
MODERATELY COST ACTIVE FUNDS. 
JONATHAN: THE STORY OVER THE  
LAST FIVE, SIX YEARS HAS BEEN 
PASSIVE OVERACTIVE. 
DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING  
FUNDAMENTALLY IN ANY WAY AS THE 
YEARS PROGRESSED? 
KEN: I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING. 
I THINK THE FLOW HAS CONTINUE TO
MOVE TOWARDS THE PASSIVE BUT THE
ACTIVE FLOW TEND TO MOVE TOWARDS
THE LOWER COST ACTIVE.
AND THAT'S THE INTERESTING STORY
GOING FORWARD IS REALLY 
INVESTORS LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE
AVERAGE EXPENSE RATIOS ON THE 
ACTIVE FUNDS THAT THOSE 
INVESTORS WHO BELIEVE IN ACTIVE 
AND HAVING A LOWER HURDLE RATE  
TO OVERCOME BY ACTUALLY LOOKING 
AT THE LOWER COST ACTIVE FUNDS. 
JONATHAN: HAVE THEY CHANGED 
THEIR CONVICTIONS TO WHERE THEY 
SEE THE WORLD SINCE THE 
REFERENDUM IN THE U.K.? 
KEN: THERE'S STILL A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY GOING FORWARD, HOW  
THE E.U. IS GOING TO WORK WITH  
THE U.K. IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING
THE EXIT. 
SO THERE'S STILL SO MUCH  
UNCERTAINTY GOING FORWARD AND 
WHAT THAT DOES IS IT CAUSES 
BUSINESSES TO REDUCE THEIR  
INVESTMENT SPENDING, CAUSES 
CONSUMERS TO PULL BACK AND BE 
CAUTIOUS, REAL ESTATE PRICES  
HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT OF A  
HIT.
AND THAT CREATES THAT KIND OF 
UNCERTAINTY THAT IS GOING TO BE 
HURTFUL TO THE U.K. ECONOMY AND 
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY. 
JONATHAN: SOMEONE IN LONDON TOLD
ME DON'T BOTHER WATCHING BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW THAT WE'VE
HAD THIS POST-BREXIT MOVE.
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
KEN: I THINK THE FED IS PROBABLY
PRICED OUT UNTIL THE END OF THE 
YEAR, DECEMBER, OR MAYBE THE  
FIRST QUARTER OF 2017.
INVESTORS DO NEED TO NEWS THESE 
KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES  
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE AND IN THE 
U.K. TO REBALANCE THEIR 
PORTFOLIO TO THE LONGER TERM  
MIX.
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO AFTER THE MARKET HAS  
DROPPED CONSIDERABLY IS TO LEAVE
THE MARKET BECAUSE THE MARKET 
HAS PRICED IN A LOT OF THAT 
NEWS. 
IT'S A GREAT TIME LIKE IN THE 
U.K. AND IN EUROPE, EQUITIES  
HAVE UNDERPERFORMED BONDS.
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO REBALANCE  
YOUR MIX BACK INTO EQUITIES AND 
BONDS TO KEEP YOUR LONGER TERM  
MIX WITH THE KIND OF RISK THAT  
YOU WANT TO TAKE AS AN INVESTOR.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU, KEN, GREAT 
TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. 
DAVID: THANKS VERY MUCH.
THAT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION.
COMING UP ON "BLOOMBERG GO,"  
U.K. HOUSING FUNDS ARE UNDER  
DURESS AND THERE MAY SEEM TO BE 
NOWHERE TO GO BUT DOWN. 
BUT IS THAT RIGHT?
WE HAVE SOME CHARTS TO TELL US. 
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
JONATHAN: FROM LONDON AND NEW 
YORK, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
38 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE PAY  
ROLLS REPORT. 
THIS IS THE SCENE IN GLOBAL 
MARKETS.
FUTURES FIRM FOR THE U.S. 
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HEADING FOR A 
WEEK OF LOSSES IN THE UNITED  
STATES AND IN EUROPE. 
THE FTSE UP.
D'BACKS AND FRANKFURT UP. 
SWITCH OF THE BOARD VERY  
QUICKLY.
HERE'S THE OTHER ASSET CLASSES  
FOR YOU.
DOLLAR YEN, CLOSE TO 100 MARK.
IT'S THE STRONGER JAPANESE YEN  
STORY.
THE CABLE RATE STABLE AROUND  
12979.
AND YIELDS ALL-TIME LOW YIELDS  
EARLIER THIS WEEK.
WE TRADE AT 1.39%.
UNCHANGED TODAY AHEAD OF THAT 
PAYROLLS REPORT.
ALIX? 
ALIX: ONE OF THE BIG STORIES OUT
OF THE U.K. THIS WEEK HAD TO BE 
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE U.K. 
PROPERTY FUNDS SEIZING UP AND 
HALTING SOME REDEMPTION.
CREDIT SUISSE SAYS THERE IS MORE
DOWNSIDE FOR THE OPEN-ENDED 
FUNDS.
CLOSE-END FUNDS LIMIT AMOUNT OF 
SHARES. 
THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  
THE TWO.
PREREDEMPTION.
THIS BLUE LINE ARE CLOSE-ENDED  
FUNDS.
THEY HAD ABOUT 20% DECLINE. 
THIS ORANGE LINE ARE OPEN-ENDED 
FUNDS.
THOSE ARE THE GUYS THAT HATTED  
THE REDEMPTIONS AND THEY HAD  
ABOUT A 5% DECLINE BEFORE THE 
SUSPENSIONS.
POINT BIGS IN ORDER FOR THE OPEN
ENDED TO CATCH UP WITH THEIR  
PEERS, THERE HAS TO BE A LOT  
MORE DOWNSIZE.
AND THE 15% MORE DOWNSIDE TO GET
TO THAT LEVEL.
IN ADDITION, COME OF THE  
CLOSED-END FUNDS THAT WE HAVE 
BEEN SEEING ARE TRADING AT  
SEVERE DISCOUNTS TO THEIR NET 
ASSET VALUE.
WE CAN PULL THIS OTHER CHART. 
SO THIS WHITE LINE HERE IS U.K. 
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TRUST FUND. 
IT IS A CLOSED END FUND AND THIS
BLUE LINE IS COMMERCIAL PROPERTY
TRUST, ALSO A CLOSED-END FUND.
THIS IS ZERO. 
WHEN THEY WIND UP CLOSING ABOVE 
THAT LEVEL, IT MEANS THEY'RE  
TRADING A PREMIUM, MEANING A  
PREMIUM TO THE ASSETS THAT THEY 
HAVE IN THAT FUND.
NOW BELOW ZERO, THEY'RE LOOKING 
AT A DISCOUNT WHERE ARE THEY  
SHOWING NOW?
A PRETTY SEVERE DISCOUNT TO THE 
UNDERLYING ASSET. 
SO JOHN, CREDIT SUISSE'S POINT  
IS OPEN-ENDED FUNDS HAVE A LOT  
MORE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE IF  
THEY'RE GOING TO MATCH THE  
DOWNSIDE WE'VE SEEN IN THE  
CLOSE-ENDED FUNDS.
A TOPIC WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
ALL WEEK. 
JONATHAN: ONE OF THE BIG  
APPEARINGLE IS THE DIFFERING  
APPROACHES FROM INDIVIDUAL FUNDS
ABOUT HOW THE HANDLING THE  
REDEMPTION STORY. 
ABERDEEN FOR INSTANCE, TELLING  
INVESTORS THERE COULD BE 24 
HOURS I'M GOING LET YOU DECIDE  
WHETHER YOU WANT TO TAKE THE  
WRITE-OFF OR REALIZE THE LOSS 
AND PULL YOUR MONEY OUT AND 
THAT'S FINE.
OTHER FUNDS SAYING 28 DAYS AND  
THEN RECONSIDER.
SO ALL THESE DIFFERENT FUNDS  
WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN  
TERMS OF HOW THEY HANDLE THE  
REDEMPTIONS.
ALIX: IMACCUMULATIONS FOR 
INVESTERS AND FOR BANKS WHO 
MIGHT HOLD THESE UNDERLYING 
LOANS AS WELL.
DAVID, WE SAW A LOT OF THIS IN  
2008 AND 2009 WHEN THE MORTGAGE 
CRISIS HIT. 
THE TRICKLE DOWN WAS SELLING  
GETS SELLING. 
YOU SELL CELSKI WHAT YOU CAN, 
NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO. 
DAVID: WE HAVE NOT SEEN IS  
ACTUAL PRICES FOR REAL ESTATE 
GOING DOWN. 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS  
TRICKLES THROUGH THE ACTUAL 
AMOUNT OF MONEY PEOPLE ARE  
PAYING IN A REAL ESTATE IN THE  
U.K. WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN YET.
ALIX: WE HAVE ESTIMATES FROM 20%
DECLINE IN THOSE UNDERLYING REAL
ESTATE ASSETS.
DAVID: FOR OFFICE RENTS.
20% DOWN. 
ALIX: YEAH. 
DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE'RE GOING
TO BE KEEPING OUR EYE ON AS THE 
BREXIT FALLOUT CONTINUES. 
DAVID: THANKS.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD. 
THE LATEST ON THE BREAKING NEWS 
OUT OF DALLAS WHERE FIVE POLICE 
OFFICERS WERE KILLED. 
PLUS, WE ARE AWAITING THE PAY 
ROLLS NUMBER. 
WE GET REACTION FROM THE JUNE 
JOBS REPORT FROM BILL GROSS.
AND LATER, RICK RIEDER, 
BLACKROCK C.I.O. WILL BE WITH US
IN NEW YORK.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
DAVID: COUNTDOWN TO PAYROLL.
DAVID:EXCITED TO BOUNCE BACK
FROM AN UGLY MAY.
ANYTHING SET OUT THE REST OF
2015? 
>> TROUBLED ASSETS GROW OVER
INSTABILITY IN THE ITALIAN
GOVERNMENT.
STATE INTERVENTION CANNOT BE
RULED OUT.
VONNIE: FIVE POLICE OFFICERS ARE
KILLED AFTER SNIPERS OPENED FIRE
ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE HEART
OF DALLAS.
â™ª
DAVID: WELCOME TO THE SECOND
HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG ." 
WE WILL LOOK AT THE TELESTRATING
SHORTLY.
I HAVE ALIX STEEL AND JONATHAN
FERRO HERE WITH ME.
WE ARE 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM U.S.
JOBS DATA, AND THAT IS THE BIG
FOCUS.
JONATHAN: RIGHT AFTER THOSE
NUMBERS ARE OUT, WE WILL HAVE
NUMBERS ON ON THE PROGRAM TO
BREAK DOWN WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE
FED.
BETTY: -- 
ALIX: THE CEO OF A COMPANY WILL
BE HERE WITH US.
TRADERS DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP
POSITIONS HERE.
JONATHAN: FUTURES ARE FIRMER, UP
0.2% IN THE U.S. 
THE, LONDON DOING GOOD.
ALMOST 1.5% ON THE DAX.
WE HAD FOR A WEEK OF LOSSES FOR
EUROPE AND THE U.S. 
SWITCHING UP VERY QUICKLY, HERE
ARE THE OTHER ASSET CLASSES.
THE FX MARKET, DOLLAR-YEN, WE
BROKE THE 100 MARK.
WILLIE DO THAT AGAIN IN ABOUT 30
MINUTES TIME, I WILL GET THAT,
1.45.
IT IS A STRONGER JAPANESE YEN
FOR A STRONGER DAY.
1.39% FOR METALS, AND CRUDE
POTENTIALLY THE BIGGEST DROP IN
THE YEAR.
ALIX: UNBELIEVABLE.
WE ARE 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE
JUNE JOBS REPORT, AND WE HAVE
TEAM COVERAGE.
WE HAVE THE CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST
FROM BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE,
RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICHAEL
MCKEE.
FIRST OF ALL, THE NUMBERS,
PREDICTION? 
>> THE FORECAST IS 180,000.
WALL STREET IS LEADING A LITTLE
STRONGER.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS --
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SKEW OF THE
FORECAST.
IT DOES POINT TOWARDS A BELIEF
AMONG ECONOMISTS WE MIGHT BE
STRONGER.
ALIX: PART OF THAT NOT JUST
POTENTIAL PAYBACKS BUT VERIZON
WORKERS COMING BACK FROM STRIKE.
YOU HAVE TO COUNT JUST
DISCOUNTED 35,000 FROM THAT
NUMBER.
>> WE SHOULD HAVE ADDED 35
NUMBERS TO GET A CLEANER READER,
BUT IT IS STILL A LOUSY NUMBER
FOR MAY.
HE SAID SUBTRACT 35,000 FROM THE
JUNE RESULT.
I AM CONCERNED WE COULD BE ON
THE SOFTER SIDE OF THINGS.
THE BLS COULD BE VERY SEASONAL,
AND THE MORE TYPICAL SEASONAL IN
MAY, WE WOULD'VE HAD WEAKER
NUMBERS.
THERE IS A PENCHANT FOR WEAKER
NUMBERS TO PERVADE THE LABOR
DATA, NOT ONLY INJURED WITH
DAVID: THE NEXT COUPLE OF
MONTHS.
DAVID:DO NUMBERS TEND TO BE
WEAK.
>> THERE IS A MILD MOP BIAS.
IT IS OUR TO ADJUST FOR THE
BACK-TO-SCHOOL SEASON WHEN
PEOPLE MOVE IN AND OUT.
ALIX: THE OTHER PART IS WAGES,
EXPECTATIONS OF 2.7%.
THIS LOOKS TAX WITHHOLDING
RECEIPTS.
YOU PAY MORE MONEY TO THE
GOVERNMENT, THINKING -- THANK
YOU FOR MAKING THIS CHART.
IF I CAN ZOOM IN OVER THE LAST
FEW MONTHS, YOU SEE IT INCREASE.
IS THAT SUSTAINABLE? 
>> IT IS IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE
PEOPLE GET JOBS.
ON THE BASIS, THE NUMBERS ARE
WORRIED -- RUNNING WEAKER.
THE NUMBERS ARE MET MATCHING UP.
JUST NOT MATCHING UP.
ARE WE REALLY SEEN PEOPLE GET
HIRED OR NOT? 
IT IS NOT A PERFECT CORRELATION,
BUT IT DOES TELL YOU SOMETHING.
ALIX: IF THE WAGE INCREASES AND
THE TAX WITHHOLDING ARE THE
MINIMUM WAGES, AT SOME POINT,
THAT JUICE IS GOING TO WEAR OUT.
>> I THINK IT IS HAPPENING
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM, AS WE ARE
SEEING LABOR SCARCITY IN AN
ARRAY OF FIELDS, ESPECIALLY
HIGHER SKILLED OPENINGS.
SO I THINK THAT WILL BEGET MORE
WAGE PRESSURES.
WAGE PRESSURES ARE CRITICAL TO
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE JOBS
REPORT.
WE ALWAYS JOKE, THIS IS
IMPORTANT, BUT THIS ONE REALLY
IS.
I WOULD THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
DATA POINT IN THE LAST SIX
MONTHS, BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE
PACE OF HIRING DWINDLING NOT
JUST IN MAY BUT OVER A SUSTAINED
TIME.
THERE IS REAL QUESTIONS, IS THIS
DUE TO ECONOMIC WEAKNESS OR A
MORE MATURE ECONOMY? 
IF IT IS THE ECONOMY, YOU NEED
TO SEE WAGE PRESSURE
ACCOMPANYING IT.
DAVID: FUNNY UP THE AVERAGE
NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED OR WEEK,
WE TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY TIME
AND YOU NOTE A .1% VARIANCE IN
THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS
WORKED WOULD BE THE SAME AS HOW
MANY JOBS? 
>> OVER 300,000.
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE PAYROLL GAIN
INTO BROADER CONTEXT OF WHAT IT
MEANS FOR HOURS WORKED AND
AGGREGATE INCOME.
IT TELLS US ABOUT GDP GROWTH FOR
THE QUARTER AND HOUSEHOLD
INCOME.
DAVID: MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT? 
>> THE HEADLINE NUMBER FOR ALL
THE REASONS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT.
JANET YELLEN MADE IT A BIG DEAL
ABOUT MINORITY UNEMPLOYMENT AND
MINORITY EARNINGS.
SHE LET OFF HER TESTIMONY LAST
MONTH WITH THAT.
AFRICAN EMPLOYMENT DOUBLED THE
WHITE RATE, AND IT HAS NOT COME
DOWN AS FAST AS IT HAS FOR
WHITES.
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER
OR NOT THAT MOVES A
SIGNIFICANTLY, BECAUSE IT MAY
SUGGEST HER BIAS SUPPORTS ITSELF
LONGER.
DAVID: SHE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION
ABOUT THE INABILITY TO GET THE
NUMBER DOWN.
>> IT IS A TOOL, BUT SHE CAN
KEEP RATES LOWER.
DAVID: THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO
THE CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR
BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE AND MIKE
MCKEE.
ALONGSIDE TOM KEENE,
INTERVIEWING THE CAPITAL FUND
MANAGER AFTER THE NUMBERS COME
OUT.
ALIX: WHAT IT MEANS FOR STOCKS,
WE HAVE THE CITIGROUP CHIEF U.S.
EQUITY STRATEGIST.
GOOD TO SEE YOU ON THIS SHOW ON
FRIDAY.
THE S&P, A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
TODAY.
WE ARE NEAR RECORD HIGHS.
WHAT DO THEY HAPPEN SO THE
MARKET IF WE GET A GOOD JOB
NUMBER? 
>> IT IS SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC
EARNINGS PHENOMENON.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WAGES AND
WORKERS EARNINGS, BUT CORPORATE
EARNINGS HAVE BEEN STUBBORNLY
HIGH.
THEY HAVE NOT GONE HIGHER, OR
LOWER IN THE LAST 18, 21 MONTHS.
YOU WONDER WHY THE STOCK MARKET
IS NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS, BECAUSE
EARNINGS ARE NEAR ALL-TIME
HIGHS.
IT THERE IS A STRONG CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE TWO FACTORS.
IF YOU START TO BELIEVE THERE IS
A BETTER ECONOMY, YOU OUGHT
UNDERSTAND BETTER EARNINGS AND
THERE IS A POSITIVE TREND.
ALIX: IT SEEMS THE MARKET IS
PRICING AN OK JOB NUMBER, AND
THEN A DIMINISHED FED.
IF WE WANT A KILLER NUMBER, DOES
THAT FOR THE RATE HIKE BACK ON
THE TABLE? 
>> I HATE INTERRUPTING, BUT A
SINGLE DATA POINT WILL NOT
CHANGE THE FED'S MIND, AND I
DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD
PROCEED AS THE ULTIMATE -- I GET
VERY NERVOUS JUST FOCUSING ON A
SINGLE NUMBER.
IT BECOMES VERY TOPICAL, ON THE
GIVEN DAY, WE HAD A VERY POOR
NUMBER REPORTED FOR THE MAY
JOBS.
AND YET, THE STANDARD DEVIATION
OF REVISIONS ULTIMATELY ARE
ABOUT 100,000 IN A GIVEN MONTH.
IF YOU HAD 60 SOMETHING THOUSAND
, AND IN 160,000 WILL WE LOOK AT
THEM TO YEARS LATER, THE STREET
REACTS TO THE NEWS.
STRATEGISTS SAID BACK AND SAY,
ONE DATA POINT IS NOT GOING TO
CHANGE MY VIEW ONE DAY OR
ANOTHER.
ALIX: 
>> IT DOES NOT EXTEND TO VIEWERS
OF ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THOUGHTFUL
ABOUT IT.
DAVID: MY COLLEAGUE POINTS UP
THE FED REPEATEDLY SAID THE DATA
IS DEPENDENT.
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
DEPENDING ON.
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS
CONFUSION.
IS THAT PART OF THE FED'S FAULT
IN THE CLARITY OF THEIR
EXPRESSION, OR ARE THEY
CONFUSING DATA, PLAYING THE HAND
THAT DEALT THEM? 
>> THERE IS GREAT UMBRAGE WHEN
THE FED IS CRITIQUED BY MANY
PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACTUALLY LOOK
AT AS MUCH DATA AS THE 20 --
2000 PHD'S WHO WORK IN THE FED.
I CAN'T SIT THERE AND SAY THEY
ARE MAKING COSTLY MISTAKES.
THE FED STRUCTURE, OR YOU HAVE
THESE DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS IN
DIFFERENT CITIES WHO HAVE THE
ABILITY TO SPEAK THEIR MIND, AND
THEY ARE NOT SPEAKING FOR THE
FED, BUT THEMSELVES, THEY CREATE
CAUTION AND COMMUNICATION.
DIFFERENT VOICES ARE HEARD IN
THE FOC MEETINGS AS WELL, THE
CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIR GET A
CONSENSUS MESSAGE OUT.
ONE THING IS REALLY CONFUSING
WHEN THE FED TALKS ABOUT DATA IS
THIS IDEA OF MARKET DEPENDENCY,
ALSO.
IT IS PART OF THE DATA THEY
WATCH BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT FEEDBACK LOOPS.
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE.
IN JANUARY, ONE OF THE WORST
POINTS, EARLY FEBRUARY, 40% OF
THE S&P 500 NAMES, 200 OUT OF
500, MORE DOWN -- WERE DOWN 45%.
IMAGINE YOUR STOCK IS DOWN 35%
TO 45%, YOU THINK THE WORLD IS
ENDING, YOU CUT BACK INVESTMENT,
DON'T HIRE AS MANY PEOPLE.
YOU WORRY ABOUT THE STOCK
MARKET.
THE FED SAYS WE UNDERSTAND
FEEDBACK LOOPS.
WE HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF
MARKETS, NOT JUST THE LABOR DATA
POINT.
ALIX: CITIGROUP U.S. EQUITY
STRATEGIST, SPEAKING WITH US.
WE'LL BE BREAKING THAT DOWN
NEXT.
FOR THE LATEST ON BREAKING NEWS
OUT OF DALLAS, TEXAS, OTHER
HEADLINES.
HERE IS, CHANDRA.
REPORTER: DOWNTOWN ZEALOTS IS A
WAR ZONE.
THEY OPENED FIRE ON POLICE CHIEF
DURING PROTESTS OF SHOOTING
BLACK MAN.
SEVEN OFFICERS WERE WOUNDED AND
FIVE WERE KILLED.
IT WAS AN AMBUSH.
>> THESE SUSPECTS WERE
PARTICIPATING IN A WAY TO
TRIANGULATE ON THESE OFFICERS
FROM TWO DIFFERENT PERCHES IN
GARAGES IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA,
AND PLANNED TO INJURE AND KILL
AS MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
AS THEY COULD.
REPORTER: POLICE HAVE ARRESTED
THREE SUSPECTS.
THEY EXCHANGED GUNFIRE WITH A
FOURTH AND OFFICIALS SAY THAT
SUSPECT IS DEAD.
PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED THE
SHOOTING A VICIOUS, CALCULATED
ATTACK ONLINE ENFORCEMENT.
RESIDENT OBAMA: THERE IS NO
POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE
KINDS OF ATTACKS OR ANY VIOLENCE
AGAINST LAW-ENFORCEMENT.
THE FBI IS ALREADY IN TOUCH WITH
THE DALLAS POLICE AND ANYONE
INVOLVED IN THESE SENSELESS
MURDERS WILL BE HELD FULLY
ACCOUNTABLE.
JUSTICE WILL BE DONE.
REPORTER: A LARGE PART OF
DOWNTOWN DALLAS IS DESIGNATED AS
A CRIME SCENE.
POLICE ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO
AVOID IT.
IN TAIWAN, A TYPHOON HAS KILLED
AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE AND FORCED
THOUSANDS TO BE EVACUATED.
IT MADE LANDFALL ON THE ISLAND'S
EASTERN COAST.
WINDS OF HIGH AS 100 MILES PER
HOUR, 60,000 PEOPLE FLED THEIR
HOMES.
AND SOUTH KOREA AND THE U.S.
HAVE AGREED TO DEPLOY A NEW
ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM.
SOUTH KOREA HAS FALLEN TO IT
GROWING MISSILE THREAT FROM
NORTH KOREA.
CHINA IS OPPOSED TO THE MOVE AND
IS URGING THE COUNTRIES TO
RECONSIDER.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY,
POWERED BY MORE THAN 2600
JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS AND
MORE THAN 120 COUNTRIES.
I AM EMMA CHANDRA, THIS IS
BLOOMBERG NEWS.
JONATHAN: WE ARE AWAITING THE
JUNE JOB REPORT.
WE WILL SEE THE FORECAST 100,000
JOBS? 
MORE THAN, AND BILL GROSS AHEAD.
FROM LONDON AND NEW YORK, THIS
IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
â™ª
JONATHAN: FROM LONDON AND NEW
YORK, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
ATTENTION TO GLOBAL MARKETS AND
15 MINUTES TIME SHIFTS TO THAT
PICTURE, D.C., AND THE LABOR
MARKET REPORT IN THE UNITED
STATES.
THE HEAD OF THAT REPORT, 50
MINUTES AWAY.
FUTURES UP 1.10% IN THE U.K.,
THE FOOTSIE UP TO PUT -- 0.2%.
THE DAX UP 1.35%.
BOTH INDEXES, THE STOXX 600 AND
THE S&P 500 HEADING FOR A WEEK
OF LOSSES.
HERE ARE THE OTHER ASSET
CLASSES.
WE TREATED THE FX MARKET, 1.29.
DOLLAR-YEN, 149.
AND ALL TIME LOWS ON THE U.S. 10
YEAR EARLIER THIS WEEK.
CRUDE, 45.53.
CITIGROUP CHIEF U.S. STRATEGIST
IS STILL WITH US IN NEW YORK.
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I QUESTION TO YOU IS, I WAS
TRYING TO GAUGE HOW THIS MARKET
WAS PRIMED.
HOW IS IT PRIMED? 
HOW DOES IT REACT TO A DOWNSIDE
SURPRISE IN THE LABOR MARKET
REPORT? 
>> I THINK STRONGER JOB NUMBERS
WILL GENERATE MORE OF A RELIEF.
MAY HAD FEARS ABOUT SLOWING, ANY
KIND OF RECOVERY FROM THAT TREND
WOULD BE POSITIVE, I BELIEVE.
IF YOU HAVE CONTINUED WEAKNESS,
PEOPLE WILL START TO DOUBT THE
STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY AND THE
ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS.
VERY STRONG WOULD PROBABLY ALSO
GENERATE SOME, IF YOU LIKE, FED
CONCERNS, BUT PEOPLE WILL TRY TO
PRICE A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF IT
LATE -- RATE HIKE LATER THIS
YEAR.
ONE PRODUCT WILL NOT GET YOU
THERE.
THE FEDERAL WANT TO SEE OTHER
THINGS.
WE LOOK AT THE BREXIT VOTE OR
THE ITALIAN BANKS, THE FED WILL
TAKE A HARSHER POSTURE.
ONE DATA POINT DOES NOT CHANGE
THAT.
JONATHAN: THE LABOR PRESIDENT
HERE LAST WEEK SAID THE BREXIT
DECISION SHOULD HAVE PRETTY MUCH
NOTHING TO ZERO IMPACT ON THE
U.S. ECONOMY.
WHY IS THERE A CONCERN FOR U.S.
EQUITIES.
I UNDERSTAND FOREIGN EARNINGS
ARE A BIG MAKEUP OF THE S&P 500,
BUT WHEN WE WOKE UP UNDER 24 AND
SAW THE S&P 500 AND CONSTITUENTS
DOWN, WAS THAT OVERDONE? 
TOBIAS: I AM NOT SURE IT HAS NO
IMPACT WITH RESPECT TO THE
EARLIER COMMENT.
I THINK IT HAS MODEST IMPACT.
EUROPE IS PROBABLY A PERCENT OF
THE S&H -- ESSEN IT P5 HUNDRED
SALES.
-- S&P 500 SALES.
FOOD, BEVERAGE, TOBACCO AM A
THEY ARE STILL TAKING THE DRUGS
THEY HAVE TO TAKE WITH RESPECT
TO THE BREXIT VOTE.
SO THE LAST ONE PRESENT MIGHT BE
CYCLICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS LET'S
SAY IT DROPS 20%, SO POINT 02%.
IT IS NOT ZERO.
THERE IS A DOMINO EFFECT.
AND THEN, IS THERE A VOTE IN
FRANCE, ITALY, SPAIN? 
EVERYBODY FREEZES.
IT WOULD NOT SAY NO IMPACT, BUT
IT IS A SECONDARY EFFECT.
THAT WAS WHAT MY POINT WAS.
DAVID: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CEO AND
WHETHER IT IS BREXIT OR WHAT THE
FED MIGHT DO OR WHAT THE
ECONOMY, OR THEIR STOCK PRICES.
THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY
FACING THE CEOS WE NEED TO GET
PAST.
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST DETERMINANT
ON DETERMINING WHETHER THEY WILL
HIRE PEOPLE OR INVEST? 
TOBIAS: ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE,
WE DID A STUDY LOOKING AT 700
COMPANIES IN THE U.S., AND
ENERGY, WE ALL KNOW ENERGY IS
DOWN.
BUT ASK ENERGY, THE AGGREGATE
CAPITAL SPENDING PLAN FOR 2015
IS UP 25%.
THAT IS HIGHER THAN WE THOUGHT
THE STUDY BACK IN FEBRUARY, UP
4%.
THE BIGGEST DRIVERS, TECHNOLOGY,
MEDIA, COMPANIES THAT HAVE TO
INVEST IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY,
RESPONDING TO OR CUTTING AND
THINGS LIKE THAT, OR IN
TECHNOLOGY, YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT CYBER SECURITY, THINGS
LIKE THAT.
DAVID: IT IS OFTEN THE PRETTY
LOW BASE.
IN THE LAST 20, 30 YEARS -- 
TOBIAS: NO.
CAPITAL SPENDING HAS BEEN
GROWING.
IT HAS BEEN GROWING EVER SINGLE
YEAR WE HIT RECORDS IN 2011,
2012, 2013, 2014.
2015, WAS A PULLBACK BECAUSE OF
ENERGY.
ASK ENERGY WAS UP.
AND IT IS JUST INACCURATE.
CAPITAL SPENDING AT THE HEAD OF
BUYBACKS EVERYTHING A YEAR SINCE
2009, AND THE RECORD YEAR WAS
2007.
WE ARE THIS DRUMBEAT -- HERE
THIS DRUMBEAT OF INACCURATE DATA
BEING SPOUTED.
DAVID: SO I WAS WRONG, AND I'M
GLAD TO BE CORRECTED.
TOBIAS: EVERYBODY IS WRONG ON
THIS ONE.
DAVID: WHY IS A PRODUCTIVITY
COMING OUT? 
TOBIAS: I TALKED TO THE
PROTESTERS -- PROFESSORS IN THE
U.S., AND THEY THINK IT IS BEING
MEASURED CORRECTLY FOR THE MOST
PART.
YOU TAKE AN UBER CAR RIDE FOR
INSTANCE.
YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR.
BEHIND THE SCENES, YOU ARE
GETTING BILLED, RIGHT? 
THERE IS A BILLING PROCESS
HAPPENING IN THE CLOUD, BUT YOU
WALK OFF THE TO YOUR NEXT
MEETING OR WHATEVER.
THAT IS PRODUCTIVITY.
THERE WAS A PROCESS OF A BILL
PAYMENT BEING GENERATED.
IT GOES TO YOUR E-MAILS, THIS IS
WHAT YOU SPEND, ETC. 
SOMETHING IS GOING ON, BUT WE
DON'T MEASURE IT THAT WAY IN
TERMS OF HOURS.
MOST OF THE KIND OF ACADEMIC
GROUPS THAT LOOK AT THIS BELIEVE
THERE IS A MEASUREMENT ISSUE.
ALIX: SO YOU HAVE 3% EARNINGS
GROWTH FOR 2016 FOR THE S&P.
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF
ORGANIC GROWTH.
AND IN CITIGROUP SAYS THE
BREXIT--- HEIGHTENED THE RISK.
HOW DO YOU EVEN THIS? 
TOBIAS: GREAT RESPECT FOR PHIL,
SO IF I SAY ANYTHING BAD, IT
WILL COME BACK TO ME.
THE CONTEXT IS THE SAME, IT USES
THE TERM A GROWTH RECESSION.
IT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
MODEST GROWTH, THE U.S. BEING
ONE OF THE BETTER ELEMENTS OF
THAT GROWTH.
THERE WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
OVER THE LAST DOUBLE YEARS.
IT IS NOT EVEN EUROPE OR THE
U.S., IT IS EMERGING MARKETS.
THAT HAD BEEN THE ENGINE OF
GROWTH GLOBALLY AND THE SLOWDOWN
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.
MONTI'S AND COUNTRIES, FOR
EXAMPLE.
LET'S GO TO THE U.S..
70% OF THE SALES ARE NORTH
AMERICAN.
WE ARE MORE DOMINATED BY WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE.
THE GROWTH IS SLOWER THAN WE
ANTICIPATED BEFORE.
YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER, YOU NEED
SOMETHING MORE DEVASTATING TO
HER THE EARNINGS OF THE U.S..
WE HAD A COUPLE OF THINGS
HURTING US, ENERGY.
THAT WAS 80%, BUT HE PERCENT WAS
THE TRAWLER -- DOLLAR -- 20% WAS
THE DOLLAR.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISN
MANUFACTURING NEW ORDERS, THEY
HAVE BEEN OUT FIVE MONTHS IN A
ROW, WHICH HAS BEEN HARBINGER
FOR INDUSTRIAL TRENDS.
IT IS DOWN.
IF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GOES
UP, WHICH INDICATORS SAY IT
WILL, EARNINGS WILL FOLLOW.
YOU SPREAD OVERHEAD COSTS A COST
MORE UNITS, GENERATE MORE
PROFITS.
ALIX: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CITIGROUP CHIEF U.S. EQUITY
STRATEGIST IS STAYING WITH US.
COMING UP ON GO, MINUTES AWAY
FROM THE JUNE JOBS REPORT,
180,000 JOBS EXPECTED LAST MONTH
IN THE U.S. 
WE REACT TO THE DATA.
FUTURES UP FIVE POINTS.
THIS IS UP -- THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
â™ª
JONATHAN: FOUR MINUTES AND 35
SECONDS AWAY FROM THE GYM PAY
MORE -- JUNE JOBS REPORT.
FUTURES ARE UP 0.2% IN LONDON.
EQUITIES UP ON THE CONTINENT AS
WELL, DAX UP 1.35%.
WITH LOOK AT THE OTHER INDICES.
ABIGAIL HAS THE STOCKS TO WATCH.
REPORTER: BIG MOVERS IN THE U.S.
STARTING WITH POLYCOM, SHARES
ARE SOARING THAT THE VIDEO
COMPANY IS GOING TO BE ACQUIRED
FOR $2 BILLION BY SERIOUS.
IT ALSO AND THE MERGER PACT
AGREEMENT WITH A CANADIAN MIKE
DELL.
THERE ARE SHAREHOLDER RELIEF
WITH STOCKS IN THE U.S.,
PLUNGING ON THE NEWS THREE
PATIENTS DIED IN A CANCER TRIAL.
THIS IS GOING TO PUT THAT WHOLE
TRIAL FOR ACUTE LEUKEMIA ON HOLD
BEFORE TODAY'S DOWNWARD MOVE.
JUNO HAD BEEN OUTPERFORMING THE
BIOTECH INDEX, BUT WE WILL JOIN
THE BEAR MARKET.
IN THE CYBER SECURITY STOCK IS
STORING TODAY -- SOARING TODAY.
EARNINGS BY 80% CUT.
IT IS A HUGE BEACH.
OTHER CYBER SECURITY STOCKS
COULD BE SOUGHT SOARING.
JONATHAN: LET'S LOOK AT WHAT KEY
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.
JEFFREY'S MANAGING DIRECTOR OF
FOREIGN EXCHANGE IS LOOKING AT
THE IMPACT OF TODAY'S JOB REPORT
ON THE DOLLAR.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU.
BECAUSE OF THIS TUG-OF-WAR
BETWEEN SAFE HAVEN BID FOR THE
DOLLAR ON ONE SIDE AND RAPIDLY
DECLINING EXPECTATIONS OF
ACTIVITY ON THE FED ON THE OTHER
, WHICH SIDE WINS? 
WHEN WE GET THE BREAKOUT? 
>> IF WE GET A BIG NUMBER IN
ENOUGH COMBINED WITH AVERAGE
EARNINGS OF 0.3% OR 0.4% MONTH
OVER MONTH, THAT WOULD BE BIG
AND THE DOLLAR WOULD RALLY
SIGNIFICANTLY.
HE WOULD HAVE TO REPRICE THE
FED.
THE SUMMER 2016 COMES BACK ON
THE CARDS.
-- DECEMBER 2016 COMES BACK ON
THE CARDS.
IT WOULD NOT DO MUCH ON THE
DOLLAR STORY.
WE REMAIN IN THE SAME TUG-OF-WAR
WE ARE IN NOW.
IF WE GET A BIG MISS, THERE IS A
ASYMMETRIC SET UP.
IF WE GET A BIG MISS LOWER, THAT
WILL BE BAD FOR MARKETS.
WE MIGHT HAVE TO PASS GLOBAL
RECESSION.
IF THE DOLLAR GETS HIT INITIALLY
, AND THEN PROBABLY COMES BACK
ON A SAFE HAVEN BID.
DOLLAR-YEN IT WILL BE THE ONE
THAT SUFFERS THE MOST IN THAT
REGARD.
THE TUG-OF-WAR IS IN PLACE.
LOOKING FOR NUMBER OUTSIDE OF
THE CONSENSUS AND THE
COMFORTABLE RANGE.
JONATHAN: TALKING ABOUT
ASYMMETRIC RISK, LOOK ABOUT THE
DOLLAR.
IF WE COULD CAPTURE THIS, THE
DOLLAR IS UNDERPERFORMED
EVERYTHING BAR THE CABLE RATE
AGAINST STERLING.
GIVEN THE MOVE EITHER WAY,
SURELY THE POTENTIAL FOR THE
UPSIDE IS BIGGER, GIVEN WE HAVE
A LOT OF STOCK MOVEMENT AND
TALKING FROM THE FED.
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
WE HAVE SEEN THE DOLLAR
WEAKENING AGAINST COMMODITY
CURRENCIES AND THE YEN.
IT DID RALLY AGAINST EMERGING
MARKETS AND THE POUND, BUT NOT
AGAINST THE EURO.
THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR THE
DOLLAR TO RALLY.
ANY MEANINGFUL SHIFT IN U.S.
RATES WILL GIVE THAT INTO THE
DOLLAR.
IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF
THE FED TO HAVE AN EXCITED --
EXTENDED DOLLAR RALLY, AND THAT
WILL BE KEY.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
40 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE PAYROLL
REPORT.
LET'S CHECK IN ON THE MARKETS.
THE SCORECARD AHEAD OF THAT,
THIS IS HOW WE TRADE. FUTURES
ARE FIRM IN THE UNITED STATES.
EQUITIES ARE UP IN EUROPE, THE
DAX UP 1.35%, THE FTSE 0.3%.
THIS IS ALL THE FX MARKET IS
POSITIONED.
DOLLAR-YEN, 149.49.
A STRONGER POUND STORY IN
TODAY'S SESSION. YIELDS HAVE NOT
CHANGED ON THE 10 YEAR.
1.39% IS HOW WE TRADE ON THE
U.S. 10 YEAR.
THE JUNE PAYROLL REPORT IS RIGHT
HERE WITH JULIE HYMAN.
JULIE: 287,000 JOBS ADDED IN
JUNE, THAT IS THE BEST GAIN
SINCE OCTOBER 2015.
BETTER THAN 180,000 ESTIMATED BY
ECONOMISTS.
AND THE ECONOMY -- 4.9% VERSUS
4.7% AS UNEMPLOYED ROSE.
EARNINGS GAINING 0.1%, HALF OF
WHAT WAS ESTIMATED.
THE OTHER IMPORTANT NUMBER, MAY
REVISE IS DOWN FROM A GAIN OF
38,000.
APRIL REVISED HIGHER TO 144,000
123,000.
THAT MEANS THE THREE-MONTH
AVERAGE GAIN IS 147,000 VERSUS
THE 12 MONTH AVERAGE GAIN OF
129,000.
SO THEY CAME FROM GAINS IN
LEISURE, HOSPITALITY, SOCIAL
ASSISTANCE, AND FINANCIAL
ACTIVITIES.
PRIVATE SECTOR GROWS 25,000.
IN MAY, THE GAINS THAT IT
HAPPENED, HAPPENED BECAUSE OF
GOVERNMENT HIRING.
THIS FELL BY 6000 IN MAY.
IT WAS THE FIRST DECLINE SINCE
FEBRUARY 2010.
THERE WAS THE VERIZON EFFECT ON
THE INFORMATION CATEGORY.
THE BIGGEST DROP IN PRIVATE
SECTOR AND HURRYING IN THE MONTH
OF MAY -- HIRING WAS IN
TEMPORARY AGENCIES.
62.7%.
THE AVERAGE WORK WEEK AT 74 .4%.
THE HEADLINE, 287,000 JOBS ADDED
IN JUNE, AND MAY REVISE DOWN TO
11,000.
JONATHAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MARKETS TRADING ON THE UPSIDE.
A BIG BEAT FOR THE MONTH OF
JUNE.
THE TWO-YEAR YIELDS GOING UP
FIVE BASIS POINTS, TO 63.
10 YEAR YIELDS UP FOR BASIS
POINTS, ZERO POINT -- 1.43.
A STRONGER DOLLAR STORY.
THE CABLE RATE IS PUTTING BACK
DOWN TO 129.
THE DOLLAR INDEX UP 0.1%.
THE INITIAL REACT IN THE MARKET
IS UP.
WITH EVERY DEEP THAT REMAINS TO
BE SEEN, BUT WE ARE TRADING ON
THE UPSIDE SURPRISE.
ALIX: TWO HUNDRED 87,000 JOBS
ADDED IN JUNE.
MUCH MORE EVEN IF YOU BACK OUT
37,000 FOR THE VERIZON WORKERS.
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A GAIN OF
250,000 WORKERS.
DAVID: IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS
GOING TO BE HALF OF THAT.
I WAS SURPRISED BY HOW ALL OVER
THE PLACE THE NUMBERS WERE.
ALIX: 11,000 JOBS DOWN FROM
38,000.
AND YOU ARE SEEING THE MARKET
SORT OF MOVE HIGHER ON THAT.
LET'S GO TO TOM KEENE AND
MICHAEL ON BLOOMBERG RADIO.
THEY ARE SPEAKING WITH JANET ON
THE MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED
JOBS REPORT.
TOM: WE WELCOME BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION WITH THE RADIO
AUDIENCE.
WE HAVE JP MORGAN HERE.
BILL GROSS OF JANET'S CAPITAL.
THIS IS A POINT WHERE YOU SMOOTH
THINGS OUT.
I'M LOOKING AT A THREE MONTH
MOVING AVERAGE OF 147,000.
THAT IS STABILIZING THE SHOT
THAT WE SAW LAST MONTH.
BILL: YEAH, I THINK SO.
THE FED'S STATEMENT LAST MONTH
SUGGESTED UNEMPLOYMENT,
UNCERTAINTY.
AS USED -- AS YOU STRAIGHT
THINGS OUT, THAT DOES IT.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WENT UP TO
49, WAGES INCREASED 0.2.
THINGS ARE NOT AS HUNKY-DORY AS
287,000 MIGHT SUGGEST.
BUT IT IS MAYBE A NORMAL
150,000.
IT IS NOTHING TO GET EXCITED
ABOUT.
>> BUT DOESN'T GET ANYBODY
INTERESTED IN WHAT JANET YELLEN
AND COMPANY ARE GOING TO DO? 
DOES THAT CHANGE THE CALCULATION
OF WHEN THEY MIGHT MOVE AT ALL
FOR YOU? 
BILL: I DON'T THINK SO.
THERE IS THE BREXIT TO LOOK INTO
THE EYES OF BREXIT, I GUESS.
THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ITALIAN
BANKS.
DOES WITH THE ECB AND THE EU DO,
PROBLEMS WITH U.K. THE PROPERTY,
MUTUAL FUNDS.
THERE IS A SENSE OF LIQUIDITY IN
MARKETS, AND THE FED IS UPSET
AND CONCERNED WITH MARKETS.
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS
DISCORD AROUND THE WORLD.
I THINK THE FED STAYS WHERE IT
IS.
THEY WANT TO RAISE INTEREST
RATES.
THEY DID IT ONCE.
IF THEY WANT TO HAVE US BELIEVE
THEY WILL RAISE SEVERAL TIMES
AND THEREFORE HAVE A PRETTY
POSITIVE YIELD CURVE, WHICH WILL
HELP BANKS AND INSURANCE
COMPANIES, FOR THE MOST PART, I
DON'T THINK THIS CHANGE IS MUCH.
MICHAEL: YOUR CALLS FOR HOW MANY
RATE MOVES THIS YEAR? 
BILL: THE MARKET CALLS FOR A
HALF IN THE 12 MONTHS BEYOND
THAT, ANOTHER HALF.
12 BASIS POINTS EACH.
THAT IS THE MARKET.
THAT IS, I THINK THEY RAISE ONCE
AND TRY TO GET EMPLOYMENT
NUMBERS LIKE THIS, AND IF THEY
GET THOSE WAGES UP, THEN PERHAPS
THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CHANCE
LATER IN THE YEAR.
THEY REALLY DO WANT TO RAISE
RATES, SOME OF THEM LIKE BULLARD
AND EVANS HAVE A SENSE THEY NEED
HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN A TO
BALANCE OUT THEIR SAVINGS VERSUS
THE INVESTMENT ELEMENT IN THE
ECONOMY.
TOM: IN THE MARKET COME BACK, IT
IS STRONGER YEN AND THEN WEAKER
YEN ON THE REPORT.
AND THEN WE HAVE THE YEN COMING
BACK AGAIN.
WITHOUT QUESTION IN OUR
LIFETIMES, THIS IS THE MOST
PRIZED TO PERFECTION BOND MARKET
WE'VE EVER SEEN.
IS YOUR DAY TO DAY LIFE CHANGED
WHEN YOU SEE YIELDS? 
THE YIELD GOES FROM 139 TO 131.
THESE ARE SHOCKING YIELDS,
SHOCKING BOND EVALUATIONS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DAY-TO-DAY
WITHIN THIS? 
BILL: I GOT A HIT IS PRICED TO
PERFECTION, I WILL CHANGE THAT
IF YOU PERMIT MAY.
-- I DON'T THINK IT IS PRICED TO
PERFECTION.
SPONSORED NEGATIVE YIELD SPACE.
IN GERMANY, THE ECB CANNOT
PROVIDE 40% OF GERMAN BONDS
BECAUSE THEY ARE YIELDING LESS
THAN 40 BASIS POINTS, ALMOST
EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE 40 YEAR
JGB.
SO IT IS ON THIRD THAT IT IS
ABSURD.
SO YOU DON'T BUY THOSE BONDS.
THAT IS UP IN THE GERMAN BANKS
AND INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO
BUY BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT TO PUT
THEIR MONEY SOMEWHERE.
SO YOU SUBSTITUTE SOME KIND OF
CERTAINTY.
THE TRICK IN THIS BUSINESS IS TO
BUY THE HIGHEST RETURN RELATIVE
TO RISK.
I WOULD SAY EVERY ASSET CLASS IS
AT RISK.
THE QUESTION IS, WHICH IS AT
LESS RISK.
MY DOMINANT PREMISE IS, CENTRAL
BANKS WILL DO WHAT THEY DO
DESPITE THE FACT I DISAGREE WITH
IT.
IF THAT IS THE CASE, VOLATILITY
OF CENTRAL BANKS' POSITIONS, THE
VOLATILITY OF THE POLICY RATES
AROUND THE WORLD WILL STAY
RELATIVELY CONSTANT.
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THAT BY SELLING PERSONALITY
AROUND IT.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE BUYING MORE,
SELLING OUTRIGHT OPTIONS.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE BASICALLY
STAYING IN YOUR IN ZONE SUMMING
LIKE 1.4% ON A 10 YEAR LIKE 5%
OR 6%.
TOM: AND WHEN MR. GROSS SHELLS
OPTIONS, THOSE DERIVATIVES,
THOSE BRING IN THE INCOME
STREAM.
BILL GROSS, IF I LOOK INTO THE
WEEKEND AND INTO JULY, INTO THE
SECOND HALF, IS BILL GROSS
LOOKING AT JANET YELLEN'S
AMERICAN WORLD AND FOR THAT
MATTER, A TROUBLED EUROPE AS AN
EQUILIBRIUM OR DISEQUILIBRIUM SO
GREAT THAT YOU NEED TO BE
VIGILANT FOR THE SHOCKS? 
BILL: ONE MUST BE PREPARED.
IT IS HARD TO SAY.
IT DOES NOT APPROACH A BLACK
SWAN, BABY A GRACE WANT.
-- -- MAYBE A GRAY SWAN. 
WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IS
GOING ON WITH CHINA, BUT I
OBSERVED THE CHINESE STOCK
MARKETS BASICALLY STAY LEVEL
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NIGHT,
EACH AND EVERY NIGHT.
ONE HALF IS SUSPECTED, SOMETHING
IS GOING ON THERE.
THERE IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM
ALMOST EVERYWHERE, AND I, THAT
IS THE KEY.
A HIGHLY LIVERED WORLD, ANYTHING
CAN SET IT OFF.
TOM: LET ME ASK ONE MORE
QUESTION BEFORE WE GO TO MY
COLLEAGUE.
THERE WAS A BRILLIANT ARTICLE
WRITTEN OVERNIGHT IN THE
TELEGRAPH ABOUT CHINA EXPORTING
THEIR DEFLATION OVER TO US.
IS JANET YELLEN RUNNING A
NON-ORTHODOX POLICY THAT SHE HAS
GOT TO ACCEPT THE DISINFLATION
FROM CHINA AND THE REST OF A
TROUBLED ECONOMIC WORLD? 
BILL: I THINK SHE DOES, AND IF
SHE CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT
RAISING INTEREST RATES, THAT
WOULD MAKE IT EVEN WORSE.
CHINA HAS BEEN DEVALUED THE 6%
OR 7% OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR
EIGHT MONTHS, 10% ANNUAL
EXPORTING DEFLATION.
EXPERTS DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
THAT COULD BE THE CASE.
IT MEANS WE CAN BUY CHINESE
GOODS MUCH CHEAPER.
THAT ERODES THE MANUFACTURING
BASES, IT BECOMES IS
COMPETITIVE.
CHINA EXPORTS DEFLATION TO THE
REST OF THE WORLD.
YELLEN FIGHTS THAT, NOT WITH A
STRONGER DOLLAR OR AN INTEREST
RATE HIKE.
HER TEMPERS, HER BEHAVIOR DOES
TO SOME EXTENT.
TOM: WE ARE SO EUROPE, EUROPE,
EUROPE.
GUESS WHAT? 
CHINA AND A LITTLE BIT TO DO
WITH IT.
TOM: CHINA WILL COME BACK INTO
THE NEWS.
MICHAEL: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT
THE PRICE ACTION TODAY.
IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE
BEEN SEEING IN RECENT WEEKS.
DOES THE NEW CURVE TELL US ANY
MUCH ABOUT THIS POINT? 
IN THEORY, WE SHOULD SEE MORE
SIGNS OF INFLATION AND NOT GO
DOWN AS MUCH AS GOING UP.
BILL: I THINK WE, THE OLD
STANDARD, THAT IS THE POSSIBLE
PROBLEM WITH THE OLD-TIME
INVESTORS, NOT THAT I AM 72 --
BUT I THINK THE OLD STANDARD IS
WHEN THE 10-TO CURVE IS ON ZERO.
IT HAS COME DOWN FROM 250 TWO
NOW I THINK IT IS A READ ON 78
OR 80.
-- I THINK IT IS AROUND 78 OR
80.
THE PROCESS OF FLATTENING, THE
MOMENTUM OF FLATTENING WILL MAKE
THE DIFFERENCE, AND ONE HAS TO
ADJUST TO THE HIGHLY LEVERED
WORLD.
IT IS A DIFFERENT WORLD WITH THE
YELLED FLAT -- YIELD CURVE IS
FLAT AT ZERO.
I THINK THE FED BASICALLY HAS
BEEN TIGHTENING FOR THE LAST TWO
YEARS.
THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF THINGS.
THEY HAVE WATCHED THE CURVE
BETWEEN TWO AND 10, 30
FLATTENING.
THAT RESTRICTS FINANCIAL WITH
PROFITABILITY, REGULATION, ALL
OF THAT IN COMBINATION.
THE FLATTENING YIELD CURVE IS
NOT GOOD.
EVEN WHERE IT IS, IT SUGGESTS A
POTENTIAL FOR SLOWER GROWTH IN
THE SESSION DOWN THE ROAD,
ESPECIALLY ALONGSIDE A VERY
STRONG DOLLAR.
YOU CAN SEE AN INCREASE BY 20%
TO 25% IN THE REST OF THE WORLD.
MICHAEL: A VERY PROVOCATIVE
PIECE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, GOT
A LOT OF COMMENT.
IT SUGGESTS THE BANKS ARE
KEEPING RATES TOO LOW.
IF THEY WERE TO RISE, THANKS FOR
MOBILITY -- BANKS PROFITABILITY
WILL HAVE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS.
UGLY PEOPLE, NOT YOU -- 
TOM: WATCH YOURSELF OR YOU WILL
NEVER COME ON AGAIN.
MICHAEL: THEY ARE NOT MAKING ANY
MONEY RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THEY
CAN EARN ANYTHING ON THEIR
SAVINGS.
YOU GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK
THAT WAY THAN TRYING TO
INFLUENCE THE SPENDING BEHAVIOR
OF MILLENNIALS.
BILL: I THINK SO TOO, BUT THAT
IS NOT THE PROBLEM.
THE CENTRAL BANKS WORK OFF OF
20, 30 YEAR MODELS.
I THINK IT IS COMMONSENSICAL.
THAT IS WHERE COMMON SENSE
ENTERS THE EQUATION.
IT WOULD BE NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF
MORTGAGE RATES.
CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF STOCK
PRICES AT DISCOUNT RELATIVE TO
THE GORDON DIVIDEND DISCOUNT
MODEL.
TO BASICALLY LOWER ITS PRICES,
EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL.
THE REAL PROBLEM GOING FORWARD
IS SAVINGS AND THE ABILITY TO
EARN SAVINGS.
EXECUTIVE COMPANIES,
PROFITABILITY AND MARGINS,
CITIZEN INCOMES, EDUCATION AND
RETIREMENT.
IT WAS TIME TO RAISE INTEREST
RATES, 12 TO 18 MONTHS AGO.
I STILL THINK IT IS, BUT I DON'T
THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
MICHAEL: YOU MENTIONED PENSION
FUNDS.
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS GOING
TO BE A DISASTER.
WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU ARE GOING
TO BE A PENSION FUND MANAGER? 
BILL: IT IS A DISASTER.
YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE RULES A
BIT.
THEY DO THAT, THEY CHANGE THE
RULES AND MAKE THE RELEVANT RATE
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN ORDER
TO STRETCH OUT THE INEVITABLE.
BUT YOU TRY TO CUT BENEFITS.
THAT DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL.
WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN INTO
TROY AND CHICAGO.
THE BEGICH'S -- BUDGETS GET HUNG
UP AS YOU TRY TO REDUCE
BENEFITS.
SO IT BECOMES A LONG, DRY DOUBT
BATTLE IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE
MARGINAL PROFITABILITY OVER THE
MARGINAL SURVIVABILITY OF A
PENSION FUND.
MOST OF THEM ARE LIKE 80% FUNDED
BECAUSE OF LOWER INTEREST RATES
AND THEIR DURATIONS HAVE NOT
MATCHED THE DURATIONS OF
LIABILITY.
IT IS A LONG PROBLEM GOING
FORWARD.
ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO IT IS TO
RAISE INTEREST RATES.
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.
MICHAEL: WILL THIS UNLEASHED A
WAVE OF BUYING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS
CAPITULATE? 
IS THIS A FIGHT OVER 30? 
BILL: THAT IS THE BUZZ IN THE
PAPER.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT IS
TRUE OR NOT.
IT IS HARD TO IMMUNIZE YOUR
PORTFOLIO.
A 10 YEAR AT 1.4%.
YOU WILL QUESTION YOUR SANITY
BECAUSE A FEW YEARS AGO, IT WAS
3%.
BEFORE THAT, 5%.
ANNUAL IMMUNIZE AT 1.4%.
-- NOW YOU WILL IMMUNIZE AT
1.4%.
SO ALL HE IS IN GERMANY, THEIR
PORTFOLIO WAS NEGATIVE SPACE.
-- ALLIANCE AND GERMANY, THERE
PORTFOLIO IS NEGATIVE SPACE.
THE REAL PROBLEM WOULD BE A RUSH
TO ALL YOU RISK YOUR ASSETS TO
PROVIDE A SEMBLANCE OF RETURN,
RELATIVE TO LIABILITIES.
TOM: YOU MENTIONED PROFIT
COMPANIES IN THE EDITING THEM.
THEY HAVE GOT TO STOP REDUCTIONS
FROM THE VARIOUS FUNDS BECAUSE
OF THE GAIN.
I THINK WHAT ALL OF OUR VIEWERS
AND LISTENERS WANT TO LEARN FROM
BILL GROSS, INCLUDING THE
INSTITUTIONAL LEAD LIKE MADAME
LAGARDE WARNING YESTERDAY WITH
THE IMF IS WHEN THIS ALICE IN
WONDERLAND WORLD UNDERLINES.
WILL IT UNWIND ALONG SMOOTH,
PREDICTABLE, DAMPENED REACTION
FUNDS, OR WILL IT UNWIND WITH
UGLY JUMP CONDITIONS WHERE THERE
IS REAL DAMAGE? 
WHICH WAY DO YOU GO? 
BILL: POLICY MAKERS ARE TRYING
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THERE.
IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS,
MONETARY STIMULATION, CHANGING
AND RULES AT THE LAST MINUTE.
WE HAVE GOT GERMANY BASICALLY
SUGGESTING A BAIL IN COULD BE A
BAIL OUT FOR ITALIAN BANKS UNDER
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
WE'LL GET THE U.K. PROPERTY
MUTUAL FUNDS BASICALLY CHANGING
THEIR UNIT VALUE.
THE WORTH OF THE FUND BY 15
OVERNIGHT TO PREVENT MONEY
COMING OUT, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE.
IT MAKES AN INVESTOR SAY, WHAT
IS MY MONEY WORTH? 
TOM: THERE IS A SMALLTIME BOND
MANAGER ON THE WEST COAST.
REMEMBER HIM? 
HIS NAME IS GUN LOCK, AND HE
FOCUSES ON DEUTSCHE BANK AS A
PROXY FOR THE EUROPEAN BANKS.
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE POSITION
DEUTSCHE BANK IS IN OR IF THEY
HAVE TO STRUCTURE COCOA HYBRIDS
FOR THE ITALIAN BANKS TO BE THE
KIND OF JUMP CONDITION THAT
LEADS TO REAL INSTABILITY? 
BILL: IT COULD BE.
WE HAVE KNOWN DEUTSCHE BANK IS A
WEAK LINK IN THE BANKING SYSTEM
FOR A LONG TIME.
WITH THE STOCK PRICES, IT SINKS
TO 11, 10.
THERE MUST BE A HOLE SOMEWHERE.
DEUTSCHE BANK IS OVER HUNDREDS
OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF
DERIVATIVES, SOME OF WHICH THEN
CLOSED OUT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS LEFT.
SO THE DEUTSCHE BANK WAS THE
BASTION OF GERMAN BANKING VERSUS
A LONG TIME, BUT IT GOT CAUGHT
IN THE RUSH TO DERIVATIVE MESS.
NOW IS THE PROBLEM.
CERTAIN ITALIAN BANKS, DEUTSCHE
BANK, THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE FOR
THE POLICYMAKERS AS THEY CHANGE
THE RULES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT
THEM, ALL OF THESE THINGS,
REDUCED CONFIDENCE IN MARKETS IS
INVESTORS KNOW THE ARTIFICIAL
PRICES ARE THE THEME OF THE DAY.
TOM: ONE THING YOU HAVE BEEN
COMFORTABLE WITH IN RECENT
QUARTERS HAS BEEN MEXICO.
IF I SEE A BREXIT KNOCK ON
EFFECT WITH THE CONTAGION IN
EUROPE GOING OVER TO A MEXICAN
PESO FROM 18 TO A WEAKER 19, WHO
KNOWS WHERE IT IS GOING, DOES
EVEN BILL GROSS HAVE TO STOP
DOING NORMAL PROCEDURES BECAUSE
OF THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT OF
BREXIT IN EUROPE OVER TO AN
EMERGING MARKET PROXY LIKE
MEXICO? 
BILL: I THINK THAT IS A FAIR
IMPRESSION.
MEXICO IS A PROXY FOR EMERGING
MARKETS.
IT IS ABREAST OF THE ART
EMERGING MARKETS.
IT HAS HALF THE DDP OF THE
UNITED STATES, BUT MEXICO AND
THE PESO ARE TAKEN ON THE CHIN
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF
POLICY? 
WE SAW LAST WEEK THE CENTRAL
BANK RAISED INTEREST RATES TO
SUPPORT THE PESO TO SOME EXTENT.
SO YOU CAN EXPECT VOLATILITY.
I WILL POINT OUT THE MEXICAN
TEN-YEAR TIP, THE LINKER, THE
INFLATION IN THE BOND, IT YIELDS
3% REAL AS OPPOSED TO 35 BASIS
POINTS IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT IS HUGE SPREAD.
YOU CAN ADJUST FOR CREDIT
QUALITY, BUT IT IS A VALUE
ABSENT, A RUSH TO SAFETY.
MICHAEL: WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF
PEOPLE RUSHING INTO CORPORATE
BONDS AS ANYBODY TRIES TO GET
SOME SORT OF YIELD HERE.
HIS THAT A SMART MOVE? 
ARE PEOPLE TAKING TOO MUCH OF A
RISK AND USING IT AS A PROXY FOR
SOVEREIGNS? 
BILL: IT IS A QUICK FORMULA.
YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SPREAD
IS, YOU PAY HIGH YIELD AT 450
BASIS POINTS TO FIGURE OF THE
ANNUALIZED DEFAULTS ON THE
RECOVERY.
4% OF THE RECOVERY OF 50%.
THAT TAKES TWO POINTS OFF THE
4.5, SO THAT LEAVES YOU 2.5%.
YOU HAVE TREASURIES.
THAT IS NOT A BAD DEAL, BUT IT
IS NOT THE DEAL INVESTORS THINK
WE ARE GOING TO GET.
AND WE HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT, THOSE SPREADS ARE
GOING TO WIDEN OUT.
IT IS OBVIOUS WHEN INTEREST
RATES ARE ZERO AND NEGATIVE BUT
EVERYTHING IS TIED TOGETHER.
THE KNEE BONE AND THE HIP BONE
AND JUNK BONDS AND NEGATIVE
INTEREST BONDS ARE TIED
TOGETHER.
YOU MUST THINK THE HIGH-YIELD
BOND AREA IS ARTIFICIALLY
PRICED AND UNDERWRITTEN HIS AND
CIRCUMSTANCES.
-- IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
MICHAEL: ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES
OF CORPORATE, OR JUST
HIGH-YIELD? 
BILL: THERE ARE CD X, AN INDEX
OF HIGH-YIELD BONDS.
IG CDX, INVESTMENT-GRADE BONDS.
THEY ARE EASILY TRADED.
THE IG CDX ARE ABOUT 125.
SO WHEN YOU BUY PROTECTION
VERSUS SELLING, THAT YOU ARE
GIVING UP THAT CARRY.
BUT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A
WIDENING OF SPREADS.
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN BOTH OF
THOSE MARKETS.
MICHAEL: THE COST OF MARKET
MONEY, EFFECTIVELY 37 BASIS
POINTS, OR CORPORATE BONDS THE
CHANNEL FOR MONETARY POLICY NOW?
BILL: THEY CERTAINLY ARE
BEGINNING TO BE WITH THE ECB.
STOCKS OF THE ASSET CLASS OF THE
DAY WITH THE SWISS NATIONAL
BANK, WE FOUND UP.
THEY HAVE $500 BILLION WORTH OF
STOCKS AROUND THE WORLD,
INCLUDING JOHNSON & JOHNSON.
IT IS STAGGERING.
WE HAVE KNOWN THE JAPANESE BUY
STOCKS, BUT I NEVER KNEW THE
SWISS NATIONAL BANK BOUGHT
STOCKS.
IT IS LIKE A SOVEREIGN WEALTH
FUND.
AND SO THIS ENTIRE MARKET IS
DISTORTED BY CASH FLOWS THAT
NEVER HAVE BEEN.
TOM: I LOOK AT THE SWISS FRANC
AND STERLING HAS A SAFE HAVEN
PROXY FOR THIS UNITED KINGDOM
STUFF.
ALL OF THE WORLD WOULD LIKE TO
KNOW THE BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE
WORLD WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE THINKING IN THE DRAMA OF
THE BREXIT VOTE.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING AS YOU
SAW THE UNITED KINGDOM SHIFT TO
LEAVE VERSUS THE PRESUMED
REMAIN? 
BILL:BILL: I WAS WATCHING THAT
OVERNIGHT.
WHAT I WAS WATCHING, I HAD SOME
OPTIONS IN U.S. TREASURIES,
CALLS AND PUTS.
INITIALLY, THE U.S. TREASURIES
WERE DECLINING IN PRICE,
DECLINING TO MUCH.
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, AS THE
BREXIT WAS WINNING, TREASURIES
WENT AND WE ARE GOING UP TOO
MUCH.
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL AS
MUCH VOLATILITY AS HAPPENED ON
THAT NIGHT.
IT WAS A LONG NIGHT FOR ME.
IT TURNED OUT VERY WELL, BUT
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH A
SUDDEN CHANGE.
THERE ARE SO MANY POSITIONS, SO
MUCH LEVERAGE, CURRENCY WISE AS
YOU POINT OUT EVERY FIVE MINUTES
ON YOUR PROGRAM.
I THINK THAT IS GOOD.
THERE ARE HUGE CURRENCY
POSITIONS THAT HAVE TO BE
ALLOWED AND REBALANCED.
THERE ARE HUGE POSITIONS IN
TERMS OF CREDIT AND TREASURIES.
HUGE POSITIONS ACROSS THE U.S.
TREASURY.
LOTS OF VOLATILITY.
LOST TAKING ON ONE SIDE AND
TRAUMA ON THE OTHER.
IT IS NOT THE WAY CAPITALISM
SHOULD BE RUN.
IT A CASINO OPPOSED TO A
MIDWESTERN FARM.
ALIX: YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO
JANICE CAPITAL BILL GROSS.
SO AS TO RECAP FROM THESE MAJOR
JOBS HEADLINES WE SEE, THE JEW
NUMBER AT 287,000 JOBS -- JUNE
NUMBER.
A FEW THOUSAND WORKERS GAIN.
I REALLY BLOCKBUSTER REPORT, BUT
WAGES -- 
DAVID: A RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES.
ALIX: MUCH MORE COMING UP.
WE CONTINUE JOB COVERAGE.
â™ª
ALIX:ALIX: PAYROLLS JUMPED,
HIRING PICKING UP IN JUNE AFTER
287,000 JOBS ARE ADDED, TO
BEATING ESTIMATES OF 180,000.
FUTURES RISING TO FOUR POINT
PERCENT AS PEOPLE INTO THE
WORKFORCE.
JONATHAN: CONCERNS OVER
FINANCIAL INSTABILITY.
BAKE INTERVENTION -- BANK
INTERVENTION IN ITALY CANNOT BE
RULED OUT.
DAVID: POLICE OFFICERS ARE
KILLED AFTER SNIPERS OPENED FIRE
ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE HEART
OF DALLAS.
â™ª
DAVID: WE ARE 30 MINUTES AWAY
FROM THE OPENING BELL.
THIS IS "BLOOMBERG ." 
HE WITH ALIX STEEL, AND JONATHAN
FERRO, JOINING US FROM LONDON.
ALIX: 287,000 JOBS WERE ADDED IN
JUNE, AND WE HAVE THREE GUESTS
TO WEIGH IN.
RICK READER, BLACK ROCK CHIEF
INVESTMENT OFFICER FOR FIXED
INCOME WILL BE JOINING US, AND
THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
JOHN, MARKETS ARE ON THE MOVE.
JONATHAN: WHAT I SEE FIRST OF
ALL IS GOOD NEWS.
USE NEWS IS RALLYING OFF THE
BACK OF THIS.
S&P FUTURES UP 0.3%.
WE PUSH TO NEW SESSION HIGHS ON
THE DAX, UP FOUR PERCENTAGE
POINT IN FRAY FOR, GERMANY.
DOLLAR-YEN BOUNCES BACK,
BRIEFLY, THAT SETTLES IT 100.67.
THE CABLE RATE GOES BACK TO
WHERE IT WAS AT 129.69, A YIELD
WAS HIGHER.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER.
WE HAVE TRIPLED LOSSES, THE
YIELD TO BASIS POINTS UP FROM 4%
ON THE U.S. TENURE.
DAVID: I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE
JUNE EMPLOYMENT DATA IT NUMBERS.
JULIE HYMAN IS JOINING US FROM
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT LIVE IN
WASHINGTON.
JULIE: I WANT TO BRING YOU THE
DETAILS OF THE REPORT ONCE
AGAIN.
TWO-PUTTED 87,000 WITH THE
ADDITION OF JOBS IN DAN.
-- 287,000 JOBS WAS THE ADDITION
OF JOBS IN JUNE.
THAT WAS HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE INCREASED
FROM 4.9%.
-- FROM 4.7% TO 4.9%.
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THIS IS A LARGELY POSITIVE
REPORT, IT WAS NOT ACROSS THE
BOARD POSITIVE.
WE HAD AN INCREASE OF AVERAGE
HOURLY EARNINGS MONTH OVER MONTH
0.1%, 0.2% IS WHAT ECONOMISTS
ESTIMATING.
THE INCREASE IN WAGES WAS NOT
MATERIALIZING.
WE ARE INCREASING THE PACE OF
WAGE GROWTH, NOT MATERIALIZING.
AND THERE IS THE CONUNDRUM OF
MAY AND WHY IT WAS SO WEAK.
THE GROWTH PROVIDES -- REVISED
TO 11,000.
IT HAD BEEN 38,000, WHICH WAS A
DISAPPOINTING NUMBER.
IT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY
THE VERIZON WORKER STRIKE.
PRIVATE PAYROLLS CONTRACTED,
FELL BY 6000 IN MAY.
THAT WAS THE FIRST SINCE
FEBRUARY 2010.
IF YOU THREE-MONTH AVERAGE PACE
OF 147,000, A SLOWDOWN OF THE
PRIOR 12 MONTHS, BUT NOT AS POOR
AS SOME FOLKS HAD BEEN FEARING
FOR JUNE.
ALIX: JULIE HYMAN JOINING US
FROM WASHINGTON.
ACUTE WRAP UP.
EVERYTHING DOWN.
CHRISTIAN OR MONEY, OPERATOR OF
OPPENHEIMER FUNDS.
AND FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS
EVELYN.
IS THIS THE GREEN LIGHT TO SELL
BONDS? 
>> I HATE LOOKING AT A SINGLE
DATA POINT AND MAKING A CHOICE
LIKE THAT.
INVESTORS WILL REACT THAT WAY
TODAY, BELIEVING THE FEARS THEY
HAD GOING BACK TO LAST MONTH.
THEY ARE WILLING TO TRADE.
WE WOULD GET MORE NUMBERS AND
ANYBODY WILL FREAK OUT ON
SOMETHING ELSE.
DAVID: HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
MARKETS TO INSERT THIS? 
-- ABSORB THIS.
THINGS LIKE KNOCK ON EFFECT FROM
THE INCREASED DOLLAR.
>> PEOPLE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON
THE EARNINGS RELEASES.
THE DOLLAR WILL BE A PART OF
THAT.
I THINK COMPANIES ARE GOING TO
BE, THEY WILL BE CAUTIOUSLY
OPTIMISTIC.
THOSE WORDS ARE CRINGE WORTHY,
BUT THE NOTION THEY DON'T WANT
TO STICK TO IT IF THEY DON'T
KNOW THE EFFECTS OF EUROPE'S
ISSUES, THEY DON'T KNOW CHINA.
THEY WOULD RATHER OVERPROMISE
AND UNDER DELIVER.
ALIX: MORE FROM TOBIAS ON
BLOOMBERG RADIO.
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A 5% TO 10%
IN U.S. EQUITIES.
>> THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE
MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE U.S.
ECONOMY OR WORLD ECONOMY.
THE DRAWDOWN EXPECTATION IS
DRIVEN BY THE FACT LOOK AT
ECONOMY WAS SLOWED DOWN.
THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED, BUT IT IS
BRAQUE WERE LOOKING DATA.
-- BACKWARD LOOKING DATA.
IT WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE WE SEE
THE FULL DATA COME THROUGH.
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU ASKED
TOBIAS EARLIER, IS THIS THE
RIGHT TIME TO BE SELLING BONDS,
MIKE ANSWER WOULD BE, NO.
THE DRIVER OF A BOND IS NOT
REALLY THE U.S. CYCLICAL
ENVIRONMENT.
IT IS REALLY THE GLOBAL
DEFLATIONARY MICRA SHOCKS.
BREXIT IS WITH US AND WILL BE
WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
IT IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME
SOON.
I WOULD SAY THE MARKETS WOULD
REACT SOMEWHAT TO THIS, BUT IT
LOOKS RELATIVELY MODEST AND WILL
FADE RELATIVELY QUICKLY AS WELL.
JON: WE ARE GOING BACK UP AND
YIELDS.
WE SAW A LITTLE BIT.
A COUPLE OF BASIS POINTS.
THOSE IN THREE POSITIONS, ARE
YOU TACTICAL ABOUT THAT? 
>> THE BATTLE YOU IN THE BOND
MARKET IS REALLY GOVERNMENT --
VALUE IN THE BOND MARKET IS
REALLY IN GOVERNMENT BONDS.
WE WERE BETTER DOING HIGH-GRADE
BONDS.
AT LEAST YOU OWN SOME INCOME.
IT IS BETTER THAN WHAT YOU CAN
GET IN GOVERNMENT BONDS, WHERE
HALF THE WORLD IS NEGATIVE.
DAVID: I WANT TO GO TO STANFORD
UNIVERSITY.
ONE THING WE HAVE NOT TALKED
ABOUT IS, WE HAD THE IRONY OF
BOTH THE JOBS NUMBER GOING UP,
NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED, BUT
ALSO UNEMPLOYMENT GOING UP.
WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THAT? 
>> THOSE NUMBERS ARE VOLATILE
FOR ONE THING.
YOU GET MONTH-TO-MONTH
VARIATIONS.
THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON WE
TAKE FROM THIS PARTICULAR REPORT
IS THESE THINGS BOUNCE AROUND A
LOT.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE JOBS
GOING FROM 11,000 ONE MONTH TO
287 THOUSAND 
AND HAVING APPEALED REAL
REFLECTION -- AND HAVING THAT BE
A REAL REFLECTION OF A NUMBER.
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT 147, THE
THREE MONTH MOVING AVERAGE.
THAT IS A GOOD NUMBER.
IT IS JUST ABOUT CONSISTENT WITH
WHERE WE WANT TO BE TO KEEP UP
WITH POLITICS IT -- POPULATION
GROWTH.
SO JUST TO STAY EVEN, IT IS
ABOUT 129,000 A MONTH.
THAT WOULD KEEP US CONSTANT IN
TERMS OF ADDING ENOUGH JOBS TO
KEEP UP WITH THE POPULATION
GROWTH.
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.
THE SLIGHT UPTAKE IN EMPLOYMENT
IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.
TO ME, THOSE NUMBERS STILL
SUGGEST THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT
AN ECONOMY THAT IS NEAR PEAK
EMPLOYMENT.
AND SO, IF THAT WERE THE CASE,
IF WE TURN TO THESE NUMBERS AND
WE BELIEVE THESE NUMBERS, WE
SAY, WE ARE NEAR THE PEAK.
WE HAVE BASICALLY RECOVERED.
WAGE GROWTH PICKED UP A LITTLE
BIT, OUR ESTIMATE IS 34.4%.
THAT IS KIND OF HIGH WHEN YOUR
NEW THE TOP OF THE BUSINESS
CYCLE.
EVERYTHING LOOKS RIGHT.
ONE PROBLEM, UNEMPLOYMENT IS
VERY LOW.
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.
ALIX: SO HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE
FROM FULL EMPLOYMENT? 
>> USING THE EMPLOYMENT RATE, WE
ARE DOWN 4 MILLION OR 5 MILLION
JOBS.
A LOT, OBVIOUSLY.
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DEMOGRAPHIC,
HOW MUCH IS REFLECTING THINGS
THAT ARE REAL IN THE ECONOMY? 
MY CALCULATIONS SUGGEST THAT
EVEN IF WE CORRECT FOR
DEMOGRAPHICS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
CURRENT HIRING RATE, THE ON
EMPLOYMENT RATE, RATHER THAN
BEING 4.8%, 4.9%, WHICH IS
PROBABLY HIDE -- FIVE.
MORE LIKE 5.8%.
THAT FEELS MORE CONSISTENT WITH
THE KIND OF ECONOMY WE HAVE
RIGHT NOW WITH GROWTH RATES WE
HAVE SEEN, WAGE GROWTH, AND
EMPLOYMENT.
THAT IS PROBABLY THE CORRECT ON
IMPLEMENT RATE, BUT --
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, BUT WE HAVE
COME A LONG WAY FROM 10%
UNEMPLOYMENT.
NO DOUBT WE RECOVERED ON THE
GROUND WE HAD LOST.
DAVID: PICKING UP ON WHAT ED IS
TALKING ABOUT, THAT
UNDEREMPLOYMENT NUMBER, ACCOUNT
FOR THE FACT WE ARE NOT SEEING
ROBUST WAGE GROWTH? 
EVEN 0.2% IS NOT VERY ROBUST.
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND THAT IS WHY
THE FED IS FOCUSED ON WAGE
GROWTH FAR MORE THAN ON
IMPLEMENT NUMBER ITSELF.
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER IS VERY
CONTINGENT ON PARTICIPATION
RATES AND A LOT OF OTHER
FACTORS.
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS
GOING TO BE IN WAGE GROWTH.
IF IT IS NOT THERE, WE ARE NOT
AS STRESSED THE FROM AND ON
APPOINTMENT STANDPOINT AS WE
MAKE BE BASED ON NUMBERS YOU SEE
IN A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.
ALIX: OPPENHEIMER FUNDS STAYING
WITH US AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY.
I SHOULD POINT OUT THE 10 YEAR
YIELD GOING NEGATIVE NOW.
1.37%.
THAT BOND SELLOFF NOT CONTINUING
FOR THE 10 YEAR.
NOW FOR A LOOK AT WORLD AND
NATIONAL NEWS, LET'S GO TO EMMA
CHANDRA.
REPORTER: A PEACEFUL
DEMONSTRATION IN DALLAS TURNS
DEADLY FOR POLICE.
SNIPERS KILLED FIVE POLICE
OFFICERS INTEGRATED SEVEN
OTHERS.
-- AND WOUNDED SEVEN OTHERS.
THEY DEMONSTRATED AGAINST RECENT
POLICE SHOOTINGS.
DALLAS POLICE CHIEF DAVID BROWN
CALL THIS AN AMBUSH.
CHIEF BROWN: THE SUSPECTS WERE
POSSESSING THEMSELVES TO
TRANSLATE ON THE OFFICERS ON TWO
DIFFERENT PERCHES IN GARAGES IN
THE DOWNTOWN AREA, AND PLANNED
TO OFFER CERTAIN -- INJURE AS
MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AS
THEY COULD.
REPORTER: THREE SUSPECTS HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED.
A FOURTH EXCHANGE TO WITH
POLICE.
OFFICIALS NOW SAY HE IS DEAD.
PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKED ABOUT
THIS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: THERE WAS NO
POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE
KINDS OF ATTACKS OR ANY VIOLENCE
AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THE FBI IS ALREADY IN TOUCH WITH
THE DALLAS POLICE AND ANYONE
INVOLVED IN THE SENSELESS
MURDERS WILL BE HELD FULLY
ACCOUNTABLE.
JUSTICE WILL BE DONE.
REPORTER: DALLAS POLICE ARE
URGING PEOPLE TO AVOID THE
DOWNTOWN AREA TODAY.
THERE IS A TEMPORARY HALT IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
HILLARY CLINTON HAS CANCELED AN
EVENT SCHEDULED IN PENNSYLVANIA.
SHE WAS GOING TO APPEAR WITH
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
SHE WILL STILL SPEAK AT A CHURCH
IN PHILADELPHIA.
DONALD TRUMP BUT HIS PLANS ON
HOLD.
HE CANCELED A SPEECH IN MIAMI.
AND IN THE U.K., THERESA MAY
SAYS IT IS TIME FOR HER TO MAKE
THE CASE WHY SHE SHOULD MAKE THE
NEXT PRIME MINISTER.
SHE AND ANOTHER WILL FACE OFF IN
A BATTLE LED BY DAVID CAMERON.
SHE WON THE SECOND ROUND AMONG
LAWMAKERS AND PARTY MEMBERS WILL
MAKE THE FINAL DECISION.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY
POWERED BY MORE THAN 2600
JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS IN MORE
THAN 120 COUNTRIES.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
JON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
COMING UP, WE CONTINUE THE PAPER
FRIDAY.
THE OF THE OFFICER OF FIXED
INCOME AND THE COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS.
FUTURES FORMER AHEAD OF THE OPEN
IN NEW YORK CITY.
13 MINUTES AWAY.
â™ª
DAVID: WE ARE NOW BREAKING NEWS
THAT THE CAPITAL BUILDING IN
WASHINGTON DC IS UNDER LOCKDOWN.
SERGEANT AT ARMS IS BLOCKING IT
DOWN.
THE HOUSE WAS IN SESSION BRIEFLY
BUT IS NOT OUT OF THE BUILDING.
THERE IS A REPORT FROM CAPITALS
POLICE AND ARE SEARCHING FOR AN
INDIVIDUAL.
IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.
SOMETIMES IT IS JUST A SIMPLE
PERSON WHO GETS ON THE GROUND,
THEY NEED TO EVER HAND.
WE DON'T KNOW DETAILS, SO WE
WILL MONITOR THIS AND REPORT AS
DEVELOPMENTS HAPPEN.
JON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE WILL STAY ON TOP OF THIS
RIGHT HERE AT BLOOMBERG.
WE ARE 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE
CASH OPEN IN NEW YORK CITY.
THIS IS HOW WE TRADE POSTED
JOBS.
FUTURES FIRMER, 12 POINTS IN THE
S&P 500, DOW 1.5% AS WELL.
WE THOUGHT GAINS 20 MINUTES AGO,
POST JOB SESSION HIGHS, THE DAX
UP.
FASCINATING MOVES IN A BOND
MARKET ON THE PAYROLLS NUMBER.
IT WAS UP ACROSS THE CURVE, NOW
YIELD DOWN ON THE 10 YEAR, ONE
BASIS POINT.
AGO FOR THE CURVE FLATTENING
AGAIN OVER THE FRONT AND COMING
UP AND ACROSS THE BELLY AND INTO
THE LONGER END OF THE CURVE,
COMING DOWN.
WE ARE DEVELOPING TRADE AT THE
MOMENT.
THE DOLLAR-YEN 123, AND CABLE
RATE PUSHING TO 129.85.
WITH MORE ON THE JOB REPORT IS
QUESTION OF OPPENHEIMER FUNDS.
WE WILL GET YOU VERY QUICKLY.
MY FIRST QUESTION IS TO MICHAEL
MCKAY.
HE SAID TO BILL GROSS, WHAT
WOULD IT TAKE TO WATCH THE NEXT
BAD NEWS CONFERENCE, GIVEN THE
MARKET IS SET TO DO ANYTHING FOR
TWO YEARS? 
IS ENOUGH TO PAY MORE ATTENTION?
>> NOT REALLY, THE ECONOMIC,
BACKWARD ECONOMIC DATA HAS BEEN
STEADY.
BUT THAT IS NOT THE DRIVER.
THE DRIVER A BOND MARKETS AND
WHAT THE FED IS GOING TO DO IS
WHAT HAPPENS ON A GLOBAL BASIS.
AND THE NEWS IS CLEAR, WE ARE
STILL FULL OF BREXIT RELATED
UNCERTAINTY, AND THAT WILL BE
THE DRIVER OF CONDITIONS IN THE
U.S..
DAVID: SO PROFESSOR FROM
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, AS WE LOOK
AT HIS JOBS IN A LARGER CONTEXT
OF WHERE THE ECONOMY IS NOW
WHERE IT IS HEADING, DO YOU SEE
GROWTH? 
>> I ALWAYS USE THE MARKET AS MY
BEST INDICATOR OF GROWTH.
THE MARKET IS TELLING US THAT WE
ARE LOOKING AT THE NEXT FOUR
QUARTERS OF ABOUT 2% TO 2.5
PERCENT.
IF YOU BELIEVE MARKET NUMBERS,
WHAT IS GOING ON, THAT IS KIND
OF WHERE WE ARE.
THAT WILL BE CONSISTENT WHERE WE
STAND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE
RECOVERY.
PICKING UP ON CHRISTIANS POINT
ABOUT THE FED AND THEIR
SITUATION, THEY ARE IN A BIND
RIGHT NOW.
THE REASON IS IF YOU BELIEVE
THESE NUMBERS, THE JOB NUMBERS,
GROWTH NUMBERS, EVERYTHING GOING
ON IN THE ECONOMY, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE RECOVERY HAS KIND OF PLAYED
ITSELF OUT.
WE ARE AT A PEAK.
HOPEFULLY IT IS THE PLATEAU AND
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK DOWN.
WHEN DOES THE FED RAISE RATES? 
THEY DO NOT RAISE THE MAP A PEAK
.
THEY RAISE RATES DURING THE
RECOVERY.
IF THAT IS ESSENTIALLY OVER, AND
THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE THE
RECOVERY IS OVER AND WE ARE IN
AN UNSURE PHASE, THE FED IS IN A
BIND.
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO BE
RAISING RATES.
THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT TWO TO
THREE YEARS AGO, AND NOW THEY
ARE STUCK AND HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT JANET
AND OTHER FED GOVERNORS FACE
RIGHT NOW.
WE WILL SEE HOW THEY HANDLE IT.
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE KIND OF
BEHIND THE CURVE ON THIS ONE.
DAVID: SO THIS WAS THE FISCAL
STIMULUS, AND WE ALWAYS WANT
THAT.
IT NEVER HAPPENS.
IS IT POSSIBLE WITH TAX REFORM? 
>> IT IS POSSIBLE.
THE REAL QUESTION IS, IS IT
LIKELY? 
IT IS PROBABLY LESS LIKELY THAT
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.
THE FISCAL POLICY IS SOMETHING
WE TALK ABOUT A LOT, BUT GIVEN
THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, IT IS
UNLIKELY WE HAVE SEEN MUCH OF
IT.
ALIX: WHAT TURNS MORE, CREDIT OR
EQUITIES? 
>> CREDIT.
GROWTH SLOWS DOWN AND VALUATIONS
ARE RICH.
CREDIT CAN BE CARRIED.
WHEN RATES ARE LOW, SPREAD
WIDENING POTENTIAL GOES DOWN
BECAUSE OF THIS SLOWER THING.
CREDIT IS THE BEST CHOICE.
ALIX: WE WANT TO GO TO THE NEW
YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
THEY ARE TAKING A MOMENT OF
SILENCE FOR THE POLICE KILLED.
ALIX: THAT WAS A MOMENT OF
THOUGHT EXCHANGE SILENCE.
-- STOCK EXCHANGE SILENCE.
FIVE POLICE'S WERE KILLED BY
SNIPERS, OTHERS WOUNDED,
INCLUDING CIVILIANS.
ED LOZIER IS STILL WITH US FROM
STANFORD.
WHEN WE DO CONTINUE TO GET THESE
STRONGER JOB NUMBERS, DOES THERE
COME A POINT WHEN THE FED IS
BEHIND IN THE CURVE, IF THEY
SAID IT WAS MAY, THEY WOULD TAKE
THAT RATE HIKE OFF THE TABLE? 
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF
THE FED, THAT IS THE BEST
INDICATOR.
WHAT SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN
DOING, WHEN SHOULD THEY HAVE
BEEN DOING IT? 
IN RETROSPECT, IN HINDSIGHT,
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RAISING
BEFORE.
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DIDN'T THEY
DO THAT? 
IT COMES BACK TO WHAT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE HOUR.
WHILE A NUMBER OF THE INDICATORS
LOOK PRETTY GOOD AND SEEMED TO
INDICATE THE PEAK, THE PEAK IS
NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE.
THE IMPLEMENT THE -- THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS BELOW WHERE
IT SHOULD BE.
THE LABOR MARKET IS 59.6%.
THAT MEANS THE LABOR PEOPLE ROSE
TO THE WORKING AGE POPULATION IS
59.6 PERCENT.
IT SHOULD BE 61.5%, AND THAT IS
CORRECTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS
SESSION NUMBER, OF COUPLE
PERCENTAGE POINTS EVEN ABOVE
THAT.
CORRECTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICS, WE
SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER TWO
PERCENTAGE POINTS.
THE FED KNOWS THAT.
THEY HAVE KNOWN THAT ALL ALONG.
IT HAS BEEN THAT NUMBER MORE
THAN ANY OTHER THAT HAS KEPT
THEM FROM RAISING RATES.
THEY LOOK FOR THIS THING TO MOVE
BACK TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE,
AND IT HAS NOT GOTTEN THEIR.
WE MAY BE RECOVERING, BUT WE ARE
STILL NOT BACK TO WHERE WE NEED
TO BE.
IT IS FOR THAT REASON THEY HAVE
BEEN RELUCTANT TO RAISE RATES.
AS A RESULT, NOW THEY ARE IN A
FIX.
JON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
JOINING THIS PROGRAM AND GIVING
US YOUR INSIGHT ON THE JOB
REPORT AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE.
AND CHRISTIAN OF OPPENHEIMER
FUNDS STILL WITH US.
LOOKING AT THE CONVERSATION OF
THE LAST HOUR, THIS IS HOW IT IS
EXPRESSING ITSELF OVER THE
TREASURY CURVE.
IT IS FLAT.
WE JUST DROP BELOW 250 BASIS
POINTS.
THE BUYERS, THEY STILL BY THE
LONG END, AND THE BIAS IS A MUCH
FODDER YIELD CURVE.
-- FLATTER YIELD CURVE.
HOW MUCH LONGER DOES THIS PLAY
OUT? 
CHRISTIAN:
I THINK THIS WILL BE WITH US FOR
A LONG TIME.
THE DRIVER OF THE STORY IS
EFFECTIVELY THE FIFTH ASSET
SHORTAGE WE HAD ON A GLOBAL
BASIS.
IT IS NOT JUST COMING FROM U.S. 
IT IS COMING FROM JAPAN, MOST OF
ALL, U.K. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE
WORLD.
THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME
SOON.
THAT DOES NOT SAY NOTHING ABOUT
THE JOBS NUMBER IN THE EU ON ANY
PARTICULAR DAY.
JON: HOW FLAT CAN IT GET? 
CHRISTIAN: IT CAN GET STILL A
LOT FLATTER.
HISTORICALLY, THE CURVE IS
REASONABLY STEEP.
IT IS A FLAT, OR IT SEEMS FLAT
BECAUSE 
BUT I THINK IT CAN GET A LOT
FLATTER.
JON: CHRISTIAN, GREAT TO HAVE
YOU WITH US.
DAVID, WITH SOME BREAKING NEWS.
DAVID: TO KEEP YOU UPDATED ON
THE STORY OUT OF THE CAPITAL
BUILDING, WE HAVE REPORT FROM A
REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS,
DENNIS ROSS, WHO IS SAYING WHAT
HAPPENED WAS A STAFF MEMBER FROM
THE HILL TRY TO ENTER THE
PREMISES WITH A GUN AND WAS
APPREHENDED PRESUMABLY.
THEY HAVE IT ON LOCKDOWN.
THEY WERE SCHEDULED FOR A HOUSE
VOTE AT 9:15 EASTERN, 10 MINUTES
AGO, WHICH HAS BEEN POSTPONED.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU
UP-TO-DATE FROM NEW DEVELOPMENTS
FROM THE CAPITAL AS THEY COOKER.
JOINING US NOW IS JONAS PRIZING
OF MANUS.
HE PROVIDES CONSULTING AROUND
THE GLOBE.
WE HAVE NUMBERS COMING OUT.
YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL SURVEY FROM
EMPLOYERS.
IF YOU MAKE OF THESE NUMBERS? 
JONAS: WE THINK THE ARE
CONSISTENT WITH A SLOW GROWTH
ECONOMY, A GOOD LABOR MARKET
THAT STILL HAS SOME SLACK.
YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNCING AROUND
BETWEEN MAY AND JUNE.
WE LOOK AT THE THREE-MONTH
AVERAGE, A SOLID NUMBER, ALMOST
150,000.
THERE IS WAGE INFLATION, WE
EXPECT MORE WAGE INFLATION GOING
FORWARD.
ALL OF THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH A
GOOD LABOR MARKET.
THERE IS STILL IS ROOM TO GO
BECAUSE OF THE WORK FORCE RATE
AT A HISTORICAL LOW.
DAVID: TICKY BEHIND THE SCENES
OF THIS SURVEY YOU DID.
11,000 EMPLOYERS, TELL US WHAT
YOU FOUND WHEN YOU TALKED TO
EMPLOYERS.
JONAS: WHEN WE SURVEYED 11,000
EMPLOYERS, WE ASKED A SIMPLE
QUESTION.
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE NEXT
QUARTER, WHAT ARE YOUR HIRING
FUNCTIONS? A LIGHT YOU GOING TO
INCREASE OR DECREASE OR HOLD IT
STABLE? 
SO WITH RESPONSE THE THIRD
QUARTER, EMPLOYERS ARE STILL
OPTIMISTIC.
IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR AFTER YEAR
OUTLOOK, IT IS SLIGHTLY SOFTER,
BUT OVERALL AT A GOOD LEVEL.
EMPLOYERS LOOK AHEAD TO THE
FOURTH QUARTER, THEY ARE LOOKING
AT A STABLE SITUATION AS FAR AS
THEIR BUSINESS OUTLOOK IS
CONCERNED AND THEY WILL BUY
LARGE AND HIGHER.
DAVID: TAKE US BELOW THE
NUMBERS.
BREAK THEM OUT.
DO YOU SEE VARIATIONS REGION TO
REGION? 
JONAS: WE SEE THIS IS NOTABLE.
WE SEE STRENGTH ON THE EAST
COAST.
THEN IT MOVES OVER TO THE WEST
COAST.
IT HEADED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE
COUNTRY.
THIS TIME IT IS WELL JUST SHOULD
BE DID.
YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
VARIOUS SECTORS.
THE ENERGY OUTLOOK IS DIFFERENT,
MINING, ANYTHING RELATED TO THE
CONSUMER IS MUCH STRONGER.
AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE AND
RETAIL, THOSE ARE SECTORS WHERE
THE EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK IS
STRONGER.
DAVID: YOU DO THIS REGULARLY.
YOU HAVE NOT REALLY SEEN AN
UPWARD TREND IN THIS.
IS THAT CORRECT? 
THIS IS REASONABLY STABLE OVER
TIME? 
THIS WILL IMPROVE GOING OUT? 
JONAS: IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE
DONE FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS,
SURVEYED EMPLOYERS IN THIS WAY
IN THE U.S. 
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, OUTLOOK FOR
THE THIRD QUARTER IS STABLE, SO
THERE IS NOT AN ANTICIPATED
INCREASE, BUT ALSO NOT DECREASE.
IT IS CONSISTENT WHAT YOU WOULD
EXPECT IN A SLOW GROWTH ECONOMY
WHERE A NUMBER OF PARTS OF THE
ECONOMY ARE STILL DOING WELL,
AND THE CONSUMER IS DRIVING GOOD
ECONOMIC GROWTH AS WELL AS LABOR
MARKET STABILITY AND
IMPROVEMENT.
DAVID: YOU ALSO DO A SURVEY
SIMILAR TO THIS WORLDWIDE.
COMPARED THE UNITED STATES WITH
WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND OVERSEAS.
JONAS: WE SURVEYED 60,000
EMPLOYERS WORLDWIDE IN OVER 50
COUNTRIES.
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A CHALKY
ENVIRONMENT.
IF YOU LOOK AT EUROPE, THE
OUTCOME ON THE WHOLE IS SLIGHTLY
SOFTER.
AND THEN YOU HAVE REGIONAL
DIFFERENCES.
GERMANY IS STRONG, IRELAND IS
STRONG, SPAIN AND GREECE ARE
WEEK.
U.K. STABLE, BUT AT A LOWER
RATE.
IT IS A MIXED PICTURE.
INDIA IS VERY STRONG, JAPAN IS
HOLDING STEADY WITH CHINA
SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.
IT IS A MIXED PICTURE.
OVERALL, I WOULD SAY THE
EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK IN THE THIRD
QUARTER IS STABLE TO FINALLY
SOFTER.
DAVID: THAT IS JONAS BREEZING,
CEO OF MANUS GROUP.
JON: THANK YOU.
287 K IS THE JOB NUMBER.
THIS IS THE SCENE AS WE APPROACH
THE CASH OPEN IN NEW YORK CITY.
LET'S GO TO THE BOARD.
FUTURES REMAIN FIRM, S&P 500
TEACHERS UP.
20 SECONDS AWAY FROM THE OPEN.
THE FTSE UP 0.5%.
THE EUROPEAN EQUITIES HAD A WEEK
OF LOSSES.
YOU HEAR THE BELL, SO SWITCH UP
THE BOARD.
QUICKLY.
DOLLAR-YEN 1 -- 100 POINT 49.
WE CAME BACK AGAIN, THE CABLE
RATE PUSHING UP TO 129.74,
APPROACHING 130.
DOLLAR-YEN 100.46.
THERE WAS FOUR OR FIVE BASIS
POINTS AROUND THE CURVE, NOW WE
ARE UNCHANGED AT 4.9%.
WTI, THE BIGGEST WEEK OF LOSSES
SINCE FEBRUARY.
ALMOST SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS.
SECTION ACROSS IT SINCE BECOME A
LESLEY AT THE MARKET AND GET THE
MOVERS HE.
HERE IS RAMY INOCENCIO.
RAMY: INITIAL REACTION AFTER
STELLAR JOB NUMBERS CAME OUT AT
8:30 A.M. 
THE DOW IS UP 0.8%, S&P UP 0.7%.
THE NASDAQ, UP AS WELL.
BLOWING UP THE HIGHEST ESTIMATES
, 287,000.
INTERESTING STUFF.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WAS
HAPPENING WITH S&P 500 FUTURES
AS WELL.
YOU CAN SEE 8:30 A.M., WHEN WE
GET THIS LEG UP, NUMBERS CAME
UP. WE SAW NUMBERS WITH THE ESA
AS WELL.
LET'S SEE WHERE WE ARE IN TERM
OF THE S&P 500 BASED ON THE POST
BREXIT VOTE BACK ON JUNE 24.
COMING BACK FROM JUNE 23, ALL
THE WAY UNTIL TODAY, LESS THAN
0.1%, THE 2113 NUMBERS WHILE
RECOUPING ALL OF THE LOSSES EVER
SINCE THEN.
LET'S LOOK AT SAFE HAVENS,
PARTICULARLY GOLD.
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, WE DO SEE A
LEG DOWN JUST AT 8:30, BUT THAT
WAS A SHORT-LIVED LITTLE EVENT.
GOLD IS NO CLIMBING JUST A HAIR
ABOVE ON THE POSITIVE LINE,
$1371 IS WHERE WE POP UP.
NOW $3063.
-- $1363.
ALIX: WE HAVE THE BLACKROCK CIO
OF FIXED INCOME JOINS US.
HE MANAGES TO $.3 TRILLION IN
FIXED INCOME ASSETS.
USE SELLING SHORT END OF THE
BUYING THE LONG END OF THE
CURVE? 
>> I THINK THAT IS LONGER THAN
THE TRADE OF THE DAY.
I THINK THAT CURVE WILL KEEP
FLATTENING.
THAT DYNAMIC WHEN THE DEMAND FOR
THE LONG INTEREST RATES AND
GROWTH WHERE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
YIELD IS A STURDY VERY.
THAT KEEPS PRESSURE IN THE BACK
AND THE FRONT IS TOO HIGH.
WE WERE PRICING IN A CUT.
MARKETS ARE PRICING IN A CUT IF
YOU GO BACK A FEW DAYS, THAT IS
CRAZY.
THE FED IS NOT IN ANY MOOD TO
CUT RATES.
THEY HAVE MORE ROOM TO GO.
WE SEE FLATTENING.
JON: LET'S GET A RED HEADLINE,
DOUBT REACHED 4.8%.
LOOKING AT THE CURVE, FLAT,
FLAT.
I WONDER HOW FLAT.
WE ARE AROUND 200 BASIS POINTS,
HOW FLAT REALLY GO? 
-- WILL IT GO? 
RICK: IF YOU GO BACK IN HISTORY,
WE ARE AT A REASONABLY STEEP
YIELD CURVE FOR AN ECONOMY
OPERATING AT A DECENT LEVEL.
CAN WE GET ANOTHER 20, 25 BASIS
POINTS TO FLATTEN? 
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
ONE END OF THE CURVE IS NOT
CHEAP, BUT ORGANICALLY CHEAP FOR
THE INFLATION RATES.
THE FRONT END IS TOO HIGH, THERE
COULD BE BACK UP IN THE OTHER
END, GET 20, 25 OUT OF IT.
JON: TALK TO ME ABOUT DURATION
RISK AND HOW THINGS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE BIT OVERDONE IN SOME
WAYS? 
RICK: IF YOU TAKE AWAY WHAT IS
FAIR VALUE OF THE 10 YEAR, IT IS
WELL BACK, 50 TO 75 BACK OF
WHERE THESE LEVELS ARE.
BUT WE ARE NOT GETTING BACK TO
FAIR VALUE ANYTIME SOON.
THE PRESSURE IN TERMS OF THE
NEED FOR YIELD.
THINK ABOUT POST BREXIT.
YOU TOOK ONE COUNTRY, THE OTHER
MAJOR ECONOMY THAT WAS IN THE
EU, A TIGHTENING MODE, HAS
SUGGESTED EASING.
SO NOW IT IS EASY TO GET YIELDS,
SO THE 10 YEAR STAYS IN THIS
RANGE.
ANY NEGATIVE NEWS ON THE ECONOMY
OR POLITICAL WILL PUSH DOWN A
BIT.
THE KEY OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT A
LOT IS, HOW DO YOU GET INCOME
OUT OF FIXED INCOME? 
THE NUMBER WAS GOOD FOR KERRY
ASSETS, CREDIT MARKETS, EMERGING
MARKETS.
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD ARGUE,
CLOSE TO A GOOD NUMBER FOR
EMERGING MARKETS.
EMERGING MARKETS TO NOT REACT
TERRIBLY TO BREXIT.
THEY HELD UP ALL RIGHT.
GIVEN THE FACT THERE WAS NO
YIELD TO BE FOUND IN THE REST OF
THE WORLD, IT SEEMS LIKE, IS
THAT A POINT TO MAKE NOW FOR THE
EMERGING MARKETS? 
>> THE HARD THING ABOUT EMERGING
MARKETS IS A MONIKER.
USUALLY AVERAGE YIELD, YOU FEEL
GOOD ABOUT INVESTING.
YOU GET INTO THE INDIVIDUAL
NAMES.
THERE ARE SOME TOUGH STORIES.
YOU HAVE AN ECONOMY OPERATING AT
A DECENT LEVEL, WHICH THE U.S.
IS, AND WE ARE SEEING GROWTH IN
THE EMERGING WORLD STABILIZING
AT LEVELS, THAT IS GOOD.
NOT OVERHEATING GROWTH.
YOU GO IN AND THINK ABOUT WHICH
PARTS OF THE EMERGING MARKETS,
ASIA, INDIA WE HAVE LIKED QUITE
A BIT.
WE'VE BEEN ADDING TO BRAZIL A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND
ARGENTINA.
BUT GENERICALLY, HAS YOU SAID,
YOU CAN GET YIELD AND REAL
RATES.
SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES WILL
HAVE TO EASE AND WHERE THEY ARE.
DAVID: MEXICO, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH MEXICO? 
RICK: A TRICKY DYNAMIC.
WE TALKED ABOUT A MONTH AGO OR
SO, IT IS A NAME WE HAVE LIKED.
THAT BEING SAID, WE REDUCED
EXPOSURE OVER TIME, FOR NO OTHER
REASON THAN GETTING TO A STABLE
ECONOMY, GROWTH AND INFLATION
READY GOOD.
CERTAINLY SOME CHALLENGES AROUND
THE CURRENCY, BUT TECHNICALS IN
THE MARKET ARE NOT TERRIFIC.
IT HAS BEEN A TRICKY ONE.
THE OUTSET'S ARE REASONABLE.
THAT IS ONE OF THE CHEAPER
PLACES TO GO.
THERE MAY BE A LOT OF TIME
BEFORE RETURN IS POSITIVE IN
TERMS OF MEXICO GOING FORWARD.
DAVID: WE WANT TO GO NOW TO
JASON FROEMMING, THE COUNCIL
ECONOMIC CHAIRMAN.
WELCOME DR. FUHRMAN.
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.
DAVID: WE WERE SURPRISED BY
THESE JOBS NUMBER.
WERE YOU SURPRISED? 
>> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE
SURPRISED.
THESE NUMBER IS BOUNCE AROUND A
LOT.
WE ARE NOT GOOD AT MEASURING THE
ECONOMY AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BE,
SO WE SHOULD DO PRETEND WE CAN
DO THAT REALLY WELL.
WE ARE ADDING JOBS AT THE PACE
OF 150,000 JOBS A MONTH.
THAT IS MILD DECLINE IN THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE GIVEN
WHERE WE ARE IN THE ECONOMY
RIGHT NOW.
DAVID: SOUTH IS THE
PARTICIPATION RATE AND CONCERNS
ABOUT THAT, PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED
IT IS TWO OR THREE POINTS BELOW
WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE.
ARE YOU CONCERNED? 
JASON: THE LARGEST THING THAT IS
GOING ON IS THE AGING OF THE
POPULATION.
ABOVE AND BEYOND THE AGING, I
THINK WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED
THAT THE PARTICIPATION RATE HAS
BEEN FALLING FOR 60 YEARS,
ADJUSTED FOR AGE FOR MEN, AND 15
YEARS ADJUSTED FOR AGE FOR
WOMEN.
THERE IS A LONG-TERM ISSUE IN
TERMS OF FUNCTIONING OF THE
LABOR MARKET.
YOU ARE THAT WE HAVE SEEN
RECENTLY.
WE PARTICIPATION RATE STABILIZE,
AND THAT IS BECAUSE DEMOGRAPHY
IS DRAGGING IN ONE DIRECTION.
THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY IS
PULLING PEOPLE BACK, AND THEY
ARE CANCELING OUT.
IN THE SHORT RUN, I FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT, BUT WE NEED A BIGGER
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LONG-RUN
TRENDS.
RICK: NASTY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY -- I
WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.
THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN LOW, WHICH
IS INDICATIVE OF A VERY GOOD
LABOR MARKET.
THE DISPERSION BETWEEN MAY AND
JUNE WAS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING.
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT? 
JASON: IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THE
ECONOMY WAS REALLY TERRIBLE IN
MAY AND REALLY GREAT IN JIM.
I THINK EVERY GEOS -- EVERYTHING
THERE WAS INSISTENT WITH INTO
GATORS.
THE -- OTHER INDICATORS.
THERE IS A RANGE OF ECONOMIC
DATA.
THEY ARE HOUSING AROUND AS LESS
THEY DID IN THE PAST.
-- BOUNCING AROUND LESS THAN
THEY DID IN THE PAST.
ALIX: I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CHART
ON THE BLOOMBERG.
IF YOU LOOK AT BLOOMBERG, IT IS
NON-FIRM PAYROLL NUMBERS,
287,000 FOR JUNE.
THERE IS THE UNDERLYING, THE RED
LINE, 147,000.
THE FIRST QUARTER WAS 200,000.
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE PACE,
THE OVERALL PACE? 
JASON: WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STAYING LOW
AND PEOPLE GETTING WAGE GAINS.
4.9% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE
LAST 10 YEAR, WAGES UP 2.6% HIM
A THAT IS TIED FOR THE FASTEST
PACE OF NOMINAL WAGE GROWTH IN
THE RECOVERY.
WE SIMPLY DON'T NEED TO ADD AS
MANY JOBS TO GET THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHERE IT IS OR
FROM TRENDING DOWN.
THE REASON WE ARE ADDING IS
BECAUSE THE IN EMPLOYMENT RATE
WAS SO HIGH.
IT WAS A SYSTEM OF HOW MUCH WORK
WE NEEDED TO DO.
WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO, BUT
NOT AS MUCH.
IT IS QUITE NATURAL, EXPECTED,
AND I FEEL GOOD.
DAVID: THIS IS A DIFFERENT
SUBJECT, BUT ON ALL OF OUR
MINDS.
THAT IS THE TRAGIC SHOOTING OF
THE POLICE OFFICERS IN DALLAS
OVERNIGHT.
WOULD YOU GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS
OF THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS
SUBJECT.
JASON: THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS
A VICIOUS CALCULATED AND
DESPICABLE ATTACK.
HE IS BEING UPDATED ON IT WHILE
HE IS OVERSEAS, AND THAT
REFLECTS THE THOUGHTS OF ALL OF
US HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
DAVID: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT IS JASON FURMAN, COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS CHAIRMAN.
I KNOW WE WILL COME BACK WITH
RICK READER AND BLACK.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
DAVID: THIS IS "BLOOMBERG .
COMING UP, ELIAN'S -- ALLIANCE
CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR, MOHAMED
EL-ERIAN.
â™ª
JON: MRS. BLOOMBERG.
COMING UP ON "BLOOMBERG MARKETS
IS VONNIE QUINN.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT COMING UP? 
VONNIE: WE ARE HAVING MOHAMED
EL-ERIAN ABOUT THE JOBS REPORT
TO SEE IF THIS STABILIZES
MARKETS.
WE HAVE SEEN THE DOUBT GOING
DOWN, BUT THERE WAS SOME THINGS
IN THE REPORT THAT MIGHT MAKE US
MORE NERVOUS.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TICKED UP.
THERE WAS NOT MUCH WAGE GROWTH.
HE WILL ADDRESS THESE.
WE WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING LATER
ON THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION.
JON: LOOKING FORWARD.
DAVID: ONE TO BRING INTO TO THE
STORY OF THE CAPITAL LOCKED
DOWN.
THE LOCKDOWN ORDER HAS BEEN
LIFTED.
A CAPITOL HILL STAFFER TRIED TO
GET TO WORK, AND THEN THERE WAS
A LOT DOWN BECAUSE HE BROUGHT A
GUN.
LET'S GET A LOOK AT THE MOVERS
WITH RAMY INOCENCIO.
RAMY: I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THE S&P AND THE DOW.
WE BOTH REFUTE THEIR LOSSES
AFTER THE POST BREXIT VOTE OFF
OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF
MARKETS TODAY.
I WANT TO GET TO SOME MOVERS
RIGHT NOW, AND FIRST ANALYST
ACTION IN TERMS OF
MICROPROCESSING AS WELL AS
COMPUTERS.
ADVANCED DEVICES DOWN ONE POINT
FOR PERCENT BECAUSE BERNSTEIN
HAS DECIDED TO CUT ITS READING
ON THE COMPANY TO UNDERPERFORM
FROM MARKET PERFORM, SAYING THE
GROWTH MAY NOT MEET
EXPECTATIONS.
AS FOR BERNSTEIN, AS FOR INTEL,
IT IS GOING UP 1.8%.
THAT IS BECAUSE BERNSTEIN IS
RAISING ITS INTEL FROM
UNDERPERFORM TO OVER PERFORM.
IT WILL NOT COMMIT SECOND ORDER
EARNINGS BECAUSE OF RECOVERY IN
THE PC EARNINGS MARKET.
LET'S GO TO THE CLOSING SPACE --
CLOTHING SPACE.
GAP IS UP.
THIS IS THE HIGHEST IN THE PAST
TWO MONTHS.
THIS IS UP SURPRISE JUMP IN
COMPS SALES, VERSUS THE ESTIMATE
OF NEGATIVE 3.6% VERSUS CAP
LOCALS, OLD NAVY, THEY ALL BE
THEIR BEST.
OLD NAVY UP 5%, YEAR ON YEAR
VERSUS JUNE.
THANK YOU.
16 MINUTES INTO THE SECTION -- 
JON: 16 MINUTES INTO THE
SESSION, LOOKING AT THE NASDAQ,
ABIGAIL DOOLITTLE.
REPORTER: FITTING TO THAT, LET'S
START UP WITH THE BIG WINNERS AT
THE NASDAQ.
POLY CO. SHARES ARE UP 13%.
THE COMPANY IS GOING TO BE
ACQUIRED BY SEROUS CAPITAL.
A 12 OR 15% PREMIUM TO
YESTERDAY'S CLOSE, AND POLYCOM
IS ABOUT THAT.
THIS DID IMPACT WITH MIKE STILL.
THERE IS SHAREHOLDER RELIEF THAT
DID NOT GET THROUGH.
AND TRADING SHARPLY HIGHER,
BARRACUDA NETWORKS.
THEY BEAT FIRST ORDER ESTIMATES
EARNINGS BY 15%, 82%.
THEY ALSO RAISE THE FULL-YEAR
OUTLOOK.
SECURITY STOCKS DID NOT RISE AS
WELL.
AND ANOTHER THING, WD-40, THE
SPRAY COMPANY IS DOWN AFTER THEY
MISSED FISCAL THIRD-QUARTER
ESTIMATES.
SHARES ARE SHARPLY HIGHER, SO
THIS COULD IMPACT THE STOCK
PICKERS DID LIGHT.
ALIX: RICK READER STILL WITH US
FROM BLACKROCK, CIO OF GLOBAL
FIXED INCOME.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
FLATTENING OF THE YIELD CURVE,
LEADING INVESTORS INTO PLACES
LIKE HIGH-YIELD.
BANK OF AMERICA, BULLISH ON
TECHNICALS, BEARISH ON
FUNDAMENTALS.
THEY SAY THEY WILL HAVE TO CLOSE
.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE? 
RICK: I AGREE WITH THE BULLISH
ON TECHNICALS.
THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE MIXED.
BULLISH ON TECHNICALS, THE
VALUATIONS HAVE GOTTEN FULL IN
SOME PARTS OF THE HIGH-YIELD
MARKET.
RICH IN SOME PARTS OF IT.
IT WOULD STILL DO ITS JOB.
IT WILL CREATE THE CARRY IN YOUR
PORTFOLIO THAT YOU WANT TO
CREATE.
I DISAGREE ON THE FUNDAMENTALS
SIDE, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LEVERAGE
THAT GOES ON.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS TERMS COME
OUT.
THE THING THAT DEALS COMPANIES
IN HIGH-YIELD IS IF LIQUIDITY IS
A PROBLEM.
IF YOU TERM YOUR DEBT OUT, YOU
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN FRONT OF
YOU THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS.
OR YOUR DEBT SERVICE, YOUR COST
OF INTEREST.
IN THAT COMES DOWN, PEOPLE TALK
ABOUT THAT EQUITY, DEBT TO
REVENUE, THAT IS GROWTH.
IF YOUR DEBT SERVICE IS NOT HIGH
BECAUSE OF WHERE YOUR RATE IS, I
WOULD ARGUE HIGH-YIELD IS NOT A
LOT OF INDUSTRY TIME.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE INDUSTRY
SECTOR HOW COMMODITIES MOVED
AROUND.
IT IS SOMETHING TO ARGUE.
JON: LET'S LOOK AT DEBT
SERVICING COSTS.
BGP IS LOOKING AT WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH ITALIAN DEBT.
1.2% IS THE YIELD ON THE ITALIAN
10 YEAR, BUT THE STORY HAS BEEN
ALL-TIME RECORD LOW YIELDS AND
CONCERN ABOUT ITALIAN THANKS.
YOU SIT AT BLACKROCK.
DOES BLACKROCK THINK YOU HAVE TO
BUILD IN A RISK PREMIUM TO
SPREAD, IF THE ITALIAN STATE
STEPS IN TO DO SOMETHING WITH
THE BANKS? 
RICK: THAT IS EQUIPPED TOUGH
QUESTION.
WE COULD TALK ABOUT ALL THE
RAMIFICATIONS, BUT THE TALENT
YOU BANKING SYSTEM, YOU HAVE --
THE ITALIAN BANKING SYSTEM,
THERE ARE BANKS THAT ARE WELL
CAPITALIZED IN ITALY.
YOU HAVE WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC
SITUATION, IDIOSYNCRATIC
SITUATION.
HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.
YOU HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP
IN OCTOBER.
ITALY WILL BE VOLATILE.
YOU HAVE AN INSURED AIRILY
SUPPORTIVE ECB -- EXTRAORDINARY
SUPPORTIVE ECB.
WE THINK IT IS 120 GOING LOWER
BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
THAT MR. DRAGHI HAS COMBINED.
WE THINK WE WILL HAVE SUPPORT OF
DYNAMICS AROUND ITALY.
WE THINK THERE IS A POSITIVE
COMING AROUND THE BANKING
SYSTEM, CAPITALIZATION WITH THE
BANKING SYSTEM, ABOUT THAT WILL
CONTINUE TO PLAY OUT.
THERE IS VALUE IN SOME OF THOSE
BANKS, IN EUROPE BROADLY.
OR YOU TAKE IT WITH SENIOR RISK
OR EQUITY, BUT THERE IS VALUE
BECAUSE OF THE SYNCRETIC NATURE.
ALIX: SO WHERE? 
THAT GAP IS HUGE.
SENIOR DEBT IS PRETTY DO SEE --
JUICY.
WHERE DO YOU SEE IT? 
RICK: WE SPENT TIME LOOKING AT
THE PLACES WE LIKE IS, I THINK
THERE IS AN EARNINGS DYNAMIC
THAT IS DIFFICULT.
THE U.K. DYNAMIC HAS TO PLAY
OUT, THERE IS NEAR-TERM
SOFTENING.
EUROPEAN DYNAMIC IS A BIT SOFTER
, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WATCH OTHER
THINGS.
RICK: SO THAT BEING SAID, SOME
OF THE SUB DEBTS, SUBORDINATED
DEBT HAS BECOME ATTRACTIVE.
WE LOOK AT SOME OF THAT, I
LOOKED AT INDIVIDUAL NAMES.
THEY HAVE GOTTEN OVERDONE, IN
PARTICULAR SUBORDINATED DEBT.
EQUITIES IS BETTER, THERE IS
VALUE.
THE BANKS ARE BETTER REGULATED,
BETTER CAPITALIZED, NO DOUBT,
EARNINGS ARE TOUGHER, BUT I
THINK THERE IS VALUE ON THE DEBT
SIDE OF SOME OF THESE BANKS.
DAVID: WE HAVE A REPORT ABOUT
HOME BIAS.
EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS AND WHERE
THERE IS OPPORTUNITY AND THE
RISK TO IT.
RICK: PEOPLE IN THE U.S. LIKE TO
INVEST IN FIXED INCOME.
THAT IS WHAT ARE THEY HAVE KNOWN
FOR 25 OR 30 YEARS.
IT IS A CONSISTENT LOWER RATE
DYNAMIC.
YOU CAN DISCUSS THE FEDERAL
NUMBER, THE U.S. IS BETTER THAN
THE REST OF THE WORLD.
U.S. FIXED INCOME, THE FIRST
PART OF THE ROLLED THAT WILL
RAISE RATES VERY SLOWLY WILL BE
THE U.S. 
SOME OF THE GLOBAL FUNDS ARE
DOING EXTREMELY WELL BECAUSE OF
EXPOSURE TO OTHER PARTS OF THE
WORLD THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP
REDUCING RATES.
JAPAN WILL BE EASING, ECB WILL
BE EASING.
EMERGING MARKETS ARE GOING TO BE
EASIER TO GET THEIR ECONOMIES
REQUIRE IT.
SO PEOPLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
INTEREST RATES IN THE U.S. ARE
LOW.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE
TRAJECTORY OF WHERE THE RATES
ARE GOING TO GO, WHERE THEY GO
HIGHER FIRST, IT IS THE U.S..
LOOK AT WHAT IS WORKED FOR ME,
AND THE U.S..
ALIX: WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT
NIGHT? 
RICK: EVERYTHING.
WE NEED TO FOLLOW DATA IN THE
EUROPE AND U.K., BUT I DON'T
THINK THAT WILL CREATE PROBLEMS.
CHINA IS ONE, THE DATA COMING UP
NEXT WEEK, YOU KEEPING UP A
IONIC.
OTHER THINGS, VALUATIONS, GOT TO
BE CAREFUL.
WE IN OUR MORE CONSERVATIVE
PLACE.
IT IS A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE
THINGS.
ALIX: BLACKROCK CIO, FIXED
INCOME.
MORE GO IS COMING UP.
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DOW UP 158
POINTS, S&P 18, NASDAQ 48.
IT IS A RISK ON THE JOBS REPORT.
â™ª
â™ª
DAVID: WRAPPING UP A BIG JOBS
DAY HERE IN NEW YORK.
THE NUMBER CAME IN AT 287,000.
IT WAS MORE THAN THE TOP OF THE
RANGE, WHICH WAS TO 43,000.
IT WAS QUITE A NUMBER.
JON: RAISING THE POST BREXIT
LOSSES, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
NEXT WEEK TO SEE WHAT THE POST
BREXIT RESPONSE IS IN THE BANK
OF ENGLAND.
THE BANK OF ENGLAND DECISION,
FORGET THE WEEKEND.
I'M LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT WEEK
ALREADY.
ALIX: THE STORY OF THE DAY SEEMS
TO BE THE YIELD CURVE CONTINUING
TO FLATTEN.
IT IS LIKE YOU WANT TO SCHOLL --
SELL THE SHORT-TERM AND BY THE
LONG AND.
DAVID: WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
HAVING JOBS BACK IN NEW YORK.
JON: I LOOKING FOR TO IT.
IT HAS BEEN A HISTORIC FEW WEEKS
IN THE CITY OF LONDON.
THAT DOESN'T FOR "BLOOMBERG
." 
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
VONNIE: IT IS TENDER CALL CAME
IN NEW YORK AND 3:00 P.M. IN
LONDON.
FROM NEW YORK, I VONNIE QUINN.
MARK: I AM MARK BARTON AND THIS
IS "BLOOMBERG MARKETS."
â™ª
VONNIE: WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU
FROM LONDON TO ROME TO
WASHINGTON IN THE NEXT HOUR.
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE WATCHING.
JOBS HAVE GROWN BY THE MOST
IN EIGHT MONTHS WITH PAYROLLS
CLIMBING ENGINE.
IN JUNE.
MOHAMED SUGGEST THAT THE
WEAKNESS IN THE MAY JOBS REPORT
WAS AN OUTLIER.
HE JOINS US NEXT HOUR.
MARK: SPURRED BY DECLINES OF THE
BREXIT VOTE, THE WORST PERFORMER
AMONG MAJOR CURRENCIES.
VONNIE: A NEW SERIES THAT DRIVE
IS AROUND THE WORLD.
ROLLS-ROYCE TAKES TO THE STREETS
OF CALIFORNIA.
IT IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES INTO THE
TRADING DAY IN THE U.S. AND WE
ARE ALREADY HITTING SOME
WATERMARKS.
LET'S HEAD STRAIGHT TO THE
MARKETS DESK WHERE RAMY HAS
MORE.
RAMY: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE
OUR MARKETS ARE.
THE NASDAQ IS PUSHING HIGHER.
WHEN THAT NUMBER CAME OUT
287,000 JOBS, YOU COULD HEAR WOW
ACROSS THE NEWSROOM.
IT BLEW OUT ALL BLOOMBERG
ESTIMATES.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE
INDEXES AND LET'S HOP IN THE
BLOOMBERG FOR THIS.
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAS BEEN
HAPPENING POST BREXIT VOTE.
THE REASON FOR THIS CHART, I
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALL OF
OUR AVERAGES ARE UP ABOVE THE
POST BREXIT VOTE LOST LINE THAT
WE HIT POST JUNE 2013 WE HAVE
 23.
WE HAVE RECOUPED ALL OF OUR
LOSSES.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMAP
AND THE S&P 500.
FINANCIALS ARE THE BIGGEST
GAINER TODAY, UP BY 1.6%.
YESTERDAY THEY ONLY GAINED A
10TH OF A PERCENT OR SO, BUT
BECAUSE OF THE JOBS NUMBERS, WE
ARE SEEING A GENERALLY BROAD
RALLY ACROSS THE BOARD.
CONSUMERS AND  DISCRETIONARY
ON THE UPSIDE.
UTILITIES ON THE DOWNSIDE,
INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT
IS HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT RATES.
LET'S GO DEEPER INTO FINANCIALS
AND SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
TERMS OF THE BANKS.
JPMORGAN, YOU CAN SEE HERE, UP
BY MORE THAN 2%.
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR MAJOR BANKS
HERE, BASICALLY LOOKING TO RALLY
OFF OF JOBS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF MATERIALS.
THAT IS THE SECOND-BIGGEST
GAINER ON THE S&P IN TERMS OF
THE IMAP FUNCTION.
WESTBROOK ALMOST UP BY 3%.
THERE ARE SOME LAGGARDS.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DEAL
BETWEEN HUMANA AND AETNA.
BOTH OF THESE STOCKS NOW LOWER
BECAUSE JPMORGAN HAS CUT ITS
RATING TO NEUTRAL VERSUS
OVERWEIGHT.
JPMORGAN SAYING IT SEES A MUCH
LOWER PROBABILITY THAN A 50-50
CHANCE THAT THE DEAL IS GOING TO
BE APPROVED.
IT IS CUTTING AT 18 MONTHS PRICE
TARGET TO $196 AND WE ARE CLOSER
TO THAT MARK WITH $159 RIGHT
NOW.
MARK: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
CUTTING LOSSES FROM THE POST
BREXIT VOTE AND THE STOXX 600
HAS NOT ACHIEVED THAT.
IT IS STILL DOWN BY  5.75%.
IT RECEIVED A ONE POINT 5% BOOST
WITH THE JOBS REPORT GAINING FOR
THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE DAY.
ONLY TO SECTORS HAVE RISEN --
HEALTH CARE AND FOOD AND
BEVERAGES.
INSURANCE HAS SLUMPED BY 17%,
BUT WE ARE UP FOR A CONSECUTIVE
DAY.
YOU CAN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
PLUNGING THE MOST IN 21 YEARS,
THE LATEST SIGN THAT BREXIT IS
HARMING THE UK'S OUTLOOK.
THE CORE INDEX SLIDING TO MINUS
NINE.
IT WAS A SPECIAL POST REFERENDUM
SURVEY  AND THE EARLIER
FIGURE WAS MINUS ONE.
AS THE BIGGEST SLIDE SINCE
DECEMBER 1994, THE IMPACT OF
UNCERTAINTY BECOMING
INCREASINGLY EVIDENT AS WELL.
THIS IS THE LATEST FIGURE TO
SHOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN
IMPACT ON SURVEYS FROM THE
REFERENDUM.
THE BIG GAINER TODAY HERE IN
EUROPE, DENMARK'S LARGEST PHONE
COMPANY, WAS SHARES RISING AS
MUCH AS 12%, THE MOST SINCE
2007.
THEY CONFIRMED THEY RECEIVED A
PULMONARY TAKE OVER APPROACH,
RESPONDING TO A REPORT THAT
APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT IS
INTERESTED IN BUYING IT AND
TAKING IT PRIVATE.
TDC DID NOT SAY WHO THE APPROACH
WAS FROM.
THEY SAID IT WAS PRELIMINARY,
INADEQUATE, AND IT IS NOT
INTERESTED IN PURSUING ANY
FURTHER.
SHARES OF BY 9%.
RISING 1% NOW AFTER THE CFO
ANNOUNCED STEPPING DOWN JUST A
WEEK AFTER A NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE
TOOK CHARGE TO BECOME CFO OF THE
DANISH FACILITY MANAGER ISS.
WHAT A DAY AND WHAT A WEEK WE
ARE HAVING.
VONNIE: IT IS NOT EVEN THE FIRST
WEEK OF THE MONTH.
LET'S CHECK IN ON THE FIRST WORD
NEWS.
EMMA HAS MORE FROM THE
FIRST WORD NEWS ROOM.
EMMA: WE ARE GETTING MORE
INFORMATION FROM THE OFFICERS
KILLED IN DALLAS.
POLICE EXCHANGE GUNFIRE WITH ONE
OF THE SUSPECTS HOLED UP IN A
PARKING GARAGE.
>> THE SUSPECT SAID HE WAS UPSET
ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTER.
HE SAID HE WAS UPSET ABOUT THE
RECENT POLICE SHOOTINGS.
THE SUSPECT SAID HE WAS UPSET AT
 WHITE PEOPLE.
THE SUSPECT STATED HE WANTS TO
KILL WHAT PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY
WHITE OFFICERS.
EMMA: THAT SUSPECT DIED AFTER A
POLICE ROBOT CARRYING EXPLOSIVES
DETONATED A DEVICE NEAR HIM.
THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE DURING
PROTESTS OF THE RECENT SHOOTINGS
OF BLACK MEN.
THE EVENTS IN DALLAS HAVE LED TO
A TEMPORARY HALT IN THE PRESENCE
OF CAMPAIGN.
HILLARY CLINTON CANCELED AN
EVENT SCHEDULED IN SCRANTON,
PENNSYLVANIA.
SHE WAS GOING TO APPEAR WITH
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
SHE WILL STILL SPEAK AT A
CHURCH CONVENTION AND FILLED UP
 IN PHILADELPHIA.
DONALD TRUMP CANCELED A SPEECH
IN MIAMI.
OBAMA SAYS HE WILL SEND AN
EDITION OF THOUSAND TROOPS TO
POLAND, PART OF A NATO EFFORT TO
REINFORCE A FLANK.
IT IS ONE OF FOUR THAT WILL
BEGIN ROTATING THROUGH THE
REGION.
THE MOVE IS MEANT TO ACT AS A
DETERRENT TO RUSSIA.
IN THE U K, THERESA MAY SAYS IT
IS TIME FOR HER TO MAKE THE CASE
TO BRITAIN ON WHY SHE SHOULD BE
THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER.
SHE WILL FACE OFF IN A BATTLE TO
SUCCEED DAVID CAMERON.
THE LEADER WILL LEAD
NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE BRITAIN OUT
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
ON THE SECOND-ROUND BALLOT,
PARTY MEMBERS NATIONWIDE WILL
MAKE THE FINAL DECISION.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY
HOWARD BY MORE THAN 2600
JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS IN MORE
THAN 120 COUNTRIES, I AM EMMA
CHANDRA.
VONNIE: GETTING BACK TO THE U.S.
JOBS REPORT NOW, UNEMPLOYMENT
R REBOUNDED I JUNE.
PAYROLLS CLIMBED 287,000, MORE
THAN FORECAST.
TODAY SUGGEST THAT THE MADE JOBS
CREATION WAS REVISED LOWER TO
 11,000, AN ANOMALY.
JOINING US ON THE PHONE IS
MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, BLOOMBERG VIEW
COLUMNIST.
YOU WROTE YESTERDAY THAT THE
IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF AN UPBEAT
JOBS REPORT WOULD BE TO ADD
CONFUSION TO THE MARKET.
THIS WAS UPBEAT IN SOME WAYS,
BUT ALSO THERE WERE THINGS ABOUT
THIS REPORT THAT MAY BE MIGHT
GIVE US PAUSE.
DOES THE SETTLED THE MARKET OR
ADD MORE CONFUSION?
MOHAMED: WITH THIS REPORT IS IS
MORE LIKE A GOLDILOCKS REPORT
FOR THE MARKETS.
THEY ARE WELCOME.
THEY WILL WELCOME THE JOB
CREATION AND THE UPTICK IN THE
LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE.
THEY WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WAGE
GROWTH REMAINS SLUGGISH.
WHAT YOU  SHOULD SEE IS
SHORT MOVEMENT AT THE END OF THE
YIELD CURVE.
EQUITIES IS DOING WELL BECAUSE
GOLDILOCKS REPORT SHOWS THAT
WEALTH IS OK.
BEATEN UP SECTORS, PARTICULARLY
BANKING, WILL GET SOME
SHORT-TERM RELIEF BECAUSE  OF
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE YIELD
CURVE.
VONNIE: FOR WAGES, WE HAD NO
MEANINGFUL ACCELERATION THERE.
THE PARTICIPATION RATE DID
INCREASE, WHICH IS GOOD, BUT
WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE
FEDERAL RESERVE?
CAN THEY PUT A  RATE HIKE
ACT ON THE TABLE THIS YEAR?
MOHAMED: IT'S CERTAINLY IS
SAYING, LOOK, DO NOT ASSUME WE
ARE TOTALLY SIDELINE, BUT IT
DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE GOING TO
MOVE QUICKLY.
WITH THIS TYPES OF JOBS REPORT,
WE MAY END UP WITH ONE HIKE THIS
YEAR.
THIS IS AGAINST EXPECTATIONS
THAT HAD BASICALLY SIDELINED THE
FED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
MARK: EXPLAIN TO ME MAY.
IT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO 11,000
FROM THE INITIAL FIGURE.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN MAY AND DID
IT PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE
MAIN NUMBER?
MOHAMED: YES ON PUTTING TOO MUCH
WEIGHT.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS
IS A VERY NOISY SERIES.
GETS REVISED A LOT.
WHAT I LIKE IS LOOKING AT
MONTHLY AVERAGES.
THE THREE-MONTH MOVING AVERAGES
ABOUT 147,000.
THE EQUILIBRIUM JOB CREATION IS
ABOUT 125-150,000.
THE ECONOMY IS PERFORMING AS YOU
WOULD EXPECT ON THE JOB CREATION
SIDE.
THE TWO AREAS TO LOOK VERY
CLOSELY AT HIS LABOR
PARTICIPATION.
WE NEED THAT TO  COME
BACK UP AND WAGE GROWTH.
FOR ME, THE MONTH-TO-MONTH IS
VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN WELL, BUT
THE TRENDS ARE THAT THIS ECONOMY
CONTINUES TO GROW AND IT IS NOT
GREAT, BUT IT'S OK.
MARK: I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT
THE REFERENDUM, THE BREXIT
REFERENDUM.
TO WHAT EXTENT IS BREXIT FROM
HERE ON IN AN OBSTACLE TO U.S.
POLICY NORMALIZATION?
MOHAMED: IT IS AN OBSTACLE
BECAUSE IT WILL REINFORCE THE
NOTION THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT
CONTROL ITS YIELD CURVE.
IT DOES CONTROL ITS ECONOMIC
DESTINY.
I DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT
THE ECONOMIC SPILLOVERS OF
BREXIT ON TO THE U.S. GROWTH.
I THINK IT IS A MEANINGFUL A
LIMIT FOR EUROPE -- ELEMENT FOR
EUROPE AND THE U.K..
THE NUMBER THAT YOU CITED ON
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS ONE
INSIGHT.
BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO
COME DOWN A LOT IN THE U.K. TO
SEE WHAT EMERGES.
THIS IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC PROBLEM
FOR THE U.K. AND EUROPE.
IT IS LESS OF AN ECONOMIC
PROBLEM FOR THE U.S., BUT IT
WILL FURTHER DECOUPLE FINANCIAL
VARIABLES FROM ECONOMIC
VARIABLES.
VONNIE: WHAT HAPPENS TO RATES?
WE SEE THE SPREAD NOW AT 76
BASIS POINTS.
THAT IS MORE FLATTENING TODAY.
IT IS THE TWO-YEAR THAT IS
REALLY HELPING THAT.
DO WE GET EVEN MORE OF A
FLATTENING AND PERHAPS AN
INVERSION AT SOME POINT?
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE YIELD MORE
BROADLY AROUND THE WORLD?
MOHAMED: THAT IS A QUESTION
REALLY ABOUT EUROPE.
DOES EUROPE GET ITS ACT TOGETHER
POLITICALLY?
DOES THE U.K. AGREE WITH ITS
EUROPEAN PARTNERS ON SOMETHING
TO REPLACE FULL EU MEMBERSHIP?
IF IT DOES, THEN YOU WILL NOT
SEE MORE DRAMATIC FLATTENING OF
THE CURVE.
IF HOWEVER THERE IS NO PLAN B,
AS IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW, AND
THEY CANNOT GET THEIR ACT
TOGETHER POLITICALLY, YOU THEN
YOU WILL SEE ADVANCED ECONOMY
KURDS CONTINUE TO FLATTEN.
VONNIE: THE IMF ENCOURAGING THAT
E ECB TO  INCREASE
PURCHASES.
WE ARE GOING TO SEE ACTION
AROUND THE WORLD THE NEXT FEW
MONTHS, BUT THE NEXT SHOCKERS?
MOHAMED: THE BIGGEST SHOCKER
WOULD BE FOREIGN-EXCHANGE
INTERVENTION BY THE BANK OF
JAPAN.
THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST
SHOCKER.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY CLOSELY
AS YOU HAVE AT WHAT HAS BEEN
HAPPENING TO THE DOLLAR YEN.
THE POST REPORT WEAKENING OF THE
YEN DID NOT LAST.
THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THIS 100
PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL, THE GREATER
THE PRESSURE ON THE BANK OF
JAPAN TO INTERVENE IN THE
FOREIGN EXTENT MARKET AND THAT'S
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME
AN EFFECTIVE.
LOOK FOR THE ECB TO DO MORE
QE AND LOOK FOR THE FED TO
WAIT AND SEE AT LEAST UNTIL
SEPTEMBER.
MARK: HOW LOW DOES STERLING
GO?
IS IT UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT IT
TO FALL TO THE LOWS IT SAW IN
1985, WHICH ARE THE LOWS GOING
BACK TO 1971?
YOU WILL KNOW THAT.
IS INCONCEIVABLE TO THINK THAT
WE COULD GO TO THOSE  LOWS
OR EVEN PARITY?
MOHAMED: IT IS NOT
INCONCEIVABLE.
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SCENARIO
WHERE THAT HAPPENS.
IT IS BASICALLY MONTHS AND
MONTHS OF NO PROGRESS IN
REPLACING EU MEMBERSHIP WITH
SOME SORT OF FREE TRADE ZONE.
REMEMBER THAT BRITAIN IS GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING THAT IS VERY
UNUSUAL FOR AN ADVANCED ECONOMY,
WHICH IS WHEN YOU PUT UP THE
CURRENT ACCOUNT, BASICALLY
TRADE, AND THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT,
CAPITAL INFLOWS, AND PLAY.
IT HAS DONE THAT THROUGH THE
BREXIT VOTE.
IT HAS PUT ITS CURRENT AND
CAPITAL ACCOUNT IN PLAY.
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS IN NO
POSITION TO RAISE INTEREST RATES
IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THE
MARKET.
IT IS CONCEIVABLE IF PLAN B DOES
NOT EMERGE QUICKLY.
AND IF PLAN B DOES NOT INVOLVE A
SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF FREE TRADE
WITH THE REST OF EUROPE.
MARK: MUHAMMAD, WHICH ASSETS AND
THE U.K. HAVE A BIG BY SIGN OVER
THEM RIGHT NOW?
MOHAMED: I THINK YOU WAIT A
LITTLE BIT AND THEN COMMERCIAL
PROPERTY WILL BE.
WE ARE SEEING A FOR STEALING OF
THAT SECTOR.
IT IS A SECTOR THAT OVERPROMISED
LIQUIDITY.
THEY PUT A LIQUID ASSETS -- A
ILLIQUID ASSETS AND
DEALS.
IF YOU ARE A PATIENT INVESTOR
WITH A STOMACH FOR 
MONTH-TO-MONTH VOLATILITY, THAT
WILL BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE AREA.
WAIT AND LET THE OPPORTUNITIES
COME TO YOU.
MARK: IT WAS GREAT TO SPEAK TO
YOU ON JOBS FRIDAY.
MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, BLOOMBERG VIEW
COLUMNIST.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
MARK: YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LIVE
PICTURE OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE
ONE IN BRIDGE -- MILLENNIUM
BRIDGE IN LONDON.
I AM MARK BARTON HERE IN LONDON.
VONNIE: THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL
PICTURE.
I AM VONNIE QUINN AND YOU ARE
WATCHING "BLOOMBERG MARKETS."
IT IS TIME FOR THE BLOOMBERG
BUSINESS FLASH COME AND LOOK AT
THE BIGGEST BUSINESS STORIES IN
THE NEWS RIGHT NOW.
CHINA MAY COME UP WITH AN AID
PACKAGE FOR SOME OF ITS TRUCKING
BUSINESSES.
ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR
WITH THE MATTER, ONE OF THE
COMPANIES MAY RECEIVE HELP HIS
STEEL.
THEY ARE HAVING TO COPE WITH
OVERCAPACITY AND SLUMPING
DEMAND.
CAR SALES IN CHINA ROSE FOR THE
FASTER PACE FOR THE FIRST HALF
OF THE YEAR.
SUVS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN A
THIRD OF CHINA SALES.
SALES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES MORE
THAN DOUBLED.
VOLKSWAGEN IS TEAMING UP WITH
COMPANIES THAT MAY MAKE
BATTERIES FOR LESSER CARS.
VW IS WAYNE PARTNERSHIPS WITH
PANASONIC.
IT IS HOPING TO EMERGE FROM THAT
SCANDAL OVER FUEL EMISSIONS
.
THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BUSINESS
FLASH.
MARK: STILL AHEAD, OUR WEEKLY
DIVE INTO THE $3 TRILLION ETF
MARKET.
NOT TOO MANY TRADED FUNDS.
WE WILL DISCUSS NEXT.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
VONNIE: YOU ARE WATCHING
"BLOOMBERG MARKETS."
I AM VONNIE QUINN IN NEW YORK.
MARK: I AM MARK BARTON IN LONDON
AND THIS IS BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION.
TIME FOR A WEEKLY DIVE INTO THE
ETF MARKETS WERE OVER 7000 OF
THESE BONDS ARE AROUND THE
WORLD.
FOR NEW LAUNCHES EVERY SINGLE
DAY.
MANY ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER
THIS IS ETF OVERKILL.
HERE TO DISCUSS IS ERIC
BALCHUNAS, WHO COVERS ETF'S FOR
BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION OF
ETF'S SINCE 2014.
WHAT IS BEHIND IT?
ERIC: PEOPLE LOOK AT ETF AS A
VEHICLE OF THE FUTURE.
RIGHT NOW THERE IS $3 TRILLION
IN ASSETS, BUT SOME PEOPLE
ESTIMATE IT WILL GO TO EVEN $10
TRILLION AS THEY  SLOWLY
BLEED OUT MUTUAL FUNDS.
IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCT
LAUNCHES, YOU HAVE A GROWING
MARKET.
WHAT PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE IS
THE PERSON CAME OUT AGAINST THE
LAUNCHES WAS THE VANGUARD CEO.
THEY ARE THE PLAIN VANILLA.
THEY DO NOT LIKE THE GIMMICKY
SORT OF SMART BETA STUFF COMING
UP.
HOWEVER, A LOT OF ETF'S ARE
PROFITABLE.
ALMOST 40% OF ETF'S COME OUT
WITH THE FUTURE.
WHEN YOU THINK OF 7000, THAT IS
NOWHERE NEAR THE AMOUNT OF
MUTUAL FUNDS IN THE WORLD.
EVERYBODY IS FOCUSED ON THEM
NOW, BUT THEY ARE NOWHERE NEAR
THE SIZE OF THE MUTUAL MARKET --
MUTUAL FUND MARKET.
MARK: HOW MUCH PATIENCE DO NEW
ETF'S NEED TO ATTRACT BUYERS?
ERIC: YOU HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE.
ONLY 5% OF THE 40% THAT HAVE
OVER $100 MILLION OR 3% OLD.
MUTUAL FUNDS COME WITH
DISTRIBUTION FEES AND LOADS
.
THE WHOLE SYSTEM MAKES IT EASY
FOR FUNDS TO GET MONEY.
ETF'S DO NOT HAVE THAT.
THEY HAVE TO MAKE MONEY THE HARD
WAY.
THEY HAVE TO SELL THEIR IDEA AND
HOPE THAT WHAT THEY TRACK, THE
STARS ALIGNED, AND MAYBE THEY
OUTPERFORM OR SHOW VALUE IN
OTHER WAYS.
THAT IS WHY ETF GROWTH HAS NOT
BEEN FASTER.
SOME PEOPLE SAY ETF'S ARE 
BUT NOT SOLD.
VONNIE: THE TREND WENT FROM
PASSIVE TO ACTIVE AND IT LOOKS
LIKE WE ARE RETURNING TO SORT OF
THE PASSIVE TREND AGAIN.
IS THAT THE CASE?
ERIC: YES.
IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR, YOU
CAN SEE $76 BILLION OUT.
OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, WE
HAVE SEEN VIRTUALLY A $2
TRILLION SWING FROM ACTIVE TO
PASSIVE.
THE REASON YOU HAVE NOT HEARD
MORE ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE THE
STOCK MARKET HAS GONE UP IN THE
TREASURY MARKET HAS GONE UP.
THE ACTUAL COMPANIES THAT ISSUE
THIS STUFF ARE LOSING REVENUE.
IT HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY THE FACT
THAT THE MARKET IS GOING UP.
YOU WILL SEE ASSET MANAGERS
FEELING PAIN IN TERMS OF PEOPLE
MOVING TO PASSIVE, WHICH
REPRESENTS A 70% CUT IN REVENUE.
THEY CHARGED 20 BASIS POINTS AND
ACTIVE PRODUCTS CHARGE 80 BASIS
POINTS ON AVERAGE.
VONNIE: ETF'S ARE BACKED BY HARD
ASSETS.
WHAT ARE THE HARD ASSETS WE
SHOULD BE WATCHING FOR NEW ETF'S
TO COME OUT OF NOW?
ERIC: 
I LOOKED AT THE ETF AND
REGISTRATION.
THERE ARE OVER 1200 AWAITING
APPROVAL.
THE BITCOIN FROM THE WINKLE
BOSQUE WHEN IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE
WAITING FOR HERE.
YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF
INTERESTING PRODUCTS.
THERE IS A SPAGHETTI THING GOING
ON DOWN AGAINST THE WALL, BUT
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HIT.
HARDLY ANY OF THEM WERE
PROFITABLE, BUT YOU NEVER HEAR
ABOUT TOO MANY APPS.
MARK: HOW IS THE EUROPEAN ETF
MARKET?
ERIC: IT IS GROWING SLOWER IN
THE U.S.
MOSTLY IT IS INSTITUTIONAL MONEY
HERE SO FAR.
I WAS HERE ALL WEEK AND MET WITH
A LOT OF ISSUERS WHO ARE FROM
THE U.S. WHO HAVE U.S. PEOPLE
WHO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
HERE.
THEY ARE SAYING IS A LOT SLOWER
AND HARDER TO GET TRACTION HERE.
THEY HAVE SENT THEIR BEST PEOPLE
HERE TO TRY TO GET THE MARKET
GOING.
MARK: ERIC BALCHUNAS, BLOOMBERG
INTELLIGENCE, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
VONNIE: STILL AHEAD ON BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION, WILL THE STRONG JOBS
REPORT SPUR THE FEDERAL RESERVE
TO  RAISE RATES?
HEAR WHAT BILL GROSS SAYS NEXT.
â™ª
VONNIE: LIVE FROM BLOOMBERG
WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK
AND LONDON, I AM VONNIE QUINN.
MARK: I AM MARK BARTON AND YOU
ARE WATCHING "BLOOMBERG
MARKETS."
LET'S CHECK IN WITH BLOOMBERG
FIRST WORD NEWS TODAY.
EMMA CHANDRA HAS THE LATEST.
EMMA: IT IS BEING CALLED AN
AMBUSH, I CAREFULLY PLOTTED
ATTACK ON OFFICERS IN DALLAS
THAT LEFT FIVE OFFICERS DEAD AND
TWO WOUNDED.
POLICE SAY SNIPERS OPENED FIRE
DURING A PROTEST OF RECENTLY
SHOOTINGS.
THREE SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED AND
POLICE EXCHANGE SHOTS WITH A
FOURTH WHO IS HOLD UP IN A
PARKING RUSH.
-- GARAGE.
>> THE SUSPECT SAID HE WAS UPSET
ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTER.
HE SAID HE WAS UPSET ABOUT THE
RECENT POLICE SHOOTINGS.
THE SUSPECT SAID HE WAS UPSET AT
WHAT PEOPLE.
WHITE PEOPLE.
THE SUSPECT STATED HE WON THE
KILL WHITE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY
WHITE OFFICERS.
EMMA: THAT SUSPECT WAS KILLED
AFTER POLICE DETONATED AN
EXPLOSIVE ATTACHED TO A POLICE
ROBOT.
AUTHORITIES ARE NOT SURE THEY
HAVE CAUGHT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN
THE ATTACK.
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WANT
TO KNOW WHY THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
NOT APPROVED THE SALE OF FIGHTER
PLANES TO KEEP PERSIAN GULF
ALLIES.
QATAR, KUWAIT, AND BAHRAIN AS TO
BUY THE PLANES THREE YEARS AGO.
IN A LETTER OBTAINED BY
BLOOMBERG NEWS, LAWMAKERS SAY
THE U.S. HAS ASKED THIS COUNTRY
TO TAKE A BIGGER ROLE IN
FIGHTING THE ISLAMIC STATE, BUT
HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING ABOUT
THEIR WEAPONS REQUEST.
SOUTH KOREA AND THE U.S. HAVE
AGREED TO DEPLOY A NEW
ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEM.
SOUTH KOREA SAYS IT'S IN
RESPONSE TO A GROWING THREAT
FROM NORTH KOREA.
CHINA IS OPPOSED TO THE MOVE AND
URGED THE TWO COUNTRIES TO
RECONSIDER DEPLOYMENT.
IN COLUMBIA, THE OUTPUT OF THE
 MATERIAL OF MAKING COCAINE
HAS SOARED TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL
SINCE 2007.
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS MARXIST
REBELS HAVE ENCOURAGED STEPPING
UP THE PLANTING OF COCOA BEFORE
A PEACE DEAL IS SIGNED.
THE GUERRILLAS ARE TELLING
FARMERS THEY WILL EVENTUALLY
REPAY SUBSIDIES TO SWITCH TO
LEGAL CROPS.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY
POWERED BY MORE THAN 2600
JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS IN MORE
THAN 120 COUNTRIES, I'M EMMA
CHANDRA.
VONNIE: THE U.S. JOBS MARKET
CAME ROARING BACK LAST MONTH
WITH 287,000 JOBS CREATED IN THE
MONTH OF JUNE, BUT BILL GROSS
TOLD BLOOMBERG EARLIER THAT HE
DID NOT THINK IT WOULD SPUR THE
FED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO RAISE
INTEREST RATES.
BILL: THINGS ARE NOT AS
HUNKY-DORY AS 287,000 MIGHT
SUGGEST.
BACK TO A NORMALIZED 150,000,
IT'S NOTHING TO GET EXCITED
ABOUT.
>> DOES IT GET ANYONE INTERESTED
IN WHAT JANET YELLEN AND COMPANY
ARE GOING TO DO?
DOES THIS CHANGE THE CALCULATION
OF ONE THEY MIGHT MOVE IT ALL
FOR YOU?
BILL: I DON'T THINK SO.
THEY STILL HAVE BREXIT TO LOOK
INTO THE EYES.
THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
PROBLEMS WITH THE ITALIAN BANKS
.
THE FED DOESN'T, BUT THE ECB AND
THE EU DO.
THERE IS A SENSE OF ILLIQUIDITY
AND MARKETS AND THE FED IS VERY
OBSESSED AND CONCERNED WITH
MARKETS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE
IS DISCORD AROUND THE WORLD.
I THINK THE FED STAYS WHERE IT
IS.
THE HAVE WANTED TO RAISE
INTEREST RATES.
THEY DID IT ONCE AND I THINK
THEY WANT TO HAVE US BELIEVE
THAT THEY WILL RAISE SEVERAL
TIMES AND THEREFORE HAVE A
PRETTY POSITIVE YIELD CURVE,
WHICH WILL  HELP BANKS AND
INSURANCE COMPANIES.
FOR THE MOST PART, I DO NOT
THINK THIS CHANGES MUCH.
>> JUST TO CLARIFY -- YOUR CALL
IS FOR HOW MANY RATE MOVES THIS
YEAR?
BILL: THE MARKET ONLY CALLS FOR
A HALF IN THE NEXT MONTH AND
BEYOND THAT, ANOTHER HALF, SO 12
BASIS POINTS EACH.
THAT IS THE MARKET.
I THINK THEY TRY TO RAISE ONCE
AND IF THEY CONTINUE TO GET
EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS LIKE THIS AND
IF THEY CAN GET THOSE WAGES UP,
THEN PERHAPS THEY WILL HAVE
THEIR CHANCE LATER IN THE YEAR.
I THINK THEY REALLY DO WANT TO
RAISE RATES.
SOME OF THEM LIKE BULLARD AND
EVANS HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY
NEED HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN
ORDER TO BALANCE OUT THE SAVINGS
VERSUS INVESTMENT ELEMENT IN THE
ECONOMY.
>> BILL GROSS, WITHOUT QUESTION
IN OUR LIFETIMES, THIS IS THE
MOST PRICED TO PERFECTION BOND
MARKET WE HAVE EVER SEEN.
HAS YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
CHANGED?
THE YIELD GOES FROM 139 TO 141.
THAT THESE ARE SHOCKING YIELDS
AND SHOCKING BOND VALUATIONS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DAY-TO-DAY
WITH THINNESS MALIA -- WITHIN
THIS MILIEU?
BILL: I DO NOT THINK IT IS
PRICED TO PERFECTION.
IT IS PRICED TO ABSURDITY.
ONE NOTE THAT $12 TRILLION WORTH
OF SOVEREIGN BONDS IN NEGATIVE
YIELD SPACE, THERE IS ONE NOTE
IN GERMANY THAT THE ECB CANNOT
REALLY BUY 40% OF GERMAN BONDS
BECAUSE THEY ARE YIELDING LESS
THAN 40 BASIS POINTS.
IN JAPAN, THERE IS EVEN THE 40
YEAR JGB.
SO IT'S AN ABSURD MARKET.
WHAT DO YOU DO IS THE QUESTION.
YOU OBVIOUSLY DO NOT BUY THOSE
BONDS.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CHAIRMAN
OF BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES
HAVE TO BUY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO
PUT THEIR MONEY 
SOMEWHERE, SO YOU LOOK FOR
SUBSTITUTES IN SOME KIND OF
CERTAINTY.
VONNIE: THAT MEANS BUYING
MORTGAGES AND SELLING OPTIONS.
MARK: WHILE THE U.S. JOB MARKET
REBOUNDS, FEARS ARE GROWING
ABOUT THE U.K. ECONOMY.
MANY COLUMNIST THINK THE
THREAT OF RECESSION IS VERY
STRONG.
WE ARE JOINED BY PETER FROM
VANGUARD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
WE HAD DATA ON CONSUMER
CONFIDENCE PLUNGING THE MOST IN
21 YEARS.
WE HAD BUSINESS CONFIDENCE DATA
YESTERDAY PLUNGING POST BREXIT.
HOW IS THIS SOFT DATA GOING TO
TRANSLATE TO THE HARD DATA?
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE MUCH OF
IT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST.
PETER: I THINK IT IS GOING TO
TRANSLATE PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY.
I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
SEE WHY ANY FIRMS ARE GOING TO
BE INVESTING AT THE MOMENT WHILE
THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY
AROUND THIS.
THERE'S AN OPTION VALUE FOR
WAITING IF YOU LOOK, SO ANY FIRM
THAT IS THINKING ABOUT A PROJECT
OR THE CONSUMER MAKING A BIG
PURCHASE LIKE EVEN HOUSING, WHY
WOULD YOU DO THAT AT THE MOMENT?
I THINK IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE U.K.
GOING INTO RECESSION.
MARK: THERE IS RECESSION AND
THEM THERE IS A RECESSION.
GIVE US A THOUGHT OF THE
RECESSION THAT THE U.K. MIGHT
EXPERIENCE THIS YEAR OR NEXT
YEAR.
PETER: THIS IS ALL FINGER IN THE
AIR STUFF BECAUSE THERE'S NOT
ANYTHING TO COMPARE IT AGAINST.
WE COULD SEE U.K. GDP FALLING BY
A QUARTER PERCENT.
PROBABLY YEAR ON YEAR, 2016,
2017 ARE GOING TO SEE FLAT GDP.
WE WILL TECHNICALLY HAVE A
RECESSION, BUT IT COULD BE A LOT
WORSE THAN THAT.
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE FORECASTS
WERE MADE BEFORE THE REVEREND
WERE BEING DISMISSED AS FEAR AND
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT NOW.
VONNIE: WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF
THE CENTRAL BANKS OF THE WORLD?
WHERE ARE YOU ANTICIPATING
ACTION THAT MIGHT GET THE BALL
ROLLING?
PETER: OBVIOUSLY CLOSEST TO
HOME, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE
THE U.K. CUT INTEREST RATES
LATER THIS YEAR.
MARK CARNEY HAS ALREADY GIVEN
THAT THEY CAN'T ABOUT THAT. -- A
BIG HINT ABOUT THAT.
I THINK THE ECB IS VERY LIKELY
TO NEED TO EXTEND QE PURCHASES
BEYOND MARCH NEXT YEAR.
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE SEEING THE FED
HOLDING FIRE ON RAISING INTEREST
RATES, BUT I THINK THAT STRONG
JOBS NUMBER MEANS THERE'S GOING
TO BE A BIT OF A FIGHT ON THE
ONE HAND BETWEEN THE GLOOMY
GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE ARE
IN, BUT THE STRENGTHENING U.S.
DATA, NOT JUST THE JOBS TODAY,
BUT WE ARE SEEING CORE
INFLATION, WHICH I THINK IS THE
THING YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT
GOING ABOUT THE 2% TARGET.
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT PROBABLY NOT
SEPTEMBER BUT BY DECEMBER THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A
STRENGTHENING CASE FOR THE U.S.
TO DO SOMETHING AS WELL.
VONNIE: CAN BRITAIN STAVE OFF
RECESSION EITHER THROUGH THE
BANK OF ENGLAND ACTIONS OR
THROUGH SOME OTHER WAY?
PETER: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES.
OBVIOUSLY THE 10% DEPRECIATION
AND STERLING IS GOING TO BE A
BIT OF A BUFFER.
THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEASURES
THAT I TALKED ABOUT WILL HELP
AND WE HAVE NOW HEARD THAT THE
U.K. GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO EASE
UP ON AUSTERITY MEASURES.
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE SAW A
BIG FISCAL STIMULUS FROM THE
CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT, BUT I
THINK ALL THOSE THINGS WILL
HELP, BUT I DO NOT THINK THEY
WILL BE ENOUGH COLLECTIVELY TO
STEM THE SCALE OF THE DOWNTURN
IN SENTIMENT WE ARE LIKELY TO
SEE.
MARK: HOW MUCH FURTHER WILL BE
SEE STERLING DECLINE, PETER?
I KNOW IT IS THE $50 BILLION
QUESTION THAT NOW.
COULD WE GO BELOW 120?
PETER: IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.
THE MOMENTUM ALONE IS BEING
DRIVEN BY PURE SENTIMENT.
IF YOU STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT
THE FUNDAMENTALS, YOU REALLY
NEED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S
GOING TO BE A SEVERE
DETERIORATION IN THE U.K. TRADE
TO WARRANT A SHIFT IN THE
EXCHANGE RATE.
AT THE MOMENT, WE DO NOT KNOW
WHAT THOSE TRADING RELATIONSHIPS
ARE GOING TO BE BETWEEN THE U.K.
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
THAT IS THE MOST PERNICIOUS
ASPECT OF THIS AT THE MOMENT
.
THEY'RE STILL VERY FEW SPECIFICS
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO DO WHAT.
MARK: IS IT GOOD FOR THE CURRENT
ACCOUNT OR BAD FOR THE CURRENT
ACCOUNT?
WE DO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT
ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS ALMOST AT A
RECORD LOW.
IS A GOOD OR IS IT BAD?
PETER: WEEK STERLING WOULD BE
GOOD, BUT THE UNDERLYING SHOCK,
WHICH IS  AN ALMOST CERTAIN
DETERIORATION IN OUR ABILITY TO
TRADE WITH THE EURO AREA AND
PROBABLY WITH THE REST OF THE
WORLD AS WELL, THAT'S GOING TO
TAKE A LONG TIME TO SORT OUT.
I THINK ALL THOSE THINGS ARE
GOING TO MAKE THE CURRENT
ACCOUNT WORSE THAN IT IS
ALREADY.
MARK: THANKS FOR JOINING US
TODAY.
PETER WEST AWAY A VANGUARD.
VONNIE: COMING UP, IS THE COLD
WORD BACK?
-- COLD WAR BACK?
U.S.-RUSSIA RELATIONS ARE
TENSE.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
MARK: YOU ARE WATCHING
BLOOMBERG.
I AM MARK BARTON.
VONNIE: I AM VONNIE QUINN AND
THIS IS YOUR GLOBAL BUSINESS
REPORT.
ITALY'S BANKS ARE GETTING
DESPERATE AND THE BANK OF A
LEASE GOVERNORS SAY INTERVENTION
MAY BE NECESSARY.
-- THINK OF ITALY'S GOVERNORS
SAY INTERVENTION MAY BE
NECESSARY.
MARK: BOEING WANTS TO SCUTTLE
THE SALES OF JETS TO IRAN.
VONNIE: ARE THE U.S. AND RUSSIA
ENTERING A NEW COLD WAR?
WE BEGIN IN ITALY WHERE THE BANK
SAYS IT IS WORKING INTENSELY
WITH AUTHORITIES ON A SOLUTION
FOR ITS BAD LOANS.
IT IS SAID TO BE THE SUBJECT OF
BAILOUT TALKS THAT HAVE LED TO A
 DEADLOCK.
THE BANK WANTS TO OFFLOAD 40% OF
ITS NONPERFORMING LOANS BY 2018.
THE BANK OF ITALY GOVERNOR SAYS
STATE INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT
BATTALION BANKS MAY BE NEEDED.
EARLIER ON BLOOMBERG, CITIGROUP
SAID THAT THE BANKING PROBLEM
GOES BEYOND THE BALANCE SHEET.
>> POLICY IN ITALY IS
THREATENING TODAY AS THE U.K.
POLITICS WERE THREATENING SIX
MONTHS OR YEAR AGO.
I'M AM MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE
POLITICS THAN THE BANKS PER SE.
MARK: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
HAS IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES FOR
OIL COMPANIES, ONES WHO WANT TO
DRILL IN ARCTIC WATERS.
DRILLERS WOULD HAVE TO STASH
EQUIPMENT NEARBY AND HAVE TO
TAKE COSTLY POTENTIAL STEPS
DESIGNED TO PREVENT OIL SPILLS.
THE ENERGY INDUSTRY SAYS THE
RULES WILL DISCOURAGE THE
 DEVELOPMENT.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE PUTTING
PRESSURE ON BOEING ON ITS
HISTORIC AGREEMENT TO SELL
PLANES TO IRAN'S NATIONAL
AIRLINE.
THE HOUSE IS PUTTING OUT
LEGISLATION TO BLOCK THE SALE.
THE BOEING DEAL WOULD BE THE
BIGGEST BUSINESS TRANSACTION
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN SINCE
THE 1979 REVOLUTION.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID IT
WILL  VETO ANY LEGISLATION
THAT WILL UNDERMINE THE NUCLEAR
AGREEMENT WITH IRAN.
AT ONE POINT TO -- A $1.2
BILLION DEAL FOR A LONG.
THE RIGHT HIT -- THE RIGHT
HAILING APP HAS RAISED DEAL ON
CREDIT.
VONNIE: TIME NOW FOR OUR
BLOOMBERG QUICK TAKE WHERE WE
DIVIDE CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND ON
ISSUES OF INTEREST.
IS A COLD WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND
THE UNITED STATES BACK?
HENRY KISSINGER SAYS IT'S
POSSIBLE.
THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER SAYS
IT IS HAPPENING.
IN THE UKRAINE, RUSSIAN TROOPS
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITH AN ARMY
OF PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS SINCE
2014.
U.S. CONGRESS VOTED TO SUPPLY
MORE WEAPONS TO THE UKRAINE
ARMY, BUT A CEASE-FIRE IS IN
PLACE.
IN SYRIA, RUSSIA'S AIR CAMPAIGN
HAS BEEN CONDUCTED IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO WHERE U.S. AIRCRAFT
IS DOING ITS OWN BOMBING AGAINST
THE ISLAMIC STATE.
THEY ARE HOPING TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES AGAINST RUSSIAN
AIRSTRIKES.
THAT WOULD'VE PUT U.S. AND
POSITION TO KILL RUSSIAN
SOLDIERS JUST AS AMERICAN ARMS
DID IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE 1980'S
AND SOVIET ARMS KILLED U.S.
TROOPS IN VIETNAM.
THE COLD WAR BEGAN IN 1947 WHEN
U.S. PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN
ASKED CONGRESS TO HELP STOP THE
SOVIET UNION FROM PROJECTING ITS
POWER.
SOVIET DIPLOMATS SAW THIS POLICY
AS IMPERIAL AGGRESSION FROM AN
AMERICAN ELITE, CLAIMING THE
 RIGHT TO LEAD THE WORLD.
IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1969 THAT THE
TWO SIDES SAW A KIND OF TRUCE
TO REDUCE THE WAR.
SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE COLD WAR
CANNOT REPEAT BECAUSE RUSSIA HAS
NO IDEOLOGY AS ALLURING AS
COMMUNISM.
THE COUNTERARGUMENT IS THAT
WHILE TODAY MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT
COLD WAR, IT SHOULD BE TREATED
SIMILARLY.
THAT IS BECAUSE RUSSIA CONTAINS
A VAST NUCLEAR ARSENAL AS WELL
AS THE WELL AND NUCLEAR MEANS TO
BE A SUPERPOWER.
FLAT AMERICANS RUPTUR --
VLADIMIR'S  RUSSIA MAY
NOT HAVE THE POWER, BUT A COLD
WAR ORACLE ONE COULD BE -- OR A
COOL ONE COULD BE COSTLY TO BOTH
SIDES.

MARK: STILL AHEAD, THE PERFECT
CALIFORNIA ROAD TRIP IN A
CONVERTIBLE ROLLS-ROYCE.
WE WILL PUT THE TOP DOWN NEXT.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
MARK: WE ARE 40 MINUTES AWAY
FROM THE END OF THE FRIDAY
EQUITY SESSION IN EUROPE.
WE HAVE A JOBS INDUCED RALLY.
STOCKS ARE HIGHER AND HAVE BEEN
GIVEN A PURSUIT BY TODAY'S JOB
REPORT.
THE STOXX 600 HAS RECEIVED A
BOOST WITH ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE
GAINS UP SINCE 1:30 A.M. U.K.
TIME.
GAINS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY.
WE ARE STILL LOOKING LIKE WE ARE
GOING TO FINISH LOWER IN EUROPE
AFTER A BIG RALLY LAST WEEK AT
3%.
STERLING WAS LOWER AGAINST THE
DOLLAR AND NOW IT IS UP TODAY,
UP A QUARTER OF 1%.
THE EURO IS DOWN AGAINST THE
POUND AND THE POUND IS UP
AGAINST THE YEN.
THE YEN IS THE BEST PERFORMING
CURRENCY OUT OF ALL THE MAJOR
PEERS SINCE JUNE 24.
WE HAVE YIELD LOWER IN THE U.K.,
GERMANY, ITALY, AND IN SPAIN.
IT IS ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS
WHERE YOU SEE STOCKS RISE AND
BONDS RISE AS WELL.
VONNIE: WE ARE SEEING STOCKS
RISE IN THE U.S. AS THE S&P 500
IS UP AND THE DOW IS UP 9/10 OF
A PERCENT.
BLOOMBERG PROCEEDS NEW THEORIES
DRIVE IS SHOWING THE ULTIMATE
ROAD TRIP THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
WE ARE SHOWING THE BEST ROUTE
AND THE FABIUS CARS THAT CAN
TAKE YOU THERE.
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE PERFECT
DRIVE ALONG THE CALIFORNIA
COAST.
>> WELCOME TO BLOOMBERG
PURSUITS: DRIVE.
TO MY MIND, THE SCENIC BYWAYS
ALONG CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAY ONE
IS AN UNPARALLELED WORLD-CLASS
DRIVING DESTINATION FOR EASE OF
 ACCESS AND COME DOUBLE
 COMFORTABLE VIEWS, THE ROAD
FROM BIG SUR TO SANTA BARBARA,
CALIFORNIA JUST CAN'T BE BEAT.
NATURALLY THE CAR YOU PICK TO
BIG SUR SHOULD BE AS EPIC AS THE
ROUTE.
I SUGGEST THE 2017 ROLLS-ROYCE
DAWN, THE CONVERTIBLE THAT
WILL START HITTING THE STREETS
IN THE FALL.
DAWN REFERS TO THE ORIGINAL
SILVER SAWN THAT ROLLS-ROYCE
MADE IN THE 1950'S.
ONLY 28 WERE MADE.
THIS NEW DAWN IS A $350,000
CRUISER JAMPACKED WITH LUXURIES
LIKE HANDSTITCHED LEATHER.
>> IT IS SO SMOOTH.
IT IS JUST LIKE ON THIS AIR
SUSPENSION.
YOU ARE BASICALLY ON A CLOUD.
THE STEERING IS REALLY NICE.
IT IS SO EASY TO STEER.
THE STEERING WHEEL IS REALLY
THIN, KIND OF LIKE A YACHT.
>> ROLLS-ROYCE HAS USED YACHT
MAKING TECHNIQUES BY THIRD AND
FOURTH GENERATION WORKERS FOR
YEARS.
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE LINES OF
THE BRUSHWOOD INTERIOR.
IT IS PERFECTLY SEAMLESS.
â™ª
>> THE DRIVE FROM SANTA BARBARA
TO CARMEL AT THE NORTHERN TIP OF
BIG SUR WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH
220 MILES OF ROCKY OUTCROPPINGS,
CRASHING WAVES, STANDING BEACHES
-- SANDY BEACHES, AND GREEN
MEADOWS.
MAKE A FIRST UP AT MORRO ROCK,
ABOUT TWO HOURS NORTH OF SANTA
BARBARA.
TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE
SHORELINE, ENJOYING THE SALT
Y AIR.
YOU SHOULD MAKE DINNER PLANS FOR
THE END OF YOUR DRIVE.
I RECOMMEND THE POST RANCH AND,
THE FAMOUSLY EXCLUSIVE THE SIDE
RESTAURANT -- CLIFFSIDE
RESTAURANT AND RESORT WERE
SOMETIMES ROOMS NEED TO BE
BOOKED A YEAR IN ADVANCE.
WITH THAT DELICIOUS MEAL AHEAD
OF YOU, ENJOY THE SMELL OF
FLOWERS AND OCEAN BREEZES WHILE
CONTINUING NORTH ON HIGHWAY ONE.
IF YOU'RE LUCKY, YOU MAY CATCH A
GLIMPSE OF WHALES BREACHING OFF
IN THE DISTANCE.
â™ª
>> LIKE BIG SUR ITSELF, THE
EXTERIOR OF THE DAWN HAS A
LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING -- SOFT
AROUND THE CORNERS AND IT LOOKS
A LITTLE FLATTENED OVERALL.
THE LED HEADLIGHTS AND NEWLY
REDESIGNED THRILLS GIVE IT SOME
EDGE.
THE EIGHT SPEED AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION IS PERFECT.
IT WORSE LIKE A POWERFUL ENGINE
LIGHT BUTTER ON  TOAST.
IT BREAKS TIGHTLY WHEN YOU WANT
TO STOP AND ENJOY A VIEW.
THE OVERALL EFFECT IS ONE OF
LUMBERING EASE.
SLOWDOWN, FRIEND, IT SEEMS TO
SAY.
LIFE IS MEANT TO BE ENJOYED.
STOP AND SEE THE SIGHTS.
â™ª
>> AND BESIDES SHOULD INCLUDE A
BRIEF SOJOURN AT THE STATE PARK,
ONE THOUSAND ACRES ON THE
WESTERN SLOPE OF THE SANTA LUCIA
MOUNTAINS AND IT MAKES FOR AN
AMAZING VANTAGE POINT.
AS EVENING APPROACHES,
EVERYTHING WILL BECOME QUIET.
WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED, YOU NOT
EVEN KNOW YOU WERE IN A
CONVERTIBLE.
YOU WILL ROLL INTO BIG SUR IN
THE EVENING JUST AS THE SUN RAYS
GIVE THE  ROCK AND SEE A
HEAVENLY GLOW.
AND THE POST RANCH INN COMPLETES
THE MAGICAL SETTING.
THE SERVICE AND THE BEAUTIFUL
GROUNDS OF EVERY PART OF POST
RANCH INN IS PERFECTLY MATCHED
BY THE CRAFTSMANSHIP AND
ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND A
ROLLS-ROYCE.
SO GET THE CAR, TAKE THE DRIVE,
STAY AT COAST BRANCH.
YOU WON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
VONNIE: THAT WAS BLOOMBERG
PURSUITS: DRIVE WITH HANNAH
ELLIOTT.
YOU CAN EXPLORE MORE STORIES ON
BLOOMBERG.
THE TRIPS AREN'T INCLUDED.
MARK: I NEED A HOLIDAY.
COMING UP, WE'LL FOCUS ON BIG
POUND TAKING OVER THE ARGENTINE
PESO TO BE THE WORST PERFORMING
CURRENCY THIS YEAR.
LOOKING AT THE BOE DECISION --
THE FIRST SINCE THE BREXIT VOTE
AS WELL.
VONNIE: ALSO, L WILL JOIN US.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
