this game was populated by some of the world's most famous wealthiest and most powerful men my regular game in New York City was a 250 thousand dollar Buy in No Limit so people were burning through that a lot of times in the first 30 minutes I saw someone lose a hundred million dollars in one night hi I'm Molly bloom I am the author of Molly's game and I'm here to talk about I guess why my life got made into a movie so I moved to Los Angeles my parents were not on board with that and so I had to get a lot of different jobs one of them was working for a man in Hollywood who had a weekly poker game and he said that he was going to it was going to be part of my responsibilities to help him out at the game and the first night I was there I recognized a really interesting opportunity to build a network and access to incredible information because this game was populated by some of the world's most famous wealthiest and most powerful men I think what what set this game apart was I wasn't a gambler and I wasn't running a game because I wanted to plan and I looked at it as a business I looked at it as a startup and I wanted to be able to expand my business and so I started seeking out players I started kind of looking in different corners of the country of the world and finding these whales finding these big gamblers they would contribute to this very compelling larger-than-life environment you know I recognized that these men had massive privilege they weren't interested in acquiring things they wanted experiences and I think I was able to create an experience that was very exciting there was an adrenaline component to it there was a blood sport component to it ultimately I recognized that there was certainly an addiction component to it I saw someone lose a hundred million dollars one night when you watch that as an owner-operator of a game you realize that these net Mercer incredibly unsustainable incredibly unhealthy so I was I was not happy about this loss it brought me no joy or adrenaline I it as a really unhealthy and unsustainable there were millions and millions and millions of dollars changing hands sometimes in a night it just and and and they just kept growing bigger I kept these games pretty intimate you know with this much money on the table with this much risk you wanted to make people feel safe and they don't want to feel like they're part of the spectator sport well the winners do but the losers do not
