well I saw this interesting tweet and I had never seen the facts put this way it's from Conservative MP from Saskatchewan Brad roast it says there are now more illegal asylum claims made in Canada than legal claims six thousand three hundred and seventy-three illegal border jumpers this year alone and it's only April three times the amount of illegal crossings in 2017 the government is projecting up to four hundred people a day to illegally cross our border this summer and joining us now via Skype is our friend Brad Rose it's great to see you again thanks for taking the time those are shocking numbers but it's shocking to me I think it's shocking to normal Canadians but this is not considered shocking to the media party to the political media establishment I don't think no I think I have to ask you they sort of anticipated this was going to shoot out we just had the Liberals say that got up 173 million dollars budgeted so far for this issue this year and I kind of suspect that's just the start you know how these things go numbers just go up as the spending goes through the year you know you mention hundred and sixty odd million dollars but that doesn't sound like it's even close to handling things we've seen Quebec say they're at the breaking point they're now shipping their illegal border crossers to Ontario we see the Mayor of Toronto John Tory saying we are bursting at the seams we already have quadruple the number of refugees in our homeless shelters as we had just a year or two ago so even center center-left politicians are starting to say it's just too much I saw news that a Parti québécois MNA in Quebec is actually talking about a border fence with the United States even people who are on the Left are saying it's too much what's the spirit in Parliament because looking at Justin Trudeau looking at Ahmed Hassan they don't seem to be blinking one bit yeah they start pretty much a sense of arrogance on this one they've been throwing stuff back to the Conservatives about you guys took away dental benefits from illegal refugees we don't have anything to learn from you guys you're all a bunch of heartless knuckle-dragging Neanderthals that's sort of been their attitude at this point a sort of a less than he fake mentality we're pushing back I mean as I said they just said 170 million one of our critics pointed out that 86 million is discontent on overtime for the various enforcement that because that's just the five books there's a muscle services by the provinces that doesn't count all sorts of education bills I mean essentially what the Americans are doing and what the illegal refugees doing is they're offloading a problem in the United States and they're unloading the problem into Canada and it's going to get worse and that's not a good thing for either regular Canadian citizens or for people who have gotten in line the proper way and one of them flying to come to Canada in the regular channels yeah you know it's is perplexing to me that the government would proceed in this way the Liberal government I mentioned this from time to time a poll taken by the Liberal government under Trudeau asked Canadians what they thought about the numbers of immigrants to Canada and only eight percent thought the numbers should be increased while they increased it from 250,000 three and a thousand and that was before this open border fake migrant problem from the states I can't believe that there's any broad-based support in any province in any demographic other than I suppose some direct immigration industry types but even there you know I think sober minded people would say it's broken you just can't force in tens of thousands of people like this I think that they're in jeopardy of actually burning up whatever remaining goodwill Canadians have towards immigrants I think this what they're doing being so reckless it will actually cause a backlash what do you think well I think that's absolutely to where you viewers don't know my voice and the immigrant from Asia is my goal I've got a bunch of family members who are there they're a lot more hardline tough on this the native-born Canadians is their attitude is I paid my dues I stood in line I waited I jumped through the hoops I worked hard to get here and now these people are cutting in front of the line so I think one of the things that a lot of viewers who are native-born Canadians should realize places like Toronto are going to get more upset about this than areas that are so far away they have no real day-to-day connection with this I think that's one of the things that people are actually have to understand anyone who's gone through the system really resents people cut into the front yeah I think you're right to talk about places like Toronto and Vancouver and to a degree Montreal those are the three cities that absorb the bulk of these migrants and they're also the places with the longest Hospital wait list with the the food bank shortages yeah yeah you're I mean every single social services being taxed and the thing is we're not even choosing who gets to jump to the front of line we're not making these choices these are people who are self deporting from the United States because they know they won't meet the legal standards they're either because of criminality or that just fake or whatever that's I think what's most infuriating it if if this was a deliberate selection of people that from around the world a winning thoughtful decision we could argue about it but at least it would be abiding the rule of law I think what's particularly grating here is the anarchy and that really the biggest scammers and the biggest tricksters get to go to the front of the line and Trudeau and Husson they don't even seem to care I think they sort of like it I think they I think they're enjoying this madness it's in league with stood with his tweet with Trudeau's tweet last year well here goes to their political strategy and I think this is all about politics for liberals they want to make the Conservatives look like a bunch of green shade accountants we're just heartless and me and that's what they're gonna try to do so they're gonna try to sack us in and say we don't care about human beings and play the same old dirty tricks they tried I mean we saw that back in the 2006 in election campaign I think they're just trying to make the Conservatives look like a bunch of meanies and that's the political strategy behind this I don't think there's any policy thinking about you know what's best for the country what's there and what's just needs to be all politics all the time yeah well I think you're right I mean that's I think they're extremists feminism gender equality everything gender equality in this new peacekeeping mission to Mali which is going to be I hate to say it a human disaster for our men and women in the in the armed forces I think it's all about being so absurd and provocative that anyone who dares speak out against it is racist sexist Islamophobic whatever that said I mean I agree with you that is their political tactic but I don't think that that should be a reason not to push back because you know putting aside the spin I think Canadians are mad about the substance and I think Canadians are getting a little sick of being scolded by the Liberals and the media as racist that misogynist that when I don't think we are as you point out even other new Canadians like your wife and her family they don't support this at all let me ask you this and I know that that you were a leadership candidate who did very well in the last conservative leadership but you did not win your nomination and you're in litigation with the party so I know that you have a certain position about the party you're still a Conservative MP is the concern and I'm putting those things out there just to disclose to our viewers that you you have sort of a special position in the party you're you're a conservative who has been at odds with the party and I'm not making a judgment I'm just making an observation do you think Andrew Shearer Michelle Rempel and the rest of the Conservative Party are fighting this issue vigorously enough and and I know you're a loyal conservative but you also have some disagreements why don't you tell me your candid answer candidly I think the problem for them is there's just so many issues right now to fight the Liberals on I mean the pipeline issue is something that is absolutely crucial so what's the problem is we've got so many issues to deal with we have to pick and choose their latest justice is an absolute atrocity so be honest it wasn't doing so many bad things it's tough to Q's so I'm encouraging them to double down and push harder on this one I think particular article back office also is too so I don't know be honest I'm a Western Canadian the pipeline thing is awfully big in Saskatchewan not quite as big in Alberta I kind of favor that one but I know our eastern Canadian EMPs are saying hey this isn't our backyard and so today the last couple days in Class B Street they hit it hard but I think that's exactly call and largely it's going to depend on what they hear from the grassroots yeah so if you figure this one big issue but again the problem is the limos are doing so many dumb stupid things it's kind of hard to concentrate on just one yeah it's a target-rich environment I'm glad to hear your quebec colleagues are on this issue because I think Rebecca has been the most frustrated by there where first the Haitians and the Salvadorians and none of whom are coming from those original countries most of them are just walking up from New York you can't be a refugee from New York and that's I think the frustration is the the scam there well listen Brad I really appreciate you coming on the show and speaking so candidly and I agree that you are conservative in the bone and that's how you ran your leadership campaign let me ask you what what what you think your political future is and I didn't mean to speak negatively a moment no I just wanted to to disclose to our viewers who might not have been following things in the last year so with you but what do you what do you think the political future holds for yourself you're pretty a young guy you have a lot of conservative values you did very well in leadership what's next I'll be back someday people who don't know I have a two and a half month old and I have three year old daughter at home so you know what I need to take a break I got some opportunities there like I lost my nomination literally by an inch frankly because half of my supporters didn't show up and another couple dozen so enough I'd be there so this is all about remember to vote people remember to vote and both of the candidates were more from the left side of the Conservative Party and they ganged up against beef so it's one of those things so I'll be back someday but when you got kids as young as mine maybe it's a not a bad thing too it out for you know six eight whatever years so yeah give me one last word about the new premier of Saskatchewan we haven't had a chance to have him on the show yet he looks like he's following in some of the good examples set by Brad wall who was certainly one of my favorite premiers in the last decade tell me tell me a little bit about the Saskatchewan premier do you know him have you worked with him in politics were you familiar with him from your travels in the province I don't know him personally as well as I knew two of the other contenders in there I knew two of them one very well one a little bit and the other too he's one I'm not too familiar with but everyone who does know him say he's really a grassroots sort of guy he sort of had never thought about running to be premier and this just sort of happened and he stepped up to the little do the to the plate so I think you're good to see a guy who's pretty humble and sort of a meat-and-potatoes pick two basic issues but he's gonna be not afraid to stand up first province that's the reading I get up a guy well that's sounds like a perfect fit for Saskatchewan a little bit humble a little bit grassroots solid reliable neighborly that's my favorite Saskatchewan adjective neighborly and and I think Brad wall it was sort of amazing to see a politician leave at the top of his game in Canada sometimes politicians stick around too long so listen good luck ends this guy's run good luck in your own plans I hope to talk to you again I mean I know you're not done right now you still are serving you you will yeah whooping I just say did I just say to your viewers continue to pray for the folks in humbled and in Saskatoon and I know in parts of Alberta who were impacted by the tragedy I represented humbled for 11 years in the House of Commons and those people are still going to need prayers going through the next week's and frankly the next year's so continue to think of having them in your thoughts thank you very much that's a very nice note to end on well it's great to talk to you right and we'll call on you from time to time I hope in the months ahead because there's so much to talk about you can be our one of our windows into Ottawa what's going on great to talk to you have a great one all right
