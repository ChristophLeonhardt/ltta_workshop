00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,510
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube so generally my audience</font>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">is pretty you're pretty red up right</font>

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,379
you're pretty savvy about the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,120
of you at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of you in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe</font>

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,099
will know that we have an election this

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,480
week we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose our</font>

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,219
representatives in the European

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,870
Parliament I've been sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font>

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,180
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out the best way to</font>

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,250
convince<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys that your voice is</font>

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,480
worth being heard essentially which is

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,849
surprisingly difficult because the

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,399
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EU and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem of</font>

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> elections that nobody really knows</font>

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
very much about them we had the

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,850
Eurovision Song contests little over a

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,539
week ago and Austria one with a bearded

18
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,940
dragon a D and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful for</font>

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,980
acceptance and wonderful things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,260
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I figured out was that in</font>

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,930
the last elections europe-wide we only

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,550
had a turnout of forty-three percent and

23
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last time we had Eurovision the</font>

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,920
number of people watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> was 170</font>

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,340
million which incidentally is actually

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the same number of people who</font>

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,750
turned out the vote last year which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,890
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> your vision was good and everything</font>

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,270
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss verse did really really well</font>

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,799
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit depressing right</font>

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,110
the UK actually hasn't even worse voter

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">turnout in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of Europe since 1979</font>

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,619
when we first had european-wide

34
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,000
elections to send people to Strasbourg

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">and has Brussels we have never had voter</font>

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,049
turnout higher than forty percent which

37
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,240
kind of makes me question the legitimacy

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,899
of the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are sending to</font>

39
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,079
represent the electorate of 45 million

40
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,009
eligible voters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UK but I guess</font>

41
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's another topic for another video I</font>

42
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,280
lived in a country without democracy for

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,210
a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I lived in China and I</font>

44
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,520
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it frustrating there that people</font>

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">were uninterested in politics but who</font>

46
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,500
can blame them when yes there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mayor</font>

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,220
who is corrupt and he is spending all of

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,050
your money on projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't</font>

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,000
want to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's nothing you</font>

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
can do about it right so the best thing

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to disengage yourself from it</font>

52
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,190
but what ended up happening is that they

53
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,790
started engaging with other countries

54
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,010
democratic processes Obama is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so popular</font>

55
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,140
over there probably more popular than he

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,800
is in the USA to be completely honest

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,330
and there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> an A in innate desire I</font>

58
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,410
think in humanity to have your voice

59
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,840
heard and for those people who are

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">making decisions about your life to have</font>

61
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,200
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certain form of legitimacy I</font>

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,610
keep on keep bringing up the word

63
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,800
legitimacy and I want our EU to be

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,890
legitimate because<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise they were</font>

65
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,090
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be things that you don't agree</font>

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that go through maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're pro or</font>

67
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,340
anti having a European army because

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,870
that's probably going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voted on in</font>

69
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,810
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years of European</font>

70
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,330
Parliament so but you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

71
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">um there's the actor arm legislation</font>

72
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,850
which is got a load really dodgy wording

73
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,950
about like internet freedoms and the

74
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,489
ability to share content<font color="#E5E5E5"> online um and</font>

75
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,230
that's being batted around<font color="#E5E5E5"> European</font>

76
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Parliament at the moment there's the</font>

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,549
huge trade agreement that is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

78
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,660
between the USA and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the EU the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> largest</font>

79
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,370
trade agreement ever in the history of

80
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,860
humanity<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and there's a load of</font>

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,140
trouble with that possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,880
corporations being able to take money

83
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,720
away from governments and like take like

84
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,299
it's all a bit crappy there's also like

85
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,489
banking regulation and the capping<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

86
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,730
bonuses and financial reform and like

87
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,650
Social Welfare small things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> food</font>

88
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,870
packaging and labeling and the fact that

89
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,450
you can work and study anywhere in the U

90
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,560
you like that I am NOT going to sit here

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,830
and tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> my political stance because</font>

92
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,370
those of you who watch these videos will

93
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,830
no my political stance but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are going</font>

94
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,570
to have an opinion on the things that

95
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe votes on and so you'd better damn</font>

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,680
well do your research on the people that

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,919
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking the box of this week</font>

98
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise if you decide to just</font>

99
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,610
sit this out because you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

100
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,070
keep a boy d 1 then I'm sorry but you

101
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">have no right to be annoyed at anything</font>

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,900
that Nigel Farage says on question time

103
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,880
ever again the most important thing here

104
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,680
is voter engagement and there was

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,930
there's a minor part in the UK called

106
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,699
the the pirate party and they had a very

107
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">good advert that shows the problem with</font>

108
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,470
low voter turnout the fact that if only

109
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of people turn</font>

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,630
out you only need overall about ten

111
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,210
percent or even lower of the population

112
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,699
to vote for a crazy party and a crazy

113
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,770
party will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in now I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">say any names cuz the you could video</font>

115
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,450
will come later but we sent to BMP

116
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">British national party like a fascist</font>

117
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,000
party we sent two Emmys to Europe last

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,860
time and I really wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we learned</font>

119
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,630
our lesson but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have so</font>

120
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,070
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how i've been feeling about</font>

121
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,950
the european elections this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

122
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,349
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different video look I'm</font>

123
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,560
unscripted<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some questions what's</font>

right all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over Europe and why do you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of Europe is so disengaged and how can</font>
