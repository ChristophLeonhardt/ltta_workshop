with us now someone who's quite familiar with both stormy and evanka senior reporter Vanity Fair and now at NBC News and MSNBC contributor Emily Jane Fox she has a new piece actually has a couple this morning on both topics John Heilemann take it away yeah Emily I just want to get right to the to the most recent piece of news you have which is this notion that Bob Muller might be looking at payments made to women not just stormy Daniels but to other women who were paid for their silence so just to give us a sense of where of what what you have to report on that topic so a source directly familiar with the line of questioning that Muller's team has been asking witnesses told me there have been questions posed to people who they have interviewed about payments made to women I don't know which women the questions were I don't know if they were specific but there have been questions posed and so I think that that answers one of the major questions that was left hanging last night during 60 minutes where there were experts asked do you think that this is red meat for Bob Muller and the answer in 60 minutes at least was yes and it seems that this source provided an answer for me did you have a sense this is a kind of a question I think that will come up as people a if Moeller is in fact looking at this stuff you know the president has tried to draw a red line where he said you know don't look at my business dealings you can only look at the election don't look at my past but just business dealings that might touch on Russia it's always seemed to me on the merits a ludicrous position for the president take given that if you're asking me about questions of collusion the president's business history related to Russia is relevant this these questions however if you were a pro Trump for of a pro Trump a defender you would ask the question what does this have to do with Russia what does this have to do with collusion on what basis does Bob Muller start to take his inquiry away from the core questions of what how Russia may have influenced the election and towards questions of the president's consensual relations with with various women towards contractual relations he might have to buy their silence what's the basis on which Muller would extend his investigation in that direction I think that's a great question you have to put this into context of this payment was made eleven days before the election so it's an extra inextricable with the election it's completely tied to what happened and I also think that the way that this could be used is a way to talk to other witness and other targets and subjects in the investigation saying look we may have you on something that is an illegal campaign donation what else do you got for us yeah you know Mike Barnicle the question also may be what is what's the land deal have to do with Monica Lewinsky that's what certainly what the Clinton people were asking back in the 1990s once these things start moving they can go in any direction Joe that's absolutely correct you know it's it's funny it's correct in almost every major investigation that we've heard of over the past 20-30 years it's always something that you're not looking for that they trip over while they're looking for the bigger thing and they find right a needle thing well exactly you look at you look at Spiro Agnew for instance Spiro Agnew didn't go to jail because in Watergate he went to jail because of IRS violations you can look at the people around Nixon he'd most of them where a lot of them didn't go to jail because you know they had anything to do with the break-in or the conspiracy they went to jail for a variety of different reasons yeah and it's always like that Emily also in Vanity Fair you have a column in the April issue that details how Ivanka Trump is handling her role at the White House alongside her husband Jared Kushner and the impact it's having on their reputations in the piece you write in part quote according to one longtime friend of the president if it came down to Donald Trump saving himself or defending his son-in-law there would be no hesitation I think he's going to tie himself to the kid you don't know anything this person said they're going to cost him his legacy not a chance according to one former Trump advisor the president is keeping Kushner around in part because he fears letting him out of his sight particularly if he gets indicted which invites the question if Ivanka Trump had to choose between her husband and her father what would she do do you have an answer to that question I don't and were far away from that point at least right now it's an interesting web that these people have all weaved in their motivations far and wide for all of them there is obviously a duty that Ivanka feels to her father that's in part why she came to Washington to stand by her father and serve in his administration but Jared Kushner provides her a security that she never had growing up she provides her stability and the cushion her family is also also very independently wealthy in a way that the Trump family is not now we don't know the full extent of Donald Trump's wealth because he won't release his tax returns but but there is a incentive for her to stay with Jared Kushner when it comes down to choosing between her father and her husband if it comes down to that it's an impossible choice to even predict well you know Emily that was one of the things that surprised me about your article in most just how much wealthier Jared Kushner is and Donald Trump how much wealthier the Kushner family is than Trump and of course with trumpets a lot of booms and busts and booms and busts but you talked about them reporting how much money they were worth the overwhelming majority of it came from the Kushner side of the family and only a small small pittance actually came from the Trump side sure I mean we're talking about big sums of money I believe that the number that we put in the final piece with that Ivanka in the years since the election had made 12 million dollars so she would be fine perfectly fine just on her own but I know but I say I said small small pittance just to get under the president's skin I compare that you compare that though to the Kushner's and Jared Kushner obviously himself has a lot more money than Donald Trump right it's hard to say it's hard to say exactly how much the president is worth because we have no idea he is we have blustered for years about how much he is worth and reports have blown back on that and and he has not released his tax return so it's hard to say but Jared Kushner at 37 years old is worth a tremendous amount of money it is unclear how much Donald Trump at 71 is worth so let's just talk about the numbers before we go to break really quickly what were the numbers again when when they had to report how much they were worth Ivanka Trump 12 million and Jared Kushner how much I think it was their combined net worth was over 700 million dollars at the last financial reporting and and then the 12 million dollar figure was how much she had made within eight years so factored it all in the the gap is quite wide yeah overwhelming majority the money coming from the Kushner's and certainly not from the trumps all right Emily Jane Fox thank you so much great to have you on the show we're gonna be looking for your new article in the April issue of Vanity Fair boy John Heilemann Canyon the disparity there between the Trump's and the Kushner's well yeah although as Emily points out you know we don't really know about about what Donald Trump is worth I just wanted I come back to the earlier comment you know if you see what you think about where this is headed Joe and I think it's gonna be fascinating the comment which was would Donald Trump if he had a choice between saving himself and saving his son-in-law what do you do well we know what Donald Trump would do he'd save himself what he didn't throw his son-in-law overboard but the reverse question is equally relevant as Bob Muller starts to put pressure on Jared Kushner would Kushner given the Chafee if Kushner had to save himself would he be willing to throw his father-in-law over the side of the boat and I think you know if he end up in a heartbeat says Mike Barnicle I think that's what we're headed Bob motors gonna try to roll up Jared Kushner but Kushner in a position where he is potentially being indicted and say look hey I'm gonna indict you unless you want to flip on your father-in-law and I think there's no loyal I mean I don't say there's no loyalty I think in both cases both of those guys would happily flip on the other one or willingly flip it became to saving their own skins well they'll protect themselves and then of course you have Eric Schneiderman in New York State who is moving full steam ahead as well and he's moving full steam ahead on investigations against both Trump and the cushion I believe and of course in but in those cases there is no presidential pardon so things are about to become far more complicated for both families coming out we've been mentioning his name a lot this morning and in just five minutes attorney Michael a vanetti joins a conversation live on Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on
