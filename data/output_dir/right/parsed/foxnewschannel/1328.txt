BALANCE.
NOW TO DAVID LEE MILLER WHERE
IT'S ABOUT TO GO DOWN.
GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.
>> HELLO, MARIA FROM THE EAST
SIDE OF MANHATTAN.
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THE
KOREAN DIPLOMAT ARRIVED IN
NEW YORK, KIM YOUNG CHUL.
HE'S A FORMER SPY BOSS FOR NORTH
KOREA AND A FORMER FOUR-STAR
GENERAL.
HE'S A CLOSE AND TRUSTED
CONFIDANT OF KIM JONG-UN.
HE ARRIVED THIS AFTERNOON ON
J.F.K. AIRPORT AN AN AIR CHINA
AIRLINER.
THERE WERE FIVE OTHERS IN HIS
DELEGATION.
THE U.S. GRANTED KIM YOUNG CHUL
A SANCTIONS TRAVEL WAIVE TORE
MAKE THIS TRIP.
MOMENTS AGO HE ENTERED HIS
MOTEL, WHICH IS A FEW BLOCKS
FROM THE U.N.
IT'S USED FOR FOREIGN
DELEGATIONS.
AS FOR THE MEETINGS WITH MIKE
POMPEO, THERE ARE MULTIPLE
MEETINGS THAT ARE SET.
IF A FEW HOURS TIME, THE TWO MEN
WILL SIT FACE TO FACE AND HAVE
DINNER.
THEY HAVE MET TWICE BEFORE.
WHAT THEY WILL DISCUSS ABOUT THE
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS NOT ENTIRELY
CLEAR.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN
ADDITION TO WHAT IS HAPPENING
HERE IN NEW YORK, MARIA, THERE'S
TWO OTHER MEETINGS THIS WEEK
TAKING PLACE OVERSEAS BETWEEN
THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREAN
DELEGATIONS IN SING PORE,
THEY'RE DISCUSSING THE LOGISTICS
OF A POSSIBLE SUMMIT AND IN THE
DMZ, THEY'RE DISCUSSING THE
COMPONENTS OF A POSSIBLE AGENDA
FOR A PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, WHAT
IS HAPPENING HERE IN NEW YORK
CITY AND WILL BE TAKING PLACE IN
THE NEXT 24 HOURS OR SO COULD
VERY WELL MAKE OR BREAK THE
POSSIBILITY OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN
KIM JONG-UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.
LASTLY, UNDERSCORING JUST HOW
SIGNIFICANT THIS DIPLOMAT IS,
HE'S THE HIGHEST RANKING NORTH
KOREAN DIPLOMAT TO COME TO THE
UNITED STATES IN 18 YEARS.
THE MEETING BETWEEN POMPEO AND
THE NORTH KOREAN SLATED TO TAKE
PLACE OVER DINER IN THE NEXT FEW
HOURS.
BACK TO YOU.
>> SO WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN
TERMS OF THE PROCESS AND THE
DETAILS OF JUNE 12?
>> I THINK THIS MEETING IS GOING
TO EITHER PUT UP A STOP SIGN OR
A GREEN LIGHT AS TO WHETHER OR
NOT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE GOING
TO BE COOPERATIVE WHEN IT COMES
TO HOLDING A SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE
ON JUNE 12.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID JUNE 12 IS
STILL ON THE DRAWING BOARD, BUT
I THINK MUCH WILL DEPEND ON THE
OUTCOME OF THIS MEETING.
THE NORTH KOREANS WILL HAVE TO
SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO MEET SOME
OF THE U.S. DEMANDS TO START THE
PROCESS OF DISMANTLING THEIR
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THAT SAID, ACCORDING TO ONE
REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED A SHORT
TIME AGO, ONE EXPERT HAS SAID
THAT DISMANTLING THAT PROGRAM IS
GOING TO TAKE AS LONG AS 15
YEARS.
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAM
THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR
DECADES.
THE U.S. WILL WANT TO SEE SOME
