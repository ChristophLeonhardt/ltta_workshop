1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,974
The Land of Salt and Fire

2
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:16,614
Dallol, Ethiopia

3
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,919
It is so hot here,

4
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,529
the hottest place on earth.

5
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,993
I come here to push my imagination.

6
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,003
To see something new.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,080
To understand how this place

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,550
is possible, I’ll take you to the white.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,677
To the salt.

10
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,328
I’m Andrea Frazzetta, there on the back

11
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,023
of the car, with the camera.

12
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:55,592
I’m a photographer.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,069
And we are driving across the bottom

14
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:02,697
of an ancient ocean,

15
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,880
now a thick bed of salt.

16
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,796
It is so hot you can imagine how

17
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:16,935
10,000 years ago the sun evaporated

18
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,731
the ocean, leaving behind the

19
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:21,018
vast plain of salt.

20
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:29,485
Salt that the Afar people

21
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:31,551
have been mining for centuries.

22
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:38,246
They shape the salt into those blocks

23
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:40,665
at your feet to sell at market.

24
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,183
The blocks were once so valuable

25
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,196
they were used as money.

26
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:56,740
The miners are working now, but the week

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,727
before, they had gone on strike

28
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:01,637
to protest the falling price of salt.

29
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:12,112
I met a man named Kedir

30
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,811
who cut salt for 46 years.

31
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,824
"The salt is right here on our doorstep.

32
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:22,661
Our fathers mined salt to raise us

33
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:26,196
and we do it to raise our children.

34
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,400
In the hot season, we hire help.”

35
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:39,526
“I think, in the future, the government

36
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,381
will give the work to outside companies,

37
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:48,190
and that the traditional way we mine salt

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,918
with camel caravans will end.”

39
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,145
Roads are being built in this area

40
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,245
of Ethiopia, which brings access,

41
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:05,321
and new mining techniques. If it’s easier

42
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,197
to move the salt, that means fewer

43
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:10,417
camel caravans each week.

44
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:20,915
Across the salt plain, there is another

45
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:24,050
industry growing. Tourism.

46
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,142
That’s Ali. His father was a salt miner.

47
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:47,246
But Ali has chosen a different path.

48
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,210
"I work as a local guide to bring tourists

49
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,443
to Dallol."

50
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,616
"I have lived in Dallol all my life.

51
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:08,406
Every day brings new things.

52
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:11,693
New people, new colors.

53
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:15,695
It never stops changing."

54
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:25,144
Because just under our feet is one of the

55
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,788
most active tectonic zones in the world.

56
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,844
Magma heats the groundwater, pushing it up

57
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,330
through cracks in the crust of the earth.

58
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:42,187
The water mixes with minerals and the salt

59
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:45,309
to create these rock formations and colors.

60
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,627
Sulphur makes the yellow,

61
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,984
copper makes the green.

62
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:56,066
Iron brings the red.

63
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:11,578
This landscape, a geyser island sitting

64
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,253
in the middle of the vast salt plain,

65
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,722
is like no other place in the world.

66
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,269
It’s a reminder that, just as the Afar

67
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,278
adapt to the forces that are changing

68
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:41,512
their traditional way of life, the earth

69
00:05:41,512 --> 00:00:00,000
keeps shaping and shifting under our feet.
