YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT OKAY, USING SOMEONE'S MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES AS A WEAPON WHEN YOU ATTACK THEM FOR, BASICALLY, YOU DON'T HAVE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THEM. SO YOU JUST SAY THEY ARE NUTS. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH KANYE WEST. HIS POLITICAL VIEWS NOT ALL THAT IMPORTANT. YOU JUST HURL INSULTS AT HIM TO TRY TO DEMONIZE HIM. IT IS SIMPLY DISGUSTING. THIS WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT. KANYE'S MOTHER IS ROLLING OVER IN HER GRAVE. NOT ONLY WAS THIS A CRAZY CONVERSATION FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE HELD BETWEEN PEOPLE WEARING HOSPITAL BRACELETS. I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS OPEN TO HELP. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PUBLIC CRY FOR HELP. HE IS NOT GETTING ANY HELP. THERE WAS A RANTING LUNATIC IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY. KANYE, BACK AWAY FROM THE CAMERAS. GO GET SOME HELP AND THEN COME BACK AND MAKE YOUR CASE. GET HELP? DR. LEMON, WHY ARE YOU STIGMATIZING PEOPLE WHO BATTLE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. HOW DARE YOU FRY TO MINIMIZE WHAT HE IS SAYING BECAUSE HE IS OPEN ABOUT SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HE IS HAVING. DON LEMON IS A GOOD GUY. JOINING ME, PATRICK CORYGAN, AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "THE STIGMA EFFECT QUIT. HOW DELETERIOUS IS IT FOR ANYONE IN THE RIGHT WING OR LEFT WING TO EXPLOIT ANOTHER PERSON'S MEDICAL HISTORY AS WAS DONE OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS REGARDING KANYE WEST? REDUCING SOMEBODY'S CONVERSATION TO IL LEGITIMACY BY SAYING THEY ARE MENTALLY ILL IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS STIGMA RELATED TO RACISM, SEXISM, HOMO PHOBIA, IT IS SAYING YOUR MESSAGE DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD AN ISSUE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER OR MENTAL ILLNESS. PEOPLE LABELED ARE UNABLE TO GET JOBS, LIVE INDEPENDENTLY, GET GOOD HEALTH CARE. IT IS ALL BECAUSE MESSAGES LIKE THIS PERPETUATE THEM AS BEING DIFFERENT OR WORSE THAN WE ARE. PROFESSOR, IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD DETER PEOPLE FROM GETTING COUNSELING. LET'S SAY THEY LOST A PARENT, WENT THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIME, IF THEY KNOW LATER ON THEY ARE GOING TO BE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO GOT HELP. AS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PERIOD OF TIME, WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TALK TO OTHERS, TO GET HELP. TO ME, IN THIS CASE, ITS MOSTLY LIBERALS SADLY IN THIS SITUATION WHO ARE DEMONIZING SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE, I GUESS, THEY ARE IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH TRUMP AND THROWN IN THE CRAZYTOWN DEAL AS A WAY TO DEMONIZE HIM AND DISMISS HIM. ANY TIME YOU THROW IN THE WORD CRAZY, WHETHER IT COMES FROM THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT, IT UNDERMINES THE OPPORTUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. BY THE WAY, THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. EPIDEMIOLOGY SUGGESTS IT COULD BE ONE OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE HAVE A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. THE STIGMA FUNDAMENTALLY COMES FROM THE LABEL. I AM SEEING SOMEBODY COME OUT OF THE PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE AND I KNOW THEY MUST BE NUTS OR COMING
