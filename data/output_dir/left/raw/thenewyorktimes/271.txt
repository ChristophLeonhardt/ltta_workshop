1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,450
“We never anticipated having
that sense of community

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,210
on our doorstep.”

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,080
“It was a hell of a good
home, and we could afford it.”

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,430
“Hopefully, our authorities
can win our trust back again.”

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,090
“Harvey took away from us
our normal everyday life

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,200
that you go through.”

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,910
“Nobody anticipated it,
so very few people really

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,860
were prepared for it.”

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,380
“Our community is right
next to the reservoir.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,900
And they knew that,
because they designed it.”

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,090
“The nation’s fourth
largest city, Houston,

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,594
bracing for
catastrophic flooding.”

13
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,260
“The Army Corps of
Engineers say in order

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,250
to save homes downstream, it
has to flood others upstream.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,290
That includes homes in
Cinco Ranch and Bear Creek.”

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,280
“3,000 homes got water
behind the Barker Reservoir.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,940
Harvey didn’t flood them — 
the federal government flooded

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,160
them.”

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,130
“A lot of people think that
they did that to save downtown,

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,710
and I understand.

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,000
But now we need help.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,530
We need help, too.”

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,420
“What do we do next?

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,170
How do we solve this thing
without going dead broke?”

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,020
“Much of our developed area on
the east side of the county

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,080
is protected by levees.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,680
The reservoir was backing
up like a bathtub filling.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,930
We didn’t know exactly
how high it would rise.”

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,900
“This storm, 38 inches of rain
in about a three day period,

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,350
is probably almost total for
the year what we normally get.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,350
Had those flows gone
around the ends of the dam,

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,360
they would have caused a
great deal of flooding.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,910
So we had to make
a tough decision.”

34
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,790
“We have opened the gates,
and we are actually

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,640
flooding homes downstream now.”

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,922
“This area is designed to
hold that water if necessary.

37
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:54,380
It’s unfortunate for you all,
but that’s how it’s designed.”

38
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:21,520
“Oh, my God.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,340
Already has — already
has mold growing.

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,950
God.

42
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,447
Almost no one around
here has flood insurance.

43
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:42,280
It’s not supposed to
be an area that floods.”

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,880
“Everything I own
was in that house.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,868
I lost my wife about a year ago.

46
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:17,270
And so there was a lot of
emotion, and a lot of memories

47
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,440
that I have to not think about.”

48
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:28,820
“As we were driving into the
neighborhood, Lily kept saying,

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,249
it feels so weird to be here.

50
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:31,790
We were trying to
kind of prepare her

51
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,360
that it’s going to
look a lot different.”

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,050
“And it’s like it’s
a huge stupid beach.

53
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,880
It’s usually like
there’s so much grass.

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,770
All the kids running around.

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,780
It just feels weird
seeing it like this,

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,500
because all this
trash is never here.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,840
It was like so high and scary.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,730
Like, first the
water was up to here.

59
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,610
Then it started getting
into the houses.

60
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,800
See this like
Post-it note thing?

61
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,520
My mom told me it was like, make
sure there’s no dead bodies.”

62
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,340
“He has been so
obsessed with looking

63
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,470
through flooding pictures.

64
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,930
At least five times a day,
he wants to look and see

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,970
the house when it first
flooded and the picture

66
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,899
of Lily’s school.”

67
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,430
“So the grant is
a max of $33,300,

68
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,190
and you can only get that
once you’ve been inspected.

69
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,890
We have almost
800,000 registrations

70
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,097
in the state of Texas alone.

71
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:35,680
Right now it’s just
a waiting process,

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,590
because it does take while
for them to get to you.”

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,770
“So what’s going to happen
is, don’t freak out,

74
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,990
you’re going to get a
denial letter from FEMA,

75
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,245
because you have a homeowners.

76
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:48,130
But when you get your reward
letter from your homeowners,

77
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,410
telling how much
they’re paying you,

78
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,553
you’re going bring a copy
of that letter to me.

79
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:55,450
And I’m going to fax
it to Washington,

80
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,216
and then FEMA picks back up
what the homeowners didn’t pay.”

81
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,900
“O.K. But then —

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,410
O.K.”

83
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,310
“O.K.?”

84
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,480
“Now what do I do for wheels?”

85
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,369
“For that?

86
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:05,910
I don’t know.”

87
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,180
“I mean, you’re it?

88
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,719
I don’t qualify?”

89
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,010
“It’s left up to your inspector.

90
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,720
It ain’t left up to me.”

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
“How about accommodations?

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,350
My daughter is
selling her house.

93
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,180
I’m out of —

94
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,230
I have no place to go.”

95
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,922
“I’ll put that in your notes.”

96
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:34,020
“Homes were
substantially destroyed,

97
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,630
and I think you really have
to make a serious decisions as

98
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,310
to whether you want to rebuild.

99
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,580
If I lived behind that
reservoir and my house

100
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,920
had four or four and a
half feet of water in it,

101
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,156
I don’t think I could rebuild.

102
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,280
I wouldn’t want to rebuild.”

103
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,078
“We’re paying the
mortgage and the rent.

104
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,670
We do get a low
interest loan from FEMA,

105
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,040
and so that helps a lot.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,940
We live with my
daughter and her kids.

107
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,130
We want my grandkids to grow up here.”

108
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,892
“There were lots of
sleepless nights —

109
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:20,850
where was the money going
to come from in order

110
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,590
to rebuild our house?

111
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,870
But we did receive a
small grant from FEMA,

112
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,762
and the church was able to cover
three months worth of rent.

113
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,470
I think we both just
sat there and cried.

114
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,350
It was so overwhelming.

115
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,690
We were so fortunate.

116
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,505
None of my other neighbors
are in a similar situation.”

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,580
“So the hurricane hit, right?

118
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,870
Now, it’s react time.

119
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,270
What are you going to
do with your property?

120
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,030
The longer you
hesitate, the more

121
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,850
damage that’s going to
accrue on your house.

122
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,720
As horrible as it’s
been, everybody

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,450
has been pretty
upbeat and happy.

124
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,260
Hello, sir.

125
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,370
Not everybody, but most people.

126
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Hey, how are you doing, sir?

127
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,640
I’m James.

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,830
I’m James Smith with Keller
Williams Energy Corridor

129
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,329
Realty.

130
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,017
How are you?

131
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,850
I was just wondering
how everybody is doing?”

132
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,490
“About in the same shape.

133
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,360
Waiting on FEMA, most of us.

134
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
And S.B.A. loans.”

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,620
“Got you.”

136
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,959
“Just in a holding pattern
until we can repair our homes.”

137
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,500
“If you give me a
call, I can give you

138
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,860
some information on the
proper people that come in

139
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,630
and get in contact with.

140
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,300
All my advice is going
to be at no cost to you.

141
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,822
And if I ever can help
you, just give me a call.”

142
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:45,000
“Appreciate it.”

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,520
“No problem.

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,142
I’ll let you get
back to work, sir.

145
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:48,600
So there’s a lot
of properties that

146
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,650
actually went into foreclosure.

147
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,330
A lot of those
now the bank owns.

148
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,400
Let’s go.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,800
You be careful.

150
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Now, they’re going to
be totally renovated

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,302
with all the new items on it.

152
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,010
Because there’s too
many people selling —

153
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,870
that’s going to create
a buyer’s market.

154
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,310
They can kind of set the price.”

155
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,440
“I’m 87.

156
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,770
I’m not going to spend the last
years of my life building back

157
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,426
a house that I ain't
going to go and live in.

158
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:19,300
I’m going to sell it.

159
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,340
We just don’t talk about
what has gone and will never

160
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,620
be back.”

161
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,570
“There’s Dad.

162
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,095
Look at my beautiful mother.”

163
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,510
“See, all that furniture
sitting out on the lawn

164
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:51,145
was 62 years of
accumulation, of memories.

165
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:55,105
And, that hurts.”

166
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,110
“For a while there, it looked
like a ghost town in here.

167
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,250
I’d say, like a quarter
of the community is back.

168
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,624
All right.

169
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,040
We still have a lot of little
things that have to be done,

170
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,790
but we’re home.”

171
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,550
“It feels exciting to
be back in the house,

172
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,230
and a little bit overwhelming.”

173
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:36,340
“Where are all the
flooded pictures?”

174
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,150
“You want to see all
the flooded pictures?”

175
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,650
“Yeah.

176
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,610
Where are they?”

177
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,890
“Remember when our
house looked like that?”

178
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,390
“Yeah.

179
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,740
I want to see the X on it.”

180
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,367
“Oh, I don’t think I took
a picture of the X.

181
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:49,950
You know what?

182
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,760
Maybe I did.

183
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,840
Hold on, let me look.

184
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,490
There it is.”

185
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,290
“I love to move back in.”

186
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,470
“We already moved
back in, didn’t we?

187
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,026
So did we get to take that down?”

188
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:01,526
“Yeah.”

189
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:05,706
“Yeah, it’s not there
anymore, is it?

190
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:10,325
I can’t describe how happy I
am to be back in my own house.

191
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:14,322
I do you have a sense of guilt
that comes along with it.

192
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,030
There’s a lot of people
that haven’t even

193
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,960
had their FEMA visits.”

194
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,010
“For my own sanity, I got to stay
positive and moving forward.”

195
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,890
“Our community never should
have been developed.

196
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,865
It’s hundreds and
hundreds of houses.

197
00:10:43,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Now we are proof that we
need better regulations.”
