>>RENT IN MIAMI HAS BECOME SO
EXPENSIVE THAT TEACHERS WHO WORK
IN THE MIAMI-DADE DISTRICT ARE
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME
PAYING RENT.
THEY HAVE RESPONDED BY PROPOSING
NEW BUILDINGS CLOSE TO THE
SCHOOLS THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY
OFFER CHEAPER RENT FOR THESE
EDUCATORS AND POSSIBLY OTHER
EMPLOYEES 
IN 
THE SCHOOLS.
WHEN I FIRST READ THE HEADLINES
OF THE STORY I THOUGHT MAYBE
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
JUST PAY TEACHERS MORE SO THEY
CAN AFFORD THE RENT.
THE RENT IN THESE AREAS ARE
EXPENSIVE FOR EVERYONE.
BASED ON WHAT I HAVE SEEN SO FAR
IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD
IDEA.
THE TEACHERS ARE PRETTY
SUPPORTIVE OF IT.
LET ME TELL YOU MORE.
SO THEY WOULD PRICE THE UNITS
BASED ON A SLIDING SCALE AND OF
COURSE IT WOULD RELY ON WHAT THE
TEACHER OR THE EMPLOYEE IS
MAKING FOR THEIR SALARY.
>>I
HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS.
ON THE ONE HAND IT IS WONDERFUL
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET A
COMBINATION AND LOWER RENTS AND
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING
OUT FOR THE TEACHERS.
ON THE OTHER HAND IT
FEELS LIKE THE BARRACKS.
AND IF THEY ARE IN THE SAME
BUILDING THEN THEY ARE GOING TO
PICK THE TEACHERS LIVES.
WHAT THE TEACHER BRINGS HOME A
BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND AND THEY
DO WHAT BOYFRIENDS AND
GIRLFRIENDS DO?
WHAT DO 
WE JUST
PAY OUR TEACHERS MORE?
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.
EVEN SO EVEN IF THE TEACHERS ARE
GETTING PAID MORE, RENTS IN
THESE AREAS ARE SO EXPENSIVE.
THERE IS ANOTHER UPSIDE TO THIS
THAT I THINK MAYBE YOU ARE NOT
CONSIDERING.
THEY ARE GOING TO BE CLOSE TO
WORK AND FOR SOME OF US THAT
MIGHT SOUND LIKE I AM LIVING AT
WORK, BUT A LOT OF THEM LOVE THE
IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO JUST WALK
AROUND THE CORNER FROM THEIR
APARTMENT BUILDING AND WALKED
INTO WORK AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE COMMUTE.
MIAMI IS NOTORIOUSLY BAD WHEN
IT COMES TO TRAFFIC.
I WOULD ARGUE PERSONNEL ABLE
PEOPLE WOULD DISAGREE WITH ME.
>>ANOTHER
UPSIDE IS THAT YOU SAVE GAS.
ANOTHER UPSIDE IS THAT THEY
WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD
LIVING THERE ON A TEACHER
SALARY.
OTHER DOWNSIDES, YOU ARE
PROBABLY IN THE SAME APARTMENT
COMPLEX IS THE PRINCIPAL.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVER
KNOWN TEACHERS WHO WORKED IN THE
SCHOOLS THERE IS A TON OF
POLITICS.
AND YOU ARE IN THE SAME BUILDING
AND CAN'T ESCAPE THEM.
>> YOU MENTION A PRETTY
SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE.
BEING IN A HOLDING FULL OF
PEOPLE YOU CAN STAND IS NOT FUN.
>>I'M SURE A LOT OF THEM ARE
GREAT FRIENDS AND LOVE EACH
OTHER BUT THERE IS ALSO PEOPLE
THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T GET
ALONG WITH AND YOU ARE FORCED TO
BE IN THE SAME BUILDING.
>>LET
ME BE CLEAR, NO ONE IS FORCED.
THE TEACHERS WOULD OPT IN SO
THEY WOULD APPLY FOR THE
APARTMENTS MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER
APARTMENT YOU WOULD WANT TO
LIVE IN.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WORK FOR THE
SCHOOL, YOU HAVE TO LIVE HERE.
I THINK THIS IS GENUINELY
COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE.
I THINK THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
REALLY WANTS TO HELP THESE
TEACHERS WHO JUST CAN'T AFFORD
THE RENT.
LET ME GIVE YOU SPECIFIC DETAILS
ON HOW MUCH IT COSTS JUST TO
LIVE THERE.
SO THEY ARE 
TAKING A LOOK AT
RENT PRICES COMPARED TO SALARY.
THERE IS JUST THIS GIANT GAP
WHEN IT 
COMES TO AFFORDABILITY.
>>WE HAVE REALLY LOST OUR MINDS.
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE FINLAND
MODEL AND I KNOW IT WILL BE
EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT AND RICH
PEOPLE WILL NOT WANT TO MOVE
THEIR KIDS OUT OF PRIVATE SCHOOL
BUT THE FINLAND MODEL IS
EVERYBODY GOES TO PUBLIC SCHOOL
AND TEACHERS ARE SUPER
RESPECTED AND REALLY WELL-PAID.
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSIONS
IN THE COUNTRY.
UNSURPRISINGLY FINLAND RANKS AT
THE TOP OF ALL THE SCORES
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ASIAN
MODEL OF NONSTOP OVERWORK,
COMPETITION.
THEY ACTUALLY EMPHASIZE
COOPERATION AND THEY VALUE
COOPERATION.
WE NEED TO DO THE SAME.
PROGRESSIVES ARE GOING TO START
TO TAKE OVER CITIES IN A BIG
WAY.
FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE HAD TO
DEAL WITH MACHINE DEMOCRATIC
POLITICIANS THAT EVEN THOUGH
GIANT LIBERAL CITIES WOULD HAVE
DEMOCRATS AS MAYORS, IT WOULD
STILL BE THE SAME OLD GUYS IN
CHARGE.
SOON THERE WILL BE PROGRESSIVES
IN CHARGE THAT WON'T BE
CORRUPTED BY CAMPAIGN CASH.
THEY WILL SCREAM AT THE TOP
OF THEIR LUNGS.
BUT THEY WILL SAY WE ARE ENDING
THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS, BILL
GATES YOUR KIDS HAVE TO GO TO
THE SAME SCHOOLS AS MY KIDS.
THOSE TEACHER SALARIES WILL
IMPROVE SO STEADILY IT WILL
SHOCK PEOPLE.
>>YOU ALSO IMPROVE THE LIFE
OF YOUR CHILD.
THERE IS NOTHING MORE
DEVASTATING THAN BEING AN
EDUCATED PERSON HE WANTS TO DO
GOOD THINGS IN THE WORLD AND
YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO
DON'T HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES
AND DON'T HAVE AN EDUCATION.
IT IS GOING TO IMPROVE
EVERYONE'S LIVES AND YOU NEED TO
THINK ABOUT IT AS A COLLECTIVIST
THING INSTEAD OF AN
INDIVIDUALISTIC THING.
>>I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, RICH
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO GET
LET THEIR KIDS GO TO
ABOUT SCHOOL.
WATCH, THEY WILL NOT LET THEIR
KIDS GO TO BAD SCHOOLS.
AND OUR
PUBLIC SCHOOLS WILL BE GREAT
BECAUSE OF THAT.
