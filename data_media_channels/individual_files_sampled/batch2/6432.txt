so I want to be crystal clear that Donald Trump is a liar now you've heard me say this many times because it is obvious anyone going around protecting the damper is closed honey I got bad news for you ain't got no gloves on he's gonna say show me the bottle okay and they did he shows us the buttock and everything else because he doesn't have clothes on he's an unbelievable liar now it's okay it's okay I want to prove it to you I want you to send this video to your Magro friends if you have mango friends by the way god help you all right anyway that's all right you got family members that happens all the time brothers sisters aunts uncles if your dad got brainwashed by a fox send this video to them because I'm curious what they think yes all that quit being loud now that I can't stand up I don't worry about that look at the videos and make your own judgment call are you human do you have cognitive abilities do you still believe in logic and reason watch the videos of Trump you don't worry about anything I'm saying and then you tell me whether this guy's a liar or not so it's not Lea sure Michael Cohen he wouldn't talk to any your heart of FoxNews and claimed who Michael Cohen would meet I barely even know we'll get to that later in the show in this case he says okay fine all right I made the payments to stormy Daniels so here watch for yourself did you know about the payments later on I knew later on but you have to understand anything what he did and they weren't taken out of campaign finance that's a big thing that's a much bigger thing did they come out of the campaign they didn't come out of the campaign they came from me and I tweeted about it you know I put I don't know if you know but I tweeted he tweeted he tweeted about it he says they came from me the payments to stormy Daniels came from me this is Donald Trump earlier on Air Force One when he was confronted months ago and he thought he could still cover it up watch no I did know by the payments no I don't know where he got the money and he just said on fox news it was me it was me so obviously he knew all along I don't know how you're gonna deny it I in fact I'm curious leave a comment below how on God's green earth do you look at those two videos and not realize that he was obviously lying he was of and if you say hey look I know and he's a lie he lies all the time he lied about this because it's embarrassing he slept with a porn star and he wanted to cover it up and then he broke campaign finance laws what are you gonna do I'd like to if I had already broken two other laws okay fair just don't say he's not a liar but of course Sarah how could be Sandra is another professional liar has to step in and say this to the American people because so many people now look back at that tape of him on Air Force One saying he knew nothing about these payments when in fact we now know he knew everything about this payment so has he lied look again I think that's an ridiculous accusation the president in this matter has done nothing wrong a ridiculous accusation look at the two tapes hey listen you know what in case it's hard for you to see the two tips you don't have the ability to rewind whatever it is we're gonna put them all together for you guys including the tape to Michael Cohen release of michael cohen and donald trump talking about the payments before the campaign watch they weren't taken out of campaign finance that's a big thing that's a much bigger thing did they come out of the campaign they didn't come out of the campaign they came from me and I waited about it you know I put I don't know if you know but I tweeted I've actually come up a coffee and I've spoken to Alan weiselberger about how to set the whole thing up with funding that minute yes end of this so if you still don't think he's a liar okay you purposely want to be ignorant that's okay that's your call to make brother okay but it is evident to anyone who cares about the truth that Donald Trump lied at a bare minimum about the stormy Daniels story admit it and let's move on now the reality is his lied thousands of times over and over again and he gets caught and he lies within the same sentence within the same interview it's so obvious my last question to the magnetizes what is it like I get if you support his policies I don't agree with you but I understand that that's not complicated but why do you keep defending him on things that are indefensible if I was you like for example in fact I was you look I was a Republican and and and I switched later on but even so when Bill Clinton was being impeached I thought it was wrong impeach him because I'm like look you got a keg and got oral sex from someone who was you know doing it in a consensual way etc Mike did he lie about it of course of course he lied about it but I don't think you should impeach him over it but at least I said the obvious thing of course he lied about it can't you at least say that at a bare bare minimum and then say okay that maybe you raise your head each time you know what it's no big deal or I like liars whatever it floats your boat but you can under no circumstances say that he's not a liar because he most obviously is too easy wastefully Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you
