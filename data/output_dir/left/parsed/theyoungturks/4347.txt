HEALTHCARE IS IN THE DUMPER.
WHAT'S NEXT?
TAX REFORM IT SEEMS.
THERE
IS A PUSH NOW THAT HEALTHCARE
IS OUT-OF-THE-WAY TO FOCUS ON
ONE OF THE MAIN PROMISES OF
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WHICH
IS A TAX REFORM INITIATIVE.
THERE IS A NEW EVENT, IN CASE
YOU WANT TO PUT ON YOUR
CALENDARS FOR MONDAY.
IT IS
HOSTED BY THE KOCH BROTHERS
AND THEIR AFFILIATE
ORGANIZATIONS.
WHO'S THERE?
TREASURY SECRETARY
STEVEN MNUCHIN ACCORDING TO
GRAPHIC
16, STEVEN MNUCHIN AND
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MARC SHORT
ARE SLATED TO SPEAK ON A PANEL
AT THE NEWSEUM EVENT,
ALONG WITH FREEDOM PARTNERS
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EXECUTIVE
VICE PRESIDENT JAMES DAVIS
AND AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY
PRESIDENT TIM PHILLIPS.
FREEDOM PARTNERS AND AFP ARE
BOTH BACKED BY WEALTHY GOP
DONORS THE KOCH BROTHERS.
WHAT ARE THEY GOING AFTER?
THE KOCH NETWORK HAS COMMITTED
TO SPEND MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS ON ITS EFFORTS TO
CHAMPION TAX REFORM THAT
FOLLOWS FIVE PRINCIPLES:
SIMPLICITY, EFFICIENCY,
EQUITABILITY, PREDICTABILITY,
AND NO NEW BURDENS ON TAXPAYERS.
HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.
THIS IS THE MAIN THING THAT
REPUBLICAN DONORS WANTED.
IN FACT, PAUL RYAN ADMITS THAT
THE WHOLE HEALTHCARE PLAN
WAS TO GET TAX CUTS FOR THE
RICH.
WE TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY.
TRUMP
LIKES TO PRETEND
THESE ARE HONORABLE GENTLEMEN
WITH IDEAS ON HOW TO
IMPROVE HEALTHCARE.
NO, PAUL RYAN EXPLAINED THAT
DOING SO, GETTING RID OF
OBAMACARE WOULD REMOVE THE LAW'S
RELATED TAXES AND ALLOW THE
GOP TO LOWER TAX RATES EVEN MORE
DRAMATICALLY.
THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE TRYING TO
GET RID OF OBAMACARE.
THEY FAILED THERE.
NOW THEY'RE MOVING ON AND GOING
COME
ON, SCREW IT, WE'LL JUST GET THE
TAX CUTS BY THEMSELVES.
WE WERE HOPING TO DO
HEALTHCARE AND THEN THE GIANT
TAX CUTS, I GUESS WE WILL JUST
HAVE TO DO THE GIANT TAX CUTS.
PAUL RYAN HAD PROPOSED TO LEVEL
THE FIELD A LITTLE BIT MORE BY
DOING AN IMPORT TAX BASICALLY,
AND HE WAS SAYING, WE'RE GOING
TO CREATE A GIANT DEFICIT WHEN
WE CLAIM WE CARE ABOUT DEFICITS.
LET'S MAKE THAT GIANT DEFICIT
JUST A TINY BIT SMALLER BY
ALWAYS BRINGING IN SOME REVENUE
FROM AN IMPORT TAX AND THE
KOCH BROTHERS SAID NO.
WE IMPORT THINGS, I DON'T WANT
TO PAY THAT TAX.
WHAT
PART OF MY LEGALIZED BRIBE DID
YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?
AND IT IS GONE.
NOW THERE IS NO CHECK, THERE IS
NO BALANCE, NO EXTRA REVENUE.
THIS IS A MULTI- TRILLION DOLLAR
GIVEAWAY TO THE RICH AND
THE CORPORATIONS.
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA.
I WANT TO LAY IT OUT FOR YOU
GUYS.
THIS IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE
DEFINITELY PASS UNDER TRUMP, SO
TRUMP CAN FAIL AT EVERYTHING
UNDER THE MOON AND THE SKY, AND
HEALTHCARE THEY COULD'VE WON
ON, BUT THEY BUNGLED IT BECAUSE
THE RICH REALLY WANTED THAT TAX
CUT WITH THE REPEALING OF
OBAMACARE, BUT HE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEAL.
HE IS SO STUPID.
ANYWAY, FOR THE TAX CUTS THOUGH,
THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION HERE.
I TOLD YOU BEFORE THE SHOW, I
HAVE RECORDS FROM THE
DONORS WHO HAVE COME OUT FROM
BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND
SAID, I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR.
THIS IS DO OR DIE.
YOU EITHER PASS THIS OR THEY
SAID, LITERALLY THERE WAS A
QUOTE SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO
TURN OFF THE PIGGY BANK.
REPUBLICANS, YOU MUST PASS THIS,
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS
WITH THEIR VOTERS.
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO GET A
DIME FROM US AGAIN.
THE WHOLE POINT OF OUR LEGALIZED
BRIBES FOR YOU GUYS WAS TO
GET THIS IN RETURN.
AND THEY WILL.
NOT ONLY WILL THEY, I WILL
GO FURTHER WITH MY PREDICTION.
THEY WILL GET SOME DEMOCRATIC
VOTES TOO.
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT ISN'T
NEARLY AS SENSATIONAL AS
HEALTHCARE.
IT DOESN'T AFFECT
PEOPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE LIKE
HEALTHCARE DOES, AND I HOPE WE
WILL SEE THE SAME AMOUNT OF
AMAZING RESISTANCE WITH THIS.
AS
MUCH AS WE
TALKED ABOUT MCCAIN, IT REALLY
IS OWED TO THE MOVEMENTS OF
THE PEOPLE WHO SAT IN, AND ALL
THE ORGANIZATIONS I KNOW
TYT COVERED AND TALKED
ABOUT, BUT THIS IS ONE THAT
IS HARDER TO RALLY AROUND.
ARE
YOU GOING TO CALL YOUR
SENATORS AND CONGRESSPEOPLE
ABOUT THIS?
WE SHOULD, BECAUSE THIS IS GOING
TO HIT US JUST AS HARD.
IT REQUIRES EASILY Ã±
HEALTHCARE, RIDICULOUSLY
COMPLICATED, BUT WAS ABLE
TO GET BOILED DOWN TO A FEW KEY
TERMS THAT EVERYONE COULD
IDENTIFY VERY EASILY, LIKE, 15
MILLION LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE.
30 MILLION LOSE HEALTH
INSURANCE.
PREMIUMS CHANGE THIS MUCH.
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.
THOSE ARE THE MARKERS THAT NEED
TO BE LAID OUT IMMEDIATELY
TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS OFF-LIMITS
THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY
IDENTIFY WITH AND IT IS GOING TO
BE TOO BECAUSE ALL OF THIS
IS GOING TO BE PUT IN TERMS OF
THIS SAVES MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS FROM BUSINESSES.
I CAN
HIRE PEOPLE.
THEY WILL SAY
EVEN THOUGH, HE TALKED ABOUT
THIS IN THE SHOW YESTERDAY,
THAT TAX PLAN DOES NOT WORK.
WE HAD A GREAT EXAMPLE OF IT IN
KANSAS.
LOOK AS, BOTTOM
LINE IS, FRANCESCA AND BRETT ARE
EXACTLY RIGHT.
THIS IS A SLOW-MOTION ROBBERY
AND WHAT HAPPENS, YOU MIGHT
NOT SEE IT ON DAY ONE, BUT IT
ESTIMATES THE REST OF THE
BUDGET BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING
LEFT AND THEN REPUBLICANS
WILL TURN AROUND, AND YOU'VE
SEEN IT HAPPEN ON YOUR TV
FOR DECADES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY
MONEY.
OH MY GOD, BERNIE SANDERS WANTS
TO DO FOR COLLEGE FOR YOUR
KIDS YOU CANNOT BE AMERICAN
DREAM?
SORRY, WE RAN OUT OF MONEY FOR
THE MIDDLE CLASS.
SORRY, WE RUN OUT OF MONEY FOR
YOUR HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION,
FOR ANYTHING THAT WAS ACTUALLY
GOING TO HELP YOUR FAMILY.
WHY?
THEY NEVER TELL YOU IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE TRILLION DOLLAR TAX
CUTS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO
PASS, AND THEY WILL.
UNFORTUNATELY, LOOK, YOU BITE
EVERY DAY AND WE WILL WE WILL
SEE THE REALITY OF IT AND WE
WILL PRESSURE YOUR CONGRESSMAN
AND SENATORS DIVIDED IF THEY
VOTE FOR IT, MAKE SURE YOU VOTE
THEM OUT OF OFFICE, BUT ON
THIS ONE, I DON'T KNOW WHEN
TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE AND I
DON'T KNOW IF HE WINS ON ANY
OTHER ISSUE, BUT ON THIS ISSUE,
HE IS VERY LIKELY TO WIN BECAUSE
THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE
DONORS GIVING ALL OF THIS MONEY.
THEY GAVE A COMBINED BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS IN DONATIONS AND
LOBBYIST MONEY BUT THE KID BACK
TRILLIONS IN TAX CUTS.
THEY'RE NOT STUPID, THEY'RE NOT
GIVING AWAY THAT MONEY FOR
THEIR OR YOUR HELP.
THERE GIVING IT FOR THEIR WELL
SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY
AND THIS IS HOW THEY GET THEIR
RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND
THEY WILL GET IT.
