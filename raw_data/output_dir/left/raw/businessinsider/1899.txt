00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,310
it might happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a documentary but</font>

33
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,689
the main thing is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes you on a</font>

34
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,700
journey and emotion who engages you

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,220
what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about making of amy</font>

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,840
is the first feature film that I've made

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,090
where there was never a script or<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

38
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,890
outline for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any kind of document on</font>

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,770
paper the whole film we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just started</font>

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">making a movie I just started</font>

41
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,860
interviewing people talking to them and

42
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was no agenda it was literally</font>

43
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I'm gonna make a film lab or</font>

44
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,380
whatever turns up and I never<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>

45
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,970
pitch to anyone saying this is what the

46
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">film's going to be people came to me</font>

47
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,180
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do it I said give me</font>

48
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,680

leave us<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone will come back with a</font>

50
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,950
movie so the real thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font>

51
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,770
archive is to create a mood and an

52
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,119
atmosphere make you feel like you're

53
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:05,890
there you're with that person you're

54
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,750
hanging out with Amy Winehouse fiction

55
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,220
films I don't think quite achieve it

56
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,290
when you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right story and the</font>

57
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,570
right character and the right archive

58
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,190
when it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doesn't there's nothing</font>

59
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,230
like it is a truthfulness and

60
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,810
immediacy and intimacy that comes out of

61
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,489
archive which I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think anyone's</font>

62
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,110
anything else over point it's the same

63
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,379
mark

64
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,650
yes

65
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,730
I

66
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,319
I felt we've with Amy we're making a

67
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,880
film about her but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a point</font>

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,620
that's a turning point a movie when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

69
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,240
becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about us it becomes about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience it becomes about the way we</font>

71
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,620
treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are obviously having</font>

72
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,020
some sort of public breakdown or who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

73
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,080
mentally unstable and how easy it is for

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,390
us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join in the tabloid exploitation</font>

75
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,340
of these people and to enjoy someone's

76
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,840
downfall because they deserve it they're

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
rich they're famous who cares you know

78
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,010
that was part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the feeling and that I</font>

79
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,840
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get across not only for people</font>

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,850
to feel sad<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to kind of like it but</font>

81
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,320
also that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be a bit of</font>

82
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,870
anger in our in our part<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what</font>

83
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,550
happened the main thing about making

84
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,680
movies for me is to emotionally engage

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,060
of an audience I want people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel</font>

86
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,320
something I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk out</font>

87
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">cinema and to remember they've seen that</font>

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,010
movie the worst thing in the world for

89
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,350
me is when I go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a film and it</font>

90
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,880
may cost 200 million dollars and the

91
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,769
next day I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I did</font>

92
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,120
previous Michaels and I think the idea

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of redressing the image the kind of</font>

94
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,390
general perception of someone that we

95
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,510
all had which must of weather we had

96
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,040
read them or not admit to reading them

97
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,720
or not somehow another the tabloid

98
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,700
persona of amy was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that everyone</font>

99
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,650
thought was the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want people</font>

100
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">who really didn't like a me to go and</font>

101
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,730
see Amy it's not about just appealing to

102
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,290
the hardcore fan it's about speaking to

103
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,239
the people who really think they're not

104
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,940
interested I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to fall in</font>

105
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,440
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Amy Winehouse I want to know</font>

106
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,760
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still thinking about film a</font>

107
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,170
day later two days out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of three days</font>

108
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,150
later and somehow this is lingering in

109
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,400
at mind that stat Steve kind of old to

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:00:00,000
my name with everything but I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>
