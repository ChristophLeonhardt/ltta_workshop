to expect what angle he might yeah and

10

as of thus far<font color="#E5E5E5"> two episodes in I am a</font>

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,920
little disappointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean I don't</font>

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,070
Shane it's not personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything just</font>

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,260
the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah just people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because if you see you become a</font>

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,190
hater<font color="#E5E5E5"> for saying like it's not perfect</font>

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I just want to clarify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think before</font>

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,719
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get hey thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an elf you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me no</font>

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,239
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course I well I love Shane but I just</font>

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,549
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far it's been a little</font>

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long doubt we've had 90 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

22
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,530
the mind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay Paul and that hasn't</font>

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,659
really been well there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been none of</font>

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,560
Jake episode 1 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I was I</font>

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">was because unfairly I know everything</font>

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's happened to Jay Paul all of his</font>

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,369
all of his contradictory moments all of

28
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,710
his highs and the lows<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been aware</font>

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,170
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so view so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a lot</font>

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people that don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything about</font>

31
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so that was that was a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> episode</font>

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of bringing people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into and</font>

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,369
putting it into context wasn't it why

34
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,259
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this series I guess because</font>

35
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,869
even though Jake is huge on YouTube<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

36
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,759
everyone knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shane fans maybe don't</font>

37
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,640
know who he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so that was a good</font>

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,049
sort of setting the scene and the

39
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,880
interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> was interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was episode</font>

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 that I was like what we what's going</font>

41
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,950
on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I understand he's he's met</font>

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a therapist but I don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,540
come for the therapist<font color="#CCCCCC"> but she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,459
didn't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know they were just</font>

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading out of a book what a sociopath</font>

46
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,810
is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the angle is yeah that's</font>

47
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,860
what we realized the

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Episode II kind of mentioned it I wants</font>

49
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to explore sociopaths</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now that is</font>

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,420
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully explored in Episode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two with</font>

51
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,700
a therapist<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is a sociopath what's</font>

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,620
yeah they were describing<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is</font>

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,930
like a lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> in psychology almost so</font>

54
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,970
what's empathy what's narcissism<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

55
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,030
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things which we love learning</font>

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,530
I guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem isn't it's</font>

57
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,900
the balance between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,510
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little long and I</font>

59
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,890
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the two of those</font>

60
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,270
episodes could have been done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one</font>

61
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,690
yeah I want I want Jay Paul I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want him</font>

62
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,580
sat down with Nick Crompton which I'm

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,370
sure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna come so he's already</font>

64
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,680
teased that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hasn't he what do you think</font>

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,590
we were texting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it last night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

66
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">gossiping or anything but no it's quite</font>

67
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,700
what let's put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into context how great</font>

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,110
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even having this</font>

69
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,120
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shane series like if</font>

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,790
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very like vital and important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

71
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">eat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is blowing he's cancer vated the</font>

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube he has absolutely everyone is</font>

73
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,720
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about he's talking about it who</font>

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,060
knows anything about YouTube is hooked

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,730
and into it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> something stuck with me</font>

76
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,470
but you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when we spoke</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

77
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,610
Shane last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that why does he have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

78
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,290
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are perfect because</font>

79
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">this clearly isn't perfect in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font>

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,450
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't say the worst</font>

81
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,760
because that sounds very harsh but it's

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,000
not been<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> satisfying series so</font>

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,980
far and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get what Shane's</font>

84
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do because of my prediction is</font>

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's gonna come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> round and make the</font>

86
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,550
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sociopath or</font>

87
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">a form of sociopath</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a youtuber</font>

88
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where I think it's going but I</font>

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,300
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it feels like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dissertation</font>

90
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I didn't enjoy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my dissertation</font>

91
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I feel like I'm watching one yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

92
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,890
weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> one because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking you</font>

93
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a serious</font>

94
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sociopaths and</font>

95
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,750
disorders<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then but it's also making</font>

96
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,600
it entertaining by including the clips

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,358
of Jake doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy and there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

98
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">over it being like I'm not insinuating</font>

99
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,450
YouTube as a sociopath but then like

100
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,020
dramatic moment and

101
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,199
clip kind of insinuating<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you</font>

102
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,370
are something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

103
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying for context but I</font>

104
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,500
don't know it was it's a weird balance

105
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,550
as well because when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

106
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">mental</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health understandably people are</font>

107
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:40,120
very sensitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I felt a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit uneasy</font>

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,370
with it you know you're showing Jake

109
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,430
Poole next to these fictional murderers

110
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,310
like Norman Bates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's trying</font>

111
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,870
to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> entertaining because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah if</font>

112
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,639
there's a static shot on the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

113
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,680
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these face</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course it's</font>

114
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,060
like what does of his conspiracy videos

115
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,580
that's editing style is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar to</font>

116
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think with mental</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

117
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,520
it's always a weird one trivializing it

118
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,690
isn't and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what it feels like it's</font>

119
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,460
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the moment at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment but</font>

120
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe he has pre researched it and there</font>

121
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:18,810
is something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from this because</font>

122
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,729
if he's if it turns out he's not a

123
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,099
sociopath<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example and it's gonna be</font>

124
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">really stupid I feel like he'd have to</font>

125
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,169
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't just</font>

126
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,599
start a series and be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think he's</font>

127
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,520
a sociopath<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know because</font>

128
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're documentaries that's the risk you</font>

129
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,430
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it you look at the Louie</font>

130
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">furry one on Scientology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the movie he</font>

131
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,630
did he didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really get anywhere</font>

132
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they didn't play ball with him</font>

133
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,599

139
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,960

that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> your youtuber isn't it you</font>

160
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jake but it's still got like 20 million</font>

161

<font color="#E5E5E5">views on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to videos yeah but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

162
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,850
always Shane doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing see</font>

163
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,430
I'd love to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wider viewpoint on</font>

164
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,690
it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and me</font>

165
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about it we might be the odd</font>

166
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,580
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone else loves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

167
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,200
everyone online<font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna be like shut</font>

168
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fuck up you Bell end we knew this</font>

169
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,500
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be polarizing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font>

170
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,160
the reason at the moment we're slightly

171
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,750
disappointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it's not polarizing</font>

172
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,460
because it's shocking is polarizing

173
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,560
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to get going yeah</font>

174
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true eager for it faster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

175
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,820
Shane's clever because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's keeping us</font>

176
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,500
eager for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do you think Jake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul's a</font>

177
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,490
sociopath<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't like the idea that</font>

178
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,760
we're suggesting this because it

179
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,389
trivializes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is such a complex thing</font>

180
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,460
that you can't just diagnose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

181
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,169
I'm not a therapist or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

182
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I could be talking completely</font>

183
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">rubbish but to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems like a</font>

184
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">bigger fight are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a narcissist like</font>

185
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,840
you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

186
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">think other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people should speculate</font>

187
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,919
about it what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I mean</font>

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,320
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it is a great answer</font>

189
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">one thing I had forgotten though is how</font>

190
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,060
much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bellend Jake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poo is just from</font>

192
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what he's building up there isn't</font>

193
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">it building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up or not some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

194
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were displayed I was like I forgot</font>

195
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,160
he actually did that walking in a room

196
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,289
and suffocating<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who's living in</font>

197
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">your house with blankets and ringing</font>

199
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,370
forgot some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things and shocking</font>

200
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,560
no it is shocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the trampoline in</font>

201
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of the road yeah especially</font>

202
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">when he has such a young audience</font>

203
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">predominantly that is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> influence he</font>

204
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,830
has on that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why Disney dropped</font>

205
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,559
him is because he's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube poster</font>

206

<font color="#E5E5E5">episode</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I sometimes forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

243
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,920
brothers and when they were there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

244
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,240
Shane<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

245
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,130
competitiveness you mentioned it as well

246
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">being a brother you do have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

247
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">shit especially in a similar age you</font>

248
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,240
have that close competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> and those</font>

249
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,970
guys clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> both athletes both been and</font>

250
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,070
so they have that competitiveness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

251
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,290
their motive well they Logan was anyway

252
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">before he like kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of scaled down what</font>

253
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,190
he was doing but they're motivated by

254
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,320
each other's<font color="#CCCCCC"> success as well it's like</font>

255
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,910
one does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm gonna do that</font>

256
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,800
yeah and I'm gonna do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

257
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,060
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger exactly it's a shame</font>

258
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,910
because if they if Shane had lost the

259
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,430
sociopath<font color="#E5E5E5"> angle but said I want to look</font>

260
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,470
at the whole YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel like</font>

261
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,970
everyone would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more on board but once</font>

262
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,920
you bring a mental disorder<font color="#CCCCCC"> into things</font>

263
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it kind of muddies the water of it and</font>

264
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,089
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really upset and</font>

265
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,940
understandably so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>
