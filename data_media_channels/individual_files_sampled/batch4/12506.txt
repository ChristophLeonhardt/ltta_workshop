so we watched the State of the Union last night obviously and there's just no question that Donald Trump has got a genius for politics not saying he is a genius but he has got a genius to politics for for politics they proof if we needed any proof I mean he beat all those great Republican candidates he then beat Hillary Clinton you can say well she was a terrible candidate but he chose his moment he chose his spot when he was gonna run for president and he picked the time when she was running and he went after her last night and the other thing that I keep saying about Trump is that he learned stuff you know he he really does he acquires he comes into a place he comes into a situation and he learns how to do it and he's gotten better at doing what he does yesterday the state of the union was like it was like a mousetrap it was a brilliantly constructed piece of work obviously by Stephen Miller and his other speech writers but also obviously by Trump because he knew what the Democrats were gonna do he's not fool he's we've been watching him he knew how they were going to react and so he was able to give a speech about unity while constructing the speech to warranty that Democrats would make themselves look like absolute crap I mean they looked awful you know there was an article in The Daily Caller by a lady named amber FA she wrote a piece five things the Democrats refused to clap for let me list them the national anthem I think Trump told his story about a little boy who went around putting flags on the graves of dead soldiers and he and Trump said that's why we should stand for the national anthem the Dems sat on their hands like good good thinking Democrats great look for you sitting at her hands for the national anthem the second God he's trump save our motto is in god we trust' democrats nothing better than the democratic national convention when they booed god that was bad but this it's just it's just embarrassing tax cuts they don't like tax cuts we've heard from Nancy Pelosi and her dentures on rumors falling out as she was grumbling and muttering to herself she doesn't like people having their own money and my personal favorite was when Trump said it talked about record black unemployment and the black Congressional Black Caucus sat on their hands because they don't like Trump it's like you know never mind if we have the dignity of a job we don't like you mr. Trump I mean that's that's basically where they're coming from and people see it people see it and they get it and I'll and veterans was another one he talked about giving veterans choice in their health care system Democrats sitting on their hands again I mean it was it was perfectly he maneuvered them into position and and I believe that there was a method to his madness there was a reason he was doing it I have to add to the list in the Daily Caller my favorite moment one of my favorite moments was when we get arez the snarling bitter anti-american Pro open borders congressman heard them chanting USA and rushed out of the room just a quick picture of them one we run like USA is coming after you run away you know every now and then with all the drama and hysteria of the press and all the drama of politics it's good to pause and remember for a moment just how well things are going for conservatives and for America and for the conservative vision of America which is the founders vision of America it's good to remember just how entertaining Trump is and the most important thing of all it's good to remember how much fun I personally am having during this presidency because isn't that what we're all here for to make me have fun absolutely trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right its mailbag day we got some great questions in the mailbag and I won't answer them all and the ad will answer as many as I can but the all the answers will be correct because they're guaranteed 100% correct it will change your life some days for the better some days you know you're on your own well I I had a lot of fun last night that show was was really fun I mean it was great to sit around talk to the guys before the show I was thinking I said to Jess are my beloved makeup lady and if I may call you my friend as well and we were sitting and talking on in the chair and I said you know the State of the Union not the most exciting you know moment in the political year I don't know if we're gonna have anything to talk about and she said you kidding me you guys you're like a family you're constantly talking arguing squabbling about everything and that really you were right it was actually that was exactly the way it was I said I always loved talking to the guys I love arguing with him I love hearing their point of view that there's never not in holes but you know what I've been and he brings the cigar so we have to we have to let him in and I just I just really had a good time and then when Dennis showed up Praeger showed up it was kind of like it was almost you know I've always been a little star-struck with the great conservatives I presented at a party in New York once and I saw some famous conservative and I said to a pal of mine wow there's so-and-so and he said you've met Clint Eastwood but he's not you know conservative intellectual Dennis Dennis Prager yeah so it was really really fun I had a great time and I hope we do more of that because it's just I just like to talk to the guys it's really fun you know tripping calm is a great service and I know it's a great service because they took out ads on my podcast another Kingdom and so I got to very familiar with what they do I I love to travel I travel around sometimes I'll stay at a hotel but I have learned over the years especially when you're

you're traveling with more than a couple you know you feel like people are on top of each other you can rent a place that will get you into the atmosphere of the of the place you're in so if you go to

Clavin it's que VA enzo it's trippin comm slash Clavin trippin comm slash Clavin let him know we sent you that helps our show and it will also help you find a good place to go on vacation so one of the reasons I approve of the State of the Union because Ben and Jeremy the god-king of The Daily wire was saying on the show that they don't like it it's too monarchical and I understand and back in the day maybe when we begin to George Washington would just send a letter to Congress that made sense but I think today there was too huge a structure of media between us and the president and the State of the Union is a time when he gets to come out and put best foot forward and the people can see him directly and you know who knows that Donald Trump Donald Trump knows that he is going to be you know you forget because we are so involved in politics we're so wrapped up in it we forget most people look at the headlines they glances CNN when they're in the airport or something like that they glance at the paper maybe they'll look at the op-ed if they're really dedicated very quickly and the you know if you think that people know about this FISA memo they don't know about it times new york times you could comb through that paper forever i'm sure it's in there somewhere but you really could not find it they don't know when when all the networks are telling them the donald trump fired Andrew McCabe they don't know he didn't do it they don't know that he was probably as much taken by surprise he didn't like the guy he was tweeting against them but he didn't fire him and you know they and they don't know and this is the time when Donald Trump can stand up there and speak for himself and as I said in the opening this speech was not just a speech it was a political weapon because the Democrats are so mired in resistance they end up hating everything that's good in life all Donald Trump has to do is say black they say white he says white they say black he says America they say no and he's got him they are trapped so he just made them look terrible and if you don't think so let just listen let's compare for a minute Donald Trump's that whole attitude of Trump speech which was this optimistic we're doing great I mean he had it look everybody every president brags in the State of the Union Trump is a braggart to begin with he's had a great year on top of that so when he was bragging it had a lot of resonance so just listen to the optimism that he was putting forward this is a cut number one this in fact is our new American moment there has never been a better time to start living the American dream so to every citizen watching at home tonight no matter where you've been or where you've come from this is your time if you work hard if you believe in yourself if you believe in America then you can dream anything you can be anything and together we can achieve absolutely anything okay so that's Trump we can do anything we can be anything we can achieve anything we're having a great American moment here's the Democrats response and this is their vision of the future a right white privilege male named Kennedy from a family of sexual abusers listen listen to the tone of his speech this is cop number seven we see an economy that makes stocks or investor portfolios bulge and corporate profits climb but fails to give workers their fair share of the reward a government that struggles to keep itself open Russia need deep and art democracy an all-out war on environmental protection a Justice Department rolling back civil rights by the day hatred and supremacy proudly marching in our streets bullets tearing through our classrooms concerts and congregations targeting our safest sacred places and this nagging sinking feeling no matter your political beliefs that this is not right this is not who we are and he's standing in front of Teddy's car you can stroke it they finally got the body out of there but experience of America here's the thing they keep saying oh well you know Trump's economy is no better than Obama's economy in New York Times was saying this this morning drops you know wages are not right listen you can jigger the numbers any way you want but you can't jigger the dinner table you can't jigger the dignity that comes with a job you can't trigger this the payments on your house people know that things are going better now than they were going during Obama's economy if you remember I remember when Trump was running for president and they said oh the unemployment is it whatever was 7% and he looked out and he said if unemployment were we're at 7% this room would not be filled I mean this is not the experience that people are having and they're not having that depressing experience that that guy was talking about so all right what's the point of all this Trump says jobs for blacks blacks sit on their hands Trump says there's a little boy who puts flags on heroes graves nothing he says he says veterans god here's mika brzezinski 'he's reaction to the fact that defending the democrats not applauding for the things that we hold most dear your sheen is why can't people give him credit for what has happened why can't they give him credit for a speech that went that people had a chance to see if you're a Democrat there was something there for you if you're a Republican there's something there for you that it had specifics because it literally screwed everybody in that room over a few times too many he's been vulgar he's not racist but she has accused one of the senators in that room of even giving sexual favors for money he's insulted the wife of a Republican Center in that room in the worst way possible what about the ship use your job your don't use you Frank is you read rooms you tell me it's supposed to respond like this to the Great Dictator yeah I don't that's not what I saw I didn't see any Great Dictator I mean this you can tell us that he's an authoritarian how is he an authoritarian what has he done name one thing the Trump is done that has made the executive branch stronger he keeps making it weaker he keeps handing over things to Congress he keeps dialing back the government so there's no great dictator they you applauded for the flag you applauded when things are going well when people get tax cuts when people get jobs you applaud and if you don't applaud so what was the point the point is immigration he's now got this deal and he gives them he off puts the deal on the table in front of the camera he says I am going to give 1.8 million illegals a path for citizenship this drives his base nuts his base doesn't want this and Coulter is yelling you know they this is a terrible terrible thing okay but everybody else who's not on that that far side on immigration everybody else is thinking wow that's a pretty good offer and Trump then says yeah three more things I want border security because this is what they keep doing they keep giving amnesty to people saying yeah down the line we'll do down the line and we'll do border security but they never do it so he says yeah for this I want a wall I want no catch-and-release I want to end the visa lottery program that's number three you know you can't give out random green cards for diversity purposes and I want to end chain migration where you can bring in your family because that's absurd once one guy comes in everybody comes in they said well he can't all come in that year that's not the point we all know what this is about and so so now people are thinking hey that was actually a compromise he just offered a compromise to people who won't clap for the flag to people who won't clap for god to people who won't clap for veterans and when they turn this down and they will and he knows they will he just goes to the people and says hey you know what what do you want me to do now I offered them almost two million amnesties and my base is screaming at me what am I supposed to do we've all seen now that they're intransigent I mean joy read at MSNBC said it best people it's not sweet she's hit church family police military the national anthem Trump is trying to call on all the tropes of 1950s era nationalism the goal of the speech appears to be to force the normalization of Trump the terms of the bygone era his supporters are nostalgic for so they don't like the church they don't like family they don't like police they don't like military they don't like the national anthem and they don't like an immigration compromise I mean it was it was masterful manipulation speaking of which give your wife flowers on Valentine's Day and don't tell me oh you want to give your husband flowers if you're white give your girlfriend flowers on Valentine's Day they like it I don't know

just the communications branch of the party the networks and all the rest and s CNN the speech got a 75% positive response from actual human beings 75% looked at Donald Trump who everybody's supposed to hate it always ratings are so low they loved the speech 75% here is a montage that we at the Daily wire for your delight put together that is a sampling of press reaction he was selling sweet tasting candy with poison in it his words will float up like smoke from a fire and dissipate in 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours from now we'll see the typical recklessness the looseness the tweet out of left field that will extinguish this moment guy doesn't look happy to me it's him reading off a teleprompter there is there's some things he says that sound like them totally you know and I'll throw in a beautiful and an extra totally but you could tell he's reading it he doesn't own it reveal Donald Trump's deep and almost sort of like the United States was in the 1860s and I think we are as divided that now as we were given what's going ahead in the last couple of days in the streets no mention of Turkey no mention the Philippines this selective principle does it doesn't doesn't wash no mention of Europe no mention of climate change here we have a president in 2018 advertising the coal industry and not the future I mean anybody more than anything it was a speech delivered almost from an alternate reality tonight set things back did not advance the ball forward because while on immigration well the tone was an attempt at bipartisanship the way he sold immigration really offended a lot of that 75% of the people think the speech was great and you feel that way should you hire some people who maybe reflect the people that you're you know talking to the reason they don't do that is because they don't feel that they're reporting the news they feel that they are telling you how to think they are explaining to you from their high perch of wisdom that how what is the right and proper thing to just think and the problem they have now is the Trump is a communicator he is one of them essentially and he knows how to do this stuff you know the stories that he told were amazing I mean some of the stories some of the so I mean Dennis Prager was saying that he actually choked up and of course the one that got everybody was I don't know how to pronounce a G sung-ho who his story if I had if I had written it if I had written it people to say you know dial that back a little bit right he's a North Korean guy he's trying to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for food because he's in North Korea and he passes out the train tracks exhausted from hunger and a train takes his leg off right and he has multiple amputations without any morphine he's he's going through this hell and his brother and sisters are giving him food and they're eating dirt I mean it's an incredible story he's tortured he's tortured by the North Korean authorities because he went to China and they tortured him because they want to know if he had met any Christians and a great line probably from Stephen Miller he trump says he had met Christians and he resolved to be free I mean that is a beautiful beautiful line he traveled thousands of miles I've heard these stories of guys who do this too on his crutches and now he has new legs and he stands up and do we have is this just a picture we have the Rosie as it's just a photo of him holding up his crutches in defiance and victory I mean this is this is the way Democrats talk this is not the way Republicans talk Paul Ryan God love him he is the way Republicans talk with a pointer and a graph and he sits there and explains the facts you know Ben again he says facts don't care about your feelings and he's right but in a democracy feelings are facts because they guide they they motivate people to do things and Trump gets it he's not pointing at things he's saying you want to know what North Korea looks like looks like that guy because guess what nobody nobody ever crawled to get to North Korea from South Korea nobody's ever tried to escape from South Korea to North Korean gone through this stuff and it tells you who Kim jong-un is you know George Soros is telling us the Trump and King John loon are the same nobodies crawling out of America not even not even like Hollywood people you don't see you know they're showing up in Hollywood in their black dresses but they ain't trying to get out of America they're trying to stay because things are going well I mean this is the thing you know what when I lived in England I remember I've told Rob the story but I don't think I've said it on the arrows I was standing on a street corner and it was a beautiful day and you don't get a lot of beautiful days in England I mean it really it rained something like 60 70 percent of the time and it was just gorgeous and I turned to the guy next to me it was just a he was kind of an old-fashioned Englishman with the umbrella and the suit and everything and I said lovely day he said it won't last I said it's the weather it's not supposed to ask the weather doesn't laugh well the same thing is true in politics this is tremendous fun this is Trump at his trump ia's this is conservatism winning this is the economy taking off there's people becoming more free don't forget to have it it doesn't last politics is like the weather things change things will get worse things will get better this is a good day this is a good time don't forget while you're screaming at the Democrats scream at the Democrats because they deserve it but don't forget while you're screaming at the Liberals have a good time remember to enjoy it this is this is really a period of victory for us and it's great and you may say - yes but why do you look so terrific that's because I work out constantly I work out all the time because when you're my age if you don't work out it's like the last scene in a Dracula movie you just crumble

always try to catch them off-guard see how long it takes them to get Lyndsey scream in it all right from Matt hi Andrew at what point do Democrats go too far and hurt their chances for winning midterms really good question the Democrats have bet the farm basically they bet everything on personal hatred for Donald Trump and Trump it's possible is his worst enemy there he's got a gruff style he can be bullying he can tweet things that are sometimes not so helpful by the way I like his tweeting I think his tweeting you know the New York Times says something like 0.5% of the reach of his tweet so he this is a way that he gets stuff out to the people who like him but but he can also be bellini can also go off down the wrong track sometimes so the Democrats are depending on that the thing is as I always say reality gets a vote and if you tell people that they're not going to get taxes or that $1,000 is Nancy Pelosi said it's just crumbs and if you continue to tell people oh things are just as good as they were under Obama or you know that the New York Times said today Donald Trump didn't do anything to Isis it was he was just continued Obama's policies that's it that is nonsense that is nonsense read any of the books any of the books by the soldiers fighting under Obama and almost all of them will talk about how he hamstrung them with rules of engagement that made it almost impossible for them to do their jobs embalmer himself said that the ISIS was going to be a generational problem it may be a generational problem but not from territory and that was their big sell because Trump and mattis took that territory away so reality has a vote so here's what what I think I think that if Trump can just control himself just a little bit and it's an open question I think and the economy holds good and he continues to put forward things that the Democrats say are awful I think is this tax cut kicks in it's going to really jumpstart this economy it's really gonna help people people's wages are rising it's another thing that I'm said they're not rising any faster than they're worth with Obama you can jigger those numbers and but like I said you cannot Jake the dinner-table people know when they're eating well and track getting a vacation they know when that's going on and it's obviously going on you can smell it everywhere you can see it on people's faces so if they put if this is all they've got there is a chance they could genuinely blow the midterms I you know in ways that we don't even imagine usually the president loses some guys there in the midterms they've been talking about a blue wave right this minute I'm not thinking so you know there's still a lot of time left still a lot of ways to go so the thing is it's not whether they go too far it's whether they only have one trick and when you're sitting for the flag and you're not clapping for God you're not clapping for little boys and you're not clapping for people who escaped from North Korea all you're only trick is the resistance you're only trick is depending on people to hate Trump I don't think that's gonna hold up all that long from Samuel dear king Clavin that I think that's concise you know that contains all the other titles do you believe in individual vocation in the words of benedict xvi we all have a universal call to holiness but does God have any more specific demands of us excluding the more general things like prayer charity faith etc if so what are they and why do you think they are these things as opposed to some other thing I definitely think we have individual vocations but I can't tell you what they are because they're individual I mean obviously the things like charity and and faith and and prayer those are things that all of us should partake in and I think they will connect us to God and to each other but your individual vocation is your individual vocation I thought about this a lot because sometimes I wonder you know I spent so much time working and my work is putting forward what I think is what I hope it is God's vision you know something that will connect people to God and so I think that is my vocation I think God has honed me for this and has created an instrument that is capable of doing this even in the way it took me so long to find God so I know a lot of the dead ends that people go down I think he is actually created me as a weapon yeah you earned it here's the way I think about it okay Jesus said unless you become like a little child you can't enter the kingdom of heaven and did that mean you should become like you know a stupid or heroes not walk or something no it meant you should become the person you were meant to be the person that you were when you born as they say in Zen they say what is your original face before you were born that's what Jesus wants he wants you to refine that person that person is defined by his desires our person's desires are like salience of his personality a salient is a jutting out place it so it shows you the shape of who you are the things you want the things you want tell you who you are now I'm not talking about the things your body wants your body wants food and sex and all the things that you know a body wants I'm talking about the things you want as a person and I think the mistake that people may make is that they let those desires become connected to the things that they desired stead of keeping them connected to God because God gave you those desires to show you where to go to eat there like a guide inside you they will carry you to God and they will carry you to the things God wants you to do it doesn't have to be your job you know with me my work and my life are so intertwined it's hard to tell the difference but it might be family it might be other things that you do it might be charitable work that you do in your spare time it might be a million different things but you know it by following your desires but connecting those desires to God I'll tell you a funny story when I was a kid I think I have told the story before but I was watching with my family my father was in show business he was a radio DJ and I was watching a guy do an ad for toilet paper and he was dressed up as toilet paper you know and and my mother turned to my father and my mother was a little snooty and she said to my father would you do that and he said it's a job you know but I thought to myself that guy probably studied to play Hamlet he probably studied to act he probably went to acting school to act in the great parts and now he's playing toilet paper and the reason is that he has connected his desires to the desire to act rather than what he was acting for what he was acting to bring the kind of truth a kind of portrayal to people that would deepen their lives and enrich their lives and now he's selling toilet paper it's an honest job it's an honest job I'm not running it down I'm just saying that maybe he has gotten his desires have gotten disconnected so you want to follow your desires but you want to follow them in such a way that they aren't that they connect you to the person God who gave you those desires your desires define your vocation they define who you are just don't don't separate them from the source because that's the supply line of truth that takes you where you want to go each person comes with a pathway to God built into him and it is defined somewhat by your desires that tells you where to go so I believe yes you have a vocation there's this a short answer I just should have said that right yes from Joshua dear Dark Lord of the Light clayvin with an e or is it Clavin with an A that's a stupid but are you not listening to me I am an atheist however I recognize that the wilth West is built on the confluence of judeo-christian and ancient Greek thought so I'd like the foundations to be solid a thing in the religious worldview that I fail to understand is why Western religions required God's omnipotence because omnipotence really does seem to me to result in the system falling afoul of the problem evil with omnipotence in the sense that I outlined the answer that the world couldn't be any other way and preserve things like free will or human ability to know the good are unsatisfactory so my question is am i badly misunderstanding the Western release view of God well you're not I don't think you're thinking this through quite clearly if you look pardon me saying so first if God is not unlimited then something controls him and that's paganism and the pagans and the Norse myths have gods who are controlled by fate fate is above the gods and they have - there's some faith they can't avoid we don't believe that does it doesn't really make sense if for God to be God and not just the God of the trees and got a god of lightning and the God of this and that for God to be God he really does have to be omnipotent he has to be outside the world you know outside everything that's cause-and-effect now you go on to say then he falls afoul of the problem of evil with omnipotence he could do anything he wants now CS Lewis points out that talking nonsense and then putting the word God and it doesn't stop it from being nonsense so when people used to say things like can God create a stone too heavy for himself to lift and he go that's just this just language talk you know without meaning and then you put God in it and people say wow that's profound it's not you know God God can in fact make a world of free will but if he makes a world of free will it has to be free he can't make a world of free will that's not free so it doesn't make sense for you to say that he can make a world a free will but people can't do evil in it that just simply does not make any sense once you create freedom you create the possibility of evil once you create the possibility of evil there going to be people who choose that the world is a broken place we know this it is separated from God and so it is in and of itself even nature is torn and broken and not the world that God wanted us to have and wants us to have still so because of our free well because our free will you know people people sort of say that Adam sinned and therefore we all sinned I don't actually believe that's the way it works I believe that once you start on that path of sin we all are born into it basically were born living on land that was stolen from somebody else by bloodshed we're born you know with desires that have been acted out in bad ways and we don't know how to recap you know how to teach our children how to do live right and what did what the rules are and what the rules aren't how can we be free but still have rules but God's omnipotence is hugely important for us to understand who he is but it doesn't mean it means that in order to understand evil you have to understand freedom and how high a value God puts on freedom and I think he puts that high a value on freedom because he puts an even higher value on love and you cannot love without freedom freedom is a basic component of love you know nobody loves at the point of a sword nobody loves because he has to love if God made creatures who loved him by force it wouldn't be love and so he is giving us this wonderful wonderful chance to find our purpose to find our dignity in freedom and by the way by the way when you say you're an atheist but you like Western society and that argument is not gonna hold water you faith the faith is important okay from Patrick hello Andrew there are no ease in Clavin Clavin I've listened with rapt attention to your recent talks on why the old classic movies which relied more on witty and engaging dialogue are much more entertaining than today's fairs which require nothing by way of clever dialogue he I would put forward that ironically speaking it was the production code the Hays Code they call it in in the early 30s which may be largely responsible for the quality of the dialogue and movies until the code died out in the late 50s by making it hard to explicitly Express sexual content movie makers were forced to convey indirectly and non-verbally onscreen sizzle and in doing so their approaches were quite clever being forced to tone it down actually brought out more creative ways to convey more sensuous content making it even more sensuous because it wasn't explicit this is one of the great paradoxes of art all art artists longed to be free all art yearns to be free and when you put restrictions on it it does get better because people get clever once once poetry lost the need for scanning and rhyme and you know and rhythm poetry disappeared I mean nobody reads poetry and literally nobody you know there are ten people who read modern poetry I read old poetry because I loved it but nobody reads the poetry in The New Yorker except the guy who wrote it because they taken away the limits and yet and yet I would not there is something old-fashioned there was when somebody writes a sonnet it doesn't quite work anymore it doesn't quite describe the world as we live in it so yes the Hays office which was a foolish and stupid thing to do made the movies better there's simply no question about it if you brought it back today it would make the movies irrelevant I mean they're already irrelevant but you couldn't depict life as we live it and as we know it to be with the Hays office in place so it's it's just entirely possible that that nobody nobody forced poetry into sonnet form it just was the way it was it's entirely possible that simply the mores of the time would have toned down the sexual content of movies and made them better but it always is true that when you put limits on art art becomes better because people just have to be more clever to do it and yet and yet I don't believe you should put limits on art I believe only the artists should put limits on art it's one of the reasons I always walked it worked in genre fiction because genre fiction you can't escape these the needs of the fiction and it always made a lot more sense to me do I have time for one more not really that's some good questions but have to move on I think gap I'd let's do tickety-boo news all right we're wait we'll just we'll just sit here you know there's the tickety-boo news guy we can't do the tickety-boo news without the tickety-boo news get I want to talk about some I want to say something about women you've probably never heard me say you know I joked last night on the State of the Union show we were talking about movies and Ben was joking about Wonder Woman and I said you know it really got me and this is absolutely true that there were several female journalists feminist journalists who said they wept when they saw Wonder Woman because finally finally a woman had been a strong woman and one world were one and I thought but no that didn't happen that didn't actually didn't happen and and one of the things that so bothers me about the feminist movement is that it takes place here where women are free or where they can do whatever they want where really the women do not have a problem that government can solve anymore do the same way blacks don't have problems that government can solve anymore and and it creates it makes people stupid if they don't turn if they don't use their privilege to help other people or to move forward in their own lives when they're still banding together and complaining and whining about what's going on once they've won the fight and the fight needed to be won they just make fools of themselves my daughter I know I promote my daughter possibly too much but she's become such a fine writer over at PJ Media and she wrote a hilarious piece that I have to read you this the first but feminist Fight Club members beat the crap out of each other because resist or something this is the first paragraph a group of feminists is so angry about something or other that they're beating each other up literally they call themselves femme feral a queer famine force whatever that means and they want to destroy the conservative government and bring down the patriarchy by beating the living daylights out of one another because apparently the best way to protest things you disagree with is to put on really ugly underwear paint your face to look like a three-year-old who did like a three-year-old did your makeup and throw your friends on the floor so they have this female Fight Club I mean that is the sign that is the sign of people who have nothing to protest who have no problems and I just want to read you this from Britain's independent paper at least six women in Iran have been pictured protesting the obligatory Islamic headscarf by publicly taking off their hijabs and waving them on sticks there's one the 31 year old protester who we've all seen the pictures of her taking off her hijab she's known as the girl of Engel Hobbs Street she was later identified as Vita mova head took off her headscarf on a street in the capital Turan and she was detained for several weeks before being released from custody and you can bet being an Iranian prison is not a walk in the park one of the women taking part in the protests was arrested after staging a protest on the same busy street and apparent solidarity Nargis Husseini was arrested within ten minutes of removing her hijab along with two people filming her Iran's foremost human rights lawyer told the Guardian MS Hosseini was pictured wearing a green wrist pan an apparent reference to the Iranian green movement which rose in protest after the 2009 presidential election the thing I wanted to say is that it because because we're here in America where women have it great we have here in America where women have it great that we stuck me we we start to look at women through the lens of feminism as being talking about this useless stuff all the time whining complaining angry when they have nothing to be angry about and it makes it kind of lessens due respect for women as women but you have to remember that that's not women it is just feminists these women what they're doing in Iran is so courageous I do not know if I have the guts to do what they're doing and they are doing it so they can be free because they're not free people and they're trying to have the freedom and dignity that people have all over the world you know that the people have in better places than Iran and and they're so brave and they're so courageous that it reminds you that reminds you of what women really are what women really can be and we pick on American feminists so much because they are whiny complaining people with nothing to complain about except their own life choices they complain about their you know not being able to kill the child inside them as if that child just got there by accident you know they complain about things that are that they are responsible for and here are women showing us reminding us that there are real wonder women in the world there are real wonder women who are not muscular and can't throw a spear you know and don't win world war one but simply by taking off the scarf on their head you know perform an act of heroism that a lot of guys could not perform I mean look they're heroic guys too but this is something we have to remember and it also reminds us of something else when we put ideas ahead of identity there's a lot of there are a lot of friends to be made in the world you know these are women who believe in some of the things we believe which means we can reach out to them even though that they're there in the Muslim world we can reach out to them if they it's not about their identity as having whatever colour skin they have or even whatever religion they have it's but what ideas they're expressing in that religion and what ideas they believe in if they believe in ideas we can somehow get close and we can get close to them anyway it's just you know it's just a reminder of how brave actual women can be because these are not soldiers these are not you know tough girls these are just people with courage doing what it takes to be free and it I just think the feminists in America by not supporting them and by instead talking about some girl who said yes when she meant no and now she regrets that 20 years later when they're talking about that they're talking about crap and like I just think they avoiding this they avoid winning the respect for women as a gender that they could be winning by standing for things that actually matter tomorrow we have Andy weir who is the writer of the wonderful novel the the Martian and I say get to the end of the show I start to lose my memory what do you remember
