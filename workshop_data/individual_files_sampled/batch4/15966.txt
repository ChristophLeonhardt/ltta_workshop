now Shah a woman plagued with anti-semitic controversy has been appointed the shadow equality's minister by Jeremy Corbyn yes that now sure you know exactly who I'm talking about and Jeremy Corbyn has just appointed her to his front bench where is filling loads of voids because he's missing loads of people on his front bench he's appointed her the shadow equalities minister what an insult to millions of people all over this country and a sign of what the Labour Party has really become now I did a video not too long ago about an hour shy about some of our controversies in the past and I outlined the fact that I think she's the most extreme parliamentarian we've we have right now at least amongst the most extreme parliamentarians we have and yet Jeremy Corbyn thought it was suitable to make her the Shadow Minister for women and equality's as he made other announcements to fill is from bench so why is this a problem well given that she's the Shadow Minister for equalities and women and the first scandal is her anti-semitism so let's take a look at the timeline so Charlotte the Labour whip and was banned from working for the party for three months back in 2016 there was an investigation being carried out into comments she made on Facebook about Israel which were anti-semitic she wrote a Facebook post saying that the whole population of Israel should be transported from the Middle East to America and as the drama started around with that she started apologizing etc another Facebook post was found and published online in which she encouraged people to comment on whether or not they think that Israel commits war crimes and of course she was agreeing that they do commit war crimes and then after she stepped down amongst big apology she stepped down as the PPS to John McDonnell another her Facebook post was found another one and this one had a picture comparing Israel to the Nazis with the caption apartheid Israel along with a quote from Martin Luther King that said never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal and later there were reports about a counselor that she hired he had a full parliamentary email address on everything he was full-on hired by nice char it was a Labour councillor called Mohammed shabbir and he claimed that Russian Orthodox Jews were involved in sex trafficking all over the world and specifically he said this he said quote demand is particularly high among shared him the conservative Orthodox Jew many of whom are regular clients of brothels so of course char was made to apologize in the Commons and she did she put on a best poker face and pretended she didn't mean anything she said and she was suspended from the Labour Party but as always they don't want to lose an MP of course why would they want to lose an MP especially a Muslim MP right and when she was let back into the party she showed her true colors again and this is the second thing I wanted to talk about because if she's there for a zani qualities minister and she holds anti-semitic views and that's not one unsuitable for the role but second part of her role is a Minister for women for women for girls right so how is she suitable for that role when when she was let back into the labour party she retweeted a post that said that the girls who were raped by rather and grooming gangs should shut up for the sake of diversity she retweeted that she says it was an accident and it seems to have been largely ignored by the press the only press really that talked about it in any kind of serious way with a moderately right-wing press right the Express and the Daily Mail but everyone else seemed to ignore it and just give her a free pass she said as she showed us that she believes that the victims of grooming gangs the victims of rape girls who were raped should shut up for the sake of diversity and somehow Jeremy Corbyn thinks she fits the criteria to be a minister for equalities and women this is utterly ludicrous it shows the insanity of the Labour Party a Labour Party that was once for the working-class now appears to be for the extremists across almost all boards some of the things that Nash R and her friends have been saying will make the National Front blush some of the stuff they say about the Jews and then she's got the audacity to say that about the girls of rather and because she knows that the press and the politicians will always protect her and not only do they protect her Jeremy Corbyn looks at a woman who was attacked the the victims of rather of grooming gangs the person who's given a free pass a free rein to the people that attacked them because you know diversity is more important he's given a free rein to her and then he promoted her how do you think how does he think that makes these victims feel when they've been pushed side by a politician like this told that their problems are unimportant and then she gets a job with the Labour Party in the front bench in
