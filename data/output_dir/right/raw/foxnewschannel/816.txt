SWAMP.

56
00:01:37,186 --> 00:01:39,155

67
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:56,773
THAT POLITICAL BUYERS DID NOT

68
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:57,774

69
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,509

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,931
WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN THEM

192
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:42,732
ALL.

193
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,934
REMEMBER, HE WAS THE LEAD FBI

194
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:46,369
AGENT IN THE HILLARY CLINTON

195
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:46,802
INVESTIGATION.

196
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,738
HE IS THE ONE WHO VOWED TO STOP

197
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:50,806
A TRUMP PRESIDENCY IN A TEXT

198
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:51,974
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, LISA PAGE.

199
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:55,111
ACCORDING TO THE IG REPORT, PAGE

200
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:56,979
WAS A HIGH-RANKING FBI ATTORNEY

201
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,515
WHO WAS USED BY ANDREW MCCABE.

202
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:00,783
YEAH, THAT ANDREW MCCABE.

203
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:03,553
OF COURSE THEY BYPASS THE FBI'S

204
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,088
CHAIN OF COMMAND AND HE GOT TO

205
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:09,091
MANAGER THE CLINTON

206
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:11,661
INVESTIGATION.

207
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,295
NEXT WE KNEW PETER STRZOK,

208
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:18,568
ANDREW WEISSMANN, THOSE NAMES

209
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:19,035
SOUND FAMILIAR?

210
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:21,771
THOSE ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRATIC

211
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,272
DONORS HAD THE SAME PEOPLE TO

212
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,206
FINISH THE EXONERATION OF

213
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:27,276
HILLARY AND PUT THE FIX IN AND

214
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:30,012
TAPPED BY ROBERT MUELLER FOR HIS

215
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,113
TRUMP-RUSSIA WITCH HUNT.

216
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:33,549
MANY OF THOSE SAME AGENTS THAT

217
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:34,951
CLEARED HILLARY, THEY WERE THEN

218
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:35,585
IMMEDIATELY APPOINTED TO

219
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:38,321
INVESTIGATE TRUMP.

220
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:40,423
THE VERY AGENTS HATRED ABOUT

221
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:43,292
TRUMP, VOWING TO STOP

222
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:45,795
HIS PRESIDENCY, MOCKING TRUMP

223
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:46,462
SUPPORTERS, THE SAME PEOPLE

224
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:50,800
TAPPED TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP.

225
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,567
QUESTION BY THE

226
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:52,268
INSPECTOR GENERAL, WHICH MEANS

227
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:53,936
THE ENTIRE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

228
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:57,406
FROM THE GET-GO WAS AS CORRUPT

229
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:59,375
AS THE HILLARY COVER-UP, AND IT

230
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:04,981
WAS THE CASE FROM DAY ONE.

231
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:05,781
THAT'S THE VERY DEFINITION

232
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,183
ITSELF RIGHT THERE OF WHAT I'VE

233
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:07,984
BEEN SAYING.

234
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:09,785
A TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM.

235
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,320
NO EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW

236
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,389
OR EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR LAWS

237
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:13,856
OR EQUAL APPLICATION OF OUR LAW

238
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:14,690
LAWS.

239
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,158
IF TRUE JUSTICE HAD PREVAILED,

240
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,126
IF HILLARY CLINTON GOT INDICTED,

241
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:19,996
AS SHE SHOULD HAVE IN THE FALL

242
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:20,997
OF 2016, THE ELECTORAL PROCESS

243
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,598
WOULD'VE BEEN TURNED ON ITS

244
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:22,898
HEAD.

245
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,734
THE DEEP STATES OF CHOICE FOR

246
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,268
PRESIDENT WOULD BE OUT OF THE

247
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:26,569
RACE.

248
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,505
TRUMP WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE

249
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,606
RESIDENT WITHOUT ANY OF THIS

250
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,908
MUELLER GARBAGE THAT HE'S HAD TO

251
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,577
DEAL WITH ALMOST HIS ENTIRE

252
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:34,977
PRESIDENCY.

253
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,979
THAT'S WHY HILLARY CLINTON, SHE

254
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:37,747
GOT THE WHITE GLOVE TREATMENT BY

255
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,982
THESE INVESTIGATORS, OPENLY

256
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:42,184
ROOTING FOR HER TO WIN THE

257
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:42,985
ELECTION.

258
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:43,619
PRESIDENT TRUMP, EVERYONE

259
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:46,222
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, THEY GOT

260
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:47,390
THE SLEDGEHAMMER.

261
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,625
THROWN DOWN BY THE VERY SAME

262
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,194
PEOPLE THAT GAVE HILLARY A PASS.

263
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,129
TONIGHT WE ARE ALSO LEARNING

264
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,298
JAMES COMEY IS UNDER

265
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:57,166
INVESTIGATION FOR MISHANDLING

266
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,601
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

267
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,769
REMEMBER, HE INTENTIONALLY

268
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,003
LEAKED HIS PERSONAL NOTES ABOUT

269
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:02,905
CONVERSATIONS HE HAD WITH THE

270
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:03,272
PRESIDENT.

271
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:03,739
THAT'S ILLEGAL.

272
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:05,107
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

273
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:07,009
IN ORDER TO SET THE BALL ROLLING

274
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,411
FOR THE ANTI-TRUMP SPECIAL

275
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:08,778
COUNSEL.

276
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:11,614
HIS BUDDY, ROBERT MUELLER, TO

277
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:12,982
BEGIN HIS INVESTIGATION OR

278
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:13,816
WITCH HUNT.

279
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:17,620
THE IG ALSO FOUND IS FBI

280
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,788
DIRECTOR COMEY WAS INSUBORDINATE

281
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,456
AND TOTALLY MISHANDLED THE

282
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,991
CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

283
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,225
LEGAL SCHOLAR JONATHAN TURLEY, A

284
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:23,959
DEMOCRAT, IS NOW SAYING THESE

285
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,229
FINDINGS IN THE IG REPORT

286
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:27,997
EXONERATE TRUMP FROM ANY

287
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:29,932
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CHARGES

288
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:32,034
WHICH MEANS THEY SHOULD ALL END

289
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:32,568
AND END NOW.

290
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,736
TAKE A LOOK.

291
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:37,173
>> TO ME, OBSTRUCTION CLAIM

292
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,908
INVOLVING COMEY WAS ALWAYS

293
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:41,376
DIFFICULT BUT AFTER THE IG, IT'S

294
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:41,977
BECOME VIRTUALLY INCOME

295
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:45,181
PRINCIPAL BECAUSE THE IG SAID

296
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,782
THAT COMEY WAS INSUBORDINATE,

297
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:48,784
THAT HE DEVIATED FROM POLICIES.

298
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:49,985
HE VIOLATED FBI POLICIES.

299
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,854
ALL THOSE ARE A GOOD REASON TO

300
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:52,988
FIRE JAMES COMEY.

301
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:54,623
SO THE PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO

302
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:56,659
COME UP FOR THE CRITICS OF

303
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,561
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THAT THIS DOG

304
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,462
JUST WON'T HUNT WHEN YOU'VE GOT

305
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:03,566
BOTH THE IG AND THE DEPUTY

306
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:04,200
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYING HE

307
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,568
DESERVED TO BE FIRED.

308
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:06,569
YOU CAN'T ASSUME EVERYTHING

309
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:07,403
AGAINST HIM.

310
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:08,104
THERE IS ANOTHER INTERESTING

311
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:09,972
ASPECT HERE.

312
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,273
IF MUELLER WAS REALLY GOING

313
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:13,576
AFTER OBSTRUCTION BASED ON COMEY

314
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:14,577
AFTER OBSTRUCTION BASED ON COME

315
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:15,878
COMEY, THEN ROSENSTEIN WOULD

316
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:17,213
HAVE TO RECUSE HIMSELF.

317
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,314
ROSENSTEIN SAID THAT IF MUELLER

318
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:20,449
TOLD HIM HE WAS A WITNESS, HE

319
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:21,784
WOULD REMOVE HIMSELF.

320
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:23,919
HE HASN'T DONE THAT WHICH MAKES

321
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,589
ME THINK ONE OF TWO THINGS.

322
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:27,590
EITHER MUELLER IS IGNORING

323
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,858
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR HE'S

324
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:30,526
NOT SERIOUSLY PURSUING THAT

325
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,995
ANGLE.

326
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:35,264
>> Sean: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

327
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,132
ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI CALLING

328
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,900
FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE

329
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,634
INVESTIGATORS, SOMETHING WE HAVE

330
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,603
BEEN DISCUSSING FOR A LONG TIME.

331
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:41,203
TAKE A LOOK.

332
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:42,505
>> 1 OF 5 INDIVIDUALS OUTLINED

333
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:46,375
IN THE IG REPORT AS POTENTIALLY

334
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,576
FACING DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

335
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:50,379
ARE YOU CALLING FOR SOMETHING

336
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,447
SHARPER THAN THAT?

337
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:52,782
>> YOU ARE DARN RIGHT.

338
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:54,383
DISCIPLINARY ACTION ON THESE

339
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:55,584
MAKING COMMENTS LIKE THAT?

340
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,253
NOT PART OF THE PROBE?

341
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:57,686
HE STARTED IT.

342
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:00,456
HE WAS WITH IT FOR ITS FIRST

343
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:03,793
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

344
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:04,794
MUELLER KEPT HIM ON.

345
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:07,296
HOW MUCH DID HE INFECT THE PROBE

346
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,731
WITH HIS OWN VERY, VERY EXTREME

347
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,098
POSITIONS?

348
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:09,799
I DON'T KNOW.

349
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,700
BUT I SURE WANT TO FIND OUT

350
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,335
BEFORE I GO FORWARD.

351
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:14,036
I MEAN, THIS IS A CASE WHERE

352
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:18,207
IT'S CRYING OUT FOR SOMEONE TO

353
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,409
INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS.

354
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:20,943
>> Sean: ABSOLUTELY.

355
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,678
EVEN DEEP STATES I COULD AFFIANT

356
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:25,915
TURN CNN FAKE NEWS PUNDIT JIM

357
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:26,982
CLAPPER, HE'S READY FOR MUELLER

358
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:28,117
TO WRAP THIS UP.

359
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,351
HE LIKELY KNOWS HE AND BRENDAN

360
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,019
WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPOSED.

361
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,988
TAKE A LOOK.

362
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:36,792
>> I THINK THE OVERARCHING POINT

363
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:37,927
HERE IS THIS WHOLE ISSUE HAS GOT

364
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,062
TO COME TO A RESOLUTION.

365
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:43,799
AT SOME POINT.

366
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,401
SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER AND HIS

367
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:47,770
TEAM I HOPE WILL WRAP UP THE

368
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,805
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER ORN

369
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:49,872
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER ORT

370
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:50,606
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER ORE

371
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,107
WAS COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS.

372
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:53,909
THIS IS A CLOUD THAT'S HANGING

373
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:54,710
OVER THE COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY

374
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,979
HANGING OVER THIS PRESIDENCY.

375
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:59,715
AND I DO HOPE THAT HAPPENS.

376
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:00,349
>> Sean: CHANGE OF HEART?

377
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,650
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE

378
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,919
ON MUELLER IN THE IG REPORT IN

379
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,720
JUST A MOMENT.

380
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,422
FIRST LET'S TURN TO A STORY

381
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,524
THAT'S CAUSING A FIVE-ALARM FIRE

382
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:11,594
IN THE HALLS OF THE MAINSTREAM

383
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:12,394
DESTROY-TRUMP MEDIA SURROUNDING

384
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:13,429
REPORTS THAT THE CHILDREN OF

385
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,397
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING

386
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:16,198
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS

387
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,234
UPON ENTERING THE COUNTRY

388
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:18,801
ILLEGALLY.

389
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:20,836
LOOK, LET'S START AND BE CLEAR.

390
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,806
NOBODY, NOBODY WANTS CHILDREN

391
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,008
WHO ARE SAFELY IN THE CUSTODY OF

392
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,009
THEIR PARENTS SEPARATED.

393
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,277
NOBODY WANTS THAT.

394
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,779
BUT TRUTH MATTERS, AND FACTS

395
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,981
MATTER.

396
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:33,549
EARLIER TODAY, DHS SECRETARY

397
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,250
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN RESPONDED TO

398
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,987
THESE CLAIMS, SHE SET THE RECORD

399
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:38,721
STRAIGHT WITH IMPORTANT

400
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:39,622
INFORMATION THAT THE MEDIA IS

401
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,190
ALL TOO HAPPY AS USUAL TO

402
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,124
IGNORE.

403
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:42,791
TAKE A LOOK.

404
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,660
>> LET'S JUST START WITH A FEW

405
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,628
NUMBERS AND FACTS.

406
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:47,396
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS, WE'VE

407
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:49,298
SEEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ON OUR

408
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:52,134
SOUTHERN BORDER EXCEED 50,000

409
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:53,602
PEOPLE EACH MONTH.

410
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:54,904
MULTIPLES OVER EACH MONTH LAST

411
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:55,204
YEAR.

412
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:57,406
SINCE THIS TIME LAST YEAR,

413
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:01,977
THERE'S BEEN A 325% INCREASE IN

414
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:04,613
UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN AND

415
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,115
A 435% INCREASE IN FAMILY UNITS

416
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,651
ENTERING THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

417
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:13,522
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS, THERE'S

418
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:16,592
BEEN A 1700% INCREASE IN ASYLUM

419
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:16,926
CLAIMS.

420
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,127
RESULTING IN AN ASYLUM BACKLOG

421
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:22,398
IN OUR COUNTRY OF 600,000 CASES.

422
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:23,799
SINCE 2013, THE UNITED STATES

423
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,534
HAS ADMITTED MORE THAN HALF A

424
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:27,202
MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MINERS

425
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:29,738
AND FAMILY UNITS FROM

426
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:30,606
CENTRAL AMERICA, MOST OF WHOM

427
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:31,807
TODAY ARE AT LARGE IN THE

428
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:32,608
UNITED STATES.

429
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,277
AT THE SAME TIME, LARGE CRIMINAL

430
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:39,048
ORGANIZATION SUCH AS MS-13 HAVE

431
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:41,116
VIOLATED OUR BORDERS AND GAINED

432
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:43,185
A DEADLY FOOTHOLD WITHIN THE

433
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:43,619
UNITED STATES.

434
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:46,188
THIS ENTIRE CRISIS, JUST TO BE

435
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,823
CLEAR, IS NOT NEW.

436
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:49,792
IT'S BEEN OCCURRING AND EXPANDED

437
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,794
OVER MANY DECADES.

438
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,429
BUT CURRENTLY IT'S THE EXCLUSIVE

439
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:54,530
PRODUCT OF LOOPHOLES IN OUR

440
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,332
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW THAT

441
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:57,066
PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

442
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:59,702
MINORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS FROM

443
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:00,469
BEING DETAINED AND REMOVED THEIR

444
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:03,572
HOME COUNTRY.

445
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:04,606
>> Sean: SECRETARY NIELSEN

446
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:06,175
WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHY IN SOME

447
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,643
RARE CASES THE CHILDREN OF

448
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:08,811
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE SEPARATED

449
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:09,645
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

450
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:12,014
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID.

451
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:14,516
>> DHS DOES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY

452
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:16,618
TO PROTECT MINORS, AND IN THAT

453
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:17,987
CASE AS WELL WE WILL ONLY SUPPER

454
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:19,822
THE FAMILY IF WE CANNOT

455
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,090
DETERMINE THERE IS A FAMILIAR

456
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,824
RELATIONSHIP, IF THE CHILD MAY

457
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:24,259
BE AT RISK WITH THE PARENT OR

458
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:25,794
LEGAL GUARDIAN, OR IF THE PARENT

459
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:27,162
OR LEGAL GUARDIAN IS REFERRED

460
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,230
FOR PROSECUTION.

461
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,765
>> Sean: NIELSEN ALSO MADE AN

462
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,633
IMPORTANT COMPARISON TO HOW THE

463
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,268
GOVERNMENT TREATS OUR OWN

464
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:33,635
CITIZENS.

465
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:34,203
OH, IMPORTANT.

466
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,404
TAKE A WATCH.

467
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:37,206
>> LET'S BE CLEAR.

468
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,440
IF AN AMERICAN WERE TO COMMIT A

469
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,041
CRIME ANYWHERE IN THE

470
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:39,842
UNITED STATES COME IN THEY WOULD

471
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:41,110
GO TO JAIL AND THEY WOULD BE

472
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,978
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILY.

473
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:45,047
THIS IS NOT A CONTROVERSIAL

474
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,281
IDEA.

475
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,049
>> Sean: FINALLY, SECRETARY

476
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,417
NIELSEN REMINDED EVERYONE IN THE

477
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,419
MEDIA THAT THIS IS NOTHING NEW

478
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:52,287
AND TOOK PLACE IN PREVIOUS

479
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:53,022
ADMINISTRATIONS.

480
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:53,922
YEAH, FACTS MATTER.

481
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:57,126
TAKE A LOOK.

482
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:58,660
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

483
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,496
BUSH AND ADMINISTRATION ALL

484
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:01,530
SEPARATED FAMILIES -- THEY

485
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,134
ABSOLUTELY DID.

486
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:05,901
THEIR RATE WAS LESS THAN OURS

487
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,536
BUT THEY ABSOLUTELY DID DO THIS.

488
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:11,006
THIS IS NOT NEW.

489
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:12,007
>> Reporter: MINORS THERE'S NO

490
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,442
DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

491
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:15,411
>> THEY SEPARATED FAMILIES.

492
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,212
>> Sean: AN IMPORTANT POINT.

493
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,013
REMEMBERING THE PHOTO SHOWING

494
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,615
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN CAGES.

495
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:20,682
SOME OF THE MEDIA FIRST

496
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:21,884
ATTRIBUTE OF THAT PICTURE TO THE

497
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:23,285
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BUT IT

498
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,820
ACTUALLY OCCURRED OF COURSE

499
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,554
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

500
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,856
IN FACT, THE OBAMA IMAGINATION,

501
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:28,824
NOT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THEY

502
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,259
ARE THE ONES THAT STARTED A

503
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,195
POLICY OF ACTUALLY DETAINING

504
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:34,329
MINORS FOR MONTHS.

505
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:36,532
BUT THE MEDIA DIDN'T REPORT,

506
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:36,999
BARELY ONTO.

507
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,668
IN FACT, ONE DEMOCRAT ACTUALLY

508
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:40,702
DID ADMIT THAT OBAMA WAS ABLE TO

509
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:42,938
SOMEHOW KEEP HIS ACTIONS AT THE

510
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:44,206
BORDER VERY QUIET.

511
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:47,609
WONDER WHY.

512
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:49,211
>> UNDER THE OBAMA

513
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,946
ADMINISTRATION, THERE WAS,

514
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:51,613
ACCORDING TO

515
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:52,614
"THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTING,

516
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,016
A SURGING NUMBER OF

517
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,617
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS BEING

518
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:57,319
APPREHENDED AT THE BORDER IN

519
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:57,820
2014.

520
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,089
THERE WERE NEARLY 70,000,

521
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:00,923
ACCORDING TO THE POST REPORTING.

522
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:03,325
>> IN MANY WAYS, I THINK -- I

523
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:04,560
DON'T KNOW WHAT IMAGE YOU ARE

524
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,227
USING.

525
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,328
I RELEASED SOME OF THOSE PHOTOS

526
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,397
BECAUSE IT WAS KEPT VERY QUIET

527
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:09,131
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

528
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:09,798
THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS OF

529
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:12,101
PEOPLE COMING IN.

530
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,702
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS

531
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:14,403
TRYING TO KEEP THIS QUIET.

532
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,438
>> Sean: OF COURSE NO AID

533
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,440
OUTRAGE FOR THE MEDIA OVER OBAMA

534
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,108
BUT WITHDRAWN, IT'S IT'S A

535
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,043
TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY.

536
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,611
THERE IS ANOTHER FACTOR.

537
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,613
THEY WANT A DISTRACTION FROM ALL

538
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:25,747
THE LIES THEY HAVE BEEN PEDDLING

539
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,850
TO YOU FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS.

540
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,418
AS I SAID EARLIER, NO ONE LIKES

541
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:30,552
THE IDEA OF SEPARATING ANY CHILD

542
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:32,421
FROM ANY PARENT.

543
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,756
BUT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN IN THE

544
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:35,791
HANDS OF CONGRESS, AND RIGHT NOW

545
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,861
THE WHOLE ISSUE CAN BE FIXED.

546
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,429
EVERY LAW CAN BE CHANGED, AND IF

547
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,698
THEY DID THEIR JOB, IT WOULD

548
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:43,465
HAPPEN.

549
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:44,800
IT IS THE LAW.

550
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,269
DEMOCRATS OF COURSE PREFER TO

551
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,638
THEY WANT TO WIN IN 2018.

552
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,406
THEY WANT THEIR POWER BACK.

553
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:53,142
THOSE ON THE LEFT ONLY WANT OPEN

554
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:54,610
BORDERS WHICH MEANS THIS ISSUE

555
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,011
PROBABLY IS NOT GOING AWAY.

556
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:59,214
THEY NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE,

557
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:00,816
AGREE TO A SERIOUS IMMIGRATION

558
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,017
REFORM, INCLUDING THE

559
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:02,784
CONSTRUCTION OF THE WALL.

560
00:16:02,784 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ALREADY HAVE THE PRESIDENT
