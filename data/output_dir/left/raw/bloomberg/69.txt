1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,350
Past predictions of artificial intelligence
looked like this, or this.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:11,180
AI is here, and those predictions haven’t
come to pass… at least not yet.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,820
In the last decade, Artificial Intelligence
has found real world applications in everything

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,890
from hedge funds to beer brewing...

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,759
And far from destroying humanity or solving
all of its problems, experts question how

6
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:25,320
much farther AI can go from here.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,070
Artificial intelligence is software that solves
problems-- it looks at a confusing situation,

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,470
ventures a guess about what’s going on and
learns from what happens when it acts.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,890
“you could think of it almost like a giant
excel spreadsheet, where you’re running

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,160
statistics to try and find the best guess.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,430
That’s Bloomberg Tech’s Ashlee Vance

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,480
Is this an apple?

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,240
Let’s run these calculations to see if the
computer thinks it’s an apple.”

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,040
The companies that are making the most use
out of AI today are companies like Facebook,

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,560
Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,120
it's pretty basic stuff like recognizing your
face in a photo.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,260
It's translating a menu on your Google phone.

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,450
It's using computer vision in a self-driving
car to see where other cars are and where

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,280
obstacles are.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,420
The first real attempts to create artificial
intelligence were in the 1950s, with the creation

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,950
of neural networks -- software that can process
data with some of the pattern-recognition

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,759
capabilities that takes place in our brains.

23
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:25,759
But It wasn’t until 2006<where did this
date come from?

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,399
Might be better to fudge with what the QT
says: "the last decade" that AI started to

25
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:29,399
takeoff.

26
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:35,119
The internet finally supplied the kind of
data that these neural nets needed for sustenance,

27
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,310
huge volumes of images and text.

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,929
And that's what allowed all these AI algorithms
to take off.

29
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:45,869
Today AI systems can even beat humans at things
like trading stocks, or playing the board

30
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:46,869
game Go.

31
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,020
They’re in driverless cars and can help
identify tumors.

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
But it’s still limited.

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,020
A computer will still have a huge problem
with things that a baby or even an animal

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,020
can understand intuitively, like if a kid
sees a glass get tipped over a couple of times,

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
the child intuitively understand gravity.

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,020
//It would take a really long time to teach
a computer something like that.

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,240
Today’s AI still needs humans to occasionally
tell it, “yes you’re doing the right thing”

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,009
or “no, that doesn’t look right.”

39
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:03,069
the end goal of all of this is to create something
that’s called an AGI, which is an artificial

40
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,929
general intelligence, which would be an AI
that didn’t need a human to hold its hand

41
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,030
to tell it what to do.

42
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,870
There’s a lot of debate about when or *if*
we’ll ever see AGI.

43
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,190
But even the possibility has made skeptics
of people like Elon Musk and Bill Gates, who

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,849
warn that AI might end up automating so many
tasks that millions of humans could end up

45
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:26,780
without jobs; or lead to other, unforeseen
calamities.

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:00:00,000
We’re summoning the demon with AI
