dignity and self improvement and liberty we have to get into all of the terrible lies of communism today marks the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution this might confuse you as today is November 7th the discrepancy of dates is directly caused by Russia's still having been on the old Julian calendar in 1917 but indirectly more profoundly the October revolutions November birthdate exemplifies the central fact of communism it's alive from the very beginning despite representing a tiny minority of political forces at work in the February revolution to oust Russia's Romanov dynasty and constituting only the majority of the most extreme leftist elements among the Russian revolutionaries Vladimir Lenin called his faction Bolshevik which means one of the majority now speaking of lies to commemorate this day the Washington Post ran a 4,700 word piece titled 100 years later Bolshevism is back and we should be worried yeah I'd be worried about that it's pretty scary you might assume that the Washington Post article describes the recent spate of New York Times pieces extolling the virtues of communism here are some headlines what killed the promise of Muslim communist or Christians supposed to be communists no spoil alert no or why women had better sex under socialism you you might presume that the Washington Post discussed the terrifying recent poll that showed that the majority of American Millennials would rather live in a communist socialist or fascist nation than a capitalist nation then hood nation where you have freedom but no that's that it's not what the Washington Post talked about instead in this nearly 5,000 word article they accused Republican President Donald Trump whose administration has overseen massive deregulation enforcement of democratically elected enacted law the appointment of textualist judges faithful to the Constitution a bold and nuanced foreign policy that is thus far avoided the disastrous bellicosity a Barack Obama's regime robust defense of civil rights and religious liberty no no no they accused that President Trump of being a neo Bolshevik the Washington Post ladies and amaq reseed eyes in darkness though what fake news at its finest Vladimir Lenin is said to have called communist sympathizers in America useful idiots the phrase refers to people like New York Times reporter Lincoln Steffens who traveled to the Soviet Union shortly after the Revolution and claimed quote I have seen the future and it works or New York Times reporter Walter durante I'm seeing a trend here New York Times reporter Walter durante who won the Pulitzer Prize for publishing Stalin's propaganda denying the Holodomor that starved the death starve to death seven and a half million people or in Appelbaum the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist who penned today's insipid twaddle in the Washington Post all allegedly expert thought leaders on a subject about which they wrote in such ignorance the Russian Revolution led to the death of at least 94 million people as communism infected nations around the world it enslaved half of the globe yet much of the left in America remains unrepentant in their support of tyranny Brylie new rule Fidel Castro is not worse than vampire Hitler and Cuba is not North Korea crossed with hell if we had opened up relations with Cuba 30 years ago instead of pursuing the stupidest most ineffective policy in American history not named the drug war today Cuba would look like st. Barths and your kid would be there on spring break drinking I'm out of a job jug shaped like a frog people in sine occurs like yours affluent protected people in Western countries where they can speak their minds who defend this guy I've never met anybody who fled from Cuba who would defend him because well the ones who have fled for a number of reasons sometimes for personal reasons they left their wives behind they want to start a new life without me why forget about the old family there you don't hear about that in the media there and nationalism the Castro were abandoning their families because they want to begin a new life there some of them work so it's not there's not this huge system of political oppression that is very popular among among certain sectors there in 1985 you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy this is what you said about Fidel Castro let's listen you know way back in moments of 1961 they invaded Cuba and everybody was totally convinced the Castro was the worst guy in the world all the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro they'd forgot that he educated the kids gave them health care totally transform the society useful idiots like Bernie Sanders at the end I'm sure you could tell because he sounds exactly the same as he did then both in content and in voice but that was Bernie about 30 years ago useful idiots men of character and moral clarity saw this evil for what it was as it began people all the time quote the Iron Curtain line of Winston Churchill's speech the sinews of peace but they often neglect his prescription for how to fight this ideology of lies the blind to the fact that the liberties enjoyed by individual citizens throughout the United States and throughout the British Empire are not valid in our considerable number of countries some of which are very powerful between these states control it enforced upon the common people by various kinds of all-embracing police governments to a degree which is overwhelming and contrary to every principle of democracy the power of the state is exercised without restraint either by dictators or by compact oligarch is operating through a privileged party and a political police but we must never cease to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the english-speaking world that freedom of speech and thought should reign the Courts of Justice independent of the executive unbiased by any party should administer laws we have received the broader sense of large majorities or are consecrated by time and customers that preach what we practice second practice work week week perfectly said perfectly summed up by Winston Churchill we must not only practice what we preach we also have to preach what we practice yet from the American left all too often we hear Liberty for me but not for thee from atop the shoulders of the Giants who built our civilization on ordered liberty and human dignity they preach against the spiritual and philosophical foundation of that society that they enjoy of the life that they live they are thus officers economists and calculators that Edmund Burke warned us about but some men understood Churchill's vision and they saw through the degrading materialism of communist ideologies Winston Churchill said the destiny of man is not measured by material computations when great forces around the move in the world we learn where spirits not animals and he said there's something going on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether we like it or not spells duty you and I have a rendezvous with destiny communism deprives a man of his dignity because it pretends that man an animal that's why we're conservatives see people leftists only see the masses the unwashed masses how often do you hear that phrase the more they love mankind the less they love men in particular GK Chesterton understood that communism relies on a central lie which comes from the father of lies and he explained the strange fruit of this mystical religion of materialism he wrote quote the Marxian talks as if the only object of saving people from sufferings inflicted by the quote blind forces of capitalism was that those people should have material consumption and material security it is not it is that they should have life and that they should have it more abundantly it is not only that a man should be secure of eating the turnip it is that he should have authority over the turnip and liberty with the turnip and the right to choose his own way of cooking the turnip for that sense of dignity makes all the difference to his general view of life and of that heaven which fills the empty spaces and the idle hours on this hundreth anniversary of Lenin's lies let's redouble our efforts to defend the liberty and dignity that make life worth living and to rebuff the useful idiots who propagate those lies at every chance that we possibly can alright enough about communism let's get to the news eyed communism ruined an entire century and it does not need to ruin the rest of my show so we have an excellent panel to bring on we have Candace Owens red pill black in studio we have Ariel Davidson we even have his Eminence Paul Bois the the Cardinal himself but I might have to

leftist tears tumblr it's the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution of the promise of the glories of communism and we have relegated that awful ideology to the ash heap of history and we've relegated they're delicious tears to my tumblr you need this vessel or you might drown go to daily wire.com right now enjoy your leftist here's hot or cold always salty and delicious we'll be right back mmm so good so so delicious so nice and some well I'm almost parched they're so salty oK we've got a great panel to bring on today I think we've talked enough about communism I don't want to talk any more about these they've ruined the whole century let's talk about Chris ELISA so from CNN which you might not know is fake news this is CNN this is fake news Chris ELISA had this headline quote Trump literally just made the good guy with a gun argument he literally not figuratively literally that's real news that's CNN the real journalist crystal izi let's see what Chris is talking about you've talked about wanting to put extreme vetting on people trying to come into the United States but I wonder if you would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun well you know you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question even though we're the heart of South Korea if you did what you're suggesting there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him and I can only say this if he didn't have a gun instead of having 26 dead he would have had hundreds more dead and are you considering any kind of gun control policy and you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation in Chicago and Chicago is a disaster if this man didn't have a gun or a rifle you'd be talking about a much worse situation in the great state of Texas but crystal is a reports Trump literally just made this argument the Sun literally shines the fish literally swim Candace what's wrong with the argument well first off Trump is literally Hitler according to CNN so let's see I don't think that they know anything about history I don't think they're paying attention just because you let's say guns were completely illegal and nobody could ever get their hands on it that does not change the fact that people are going to get their hands on things illegally do they pay attention to the error of prohibition where people not drink there it's just it's a tired argument let's not even talk about how inappropriate is that she is interrupting the president while he is on foreign land in South Korea they were supposed to be talking about trade and she's like let's talk about our personal issues like right now yeah well they they have to pounce on it it is true and Trump I love me at that point I said yeah maybe you shouldn't be talking about this and when I'm in South Korea but no that's fine I'll answer I'll answer it it is a tired argument obviously it was illegal for this shooter to get a gun anyway there is a law against him getting a gun and to be government bureaucracy failed to do its job surprise surprise were country of 300 million guns paul bois solicit EEMs to make arguments about guns that are essentially statistic he says well you know according to these statistics good guys with guns don't usually stop shootings or whatever doesn't the statistical version of this gun argument missed the point of the Second Amendment yes essentially I mean this Second Amendment is basically a philosophical theological argument that human beings have a right to defend themselves and period now of course we can debate the Prudential extent humans have a right to defend themselves but you know obviously shouldn't all citizens be allowed to own a tank or a bazooka we have course that debate obviously I'm sorry thought I didn't rise was that that Oracle question go on yeah so that's you know speaks to that and on another point the reason why they're engaging in these statistical debates regarding this it sort of speaks to what you were talking about how the left only sees the masses in these scenarios and ben shapiro hinted at this in his podcast the other day about how when it comes to these types of tragedies and the left always calling for more gun control we get accused on the right of not having any nuance at all yeah but that's really the pot calling the kettle black i mean this is just this happens and then the left goes chris Solis is clearly doing it here citizens have no right to own firearms period whereas we say yeah so citizens should have firearms obviously this guy should not have firearms he was illegally barred from owning them but the government failed us so well but it's because it's not ideological they're they're looking for an answer because the the leftist view of the world like the communist view of the world is essentially ideological whereas conservatism at least tries to avoid ideology I remember Antonin Scalia was asked a question once well how you know something to the effect of how are you able to apply this complicated constitutional provision how are you able to interpret it and his answer was very carefully if you have to do it very carefully because we're dealing in human things Arielle while the left uniformly mocks and in Vaes against conservatives who have offered their thoughts and prayers for the victims of this evil they can't seem to articulate a policy prescription that would have prevented the crime similarly conservatives and so-called conservatives who continue to obstruct Donald Trump and inve against him can't seem to articulate any alternative for our political goals of expanding liberty is there ever any reason to preen if you're not part of the solution or aren't you just part of the problem well I think it's natural after some an event like this and including the Vegas Massacre as well to say what could we have done to prevent this and I think there are lots of solutions to this problem but I don't think necessarily regulating weapons to the extreme of the left is seeking I also think it's it's like I said it's natural to seek answers the other thing I want to note though is that the reason the left can't come up with a policy prescription is because the laws were already in place particularly for this past eva's incident this past weekend this is a failure of government enforcing its own laws that are already on the books I'm sure that thanks the crash along a shot right so that begs the question if we can't even enforce those laws already on the book our bloated bureaucracy are they gonna be able to handle an increased capacity of regulations when it comes to communicating on a state versus federal level this is what Ronald Reagan predicted he said that what the left always tells us just give us a little bit more power just give us a little bit more money and we'll get it right time no next time we'll get it right and I think the other issue is the reason the left can't come up with articulated their ultimate endgame is compensation I do firmly believe that because when it comes to we want gun control now if you respond by saying well but the according to current regulation and law the shooter should not have had access to guns to begin with their answer will be more laws and then if you get to the real nitty-gritty of what they specifically want is a limitation on the types of firearms sold and then potentially just an end to firearm sales in general uh which obviously will be a disaster but I think that's ultimately why they're not crystallizing for us what their policy endgame is largely because we know deep down it's coming down to confiscation that's it I mean a country of 300 million guns there's one policy that would change any of these shooting statistics and that's mass confiscation and it would probably have a negative effect on many other crime statistics but that's the one you got to take him you got to go over to all those cold dead hands and pry them out alright enough about the guns let's get down to nitty-gritty politics today's election day in at least two places Virginia and New Jersey they're a pretty highly watched races there Ed Gillespie the Republican candidate in Virginia kim Guadagno Republican candidate in New Jersey it looks like Kim is probably going to lose but Ed Gillespie is running neck and neck right now Candice is Gillespie going to win I certainly hope so I mean if he wins it tells us a lot about where the American mindset is that it also shows us a lot watching this race in Virginia that the Democrats haven't pivoted their strategy whatsoever even though they just had the biggest upset in the history of presidential elections and they don't understand that their party is very split there are the moderate Democrats which are so close to being conservative and they are there I haven't met them in a while yeah they're still there they're there hanging on by a thread but they're still there and they're they're so close to jumping ship which is something that I did because everything just seems so illogical on the extreme left side so it's something that we have to pay attention to closely because it lets us know what the demo tapping store and right now from everything I'm seeing it's absolutely nothing well Candace it's about it's about your lyin eyes isn't it they were in that ad against Gillespie that showed a Tea Partiers truck that was mowing down little Arabic children the same week that a a Muslim terrorist mowed down people in New York in the name of Isis and while yelling Allahu Akbar is that we were just talking about the the lies of communism that it's fundamentally founded on a lie and your screen name your name on YouTube is red pill black because you basically realize that so much of what we've been told in our political establishment is a lie it's the it's the lies of the the media and the elites and the experts who it's not that they're ignorant it's just that they're expert and they really know things that aren't true what was it that pushed you over what were the lies that pushed you over and said huh maybe the world isn't quite like I thought it was you know I think and I think this is true for a lot of people last election cycle it was too aggressive like normally they like Ashley you know and they move on to the next story they are like baby i love you i heard that they were so aggressive and angry when it came at trump and it hasn't stopped like i was just on the phone this morning with my aunt and she is a registered democrat and she said i can't even bear to listen to CNN anymore it's just become the trump news network there's so much hating there's so much animosity that you have to essentially realize at some point that we learn about propaganda in our history textbooks we are living under propaganda right now the media is just trying to trick our brains and brainwash us so i think if you had even a modicum of intelligence you realize that something was up and that's something was that these media companies are being run by businesses who have globalist interests mm-hm and and they certainly you know it's funny you call it the trump news network i guess now it isn't it's just focused on trump all day long but i would always hear it as the CNN the clinton news network pro-clinton you know now no it's the same thing I guess now anti-trump arielle the media are going to spin it Gillespie lost tomorrow as the big anti Trump pivot you know they've been waiting for this in every special election that they were supposed to win that Republicans then won they always so then they say oh it doesn't matter it's no big deal you know that's how they're gonna spin if Gillespie loses what how are they gonna spin it if Gillespie wins what's the story gonna be it's gonna be a moral victory but then they want to convince this that they actually want I mean we're talking about the age of participation trophies reigning supreme right so this is just an extension of the participation trophy I mean the left is starting to see their election losses as victories because the only way they can keep morale up is to tell the you know their their electorates that don't worry we're gonna win next time and you know we're on we're on the right side of history yeah that's right they usually present their losses is that we just have the ignorant masses electing the incorrect politicians into office and we have the moral high ground here so when we history writes books about war when there's history books written about us we will be on the right side of history that's really how they're gonna spin it there was a guy there was a guy in Georgia they you would have thought this was the redo of the 2016 election I think they thought it was and he was in Georgia's sixth I think John Assaf and then he lost and all the coverage would have thought that he won it's just like when they tell a lie and then they said like Michael Brown the Michael Brown was executed he was completely innocent he was surrendering to police and then the some racist cop just murdered him in cold blood then it turned out there were three autopsies a grand jury said that isn't what happened and they say well okay that wasn't true but it gets to a greater truth this complete lie that we've based our entire movement on it act like it I know it's a lie don't tell him it's a lie it's a greater truth that we have to talk about your eminence mr. blah Evan McMullen the nominally Republican never Trump presidential candidate who tried to spoil the election and give us president Hillary Clinton he tweeted today Edie Gillespie was one of the good guys but now he peddles fear and white nationalism no evidence of this whatsoever of course it's better for Virginia and America that he not prevail is this evidence that despite protestations of principles guys like McMullen are just lefties squishes Oh Michael I think self-righteous weasel is a better term this type I have very little little respect for evident Mullen it was bad enough when he did his nevertrump crusade during the election which couldn't even keep Trump from winning Utah and that's what Eddie Mullins certainly wanted to do and that failed and he's just upset you know he didn't get to have his way and now he's out there standing on his pedestal alone doing absolutely nothing and just trying to derail Trump's agenda and the Republican Party's agenda on all this a he just looks ridiculous and so he's a squish well maybe not all of the guys who opposed Trump or squishes that I understand there were plenty of reasons not to be thrilled with his nomination among conservatives and Republicans but the reason I think we know that McMullen is just a squish is that he's he'd lost a presidential bid and he's behaving the way the Democrats do when they lose the presidency not the way when Republicans lose the presidency they do it gracefully George Bush Senior Bob Dole John McCain Mitt Romney they all just get over it and move on you know and the Democrats Hillary Clinton al gore they lose their minds and they just start muttering on the sidewalks is it screaming to themselves that they are the real president I think we're seeing that with McMullen at swish okay moving on in her tell-all speaking of electoral strategy and democrats donna brazile is writing about what she considers the idiocy of one of Hillary's campaign strategies in which the Hillary would send Donald Duck costumed protesters to Trump rallies because Trump ducked releasing his tax returns he ducked that do you get it he duck it was a duck Donald Duck do you get it it's really is really funny you know because it's a duck canvas why ultimately do you think that Hillary Clinton couldn't encourage people to pokeymon go to the polls it is just the strategy was so bad and the greatest thing about Donna razón all of these revelations is we've just been screaming it for about a year now and suddenly I don't know maybe she doesn't know about Project Barrett is doesn't know about the wiki leak emails and she thinks that her book is like groundbreaking she's like the Dan she cheated oh really the dude cheated weren't you didn't you help them when you've been to CNN a question it's just it's absolute like she's totally oblivious to herself and at a certain point you have to feel bad like that these strategies were so bad that Hillary Clinton like high-fived herself and was like this is gonna be so good I'm gonna get Donald Duck in a costume and say duck I know what the youths are after I know what that youths really want I know Donna Brazile really is a johnny-come-lately on this because she did cheat on behalf of Hillary Clinton but whatever it is fun to watch it crash and burn I'm a little actually upset with Donna Brazile because right now she Elizabeth Warren Democrats are just completely murdering Hillary Clinton who knows why maybe they're worried that Muller is going to implicate Clinton and Podesta in his investigation who knows but it's too bad because I was waiting for Hillary 2020 Hillary 2020 for Hillary 2020 Hillary now more than ever Hillary Clinton forever bah blah your eminence this reminds me of when n night Shyamalan began to exert complete creative control over his movies and he never made a good movie ever again is this evidence that campaigns need decentralized power Oh quite the contrary Michael I love my job I'm sorry I should have been said Oh quite quite the contrary Michael III I so wish Hillary just got her complete way with all this and and Donald doc was there at the DNC at every single rally of hers I mean it just would have been so beautiful yeah just one more reason to be glad that Hillary is not sitting in the Oval Office right now I mean it just really speaks to how clueless she actually is I mean why would you want to associate Donald Trump with a beloved Disney character like Trump associating Hillary Clinton with Betty Boop it makes no sense the alternative actually was that they would send protesters dressed up his Uncle Sam and Hillary vetoed them this is not a joke Hillary vetoed that because she thought Donald Duck was funnier but their other option was to associate Trump with America itself absolutely incredible you're right maybe we need more centralization for Democrats and democratic pains because just as we saw in the Soviet Union you centralize all that power it is just gonna collapse of its own weight Ariel is this evidence of Ann Coulter's thesis that despite all the sideshows and the reality-tv of this campaign voters ultimately care about the issues not gimmicks I actually believe in push back further on that I read a piece today and for the life of me I cannot remember the name of the author but it was basically saying that triumphs victory was really about electing a cultural president as opposed to necessarily a policy oriented president that's not to say that Trump won't carry out certain policies but when it came to sort of the percolating culture war that was evolving under Obama's eight years I really Trump was sort of a declaration more so in the cultural war now the policy implications of that are very strong but I do see that thesis as being something that's definitely worth arguing well I think I don't disagree with that at all I would lump that in with issues you know that not all issues are about lowering the tax rate these culture war issues have been bubbling up for a long time everything else is just accounting basically but sometimes you see campaigns delve into stupid little sideshows like Donald Duck or you know the pokemons go or my NCAA bracket I don't know I don't think it's about the tweets I think it's about know it is and I actually gotta disagree with someone about this on Twitter because I said you know what even if McCain if McCain is voting against repealing Obama care even if he's doing in a dignified way I'm still going to fundamentally disagree with them I'm going to support the candidate who is even if he is a little rough around the edges is actually supporting and promoting the policies I want if you are the one that's voting against Obama care appeal and then complaining about Trump's tweets I don't want to hear it this is a taste versus content issue I understand that there are people within the GOP that prioritize taste over content I am NOT one of them do I think Trump could clean up his tweets absolutely do I think he's a little rough around the edges yes I do but when it comes to content I think that's the most important driving factor for me as a voter absolutely I couldn't agree more all right that's our shit listen we've gotten so much that is our show too because we're a capitalist show right here so we got to go and make some money I will say my guest and frequent Michael Nolt show panel deplorable z panelist Candace Owens is heading over to the Rubin report there's going to be a Smackdown between another Michael Noel's show friend Blair White so I definitely look out for that that's gonna be a
