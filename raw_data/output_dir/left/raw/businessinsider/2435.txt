1
00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:02,491
Have you ever been to Target

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,757
expecting to buy one or two things,

3
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:06,866
and then walked out hours later

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,534
with much more than you planned?

5
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,015
You're like oh, I didn't
know I needed this,

6
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,814
and then you just pick it off the shelf,

7
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:12,647
put it in your cart.

8
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,703
I just spend so long there,

9
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:16,988
it sucks me into a black hole.

10
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:20,488
Yeah same. It's a pretty
common experience,

11
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:24,019
and it's become known on the
internet as the Target Effect.

12
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,769
But it's more than just a popular meme.

13
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,697
It turns out Target has
a few ways of making sure

14
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:30,713
you'll want to take
everything off the shelves.

15
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:37,392
You've probably noticed
that it's pretty hard

16
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:40,796
to walk into Target,
grab one thing and leave.

17
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,925
The real genius behind that
is in the store's layout.

18
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:45,706
When you walk in, you'll likely see

19
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,738
a Starbucks near the entrance.

20
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:50,387
The coffee shop helps
establish a welcoming vibe,

21
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:52,644
inviting people to come in and hang out.

22
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,763
Once you walk past Starbucks,
the store flows naturally

23
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:57,601
from one section to the next,

24
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,756
so you end up browsing through
pretty much every aisle.

25
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:03,067
Right by the make up,
you'll find hair products.

26
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,324
Next to hair products are the toiletries.

27
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:08,224
Next to those are cleaning
supplies and so on.

28
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,848
Say you're planning on stopping by

29
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:12,325
just to pick up something
from the seasonal section

30
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:13,752
like school supplies in August

31
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:15,925
or Halloween costumes in October.

32
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,264
For those, you'll have to
head to the back of the store.

33
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:21,155
So you'll have to follow the store around

34
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,914
and then you know, before you know it

35
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,605
you've ended up filling
up your entire cart with

36
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,280
other stuff you didn't plan to get.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,234
Visually, Target stands out

38
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,138
from other big-box retailers like Walmart

39
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,888
which can sometimes be
disorganized in comparison.

40
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:36,615
So Target's known for
having good, clear signage.

41
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,451
That's a kind of key way, you know,

42
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:39,411
if shoppers know where they're going.

43
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,876
They don't wanna get
frustrated in the store.

44
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:42,243
They can go straight there.

45
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:44,683
The stores are brightly lit and colorful,

46
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,512
the aisles are wide and the
merchandise is spread out

47
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:50,442
and well organized. That's
why Target is so enjoyable

48
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,831
to shop at, which is why
people end up spending

49
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,914
more time there than they planned.

50
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,051
And studies have shown

51
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:58,201
that the more time
customers spend in a store,

52
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,363
the more likely they are to spend money.

53
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:04,177
Customers also love Target's
exclusive private labels

54
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:07,069
which offer the latest
trends for affordable prices.

55
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:10,267
For example, its kids'
apparel line, Cat and Jack,

56
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,630
surpassed two billion in sales

57
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,282
just one year after its launch.

58
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:15,575
And these are often low cost

59
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:19,347
and so people might buy a lot
more than if they're going

60
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,866
to another store and it
was just national brands.

61
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:23,209
Partnerships with celebrities

62
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,713
like Victoria Beckham and Chrissy Teigen

63
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:28,085
also help drive traffic to the stores.

64
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:31,452
But Target makes sure to
constantly rotate its merchandise.

65
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,369
One of the most effective ways

66
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,278
to make people spend
money is to make them feel

67
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:38,768
like this product is only
gonna be available now.

68
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,784
Like, if you come like, next
week it's not gonna be there.

69
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:41,800
So buy it now.

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,261
This feeds into a sort of

71
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,250
treasure-hunt shopping experience

72
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,252
typical of stores like
TJ Maxx and Marshalls.

73
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,242
And if you're having
trouble finding something

74
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,252
Target employees are easily spotted

75
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,759
thanks to their red shirts.

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,261
If there's someone there to advise you

77
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,244
are more likely to buy things
cause you can get a bit of

78
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,764
an expert opinion. You're not
just shopping on your own.

79
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,142
Then there's Target's social media game

80
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:04,254
which is especially strong on Instagram.

81
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:07,109
It has 3.1 million followers.

82
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,242
That's more than Walmart
and Amazon combined.

83
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:13,485
Target encourages shoppers to
share photos of what they buy

84
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,993
for a chance to be
featured on its account.

85
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:19,011
So people are always posting
about their purchases.

86
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,524
Mary: It kinda brings the shopper in

87
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:23,224
to the experience and
there are loads of Target

88
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:26,492
kinda fan pages dedicated to the store.

89
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,469
Finally, near the cash registers

90
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:31,316
there's what Target calls
Bullseye's Playground,

91
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:34,460
where you'll find seasonal
items for only a few dollars.

92
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,017
I would blame the dollar bins

93
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:36,850
that are in the front.

94
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,263
Like oh I always have a dollar

95
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:39,237
to spend on some things.

96
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:40,993
Like I always get something there.

97
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:44,754
And it's like something
stupid like a pencil holder.

98
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,017
But NYU Professor Priya Raghubir

99
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:49,494
says the real key to Target's success

100
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:52,498
is that you don't actually
regret buying anything.

101
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,018
Those unplanned purchases,

102
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,276
they're often things people do want,

103
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:57,590
they just haven't thought of putting them

104
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,508
on their shopping list. So
what's something you recently

105
00:04:00,508 --> 00:00:00,000
bought at Target that you
weren't planning on getting?
