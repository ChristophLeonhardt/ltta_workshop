GREG: NO MORE HOLLOWING WHEN YOU
TURN 13.
IN CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA ANYONE
OVER 12 CUT TRICK-OR-TREATING
COULD FACE FINES AND JAIL TIME
OF UP TO SIX MONTHS.
IN OTHER NEWS, I'M MOVING TO
CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA.
IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE
TREATING BUT THE TICKING.
TAKING PUMPKINS FROM PORCHES AND
SMASHING THEM IN THE STREET.
IS THIS A JUST OR APPROPRIATE?
BANNING 13 EUROS FROM
TRICK-OR-TREATING POSES A
PROBLEM FOR ME SINCE FOR
HALLOWEEN I GO AS A 13 -YEAR-OL
-YEAR-OLD.
ANYWAY, IF YOU ARE HEADING OUT
THIS HALLOWEEN AND TIRED OF ALL
THE USUAL COSTUMES, DO WE HAVE
IDEAS FOR YOU.
â™ª
>> IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR WHEN
YOU SEARCH AND SEARCH FOR
HALLOWEEN COSTUME BUT CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND ONE RIGHT FOR YOU.
>> I'M TIRED OF THE COSTUMES
THAT OBJECTIFY MY BODY.
THEY ALL WORK THE SAME.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.
>> YOU CAN USE A COSTUME THAT IS
FAIR AND BALANCED.
>> YEAH.
THE FOX NEWS FACEBOOK COSTUME.
NO MISTAKING WHICH CABLE NEWS
ANGER YOU ARE REPRESENTING THE
FOLLOWING LIKE THE BRIAN
KILMEADE, HIS CUSTOM COMES WITH
DARK JACKET, LIGHT SHIRT, KHAKIS
AND A BOLD BUT TASTEFUL TYPE.
OR HOW ABOUT THE STEVE DUCEY
WITH DARK JACKET, LIGHT SHIRT,
KHAKIS AND BOLD BUT TASTEFUL
TYPE.
WE'VE EVEN HAD TUCKER CARLSON
WITH HIS ONE-OF-A-KIND DARK
JACKET, LIGHT SHIRT, KHAKIS AND
A BOLD BUT TASTEFUL TIE.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
ANYTHING ELSE?
>> TIE THE GREG GUTFELD.
>> TAKE MY MONEY NOW.
>> IS THE FOX NEWS FAVORITE
BASIS COSTUME.
GREG: KAT, YOU STILL
TRICK-OR-TREAT AND YOU ARE
ALMOST 40.
KAT: THAT IS SO MEAN.
THAT IS SO MEAN.
I DON'T STILL TRICK-OR-TREAT,
GREG.
I DRINK NOW.
ALTHOUGH, I TRICK-OR-TREAT IT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
DRINK.
OTHER KIDS WERE BUT THEY WERE
NOT INVITING ME SO I DID NOT
DRINK.
I ALSO WANTED TO CONTINUE TO BE
A CHILD AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND
CERTAINLY PAST THE AGE OF 13.
WHEN YOU'RE 13 OR SO GET GOING
OUT WITH FRIENDS AND GETTING
CANDY, IT'S A FUN THING AND NOW
THAT I'M PUSHING 30.
I'M GLAD I HAVE THOSE CHILDHOOD
MEMORIES.
TAKE ABOUT THE FOUNDING FATHERS
SITTING THERE THINKING ABOUT THE
FUTURE OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR
COUNTRY AND I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT
THEY WOULD HAVE ENVISIONED THE
GOVERNMENT INTERFERING TO STOP A
13 -YEAR-OLD FROM ASKING A
NEIGHBOR FOR CANDY, LET ALONE
PUTTING THEM IN JAIL FOREVER AND
WE COMPLETELY LOST HER MIND.
GREG: FOUNDING FATHERS DID NOT
INVENT HOLLOWING.
>> BUT THERE WAS CANDY.
>> GEORGE WASHINGTON DID HAVE
SERIOUS ISSUES WITH 
GREG: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.
MADE OF WOOD.
YOU STILL CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN?
>> DO YOU KNOW IT'S A LIE HE HAD
WENT INTO?
GREG: BUT SOMETHING ELSE WAS
WITHIN.
>> I'M JUST TOSSING THEM TO YOU.
THIS IS JUST .
THEY WANT TO SUCK THE FUN OUT OF
EVERYTHING.
THEY WANT US ALL TO BE AS
VISIBLE AS THEY ARE.
IF YOU WANT CANDY, GO GET KENNY.
WE WANT TO SIT HOME AND DON'T
HAVE CANDY, DON'T HAVE CANDY.
GREG: I LIKE APPETIZERS, ARE YOU
FOR TRICK-OR-TREATERS?
TYRUS: YEAH, THEY ARE SO EXCITED
WHEN I COME TO THE DOOR.
I'M NOT A BIG HOLLOWING GUY
BECAUSE NO CUSTOMS FITS I HAVE
TWO CHOICES.
I COULD GO GREEN STUFF ON MY
FACE.
HALLOWEEN IS NOT MY THING BUT
THIS POSES THE PROBLEMS.
ART, GUNS CAN BE SANCTUARY
CITIES WHERE YOU CAN GO AROUND
THOSE CREEPY PASTORS UP IN THE
COSTUMES AND COSPLAY AND
DRESSING UP AND 365 AND EVERYONE
IS A SEXY BOX OR LOBSTER OR
WHATEVER THE HELL OR UNICORN, IN
YOUR CASE, ANIMALS CAN BE SEXY.
NOT MY THING BUT I'M JUST
SAYING.
YOU CAN BE A SEXY BOX IF YOU
WANT TO.
THIS IS EXACT WHAT KAT SAYS,
COMPLETE OVERKILL.
THIRTEEN -YEAR-OLDS ARE STILL A
CHILD.
WHAT HAPPENS IS IT ADDRESSES UP
IN THE KIDS AWAY FROM DAD FOR A
SECOND DOES HE GET TACKLED IN
THE STREET AND BE NOT?
TO GO DRESSING UP.
CLEARLY HE IS OVER 13.
GREG: I USUALLY TELL PEOPLE THAT
LEFT MY KID IN THE PARK.
I REMEMBER JEDEDIAH YOU SHOWED
UP IN THE VIEW AS BETTY BOOP.
TYRUS: WHAT CHAPTER IS THAT IN
THE BOOK?
>> THAT DID NOT MAKE THE BOOK.
YOU SAID WHAT ABOUT IT.
YOU SAID YOU WERE ON A
STAIRMASTER --
STAIRMASTER.--
GREG: SHE CAME OUT DANCING AS A
BETTY BOOP AND IT WAS SO
PAINFUL.
IT WAS BAD.
IT WAS AWFUL.
I FEEL BAD.
>> I LIKE BETTY BOOP THOUGH.
WHAT A JOY, AS?
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.
GREG: IT'S GREAT WHEN PEOPLE GET
ARRESTED ON HALLOWEEN BECAUSE
THEY GET THEIR MUG SHOT IN THE
COSTUME AND MY BUDDY AND I SWEAR
ON A STACK OF BIBLES OR THOSE
BOOKS HE WENT TO HOLLOWING AS A
CONVICT SO HE WAS IN STRIPES AND
HE HAS A PLASTIC BALL AND CHAIN.
HE GOT ARRESTED FOR -- I'M NOT
IN A SAY WHAT WAS BUT IT WAS A
COMMON CRIME AND HE WAS BOOKED
AND IN JAIL OVERNIGHT AND
EVERYONE RIPPED THEM TO SHREDS.
GOOD STORY.
>> REMEMBER WHEN HALLOWEEN --
>> TUCKER CARLSON.
