THE REPUBLICANS PASSED THEIR
TAX BILL, AND NOW IT LEAVES A
GIANT HOLE IN THE DEFICIT, ABOUT
$1.5 TRILLION.
THEY SAID THEY
CARED ABOUT BALANCING THE
BUDGET, THEY PROVED THAT WAS
NOTHING BUT A LIE, THEY DON'T
MIND PUTTING TRILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OF DEBT ONTO THE COUNTRY
AS LONG AS IT GOES TO THE RICH
DONORS AND THEIR CORPORATE
DONORS, THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.
BUT THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT
TRICKLE-DOWN, DON'T WORRY, THEY
MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN MILLIONS, BUT
MAYBE SOME OF IT WILL TRICKLE
DOWN ON YOUR HEAD.
IT TURNS OUT
A WOMAN WROTE IN ON TWITTER
SAYING IT DID, AND PAUL RYAN
WANTED TO CELEBRATE IT.
OKAY,
FAIR IS FAIR, LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT THE FACTS ARE.
RYAN SAYS IN
A TWEET THAT IS NOT DELETED, AS
YOU WILL SEE WHY --
WOW.
COSTCO MEMBERSHIP,
APPARENTLY 60 BUCKS,
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S NOT
$1.50 PER HOUR, OR EVEN PER DAY,
THAT'S AN EXTRA $1.50 PER WEEK.
THANK YOU, PAUL RYAN, YOU ARE SO
GENEROUS.
BUT EVEN NANCY PELOSI
WOKE UP TO RESPOND 
TO THIS, SHE
SAID --
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
LOOK AT NANCY PELOSI FIGHTING
BACK.
GLAD TO SEE THE BATTLE IS
JOINED.
I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK
THAT YES, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
TAX BILL PASSED THE KOCH
BROTHERS SENT $500,000 TO A PAUL
RYAN PAC, JOB WELL DONE, WAY TO
DELIVER FOR US.
THAT BILL HAS
BILLIONS -- NOT MILLIONS,
BILLIONS -- OF DOLLARS OF
SAVINGS FOR THE KOCH FAMILY
ALONE, LET ALONE THE BILLIONS IT
SAVES THE WALTON FAMILY, LET
ALONE THE TRILLIONS IT SAVES
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.
BUT
YOU GET $1.50 A WEEK.
AND HE
SENT THAT OUT LIKE HEY, WE TOLD
YOU WE WOULD DELIVER FOR YOU.
SO
$1.50 A WEEK FOR YOU, HOW MUCH
FOR THE TOP 1%?
FORBES REPORTS
--
DO YOU EVEN MAKE $51,000?
I
KNOW A LOT OF YOU DON'T. $51,000
EXTRA IN TAX INDUCTIONS FOR THE
TOP 1%.
BUT YOU GET $1.50 A
WEEK, SHOULDN'T YOU CELEBRATE?
KEITH ELLISON WROTE --
SO YOU GET $1.50 A WEEK,
WELLS FARGO GETS $3.4 BILLION IN
TAX BREAKS.
IT'S FOR THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN.
AND OTHERS WROTE THIS
TOO, THEY POINTED OUT THAT PAUL
RYAN -- I THINK JON FAVREAU
DID, FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR
BARACK OBAMA -- PAUL RYAN
PROBABLY THOUGHT, WHAT?
HE
GENUINELY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW
INSULTING THAT IS.
WHAT, I GAVE
YOU THE CRUMBS?
WHAT DID YOU
THINK I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU?
OF COURSE THE BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS WERE GOING TO GO TO MY
DONORS.
I GAVE YOU CRUMBS AND
YOU ARE STILL COMPLAINING?
AS I
BELIEVE SOMEONE ELSE POINTED
OUT, FOR $1.50 A WEEK YOU CAN'T
EVEN BUY CAKE, SO THEY ARE EVEN
WORSE THAN MARIE ANTOINETTE.
AND
FINALLY, THE PERSON MOST JUMPING
INTO THE FRAY IN THIS CASE WAS
RANDY BRYCE, UNDERSTANDABLY SO,
BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING AGAINST
PAUL RYAN IN THAT SEAT.
PAUL
RYAN IS THINKING ABOUT RETIRING,
A LITTLE SCARED OF THE
COMPETITION AND WHICH WAY THIS
ELECTION MIGHT GO.
HIS OPPONENT
IS RANDY BRYCE, WHO'S ALSO BY
THE WAY A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT, AND
HE TWEETED OUT THIS --
AND WE'LL PUT THOSE LINKS DOWN
BELOW IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX AS
WELL, RANDY BRYCE, AN IRONWORKER
KNOWN AS IRON STACHE, AND PAUL
RYAN IS NOT COMING FOR HIM AS IT
TURNS OUT, HE'S COMING FOR PAUL
RYAN.
SO PAUL RYAN BETTER SAVE
UP ALL THE KOCH BROTHERS MONEY,
HE'S GOING TO NEED IT BECAUSE HE
MIGHT BE IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HIS
CONSTITUENTS ARE UP TO, THE
STATE OF AFFAIRS IN HIS DISTRICT
OR ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND
HE THINK YOU SHOULD CELEBRATE
THEIR CRUMBS.
I DON'T THINK
PEOPLE WILL BE IN MUCH OF A
CELEBRATORY MOOD IN NOVEMBER.
