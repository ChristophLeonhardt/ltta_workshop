am<font color="#E5E5E5"> making this video to declare I am</font>

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">afraid of no government or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute in</font>

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,280
the world and I am not afraid to call

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,050
out corruption when I see it no matter

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,469
how small or large it may be there are

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,470
so many instances in society today where

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,140
people turn a blind eye and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,570
think it's due to intention for the most

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,880
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because we are living</font>

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,519
increasingly busy lives due to social

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,070
and economic pressures and I think by

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,380
doing a video like this it's a helpful

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,200
reminder that we should look<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for</font>

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,750
others that's the whole part of being in

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,300
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful society looking out for</font>

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,340
each other ensuring it your fellow man

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,969
and woman is taken care of and I hope

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,460
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> join me by making a video of</font>

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,070
your own explaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you will no</font>

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,320
longer turn a blind eye to in justices

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,309
in the world and why others should take

23
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,460
that same attitude I think we've ever

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,070
growing corporations and ever-growing

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,890
governments there are a lot of things

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that aren't in the public interest and</font>

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,549
with the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the free-flowing</font>

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,130
of information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're lucky to still</font>

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,500
have for the most part we should have an

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,720
obligation to educate ourselves so we

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,270
can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> better decisions for others it</font>

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,070
shouldn't all be left to the government

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,080
we should be holding them accountable

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,380
with educated perspectives not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,490
emotional rage when things aren't done

36
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,040
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually at times when it's too</font>

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,590
late<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe they've done stuff that we</font>

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,360
didn't want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we have an</font>

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,729
obligation to do it and so whenever you

40
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,280
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that is a public</font>

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
interest share it because you're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,810
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks away and I think that</font>

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first part and big major</font>

44
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,850
step of turning a blind eye no longer

45
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,399
the other part is making a video like

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:00:00,000
