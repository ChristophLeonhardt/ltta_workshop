THE SON OF ALABAMA REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE ROY MOORE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN ARRESTED FOR THE NINTH TIME. THIS IS HIS SON WHO ISN'T RUNNING SO YOU MIGHT THINK WHY DO WE CARE, WE WILL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF REASONS TO CARE. HERE IS THE PHOTO OF THE NINE TIME ARRESTEE, CALEB MOORE, HE SEEMS TO KIND OF LIKE IT. HE LOOKS LIKE SUCH A SPOILED PRICK. IT'S HARD TO TELL FROM ONE PHOTO BUT I DIAGNOSED HIM WITH A LITTLE BIT OF AFFLUENZA. ANYWAY THAT WILL GET YOU IN TROUBLE. THEY ARE RELATED, OF COURSE, MAYBE YOU CAN LUMP THOSE TOGETHER. NOW I AGREE, IT IS A CHEAP TRICK. I DON'T KNOW WHY CALEB MOORE IS PULLING THESE TRICKS AND GETTING ARRESTED ALL THE TIME. STOP IT, YOU ARE DISTRACTING YOUR FATHER. ANYWAY CALEB MOORE BACK IN 2015 SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR DURING ONE OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED AGAIN, YES, IT IS TERRIBLE SO STOP DOING IT. BY THE WAY HE HAS BEEN BUSY. IN 2015 HE ALSO HAD A CHARGE WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT WITH MARIJUANA AND XANAX. IT'S NOT A CRAZY THOUGHT THAT THERE ARE POLITICALLY RELATED ARRESTS IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA. KARL ROVE FAMOUSLY ORCHESTRATED THE ARREST OF THE GOVERNOR, WHO WAS A DEMOCRAT, RUINED HIS CAREER AND SENT HIM TO PRISON. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS POLITICAL TRICKS OF ALL TIME. SO REPUBLICANS IN THAT STATE MIGHT BE THINKING, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME, WE BURY PEOPLE TOTALLY UNFAIRLY. NOW, IN THIS CASE, REALLY? THEY ARE GOING TO GO AFTER A GUY THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT ROY MOORE WOULD RUN FOR SENATE, HE JUST RAN THIS YEAR, BUT JUST IN CASE THEY ARRESTED HIS SON EIGHT OTHER TIMES IN THE PAST? THEY CALLED UP THE STATE OF FLORIDA HEY, THAT GUY IS PROBABLY DRIVING DRUNK AGAIN, CAN YOU GO GET HIM FOR POLITICAL REASONS? OR PERHAPS THE EIGHT OTHER ARRESTS WERE JUST BECAUSE HE'S A KNUCKLEHEAD, AND PROBABLY THE NINTH ONE AS WELL. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK THAT FAR TO FIND CALEB MOORE BREAKING THE LAW. DOESN'T SEEM DIFFICULT. AS WE SAID, HE IS EFFECTIVELY HE'S RELATED TO SOMEONE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, A VERY HIGH PROFILE AND NASTY GUY WITH A TERRIBLE HISTORY AND REPUTATION, BUT HE'S STILL BASICALLY A PRIVATE CITIZEN SO YOU WOULD BE FINE TO THINK THAT MAYBE THIS DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, BUT IT DOES KIND OF MATTER BECAUSE HIS FATHER HAS BEEN A JUDGE FOR A LONG TIME, THIS IS CLEARLY SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT HIS FAMILY CONNECTIONS ALLOW HIM TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS, AND I WOULD SAY MORE IMPORTANTLY, ALTHOUGH PERHAPS A LESS PROFILE ISSUE, IS MANY OF THE THINGS HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR, OTHER THAN THE DUIs, MARIJUANA CHARGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT, HOW ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE THEM BE ILLEGAL? HOW ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE ULTRACONSERVATIVE PEOPLE LIKE HIS DAD MAKING IT SO PEOPLE CAN ROUTINELY GET ARRESTED A NUMBER OF TIMES FOR CONSUMING SOMETHING THAT IS FAR LESS BAD FOR YOU THAN THE ALCOHOL THAT EVERYONE AROUND US IS DRINKING CONSTANTLY? I WOULD LEGALIZE MARIJUANA SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ARRESTED FOR THOSE THINGS. SOME OF IT, HUNTING WITHOUT A PERMIT IF YOU DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT PERMIT BECAUSE YOU DROVE DRUNK THERE, I UNDERSTAND. IF YOU WERE SHOOTING A GUN IN YOUR BACKYARD, THAT'S DANGEROUS, IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE KID, HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S INCREDIBLY SPOILED, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE'S ROY MOORE'S SON, THAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A GOOD WAY TO GROW UP. HIS DAD IS A MASSIVE PRICK. HE'S NOT REALLY THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS, IT'S EVERYTHING AROUND IT. BUT IT DOES GET UNDER PEOPLE' AS NURSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU GOT ARRESTED EIGHT TIMES WITH TWO DUIS YOU WOULD BE IN PRISON, UNLESS YOUR DADDY WAS A JUDGE WHO CARES ABOUT LAW AND ORDER EXCEPT WHEN IT IS HIS SON. SO NOW HERE COMES DADDY TO THE RESCUE AGAIN PRETENDING IT'S A POLITICAL VENDETTA WHEN HE IS ARRESTED FOR THE NINTH TIME. HE JUST MEANS LAW AND ORDER FOR HIMSELF, NOT THE REST OF HIS FAMILY.
