let me ask you something that I find equally terrifying and that is governments pressuring these social media companies to crack down in Canada there was a story in the Toronto Star Justin Trudeau threatened Sheryl Sandberg the CEO of Facebook saying fix your quote fake news problem in Canada before my re-election or I will fix it for you that was in the star as a shocking we see this in Europe too especially in Germany how much of this censorship is social justice warriors embedded in Facebook Google YouTube Twitter and how much is government saying you know what if I passed a law I'd have to do so through a legislature transparency people could see what I was doing if I just have a private meeting with Facebook and either threaten them or offer them something in return they can do my dirty work and no one will even know it's hard to know and I don't know that we could ever break that down I mean there are so many members of Google for example close to the Obama administration that he wouldn't have had to really threaten them they just would have carried out what he wanted I'm sure it's the same in Canada where there are high-level tech executives who are very much on the left and are big fans of Trudeau it's probably only his own ineptitude that he would have to have made that threat explicit or even implicit he wouldn't have to say anything at all I mean if you wanted to be cool if you were in a social media company you sided with Obama and/or with Hillary Clinton and everybody understood that it was you know kind of hip thing to be and where you wanted to be on the political spectrum so the trick is not to do that heavy-handed stuff and the danger is as Alexis de Tocqueville predicted almost 200 years ago that when that form of despotism comes that is most dangerous and pervasive it will come largely through the consent of the governed and not through the tyranny of the ruler so that's something of what we see here that people are indulging these anti-free speech campaigns because they are coming from people they like or because they're coming from private companies not from the government or because they're attacking unpopular ideas unpopular people so real challenges to articulate the case as to why this is bad and that's something I think conservatives have to do a much better job of carrying out that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
