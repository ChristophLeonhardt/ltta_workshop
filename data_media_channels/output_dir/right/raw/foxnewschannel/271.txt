ANNA CALDWELL.

19
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:28,190
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE

20
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,992
MEETING BETWEEN KANYE AND THE

21
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:30,393
PRESIDENT?

22
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:35,131
DO YOU THINK ANYTHING WILL COME

23
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:35,464
FROM IT?

24
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:36,165
>> I THINK THIS IS AN EXCITING

25
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:36,933
TIME WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING

26
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,100
THE VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO.

27
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:39,068
CANDIDATE TRUMP OFTEN DISCUSSED

28
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,436
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN CHICAGO.

29
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:43,172
I KNOW TO MANY ON THE LEFT AND

30
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:44,707
MAY SAYERS IN THE MEDIA SAID

31
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,408
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

32
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:48,210
WHAT WE SEE IS A SYSTEMIC

33
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,446
VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED IN

34
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:50,813
CHICAGO.

35
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:52,248
WE'VE GOT ALMOST 24 SHOOTINGS

36
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:53,282
THAT OCCURRED THIS YEAR AND THE

37
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:55,451
MOST DEADLY WEEKEND IN CHICAGO'S

38
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:56,319
HISTORY OCCURRED THIS YEAR.

39
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,454
WHEN IT COMES TO THE TOPICS IN

40
00:00:58,455 --> 00:00:59,422
WHICH THEY'LL DISCUSS, THAT WILL

41
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:01,457
BE ONE OF THE THINGS, POLICE

42
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,427
REFORM -- NOT POLICE REFORM BUT

43
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,562
PRISON REFORM WILL BE ANOTHER.

44
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:07,730
JARED KUSHNER WILL BE IN THE

45
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,097
ROOM.

46
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:09,465
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THE

47
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:10,232
ADMINISTRATION DOES CARE ABOUT

48
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:11,567
AND THEY WANT TO SEE SOLUTIONS

49
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:12,468
COME TO THE TABLE.

50
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:14,170
HEATHER:  JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE

51
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,738
AT HOME, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

52
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,940
VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO, YOU KNOW

53
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:18,341
FIRSTHAND.

54
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:19,542
YOU'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT

55
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:21,010
STATS AND POLL NUMBERS AND THAT

56
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,078
TYPE OF THING.

57
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,180
YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER, LUCKY TO

58
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,414
BE ALIVE AS A RESULT OF SOME OF

59
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:25,715
THAT.

60
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:26,048
>> YES.

61
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,485
HEATHER:  CAN YOU PEOPLE

62
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:29,518

HEATHER:  CAN YOU TELLLE

65
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:30,486
HEATHER:  CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE A

66
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:30,920
LITTLE MORE.

67
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,822
>> LAST YEAR MY BROTHER WAS IN A

68
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:34,223
CAR WITH A COUPLE FRIENDS WHEN

69
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,625
TWO MEN WALKED UP AND SHOT THE

70
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:37,093
CAR 25 TIMES.

71
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:38,961
THANKFULLY, HE LIVED.

72
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:40,229
HIS BEST FRIEND DIED IN HIS

73
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,529
ARMS.

74
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,631
THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE IS SO

75
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,133
IMPORTANT TO ME AND I'M THANKFUL

76
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:46,736
TO THE FOX NEWS FAMILY WHICH

77
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,204
ALLOWED ME TO HIGHLIGHT

78
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,039
THIS ISSUE AND GO TO CHICAGO AND

79
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,874
INTERVIEW GANG MEMBERS AND TALK

80
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,876
ABOUT THESE ISSUES.

81
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:59,815
THIS IS WHY THIS IS SUCH AN

82
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:00,316
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

83
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:00,983
I KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

84
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:03,386
RECENTLY DISCUSSED WHAT'S GOING

85
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:08,324
ON IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, LIKE

86
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:09,391
CRISIS INTERVENTION, USE OF

87
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:10,860
FORCE TO NAME A FEW THINGS.

88
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,561
HEATHER:  WHAT DO YOU THINK

89
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,698
ABOUT STOP AND?

90
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:16,032
FRISK?

91
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,833
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT ON

92
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,167
MONDAY.

93
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,836
>> THE STOP AND FRISK ISSUE IS

94
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:25,441
SOMETHING THAT'S RULED AS

95
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:25,941
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

96
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:26,976
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JEFF

97
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,345
SESSIONS GOING IN AND

98
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:31,447
POTENTIALLY UPROOTING THE

99
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,382
CONSENT DECREE, I THINK IT COULD

100
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:36,886
BE MA PARTICULAR.

101
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:37,319
PROBLEMATIC.

102
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,092
THE REASON FOR CONSENT DECREES

103
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:43,759
IS TO -- IS WHEN THERE'S

104
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,393
CONSIDERATION OF POLICE

105
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:45,227
MISCONDUCT AND CORRUPTION.

106
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:48,197
YOU THINK ABOUT CASES LIKE JOHN

107
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:50,466
BURGE WHO TORTURED OVER 200

108
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,402
SUSPECTS, HIM AND HIS TEAM, COST

109
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:54,770
THE CITY OF CHICAGO OVER

110
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:55,204
$100 MILLION.

111
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:59,875
YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAQUAN

112
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:00,943
McDONALD SHOOTING.

113
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:01,410
YOU THINK

114
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,578
ABOUT A FORMER POLICE OFFICER

115
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,680
WHO WAS ACCUSED OF FRAMING OVER

116
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:07,383
51 PEOPLE OF MURDER AND THIS WAS

117
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:10,086
FOLKS THAT WERE CONVICTED FOR UP

118
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:11,620
TO 2300 YEARS, COMBINED.

119
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,658
SO WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS IN A

120
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,860
VERY STRATEGIC WAY BECAUSE IT

121
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,662
ISN'T JUST A SHOOTING IN CHICAGO

122
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:21,097
THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED

123
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:21,430
ABOUT.

124
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:26,669
WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

125
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,103
FULL PICTURE.

126
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,770
WE WANT THE ENTIRE CITY --

127
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:28,571
HEATHER:  WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF

128
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:28,871
TIME.

129
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:30,106
THAT'S PART OF WHAT KANYE IS

130
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:31,240
HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH.

131
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,508
QUICKLY, THE BACKLASH THAT HE

132
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:34,176
RECEIVED, IT REALLY HAS BEEN

133
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:35,111
DISTURBING WHEN YOU LISTEN TO

134
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,645
SOME LEADERS FROM THE BLACK

135
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:37,880
COMMUNITY SAYING HE'S CRAZY,

136
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,381
HE'S GONE TO THE HOSPITAL, HE

137
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:40,716
SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO HIM, ALL

138
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:42,718
THAT TYPE OF THING.

139
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,020
>> I AM COMPLETELY DISTURBED

140
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:46,655
THAT THEY WOULD GO AFTER KANYE

141
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:48,824
IN A WAY THAT HAD

142
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:48,858
IN A WAY THET HAD

143
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:49,225
IN A WAY THEY HAD

144
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:49,625
IN A WAY THEY HAVE.

145
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:52,061
IF OWE WERE

146
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:52,094
IF HWE WERE

147
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:52,361
IF HEE WERE

148
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:52,394
IF HE WWERE

149
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:52,428
IF HE WERRE

150
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:52,461
IF HE WEREE

151
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,130
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYC

152
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:54,163
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYI

153
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:54,196
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYT

154
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:54,230
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYN

155
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:54,330
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARY,

156
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:54,363
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYY

157
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,030
IF HE WERE INSUPPORT OF HILLARYU

158
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:56,632
WOULDN'T SEE THE BACKLASH.

159
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,868
YOU WOULDN'T SEE THIS FROM THE

160
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:59,468
LIBERAL ELITE.

161
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:00,603
TO CONSIDER A MAN LIKE THIS WHO

162
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:03,005
HAS BEEN QUITE FRANKLY A GENIUS

163
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:09,011
IN HIS CREATION OF MUSIC, WENT

164
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:09,845
FROM PRODUCING TO RAPPING TO NOW

165
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:10,613
BEING A FASHION MOGUL, HOW COULD

166
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:13,749
YOU CALL THIS GUY DUMB OR STUPID

167
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,151
AS WE SEE SOME OF MY FRIENDS ON

168
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:17,386
THE OTHER SIDE, OTHER NETWORK

169
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,554
HAVE SAID ABOUT HIM.

170
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:19,855
I'M COMPLETELY DISTURBED THAT

171
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:21,190
THEY WOULD GO AFTER SOMEONE LIKE

172
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,489
THIS.

173
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:23,759
I KNOW BLACK CONSERVATIVES ALL

174
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,161
OVER THE COUNTRY FEEL HIS PAIN

175
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,496
BECAUSE WE WHO GO ON NATIONAL

176
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:28,564
PLATFORMS ARE REGULARLY CALLED

177
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:30,866
THOSE THINGS BY THE LIBERAL

178
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:31,167
LEFT.

179
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,601
HEATHER:  THANK YOU SO MUCH.

180
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,936
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING

181
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:34,470
US.

182
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,338
I HOPE HE ACCOMPLISHES A LOT.

183
00:04:36,339 --> 00:00:00,000
I HOPE THE MEETING BETWEEN
