here it is folks your spoiler warning okay we've done your spoiler warning you have been warned and there's nothing I can do about it now if you've decided to go this far you're gonna go with us the rest of the way so here's the preface here's a little bit of the preview for Star Wars the last Jedi and then I have many a thought many a thought indeed or something beside me has always been Oh so when we first left last lesson left off our side of them just a recap we left off the force awakens so you can stop the preview there when we when we left the force awakens Ray had randomly been amazing at everything she was the ultimate Mary Sue in science fiction literature she literally came out of nowhere and was incredible with a lightsaber so such that kylo Ren who's supposed to be a guy trained in his youth about the force trained in using a lightsaber it gets defeated by her in a lightsaber battle the first time she's literally ever picked up a lightsaber which is I'm stupid okay and then they defeated the Starkiller base which was the new Death Star because every other movie we have to have a new Death Star because no one ever has a practical new idea in Star Wars universe apparently okay and and so we start off this movie and basically it's as though the forcement weekend ever happened essentially the first order is still extraordinarily powerful right it's in the new Empire they're still extraordinarily powerful it didn't matter to them at all that their Death Star got blown up nothing matters and the Rebel Alliance is on the run so it's like Return of the Jedi and it's like the entire Star Wars series never happened right the Empire was never defeated we're basically starting from the exact same point we started in Episode four where the Empire is in control and they and literally it is the beginning of Star Wars Episode four right I mean they're the Empire ship is chase it the first-order ship is chasing this transport vessel it's literally the beginning of episode four okay so I'm gonna go through some of my minor problems with this and then I will go through some of my major problems so I'll go through my bad things about this movie and my good things about this movie so again the first bad thing is the force awakens apparently never happened now I'd be fine with that I didn't like the force awakens I thought that it was a cheesy recasting my biggest problem with with the entire series is what they can't decide in Star Wars land whether they want it to benefit from nostalgia or they want to make it an astrologist centric series or they wanted to launch something new and so they decided to do both and what they ended up doing in the process was killing all of the old things and in preparation for the new and that's nasty to my childhood okay I come for the nostalgia because I thought that the first you know the the new episodes that George Lucas made were terrible the stuff I liked is episode four five six right the stuff that everybody likes is is new hope Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi couldn't care less about Phantom Menace or Revenge of the Sith or any of that crap okay four five and six and where it's at so I grew up with Han Solo I grew up with Luke Skywalker I grew up with Princess Leia in fact my sister's middle name one of my sisters middle names is Leia because I was such a big Star Wars man because my parents asked me what I thought her middle name should be and I picked Lee up because that was a big star Wars fan okay so I am a huge Star Wars nut in the last movie they killed off Han Solo for no reason they turned Han Solo who is one of the coolest most roguish figures who becomes honorable in thin film or they turned him into a loser single dad who can't hold his crap together and gets killed by his whiny brat son for no reason at all I hate like when I remember leaving the theater from the force awakens and thinking oh that wasn't so bad and then the more I thought about it the more it made me want to tear my own teeth out it was just it so if the force awakens had never really happened I'd be a much happier camper also Han would be alive which would be a lot better okay so it starts with that then it's then the force awakens again ends with the idea that the first-order might finally be on the run a little bit they are not at all so okay number two these are minor problems but there are some like basic kind of whole plot holes it starts off with these bombers right these bombers that bomb a dreadnought and the Bombers apparently gravity applies in space which is weird like they actually just drop bombs onto the Dreadnought in space so unless there's an actual gravitational field which I assume would be pulling the the Bombers toward the dread-nots which they're not I don't understand how the bombs fall down onto the onto the dread-nots it doesn't make any sense to me that is one problem that that problem is also accompanied by another problem that is a logistical one near the end of the film one of the good people Laura turned in a bizarre turn decides that she is going to run a transport vessel through a Star Destroyer using Lightspeed it's a cool image why has no one ever thought of this in the history of Star Wars especially because if you recall and returned the Jedi there is an actual scene where I start Destroyer goes down because someone does a kamikaze run right on the Star Destroyer remember this returning the Jedi one of the ships kind of flies out of control boom goes right through the control tower and down goes the entire Star Destroyer why is no one ever thought to use Star to use Lightspeed as a weapon you could just get rid of the entire first scene or if they knew that Lightspeed was you Villas weapon why would they sacrifice a couple of medical ships right there's a point earlier in the film where a couple of ships are they they basically run out of gas and they're blown apart by the first order if they know they have this tactic available why don't you turn one of those ships around and run it with light speed right through the Star Destroyer like this is the ultimate weapon in the universe you can take down the Death Star this way but apparently this has never occurred to anyone until laura dern in her purple hair okay another problem Snoke okay so they make Snoke out to be the big baddie in the force awakens and they make it he's the he's the big baddie he's the scary guy he's the new Emperor and he's so powerful in the forest that he can turn kylo Ren from afar right never be meets kylo Ren and he turns kylo Ren away from Luke that's how powerful he is and this film they showed that he's super powerful because Rey is super paola throw him a force and he's like throwing around like nothing right he just stops her from doing anything right he's super duper powerful you never find out who he is you never find out what motivates him you never find out where he came from and he gets killed like that right he gets killed as like a literally a hot knife going through butter right they who literally gets killed with a little trick by kylo Ren that is so cheesy and silly that it makes very little sense it makes sense and Return of the Jedi right is it they have an exact Return of the Jedi scene where you have the good guy and the bad guy and they're both in front of the Emperor now in Return of the Jedi it makes sense the Emperor says to Luke take up your your take up your lightsabers strike me down you'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine Luke does it and Darth Vader stops him right that's cool and it's dramatic here kylo Ren basically just activates it with his mind somebody equipped if only they had lightsaber trigger control this never would have happened if only the NRA had not stumped four four four no gun locks on the on the lightsabers then Snoke would still be alive but the big problem is of course you can't build up a big baddie like that and then I'll tell him and tell us who he is or why he's there fourth problem kylo Ren who is now the only interesting character left in the Star Wars universe because they've killed everyone is not intimidating this is not a problem with this film this is a problem with the force awakens in the force awakens remember it takes Darth Vader three films three to lose a battle or to be convertible to the light side it takes them three films the first thing you see is Darth Vader is him literally blow open the door and strangling somebody picking them up off the ground and strangling him then he dispatches Luke the most powerful Jedi in history he dispatches Luke by chopping off his hand and beating the crap out of him in Empire Strikes Back right and he's basically beating Luke in Return of the Jedi until Luke basically taps into the dark side of the force so it takes him three movies to get there kylo Ren in the first five minutes of the force awakens we find out it's conflicted and then it turns out he can be bested by Rey the ultimate MarySue which means he's not scary if you're gonna have someone scary heading up the first order that person can't be defeated well by a girl who just picked up a lightsaber for the first time ever now if you want to say the girl trained in it fine but she didn't train in it she just picked up and she's fantastic at it why exactly at this point in the film at this point in the series why should the Rebel Alliance be worried look I don't know where they go for episode 9 why should they be worried Rey is significantly more powerful than kylo we know this we've seen it so where's the competition now no clue right and general Hux is not exactly terrifying like general Hux is not the emperor okay another problem Ray's backstory is terrible now I understand what they're trying to do they're trying to make up for the fact this movie I feel bad for me on Johnson the director and the writer because I feel like who's trying to make up for flaws and the other movies so in this movie with Rey they were basically trying to cure one of the problems that was created by George Lucas with his stupid-ass midi-chlorians nonsense I said George Lucas had this whole thing about you know that the forest runs in your bloodline and this is how we know that you're powerful with the force and all this kind of stuff it was always done well the problem here is that they made a big deal out of the last movie what who is Rey where did she come from and it seems like for some reason she knows Han right there's there's this weird kind of relationship where you remember this Austin it seems like she knows Han in the force awakens it seems like everybody sort of knows who she is but then it turns out that she's just some girl from middle of nowhere which would have been fine except you built it up like there's something interesting about her background so you picked literally the least interesting background for her that you could find and then and I understand what you're trying to do you're trying to make it that everyone can be participants in the force we're trying to get out of Plato's Republic where there are gradations of human and into the the Democrat the Democratic Society where everyone can be a Jedi I get it I get it but it's not dramatic and then your real way okay another another problem I didn't need that entire scene of Luke like milking a sea cow that was just weird but yeah I just it was just weird and gross and I wasn't I was big on it but a bigger problem with Luke is it Luke happens to be an incredibly crappy teacher so Luke actually he's making a good point the Jedi do suck at everything okay the Jedi were involved in the original creation of the Empire the Jedi did fail to stop the Sith they basically emboldened the Sith the Jedi were not particularly successful at maintaining the Republic so they stunk in everything so Luke is right about this but he's also a bad teacher right break comes and she he says I'm gonna offer you three lessons the first lesson is the force exists the second lesson is feel this rock and there is no third lesson right not a good teacher that that guy gets a bad review on college professors calm okay and also Yoda showing up I was not okay another problem celebrity cameos as I mentioned before Lordran with purple hair no and Benicio del Toro my god man okay which brings us to that entire storyline no no that entire storyline no okay that's an entire stupid storyline Laura Dern's character could have just told Poe Dameron guess what we're gonna send a bunch of transports to this random planet could they not have just done that instead she pretends like she doesn't like she has no plan it's kind of evil and then what happens is that Poe comes up with some stupid plans to go to to go to like intergalactic Monte Carlo with weird creatures that looks like it's from Harry Potter and their weird dog rabbits that run around camel horses that run around also we can get a bunch of social justice warrior crap about income inequality and animal rights there was a line of this movie so bad that I legitimately was thinking about walking out of the theater and there's a line in this movie we're after Finn who is useless right he is useless and Rose who is double useless they go to this stupid planet and then they free the animals who have been abused this is how we know the rebels are good guys because they don't like animals being abused right okay great okay this is a far cry by the way from Empire Strikes Back where Han literally cuts open the belly of a what is it a tauntaun thank you and stuffs Luke inside right but now we have to make sure that all of the rights of the animals are upheld because this is deeply important listen I'm for animal rights but what does Star Wars have to do animal rights like what the hell and they and and fin turns to rose and he says well I guess it was worth it you mean losing the entire galaxy was worth you going there to free a few camel horses that will be recaptured five seconds from now was that the thing that was worth it and then the worst line in the film Rose turns to him she takes a saddle off the camel horse dog and she goes now it's worth it what no it's not like it's not like your whole job here is to get this gal that this this hacker guy so you can go back to fake Death Star and hack the program no no no no no no also they should have killed Finn okay when Finn is riding at the end directly toward that that giant blaster weapon toward the battering ram he should have just died okay he they should have killed him at the end of force awakens to add some gravitas this is my biggest problem they will not kill any of the new characters because they're trying to preserve the new characters instead they kill all of the old cool characters who I actually like I don't like Finn he's boring I don't care about rose she's boring Wray is only not boring because she has interactions with kylo Ren okay everyone is boring in the new city in the new scenario and they're killing off all of the cool characters who made this thing into a legacy in the first place which brings me to Rose don't even get me started no no no no no okay fine okay Captain phasma also like was she supposed to be a thing well I get cuz she wasn't a thing okay Captain phasma was it like she's there for five seconds she's dressed up as as you know it's Brienne of Tarth too dressed as Bubba Fett she's posed to be so cool Finn the janitor takes her out fail oh yeah and a few more criticism they don't get some good stuff okay so the credit wasn't one of criticism at Luke the best moments in the movie aside from the the kylo Ren the the kylo Ren Rey team-up which is the best part of the movie aside from that the best moments of the movie is the part where Luke strides out of the of the cave and kylo Ren has every 8080 fire on him and then Luke just walks right out of it right super cool they then destroy the coolness of this moment by having it be basically a hologram right he's using astral projection probably cuz you still back at stupid planet why would you do that how'd you do that the entire coolness of it is that he's actually there stopping the blasters it's not cool if they're just shooting a hologram because Holograms can't be damaged we all know that why would you do that so in one case we know so the force is used in two ways in this film that we've never seen it used before and we'll never see it used again one it apparently protects you from space death so Princess Leia gets blown out into space she's never used the force at all that we've seen except for one time when she used her mind to reach out to Luke's mind at the end of Empire and now she can suddenly rescue herself from space and fly which is a cool thing I guess like I didn't know this was the thing also if that were a thing why wouldn't the emperor use it at the Empire at the end of Return of the Jedi right Darth Vader literally takes the Emperor and throws him down a wormhole Sangeeth rows him down the shaft the Maya shaft right why wouldn't if he can flow I wouldn't just flow I'm so confused by this okay so that is one fourth thing that we didn't know about a second floor thing we didn't know about is this astral projection nonsense it's so much cooler if Luke is actually there and we and there's precedent for right you could actually build that in because an empire you recall there's a point where Han Solo is invited by Lando to dine with Darth Vader and he takes out his blaster and he shoots star fader and so our favorite goes like this and stops the blaster you remember this so Luke is significantly more powerful than Darth how much more powerful well we would find out if they were actually there and he stopped a bunch of atat barrage right that would be amazing that's true kylo does do that in force awakens kylo does stop a blaster in force awakens that's correct he stops it in the air right then he stopped so kylo can do it but Luke has to be a hologram why why why okay finally this is the biggest problem kylo should have sided with Rey okay if you're gonna do something new you cannot just read you the original trilogy by having kylo be Darth Vader he's just like Anakin he was conflicted and now he's bad and Rey is always good and you can't do that they were building up for this too right like there's a point where Luke explicitly says that Rey does not resist the dark side maybe there's a point where he says that anything okay well maybe the dark side and the light side are actually one force right there's this theory and in the Star Wars universe and then there's that great moment where kylo and and Rey team up and you think this is changing the entire nature of the Star Wars universe right you've never seen this before the only team up you've ever seen is when Darth Vader makes a final decision right before he dies to toss the Emperor down the mineshaft that's the only time you've seen this in Star Wars universe and it's super cool right when I was in the theater it's packed theater on Saturday night and the audience burst into applause all right the audience started applauding everyone was blown away by that scene right it's a great scene all the way up to and including the whole thing where where ray tosses him the lightsaber he goes doom and activates it right through the guy's face right that and the whole scene is great and then you immediately blow it then you immediately blow it because there's no real motivation for kylo to say let the transports all be wiped out still there's no motivation there who cares five seconds before this he refused to fire on his mother five seconds right he's not the one who blew princess lay out into space he refused to do it so why does he want to kill her now now he wants to kill it doesn't make any sense so that's all the criticism here's what's right with the film number one it is better than the force awakens okay the force awakens for me was was just a disaster all the way through the reason being that again they took han Solo and made him uncool Luke doesn't end up on coolness in this thing he Luke is cool I just think that his death is a little wasted second the kylo Ren connection really works this was something I didn't expect going into the film I thought a kylo hey ray but the kylo Ren connection they actually have some chemistry on-screen and every scene where they're basically skyping in to each other all those scenes really work and the scene in the throne room really works the scene where they're working together that's the coolest part and that's why you don't want it to end and that's why when it does end you're annoyed because they just went back - same old same old okay that lightsaber battle also works right that lightsaber battle is one that really that scene is one of the best scenes in all of Star Wars Canada right that one scene I'm not saying the movie I'm saying that one scene is one of the best things in all of Star Wars canon where where kylo turns and suddenly he and Ray are on the same side it's really cathartic and it's really cool and finally the final thing that works is Luke's final fade-out works just because to throwback he gets he actually gets a death that I guess is is deserving a lot better than Han right Han just gets stabbed through the belly and thrown down another one of these incessant mine shafts that seemed to be everywhere in Star Wars universe but Luke actually gets to do the final Tatooine two sons right gazing off into the distance thing and that works and it's emotionally resonant I just wish you won't dad because I think that wasted deaf they should have ended the film probably after the Kyllo racing and they should have made the entire final part of that movie the third movie right that's that's probably what they should have done okay so is it worth seeing well if you've watched this far you've already seen it because you've heard all the spoilers but my biggest problem now is that I actually think this is the end of the Star Wars universe I think this is actually where it's I think that this is the end of where Star Wars can go because now all the old characters are dead we've reached the end of the Skywalker family essentially like Ben's Solo is the thing I guess but kylo is his own sort of character and they're gonna kill kylo in the next film for sure so why would I show up to watch a movie without Luke Leia is dead right in real life Carrie Fisher is dead they Han is dead what what are they are they gonna go from here that's not just gonna be more typical light side versus dark side stuff they were on the verge of doing something so great this is what annoys me they were so close to doing something unprecedented right let's say that Rey actually that it kylo says you know what you're right he calls off the attack and he says to Rey we're gonna rule the galaxy together and that's the end of the film and you don't know what's gonna happen how's Leia gonna respond to this how Luke's gonna respond to this especially since kylo as you recall just killed Han right wouldn't they like where would it go it sets up all these possibilities instead we're thrust back into sort of this binary universe where okay guess Poe Dameron is gonna take over for Carrie Fisher is the head of thee as the head of the the rebellion and and Rey is gonna be the new Luke and kylo is gonna be the new Darth and yeah so I guess this sort of ends the Canon but it did have some moments it did have some okay so there is my full take I think that's pretty fulsome take on Star Wars and if you have thoughts on that you're always free to email me or tweet me and tell me that I am wrong
