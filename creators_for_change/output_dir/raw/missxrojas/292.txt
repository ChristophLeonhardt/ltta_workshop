00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
hey guys so it's 9am it's like march and

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,549
it's snowing my feelings towards this

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,099
are generally quite negative everything

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,210
else in this video is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,309
positive because this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> March going</font>

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,540
up video I realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,620
for every but that's probably because

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">stauber is so short and little the first</font>

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,710
thing I wanted to talk about as a

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,510
hologram for the king by<font color="#E5E5E5"> dave eggers i</font>

11
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,949
mentioned this a few videos ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,600
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i was reading it i have</font>

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally finished it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dave eggers has</font>

14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,810
written and released quite a few books

15
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,880
since his magnum opus<font color="#CCCCCC"> a heartbreaking</font>

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,980
work of staggering genius but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

17
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,779
the first one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that really gets</font>

18
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,059
back to that level of writing and also

19
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is effective and sharp and interesting</font>

20
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">and pulls you through out the narrative</font>

21
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,000
Alan clay is a businessman in Saudi

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,280
Arabia in this area called King Abdullah

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,350
economic city which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is supposed to be</font>

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,030
this area of great growth and

25
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,590
development especially because it's the

26
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,899
pet project of King Abdullah and he is

27
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,820
pitching for his company to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> charge</font>

28
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,149
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT and connectivity in this</font>

29
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,399
new city he gets there however and turns

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,930
off the scheduled appointment with the

31
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,370
other bright young things that are in

32
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,829
his company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he finds out that the</font>

33
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,989
king is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and the King has not</font>

34
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,090
been there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 18 months so is there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

35
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,770
point in him waiting around I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

36
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,330
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything else to get out of the</font>

37
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,970
experience who knows in many ways

38
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">holograph the king is from always</font>

39
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,549
cliched ideas of a man it's starting to

40
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,280
get old starting to age in this new very

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,770
global economy convinced that he's dying

42
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,900
because he found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of lump on his</font>

43
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,400
neck and he assumes it's a tumor

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,409
attached to his spine and dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

45
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,820
messy divorce and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with his</font>

46
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship to his daughter but it's</font>

47
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that those things are delivered</font>

48
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,500
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book and the way the story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

49
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,030
together but it's so populated with all

50
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,530
these characters some of them resident

51
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,329
to Saudi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arabia and some of them not and</font>

52
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,740
you see their opinions on the supposedly

53
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,840
grown city and you see the facade of

54
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,149
Wealth's next to the reality of the work

55
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,220
is going into it and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

56
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">and properly gave myself time to read it</font>

57
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">I read it in the space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know a few</font>

58
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours I love say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave Eggers has</font>

59
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,590
returned things and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found them a</font>

60
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,030
little bit disappointing but this is the

61
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,920
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I didn't find disappointing</font>

62
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,049
care of all his other work so hooray the

63
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,219
second thing is ever since<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

64
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,110
iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been using one of those and</font>

65
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,750
like 18 cases from Griffin it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

66
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,038
one that belonged<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my dad so it was</font>

67
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,899
nice to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on me all the time it</font>

68
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,760
was really bulky and it also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,240
like a couple

70
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,040
the screen as well it meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when I</font>

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
dropped it it was incredibly secure but

72
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,490
also meant that I was taking all my

73
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,110
stuff at once as well so it's like hey

74
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,640
I'll just take my phone out at all my

75
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,140
credit cards would be there and stuff so

76
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,850
it wasn't necessarily the safest option

77
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,520
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally when it got myself a new case</font>

78
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,020
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was so cute i sorted</font>

79
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,700
oliver bonas and it appeals to my

80
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,860
narcissism because this is an R and I

81
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,620
rosianna and this is a rocket and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

82
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,080
space that's my reasoning it's made<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,430
British company called magpie and

84
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,680
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a website as well I think as</font>

85
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,750
I say I bought it from oliver bonas and

86
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,610
it's also just nice being able to see my

87
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,140
full screen again although I'm starting

88
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,630
to get worried about cracking my screen

89
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,910
which hasn't really been a fair before

90
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,190
but now at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be extra conscious</font>

91
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,790
about you know dropping this thing or

92
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">not another big thing that's going up</font>

93
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,900
that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got my hands on is what skis</font>
