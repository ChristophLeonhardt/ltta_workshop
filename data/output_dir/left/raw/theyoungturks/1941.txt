1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:04,250
>>MARIAH CAREY HAS OPENED UP
ABOUT A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,799
THAT SHE HAD BEEN SILENT ABOUT
SINCE 2001.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,200
BACK IN 2001 SHE WAS

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,140
DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER,
AND SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS IN

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,789
COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT IT AND
DIDN'T SEEK HELP, HOWEVER

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,960
RECENTLY SHE DID SEEK HELP AND
IS IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE, AND I

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,080
COMMEND HER FOR OPENING UP ABOUT
THIS BECAUSE IT HELPS TO DO AWAY

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,550
WITH THE STIGMA RELATED TO
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,560
HOPEFULLY IT LIBERATES OTHER
PEOPLE WHO ARE COPING WITH THE

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,840
SAME THING.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
SHE SAYS --

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
>>

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:52,630
>>ACCORDING TO PEOPLE --

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,630
>>

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:01:04,569
>>SO I READ INTO THE CONDITION
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THERE ARE

16
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,940
ALL SORTS OF STEREOTYPES ABOUT
BIPOLAR DISORDER IN THE MEDIA

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,860
AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT
IS.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,140
THERE ARE THESE BOUTS OF

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,480
SEVERE DEPRESSION AND THEN WHEN
IT COMES TO THAT HYPOMANIA WHAT

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,620
HAPPENS IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS
CONDITION CAN'T SLEEP, THEIR

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,520
MIND IS WIRED, THEY ALWAYS FEEL
GUILTY BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,660
THEY AREN'T DOING ENOUGH FOR
THEIR CAREERS, IN FACT SHE

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,790
TOUCHES ON THAT A LITTLE BIT --

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,790
>>

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:45,370
>>SHE'S GOT TWO KIDS, AND IT'S
HARD ON THE PEOPLE AROUND PEOPLE

26
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,440
WITH BIPOLAR IF THEY AREN'T
TREATED, SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,280
RECOGNIZE IT, AND IT'S GREAT,
BUT IT WILL BE A CONSTANT

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,390
STRUGGLE.

29
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,010
MEDICATION, THERAPY,
IT'S NOT EASY, SO I AGREE WITH

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,710
YOU TOTALLY, THAT TALKING ABOUT
IT, REACHING OUT, BEING HONEST

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,690
ABOUT IT, AGAIN, REMOVING THE
STIGMA.

32
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,790
IT IS FIXABLE BUT YOU

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,260
HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUS ACTION, AS
SHE SAID IT'S A PROCESS AND

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:00:00,000
AN ARDUOUS ONE, SO GOD BLESS HER
FOR TALKING ABOUT IT.
