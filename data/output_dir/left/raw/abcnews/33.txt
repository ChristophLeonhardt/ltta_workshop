I CAN SEE AT LEAST FOUR CARS AND

94
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,901
DIFFERENT SIZES LIKE A MINI VAN,

95
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,870

THERE ARE CRANES ON THE OTHER 

104
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:17,682
SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.

105
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:19,017
I TALKED TO SOME OF THE 

106

00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,522
ANYTHING LEADING UP TO IT.

109
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,690
IT JUST FELL.

110
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,759

THIS IS A BUSY ROAD, 8th STREET 

118
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,841

>> YES, I LIVE AT 109 AND IT 

135
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,912
FELL AS IF THERE WAS AN 

136
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:20,612
EARTHQUAKE.

137
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,782
ME AND MY ROOMMATE JUMPED UP AND

138
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,983
LOOKED OUTSIDE.

139
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:25,316
S

140
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,453
SLNS I LOOKED OUTSIDE I SAW DUST

141
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,588
FLYING AND KNEW THE BRIDGE HAD 

142
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:29,855
COLLAPSED.

143
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,657
THERE WAS ONE CAR ABLE TO GET --

144
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,592
I GUESS THEY JUST HAD MISSED THE

145
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,561
BRIDGE AND THE BACK END OF THE 

146
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:37,429
CAR WAS SMASHED AND THE SCREAMS 

147
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,598
COMING FROM THE CAR WAS 

148
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,732
TERRIFYING.

149
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,534
I WATCHED EVERY ONE STARTED 

150
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,870
SPRINTING TOWARDS THE SCENE AND 

151
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,138
IT WAS SO SCARY BECAUSE IT 

152
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:46,771
HAPPENED SO FAST. 

153
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,707

00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:48,974
SECONDS. 

155
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,375
>> A MATTER OF SECONDS. 

156
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:54,579

157
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,815
WE'RE NOW SEEING RESCUE WORKERS 

158
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,617
ON TOP OF THE BRIDGE.

159
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,285
DID YOU SEE ANYONE ON THE BRIDGE

160
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,254
OR WAS ALL OF THE DANGER 

161
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,255
UNDERNEATH AS IT COLLAPSED?

162
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,625
>> NO, THERE WAS WORKERS ON THE 

163
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:06,892
BRIDGE.

164
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,426
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO DIG 

165
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,496
PEOPLE OUT FROM UNDER THE 

166
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:10,729
BRIDGE.

167
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,931
I WATCHED THEM DIG A HOLE AND 

168
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,199

169
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,733
I WATCHED PEOPLE -- TWO PEOPLE 

170
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,303
HAD TO HAVE CPR PERFORMED ON 

171
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,070
THEM AND THERE'S STILL LIKE 

172
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,906
THREE CARS COMPLETELY SMASHED 

173
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:22,741
UNDER THE BRIDGE THAT THEY 

174
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,342
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO. 

175
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,777
>> THREE CARS THEY WEREN'T ABLE 

176
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:26,545
TO GET TO.

177
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,444
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT 

178
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,847
YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY 

179
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,818
INJURED THERE MIGHT BE?

180
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,386
>> I KNOW THAT FOR SURE THERE 

181
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,290
HAS TO BE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE 

182
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,624
DEAD.

183
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,657
ONLY BECAUSE THAT IS HOW MANY 

184
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,726
CARS WERE UNDER THERE, THERE'S 

185
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,262
NO WAY ANYONE COULD SURVIVE 

186
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:43,962
THAT.

187
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,264
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE -- I KNOW

00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,965
I WATCHED HELICOPTERS BE FLOWN 

189
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:47,131
IN.

190
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,734
THERE WAS A FEW PEOPLE FLOWN 

191
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:48,900
OUT.

192
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,402
I DON'T KNOW.

193
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,107
>> AND YOU SAY IT FELT LIKE AN 

194
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:55,407
EARTHQUAKE.

195
00:17:55,407 --> 00:18:01,346
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU TO THE BRIDGE?

196
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,714
>> I'M ON THE 15th FLOOR.

197
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,218
I LIVE ON THE 15th FLOOR OF THIS

198
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:06,718
APARTMENT COMPLEX.

199
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,753
SO THAT -- I WAS PRETTY FAR UP 

200
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,822
AND BASICALLY RIGHT OVER THE 

201
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:11,155
INTERSECTION. 

202
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,691
>> AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT

203
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,759
HAPPENED OR NO?

204
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,995
>> NO, I COULD ONLY THINK THAT 

205
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,931
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A 

206
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,865
MISCALCULATION OF SOME SORT, A 

207
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,301
FATAL ONE AT THAT. 

208
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,169
>> THANK YOU FOR QUICKLY CALLING

209
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,004
IN TO US AND SHARING YOUR STORY.

210
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:26,938
WE APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION 

211
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,808
YOU'RE ABLE TO GIVE US.

212
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,109
WE HEARD FROM RICK SCOTT THE 

213
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,044
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SAYS HE'S 

214
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,679
SPOKEN WITH THE MIAMI-DADE 

215
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,981
POLICE CHIEF ABOUT THIS 

216
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:36,748
COLLAPSE.

217
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,084
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL

218
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,185
THROUGH THE DAY.

219
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:48,059
WHAT KIND OF PRESENCE ARE YOU 

220
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,428
SEEING THERE ON THE O SCENE?

221
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:50,995
>> GEORGE, YOU NAME IT IT'S 

222
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:51,196
HERE.

223
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:51,829
WE HAVE MIAMI-DADE FIRE RESCUE 

224
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,230
AND LOCAL POLICE.

225
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,931
30 TO 40 ACTIVE VEHICLES RIGHT 

226
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,765
WHERE I'M AT.

227
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,533
THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT A LOT OF 

228
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,269
ACTIVITY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT

229
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,536
WERE -- THE PEOPLE THAT WERE 

230
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,205
TRAPPED UNDER THE CAR -- THE 

231
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,873
CARS ARE STILL UNDER THE BRIDGE.

232
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:03,241
THERE WAS NO ONE WALKING REALLY 

233
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,376
OVER BECAUSE IT WASN'T OPEN TO 

234
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,344
THE PUBLIC YET.

235
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,512
SO ALL OF THE ACTIVITY NOW IS 

236
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:08,847
FOCUSED ON AS THE WOMAN WAS 

237
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,215
SAYING ON THOSE CARS -- I CAN 

238
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,716
STILL SEE THEM, THEY ARE 

239
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,385
PANCAKED UNDER THIS BRIDGE.

240
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,653
AND PRIMARILY, IF YOU'RE LOOKING

241
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,354
AT THIS BRIDGE, THE NORTH 

242
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,390
SECTION OF IT IS WHERE IT 

243
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,891
APPEARS MOST OF THE COLLAPSE 

244
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,660
BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF CRUMBLED.

245
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,827
THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF IT IS 

246
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,030
ALL IN ONE PIECE LEANING DOWN 

247
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,598
ONTO THE ROAD.

248
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,133
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL IF 

249
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,801
THERE WAS A SUPPORT BEAM IN THE 

250
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,937
MIDDLE HOLDING THIS UP.

251
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,138
IT'S A VERY WIDE ROAD AND 

252
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:37,242
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SPACE SPORE

253
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,177
A SUPPORT BEAM IF THERE WAS ONE 

254
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:39,377
THERE.

255
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,145
THAT WHOLE SECTION FROM THE 

256
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,814
MIDDLE OF THE ROADS TOWARDS THE 

257
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,816
NORTH END IS GONE.

258
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,150
IT'S ALL DOWN.

259
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,386
I'M SEEING THIS LARGE PANEL 

260
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,787
TRUCK AND IT'S BEEN COMPRESSED 

261
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,322
DOWN TO MAYBE 2 OR 3 FEET.

262
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,324
IF YOU KNOW WHAT SIZE A PANEL 

263
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,393
TRUCK IS, IT'S JUST SMASHED.

264
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,664
>> THAT CAME DOWN WITH SUCH 

265
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,498
POWER.

266
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,865
>> EXTREME POWER AND CAME DOWN 

267
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:01,132
QUICKLY.

268
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,967
THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO SAID IT 

269
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,669
WAS INSTANTOUS AND IT WAS LOUD 

270
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,505
AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD

271
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,406
DO.

272
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,006
IT WAS PANDEMONIUM THEY ARE 

273
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,641
TELLING ME AND THEY RAN AS 

274
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,243
QUICKLY AS THEY COULD TO TRY AND

275
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,413
HELP BUT THE PEOPLE PINNED UNDER

276
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,780
IN THEIR CACARS, THERE WAS NO W 

277
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,982
TO GET TO THEM. 

278
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,383
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN.

279
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,150
