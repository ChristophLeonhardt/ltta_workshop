there's no propaganda quite like military propaganda psychological operations the term is psyops serious stuff aside from near and limited money you also don't have to deal with all those annoying ethical restrictions I just assumed it was news gathering I've been seeing the process and worked in the process I then realized this is a big project so we would do the news items that would go out on the news and go out on various channels locally and we were to make it its best we could look as if it was made locally Bell Pottinger specialized in military-grade propaganda the British PR firm was active in Iraq for years answering to the US commander there they did crazy stuff faked local news reports smeared Iran put together al Qaeda propaganda videos planted them in people's homes and tracked who viewed them I was asked by my boss we need to make this style of video and we've got to use al Qaeda's footage and all their propaganda to do it and we're gonna track it via Google Analytics good times last year bel Pottinger lost its license after it emerged that it likely stoked racial tensions in South Africa as part of its work their thing with having morals is once you use them it's difficult to pick them up again but I digress guess what bel pottinger's former boss is up to the biggest diplomatic crisis in the Middle East since the first Gulf War a growing diplomatic crisis of Qatar seems to be in crisis as more Middle Eastern countries severed diplomatic ties with Doha Saudi Arabia Bahrain Egypt and the UAE have all cut diplomatic ties with Qatar you know the whole Qatar Saudi Arabia schism where the two US allies almost came to blows yeah that was helped by Charles Andrea the man who oversaw bail pottinger's operations in Iraq propagandist extraordinaire financial and logistical support for terrorists and terrorism groups like Hamas the Taliban and al-qaeda who operate freely out of Doha and use business and financial institutions to support radical Islam and global jihad mr. Andrea was paid handsomely by a dubai-based company to smear cata tyre to terrorists to Iran tell everyone how bad and dirty it is using the Iraqi formula anywhere where Sunni radical Islamism is operational significant operation going we find this documentary it really isn't became available on Netflix YouTube it presumed to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon former CIA director David Petraeus ex Defense Secretary Leon Panetta just to make it clear foreign money gulf arab money used to make a fake propaganda film by professionals and then shown to millions shown to some of america's most influential figures to promote an international conflict on fake grounds this is psy ops the big-time league of propaganda marat ganz DFO we have contacted the firm Andrea & Associates which produced the film as well as the debye based company office communications for comment so far no response the film was released at a time when Gulf states cut diplomatic trade and transport ties with Qatar accusing and of supporting terrorism something Doha has repeatedly denied back then the US president sided with the majority of our obtain Qatar had a history of funding terror at a very high level Saudi Arabia took the lead in the isolation campaign the kingdom's foreign minister is now warning the Qatari government that it could collapse if it doesn't pay for Washington's military presence in Syria Qatar should finance the US military's presence in Syria and send its own military forces there before the u.s. president lifts American protection for Qatar if the u.s. is to withdraw its protection represented by its military base in Qatar then the regime there will fall within less than a week yeah just some background to this the Saudi foreign minister was referring to the presence of over 11,000 US troops in Qatar he made the remarks after Donald Trump called from money and ground support in Syria from his wealthy allies in the Middle East however security analyst and former British Army officer Charles zubich believes Rianne should itself be worried over its friendship with Washington Arabia is using this issue as a stick to beat Qatar and of course Qatar has used its considerable wealth to also attack for example in propaganda terms Saudi Arabia both countries have been uncomfortable allies for some time certainly they've both been backing the Syrian rebellion of course in this particular instance Saudi Arabia knows that Qatar is not in a position to physically provide troops on the ground simply because its Armed Forces are so small but of course they would like to see Qatar's finances further drained it's interesting Donald Trump's remarks himself where he said that without us in other words without the Americans those countries would fall within hours or weeks or something like this he said this is a truce that is very rarely spoken publicly and they want you to deflect attention onto one another
