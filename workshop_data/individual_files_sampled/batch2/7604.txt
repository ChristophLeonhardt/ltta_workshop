while Scott Pruett has moved on they do need an acting administrator of the EPA and they've got one in Andrew wheeler as Donald Trump announced we now have Andrew wheeler that is the name that you heart heard far less than Scott Pruett for understandable reasons and you might think while Scott Pruitt's a disaster so huzzah we've got an injury wheeler no Andrew wheeler is a disaster and so I want to give you at least a top-level riah list of reasons why his most recent job before moving the EPA was as an energy lobbyist his biggest clients included Murray energy corporation the largest coal mining company in America Robert Murray presented a vice will when he was working under Robert Murray he presented Vice President Mike Pence with a pro coal action plan that called for doing away with the clean power plan withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement eliminating federal tax credits for renewable energy and having the EPA's work force half of those employees we don't need them we don't want him now a lot of that you got under Scott Pruett but if you'd had Andrew wheeler instead you would have had a lot of the same results maybe not as many scandals he serves to this day as the vice president of the Washington coal Club a powerful yet little-known Federation of more than 300 coal producers lawmakers business leaders and policy experts he worked as a legislative aide to Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe a man who regularly refers to the science of climate change is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people and he told one radio interviewer that educating schoolchildren on the basics of climate science was tantamount to brainwashing he's also the snowball guy look that up that was a nice little bit of a recent Senate history and when we lose nomination was announced last year in off a few civilly praised the decision saying that quote there is no one more qualified than Andrew to help Scott Pruett restore EPA to its proper size and scope which you could see on a microscope if you were capable of using one which neither Pruett nor wheeler were got now yeah no one there's there's no one can do it alone Scott rule wasn't there by himself in fact everyone that either I mean not even against his policies people that point out the scandals he did or I'll sit or who's talking about me now and and people he had done wrong in a being out he and there's there's a there's a explicit term for this he screwed over their chances in their next jobs you know so he since out soon about the notification say this person left and now that they squealed on me and the horrible things I've been doing scandalized as the head of the EPA don't hire them anywhere else and any kind of business associated with what I can influence he's a bad guy he's just a bad guy from the beginning so if we was working under him as deputy of the EPA why would he be the guy who's working under him going oh this is horrible another empowerment it changed things yes it's not the way it's gonna work I mean I hope no one assumed that that's what it was gonna work yeah I we've tried very hard over the past year especially so far this calendar year to document as many of these environmental regulation roll backs as possible understanding by the way that it's not a sexy topic a lot of people tune out for it those videos inevitably get far fewer views than other sexier inside the beltway topics and stuff like that but they are in a very real sense the most important policy is being decided in DC we'll continue to do that and we will need to because wheeler is going to be an absolute disaster if he eventually becomes the actual head of the APA and while he's serving as its acting head as well two easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
