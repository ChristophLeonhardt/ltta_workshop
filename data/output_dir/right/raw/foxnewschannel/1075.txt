1
00:00:01,489 --> 00:00:02,123
>> Shepard: ON THE RUSSIA

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:03,325
PART OF THIS, REACTION IS IN

3
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:05,794
AND IT'S PRETTY UNIFORMED.

4
00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:06,761
CHUCK SCHUMER ONE WHO HAS

5
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:08,363
GIVEN A QUOTE TODAY, SAYS

6
00:00:08,363 --> 00:00:09,631
THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT FOR

7
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,333
INVITING RUSSIA BACK TO THE

8
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,701
G-7 JUST AFTER THEY MEDDLED

9
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,602
IN THE ELECTION TO SUPPORT

10
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:14,736
HIS CAMPAIGN WILL LEAVE

11
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:16,104
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH

12
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:17,138
SERIOUS QUESTIONS AND

13
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:17,606
SUSPICIONS.

14
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:18,573
AGAIN, THAT FROM CHUCK

15
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:18,907
SCHUMER.

16
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:21,243
AND THEN FROM THE REPUBLICAN

17
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,677
BEN SASSE, THIS IS WEAK.

18
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:24,279
PUTIN IS NOT OUR FRIEND.

19
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,947
HE IS NOT THE PRESIDENT'S

20
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:26,248
BUDDY.

21
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,583
HE IS A THUG, USING SOVIET

22
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,318
STYLE AGGRESSION TO WAGE A

23
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,720
SHADOW WAR AGAINST AMERICA

24
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,921
AND OUR LEADERS SHOULD ACT

25
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:33,888
LIKE IT.

26
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,657
DOES THE PRESIDENT -- IS HE

27
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:37,626
AWARE OF THESE MATTERS?

28
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:39,561
>> I THINK HE IS.

29
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,063
THE PRESIDENT FEELS LIKE

30
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,698
WHENEVER YOU HAVE AN

31
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:44,399
ADVERSARY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

32
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,133
TALK TO THEM.

33
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,401
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE

34
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,736
WAS GETTING AT THIS MORNING.

35
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:49,137
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY WILL

36
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,872
THERE BE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

37
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:52,140
WHO DISAGREE WITH THIS, BUT

38
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,775
ALSO OUR ALLIES AROUND THE

39
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:54,075
WORLD.

40
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,945
AND THEY WILL SAY THAT

41
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:58,647
BASICALLY WE'RE PROBABLY

42
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:00,215
REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR IF WE

43
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:02,350
ALLOW RUSSIA BACK INTO THE

44
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,686
G-7, WHAT USED TO BE THE G-8

45
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,920
WITHOUT HAVING THEM CHANGE

46
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,689
THEIR BEHAVIOR.

47
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:08,356
>> Shepard: SINCE THE COLD

48
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:09,324
WAR, WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN

49
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:11,192
SUCH A STANCE AS REGARDED TO

50
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:13,028
RUSSIA, HAVE WE?

51
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:14,029
>> NO.

52
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:16,398
THIS IS COMPLETELY NEW.

53
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:18,700
YOU KNOW, WE KICKED RUSSIA

54
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,603
OUT OF THE G-8 IN 2014.

55
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:22,671
AND THERE HAS JUST BEEN THIS

56
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,272
VIEW THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY

57
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:25,206
HAVEN'T CHANGED WHAT THEY

58
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:27,342
WERE DOING IN UKRAINE.

59
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:28,243
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY

60
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:29,177
AGGRESSIVE IN SYRIA.

61
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:30,478
YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS

62
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,213
POISONING CASE IN GREAT

63
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:32,781
BRITAIN.

64
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,316
SO, YOU KNOW, THE ALLIES

65
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:35,583
WOULD SAY WHY WOULD YOU

66
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,152
ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK INTO

67
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:39,087
THIS GROUP WHEN THEY CLEARLY

68
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:40,288
HAVE BEEN DISRUPTIVE AROUND

69
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:41,389
THE WORLD.

70
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,059
>> Shepard: THEY ARE WIDELY

71
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,360
BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR

72
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,594
SHOOTING DOWN COMMERCIAL

73
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:48,163
AIRLINER THAT LEFT 298

74
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:49,931
PEOPLE DEAD THERE IS A BIT

75
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:51,066
OF DISCONNECT THERE.

76
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,900
THE BIGGER PICTURE CONCERN

77
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,034
IS THAT THE RUSSIANS AREN'T

78
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,369
COMING BACK TO THE G-7.

79
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,937
THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY

80
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:57,739
DON'T WANTING TO.

81
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,140
THE BIGGER PICTURE IS UNITED

82
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,009
STATES FINDS ITSELF

83
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,010
ISOLATED.

84
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,777
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING ONE

85
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:03,511
AGAINST SIX AT THIS

86
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:03,912
CONFERENCE.

87
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:04,946
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

88
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:05,313
RELATIONS?

89
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:06,481
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

90
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,182
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING?

91
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,983
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE

92
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:09,951
PRESIDENT AND HIS ALLIES

93
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,120
HAVE SAID THAT AMERICA FIRST

94
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,888
DOESN'T MEAN AMERICA ALONE.

95
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,923
BUT THAT THEORY IS GOING TO

96
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:16,858
BE TESTED AT THIS SUMMIT.

97
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,660
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD

98
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,129
HAVE, YOU KNOW, AS KEVIN

99
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,564
MENTIONED, A COMMUNIQUE COME

100
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:24,299
DOWN THAT'S ONLY SIGNED BY

101
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,834
SIX OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES,

102
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:26,968
NOT BY THE UNITED STATES.

103
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:27,635
>> Shepard: WHO CARES?

104
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,238
>> RIGHT.

105
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:30,638
EXACTLY.

106
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:31,439
>> Shepard: I MEAN, WHO WILL

107
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,440
CARE ABOUT THAT?

108
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,780
WHAT DOES THAT CHANGE?

109
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,981
THE CONCERN IS DOWN THE LINE

110
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,049
WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS ARE

111
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:42,083
YOUR ALLIES GOING TO BE WITH

112
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:42,484
YOU OR NOT?

113
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:43,551
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

114
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:44,886
HERE IN THE STATES CONCERNED

115
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,154
ABOUT WHEN YOU ISOLATE

116
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:47,155
YOURSELF, WHEN YOU, YOU

117
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:49,657
KNOW, SLAP ON TARIFFS ON

118
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:51,426
ALLIES UNDER THE GUISE OF

119
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:53,194
NATIONAL SECURITY, THAT WHEN

120
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:54,295
YOU NEED HELP IN A CRISIS

121
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:56,364
DOWN THE ROAD, THOSE ALLIES

122
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:57,198
MAY NOT SUPPORT YOU.

123
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,366
>> WHO IS GOING TO THE

124
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,401
PRESIDENT TO ASK HIM TO

125
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,935
CHANGE HIS WAYS ON THIS

126
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,470
MATTER?

127
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,804
ANYBODY?

128
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:04,973
>> WELL, HAVE YOU SOME

129
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,408
REPUBLICANS ARE CERTAINLY

130
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,009
CONCERNED WITH THIS.

131
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,612
YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE IS

132
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:11,880
SOME ADVISORS WHO WOULD

133
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,748
PRIVATELY NOT LIKE, YOU

134
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,984
KNOW, THIS IDEA OF ALLOWING

135
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:18,420
RUSSIA BACK INTO THE G-7,

136
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,688
THE G-8.

137
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:21,322
>> Shepard: PRIVATELY, NO

138
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:23,091
ONE WANTS THEM BACK IN

139
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,759
EXCEPT MAYBE DANA

140
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,660
ROHRABACHER AND IT DOESN'T

141
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,561
MATTER WHAT HE THINKS.

142
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,061
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

143
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:27,695
THAT'S RIGHT.

144
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,397
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE -- THE

145
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:30,832
QUESTION IS, I MEAN, I THINK

146
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:32,934
THE PRESIDENT SEES THIS AS

147
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,903
AN IMPORTANT VENUE TO HAVE

148
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,438
AN OPEN DISCUSSION TO HAVE

149
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:37,539
ALL THE IMPORTANT COUNTRIES

150
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,106
AT THE TABLE.

151
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,707
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE

152
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:40,408
POINT HE WAS MAKING.

153
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:41,309
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

154
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,377
PEOPLE WHO JUST SAY THAT,

155
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:43,812
YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT THERE

156
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:44,078
YET.

157
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:46,114
WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW RUSSIA

158
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:46,648
IN.

159
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:47,248
>> Shepard: INDIA HAS A

160
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:47,816
BIGGER ECONOMY.

161
00:03:47,816 --> 00:00:00,000
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE INDIA
