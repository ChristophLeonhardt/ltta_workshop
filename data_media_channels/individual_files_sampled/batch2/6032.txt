during Donald Trump's meeting with evangelical leaders he talked about how Democrats would create a violent situation in America should they take hold or control of Congress after the midterm elections now that was a fascinating things to say a thing to say considering the fact that Donald Trump himself has advocated for violence on multiple occasions and we have evidence of that which we'll show you in just a minute but Tony Perkins who is one of trumps religious followers and supporters went on CNN to further buttress Trump's ridiculous point take a look how did you take the president's comments about a warning that things were turned violent if Republicans we're not successful this was not a time to be complacent I think that was the message that was received by those in the room that look don't think that this is just going to continue if there is a turnover in the house or the the elections which they all have consequences we know that this stuff could end and it could be overturned very quickly we don't think it's just going to trickle out because we see the the energy on the other side I think he did make reference to an Tifa which is in many ways become the face of the left now I don't I don't think anybody in the room suggested that there was going to be right but I'm gonna stop you for a second there it's a reach to say that an Tifa is now the face of the left I think that would be a bit of a stretch I think well I don't know when you talk about violence the violence is on the left you see an Tifa that are that they're right you don't see evangelicals out there rioting all right the far right and what we have seen in Charlottesville in other places there is a lot of I can tell you this the evangelicals do not embrace them or want anything to do with them and and that is the base of the president I in terms of violence in terms of silencing those who want to engage in the political process we denounce that we believe everybody in America should have a right to participate in our process and when you begin to suppress people and their views that's when you have violence and I think you see that more on the left you see that violence coming forth on the left let me be very clear we don't believe that there is any room for in our Republic when it comes to shaping the future of our country okay so he says that the violence is mostly coming from the left even though that hateful white supremacist rally in Charlottesville Virginia led to the death of a counter protester okay so it was the racists who decided one of the racists at least who decided would be a good idea to run people over killing Heather hire but okay so the the left is is the violent one or the violent ones and let's not forget look auntie fuh I haven't seen a political leader on the Left embrace an Tifa and say this is the face of the left in fact if anything I've seen progressive politicians come out and say over and over again including Bernie Sanders that they condemn violence of any type now on the other hand you have Donald Trump who has a pretty bad record when it comes to advocating for violence don't believe me take a look if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato knock the crap out of avoid you seriously okay just knock the hell I promise you I will pay for the legal fees I promise the guards are very gentle with him he's walking out like the big high fives smiling laughing like to punch him in the face I'll tell you yeah get him out try not to hurt him if you do I'll defend you in court don't worry about it Hillary wants to abolish essentially abolish the Second Amendment by the way and if she gets to pick if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks although the second amendment people maybe there is I don't know Wow so uh Tony Perkins said when you talk about violence the violence is on the Left mmm ooh I wonder where the violence is actually by the way so you got the far left of the far right I think it's fair to call nt4 far left and whether you were in favor of that or not is a different question and and being in favor of them does not mean that you're in favor of the one or two people who might have committed a violent act throughout the country you could be in favor of their policies and their positions etc by and not have just one or two people represent the whole group okay so by the way do you know what ante foe stands for anti-fascist that's the far left the far right are the fascists and they were in Charlottesville and they chanted the Jews will not replace us literal fascists that is why antiva is called anti-fascists but we are told that the violence is on the left not from the fascists but from the anti-fascist and finally they just don't care about logic let alone facts so tony Perkins said in that clip we showed you when you begin to suppress people in their views that's when you have violence but you told me that the left was violent so are you now admitting that you were suppressing the views of the left or are you just throwing that talking points okay and it doesn't matter and you they don't have to be logically connected because then you know that your audience is a bunch of idiots okay oh you've Angelico's yeah the violence is on the left and you know if you suppress people there will be violence so you wait who was the violent ones in other words he's justifying the violence on the right by saying hey you're suppressing our views you're suppressing our views yeah so in other words yes you know that the violence is on the right of course you know that and finally one thing that was not in that Trump clip was he said in 2016 that if he loses that there might be riots in the streets encouraging people to commit violence if he loses exactly then he turns around and says now hey if the Democrats win they might do violence why would they do violence if they win again logic is irrelevant facts are irrelevant the only thing they got is fear and hatred and then they ironically turn around and blame the left for violence hilarious too easy wasteful Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then
