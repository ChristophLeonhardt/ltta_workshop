in recent weeks Donald Trump has lost some of his close buddies he lost prominent white supremacist Steve Bannon and that's his chief strategist and he lost sebastian Gorka is deputy assistant who also has some troubling ties to white supremacy around the world and what's interesting is that in the wake of this more leaks are coming out of the White House showing that one of the reasons the White House is emptier and emptier with every passing week is actually Trump's moodiness his mood swings have gotten really bad apparently worse than ever interviews with six White House staffers and people close to the President attribute Trump's shrimp shrinking white West Wing to three factors you've got John Kelly changing up how they hire people you've got the chilling factor of five open-ended Russia investigations hanging over the White House and people don't want to sign on to a ship where they're likely to end up in jail and the president's own dark mood which has left him increasingly isolated and in the mood to hunker down not higher up and why is he in such a bad mood well because it's awful his job and he knows that that's part of it but another reason is recent public criticisms from people like Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohen who have criticized him for a number of things like his whether he speaks for American values and also his position on white supremacy itself the source close to the president described his mindset in recent weeks as the worst that's ever been and said particularly that those criticisms from his some of his top aides there cut him to the quick yeah he's a sensitive soul I have two things to say about this the first is sad the second is baby I thought you might say that yeah okay well you want a quote we're gonna feel bad for Donald Trump good luck the source in the White House says quote he feels like this is not what he signed up for and his accomplishments are being underplayed he just looks around and says what is this going to get better Oh occasionally Melania does that historically too what I love is he feels his accomplishments and then she gets out of the bed she feels as a cop he feels his accomplishments are being underplayed this is the guy who gets a folder of positive news livered to him twice a day and he still feels his accomplishments are being underplayed no one has had their ego stroked this much in in the history of the planet it's not enough for him to be fair I think the good folder guy quit one of the good folder guys quit there were two maybe the afternoon folder maybe he only gets the the morning pick-me-up of pictures of him looking strong on TV after you know perpetual vomiting but good folders one of the good folder guys think I can't do this anymore okay you gotta go yeah you can only you only cut yourself for so many weeks I guess yeah that poor sap anyway so that last quote I love because I want to analyze it he says this is he feels like this is not what he signed up for you signed up to be President where I don't know if you know this there's a lot of critics of the President I remember when President Obama was in charge for example and you're a big loud mouth critic tweeting away about every single thing he did and didn't do so inside up for this what a snowflake what a what a sad sad child I mean Truman said the buck stops here second part of the quote is his accomplishments are being underplayed I mean this is a very little question what accomplishments he hasn't gotten any major legislation passed none no major legislation to speak of at all health care didn't happen nothing has happened some executive orders I guess that's not an accomplishment if I could sign a thousand executive orders there's nothing stopping you that's not an accomplishment that's like your opinion man right and even if the extent of orders have some force of law you can't say you've got it done all you do is this to get it done hey does he sign the executive order that someone else wrote and gave to him that's right and and he looks around and says when is it gonna get better and that's the one I have the most definitive news on yeah never so this is the same thing I said about Bush in the in his second term around oh six I even wrote an article about it you know how much I love my predictions at the time all the pundits on TV we're talking about a quote-unquote narrative of a comeback and I wrote a piece saying he is not capable of a comeback his poll numbers will not bounce back up they will go continue to spiral downwards because Bush did not have the capacity the intellectual capacity or any other capacity to mount a comeback because he was not up for the job Trump is way worse I mean I could not have imagined of a person of a president more incompetent to George there you a bush and it turns out I lacked enough imagination because Trump is significantly worse so what is it gonna get better never know you will continue to spiral down you'll get into the 20s you might even get into the teens unless you resigned first you are an incompetent buffoon of the highest order I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings that you're not sign up for this yeah so I'm going to end on the same two words sad baby help us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
