JULIE SWETNICK, ARE SO

4
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:14,354
OUTLANDISH THAT WE WERE

5
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:17,056
SKEPTICAL FROM THE START.

6
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,725
THAT DOUBT SEEMS TO PRESSURE HAS

7
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,660
NUMEROUS OF STORIES FROM HER

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,361
PASTOR TRICKLE DOWN, ONE FROM

VINNECCY, THE EX-BOYFRIEND OF

11
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:27,467
SEVEN YEARS, CLAIMING SHE

12
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,969
THREATENED HIM AND HIS FAMILY.

WE ARE JOINED IN A TELEVISION

00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:37,910
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

17
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,645
TONIGHT.

18
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:39,979
RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOUR

19
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,414
MOTIVATIONS FOR COMING FORWARD

20
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,950
NOW?

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,819
>> YES, THERE HAVE BEEN

22
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:49,489
POLITICAL ISSUES.

23
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,026
I WANT TO TELL THE TRUTH.

24
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:54,894
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

25
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:55,461
CAME.

26
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,497
>> Laura: NOW, YOU CLAIM,

27
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:00,033
RICHARD, THAT MS. SWETNICK

28
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,568
THREATENED YOU AFTER YOU BROKE

29
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:03,002
UP WITH HER.

30
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:07,440
WHAT TYPES OF THREATS THREATS

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,941
ARE YOU ALLEGING?

32
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:10,476
>> SHE BASICALLY CALLED ME MANY

33
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,012
TIMES AND SAID YOU WILL NEVER,

34
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:16,116
EVER SEE YOUR UNBORN CHILD

35
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:20,687
ALIVE.

36
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,857
AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO OVER

37
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:24,524
THERE, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU

38
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:24,824
GUYS.

39
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:25,458
>> Laura: SHE SAID SHE WAS

40
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:25,959
GOING TO KILL YOU?

41
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,426
>> YES.

42
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,561
AND THAT HAS TOLD ME A LITTLE

43
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:28,929
BIT.

44
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:29,796
>> Laura: WELL, YOU TOLD

45
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:33,266
POLITICO ORIGINALLY, RICHARD,

46
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,034
THAT SHE THREATENED YOUR FAMILY

47
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,869
AND YOUR BABY.

48
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,471
>> CORRECT.

49
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:40,240
>> Laura: BUT YOU MENTALLY

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,308
UNBORN CHILD, IS THAT RIGHT?

51
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:43,977
>> I MEANT THE UNBORN CHILD.

52
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:45,011
I WAS NOT MARRIED AT THE TIME

53
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:47,481
WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

54
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,482
>> Laura: DID SHE EVER

55
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,317
DISCUSSED WITH YOU IN YOUR SEVEN

56
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:54,888
YEAR RELATIONSHIP, FROM

57
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,690
1994-2001, THE ISSUE OF

58
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,858
SEXUAL ASSAULT, OR DID SHE

59
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:58,492
MENTION EVER HAVING BEEN

60
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:01,461
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?

61
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:03,030
>> NEVER, NEVER ONCE SHE MENTION

62
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,831
THAT TO ME.

63
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,568
JUST TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING,

64
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,470
SHE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THAT AT

65
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,438
ALL.

66
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:13,607
>> Laura: DID SHE HAVE A

67
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:14,174
POLITICAL BACKGROUND?

68
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,843
WAS SHE INTERESTED IN POLITICS?

69
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:19,079
>> NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

70
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,514
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ALWAYS WANTING

71
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:24,051
TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

72
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,586
SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO IMPRESS

73
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:27,321
ME.

74
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,222
SHE WAS EXAGGERATING EVERYTHING.

75
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:35,028
IF ANYBODY KNOWS JULIE,

76
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:35,762
EVERYTHING THAT CAME OUT OF HER

77
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:37,264
MOUTH WAS JUST EXAGGERATIONS.

78
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:37,998
SHE NEVER MENTIONED THAT TO ME

79
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:39,700
AT ALL.

80
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,568
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WAS

81
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:42,302
VERY SURPRISED TO SEE.

82
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:44,705
I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE HER

83
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:46,039
MAKING THESE ACCUSATIONS BECAUSE

84
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,773
SHE HAD NEVER, EVER MENTIONED

85
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:50,043
THAT TO ME AT ALL.

86
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:51,845
>> Laura: NOW, YOU FILED A

87
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,247
RESTRAINING ORDER IN MARCH OF

88
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:57,651
2001 AFTER THESE THREATS.

89
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:58,518
YOU SAID IN REPEATED PHONE CALLS

90
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:02,189
TO YOU, THREATENING YOU, AND

91
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,191
YOUR UNBORN CHILD AND YOUR

92
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:04,625
FAMILY.

93
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,326
BUT YOU NEVER FOLLOW THROUGH

94
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,628
WITH IT.

95
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:08,362
YOU NEVER APPEARED IN COURT.

96
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:12,366
IF YOU WERE SO THREATENED BY

97
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,268
JULIE SWETNICK, YOUR

98
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,002
EX-GIRLFRIEND, THEN WHY DIDN'T

99
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:18,072
YOU FOLLOW THROUGH?

100
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,573
>> THAT IS A QUESTION THAT

101
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:20,140
EVERYBODY IS ASKING.

102
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,176
THE REASON I DIDN'T WAS BECAUSE

103
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:22,977
I KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SEE

104
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:24,612
HER AGAIN.

105
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,680
I TALKED AT THAT TIME TO MY

106
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,949
FAMILY, AND WE DECIDED NOT TO DO

107
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:29,316
ANYTHING.

108
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:31,852
NOT TO FOLLOW THROUGH.

109
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:33,454
I AM NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON, I

110
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:35,656
KNEW THE TYPE OF PERSON JULIE

111
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:37,158
IS, AND I WAS AFRAID, TO BE

112
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,827
HONEST WITH YOU.

113
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,495
SO I JUST DECIDED TO LEAVE IT

114
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:41,795
ALONE.

115
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,264
I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AWAY

116
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,532
BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, THE ONLY

117
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,466
THING I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS

118
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:48,135
MY FAMILY.

119
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:51,238
WE CHANGED OUR NUMBERS AND

120
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:51,939
MOVED, AND THAT IS BASICALLY

121
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:55,242
WHAT WE DID.

122
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:56,644
AND WE NEVER HEARD FROM HER

123
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:56,944
AGAIN.

124
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,380
>> AND AFTER YOU CAME FORWARD

125
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,849
AND THAT INITIAL INTERVIEW WITH

126
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,151
POLITICO, DID YOU HEAR FROM ANY

127
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,752
OF HER REPRESENTATIVES?

128
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,855
OR DID YOU HEAR FROM HER AT ALL?

129
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:08,289
>> NOT AT ALL.

130
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,092
NOT AT ALL.

131
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,460
>> Laura: YOUR OWN CREDIBILITY

132
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,261
HAS BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION,

133
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:15,730
AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, BY HER

134
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,033
LAWYER, MICHAEL AVENATTI.

135
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:19,767
HE APPEARED EARLIER TONIGHT ON

136
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:20,034
CNN.

137
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:22,837
LET'S WATCH.

138
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:23,638
>> HER BOYFRIEND SAYS SHE CAN'T

139
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,807
BE TRUSTED, THAT IT'S A

140
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,942
CREDIBILITY THING.

141
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,011
SWETNICK CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

142
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,546
IS THIS A THREAT TO YOU?

143
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:34,382
>> NO, IT'S LUDICROUS, CHRIS,

144
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:35,450
FIRST OF ALL.

145
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,384
ONE LAWSUIT WAS FILED.

146
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,519
IT WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

147
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,253
DISMISSED.

148
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:40,655
THE CLAIMS BY HER EX-BOYFRIEND,

149
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,490
I MEAN WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN

150
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,292
EX-BOYFRIEND OR AN EX-GIRLFRIEND

151
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,660
WHO MIGHT SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT

152
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:45,960
THEM?

153
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,862
>> Laura: WELL, AND

154
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,832
EX-BOYFRIEND, YOU KNOW.

155
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,468
IF BREAKUPS ARE BRUTAL, RIGHT?

156
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:54,035
THEY CAN BE BRUTAL.

157
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,903
IN YOUR CASE, IT WAS REALLY NOT

158
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:56,871
FUN.

159
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:58,072
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY YOU

160
00:04:58,072 --> 00:04:59,440
DON'T LIKE HER BECAUSE YOU WERE

161
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,775
WITH HER FOR SEVEN YEARS AND

162
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,443
THAT IT ABOUT ENDING.

163
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:08,649
>> YEAH, THAT'S A -- LIKE I SAY

164
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,317
BEFORE, IF ANYBODY KNOWS THE

165
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,886
JULIE SWETNICK I KNOW, IF YOU

166
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,554
ASKED ME PERSONALLY IF I BELIEVE

167
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:16,257
HER, I DON'T BELIEVE HER.

168
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:17,258
PERSONALLY, I DON'T BELIEVE HER.

169
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:20,628
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE HER.

170
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:21,295
NOBODY KNOWS JULIE SWETNICK

171
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:24,866
BETTER THAN ME.

172
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,667
AND THE FACTS ARE THAT I KNOW

173
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,034
HER.

174
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,336
THAT IS WHY I CAME HERE TO TELL

175
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,637
THE TRUTH.

176
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:30,972
I KNOW HOW SHE IS.

177
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,073
>> Laura: WELL, YOU WERE WITH

178
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:34,242
HER FOR SEVEN YEARS.

179
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:35,376
YOU ARE DESCRIBING HER LIKE SHE

180
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,178
IS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE, BUT HE

181
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:40,148
SPENT SEVEN YEARS WITH HER.

182
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:41,249
>> FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF

183
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,485
YEARS, WE HAD A NICE

184
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:44,018
RELATIONSHIP.

185
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,420
WE WEREN'T TOGETHER FOR SEVEN

186
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,421
YEARS.

187
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,155
WE WERE TOGETHER OFF AND ON FOR

188
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:49,324
SEVEN YEARS.

189
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,091
THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS, ABOUT

190
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:54,095
A YEAR AND A HALF, AND THEN

191
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:55,664
ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS WE WERE

192
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:56,064
IN BETHESDA.

193
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,266
IT THEN TRANSFERRED TO PANAMA.

194
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,769
I CAME BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS

195
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,636
LATER.

196
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,171
WE WERE SEEING EACH OTHER ONCE

197
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:03,572
IN A WHILE.

198
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,574
BUT THE MORE I SAW HER, THE MORE

199
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,177
I SAW HER, I BASICALLY

200
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,245
EXPERIENCED WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

201
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,647
I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT, AND THE

202
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:15,617
FACT THAT SHE WAS LYING TO ME,

203
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:16,585
SHE PRETTY MUCH TALKED ABOUT

204
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:16,952
EVERYBODY.

205
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:22,057
SHE TALKED ABOUT LAWSUITS.

206
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,391
SHE WAS TRYING TO -- AT

207
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,126
ONE POINT, I REMEMBER SHE TOLD

208
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:29,297
ME THAT SHE WAS FILING A

209
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,032
LAWSUIT, HARASSMENT LAWSUIT

210
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:33,869
AGAINST AMERICAN AIRLINES.

211
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:36,004
I SAID YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO

212
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,672
STOP THIS LAWSUIT THING BECAUSE

213
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:38,273
IT IS RIDICULOUS.

214
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,908
SHE WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT HER

215
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,977
FAMILY.

216
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:43,078
SHE WOULD -- EVERY TIME WE WOULD

217
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:45,881
GET INTO A FIGHT, SHE WOULD GET

218
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,816
RIGHT IN MY FACE.

219
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:50,252
SHE WOULD ASK ME TO HIT HER.

220
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,220
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST REALLY

221
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,021
WEIRD.

222
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:53,922
MOST OF MY FRIENDS DID NOT LIKE

223
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:54,189
HER.

224
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:58,327
IN FACT, I CAN TESTIFY ABOUT

225
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,229
THAT.

226
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:01,029
>> Laura: HOLD ON, RICHARD.

227
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,466
HOLD ON.

228
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,035
SHE WAS LIKE "HIT ME?"

229
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,670
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

230
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,640
>> I DON'T KNOW.

231
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,076
FOR ANY MINOR ISSUES THAT WE HA

232
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:14,776
HAD, SHE WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO

233
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,578
MY FACE.

234
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:18,981
THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS LIKE OH,

235
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,115
MY GOD.

236
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:20,649
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

237
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,651
SHE WOULD GET RIGHT IN MY FACE.

238
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,355
SHE WOULD SAY "HIT ME."

239
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:28,257
HIT ME, RICHARD.

240
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,058
SHE WOULD SAY REMEMBER WHAT

241
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,059
HAPPENED TO MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

242
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,062
I WOULD JUST WALK AWAY.

243
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,465
IT WAS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO ME.

244
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,267
>> Laura: RICHARD, RICHARD.

245
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,501
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD SOME FINANCIAL

246
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,870
ISSUES IN THE PAST, AND YOU

247
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,273
HAVEN'T SHIED AWAY FROM THAT,

248
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:45,007
CORRECT?

249
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,675
YOU'VE BEEN UNDERWATER ON A

250
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,876
MORTGAGE, YOU'VE HAD YOUR OWN

251
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:48,210
ISSUES.

252
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,647
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

253
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:52,481
>> Laura: WHEN YOU WATCHED HER

254
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:57,720
TESTIFY LAST WEEK, WHEN SHE WENT

255
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,387
THROUGH THE VERY HEARTFELT

256
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,856
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO

257
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,857
HER AT THE HANDS OF WHAT SHE

258
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,227
SAID WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, WAS

259
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:06,028
WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?

260
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,096
WHEN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WAS

261
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,732
THINK SHE SO CREDIBLE, SHE SO

262
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,867
BELIEVABLE, YOU KNEW HER FOR

263
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,835
SEVEN YEARS.

264
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:13,502
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR

265
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:15,471
MIND?

266
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,705
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I

267
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,208
FIRST HEARD HER, HER NAME

268
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,044
MENTIONED ON TV, I'M THINKING

269
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,380
OH, MY GOD, .

270
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,548
>> Laura: SHE OBVIOUSLY

271
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,018
DIDN'T -- EXCUSE ME, REFREEZE.

272
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:29,618
SHE DIDN'T TESTIFY.

273
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:30,753
WHEN YOU HEARD HER COME UP WITH

274
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:35,658
THESE ALLEGATIONS -- THE HIDEOUS

275
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,426
ATTACK IT, A GANG RAPE, A

276
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:37,893
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

277
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,195
YOU HAVE BEEN WITH HER FOR SEVEN

278
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:41,063
YEARS.

279
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,232
DID SHE EVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

280
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:43,832
GANG RAPE?

281
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:44,433
>> NEVER.

282
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,868
NEVER.

283
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:47,836
WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING.

284
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:48,604
SHE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THIS TO

285
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,739
ME AT ALL.

286
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,643
>> Laura: RICHARD, MARSIA,

287
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:55,978
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH

288
00:08:55,978 --> 00:00:00,000
US TONIGHT.
