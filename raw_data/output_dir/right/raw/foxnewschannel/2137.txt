THERE IS A SUBPEONA FOR

43
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:48,378
MANAFORT.

44
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:52,816
MUELLER HAS THE POWER TO

45
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,185
SUBPEONA SO LONG AS HE WRITES

46
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,787
THE NAME ON THE PAPER BEFORE HE

47
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:58,622
SERVES THE DOCUMENTS.

48
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,158
WHAT IS SEEMINGLY AN AGGRESSIVE

49
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:04,027
LEGAL TACTIC AND ONE THAT WE

50
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,228

MORE FROM MY SIT DOWN WITH THE

52
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:09,299
MAYOR.

53
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,668
THE MEDIA PAID LITTLE ATTENTION

54
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:11,968
TO.

55
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,937
PAY ATTENTION NOW ABOUT HILLARY

56
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:14,338

YOU ARE CRIMINAL.

62
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,786
EQUAL JUSTICE WOULD MEAN YOU

63
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:31,188
SHOULD GO TO JAIL.

64
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:32,422
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE JUSTICE

65
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:35,959
DEPARTMENT IS NOT INVESTIGATING

66
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,326

THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

76
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:01,585
WHO COULD BE SELECTED FROM THE

HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH AND

81
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:11,228
PRESIDENT ISN'T?

82
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,463
I KNOW JAMES COMEY AND I KNOW

00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:14,664
THE PRESIDENT.

84
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:17,634
SORRY, JIM, YOU ARE A LIAR.

85
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:20,971
A DISGRACEFUL LIAR AND EVERY FBI

00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:39,055
REGULAR THING FOR LAWYERS TO DO.

94
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,524
ONLY POSSIBLE WOULD BE IS

THAT WILL BE TURN OUT TO BE

114
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,507
PERFECTLY ALMOST.

115
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:33,176
THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN

116
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:33,677
MONEY.

124
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,504
FACT AND PURPOSE OF THE PAYMENT

125
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:02,606
INITIALLY OR A LONG TIME UNTIL

126
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,341

BEFORE THE ELECTION AND IN

135
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:26,429
FEBRUARY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH

00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,039
REIMBURSED HIM.

139
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,709
HE LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY

140
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,045
THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF THEN

141
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,847
PRESIDENT-ELECT AT THE TIME

142
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,383
MIGHT HAVE REIMBURSED HIM WITH

143
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:47,317
PERSONAL FUNDS.

144
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:50,987
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS ON

145
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:54,391
BOARD OF A FORCE ONE.

146
00:05:54,391 --> 00:06:02,198
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT?

147
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:05,669

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:06,736
COHEN, MY ATTORNEY.

149
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,038
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK MICHAEL.

150
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,379
>> NOW THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY

151
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,148
KNEW ABOUT THE STORY AT THIS

152
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:18,515
TIME.

153
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:22,385
IT WAS SO WIDELY REPORTED SINCE

154
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,688
JANUARY AND WHAT HE SAID, HE

155
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:25,589
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE PAYMENT

156
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:28,525
PRIOR TO THE STORY BEING

157
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:28,892
COVERED.

158
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:32,529
THIS DID NOT STOP THE HYSTERIA

159
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,898
OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WITH

160
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:40,737
A FEVER PITCH LIKE THE RUSSIA,

161
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:41,104
STORY.

162
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,274
>> I DID NOT WATCH ALL OF YOUR

163
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:44,941
SHOW.

164
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:47,410
RUDY GUILIANI WENT ON FOX NEWS

165
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,913
AND HE STAYED ON LONGER THAN HE

166
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:53,583
IS HAVE, THAT'S WHEN HE GOT TO

167
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,986
THE STORMY DANIELS.

168
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:57,787
WHICH IS BLOCKBUSTER.

169
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:00,490
>> AND HE COULD BE OUT THERE

170
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,658
DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT AND TAKE

171
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:04,027
A HARDER LINE WHEN IT CAME TO

172
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,629
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

173
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,664
BUT HE CREATED ANOTHER MYTH.

174
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:11,468
>> THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT

175
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,970
RUDDY GUILIANI HAD A STRATEGY

176
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,939
AND I AM UNCONVINCED THAT THAT

177
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,374
IS THE CASE.

178
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:22,245
>> HAD RUDY GUILIANI BEEN

179
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:26,216
COUNSEL FOR IBM AND UNDERCUT IBM

180
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:30,487
LIKE HE DID FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

181
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,055
THE UNITED STATES HE WOULD BE

182
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:33,490
FIRED NEXT MORNING.

183
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,794
THE HERO OF 9/11 IS FORGOTTEN

184
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,596
AND SEVERELY DAMAGED HIS LEGACY.

185
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:43,033
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

186
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,068
GUILIANI'S LEGAL STRATEGY.

187
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:48,571
>> HE MET PHORICALLY MURDERED

188
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,640
THE PRESIDENT AND COMMITTED

189
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,612
SUICIDE WITH RESPECT TO HIS OWN

190
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:56,112
REPUTATION.

193
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:02,419
FUNNY EXCEPT THAT IT IS TOO

194
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:02,786
SERIOUS.

221
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,211
OWN HOSTS.

222
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:04,981

249
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:07,477
THE DOOR AND ASKING FOR

250
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,678
