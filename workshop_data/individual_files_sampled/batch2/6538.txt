back when I was in a fraternity actually a Rutgers University Tyler Clementi committed suicide whose national news and after that they created the rainbow dorms I feel like it if you're discriminated against your entire life and you come to a diverse campus where people should tolerate you and then you're bullied by your roommate for something that you can't change about yourself and you are looking for a safe space a safe space would have saved Tyler Clemente's life so when you're against safe spaces you're essentially against people that feel like they've been victimized that do end up harming themselves or committing suicide even in the worst case against your foot in your again let's let's talk about sake let's say you shouldn't be allowed to form those groups or those safe spaces on campus where what where the dippers think they saw become and I think they're stupid and I'd like to say that when I say that they say you committed a microaggression or you committed a trigger warning for someone who consistently dogs about how I'm putting words in your mouth you constantly act like I'm the type of person such as trigger warnings and and you're committing a microaggression against me not everyone is as weak as you try to portray them to be but if there are people that genuinely look for somewhere that look to others to talk to them to heal themselves in some capacity why is that such so many question that you're triggered by how does that infringe on your liberties one of the things that I don't understand and it really bothers me is how much conservatives that talk about freedoms and how they're in favor of protecting your freedoms like to infringe on other people's liberties why do you why I'm saying you can do that
