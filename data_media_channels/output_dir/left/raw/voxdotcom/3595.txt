1
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,980
OK, you ready?”

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,760
Yeah.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,540
I was raised to be Generic.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,500
Born that way.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,860
But on the third day in the second quarter,
I’m starting to think it’s not

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,080
who I really am.

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,000
The moods they don’t understand just yet.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,900
Usually it’s to help sell things.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,600
But sometimes you glimpse a person in that
reflective surface,

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,020
who seems a little bit like you.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,860
My name is Suzy Jackson, and I am a narrator
of audiobooks.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,500
Is that what we call ourselves?

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,720
I’m like, I don’t know — audio...

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
voiceover artist?

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
But we’re talking about audiobooks, so...

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,400
As I’m reading, any time a character pops
up, I’ll underline their name.

17
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,440
She feels like a grandmother — I don’t
have one, but

18
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,619
One trick that I’ll do, I’m trying to
find if I have a place... Here.

19
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,509
Let’s say there’s a sentence that says
“she whispered” at the end.

20
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,780
So I need to know that before I start.

21
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,240
So I’ll underline it while I’m preparing
the book.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,780
See, I’ll draw an arrow to it.

23
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:42,840
And so then I’ll catch it before I’m saying
it.

24
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,110
It’s this weird mental trick of staying
really present, but also kind of also reading

25
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,340
a little bit ahead.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,140
After Dr. Snoot walks away, I fall into a
daze until Kenneth hits me on the shoulder,

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,880
Rita and Adelaide bouncing next to him.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,380
[GURGLING NOISE]

29
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,209
Did you hear... [laughs] so that’s what happens.

30
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,140
You’re like, and now my esophagus made
some strange bubbling sound,

31
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,240
so we stop and pick up.

32
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,870
And he started hitting a vending machine and
I realized — I knew him when I was five!

33
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,430
Before they made me an operator.

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:12,989
I wrote down the characters in the book, and
I noted on my paper what I knew about them:

35
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,150
that Dr. Snoot was like a grandma, that Kenneth
was nerdy, that Rita was always in control,

36
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,860
that Adelaide was feisty.

37
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,720
I felt like I knew the energy of it.

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,480
It says “Kilroy Was Here” underneath.

39
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,920
hours on end, like that stamina is more
difficult than coming up with slight variation

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,200
of vocal quality to distinguish characters.

41
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,840
Whether I’m reading aloud to kids or whether
I’m reading on my own, the experience has

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,600
changed a bit since I’ve been narrating.

43
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,000
You aren’t necessarily only going to be
narrating the style or genre of books that you

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,220
yourself might choose to read on your own.

45
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,620
So I think there is something to just respecting

46
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,300
that story and respecting the audience for
that story.

47
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,680
“Voice,” I tell the group again.

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,280
“The one thing that can never be generic.”

49
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,180
I don’t know if I’ve done alien voices,
but I’ve done in the sci-fi world a lot

50
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,680
of creatures.

51
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,140
“Can you do a pizza order as a dragon?”

52
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,660
“I’ll take a large cheese with extra pepperoni.”

53
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,240
It’s so weird, it’s so weird what I do.

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm frightened.
