TAMPA STUMPING FOR RON
DESANTIS THAT IS.
HE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW WE
ARE STANDING FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
BUT IT WAS JUST A COUPLE
FROM HATHAM CONNECTICUT A
MAN BY THE NAME OF LARRY
IMAGEY.
HE WAS SHOCKED TWO WEEKS AGO
AT ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS A
DEMOCRAT BY THE NAME OF
THAT WAS IN JULY 16TH.
LAST NIGHT THEY HAD ANOTHER
MEETING.
WHAT HAPPENED?
LET'S TAKE YOU BACK TO HAD
DAMN CONNECTICUT.
>> I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE.
THE BACK SHE CAME AROUND THE
TABLE TO SEE IF HER
COLLEAGUE WAS GOING TO
KNEEL.
>> COLLEAGUES EVERYWHERE.
VETERANS IN THE AUDIENCE
SCREAM AT HER TO STAND UP
ARE.
DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER HER.
SHE IS AGAINST THE FLAG AND
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE IN
PARTICULAR.
STEVE: IN PARTICULAR SHE IS
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.
SHE HAVE.
SO REACTION SOME OF THE
PEOPLE THERE LAST NIGHT.
LET'S PLAY SOME OF THAT.
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WHEN YOU KNEELED DOWN FOR
THE SACRED PLEDGE OF
ALLEGIANCE WHAT THOSE PEOPLE
DIED FOR GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO DO THAT AND DISRESPECT.
I THINK IT'S --
>> I WHOLEHEARTEDLY RESPECT
YOUR RIGHT TO PROTEST IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE
>> KNEEL AND TURN YOUR BACK
ON THAT FLAG.
YOU TURNED IT ON HALF OF
THIS TOWN.
STEVE: A LOT OF FOLKS IN
HADDAM WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER
RESIGN.
SHE SAID SHE WOULD NOT.
AINSLEY: SHE HAS NO PLANS TO
SHE HAS RECEIVED HARASSMENT
AND THREATS OVER HER PROTEST
AND CALLS FOR HER
RESIGNATION.
BRIAN: IS THIS ABOUT FREEDOM
OR IS THIS ABOUT DISRESPECT?
TOMI SLARN CONTRIBUTOR UP
EARLY FOR US OR OUT LATE.
WE'RE NOT SURE.
THE REACTION I FIND
HEARTENING.
>> WELL, THE CITIZENS OF
YOU COULD SEE THEIR EMOTION
AND OPERATISM WHICH IS PATRIOTIS
RIGHT.
AND IT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN
THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE
SHIELDED FROM CRITICISM.
SHE IS CHOOSING TO DO THIS
AND CHOOSING TO DISRESPECT
THE FLAG, CLEARLY.
VETERANS IN THE CROWD FEEL
THAT SHE IS DISRESPECTING
AINSLEY: IT'S HARD REALLY TO
WATCH THIS IN MY PERSONAL
THE REMAINS THAT ARE IN
CASKETS COMING HOME TO
AMERICA.
FAMILIES WITHOUT THEIR LOVED
ONES, THEY MADE THE ULTIMATE
SACRIFICE.
WE HAD A GUY ON THE SHOW THE
BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING IN
ACTION.
DAD NEVER CAME HOME.
DOESN'T HAVE ANSWERS.
SO, I MEAN, WHEN YOU HEAR
THESE STORIES AND THEN YOU
SEE PEOPLE KNEELING FOR THE
FLAG, KNOWING WHAT OUR
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HAVE
DONE FOR THIS COUNTRY, I
MEAN, TO ME, IT'S JUST SO
SAD.
>> IT'S SAD AND IT'S
DISHEARTENING.
I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON
THE HEAD THERE BECAUSE WE
HAVE SOME AMERICANS FOUGHT
AND DIED FOR THIS COUNTRY.
IT JUST SHOWS THERE ARE
SOME, USUALLY ON THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AISLE
THIS DISDAIN FOR THIS
PRESIDENT IS GREATER THAN
THEIR LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY.
WE NEED REMEMBER THAT
WHATEVER THEIR ISSUE IS WITH
THIS PRESIDENT AND WITH THIS
ADMINISTRATION OR
TRUMP, IF YOU WILL, THEIR
FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THIS
COUNTRY.
WHY THAT HAS BECOME
SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
EMBRACESIDE BEYOND ME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY IS
PATRIOTISM NOT SOMETHING
THAT ALL AMERICANS BELIEVE
IN.
YOU CAN DISLIKE THIS
PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION
CAN YOU USE THE OTHER 28
HOURS AND 58 MINUTES A DAY
TO SHOW THAT DISDAIN FOR
THIS PRESIDENT AND
ADMINISTRATION.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ANTHEM
AND PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.
STEVE: FELLOW RIGHT BEHIND
HER WHO WE HAD ON THE SHOW A
WEEK AGO LARRY MAGI.
THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE IN
THE SOLID GREEN SHIRT WITH
THE HAND OVER THE HEART
RIGHT THERE, HE SAID HE WAS
SO SHOCKED THAT SHE HAD DONE
IT, HE KIND OF LOST HIS
PLACE IN THE PLEDGE OF
ALLEGIANCE.
FAST FORWARD, HE TOLD US ON
OUR AIR THAT APPARENTLY SHE
HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR A
WHILE.
AND IN FACT THIS IS THE
FIRST MONTH OR SO SHE HAS
TAKEN A KNEE.
SHE HAS REMOVED FLAGS FROM
DIFFERENT EVENTS, THE
AMERICAN FLAG AND I BELIEVE
MEANWHILE HERE IS HER
REACTION TO THE FOLKS IN THE
AUDIENCE CALLING HER OUT.
LISTEN TO THIS.
STEVE: THE TOWN DOESN'T LIKE
IT BUT IT'S FASCIST AND
REPRESENT HER TOWN AND
DISCONTINUE CITIZENS HAS
COUNTRY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF
SHE IS REMOVING AMERICAN
FLAGS AND KNEELING FOR THE
PLEEDGES, HAS DISRESPECT FOR
THE STARS AND STRIPES.
WHY IS SHE CHOOSING TO
REPRESENT HER CITY, HER
TOWN, HER COUNTRY AS AN
IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT SO
MUCH AND HAS SO MUCH DISDAIN
FOR THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SHE
LIVES, WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST
LEAVE LIKE THE REST OF THE
ANTI-TRUMP CROWD WHO
PROMISED TO MOVE.
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING WHEN
YOU LOOK AT THIS DEBATE AND
ONGOING PROTESTING IT, JUST
GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THE
PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO HATE
THIS COUNTRY REFUSE TO LEAVE
ONE, RIGHT?
BRIAN: OR DO WHAT CALIFORNIA
HALF THE STATE THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT TO THE
AMERICAN INDIAN NATION AND
THEN BEGIN SUCCESSION
CALIFORNIA, RIGHT?
STEVE: THOSE ARE YOUR
