THERE HAS BEEN A TITANIC
EFFORT OVER THE COURSE OF
SEVERAL DECADES NOW TO GET THE
PUBLIC IN THE U.S. AND AROUND
THE GLOBE TO CARE ABOUT CLIMATE
CHANGE, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
CHANGES WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE
SOCIALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY BUT
ALSO IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT
POLICY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT BUT NOW I
WONDER IF ALONG THE WAY THE
FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MIGHT
HAVE LED PEOPLE TO PAY A LITTLE
LESS ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE
OTHER THINGS RESULTING FROM OUR
EMISSIONS, OTHER THINGS WE ARE
DOING THAT AREN'T JUST STARTING
TO DEVELOP INTO DISASTERS AND
WILL WRECK OUR CIVILIZATION IN A
FEW DECADES BUT ARE DOING
TERRIBLE DAMAGE TO US RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE GOT SOME SCARY STATS FOR
YOU WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT, AND
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE EFFECT
OF POLLUTION.
NOT CLIMATE CHANGE
OFF IN THE FUTURE BUT POLLUTION
RIGHT NOW AND HOW MANY PEOPLE IT
KILLS AROUND THE GLOBE, THIS
STUDY ESTIMATES THAT EVERY YEAR
IT IS KILLING 9 MILLION PEOPLE,
AND THE BELIEF IS THAT MIGHT BE
AN UNDERESTIMATE --
>>WOW.
>>WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR
GOVERNMENT DOES TO TRY TO
PRESERVE YOUR LIFE, THEY FOCUS
ON SOME OF THOSE A LITTLE MORE
IN TERMS OF RHETORIC BUT ALSO
DOLLARS.
IF WE COULD BRING UP
THIS CHART YOU WILL SEE SOME OF
THOSE CONTRIBUTORS IN TERMS OF
DEATH, YOU SEE HOW MUCH TOTAL
POLLUTION OUTPACES OTHER THINGS
CAUSING DEATH.
THINGS LIKE
TOBACCO SMOKING, THAT'S TRAGIC
BECAUSE IT'S ENTIRELY
PREVENTABLE AND SOME OF IT IS
SECONDHAND, YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE
DISEASE, ALCOHOL AS WELL, THEN
YOU SEE WAR AND MURDER, HOW LOW
IT IS, AND WE WILL RETURN TO
POLLUTION IN THE SECOND, BUT IT
STRIKES ME HOW BAD WE ARE AS A
SPECIES IN UNDERSTANDING AND
PRIORITIZING THINGS THAT ARE
THREATS TO OUR LIVES.
AND YOU
THINK THAT SUPPOSEDLY EVOLUTION
IS SELECTING BASED ON YOUR
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE
RISKS, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
THESE BIG THINGS, NOT THE TIGER
IN THE BUSH BUT THE POLLUTION IN
THE AIR OR THE EMISSIONS FROM A
POWER PLANT, WE CAN'T SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ISN'T
COMPARABLE TO TERRORISM BUT THAT
IT BLOWS TERRORISM OUT OF THE
WATER IN TERMS OF THE LIKELIHOOD
THAT YOU OR SOMEONE YOU CARE
ABOUT COULD BE INJURED OR DIE,
AND AS A SPECIES WE CAN'T
IDENTIFY IT SO WE DON'T
PRIORITIZE IT WHEN IT COMES TIME
TO FUND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES.
>>THIS IS AN AMAZING STATISTIC,
I'M GLAD YOU SHOWED THIS, BUT
YOU MENTIONED EVOLUTION, LET ME
MENTION THIS FROM AN
EVOLUTIONARY STANDPOINT, THERE
IS A BOOK CALLED SAPIENS WHICH I
RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE, AND ONE OF
THE THINGS IN THERE IS THAT AS A
SPECIES WE CAN CONCEPTUALLY
GROUP OURSELVES, AND ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT HAS SEPARATED US
FROM OTHERS, EVEN OTHER SAPIENS
AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME, WAS WE
COULD CREATE A CONCEPT WE CAN
RALLY AROUND LIKE THOSE PEOPLE
ARE BAD, LET'S BAND TOGETHER AND
FIGHT THOSE PEOPLE.
OR THAT
THING IS BAD, MAYBE IN THIS CASE
POLLUTION.
SO THE IDEA THAT
WE'VE CREATED A NOTION THAT
MURDER AND TERRORISM AND THE
OTHER THINGS ON THAT LIST ARE
THE REAL EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO
US, WHEREAS THE THING AT THE TOP
IS NOT TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH,
THIS POLLUTION, IN FACT WE JUST
ELECTED AN ADMINISTRATION THAT
IS COMMITTED TO REMOVING THE
PROTECTIONS WHICH ARE FLIMSY
ALREADY, BASIC AIR AND WATER
PROTECTIONS, SO WE ARE FEEDING
THIS MACHINE BECAUSE WE'VE SOLD
THE CONCEPT EFFECTIVELY, WE'VE
SOLD THE CONCEPT TO OURSELVES,
THAT THE REAL THREAT TO US IS
NOT THIS POLLUTION, POLLUTION IS
BAD AND WE ALL GET THAT, BUT THE
REAL PROBLEM IS THE TERRORISTS
OR THE BLOWING UP STUFF AND
SHOOTING PEOPLE, THAT IS ALL BAD
TOO BUT THIS IS HAPPENING
ON AN ONGOING BASIS.
TO SEE THE STAT LAID OUT LIKE
THAT IS ALARMING.
>>IT DOVETAILS WITH THE
CORPORATE MEDIA, IN PART THE
REASON THERE IS AN EMPHASIS ON
HYPING THINGS LIKE THE WAR
MACHINE AND YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT
THE POLLUTANTS IS PARTLY BECAUSE
THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEING
GAMED BY BOTH SIDES BUT PARTLY
BECAUSE IT'S BAD BUSINESS IF YOU
MAKE YOUR ADVERTISERS ANGRY.
AND
IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE THE
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PUTTING A
LOT OF MONEY IN THERE YOU DON'T
MAKE IT A THING, SO WE NEED
MEDIA TO HOLD THESE FORCES
ACCOUNTABLE.
>>IN MY INTRO I TALKED ABOUT HOW
THANKFULLY WE ARE FOCUSING ON
CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW,
THANKFULLY A LOT OF THE THINGS
WE SHOULD DO AND MUST DO TO
MITIGATE THE WORST EFFECTS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE WOULD ACTUALLY
HELP SIGNIFICANTLY WITH
POLLUTION.
YOU ALLUDED TO THE
CORPORATE MEDIA, I THINK UNTIL
WE GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS,
GET MONEY OUT OF THE MEDIA,
LET'S AT LEAST UTILIZE THE
CORRUPTION.
THE PEOPLE MAKING
THE SOLAR PANELS, COULD YOU
PLEASE START ADVERTISING ON CNN?
AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT, LET'S
JUST THROW FOR THE NEXT 10 OR 20
YEARS BILLIONS IN SUBSIDIES TO
PEOPLE MAKING SOLAR CELLS.
IF
YOU'RE GOING TO SELL OUT AND
GIVE ALL OUR MONEY TO
CORPORATIONS, AT LEAST HAVE IT
BE THE ONES TRYING TO SAVE OUR
LIVES.
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
AND BY THE
WAY THERE'S A QUOTE FROM THE
STUDY THAT SAYS THAT POLLUTION
IS SO DANGEROUS THAT THEY SAY IT
THREATENS THE CONTINUING
SURVIVAL OF HUMAN SOCIETIES.
AND
YOU WILL SEE THESE ARTICLES, CNN
WILL HAVE SOMETHING ON IT,
THEY'LL HAVE AN ARTICLE ON THE
WEBSITE, THINK PROGRESS WILL
COVER IT, THAT WILL BE AWESOME,
BUT TODAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
WAS IN THE NEWS, ONE AMERICAN
NEWS NETWORK TOOK THE STATS
ABOUT CRIME IN THE U.K., LIVES
THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WHICH
LED TO A TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP
-- HERE THEY ARE SAYING IT'S A
THREAT TO THE CONTINUING
SURVIVAL OF OUR SPECIES, WE WILL
TALK ABOUT IT AND MOVE ON.
A
LITTLE MORE INFORMATION,
ALTHOUGH THEY SAY THAT NO
COUNTRY IS FREE OF THE DAMAGING
EFFECTS OF POLLUTION IN THE
PRESENT DAY, 92% OF THE DEATHS
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OCCUR IN
LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES.
THERE'S NO EQUALITY IN TERMS OF
THIS, IT AFFECTS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LESS OF AN ABILITY TO MITIGATE
IT.
>> THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS
CLINGING TO COME I KNOW
IT'S BAD BUT IT'S OVER THERE IN
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T
HAVE MUCH MONEY -- FAX THEN
LET'S HELP THEM.
>>OF COURSE, AND I WOULD ALSO
SAY THIS, IT'S HAPPENING HERE IN
THIS COUNTRY, FIRST WORLD.
THE
PROBLEMS OF AIR AND WATER
POLLUTION ARE BEING LIVED OUT
RIGHT HERE IN THIS PLACE, WITH
ALL THE MONEY.
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE STATISTICAL BREAKDOWN THEY
WILL EVEN SHOW YOU DEATHS FROM
THOSE DISEASES YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT, EMPHYSEMA AND THE LIKE,
HAPPENING IN THE U.S.,
SO WHEN YOU LOOK BEYOND THE
HEADLINES, I KNOW THE
PERCENTAGES ARE LOWER BUT PEOPLE
ARE LOSING THEIR LIVES HERE
BECAUSE OF POLLUTION.
>> AND WHEN YOU OR SOMEONE YOU
KNOW HAS TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
AND GO INTO BANKRUPTCY TO DEAL
WITH SOME OF THESE DISEASES,
UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY DOLLAR YOU
PUT INTO THAT MEDICAL CARE IS
SUBSIDIZING THE CORPORATIONS
THAT PUT THE EMISSIONS AND
POLLUTION INTO THE AIR IN THE
FIRST PLACE, THAT MONEY IS STILL
BEING SPENT, JUST NOT BY THE
CORPORATIONS, BY YOU AND ME.
LET'S BRING UP ONE MORE GRAPHIC
TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE THINGS
LEADING TO THESE DEATHS,
AIRBORNE POLLUTION IS
SIGNIFICANT, CARS, SHIPPING
CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH, ALSO TOXIC
WATER, WORKPLACE POLLUTION, EVEN
THINGS LIKE HEATING SYSTEMS AND
THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE THIRD
WORLD ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT.
AND
THIS WILL CONTINUE ON WITH MY
LET'S USE THE CORRUPTION THING,
IF PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO CARE
IN THIS COUNTRY AND THIS
GOVERNMENT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM
JUST BASED ON WANTING TO
SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES, IF THAT'S
NOT A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH
DRIVER OF INTEREST, LET'S BRING
UP THIS GRAPHIC --
>> 
EVEN IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT
IT'S KILLING YOU, THINK ABOUT
THE MONEY YOU CAN MAKE IF YOU
DEALT WITH THIS.
BY THE WAY AS
WE SAID ALL OF THESE NUMBERS ARE
MORE THAN LIKELY AN
UNDERESTIMATE OF THE ACTUAL
EFFECT, BECAUSE MANY OF THE
DISEASES THAT LEAD TO THE TOP 10
KILLERS IN AMERICA, THINGS LIKE
DIABETES AND LIKE THAT, COULD
HAVE STRONG TIES TO POLLUTION,
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
YET SO THEY AREN'T INCLUDED
IN THESE FIGURES.
>>I POSTED A LINK TO AN ARTICLE
ABOUT THIS TRUMP PENCE
ADMINISTRATION AND THE RELAXING
OF PROTECTIONS FROM THE EPA AND
THE RISE OF ALZHEIMER'S FROM
POLLUTION.
THE HEALTH EFFECTS
REVERBERATE BEYOND THE
FATALITIES TO DIMINISH THE KIND
OF LIFE YOU WILL HAVE IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THIS IS THE STUFF
HAPPENING NOW, THIS NEW
ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY
DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT, SO
I'M GLAD YOU DID THAT STORY.
