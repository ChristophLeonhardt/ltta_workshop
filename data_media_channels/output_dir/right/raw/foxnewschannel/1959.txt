1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:02,129
ONGOING AND THEY'LL RESUME

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:02,662
AGAIN THIS MORNING.

3
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:03,697
>> Julie: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

4
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:06,033
>> Bill: THERE IS A LOT OF

5
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:06,733
REACTION TO THIS.

6
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:10,737
I WANT TO BRING IN DAVID BOSSIE.

7
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:11,671
FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER

8
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,306
FOR THE TRUMP TEAM AND FOX NEWS

9
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:13,707
CONTRIBUTOR.

10
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:14,474
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

11
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,277
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN

12
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:18,678
THE PRESIDENT MADE THE

13
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:20,113
OFFHANDED COMMENT DURING THE

14
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:21,048
IRAN NUCLEAR DECISION YESTERDAY

15
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:22,783
WHEN HE BROKE THE NEWS THAT

16
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:24,751
POMPEO WAS BACK IN NORTH KOREA.

17
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,520
AND MY FEELING WAS IF HE DOES

18
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,522
NOT COME HOME WITH THESE

19
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:30,157
AMERICANS, THAT IS A WIDE OPEN

20
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:31,558
QUESTION MARK AT THAT POINT.

21
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:34,127
BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS

22
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:36,463
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TELLS US

23
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:39,466
THAT THE SUMMIT PLAN WITH KIM

24
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,334
IS STILL ON TRACK AND THIS IS A

25
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:44,671
MISSION THAT WAS SET IN MOTION

26
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,406
SOME TIME AGO AND AT THE MOMENT

27
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,041
IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

28
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,009
WHATEVER COMES AFTER THAT WE'LL

29
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,977
SEE AND WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT

30
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:51,344
POINT.

31
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:54,181
BUT THIS IS A MAJOR

32
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,148
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

33
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:57,951
IT IS AWESOME NEWS FOR THESE

34
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:58,418
THREE AMERICANS.

35
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:00,087
AND IT SHOWS US THAT THE TRACK

36
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:01,955
AND THE PATH IS STILL SET,

37
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:02,255
DAVID.

38
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,123
THAT'S MY OBSERVATION.

39
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:05,959
>> ONE OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS

40
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,728
FROM THIS MUST BE THAT PEACE

41
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:10,964
THROUGH STRENGTH WORKS.

42
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,300
THAT'S WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS

43
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,203
DEVELOPING AS HIS FOREIGN

44
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,472
WITH IRAN YESTERDAY, WHETHER

45
00:01:18,472 --> 00:01:19,172
IT'S DEALING WITH UPCOMING

46
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,975
SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA.

47
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:23,376
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE DECIDED

48
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:25,245
IT SEEMS -- WE HAVE A LONG WAY

49
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:28,515
TO GO -- IT SEEMS THEIR

50
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,150
LEADERSHIP HAS DECIDED TO

51
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,585
THROUGH THIS GOODWILL GESTURE

52
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:34,421
TO SAY WE'RE READY TRULY TO SIT

53
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:35,489
DOWN AND DISCUSS

54
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:36,790
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

55
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,157
PENINSULA.

56
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:39,559
IF WE DO THAT, IF THIS

57
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,327
PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

58
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:43,163
THAT, IT IS A TREMENDOUS

59
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:44,331
VICTORY NOT JUST FOR THE UNITED

60
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,966
STATES BUT FOR THE WORLD.

61
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,834
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS PRESIDENT

62
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,737
IS FOCUSED ON.

63
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:53,940
WORKING NIGHT AND DAY TO MAKE

64
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,575
SURE THAT WE AS AMERICANS ARE

65
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:57,244
PROTECTED AT HOME AND ABROAD.

66
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:59,312
I THINK THIS JUST PROVES THAT

67
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:03,049
HE IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON THESE

68
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,451
IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY AND

69
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,586
DOESN'T LET ALL THE OTHER STUFF

70
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:07,053
BOTHER HIM.

71
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:08,455
AN AMAZING THING TO SEE AND

72
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:08,755
WATCH.

73
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:11,056
>> Bill: SOME OF THE POINTS ARE

74
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:11,525
VALID.

75
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:12,926
THE PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF JAMES

76
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:15,095
MATTIS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

77
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,697
I THINK KIM LISTENS TO THAT

78
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:18,064
PRESSURE.

79
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:23,537
WHAT WAS HIS CALCULATION?

80
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,338
GOING TO CHANGE THIS KINGDOM

81
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:27,440
THAT IS SO SEALED FROM THE

82
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,875
OUTSIDE WORLD?

83
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,244
>> THAT'S THE MILLION DOLLAR

84
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:34,080
QUESTION, BILL.

85
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,582
WHAT HAS CHANGED IN KIM'S MIND

86
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:38,552
THAT HAS MADE HIM -- ALLOWED

87
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:39,719
HIM TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO

88
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,190
GO TO SOUTH KOREA, TO VISIT NOW

89
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,357
REGULARLY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

90
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:46,459
SOUTH KOREA TO TALK TO OUR

91
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,894
PRESIDENT AND TO MEET NOW A

92
00:02:47,894 --> 00:02:53,166
NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE KNOW OF

93
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,568
NOW SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO.

94
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:56,203
IT IS A WONDERFUL THING FOR

95
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:58,538
AMERICA TO WAKE UP TODAY AND

96
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:03,376
SEE THESE THREE HOSTAGES.

97
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:06,046
TWO OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE A SHAM

98
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,782
TRIAL, ONE HAD A SHAM TRIAL.

99
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:12,852
I WANT TO NOT FORGET OTTO

100
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:13,320
WARMBIER.

101
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,955
IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

102
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,023
REMEMBER OTTO AND WHAT HAPPENED

103
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:18,458
TO HIM AND WHAT THIS REGIME HAS

104
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,794
BEEN LIKE IN THE PAST.

105
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:21,761
THEIR GOODWILL GESTURE TODAY IS

106
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,462
VERY IMPORTANT.

107
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,164
>> Bill: HIS PARENTS ARE NOT

108
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:25,732
LETTING HIS STORY DRIFT TO THE

109
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:26,199
SIDE.

110
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,867
>> AND NO ONE SHOULD.

111
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,502
>> Bill: IT'S A CONSTANT

112
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,904
REMINDER OF THE BRUTALITY THAT

113
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:33,907
SO MANY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO

114
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,542
INSIDE NORTH KOREA FOR SO LONG.

115
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:41,147
>>  THIS PRESIDENT REMEMBERS

116
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:41,448
THAT.

117
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:43,950
JUST AS REAGAN DID WHEN HE WENT

118
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,287
TO MEET WITH GORBACHEV.

119
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:48,722
YOU DON'T FORGET WHAT THE

120
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:50,590
SOVIETS HAVE DONE FOR THE PAST

121
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,157
40 YEARS.

122
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,459
IT IS A BIG STEP WHAT HAPPENED

123
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:52,759
TODAY.

124
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,794
>> Bill: I WILL NOT FORGET THAT

125
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,896
MOMENT THAT KIM WENT WALKING

126
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,798
DOWN THAT SIDEWALK ALONG THE

127
00:03:58,798 --> 00:03:59,266
DMZ.

128
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,268
THIS IS A YOUNG PERSON FILLED

129
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,068
WITH PERSONALITY.

130
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:04,371
AND A LOT OF CONFIDENCE.

131
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:07,173
SO NOW FINAL QUESTION, DAVID.

132
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:10,176
THE SUMMIT HAPPENS FOR DECADES

133
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,345
WE THOUGHT TRUST AND VERIFY,

134
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:13,513
TRUST BUT VERIFY.

135
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:15,615
THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF

136
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:17,483
THE U.S. MAKING SURE THEY STICK

137
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,952
TO THEIR WORD AND FOLLOW

138
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,254
THROUGH WITH ACTION.

139
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,289
IF THAT PATTERN CONTINUES WE

140
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,690
CAN HAVE SUCCESS HERE.

141
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,425
IF IT DOESN'T IT'S AN OPEN

142
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,792
QUESTION.

143
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:26,760
LAST ANSWER ON THAT.

144
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,762
>> YOU LOOK AT THIS PRESIDENT

145
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:29,529
IF YOU'RE KIM JONG-UN.

146
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,631
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS

147
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:31,998
PRESIDENT.

148
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:34,401
HE MAKES PROMISES AND HE KEEPS

149
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:34,868
THEM.

150
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:37,570
SO WHATEVER HE DECIDES TO DO

151
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,672
DURING THIS SUMMIT, HE IS GOING

152
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,073
TO LIVE UP TO HIS END.

153
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:41,474
THE UNITED STATES WILL LIVE UP

154
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:42,208
TO OUR END.

155
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,544
BUT HE IS GOING TO MAKE THE

156
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,880
DEMANDS, I THINK, THAT ARE WELL

157
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,449
THOUGHT OF AND DEVELOPED, WHICH

158
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,684
IS THE DENUCLEARIZATION AND GET

159
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,285
RID OF THAT MISSILE PROGRAM.

160
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,687
GET RID OF THE DANGEROUS

161
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,322
NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT ARE THERE.

162
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:57,424
IF WE COME AWAY WITH THAT, THIS

163
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:01,428
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE

164
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:02,829
TO DELIVER A HUGE VICTORY FOR

165
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:03,496
THIS COUNTRY.

166
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:06,366
>> Bill: THERE WILL BE A SUMMIT

167
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,600
BUT NOT A RESOLUTION FOR MONTHS

168
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,234
OR YEARS AFTER THAT.

169
00:05:08,234 --> 00:00:00,000
I WANT TO CAUTION THE AUDIENCE.
