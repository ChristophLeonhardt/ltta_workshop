president Trump's former chief strategist has expressed his regret for comments included in the sensational best-seller about the White House fire and fury my comments were aimed at Paul Manafort a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate to reiterate those comments were not aimed at DOM Jr I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr has diverted attention from the president's historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency well here are just a few allegations from the new book it's claimed that Trump found the White House daunting and that his own behavior contributed to chaos and dysfunction it also alleges that the person behind the leaks of personal data was the president himself and that Trump enjoys eating cheeseburgers in bed well Trump's senior policy adviser was invited on to the mainstream media and tried to explain the revelations but he was cut off by the presenter 24 hours of negative antitrump hysterical coverage on this network it led in recent weeks as some spectacularly embarrassing false report I think the viewers are entitle I have my three months of the truth why don't you just give me three minutes I tell you the truth Donald Trump that I know I mean all of our campaigns because now I show an I don't want to do that well let's cross live now to a political talk show host Brian Crabtree to discuss this further Brian thank you so much indeed for waiting and I promise I won't cut you off Stephen Miller's interview on CNN that was cut short as we heard Widevine someone on from Trump's administration and they're not give them the chance to talk well CNN of all places I mean they're based here in Atlanta they love to basically bring conservatives especially Trump conservatives on their network and give them a bashing if you will that's that's their that's their mode of operation they love to bring them on and lecture them about what's wrong with Trump and the American people judging by the ratings don't care much for it well what do you think that Steve Bannon actually apologized for his comments in fire and fear I mean do you think that it was damage control or do you think he was actually miss quoted I think he was misquoted and I think he also was quoted i-i-i think if you look at this book this is the biggest bout of fake news we've seen in a long time they quoted the fact that Donald Trump didn't know who John Boehner our former Speaker of the House was he's played golf with him he was the Speaker of the House for four months when Trump began his campaign so I think Steve Bannon if you look at what he's really doing here the agenda of Steve Bannon is to run for president run a large political action committee and that's why I got fired I think Steve Bannon was Pro Trump until he got a taste of the power that became with President Trump and then he became Pro Steve Bannon he was doing interviews he seemed to go rogue and eventually when John Kelly the current chief of staff former general Kelley took the rein see he worked on getting him al stood from from the White House and I think that's really what this is about Steve Bannon thinks that he's a superstar the media to their credit have built him up as that and I think he went off the rails I think it was all about Steve Bannon and his agenda and I think he lost the thought that he was damaging Trump who he helped get elected well let's look at the ramifications and I mean how could bannon's retraction affect the media frenzy about Trump's alleged mental state which you've heard so much about I mean do you think it could force the media to admit that not everything in fire and fury is true well no it's pretty much untrue I think there's some truth in it but I think the reader has been left to figure out what's true and what's not I mean let's face it Michael wolf sat inside the White House he basically grabbed people as they walked by had extensive conversations with Steve Bannon he's admitted to some extent some stuff isn't fully verified and then on top of that he's gotten information from Steve Bannon that is second-hand comments and he's quoted them as if they're first hand so you can't really it's a great fiction work it's good in her entertainment but I don't I think the fallout is going to be the same as every other controversy thus far on Trump if you're looking at approval ratings maybe they take a hit but in reality the the support behind Trump it seems to be unwavering and this is another media frenzy so I don't think this has much impact on the president going forward I think it just shows that there's a few people that he has put himself around that he may need to take a second look at Steve Bennett was one of them that's already done but III think at the end of the day this thing's a big joke and we've been left to just figure this stuff out date and we leave it there Ryan crowd cheers I say thank you for waiting it's good to hear your thoughts thank you
