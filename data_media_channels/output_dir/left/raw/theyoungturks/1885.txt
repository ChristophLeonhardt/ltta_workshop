1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,090
NIKKI HALEY AND LARRY KUDLOW
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CATFIGHT.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,000
THERE'S A LOT OF DRAMA, IT'S
LIKE A SOAP OPERA BUT IN

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,320
GOVERNMENT, AND IT HAS
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SANCTIONS

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
AGAINST RUSSIA.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,809
NOW EARLIER THIS
WEEK THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:18,750
ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
FINALLY IMPOSING AND ENFORCING

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,960
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA BECAUSE
OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,060
WHOLE MESS IN SYRIA, AND SO
PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT ALL OF

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,779
THESE RUSSIA INVESTIGATIONS ARE
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING WERE

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,310
LIKE, SEE, HE'S GOING TO DO
THESE SANCTIONS, WHAT DO YOU

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,910
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT NOW?

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,540
TURNS OUT HE IS NOT PLANNING ON

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,540
ENFORCING THE SANCTIONS AND HE
DIDN'T EVEN COMMUNICATE THAT

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,100
WITH NIKKI HALEY WHO IS THE U.S.
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
NATIONS.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,610
NOW, IT ALL STARTED WHEN NIKKI
HALEY WENT ON TELEVISION

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,890
AND SAID THIS.

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,700
>>ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES
FOR ASSAD'S PATRONS, RUSSIA AND

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,790
IRAN, WHO CONTINUE TO PROTECT
HIM?

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,790
>>ABSOLUTELY.

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,370
SO YOU WILL SEE
THAT RUSSIAN SANCTIONS WILL BE

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,800
COMING DOWN, SECRETARY MNUCHIN
WILL BE ANNOUNCING THOSE ON

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
MONDAY IF HE HASN'T ALREADY, AND
THEY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO ANY

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,110
SORT OF COMPANIES THAT ARE
DEALING WITH EQUIPMENT RELATED

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,930
TO ASSAD AN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
USE, AND I THINK EVERYONE IS

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,720
WHEN TO FEEL IT AT THIS POINT, I
THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WE

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
SENT A STRONG MESSAGE, AND OUR
HOPE IS THAT THEY LISTEN TO IT.

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
>>WRONG.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,180
THAT IS NOT WHAT IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,180
NO ONE

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,400
COMMUNICATED WITH HER THAT
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,330
HAPPEN, BUT LARRY KUDLOW, WHO IS
TRUMP'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR,

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,890
RESPONDED TO WHAT NIKKI HALEY
HAD TO SAY ON TELEVISION

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,730
AND HERE IS WHAT HIS RESPONSE
WAS.

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,120
>>SHE'S DONE A GREAT JOB, SHE'S
A VERY EFFECTIVE AMBASSADOR,

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,850
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME
MOMENTARY CONFUSION ABOUT THAT

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,549
BUT IF YOU TALK TO STEVE MNUCHIN
AT TREASURY HE WILL TALK TO THE

38
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,060
SAME THING, AND THEY ARE IN
CHARGE OF THIS.

39
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,060
WE'VE HAD

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,720
SANCTIONS, ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS
ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION.

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,730
>>SO HALEY GETS SALTY ABOUT
THESE COMMENTS AND RESPONDS WITH,

42
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,730
QUOTE --

43
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,000
>>GOOD FOR HER.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,430
NEVER GETS
CONFUSED.

45
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,690
>>CONFUSION IS A NORMAL PART
OF LIFE BUT I LIKE THAT

46
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,179
RESPONSE, IT WAS STRONG.

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,230
>>THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY THING I
LIKE ABOUT NIKKI HALEY.

48
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,230
>>AGREED.

49
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,290
>>I'M GOING TO BREAK THAT DOWN
IN THREE PARTS, ONE IS THE

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,730
DRAMA, OR DRAHMS, AS WE LIKE TO
CALL IT, THERE IS THE SHORT-TERM

51
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,951
DRAMA OF THIS CATFIGHT, THE
LONG-TERM DRAMA OF NIKKI HALEY

52
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:30,530
MAY BE COMING FROM BEHIND WITH A
2 X 4 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP?

53
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,080
HOLD, WE'LL GET TO THAT.

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,650
BUT THE
SECOND PART IS THE INSTABILITY

55
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,549
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND
THE MESSAGE WE ARE SENDING TO

56
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,549
THE WORLD.

57
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:43,389
AND THE THIRD PART IS
POLICY WHERE I'M MORE ON DONALD

58
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:45,819
TRUMP'S SIDE THEN NIKKI HALEY'S
SIDE.

59
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,050
WHAT IS THIS?

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,050
FIRST OF ALL

61
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,269
I HAVE TO NOTE MY AMUSEMENT AT
HER GOING ON TV AND SAYING WE

62
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,249
ARE SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE TO
RUSSIA.

63
00:02:56,249 --> 00:02:58,110
TURNS OUT, NO, WE'RE

64
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,430
SENDING A REALLY, REALLY WEAK
MESSAGE TO RUSSIA, WHICH IS OKAY

65
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,909
BECAUSE AGAIN I DON'T NEED TO
ANTAGONIZE RUSSIA MORE.

66
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:05,909
BUT I

67
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,610
WOULD HAVE SKIPPED THE
FLIP-FLOPPING PART BECAUSE THAT

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,549
REALLY SEEMS FAIRLY PATHETIC.

69
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,079
AND THEN SHE SAID THIS WILL SHOW

70
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,590
THAT WE MEANT BUSINESS.

71
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,950
NO,
SINCE YOU SAID IT AND HAD TO

72
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,760
TAKE IT BACK IT ACTUALLY SHOWS
THE EXACT OPPOSITE, WE DO NOT

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,319
MEAN BUSINESS.

74
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,640
AND FINALLY SHE
SAID THAT RUSSIA WILL BE FEELING

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
THE PAIN.

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,760
NO, IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE FEELING THE PAIN, NOT

77
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
RUSSIA.

78
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,150
SO THAT GETS THE POINT
NUMBER ONE, WHICH IS DONALD

79
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,050
TRUMP APPARENTLY WATCHING THIS
ON TV GREW VERY ANGRY AND

80
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,409
STARTED YELLING AT THE TV, AND
THEN ANYONE ELSE WHO WAS NEARBY,

81
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,529
THAT'S ACCORDING TO NEW YORK
TIMES REPORTING, AND THEY HAVE

82
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,209
SOURCES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.

83
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,319
SO, CLOWN OF ALL CLOWNS, DO YOU

84
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,969
WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR
POLICY IS AND EFFECTIVELY

85
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,129
COMMUNICATE THAT TO ALL THE
PEOPLE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION,

86
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,450
ESPECIALLY BEFORE THEY GO ON TV?

87
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,939
SO ON THE ISSUE OF WHOSE FAULT

88
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:02,719
IS THE MISCOMMUNICATION, THAT'S
EXTREMELY CLEAR, OF COURSE

89
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,180
DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT.

90
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,159
NIKKI
HALEY IS A PROFESSIONAL, AND ON

91
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,930
THIS ISSUE I AGREE WITH YOU,
ANA, THAT SHE WAS NOT CONFUSED,

92
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,699
IT WAS TRUMP WHO WAS CONFUSED AS
USUAL.

93
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,918
BUT IT'S A LARGER ISSUE

94
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,298
THAN THAT, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE INSIDE THE TRUMP

95
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,310
ADMINISTRATION WHO WANT TO PUSH
A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE

96
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,300
TOWARDS RUSSIA, AND THEY KEEP
PUSHING AND PUSHING IN THAT

97
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,150
DIRECTION SO EVERY ONCE IN A
WHILE NIKKI HALEY OR SOMEONE

98
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,000
ELSE WILL COME OUT AND GO WE ARE
GOING TO SHOW RUSSIA, AND THEN

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,530
TRUMP IS LIKE, YOU IDIOTS, DID
YOU NOT GET THE MEMO THAT I'M

100
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,530
COMPROMISED?

101
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,099
I DON'T WANT TO DO
SOMETHING STRONG AGAINST RUSSIA,

102
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,210
I OWE THEM, OR WHATEVER IT IS,
TAPES, MONEY LAUNDERING,

103
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,780
WHATEVER, BUT NO, WE AREN'T
DOING ANYTHING STRONG ON RUSSIA,

104
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,289
WHEN IS IT GOING TO GET THROUGH
YOUR THICK HEAD THAT I'M

105
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,289
CORRUPT?

106
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,150
>>I HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO
CHIME IN ON.

107
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,270
FIRST OF ALL I WANT

108
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,610
TO MENTION THIS CAVEAT FOR I GET
INTO MY COMMENTARY BECAUSE NIKKI

109
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,990
HALEY'S FOREIGN POLICY IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE

110
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,569
OF, SHE'S INCREDIBLY HAWKISH,
SHE IS IN FAVOR OF, YOU KNOW,

111
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,389
DOING THESE SANCTIONS, BECAUSE,
LOOK, SHE BELIEVES IN THE

112
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,409
SANCTIONS, BUT SHE ALWAYS WANTS
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE

113
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:17,190
APPROACH THAN WE NEED TO WHEN IT
COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY, SO

114
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,580
OVERALL I DON'T NECESSARILY
AGREE WITH HER.

115
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,580
HOWEVER, WHEN IT

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,350
COMES TO HOW ALL THIS ALL
UNFOLDED PUBLICLY, SHE IS NOT IN

117
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,350
THE WRONG.

118
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,890
SHE WAS NOT ADVISED
THAT THEY HAD DECIDED TO SWITCH

119
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,180
GEARS, AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME
STATEMENTS FROM ACTUAL WHITE

120
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,189
HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT SPOKE TO
THE NEW YORK TIMES --

121
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:35,189
>>

122
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:43,580
>>SO THIS KEEPS HAPPENING OVER
AND OVER AGAIN IN THE TRUMP

123
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,460
ADMINISTRATION, AND STANDARD
PROTOCOL IS, WELL, THE PERSON

124
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,210
WHO WASN'T INFORMED AND
UNFORTUNATELY MADE THESE

125
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,510
STATEMENTS PUBLICLY SHOULD NOW
BE SMEARED, OR SHOULD BE

126
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,810
CRITICIZED, OR SHOULD BE PUT
DOWN IN SOME WAY. AND SO THAT'S

127
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,430
WHEN KUDLOW GETS INVOLVED AND
SAID SHE MUST HAVE GOTTEN

128
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,969
CONFUSED, I'M PARAPHRASING, AND
I LOVE THAT SHE WASN'T HAVING

129
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:03,969
IT.

130
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:06,409
SHE'S LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO
FOLLOW PROTOCOL, I DON'T GET

131
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,930
CONFUSED, HERE IS WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED.

132
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,750
SO I APPRECIATE HOW

133
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,150
SHE HANDLED THAT EVEN IF OVERALL
WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY

134
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,950
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH
HER.

135
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,699
WITH THAT SAID, CENK

136
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,439
ALLUDED TO TRUMP'S REACTION
AFTER WATCHING HALEY ON

137
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,050
TELEVISION AND WHAT SHE HAD TO
SAY ABOUT THE SANCTIONS, AND THE

138
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:31,669
TIMES IS REPORTING THAT THIS
HAPPENED, LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC

139
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:32,860
EIGHT --

140
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
>>

141
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,650
>>AND APPARENTLY HE REPEATED
AGAIN, WHO WROTE THAT FOR HER?

142
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,490
>>LET ME BE CLEAR, THESE ARE
TWO DIFFERENT INSTANCES, SAME

143
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,189
REACTION IN BOTH.

144
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,430
WHEN SHE'S ON
FACE THE NATION TALKING ABOUT

145
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,400
RUSSIA OVER THE WEEKEND HE GETS
ANGRY AND YELLS AT THE TV.

146
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,090
EARLIER IN THE ADMINISTRATION
WHEN SHE HAD GONE AND CRITICIZED

147
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,039
RUSSIA ABOUT THEIR INTERVENTION
IN UKRAINE, SAME EXACT REACTION.

148
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,229
SUPER ANGRY, YELLING AT THE
SCREEN, ETC., THAT GOES TO THE

149
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,360
POINT I WAS MAKING EARLIER.

150
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,939
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR TRUMP, WHEN

151
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,550
ARE YOU GOING TO REALIZE HE
DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING

152
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,210
ABOUT RUSSIA?

153
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,960
AND YOU KNOW FOR
SOME ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT TO

154
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,710
THINK NO, NO, TRUMP HAS DEEPLY
HELD PRINCIPLES AND THE

155
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,060
GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY --
[LAUGHTER].

156
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,719
ANYWAY, YOU THINK

157
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,530
THAT, GOD BLESS YOUR HEART.

158
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,979
OKAY, THEN HE HAS A GOVERNING

159
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,990
PHILOSOPHY THAT WE SHOULD BE AT
PEACE WITH RUSSIA AND SANCTIONS

160
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,440
AND BOMBING AND ALL THESE
DIFFERENT THINGS ARE GOING TO

161
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,810
UPSET THAT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY,
OR HE'S COMPROMISED, BUT EITHER

162
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,409
WAY IT'S CLEAR THAT HE FEELS
VERY, VERY STRONGLY THAT WE

163
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,960
SHOULD BE SOFT ON RUSSIA.

164
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,669
AND BY
THE WAY, AGAIN ON POLICY I'M

165
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,760
ABOUT TO AGREE WITH HIM ON SOME
PARTS.

166
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,529
BUT NO, THE

167
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,840
MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, THE
NEOCONSERVATIVES -- HERE, I'LL

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,879
GET TO MY AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW,
NIKKI HALEY IS A NEOCON, AND AS

169
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,870
RO KHANNA POINTED OUT SHE'S A
PARENT OF LINDSAY GRAHAM AND

170
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,819
JOHN MCCAIN, AND THAT'S HER JOB,
IS TO DRIVE US INTO WAR.

171
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,819
SO NO,

172
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,259
I VOTE NO, I'M TOTALLY AGAINST
THAT.

173
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,330
NO MATTER WHY TRUMP WANTS

174
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,060
TO BE VERY, VERY FRIENDLY TO
RUSSIA, I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE

175
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,230
VERY FRIENDLY TO RUSSIA, I
BELIEVE SOME OF THE SANCTIONS

176
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,840
MIGHT MAKE SENSE, BUT IN TERMS
OF THE BOMBING OR DRIVING US OR

177
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,509
INTO MILITARY CONFLICT IN SYRIA,
NO WAY.

178
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,380
I'M WITH TRUMP ON THAT,

179
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,000
THAT NO, WE SHOULD TAP THE
BRAKES AND WE SHOULD NOT JUST

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,789
BULLDOZE INTO WARS THAT THE
NEOCONS LIKE NIKKI HALEY WANT.

181
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,970
SO ON THE MISCUE IN OCCASION,
THE CLOWNISH IN US, ALL OF THAT,

182
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,100
TRUMP IS WRONG.

183
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,539
ON THE POLICY
NIKKI HALEY IS WAY MORE WRONG

184
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,949
>>OVERALL I AGREE WITH THAT
ASSESSMENT, HOWEVER I DO LOVE

185
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,020
JUST THE WAY SHE'S HANDLING
HERSELF IN THE POSITION THAT

186
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,250
SHE'S IN, BECAUSE REMEMBER,
TRUMP IS SURROUNDED BY YES-MEN,

187
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,250
RIGHT?

188
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,190
I THINK OF JEFF SESSIONS,
AND HOW INCREDIBLY HUMILIATED HE

189
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,290
BECAME AFTER TRUMP HAS
CRITICIZED HIM TIME AND TIME

190
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,190
AGAIN ON SOCIAL MEDIA, HE'S LIKE
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, TRUMP,

191
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,290
PLEASE LIKE ME.

192
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,950
BUT NIKKI HALEY
IS LIKE, I'LL PUSH BACK.

193
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,950
I'LL

194
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,620
YOU AN EXAMPLE, THE NEW YORK
TIMES REPORTED THAT TRUMP HAS

195
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,410
GROWN EXASPERATED BY HER
OUTSPOKENNESS.

196
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,990
HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.

197
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,990
>>SHOCKING.

198
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,120
>>IS THAT BOTHERING YOU?

199
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,900
AND
THEN ANOTHER THING, THERE ARE

200
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,120
WHISPERS, RUMORS WITHIN THE
WHITE HOUSE INVOLVING MIKE PENCE

201
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,050
AND NIKKI HALEY AND HOW THEY
MIGHT JOIN FORCES TO CHALLENGE

202
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,670
TRUMP IN 2020.

203
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,470
LOOK, I HATE BOTH
OF THEM, I HIT BOTH OF THEM, BUT

204
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,050
I LOVE THAT DRAMA, IT'S SO GOOD.

205
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,610
>>ET TU, HALEY?

206
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,180
SO EARLIER ON
THERE WERE REPORTS THAT NIKKI

207
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,180
HALEY AND DONALD TRUMP WERE
GETTING ALONG FAMOUSLY.

208
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
I NEVER

209
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,360
BELIEVED THOSE REPORTS, BECAUSE
NIKKI HALEY WAS NOT IN THE TRUMP

210
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,380
CAMP TO BEGIN WITH DURING THE
PRIMARIES, SHE IS WAY MORE

211
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,200
ESTABLISHMENT THAN DONALD TRUMP,
AND SHE HAS HIGH AMBITIONS.

212
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
NONE

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,210
OF THESE ARE GOING TO BE A GOOD
MATCH FOR DONALD, SO I WAS JUST

214
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,640
WAITING FOR THIS TO BLOW UP, AND
NOW IT HAS.

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,730
SO WHEN TRUMP HEARS

216
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,510
HER BEING TOUGH AGAINST VLADIMIR
PUTIN HE'S LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW

217
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,200
WHAT I KNOW, SHUT UP!

218
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,900
THEN HE
HEARS, WAIT, WAIT, LET ME GET

219
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,311
THIS RIGHT, RUMORS OF PENCE AN
HALEY, NOT IN 2024, IN 2020 WHEN

220
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,870
I WOULD BE RUNNING FOR
REELECTION?

221
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,670
OH NO SHE DIDN'T. SO

222
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,870
HERE COMES ORANGE-FACED, FUMING,
VOLCANO TRUMP.

223
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,830
SO NOW THE CLOCK

224
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,550
HAS BEGUN A NIKKI HALEY'S TENURE
AT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,

225
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,730
TICK TICK TICK.

226
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,250
SHE COULD BE
GONE IN THE NIKKI OF TIME.

227
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,010
>>YOU'RE THE WORST.

228
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,010
>>AGREED.

229
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,880
>>LET'S PRETEND LIKE THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.

230
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,710
>>I SHOULD HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU
SOONER.

231
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,520
MAYBE I'M MISSING, WE

232
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,490
ARE TALKING SANCTIONS, I DON'T
THINK SHE'S TALKING ABOUT, OKAY,

233
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,350
SO THE POLICY NOW BEING BECAUSE
WHATEVER CHEMICAL ATTACK

234
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,480
HAPPENED IN SYRIA WE WILL LAUNCH
MORE BOMBS AND TRUMP IS AGAINST

235
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
THAT?

236
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,390
BECAUSE BEASLEY HIS FOR
THAT, HE DID IT, OF COURSE IT'S

237
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,050
A CURSORY THING TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE HE'S A TOUGH GUY WHEN WE

238
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,690
AREN'T REALLY SURE WHAT ALL
HAPPENED.

239
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,690
BUT WE ARE TALKING

240
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,410
ABOUT SANCTIONS THAT TRUMP ISN'T
I THOUGHT IMPLEMENTING FROM THE

241
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,821
BEGINNING, THINGS THAT CONGRESS
ALREADY VOTED ON, BIPARTISAN, TO

242
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,940
IMPLEMENT ON RUSSIA BASED ON
THINGS THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN

243
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,210
GENERAL FROM BEGINNING TO END.

244
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,990
SO THAT'S WHAT HE DISAGREES WITH

245
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,310
HER ON?

246
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,400
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM
ON ALLOWING THAT STUFF TO JUST

247
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
SLIDE.

248
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,320
>>JAYAR MAKE A GREAT POINT, AND
THANK YOU BECAUSE I NEED TO

249
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
CLARIFY THAT.

250
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,790
I'M AGAINST NIKKI
HALEY'S GENERALLY HAWKISH,

251
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,190
NEOCON VIEWS AND HER CALLS FOR
MORE BOMBING, ETC.

252
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,190
BUT ON THIS

253
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,400
SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT
CLARIFICATION IS SO IMPORTANT

254
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,050
BECAUSE THIS WAS ABOUT SANCTIONS
GOING TOWARDS OLIGARCHS WHO HAD

255
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,490
BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH SYRIA'S
CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM.

256
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,490
NOW,

257
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,110
THAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY
UNOBJECTIONABLE, EVEN FOR GUYS

258
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,910
LIKE ME WHO DON'T WANT ANY
ESCALATION WITH SYRIA OR RUSSIA.

259
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,770
SO, NUMBER ONE, ON THAT
PARTICULAR ISSUE, YOU'RE WRIGHT,

260
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,220
JAYAR, I'M ON HALEY RATHER THAN
TRUMP'S SIDE.

261
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
MACRO ISSUES WHERE

262
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,420
SHE WANTS TO KEEP PUSHING MORE
TOWARDS CONFLICT I'M AGAINST HER

263
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
AND MORE WITH TRUMP.

264
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,270
BUT MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THAT IS WHY TRUMP

265
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,710
BLOWS UP OVER THIS, BUT NOT THE
BOMBING.

266
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,100
WHY?

267
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
BECAUSE THIS

268
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,530
TOUCHES RUSSIAN FINANCIAL
INTERESTS, AND SO THAT ACTUALLY

269
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,690
HURTS THE OLIGARCHS WHO HE IS IN
BED WITH.

270
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,690
AND THAT'S WHY HE

271
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,860
CAN'T HAVE IT.

272
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,160
THE BOMBING, SOME
PEOPLE DIE, WHATEVER.

273
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
A LOT OF

274
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,790
PEOPLE ARE DYING IN SYRIA, AS
LONG AS YOU DON'T HIT THE

275
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,370
RUSSIANS I THINK WE WILL BE OKAY
AND THAT MAKES ME LOOK TOUGH,

276
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,810
BUT IF MY FRIENDS IN RUSSIA HAVE
THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS FROZEN, THEY

277
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,560
ARE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT
THAT.

278
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
THAT'S WHY HE FLIPPED OUT

279
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
OVER THIS.

280
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,200
>>RIGHT, AND THERE'S ALSO ONE
OTHER COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE,

281
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,140
AND IT'S ABOUT JUST THE OPTICS
OF EVERYTHING GOING ON RIGHT

282
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,380
NOW.

283
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,460
YOU SAY YOU AGREE A LITTLE
MORE WITH TRUMP'S STRATEGY OR

284
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,670
FOREIGN POLICY, BUT REMEMBER,
THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE IS THAT

285
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,440
TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A STRATEGY OR
A FOREIGN POLICY.

286
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,490
SO THE

287
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,650
INTERNATIONAL, YOU KNOW, TO
OTHER COUNTRIES, RIGHT, TO OUR

288
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,370
ALLIES, TO OTHER PLAYERS, THEY
LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT

289
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,750
NOW, AND HOW IS ANYONE GOING TO
TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE AT ITS

290
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,750
WORD?

291
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,320
HOW IS ANYONE GOING TO
EXPECT ANY TYPE OF STABILITY

292
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,590
WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S

293
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,590
DOING?

294
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,700
HE CHANGES HIS MIND
DAY-TO-DAY, ESPECIALLY ON BIG

295
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,280
ISSUES LIKE SYRIA.

296
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,730
I MEAN, TWO
FRIDAYS AGO WE WERE DOING A

297
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,250
STORY ABOUT HOW HE WANTS TO PULL
OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, TAKE

298
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,600
THE TROOPS OUT AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE, AND THE FOLLOWING

299
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,690
FRIDAY HE'S DROPPING BOMBS AND
GETTING MORE INVOLVED, SO HE'S

300
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,070
JUST WING THIS DAY BY DAY AND
CHANGING HIS MIND, AND WHILE

301
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,910
NIKKI HALEY IS MAKING STATEMENTS
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ALREADY

302
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,510
RENEGED ON, THINK ABOUT HOW THAT
LOOKS TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

303
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,911
>>THAT'S A GREAT POINT, ONE
LAST POINT OF CLARIFICATION, YOU

304
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:15,220
ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

305
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,580
TRUMP DOES
NOT HAVE A STRATEGY.

306
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,600
HE DOES NOT

307
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
HAVE A POLICY.

308
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,530
HE DOESN'T HAVE A
POLICY ON ANYTHING.

309
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,530
SO I AGREE

310
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,060
WITH THE RESULT OF HIS INSTINCT
OF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, I DON'T

311
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,820
WANT TO GET MIRED IN SYRIA.

312
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
THAT'S WHAT I AGREE WITH.

313
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I

314
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,850
DON'T WANT TO PUSH INTO SYRIA
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUSH TOWARD

315
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,850
MORE WAR.

316
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,051
NOW, HAVING SAID THAT,
THE MIXED MESSAGES WE ARE

317
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:41,320
SENDING TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
IS INSANITY.

318
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
BECAUSE THEY ARE

319
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,370
JUST SITTING BACK GOING, WAIT,
HOW DO I REACT?

320
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,690
BECAUSE FIRST OF

321
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,940
ALL WHENEVER ANY TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAYS

322
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,260
SOMETHING I HAVE TO WAIT, I HAVE
TO WAIT UNTIL TRUMP TWEETS ABOUT

323
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,040
IT. IS IT TRUE OR NOT?

324
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,310
BECAUSE
THIS GUY IS A TOTAL FRICKIN'

325
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,440
CLOWN, SO HE DOESN'T EVEN
COMMUNICATE TO HIS OWN U.N.

326
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,490
AMBASSADOR, HE HAD TO TELL REX
TILLERSON TO STOP NEGOTIATIONS

327
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,940
WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH HE THEN
RESTARTED AND BRAGGED ABOUT

328
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,120
AFTER FIRING TILLERSON, SO NO
ONE HAS ANY IDEA WHAT IS GOING

329
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,740
ON BECAUSE TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON.

330
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,850
TO ANA'S POINT NOT ONLY IS HE
CHANGING THE STANCE HIS
