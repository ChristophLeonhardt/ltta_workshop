President Trump has said once again that the Russia collusion investigation is a hoax by disgruntled Democrats but this time the Democrats have finally admitted he's right Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said quote I guess we might as well come clean we were a little down after the election and we thought this would lighten the mood we didn't think anyone would believe us I guess the joke just

so UT Austin and then before that I was Grand Canyon University and the audiences were just great and really friendly and terrific and I have to tell you that when you meet conservative students they are several IQ points ahead of left-wing students I mean I will show you some left-wing students on the show today and I will tell you but these kids are so impressive and so dialed in and knowledgeable and and thoughtful and it really is you know for someone like me who's gonna shuffle off the scene and about oh and give myself about 30 minutes you know it's nice to know that people will be behind fighting the corner who are just so able to do it but the thing that really disturbs me is again and again you know we do these q and A's and again and again somebody stands up and says you know my teacher does this my you know they won't let me talk they attack me they threaten me to take my grades away and make me go to region if I say things like men and women are the same I just keep hearing these stories I there was one high school kid there who said he is being forced to walk out for an anti Second Amendment demonstration and he doesn't agree but he's being forced to walk out and another kid who says you know and they and they can never get the good security I mean at Austin they did they had the police out there and everything and that weren't needed but they were there but they can't get good rooms for the events just all kinds of things and I started to think about this you know when I went in and made this speech I was just as I was walking in it was kind of about Hollywood in the way they controlled the narrative as I was walking and I start to think about The Truman Show remember The Truman Show The Truman Show was Jim Carrey and he played a guy whose entire life is a a reality TV show only he doesn't know it so he's in this town and the town looks like a real little town but it's actually a TV set and all his friends and his wife were actually actors and it's a profitable show so they want to keep it on the air but they have to keep him in this town because if he leaves the town then he finds out that it's all a fraud and so what they do is from his earliest childhood they scare him so they every time he tries to get away or do something they have they dissuade him from adventure they dissuade him from challenges they say don't go over the bridge Truman you don't know what's gonna be over there don't go on vacation when there's one very funny scene where he goes into a travel agent and you know how the travel agents have posters on the walls he's sunny Florida and all this stuff instead posters of airplanes keeping it by lightning and it just says this could happen to you so they just terrify him all the time here's a brief scene of Carrie you know trying to get his wife to just leave and go on an adventure and how there she her job is to dissuade him and she does get away see some of the world explore you wanna be annexed this will pass we all think like this now and then you know it's it's a very it's a really good movie I actually like and I remembered really well which doesn't always happen with movies and I started to think that's what these people that's what these professors are doing to these kids basically they're teaching them to live in a fake world a world where socialism works world where America is a bad country a world where racism is really still as big a problem as it always was and when the kids try to escape what they stood them is they frightened them they say don't listen to those ideas those ideas are fascist don't go don't let that speaker come to campus that guys and white supremacists you know don't don't even think about that you know that don't have free speech because you know they say they say well you know up language language is violence which is like saying dirt is air you know I mean it's like if you're talking you're not fighting I mean that's one of the wonderful things about talking and and they just create they've created this false environment this false philosophical world and they just keep the narrative of fear up this Starbucks thing that's happening is a perfect example we're in a country of 300 million people the fact that two kids got two guys got turfed from a coffee shop is not a news story it's not a news story it wasn't about race it was about the fact that they were misbehaving they shouldn't have been there they were breaking the rules they didn't go along with what the police said the police come in and they say sir leave the building you leave the building you want to complain later you complain to the force but you don't tell the cop they're not gonna leave and then expect not to get arrested it is just creating this narrative of fear that something terrible is going on in a country when nothing terrible is going on I mean it's this is obviously nobody's perfect no country is perfect it's not it has nothing to do with that but in real life things are going pretty well in fact in fact if two guys being turfed from a starbucks is a new story things are going great you know things are going great that means that like people aren't being blown up it means that people aren't killing each other means that the economy's humming along if you're covering two guys were asked to leave Starbucks Donald Trump is doing a fan-freakin'-tastic job that's what that's what you should be saying that's what Trump should be saying the instructor should be saying if that's what you're covering if that's your news story so you know I was it's just you know somebody called this the guys at fire called the unlearning Liberty there unlearning how to be free how to talk free and I just the other day at see you in City University of New York School of Law is called CUNY School of Law there was a speaker and I call it a law professor named Josh Blackman and he went in to give a speech on the importance of free speech on campus because they didn't like some of his opinions these social justice warriors I can't even I hate even so she there were justice with these kids but like they show up and they start demonstrating against him because he I think he was in favor he said it was right for Trump to rescind the daca order because it wasn't legal these are law these are kids in law school right these are not undergrads these are kids in law school and Blackman as you will see is as mild-mannered as is possible to be and he goes in and he gives this speech and he's talking to them about why he thinks it was right to rescind daca because it was against the law listen to this exchange every member of Congress I would vote for the dream and my position is that the pulps need selfie cannot consist in the world which teaches a lesson right the lesson exists or you can support something as a matter of policy but then find that the law doesn't permit it and then the answer is to change the law a lot that's a very good thing school right and it's bizarre things you can be anywhere right now and you chose to come out here and exercise your constitutional rights F the law that's what they were shouting at him F the law and he said F the law that's wonderful you're in law school right and they see if the girl has a sign that says free speech is not a shield for hate which in fact it is part of what defines us is what we ate and we can speak about what we hate and you know if it defines us in a way that's ugly well then don't like us then you know you can read you can reject people but they're not letting him speak now he so he talked about the rule of law and I want you to listen to the logic of this one kid we're talking about the Truman Show right we're talking about kids or living in a false America an America that doesn't exist an America that was built for TV so the TV can sell a narrative of racism and trouble that will get Democrats elected here they are they are living in the Truman Show America okay and they have to be kept afraid and I want you to listen to the logic of this kid as he responds to professor Blackman talking about the rule of law now let me just pause here for a minute I'm Blackman explains this himself but I won't put this in the reason we talked about the rule of law and the reason I talk about the rule of law on the border that it's not about whether a guy's Mexican or not is about the rule of law is that if you don't have the rule of law then it's capricious right it's who is it's whether you know you have a billion dollars then you get treated one way you don't have that money get treated another way we have a nation of laws not of men I think it was John Adams who said that because because that means we're all equal before the law if the laws don't count then who decides what happens on any given day it's like every given day is different okay so he talks about the rule wall listen to this kids logic preferring to because that actually invokes messages as law and order probably ganda created by Roger stone promoted for Nixon and trying to get the Reagan and any once again here we go at romp so whenever you're saying that you're bringing that into an isolated moment in time but it is sort of lean it goes back to the 30s when people were killed based on a certain kind of propaganda so whenever you say rule applaud it invokes a lot of like reactive emotion so I would say it was probably better to choose a different kind of language so that you don't things like that because then you're also accountable and responsible reason the other thing that has that weight that kid should be kicked out of school I mean you should be kicked out so his logic was his logic was when you say rule of law it reminds him of law and order and people he doesn't like like Nixon used to sell law and order and law and order maybe got people killed in the 30s when people were calling for law and order so you're responsible for people getting killed under the guise of law and order because you said rule of law I mean that you know that's like saying you know you said rule of law that reminds me of Law & Order Law & Order as a television show I'm Sam Waterson you know I mean that's the watch he's using and now it's obvious bullying it's obviously a kind of emotional bullying you you said that do you better be careful of every word you say because every word you say gets people killed it's obviously a kind of emotional bullying but it also is his fear it's the kids fear it is the Truman Show do not step out of this little box and discover that the America we taught you about the America that will get the people we want elected the America that gives us power and prestige isn't real it's not there it is about people posing in Starbucks on YouTube and people going on and discourse saying about that as if that were important because it's not because if they can get you to believe that this is a racist country where you're in danger when you go into a Philadelphia Starbucks which must be filled with all kinds of people of all kinds of colors and of course the universe the university is only where it starts and only where people learn to accept this stuff it's only where they go to unlearn Liberty and live in this fake world in California they are proposing now an sent a bill there's a bill before the assembly that would make it an unlawful business practice to engage in a transaction intended to result or that results in the sale or lease of goods I'm reading this from the law lease of goods or services to any consumer that engage in sexual orientation change efforts that includes books and counseling so if I give somebody the Bible and I tell them you know before you live the sexual life you're living you might want to look at this book and learn a thing or two California wants to make that illegal now I don't believe that's ever gonna stand before the Supreme Court but just the fact that they do it lets you know something it lets you know that wherever the left takes power they become tyrants wherever the left takes power they become times why because they're living in a false world you don't have to be a tyrant when you're telling the truth you don't have to force beat people up if I say to somebody if I say to somebody I am a man this sentence I am a man I don't care if the person says you are a girl you are a black woman you know what do I care what do I care but if I say to somebody I am a black woman I've got to stop them from saying the obvious you know it's pretty obvious to me that you're a white man right I've got to stop them from saying it as long as you're living in a fake universe you have got to have that silence Hillary Clinton I mean let's take this all the way to the top right we're first we're talking about universities now we're talking abouts in the state of California but let's talk it tell you take it all the way to the woman who was just this close to being President of the United States and the reason that I have never lost a night's sleep not one for debt voting for Donald Trump is exactly this Hillary was obsessed with Citizens United right with overturning the Supreme Court decision that said that my pal David bossy who runs this little film industry Citizens United could make a film against Hillary he made a film against Hillary they tried to ban it on the basis that it was illegal campaign spending the Supreme Court they said it's corporate spending because citizens united was the name of a corporation the Supreme Court said no you know he's bossy doesn't lose his right to criticize both people politically because he's a corporation they made a movie celebrating Hillary Clinton this is Hillary Clinton's movie I'm going to play Hillary Clinton's movie where they celebrated the fact that she was out to get citizens united and it's a woman named Christina shake I guess it's pronounced was a Hillary you know staffer and she makes this movie she explains you don't understand you don't understand how shocking this was citizens united started because someone attacked Hillary I mean it's amazing listen to her what I think that people don't really realize a Citizens United has actually started from a conservative organization that wanted to bring down Hillary Clinton's candidacy because they didn't like who she is I don't like what she stands for it it started with Hillary the movie a negative political documentary about then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton the government blocked it from TV last year because it was made with corporate money and they took that fight all the way the Supreme Court the Supreme Court today struck down restrictions on political spending Citizens United changed our democracy at its core the most powerful and most connected American corporations and special interests and had the right to spend as much money as they wanted to to get elected candidates that they thought best represented their agenda this was a video made by people who didn't like what Hillary stood for and so didn't want you to vote for that's called democracy and on top of it it's all a sham because Hillary Clinton raised twice as much money as Donald Trump did some of Donald Trump's money came from his own pocket like 66 million dollars worth of it and his donors Clinton's campaign receive 16 percent of its money in donations of $200 or less so from people Trump's campaign received 26% a quarter of his was coming from little folks sending in 200 bucks when I say little I just mean that they have the kind of money that a corporation has so she was the corporate candidate it was all a scam it was all about the fact it was all about the fact that they actually do think it is an evil that someone would stand against Hillary Clinton and what she stands for and tried to stop her they actually thought that was suppressible speech it is an amazing worldview and why because living in this fake universe where anybody who disagrees with them must be must be evil or else or else they have to look at the world in a new way they have to leave hoot room the Truman universe I mean I just was this was just yesterday and it's kind of an unimportant little cut but it just gives you a glimpse of the point of view all that everybody who can is piling on Sean Hannity because he didn't say that he knew Michael Kohn and khun's Donald Trump's attorney and had consulted him a couple of times and I said you know he probably should have done that strategically that would have been the strategic thing to do but if he had a couple of legal questions about real estate that he asked Michael Kohn I don't think it's anybody's business and certainly doesn't change where he was he was gonna stand does anybody think that Sean Hannity we say I'm listen I'm only supporting Donald Trump because I asked a real estate question of Michael Kohn I think we know that sean hannity supports Donald Trump you know so I think this is it's completely ridiculous given the fact that unlike Sean who is a commentator all these objective news guys are tied in with the Democratic Party hip and thigh you know they're just completely in with the Democratic Party and their supposed supposed to be objective Sean isn't even supposed to be objective so they're beating up on him and this is Anderson Cooper and a panel and you just will just play the gut it's amazing there is a conflict for Fox News because I mean obviously during the day they have you know you know folks like Shepard Smith Bret Baier you know who are doing reporting and yet you know the night time is much more opinion based yeah it's almost too convenient to say that oh no no no we're going to use a kind of a nuanced semantics argument I mean I'm an opinion journalist not actually a journalist I'm not to be regarded and have the credibility as others but please believe every single word that I say wait wait so she's expressing her opinion that opinions are no good on news shows that's what she's doing geez and the reason I played that is what's so telling about it is that she doesn't know it's an opinion she doesn't know the difference I mean first of all Sean Hannity would never say believe every word I say he's of an opinion journalist he knows that people are not going to agree with him but she's she actually they don't actually think their opinions are opinions and they don't actually think that their worldview is challengeable and the fact that Shawn gets up there and is a very very powerful voice for Trump in trumpism and Trump that's what they're bothered by it's that people aren't list or listening to his opinion more than they're listening to their opinion which too in their mind isn't an opinion I mean it really is it's even part of this Russia collusion thing it is part of the mindset that goes into this rut Russia collusion thing that somehow Trump's victory the victory of the people in the Midwest the victory of the people who were overlooked during eight years of Obama it's somehow this is illegal somehow this is criminal I mean Trump Trump went off on them again yesterday let's let's just play that cut and we'll wrap this up but Trump went off on them again yesterday there was this atmosphere of shock Trump goes wee on a rampage on a rant against it listen to what he says this was a really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss which is a loss that frankly they shouldn't have had from the standpoint that it's very easy for them they have a tremendous advantage in the electoral college and this is what it is and this is where it came from you look at the kind of money that was paid probably some went to Russia you look at Podesta having a company in Russia where nothing happened and people don't talk about it you look at the fact that their server the DNC server was never gotten by the FBI why did the FBI take it the FBI takes what they want they go in they wouldn't get the server this is a hoax as far as the investigation nobody has ever been more transparent than I have instructed our lawyers be totally transparent he's basically right I mean he's basically right this has gone on for over a year with no evidence of any kind of collusion the whole idea was kind of stupid to begin with you know that's basically ten you know rocky and bullwinkle of spies trying to put out propaganda on youtube who didn't even know what they were doing it didn't have any effect on the election at all the whole thing is utterly absurd but but when you were living in a Truman world when you were living in a fake world you have got to keep everybody frightened you've got to keep everybody afraid so that they don't go off the reservation and find out where reality lies I mean let read a couple of your letters here I went a little long but let me read a couple of year letters I asked the question last week what do you want what what are the things what do you stand for because this is something that always bothers me you know it's easy to say well the other guy did this and the other guy did that but what do you stand for it wouldn't really struck me was how similar the responses were I mean they really were similar so I won't read too many but here's one from Ray I says I want the government to shrink back towards its original size and only deal with the military I want basically all the government entitlements to be removed for anyone 50 and under if you are 50 or under you'll never get benefits just kill it all out right and I want all weapons to be legalized as the founding fathers originally intended from David freedom for heterosexuals to pursue their dreams and ambitions without being judged or without judging others freedom for homosexuals to pursue their dreams and ambitions without feeling the need to champion their sexuality in gay rights and gay gay right parade freedom for all to express their ideas without condemnation or feeling the need to attack others for not sharing the same ideas from Joseph recognition and the education that men and women are different so relationships with two men are different than those with a man and woman ensure the protection protection that religions can embrace or condemn homosexuality however they want the right of states to define contracts that they grant including marriage contracts from Lee as for government flat-tax the federal government gets out of everything not explicitly in the Constitution easy peasy as for the gays ha he says I'm not as good that means I want I want government out of marriage marriage is traditionally defined is what leads or can lead to a family that counts them out excluding adoption which i think should not be allowed seeing as how children need both male and female role models I suppose they could find some church to marry them as for the policing of morality in general it's a bit trickier especially for a Catholic like me all laws are based on a morality of some sort or at least a perceived morality unless usually we decide what to police based on the amount of externalities not sure what that means but that's that's what he says so I guess it comes down to where we draw the line on externalities where we draw the line on allowing self-destructive behaviors from Dan when I think about this question I always go to the preamble to the Constitution because I can't remember the whole Constitution but I can remember the preamble which tells us what government is supposed to do 1 establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility this means the rule of law applies fairly and equally without preference to anyone and the police are keepers of the peace provide to provide for the common defense this means securing borders and maintaining an effective military 3 promote the general welfare secure the blessings of liberty this means the free marketplace and allowing everyone to do as they want and encouraging moral and ethical behavior but not mandating any particular worldview from Joey in regards with merit to marriage I want Uncle Sam fully out of it a lot of people said this taxes as individuals henceforth and allow churches and captain some married couples I want political correctness gone since it is just a bully technique against speech disguised as kindness I want to be in charge of my own health care from Veronica three things I want government out of marriage free speech season two of another Kingdom uh-huh from Shawna here are the three things I want from the government I want the law enforced equally and no laws change from the bench I want to be able to protect myself but I also want the government to protect my private property regarding gays religiously I don't think the relationship should be recognized as it is against the Bible politically I'm not sure but I do get angry when I hear about gay couples suing Christian bakeries out of business so do i I think that is incredibly fascist and bullying one more from AJ I want church and society truly separated from the state marriage should not be defined by the government as an example my wife and I are more than willing to sacrifice our government benefits as a married couple to fix this too I want the freedom to protect my family and my property in any way I deem necessary without infringing on the constitutional rights of others and three I want a government that doesn't try to control my life with a life of my family on a daily basis fortunately I was able to enroll my children in a charter school which helps really very big common theme leave us alone leave us alone and now you know if you mean that if you mean that it means it might mean giving up some benefits you know I mean that's the thing and I because I completely agree I mean this is this is why I don't know why everybody yells at me about this like all I want is for people to be left for me to be left alone and that means I have to leave you alone and that's really all I'm talking about I don't I do not understand why this upsets people so much but we'll find out cuz we're gonna do another interview with another theologian about sexuality these came together and I'm glad they did because people have been really interested in this and will follow this through and then we'll move on to other subjects like you know my sexual this guy this is a man named Alastair Roberts he's the co-author of the book echoes of Exodus tracing themes of redemption through Scripture he wrote it along with Andrew Wilson dr. Roberts earned his PhD from Durham University and he's also one of the participants in the mere fidelity podcast dr. Roberts is a fellow of Scripture and theology with the Greystone theological Institute and writes for the political theology Network that blog by the way Maher fidelity is really interesting and provocative and intelligently written one of the reasons we asked dr. Roberts to come on here is my interview with Alastair Roberts professor Roberts thank you very much for coming on I appreciate it thank you you know I'm I am for a conservative incredibly libertarian about questions of sex I'm a faithful husband and I would recommend that lifestyle to anybody but if you live a different lifestyle if you're gay if you're you know promiscuous and as long as you're not hurting anybody where's frightening the horses I I it's none of my business convinced me that I'm wrong as Christians I think there's there are two horizons that really shape our view of sex and there's the horizon of the original creation and then there's the horizon of the age to come and in both of those horizons there is an emphasis upon male and female and the significance of our bodies as being means of engaging with the world in a way that honors God so within the original creation the creation of man and woman is a creation for the sake of the the wider world were not just created for our own pleasure to enjoy ourselves in relationship with each other but to serve the wider reality of the creation so when think about the relationship between men and women it's a relationship that is generative for the structures of society for the structures of the family for the structures of the generations from one generation to another and it's something that fills and forms our social life and so within traditional societies as they've recognized marriage it's not merely been about a couple of people who enjoy each other and the celebration of their sexual intimacy rather it's a celebration of a formative relationship for society as a whole for human life in the creation and for a means of reflecting God's own creative rule within the world as God forms and fills his creation and so that emphasis is one that we bear out within the celebration of marriage not just the celebration of individuals and intimacy but of a relationship that has a generative character to it and as also as a result of that I think a particular form of the discipline of hospitality it's a means by which we take the world into our lives and also a means by which we go out into the world and bring life out into it and so the sanctioning of a particular sexual union is about that it's about not just this private bond that exists in the bedroom but about something that is formative and generative of life for the world and also a means by which two people in there love together have a form of relationship that by its very nature is ordered to the inviting and welcoming of others into the world you know I've never heard that argument before the last part the hospitality argument I've never heard that argument before and the immediate objection that comes up is are we to be unwelcoming to people who are different we're gay who live a different kind of life well I think the first thing to talk about is what exactly is marriage and when we're thinking about marriage is this particular form of hospitality is one thing to ask the question of whether we should accept same-sex relationships it's another thing to say whether those should be recognized as marital I think that quest second question is the one that we should focus upon primarily and I think when we've realized the character of marriage or something is ordered towards this bearing of life ordered towards this movement out into the world this opening up to the other sex and opening up in some ways to our own sex because what it means to be male or female is something that's always played out against the horizon of the other sex and that practice of hospitality is something that is unique to this particular sort of Union it's one of the reasons why marriage has always been surrounded by regulations and norms that prevent you from just choosing it as whatever form you want to have it because it's the recognition that this is a union that does not exist merely for the sake of the people in it it exists for the sake of the wider society and for the children that are welcomed into that bond the the problem that people the way these arguments frequently tend to go is that one person is arguing as you're arguing now from a series of principles and from the idea of the society and the other person is coming to us and saying you know I'm not attracted to women i but I want an intimate life I want a sexual life are you telling me that I have to I mean it let's face it the intimate life is one of the great consolations of living knowing this is what are the things that gives us joy and here is this fellow coming to you and saying well wherever I am this is the only way I can have that life are you telling me that that has to be absent from my existence well one of the difficulties I think we have with in the modern world when talking about a Christian view of marriage is that the modern world is ordered around the pursuit of pleasure and the suit pursuit of happiness an individual fulfillment the Christian practice of marriage has never been primarily about that the Christian practice of marriage has been about a discipline that is we find great fulfillment in but it is something that involves it is very hard sacrifice a laying down of your life for the sake of someone else and for a placing of your individual ends the ends with which you enter into the union of marriage perhaps for your own pleasure and laying down of those the sake of something greater the union that can be formed through the mutual sacrifices on behalf of others and that is something that is not just a matter of individual fulfillment now when we have a culture that's built around individual fulfillment the question that you raise is the one that will be prominent within our minds if we think that what it means to be married is merely about my individual satisfaction having a successful sexual sex life or whatever we might want to talk about does then the reasons why we would distinguish between a same-sex couple and male and female couple are not going to be obvious to people because sex becomes a means of self fulfillment it's about my identity is about my self-realization rather than about a means by which an individual can enter into a relationship that propels them into something beyond themselves into the creation of a reality that is hospitable to children as they're born into the world and also that opens them up to the horizon of the other sex now the reason we celebrate marriage so much is our society or traditional societies is because we recognize the importance of that particular thing it is more than about individual fellowship it's about our responsibilities and the claims that other people have upon us now within a society of individuality that's difficult for us to understand because we all think of ourselves as individuals trying to sell fulfill but marriage is about one flesh Union it's about moving out beyond ourselves transcending ourselves in a relationship that where others make claims upon us and that's difficult we're bound up with other people in their lives and we don't get to choose the terms on which and this plays out we don't have a bespoke practice of marriage everyone has to practice this particular form of marriage which is designed to be hospitable to the various parties in it not just to serve my individual self fulfillment and so that question that you raised is an important one for our society but it's also important to understand why that would not raised in the same way in past societies I know you you've talked about the attempt to abolish the difference between the sexes the abolition of male and female and I don't think anyone can question there's a segment of our society it's working very hard on this that wants to think that's to think there's either that there's no difference between men and women or that you can transcend your physical presence in some weird way to ideas which are mutually contradictory if there's no difference between men and women I've never understood how you if you were a man in a woman's body how you would even know I how it would even occur to but what I what interests me is why do you think this is going on why do people want to abolish what for me is one of the chief Goods and joys and graces of human life why what where does that instinct come from to aracely's in there a number of causes we live in a very unusual society and in that the natural sort of interaction between men and women has been changed considerably by modern life whereas the family used to be a cent and the home in the household used to be a center of gravity of human existence for millennia is no longer that anymore many of the functions of the family have been outsourced to other things whether that's household appliances education systems the government in certain forms of provision and even work the family used to be the site where you'd used to do most of your labor whereas now you do that in your business or some other place of work and so as a result the family becomes very much a sort of sentimental reservation where you go and you enjoy your domesticity your life together in the sentimental attachments that you have and when it lacks that significance I can understand why there's a threat particularly for women who feel that they are going to be trapped within that realm and so the realm of self-fulfillment the realm of individual meaning is a realm of well well it has become a realm of individuality not a realm of common labour towards a shared reality that we're forming around ourselves and male and female in relationship forming a home and a world that is their own now it increasingly becomes a matter of going out to a job earning money and they're bringing that back into the home as a site primarily of consumption and so I think that has shaped things considerably and further factors things like contraception and the pill it means that there is no longer a sense in which the relationship between men and women is naturally sexual relationship is naturally ordered towards procreation and so increasingly it does not have the weight that it has on that account that weight has resisted so where in the past you talk about responsible sex being marital sex sex that provides for the potential consequences of a relationship now safe sex is sex that is contraceptive sex sex that avoids any possibility of conception and so as a result of these I think we have a situation where the dignity and the honor of men and women is increasingly seen as individuals within a society that is detached from their relationships that's a realm of career that sort of thing and so the need to cut yourself off from the distinctions that male and female naturally create in what it means to be human I think that's that's one that's pressing for us I've compared this to the situation where human beings as astronauts are shot into space and they experience seven Dawn's in a single day and it sets their sleep pattern awry there we're not intended to live like that the circadian rhythm is balanced to the ER is related to the Earth's pattern of day and night then you have things like the disorientation of not knowing which way is up and which way is down and then also things like your muscles deteriorating because you do not have the Earth's gravity to act on there and as a result of all of this as we have been propelled into this sort of zero gravity or microgravity realm of modern society to find dignity often we feel the need to resist the residual gravity of what it means to be male and female that pulls upon us and prevents from achieving that equal equal outcomes within the realm of just autonomous power let me ask you this because it seems to me that this can only go further whether you want to say it's worse or better the there will come a time I assume when you can change a man into a woman now that technology is so bad that you can protest that it's damaging to people but I'm sure they'll come a time when they can do that when children can be had outside those can be when wombs will be separate from human beings what is there a danger that arguments like this are arguments that attach values to matter to material it is is there a danger that at some point we begin to seem like the Amish we begin to seem like we're just refusing the blessings of technology or is there an argument for remaining human even in the face of technology that lifts us above humanity yes that's a it's an important question I think it's one that a number of Christian thinkers have wrestled with one very helpful book on the subject is the abolition of man by CS Lewis another one begotten or made by Allah bro Donovan and both of these are exploring certain aspects of what it means to be human in the face of technological and scientific advances so for instance Lewis's recognition that nature is what we have we ascribe to nature what we have technical control over and the more that we gain technical control over our nature the more we kind of carve off elements of ourselves and assign them to this dead objective order whereas in the past we'd see them very much as things to be cultivated through the development of character now we can have we increasingly become victims of our instinctive whims because we've not cultivated a nature we're just gaining technical control over the world in which we live and increasingly over our being now I think in many of the debates that we're having at the moment about things like same-sex marriage transgender issues there is an incipient transhumanism at work the belief that we can transcend humanity in various forms and so whereas you have the social change of something like same-sex marriage there is behind that social change series of technical changes that are on the horizon so the ability to have gametes from skin cells will be able to have a child formed of two fathers for instance an egg form from male skin cell then will be able to form children in an artificial womb gestate in that sort of environment we'll be able to have em genetic screening of a of an embryo and then decide whether to discard it or to pursue its all the way towards pregnancy all the way to full cause for pregnancy these are the sorts of things that are on the horizon that implicitly we have accepted as a result of that logic and so I think as Christians one of the things that all abroad and urban emphasizes is that as Christians the dignity of the human being that we uphold is bound up with the fact that we are begotten not just made we're not a project that has been formed through technical activity but we believe that human beings have their dignity in part because they are begotten not through them it's not as if parents get together and they engage in a scientific project to form their child rather their children are formed out of a personal love that they share and is out of the love that they share that that child organically arises is conceived out of the result as a result of something that's prior to any political arrangement prior to any legal organization part prior to any technical intervention prior to any medical and procedure that reality of the bond of male and female bodies is something that gives dignity to us it means that my identity for instance is my origins are found not in some choice on behalf of my parents but in the love that they shared the bond that they shared between them and so that movement I think is one in which we can become untethered from our basic humanity if we end up pursuing it too far human beings become their own creations I have to stop you there I'm out of time but I really appreciate a fascinating conversation I hope you'll come back we can continue it some more really interested very thoughtful guy and I am gonna read that book I'm gonna put it in my in my list sorry stuff I like I got a hurry people have been sending in a new theme song so we're gonna we're gonna start go through some of the things we've sent in and choose one I guess for the stuff I like theme you know when I started stuff I like I did it because I've been so shaped by the great works of Western literature that I wanted to share them and I started to realize that some people were not as committed to reading them as I was and so I've kind of broadened it to talk about all those kind of things that are on TV and in the movies and all that stuff and but I want to go back to something one of the great writers of American literature and but guy who's kind of under read by by people who aren't committed to literature because he's a little bit difficult but not everything he writes is difficult there's a book that I love called after virtue I've mentioned it several times a book of philosophy by Alastair MacIntyre and he talks about the end of the idea of morality and ethics and one of the quotes in it he says is the difference between a human relationship uninformed by morality and one informed by morality is the difference between one in which each person treats the other as a means to his or her ends when one in which he treats the other as an end in himself right to treat someone else as an end and himself is to offer them what I take to be good reasons for acting in one way rather than another but to leave it to them to evaluate those reasons right that's weak that's free speech if I take you as an end in yourself I try to convince you but I let you alone to make the decision right but but if you don't believe in a moral order to treat someone else you treat someone else as a means it's to seek to make him or her an instrument of your purposes okay I'm going through this quickly but the point is the manipulation is what you have left when you don't believe there's a moral order and that's what we've been talking about today is the attempts to manipulate college students if you want to read a beautiful writer on this subject on the subject of the way people manipulate each other Henry James is one of the greatest of American novelists kind of a Mary I should call him an Anglo American because he later became a British subject and he writes very much like an Englishman many of his later books are very differ many people like portrait of a lady which is about this subject and Alastair MacIntyre mentions it in the book but if you want to read just something short read the aspirin papers as well as my favorite short stories is kind of a novella the aspirin papers by Henry James if you want to see what happens when people lose their moral sense and lose the sense that you are an end in yourself deserving of your opinions deserving to be convinced but not forced deserving to be negotiated with and talked with and and elevated in yourself and when you become like the leftists who think you are just there to be manipulated just there as a means to an end to a higher end if you put anything above the the soul the spirit of a man you just start to manipulate him and the aspirin papers is one of the most beautiful works about manipulation there is it is so imbued with both suspense and character and morality it's just Anna lovely lovely piece of writing Henry James the aspirin papers try it and if you read it and you get a chance drop me a line let me know what you thought I'm Andrew Clavin is that's it it's the Clavin this weekend yeah you're lost sorry but what
