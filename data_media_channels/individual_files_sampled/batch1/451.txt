there's an uneasy atmosphere in the ward the patients aren't pain but is the silent worry of those around them that is most striking menara the hoodie cannot contain his despair he has three sons all three maimed during the protest yet is the last one to be injured and his condition is the most worrying he has already lost his left leg in an accident a few years ago now his right one is at risk he lost his leg because of the two government's we have one would agree to transfer him the other would refuse I call on anyone who cares about us please help me get my son out of Gaza he needs treatment please help me save this leg Ahmed lays in the next bed in agonizing pain his mother is angry at all parties living in Gaza is like living in a sealed box she says they only care about themselves Ayman was among the first to arrive at the hospital on Friday it was early in the day many more would follow the sheer number of injured putting stress on an already fragile system dr. Ayman Saheb Annie SEZ is now bursting at the seams we declared a state of emergency ambulances were carrying three or four patients at a time we had 300 cases in one day there's 15 times more than the capacity of the emergency unit and we've used all our stock most injuries are in the lower part of the body external fixators for limbs antibiotics anesthesia and other necessities have run out or are in short supply getting anything into Gaza requires a lengthy and complicated process under normal circumstances the health system suffers from shortages about half of the drugs needed and 1/3 of the equipment are lacking but the situation gets even further complicated by political developments seventeen-year-old muhammad a sports lover was told that nothing more could be done here in gaza the archer in his leg is torn and he's losing a lot of blood he needs to be transferred to the occupied West Bank the hospital there is waiting the paperwork is done but the Israelis won't allow him to make the journey no one has been able to get out since the protests began yad listens from afar tears rolled down his cheek and hope is all but gone my fella a little better there's no solution each time they make us dream of reconciliation it fails my generation is lost the one after me is too that's why we go to the fence to express the misery we live in it's that sense of hopelessness that continues to draw the youth towards the border fence many might come back on a stretcher some will never fully recover without their Hamad Al Jazeera Gaza
