we begin with what was day 484 of the Trump administration and the president's new attacks on the FBI stepping up the pressure on the bureau and the Justice Department as part of his latest moves to cast doubt on the entire Russia investigation as led by Robert Muller today the President issued these messages raising the possibility of a government informant who was inside the 2016 campaign quote apparently the DOJ put a spy in the Trump campaign this has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit not long after that there was this reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president it took place very early on and long before the phony Russia hoax became a hot fake news story if true all-time biggest political scandal here's how Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani responded this morning when asked about the president's allegations now here's the here's the issue that I really feel strongly about what this informant if there is one first of all I don't know for sure notice the president if there really was one we're told that hold that by whom but told that by people for a long time we've been told that this something was some kind of infiltration at one time the president thought it was a wiretap there were there were there were some Pfizer applications but we've never been notified that he was on a tap or an intercept he may try not to be closer to the truth than people thought because if there we're told there were two infiltrations two embedded people in the campaign and now when you say you were told just let's clear the record you mean you are gleaning this from the reporting that's out there no the reporting corroborates what people have told us off the record you don't know if they're right or not the point is that the whole the whole investigation is totally legitimate a number of media outlets have reported that in the early stages of the FBI inquiry into possible Russian campaign meddling an informant provided intelligence to the CIA and FBI a story out tonight from the New York Times says the bureau used the informant to investigate Russian links to the campaign but not to do any spying The Times reports quote in fact FBI agents sent an informant to talk to two campaign advisers only after they received evidence that the pair had suspicious contacts linked to Russia during the campaign the informant and American academic who teaches in Britain made contact late that summer with one campaign adviser George papadopolis according to people familiar with the matter he also met repeatedly in the ensuing months with the other aide Carter Paige some of the president's supporters in Congress have called for the informant and their exact role to be publicized this week FBI director Chris Rea who was appointed by Donald Trump pushed back human sources in particular who put themselves at great risk to work with us and with our foreign partners have to be able to trust that we're going to protect their identities and in many cases their lives and lives of their families the day that we can't protect human sources is the day the American people start becoming less safe that was important right there the Washington Post has also been working on this story it reports that a secret FBI source for the Russian investigation made contact with three Trump advisers during the campaign the Post reports that quote in mid-july 2016 a retired American professor approached an advisor to Donald Trump's presidential campaign at a symposium about the White House race held at a British university the professor took the opportunity to strike up a conversation with Carter Paige whom Trump had named a few months earlier as a foreign policy adviser the professor was more than an academic interested in American politics he was a longtime US intelligence source in late summer the professor met with Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis for coffee in Northern Virginia offering to provide foreign policy expertise to the Trump effort in September he reached out to George papadopolis an unpaid foreign policy adviser for the campaign in fighting him to London to work on a research paper now it's a lot will grant you that Robert Costa is among the co-authors of that piece we just read you and as a national political reporter for the Washington Post and moderator of Washington week on PBS he has been kind enough on a busy night to join us by telephone Robert I know your job is to report and not contradict but what we just heard from Rudolph Giuliani but I'm looking at my notes he used the word embedded through your reporting was this person embedded in the Trump campaign Brian good to be with you still working on this story it's important to know and we've been the times noticed this but especially in the post story we say we still do not know a lot about what this FBI source was doing who deputized him if anyone within the intelligence community we have no evidence so far and we put this in our story that this FBI source was embedded in the campaign but it is clear based on our reporting through many many sources I wasn't working with my colleagues that this source did brush up against the Trump campaign in various ways meeting with these three Trump campaign advisors and providing information to the federal government a longtime intelligence source that has now been used as part of the Muller investigation in the trade as I understand it there is a huge gulf of difference between someone who is an informant and someone who is a mole we have guests standing by to help us flesh that out how does this appear to differ from this charge we're hearing from Giuliani perhaps lead or abetted by the president that this was a spy effort greater and national significance than Watergate at this point mayor Giuliani and President Trump with their assertions they're functioning with limited knowledge it appears but because by using the word embedded or these kind of words it doesn't really seem to line up with our reporting however we still need to learn a lot more about this source and what we're finding out is that this was not a mall this was not someone who was working inside of the key but this was someone who was learning more about the campaign through meeting and for example we have Sam Clovis it was national co-chairman of the campaign going on record through his lawyer saying that he was very he met with this source this professor for coffee in Northern Virginia in September of the fall of 2016 and yet the source never said anything about meeting up with George papadopolis or Carter page and now looking back Sam Clovis finds that unusual and so we're just trying to piece together the reporting what's important about this story is that we're learning more about the origin of the Russia investigation we knew about the steel dossier but what else and that's what we've been trying to piece together and this FBI source is an important part but there's still much to learn let me ask you one final question it has to do with journalism as a trade as much as your work and that is that your work and the New York Times tonight have walked right up to the line of giving this guy's name out it is not difficult to figure out who it is if you're in the line of work that he is I note that on social media other people have already speculated as to his name if he is outed that burns every conversation he's had going back 15 years how do you approach something like that it's a very delicate situation we know the name as we've put in our story we are aware based on our reporting of who this source is however it has been told to the post and likely to the time that there isn't a risk to different intelligence operation perhaps human risk by putting the name out there The Times published their story first tonight their posts working on it concurrently published soon after and if at this point we have provided the information we have publicly about the source because we have talked to the people who have interacted with that source and we're trying to provide as much public information to readers or curious about the origin of the Russia investigation without causing any kind of danger to human life but you're right Brian journalism is full of nuance and gray areas thank you for the honest answer and thank you at 10 minutes after 11:00 on a Friday night for calling into the broadcast friend of the broadcast Robert Costa from the Washington Post let's bring in the rest of our leadoff panel for a Friday night Josh Gerstein is with us White House reporter for Politico mica o yang is with us an attorney and former staffer for House Intelligence and Armed Services committees and Brian Bennett White House reporter for the LA Times all of them returning to the broadcasts having been guests of ours let's see here where to begin mica I want to read you part of the New York Times reporting and perhaps we'll begin by getting your reaction here according to people this is about Michael Flynn this is buried tonight in the New York Times second-to-last graph according to people with mr. Flynn's familiar with mr. Flynn's visit to the intelligence seminar the source was alarmed by the generals apparent closeness with a Russian woman who was also in attendance the concern was strong enough that it prompted another person to pass on a warning to the American authorities that mr. Flynn could be compromised by Russian intelligence mica it used to be possible to live a life in America and not meet or run into a single Russian in the course of your life in this country does the previous reporting by Bob Kosta does does this paragraph from The New York Times does it all mean anything to you on a larger extent yeah what it shows us that the Russians were very serious about trying to get close to the Trump campaign they knew that he had a serious chance of becoming president and did become president and they were interested in getting as close to his national security advisors as they possibly could now remember general Flynn was also a very senior leader in the US intelligence community before then so he would have been of interest to the Russians even absent the Trump campaign but when you have a Russian woman getting close to him and people worried that he could be compromised potentially for blackmail or other it really raises red flags that has senior intelligence official like that would become close to a Russian Josh we've been anxious to have you on for a number of reasons chief among them the detail you possess about the FBI detail were looking for Muller as folks understand it Muller under the special council regs gets to use the the mechanism of the federal government to conduct his investigation he is more familiar than most with the inner workings of the FBI having been the second longest-serving director tell us about the men and women working under him well Brian I mean I think there's been sort of a lack of attention to the FBI group that's working with Muller there's been some sensational headlines people know I think about the Peters Strock text messages and and the scandal surrounding those but the question of who's doing the day and day at work and who has for the last year year or so I think has really gotten lost here and so what I tried to do in a story this week is profile a number of the individuals that have been put onto this team helping Muller conduct this investigation a number of them have long-standing ties to some of the other prosecutors on Mulder's team such as Andrew Weissman one of the top FBI agents who's handling this investigation has been working almost 20 years ago met Weissman working on the Enron investigation and then you have all kinds of people drawn from various ranks of the FBI counterintelligence agents business fraud agents people who are computer specialists people that deal with international money laundering issues really a wide variety of people with a lot of different backgrounds some of them coming from business some of them coming from even the movie business believe it or not Brian forgive me for skipping around also forgive me for taking an eye off the journalism business job billboard this week I got your publication wrong by just a few days we're happy to say Brian is now operating under the Time magazine banner having said that I invite you to watch this along with us in our audience this was Sean Hannity from this evening we'll talk about it on the other side this is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal we have seen in the history of this country talk about Watergate this is Watergate on steroids and human growth hormone what is playing out right now is nothing compared to Watergate so Brian there you have it that's the talking point we've seen it now for the better part of 24 hours is this what we can expect more of going into next week yes this is part of a pattern president Trump and his allies like Sean Hannity are trying to undermine molars investigation and undermine the FBI's longtime investigation into the ties between Russian officials and Trump's campaign and so when Trump does things like says that an FBI informant was embedded in his campaign that's an intentional exaggeration of the known facts to try to make it look like there was impropriety and overstepping of bounds when you know what we know based on the reporting from the New York Times and The Washington Post is that this appears to have been an informant who was stepping around the outskirts of the campaign brushing up against people trying to collect information that the people the FBI was interested in to try to glean what kind of connections they may have had to to Russian officials at the time and so you've got this pattern here of President Trump and his allies like Sean Hannity talking about wiretaps in Trump Tower when what publicly known is requests for lifting names inside FISA warrants and and talking about embedding people inside of a campaign when with what's publicly known was much short of that hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
