YOU HAVE A LOT OF VERY
INTERESTING BACKGROUND ABOUT THE
FBI AND CIA, SO WE WILL SEE HOW
IT GOES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.
HERE NOW WITH MORE,
TUCKER CARLSON, A HOST OF
TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.
HE GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA.
IT'S A LEADING INDICATOR.
BROWN.
>> IT'S A RACE OBSESSED PARTY,
IRONICALLY, AND IT DOES NOT
SURPRISE ME.
THE WHOLE BET IN CALIFORNIA IS
THAT CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS WHEN
IT FOR THEM.
AND THEY ARE RIGHT, TO SOME
EXTENT.
IMMIGRATION HAS TURNED IT FROM
ONE OF THE MOST RELIABLY
REPUBLICAN STATES TO THE MOST
RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC STATE.
AT THE QUESTION NOW IS ABOUT THE
ECONOMY, CAN YOU HAVE A STATE
THAT IS BASICALLY LATIN AMERICAN
IN ITS ECONOMIC STRUCTURE?
HUGE POOL OF POOR PEOPLE, NO
MIDDLE CLASS.
THEY ARE PUSHING POLICIES THAT
RESULT IN THAT AND HALF OF ALL
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ASKED THIS
WEEK, THEY SAID THEY PREFERRED
TO LEAVE THE STATE AND A LOT OF
THEM ALREADY HAVE.
WHAT HAPPENS THEN WHEN THERE IS
NO SORT OF NORMAL
MIDDLE-CLASS -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE
MAKING $95,000 LEFT WITH KIDS.
THAT'S WHERE CALIFORNIA IS
GOING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.
>> Martha: IT STRIKING TO ME,
JERRY BROWN HAS BEEN AROUND AS
LONG AS YOU AND I CAN REMEMBER.
I PULLED UP A PICTURE WITH HIM
AND LINDA RONSTADT.
I THOUGHT THAT GUY WAS SO COOL.
I THOUGHT, A TALKER WILL
APPRECIATE SEEING JERRY BROWN
AND BLENDS        LINDA RONSTAD.
BUT ALL THE YOUNGER PEOPLE, THEY
LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND SAY,
WHO IS THE OLD GUY?
WHILE HE'S THE GOVERNOR OF
CALIFORNIA.
BUT HE HAS MADE AN INDELIBLE
MARK ON THE STATE OVER ALL THESE
YEARS AND NOW IT'S THE FIRST
TIME IN 20 YEARS THAT THERE IS
AN OPEN GOVERNOR'S RACE IN
CALIFORNIA.
>> AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM.
THE FUNNY THING IS, AND THIS IS
NOT UNLIKE HOW MUCH THE STATE
HAS CHANGED.
HE PROBABLY PLANTED OPIUM
POPPIES ALONG INTERSTATE FIVE.
>> Martha: HE LIKES THAT
THROWBACK.
>> COMPARED TO WHAT IS ALWAYS A
QUESTION.
SO IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE WHERE
JERRY BROWN IS CONSIDERED
SENSIBLE, IT TELLS YOU, IT LOOKS
LIKE GAVIN NEWSOM, THE FORMER
MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, IS GOING
TO GET IT.
ALSO PRETTY INTERESTING, THE
SAME SPECIES OF PROTECH LIBERAL
WILL BE RUNNING THE STATE.
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY, AND I
TALKED TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA A
LOT, WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE
DEATH OF THE STATES MIDDLE-CLASS
DEATH OF THE STATES MIDDLE-CLAS
MIDDLE-CLASS.
BUT THIS ECONOMIC MODEL DOESN'T
WORK.
EVEN IN THE END, IT COLLAPSES.
YOU NEED A MIDDLE-CLASS TO
SUSTAIN THE ECONOMY, AND THEY
ARE LOSING THEIRS.
>> Martha: A COUPLE THINGS I
WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT, YOU ARE
DOING A SERIES WHICH I THOUGHT
WAS VERY INTERESTING.
IT'S BASICALLY A DEVICE TO
DEPROGRAM AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH IS
POTENTIALLY MAKING US LESS SAFE
EVERY TIME WE GET ON AN
AIRPLANE.
>> IT'S TERRIFYING.
I'M INTERESTED IN THE STANDARDS
IN THEIR DECLINE FOR A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT REASONS, WHERE THE
IDEOLOGY OF DIVERSITY.
BUT UNDER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, THE FAA CHANGE
THE STANDARDS FOR BECOMING AN
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER AND
INSTITUTED A SCREENING
BIOGRAPHICAL TAPPED ON MY
CONTEST THAT AWARDED POINTS ON
HOW LITTLE YOU KNEW.
SO IF YOU ARE UNEMPLOYED FOR THE
LAST THREE YEARS, YOU GOT MORE
POINTS THAN IF YOU HAD A JOB.
IF YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
SCIENCE YOU GOT MORE POINTS THAN
IF YOU ARE A LICENSED PILOT.
THIS IS FOR AN AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROL JOB.
THEY SOUGHT THE LEAST QUALIFIED
AND WE PROVE THAT.
WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTS.
NO REPORTER ALEX VIPER GOT THEM.
I CALLED OVER MYSELF AND SAID,
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT SAFER?
THEY COULDN'T ANSWER IT BECAUSE
THEY DON'T CARE, THAT'S THE
POINT.
>> Martha: IT'S REALLY HARD TO
IMAGINE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE
MAPS THAT SHOW HOW MANY PLANES
ARE FLYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A MORE
IMPORTANT JOB THAN SAFETY IN
THIS COUNTRY.
>> Tucker: TO AWARD POINTS FOR
SOMEONE WHO IS -- THE
MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS, IT'S
AN OPPRESSIVE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE
CAN TRUST OUR AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROL.
WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND WE
SHOULDN'T.
>> Martha: THE ONLY THING THAT
SHOULD BE IMPORTANT IS, WHO'S
THE BEST.
WHO'S THE BEST AT THAT JOB.
>> Tucker: WHILE YOU MIGHT BE
LIKE, WHO CARES, IT'S ON
PROFESSOR.
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL.
>> Martha: IS ON TONIGHT?
WHEN I'M DONE WITH MY SHOW AND I
CAN KICK BACK, I THINK, TUCKER
IS ON!
>> Tucker: IT'S A MUCH MORE
INTERESTING PERSON THEN YOU
MIGHT THINK, AND KNOWS A LOT OF
DIFFERENT PEOPLE YOU WOULDN'T
EXPECT HER TO NO.
