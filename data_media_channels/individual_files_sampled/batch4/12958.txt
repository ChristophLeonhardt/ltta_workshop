Crouch she is the host and contributor at then Shapiro's Daily wire which as you likely know is a conservative news and commentary site Alicia has worked in what is it y'all radio what's it y'all on my racist conservative I use y'all saw she spent many years on your morning drive host and has served as the producing the producer of the Sean Hannity radio show she enjoys befriending liberals to show them that not all conservatives are old rich white dudes she is Alicia Krause I took that person on the left Adam Ensor he is a comedian who has appeared on Conan on Fox he's an Emmy award-winning writer for The Ellen DeGeneres Show he is Adam Enz and of course back as always one of our continuing champions he's a writer producer he's a comedian he is a triple slash who has written on some your favorite TV shows some of mine I'll tell you that he is also the editor and founder of the watch's party comm currently he can be seen on stage from coast to coast as part of the deplorable comedy tour he is Michael Loftus alright so many how we play our game right basically my friends here who are conservatives not today they will be liberals my friends here who are liberals not today they will be conservatives and we begin with this debate point you ready all right so imagine you walk into the restaurant downstairs here right here in the convention center and they're sitting at a table sharing a burger and a Diet Coke our Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao do you a form in a media protest and shout them out of the restaurant forcing them to seek safety and solace in the taco stand across the street do you be congratulate them for their dedicated service to our country or do you see sit down to eat your own burger and deal with the repressed anger that is ruining your lunch we begin with Stephanie Miller gosh I love doing this panel so much Rick you do I hate it I'm bad at it and I still come back every year because I love you of course I would thank them for this their service to America I would compliment mitch mcconnell's turtle shell I would ask if he's enjoying his piece of lettuce if he would like me to get him more I would tell him I agree that Social Security is an entitlement and I am not entitled to it even though I paid into it my whole life because you know what the government when conservatives are in charge know better and if you would like it back I would say thank you sir please sir and may I have another thank you government less conservatives are in charge and then you do what you want with my Social Security Medicare Thank You Alicia Kraus I mean first of all Elaine Chao should be offended to even be associated with the Trump administration and she is a shame to women everywhere how dare she and Mitch McConnell he he deserves no peace we should any public place and even their homes really where these people think they deserve to be they should be shamed out of them we should shout them down and really make our voices heard because we deserve to be heard and my truth deserves to be heard and hashtag yesallwomen alright John you want to talk about your truth John sure if I were to see Mitch McConnell and his lovely wife eating in a restaurant I would sit down well no I wouldn't want to sit down because I might be stealing someone else's seat and that's not okay unless it's Merrick garland um let me tell you something Mitch McConnell is a hero for being both the largest recipient of big oil donations in the entire Senate and of voting to continue their subsidies social baby shill is what I say let me tell you something I admire any guy who's the feem he not only managed to make Obama the first president to not get an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court nominee but it was also the only black president and that's sheerly a coincidence that it happened that way they let me tell you if I were able to sit down with Mitch McConnell and his wife I would eat so much trans fats my colon would be the one obstructing and delaying okay uh and when it comes to obstructing and delaying let me tell you something he doesn't delay when he knows there's another Cavanaugh accuser and he tries to ram a vote through anyway do you know what I'm saying so in general I think he's a great guy he's a real hero and honestly when I actually watched him go on stage at CPAC carrying a rifle I didn't say bitch you're trying too hard I said keep on going Mitch because you are the regressive of my dreams and Jesus hates poor people Michael Optus your rebuttal if we could hurry this up I have a Klan meeting and a proud girls as a lifelong liberal and I am also I just found out one mm Cherokee I am NOT going to stand by and watch Mitch McConnell eat because that means he's happy and I am not happy we've done it kid they hamburgers downstairs yes we have got to confront him when he tries to eat a hamburger with his turtleneck we have to confront him when he's on the phone we have to confront him in the bathroom I want to scare the shit out of every Republican on the face of the planet I want to scare the racism right out of them surround them and plant and only through spittle in the face will they learn the error of their ways Francois well first of all we'd like to say has black women Republicans that we just think it's really important to acknowledge that we have a right a god-given right to go through the day without ever encountering an opinion we don't agree with that's right without ever be having anybody be even slightly rude to us I mean certainly we've never encountered that no never but this is what we would do if we ran into Mitch and his wife we would build them their very own tent city okay and separate them so they could enjoy their meals and peace away from the people that they were voted to represent most of whom are not worth representing say that in my experience I think it's our experience as black women if you when you're an elected representative you don't have to talk to the public who said that was part of the job I don't you know oh I just Alicia wanted to bring something I just take issue with diamond and silk over there that think the face until we bring in the fabrics lady first of all they're clearly just racist to hate black people second of all second of all we need to resist we cannot let Mitch McConnell have any moment of peace I would go in there I'd pour the diet coke on him I take the plastic straw outta there because it's destroying our environment we need to stop plastic straws they're horrible and he is most at risk he's a turtle it could get stuck up its nose and he dies then I would go out in the alleyway and start trash can fires I would break windows because I am loving and tolerant and I hate violence all right I hope Mitch McConnell is able to have a peaceful Christmas in the galapagos island his relatives all right did we overdo the turtle jokes I'm just saying right next to Rick next topic just two words people two words Lindsey Graham's Alicia you know Lindsey Graham should be ashamed of himself and I guarantee you that John McCain that great statesman is rolling over in his grave because he would not have let the Republicans get away with the shit that was sold in that Judiciary Committee to shame on Lindsey Graham shame Stephanie Miller as a gay Republican woman I don't really like dick but Lindsey Graham is so macho particularly when he gets mad like in that hearing am i right I'm so butch like I for that penis I would come to the other side how dare anyone imply he is the only thing he's fluid on is his opinions on Trump which I like fluidity in that sense in van want some of that Lindsey Graham dick okay Michael Lindsey Graham is a war criminal who wipes his ass with the Constitution and blows his nose with the Declaration of Independence and only when he's wearing concrete shoes and paraded around and drinking the urine off of a robert e lee statue will we ever have peace in america damn your I just love people John you go see well I have a quote I want to read about Lindsey Graham which is that he's a race-baiting xenophobic religious bigot he doesn't receptor it represent my party and doesn't represent the values the men and women who wear that uniform oh I'm sorry this is what Lindsey said about Donald Trump then speaking of John McCain let me see how much I miss seeing Lindsey and John McCain together all the time they were a same-sex couple I could believe in two men opposed to gay weddings who always look like they were announcing one now you liberals you elitist liberals with your proper use of apostrophes in your your and your elitism let me tell you something you want to say that Lindsey Graham is a flip-flopper and I know to your untrained Minds it might appear that way yes he held open a Supreme Court seat for 400 days but then demanded he freaked out over a one-week wait to investigate sexual assault yes he said if Hillary Clinton was elected we should obstruct an ever letterers have a single Supreme Court justice on the court I know you want to say he flip-flops he went after Bill Clinton for perjury doesn't mind when Cavanaugh does it multiple times it's all most to the untrained eye like Lindsay Graham likes things both ways what I'm telling you is this now what he's my man stop asking how did Lindsey Graham change him impeaching a POTUS for minor reasons ten years ago to protecting a POTUS from multiple crimes today there has been zero change in Lindsey Graham he was doing the bidding of his donors then and he does the bidding of his donors now and I applaud his consistency all right Adam answer so much like a Republican it's spooky in here no Lindsey Graham conducted himself it weight completely unbecoming of a senator he yelled he screamed he put on a show he was dramatic he has such a temper I would hate to be that man's husband secondly he defended Brett Kavanaugh I don't know how you could possibly defend Brett Kavanaugh at eight cavities clearly I mean did you hear her testimony epinephrine norepinephrine medulla oblongata cerebral cortex frontal lobe want more evidence could you possibly want the man as a gang rapists Angela you're a bottle first of all we want it to be known that both Lindsay and Brett are totally fucking fun at a kegger what up yeah yeah they are the best beer pong team ever ever and let me tell you that we have we've partied with them so many times and they even said they didn't even mind that we were black and is that really cool you should have seen it we really felt like we weren't you know we'd gotten somewhere I just want to say that um they're cool yeah and let's see is great in dinner theater - oh my gosh I should see him play Othello it's amazing it's amazing our next topic this time just three words ready Alexandra Oh Cassio Cortez Alicia I mean people talk about how she wears designer clothes and how that doesn't make her a woman of the people but as a fellow you know Upper West Side liberal that also wears designer clothes I feel like she is a woman of the people and she can represent all women and she is just the next generation I mean she and Beto are the future of the Democratic Party and you know I just really hope that Ted Cruz gets back to being an uber driver because he does not I mean he complains and his wife is like moaning about not being able to afford a second home Alexandria Cosmo Cortez doesn't even have a home folks she's from the Bronx and she's going to represent New York so whoa did you say Beto Beto Stephanie Miller socialist she is a socialist too dumb to ground too many names what what I don't socialist she's gonna take all of our money use it to buy I don't know maple syrup and licking my body no that's it you didn't even mention socialist I did oh okay I guess I wasn't paying attention Michael Loftus I know that you're scared by a strong brown woman which I am 1 mm of that's my Cherokee part is also a brown woman and sure she might not have the fancy book learnin but she knows one thing sharing is caring and socialism works every single time you try it and come on you guys what's wrong with trying excuse me look at Finland it works there exactly Thank You Finland without Finland we don't have Legos or minecraft Angry Birds Angry Birds thank you so come on rise up don't let them have a moment's peace Brett Kavanaugh lives off the blood of dead puppies they would have dead puppy trub blood drinking parties there's no dead there are no puppies in Finland he's got in the country and they make video games don't you want that he's got a point I love Angry Birds you know I can't decide what I hate about Alexandria kZO cortes most is it the fact that she didn't actually keep the clothes from the photo shoot that she actually returned at the end of it and she doesn't wear designer clothes all the time that's a lie or do I hate the fact that you know she wants to have an assault weapons ban which is why we should impeach Regan retro actively because he supported that - let me tell you something I think what I hate most about her is that she's not a real socialist she's a democratic socialist who has caused called for the nationalization of a zero private industries which means she sucks at being a socialist what I want to tell you is she's fighting for housing as a human right right what kind of Christian would stand for that she believes scientists it's the 21st century haven't we move beyond science she wants to clean up campaign finance reform how is my side supposed to get elected without bribery other than gerrymandering crooked voter ID laws in an electoral college founded by slave owners make it harder for the banks to rip off you good people and if it wasn't for great housing crashes like Bush you wouldn't have gotten Obama and finally she wants to end private prisons and have criminal justice reform let me tell you something if we wanted moral clarity we wouldn't be voting Republican and I'm gonna tell you something else I don't care if you call me racist for saying that she looks like ms-13 because of her ethnicity it's not racism until a conservative white man says it is thank you well John's cred I'm glad he's the first one over there who admitted she is not a socialist she is a Democratic Socialist which I don't know the difference between the two and neither does she so I love her for that I don't understand socialism at all other than I like to wear Che Guevara t-shirts which I don't know if he was a socialist or not who came here on Rhodes who came here on Rhodes I do love Octavia Cortese because she understands socialism just as well as I do we should have a bonus round who could define democratic socialism but first francelli who is that who is what oh she did a collabo with Demi Lovato right sure yeah she seems really great go shave this is she's oh she's a Latin uh you're uh you're through yeah yeah okay all right all right let's get serious now huh all right we're gonna get serious yeah all right according to a new Environmental Protection Agency report issued just this past week greenhouse gases a leading cause of climate changed decreased by nearly three percent during the first year of the Trump administration with emissions from large power plants dropping by four point five percent resolved that President Trump will be the greatest environmental president in the history of the nation and will be given the first Scott Pruett Memorial Award if you can taste the air and smell the air damn it it's great air Stephanie listen we all agree President Trump what I am has superpowers he as he told us has a knack for science he has a sense of it like a spidey sense which I trust more than those pinhead scientists spidey sense what what is this are you a pothead what is that that's just Alaska do you want to try it liberal California it's legal here leave him alone fucking hippie sexy I can count on the Liberals to protect point is the pin head geek scientists are gonna kill our industry right and we need the president's tiny sense about what's scientific or not shit Stephanie Stephanie may need a few minutes after that one I think Alicia Donald Trump poisoned those children in Flint Michigan and it is a shame that none of you are recognizing that Scott Perot is the worst thing to happen to the environment literally since ever and these like creationists and these anti-global warming people there are thousands of scientists who believe in global warming it doesn't matter that there's also other scientists that say it doesn't exist name three there are so many scientists that believe in global warming and he's opening up a noir he's gonna kill all of the Elks and all of the beauty up there he should just stay out of his business and pot is awesome rebuttal john fugelsang well i'm not a scientist but that's what I say what I'm about to tell you not to trust scientists I'm not a scientist but I'm proud to live in a country where we think climate science is fake but pro wrestling is real let me tell you something climate science is a sinister conspiracy by the world scientific community to make us think pollution is bad and I refuse to be suckered by it and I'll tell you why you will never win the lotto but every opportunistic entrepreneurial person in here will never win the lottery but has a shot at making millions by being an oil industry funded climate skeptic denier and that's a damn good job we can create no I'm gonna tell you something I don't want to believe it because if we clean up all the air and clean up all the water and clean up all the land and reduce pollution and create thousands of new green jobs and revitalize the economy what if that's all just for nothing people what if that's all just for nothing because 97% of the world scientists were wrong ok the only reason to start believing in climate science is so we could have one more thing to blame on Barack Obama but I'm not there yet so all I'm gonna say is when I'm walking on the beach with my little boy and he says what's this black oily stuff washing up daddy I'm gonna proudly tell him that's big government getting off our backs that's pretty compelling argument Michael Wacha's what do you have to say to that I am just sorry that you are such science deniers because every scientist ever in the history of Education agrees that global warming is real and I'm sorry but it is real in the time it took me to say that five hundred polar bears committed suicide and the ocean rose three feet that is why you're it's so important that that donald trump who you just loved so much who makes me sick he knows the ocean is rising it just rose how many feet three feet now five jerry brown it's a hundred more dead disagree on this that's why Trump knows it's real he knows it's real that's why he wants to build the wall to keep out the surface the sewage that will be coming up through through Central and South America a little pool of nothing and that's not life that's not life I don't want to live like that I want to live long enough to scare the shit out of Mitch McConnell did he just make some kinda mm Czechoslovakian Indian can we talk about this Mexico sewage thing it's a wonderful country it's a great President Trump is the second coming of Jesus number one okay and he would have been the first coming but he's generous that way yes okay people make fun of his orange skin but what you people don't recognize and realize is the fact that he is taking his breath and cleansing the air okay we just say what's wrong with air you can see yes okay I'm just saying if the pilots can see the air maybe there won't be so much turbulence yes when we're on our flights yeah and things to places so that's first in number two the bottled water works just fine I don't know what people's problem is yeah like why this flick might have a 7-eleven I don't get it I don't get it I just I just got a text message I just got a text message from 23andme I'm actually one mm polar bear they just mentioned flights on that topic I have flown in a private jet to several climate summits over and over again and what I've learned about the climate and the three percent reduction in the greenhouse levels is that that is all Obama Obama started lowering these levels before Trump ever took office because what these scientists agree on is that everything good that happens under Trump is grandfathered in as it was Obama's fault but everything bad that happens under Trump is only Trump's fault so don't go blaming Obama and calling him names he did all the good things and Trump did all the bad things Obama lowered the levels of co2 by two percent when he was still in middle school cuz he wasn't Jesus all right now we have an agreed disagree agree or disagree the only way America can survive as a nation is to open the doors and windows wide and allow the fresh air of socialism to wash clean the shackles of a corrupt and corroded capitalist society Alicia I mean I didn't know if you knew this but not only is the Pope on my side when it comes to global warming I mean the Pope you guys who just speaks for billions of people in the world he also agrees with me that Jesus was a socialist and if Jesus was here on earth today in the form of Barack Obama he would be going down to the border and letting in all of those innocent women and children and then he would go to the Oval Office and tell Donald Trump what a vicious racist he is Stephanie Miller how much longer okay um you are right socialism is evil I as an American I want the right to die if I even get a cold I I don't even want big government giving me a Kleenex because that is my right as an American right if I have to kidnap a hobo and take out their kidney that's you know what Mike I'm stronger it's about right if I'm stronger than help starter fuck that hobo mm-hmm you know you wake up in a bathtub boys cuz you're lazy I would say that's Darwinian but I don't believe in Darwin socialism so Bobo you're fucked Michael Optus any hobo references you'd like to add to the conversation I know we're having a lot of fun are we but I'm actually one mm hobo people just want to lock them up institutions and it's so unfair they have the right to poop and use their heroin needles on the streets like they please you think there's a little too much white privilege on this side particularly down at the before diamond and silk do not speak for all excuse me I am 54% white and that's the truth street you're 23 I don't know I had Benita my maid do it but the point is and my in my property did get more valuable on the other half of your house bring up the Pope the Pope is a great leftist he's Pro he's pro-abortion he's Pro gay marriage he's super liberal he loves to fight climate change that's less he gets in trouble for the sex abuse scandal then he's a horrible conservative Republican I've disowned him but right now he's an awesome leftist second ball we need socialism because I don't we know this but right now the wealth in this country the distribution 99% of the wealth belongs to 1/10 of 1% of Americans which means if you imagine America as Elizabeth Warren all the wealth would be in the Native American by the way he sexually assaulted me backstage I don't remember how I got there what happened could he sexually assaulted me and it is a shame if he goes and speaks he does not believe my truth okay well nobody likes mocking assault survivors more than me but I want to bring it back to socialism if I could I have a quote from Hubert Humphrey compassion is not weakness and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism Hubert Humphrey but he was just a snowflake Lib tard globalist cock look I'm so proud that Donald Trump is so anti-socialist he'll start a trade war with China and then give 12 billion to our farmers which we borrow from China with a point is Barack Obama was such a horrible socialist he actually forced people to buy private health insurance as opposed to the real capitalist way where poor people show up at the emergency room and we the local taxpayer pay for it listen I am the most anti socialist person there I would like to send the troops and the police after socialists except that's socialism I would like to you to all right an angry letter to your Congressman about socialism but don't use the post office because that socialism we have to march in the streets again socialism but streets are socialist so don't do that I think socialists should be taken out to the trash but not a public landfill cuz that socialism I think we should flush it down the toilet except I don't do that because our sewer system is socialist and I also think that we should put them all in jail except jails are still socialist the point is the last Republican president to balance a budget with a surplus was Eisenhower and he was a filthy socialist GI Bill interstate highway plan having progressive taxation having having strong union support from the Republican Party thank God we've moved beyond those balanced budgets and surpluses I'm so glad we have a president who will now build a wall across thousands of miles of private and commercial property in deserts and rivers and forests so the people of Mexico don't have to see our crumbling roads and bridges thank you get out there and vote we don't know how to buy stamps to absentee vote but Rock the Vote is helping us register to vote and we are registering people to vote everywhere where you people don't want people to go vote ok another agree or disagree should the Democrats win control of the House of Representatives in November no cheers on that really it will not in any way be the fault of President Trump however if the Republicans succeed in holding on to control the credit will all go to trump agree or disagree Alicia everything is Donald Trump's fault I mean I don't understand why you guys aren't hearing me everything is his fault and if if the Democrats win thank God because then maybe we can finally impeach him Stephanie Miller it's happening oh thank you I agree with ya see trying to shut down our voices right right always do the right way there's no voice in this country there are no radio stations they have no Japanese Street meeting shut down the right wing voice in America you see what they did I know we saw we saw your speeches violence and your speech FN okay maybe I did that myself but like Donald Trump this was not my fault and it will mopping his balls if there is a blue wave you know why because he's a super huge spider man meets baby Jesus oh my gosh yes right which technically would make him the third coming something my point is he a while have the coming suite yeah yeah it will not nothing is that for his fault because spider-man fuck baby Jesus or something I like the Spider Man partner in there but okay we'll go with that Michael Loftus listen there is gonna be a blue wave yeah we've had enough and we're registering people in record numbers we're gonna stop pure evil I have an anonymous source who talked to a friend at a guy guys house that knows a dude at the New York Times that has proof that Donald Trump is actually Adolf Hitler he just shaved his mustache and that's why he does the hair anyway whatever we suspect we are going to have record voting turnout and listen we're gonna do whatever it takes and if that means wearing black hoodies and masks and reading people up then yeah that's how you do love wouldn't be your first time that's how love spreads its wings that's a way sure if some of us might have to vote one two three four five times in different places but that's what it's gonna take to bring love back and acceptance and I'm sorry that I don't have an ending for this bit yeah I have that for your white privilege expecting me to have a meal and like yourself before you wreck yourself rebuttal John Fugelsang look I love Trump because as an American Christian we finally have gotten around to worshiping Jesus as a God and not following his inconveniently liberal teachings so here's the point the majority of Americans in 2016 voted against Trump they voted against bringing back torture they voted against hating immigrants they voted against homophobia they voted against a bigoted Muslim ban they voted against grabbing women by the pussy they voted against making the rich richer they voted against the racism and thank God dead slave owners had the foresight to demand an electoral college because let me tell you democracy is the worst thing to ever happen to voting if you ask me when we realized that the majority of Americans reject our opinions we reject democracy and thank God for it do you realize how lucky we are that those dead slave owners demanded an electoral college because they didn't want to count their human property as actual humans thank God for it because today a vote in Wyoming is worth three times the power of a vote in New York and California states which give more than they take to the other states and that's a good thing my friends I'm against affirmative action and a level playing field for people of our minorities but goddamn it we need affirmative action for minority states so it states with no occupants can be on a level playing field and have as much power as the states that contribute so much more to our economy so god bless mr. Trump Hillary Clinton the popular vote by three hundred and sixty million votes okay so the people have spoken talked a lot about the electoral college I'm still paying back by a lower electoral college student loans so I want to get rid of it Adam yinz yeah conservatives can't even think critically he's not he's not coming up with these points he's just reading talking points off a card secondly I don't even know why we wrote littering I don't even know why we're considering the possibility that the Democrats aren't going to win in November we're gonna have a blue wave they're gonna take the house maybe they'll even take the Senate I am 100% sure just like I was a hundred percent sure Hillary was gonna win the house we're gonna take the Senate then we're gonna take your guns Angela okay first of all we want a lot he can cost what he wants the point is that's not for us to decide Stephanie that's not for us to decide we are so much conservative than those women that you keep thinking we are because like we're suppressing our own vote we keep telling each other the wrong date to vote going to the polling station that's right what I did then we drove to my grandmother's house and we locked them in it yeah all right on those on those important words we left a few minutes in case you guys had something you wanted to say to these amazingly funny people there is a where's Alex if she can talk back over here on the microphone ready H left audience right yeah talkback mic anyone you actually she's gonna bring it to you as much as I enjoy the political food fighting I guess but how do we get both parties actually work together to solve issues like Social Security because if you read the actuary reports you know where you have almost like a trillion dollar unfunded pension liability but it seems like if we want to actually increase the in town the the retirement age then all the Democrats will say Oh Paul Ryan wants to drive you're draining off a cliff but if you want to raise like the payroll tax cap then everyone says oh you're you know a communist so how do we get the parties to work together to actually solve issues that actually do affect people's lives real having the answer I'll just say very quickly one way to start is doing exactly what we're doing here today are we still conservatives yes really oh come on a bit longer cuz I'm getting my property values are really just just a little bit you know girls meeting is not gonna start itself thank God for Mitch McConnell I'll tell ya thank God for the man because a year ago when they signed into law this tax cut where 82% went to the wealthiest Americans because we work the hardest and deserve it the most some of these liberal naysayers were saying hey man you're adding trillions to the deficit you're gonna take come back in a year and try and take that away from entitlements some of them call it earned benefits but they're socialists Kooks now it's a year later and guess what Mitch McConnell is now calling for the poor people to pay for the rich people's tax cut by cutting entitlements I say we punked you bitches and winning is all that matters when you're this kind of Christian liberal as liberal as the Democrat I just want to thank FDR when he started Social Security he knew what he was doing he wanted to help everyone and everyone would chip in and everyone would get those that money when they were 65 who cares that people in 1937 died when they were 60 that wasn't the point we'd have the money and that money would be in a lockbox where Al Gore kept it and I don't know what happened but Al Gore had a no op lockbox I don't know what happened when the Republicans must have stole we gave it to rich people and had two wars off the books on your credit card all right let's get to the next question I was I was wondering if the Conservatives in the room can you explain the free market I think I think you saying in real life that's you real it's or not in real life okay that's them go ahead yes that is status when I'm them okay so like there's money there's the kind that's in the cards you got from the bank and then there's the kind and both are good but the card one is better and you get it usually from China sometimes Russia and nowadays Saudi Arabia but my god they're so cool I love them and then what you do is you make regulations that benefit you but then say you're against regulations you do things like say that every states rights right up until they want to have I don't know clean emission standards of their own just stuff like that yeah I think we're what we want yeah I'd like to go back to the entitlement thing because bob Corker is my favorite kind of conservative because he stood on the Senate floor and expressed very strong disapproval of a tax cut for the rich which he said will run up the deficit billions and then we're gonna have to cut Social Security and Medicare but he did absolutely nothing you know why because he knows Donald Trump is spider-man means baby Jesus he expressed very very strong disapproval that time for another one and the free market is when it's free the market is free to give me all the money they want so I will do their bidding as a public servant because the haves have bought off their politicians and the have-nots have not yes sir I like to thank the panel for coming my question is how did the panel feel about kneeling at for the national anthem I feel that we should take people's knees if you don't want to stand you don't need knees we're people who need knees yeah I thought your people were into giving what you need to understand is that even though Colin Kaepernick's said he wasn't protesting the palete that the the troops or the flag or the anthem we know better what he actually wanted think of Susan Collins when she said I believe you were assaulted but I know better than you who did it that's how we are with Kaepernick just because he says he's not protesting the anthem or the flag or the troops it doesn't mean that in Fox News we can't say that and I'll tell you why I know that racism and police brutality are bad but aren't protests against racism and police brutality just a little bit worse I'm sorry but I'm much more upset over protests against racism than the actual racism and all lives matter that's my safe word when I'm with the Russian hooker all lives matter but just understand that we don't need a black lives matter movement because we can say that and again the thing they member Colin Kaepernick and that whole protest is kneeling is just completely completely disrespectful okay there's there's no deference in that he could have given the finger he chose to kneel but what's what's important to remember is like like me too we need me to be but I say who me because I didn't do any wrong but again I don't want to watch a man doing a protest to protect black male bodies before I watch a sporting event where black male bodies are brutally punished for my pleasure you guys want to add something from this side well it's I'm just glad we brought it up I'm just that we're talking about it and and instead of wasting money on body cams and and hiring better police weakens weaken kneel and get something done he supports the both of those things that's how awful he is I want to kneel more yes Neela always yell during this have an all kneeling high America I say if you want to take a knee you go ahead take both these knees and you've sucked zombie Reagan's dick that's what I say who says that the until you've tried it come on people who says that the American flag isn't racist and who says that Colin Kaepernick can't kneel because the American flag is racist and also cops are racist and I liked his socks that were depicting cops as pigs there's nothing wrong with that at all he should get to say what he wants to say and for the first time ever I tuned in to ESPN because they all agree with me yeah what's our time Alexandre okay few more minutes I can get a boat all right I am one of those folks that is a person that has a black father who voted for and loves Donald Trump and I have done everything in my power to make sure that man gets out of office I have loved this panel because in having a father that loves Donald Trump you have to pray for your father and that means sometimes you got to pray for Donald Trump that's hard and I've done it and then I pray for that man's family and then I said and understood I was like what if I was Donald Trump what if I decided I was gonna run for president cause some people pissed me the fuck off and then I accidentally won and the reason I won is because I said I'm from New York we don't play the losers we go and I'm gonna make the water so dirty that if I win it don't matter cuz crooked Hillary can't get me because everything she does is crooked and if I lose well so what and he won and now we live in a world with Donald Trump as president and just like the cheating husband would know if he cheated he'd know it'd be truth in his face and this is a man who called from was sitting there saying hey Milani I love you baby you just had my kid you're the greatest thing on earth I love you hood on stormy that's too much teeth hold on hold on I don't want to cut you short but we gotta give up if that man would lie to his wife on the phone and he would lie about everything else why wouldn't he lie about stealing this election and if he stole the election and he cannot be President because that would mean gotta wrap it up buddy well the question becomes how does he'd not be president and we all be okay okay we got to leave it there we got to thank all of you for coming to this year's devil's advocate you know if you had a great time enjoy the rest thank you Rick
