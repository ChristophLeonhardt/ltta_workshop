they demonstrated that they are incapable of engaging in the humble pursuit of knowledge that was some footage you've probably seen from Milo speech at Rutgers University it was around two and a half years ago now and I'm not convinced that New Jersey's flagship university has gotten much better when it comes to free speech you see the school had invited Fox News political analyst and anti Islamic terrorism speaker Lisa daft re to give a lecture entitled radicalism on college campuses but a petition that called Lisa a bigot and unapologetic Islamophobe made the rounds online and got more than 1,600 signatures the petition site at times Lisa said Islamic terrorism takes its guidance and teachings from the Quran which is Sharia law and when you go to the mosque and you're part of a community and you want to feel important and relevant and want to give back to the cause Isis recruits you you say I can be an isis wife the petition said this statement equating Muslims everywhere with Isis is undoubtedly hate mongering okay so maybe lisa neglected to make the distinction in that particular part of that particular speech but just a quick google search reveals that she clearly sees isis as only a minority of islam but for most of you american muslims he work as doctors lawyers engineers important members of our society who believe in peace he believed in equality you believe in respecting your neighbors whether they be black white asian christian buddhist or jews you believe in these values because you believe in america that's what brought you here and that's what keeps you here yeah I don't think Lisa's in Islamophobe she just rightly recognizes that Islamic terrorists are inspired by certain segments of the Quran segments which other Muslims ignore or interpret differently anyway Rutgers initially stood strong against calls to cancel daftar II saying if these issues are not brought to the forefront and given a chance to be debated then they may continue to stay buried but the school eventually caved less than a week before Lisa was due to speak this Tuesday cancelling her talk another petition was started this time by conservative and libertarian students at Rutgers defending Lisa statements and saying that students at the school called the speaker a cockroach and a bitch the tolerant left folks but then Rutgers went back on their decision to uninvite Lisa with an administrator sending her a message reading I want to write to clear up any confusion regarding your invitation to speak at the University to the degree that I may have contributed to the confusion I hope you will accept my apology the school has offered her for November dates to speak but getting to come to Rutgers is only half the battle who knows if students will actually let Lisa speak without whining or smearing themselves with fake blood for campus unmasked I'm Rob chin shock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
