00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:16,040
BECAME NOSY, DETESTABLE NEIGHBOR

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,842
FROM "BEWITCHED."

4
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:20,611
JAMMING UP PHONY CONCERN ONLY TO

5
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,212
SPREAD MALICIOUS GOSSIP.

"IF ANY FIRST LADY DISAPPEARED,

00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:30,755
YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHERE SHE

IS."

11
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,023
TO JUSTIFY THE ODIOUS PREMISE,

12
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,225
HE FIRST HAD TO CREATE THE

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:34,826
PREMISE.

14
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,860
IF ANY FIRST LADY DISAPPEARED,

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,862
AND SO BEGINS A TROJAN HORSE FOR

16
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:40,865
A GHOULISH GAME ALL TO PUSH A

17
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:42,667
PHONY CNN SEGMENT.

18
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,835
INSTEAD OF SAYING IS MELANIA

19
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,702
MISSING?

20
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:46,170
THEY PITCHED THEIR SEGMENT AS

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,272
HOW THE MEDIA IS COVERING

22
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:49,307
MELANIA'S ABSENCE.

23
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:50,108
SO THEY ARE COVERING HOW THEY

24
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:51,476
ARE COVERING IT.

25
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:54,479
I GUESS WE SHOULD COVER HOW THEY

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,147
ARE COVERING HOW THEY ARE

27
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:57,982
COVERING IT.

28
00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,617
>> THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN

29
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:00,318
QUIET ABOUT MELANIA TRUMP AND

30
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:00,852
HER STATUS.

31
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,820
WE SAW HER TWEET THE OTHER DAY.

32
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,989
THE FIRST TIME WE CAUGHT A

33
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,190
GLIMPSE OF HER, THE LAST TIME WE

34
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,359
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER WAS ON

35
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:08,693
MAY 10.

36
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,662
I WONDER IF SOMEBODY IS GUIDING

37
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,264
THAT KIND OF TWEET FROM HER.

38
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:15,466
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HER, AT

39
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,801
LEAST THE IMAGE SHE HAS HAD IN

40
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,469
HER ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PRESS.

41
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,071
>> IF THE FIRST LADY OR THE

42
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:23,241
PERSON STANDING IN FOR THE

43
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:24,008
FIRST LADY DISAPPEARED, YOU WANT

44
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:25,276
TO KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

45
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:28,246
>> Greg: THEY EVEN HAD A

46
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:29,213
CHART.

47
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:30,314
HOW SOPHISTICATED.

48
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:31,649
THE SPECULATION FUELED AND LESS

49
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:32,850
GUESSING GAMES.

50
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,252
THE PLEASURE MANY FOUND AND

51
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:35,119
HOPING SOMEONE WAS WRONG --

52
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,421
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE

53
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,588
FIRST LADY AND CLOAKING IT IN

54
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:41,392
SOME KIND OF CONCERN.

55
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:45,563
CNN, "NEWSWEEK" ," THE GHOULS

56
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,031
BARELY HAVE ANY HUMANITY LEFT.

57
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,834
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HIT THE

58
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,503
BOTTOM OF THE CESSPOOL, MORE

59
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:53,471
CESSPOOL.

60
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,073
SOME EVEN SUGGESTED TRUMP BEAT

61
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,406
MELANIA.

62
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,841
TRAPPED IN THEIR OWN PRISON OF

63
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:58,509
PAIN SINCE 2016, THEIR MISERY

64
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,745
ONLY SIX COMPANY.

65
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,780
JEFF ZUCKER MUST BE SPINNING IN

66
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,615
HIS GRAVE, IF HE WASN'T ALIVE

67
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:05,817
AND WELL.

68
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,452
OR IS HE?

69
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:08,386
HAS ANYONE SEEN HIM?

70
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:13,224
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?

71
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,226
DANA, THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE DO ON

72
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:16,027
SUNDAYS.

73
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:16,794
THERE ARE PEOPLE SITTING AROUND

74
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:21,432
TWEETING ABOUT IF TRUMP, HAS

75
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,835
TRUMP BEAT MELANIA.

76
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,636
>> Dana: IT'S REALLY GROSS.

77
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:27,638
NUMBER ONE THE MEDIA WAS UPSET

78
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:28,339
ABOUT ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

79
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:29,674
HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH DURING

80
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:30,408
THE CAMPAIGN COMMAND THAT THAT

81
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,910
WAS OUT OF FANS.

82
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,648
BUT SHE DID FAINT.

83
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:38,349
SHE WANTED TO BE THE PRESIDENT

84
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:42,220
OF THE UNITED STATES.

85
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,554
SHE IS NOT AN ELECTED PERSON,

86
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:44,789
THE FIRST LADY, SHE CAN DO

87
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,057
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

88
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,658
I HOPE SHE IS WELL.

89
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,060
IT WOULD BE MORE BELIEVABLE IF

90
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,262
THEY REALLY CARED HOW SHE WAS.

91
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:51,996
>> Greg: I DON'T THINK THEY

92
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:52,663
CARE.

93
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:56,334
THE THING THAT GETS ME IS THAT

94
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,835
CAMOUFLAGE, JUST WORRIED ABOUT

95
00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:58,169
HER.

96
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:00,371
NO, YOU ARE NOT.

97
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,439
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE HER.

98
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,040
>> Jesse: LAST WEEK THEY WERE

99
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,842
MAKING ALL SORTS OF DISGUSTING

100
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:05,910
COMMENTARY NOW THEY ARE SO

101
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,478
CONCERNED ABOUT HER HEALTH.

102
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,780
THE MEDIA SPENDING MORE TIME

103
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,249
WONDERING WHERE MELANIA IS AN

104
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:12,650
NOT WONDERING WHERE ISIS IS.

105
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,285
DON'T YOU THINK THEY WOULD SPILL

106
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,254
SOME INK OVER THAT?

107
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:18,890
TRUMP MADE ISIS DISAPPEAR.

108
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,658
MELANIA HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE.

109
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,260
PETER STRZOK WENT MISSING.

110
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,294
THEY HAVEN'T SHOVED A CAMERA IN

111
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:25,496
HIS FACE, SEEMS LIKE THE MEDIA

112
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,064
MIGHT WANT ANSWERS ABOUT HIS

113
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:27,465
WHEREABOUTS.

114
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:28,399
SHE HAD KIDNEY SURGERY THREE

115
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,469
WEEKS AGO.

116
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,069
AN INVASIVE AND DELICATE

117
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:32,436
PROCEDURE.

118
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,838
I'M SURE SHE WANTS TO COME BACK

119
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,439
ON HER OWN TERMS AT HER OWN

120
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,441
TIME, AND THAT'S FINE.

121
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,144
TRUMP'S MARRIAGES HAVE ALWAYS

122
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:42,647
BEEN SUBJECT TO TABLOID FODDER.

123
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,849
IT IS GOOD INK.

124
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,118
PEOPLE PROFIT OFF IT.

125
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:49,353
SHE IS NOT THE MOST, SHE DOESN'T

126
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,087
SPEAK A LOT PUBLICLY.

127
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,856
THERE IS A VACUUM THERE AND SHE

128
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,758
DOESN'T HAVE A ROBUST P.R.

129
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:54,859
MACHINE.

130
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,828
THEY FILL THE VOID WITH THESE

131
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,897
SPECULATIONS AND NARRATIVES THAT

132
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:01,666
HAVE NO CONNECTION TO REALITY.

133
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,868
I THINK IT SHOWS A DISRESPECT OF

134
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,502
THE FIRST FAMILY.

135
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:07,672
LAST TIME IT WAS IVANKA, THEN

136
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:08,005
MELANIA.

137
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:09,941
THEY DON'T RESPECT THEM LIKE

138
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:10,441
THEY USED TO.

139
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,375

148
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:13,844
EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THIS IS SO MUCH

149
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,613
GOOD NEWS, YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER

150
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:17,548
THE FIRST LADY BECAUSE SHE MIGHT

151
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,482
BE RECUPERATING OR MAYBE SHE

152
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:22,486
JUST LIKES TO DO WHATEVER THE

153
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,288
HELL SHE WANTS.

154
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:25,990
>> Juan: I DON'T FOLLOW

155
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,657
TWITTER THE WAY YOU DO BUT I

156
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,025
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ANY

157
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:28,593
ANTIPATHY TOWARD HER.

158
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:30,661
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.

159
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,762
>> Greg: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN

160
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,398
ANYONE MAKING FUN OF HER ACCENT?

161
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:35,733
>> Juan: PEOPLE HAVE SAID

162
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,234
THAT.

163
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,635
PEOPLE QUESTION HER HEALTH

164
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,470
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW MUCH

165
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:39,870
ABOUT THIS.

166
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,072
SUBSEQUENTLY, ANYONE WHO IS

167
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,840
SICK, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME

168
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,242
SYMPATHY FOR THEM.

169
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,710
THE BIG QUESTION HERE IS, SHE IS

170
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,745
SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN EVENT TODAY

171
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,680
FOR GOLD STAR FAMILIES.

172
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,282
THEY CLOSED IT TO THE PRESS.

173
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,084
AT SOME POINT, WHEN YOU ARE IN

174
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,018
POWER AND YOU START TO KEEP THE

175
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:57,255
PRESS OUT, THE PRESS IS LIKE,

176
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,055
WHAT'S GOING ON?

177
00:04:58,055 --> 00:04:59,390
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

178
00:04:59,390 --> 00:04:59,724
GETTING.

179
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:01,092
YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE PRESS FOR

180
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:01,859
THIS?

181
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,394
I THINK AT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS

182
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:05,463
TRANSPARENT AND SAID YOU KNOW

183
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:07,465
WHAT, SHE IS 48.

184
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,065
SHE HAD SURGERY.

185
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:10,668
SHE WANTS TO HAVE A REST.

186
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:11,569
MAXIMIZING EVERYBODY IN AMERICA

187
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,870
WOULD SAY GOD BLESS HER.

188
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,172
I HOPE SHE IS RECOVERING WELL.

189
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:15,873
>> Greg: YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT

190
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:18,442
THE TWEETS.

191
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,143
THEY TALKED ABOUT HER GETTING

192
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,779
BEATEN UP.

193
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,180
>> Juan: WHY IS ANYBODY SAYING

194
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,914
THAT?

195
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:24,548
>> Greg: BECAUSE THEY ARE

196
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,484
AWFUL PEOPLE AND I WON'T MENTION

197
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:27,184
THEIR NAMES.

198
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,853
THEY WILL NOT BE MENTIONED ON

199
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:30,554
"THE FIVE," BUT YOU CAN LOOK

200
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:30,888
THEM UP.

201
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:33,057
>> Kimberly: IT'S REALLY

202
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:33,758
DISRESPECTFUL.

203
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:34,692
IT'S A SERIOUS MEDICAL

204
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:35,660
CONDITION.

205
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,829
SHE HAD TO GET THE KIDNEY

206
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:39,497
EMBOLIZATION, VISITED WALTER

207
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:39,797
REED.

208
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,531
PERHAPS SHE NEEDS TIME TO

209
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:41,799
RECOVER AND GET BACK ON HER

210
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,266
FEET.

211
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:45,069
SHE HAS A VERY STRESSFUL JOB

212
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,070
BECAUSE SHE IS NOT TREATED WELL

213
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,240
IN THE PRESS TO BEGIN WITH.

214
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,474
THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL,

215
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:51,175
PSYCHOLOGICAL STRAIN IN OUR

216
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:52,043
PHYSICAL TOLL ON HER BODY.

217
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:54,445
SHE'S A MOTHER OF A YOUNG SON,

218
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:55,346
AND SO SHE'S GOING TO SPEND TIME

219
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:58,849
AS WELL WITH HIM, QUITE WORRIED

220
00:05:58,849 --> 00:05:59,450
ABOUT HIS MOM.

221
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,751
WHAT IS THE POINT, THEY ACTED

222
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,688
LIKE SHE WAS LIKE A MISSING

223
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:05,256
PERSON.

224
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,791
>> Greg: THIS WHITE HOUSE IS

225
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,259
THE MOST DESPERATE THING IN THE

226
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:08,793
HISTORY OF HISTORY.

227
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,228
WE KNOW EVERYTHING.

228
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:12,263
>> Dana: THEY MAKE FUN OF IT

229
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:14,498
FOR BEING A REALITY SHOW BUT

230
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,701
THEY THINK THIS IS PART OF THE

231
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,268
ACT.

232
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:18,569
THEY ARE HIDING MELANIA FROM YOU

233
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:19,503
SO YOU CAN'T SEE HER.

234
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,872
IT HAS TO BECOME PART OF THE

235
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,207
STORY LINE OR SOMETHING.

236
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:23,774
>> Kimberly: AND FEIGN

237
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:24,475
CONCERN.

238
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,843
WHEN THEY AREN'T ACTUALLY

239
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,277
CONCERNED.

240
00:06:26,277 --> 00:00:00,000
IF THEY CARED, THEY WOULD
