1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:10,180
THIS IS PAUL RYAN'S ANGRY
REACTION.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,960
THEY HUGGED IT OUT.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,930
THEY CAN'T OPPOSE PRES.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,910
TRUMP
BECAUSE HE IS IN HIS OWN PARTY.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,360
LET'S GO TO RYAN'S REACTION.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,869
AFTER YESTERDAY'S MEETING, DO
YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,480
TRUSTWORTHY NEGOTIATING PARTNER
AND THE PRESIDENT THAT

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,949
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS
OF THE REPUBLICANS?

9
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:31,960
I DO.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,329
LOOK, I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF
INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT THE

11
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,350
MEETING YESTERDAY.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,140
ISN'T IT A GOOD THING THAT
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TALK?

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,540
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:47,610
THE PRESIDENT MADE IT REALLY
CLEAR AND WHAT HE WAS AIMING FOR

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,170
YESTERDAY AND THAT MEETING WAS A
BIPARTISAN MOMENT WHILE THE

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,950
COUNTRY IS FACING TWO HORRIBLE
HURRICANES.

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,610
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT
THE HURRICANES.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,319
I THINK THEY JUST LIFTED THE
DEBT CEILING.

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:12,270
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH?

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,270
WHAT A MINUTE DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,030
HATED THIS POTENTIAL
DEAL THE DAY BEFORE?

22
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,499
THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT.

23
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:22,020
YOU DESCRIBED THE PLAN TO
BUNDLE HARVEY RELIEF WITH

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,909
THE DEBT CEILING AS RIDICULOUS
AND DISGRACEFUL ñ

25
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,719
I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS
IN MY MOUTH.

26
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,880
I THINK I DESCRIBED A SHORT-TERM
DEBT LIMIT.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,490
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CREDIT
MARKETS AND DOING THIS ON

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,380
SHORT-TERM BASIS ñ WE CAN KEEP
DOING IT THAT WAY.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,770
I WAS MAKING AN ECONOMIC POINT
WHICH IS WITH RESPECT TO

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,240
THE CREDIT MARKETS, I THINK
STABILITY AND LONGEVITY ARE KEY.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,919
SO YOU DID NOT CALL IT
RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL?

32
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,239
REALLY?

33
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,369
LET'S GO TO PAUL RYAN
FROM YESTERDAY.

34
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,969
I THINK THAT'S A RIDICULOUS
IDEA.

35
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:54,319
I HOPE THEY DON'T MEAN THAT.

36
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,909
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS.

37
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,000
WE'VE GOT ALL THIS DEVASTATION
IN TEXAS.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,640
WE'VE GOT ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED
HURRICANE ABOUT TO HIT

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,460
FLORIDA, AND THEY WANT TO PLAY
POLITICS WITH THE DEBT CEILING?

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,950
THEY ALSO WANT TO THREATEN
DEFAULTING OUR DEBT, I

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,940
THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS AND
DISGRACEFUL.

42
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,400
AT THIS MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE
FELLOW CITIZENS IN NEED TO

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,040
RESPOND TO THESE HURRICANES SO
THAT WE DO NOT STRAIN THEM.

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,670
I LOVE CATCHING POLITICIANS
IN LIES.

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,680
THE DAY BEFORE HE IS

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,250
LIKE TO COMBINE HURRICANE HARVEY
WITH LIFTING THE SHORT-TERM DEBT

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,250
CEILING?

48
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,660
THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:49,150
TODAY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY
DID.

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,150
ONE MORE TIME.

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,879
YOU DESCRIBED THE PLAN TO
BUNDLE HARVEY RELIEF WITH

52
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,159
RAISING THE DEBT CEILING AS
RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL.

53
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,969
I DID NOT DESCRIBE IT THAT
WAY.

54
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:03,499
I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS IN
MY MOUTH.

55
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:08,659
GO BACK TO YESTERDAY.

56
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,739
DID HE ACTUALLY UTTER THESE
WORDS?

57
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:11,739
I

58
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,740
THINK THAT IS A RIDICULOUS IDEA,
I HOPE THEY DON'T MEAN THAT.

59
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,310
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS, WE
HAVE ALL THIS DEVASTATION

60
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,049
IN TEXAS, ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED
HURRICANE ABOUT TO HIT

61
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,799
FLORIDA, AND THEY WANT TO PLAY
POLITICS WITH THE DEBT CEILING?

62
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,359
AND THEY ALSO WANT TO THREATEN
DEFAULTING OUR DEBT?

63
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,819
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS AND
DISGRACEFUL THAT THEY WANT

64
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,800
TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE DEBT
CEILING AT THIS MOMENT WHEN

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,409
WE HAVE FELLOW CITIZENS IN
NEED TO RESPOND TO THESE

66
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:46,040
HURRICANES SO THAT WE DO NOT
STRAIN THEM.

67
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,579
OOPS.

68
00:03:50,579 --> 00:00:00,000
THE MARCO RUBIO MOMENT
FOR PAUL RYAN.
