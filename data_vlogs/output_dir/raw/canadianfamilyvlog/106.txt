1
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:08,309
my mom took the kids for a walk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,780
store and I thought oh well they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,550
I'll vacuum<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz then I won't have them</font>

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,650
dumping stuff on the floor or you know

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">running through well I'm vacuuming well</font>

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,810
I can't find the hose for the vacuum I

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,820
started vacuuming then Olson like the

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,430
hose right here is completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing so</font>

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,150
obviously Levi or Malik hire somebody

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,369
grabbed it and started using it as like

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,080
a sword because they've done that before

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,719
but I didn't get put back and I have no

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,090
idea where it is so I can't vacuum the

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,250
couches are getting the little spaces I

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,989

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,720
the time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why I do that I</font>

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
should just stick it on the fridge

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">because obviously stuff stays on the</font>

49
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,369
fridge so that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be doing</font>

50
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,049
but I put it somewhere for safekeeping

51
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,540
can't find it so I would clean it all on

52
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,250

something like that I started planting

all these seeds for my garden<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside my</font>

118
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,780
vegetable garden look at this they're

119
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,090
already like busting out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tree all</font>

120
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,940
these pickling cucumbers literally push

121
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the lid the greenhouse lid off of this</font>

122
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,989
tray it's pretty intense are getting

123
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,370
like really big<font color="#E5E5E5"> already it's only really</font>

124
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,170
seven days<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something the only thing</font>

125
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,449
hasn't Germany to get is why hot peppers

126
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,389
but you can see there's ones turning to

127
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,430
come out right there so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

128
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,860
credit butter for me so one thing I've

129
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,290
learned from Germany plants is that once

130
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,930
they started to grow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they germinated</font>

131
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,820
don't keep water in them let them dry

132
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,500
completely out before you water them

133
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,150
again or still get a whole bunch of nuts

134
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,740
and then the plan will just die like

135
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,600
right away it's so frustrating i have

136
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,130
maybe two years in a row before I

137
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,860
figured it out but yeah so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my</font>

138
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,870
plants<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really well and I'm super</font>

140
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,560
pickled cucumbers before and I'm really
