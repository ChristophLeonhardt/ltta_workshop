00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,670
crammed into a blast first generation

ipods blasting so excited to go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,050
long drive to the big city without our

parents most of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents there were</font>

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,859
but that's not what anybody cared about

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,539
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the i-94 between</font>

roller coasters each competing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

the highest job<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most loops or be</font>

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,070
the most generally upsetting in every

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,230
way and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a regular trip this</font>

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,050
was a fun trip<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we stopped there my</font>

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,460
classmates racked up bragging rights

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,989
about how many times they've ridden a

23
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,449
ride with a 200-foot drop or the one

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,800
where you land your stomach and your

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,190
arms<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legs just like hang there in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just got a half-melted cotton candy and</font>

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,140
held everybody's stuff as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,140
the rides fun trip I'd already felt

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,390
myself separating from these kids their

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,119
bravado and boisterousness thick like a

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,150
cloud of Axe body spray and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there</font>

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,920
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> me alone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a sea of hot asphalt</font>

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
fun trip eventually piled back on the

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,750
bus to head to Chicago and catch a few

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,729
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the field museum and the</font>

39
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,079
the night was to Navy Pier a famous

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,670
little amusement park<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the shore of</font>

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,200

45
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,939
before I loved that it moves really

46
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,119
really slowly so much so that near the

47
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">top it almost feels like it's not moving</font>

48
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,500
at all if you didn't know any better you

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">might think that it stopped and that you</font>

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,969
were stuck there so we went up my

51
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:03,460
friends

52
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,350
and sure enough when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got to the top</font>

53
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,280
it felt totally still my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends started</font>

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to panic I tried to reassure them that</font>

55
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,569
we were fun but they'd long ago stopped

56
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,819
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me so they squealed and</font>

57
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,620
screamed and huddled up in little balls

58
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,170
his fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being stranded on a giant</font>

59
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,720
metal wheel visions of cranes and

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,090
firefighters terrified them more than

61
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,730
any two hundred foot drop but for me in

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stillness I was perfectly calm I</font>

63
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,190
could see all of Chicago it almost felt

64
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,620
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the whole city to myself and</font>

65
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,989
to this day I love going on any ferris

66
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,090
wheel I can find sure they're a little

67
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,280
corny but nothing makes me feel more

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,150
