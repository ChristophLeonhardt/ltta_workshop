1
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,300
My name is Nick Mason and I’m a musician
and I’ve played drums for Pink Floyd for

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,500
the last fifity years but I am also a fanatical
racing enthusiast, I think we could say.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,680
I’ve been coming to Goodwood since the first
hill climb, twenty, er, I don’t know how

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,300
long ago it was.

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,300
And I am still enjoying it today.

6
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,160
It’s completely different now.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,110
The first time the were no demonstrations,
it was a straight hill climb.

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,770
Everyone was timed in different 
classes and it was wonderful.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:54,600
And it’s now still wonderful but it’s completely different it’s become the new motor show.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,859
I never wanted to be a car collector I wanted
to go motor racing and what happened was that,

11
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:09,450
thanks to the success of the records I end up being able to keep everything I’ve ever raced.

12
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,110
I bought the Ferrari 250 GTO about forty, forty-something years ago.

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,980
Everyone thought I was completely insane,
including myself I think.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,160
But now they think I am sort of the Warren
Buffett of motoring.

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,600
I’ve had the car so long now, it is part of the family.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,180
I’m so familiar with it, I absolutely recognize
the view out of it but I still think

17
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,800
it is one of the greatest views that you can possibly have.

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,600
Rather that great geographical landscapes,
that beautiful bonnet stretching ahead

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,940
is a wonderful thing.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,600
I remember when I was quite young, seeing
one of these cars at Goodwood and peering into it and thinking,

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,400
“Oh it’d be great to be in there and
doing that.”

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,820
As a driver’s car it’s fantastic but it’s also then got a sprinkle of real history, and

23
00:02:13,820 --> 00:00:00,000
it’s part of Ferrari history and part of Le Mans
which to me has always been for me the great race.
