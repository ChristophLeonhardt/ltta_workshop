00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,670
The story of the $130,000
hush payment to porn star

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,780
Stormy Daniels has
gotten chaotic.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,940
It all started when Trump’s
lawyer, Michael Cohen,

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,640
said he paid Daniels
with his own money.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,350
Here’s what we know.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,460
Does Trump know
about the payment?

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,540
Yes.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,710
Trump initially
pleaded ignorance.

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,740
“Mr. President,
did you know about

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,850
the $130,000 payment
to Stormy Daniels?”

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,650
“No.”

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,165
Giuliani then
changed the story:

13
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:28,540
“But he did know about
the general arrangement

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,130
that Michael would take
care of things like this.”

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,130
Trump now acknowledges
the payment too.

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,080
When did he learn about
the payment? Unclear.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,700
Giuliani has gone back
and forth on his timeline.

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,700
“A couple weeks ago —

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,300
maybe not even a couple,
maybe 10 days ago.”

20
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,760
“It could have been recently, 
it could have been a while back.”

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,660
But Trump may have
known months ago,

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,980
sources told
The New York Times.

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,110
When was Daniels paid off?
October 2016.

24
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,260
Giuliani says the payment was
made right before the election.

25
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,860
“Imagine if that came out
on Oct. 15, 2016,

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,610
in the middle of
the last debate?”

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,670
“Cohen made it go away.

28
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,680
He did his job.”

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,370
Why does the timing matter?
If it was election-related,

30
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,420
it may have violated
campaign finance law.

31
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,680
Giuliani says the details
don’t matter because,

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,100
according to him,
no laws were broken.

33
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,550
“It was not a
campaign contribution

34
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,960
because it would have
been done anyway.”

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,480
“It’s not campaign money.
No campaign finance violation.”

36
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,600
But we still don’t
know the full story.

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,380
Are Giuliani and Trump
on the same page?

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,680
Unclear.

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,450
Giuliani says yes. 
Trump says no.

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,870
“Rudy is a great guy,
but he just started a day ago.”

41
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,980
“He’ll get his facts straight.

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,370
He’s a great guy.

43
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,480
But what he does is

44
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,270
he feels it’s a very bad thing
for our country

45
00:01:43,270 --> 00:00:00,000
and he happens to be right.”
