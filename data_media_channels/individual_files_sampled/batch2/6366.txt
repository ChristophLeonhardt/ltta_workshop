the opioid epidemic is hitting certain parts of the country hard and Buffalo New York is an no exception in fact Buffalo area health officials blamed 300 deaths on opioid overdoses in 2016 and that was up from 127 two years earlier this is just one part of one state in the country and so officials and judges in the area realized we need to handle this in a different way we need to stop criminalizing people and give them an option to rehabilitate themselves and so they took on an approach two months ago that actually has proven to be pretty successful so the city is experimenting with the nation's first opioid crisis intervention court which can get users into treatment within hours of their arrest instead of days it requires them to check in with a judge every day for a month instead of once a week and puts them on strict curfews keep in mind that this is not an easy program it's pretty strict acceptance into the opioid crisis court means detox inpatient or outpatient care 8:00 p.m. curfews and at least 30 consecutive days of in-person meetings with the judge so I love it it's way way past time there's no reason to treat these people as criminals and then of course now the media that Buffalo started doing this they were like wait a minute have these guys aren't criminals they just need help right no course of course and so they started talking about how well look these are all non-violent guys who don't have a you know a track record of doing crime so I guess this makes sense it makes sense everywhere so I'm super happy that they're trying it in Buffalo and I hope that the program spreads but we shouldn't be locking people up for any kind of drug abuse in the first place it's not to say the drug abuse is great of course not but it's something that needs to be treated not something that private prisons can make money off of or by the way have almost paid for their imprisonment and make their situation worse let alone the core of the issue which is why are we taking their freedom away when when this is not something that is a a crime against the rest of us the society needs to put you away for so we can be safe know something that you need treatment for so I mentioned it started two months ago and the Justice Department actually allocated $300,000 for this program in the form of a grant and the results are all are already pretty promising so two months in none of the 80 people who agreed to the program had overdosed though about 10 warrants had been issued for missed appearances and keep in mind they have to appear in front of a judge every day for a month and so it doesn't surprise me that some people might have missed an appearance I'm not excusing it but if that's the worst outcome from this experiment then I'll take it and you know there have been a number of people who have testified about their experience so far and they're like look I I really wanted to get better and now there's a program that's actually really helping me instead of demonizing or antagonizing me yeah and one guy had missed a court appearance they brought him in in handcuffs and he said look I really appreciate this program because if I didn't have to report in every day you wouldn't come get me and I might have taken fentanyl and died in the streets so I needed different ways to solve the drug problem altogether so I'm a little frustrated that it took the opioid situation for us to realize maybe we shouldn't be imprisoning our fellow citizens that need help I wish we'd realized this decades ago before we started mass incarceration and locked away millions of people and and I hope that we go to address that injustice as well I don't want to just have people rotting in jail for taking drugs just like these folks took drugs but for God's sake let's at least get on the right Road now and Buffalo is a good step in that direction TYT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm /join
