Donald Trump is apparently now considering whether he will release the the big memo implicating the FBI in some sort of gigantic conspiracy to take down Donald Trump including the possibility of some sort of secret society and so this is the Devin Nunez memo and as of last night at the State of the Union we have a little bit of video for you that implies that he is actually planning to release it so let's watch that so he was speaking there with some giant that was the largest person I've ever seen in my life but anyway it was a little bit hard to hear the audio but he said whether the guy asked him you know are you going to release and he said 100% which I mean he's not great at math but that's that's all the percent I mean that's that's he's gonna do it but then it turns out maybe not so much because according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders Trump still hasn't seen the memo and when asked on CNN if there's a chance he wouldn't release the memo Sanders said there's always a chance well there's always a chance unless there's a hundred percent chance he's gonna do it so there's a bit of a miscommunication there between them but yeah so this is a guy who's talking constantly about how important and damning this memo is has he read it no no it's reading he's not read no judge see that's where I think there's a twist there so first of all the guy he's talking to his Jeff Duncan who wandered in from the other side of the wall except I think just don't let him in no obviously up on that on the seats there in the State of the Union but I choose to think he's a giant yeah I like that I did clarify that he's not in fact they're giant from the other side of the wall so anyway red asked him yeah so when when Sammy Sanders was asked by Chris Gorham on CNN has the presidency in the memo yet her answer was telling she said not that I'm aware of now that's a classic non-denial denial okay that's not a no that's cover my ass well I don't know it I made sure that I don't know that he saw it now why is that relevant because there are now reports that newness worked with Trump on the memo yes actually a little bit later on there's there was some breaking news in this area once we've done with this story we can get into that but yeah there's there's a lot of discussion going on about to what extent Nunez not just early on in the investigation when there was some questionable trips to the White House but continues to coordinate with the White House on this on something that is not just acting as a distraction from the actual investigation but was clearly designed to be a distraction yeah so if in fact Trump has or people in the Trump White House have worked with newness or his staffers on crafting the memo then of course he's gonna release it that's why he said a hundred percent to Duncan and he said can you imagine that like can you imagine me not releasing it now why why might they not release it well all the intelligence agencies that work under Trump in the executive branch have come to trump and said don't release the memo that's it it is misleading it is inaccurate don't do it it's a really bad idea but if Trump helped to write the memo of course he's gonna release the memo that's why he says it's a hundred percent the whole point is not to be accurate it's to do a hatchet job on the FBI so when the FBI comes and says please don't do it he's right I actually have their statement I can read a bit of that if you want this was put out earlier today from the FBI saying with regard to the house intelligence committees memorandum the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it as expressed during our initial review we have grave concerns about material emissions of fact the fundamentally impacts the memos accuracy so I think when you hear that the FBI doesn't want it to be really released my initial guess would be that there's some sort of classified information that they're worried about getting out which generally is not something that I'm overly concerned about I think that we have need of a lot of information but here they're saying no it is purposefully misleading and of course it's going to be this entire thing has been so ridiculous this whole release the memo thing which is of interest largely to Sean Hannity and some bot networks online it is an op-ed written by Devon Nunez who is clearly attempting to protect Donald Trump that is designed to do that and so what's gonna be in the memo it's going to be the hands like selected information that makes the FBI look bad what's new about that Sean Hannity and any number of republican congressmen have spent the past six months on a daily basis smearing the FBI there's nothing new about that and it's gonna end up being a lot like the the information of the testimony that comes out of fusion gps where they kept saying they wanted it to be released but then not allowing it to be released because the implication is far more damaging than the actual information in the the testimony or in this case the memo the material emissions a fact that the FBI referred to is not the bug in the memo it's the feature the whole point is the smear the FBI and that's why the Trump administration and nudists who worked and the transition team for Trump are in favor of putting it out because the FBI is doing the investigation of Donald Trump so they want to cover up for them so look this is much ado about nothing I actually now have now gotten to a point where like as usual we're stuck in this conundrum of this is a total non-issue but the right-wing yells so loudly about it that we feel compelled to to counter it but on the other hand we're covering a non-issue it's it's it's a memo written by a highly partisan guy who was part of the Trump team telling us that Trump is right who cares who cares about that yeah but that's the problem with the state of this country the right wing is so loud that they change the national conversation on so many issues that if we had a rational discourse they would be like okay the Republicans think Trump is right that's like your opinion man Democrats think he's wrong that's your opinion man now what's the reality we're outside of the reality zone here you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the
