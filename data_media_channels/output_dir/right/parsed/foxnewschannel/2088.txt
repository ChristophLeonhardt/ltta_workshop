>>  ALL RIGHT.
THE N.R.A. IS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL
MEETING IN DALLAS RIGHT NOW AND
THIS FELLOW NOT A FAN,
ADDRESSING AN AUDIENCE OF THOSE
WHO ARE AGAINST THE N.R.A. AND
PROLIFERATION OF GUNS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
WILL RILEY IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
HE WAS AT A RALLY EARLIER, STAND
FOR THE SECOND AS IN THE SECOND
AMENDMENT, THE RIGHT TO BEAR
ARMS AND HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.
I HAD HIM ON MY SHOW JUST LESS
THAN A WEEK AGO AND GOT AN
ENORMOUS REACTION TO THIS YOUNG
MAN.
WILL RILEY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
BACK.
>> YES, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME
ON AGAIN.
>> NEIL: I REMEMBER YOU WERE
SAYING, AND I WAS STRUCK BY THE
FACT YOU'RE NOT A BIG GUN OWNER
