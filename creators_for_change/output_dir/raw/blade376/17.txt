1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,819
hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that started on</font>

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:06,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook and YouTube at the exact same</font>

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,370
time so I timed it really really well

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,620
the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking about already</font>

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,259
when doing this live broadcast and I'll

6
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:16,550
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak for a bit while I'm waiting</font>

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,539
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to come in is that on</font>

8
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,650
facebook it's mirrored so my shirt for

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,170
example will probably look weird to you

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,480
when it's actually says team Snowden

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,809
whereas on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube it is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right way</font>

12
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:35,450
around so if anyone's watching on

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,780
facebook and you want to see because

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,370

stronger position right we're good we're

57
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,630
good so I'm looking at how I've got the

58
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,580
chat laid out because I've actually

59
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">never done a public one intentionally on</font>

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and once again if you want to</font>

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,579
so let's begin um firstly I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

65
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,060
say directly because that's what live

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,340
streaming allows me to do to everyone

67
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,900
who's watching right now a huge thank

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,870
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the support that you've been</font>

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving me since I've sort of returned as</font>

70
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,549
a full weekly video blogger since about

71
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,279
May of last year for anyone who's seen

72
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,440
my end of year video<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 2016 will know</font>

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,019
it's been quite a journey for me and

74
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,090
support can come in all forms whether

75
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,860
it's just watching the video content

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharing</font>

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,860
it you know doing regular engagements or

78
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,500
becoming a patron all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,199
brick work in an overall effort to give

80
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,120
me foundations to do what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really am</font>

81
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,030
passionate<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and it's been a scary</font>

82
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,629
thing to step into because I've stepped

83
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,930
out of a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> media organization last</font>

84
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,060
year and it gave me some time to reflect

85
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,460
on what I want to do and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

86
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and I know what that is but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it means</font>

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,960
standing on my own two feet and being an

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,000
independent journalist which is always

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,460
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scary thing and so the way</font>

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,169
I've laid this out today is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

91
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,189
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this 20 minutes long and</font>

92
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,960
then afterwards I'm happy to take any

93
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,150
questions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments and feedback from</font>

94
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,020
over the past year and the way I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

95
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,240
it listed is this and a gun on facebook

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm putting I've told it that way so you</font>

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,180
can see through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper the right way</font>

98
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,370
around but I'll read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you so the</font>

99
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,659
first thing was the introduction which

100
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,909
I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> done now I'm then going to</font>

101
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:39,479
talk about what my videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> are about</font>

102
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,650
because a lot of people sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of know</font>

103
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,300
what my videos are about in terms of

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,919
specific topics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you were to</font>

105
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,779
summarize it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I've</font>

106
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,479
really had to look at then looking at

107
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,529
the the objective for 2017 and then what

108
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,719
the battle plan is the 2017 and then at

109
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end I've got time for Q&A s um but</font>

110
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,699
by all means feel free to comment

111
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:03,279
through out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will do my best to</font>

112
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,580
respond to any questions that you may

113
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,479
have so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that said I'm going to</font>

114
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,060
start so in terms of what my videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

115
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,500
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so last year I was invited to the</font>

116
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,479
YouTube summit for social change and

117
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,069
I've mentioned this before so I'm gonna

118
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,259
be very brief about it it was

119
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to be at an event with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

120
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,839
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like-minded use their</font>

121
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,060
channels for similar reasons to me may

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,300
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be for the same campaigns but we're</font>

123
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,880
all using it to try and leverage

124
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,100
awareness and change around<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

125
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,560
issues now when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally go to a</font>

126
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
YouTube event and people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what do</font>

127
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,230
you do you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make youtube videos and</font>

128
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,140
people go oh and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you might have</font>

129
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,000
to explain you know how you make money

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,280
all these sort of things you never

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,410
really get to what your videos are about

132
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,150
um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this event because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

133
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,480
were all there as content creators who

134
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,300
make videos around social change the

135
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,730
conversation started right there of a

136
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,950
case of what are your videos about and

137
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,840
this gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot to think about and</font>

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,220
I've mentioned this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few videos</font>

139
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,140
before but I actually drew a little

140
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">diagram and again if you're watching</font>

141
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,440
this on Facebook and it's from reverse I

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
apologize but<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully you'll see some</font>

143
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,560
of the drawings and I'll do my best to

144
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,510
explain it to you so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

145
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,730
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what are sort of the</font>

146
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,070
different types of videos I do now might

147
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,350
might might sort of slogan used to be

148
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,380
miles dire entertain in inform inspire

149
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,960
which then the BBC now use and I think

150
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,990
the google<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it as well but that</font>

151
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,270
summarizes most great video content it's

152
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,000
important that you entertain<font color="#CCCCCC"> you engage</font>

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,700
the audience and it's important that you

154
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,520
inform them so that they take away you

155
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,630
know that they go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> with more</font>

156
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,820
information useful information than when

157
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,160
they first started<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video and inspire</font>

158
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,470
there's no point grabbing their

159
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,330
attention and teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> them something if</font>

160
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,650
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel then inspire to do</font>

161
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,900
something about it and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

162
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">broke down my videos but to get to a</font>

163
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,000
more granular level I saw it in sort of

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,370
three parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll be</font>

165
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,130
able to see this now I'm just making

166
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,470
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on both pages right so here we</font>

167
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,430
go so for me we've got the present oh

168
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,260
yeah we've got the past so that's like

169
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,240
news and world events so once an event

170
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,360
happens we can look back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reflect on</font>

171
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,030
what has happened maybe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presence</font>

172
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,650
we think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that we live our</font>

173
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,140
lives currently and in the future you

174
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">are my little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> robot there there are a</font>

175
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,880
lot of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things coming over</font>

176
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,649
the horizon how

177
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,959
do we prepare ourselves for that and so

178
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,930
this made me realize that my videos tend

179
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,839
to be about value systems and so that's

180
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,399
why I've done this diagram in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font>

181
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appears</font>

182
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,360
on both and then you realize that in the

183
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,220
present it's about mental health and

184
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,339
well-being when it's about the past it's

185
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,720
about world events and news and then

186
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,050
when it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the future and it's</font>

187
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">about science and technology and</font>

188
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,670
everyone Facebook is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

189
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,809
backwards i know it's backwards

190
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,699
unfortunately that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way facebook is</font>

191
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,009
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having to read it for</font>

192
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you're on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the YouTube</font>

193
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,819
stream youtube.com forward slash Myles

194
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:39,730
you can see it the right way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'll</font>

195
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,869
post a link to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this afterwards and then</font>

196
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:47,019
um the final bit was then how does that

197
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,869
construct into the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> i make there</font>

198
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of channels out there that do</font>

199
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,449
news that talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> science and</font>

200
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,720
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about mental health</font>

201
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,689
and well-being what I feel I've always

202
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:09,370
added is looking at value systems I've

203
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,129
met a lot of NGOs and charities and news

204
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,350
organizations in the past that say we

205
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,059
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular campaign for</font>

206
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,649
example we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do saying about why</font>

207
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,379
racism is bad this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the content</font>

208
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've done in its you know mocking</font>

209
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,550
racism what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think and you know</font>

210
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can talk about the content all you</font>

211
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:30,879
want but for me it's about your

212
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,999
objective is to stamp out racism for

213
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,999
example but then your starting point is

214
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:39,939
you know saying racism is bad that

215
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,870
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end occurrence for me if</font>

216
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> teach people the right value systems</font>

217
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,670
and not even telling people what they

218
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,089
are but posing questions massaging

219
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,049
empathy presenting a nuanced look on the

220
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,329
world about the technology that's coming

221
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:02,860
our way what what what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

222
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,600
challenges is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that going to prove to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

223
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,519
if we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at mental health and</font>

224
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,250
well-being

225
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,440
what sort of tools can we use to feel

226
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">better about ourselves and to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

227
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,850
empathetic to one another<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to take</font>

228
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">care of ourselves so we can have a</font>

229
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,650
clearer mind when you know living our

230
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,680
everyday lives and then there's the past

231
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,380
once news happens is just reporting on

232
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,960
what has happened the most important

233
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,420
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it is important to report in</font>

234
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,680
the news but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of people</font>

235
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that do it what about looking at how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

236
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,480
can break the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle on stopping</font>

237
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,190
tragedies from happening again and again

238
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:44,000
not adding more anger and what's the

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
term sort of hysteria which drives using

240
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,850
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the videos I do don't have</font>

241
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,980
sexy titles like the just world

242
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,200
hypothesis but they're important issues

243
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,150
and as more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tuned in to my videos</font>

244
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,260
they stick around because I offer

245
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,970
something that's slightly different to a

246
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,170
lot I give a contextualized view on news

247
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology and mental health and</font>

248
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,680
well-being i'm not saying on the only

249
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,080
one who does it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like that is</font>

250
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,360
what i do offer and it's what a lot of

251
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,670
people warm too and so with that said um

252
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,220
the objective for 2017 in 2016 it was

253
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just about can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i make weekly videos</font>

254
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,250
again that was gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a really</font>

255
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,720
difficult thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hadn't done it</font>

256
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,089
for a good couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years and it was</font>

257
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,400
tough but I managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and it</font>

258
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,650
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a video for the sake</font>

259
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,070
of it every week it was getting one done

260
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,230
and so what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did here was I produced</font>

261
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,950
this is what the production a bit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

262
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,620
operation cycle for one video is and

263
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,300
again if you're watching on facebook

264
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll read it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out to you so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

265
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,100
I do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one video if I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all done</font>

266
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,930
unfortunately I'm not in a situation to

267
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,820
do that at the moment but first of all I

268
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,130
have to research the video that's just

269
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">not researching the subject matter but</font>

270
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,990
also looking for audio clips video clips

271
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,810
and screenshots then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to script</font>

272
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,750
it out add structure I've then got to

273
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,910
film it myself and present it myself

274
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,000
I've then got to edit it I've then got

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,910
to export the video then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

276
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,020
upload it one

277
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,110
for YouTube 12 facebook I've then got to

278
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,360
do optimizations so whether that's SEO

279
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,080
doing the titles the tags or it's doing

280
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,480
video programming annotations making

281
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,310
sure it's presented well so it's easy

282
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,620
for you guys to consume then I was doing

283
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,450
quite well then just on the back of it

284
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,730
closed captions this is what I haven't

285
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,770
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do every time but I do try</font>

286
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,320
my best<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have an international audience</font>

287
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,080
and I really respect people for taking

288
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,390
the time to watch my videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when a</font>

289
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,440
video is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will type out what I've</font>

290
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,170
said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video yes I do script it but</font>

291
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,510
the script is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guide I then have</font>

292
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,040
to look at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the way I've said</font>

293
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,410
words in the video and i will type it

294
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,080
all out sink it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the audio</font>

295
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll have to then tweak it and then i</font>

296
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,910
export it into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> srt file which I can</font>

297
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,980
then upload to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook so people on</font>

298
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook can have closed captions as</font>

299
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,400
well that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to do all</font>

300
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time and then finally marketing</font>

301
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,420
which is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very good at</font>

302
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,820
I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get time to do with</font>

303
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,590
everything else I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on but</font>

304
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,170
that's about seeding the content out but

305
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,420
also building communities I don't want

306
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,310
to spam people with my videos I want to

307
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">build relationships with people that</font>

308
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,810
this content can really help so that is

309
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,440
um that that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it takes to</font>

310
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,210
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> one video so hopefully that and</font>

311
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,370
that might be eye opening to some of you

312
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,600
um highlight politicians on you chief

313
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,680
for coming in and oh he's just

314
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,090
disappeared he says it wasn't working

315
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:01,640
hopefully it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and so mark has</font>

316
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,690
just said I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there are companies</font>

317
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,370
who can freshly caption your videos that

318
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are there are which gets to the</font>

319
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,640
next point so last year it was about can

320
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I make weekly video content because I</font>

321
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,870
had to have some faith and I really had

322
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for it and it worked thankfully</font>

323
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I was incredibly grateful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

324
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,420
and for all the support you've put into

325
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,600
me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing i did was i set</font>

326
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,890
up a Patrian account now Patrian is an

327
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,910
amazing website

328
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,750
looked at for a very very long time and

329
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,370
Patrian is a website where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

330
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,500
Kickstarter but it's remotely fee and

331
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,750
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is every month someone can</font>

332
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,360
donate<font color="#E5E5E5"> X amount of money a dollar a</font>

333
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,670
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> $10 20 some people have even done</font>

334
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,160
forty dollars and when I first announced

335
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,250
it it was scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm exposing</font>

336
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,260
myself to my friends and my family I've

337
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,660
left a very well-paid job at a big media

338
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,000
organization and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of saying I'm</font>

339
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,100
gonna try and do this myself um but I

340
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,250
had a at least 20 people put faith in me

341
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a lot of them put in a lot of money</font>

342
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it put pressure on me but helpful</font>

343
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,010
pressure to really go for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what</font>

344
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,350
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing last year is building it</font>

345
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,730
up now it brings us to 2017 there are

346
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,740
two stages to this and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this any</font>

347
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,450
a scheme where I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together a business</font>

348
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,460
plan of what my objective is for three

349
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">years and what the money needs to be to</font>

350
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,580
make this business work and forgive me

351
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">for taking a while to get to the</font>

352
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,130
announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I wanted to give a lot</font>

353
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of context</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show where we are right</font>

354
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,420
now but my honest my honest plan is to

355
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,790
build a media organization that is

356
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">around education and value systems so</font>

357
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,530
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like a news network but it's</font>

358
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,930
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about reporting the news it's</font>

359
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,260
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the key news stories which</font>

360
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,890
really hold up a mirror to society and

361
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,630
world events that we can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font>

362
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,720
and give a more nuanced perspective on

363
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,329
what we can learn from it and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

364
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,319
prevent these things from happening

365
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,990
again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting angry about</font>

366
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,079
things although understandable just

367
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,730
fuels more bitterness and resentment

368
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,010
between different factions of society

369
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,930
when I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's about building</font>

370
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,580
common ground and there are two key

371
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,990
examples where I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been able</font>

372
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last year one was on brexit I</font>

373
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:41,510
was someone who voted um<font color="#E5E5E5"> III voted to</font>

374
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,130
remain but I was someone who was very

375
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,830
much in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead camp for certain</font>

376
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,890
periods and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did my videos</font>

377
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,240
about why I did what I did I also

378
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,220
acknowledge why people voted leave and I

379
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,810
looked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> common ground and I found</font>

380
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,920
that there were people watching my

381
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,880
videos who voted leave who respected

382
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,680
what I did and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also understood i</font>

383
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,310
respected what they did so that meant a

384
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,560
lot and was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye-opening the second</font>

385
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,030
was the u.s. election not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only we've</font>

386
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,710
been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach out to trump</font>

387
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,900
supporters after the election but

388
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,350
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Democratic primary of</font>

389
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,120
the Bernie Sanders conceded to Hillary

390
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,280
Clinton there are a lot of Bernie or

391
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,660
bust people there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

392
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,710
who didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> two votes Hillary</font>

393
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,530
Clinton I explained that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was in</font>

394
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,810
the election that I wouldn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

395
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,370
approach I probably would vote for

396
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,430
Hillary Clinton but I did it in a way

397
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,710
that I said but I hear out if you if

398
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,120
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not voting Hillary Clinton I</font>

399
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,370
totally understand why you're doing it

400
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,320
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to build common ground</font>

401
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,900
now this is not to say people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

402
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,610
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with everything I say I don't</font>

403
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">always get it right but if i make videos</font>

404
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,500
with that amount of humility and that

405
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,960
amount of open-mindedness it means we

406
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">can have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation about</font>

407
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,160
things and by having open dialogue and

408
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,800
having open connections I think we can

409
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,080
really make a difference on some of the

410
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,820
big issues and that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want my</font>

411
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,520
media organizations to be about in the

412
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,420
next couple of years so with all that

413
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,090
said what is the situation I had a

414
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,620
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what it is to be</font>

415
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,250
self-sustaining now i am making weekly

416
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,380
videos at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment but i'm also doing</font>

417
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,080
consultancy work to pay the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bills now</font>

418
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,240
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not me saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to pay</font>

419
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bills for me or I'm not saying it</font>

420
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,530
bluntly like that I will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

421
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a consultant for as long as I</font>

422
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,150
need to but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love to get</font>

423
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,520
to a point where I don't have to rely on

424
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as an income and it means I can</font>

425
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,930
invest my time fully into researching

426
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,360
and building a media organization where

427
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,430
I can employ editors and therefore I can

428
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,780
focus more on the research and the

429
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,340
present in and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the videos and</font>

430
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,080
it means I I don't have to worry about

431
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,750
distractions I can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> do consultancy</font>

432
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,279
and work with some great

433
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">organisations who I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be working</font>

434
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:06,799
with over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> horizon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but by being</font>

435
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,659
financially supported by you as patrons

436
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,669
it means I don't have to worry about

437
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,979
sponsorship when I do promote things on

438
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,539
my channel is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I've been paid</font>

439
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,450
is because I love what an organizational

440
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,070
person does like my friend who designs

441
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,320
these shirts team Snowden I spoke about

442
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in a video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called all right I'm</font>

443
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good friends of her and I really</font>

444
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the work she does and so we found a</font>

445
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:31,799
way to cross-promote once again having

446
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,070
transparency so where are we at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

447
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,409
moment for the last three months I've

448
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,539
been really<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to hitting the four</font>

449
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,369
hundred dollar mark and obviously the

450
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,440
final amount is one and a half thousand

451
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,960
dollars but every month people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had</font>

452
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,149
to reduce their amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> or stop donating</font>

453
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:50,909
because of financial situations which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

454
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:52,859
totally understand and when they

455
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,869
apologized saying sorry I can't support

456
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:58,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">you anymore I'm like you kidding me like</font>

457
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:01,139
I owe you you've put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your faith in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

458
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:03,059
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so any amount that can be donated</font>

459
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">means the world and people shouldn't</font>

460
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,869
feel guilty if they can't support you

461
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,999
financially because it's not an

462
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,889
obligation there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways to</font>

463
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,320
support me but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to put it visually</font>

464
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,679
this is where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are at the moment we're</font>

465
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,450
at twenty percent so I'm at three

466
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,009
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eight dollars a month at the</font>

467
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,849
moment and it is a big amount but I

468
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,099
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been driving home this</font>

469
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,979
target because I've been still trying to

470
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,629
find my feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of things I've</font>

471
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">been trying to work out how Patrian</font>

472
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,589
works I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to find out and</font>

473
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:37,200
how it is with you know my video

474
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,879
production in terms of what sort of

475
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,759
content I make so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font>

476
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">of content the idea is that over a month</font>

477
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,489
each week<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do one on well-being you</font>

478
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,769
do one on science and technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

479
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,229
do one on world events but of course a

480
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,580
world event could happen at any time

481
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,409
that grabs my attention and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might</font>

482
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:57,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">do to social commentaries in a month but</font>

483
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the idea is on the fourth week is I</font>

484
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,940
do a video format called<font color="#CCCCCC"> duck watch you</font>

485
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,529
may have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> me do an episode or two of</font>

486
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,869
where I watch a documentary of a friend

487
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,299
and then we discuss it the idea is

488
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,940
eventually that becomes a monthly format

489
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,799
but I just haven't been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

490
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I've been juggling so</font>

491
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,880
together and then if there is a fifth

492
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,500
week in a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would then do an ask</font>

493
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
miles so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of ambitious</font>

494
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:28,080
mission here and so in terms of the

495
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,860
battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan once the 1500 dollars a</font>

496
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,440
month is hit that's when it gets

497
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,390
exciting and the reason it gets exciting

498
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,230
then is I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then entirely focus on</font>

499
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,170
this and although the first goal is 1500

500
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,290
dollars every like twenty to fifty

501
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,780
dollars something will then happen for

502
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,730
example if I then<font color="#CCCCCC"> write is another</font>

503
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,100
twenty dollars I'll then be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

504
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,290
know get a premium account to back up

505
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,630
all my videos little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit will help you</font>

506
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,720
know store resources and it and give me

507
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,780
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more flexibility I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then be</font>

508
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,960
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invest in another microphone so</font>

509
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,420
i can then go out and about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

510
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,580
what i'm most excited about is do a

511
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,309
weekly podcast show a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people been</font>

512
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,870
wanting me to do a podcast show for

513
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,330
years it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an hour long eventually</font>

514
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,500
when I've got enough money it will be

515
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,380
videoed as well but it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wrap it</font>

516
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,820
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> called something like connecting the</font>

517
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,040
dots I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know so many celebrities</font>

518
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">politicians and scientists around the</font>

519
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,000
world who've wanted to have these

520
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversations to me for a long time this</font>

521
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,600
will become a weekly thing and so

522
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,820
although that the videos i do on YouTube

523
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,010
and Facebook will be shorter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

524
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,960
about key issues it means we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

525
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,600
podcast show where we just discuss the

526
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,970
way the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently is and just get</font>

527
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,880
different perspectives in and so I'd be

528
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,820
really really excited about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

529
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,770
that that that will be probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

530
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,630
closing you know one thousand seven

531
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,760
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty dollars so the first</font>

532
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
jump to $1,500 is a big jump but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font>

533
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be honest that is</font>

534
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,690
the sustainability number for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

535
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,520
know be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus entirely on this</font>

536
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,270
and and trust me that be me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tight</font>

537
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,480
budget compared to what I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

538
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,460
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sacrifice everything</font>

539
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,360
I can to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this work and for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

540
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,730
who's not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a patron before there</font>

541
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">are different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tiers now last year there</font>

542
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,750
were some rewards I'm still

543
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">qing up with people and i owe some skype</font>

544
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,290
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be personal</font>

545
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,050
postcards which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i still been meaning to</font>

546
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,390
send out and um I have made mistakes and

547
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,850
I have learned a lot in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past seven</font>

548
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,950
months another thing that happened was

549
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,190
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a video on youtube I was</font>

550
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,260
losing subscribers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in my</font>

551
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,440
2016 video I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a net loss every</font>

552
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,810
month of like 150 200 so although i was

553
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,730
getting new people subscribing I was

554
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,560
losing more but I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know what</font>

555
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to stick at this because</font>

556
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually it'll pay off and what</font>

557
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,190
happened in November it was a net gain

558
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,160
facebook has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been blowing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and so</font>

559
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,330
although there's been a lot of endurance

560
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,780
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am willing to give this</font>

561
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,910
another year and if by the summer I can

562
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,790
hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the self-sustaining thing I can't</font>

563
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,740
explain how exciting is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

564
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,510
means that once you hit the

565
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,640
self-sustaining amount anything on top

566
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
of that that is made<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh actually some of</font>

567
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,980
that 1500 we'll go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm investing it</font>

568
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,570
now into this home uh anything made over

569
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,400
that can then be invested into<font color="#E5E5E5"> plying</font>

570
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,500
editors and stuff and I don't want to

571
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">get too far ahead but in the three year</font>

572
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,050
plan by the third year my attic would be

573
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,330
converted into a i'm going to call it a

574
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,820
newsroom studio but a permanent studio

575
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,760
and the way i<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it being used is a HQ</font>

576
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,240
and for activism a lot of my key

577
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,010
activist friends whether they're people

578
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">around doing encryption protecting</font>

579
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,400
against surveillance where its people

580
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,100
fighting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil liberties you know</font>

581
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,470
women's rights gay rights all these sort

582
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,900
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want it to become an</font>

583
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,660
opportunity to bring in great voices and

584
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,820
have open discussions about the biggest

585
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,760
pressing issues and of course the

586
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,490
environmental crisis which is so so

587
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,320
important please caption using English

588
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,600
do not use English auto-generated which

589
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,190
is for voice recognition for the deaf

590
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,350
and hard of hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carol says carol so</font>

591
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually type out I type them out</font>

592
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,610
myself um on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos which is what i</font>

593
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,160
was saying earlier it takes me a good

594
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,450
hour

595
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,159
to type out so yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess just to</font>

596
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,899
end before I openness to questions and

597
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,399
forgive me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> missed any comments</font>

598
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:52,600
on that and I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank everyone for</font>

599
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,389
tuning in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and on facebook</font>

600
00:26:57,389 --> 00:27:00,279
what I love about my audience is it may

601
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,980
not be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest out there but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

602
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,760
such a cool community that I'm really

603
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">blown away by how deep our relationship</font>

604
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:16,090
is and how supportive you are and you

605
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if you have a strong core</font>

606
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,330
audience as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience grows that core</font>

607
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,399
will be you know what keeps this

608
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,919
together and so the plan over this year

609
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,470
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep making video content each</font>

610
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,549
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to build increasingly build a</font>

611
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:35,799
strong structure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to build</font>

612
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,480
Patrian and say something that's going

613
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be changing this year is anyone who</font>

614
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,630
donated and let me finish first before

615
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,309
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at pledging if anyone's</font>

616
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,940
thinking of doing it originally how it

617
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,010
worked was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you paid five dollars a</font>

618
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,679
month you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> invited at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of</font>

619
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,809
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> month to a monthly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> livestream if</font>

620
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,029
you paid ten dollars or more you got

621
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:00,820
invited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a weekly one this is not</font>

622
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,970
confirmed yet because I with my patrons

623
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,799
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weekly it's like a board meeting</font>

624
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,960
we have a good chat like this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also</font>

625
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,600
go through figures and updates and I

626
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,730
keep you know anyone who's donating

627
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,620
deserves to know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything that's</font>

628
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,299
how I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it transparent and</font>

629
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:22,740
open but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change it so that the</font>

630
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten-dollar one goes and so anyone</font>

631
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,179
donating five dollars or more comes to

632
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:30,700
the weekly and then every month it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

633
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,159
public one like this and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means the</font>

634
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,200
monthly one can be a way to outreach and

635
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,909
say this is what's been going on and

636
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:40,389
hopefully we get more people so to

637
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:43,289
anyone who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I do</font>

638
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,210
firstly thank you in advanced and even

639
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,610
if it's just one dollar a month which is

640
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 60 p over here in the UK even if</font>

641
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,080
you feel that's not a lot it means it

642
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,139
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think at the moment we're</font>

643
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:57,600
at like six

644
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,799
donors so if we can get it to a hundred

645
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,169
you know of just one dollars that'd be

646
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:04,830
great but anything is appreciative

647
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,389
appreciated so you can do it by going to

652
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:30,730
and youtube so yeah that in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nutshell</font>

653
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,659
is what the plan is um and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

654
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:36,630
see people like you know the young turks

655
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,190
you know employing to investigative

656
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,200
reporters for 500 you know half a

657
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">million dollars and I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500</font>

658
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,220
dollars a month but you know it's it is

659
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being efficient and the amount</font>

660
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,519
I've put into this already um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

661
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:59,320
am I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running at a loss at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment</font>

662
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,299
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be worth it if it if it</font>

663
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,360
works and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony comes from as I said</font>

664
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,120
a huge media organization plays you

665
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,970
don't I used to work at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Guardian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

666
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,590
at a very romanticized idea about the

667
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,600
Guardian when I joined I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

668
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same with any organization there's a</font>

669
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot i love about them but at a time when</font>

670
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think they're downscaling in a lot of</font>

671
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways because they have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sustainable</font>

672
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,320
and in some ways they have become their

673
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,360
own establishment because they have

674
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,750
legacy problems and they have their own

675
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,460
ways of doing things that you know

676
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,470
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change with the times this is</font>

677
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,750
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting opportunity because as</font>

678
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,669
I've talked about in many videos the

679
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:41,740
monopoly on I don't say the monopoly on

680
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,940
truth because truth is subjective

681
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,870
everyone has their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own opinion on what</font>

682
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,269
the actual truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but um and I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

683
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was I wasn't hating on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> T what was saw</font>

684
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,799
in hating on<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyt if some thought I was</font>

685
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,330
hating I wasn't I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> merely pointing</font>

686
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,519
out that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the budget they're</font>

687
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're looking for is huge and</font>

688
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,510
mine is tiny in comparison sand so I

689
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,889
know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of organizations</font>

690
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:08,049
doing this at the moment I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

691
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly when he doesn't know I</font>

692
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,480
in talks with<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyt and we're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

693
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,140
ways of working together so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

694
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:23,360
wouldn't worry about that brazen might

695
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,130
put my point was merely that this is a

696
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,429
shoestring<font color="#CCCCCC"> budget and actually if you</font>

697
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,559
look at TYT in their story they started

698
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,630
in this sort of way they did a weekly

699
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,050
show in a living room<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> genk and the</font>

700
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,059
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the guys and over years they</font>

701
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:40,220
built it up and that's exactly the route

702
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the early</font>

703
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,460
differences whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyt is on</font>

704
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,170
investigative journalism and reporting

705
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,210
on the news this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be more</font>

706
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,150
about value systems and looking at new

707
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:55,280
ways of thinking and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've</font>

708
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,170
mentioned many times before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

709
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,670
know it's the diversity of tactics how

710
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,220
do we make progress in society and it's

711
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the different ways of</font>

712
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,790
making a difference and and then

713
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,940
collaborating in those ways so yeah I've

714
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,679
been in talks with tyt for a long time

715
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,210
so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out if there's if</font>

716
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,679
I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> join their network at the very</font>

717
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,760
least but we'll have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait and see but</font>

718
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,730
yeah ultimately it starts with me

719
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,790
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone has</font>

720
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,530

<font color="#CCCCCC">the moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm able to get it done my</font>

769
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,349
point is and that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

770
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">this self-sustaining level is once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

771
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,380
is hit it just frees up resources to

772
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:06,349
then improve the quality and I really I

773
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:07,820
used to work wear this at work but I did

777
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,290
organizations like<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyt may fall into</font>

778
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">same traps another that other large</font>

779
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,190
media companies do despite their

780
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,870
fundraising abilities use their central

781
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,600
I structures that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a snog</font>

782
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,460
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a personal criticism</font>

783
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,610
that is always the thing you have to be

784
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,590
careful of is as you grow you have

785
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,750
legacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues which means the bigger you</font>

786
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,060
are the harder it is to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and adapt</font>

787
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,550
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyt with their investigative</font>

788
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,790
reporting are really and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

789
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,680
progressive force against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump</font>

791
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in a really good position but it</font>

792
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,730
also means<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk runs of becoming an</font>

793
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,170
established form of that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

794
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">know i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that got a really good</font>

diversity of people so yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says</font>

796
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,080
hey miles how would you advise becoming

797
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,460
more involved in activism in terms of

798
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,120
community communication of ideas that's

799
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,960
a whole video is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any um well</font>

you've seen the video I did called a

802
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,290
better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue if you go my my</font>

803
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,610
youtube or facebook there's a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

804
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,290
did called a better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue and</font>

805
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,840
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the crux of of having</font>

806
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,160
conversations with people i know i know

807
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,010
i can't on this so this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then if</font>

808
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,110

882
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:13,329
make sure I wasn't criticizing I was

883
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,939
just merely pointing stuff out hey the

884
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:21,130
awesome youtuber great name um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in</font>

885
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,140
the UK if so did your interest in u.s.

886
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,640
politics start with Bernie's primary

887
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,529
campaign all right now I've always had

888
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,359
an interest I've always done it on us

889
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,089
politics because<font color="#E5E5E5"> US politics affects the</font>

890
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:33,729
UK if the US doesn't get their climate

891
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:36,939
policy sorted we have no hope over here

892
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:39,670
and so although some people may station

893
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,519
I focus on UK politics I think of global

894
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,170
issues and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of global issues</font>

895
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,359
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> where where is the catalyst to</font>

896
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,089
make change and it is in the US and I

897
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:51,099
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what I add strength to is when</font>

898
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,679
I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos about the u.s. progressive</font>

899
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,259
movement etc a lot of Americans like it

900
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:58,089
because it gives them a heightened

901
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,160
consciousness about the fact that their

902
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,890
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> has an impact on the world and</font>

903
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,329
it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to necessarily be a</font>

904
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,459
negative one it can be one for positive

905
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,380
change in and so that's why I do what I

906
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,900
do could someone type my patron thing in

907
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do it here</font>

908
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:14,999

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,599
have Bernie Sanders skype in as well and

918
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,799
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were going to have a conversation</font>

919
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:05,229
conversation about progressive politics

920
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:07,630
on both side the Atlantic I was just

921
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,609
waiting from Washington DC<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Bernie's</font>

922
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,309
people and then that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he started</font>

923
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:14,619
getting a huge traction and so his

924
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,329
people said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he was no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer able</font>

925
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:19,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it to an interview and so I was</font>

926
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:22,029
holding on for that and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

927
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:24,489
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> got back to jury people's jeremy</font>

929
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,719
think globally act locally absolutely

00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you don't mean it like that</font>

939
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:07,269
well Annie seriously and even if after a

940
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:08,410
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not able to do it anymore</font>

941
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to cut it that's absolutely</font>

942
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it clear</font>

943
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,519
there is no guilt attached for this any

944
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:24,380
help is help and yeah Luke Syria

945
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,960
thank you so so much I don't know if I

946
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,059
want to read that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in out entirely what</font>

947
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:40,069
Luke said mark one pound is a lot man

948
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:42,259
it's this this is the thing as well is

949
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:46,720
I'm all about decentralized power and

950
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:49,910
having that here's an example right when

951
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,279
I first started<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a few people</font>

952
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:54,019
contribute huge amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money which</font>

953
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:57,259
was of course amazing the problem that

954
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">came with that was when individuals can</font>

955
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,329
do it anymore that takes a huge chunk so

956
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,529
as i said i was about to hit four

957
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:04,730
hundred dollars and it's gone right back

958
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,230
down to three hundred dollars because a

959
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,930
few great contributors have had to

960
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,109
downsize which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally understandable</font>

961
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:14,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so if i can get lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people to do</font>

962
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:17,359
just one dollar a month for example that

963
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,019
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people leaving</font>

964
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:24,500
will not shake the boat too much and if

965
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that makes sense Victor thank you so so</font>

966
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:35,000
much at Franco be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Z day London got</font>

967
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,420
stick aid I'll talk I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a video</font>

968
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's decade at some point about why it</font>

969
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,660
stopped because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real big</font>

970
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,269
turning point in my life the last 1i I

971
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:47,720
went went into debt because of it it was

972
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:58,849
a tough gig cool um well I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to</font>

973
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:00,769
stay on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if anyone's got any</font>

974
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,960
questions or anything do let me know i'm

975
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,450
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to refresh the patron page so</font>

976
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,150
we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 315 was 66 and we're now at 0</font>

977
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:19,069
has an updated yet maybe it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure</font>

978
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:27,200
update in a bit what do you know it was

979
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,609
one that Martin just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I've been very</font>

980
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:29,960
interested in decentralization

981
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,180
especially online so i did this video

982
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,019
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago called</font>

983
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:36,349
decentralize everything and there was a

984
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:37,790
big sort of cab

985
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,260
that video I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never did and I actually</font>

986
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,110
scripted the caveat to do last year and

987
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,730
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I will</font>

988
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,400
return to it because decentralization of

989
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,430
power is not the end goal UD centralized

990
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,770
power to their network it if that makes

991
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,770
sense so for example decentralized

992
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,260
energy systems so everyone starts

993
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,210
producing their own energy but that's

994
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,410
not good if you just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

995
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">because what if my solar panels break</font>

996
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you need to network it</font>

997
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,250
have a grid i can feed into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

998
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,290
has a power cut I can help them if I

999
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:12,380
have a power cut they can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font>

1000
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,330
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should</font>

1001
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,520
happen with information it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

1002
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,160
with access to technology it should have

1003
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,850
to be to do with wealth and when we talk

1004
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,250
about wealth i'm not talking about money

1005
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:28,250
I'm talking about access to resources to

1006
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:33,260
the necessities of life but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1007
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,150
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this guy this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1008
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,710
the futurism value systems i've been

1009
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,660
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a video i'm going to very</font>

1010
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,630
soon is about the biggest challenge of

1011
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,850
our generation which is that as

1012
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,940
technology moves forward it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1013
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,390
challenge value systems of those who

1014
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,770
control information wealth power energy

1015
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,830
political will and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want</font>

1016
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hold on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's how</font>

1017
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:03,170
they've always lived and what might

1018
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,390
happen is they use technology to

1019
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,700
maintain that power and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when it</font>

1020
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,040
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scary whereas if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1021
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,450
break free of it we can empower the

1022
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,230
masses in a way that there is no

1023
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:22,370
centralized power and it is a full of

1024
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,340
anarchism but it's it's actually

1025
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,580
structured because of the speed in which

1026
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,070
information will travel across society

1027
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,450
now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a conversation for another</font>

1028
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,240
time but um yeah there's a lot for me to

1029
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,490

two baskets in one basket we've got this

1062
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,490

two extreme factions in society how what

percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the population actually</font>

00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:52,410
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage but it takes one person</font>

00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,590
one person to shoot a cop are those left

1071
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,930
this you put it that story in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

1072
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,550
then that's your narrative these

1073
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,640
intolerant leftists they ban<font color="#CCCCCC"> song from</font>

1074
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,480
speaking at you

1075
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,570
versity those goddamn leftist there's a

1076
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,810
shooting at school those right wing is

1077
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:15,010
protecting gun control a racist attack

oh those<font color="#E5E5E5"> right-wingers extremists it's</font>

1079
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:20,109
not to say that right-wing and left-wing

1080
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:23,530
extreme extreme<font color="#CCCCCC"> ism doesn't exist but</font>

1081
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,510
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in context</font>

1082
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,730
because what you find is between these

1083
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:32,020
two buckets or baskets is people like me

1084
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,420
who don't know where I fit because I'm

1085
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,400
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the news and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

1086
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,890
and that and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

1087
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:42,550
thinking you know there's actually a

1088
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,869
spectrum of political beliefs and the

1089
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:48,670
news is getting filled up with that

1090
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,410
there's a great quote I read at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1091
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">newseum which is and when a dog bites a</font>

1092
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,260
man it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new story but when a man</font>

1093
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,109
bites a dog it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and that's the exact</font>

1094
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:01,869
problem we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a day of anti new</font>

1095
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:18,040
ones sorry guys not all the comments

1096
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,720
come up on my fight on my phone so I'm

1097
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,960
now reading them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here and what my</font>

1098
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,670
thoughts on universal basic income in

1099
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,990
response to the automation and many

1100
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,480
people's jobs I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is saying</font>

1101
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,270
I've been wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see for about five</font>

1102
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,800
six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and the fact it's been</font>

1103
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,470
discussed in the mainstream is fantastic

1104
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:41,640
I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be tried out and I</font>

1105
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,350
mean I'm someone who believes in the

1106
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,720
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a resource-based economy but</font>

1107
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,280
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that we can</font>

1108
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,250
make happen I think it's an

1109
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,250
inevitability

1110
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,670
[Music]

1111
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,400
this is it when I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1112
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation about let's say Donald</font>

1113
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,240
Trump I'm not here talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Trump</font>

1114
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,580
supporters or Trump talk about the

1115
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,190
issues like there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

1116
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,570
friends with on Facebook who you'd be

1117
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really surprised with some people who</font>

1118
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are from what are arguably like quite</font>

1119
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,990
extreme aspects of the media but I like

1120
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,640
having conversations of them because we

1121
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,560
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree on some stuff and other stuff</font>

1122
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,630
we fundamentally disagree but at least

1123
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,930
have those conversations like another

1124
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,370
video might do at some point is why I

1125
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,160
never get angry anymore I did touch upon

1126
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,350
it on my on the quest for<font color="#E5E5E5"> global empathy</font>

1127
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked about having patience and it's</font>

1128
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,830
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized that we're all</font>

1129
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,170
victims of circumstance we're all people

1130
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have believed the way we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1131
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of language we've been taught and the</font>

1132
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,920
experiences we've had I don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry</font>

1133
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,860
of people yeah I get disheartened when I

1134
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,110
see six stuff happen on the news like

1135
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,730
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that be up that and</font>

1136
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,590
tortured that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentally ill guy just the</font>

1137
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">other day absolutely sick and a just a</font>

1138
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,600
bummer and action easily taken against

1139
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,760
those individuals but do I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1140
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,970
people are inherently evil no you turn

1141
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,530
the clocks back<font color="#E5E5E5"> far enough there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1142
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where they didn't think that way</font>

1143
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,880
there was a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they were a baby</font>

1144
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,310
that was innocent so between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

1145
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,570
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby and where they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1146
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:30,190
something happened and it's not

1147
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:32,810
justifying their actions to explain and

1148
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,890
which is another video I did

1149
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,360
justification is not the same as

1150
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,490
explanation yes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should deal with them</font>

1151
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,050
yes they should go through the court of

1152
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:43,970
law and they should be you know serious

1153
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,340
implications should be done however<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

1154
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,780
that mean we can't have a rational look

1155
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,050
at what led them to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way you can</font>

1156
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,870
do both but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that aren't into</font>

1157
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">nuance want to break us in two different</font>

1158
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,340
camps<font color="#CCCCCC"> over you're an apologist for this</font>

00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,410
doing the weekly newsletter close to a

1220
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,690
monthly newsletter where i used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1221
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">facts and figures some people aren't</font>

1222
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and that's absolutely fine</font>

1223
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,859
but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it was about saying this is</font>

1224
00:56:57,859 --> 00:56:59,780
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and subscribers and patron</font>

1225
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,790
this is what the goal is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find</font>

1226
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if I communicate with my patrons</font>

1227
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,559
where we are it keeps me<font color="#E5E5E5"> grounded and it</font>

1228
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,480
means every step of the way you can have

1229
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,260
an input on what I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's not to</font>

1230
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,240
say though that patrons therefore have

1231
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,170
control on what I content<font color="#CCCCCC"> I create but</font>

1232
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,849
then it sort of goes into my whole thing

1233
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:22,910
about value systems which is life's not

1234
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,500
about telling people what's a thing

1235
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,569
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it's about if we reveal</font>

1236
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,190
ourselves and have an honest

1237
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,619
conversation about things with a common

1238
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:32,930
goal in mind it does influence what we

1239
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,450
think can do and as long as we're open

1240
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,460
and transparent about it even if it's

1241
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,619
not exactly what you wanted to see you

1242
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,900
can at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least understand it and be a part</font>

1243
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,440
of that conversation beyond so hopefully

1244
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,960
that makes sense as well one minute left

1245
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:59,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just want to finish as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just with a</font>

1249
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,000

1250
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,599
going to go and I I thought it'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1251
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:16,130
if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some more</font>

1252
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,480

1253
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,780
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do but I've gone for</font>

00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,790
it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 minutes then I was</font>

1255
