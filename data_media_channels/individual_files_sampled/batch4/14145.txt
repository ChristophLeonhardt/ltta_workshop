one here on Yonge Street with Serge he's pulled over on the northbound lanes and Serge tells us that he actually saw the person in the white Ryder van fleeing Serge what exactly did you see I was just parking here because that to go to the 5001 building there and I just heard the screeching I think it's something's some fire truck or something I heard a big screeching and then I looked over here I got the ticket came back here and I'm front of Shoppers Drug Mart see this is a white van it's a good white Ryder van it was a thing it just coming down the street going really slowly but you can tell it was a the front-end damage it was screeching and then he passed a rock button Rouge there and the shoppers and Rogers here then he turned up the street here he had front-end damage and everything and he was like wearing a black jacket you know I know older man you know black hair a little bit on the balding in the middle so an older man balding black hair any other we're just jumping out of the way it was like crazy something you see at a movie and then there was one couple guys ran up there then the police cars went over here and I went in the building came on and I see this it's unbelievable at the point at which you've seen him the main carnage of the road here in Yonge Street it's already occurred this is I guess presumably him on a getaway he's still trying to get away and still trying to because people were what's his truck on the sidewalk was on the sidewalk wasn't on the road so it looked to you that not only was he trying to get away but he was trying to take out pedestrians on Rue du use on the truck coming down the street I imagine people were screaming it was just like wow this creature dogs you could tell the front-end damage and he went up the street there now when you see the front-end damage real was gone and the fender was out and the you can tell the fender were touching the tires that's where the screeching was gone so he's extensive damage that's on the Beecroft Avenue right okay did and one guy got in someone's car and they chased them but then by then he made a left that's interesting you saw some just regular civilians as opposed to law enforcement chase yes yes yes yes not to be too morbid but on the front end of the truck was there like bloodstains or anything like that couldn't see sad sad very sad you
