1
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,870
Depending, you know, sometimes we’ll 
burn back from, say, like a cut over.

2
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,399
An area that's clear already, that, you 
know, it's not going to burn into,

3
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,998
for when the fire progresses towards it. 
Once it hits that burnt-out area

4
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:39,007
then it slows the progression right down.

5
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,750
We’re doing our best. We’ve opened our
doors up for over a good week now

6
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,270
to help the evacuees that require help.

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,770
We’re here until days end and
we’ve got to do what we've got to do.

8
00:01:16,770 --> 00:00:00,000
It's in our blood to help every 
individual out, not just ourselves.
