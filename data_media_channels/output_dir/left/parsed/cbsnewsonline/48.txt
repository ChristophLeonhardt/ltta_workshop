KOREA AND WE WILL DISCUSS THAT 
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND 
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IT NOW. 
BUT, I JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S A 
GREAT HONOR TO HAVE PRESIDENT 
MOON WITH US AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR COMING, MR. PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> 
>> WE HOPE TO GET A TRANSLATION 
FOR YOU SOON OF WHAT THE SOUTH 
KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN IS 
SAYING RIGHT NOW. 
ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE SHOWING YOU A
LIVE MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP AND SOUTH KOREAN 
PRESIDENT, MOON JAE-IN. 
LET'S LISTEN AND ONCE AGAIN. 
>> 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU FORMANTS 
AFTER OUR MEETING AND THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR SUPPORT. 
>> Translator: WE HAVE AN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE KOREANS 
AND DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH 
KOREA AND THERE'S A MESSAGE 
FROM CHAIRMAN KIM THAT HE 
WANTED ME TO CONVEY TO YOU. 
I'M PLEASED TO HAVE THIS OPTION 
TO GIVE YOU A READOUT OF THE 
DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM IMMEDIATELY AFTER RETURNING 
FROM PYONGYANG. 
I HOPE IT WILL COME TO THE 
EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND PEACE ON 
THE GREAT PENINSULA, AS WELL IS 
FOR THE U.S. TO HAVE DIALOGUE 
AND ACCEPTANCE WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM. 
IT WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT 
CHAIRMAN KIM PERSONALLY 
EXPRESSED EFFORTS OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION TO THE WORLD'S 
MEDIA. 
THE KOREAN AGREEMENT REACHED 
WITH PRESIDENT KIM, 150,000 
CITIZENS OF PYONGYANG AND NORTH 
KOREANS WILL RELINQUISH THE 
NUCLEAR PROGRAMS, AND IT'S BEEN 
OFFICIAL LYSED THAT CANNOT BE 
REVERSED. 
FOR THE APPROACH, WE ARE IN THE 
PROCESS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM 
THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
SOLVE IN DECADES PAST. 
THANK YOU FOR THIS, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
CHAIRMAN KIM REPEATEDLY 
CONVEYED HIS UNWAVERING TRUST 
FOR YOU WHILE EXPRESSING HIS 
HOPE TO MEET YOU SOON TO 
QUICKLY CONCLUDE THE 
DENUCLEARIZATION PROCESS WITH 
YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE, INDEED, 
THE ONLY PRESIDENT WE CAN SOLVE 
THIS PROBLEM. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE SUMMER TO 
TAKE PLACE AND WISH YOU GREAT 
SUCCESS. 
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S SIGNIFICANT 
BECAUSE IT MEANS OUR ALLIANCE 
IS BEING EXPANDED TO THE 
ECONOMIC REALM, AS WELL. 
I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE HAVE 
REVISED THIS AGREEMENT TO HAVE 
MORE FARE AND BENEFICIAL 
AGREEMENTS AND THROUGH THIS 
AGREEMENT, I HOPE THAT THE TIES 
WILL BE PROMOTED EVEN FURTHER. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE WILL BE HAVING A SECOND 
SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 
THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL BE 
DEALING WITH THAT SUBJECT. MIKE 
POMPEO HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH 
THEM AND HE'S GOING TO SEE THAT 
THAT WILL BE ANNOUNCED. 
THE LOCATION IS TO BE 
DETERMINED. 
WE ARE BOTH VERY MUCH LOOKING 
FORWARD TO HAVING THIS AND IT 
WILL BE BETWEEN NORTH KOREA, 
AND THE U.S. AND BE SIMILAR TO 
THE FORMAT WE HAD BEFORE. 
IT MOST LIKELY WILL BE A 
DIFFERENT LOCATION. 
AGAIN, IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED 
PRETTY SOON AND A LOT OF 
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. 
I SEE TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM ON 
BEHALF OF CHAIRMAN KIM TOWARD 
MAKING A DEAL AND I THINK THAT 
IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY GOOD. 
WE ARE NOT IN A RUSH AND 
THERE'S NO HURRY. 
WE GOT BACK THREE MONTHS AGO OR 
SO AND WE'VE MADE MORE PROGRESS 
THAN ANYBODY HAS MADE EVER, 
FRANKLY, WITH REGARD TO NORTH 
KOREA AND I BELIEVE NORTH KOREA 
HAS TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC 
POTENTIAL AND I BELIEVE THAT 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND THE PEOPLE OF 
NORTH KOREA WANT TO SEE THAT 
POTENTIAL AND WE WILL HELP THEM 
TO THAT IN. 
THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY GOOD 
AND IN SOME WAYS, 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT WE 
WILL BE HAVING THE SECOND 
SUMMIT IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT 
FUTURE. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
I'M MEETING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN 
ON THURSDAY WHEN I GET BACK 
FROM THESE MEETINGS. 
WE WILL MEET AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
AT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS GOING 
ON. 
WE WANT TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY 
AND WE WANT TO HAVE OPENNESS 
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING 
WITH ROD AT THAT TIME. 
WE WILL HAVE A MEETING ON 
THURSDAY WHEN I GET BACK. 
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE MEETING WITH 
A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE INCLUDING 
PRESIDENT MOON AND OVER THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS, AS YOU KNOW, WE 
ARE MEETING WITH MANY 
COUNTRIES. I 
WILL BE BACK ON THURSDAY AND 
WHEN I GET BACK WE WILL HAVE A 
MEETING. 
I SPOKE WITH ROD TODAY AND WE 
WILL HAVE A MEETING ON THURSDAY 
WHEN I GET BACK TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
I WANT TO SAY THE COUNTRY, THE 
UNITED STATES, AS PRESIDENT 
MOON POINTED OUT WHEN WE FIRST 
MET, THE U.S. IS DOING BETTER 
ECONOMICALLY THAN WE'VE EVER 
DONE BEFORE. 
THE NUMBERS ARE OUTSTANDING AND 
NEW NUMBERS WILL BE RELEASED 
THAT I THINK WILL CONTINUE THIS 
FORWARD MARCH AND WE HAVE 
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR THE 
UPSIDE. 
I'M EXCITED ABOUT OUR NEW TRADE 
AGREEMENT. 
IT'S A NEW AGREEMENT, NOT AT 
ALL WHAT WAS WRITTEN. 
IT'S A BRAND NEW AGREEMENT AND 
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT FOR 
THE UNITED STATES. I 
BELIEVE IT'S GOOD FOR BOTH 
COUNTRIES. 
THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE DOING 
IN THE UNITED STATES, WHETHER 
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS OR 
EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS -- THIS 
MOMENT -- WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE 
WORKING IN THE U.S. THAN EVER 
BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. 
IT'S A NUMBER THAT PEOPLE DID 
NOT EXPECT TO SEE. 
IT IS A NUMBER THAT NOBODY 
THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN, CERTAINLY 
WITHIN TWO YEARS. 
WE ARE NOT EVEN IN TWO YEARS OF 
THE ADMINISTRATION. 
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING IN 
THE U.S. THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. 
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE AMONG 
THE BEST WE'VE EVER HAD FOR 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, THE LOWEST 
WE'VE EVER HAD. 
ASIAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, THE 
LOWEST WE'VE EVER HAD AND WE 
ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT. 
ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE MANY 
COMPANIES MOVING BACK INTO THE 
U.S. IN MOST CASES, IT IS BACK. 
THEY LEFT AND NOW THEY ARE 
COMING BACK. 
THEY ALL WANT TO BE WHERE THE 
ACTION IS. I 
APPRECIATE YOUR KIND WORDS BUT 
OUR ECONOMY IS THE ENVY RIGHT 
NOW OF THE WORLD. 
WHERE THE FASTEST GROWING 
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. 
THINK OF IT. 
AS LARGE AS WE ARE, WE ARE THE 
FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY IN THE 
WORLD, UP $10 TRILLION AND WE 
ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING 
BRIEFLY AFTER A MEETING WITH 
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT, MOON 
JAE-IN HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. 
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THERE 
WILL BE A SECOND SUMMIT WITH 
NORTH KOREA COMING UP IN THE 
VERY NEAR FUTURE. 
HE SAID HE THINKS, QUOTE, A LOT 
OF PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. 
ALSO, WE ARE IN NO RUSH. 
HE QUICKLY ADDRESSED THE ROD 
ROSENSTEIN NEWS AND SAID I 
SPOKE WITH ROD TODAY AND WE 
WILL HAVE A MEETING ON THURSDAY 
TO, QUOTE, FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 
GOING ON. 
>>> HELLO. 
I'M TANYA RIVERO AND THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH SAID HE WILL NOT 
WITHDRAW HIS NOMINATION DESPITE 
NEW ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT. 
ON SUNDAY, THE NEW YORKER 
REPORTED IN OTHER ACCUSER, 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ. 
SHE CLAIMED KAVANAUGH PULLED 
DOWN HIS PANTS AND EXPOSED 
HIMSELF TO HER WHILE THEY WERE 
FRESHMEN AT YALE AND SHE CALLS 
FOR THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THE 
INCIDENT. 
THIS COMES AS THE FIRST ACCUSER,
PROFESSOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD, HAS AGREED TO TESTIFY 
ÃºBE 
ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT 
HAPPENED WHILE THE TWO WERE IN 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
KAVANAUGH DENIES BOTH 
ALLEGATIONS. 
AND A NEW STATEMENT RELEASED 
THIS AFTERNOON HE SAID HE WOULD,
QUOTE, NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO 
WITHDRAWING FROM THIS PROCESS. 
HE ALSO SAID THAT, QUOTE, 
COORDINATED EFFORTS TO DESTROY 
HIS GOOD NAME WILL NOT DRIVE HIM
OUT. 
HE FURTHER CONDEMNED THREATS OF 
VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS FAMILY, 
FINISHING, THE LAST MINUTE 
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WILL 
NOT SUCCEED. 
THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT 
SAID HE STANDS BY HIS NOMINEE. 
>> HE'S A FINE MAN. 
HE'S GOT AN UNBLEMISHED PAST 
AND HE'S SUFFERING THESE HIGHLY 
UNSUBSTANTIATED STATEMENTS 
REPRESENTED BY PEOPLE 
REPRESENTED BY LAWYERS THAT YOU 
SHOULD LOOK INTO, THOSE DOING 
THE REPRESENTATION. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS AN 
OUTSTANDING PERSON AND I AM 
WITH HIM ALL THE WAY. 
WE WILL SEE HOW IT GOES WITH 
THE SENATE AND WITH THE VOTE. 
>> CBS NEWS CHIEF 
CORRESPONDENT, NANCY CORDES, 
JOINS US FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
HOW ARE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS 
RESPONDING TO THESE NEW 
ALLEGATIONS LAID OUT IN THE NEW 
YORKER ARTICLE ABOUT KAVANAUGH? 
>> Reporter: THEY'VE BEEN QUITE 
QUIET, ACTUALLY. 
WE DID SEE A TWEET FROM LINDSEY 
GRAHAM WHO SAID THAT THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SHOULD GO 
AHEAD WITH THIS HEARING WITH 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD ON 
THURSDAY AND VOTE SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER. 
WE ARE NOT HEARING A TON FROM 
THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IT'S 
CLEAR THEY'VE STILL GOTTEN NEW 
INFORMATION ABOUT A SECOND 
ACCUSER AND THEY WANT TO MEET 
WITH ONE ANOTHER TO FIGURE OUT 
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL DO, 
GOING FORWARD. 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN QUITE VOCAL 
AND A NUMBER OF THEM ARE 
CALLING ON KAVANAUGH TO 
WITHDRAW HIS NOMINATION. 
THERE IS A NUMBER OF THEM 
INCLUDING DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
SAYING THEY HEARING WITH BLASEY 
FORD SHOULD BE CANCELED ALL 
TOGETHER, BECAUSE THEY THINK 
THE FACT THAT A SECOND ACCUSER 
HAS COME FORWARD, IT SHOWS WHY 
THE FBI NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE. 
OF COURSE, EVERYONE IS ON 
TENTERHOOKS WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
LAWYER MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS. 
HE SAID HE REPRESENTS A NEW 
CLIENT WHO ALSO HAS 
INFORMATION. 
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT 
THAT? 
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW THIS 
MYSTERY THIRD WOMAN. 
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING? 
>> Reporter: WE HAVE SOME 
INFORMATION AND I'VE BEEN ON THE
PHONE RECENTLY WITH AVENATTI, 
WHO IS IN COURT IN CALIFORNIA 
LATER TODAY IN THE STORMY 
DANIELS CASE. 
HE IS WORKING BOTH ENDS OF THE 
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. 
HE SAYS THIS IS A WOMAN WHO WAS 
A CONTEMPORARY OF KAVANAUGH'S. 
SHE WENT TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL 
NEAR GEORGETOWN PREP WHERE 
KAVANAUGH WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL, 
AND ALL BOYS SCHOOL AND WAS AT 
MULTIPLE PARTIES WITH HIM. 
AVENATTI HASN'T GONE INTO TOO 
MUCH DETAIL ABOUT WHAT 
TRANSPIRED, BUT HE HAS TREATED 
AND HAS WRITTEN LETTERS TO THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
ELUDING TO BAD BEHAVIOR BY 
KAVANAUGH, HIS FRIEND MARK 
JUDGE AND OTHER BOYS FROM 
GEORGETOWN PREP, TALKING ABOUT 
GETTING GIRLS DRUNK AND TALKING 
ABOUT, AND HAYDEN'S WORDS, DATE 
RAPE TRAINING. 
IT ALARMED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND 
THERE IS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM 
FROM THE REPUBLICANS. 
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO THE 
ALLEGED VICTIM AS AND WHEN SHE 
PLANS TO COME FORWARD. 
AVENATTI TOLD ME THEY ARE 
MAKING SURE SHE IS SAFE BEFORE 
SHE GOES PUBLIC BUT THAT SHOULD 
HAPPEN FAIRLY SOON.
