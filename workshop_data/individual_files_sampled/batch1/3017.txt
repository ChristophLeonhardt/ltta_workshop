welcome back to you ask we answer I'm Nicholas Carlson let's get right to the questions first we're going to go with Logan item who asks where do you think my space will be as a company and as a product 365 days from today so let's talk about where they think they'll be and where they're actually be anything they're going to be this entertainment portal place where you go for TV shows music maybe some video games like the way you play video games on facebook now that's that's their goal that's their hope that's why they've hired people from slingbox and they've brought in a lot of great product executives where their action will be maybe approaching zero that company is losing a lot of momentum and is one of the bigger busts in terms of purchases on the internet in recent memory this is from current AOL and he asked or she asked is it true that your sources in quotes are actually you are actually slumming around the AOL headquarters trying to get people to speak to you and the answer is I don't know if slumming is the appropriate term but yes we do have people going out into the field reporting on stories and trying to get word from actual people what's actually going on it's a shocking new tool that we're trying to innovate on reporting all right this is from Maria Marie who asked does Henry treat you well is this a better gig for you than Gawker was so I'm loving it here but let me let me sort of phrase this question different way because I think one interesting thing has happened at Gawker Media recently is that Nick Denton who owns who owns the company has recently decided to start paying the writers as full-time employees they're no longer permal answers or permanent freelance contractors they used to be paper story then they got contracts and now he's talking about transitioning them into full-time employees this is a big step for Gawker and they also just recently transitioned from a limited liability corporation into a partnership into a into a corporation so something's going on there no I don't think they're going to go public but for some reason maybe it's just something as simple as tax purposes maybe the next looking on take on new investors but there is something going on with a company it's becoming a little bit dare i say more legitimate so now we're going to on to Jimmy crack corn who asks where is the best place to ski during the holiday break so the best place to ski is probably a Swiss Alps or you know out in Colorado but I live in New York I get to go to places like Vermont and upstate New York so PLATUS kill enough skate New York has very very like reasonable like lift tickets like $25 and my wife and i love that we have a friend who's in stone or Stratton or whatever and when we can stay there for free it's a lot of fun so those are the good places from the New York and so G the final questions ask us what is up with the stylish glasses you like these glasses try these on for size anyway I'm Nicholas Carlson so thanks so much and we'll catch you next time
