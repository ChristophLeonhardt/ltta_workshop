NEIL: YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN
LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE
PRIMARIES SO FAR THIS YEAR
HEADING INTO MIDTERMS AND ONE
THING WE CAN CONCLUDE IF YOU'RE
A REPUBLICAN AND YOU WANT TO
WINS THE GOOD TO BE EITHER LIKE
DONALD TRUMP OR CERTAINLY TO BE
LIKED BY DONALD TRUMP IN THE
CASE OF MAINE AND THE
BUSINESSMAN SEAN WHO WAS
SELECTED AS CANDIDATE TO REPLACE
MY NEXT GUEST, BOTH A
BUSINESSMAN SO LIKE DONALD TRUMP
AND LIKED BY DONALD TRUMP,
MATTERS A GREAT DEAL THAT HE'S
LIKED BY THE INCUMBENT VERY
POPULAR OUTGOING GOVERNOR PAULA
PAGE WHO JOINS US RIGHT NOW OUT
OF MAINE.
GOVERNOR, VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
>> PLEASURE TO BE BACK, NEIL.
NEIL: ARE YOU OKAY, WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SHOULDER
BRACE, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?
>> I JUST HAD A SHOULDER
REPLACEMENT TWO WEEKS AGO.
GUARANTIED TO GET RID OF MY
SLICE.
NEIL: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN ANOTHER
FIGHT WITH POLITICIANS.
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT THAT.
>> IT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
NEIL: IT'S INTERESTING THAT ALL
THE CANDIDATES WHO WERE RUNNING,
ALL THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
SHARED DEAL FOR CUTTING TAXES,
SHRINKING GOVERNMENT, DOING
SOMETHING ABOUT REFORMING
WELFARE, SO THEY WERE ALL
CLEARLY PREACHING FROM YOUR
CHOIR BOOK, IS THAT A NATIONAL
APPEALING TREND, WHAT WORKS IN
MAINE SO FAR, SO FAR NOMINEES
IT'S GOING TO WORK NATIONALLY?
>> I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE SO.
I THINK THE PEOPLE -- WHAT THE
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS
SOMEONE THAT IS NOT A CAREER
POLITICIAN BUT SOMEONE THAT'S
GOING TO COME IN AND DO THE JOB
AND LEAVE AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE
COME IN AND   DO IT.
IN OUR CASE SEAN MOODY IS A
BASEMAN.
HE'S A MAINER, SELF-MADE, AND
HE'S WELL LIKED AND WELL
RESPECTED AND WHAT HE SAYS IS
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO AND THAT'S
WHAT CAPTURED THE EYE AND THE
HEARTS TO HAVE MAINORS.
NEIL: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA YET.
STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS.
MY WIFE AND I ARE GOING TO TAKE
THE WINTER OFF AND THEN WE WILL
DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO DO.
NEIL: NOW, YOUR CLOSE TO THE
PRESIDENT, HE THINKS A GREAT
DEAL OF YOU, HAVE YOU
ENTERTAINED, HAS HE TALKED ABOUT
A ROLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION?
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME
OPTIONS, HE'S MADE SOME
OVERTURES OF THAT I MAY BE ASKED
TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND WE ARE
LOOKING, BUT NOTHING CONCRETE AT
THIS POINT.
NEIL: DO THINGS IN HIS CABINET?
>> OH, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
THE CABINET.
I JUST REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE
IN WASHINGTON.
NEIL: I SEE.
>> ALL OF THE TIME.
BUT WE WILL SEE.
NEIL: BACK TO NATIONAL ISSUES
HERE, THE PARTY SEEMS TO BE
FEELING IT'S GETTING ITS
TRACTION BACK AND THAT IT WILL
AVOID A SWEEP IN NOVEMBER OR AT
LEAST SURRENDERING THE HOUSE TO
DEMOCRATS.
THEY BASE ON IMPROVING ECONOMY,
MOMENTUM MAYBE POSTNORTH KOREA,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I THINK THE SAME THING.
WE ARE FEELING IT IN MAINE AS
YOU SAW IN THE PRIMARIES, WE
DON'T KNOW WHO THE DEMOCRATIC
CANDIDATE WILL BE FOR GOVERNOR
BUT REPUBLICAN --
NEIL: THEY HAVE TO HAVE A RUNOFF
NOW?
>> THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE --
WHAT WE HAVE IS --
NEIL: THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT.
WHO CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA?
BOTH SIDES WERE CRITICIZING IT.
WHO CAME UP WITH THAT?
>> ACTUALLY IT'S A GROUP OUT OF
MASSACHUSETTS AND THE MONEY IS
ALL OUT OF STATE AND IT'S FUNNY,
BUT MAINE IS CHEAP STATE AND
THEY COME TO MAINE.
NEIL: WE WILL WATCH THAT ONE
CLOSELY.
THE IDEA IS TO AVOID CONFUSION
THEY SEEM TO ADD TO IT.
