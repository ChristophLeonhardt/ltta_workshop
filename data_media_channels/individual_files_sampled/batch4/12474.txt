decided that he was going to hold another one of these open meetings with Democrats and Republicans in front of the cameras now usually in front of the cameras the president tries to please members of both parties the president above all is a performer crazy guy who's on reality TV he's been on the cover of every magazine he's been performing he's been performing every single you know all the time for years and that performance does not stop just because he's the President of the United States when a camera is on when the red light is on he's performing and what that usually means that he's trying to cater to the people in the room so when he's performing at CPAC and the red lights are on there he's saying what CPAC wants to hear and when he's in front of the NRA then he is saying what the NRA wants to hear and when he is in front of a bunch of Democrats and Republicans he's saying well he thinks a lot of the Democrats would want to hear and that's basically how went yesterday now we're gonna analyze the Sun two levels one is did he mean any of this is it real and two is what did he just say because we sort of always have to separate out these two things what he said and is it important these are two separate questions because the president says a lot of stuff a lot of crap comes out of that face so the question is was the stuff that he said good or was it bad and - was it important well that's for the second question first I don't think the stuff that he said was important he's gonna have to get the legislation through Congress Republicans run Congress they're not gonna do any of the things that he wants them to do here because they don't have the votes for it the reason I say this is because the president did exactly the same thing with daca you recall that he had a meeting with a bunch of Democrats and at that meeting on daca he specifically said that he would be fine with passing a clean daca bill we mocked him up and down for it it was ridiculous he said that he was fine with a clean amnesty bill and no border security measures and Kevin McCarthy the House Majority Leader had jump in and say mr. president you mean they want border security and Trump's against her I mean I mean I want a clean bill with border security which is not originally what he said now of course all of his overtures to Democrats in that meeting meant nothing the same thing is probably happening here on guns but it is important to note the president only became an advocate of gun rights relatively recently up till 2012 the president was a gun control advocate the president was not a big fan of guns and so when it goes back to the root the gut level for President Trump when he goes back to his gut on this issue there are certain issues where the president's gut is very much in line with with sort of conservative policy guns are not one of those issues on guns this is a guy whose gut is from New York and New Yorkers people from New York City they're not particularly big into the second Amendment rights of all of it so the president has this meeting yesterday and he says a bunch of things that are just laughably awful so he starts off by in a conversation with Pat Toomey so Pat Toomey is the is the senator from Pennsylvania now in order for you to understand how absurd it is what President Trump says right here you have to understand that Pat Toomey is one of the left most members of the US Senate on guns so in 2013 it was it was Pat Toomey who proposed a piece of legislation in the aftermath of Sandy Hook with Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia Democrat and that piece of legislation would have forced federal background checks for any sale of any weapon in the United States except between family members or close friends so if I wanted to sell a gun to somebody in the office with whom I was not friendly then I would have to go to a federally licensed firearms dealer now the only way to enforce that the problem this policy is the only way to enforce that law is that you actually have to have a full gun registry because in order for the government's keep track of how I sold my gun to somebody they have to know that I own the gun in the first place right a federally licensed firearms dealer keeps records with the federal government they know how many guns are in that gun shop and so when that love firearms dealer is requested for records by the NRA rather thee by the ATF then the ATF knows that where the guns were how they were transported all the rest of it that would have set up a gun registry in the United States gun registries are really troubling concept you really don't want the government knowing who has a gun and where because it's none of the government's business there are two purposes to the Second Amendment one is self-defense in which case you don't really care about the government knowing you have a gun and the second is being free of government tyranny and in that case you really don't want the government to know who has how many guns and where and obviously there's a certain amount of of knowledge the government has with regard to federally licensed firearms dealers but having a full gun registry is not quite the same thing as all that the government would have to come into your house and check every so often the government would have to figure out whether you were telling the truth the government could theoretically charge you with perjury for lying on federal forms if you if you did not fill out the forms properly and these hand hand transfers in any case the manchin-toomey bill went down to defeat it got 54 votes in the Senate it could not hit 60 but to me who had proposed it was bucking the NRA when he proposed that so to me actually his NRA rating was demoted from an A to a C and it was demoted from an agency not only was it demoted from an A to a C in 2014 the NRA declined to endorse to me so they'd endorsed to me in his last senatorial race and then they unendorsed to me in 2008 so that's how seriously they honor I took all of this and that's how much at odds to me was with the NRA well Trump because he always wants to be the guy saying the brashest thing in the room he starts ripping into to me for some reason and suggesting the to me is a tool of the our a which is just idiotic it doesn't make sense said I have to wait till I'm 21 to get a handgun but I can get this weapon at 18 I don't know so I just curious as to what you did in your bill look at all the staffers even Manchin is going he's not afraid of the NRA he and I partnered on the legislation what the hell are you talking about the Trump is accusing to me being afraid of the NRA which is just great press for the NRA considering the entire Democratic Party and the media have been claiming that the real reason Republicans are pro-gun is because they're afraid of the NRA so well done mr. president for doubling down on that idiotic message then the president went even further and that's the clip we're about to show you where where Dianne Feinstein jumps for joy Amy Klobuchar who's the senator from Minnesota she suggests that they add an assault weapons ban to manchin-toomey so not only would there be a full gun registry now you would not be able to buy an assault weapon meaning any rifle in the United States that has a couple of features added to it like a pistol grip and and a certain type of barrel for example if he or a sight if he added those things if the government looks scary it's an assault weapon Republicans have opposed this forever Amy Klobuchar says why don't we do it and Trump immediately says yeah let's wrap that up into an even bigger gun control package and watch Dianne Feinstein's reaction Dianne Feinstein is 84 years old but suddenly she's a little girl again Dianne Feinstein she's been my senator virtually my entire life she's been senator here since I was 10 years old Dianne Feinstein her 9 years old I have never seen Dianne Feinstein smile ever not once on tape like it needs it there's there's this myth that once Dianne Feinstein smiled and a rainbow came out like she's not a big laugher and a big smile er hey watch as she turns into a small child clapping for Glee like my kids when I give them chocolate when Trump says this about assault weapons it's really amazing just doing something on this background check issue and using that as a base and then I would like to add some of these other things we've talked about I think would make a major difference you can add that to this bill that would be great you have also and I think you can into the bill so were you ready can you do them Joe can you do them better make some of the things you're not you don't really have you help well no I'll help but can you add what Amy and what Dianne have K we had the minute and I know you can add what you okay and look at the Republicans are like what is going on now like Cornyn who's sitting right next to trump he's putting his hand to his mouth like this can't be happening this isn't real like Trump really doesn't know it he's saying here and Dianne Feinstein knows exactly our Trump saying again she's 84 years old and suddenly she's my four-year-old daughter she's so gleeful if you are saying things about guns that are making Dianne Feinstein gleeful let me suggest that you've undermined the Second Amendment and that you are not standing with conservative ideas on the Second Amendment okay then it gets you more so he turned us to corn and who's sitting right next to him he says you know we should do we should actually do a comprehensive gun reform like a big big bill like a big historic bill and you can see Cornyn going what the hell is going on like was he dropped on his head this morning did he did he wake up on the wrong side of the bed was invasion of the body snatchers like what in the world look at look at John Cornyn space here and John fix Nick's has some really good things in it but it would be nice if we could add everything on to it and maybe you changed the title alright the US background check bill or whatever but your bill is really good and really important having to do with a certain aspect but maybe we could make it much more comprehensive and have one bill instead of 15 different bills that nobody knows what's happening if we can get 60 votes for mr. Pradhan steps in he goes according to steps and he goes mr. president your acting coach I old we need 60 votes and we're not gonna get it so the president of course just completely overlooks this it was just ridiculous ridiculous on every possible level and and it gets even more ridiculous okay so this is the thing that is most ridiculous and had people really up in arms as they should be so the president is talking about a vice president pence starts talking about a proposal those first made by David French a proposal that I back forgotten violence restraining orders gun violence restraining orders our process that we have here in California where close family and friends can apply to a court to have your gun rights temporarily suspended if they show past a certain burden of proof that there is evidence that you are danger to yourself or and then there is a hearing right so there's due process so the due process can go in a couple ways you can have the hearing before the guns are removed or you could have a preliminary hearing in which all of the evidence is shown and then the guns are temporarily removed because we don't want people sitting around there with guns and then the guns are and then the guy realizes that the cops are going to come take away his guns go shoots up to school okay so the you can have due process in the sense that you have the right to confront the accuser but it's done on really spontaneous quick basis or you could have like a full drawn-out hearing but both of those are due process so Mike Pence explains the proposal and Trump proceeds to piledrive the proposal Trump proceeds to take Pence's proposal the gun violence restraining order proposal the David French proposal and he proceeds to say something so wildly unconstitutional and so wildly unconservative that it boggles the mind I mean if Barack Obama had uttered these words we would all be up in arms the reason that it's different if Obama had sent them and then Trump sang them honestly is that Obama knew what he was talking about on these issues and Trump clearly doesn't anyway here is here's Mike Pence saying something smart and then Donald Trump following up with something so egregiously stupid that minds of small children were blown all over the country because a lot of times by the time you go to court it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures I like taking the guns early like in this crazy man's case it just took place in Florida he had a lot of fires they saw everything to go the court would have taken a long time so you could do exactly what you're saying but take the guns first go through due process second okay that's not what due process is the reason this is a problem is not because anybody wants mentally ill violent people to have guns nobody wants that but it is astonishing to me that the same people on the Left who are afraid of Trump becoming an authority Rhian are sitting there laughing with glee when the President of the United States says somebody applies to have somebody else's gun rights taken away and we should all just shrug I mean honestly that's what the President of the United States says right there the presidents in the United States just said that you should be able to go into the police should be able to go into your house I should be able to go to the cops and say to them my next-door neighbor is crazy and that's your idea of it it's right there's no due process I just call up and I say tip next-door neighbor is crazy in the gun and the cops go and take that guy's guns and maybe arrest him right and then later comes the due process we fought an entire revolution to prohibit this sort of thing we fought in revolutions that there will be a right to habeas corpus so you know why you're being arrested and your rights are being violated we we fought an entire revolution so their ex post facto laws laws that were specifically designed after the fact in order to get certain people none of this is part of the constitutional order but the president who's a Republican was sitting there saying this stuff with a straight face now this brings us to our to our I'll get to the last question as to whether any of this is important in a second he didn't even stop there is I mean everybody on the right is just looking at this going what happened I mean what it was every WTF gift that you can find online was it with my I mean every face that you can make right the was just was being made by Republicans yesterday watching this thing unfold in real time it's astonishing it's astonishing okay then he goes he says he goes after Steve Scalise Steve Scalise shooting victim in the Congressional baseball shooting Ben Scalise has proposed in the NRA is proposed in Trump has endorsed in his 2016 election cycle the idea of carrot concealed carry reciprocity concealed carry reciprocity is the idea that when you apply for a concealed carry license in Oklahoma and you are approved by the government for that concealed carry license you should be able to concealed carry and other any other state normally this sort of thing is fine like we have a marriage license in one state it's usually transferable over to another state if you have if you have a liquor license in one state and it fulfills the obligations of the other state then it should be able to be fulfilled in that state I believe but when it comes to concealed carry there's questions as to whether you should be able to take your concealed carry license from Oklahoma and bring it over to California and and so Trump is told by Steve Scalise that they want this concealed carry reciprocity and president Trump's response is as always amazing here's the President of the United States responding to Steve Scalise by saying it's utterly it's it we can never do this it can't be a thing and there were a lot of our members that said look we want to close these these problems and fix these problems with the background check system and we came together and actually passed a bill but we also felt that if you look at the concealed carry population these are people by and large who are helping us stop crimes these are people who are well trained who actually go out there and help prevent crimes some would hope that that's not immediately dismiss because there is a lot of talk of just putting that on the side and just like you think this you know I'm your biggest fan of them alright I think that maybe that bill will someday pass but it should pass as a separate if you're gonna put concealed carry between states into this bill we're talking about a whole new ballgame look at clobber char look at her okay the senator from Minnesota look at the Democrat she's sitting there nodding along and the Republicans are all sitting there at their arms crossed look at the body language here all the Republicans are going where is this coming from this is the guy who days ago was talking about how great the NRA was this is a guy who was a few days ago talking about the value of gun rights this is a guy who a couple of days ago was talking about how we needed to protect our right to keep him bear arms and it does shed some light on something the president said during his CPAC speech during that CPAC speech he had this very weird line where he said if you could choose between tax cuts and gun rights which would you choose and he was expecting everybody in the room to say tax cuts and everybody in the rooms had gun rights and he was kind of shocked by it he's again the president is not a stalwart on gun rights and on a gut level he's not now one of the nice things is that the President of the United States can be turned to whoever talks to him last this is one of the nice things about the president he's willing to hear opposing points of view is the nice way of putting it also the President of the United States can't do all these things because he just doesn't have the votes but here is where it does become important so this stuff is not important right now because when Trump says stuff right now who cares Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell they're the ones who are putting the legislation together when he said dumb stuff about Obama care it didn't really matter very much when he said dumb things about the tax bill it didn't matter very much when he said dumb things about immigration it didn't matter very much the president saying dumb things is baked into the cake we all know that the president is gonna say stuff and we're all gonna go war and we've all gotten used to that but what happens if in November Democrats take back the House of Representatives and let's say they get really lucky and they take back the Senate let's say the Democrats suddenly have controlled the Senate and the House of Representatives then all of a sudden the President of the United States saying these things may actually make a difference because you could see a situation in which Democrats are the ones writing the bill right now the check on the president saying dumb things is a Congress that's not going to write dumb things but what happens when the Congress can write some things what happens when Nancy Pelosi is Speaker of the House and she's sitting in a meeting like this with the President of the United States and he says I want you to put XY and Z into a bill once a comprehend gun reform bill that's going to require full background checks for every sale in the United States which would require registry and everything that the president has about assault weapons who'd be wrapped into a bill and no concealed carry reciprocity and raising the age to buy rifle and the president says all this in front of Nancy Pelosi and she says sure mr. president well with you and what happens when Chuck Schumer is the Senate Majority Leader and he says to Trump sounds great mr. president I'll tell you what happens the president gets all of the bad things we don't want him to be saying and having right now that's what happens how do I know that's what happens because that's exactly what happened on the budget last year you recall that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan were using the debt ceiling debate as a way to cut some spending and the President of the United States had in Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and he said to them directly listen guys I don't care about cutting anything let's just blow out the spending and they said fine and they walked out and Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell were just stunned because the President did have the capacity to do that he had the votes to do that well right now it doesn't matter again because the Republicans are running the show but when the Republicans are not running the show things are going to get pretty dicey pretty quickly which is why it's important that Republicans maintain control of the house as a check on president Trump because the president's instincts are not always good on these sorts of things and he's not surrounded by a bunch of Second Amendment advocates can the people who are closest to the president aside from Mike Pence these are not all SuperPro Second Amendment people it's it's a serious issue and nobody is checking him on the areas where he does have control so another area where he has control and where he's saying dumb things is the area of trade so today the president tweeted this out this is 17 the president tweeted this out about trade they tweeted quote our steel and aluminum industries and many others have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world we must not let our country companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer we want free fair and smart trade so Charlie cook over at National Review had a great point about this last sentence Norton says we want free fair and smart trade and he says if you use the words free fair and smart about for example speech if you said we want free fair and smart speech you'd realize that this is a violation of free speech principles right fair speech and smart speech are not requisites you just need free speech when it comes to trade the same thing is true the notion of fair trade is a is is something chimerical it's the reason I say it's silly is because comparative advantages since since the days of Ricardo has suggested that you are an idiot if you heighten tariffs on your own just because the other guy has heightened tariffs on you as I'm constantly saying just be let's say that you are in the business of building shelves at the local grocery store and they stop using you right they've they've essentially set up a tariff on you they don't use you anymore do you stop shopping at that grocery store if they have the lowest prices only if you want to get poor or do you do that okay so but the president doesn't understand how trade works the president thinks that trade is not reciprocal the president thinks that all of these industries have been quote unquote estimated so today the president had a meeting with all of these steel and aluminum industry leaders and he said that he was going to raise tariffs dramatically on steel and aluminum he apparently said that he wants to raise the steel tariffs by 25% he wants to slap a stain over all steel tariffs of 25% on foreign steel and a 10% aluminium tariffs on aluminum disaster area full-scale disaster area the reason this is a full-scale disaster area is because these are inputs for other industries in the United States for every job in the steel industry there are 40 jobs and other industries that use steel which means that if you're in the car industry and you use steel and suddenly the price of steel goes up because of these tariffs and they have to sell your car more expensively and it is less competitive in the global market unless you tear off cars and then if you tear off cars then you're going to have to increase the price on cars and people to spend money their tariffs are a terrible economic policy they've always been a terrible economic policy for every job that is saved by steel by by these by these tariffs other jobs are lost when the bush tariffs on steel went into effect from 2001 to 2004 is about 21 months and when those tariffs were in effect the United States lost approximately 200,000 jobs by studies and not only that the economy suffered overall because of that according to estimates every single steel job created by a tariff American consumers paid an additional 200,000 to 2.3 million dollars that's how much it cost to preserve a steel job and that's what's happening here remember there are industries in the United States like the beer industry uses aluminum to make its cans anheuser-busch came out today they said this is idiotic you just raised the price of beer on everybody who wants to buy an Heiser Busch beer you gonna buy a miller lite well now you're going to be paying a higher price for that watered-down beer and this is not good policy it's also it's just ignorant I mean when he says that the steel and aluminum industries in the United States are gonna have been decimated by decades of unfair trade it's not true it's just not factually true in 2016 the steel industry actually did really well thanks for dramatically increased car sales Nucor is the nation's leading steel manufacturer it's 16 billion dollars in sales that year last year it's netting her earnings increased 65 percent over 2016 the average salaried that company by the way is $80,000 most job loss at new core has happened thanks to technological advances not thanks to foreign trade right now 70% of all steel sold in the United States is American steel as for the argument that we need steel tariffs in order to protect the capacity of our military to have steel to use for its weaponry that's like three percent of all the steel production in the United States would have to be used for a full-scale military mobilization in the United States it's just not true either methylates not just nuke or which their stock price in 2000 was 12 bucks today at $65 so obvious they're not doing that badly US Steel boomed in 2017 in q4 of 2016 net earnings were forty-seven million dollars but by q4 of 2017 net earnings were 136 million dollars they had a massive boom last year steel dynamics showed an operating income of 1.1 billion dollars last year as for America's production of raw steel we're producing about the same amount of raw steel that we were producing in 1980 has been pretty consistent for the last three and a half decades almost four decades cato institute trailer Scott Lincecum points out again the u.s. steel production rose 5% last year there are already a hundred and sixty duties on steel imports and if you think this is just a way to screw China because China is dumping its cheap steel on us nonsense China ranks 11th in steel importation into the United States ok how about and again the most important thing here is the number of jobs this is gonna cost in another industry the CFO of anheuser-busch said this quote about 2 million jobs depend on America's beer industry we urged the Department of Commerce and US President Trump to consider the impact of trade restriction tariffs okay but he's not gonna reconsider it because this is something that he has power over and right now he's feeling particularly threatened the president the United States right now President Trump is feeling very isolated and that means that he is bringing in his toys and he's bringing his comfort food and his teddy bears and his teddy bears on issues like this is a guy named Peter Navarro who wrote a book on trade that makes no sense and is in a supremely foolish and he is Trump's guru on trade because Trump has always felt that America is getting screwed because Trump's vision of what American industry is is guys who are working a blue-collar job in downtown Manhattan building a building with steel he's got a very 1955 version of what American industry looks like that's not what American industry looks like right now the job loss in the steel industry has been brought about by technological change and of course the vast majority of jobs in this country are no longer in manufacturing they're in the service industry and when the president says that I'm supposed to pay more for a car to preserve that steel job what he's really doing is penalizing me for being in an industry that's more efficient than the steel industry has been on a global level we by the way are still the number two producers of all steel on planet earth but again this is bad economics from the president the president is just saying things except this time he's actually gonna do it so next week he's supposed to impose these tariffs and the market is reacting just exactly how you would think they were is reacting right there's gonna be a big trade war because not only is it going to have a not only is it going to have a significant impact on the steel industry and and industries that are fed by steel in the United States it's gonna have impact on other industries because other countries are going to raise their tariffs on us in retaliation they shouldn't but they will in an attempt to back us down hey they're going to now raise their own tariffs so today as of this point the stock market has been dropping pretty precipitously it has tumbled 600 points over the tariff talks so it finally stabilized after a really bad month February was crappy month for the stock market today the gg the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 490 points to this point it's taking a big dip let's have for took a bunch of huge dips last month so well done President Trump with just by you announcing these tariffs you sunk the stock market 500 points it won't end there by the way there's still a lot of doubt as to whether this actually gets imposed cuz again Trump says so many things but it is not true that yeah the the President of the United States saying these things does have an impact if he ends up imposing them so this is why I say I'm gun I think people cut it and are cutting him a lot of slack so they don't think it's actually gonna happen but when it comes to trade policy the President does have the unilateral authority to raise tariffs this way and this could be a full-scale disaster for the economy it could be a real disaster for a number of industries especially if he decides that he is gonna go to trade war with every country that slaps tariffs on us because you could see this escalating you can see Trump saying we're gonna put the steel tariffs the aluminum tariffs and then you could see France saying to us well they're gonna do that to us we're gonna put tariffs on not just steel and aluminum we're gonna put tariffs on all your other goods too and then Trump says well screw you I'll put tariffs on arthas we're stronger than you the zero-sum version of economics is is just ignorant it doesn't make any sense at all and it's very frustrating to watch a Republican president do it because it's very dumb now again one of the reasons I think this is happening is because the president obviously feels isolated the president feels like a lot of his a lot of his favorite people have been marginalized in the last couple of weeks so over the last week the Josh FL who is the comms director for Jared Kushner has been marginalized Kushner himself has been marginalized a little bit as I said by the by the revocation of his interim top-secret security status there's a story today in the New York Times that's very damaging to Kushner about his family business receiving loans after he held meetings with business people it's according to the New York Times early last year a private equity billionaire started paying regular visits to the White House Joshua Harris a founder of Apollo Global Management was advising trump administration officials on infrastructure policy during that period he met on multiple occasions with Jared Kushner president Trump's son-in-law and senior advisors among other things the two men discussed a possible White House job for Harris the job never materialized but in November Apollo went 184 million dollars to cushion his family real estate firm Kushner companies the loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper this is one of their bigger deals it's triple the average size of their property loan it's one of the largest ones Kushner company received last year and even larger loan came from Citigroup which lent the firm and one of his partners 325 million dollars to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn that loan was made in spring of 2017 right after Kushner met in the White House with Citi group's chief executive Michael Corbitt according to people briefed on the meeting the two men talked about financial and trade policy and did not discuss Kushner's family business is one of the problems with having people in Whitehouse who are deeply connected to their businesses still and it's one of the reasons why seasons from security clearance has not been granted at this point is because of these business connections and this is not good hey this is not good if this were happening under Hillary would not be good it's happening under Trump and it's not good it doesn't matter whether you like the people who are talking about personally it doesn't matter if you like the policies that are espousing the media obviously have an agenda which is to knock Kushner off the hill right now they want to see cast inside the Trump administration but as they're holding this but that's not something that Kushner should have been doing if Trump wanted him to have meetings with Citigroup and financial leaders then Kushner should have basically become disassociated into in entirety from all the cushion or companies that apparently has not happened so Kushner has been marginalized and now hope Hicks is gone so hope Hicks was his comfort blanket hope Hicks who started off as a runway model who joined Trump in 2016 she was part of Ivanka's team she was his top aide and she's now 29 and one of the best liked people in the White House everybody I know in the White House who knows the hope egg says that she's a wonderful person well she was according to CNN excoriated by the president because a couple of days ago she went in front of Congress and she was asked whether she'd ever had to lie on behalf of the president she said well she told some white lies like about audience eyes like crowd sighs and that apparently ticked off Trump according to CNN and supposedly Trump yelled at her and then hope Hicks quit that's the CNN story now the New York Times says that she's been preparing for weeks to leave that's not a giant shock people in the White House are routinely talking about leaving because a very chaotic place very high-stress job there's a lot of turnover at any White House but particularly in a White House that's run from the top this way so hope it's leaving I have some impact on the administration I'll explain what impact it has and what

being pushed to the side apparently according to reports by General John Kelly the chief of staff which means that Kelly is the guy who's sort of bringing people into the center of the room and that means that Trump is more likely to reach out to other people that he wants to talk to if he feels like Kelly is shutting him off from Jared Kushner and that hope Hicks is gonna leave then he's gonna start reaching out to other people he's comfortable with when one of the people he likes a lot apparently is Peter Navarro Peter Navarro this trade guy and it's not a coincidence that while all this cast is taking place Peter Navarro is suddenly making appearances in the Oval Office and Trump is hanging out with him people that Trump feels personally comfortable with are the people he's gonna want to talk to and unfortunately a lot of those people have pretty bad ideas because personal comfort should not be the gauge of whether somebody's policy is good but the president doesn't know a lot about policy and he's very susceptible to being told things by people that he likes so Hicks being out has more of a personal impact on Trump than it does a policy impact but she is known as sort of the person she sort of the Trump whisper she's the person who can who can handle Trump and has been able to to hem him in a little bit make him feel better about his presidency make him feel better about things her being gone is not going to be a good thing again Josh raffle I think Spencer thaw is a press aide whose initial portfolio is primarily focused on Kushner and Ivanka and he apparently is leaving also and apparently Adina Powell is left left a few weeks ago so high turnover at the White House that means a lot of pee a lot of faces Trump doesn't recognize as he gets more uncomfortable he's gonna look for friends and friends around him are going to define what he does which is sort of an uncomfortable place he's meanwhile busily attacking his own Attorney General so yesterday the president went on Twitter and he attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions generally this this I've always found really frustrating Attorney General sessions I've met him a few times when he was Senator sessions I think that senator sessions is a is a rock solid red state Republican I disagree with him on trade I disagree with him in certain areas of immigration but he was the very first guy to endorse Trump I mean the first major voice to endorse Trump very very early in the campaign a real Trump loyalist and as a G Trump has just beaten the crap out of him publicly so this is really in bad taste the one thing that one of the things I like about about sessions and that sessions does have a strong sense of what he's supposed to do as the Attorney General that his job is not to just be the wingman for the president now Trump doesn't like that because he looks at the Obama administration and he says Eric Holder was Obama's wingman why can't you be my wingman and the answer is because the AG is not supposed to be the president's wingman the AG is supposed to administer the law Jeff Sessions actually takes that rather seriously so one of the areas where this has happened is that Jeff Sessions asked the inspector general to investigate potential FISA abuse there's been a lot of talk about FISA abusive they're supposed abuse by the FBI and the DOJ a DOJ of the FISA warrant process in the attempt to get a warrant on Carter page that former Trump campaign aide that form a trump foreign policy aide and sessions have listen I don't want the GAO J investigating itself I don't want the DOJ investigating the FBI let's set somebody else he's independent because here's the thing if I Attorney General Jeff Sessions come down with the conclusion that the Obama DOJ and the Obama FBI went ahead and invaded the campaign people are gonna note a couple of things one I was a member of the campaign too I was appointed by President Trump and so they're not gonna take it seriously so we'll set up an IG I have a conflict of interest Trump doesn't appreciate that and he wants Jeff Sessions to just do what he wants me to do which i think is wrong mr. Trump tweets out why is the AG Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive thighs abuse will take forever has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc isn't the IG and Obama guy why not use Justice Department lawyers all caps disgraceful you know what's disgraceful is the President of the United States berating his own Attorney General publicly I assume he has Jeff Sessions phone number what does he think is gonna happen here is he thinks sessions is gonna quit if you just humiliates him enough I mean the sessions knows Trump isn't gonna fire him because Trump's been threatening to fire him for over a year he's not going anywhere so he'll just sit it out he'll sit tight he'll feel protect the law good four sessions for doing that so there's no purpose here other than Trump venting and then mobilizing his allies to vented sessions but maybe that makes his base feel good maybe it makes them feel like it's the it's the Geo J's fault that we haven't seen any prosecutions but again this is this is just not being not only not presidential it's not effective attacking your own Attorney General's just bad policy so in a rarity sessions actually fired back so you actually issued a statement ripping Trump good for him he said we have initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary as long as I'm the Attorney General I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and the Constitution I'm good for Jeff Sessions that's his job that's exactly what he should be doing so it's it's an absurdity that the president is attacking his own Attorney General so very bad 48 hours for the president's attacking his own Attorney General dumping all over gun rights and then talking about raising tariffs dramatically that would have a serious impact on the economic growth that he's attempting to reach so very bad 48 hours for the president and again I think this is what the president looks like when he's done more which is why you have to have checks in the White House it's why you have to have good people surrounding him it's why you need a Republican Congress if you had a Democratic Congress and a bunch of advisers around the president telling him to do the popular thing with Democrats this presidency could go sideways very quickly so while there was talk last week about the president being an ideological leader of the conservative movement that is not true the president has governed like a conservative so far but he's not an ideological leader he's a vehicle for the conservative movement that means that if the conservative movement doesn't call him out if the conservative movement doesn't provide a check when he when he commits anti conservative heresies then there is a possibility that Trump moves significantly to the left and again if the Democrats were smart they would know this if the Democrats had any brains at all they would spend all day just praising Trump it's what they would do it's been every day all day talking about how Trump is generous Trump is kind Trump is wonderful maybe they'd be like all of the characters in Manchurian Candidate talking about Raymond Burr and what a wonderful generous human being he is and Trump would buy that because the man doesn't anything this is the danger of having someone in the Oval Office who doesn't have an ideology so far it hasn't hurt those checks and balances have worked I only hope they continue to work I'll praise them I'll praise the president when they do work and when he does the right thing the last 48 hours has not been that time to do the right thing now speaking of the radicalism of the Democrats when you look at the Democrats themselves they have radicalized so if they were smart as I say they'd be triangulating with Trump there would be attempting to make overtures to Trump they could probably get half that argenta done with Trump if they did that but they're radicalizing pretty quickly so there are a bunch of top Democrats who attended a Louis Farrakhan speech Jake Tapper over at CNN who I criticized pretty heavily last week for what I thought was an agreed the awful Town Hall and then I praise this week for doing an interview with the sheriff Scott Israel in parkland Florida he he did a tweet storm yesterday that I think is quite good where he attacked Democrats attacking who attended lose Farrakhan speech he was an amazing thing that the mainstream media think had utterly not worthy of note that Louis Farrakhan an open anti-semite and open racist then in generalize piece of crap that this guy is treated as a celebrity by so many top-level Democrats including Democrats in the Congressional Black Caucus here are some clips of Louis Farrakhan talking and there were Democrats at the speech top-level Democrats at the speech I don't what they put on me the government is my enemy the powerful Jews top-level Democrats have praised Louis Farrakhan they taking pictures of Louis Farrakhan Barack Obama took pictures of the Louis Farrakhan there were two co-sponsors of the women's March who are present at this speech at this one right here okay and Democrats apparently had nothing to say about that they will be at the women's March again the radicalism of the Democrats there's a lot of talk about the alt-right in the last election cycle I think it was fully merited I was one of the people doing the talking the Democrats are equally radical when it comes to Lewis Farrakhan they've a blind spot for anti-semitism so long as that anti-semitism is coming from parts of the community that are not white so here is Lewis Farrakhan doing more of this just really discussing stuff white folks are going down and Satan is going down and Farrakhan by God's grace has pulled a cover of betsy panic Jude and I'm here to say your time is up your world is men's peg I mean he's just he's one of the worst people on planet Earth hey this is the guy who who keith Ellison who could have been the head of DNC was endorsed by Chuck Schumer to be the head of the DNC he was a member of the Nation of Islam he defended Louis Farrakhan for years the Congressional Black Caucus has defended Louis Farrakhan hey the Democrats are so radical that is home likely they would have the brains to actually triangulate with Trump but their radicalism is also they're allowed to get away with it there was a poll yesterday showed 57% of Americans supposedly think Trump is a racist it's like 20% of Republicans and 80 plus percent of Democrats okay how many how many people think that Louis Farrakhan is a racist and therefore the people who associate with him are racist the reason that people think that Trump is racist is because of the associations at the alt-right during the last campaign and some of the comments that he's made well if you're gonna hold the standard that standard has to be held on both sides I don't see a lot of people in the media doing it good on Jake Tapper for doing it okay time for a quick thing I like and then a couple of things that I hate so thing I like today I'm in the middle of a book by Mikhail Bulgakov a Bulgakov rather mikail Booga cough was a it was a guy who lived in the Soviet Union he died I believe in 1941 but he written a book in secret that was essentially a parody of Stalin's Russia it was recommended to me actually by Jordan Peterson and it's quite an interesting book I'm about halfway through it but it is it is a funny book basically the concept is that you are in Stalin's Russia and suddenly Satan shows up and starts having conversations with all the people there and simultaneously there's a there's a tell a retelling of the story of Jesus is not along Biblical lines but with parallels to what's going on in the Soviet Union it's an interesting book it's a well-written book it's a funny book as I say I'm about halfway through it I look forward to giving you my full analysis of it when I finish the book but Jordan has good taste in literature so whatever Jordan recommends on literature I'm I'm always the apt to read okay time for a couple of things that I hate all right so let's begin with a flashback so in in the 2012 election cycle you will remember that the the President of the United States at that point said that the 1980s had called him one of their foreign policy back because Mitt Romney said Russia was a geopolitical threat and the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back okay and and then Vladimir Putin today today announced that he had developed invincible nuclear weapons that can hit anywhere in the world and cannot be stopped by missile defense systems so well but well the presidents of the United States Obama was sleeping on Russia Russia not only interfered in our election they also were building these weapons now president Trump has been a lot harsher on Russia he should be even harsher than that but again Democrats don't have a lot of ground to stand on when they talk about the Russian threat and then talk about how terrible Trump is on Russia okay other things that I hate so Chuck Schumer I talked about the radicalism of the Democrats on race Chuck Schumer demonstrated at full scale yesterday so he was talking on the floor of the Senate about a judicial nominee that President Trump had put forward and he issues just a blatantly racist statement and everybody overlooks it because it's it's it's racism against white people the nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum speaks to the overall lack of diversity and president Trump's elections for the federal judiciary mr. Quattlebaum replaces not one but two scuttled Obama nominees who were African American it's long past time that the judiciary starts looking a lot more like the America it represents having a diversity of views and experience on the federal bench is necessary for the equal administration of justice I'll be voting no on the quadrille down nomination okay this is quite disgusting well he is what he is saying of course is that if you are white you shouldn't have a judicial job if you are black then you should have a judicial job he is judging people specifically based on the color of their skin and then suggesting just as justice Sotomayor once did that if you are a wise Latina woman you have a different perspective on the law okay the whole point of law is that it's supposed to be a rule of law and not of men or women you're not supposed to use your personal experience to decide cases you're not supposed to use your race to decide cases you're supposed to use the words of the law to decide cases unfortunately Democrats don't care about that any longer they've moved into this intersectional cloud from which they're having difficulty escaping if they want Trump to win reelection they should keep going with exactly this kind of stuff but if they also want the country to be ruined they should continue to polarize this race from race and suggest that skin color should be the chief qualifier for being a federal judge just insane okay we'll be back here tomorrow and we'll have mailbag for you i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Joshua Oliveira the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for publishing 2018
