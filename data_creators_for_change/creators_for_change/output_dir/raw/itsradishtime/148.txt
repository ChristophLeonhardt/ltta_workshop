<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd be remiss if I didn't make at least</font>

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,300
one video to celebrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it which is funny</font>

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,950
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> always hated Black History</font>

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,540
Month growing up because there is this

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wear and I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this super</font>

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,250
white Catholic school right so the

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,650
teacher would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right guys we're</font>

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to learn about all these people</font>

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,969
this was not my idea but you know you

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,920
learn about Martin Luther King and

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,320
Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks like every

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,640

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,360
History you didn't learn in school

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,940
hashtag because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many stories</font>

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,590
a big huge moment and her story takes

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,020
place on the sixteenth Street<font color="#CCCCCC"> bridge in</font>

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,640
Milwaukee and I live for four years on

34

black and a woman which are pretty

considerable barriers to be elected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

56
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,190
Common Council in 1956 when she ran she

canvassed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the black neighborhoods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">flyer with no picture and her name was</font>

62
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,170
shortened to Val which is reasonably

<font color="#CCCCCC">gender-neutral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she even found out she</font>

didn't tell anybody until after she was

and is notoriously one of the most

72
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,390
segregated cities in the US and her time

73
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,340
people of color could not buy houses in

74
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,720
white neighborhoods but we're talking

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,720
like burn crosses on the lawn type

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,880
hatred if you do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bell introduced an</font>

77

open housing ordinance in 1962 to remove

live of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the council unanimously</font>

80
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,489
rejected it but she continued to bring

81
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:07,250
it up four<font color="#CCCCCC"> more times and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over here the</font>

82
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,739
black community wonky was like

83
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,270
understandably one hundred percent done

84
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,630
being ignored so they organized a march

85
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,300
across the sixteenth Street bridge into

86
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,220
the exclusively white neighborhood of

87
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,080
baby though was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the crowd of the</font>

88
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,730
first night but she<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon joined these</font>

89
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,920
marches even though everybody advised

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,540
her not to because it would look bad for

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,730
her politically but she had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what</font>

92
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,920
she felt was right so she continued with

93
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,320
these nightly marches that went for 200

94
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,030
days now if you watch footage of these

95
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,910
marches it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like footage out</font>

96
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Selma or out of Ferguson like cops</font>

98
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,420
racial slurs and rocks and like bodily

99
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,270
fluids at the marchers protesters are

100
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,220
getting clogged and beaten and

101
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,100
cast there was Val she was brave she

102
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,440
didn't care if she was screamed at or

103
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,350
attacked or rested these marches just

104
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,940
like the ones in salma and<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout</font>

105
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> south drew this national attention</font>

106
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,940
that eventually convinced LBJ to pass

107
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,130
the Fair Housing Act and well finally

108
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,200
got what she fought so hard for the

109
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,810
legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> reinforcements to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start breaking</font>

110
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,370
down the segregated neighborhoods in

111
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,350
Milwaukee she continued to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight for</font>

112
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,850
civil rights for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of her</font>

113
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,040
political career and continues to do so
