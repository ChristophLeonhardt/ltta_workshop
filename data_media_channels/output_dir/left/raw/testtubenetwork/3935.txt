1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,250
Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
a dominating political force in Israel and

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,550
beyond, is at the center of multiple political
scandals.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,320
Cases of corruption have come up against him,
and some of his closest advisors and confidants.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,860
Recently, police even recommended that Netanyahu
be charged for his alleged involvement in

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
two of the incidents.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,360
Even though Netanyahu has written these allegations
off as a political “witch hunt” against

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,830
him and “fake news” we want to explore
what these cases are all about in the first

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,830
place.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,900
Hey guys I’m Judah, you’re watching NowThis
World and in today’s episode we’re going

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,609
to break down the four cases of alleged corruption
against Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu,

11
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,600
or people close to him.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,280
Let's start with the first case, called “Case
1000.”

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,999
In this case, Netanyahu and his wife Sara
are alleged to have received almost $300,000

14
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:52,059
worth of expensive gifts, like fancy cigars
and champagne, in exchange for political favors

15
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,769
from businessmen over the span of 10 years.

16
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,869
The two men who are said to be behind those
alleged bribes are Israeli-born Hollywood

17
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:03,260
producer Arnon Milchan -- who’s hit movies
include “pretty woman” and recent Oscar

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,440
winner “12 years a slave” -- and Australian
casino mogul James Packer.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,310
Israeli police claim that Milchan received
a number of benefits for his gifts to Netanyahu,

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,370
including the Prime Minister pushing for the
passing of the so-called “Milchan Law”

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,290
which gives tax breaks to Israelis who want
to return to Israel after living overseas

22
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,350
-- a law that would directly benefit Milchan,
as the name of the law implies.

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,360
Netanyahu is also accused of helping Milchan
to get a 10 year visa to the United States,

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,380
preventing the collapse of a Television channel
he had shares in, and more.

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,370
The other Billionaire we mentioned earlier,
James Packer, was a partner of Melchan -- but

26
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,280
police haven’t said how exactly he benefited
from the Prime Minister.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,920
Here’s the thing -- Netanyahu doesn’t
even deny receiving these gifts in the first

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
place.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,550
He’s told police that he has indeed been
given gifts by the billionaires -- but he

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,900
denies that favors were given in exchange
for them.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,800
He says the hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of gifts, were just….

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,670
Tokens of their friendship...

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,320
In this case the police have recommended that
Netanyahu be indicted for bribery, fraud,

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,660
and breach of trust.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,180
The next case is “Case 2000.”

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,469
In this one, police say they have evidence
that implicates Netanyahu in a conspiracy

37
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:20,799
with Arnon Mozes, the owner of the daily newspaper
Yedioth Ahronoth.

38
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,819
Police say the two men agreed to a mutually
beneficial relationship that was not in the

39
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,099
public’s best interest.

40
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,730
Here’s a little background information that’s
important to know: Mozes’ paper has historically

41
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,659
been critical of Netanyahu.

42
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,790
The two by no means, before this point, have
been seen as close confidants of any sorts.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,340
Local media even report that behind closed
doors Netanyahu would refer to Mozes as “Voldemort”

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,239
(you know that villian from the Harry Potter).

45
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,499
Now back to what exactly was negotiated between
the two men.

46
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:54,470
Netanyahu reportedly had asked for more sympathetic
coverage from Mozes’ paper.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,549
In return he would apparently push legislation
forward that would hurt his competitor, Israel

48
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,569
Hayom (which is widely seen as a pro-netanyahu
paper that also happens to be bankrolled by

49
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,069
American billionaire Sheldon Adelson).

50
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,290
Reportedly, police found audio recordings
of the conversation on the phone of Netanyahu's

51
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,830
former chief of staff, Ari Harow.

52
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,370
Harrow is now serving as the state’s witness
in the case against Netanyahu, in exchange

53
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,969
for a lighter sentence in his own case.

54
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,189
The Prime Minister denies any wrong-doing
here also.

55
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:28,540
He doesn’t deny that the conversations took
place, but rather says that they were part

56
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,909
of a plan to get incriminating evidence against
Mozes if he ever tried to blackmail Netanyahu.

57
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,739
But the police aren’t buying that story.

58
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,120
In this case they have recommended that Netanyahu
be indicted for bribery, fraud, and breach

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,040
of trust in this case as well.

60
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Now, onto “Case 3000.”

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,999
Netanyahu is not a suspect in this specific
case, but a number of his top advisors are.

62
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,190
So we’ll just briefly touch on this one.

63
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,409
The case revolves around alleged corruption
and bribery in a state purchase of German

64
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,109
nuclear submarines.

65
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,209
Police allege that some of Netanyahu’s closest
confidants, used their influence to negotiate

66
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,700
the deal and skim profits off the top.

67
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,790
Here’s the thing, Netanyahu’s personal
lawyer, also represents the Israeli agent

68
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,340
of the same German shipyard that makes the
Submarines.

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,360
Police have not recommended Netanyahu be indicted
in this case.

70
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,100
This investigation is reportedly still developing
so it’s certainly one we’ll continue to

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
watch.

72
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,990
Now, the last corruption case so far -- Case
4000.

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,200
Some reports suggest this case would be the
most likely to lead to an indictment of Netanyahu.

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,860
This case is centered around allegations that
Netanyahu used his influence to help his friend

75
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,670
Shaul Elovitch, the owner of Israeli telecommunications
giant Bezeq.

76
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,490
According to state prosecutors, Netanyahu
advanced regulatory benefits worth well over

77
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,160
$200,000.

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,750
In return, Elovitch’s news site ‘Walla!’
would give Netanyahu favorable coverage.

79
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,410
Both Netanyahu and Elovitch deny any wrongdoing
in this case.

80
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,080
But the man who ran Netanyahu’s Communication
ministry tells a different story.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,700
In February, Shlomo Filber signed a state’s
witness agreement to work with prosecutors,

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,200
AND he accuses Netanyahu of directly ordering
him to carry out the corruption scheme.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,270
ALSO earlier this month, former Netanyahu
family spokesperson and suspect in case 4000

84
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,260
Nir Hefetz, also signed a deal to turn state's
witness.

85
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,040
As of the shooting of this video, police have
not yet recommended that Netanyahu be indicted

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,130
in this case.

87
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,860
In addition to all of these cases, Netanyahu's
wife Sara is also likely to be indicted in

88
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,140
her own scandal.

89
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,950
She allegedly misused public funds to pay
for private chefs and more.

90
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,520
Despite whatever evidence is brought up, the
decision whether the Netanyahu’s will be

91
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,550
indicted on any of these cases lies in the
hand of Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit,

92
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,880
who was once a political appointee of Netanyahu’s.

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,740
Despite their history, the Attorney General
says he would not hesitate to indict Netanyahu

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,130
if necessary.

95
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,340
If he does move forward with the indictment,
it could topple one Israel’s longest -serving

96
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,990
Prime Ministers to date, and have repercussions
not only in Israel, but the entire region.

97
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,010
The cases against Netanyahu certainly aren't
the only political scandals going on around

98
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,200
the world today -- so which ones do you want
us to cover next?
