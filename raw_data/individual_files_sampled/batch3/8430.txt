IT'S TO ALLOW OTHERS TO PATRONIZE THE DONALD TRUMP HOTEL. BUT, IS THERE AN ETHICAL DOUBLE STANDARD HERE? OUR BROKEN ETHICS SYSTEM IN THIS WEEK'S SWAMP WATCH. STEVE: THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HIS COMPANY IS BENEFITING FROM FOREIGN LEADERS. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD DONATE ALL PROFITS FROM FOR LATER STAY IN HIS HOTEL TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. HE FELL THROUGH. A FEW MONTHS AGO HE GAVE HUNDRED $53000 IN PROFITS TO THE UNITED STATES TREASURY. LOOK WHO'S BEHIND THE EFFORTS. ONE ORGANIZATION PUSHING THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND OTHER ECZEMA WASHINGTON. IT'S HEADED BY NORM, THE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ETHICS CZAR. HE IS PURSUING DONALD TRUMP OVER HIS HOTEL. IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE IF SOME OF THAT ETHICAL ZEAL DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. WHERE WAS ETHIC NORM WHEN HILLARY CLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT APPROVED $165 BILLION WORTH OF COMMERCIAL OR SALES TO 20 NATIONS WHOSE GOVERNMENT WAS GIVING MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION? WHERE WAS ETHICS WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PAID HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS BY RUSSIAN INVESTMENT BANK WHEN HE GAVE A SPEECH. OR WHEN IN OCTOBER, $210,225,000 FOR A SPEECH IN JAMAICA THAT WAS SPONSORED IN PART BY THE IRISH TELECONFERENCE. A FEW WEEKS EARLIER DID YOU SELL HAD APPLIED FOR MONEY FROM HIS WIFE STATE DEPARTMENT. TWO MONTHS AFTER BILL SPEECH THEY RECEIVED THE FIRST INSTALLMENT. THE CHAIRMAN IS AN IRISH BILLIONAIRE, DENNIS O'BRIEN, A FRIEND OF THE CLINTONS WHO SET UP SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS FOR BILL. HE DONATED MILLIONS OF HIS OWN MONEY. SOMEHOW THE ETHICS ARE NORM WASN'T PART OF THE SWAMPY CLINTON SCHEME. HE WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WAS HELD AS THE MOST SWEEPING ETHICS REFORM IN HISTORY. THEY'RE WORKING NINE CONTRACTS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY RELATE TO THE PRIOR EMPLOYER. THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER HAVE A SHOCKING NUMBER OF LOOP HOLES INCLUDING THE WAIVER ISSUED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO WILLIAM, FORMER LOBBYIST WHO WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. ANOTHER REVOLVING DOOR LOOPHOLE. ACCORDING TO POLITICAL, ONE WHO HELPED WITH OBAMA CARE LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION IN FEBRUARY OF 2015 AND RESURFACED IN JULY AS CEO OF A HEALTH INSURER TRADE GROUP CALLED AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN. IF THAT WASN'T SWAMPY ENOUGH, SHE ALSO REGISTERED AS A FEDERAL LOBBYIST. SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE COMPLIED WITH OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON ETHICS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LOBBY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DIRECTLY. SHE MET WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND GAVE ADVICE TO HER COLLEAGUES WHO COULD LOBBY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DIRECTLY. IT GETS WORSE, THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ONLY RELATED TO REGISTERED LOBBYISTS. MANY WERE DEREGISTERED FROM THE ETHICS SYSTEM. THEY CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME LIKE STRATEGIC ADVISOR. THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT. THE HAIR HAS REPORTEDLY NEVER BEEN A SINGLE CASE TO IGNORE THAT REQUIREMENT FOR LOBBYISTS. DOCUMENTS ESTIMATE THAT SPECIAL INTEREST SPEND $3 BILLION A YEAR LOBBYING AN EMPLOYEE AROUND 10000 LOBBYISTS. ESTIMATES WITH UNREGISTERED LOBBYISTS FOR THE NUMBER CLOSE TO $6 BILLION IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND LOBBYISTS. TEN TIMES AS MANY. SO MUCH FOR THE MOST SWEEPING ETHICS REFORM IN HISTORY. NOW, ISN'T IT CONVENIENT FOR THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THEIR OWN SYSTEMIC SLOPPINESS BY TARGETING THE TRUMP HOTEL? THE LAWYERS, LOBBYISTS AND POLITICIANS IN THE CRONYISM THAT WASHINGTON HAS BECOME. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ETHICS FOR THE TRUMP HOTEL.
