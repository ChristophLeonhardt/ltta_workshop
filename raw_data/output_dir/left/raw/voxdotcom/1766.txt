1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,959
“A titanic fight over the future of the
Supreme Court...”

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,580
“...Justice Anthony M Kennedy, announcing
he will retire...”

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,680
“...The first issue that comes to mind is
Roe v. Wade...”

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,220
“...Roe v. Wade is doomed.”

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,220
Abortion has been a hot button issue for decades,
but President Trump is ready to tip the balance

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,810
of the Supreme Court into one that could
reverse the historic decision that established

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,250
a woman’s right to choose.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,070
Do you want the court, including
the justices that you will name, to overturn

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,040
Roe v. Wade which includes, in fact states, a woman's right to abortion?

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,540
"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,320
pro-life judges, I would think that that will
go back to the individual states.”

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Trump is right.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,790
And even though Roe v. Wade guarantees access
to abortion, states are already heavily involved

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,560
in how easy, or difficult, it is to get one.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,520
States have always had a stake in abortion
rights.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
In their Roe v. Wade decision, the justices
ruled that a woman had the right to an abortion

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,369
in the first and second trimester of pregnancy
and that the states had the right to ban abortions

18
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,520
in the third and final trimester.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,909
But states also had limited powers to regulate
abortions.

20
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,579
From 1989 to 2007 a series of Supreme Court
decisions granted states more and more regulatory

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,200
power.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,840
Most importantly, Planned Parenthood v. Casey
replaced Roe v. Wade's "trimester framework"

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,450
– moving to a new standard, that said that the state
couldn’t impose an "undue burden" on a woman

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,149
seeking abortion.
But it didn’t clearly define what substantial

25
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:38,540
obstacles to a women’s right to choose would
look like, or when a state was allowed to ban the procedure.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,660
So states that wanted to limit abortions
took advantage of the ambiguity.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,710
Since 1973 there are have been 1,193 state
level restrictions on abortion.

28
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,009
And one-third of these

29
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,399
have been enacted in the past 7 years.
Not all of these restrictions are based on

30
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,359
medical science or evidence.

31
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,369
Some states prohibit abortion based on gender
selection, and some mandate that a woman undergo

32
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,840
an ultrasound and require
she be asked if she wants to see the fetus.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,829
In some parts of America, restrictions have
made abortion essentially inaccessible.

34
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:16,430
Women in Rapid City, South Dakota, for example,
have to travel 318 miles to the closest abortion

35
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
facility.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,129
And more than half of all american women live
in a state with four or more types of restrictions

37
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,349
on abortion.

38
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:27,720
If Roe v. Wade was overturned, each individual
state would decide the legality of abortion.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,280
A few states already have laws on the books that explicitly
protect abortion rights.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,319
And thirteen states have laws that would automatically
ban some or all abortions the minute that

41
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,230
Roe v. Wade were overturned.

42
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,480
And while abortion is largely considered
a partisan issue,

43
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,010
most Americans, including a majority of Republicans,
don’t want to see the case completely overturned.

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,689
If the Supreme Court reversed its decision
tomorrow, things could drastically change

45
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,640
for some women.
But for women whose rights are already being

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,640
whittled away, one restriction at a time,
the future may not look so different from

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
the present.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:00:00,000
“What is at stake, is womens' freedom!”
