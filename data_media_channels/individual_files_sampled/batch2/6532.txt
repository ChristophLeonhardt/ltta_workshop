Oprah Winfrey gave an inspirational speech during the Golden Globes which led to many people speculating that she is positioning herself for a presidential run now a lot of interesting conversations happen in regard to this that I want to share with you first NBC had apparently tweeted support for Oprah running and then promptly took that tweet down after Donald Trump jr. criticized them for it so let's go to the tweet the now deleted tweet said nothing but respect for our future president hashtag Golden Globes with a picture of Oprah Winfrey now Donald Trump jr. did not take kindly to this and he tweeted about it so let's take a quick look at that he wrote in case anyone had any doubts about where the media stands this should take care of it the bias against Donald Trump is now so obvious they have simply given up hiding it mmm the bias against Donald Trump should have been obvious with his insanely low approval rating but nonetheless can you trust anything they say at this point trust them a lot more than I trust you now I don't know why they took down the tweet I would have kept it up but after the criticism NBC tweeted an explanation of what happened they said yesterday a tweet about the Golden Globes and Oprah Winfrey was sent by a third-party agency for NBC entertainment in real-time during the broadcast it is in reference to a joke made during the monologue and not meant to be a political statement we have since removed the tweet okay so what does Donald Trump think about all three of us well it's unsurprising that he goes back and forth on any given day in regard to any given issue or any given person but in the past Trump had been very supportive of Oprah Winfrey in fact we have some examples in Twitter form these are from 2012 Oprah will end up doing just fine with her Network she knows how to win April 5th of 2012 and then he also tweeted by the way where is Oprah good question four years ago she strongly supported Obama now she is Island anyway who cares I adore Oprah and I want to toss to this video that's kind of sweet no okay so I want you guys to pay close attention to the following video because it's from 1999 Larry King was interviewing Donald Trump about his possible presidential run and just listen to his rhetoric listen to the clarity of what he's saying and more importantly listen to what he had to say about Oprah take a look you have a vice presidential candidate in mind well I really haven't gotten quite there yet it's just I love Oprah Oprah would always be my first choice Oh Oprah your competitor right yeah just opposite you know what she's out there she's really a great woman she is a terrific woman she's she's somebody that's very special I have not even thought about it I guess we'll see we'll see maybe that's part of the whole process would she be someone I mean kidding aside that you might think if she'd do it she'd be fantastic she's popular she's brilliant she's a wonderful woman I mean if she'd ever do it I don't know that she'd never do it she's got your eyes her if she'd be sort of like me I mean I have a lot of things going she's got a lot of things going but a particular terror was a that would be a pretty good ticket but she's a very exceptional woman very exceptional woman yeah I'm sure he'll feel like he has to be consistent with things that he said in the past the most inconsistent man in existence yeah yeah so look we'll see how this all plays out but I will leave you with one last video this is Sean Spicer speaking to Pierce Morgan about what he thinks about Oprah possibly running for president take a look she doesn't have the political infrastructure and and we've seen this before in our history where people who have tried to pop in that are not in politics and have had a difficult time adjusting Shirley Carey Donald Trump no hold on piers let me finish the suit I said the TV star but Pierce Pierce hold on that will go handily we're leading me away from my guest row enteritis your new caring you've brought the pears oh I know and let me finish nice let me finish the sentence I was saying that was standing president Donald Trump proves that there is an appetite for outsiders and that you don't necessarily have to have them the question is was that an anomaly or is that the new norm that's an aggressive show that he's on there I didn't really just yell the person's name at them no that was great yeah I loved every part of that I like that he got called out you were the press secretary for a president who had no political infrastructure going in who had no experience who was literally a reality show person and who can't keep his mind you know focused on one thing for longer than 10 seconds I mean come on you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm /join
