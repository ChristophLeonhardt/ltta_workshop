in the conflict in Afghanistan like in most Wars it's sometimes difficult if not impossible to see clearly what is happening and why the first casualty of war they say is the truth way from the bombs and the bullets there is another war being fought here that of propaganda the winning of hearts and minds each side bombard the people with their message of success more ham that solidarity in because we're having many successes against the terrorists we're killing many the Afghan forces with our allies are getting stronger people are skeptical that they're being given the true casualty figures and whether the successes are as successful as both sides claim war zones are breeding grounds for fake news if you really look at it from the neutral perspective I think both of them are are trying to hype whatever they're doing and in reality they are quite far from from reality it's always been hard for many Afghans especially those who are educated to believe everything they're being told in this murky world of warlords corrupts military officials and politicians and shady profiteering businessmen people here long ago lost trust but it's not just distrust of their own for 16 years the US has given Afghanistan's support and promises visiting troops in December American Vice President Mike Pence made a declaration I believe victory is closer than ever before General John Nicholson head of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan says they are on course to win he is the 8th US commodity claimed victory was in sight so far the afghan campaign has cost america a trillion dollars and 2400 lives in the propaganda war the Taliban is not an amateur the group has professional websites in multiple languages uses Twitter and other social media pumping out its message 24 hours a day suicide attacks are choreographed with media in mind telecommunication internet is the penetration return of one asanas is getting higher and higher day by day not just in urban understand but also in rural area Afghanistan so so it might sort of help them in recruitment in recruiting new officers in recruiting recruitment of new fighters and conveying the message to their audiences I think it's it's quite effective absolutely media in Afghanistan are said to be flourishing and independent but they're now on the frontline of the propaganda war last year 21 journalists were killed doing their job Afghan media certainly one of the success stories over the past 17 years is paying a very high price for telling the truth forgiving the Afghan people to voice their deserve Hasib Sadat is a cameraman who suffered eye damage when a Taliban suicide bomber targeted their vehicle seven colleagues died in the blast every time I go out I'm scared my family wanted me to stop but I need the job we need I'd have works I'll have no choice but it's a risk the true story of this war can be seen in the hospital wards and graveyards across the country to date hundreds of thousands of people most of them civilians have been killed and wounded in 40 years of conflict that in itself is almost unbelievable Tony Berkeley al Jazeera Kabul
