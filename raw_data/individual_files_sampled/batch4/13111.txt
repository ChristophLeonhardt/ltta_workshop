Veronica says Andrew really how do we stop California what do you mean Veronica we live here you can't destroy us she said she read today that San Francisco is registering illegals to vote and what can we the people do to fight against this and the other awful things our state does well at first I think what we should do is take a bandsaw along the border and just cut it until the switch goes out to see you make sure I'm in Nevada when it's the breakup of these states I believe in doing anything we can to stop California from being what it is it is the worst it's one of the worst run states in the Union it would be paradise if leftist weren't in charge of it it could be so much more than it is the drought is the fault of the droughts we have of the fault of leftist not that there aren't droughts here but them how bad they are is their fault that San Francisco is now just a cesspool it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world and it looks like garbage LA is a homeless center it is just disgusting and the fact that they can keep doing it while people don't don't pay any attention to it the fact that we have no media here that covers it or they just don't they just hide it all and blame right-wingers for everything so I think what what can we do busting it up is one place to start but the problem with that my only negative to that is then you have potentially federal well maybe maybe so and maybe not I mean because the thing is you know there are plenty of conservative enclaves in this in this state and so maybe you put some of those aside don't gerrymander it so that the Liberals get everything but the thing is big is generally bad big generally doesn't work one of the wonderful things about the federal process is it lets people test test out different ways of being sure the the part of the state with LA and it is gonna be more liberal than other parts but let it let it happen and see what goes on because I think that when you look at Texas how well that's run under a Republican rule endless Republican rule and then you look at California and how bad it is if Silicon Valley weren't here this place would be going
