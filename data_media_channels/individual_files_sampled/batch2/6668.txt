following the hearing involving dr. Blasi Ford and Brett Kavanaugh we have we now have time to reflect on some of Cavanaugh's answers and it appears that he was either misleading or just flat-out lying in some of the answers that he gave now we have a number of examples a number of videos so I want to get through these videos as quickly as possible so we can have a conversation about them but with that said let's give you the first example let's look at beach week Ralph's Club biggest contributor what does the word Ralph mean and that that probably refers to throwing up I'm known to have a weak stomach and I always have it's this is well known anyone who's known me likes a lot of these people behind me known me my whole life no you know I got a weak stomach whether it's with beer or with spicy food or anything so the vomiting that you reference in the Ralph's Club reference related to the consumption of alcohol Sara I was the top of my class academically busted my butt in school have you I don't know if it's buffed or boofed how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were 16 okay Jenn we want to talk about flatulence at age 16 on a yearbook page um I'm game I did not find him credible I don't believe booth is flatulence I don't believe the devil's triangle is a drinking game and I don't believe calling yourself a girl's alumnus is being her friend yeah I think that this is relevant I mean it's we're having this weird conversation in this country where we're looking at somebody's yearbook from a you know so long ago etc and and I get it like if braggadocio from your yearbook page is not something that should keep you from the Supreme Court but we're looking at his credibility and so and I don't mind him lying back then or doing stupid things not sexual assault but the stupid the overdrinking etc who cares about that right but why is he lying about it now the the booth thing apparently I didn't know they said to look it up I guess I'm a dork or whatever right it is not referred to flatulence it is a ruff say no sex so these are all uncomfortable terms and uncomfortable things to discuss but that's what we're in and by the way Cavanaugh asked horribly inappropriate questions about Clinton himself so there's no ground to stand on there so why would you and unless why don't you just say what it is and go out we were goofy teenagers talking about anal sex I mean bringing that up is terrible but Devil's Triangle very relevant because that is not a drinking game that is two on one two guys on one girl now everybody knows that now you're lying about it right now you're not lying about it when you were 16 or 17 you're lying about it right now and so that makes me wonder why are you lying about it I think for me I think the bigger picture is are we okay with our country being run and presided over by judges who are sexual predators or should or should that not be okay I'm certainly not okay with it yeah and I think it's really tell you know women are gonna have to save this country and it's been run long enough by sexual predators and it's just it's time to put an end to it and I'm if you're a woman you're out there please run for office please become a judge please become the head of a revolutionary cadre whatever you've got to do to turn this around women should be in the lead from now on right it's what that position represents it's the highest level of our justice system right these are the people who interpret and and enforce our Constitution and do we trust someone who could potentially be you know an alleged attempted rapist to to carry out that job and by the way again we don't know which is why this FBI investigation is so incredibly important however if you take those allegations out of it and just focus on the number of lies that were told during that hearing that's problematic I mean he's testifying under oath this is serious we know why he lied about Devil's Triangle because it's the same accusation that that dr. Ford levied it's not that you know it doesn't it's not exactly the same thing but it's he didn't want that suggestion to this Devil's ballpark right yeah but look but look at all the lies ralphing dude you Ralph because of the beer everybody knows that puts their reaction to spicy food and a weak stomach on there age but they're not that yeah yeah no yeah I know sometimes when I drink too much coffee after three o'clock I pee quite a bit let's go to all my yearbook page I just gotta say about the robbery look if you were human and credible and not and not lying what you would say is yeah Ralph and we went and we drank too much beer and ice threw up that doesn't mean I did a sexual assault but yeah I drank too much beer it's not that hard his go-to move is the lie he can't help himself at every turn it's one lie after another could even combine the lie with part of the truth in that you know the thing of it is my friends they could all drink eight or nine beers and I drank three or four and I threw up so that's why that's it that's right we're like everybody believes that gut instinct this the lion he's done it almost at every turn the reference to Renata was another lie so let's take a look at that exchange you mentioned I think the Renata or Rene Renata I don't know how you pronounce that that's a proper name of an individual you know Renata Renata it's spelled with an e at the end re na te is direct okay and then after that is the word alumnus what does the word alumnus mean in that context I explained that in my opening statement we she was a great friend of ours we bunch of us went to dances with her she hung out with us as a group the media circus that has been generated by this thought in reported that it referred to sex it did not I never had any as she herself said on the record any kind of sexual interaction with her and I'm sorry how that's been misinterpreted and sorry about that as I explained in my opening statement because she's a good person and to have her name dragged through these hearings a joke and really an embarrassment so that one was so important that after the show was over yesterday we had to go and do it in the postgame for the members because I wanted to clarify because when he got emotional about Renata in his opening statement I gave him credit yesterday on the show and said it seemed like he was really regretful that they had done the Renata alumnus thing because that's 14 guys a lot of football players something about the same girl we all know what that means right it doesn't mean that they thought this is the one goal we really respect just to become on no one believes that but it seemed like in the opening statement like he was regretful about that but wasn't in the follow-up questions was sheldon whitehouse when we showed him the post game in what you just saw right there he continues to lie and pretend oh no us football players we wrote that because we just liked her so much no no everyone who's ever gone to high school in America knows you put that in there because you guys claim you hooked up with her and so I can I can stomach you being regretful I we said it because we hooked up with her and I feel so terrible about that we should have never done that we were stupid seventeen year olds god dammit why did we do that right that I can live with you saying no no no it wasn't about sex it was because we really liked her okay that's an obvious slide wait a lot of us took us took her to dances and again just to be clear it's not it doesn't prove anything that anything happened in high school merely claims that they all decided to claim that they had exactly and so Renato was one of the individuals who supported him when all these allegations came out and and essentially said that she could stand by his character and that he's a good person and then once this whole Renata yearbook reference came up and she was notified about it she was really hurt and she's like I can't believe that they would do such a thing it's so hurtful and so I do believe that he's regretful or remorseful I do think that he was genuine about that in his opening statement but I also believe that he's lying about what that reference really knows no one I don't care if you're manga I don't care if your Trump's uncle you know that's referencing hooking up and not how much they respected her you know it you know that's a lie and then he what I would bothered me was in the White House questioning and of course as closer examination really a really important work that Sheldon Whitehouse did was his notion that because she claimed nothing had happened between them that somehow she had exonerated him and that then he was able to in his mind take this moral high ground and sit back in his chair like I can't believe you're bringing her up she said nothing happened obviously you know that that bothered me enormous ly so we're judging people's credibility here we're judging it's an unfortunate situation but we're judging Christine Blasi for its credibility and we're judging Cavanaugh's credibility all the Republicans now I don't know if it's all but almost all of them have it now even gone on the record and say yes he was credible even Trump today said she was credible so and they hired a prosecutor to break down her credibility and she didn't do it the minute the prosecutors started to break down kapnos credibility by pointing out the calendar July first date where the party seems to have happened then she's done she's done Lindsey Graham yell at somebody right so now we're showing you how many different lies if we're judging credibility one person seems immaculate the other person seems like a great number of occasions where his natural instinct is to lie so let's go to his exchange with Kamala Harris senator Harris because this has to do with the polygraph test he refused to take a polygraph test well whereas dr. Blasi Ford did now before we get into this debate about the credibility of a polygraph test I want you to just quickly watch this exchange and then I'll fill in the blanks for you judge Cavanaugh have you taken a professionally administered polygraph test as it relates to this issue no the I'll do whatever the committee wants of course those are not admissible in federal court but I'll do whatever the committee wants they're not in missable in federal court because they're not reliable I think as you know so you have not taken one right okay so he was not having a polygraph test okay he's like they're not reliable now let me quote you Brett Kavanaugh in a decision he made as a judge as the government notes law enforcement agencies use polygraphs to test the credibility of witnesses and criminal defendants those agencies also use polygraphs to screen applicants for security clearances so that they may be deemed suitable for work in critical law enforcement defense and intelligence collection roles and he went on to say the government has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes so he's clearly on the record in a decision saying polygraphs are reliable enough for the government to use them especially when screening someone for which is exactly what they're doing with Cavanaugh now is it go to camera that's totally unreliable I don't know who looks guilty who looks guilty it's super obvious I would draw a direct comparison here between a polygraph test and hearsay evidence which is not admissible in a court of law but which every law-enforcement agency uses when they gather the information Tom said that he killed that guy well you can't call me in court necessarily maybe to say that but they're gonna call Tom and they could investigate it right yeah all right so the next exchange is with Cory Booker and it just pay close attention to what Cavanaugh says about one of dr. Blasi Ford's friends all the witnesses who were there say it didn't happen miss kaisers her longtime friend said she never saw me to party with or without doctor and miss Kaiser has said clearly and I'll quote what she said she said she does not remember that I in question that that supports what you said but she also says that she believes dr. Ford so that was referenced in a Washington Post story so she absolutely did say that she believes dr. Ford and she also said that she had no recollection as Cory Booker perfectly laid out there and it didn't matter because Brett Kavanaugh kept repeating that lie over and over again throughout the hearing which was ridiculous right to make it seem as though everyone disagrees with what dr. Blasi Ford says everyone's siding with me and that's not the distinction being they didn't say that it didn't happen no one said oh I remember that party that's crazy I was with Bret the entire time that never happened or I was with Christine that entire time and it never happened what they said is I don't I have no I don't know I don't get the night you're talking about it's a different thing so although it's great that Cory Booker asked that I thought again as every Democratic senator missed I thought they missed the main point you keep saying these witnesses exonerate you and while they don't help her argument they really serve no purpose whatsoever as to whether the event took place but the thing he's saying about her friend specifically is specifically wrong and purposely wrong and repeatedly wrong and is and if you want to say hey I get a he's lying about Devils triangle and ralphing etc but it's not important one I think it is important because of her credit because of the credibility issue but this is clearly important about one of the witnesses and that witness says I believe Ford and he keeps saying in these tests in his own testimony all she exonerated me she said that it didn't happen no she didn't know she didn't why are you and you're gonna go on the Supreme Court and that at a bare minimum let's say that he's super mistaken about how what she said you gonna make those kind of mistakes on the Supreme Court so not a big deal is is perjury not a big deal anymore and what's what's the forest for the trees here like what he flies about all this up say it out loud why is he lie why is he lying because these are acts that you can commit with impunity and where you can reach the highest offices of land having done this stuff you just put it under the rug because you're gonna be supported that's the thing as he's being supported by Trump and by the system that put him forward and and the final irony is one of the ways that Cavanaugh got famous was by serving on ken starr's investigation of Bill Clinton and he was according to all the people involved the most fervent advocate of going the most aggressive against Bill Clinton why was he so mad at Bill Clinton he said it was an outrage that he lied about sex under oath under oath right that's exactly what Kevin I just did on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
