the state of Vermont has been notorious for pro-gun legislation however it is a testament to how incredibly persuasive and powerful the parkland Florida students are because the state has just advanced significant gun control measures in fact the governor of the state Phil Scott who has an A rating from the NRA has also decided and agreed that gun control measures need to be passed in the state of Vermont now Vermont's Republican Governor Phil Scott who campaigned in part by pledging to protect gun rights is preparing to sign a package of gun control measures overwhelmingly passed in the state's General Assembly now here is what these gun measures will do it will raise the age for purchasing a gun to 21 also ban the sale of bump stocks impose universal background checks for all gun purchases this includes gun purchases between private individuals and partially ban high-capacity magazines again Vermont is known as a very pro-gun state in fact if you look at the arguments that Bernie Sanders has made in regard to lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers you see that he's not necessarily as progressive on that very issue and it's because he comes from such a pro-gun state where hunting is a staple it's something that the people living there really want to protect now pro-gun groups routinely listed Vermont as one of the friendlier states for gun owners based on their lack of gun laws and the National Rifle Association gave the governor a 93 percent rating during his 2016 campaign but here's what governor Scott had recently decided well on February 15th that was one day after the parklands shooting police arrested an 18 year-old named Jack Sawyer in Vermont for plotting a mass school shooting of his own and that close call reportedly shook governor Scott he was quoted as saying if we are at a point when we put our kids on a bus and send them to school without being able to guarantee their safety who are we as a result I've been asking myself are we doing everything we can to protect our kids and it seems as though he's willing to put his own biases aside to do what's right for the people of Vermont this is really encouraging and surprising coming from Vermont but I think it comes down to the governor recognizing that the buck stops with him and this very close encounter so soon on the heels of parkland really did shake him up and it's nice to see that that spilled over into sensible gun reform and that they're proposing that in a really meaningful way and I think when you when you look at what is gonna be on this bill I mean this is so reasonable this this really makes me very hopeful for other states that maybe feel like it could be an uphill battle that this is something that the that there will protect responsible gun owners that doesn't affect them at all and will protect children so I'm I was very encouraged to read this yeah it's it's incremental you know you're right I mean grace is right when she talks about the fact that it's encouraging if you want the elimination of assault rifles then this doesn't really address that and I do want the elimination of assault rifles and I don't understand why these weapons of war are in people's hands but back to this story in Vermont it is good news because they are so reluctant to touch this issue it is a third rail issue as Anna says even Bernie Sanders doesn't really get involved in in this in any big way so to see them be proactive from a governor who's avoided it in the past it is good news and yeah it doesn't go as far as we'd like to see eventually and it doesn't but but boy it goes a lot farther than you ever thought it would go in Vermont right and then for me it byway mark I completely agree with you that you know the measures aren't really that big of a deal if you look at the big picture right but the reason why I think this is encouraging is because think about what happened after the Las Vegas shooting which was the largest mass shooting in modern US history right we have so many people gunned down at a music festival it impacts people who are in a country music festival right so they're not necessarily people who are like ultra lips and even experiencing that themselves you still have a huge portion of this pop country that doesn't want any gun control at all we couldn't even get bumps tox band after that shooting and honestly after that happened I had personally internally I didn't vocalize this given up I had given up I had no faith in our lawmakers I had no faith sorry to say but in the American people because we just let it happen over and over again and I felt like any discussion about it at that point was a wasted effort what these kids have done is at least given me a renewed hope that change can happen and that's big that's huge I know that there are a lot of other people out there that felt the same way I did they just wanted to give up and I think it's important to see these victories for yes what they are you know it's not going far enough but there's momentum going and I'm really hoping that we keep fighting that we don't get complacent and push for more change yeah and it starts with at least some change I completely agree with you mark I think that there does need to be more change but it's just so encouraging to see any change especially bringing up Las Vegas yeah you know how many times have we you know sat here talked amongst ourselves just being so frustrated that there wasn't even a bill you know and this was overwhelmingly passed by the General Assembly that that I have to take is encouraging because so much of this has been discouraging just to see you know all the low blows that have been thrown against these kids that have sparked this movement and this is this is something that we can celebrate this is something that is encouraging this is building on that momentum and hopefully there will be more that we can also celebrate if you like this video bless your heart we got
