1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:13,520
>>THE UN HAS DONE A STUDY INTO
POVERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,070
HE RECENTLY CONDUCTED AN
INTERVIEW WITH THE LOS ANGELES

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,310
TIMES THAT SHOWS YOU JUST HOW
BAD THINGS HAVE GONE INTO THE

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,369
UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO
WEALTH INEQUALITY.

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:40,690
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

6
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,500
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS
IMPACTING EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:01:06,070
RACE OR GENDER.

8
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,439
ESSENTIALLY HE SAYING THERE IS
NOW A HUGE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE

9
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,250
RICH AND THE POOR AND IT IS
GETTING WORSE UNDER THE

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,979
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

11
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,810
HE COMPILED DATA FOR THIS STUDY
LATE LAST YEAR.

12
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,570
HE IS SAYING THAT THIS WAS A
PROBLEM BEFORE BUT THE TRUMP

13
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,840
ADMINISTRATION HAS EXACERBATED
THAT PROBLEM TREMENDOUSLY.

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:45,689
HE GIVES AN EXAMPLE 

15
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:58,220
OF WHERE
HAPPENS THE MOST.

16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,149
>> ANYONE WHO WAS BEEN TO
DOWNTOWN LA KNOWS THAT AT ONE

17
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,079
POINT PEOPLE I KNOW WHO WERE
THINKING OF GETTING AN OFFICE

18
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,180
SPACE DOWNTOWN, THEY WENT DOWN
THERE AND THEY RAN WITH THEIR

19
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,710
HAIR ON FIRE BECAUSE SKID ROW
HAS HOMELESS, BUT A LOT OF

20
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,080
THEM HAVE MENTAL ISSUES.

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,870
INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE WITH THOSE FOLKS,

22
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,680
LA JUST PUTS THEM IN ONE AREA OF
DOWNTOWN AND THEY JUST WANDER.

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,630
I DON'T MEAN TO DENIGRATE THEM
BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE

24
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,310
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,310
BUT IT IS LIKE ZOMBIES.

26
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,780
PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

27
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,440
WE JUST PENNED THEM IN ONE
PLACE AND GIVE THEM ALMOST NO

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
RESOURCES.

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,970
>>SOMETHING

30
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,010
DEVASTATING IS HAPPENING IN
DOWNTOWN LA RIGHT NOW.

31
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,010
FOR A LONG TIME SKID ROW WAS
BASICALLY ONE AREA WHERE

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,810
YOU WOULD FIND HOMELESS PEOPLE
WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES.

33
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,500
YOU WILL FIND CHILDREN THERE AS
WELL BY THE WAY.

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,150
THERE ARE HUGE DEVELOPMENTS
THROUGHOUT DOWNTOWN LA AND THERE

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,490
ARE LUXURY CONDOS OR APARTMENTS
AND THE DEVELOPERS KNOW THAT NO

36
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,380
ONE IS GOING TO WANT TO BUY
THOSE EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES IF

37
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,580
YOU HAVE SKID ROW RIGHT BESIDE
THEM.

38
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,260
SO THEY ARE KIND OF PUSHING THEM
OUT THROUGHOUT THE REST OF LOS

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,590
ANGELES COUNTY.

40
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,280
AND THE HOMELESS ISSUE IS NOW
SEEN EVERYWHERE.

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,390
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE,
YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON

42
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,390
THE STREETS.

43
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,940
>>WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER AND
PART OF THE REASON IS THAT WE

44
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,590
JUST CHOSE NOT TO SPEND ANY
MONEY ON IT.

45
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:48,030
UTAH HAS AN AMAZING PROGRAM
WHERE THEY BUILT HOMES FOR

46
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,700
THE HOMELESS.

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,120
THAT SOUNDS BOTH LOGICAL AND
CRAZY.

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,450
IT WORKED.

49
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,930
AND IT COSTS A LOT LESS MONEY.

50
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,310
BUT WE DON'T DO THAT IN LOS
ANGELES.

51
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:05,500
AND IT IS NOT JUST THE BIG
CITIES.

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,990
YOU GO TO PARTS OF KENTUCKY,
ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, AND

53
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,150
YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION
THROUGHOUT THE LAND.

54
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:52,580
>>AND HE DOES TOUCH 
ON THAT.

55
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,570
ONE
FINAL PART THAT REALLY SPOKE OUT

56
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,160
TO ME BECAUSE A LOT OF US HAVE
BEEN BRAINWASHED INTO

57
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:15,100
THINKING THIS WAY.

58
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,860
>> IT 
IS A STAT I KEEP TELLING

59
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
YOU GUYS.

60
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,220
BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015 THE TOP
200 CORPORATE GIVERS THE

61
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,130
POLITICIANS GAVE $5.8 BILLION TO
POLITICIANS.

62
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,940
WHAT DO THEY RECEIVE IN RETURN?

63
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
$4.4 TRILLION.

64
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,790
THEY GOT SO MUCH MORE THAN ANY
WELFARE WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY

65
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,139
TIMES 10.

66
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,139
WHY?

67
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,280
BECAUSE WE HAVE ENCOURAGED
AND ACCEPTED CORRUPTION.

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,140
AND THE CORRUPTION DOES NOT GO
TO THE POOR AND POWERLESS,

69
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,710
IT GOES TO THE RICH AND THE
POWERFUL.

70
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,070
THAT IS WHEN SOMEONE FROM
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY COMES IN,

71
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,370
SOMEONE WHO IS TRAINED IN
SPOTTING THESE PROBLEMS IN OTHER

72
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,360
COUNTRIES AND SAYS OH MY GOD, IT
IS HERE.

73
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,220
AND BY THE WAY IT IS A RACIAL
ISSUE IN A LOT OF PLACES AND

74
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,370
UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE
SEPARATE AND QUITE UNEQUAL

75
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,930
IN A LOT OF PLACES IN AMERICA.

76
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,700
BUT IN A LOT OF PLACES IT IS NOT
RACIAL.

77
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:28,250
YOU MIGHT SAY THOSE KNUCKLEHEADS
VOTED FOR TRUMP, THEY VOTED

78
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,030
FOR TRUMP BECAUSE HE WAS AGAINST
HILLARY CLINTON.

79
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,580
HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE
ESTABLISHMENT.

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,840
IF YOU LIVE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND
THAT ESTABLISHMENT HAS BEEN

81
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,810
SCREWING YOU FOR DECADE AFTER
DECADE, YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING

82
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,460
TO VOTE FOR THEM?

83
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,240
TRUMP WAS A
WILD STAB IN THE DARK AND MAYBE

84
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,450
THEY WOULD'VE VOTED FOR SOMEONE
ELSE BUT THAT IS WHY THERE IS

85
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,400
THIS GREAT ANGER AGAINST THIS
ESTABLISHMENT AND THE

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,650
POWERFUL AND THE ELITES IN THIS
COUNTRY.

87
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,730
WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND
THE MEDIA IN WASHINGTON AND

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:00:00,000
NEW YORK GREATLY UNDERESTIMATE.
