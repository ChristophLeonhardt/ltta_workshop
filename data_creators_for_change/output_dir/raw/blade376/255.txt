same format by Gordon Brown himself it's

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,510
being seen as an attempt to reach out to

17
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,370
younger voters and to prove that darling

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,910
digital age let's hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

20
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,940
questions which have been posted so far

21
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,890
YouTube is like this huge online

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,050
community thing where we talk share

23
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,360
opinions share videos what I want to

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,210
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why is it on every single video</font>

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,149
and on your main page that you don't

26
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,390
allow comments is there anything going

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,359
to be done about the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> living in</font>

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,629
Britain because it is far too expensive

29
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,040
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous I thought I'd make an</font>

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,740
effort with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> jazzy look you should try</font>

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,750
Gordon I think it would see very very

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,400
well my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you Prime Minister</font>

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,350
is do you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that freedom of speech</font>

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,880
has been restricted and political

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,270
correctness has in fact gone mad with me

36
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,070
now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> miles died he's very</font>

37
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,960
considerately worn the same clothes he

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,970
deserted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the house coming by the</font>

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,130
next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an active member of the</font>

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,509
YouTube community it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of the</font>

41
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,100
first to post his question for gordon

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,439
brown on the ass the PM site now miles

43
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,700
do you really think that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,500
discover something you didn't know by

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,420
posting that question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're</font>

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get a great deal of honesty</font>

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,350
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Prime Minister because he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

48
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,290
a an aspect now which he's exposed and

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,329
I'm placing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in question everyone's going</font>

50
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see my question and then everyone's</font>

51
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,659
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how he's editing it and how</font>

52
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,040
he's replied so if he doesn't response

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,829
the question he's played the rules wrong

54
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">although you've got I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,710
question don't you and then people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

56
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,119
going to vote on<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they</font>

57
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,409
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is good enough</font>

58
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go to him but you don't necessarily</font>

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,189
control you know you cannot you can put

60
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,960
to him a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a and he could</font>

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,669
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> B and you're not necessarily</font>

62
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,619
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have any recourse back to him I</font>

63
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,239
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've comments on the videos</font>

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,100
in that it gives

65
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,600
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is exactly being</font>

66
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,370
asked i mean i can speak with other

67
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,620
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who watch my videos and which to</font>

68
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,440
address a point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he does if he</font>

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,120
misses the point completely then that's

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
going to be a lack of exactly and

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully he understands that or else</font>

72
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very so you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's do you</font>

73
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,430
think it's something that I mean do you

74
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,960
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people who are normally quite</font>

75
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,970
politically engaged are just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

76
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,800
this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thing or or does it have</font>

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,570
appeal to a wider community would you

78
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,700
for example if you heard of some public

79
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,230
event go along and asked Gordon Brown

80
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,670
questions or is this giving special

81
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,470
access I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's in your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

82
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,690
home it gives you a much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

83
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,920
opportunity I mean if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a</font>

84
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,050
letter early you know that you send that

85
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,160
letter so if you don't hear a response

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,110
no one's going to know but if there's a

87
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,150
lot of questions and the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular</font>

88
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,620
ones are there and they haven't been

89
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,560
answered once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it exposes him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,110
and what are you hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from I</font>

91
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean at the end of this process what do</font>

92
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,730
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results gonna be I just</font>

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,650
