why do we think procrastination is a bad thing we didn't used to if you go back to ancient Egypt there are actually two different verbs for procrastination one was kind of like I'm lazy I don't really want to do this but the other was waiting for the right time I think the idea of delaying is something that we all need to be comfortable with because you can't rush creativity Steve Jobs is a big procrastinator he was constantly putting things off and sometimes it would drive his design teams or his product team crazy the time Steve Jobs was kind of putting things off that noodling on possibilities was time well spent in letting more divergent ideas come to the table I think we could all probably procrastinate a little bit more strategically I'm not saying you should just put things off forever because then nothing ever gets done but there are lots of ways that pausing in the middle of a project can encourage people to take a step back and reevaluate is there another direction that might work for this
