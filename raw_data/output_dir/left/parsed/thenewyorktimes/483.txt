Well, as I understand, I'm
Cassius Marcellus Clay the sixth.
And my great, great grandfather
was a Kentucky slave, and
he was named after some great Kentuckian.
Cassius Marcellus Clay is
a great name in Kentucky.
And really, where he was from,
where it was all originated,
I couldn't tell you, but since I reached
a little fame in boxing most people want
to know where I'm from and
where did I get that name.
I haven't really checked on it, so I see
that I am going to to have to go looking.
>> You will have to look it up.
>> See what it's all about now that
I'm getting little interviews.
>> He was born Cassius Clay, became
Muhammad Ali, and is widely hailed as one
of the greatest and most influential
athletes of the 20th century.
The three time heavyweight champion
possessed unrivaled speed and
agility inside the ring and an unmatched
wit and charisma outside of it.
>> Better thou art to die then
to come down an Uncle Tom and
try making peace just to live a lie!
>> He would come to be celebrated all
over the world, a symbol of tolerance and
understanding, but was militant and
confrontational in his youth.
>> Brother young man, you are brother.
>> His first title bout came from 1964.
Few thought he had much of a chance.
>> I predict tonight somebody will die at
ringside from shock!
>> In 1964, the champion was Sonny Liston.
And he was absolutely unbeatable.
Cassius Clay was the seven
to one underdog.
The New York Times sent me down
there with these instructions.
As soon as I got to Miami,
rent a car, drive back and
forth between the arena where
the fight was going to be held and
the nearest hospitals, so I would waste no
time following Cassius Clay into intensive care.
>> Clay dominated the fight
he eluded Liston's fists and
by the sixth round he was hitting
the champion virtually at will.
>> I think that they feel that Clay had
all the confidence he needed to go on and
defeat Sonny.
>> When Liston didn't answer the bell for
the seventh round,
Clay became the Heavy Weight Champion
of the World.
It was clear from the very beginning that
Clay was going to be a different kind of
champion, brash, outspoken.
>> Don't have a mark on my face,
and I upset Sonny Liston, and
I just turned 22 years old.
I must be the greatest.
>> Soon after his victory,
he joined the Nation of Islam and
changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
But many people and
many publications, including The New York
Times, continued to call him Cassius.
>> I said, "Listen, I feel sorry about
this, but this is out of my control."
And he patted me on the head and
said, "Don't worry,
you're just a little brother of
the white power structure." 
>> Some asked if he might
officially change it,
as a reporter did in this press
conference, captured by KTVU news cameras.
>> Who would have the face?
The judge is what color?
>> I don't know.
>> He's white.
>> Probably.
>> In other words I'd have to ask a white
man may I call myself Mohammad Ali, boss?
>> 
>> He was very sensitive about
my rightful name.
And in several very cool fights, one with
Floyd Patterson, one with Earnie Terrell.
He taunted them, didn't knocked him out
when he could have, because he wanted
to inflict more punishment because they
insisted on calling him Cassius Clay.
>>Floyd dreamed he beat me, he'd apologized.
He'd rather run through hell
with a gasoline smoke coat.
>> He tortured Floyd.
It was like a little boy picking
the wings off a butterfly.
And he would just kind of bunch Floyd,
step back.
>> After Patterson, Ali defeated
George Chuvalo in March 1966 and
then Henry Cooper in
a six round TKO in May.
>> He knocked out Brian London
in only three rounds in August.
Beat Carl Millenburger in
12 rounds in September and
defeated Cleveland Waynes in a three
round technical knockout in November
in what many experts consider to be the most
dominant performance in Ali's career.
Four months later in an interview
with Howard Kosell on ABC Sports,
Ali almost came to blows
with Ernie Truell.
>> That's what you are often times!
>> Why you gonna call me?
>> You heard me!
>> Ernie Truell.
Somehow got boxed into standing up for
the establishment.
>> Back off of me man.
>> And that was another terrible and
ugly fight.
This was for the mean and cruel streak.
>> Farell would not call him by his name.
He always called him Cassius.
And so, he just punished him.
He was like, what's my name?
>> Said he'll humiliate him.
I hardly think it's necessary.
Don't you agree, Joe?
>> I don't.
I don't know about that.
>> I think Clay can do what
he want to do in the ring.
>> Finally in March 1967,
Ali defeated Zora Folley.
He had won 29 fights in six and
a half years,
one of the most extraordinary runs
in heavyweight boxing history.
Although he didn't know it at the time,
it would be three and
a half years before he fought again.
When Ali refuse induction
into the Armed Forces,
the State Boxing Commission suspended
him and stripped him of his title.
>> The country was pulling apart and
he's caught right in the middle of it.
There's wave after wave of TV reporter,
radio reporter.
They all came, you know in a few minutes
you're gonna be in the front lines.
And then black Muslims would come and
they'd say,
"Some cracker sergeant gonna drop
a hand grenade down into your pants."
He was wild and he was exasperated.
And late in evening,
I remember standing there.
But in the evening, the last radio
reporter comes and he goes, "So champ,
how do you feel about being
reclassified and going to Vietnam?"
And he said, "I ain't got
nothing against them Viet Cong."
The phrase was refined.
"I've got no quarrel
against them Viet Cong.
No Viet Cong ever called me nigger."
He refused to step forward to be drafted.
He was stripped of his title,
but he stood firm.
>> The heavyweight champion of
the world is telling people,
that you can take my belt,
you can take my championship.
And that introduced a lot to courage,
to honour, to valor, it's not just
about running fast, jumping high.
But what do you stand for?
What are your morals?
What are your principles?
What stand will you take?
What are you willing to risk?
>> So for the next three and
a half years he couldn't fight.
And he had to make a living
mostly by speaking engagements
on college campuses and
in the beginning he was terrible.
>> First of all,
I would like to thank the student
government body for inviting me here.
>> In the course of that, in the Q and
A's after, as they asked him political
questions he would begin to understand
the main threads of American life.
>> You my opposer when I want justice.
You my opposer on inequality.
You want me to stand up for and America
for my religious beliefs and you want me
to go somewhere and fight, but you won't
even stand up for me here at home.
And by the end of those three and
a half years, he became a principled man,
and that really became his
importance in America.
>> My conscience won't let
me go shoot some poor,
hungry people in the mud for big powerful
America and shoot them for what?
They never called me nigger.
They never lynched me.
They didn't put no dogs on me.
They never robbed me of my nationality.
Shoot them for what?
I'm not gonna shoot them.
Of all the black people no babies and
children, women.
How can I shoot them poor people?
Just take me to jail.
Ali won his first appeal In 1970 when
a federal court upheld his bid for
a state license.
He quickly got back to work,
beating Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena.
His chance to reclaim his titles
came in March of 1971 against
his old friend Joe Frazier.
It was dubbed The Fight of the Century.
>> Today, now 40 years later,
a lot of people, because of their
love of Ali,
think Ali probably won that fight.
Joe Frazier beat him up, and
I can remember him saying
when a man gets me going, that's a real
punch, and when he knocks me down,
that's a real punch, and
Joe Frazier had knocked him down.
And in a way, I'm part of that knock down.
If you look past Ali, you'll see three
gentleman from The New York Times.
Arthur Daley, Bob Lipsyte and myself.
And the way you can find me
is I had a pen in my mouth.
In the photo, it looks like a mustache.
Trust me, it was a pen.
>> It was Ali's first professional loss.
Even though the decision was undisputed,
he continued to talk trash
about Joe Frazer every chance he got,
wherever he was.
 Are you Joe Frazier's nephew?
Is he related to you?
>> Yeah.
>> This boy is pretty,
this boy ain't ugly.
>> Ali defeated dethroned
Joe Frazier in January 1974, but
his next championship bout wasn't until
ten months later, when he squared
off against George Forman in a match in
Zaire, dubbed the Rumble in the Jungle.
>> Most people, including myself
though Foreman would demolish him.
There were 60,000 people in a soccer
stadium yelling Ali boomaye.
What that meant was, Ali kill him.
>> Woo, I would give my soul and
my spirit,
100,000 African brothers
yelling Ali boomaye.
And I'm a 
>> Ali had told them that Foreman was
a Belgian.
He wasn't of course.
But when they told him that, they wanted
to believe Foreman was the enemy.
>> That fight was just masterful.
He just blew Foreman's mind.
He completely, as much as one competitor
could completely turn someone inside out.
Ali had completely turned
Foreman inside out.
>> He backed off into the ropes and
he let Foreman pummel him and
Foreman just smashed his ribs and
everything.
And finally,
Foreman just kinda punched himself out.
And Ali threw a right hand in
the 8th round I looked up and
Foreman spun and went down and
just had no energy to get up.
It was three years after
he had lost to Frazier, and
now suddenly everybody loved him.
That's sports,
that's the way it works sometimes.
>> 
>> Only few months later,
he found himself abroad again.
This time in Malaysia,
to defend his title against Joe Bugner.
>> They had never had a heavy weight
title fight in Kuala Lumpur and they were
making a big thing out of everything,
including the selection of the gloves.
They brought them in on a pillow,
each fighter tried on his gloves and
everything.
And then after  all the selection,
they put them back in the boxes.
And then they sealed it.
They sealed the boxes
with wax from a candle.
And they literally were going to put
them in a safe inside a jail cell and
padlock the cell so
nobody could tamper with the gloves.
And Ali said, "The gloves are going to jail?
The gloves are going to jail?
The gloves ain't done nothing—yet."
>> Muhammad Ali was fun to be around.
He was entertainment, he was a pleaser.
I remember once he had done an exhibition
in Florida on a field on a makeshift rink.
His dressing room was
a recreational vehicle.
After his exhibition he went back to
the recreational vehicle and
shooed everybody out.
Looked around the crowd picked
out three cute young women,
brought them in,
sent two of them out, door closed and
the rec vehicle began
to shake back and forth.
The trainer, the PR guy, his masseuse,
everybody said no, this is off the record.
Don't ever write about it because
you'll never talk to him again.
But I figured,
he has hundreds of people
in these fields standing
around who had seen this.
This is a public event.
How could you not write about it?
So, that's how ended
The New York Times magazine piece.
And the editors put the headline on it,
King of All Kings, because
he had refered to himself somewhere
along the way as King of All Kings.
So now it's six months later and
they send me down to the movie set of
The Greatest, his faux autobiography.
The moment I got there I heard,
"Bob!" and he came running over and
he grabbed me and said,
"King of all kings, you got that right!"
He did have this grandiosity about him.
And he was a narcissist.
And I think there were some dark
parts of him which  can't avoid.
Perhaps the darkest was a kind
of vicious attack on Joe Frazier.
Calling him an Uncle Tom.
Calling him a gorilla.
"I will beat the gorilla in
the Thrilla in Manilla."
And later on ascribing all of
this to a kind of beating the drum
for the box office.
Well somehow that's even worse.
>> He's Uncle Tom.
>> Why do you say that?
>> Just don't call him Clay.
Call him Uncle Tom.
>> Frazier supported
Ali's stance on Vietnam.
He even lent him money
when Ali wasn't fighting.
But what started as a friendly rivalry
in the ring became something altogether
different.
Frasier was hurt and angry when they faced
off for the third time in the Philippines.
>> God, it had to be a hundred
degrees in that arena.
And it was a brutal fight, brutal.
I mean, I'd call it an epic
in brutality and it was.
I mean you couldn't,
It was never a slow movement.
I mean the punches were brutal.
And also, by that time four years
after the first fight in the Garden.
They were older and slower.
They really couldn't get
out of each other's way.
So every punch landed.
It was stopped in the 15th
round by Joe Frazier's trainer.
Because his left eye had been closing.
He couldn't see Ali's
right hand punches coming.
So he stopped it.
Even though he thought Frazier was ahead, he stopped the fight because he didn't
want Joe to get hurt.
One of the first questions,
if not the first,
someone said to him,
what was it like in that ring?
I'll never forget, all Ali said
was, "It was next to death."
>> Frazier lost to Forman again and
then retired.
Ali fought ten more times,
defeating Coopman, Young,
Dunn, Norton, Evangelista, Shavers.
He lost his title to Leon Spinks in 1978,
won it back later that year and
lost it for
the last time to Larry Holmes in 1980.
>> Larry, I'd like you to
explain why you've been crying.
>> You know I really
respect Ali a whole lot.
>> It hurt you to punish
him that way, didn't it?
>> But still Ali fought on.
He finally retired after losing
to Trevor Berbick a little
over a month before his 40th birthday.
Two years later,
Dave Anderson caught up with him
before Ali left on a goodwill tour.
>> He was probably a few pounds heavy.
So he was going through some training.
He just liked training, but
something to get the weight off.
That was the first time I noticed
that he was slurring his words.
and as we all know that got worse and
worse and worse and worse.
I mean its been a terrible,
terrible scene for years with Muhammad.
>> Ali's decline was as rapid as it was
dramatic. He appeared in public less and
less frequently as time went on, but
despite his obvious difficulty
days he never lost his spark.
>> I think he's an enormously
interesting character.
I think that he may have been
the greatest fighter we've ever seen.
I think that he's an amazing
window on a historical period.
As a human being that I knew and
travelled with, I loved him.
There were things about him I hated, but
I loved him as a human being and
he was pure fun.
>> I saw him at the olympics at Sydney
Australia and by this time the Parkinson's
had begun to ravish him
>> But I remember meeting
him at some little event and
there was again just a small gathering.
And so, I introduced myself,
reintroduced myself to him and
I said, he said, by this time he
started he said, what's your name?
And so, I said my name is Bill Rhoades.
No, no, no.
What's your real name?
>> I never told you my real
name was Cassius Clay.
My name is Muhammad Ali, and
you will announce it right there
in the center of that lane!
You must listen to me!
I am the king of the world!
>> Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
You're not that privileged.
>> That's my best man.
I'm king of the world!
I'm king of the world!
>> King of the world!
