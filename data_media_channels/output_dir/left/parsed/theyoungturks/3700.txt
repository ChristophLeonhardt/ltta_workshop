>>HEALTH SECRETARY TOM PRICE HAS
RESIGNED.
>>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM!
DOWN GOES PRICE, DOWN GOES
PRICE!
>>HE RESIGNED ABOUT AN HOUR
AFTER DONALD TRUMP DRESSED HIM
DOWN.
TAKE A LOOK.
>>HE'S A VERY FINE MAN BUT WE
WILL MAKE A DECISION SOMETIME
TONIGHT, HE'S A VERY, VERY FINE
MAN.
WE HAVE GREAT SECRETARIES,
AND SOME THAT ON THEIR OWN
PLANES AS YOU KNOW, AND THAT
SOLVES THAT.
BUT WE PUT IN AN
ORDER WITH NO MORE PLANES, IF
YOU LOOK AT PAST
ADMINISTRATIONS, FOR INSTANCE
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TAKE A
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY
SPENT IN THE AIR, THEY SPENT A
LOT OF TIME IN THE AIR.
BUT I
FELT VERY BADLY BECAUSE
SECRETARY PRICE IS A GOOD MAN
BUT WE ARE LOOKING INTO
IT VERY STRONGLY.
WE WILL TAKE A LOOK, I'LL BE
ANNOUNCING SOMETHING IN THE
NEAR FUTURE.
>>UNBELIEVABLE.
>>WE ARE LOOKING INTO IT VERY
STRONGLY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>>QUIET, I'M LOOKING INTO IT!
>>REALLY STRONGLY!
THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SPENT A LOT OF
TIME IN THE AIR.
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?
>>IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SPENT A LOT
OF TIME IN THE AIR.
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT, NO ONE
HAS.
>>THAT MEANS THEY DIDN'T USE
PRIVATE PLANES BUT THEY HAD TO
TRAVEL BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR THE
GOVERNMENT, THEY SPENT A LOT OF
TIME IN THE AIR.
WE HAVE A LOT
OF GOOD SECRETARIES.
>>I CAN'T.
>>YOU VOTED FOR THIS GUY.
>>ALSO, AS HE SAID, I'LL
PROBABLY BE SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE
ORDER -- MAY BE, I MIGHT SIGN AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER.
HEY MAN, LET US
KNOW WHEN YOU DO.
I MIGHT BE
DOING A LOT OF THINGS TODAY.
BUT
IF I DO, I WILL TELL YOU. AND
HERE AGAIN -- DON'T TELL US YOU
ARE GOING TO DECIDE ON TOM PRICE
TONIGHT.
DECIDE, AND LET US
KNOW, IT'S A SIMPLE PROCESS.
>>NORMALLY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
CONSIDERED INCREDIBLY
UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE
LEAVING THE GUY TO DIE OUT
THERE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M GOING
TO DECIDE, THAT'S CRAZY.
MAKE A
DECISION BEFORE YOU GO PUBLIC
BECAUSE IF YOU GO PUBLIC IT
LOOKS TERRIBLE.
NOT ONLY FOR TOM
PRICE BUT FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU
LOOK SO DISORGANIZED.
>>WEAK.
>>HE IS SO USED TO LOOKING LIKE
A CLOWN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE
RED NOSE?
DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE
SAID ABOUT PUERTO RICO?
PUERTO
RICO, TURNS OUT IT'S AN ISLAND
SURROUNDED BY WATER.
BIG WATER.
I SWEAR TO GOD HE SAID BIG
WATER.
OCEAN WATER.
WHAT OTHER
KIND OF WATER WOULD YOU BE
SURROUNDED BY IN PUERTO RICO?
>>WHEN HE MADE THOSE STATEMENTS
ABOUT PUERTO RICO BEING AN
ISLAND THAT IS SURROUNDED BY
WATER, I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF
HOW MUCH CRAP SARAH PALIN GOT
WHEN SHE TOLD KATIE COURIC SHE
COULD SEE RUSSIA FROM HER HOUSE.
I MEAN, WE HAVE DEVOLVED AS A
COUNTRY.
AT LEAST DURING THE
SARAH PALIN DAYS THERE WAS JUST
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT
THAT'S KIND OF UNACCEPTABLE.
BUT
NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS
THINGS LIKE PUERTO RICO IS AN
ISLAND SURROUNDED BY BIG WATER.
>>THREE STRAIGHT ELECTIONS, I
FORGOT ABOUT PALIN -- TAKE
STOCK.
GEORGE W. BUSH, SARAH
PALIN, DONALD TRUMP.
>>YOU ARE THE DUMB PARTY.
>>THERE ARE SMART GUYS WHO ARE
REPUBLICANS WHO WE DISAGREE
WITH, THEY HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW
GOVERNMENT SHOULD SHRINK AND HOW
IT WOULD WORK AFTERWARD.
NOBODY
WOULD SAY JOHN KASICH IS A DUMB
GUY, OR JEB BUSH -- MAYBE SOME
PEOPLE WOULD.
BUT HE WAS
GOVERNOR, HE MADE STUFF WORK, WE
DIDN'T LIKE IT, BUT -- JOHN
HUNTSMAN, THERE ARE TONS.
BUT
YOU GUYS KEEP ELECTING THE
DIMMEST BULBS IN YOUR CLOSET TO
LEAD THE PARTY.
>>THAT GOES TO AN IMPORTANT
POINT, WE WILL GET TO PRESS IN A
SECOND -- IT'S NOT JUST
LEADERSHIP, IT'S THE VOTERS.
YOU
MIGHT FIND THAT MORE OFFENSIVE,
BUT YOU HAD 17 CHOICES IN THAT
PRIMARY AND YOU CHOSE THE
DUMBEST GUY.
YOU COULD HAVE
CHOSEN JOHN MCCAIN IN 2000, BACK
THEN I VOTED FOR HIM, BUT YOU
CHOSE THE DUMB GUY.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT YOU.
>>I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE
COUNTRY, NOT JUST REPUBLICANS,
BUT WE ARE NOT NUMBER ONE, WE
ARE NOT THE BEST COUNTRY.
I LOVE
MY COUNTRY, THIS IS WHERE I WANT
TO LIVE AND I WANTED TO BE GREAT
-- BUT MANY THINGS -- THE IDEA
OF AMERICA IS BY FAR THE BEST
IDEA WE HAVE HAD.
BUT WE KEEP
DOING DUMB THINGS, AND WE
CELEBRATE DUMBNESS, WE CELEBRATE
GUYS WHO WALK AROUND AND PEE
LIKE A DOG AFTER THEY SCORE A
TOUCHDOWN AND WE CELEBRATE
GEORGE W. BUSH AND DONALD
TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND I APOLOGIZE INSTANTLY TO
BUSH FOR INCLUDING HIM IN
THAT SENTENCE.
>>I HAVE TO GET THIS OUT OF THE
WAY, THINK ABOUT THE TYPE OF
RHETORIC YOU HEAR FROM THE RIGHT
IN THE PAST ELECTION IN REGARD
TO EDUCATION.
IN REGARD TO
KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT AND PROVIDING DATA AND
FACTS TO BACK UP YOUR ARGUMENTS.
YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY GET CAST
OFF AS ELITIST, BECAUSE HAVING
EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THE
ARGUMENTS YOU ARE MAKING IS
SOMEHOW A BAD THING THAT MAKES
YOU AN ELITIST, AND THERE WAS
THIS OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF LOGIC
AND REASON AND IT DROVE ME
INSANE.
>>IT'S NOT TEMPORARY, IT'S NOT
A LITTLE THING THAT MADE YOU
INSANE, IT'S THE DIRECTION THE
COUNTRY HAS BEEN GOING FOR YEARS
NOW. AND DEVOS AND --
>>YOU CAN'T CALL HER DEVOS, THAT
SOUNDS TOO COOL.
>>THAT IS AN INSULT TO DEVO,
THEY WERE GREAT BAND.
AND THE
CLOWN WHO IS THE HEAD OF SCIENCE
AT NASA NOW.
THE GUY WITH THE
NINE CHINS.
HE'S DUMB SO I TAKE
BACK THE -- BUT HE'S NOT A
SERIOUS PERSON.
CAN I READ A
COUPLE TWEETS IN REGARD TO
THINGS YOU MENTIONED?
FIRST OF
ALL MICHAEL SHURE, SUBTWEETING
THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET ABOUT BIG
WATER, BIG OCEAN, AND ISLAND
SURROUNDED BY BIG WATER, HE
WROTE "ALWAYS PANDERING TO BIG
WATER."
THAT IS FUNNY, PEOPLE
SHOULD RUN WITH THAT.
AND TODAY
BEFORE TOM PRICE GOT FIRED, TONY
PERKINS FROM THE FAMILY COUNCIL,
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT SECRETARY
PRICE'S ETHICS, IT'S ABOUT
TRYING TO DISCREDIT ONE OF THE
MOST EFFECTIVE SOCIAL
CONSERVATIVES IN WASHINGTON.
NO, IT WAS ABOUT THE ETHICS.
IT WAS SO SCANDALOUS YOU COULD
NOT NOT COVER IT.
>>AS PRIVATE JET TRIPS.
>>PAY $25,000 TO FLY TO
PHILADELPHIA WHEN IN TRAIN COSTS
TWO HOURS AND COSTS $75?
>>I DON'T BUY FOR A SECOND THAT
IT IS OVER THESE CHARTERED
FLIGHTS, I THINK IT HAS EVERY
THING TO DO WITH TRUMP BEING
BITTER ABOUT THE FACT THAT TOM
PRICE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
HEALTHCARE.
BECAUSE THE STORM
EVER CARE ABOUT ETHICS OR
TAXPAYER MONEY GOING TOWARD
RIDICULOUS, LAVISH TRAVEL FOR
HIS CABINET MEMBERS?
HELL NO.
>>WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE HEAR
SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
I SUSPECT IT IS
MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT, BUT THERE
COULD BE SOMETHING TO IT.
TRUMP
WOULDN'T WANT TO FIREPLACE TO
CALL ATTENTION TO HIS FAILURE TO
HEALTHCARE, YOU PICKED A GUY TO
DO IT AND HE COULDN'T.
I'M SURE HE'S DISAPPOINTED IN
HEALTHCARE, SO HE HOLDS TOM
PRICE RESPONSIBLE, BUT NOW TOM
PRICE WALKS INTO SOMETHING
AND HE'S LIKE, I CAN FIRE HIM
NOW.
>>THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT REPORTS
THAT NOT ONLY THE THINGS HE SAID
PUBLICLY BUT THAT PRESENTLY
TRUMP IS MEDIC TOM PRICE FOR NOT
GETTING TRUMPCARE PASSED, AND OF
COURSE PUBLICLY HE ONCE JOKED AT
A RALLY, HE POINTED TO PRICE WHO
WAS ON STAGE, HE SAID HE BETTER
GET IT, OTHERWISE I WILL SAY
TOM, YOU'RE FIRED.
>>THAT WAS THE BOY SCOUTS
JAMBOREE.
>>HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE WAS
JOKING, HE DID THIS, LIKE, YOU
KNOW ME.
>>INTERNAL REPORTING INDICATED
HE WASN'T JOKING.
LET'S BREAK
THAT DOWN.
NUMBER ONE, HE'S A
CLOWN, HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
GOVERNMENT WORKS.
SO YOUR
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES SECRETARY IS IMPORTANT,
BUT CAN THEY RALLY THE VOTES
NEEDED IN THE SENATE?
IT'S NOT
EXACTLY THE RIGHT -- FIRST OF
ALL THEY CAN'T DO IT
UNILATERALLY, OF COURSE NOT,
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.
YOU HAVE
THE VOTES OR YOU DON'T. CAN THEY
CRAFT LEGISLATION?
NOT REALLY.
AND IF ANYONE WILL TWIST ARMS TO
GET VOTES, WHAT POWER DOES THE
GUY AT HHS HAVE?
IT'S EITHER THE
PRESIDENT OR MITCH MCCONNELL
THAT GETS IT DONE OR DOESN'T. SO
TO WEIRDLY BLAME YOUR HEALTH
SECRETARY, BASICALLY, IS TO
MISUNDERSTAND THE PROCESS.
IF I
HAVE A BAD DAY ON AIR I WON'T
TURN TO THE ACCOUNTANT AND GO
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO A BETTER
TALKSHOW?
IF YOU SCREWED UP THE ACCOUNTING
I WOULD SAY IT'S HIS FAULT.
>>IT'S ALMOST LIKE REQUIRING THE
ACCOUNTANT TO RAISE MONEY.
HE MANAGES THE MONEY BUT HE
DOESN'T RAISE MONEY.
HE MAKES SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY TO OPERATE AND DON'T
BREAK THE LAW.
>>THAT'S A PERFECT ANALOGY,
THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY BETTER.
THAT IS WHAT DUMB PEOPLE DO WHO
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
ACCOUNTANT DOES.
THE ACCOUNTANT
TRACKS THE MONEY, HE DOESN'T
RAISE MONEY.
THE SECRETARY OF
HHS DOESN'T DO A WHIP COUNT IN
CONGRESS AND PASS A BILL, HE
APPLIES THAT ONCE IT PASSES.
IT'S HIS JOB TO MAKE SURE IT IS
APPLIED RIGHT.
COULD THEY HAVE A
SMALL ROLE IN WHIPPING PEOPLE,
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE CAME FROM
THE HOUSE, MAYBE A LITTLE.
>>ONE OF THE REASONS TRUMP
PICKED SO MANY PEOPLE FROM
CONGRESS IF HE WAS HOPING THAT
WOULD SORT OF HAVE SOME SORT OF
SVENGALI-LIKE EFFECT ON THEIR
ABILITY TO PERSUADE THEIR
COLLEAGUES.
BUT TOM PRICE WAS IN
THE HOUSE AND HAS NO SWAY IN THE
SENATE.
IF HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED
IN CRAFTING THE HEALTHCARE
LEGISLATION, HE IS AN ORTHOPEDIC
PHYSICIAN, COULD HE HAVE HAD
SOME ROLE THERE?
BUT HE DOESN'T
BECAUSE ALL THEY WANTED TO DO
WAS REPEAL OBAMA CARE.
THE RIGHT
CLAIMS OBAMACARE WAS RAMMED
THROUGH BUT THERE WERE 18 MONTHS
OF HEARINGS, IT WASN'T RAMMED
THROUGH.
IT DIDN'T PASS WITH
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT BUT IT WASN'T
RAMMED THROUGH.
THESE WERE
RAMMED THROUGH WITHOUT HAVING
ANY LEGISLATION, THEY FIRED BILL
AFTER BILL, THEY ARE LITTLE
TRICKS DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU
THINK THEY ARE PASSING SOMETHING
WHEN ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS
REPEAL.
SO EVEN THE IDEA THAT
TOM PRICE COULD HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN CRAFTING
LEGISLATION, THERE WAS NO
LEGISLATION.
AND WHAT TOM PRICE
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE IN WAS
IMPLEMENTING WHATEVER LAW YOU
PASSED.
>>AND FINALLY A SECOND
MISUNDERSTANDING HERE IS OK, HE
SPENT $400,000 ON AIRPLANES AND
HE SAID DON'T WORRY, I WILL GIVE
YOU BACK A LITTLE LESS THAN
52,000
FOR THE PRICE OF MY SEAT ON A
PLANE.
>>A BUSINESS CLASS TICKET.
>>TO BE FAIR TO TOM PRICE I
DON'T KNOW THAT HE HAS
$400,000, AND ALL HE CARES ABOUT
IS MONEY.
>>HE WAS WORTH $14 MILLION.
AS
YOU MIGHT IMAGINE HE IS ONE OF
THE MORE POOR MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S
CABINET BUT HE'S WORTH 14
MILLION.
>>DRAIN THE SWAMP.
>>HOW HE IS NOT A CRIMINAL I
DON'T QUITE KNOW.
HE ADVOCATED LEGISLATION TO
BOOST COMPANIES THAT HE HAD
A PERSONAL INVESTMENT IN.
>>THAT'S PARTLY WHAT I WAS
GETTING AT, THEY TALK ABOUT
DRAIN THE SWAMP, WASTING
GOVERNMENT RESOURCES, THEY CLAIM
TRUMP WAS MAD ABOUT THAT AND
ELITES ARE GOING AROUND IN
PRIVATE PLANES, THAT'S NOT
DRAINING THE SWAMP -- NO, THERE
ARE MUCH BIGGER PROBLEMS WITH
DRAINING THE SWAMP.
TOM PRICE IN
ESSENCE DID INSIDER TRADING WITH
INFORMATION HE HAD AS A
CONGRESSMAN THAT THE REST OF US
DIDN'T HAVE, THEY HAD TO PASS A
WHOLE LOT TO MAKE SURE YOU
COULDN'T KEEP DOING WHAT TOM
PRICE WAS CONSISTENTLY DOING IN
THE HOUSE.
I'VE GOT SOME
INFORMATION YOU DON'T KNOW, I
WILL TRADE ON THAT.
THAT'S PART
OF HOW HE MADE THE MONEY, THAT'S
THE SWAMP.
TRUMP NEW THAT WHEN
HE SELECTED PRICE, SO THIS IS A
MOLEHILL COMPARED TO THE
MOUNTAIN OF CORRUPT DEALINGS TOM
PRICE HAD IN THE PAST WHICH
TRUMP LOVED.
THAT'S SAVVY, WAY
TO CHEAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
AND TALK ABOUT SAVING MONEY OR
NOT, 400,000 IS TERRIBLE AND HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT
TRUMP TODAY ANNOUNCED A BILL
THAT WOULD COST US TRILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, THOSE ARE TAX CUTS THAT
WILL GO TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN
THE COUNTRY, TO CORPORATIONS WHO
ARE TRUMP'S DONORS,
THAT'S THE SWAMP.
TRILLIONS, NOT THAT 400,000 ON
THE PLANE.
