and I don't frankly have time for total
political correctness
I think when I take someone to the
operating room I'm actually operating on
the thing that makes them who they are
the skin doesn't make them who they are
if I'm our nominee how was Hillary
Clinton gonna lecture me about living
paycheck to paycheck
I was raised paycheck to paycheck
I love my brother I love my dad but I'm
my own man and my views are shaped by my
own thing
we'll kill the terrorist will repeal
Obamacare and we will defend the
Constitution every single word when you
challenge the status quo you make
enemies I made a few Steve Jobs told me
that when he called me the day I was
fired to say hey been there done that
twice
it's time that we recognize the Supreme
Court is not the Supreme Being look I
don't want my marriage or my guns
registered in Washington
we need to give everybody a chance treat
everybody with respect and let them
share in this great American dream I am
a Republican in New Jersey I wake up
every morning as an outsider
