1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
“There is a viable opposition
to the rule of the ayatollahs.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,150
And that opposition is
centered in this room today.”

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,800
That’s John Bolton.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,410
He’s speaking at
the annual gathering

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,330
of an Iranian dissident group

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,030
known as the Mujahedeen Khalq,
or the M.E.K.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,020
Bolton has long been
vehemently opposed

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,870
to the Iran nuclear deal

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,660
and to having dialogue
with the Iranian government.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,420
“The behavior and the
objectives of the regime

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,080
are not going to change.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,160
And therefore, the only solution
is to change the regime itself.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,710
And that’s why, before 2019,

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,560
we here will
celebrate in Tehran.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,690
Thank you very much.”

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,330
Bolton believes the M.E.K.
is a viable alternative

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,040
to Iran’s government.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,630
So what is the M.E.K.?

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,880
It’s a dissident group
and its primary mission

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,370
is to overthrow
the regime in Iran.

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,710
A 2011 State Department
estimate said

22
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,110
the group had between
5,000 to 13,000 members.

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,750
Most M.E.K. members
are Iranian exiles

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,610
living in Europe and the U.S.

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,800
Many experts believe
it has little support

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,140
inside Iran itself.

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,850
They often stage demonstrations
against Iran’s human rights record

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,920
and its cleric-run state.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,850
It’s often described as a cult.

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,870
The U.S. State Department says
it calls for forcing spouses

31
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,710
to divorce and weekly
ideological cleansing sessions.

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,180
It was led by Massoud Rajavi,
but he’s been missing since 2003,

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,010
and so his wife, Maryam Rajavi,
has become the de facto leader.

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,108
Until 2012, the United States 
considered it a terrorist organization.

35
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:03,260
M.E.K.’s tactics have
shifted over the years.

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,520
But it has been known to use
violence to achieve its goals.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,300
M.E.K. started in Iran
in the 1960s.

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,050
In the 1970s, it carried out
anti-regime activities

39
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,710
against the shah,

40
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,330
right up until the
Islamic Revolution in 1979.

41
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,810
And then, it targeted

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,160
Ayatollah Khomeini’s
government, too.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,870
But it didn’t stop there.

44
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,910
During this time it
was also suspected

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,910
to be behind the
assassination of six Americans

46
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,670
and the bombings of
American companies in Iran.

47
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,740
The group eventually
moved to Iraq

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,220
and tried to destabilize the
Iranian regime from there.

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,240
But after Saddam Hussein was toppled,

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,500
the country grew too
dangerous for them,

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,060
even with U.S. troops present.

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,080
“M.E.K. was still a pretty
undesirable group.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,440
But we did not want to watch
it be slaughtered in Iraq.”

54
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,130
Today, Bolton isn’t
the only public figure

55
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,350
to find common
cause with the M.E.K.

56
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,560
Rudy Giuliani,
former D.N.C. chair Ed Rendell

57
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,230
and Trump Transportation
Secretary Elaine Chao

58
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,920
have spoken at or attended
M.E.K.’s national conference.

59
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,140
The group also has an
aggressive lobbying arm

60
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,840
and seems to have
deep pockets.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,980
“The amusing thing
is that the M.E.K.

62
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,190
will try to buy
pretty much anyone:

63
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,696
You know, I was approached
to do events

64
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:23,806
in support of the M.E.K.

65
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:26,280
I know a number of other
former government officials

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,560
who found them
truly detestable

67
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
also were approached.

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,550
You know,
it’s really something

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,065
to have someone
on the phone offering you

70
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:36,130
$15,000 or $20,000 to appear
at a panel discussion,

71
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,720
because that doesn’t happen
for former diplomats every day.”

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,850
Since he became
national security adviser,

73
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,970
Bolton hasn’t said who he’d like
to see take over in Iran.

74
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,040
But if past statements
are any guide,

75
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,110
M.E.K’s most powerful advocate

76
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,950
is now within earshot
of the president.

77
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,730
“I have said for over 10 years
since coming to these events

78
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,930
that the declared policy of
the United States of America

79
00:04:01,930 --> 00:00:00,000
should be the overthrow of
the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.”
