many years ago when I first got out of college I moved in with my then girlfriend my now wife into a tiny little apartment on it in a beautiful block on the west side of Manhattan we lived in a brownstone narrow street you were looking right into the windows of the brownstone across the street and after we had lived there a while a young couple moved into the building right across from us and they had the kind of strange habit of making love right next to the window with the sash open with the wind curtains open and they were incredibly attractive prepare and it was riveting because it was right you couldn't you could not miss it I mean you when people came over to visit you have to close the blinds because you couldn't help but see them having sex right across the window and I I was watching them one day and I turned to my my girlfriend and I said this is what I can't believe the things these people do it's pornographic and she looked out and she said well they're only doing what we do everybody does that we all do the same things you know we do all those things and I realized suddenly that when you look at sex from the outside it's pornographic but when you experience from the inside it's not pornographic at all usually it's quite meaningful and full of depth and full of interest and just full pleasure and all kinds of internal experiences and this is why I believe Alfred Hitchcock believed there were two things that you should never film you should never film people praying and you should never film people having sex and he never quite said this explicitly but I always thought the reason he said that is because the outer depiction of those things is not what's going on Hollywood has used sex to represent love or represent commitment and represent all the kinds of things that it does in a story but that is accustomed us to the idea that sex itself is just the actions themselves are meaningful when of course they're not it's what happens internally which is true of all the important things of life it's really what happens inside you that is giving it meaning and purpose and that's what makes it so hard to judge other people's sex lives it's easy to make fun of people when they do something that's strange like dress up in funny costumes or you know do some strange you know thing that doesn't turn you on it's easy to judge them but you do not know what's going on and is why it is always a very good argument to tell people not to judge others in their personal lives none of us really wants to look through the window into somebody else's personal life and that is what has and that argument has been used to completely strip away any sense of sexual morality it's now coming back in the worst way and when I say that I mean in the worst way al franken has resigned after being turned on by all his fellows and not all but most many of his fellow senators and the question now is is what we're watching a political moment or a moral moment or something in between or both trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show well it's possible that something has gone wrong with the cosmos because last weekend I thought was a really good weekend we had that tax bill moving forward with the FBI kind of making a fool of itself the MSM making a fool of itself as they covered the FBI and this week here the non the Clavin filled week that the city of Los Angeles is burning to the ground and you know I'm starting to feel a little bit I'm something feel a little woozy from all the smoke inhalation so I think the only explanation I can think of is another Kingdom I mean we have put out Noel's and I have put out this podcast that you can get on iTunes for free or whatever if you have a I don't know what

say this because I don't give it away but I've been searching for a watch and it is amazing how expensive they are but if you go to movement you will see elegant watches like this one the one I'm wearing right now very clean design very modern design but they just started like 95 bucks where if you went into a department store you'd be looking at 400 to 500 bucks for the same watch but this is two guys they just said to each other we love watches but they shouldn't cost as much as they do so they developed a business model that helps them peddle them at prices you can afford they're VMT I always have to point out that they leave ATS movement but they leave out all the valves M the M T they even leave out a couple of other consonants - it's like we're gathering all these letters and

political site and then join the go forward for so I'll Franken resigned he this happened as I was getting in my car to go to work but Rob got me a cut I have not heard what he said let's listen I should just to set it up I think there are now seven or eight women who say he's grabbed them groped them some kind of thing like this yesterday this dam broke about six women came out six women senators came out and said he should resign and then everyone from Chuck Schumer on on down was just calling for him to step aside it made it impossible really for him to continue without the trust of his fellow senators and this is his speeches the first time I'm hearing you know an important part of the conversation we've been having last few months has been about how men abused their power and privilege to hurt women I am proud that during my time in the Senate I have used my power to be a champion of women and that I've earned a reputation as someone who respects the women I work alongside every day I know there's been a very different picture of me painted over the last few weeks but I know who I really am serving in the United States Senate has been the great honour of my life I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator nothing has brought this honor on on this institution and I am confident that the Ethics Committee would agree nevertheless today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate so basically what he said and I have seen some of the transcript what he said was we should believe women even though these are a pack of lies he didn't cop to anything except grabbing some but but but you know on the right we we are being people are a little suspicious of this sudden turn to sexual morality on the left and it just looks like a political thing they didn't do it to Clinton nobody still is still they haven't thrown Bill Clinton under the bus they're not going to lose a seat because the governor of Minnesota is going to appoint and he's a he's a Democrat and so they're not gonna lose a seat but this does give them a place John Conyers also resigning this does give them a greater moral standing on which to attack Roy Moore and who's running in Alabama so what they're gonna do now I think Brit Hume said they're gonna make Roy Moore the hood ornament Obie and that you know it's it's a it's a clever plan so it doesn't look it doesn't look like morality also the guy was accused he admitted to doing some of these things he was did that dithering thing I don't know why these guys don't either say I did it and I'm sorry or I didn't do it you know one of the other he did that dithering thing where I remember differently it's hard it's hard not to know when you have grabbed somebody by the backside I mean I think that or or tried to force a kiss on them that they didn't want he's also married so if he's been doing this a lot you know it's there's a lot of immoral things but they but the question there really are questions about whether he's broken the law whether he has broken the ethic the of the Senate he's being railroaded and he's being railroaded in order to put the Democrats that doesn't mean is not guilty I'm just saying he's being railroaded without due process to put the democrats in a better position to attack roy more and i have to say that there are some really there are two really interesting articles today about the Roy Moore situation one of them is from in the Wall Street Journal where they say you know it's not hard to see what's going on here they're attacking the Democrats the Democrats are creating a frank and more nightmare for Donald Trump Monday brought mr. Trump's more endorsement followed by commitment of support from the Republican National Committee the next day representative John Conyers stepped down from his House seat so in other words the fact that the the Trump and the RNC did finally back Roy Moore put them in this vulnerable position but Ann Coulter has written a brilliant brilliant column and I just want I want to read part of this she she points out and I think this is fair to say about Roy Moore she says one of the accusers the one who accused Moore of being violent with her has been called the liar by her own stepson who says he's voting for more and another neglected to mention that Moore sent her brother to prison in defense of one of Moore's accusers Gloria Allred produced a yearbook allegedly signed by Moore apparently in two different inks and giving his title as DEA he was not the district attorney and didn't sign his name that way Allred refuses to produce the yearbook for handwriting analysis contrary to what you have heard and this is the point that sticks with me contrary to what you have heard 1 million times a day on TV there aren't multiple accusers there are two and that's including the one with the fishy yearbook inscription whose step son says she's lying the other accusers claimed he dated them when they were 16 to 19 years old and Moore was in his early 30s or as we pointed out you know one of the things is I always point out things too early because I'm always the first person to point them out and then other people get the credit here's and picking up that point that I made the first day Moore was younger than Jerry Seinfeld was at 39 when he dated seventeen-year-old Shoshana lonstein and got on the cover I think it was People magazine or oz okay she says that would also make more 15 years younger than Bill Clinton when he had a 22 year old in turn performing oral sex on him in the Oval Office Moore's date accusers say he did nothing more than kissed them so in other words legal dating 60 the age of consent in Alabama and it didn't get very far it may be creepy but it's not illegal and maybe it's not for us to judge this is Ann Coulter the media throw the dating claims in with the molestation claims I have made this point to and she's absolutely right the media throw the dating claims in with the malla station claims so they can keep howling about multiple accusers in fact only two women are alleging anything that if true wouldn't merit national attention in other words a guy runs for the Senate you can say he shouldn't have dated young women but it was legal I mean you and he didn't attack them he kissed them during a date in September 2006 just before the midterm elections the media released oh so now she goes back in time just to remind you of how the media behave and this is the important point because this is something I think we all forget from time to time how very very bad the media is in September 2006 just before the midterm elections the media released GOP congressman Mark Foley's creepy emails to house pages no physical contact was alleged the corpus delicti was that Foley told pages mail pages I believe it was that they looked hot in their soccer shorts the entire GOP was crucified by the media for not having discovered this pedophile in its mist Republican congressman who had never met Foley lost their seats because of the media's timing of the email release more than 20 years earlier a Democrat congressman Jerry studs who had actually had sex with a 17 year old Paige indignantly defied his House censure and proudly stood for re-election his outraged Massachusetts constituents elected him six more times Washington Post columnist Coleman McCarthy denounced the witch-hunt against him saying his critics wanted to torch the congressman for his private life when suds died in 2006 The Washington Post headline on his obituary was Jerry studs gay pioneer in Congress the New York Times headline was Jerry says dies at 69 first openly gay congressman in other words she's saying there's a tremendous double standard the media say the Republicans support more just because they want another GOP vote in the Senate and she says Ann Coulter says I support more just because I hate the media and so and so there are all these questions coming up and how do we how do we judge when it's so difficult to judge other people's sex lives because who wants to enter into their world and pass judgment on another person sex life I don't I don't want to spend a single minute worrying about this let me talk stop for just a moment and talk about life insurance if you are an adult with people who are dependent on you you have two choices either you get life insurance or you hide under the desk in a hazmat suit and hope you outlive your children here at the Andrew Klavan show we recommend the life insurance the hazmat is more expensive and you actually want to do one out with your children the way to get this is through policy genius you don't have to talk to an agent you just policy genius lets you compare life insurance from the top providers online it takes as little as five minutes or if you're busy one minute per day for five days if you find a policy you like and want to know more you can talk to one of their licensed experts but if you're just browsing you don't have to talk to anyone browse away they don't just do life insurance you can get disability insurance renter's insurance pet insurance and compare health insurance you will save money because you can compare it right there if you need life insurance but you've been putting it off try policy genius you can compare life insurance online on your own terms in your own time policy genius.com because you should only be forced to speak to an agent if you're committing a federal crime that's I that's what it just said so good idea here but here's the thing okay one of the things I don't like about Roy Moore is that he's always blaming gay people for things and my because I'm an artist I've worked with lots and lots of gay people I've always gotten along with them not all there were as many bad gay people in my life as there were bad straight people that I guess would be a better way of saying it and I was never any any of my business I've always supported them there to have rights I thought they shouldn't be picked on obviously not bullied and I'm glad that that has come about when when gays wanted marriage I did question whether changing the definition of marriage which it is doing was a good thing I thought to be honest with you I thought marriage hasn't meant what it meant ever since no-fault divorce came in I don't think straight marriage is straight marriage once you have no-fault divorce I think when you're married you should be married unless things are really really desperate especially once you have kids so I a lot of I think that marriage as an institution has been really damaged over the years and the fact that gay people at least wanted to be committed to each other instead of like sleeping with 17 strangers in a you know a bath house I thought was actually a positive thing this case before the Supreme Court where these guys are trying to run a baker out of business because he wouldn't he's a Christian Baker and he wouldn't make a cake for a gay wedding these guys first of all I think gay people should be rising up against these I know they don't they actually go on Facebook and encourage these kinds of lawsuits I think it makes them look terrible I think it's fascist I think it's small I think it's mean I think it stinks and I think it gives validity to guys like Roy Moore when they hid out at the gay community I think it gives them validity because it's a terrible terrible thing to run a small businessman out of business because he won't violate his religious life and I'm gonna get connect these two things in just a minute but first I want you to look one of the gay couples they went in to get a cake for their wedding the guy said look you can I came an artist I cannot put my art into baking a cake for a wedding because I feel that that is against my religion it's against me it's violating my god what what on earth stop them from turning around walking out going to another shop and getting another cake and leaving that man alone they you know it's just it is just fascistic thinking and I want you to listen David Mullins I believe is yeah David Mullins is one of the couple and here he is making a speech outside the Supreme Court as they were arguing the case this isn't about a cake this has never been about a cake and this isn't about weddings it has never been about weddings no this is about freedom freedom for LGBT people to live full lives in public and not in constant fear that they will be denied basic service in businesses fired from their jobs or lose their homes just for who they are when people live in a world where they can legally be turned away they feel rejected they feel unsafe they feel like they don't belong in our society simply for being born different and unless society chooses to embrace their rights some of them will simply choose to remain hidden cut off from the world and who they really are to this day charlie and i's experience at masterpiece cake shop is a persistent memory this is so sinister and so dishonest because of this misuse of the word freedom you don't have a freedom to be loved you don't have a freedom to be liked you don't even have a freedom to be tolerated in the sense that people have to be around you and and approve of what you do that is not freedom you have the freedom to live as you wish you have the freedom to be left alone you have the freedom to go to another cake store if you can't get a cake from this guy but you do not and listen to the cake baker himself Jack Phillips listen to what's happened to him because of this state panel that came up against him because of what he did we've had to surrender our wedding cake business which was 40% of our income I've lost over half my employees and we faced death threats and harassment of all kinds so now we just hope that the court will rule in favor of creative professionals so that I can go back to making the cakes that I that I can according to my conscience and that nobody else will have to endure what we have for the last five years here here's the thing that's really bothering me about this sexual moment they call it a reckoning it's really a reckoning of what happened with Bill Clinton so it's only a reckoning on the left in that sense but here's the thing that is really bothering me first of all I haven't seen any of these gay guys go into a Muslim Baker the only guy who did that was Steve Crowder which was hilarious he went into a Muslim bakery they all turned him down he could have sued any of them if he had wanted to except the wooden very far because he's actually not gay but but they never go into a Muslim Baker which means that this is an attack on Christianity it is an attack on the institution that stands between us and the government representing our conscience has done this throughout Western history I'm not going to go back through that another show I will talk about the long long long history the struggle between the church and the state which goes back all through European history from the like the 12th century on but they are attacking this and this is the right way to establish sexual morality through what would conservatives call mediating institutions it's not people acting in their own self-interest their own political self-interest to railroad Al Franken out of the Senate there's no there's no moral aspect to that this is simply a political move that is being used to get at the other side just in the same way the same way that people supporting Roy Moore in spite of the allegations against him is a political move to keep a vote there's no moral high ground here moral high ground comes in the same way the sexes experience that comes internally it comes from you understanding who you are what you're made for and what your body does and how your body works for and how it works against the person that God made you to be you cannot know what's good until you know what you're for you cannot know whether a leftist tears mug that you would get for subscribing you can't know how wonderful it is unless you know is for drinking leftist tears you cannot know what your body is for unless you know you are a child of God a soul meant to express love through your through your flesh the only way you have to express anything so these guys these homo Nazis and I don't want to tar all gay people because I know all gay people are not like this but these guys are fascists and they are trying to destroy this institution which makes them feel bad if you to what that guy said he wanted the right to feel good about himself he wanted the right to feel good about himself there is no such right in order to feel good about yourself you have to know who you are you have to know what you're for you have to know that you're behaving in a way that serves what you are and what you're for I have never come out against homosexuality either religiously or morally or any other way it's none of my business it's not something I do I and I know so many lovely people who are gay I'm happy for them to live their lives any way they see fit but I'm not happy for them to force me to give them a good sense of themselves that is not freedom that is fascism and I think that was being done to this guy by the way in the court even we don't know how they're gonna decide Anthony Kennedy who's invented this make-believe right to dignity is just as this kind of wild card but even he was saying dignity goes both ways he said in the while they were arguing the case dignity goes both ways and you are not respecting this cake Baker's dignity the way you're expecting him to let's bring on Andy McCarthy because I just I really want to talk to him and I watch hey Andy it's good to see you how are you good I'm really good I'm sorry I only get to see you in Skype now I only get to see what like I'm interviewing you it's ridiculous don't don't don't ask don't tell' let me I haven't introduced you yet let me just say your forms us Assistant Attorney who led and helped convict the 1995 terrorism case against Sheikh Omar Abdel egg first World Trade Center bombing you are also in my opinion the best writer on the mulher investigation and all the legal machinations going every time there's a new development I have to wait for you to turn out the your copy so I know what the hell is going on and this has been well it really is it's really great it's great material let's say NRO right that's where we can find it at National Review Online so let's go over what's been happening let's start with the Flynn plea I really feel that there are now two media media outlets telling us two different stories Sean Hannity is going on with charge to show how everybody is corrupt and it's all a big conspiracy and on the other hand they're basically waiting for the police to perp walk Donald Trump out of the White House and somewhere what does the Flynn guilty plea actually mean as far as your concern well I think through the the bottom line is that there what we're really in now is a obstruction of justice investigation and that the collusion angle that was the auspices under which this thing got kicked off in the first place has probably gone by the board's because we can't look at Flynn in a vacuum it's the third set of charges that Muller has brought and that's why by the way your your dichotomy of these two different approaches is is quite right and we can we can tell from this fact you know whatever the people on both ends of the spectrum say mauler has now issued three sets of charges none of them have anything to do with Donald Trump none of them have anything to do with the 2016 election now it's appropriate I suppose it's perfectly reasonable for some people to say that that shows that this is a whole complete waste of time and they may be vindicated in the end but it also kind of cuts against the idea that you know Muller is going to do whatever he can do to get Donald Trump because III think the way these charges have been constructed and the police have been constructed he may be building toward an obstruction case but he's not doing it the way that you would build a case if you really wanted to get the the big fish in the end so it was if you think about well explain that explain that because on the Left what they're saying is every time there's one of these deals or charges they basically say he's building this pyramid case up to the top that's why the Morning Joe is talking about this all the time well let me explain why that doesn't make sense okay which requires talking a little bit about how federal prosecution works with co-operators so if you're running a big case and you're trying to prove a big scheme and a big scheme that they had here was this Russian espionage operation against the 2016 election and you have an accomplice to the scheme what you would want your dream as a prosecutor is to have the accomplice plead guilty to the scheme because then he comes into open court and he says this happened it was real I'm guilty I did it here's what I did here's what these guys did and then you've you've not only crossed a threshold as far as the public is concerned regarding the credibility of your investigation you've also put enormous pressure on other accomplices to come forward and cooperate and the way federal law works what happens is a good prosecutor makes the accomplice plead guilty to the scheme gets the benefit of that that guilty plea that we just talked about and then you make him earn sentencing leniency so you don't have to sell the case short at the beginning by giving him a plea to a minor count you make him eat the big count and then he's got to tell you everything he knows he has to cooperate and testify in court if you need him to do that and then at the end of all that at the end of the rainbow if he's done everything that you've asked if he's given what the Sentencing Guidelines call substantial assistance to a government investigation then the prosecutor files a motion under the Sentencing Guidelines which allows the judge to sentence the guide to as little as zero okay time served so you make him earn the sentencing when you see you don't give the sentencing leniency at the beginning by by short-selling the case before he's even done anything for you so yeah so when you say was building an obstruction of justice case against who well yeah I think he's the ultimate thing if you're a prosecutor you would never think about indicted the president because as a practical matter prosecution is an executive function the president's the head of the executive branch and he holds all the I don't mean to be cutier but he holds all the trump bars against that yeah because he can pardon everyone he can fire the prosecutor he can pull the plug on the investigation president if a president doesn't want to be indicted or doesn't want to allow himself to be indicted it can't happen so if if you're Muller I think if you're if you're thinking about taking action against Trump the only action that it makes sense to take would be to draft a report of some kind that you dump in Congress's lap for impeachment purposes because it's not gonna ever happen in a Judicial Court okay and there is precedent in the Clinton situation and in the Nixon situation for obstruction of justice being or obstruction of governmental procedures being part of the articles of impeachment seeking to remove those presidents so he's he would be on firm ground in terms of precedent so you think he's nails he's setting up an impeachment charge well I think I don't know that Muller wants to impeach Trump because you know Muller look Muller is a creature of government right I mean he's but he's been in the government for years and years and when he's when he's been out of the government he's been out of the government temporarily to get back in to go so he knows how disruptive to the country and impeachment would be and I hope he realizes I think he realizes that you shouldn't do it unless there's a real good reason to do it not just because of the rupture it is for the country but also because in the house it only requires a simple majority to file articles of impeachment but you have to get a supermajority of two-thirds in the Senate to remove the president right which means the only way the reason we haven't had a president impeach in our history is it has to be something that's so egregious that it cuts across ideological and partisan lines and there's a consensus in the country that the president needs to be removed right that happened with Nixon if he hadn't resigned he would have been impeached but that's the only episode that we've had in in 200 plus years so Mahler thought I know that this is very difficult to do and it won't happen unless it is a real good reason I don't think he wants to I doubt he would want to bring an impeachment case just to bring one to get it torpedo okay in Congress so you know watching this guy struck who's now seems like the Zelig of he seems to turn up everywhere and I was watching the FBI director in front of the in front of Congress this morning there's it just seems impossible not to feel that Hillary Clinton was treated differently than this investigation is treating Trump and his people now you were a federal prosecutor you know these people I've always had all my experiences with prosecutors have been I've always found them to be incredibly honest straightforward people just doing a job but obviously you're gonna get some bad creatures in there present company excepted of course but I mean I can't help looking at this and thinking that maybe sean has a point that the this is their plan with loaded dice here well two things there number one there's no question that Hillary Clinton got the kid gloves treatment and mauler is using some scorched earth tactics approach to the two different investigations is not the same that said I think with struck in particular I want to hold up and wait to see more information I know he seems like Zelly yeah but in every big FBI investigation there's a case agent assigned so there are agents who do like you know tasks that need to be done in the investigation and then there's at least one guy who oversees the whole thing okay and what invariably happens in every one of these big investigations is the case agents name is on everything he's the guy who testifies in the grand jury his name is on all the reports he's at all of the interviews so I don't put too much stock in the fact that with respect to the Hillary investigation his name is all over the place yet of course it should be yeah he's the case a like and I think with respect the Muller investigation if you want to paint struck as some have as a guy who's a pro Hillary anti-trump zealot here's what doesn't make sense to me Comey testified when he was still FBI director in March before the House Intelligence Committee this was reported in the Wall Street Journal earlier earlier this week he testified that the agents who interviewed general Flynn on January 24th believed he was telling the truth he struck is one of those agents he's the guy who evidently ran the interview right so it seems to me that conclusion was that that Flynn lied couldn't have been strikes because according to the FBI director struck reported that he thought Flynn had been honest in the interview there may have been some failures of recollection that were honest but he thought overall he hadn't lied okay and that's they have been countermanded down the road by Muller's very aggressive prosecutors I gather so I'm not sure that we have a completely accurate read on who struck is and I'm look I'm willing to believe that he may be a partisan zealot but other people I talked to tell me he's an exceptional intelligence agent okay and that includes people who like general Flynn and and president Trump a lot so I want to wait to see what these texts say and let's wait to see the rest of the information okay you you wrote a piece if I recall it correctly that we're saying that this is no longer a legal investigation Muller it's a political investigation I I think it was Laura Ingraham was on last night saying that Muller is essentially trying to nullify the election you go to sleep at night are you do you think this guy this Muller is is basically a political agent against Trump I mean does that is that what you're getting out of this or you're not sure well I try to separate ball with the person from from what this enterprise is about this investigation because I think in a lot of ways Muller is our best hope for the investigation I think the investigation is a result of the fact that the Democrats wanted to get a prosecutor assigned to this president right and the the guys that they did it under was this this theory that not only had Russia done an espionage operation against the 2016 election but that Trump or the Trump campaign or Trump associates it's always loosely stated somehow colluded with it and I always thought drew that that was a bunch of nonsense because prosecutors don't care about collusion you and I are colluding by having this conversation collusion is just concerted activity it's not necessarily guilty what prosecutors care about is conspiracy which is an agreement to violate a particular particular law and you could never nail Democrats down or anybody else who was making this case on what exactly it was that they thought that the Trump people had violated or had agreed to violate and that's why they kept following it collusion because they didn't have conspiracy and then when the Justice Department appointed Muller they did it outside the regulations the Justice Department regulations require you to articulate the criminal offenses that need to be investigated and that the Justice Department for some reason or other is conflicted but from carrying out the investigation itself in an ethical manner so therefore you have to get a quasi independent lawyer and to do it what they did instead what Rosen Stein the Deputy Attorney General did was appoint Muller to conduct a counterintelligence investigation targeting Russia and the sidelines was and did Trump have anything to do with what Russia did to the 2016 election and the danger in that is that counterintelligence unlike Criminal Investigation counterintelligence is just an information gathering exercise right you know criminal case has a set transaction it's got a crime it's got essential elements that a prosecutor has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt so it's got like a beginning and an end and it's finite there's nothing finite about a counter intelligence investigation and it's not even lawyer work in the Justice Department counterintelligence cases don't get a prosecutor a song right there's nothing about having a law degree that makes you expert in intelligence analysis so in our government intelligence analysis is done by you know intelligence officers and analysts who were trained in how to do this and the only time a lawyer gets involved is if they have to go to the FISA Court to get a warrant otherwise it's not like a criminal case where the prosecutor really runs the show once the FBI has done the investigation and figures out how to how to present the case so this is a long-winded way of saying a counterintelligence investigation by giving that remit to to mauler what that means is that there's no sensible limitations on what he can look at yes that's what you mean it's all over the place right it's really a fishing expedition all right well I'm out of time I have a million more questions to ask I hope you'll come back and talk again and I actually will get to see you in three dimensions at some point I'd like that Andrew C McCarthy thank you very much anything I'll talk to you soon great to talk to you but really interesting and just you know he understands this the ins and outs of it so much and if you're not reading his stuff at national review online you should be because this this thing where you have one side of the media just literally waiting for Trump to be carried out where you know in handcuffs and the other side Vietnamese conspiracy charge what he said about struck I mean I just haven't heard that anywhere else hey before we get onto stuff I like let us talk about something I really like which is man crazy I don't know about you but when my wife says to me as she often does what do you want for Christmas I always say what's for dinner because I don't know what I want for Christmas but man crates has so many great things they sent me one we will play this video once

was good stuff I can report that I used virtually everything you just saw in that box last night and that a lovely glass of whiskey before going to bed with that I just love a great glass I mean it really it just it just increases the pleasure of it I didn't use these I like those big orbs of ice they're really fun to use but that was the one part I didn't use I could I was drinking it neat but it was it was great it was a great experience really was civilized experience just before going to bed to have a glass of whiskey with my man crates whiskey appreciation thing all right stuff I like last week you know I don't watch very much comedy but last week I told you about this kind of comedy thriller called the search party which I love and right this minute I just happen to be watching two different comedies and I want to bring the other one which is the good place which is by Michael shores created by Michael Schur who did Parks and Rec right which actually has a sympathetic conservative character in it they made him less sympathetic as it goes on because that's what happens as the writer room as the original writers file out and new writers come in they start to make them what happens is they try to make the conservative the bad guy but everybody identifies with them so then they have to really make him the bad guy because otherwise people are gonna love them but I don't know what Michael Schwartz politics are this is about a woman who goes to the good place which is essentially heaven and except she gets him by mistake she's a totally selfish you know trivial individual she has the same name as a really nice person and Ted Danson plays the architect of this particular good place there are many different good places it when it started I was worried it's gonna be anti-christian it's not it's just funny it is just hilariously funny and Ted Danson should be bronzed he I mean you know he started out on shears and I just assumed that that's who he was he was the bartender remember an ex baseball player and I could just assume that that was his character that was cut he was so good he just melted into that character and then I saw him on damages as an evil industrial industrialist and I thought wow he is a terrific actor on this he is absolutely hilarious here he is greeting the new arrivals in heaven and he explains to them the system by which people are sent to either the good or bad place and was so brilliant it is in order for the premise to exist they must have made a mistake so it actually is a points out that every moral system has inherently a flaw if you look at it from a human point of view and and that it requires forgiveness and compassion in order to really have a moral framework it's also very well informed there's a lot of talk about Aristotle a lot of talk about ethics they actually seem to have read the books the actors are all just absolutely hilarious what's what's her name Kristen Bell she is I never knew that she had a just like she was like a cutie pie but she really is talented and funny the whole show is really good all right that's our week except another Kingdom it releases tomorrow at on faith on
