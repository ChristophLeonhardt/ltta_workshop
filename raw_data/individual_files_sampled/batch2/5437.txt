the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee believes his Republican colleagues are setting up Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein to be punished the Washington Post reports that Trump allies mark meadows and Jim Jordan met with Rosen Stein on Monday to press him for more documents concerning the Russia probe and the Clinton email investigation and the White House could be in the loop three sources told the Post that President Trump and meadows spoke at some point after the meeting but they declined to share details of that exchange citing a potential investigation and other classifications DOJ said yesterday it needs more time to evaluate House Republicans requests for James commis memos about meetings with President Trump the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is poised to issue a subpoena for the documents that's according to ranking Democrat Jerry Nadler Nadler said he believes DOJ cannot meet the Republicans demands adding quote I fear the majority will have manufactured an excuse to hold the Deputy Attorney General in contempt of Congress in yesterday's joint news conference with the Japanese prime minister president Trump repeated some of his debunked claims about the probe and said he's been restrained toward the investigators on the Moller probe have you concluded that it's not worth the political fallout to remove either special counsel Muller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein we are giving tremendous amounts of paper this was a really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss which is a loss that frankly they shouldn't have had from the standpoint that it's very easy for them they have a tremendous advantage in the electoral college and this is what it is and this is where it came from you look at the kind of money that was paid probably some went to Russia you look at Podesta having a company in Russia where nothing happened and people don't talk about it you look at the fact that their server the DNC server was never gotten by the FBI why did the FBI take it the FBI takes what they want they go in they wouldn't get the server this is a hoax as far as the investigation nobody has ever been more transfer and then I have instructed our lawyers be totally transparent I believe we've given them 1.4 million pages of documents if you can believe this and haven't used that I know of or for the most part presidential powers are privileged so we are hopefully coming to the end it is a bad thing for our country very very bad thing for our country but there has been no collusion they won't find any collusion it doesn't exist as far as the two gentlemen you told me about they've been saying I'm going to get rid of them for the last three months four months five months and they're still here so we want to get the investigation over with done with put it behind us so he's talking there Casey about Bob Muller and Rod Rosenstein there are a lot of people suspicious now and wondering especially yesterday what Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan are up to and when it comes to rob Rosen's tyne are they trying to put him into a place where they could hold him somehow in contempt of Congress and maybe push them to the side that's the question and I think that this effort has sort of been spreading through the Republican Conference so Devin newness has been the president's kind of primary ally and trying to fight back against this behind the scenes and the fact you've had a couple other chairmen notably the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler warning perhaps they will subpoena these documents it sends a signal that you know frankly House Republican leaders who have said repeatedly publicly the speaker has said this that they want Muller to be able to finish their investigation are to a certain extent losing control of the situation that that this is kind of a snowballing in a way that could basically provide the president an excuse to fire these people and and potentially precipitate a constitutional crisis we've wondered for a long time on this show Josh we're the people who claim the president would never fire Bob Muller are getting the confidence to say that Mitch McConnell's standing in the way of legislation that could protect the special counsel because he says it's just not something the president would do I think they probably thought that about James Comey as well I'm sure they thought that about Jay Ducote yeah but they know look people who are willing to take the president's word for something this important are either foolish or cowardly they either are are in the face of all evidence of the contrary are willing to trust a guy who is Joanie can't be trusted or they're unwilling to stand up to them and it is it's problematic when we're talking about something as fundamental to our Constitution as the rule of law so I don't be overly dramatic about it but what we are seeing from congressional Republicans is that continued march of politicizing our our justice system in a way that is should be troubling to Americans of all political persuasions and there is five partisan legislation that's Thom Tillis others have gotten together with Democrats that said we've got to protect the special counsel yeah and there was enough alarm and I was I think I would put it too and again with the new cycles the way they are I lose track of time but I think it was last Friday that there were a lot of rumors that Rosen Stein was on the verge of being fired and Republicans made a significant push in the Judiciary Committee to put this legislation through the committee Mitch McConnell kind of put the kibosh on it by going out in public and saying no way no how am I putting this on the floor but in one question and we store and I'm curious your take on this I think one thing that that Republicans are hoping is true is that the president learned his lesson from firing James Comey and that that backfired on him so aggressively gave him Muller that that argument is convincing him that he shouldn't make the same mistake again that's normal logic I think it's Fantasyland when you're dealing with Donald Trump and his level of impulsivity and if there's anything that Donald Trump loves to do it's to do exactly what everyone says he can't do which is why I still think there's a significant risk that he is actually going to fire Mahler McConnell's comments in his posture on the legislation and not letting it go to the floor is interesting to me and it really contrasts with how he has let the Senate Intel committee proceed with their investigation well and I also think it's it's potentially contradictory to where his conference is and I think that's gonna be one of the more interesting dynamics to that to play out because you come out of these they have policy lunches every Tuesday these Republicans come out and you hear there's a significant amount of angst about this well yeah look at these primary season is about to be over and they're gonna have to run a lot of Republicans well I mean only eight that's still you know they have to defend their seats and they're gonna have to run as general election candidates and so you look at where the tighter the country is and I think McConnell is frankly out of step with where the electorate is you know at some point someday this is going to end this is going to be over this investigation is going to be over the conclusion at some point someday someday will happen but the largest danger is not existent in Washington today it's existent out in the country where all of this coming at people every day like a firehose of events and scandals and shocking statements happens every day repeatedly during the course of the day as I think many many people anesthetized to the shock of what is happening to our constitutional system of government on a daily basis well I think what I hear a lot out there is call me when it's over I'm you're hearing every twisted turn of the Russian investigation let me know what happens at the end of the movie we're talking about senators describing whether or not they think that Donald Trump might try to find a way to get rid of Bob Muller here's senator Orrin Hatch speaking yesterday about that I don't think so and I don't think anybody's going to I don't think the president's going to be so stupid as to do something like that that's good enough you just the idea that the president wouldn't do this so we don't need to pass it well that's right and we had let the president be the president but I don't think he's about to do that he wouldn't he would take such criticism that it wouldn't be worth it to him the prevailing opinion in the Senate among Republicans Casey I don't know that it's it's certainly the prevailing public view I think privately there's enormous concern I mean and and bob Corker I'm not sure we've we've heard from him yet I hope we will show some of what he said yesterday because he's essentially like look if you're a Republican senator and you don't think this whole thing is off the rails at least to some degree you're not paying any attention but help people at home understand that why would they say that to you privately and then go out in front of cameras and say something entirely different so part of it well a couple things one they all have to run for reelection in their bases with Trump so that's an underlying dynamic but to those smart ones and Orrin Hatch flip this on his head some of the the people of closer relationships with President Trump they would go on TV and say the president is too smart to fire Muller because they don't want him to but they know that flattery can get you to a certain place with this president so when you see Republicans coming out and saying oh our president is way too smart to possibly do anything such as that that's what they're they're trying to send him a message hey don't do that lead with flattery always works with this president still ahead on Morning Joe a former Playboy model is now allowed to speak out Karen McDougal reached a deal with the
