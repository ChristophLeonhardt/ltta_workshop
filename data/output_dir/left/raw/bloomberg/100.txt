1
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Starting today you live here now with me.

2
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,440
Japan has a problem with loneliness.

3
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,500
Almost 70% unmarried men and 60% unmarried women aged 18 to 34

4
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,360
are not in any form of relationship with the opposite sex.

5
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,720
This relationship crisis has spurred a multimillion-dollar virtual romance industry -

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,660
which aims to fill the emotional void through technology.

7
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,080
Meet Minori Takechi, the founder of Gatebox,

8
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,720
a Tokyo-based startup working on an AI-powered device with a virtual character for lonely men.

9
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,440
Takechi’s device can be linked to your smartphone,

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,520
making it possible to create a sense of relationship.

11
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,940
When you’re at work, Hikari might send you messages like “come back home soon”.

12
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,240
But it’s a disturbing vision of a relationship -

13
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,920
allowing users to retreat from human relationships into a fantasy of submission and titillation.

14
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
The dream of creating a virtual companion dates back to Takechi’s childhood.

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,560
At the age of 10, he moved to Malawi in Africa with his mum.

16
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,120
He didn’t speak the local language and made no friends at school,

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,180
so characters from video games and comic books became his fictional friends.

18
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,080
The hologram-like virtual wife is a relic of male-dominated relationships from decades past.

19
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,800
But this hasn't stopped single Japanese men from placing orders.

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,100
Takechi says they’ve got 300 pre-orders for the prototype which has a price tag of $2700.

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,180
Japanese women can also have virtual boyfriends.

22
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,800
Tokyo-listed company Voltage created a Pokemon Go-like augmented reality game

23
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,220
allowing users to take their virtual lovers anywhere.

24
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
In another virtual reality game -

25
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,320
users play a woman sitting in a chair who is auctioned to a rich man called Eisuke.

26
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,680
I’ve bought you. You’re mine.

27
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,060
And here you’re napping.

28
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,920
This unsettling game plays to a female masochist fantasy.

29
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,980
Its theme maybe upsetting to some, but on the streets of Akihabara,

30
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,560
Tokyo’s anime and manga area, no one was squeamish - in fact, they liked it.

31
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,100
Japan is developing virtual companions in different forms.

32
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,160
But all aimed at filling a void of human affection.

33
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,300
But will these virtual companions drive users further away from real human relationships

34
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,320
and complexities that go with them?

35
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,040
You may respond with either yes or okay.

36
00:05:40,020 --> 00:00:00,000
I expect you to keep me entertained.
