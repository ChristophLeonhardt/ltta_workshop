1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,560
This is biathlon.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,970
A timed ski race where you shoot at rifle
ranges along the course.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,080
It’s awesome, but also kind of odd.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,509
There’s no other sport that combines athleticism
and weaponry the same way.

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,100
Although it’s popular in Europe,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,840
most Americans only know it from whatever
James Bond movie that was.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,860
It’s For Your Eyes Only, by the way.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,600
But that’s not the point.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
Biathlon isn’t just a trivia answer,
it’s a competitive professional sport with

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,580
military roots that stretch back centuries.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,860
And it all started in Norway
with a guy named Oscar.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,780
Oscar Wergeland was a Norwegian military officer
who loved skiing.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,280
In 1865 he wrote a book of ski drills for
his troops.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,850
Before then, members of the Swedish and Norwegian border

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,980
patrol had been meeting for contests that
combined skiing with rifle shooting.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,720
But Wergeland’s book turned the mixture
into an official exercise and the idea took off.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,110
Throughout Europe, militaries began building
up their ski troops

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,680
and by World War I, soldiers on both sides
were fighting on skis.

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,460
After the war, the creation of the Winter
Olympics gave ski troops a new purpose.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,990
In 1924, a demonstration of skiing and shooting
was added to the first ever winter Olympics.

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,660
It was called “Military Patrol”
and the participants were soldiers from nations

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,900
attending the games.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,630
The Olympic demonstration continued for a couple of
decades,

24
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,140
But outside of the Olympics, ski warfare continued.

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,260
In 1939,

26
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,620
Finnish ski troops, fought the Russians in in a World War II

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,500
invasion called “The Winter War”.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,740
Finland fights on.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,840
Although they lost the battle, the Finns used
alpine skills, particularly skiing, to inflict

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,080
major losses against the Russians.

31
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,040
As World War II evolved, countries on both
sides saw the success of Finland

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,180
and started creating propaganda for their
own winter warfare battalions.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,780
The US had its own winter unit,
the 10th Mountain division, which prepared

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,880
for conflict in Europe by training on mountains in Colorado

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,020
and Washington State.

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,460
He learns how to wax his skis.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,570
Three years after the war ended, military
patrol

38
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,970
was demonstrated for the last time at the
1948 Olympics in St. Moritz.

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,820
But that didn’t stop amateurs from competing
on their own.

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,980
Civilians began hosting competitions that
combined skiing with shooting and that led

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,170
to a petition for official Olympic recognition.

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,160
In 1960 at Squaw Valley, the sport returned to the Winter Games

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,819
as an official event called “biathlon”.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,000
That was the moment biathlon went from being a Norwegian
military drill to a competitive professional

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,700
sport.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,420
Although rules and headwear have
changed through the 70s, 80s, and 90s,

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,860
modern biathlon is a clear product of its
military origins.

48
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,280
The sport mimics the sharp transition between
physical effort and mental focus experienced

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,760
by soldiers in battle.

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,260
Biathletes shoot when their heart rate is
extremely high, and their breathing can make

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,180
it really difficult to hit five targets in
a row.

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,560
But unlike soldiers, the penalty for modern athletes is only

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:00:00,000
more time or just more skiing.
