00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
hi everyone how's it going some people

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,830
ask me miles why do you have so much

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,870
patience with people and humanity in

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,540
general when there's so many idiots out

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,240
there and destructive people and for me

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,960
it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generally have faith I</font>

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we aren't all</font>

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,480
perfect and we all want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to better</font>

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,060
ourselves in one way or another and even

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">if some people you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know don't seem to be</font>

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,789
wanting to improve themselves is because

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,170
they haven't been shown a better

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,239
alternative so some of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,329
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago I hosted a live game show</font>

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,940
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet called design and it was</font>

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great fun and I did it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,140
of my YouTube friends and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,989
I noticed so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it is this whole</font>

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,010
loyalty in terms of if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're how should</font>

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,809
I put this the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that showed</font>

21
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,660
up tend to be fan girls and boys of

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,059
Charlie Alex which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an issue</font>

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">with I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I completely</font>

24
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,829
understand they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have huge huge number of</font>

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,920
followers so it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that people</font>

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,740
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see them as opposed to see me</font>

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,170
but when issue began to happen was when

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,450
I uploaded the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video to my channel and I</font>

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,790
remember one comment aimed<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed plan and</font>

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,049
they said who the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

31
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,780
playing and it just made me laugh

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,119
because it wasn't an attack on what he

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">was doing there was no judgment about</font>

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,119
his playing it was just who is he and

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,439
the thing I've noticed on YouTube the

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,500
past couple of years where unfortunately

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,400
we're getting this culture now where

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,290
people feel the need to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here just</font>

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be famous it's their right to be</font>

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,549
famous and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look across the board now</font>

41
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,979
it's it's all there people marketing

42
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,320
themselves which good or bad that's a

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,140
completely different discussion but with

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,009
this it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> as if people who are fans of</font>

45
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,159
Charlie and Alex<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they know who</font>

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,530
Charlie and Alex's and they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,930
lots of people know who they are so when

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,460
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people who are new and</font>

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,240
unfamiliar it's well I don't know about

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,610
them not many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people know about them so</font>

51
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,170
who the hell are they<font color="#CCCCCC"> to where am I</font>

52
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,080
going with this you may be asking well I

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,150
am getting somewhere so judgment was

54
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,900
made

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,760
hell was this guy and I could say he's

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,170
on YouTube called eggplant and he's a

57
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,629
musician now if that guy just takin some

58
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,950
care into rationalizing we thought

59
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,750
before he said it he would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,939
well he's playing music so he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

61
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,319
musician he's got a following online so

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,079
he must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good at what he does people</font>

63
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,569
must enjoy it and therefore the people

64
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,670
who made the show chose him because they

65
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,650
knew he would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great asset to the</font>

66
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,079
show I mean in my opinion he is one of

67
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,790
my favorite musicians on YouTube and

68
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,989
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason amusing him as an</font>

69
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,450
example but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are people that</font>

70
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,420
support him so if the person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote</font>

71
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,609
that comment had just thought for a

72
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,090
second and rationalize their thoughts

73
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,709
they wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have made such a coin so a</font>

74
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,840
second example before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to the main</font>

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,359
point of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> video when I see someone</font>

76
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,060
online a video blogger vlogger he's very

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,510
confident and forward I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

78
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,000
they are quite arrogant or pretentious

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,060
and that's my first thoughts but what

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do is you pulse you think about it</font>

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,340
and you'll realize they're not arrogant

82
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,139
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> very passionate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

83
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,819
they're talking about and I guess I

84
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,650
experienced this because I know there

85
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some people I'm friends with on</font>

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,730
YouTube who have admitted that at first

87
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,620
they thought I was arrogant pretentious

88
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,750
because i am very forward and it's not

89
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,340
because I'm arrogant it's just I'm very

90
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,489
passionate and I speak confidently and

91
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,819
I'm smiling and you know but then I

92
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,680
could be threatening I don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,479
you just give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a chance if you reflect</font>

94
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,909
if you rationalize it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font>

95
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:53,159
bad and I spike about it on absolute

96
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,169
radio recently regarding a presenter

97
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,930
called Ian Lee he does<font color="#CCCCCC"> a recap program</font>

98
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,180
for the TV show Lost and I watched it

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,030
and he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very mean to the people he</font>

100
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">co-presented with so I kind of felt hate</font>

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,290
towards him<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day I was on</font>

102
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,329
his radio show and I explained the point

103
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,919
I've just made them oh hi i have again

104
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,720
yes I mammal cause if you I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">speak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about music</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> treated you earlier</font>

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was blade 376 oh yes yeah I'm now a</font>

107
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,320
fan officially I worked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,310
mm-hmm pourquoi yeah why yes I don't

109
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,710
know

110
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,819
I guess I've just given you more of a

111
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,370
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when I first saw you in</font>

112
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,590
action doing your thing it was it was on

113
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,319
the lost initiative being very mocking

114
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,780
in that and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard not to see</font>

115
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,520
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as being pretentious at first but</font>

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
this was opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovable and I by the</font>

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,710
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that was my first opinion and</font>

118
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,289
we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you reevaluate all</font>

119
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,090
we're saying is give give peace a chance

120
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,669
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always saying so what's the point</font>

121
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,009
I'm trying to make well we're human we

122
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,930
make judgments there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong</font>

123
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that we're not perfect but we're</font>

124
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,280
human in the sense that we're able to

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,169
rationalize and some people believe that

126
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something that distinguishes us from</font>

127
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,020
animals what is it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be human is to</font>

128
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,990
have the power to judge and then to

129
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,789
rationalize our behaviors and thoughts

130
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,160
but we live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a society now where so</font>

131
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,340
many people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that being wrong or</font>

132
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,870
having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back on what you first</font>

133
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,080
thought or said is a weakness and it's

134
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,610
not because to find out that you're

135
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong and to acknowledge that is showing</font>

136
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you understand the right way of</font>

137
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">things or the better alternative and</font>

138
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,020
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a positive surely it's like</font>

139
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,380
prejudice and discrimination<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to be</font>

140
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">prejudice is not necessarily a bad thing</font>

141
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,120
we need it to differentiate between good

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,090
and bad in life but discrimination is

143
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,789
when you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> action on those thoughts</font>

144
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,909
sometimes and obviously some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font>

145
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">prejudice which are deemed as irrational</font>

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,830
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he may have heard that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term before</font>

147
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore they discriminate just in</font>

148
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,479
ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very acceptable so all</font>

149
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm saying is like Ian Lee said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on</font>

150
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,289
the radio all we're saying is give give

151
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,630
peace a chance that there's always

152
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i right about this person am I</font>

153
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,340
wrong about this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> what judgments</font>

154
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,159
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made and why and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just feel if</font>

155
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,990
