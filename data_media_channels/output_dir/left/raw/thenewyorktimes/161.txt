1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,590
“Seven billion people inhabit
planet Earth.”

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,220
When I saw this video,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,000
I was reminded of a phrase
that Milan Kundera came up with

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,340
in ”The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,”

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,230
which is “totalitarian kitsch.”

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,650
This sort of
cartoony, idealized aesthetic

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,100
using very broad,

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,259
what you might
call corny, images.

9
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,050
And you see this in
the aesthetics of a lot

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,850
of authoritarian regimes.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,290
Vladimir Putin
being photographed shirtless,

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,650
it’s a corny,
ridiculous image.

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,930
And yet these corny,
ridiculous images

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,960
are often powerful
in strongman regimes.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,390
Looking at it objectively,
as a piece of film

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,440
and a video being
used in diplomacy,

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,720
it’s kind of hilarious.

18
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,000
There are so many cornball,
cliché images.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,270
“ — to be the future — ”

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,580
But in political kitsch, often
corniness and cliché is the point.

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,590
Clichés are images that
everybody has seen before.

22
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,450
They're images that
everybody recognize

23
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,600
and therefore, they’re images
that you can count on

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,420
to have broad mass appeal,

25
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,530
even if it’s not
sophisticated appeal.

26
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,110
“Their story is well known,

27
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,410
but what will be
their sequel?”

28
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,410
One thing this video
tells us

29
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,330
is the
kind of arguments

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,310
that the Trump administration
is making

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,990
to the North Korean
government:

32
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,450
"Make this deal and
you will look good.

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,380
You’ll be the protagonist
of the world.

34
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,340
You will live like a lottery winner."

35
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,410
What I saw, when I look at
the trailer,

36
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,880
was the Trump administration

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,030
trying to speak
to Kim Jong-un

38
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,980
the way the administration
speaks to Donald Trump.

39
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,830
“Be part of that world.”

40
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,610
Donald Trump is, shall
we say, a visual learner.

41
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,620
He prefers to get
his briefing material

42
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,480
in the form of
pictures, videos,

43
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,240
images, graphics.

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,820
Preferably the
material references his name

45
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,480
as much as possible in
order to keep his interest.

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,500
One thing that’s a constant
in Donald Trump’s career

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,740
is his use of big,
broad cartoony symbols

48
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,040
to get across big, broad
cartoony messages.

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,360
“Bradford, you’re fired.”

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,150
How do you make yourself a
celebrity as a businessman?

51
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,920
How do you create
the idea that you’re

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
the most successful
businessman in the world,

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,299
whether you are or not?

54
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:10,550
Well, you build a giant skyscraper
with your name on it

55
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,614
in three-foot-tall, brass
golden letters.

56
00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:14,930
And that’s what
made Donald Trump

57
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,200
so fitting for
reality TV.

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,060
Reality TV, likewise, communicates
in big broad symbols:

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,620
desert islands, roses.

60
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,321
There’s this
theme with him

61
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:28,490
of sort of seeing himself
as the protagonist of a show

62
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,620
that he and other
people are watching.

63
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,300
“It comes down to a choice.”

64
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,600
So this video is reaching
out a hand to Kim Jong-un

65
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,550
and saying, “Work with me. You
can be my co-star

66
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,540
in this show that everybody
else is watching."

67
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,690
“Will this leader choose
to advance his country

68
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,220
and be part of a new world?”

69
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,750
What you have in
this video

70
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,310
are a lot of garish
symbols of importance.

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,820
This montage at the
beginning, for example,

72
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,030
where a big image of
the North Korean flag

73
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,090
is equated with the
Colosseum and the pyramids.

74
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,890
It’s a way of communicating
that, “Work with us,

75
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,940
and you will be regarded as
one of the greats of history."

76
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,300
“ — or more isolation — ”

77
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,590
This seems like the
kind of kitschy picture

78
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,180
that in a weird way is fitting
for a regime like Kim’s.

79
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,490
It’s surreal but
it’s no more surreal

80
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,020
than the host of
“The Apprentice”

81
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,050
negotiating a nuclear deal
with the head of North Korea.

82
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,980
This is the world
we live in now.

83
00:03:22,980 --> 00:00:00,000
“One moment.
One choice.”
