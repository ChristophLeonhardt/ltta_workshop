<font color="#E5E5E5">reports we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss six</font>

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons why according to industry</font>

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,750
sources and people close to the

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies so first off the first reason</font>

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is local search is adjacent to Google's</font>

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Maine's main business it has you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,530
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thousands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of advertisers</font>

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,840
who want to get in on this the second

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,930
one the second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that local</font>

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,120
businesses want to advertise on the

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,710
internet but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere to</font>

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,210
drive web<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to Yelp creates Yelp</font>

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,039
pages which is a great place for local

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,530
businesses to send traffic when Facebook

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,449
advertising finally started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really</font>

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,329
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> off is because Facebook pages which</font>

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,579
send messages to all of their followers

20
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,920
anytime things<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new happens can</font>

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,180
keep them updated with the company

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,040
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> became a really worthwhile place</font>

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,680
to send people on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so that</font>

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,450
business is taking off<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google sees that</font>

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,670
says hey we need a place for local

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,549
businesses can put put their businesses

27
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,350
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web and it's meaningful for them</font>

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,240
to drive traffic to the reason that Yelp

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,250
pages are so good by the way is because

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,450
Yelp allows merchants to select one

31
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,619
review and stick it at the top of the

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,930
page so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the appearance of</font>

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,329
objectivity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is also sort of</font>

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,310
friendly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business the third</font>

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,860
reason is that most of Google Google's

36
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,229
local search business right now is all

37
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,299
about maps and they really need a new

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,220
way to diversify content so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,680
everything on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google use when you search</font>

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,119
it for local it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight to the map</font>

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see it there Yelp is very text-based</font>

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,950
it gives you new kinds of ad units whole

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,229
new realm to explore fourth reason is

44
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,850
that yelp has a great brand with local

45
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,369
searchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and merchants so one analogy</font>

46
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,560
for this is you look at you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,689
google video<font color="#E5E5E5"> google tried video through</font>

48
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,640
google video for years finally they

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,049
decide it wasn't working<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

50
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,280
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought youtube which had a great</font>

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">brand and rd a lot of traction with</font>

52
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,849
users<font color="#E5E5E5"> google has been trying out for a</font>

53
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:12,790
long time they've had

54
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,099
local pages really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple local ads</font>

55
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,140
hasn't really worked like they want so

56
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,280
maybe they're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,689
buy a brand that's already working and

58
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,060
then work on the technology the fourth

59
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,500
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that yelp has a lot of</font>

60
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,079
traction on mobile which is all about

61
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,849
local if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> very popular mobile</font>

62
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,760
apps urbanspoon Foursquare it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

63
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're taking your phone with you you</font>

64
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,329
are actually local when you're using it

65
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:38,230
so yelp has great local apps and on the

66
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">iPhone and on the Android and so that</font>

67
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,219
helps out google greatly the six reason

68
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,560
is that Yelp is a great cultural fit for

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,389
google Jeremy Stoppelman and the whole

70
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">crew or friends with lots of people at</font>

71
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,720
Google and they live in working<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain</font>
