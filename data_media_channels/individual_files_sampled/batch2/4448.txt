he still also asked the prize not bad reports that his Secretary of Defense James Madison had to explain to him the importance of NATO is it true general Madison to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War 3 no it's not true what slightly I like general mattis I think I know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you and here's the president responding when asked if mattis was leaving what about general mattis is he going to leave well I don't know he hasn't told me that I don't own a relationship with him it could be that he is I think he's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth but general mattis is a good guy we get along very well he may leave I mean at some point everybody leaves it's all about reasserting a stature and status I'm not a baby I'm the president I don't think this has ever been said in the history of the American presidency a president speaking to a journalist saying I'm president and you're not I mean that's like written it's like they always say in the Army if you have to say it's an order you're already in trouble Chris because the officer gives the order your honor officer gives the order you don't have to keep saying hey I'm the boss but he but he does I mean he don't know if he has to keep saying it but he does keep saying he keeps asserting that he's the person with power I think that's why he loves rallies he goes to rallies and there's no you connect him everybody is cheering him on speaker how are you well first of all I must say that Professor Clawd is a is a master of understatement when he says that Donald Trump is deeply transactional with people like Kim jong-eun I hope you appreciate the compliment sir because I mean because it's worse than that I mean Kim jong-un is a thug Vladimir Putin is a thug these are people who in the tradition of the American presidency presidents would have the moral authority to denounce so why is he like him he likes them because their doings because it was some for him and I must say that a people who support Donald Trump love that about him but he's also the most infantile character we have he's not a baby he's not a baby he says he's not another baby mix it's not a crook and he's not I'm not a baby it is extraordinary stuff and I have to give credit to our colleague at the highest level colleague that's that's Lesley Stahl to get the president to actually be put his dukes up get those dukes up and sail this crazy stuff for the record because that's what journalists do they don't win the argument they get the truth out thank you sir Paige Thank You Eddie Glaude thank you hard hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
