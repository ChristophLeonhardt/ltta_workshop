and joining me now is billionaire democratic activist Tom Steyer mr. Stahr welcome back to the show thank you for having me so you seem to be in the minority in the progressive movement as far as leadership is concerned when it comes to campaigning on the impeachment issue why do you believe you're right and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are wrong well Chuck we are doing something very simple and impeachment which is we are trying to tell a truth that we believe is the most important truth in American politics today which is that we have a reckless dangerous and lawless president and we're trying to put the interests of the American people and our democracy first that's all we're trying to do and that's all we're going to continue to try to do what do you think I'm exactly sure right argument yeah what do you say to Democrats though that feel as they'e go ahead you're stepping on a message or just I stepped on you a my apologies but that you're stepping on a democratic message say on health care and some other issues that you're actually playing into Donald Trump's hands he wants nothing more than to be a martyr a political martyr and he wants nothing more than to make this about impeachment what do you say to that criticism I think the midterms in 2018 regardless of what any democrat or republican does are to a large extent going to be a referendum on this president and this administration and I think that what we're trying to do is tell the truth about what he's doing in terms of his the danger that he's presenting to America the lawlessness behavior that he exhibits on a daily basis and we believe that telling the truth on the most important facts the American people is something that's important to do at all times and that's exactly why we're doing it so is your goal to have Congress to elect a congress that will be a majority in favor of impeachment in 2018 is that the goal is that what you're spending your money to do we are as you know Chuck we are a grassroots organization we organize around the country with our partners were probably the largest grassroots organization in the United States trying to promote education and participation by as many Americans as possible and we believe that the answer to our political problem is more democracy and we believe that if in fact Americans are involved and turned out that we will get a much better Congress than the Congress will flip are we doing that specifically because of a need for to impeach this president no that is something where we feel like that is something we've done for five years long before the question of impeachment was ever on the table that is something we believe is a important value in and of itself a broad inclusive American democracy well it's my understanding in the battle for for the house to win back Congress to if you want to elect a pro impeachment majority that the three states you'd be advertising in the most would not be Iowa South Carolina New Hampshire but when I look at your number when I look at how you're spending your TV ad dollars in impeachment you seem to be most focused on the first four states I'll throw in Nevada these all coincidentally you're in media markets that are all about the first four primary states in the 2020 presidential I don't see any Pennsylvania ads there's a whole bunch of congressional districts there I don't see any Texas ads there's a whole bunch of congressional districts there is this simply about you raising your profile to run for president absolutely not we have been in Newham why are you only targeting chuck could you let me finish sure could you let me finish we have been in Nevada we have been in Iowa and we've been in New Hampshire since 2014 we have been organizing in those states because their swing states for a long time in fact we have been going to those states I've personally been going to those states for five years so the fact that we are still organizing in those states we are we have organizations that have been building grassroots impact there for a long time South Carolina is something that is new but the fact the matter is we have been doing this for five years because as a grassroots organization we're not in all 50 states are in 11 states I mean wait a minute I'm sorry you're you're trying to tell me that the fact that a lion's share of the money you're spending are in the first four presidential primary states if I were to believe what you're saying with a straight face then you'd be in Wisconsin you'd be in Michigan you'd be in Florida for the last seven years you wouldn't have been in and New Hampshire no come on we are in excuse me we are in Wisconsin we are in Florida we are in Michigan we are in Pennsylvania we are organizing in all of I'm looking at the TV not a single if you haven't spent any money you haven't spent the money that you're spending in the presidential states actually if you take a look at where we've spent money we have spent money by far the biggest money we spent is national advice which go to every single one of those states by far the bulk of what we spent has gone to Wisconsin has gone to Florida has gone to Michigan and it has gone to Pennsylvania view hang on hang on if you look at the spending by state you will see that the bulk of our money is going to the biggest states that we're in which includes California which includes Florida and Richmond lose those mid well those northern Midwestern states I want to ask you about the slippery slope issue with messaging when it comes to this impeachment issue and the fact that some are really excited about I want to play an excerpt from your Town Hall in Iowa from earlier this week take a listen mr. Trump has and he really is an incredibly skillful and talented communicator he really is which Hitler was too but let's not and I think the reason people push back against the Hitler comparison regardless of any similarities is Hitler ended up killing millions and millions of people and mr. Trump has shown a disregard for law he has been he breaks the law he has shown a disrespect for the idea of law and in many ways he has done things that we find or I find abhorrent but he hasn't killed millions of people that's why we want to impeach them we'd like to end it here look you dealt with the contradiction in your answer how when Hitler gets introduced and you were asked a question about Hitler you did not bring him up but this is what happens with the impeachment argument no I understand that but this is what happens with the impeachment argument it becomes the slippery slope extremist arguments and nuance gets lost and that's what Democrats are most afraid of nuance will get lost and it looks like all they care about is getting Trump what do you say about that nuanced issue I think it is really important that we stick to the facts and we stick to the truth and that's we've tried to do Chuck really hard and if you listen to me in that answer I was saying no that's not a fair comparison because there he hasn't done what Hitler did we are taken aback by the price reaction removed were you taking it back where the crowd rate didn't react the way you did no I know that there are people who are very upset about this I know that there are people who haven't thought about it as intensively maybe as I have and so no I understand people's fears and concerns and that doesn't surprise me but I think it's important to make exactly the point that you made which is there are it's important to stick to the truth to not go overboard to not get into some kind of emotional rant because this is a very important and sober topic so we should treat it that way and that's what I was trying to do there and that's what I tried to do at every single instance is not do what you're warning about because I think that that would be wrong mr.
