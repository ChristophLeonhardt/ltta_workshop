1
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:15,178
ECONOMY IS RED-HOT.

2
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:15,913
WHEN EVEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

3
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,981
HAS TO ADMIT IT.

4
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,383
CHECK OUT THIS REPORTING.

5
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:21,351
IT'S HEADLINED, WE RAN OUT OF

6
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:23,287
WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THE

7
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,121
JOBS NUMBERS ARE.

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,822
AND IT ALSO WENT ON TO SAY, THE

9
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:28,258
ECONOMY IS IN A SWEET SPOT WITH

10
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:29,192
STEADY GROWTH AND BROAD

11
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,261
IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOR MARKET.

12
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,930
JUST LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS.

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,831
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL TO AN

14
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,701
18-YEAR LOW AT 3.8% IN MAY, AS

15
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:41,238
THE ECONOMY ADDED 223,000 JOBS.

16
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:42,439
BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT FELL TO A NEW

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,641
RECORD LOW AT 5.9%.

18
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,709
DOWN SHARPLY FROM THE 6.6% IN

19
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:49,012
APRIL.

20
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:50,147
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS, I LOVE

21
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:51,281
THIS, INCREASED 2.7% FROM A YEAR

22
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:56,620
EARLIER.

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,354
MEANWHILE, TRUMP IS DRAINING THE

24
00:00:57,354 --> 00:00:59,556
SWAMP BY SLASHING 3,000 FEDERAL

25
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:02,859

00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,795

00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:05,128
OFFICE.

28

LARRY, THANKS FOR JOINING US.

I WAS THINKING BACK ON, YOU

"THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAD TO

57
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:42,332
ADMIT TODAY THAT THINGS ARE

58
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:43,100
CRAZY GOOD.

59
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,767
>> WOW.

60
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,836
BECAUSE I REMEMBER MY GREAT

61
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:47,971
FRIEND PAUL KRUGMAN THRASHING

62
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,239
ALL OF US AND SAYING THAT THE

63
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,941
ECONOMY WAS GOING TO GO INTO A

64
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:52,476
DEEP RECESSION, AND THE STOCK

65
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,745
MARKET WAS GOING TO CRASH.

66
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:57,781
I GUESS THE DAY AFTER THE

67
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:58,148
ELECTION.

68
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,883
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT,

69
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:00,917
THE REALITY.

70
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,520
TODAY WAS ANOTHER GREAT DAY FOR

71
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,956
JOBS, UP 223,000.

72
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,491
WAGES ARE RISING.

73
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:08,758
UNEMPLOYMENT IS FALLING.

74
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,460
>> Laura: WE WENT THROUGH IT

75
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:10,761
ALL.

76
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,862
>> SMALL BUSINESS NUMBERS DID

77
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,263
VERY WELL AGAIN TODAY.

78
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,197
MANUFACTURING REPORTS DID VERY

79
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,332
WELL AGAIN TODAY.

80
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:17,534
IT'S NEVER PERFECT, BUT WE'RE ON

81
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,370
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THE BIG ISSUE

82
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,838
FOR MY CRITICS AND THE

83
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:25,275
PRESIDENT'S CRITICS AND THE

84
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,343
ECONOMIC AREA, YOU'LL NEVER GET

85
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,645
TO 3%, YOU CAN'T BEAT 2%.

86
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,480
WELL, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE RUNNING

87
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,550
FOUR QUARTERS, 2.9%, AND THE

88
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,820
SECOND QUARTER, ACCORDING TO THE

89
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,457
ATLANTA MODEL GDP NOW, 4.7%,

90
00:02:40,457 --> 00:02:42,225
THAT'S THEIR ESTIMATE.

91
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,693
I'LL BE HAPPY WITH 3%.

92
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:46,129
>> Laura: WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

93
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,532
THE ECONOMY HAD A QUARTER AT 4%?

94
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,067
>> I PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN

95
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:50,734
REMEMBER THAT.

96
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:53,036
I'LL SAY THE 1990s.

97
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,339
>> Laura: YEAH, PROBABLY '94.

98
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:00,877
>> '4, '5, '6, '7.

99
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:03,680
>> Laura: "NEW YORK TIMES,"

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,248
TRUMP TOUTS JOB REPORT BEFORE

101
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:06,883
OFFICIAL RELEASE, BREAKING

102
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:07,250
PROTOCOL.

103
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,119
THIS IS WHAT THEY SEIZED ON.

104
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,153
BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER STUFF WAS

105
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:10,954
REALLY GOOD.

106
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:12,189
SO TRUMP TWEETED OUT THIS

107
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,091
MORNING, YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR

108
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:14,758
THOSE JOBS REPORTS.

109
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,426
>> THAT'S ALL HE SAID.

110
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:17,794
LIKE THE REST OF AMERICA,

111
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,663
LOOKING FOR THE JOBS REPORT.

112
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,332
LISTEN, BY LAW AND CUSTOM, ALL

113
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,634
RIGHT, I GET THE JOBS DATA THE

114
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:25,102
NIGHT BEFORE.

115
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:28,171
I GET IT FROM MY PAL AT THE CAA.

116
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:29,272
WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

117
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,575
I CALLED IT, TO LET HIM KNOW,

118
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,043
BECAUSE IT WAS A GREAT NUMBER.

119
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,277
IT WAS A PRIVATE NUMBER, A

120
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,912
SECRET NUMBER, YOU CAN'T PUT IT

121
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:36,179
OUT.

122
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:40,517
I GOT HOLD OF HIM ON AIR FORCE

123
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:40,817
ONE.

124
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:42,853
>> Laura: HE'S ABOUT TO TWEET IT

125
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,921
OUT, THOUGH, EXCITED LIKE A KID,

126
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:45,922
EXCITED ABOUT THE NEWS.

127
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:48,625
HE WANTS AMERICA TO WIN.

128
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,793
HE WANTS TO WIN.

129
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:50,994
>> HE DOES WANT TO WIN.

130
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:51,928
YOU KNOW WHAT?

131
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:53,997
I FIGURED, I DIDN'T WANT TO

132
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:57,234
BOTHER HIM COMING HOME FROM A

133
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,835
I THOUGHT HE NEEDED SOME GOOD

134
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:00,537
NEWS, HE GOT GOOD NEWS.

135
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,573
THE TAX CUTS, THE ROLLBACK OF

136
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,841
REGULATIONS, THE OPENING OF

137
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,909
ENERGY, THE PROTECTION OF SOME

138
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,310
OF OUR OWN TRADING RIGHTS.

139
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,112
>> Laura: OH, BUT THIS IS WHAT

140
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,514
SET EVERYONE OFF, THEY SAID

141
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,416
TRUMP WOULD BACK OFF ON THIS

142
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,519
DEAL, ON THE TARIFFS, IT WAS ALL

143
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,553
A PLOY.

144
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:19,923
BUT NOW, LOOKS LIKE HE MEANS

145
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:20,290
BUSINESS.

146
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,459
ALL THESE PEOPLE CRITICIZING

147
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:22,726
HIM.

148
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,060
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO PREDICT

149
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,795
WHAT TRUMP IS GOING TO DO.

150
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,097
TRUMP'S TRADE WAR IS BAD FOR

151
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:27,464
BUSINESS.

152
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:31,635
THIS IS A WEIRD SELF DEFEATING

153
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:33,537
WAY TO ALLIES.

154
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:35,438
THE TRUMP TRADE SLUMP MAY YET

155
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:35,772
HAPPEN.

156
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:37,574
>> MAY YET HAPPEN.

157
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:39,342
>> Laura: HOW A TRUMP TRADE WAR

158
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:40,877
COULD SLOW DOWN THE GLOBAL

159
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:41,478
ECONOMY.

160
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:43,113
TRUMP'S TRADE WAR WOULD BE VERY

161
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:45,615
BAD FOR MANY AMERICANS.

162
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:48,418
AND THAT JUST -- THAT'S JUST A

163
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,020
SMATTERING OF SOME OF THE

164
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,420
HEADLINES.

165
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,356
>> ONE THING I'LL SAY.

166
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:53,790
PEOPLE LOOKS

167
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:53,823

PEOPLE LOOING AT THIS S

PEOPLE LOOING AT THIS STU

176
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,027
PEOPLE LOOING AT THIS STUFF

177
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,094
SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHEN PRESIDENT

178
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,262
TRUMP SAYS SOMETHING, THEY

179
00:04:59,262 --> 00:04:59,930
SHOULD BELIEVE IT.

180
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,331
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW

181
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,533
THROUGH ON IT.

182
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,869
SO, LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO SEE A

183
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:08,939
WORLD TRADE WAR, TARIFF WAR, WE

184
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,941
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING REMOTELY

185
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:11,575
LIKE THAT.

186
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:13,977
FROM DAY ONE, WE'VE GONE AFTER

187
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:14,311
CHINA.

188
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:15,345
THEY DESERVE IT.

189
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,081
THEY'RE UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL

190
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,449
TRADING PRACTICES HAVE TO BE

191
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:20,250
DEALT WITH.

192
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,484
THEY'RE STEALING OUR TECHNOLOGY.

193
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:23,720
THAT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH.

194
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,121
>> Laura: WHAT ABOUT OUR ALLIES,

195
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,156
CANADA, THE EU?

196
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,425
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED TO

197
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:28,725
THEM.

198
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,794
IN THE ANNOUNCEMENTS YESTERDAY

199
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:32,829
WE SPENT A LINE OR TWO SAYING

200
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,364
WE'RE STILL IN DISCUSSION.

201
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:35,865
PARTICULARLY SINGLING OUT CANADA

202
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:36,399
AND EUROPE.

203
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,701
WE'RE STILL IN THAT DISCUSSION.

204
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,570
BUT LOOK, WE'VE ASKED THEM TO

205
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,139
HELP US ON THIS STEEL PRODUCTION

206
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,241
AND OVERCAPACITY.

207
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,442
WE'VE ASKED THEM TO HELP US ON

208
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,244
WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLS

209
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,178
RECIPROCITY.

210
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:51,414
SO IF WE SELL AN AMERICAN CAR IN

211
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:53,817
GERMANY, WE PAY A 10% TARIFF.

212
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,752
IF THEY SELL A CAR IN AMERICA,

213
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:58,255
IT'S 2.5%.

214
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,190
WHY DOESN'T THE REST OF EUROPE

215
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,658
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

216
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,760
A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.

217
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,863
LOOK, I'M NOT A BIG TARIFF GUY.

218
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,398
I'M KNOWN AS A FREE TRADER.

219
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:09,532
>> Laura: THE PRESIDENT SAID

220
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,667
HE'S A FREE TRADER.

221
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,167
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

222
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:14,871
>> Laura: HE WANTS A FAIR TRADE.

223
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,641
>> THE SEE, LOOK IT.

224
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:18,875
FREE TRADE WILL HELP THE

225
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,076
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

226
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:20,610
OKAY?

227
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,579
BUT, YOU CAN'T HAVE FREE TRADE

228
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:24,047
IF ALL THESE COUNTRIES, MOST

229
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,782
PARTICULARLY CHINA, ARE ENGAGING

230
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,984
IN UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL TRADING.

231
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:31,388
>> Laura: THEY'RE SUBSIDIZING

232
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:33,723
THEIR COUNTRY.

233
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,860
CANADA DUMPED $200 MILLION IN

234
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,662
TOYOTA PRODUCTION IN CANADA.

235
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,765
THEY'RE SUBSIDIZING, NOT TO THE

236
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:43,633
TUNE OF WHAT CHINA'S DONE -- SO

237
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,734
PEOPLE GET WHY THE PRESIDENT

238
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,670
BELIEVES WE HAVE TO RIGHT THE

239
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,538
SHIP HERE WITH THESE TARIFFS.

240
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:49,639
CHINA, THE TRADE DEFICIT FOR

241
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,509
LAST YEAR, $375 BILLION IN GOODS

242
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,611
AND SERVICES.

243
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,279
CANADA, $18 BILLION.

244
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,282
MEXICO, $71 BILLION.

245
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:00,650
JAPAN, $69 BILLION.

246
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,586
GERMANY, $65 BILLION.

247
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:06,056
IN DEFICITS.

248
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:06,790
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND

249
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,957
THE FREE TRADER FRIENDS, THAT

250
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:08,625
DOESN'T MATTER.

251
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,959
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

252
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,628
BUT THEN THEY WONDER WHY PEOPLE

253
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:14,297
TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

254
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:15,799
MANUFACTURING JOBS, BLUE COLLAR

255
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:19,903
JOBS, USED TO HAVE 18 OF THE 20

256
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:20,904
STEEL MANUFACTURERS IN THE

257
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,105
WORLD, NOW WE HAVE TWO.

258
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:24,307
AND NONE OF THE STEEL COMPANIES

259
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:25,809
IN THE TOP TEN TODAY, LARRY.

260
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:28,078
>> LOOK, WE ACTUALLY RUN A

261
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,213
SURPLUS ALL IN WITH CANADA.

262
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,648
>> Laura: YOU'RE DOING THE

263
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:32,349
TIMBER THING, RIGHT?

264
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,050
>> THE SERVICES THING.

265
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,018
>> Laura: GOODS AND SERVICES,

266
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:37,387
IT'S $18 BILLION.

267
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:39,255
>> THE ISSUE HERE, I DON'T

268
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,358
REALLY THINK IT'S TRADE DEFICIT,

269
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,193
THAT'S NOT MY FAVORITE METRIC,

270
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:47,030
THE ISSUE HERE IS TARIFFS AND

271
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,098
NON-TARIFF BARRIERS.

272
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:49,666
SO THEY WON'T LET US SELL TO

273
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,101
THEM, THEY WON'T LET US EXPORT

274
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,769
TO THEM, WE ARE THE MOST

275
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,304
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY IN THE

276
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:54,604
WORLD.

277
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:57,640
A RECENT POLL JUST SAID WE

278
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,942
BOLTED BACK INTO FIRST PLACE.

279
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:02,078
THE OECD SAID WE'RE THE FASTEST

280
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:02,612
GROWING ECONOMY.

281
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,614
>> Laura: BUT THE TARIFFS ARE

282
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,116
GOING TO RUIN IT ALL, THAT'S

283
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:07,183
WHAT THE FRIENDS AT THE JOURNAL

284
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:07,717
ARE SAYING.

285
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:09,519
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LEVEL

286
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,320
PLAYING FIELD.

287
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,654
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN HIS HEART

288
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:13,056
A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD GUY.

289
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,424
HE'S A FREE TRADE GUY.

290
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:17,293
LET'S CLEAR AWAY -- THE WHOLE

291
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,928
WORLD TRADING SYSTEM, BY THE

292
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:19,996
WAY, HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR YEARS

293
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,264
AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

294
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,333
A LOT OF PRESIDENTS HAVE GONE

295
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,268
DOWN THIS ROAD AND HAVE NEVER

296
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,069
DONE ANYTHING.

297
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,737
HE'S GONE DOWN THIS ROAD AND

298
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:28,171
WON'T STOP.

299
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,306
>> Laura: 1990'S CHINA ECONOMY

300
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,142
IS SMALL AS THE SIZE OF ITALY.

301
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:33,342
NOW I BELIEVE IT'S TEN TIMES THE

302
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:36,546
SIZE OF CANADA.

303
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:37,414
JAPAN, EXCUSE ME.

304
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:40,616
>> FAIR TRADING, AND FREE MARKET

305
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:42,251
CAPITALISM WILL BEAT THE

306
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:42,585
CHINESE.

307
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:43,318
I GIVE THE PRESIDENT A LOT OF

308
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:46,556
HIGH MARKS FOR STICKING TO IT.

309
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:49,793
AND HE IS NOT GOING TO LET GO.

310
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,295
FOLKS, LISTEN TO HIM AND COME --

311
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,497
WE'RE IN A FAMILY SQUABBLE WITH

312
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:56,232
OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE.

313
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,535
>> Laura: JAPAN COULDN'T KEEP

314
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:58,868
GOING.

315
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,637
>> WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TALKS.

316
00:09:00,637 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY'VE GOT TO DO THEIR PART.
