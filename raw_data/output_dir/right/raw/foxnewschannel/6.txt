WELCOME TO

"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT."

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,504
THE APPARENT PIPE BOMBS HAVE

7
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:17,172
RECEIVED HUGE MEDIA ATTENTION IN

8
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:19,508
THE PAST FEW DAYS AND RIGHTLY

9
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:19,808
SO.

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,644
THE WHOLE THING IS HORRIFYING.

11
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:24,913
BUT THEY ARE NOT ISOLATED ACTS.

12
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:26,148
IT'S SUPPOSEDLY PART OF THE

13
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,085
LANDSCAPE IN THIS COUNTRY.

14
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:32,354
THREATS, ENVELOPES FILLED WITH

15
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:33,022
WHITE POWDER AND PHYSICAL

16
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:34,556
ATTACKS.

17
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:37,926
EVERY DAY, ARE MORE EXAMPLES OF

18
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:38,227
THIS.

19
00:00:38,228 --> 00:00:38,961
THE DETAILS REMAIN SPARSE BUT

20
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:40,896
THE REACTION HAS BEEN

21
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:41,563
PREDICTABLE AND DEPRESSING.

22
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:46,068
YOU SEE THE USUAL DUMB PEOPLE ON

23
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:47,336
TELEVISION TO MAKE PARTISAN

AND AND THAT INCLUDES THE

27
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:01,283
PRESIDENT'S DISLIKE OF THE MEDIA

28
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:05,154
AND ACTIVE TERROR.

29
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:12,194
AND UP IT WENT ON LIKE THIS WITH

30
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:13,062
MAXIMUM SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS.

31
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:16,065

32
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,533
SCRUTINY.

33

YEARS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN

POUR GASOLINE ON THE FIRE.

38
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,010
>> I BLAME THAT RHETORIC OUT OF

39
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:28,777
THE WHITE HOUSE THAT COMES FROM

40
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:32,147
THE TOP.

41
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,549

ERIC HOLDER, AND CNN, --

45
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:50,933
>> Tucker: OBAMA IS

46
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,469
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIPE BOMBS

47
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,770
NOW, OVER AND OVER.

48
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:56,138
BUT THIS TIME STRANGELY AT

49
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,005
DIDN'T.

50
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,507
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE VERY

51
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,275
MUCH, MAYBE THEY JUST EXPECTED

52
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,910
IT'S COMING.

53
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:02,611
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED BACK TO

54
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:06,515
THE MEDIA, AND BLAMED THEM FOR

55
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:07,082
MAKING AMERICA ANGRY.

56
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:14,323
THE CROWD SHOUTED, LOCK HER UP.

57
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,258
AND IT WAS, IT IS ALL NORMAL

58
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:16,525
NOW.

59
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:17,526
THE TWO PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

60
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,428
THAT DESPISE EACH OTHER SO MUCH,

61
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:23,699
THERE IS NOTHING THAT ONE CAN'T

62
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,767
IMAGINE THE OTHER DOING

63
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,368
INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM.

64
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,203
THIS IS OMINOUS, WE ARE NOT

65
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:29,171
SUPPOSED TO HATE OUR FELLOW

66
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:31,006
AMERICANS THIS MUCH.

67
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,142
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DID WE GET

68
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:33,442
HERE?

69
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,544
OUR LEADER MADE A SERIES OF

70
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:36,211
TERRIBLE DECISIONS AND NEVER

71
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,212
APOLOGIZE FOR THEM.

72
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,981
THE MIDDLE-CLASS DIED AND NOBODY

73
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,082
NOTICED.

74
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,717
NEW TECHNOLOGIES WERE SUPPOSED

75
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:44,153
TO UNITE US BUT INSTEAD DROVE US

76
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:45,587
FURTHER APART.

77
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,189
A ROTTEN EDUCATION SYSTEM,

78
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,090
DISINTEGRATING FAMILIES,

79
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,291
SHOCKING RATES OF SUBSTANCE

80
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,460
ABUSE, ALL OF THOSE PLAYED A

81
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,361
ROLE AND THERE WERE OTHER

82
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,595
FACTORS, TOO.

83
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:55,531
BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING, OUR

84
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:56,832
THINKING CHANGED.

85
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,500
THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

86
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,169
OVER TIME WE STOPPED DEBATING

87
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,370
POLITICS, ISSUES AND IDEAS AND

88
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:03,071
STARTED ATTACKING EACH OTHER FOR

89
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:03,806
THINGS THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE FOR

90
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:06,175
WHO WE ARE.

91
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,176
TAKE IMMIGRATION.

92
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:09,211
20 YEARS AGO WE WOULD BE ARGUING

93
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:11,580
ABOUT HOW MANY MIGRANTS TO ADMIT

94
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:13,182
INTO THIS COUNTRY, UNDER WHAT

95
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,083
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHETHER OR NOT IT

96
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,386
WAS ALL GOOD FOR AMERICA.

97
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:19,488
NONE OF THAT IS SERIOUSLY UNDER

98
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,189
DISCUSSION TODAY.

99
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,624
INSTEAD, WE GET MOMENTS LIKE

100
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,258
THESE.

101
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,128
>> WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS A

102
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:26,962
SIN AGAINST GOD.

103
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:27,763
I BELIEVE THAT.

104
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:34,770
>> IF THE OF ALL PEOPLE AS MADE

105
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,405
THE COUNTRY NOT TO CLAMOR FOR

106
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:37,773
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING

107
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:40,409
TO END.

108
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,211
>> THOSE WHO SELECTIVELY USE THE

109
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,279
BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THIS CRUELTY

110
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,816
ARE IGNORING A CENTRAL TENET OF

111
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:48,250
CHRISTIANITY.

112
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,318
SAID, SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN

113
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,152
UNTO ME.

114
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:53,188
HE DID NOT SAY, LET THE CHILDREN

115
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,957
SUFFER.

116
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,392
>> Tucker: A A SIN AGAINST

117
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:57,659
GOD.

118
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,162
WHAT YOU ARE HEARING IS NOT

119
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:01,196
POLITICAL DEBATE.

120
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,197
IT IS THEOLOGY.

121
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:05,133
IT'S NOT BASED IN REASON, BUT IN

122
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,635
SOMETHING DEEPER, SOMETHING LESS

123
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:08,570
PREDICTABLE AND MORE FEROCIOUS.

124
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:11,073
IT IS A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT,

125
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,441
THOSE ARE NOT RESOLVABLE WHICH

126
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:15,077
IS WHY YOU ARE TOLD NOT TO START

127
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,412
THEM AT THE DINNER TABLE.

128
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:18,447
RELIGIOUS DISPUTES PUSH PEOPLE

129
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:18,980
INTO EXTREMISM.

130
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:20,315
IF I THINK YOUR IDEAS ARE WRONG,

131
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,184
I'M HAPPY TO ARGUE WITH YOU

132
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,119
ABOUT THEM BUT IF I DECIDE YOU

133
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,455
ARE EVIL, I MAY BE TEMPTED TO

134
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,923
HURT YOU, IF ONLY IN

135
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:28,357
SELF-DEFENSE.

136
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:31,026
POLITICS LIKE THIS ISN'T REALLY

137
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:36,431

155
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,520
IN MAKING SURE THAT IF SOMEONE

156
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,523
IS GOING TO BE SICK, IF SOMEONE

EMERGENCY ROOM.

162

>> Tucker: WHAT ABOUT NOT

163
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:18,774
PAYING FOR IT AT ALL?

164
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,776

165
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:23,078
PEOPLE DIE IN YOUR EMERGENCY

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

168
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,950
BETO O'ROURKE IS NOT STUPID BUT

169
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,985
HE HAS DEVELOPED A HABIT OF MIND

170
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:32,020
THAT LEAVES NO ROOM FOR A

171
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:32,754
LEGITIMATE DISAGREEMENT WITH HIS

172
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:33,155

173
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,257
IF YOU ARE OPPOSED TO PAYING FOR

175
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:38,994

PEOPLE DIE, YOUR MORALLY

177

CORRUPT.

178
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:42,130
WHY WOULD ANYONE WASTE TIME

179
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,066
TRYING TO REASON WITH A MONSTER

180
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,667
LIKE THAT?

181
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:50,939
WOULD YOU DEBATE HUMAN RIGHTS

182
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,174
WITH IDI AMIN?

183
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:53,976
OF COURSE NOT.

184
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:55,610
FACTS ARE IRRELEVANT.

185
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:56,378

WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA HACKED

191
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,395
JOHN PODESTA'S EMAIL ACCOUNT

192
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,130
DURING THE ELECTION.

193
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:16,832
HE MIGHT BE THE PERSON WHO HAS

194
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,033
THE ANSWER TO THAT, HE'S THE

195
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,002
RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE

196
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:21,403
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

197
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,938
WATCH HOW HE RESPONDED.

198
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,373
>> Tucker: CAN YOU LOOK INTO

199
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,575
THE CAMERA AND SAY, I KNOW FOR A

200
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:29,277
FACT THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS

201
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,446
BEHIND THE HACKS?

202
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,216
>> I KNOW ABSOLUTELY.

203
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,317
NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES

204
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:35,851
BUT ALSO IN EUROPE.

205
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:38,954
>> Tucker: YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU

206
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:41,323
ARE DODGING -- LOOK AND SAY, I

207
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:41,857
KNOW THEY HACKED IT.

208
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:46,495
>> I THINK RONALD        RONALDE

209
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:46,528
>> I THINK RONALD        RONALDG

210
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:46,728
>> I THINK RONALD        RONALDN

211
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:46,762
>> I THINK RONALD        RONALDW

212
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:46,795
>> I THINK RONALD        RONALDU

213
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:48,263
>> I THINK RONALD        RONALDD

214
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:50,365
BE ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE --

215
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,567
>> Tucker: YOU ARE -- YOU

216
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:53,602
CAN'T SAY THEY HACKED --

217
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:57,406
>> YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE

218
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:58,540
YOUR SHOW TO RUSSIAN TELEVISION.

219
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,876
>> Tucker: IN OTHER WORDS,

220
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:01,977
SCHIFF REPLIED, I DON'T CARE

221
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:02,978
WHAT YOU ARE ASKING.

222
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,580
THE QUESTION IS, WHY YOU ARE

223
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:06,214
ASKING.

224
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,616
AND THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS,

225
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:08,517
BECAUSE YOU ARE A BAD PERSON AND

226
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:13,221
IN THIS CASE A TRAITOR TO YOUR

227
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:13,555
COUNTRY.

228
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:14,456
MOST POLITICAL CONVERSATIONS

229
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:15,757
LOOK LIKE THIS.

230
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,793
WHEN WE DEFEAT SOMEONE, WE KNOW

231
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:18,727
LONGER ARGUE AGAINST WHAT WE

232
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,062
BELIEVE.

233
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,398
WE WAIT UNTIL THEY MAKE A

234
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:30,038
MISTAKE, AND THERE IS NO

235
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:30,439
FORGIVENESS.

236
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,973
THE POINT IS NOT TO MAKE THINGS

237
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,375
RIGHT OR IMPROVE ANYTHING, THE

238
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:42,884
POINT IS TO VANQUISH AN ENEMY.

239
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:47,889
SO LOCK HER UP AND CRIMINAL

240
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,860
GUILT IS FOR COURTS AND JUDGES

241
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,595
TO DECIDE.

242
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:54,963
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS?

243
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,398
THE REVEREND JOHN KASICH WHO IS

244
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,367
THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF OHIO,

245
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:01,603
WATCH WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH

246
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:02,737
HIM, YOU ARE REALLY DISAGREEING

247
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:03,238
WITH GOD.

248
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,773
>> WE HAVE GOT TO START PUTTING

249
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,341
OURSELVES INTO THE SHOES OF

250
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:06,775
OTHER PEOPLE.

251
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:08,977
WE HAVE GOT TO START THINKING

252
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,278
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT

253
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,480
OTHERS SUFFER, AND IF WE HAVE

254
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,817
BEEN SPARED THOSE BY THE GRACE

255
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,752
OF GOD, LET US BE APPRECIATIVE.

256
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:18,553
LET US COUNT OUR BLESSINGS AND

257
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:20,155
LET US REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO

258
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,090
HAVE THE LESS, AND LET'S STOP

259
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:25,193
PUTTING UP WALLS AROUND

260
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:25,927
OURSELVES AND NOT UNDERSTANDING

261
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:28,196
THE PLIGHT, THE TROUBLE IN THE

262
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:29,164
PROBLEMS OF OTHERS.

263
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,465
IT IS NOT RIGHT AND THE LORD

264
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,869
DOESN'T WANT IT, AND OUR PEOPLE

265
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,670
AT THEIR HEARTS WANT TO REACH

266
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:36,138
OUT TO OTHERS.

267
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,640
LOOK WHAT THEY DO IN THESE

268
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,406
STORMS, THEY GO AND RISK PEOPLE

269
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:41,943
THEY DON'T KNOW.

270
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,278
THEY PUT THEM IN THEIR HOMES AND

271
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,181
FEED THEM, THAT'S AMERICA.

272
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,682
>> Tucker: THE LORD DOESN'T

273
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:54,422
WANT IT, SAYS PASTOR K  .

274
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:55,690
WELL WHAT'S EASY TO KNOW AND

275
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:58,560
FORESEE IS, THE PEOPLE IN POWER

276
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,128
CLAIM MORAL AUTHORITY THEY DON'T

277
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:03,198
HAVE IN ORDER TO COMPEL YOU TO

278
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:03,598
OBEY.

279
00:09:03,599 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT HAPPENS?
