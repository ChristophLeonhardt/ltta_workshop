TRUMP WENT TO FRANCE AND HE
CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE UNITED STATES ENTERING
WORLD WAR I.
AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR THESE KINDS
OF COMMEMORATIONS THERE WAS A
BIG MILITARY SPECTACLE AND
PARADE.
DONALD TRUMP WAS SO TAKEN WITH
IT THAT HE DECIDED TO THE
PRESIDENT OF FRANCE THAT HE
WANTS TO DO ONE OF THOSE
HIMSELF.
THIS IS TYPICAL TRUMP, HE
THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT, IT IS
CONSISTENT, WITH WHAT HE HAS
SAID IN THE PAST.
THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID
ABOUT THIS.
OF COURSE THE FIRST THING I
THOUGHT OF WAS JULY 4 WEEKEND
HE'S GOING TO BE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE?
HE WILL BE IN THE HAMPTONS OR
SOMEPLACE ELSE.
WHAT THIS SPEAKS TO,
THIS WHOLE IDEA ñ
WHERE DO PEOPLE HEAR AND SEE
THESE THINGS.
BLACK-AND-WHITE FILMS FROM THE
HISTORY CHANNEL OF PEOPLE
MARCHING UP CHAMPS TO
THE ARC TO
TRIUMPH.
HE FOR HIS INAUGURATION ASKED
SOMETHING WORTH COMMEMORATING.
WHEN TRUMP SEES THE
SORT OF THING ñ
HE WANTED TO DO THIS FOR HIS
INAUGURATION.
HE LOVES THIS STUFF BUT IT SHOWS
THESE ARE THE STRAINS OF AN
AUTHORITARIAN.
THIS IS NOT JUST AMERICA PROUD.
THIS IS SCARY STUFF, THE KIND OF
STUFF THAT AUTHORITARIAN WANTS.
ALSO IF ANYONE IN OUR AUDIENCE
DOESN'T BUY INTO THE
AUTHORITARIAN WHICH IS A GREAT
POINT, KEEP IN MIND THAT TRUMP
ARGUED THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO
BAN TRANSGENDER MILITARY
MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO
COSTLY.
STUDIES OF INDICATED THAT IS NOT
THE CASE.
TAKING THEM OUT OF THE MILITARY
AND REPLACING THEM WOULD BE
INSANELY COSTLY, BUT YOU HAVE
THE RESOURCES ON A MILITARY
PARADE WHICH IS COMPLETELY
UNNECESSARY.
BUT YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP
PAY FOR THE MEDICAL BILLS
OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE WILLING
TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
THEIR GENDER IDENTITY.
IS SO ENRAGING.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF HIS
SUPPORTERS WOULD WANT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS BUT THOSE PARADES ARE
NOT FREE.
THAT IS OUR TAXPAYER MONEY GOING
TOWARD SOMETHING THAT MAKES
DONALD TRUMP FEEL GOOD ABOUT
HIMSELF.
BUT THIS IS GOLD BUILDINGS
GUY.
YOU THINK OF IT AS AN
UNNECESSARY EXPENSE, HE THINKS
OF IT AS SOMETHING HE HAS TO DO
FOR BRANDING FOR TEAM TRUMP.
AND IT IS WORTH IT FOR HIM.
BUT IT IS ABOUT ñ THIS IS MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?
RIGHT?
THIS
IS THE COMING HOME FROM THE WAR,
THE KIND OF THING THAT DONALD
TRUMP WOULD LATCH ONTO.
YOU READ THE PIECE OF HIS
STATEMENT ON IT ñ
I WANT US TO ALSO PLAY THE FULL
VERSION BECAUSE IT FEEDS
INTO WHAT HIS MOTIVATIONS ARE.
AND ALSO BRINGING UP ñ WHEN HE
PLAN TO BRING THOSE MILITARY
VEHICLES AND MEMBERS INTO HIS
INAUGURATION HE ASKED FOR
PICTURES FROM THE PENTAGON.
HE SAID CAN YOU GUYS SEND ME
PICTURES OF THINGS I CAN USE.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE
VIDEO.
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF
FRANCE AND TRUMP.
I WAS YOUR GUESTS ñ IT WAS
ONE OF THE GREATEST PRAISE I HAD
EVER SEEN.
IT WAS TWO HOURS AND IT WAS
MILITARY MIGHT.
I THINK IT WAS A TREMENDOUS
THING FOR THE SPIRIT OF FRANCE.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT GREAT
WARRIORS THEY ARE IN FRANCE.
TO SEE THAT IT WAS A TREMENDOUS
THING.
TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE OF
WHAT I WITNESSED, WE MAY DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON JULY 4 IN
WASHINGTON DOWN PENNSYLVANIA
AVENUE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO
TURN A TOPIC, BUT WE HAVE A
LOT OF PLANES GOING OVER, A LOT
OF MILITARY MIGHT.
IT WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL THING
TO SEE.
WHEN I CAME BACK IN ONE OF MY
EARLY CALLS WERE ñ WE ARE
ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT FOURTH
OF JULY, PENNSYLVANIA
AVENUE HAVING A GREAT PARADE TO
SHOW OUR MILITARY STRENGTH.
ONE OF MY FIRST CALLS WHEN I
GOT BACK WAS TO PLAN A PARADE.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH YOUR INAUGURATION NUMBER
ONE, OUR MILITARY
STRENGTH TO WHO?
IT IS ALL ABOUT SHOWING POWER.
OH, FRANCE DID IT, I WAS SO
IMPRESSED BECAUSE I AM A
10-YEAR-OLD.
AFTER WANTING TO DO IT, I HAVE
TO DO IT BETTER THAN YOU.
THE
ARROGANCE TO DO IT ON JULY 4
IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPEACHMENT
HEARINGS.
I LOVE PARADES THOUGH.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A
BASKETBALL/FOOTBALL GAME
WITH A FLYOVER?
YEAH, IT IS COOL.
THE THREAT THAT WAS AWESOME
ABOUT ñ IT WAS LIKE AND I HAVE
TANKS?
A LOT OF TANKS ACTUALLY
DISPERSE THE PRESSURE A LOT MORE
THAN CARS DO SO IT IS LESS OF A
FOOTPRINT ON THE ACTUAL STREET.
CAN WE JUST GET HIM A G.I.
JOE KIT AND HAVE HIM DISTRACTED?
BUT YOU KNOW THEY WERE LIKE
LISTEN, WE KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT, WE WILL GIVE HIM A COUPLE
PLANES AND DO A FLYOVER AND
HE WILL BE HAPPY.
THAT
IS TRUE AND THAT IS HOW YOU FEEL
THEY APPEASE HIM CONSTANTLY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
U.S. PRESIDENTS ARE ALLOWED AND
REQUIRED TO PLAN THEIR OWN
FUNERALS.
PART OF WHAT THEY DO IS THEY
SIT DOWN EARLY IN THEIR
PRESIDENCY TO PLAN THEIR STATE
FUNERALS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HIS PLAN
IS?
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WILL
GO INTO THAT FUNERAL.
THE FLYOVERS AND THE MILITARY
AND THE MIGHT.
AND IF YOU ARE AT THE FUNERAL
YOU HAVE TO CRIME.
ALL THESE THINGS SOUND EXACTLY
LIKE THAT.
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH DICTATORIAL
REGIMES.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
I THOUGHT OF THAT WHEN I HEARD
THE STORY.
IT HAS TO STOP.
