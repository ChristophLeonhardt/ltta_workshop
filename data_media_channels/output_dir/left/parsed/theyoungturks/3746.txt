THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES
THAT'S JUST NOTHING BUT FUN.
IT'S ABOUT SEAN HANNITY,
APPARENTLY HE GOT JEALOUS OF
LAWRENCE O'DONNELL'S OUTTAKES SO
SOMEONE LEAKED THAT HE'S GOT HIS
OWN, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS DURING
THE SHOW WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO
A VIDEO CLIP, THIS IS WHAT HE
DOES WHILE THE AUDIENCE IS
WATCHING THE VIDEO.
HARRY
SHEARER GOT HIS HANDS ON THIS,
APPARENTLY HE HAS A SOURCE
INSIDE FOX NEWS, THIS IS FUN,
THIS STORY WAS GOING TO BE
NOTHING BUT FUN, I DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY UNTIL HANNITY
RESPONDED, NOW I HAVE TO RESPOND
TO HIS RESPONSE.
BUT FIRST,
LET'S WATCH.
WATCH THIS --
ALL RIGHT, THERE HE GOES --
LOOKS LIKE THE PENGUIN THERE A
LITTLE BIT.
DEPENDS ON YOUR TAKE ON IT, IF
YOU ARE A SMOKER YOU MIGHT FIND
IT NOT SO BAD.
THERE HE IS, THAT
STERN LOOK, DOING THE MARCO
RUBIO, NO PROBLEM.
A LITTLE
SCRATCH, MAYBE WORKING THE
EARPIECE -- AND GAME FACE, GO!
 OKAY, REALLY NO BIG
DEAL.
HE APPARENTLY VAPES.
WHAT
IS IN THERE?
AMERICA WANTS TO
KNOW.
WE MIGHT NOT FIND OUT.
PRESUMABLY TOBACCO.
HANNITY THEN
TWEETS OUT IN RESPONSE TO THIS
--
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THOUGHT
IT WAS A CIGARETTE, IT LOOKED
LIKE HE WAS VAPING THE WHOLE
TIME, HENCE THE GRAPHIC.
BUT
THAT'S FINE, SO FAR STILL NO
STORY, IT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK THAT
BAD, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY BUT IT'S
NO BIG DEAL AT ALL.
THEN HE SAYS
THIS --
OF COURSE LIBERALS ALSO DRINK
BEER AND VODKA AND DO MANY OTHER
THINGS.
BUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND US, SEAN, IS
THAT WE DON'T JUDGE YOU FOR IT.
I DON'T CARE THAT YOU ARE
VAPING, I DON'T EVEN CARE IF
THERE'S WEED IN THERE.
I DON'T
WANT TO GET IN THE WEEDS ON THIS
STORY -- WE ACTUALLY WANT TO
LEAVE YOU ALONE, WE AREN'T IN
FAVOR OF BIG GOVERNMENT LIKE YOU
ARE, WE THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE
PERSONAL LIBERTY, IF YOU WANT TO
SMOKE CIGARS OR VAPE HAVE AT IT,
HOSS.
WE AREN'T GOING TO JUDGE
YOU.
BUT YOU GUYS ARE CONSTANTLY
LIKE DON'T DO THIS, DON'T DO
THAT.
IN THIS CASE, NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT WAS IN IT.
OVERALL THOUGH,
SEAN, AM I NOT MERCIFUL?
NOT
GUILTY.
IF YOU WERE GUILTY, I'D
PARDON YOU.
