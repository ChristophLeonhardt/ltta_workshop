when Cupid strikes it's easy to believe that your relationship is perfect but realistically do you think you're more or less happy than the average couple this is why are we all so stupid the show that explores the cognitive biases that lead us to make irrational decisions I'm Sara silverstein and I'm Adam grant over confidence I think we do see it in almost every domain of life there's you know we know that people think that they're smarter they're better looking they're better drivers even than the average person over 90% of people think they're a better driver than average I really want to meet the people who know and admit the worse that were terrible Dreyer I'm an excellent driver I'm a terrible Parker though we asked people what percent of relationships are happier than theirs yeah look I'm trying to be realistic about it but also not totally pessimistic about our own relationship I've never ever met anybody in a better relationship and a better marriage than we have a hundred percent that is nice thanks guys I think that there might be something I've never met them I've never met them 20 I think I'm 95% happier than the rest of the world yeah our marriage okay I feel bad that I put 50 in that no don't feel bad yeah what she said 20 next we ask them what's the probability that their marriage ends in divorce still working it's a percentage honey I wrote less you wrote less that's good I was figuring that we're less than 50% right you get married you have a one in two chance of getting divorced we're definitely less than that what is your say I like him there we go for realistic I mean anything's possible right that's crazy seven there's gotta be a little I'm saying that's what that little one person point 1% is right there our couples on average said they thought only 11% of relationships were happier than theirs but we can't all be above average though most of us think we are and on average people felt their probability of divorce was only 5% we all know it's much higher than that so why are we all so stupid well I think there are three reasons why that can happen the first one is that they're lying to you they just don't want to admit it the second is self-deception they're lying to themselves and they don't want to admit it to themselves or each other but the third is that we most of us suffer from that kind of overconfidence when you know when you go to think about well what is what is the average person's marriage like you want to feel good about your marriage and so you start to think about the most miserable couples you know and that you know that that's also the availability heuristic in action a little bit right because you're changing what's selling it to you but then you know you come out of that and you say to yourself you know what I know a lot of people who have gotten divorced I know a bunch of other people who are heading that way for sure we're great and so if you're trying to overcome the overconfidence bias which most of us aren't trying to but if you are is there a way to combat that well I think you want to start with objective information you know I think if if you're in a situation where you know they're their real quality signal so you didn't you need access to those and so you know if you think you can sing you might want to try out for American Idol and find out if you can sing I think the the problem is for a lot of us what what we're good at is subjective it's a matter of taste as opposed to objective quality and I think we then need feedback sources that we can really trust who will let us know whether our work is good or not the problem is though that that can push us too far and you know you know what you really don't want is JK Rowling to say you know six publishers rejected Harry Potter I guess I can't write yeah that's why we have so many like people keep opening restaurants and people keep getting married and we still have entrepreneurs and and people trying to write young adult novels that's good yeah I think confidence is I mean we know it's powerful for motivation it's a huge force of it's a huge force behind grit and persistence the problem is though that sometimes it leads us to persist with the wrong choices the wrong projects the wrong partners and so you know we just need to be a little bit careful it's a tightrope walk and you can fall off either side from earlier when I think of how difficult I am you know is this like me I can see her just being like I think we're done here all right so yeah so far I've been enjoying myself yeah no I think that we have a 75% chance of success nice next time and why are we all so stupid do you think there are over or under 6,000 jelly beans in this jar how many jelly beans do you think there are exactly follow our page so you don't miss an episode
