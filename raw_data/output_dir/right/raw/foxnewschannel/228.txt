1
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:04,951
>> Ed: I APPRECIATE THE

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:05,752
REPORT.

3
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:08,889
JOINING ME NOW IS BYRON YORK.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,291
GOOD EVENING.

5
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:12,592
>> GOOD EVENING.

6
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:13,660
>> Ed: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

7
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:14,494
IT?

8
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:15,829
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER?

9
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,998
BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WONDERING

10
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,232
IF HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE

11
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,367
HELD ACCOUNTABLE AT ALL FOR

12
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,005
THE SERVER ISSUE.

13
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:26,740
ONE WONDERS IF THIS IS

14
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:27,974
SOMETHING SHE WAS NO LONGER

15
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:29,442
USING AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT

16
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,879
UP OR KNEW A BLISTERING REPORT

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,381
WAS COMING AND WANTED TO SAY

18
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:35,849
I'LL VOLUNTARILY GIVE IT UP

19
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,084
BEFORE IT'S TAKEN AWAY.

20
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,754
>> NOTHING DID HAPPEN WITH THE

21
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:42,455
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

22
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:44,524
THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL.

23
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,827
NOW I THINK THE IDEA THAT AT

24
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:51,798
HER REQUEST IT WAS ENDED GIVES

25
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,500
HER A WAY TO THEY LOOK.

26
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,834
THIS WASN'T DISCIPLINARY

27
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:55,168
ACTION.

28
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:57,003
I HAVE NO LONGER USED IT.

29
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,340
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

30
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,942
IMPORTANT TO ME ANY MORE.

31
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,243
BUT GIVEN THAT THE

32
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:05,111
ADMINISTRATION HAD ALREADY

33
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:07,047
DONE THIS, WITH JOHN BRENNAN,

34
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:08,815
THE FORMER C.I.A. DIRECTOR WHO

35
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:13,353
REALLY BASHES THE PRESIDENT AT

36
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:14,554
EVERY OPPORTUNITY THESE DAYS I

37
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,722
THINK PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK AT

38
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:17,590
THIS AND SAY WHAT WENT ON

39
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,092
BEHIND THIS WITHDRAWN OF

40
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:19,526
CLEARANCE?

41
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:23,496
>> YEAH.

42
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,298
INTERESTING.

43
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,300
ISN'T IT WHAT INFURIATES

44
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,435
PEOPLE, JAMES COMEY AND HIS

45
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,303
ROLE AND WHAT HE DID AND

46
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,504
DIDN'T DO?

47
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:33,840
YEARS LATER SHE SURRENDERS THE

48
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,541
SECURITY CLEARANCE AND DOESN'T

49
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,042
HAVE IT STRIPPED.

50
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:40,780
MANY WONDER HAS THERE BEEN ANY

51
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:41,247
ACCOUNTABILITY?

52
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:42,515
HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING TO

53
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:43,183
HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE?

54
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:44,851
>> THE KEY ISSUE, OF COURSE,

55
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:48,221
IN HER SECRET E-MAIL SERVER

56
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:52,425
WAS THAT SHE SENT CLASSIFIED

57
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,494
INFORMATION OVER UNCLASSIFIED,

58
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:57,030
UNSECURED SYSTEM.

59
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,833
THERE IS NOVEMBER DOUBT.

60
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,234
YOU CAN ARGUE IF IT'S SUPER

61
00:02:01,235 --> 00:00:00,000
IMPORTANT STUFF OR NOT BUT THE
