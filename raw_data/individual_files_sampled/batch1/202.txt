let's go be game day Philadelphia host of the 2018 National Football League season opener and home to the Eagles 2018 Super Bowl champs but this year fans are talking about what will happen during the national anthem as much as what will happen on the field I was a captain in the Air Force so I don't like the players taking a knee I think I should respect the anthem they live in the country okay and respect the people that actually fighting for it every day fellas that are kneeling during a national anthem it's a positive thing it's they're trying to bring about change which is always good because it needs to happen former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started a national debate and movement among players when he bucked tradition and took a knee rather than stand during the ceremonial opening of games in the 2016 season to know ask if your dreams are crazy asking for crazy enough it's a debate this Nike ad campaign scheduled to air during the game has only reignited Kaepernick wanted to call attention to racial injustice in the United States at a time when police misconduct was under fire but his critics see kneeling as a sign of disrespect for those in law enforcement and the military who put their lives on the line for American ideals those critics include President Donald Trump himself the national anthem debate is as divisive as politics itself in the United States right now and perhaps nowhere exemplifies those divisions more than Pennsylvania a traditionally democratic and blue-collar state but one that voted for Donald Trump and helped propel him to the presidency it was the president who broke tradition when he uninvited the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House after some members of the championship team said they would stay home in protest hitting the players against the president we believe everyone should stand for the national anthem and in the middle unable to come up with a policy that satisfies all sides ahead of opening day it's huge pressure from what Trump's reaction is going to be this is the kind of thing that's a great rallying cry for his base and he is gonna use it with every ounce that he can to jump on top of this to prove that he's right that his base is right and his attitude is the right attitude to have in this for God angry fans have been burning their Nike products and calling for a boycott while the president called on the NFL and Nike to stand for the flag on Twitter that's a worry for the NFL whose ratings are down and a controversy they've yet to tackle christened salumi al Jazeera Philadelphia
