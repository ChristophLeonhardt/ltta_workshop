00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,683
WHY FACEBOOK WANTS YOU TO SEND

NUDE PHOTOS?

21
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,137
>> THAT IS A BIGGER QUESTION.

22
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,872
THEY WANT TO FIGHT REVENGE

23
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,574
PORN WHERE PEOPLE IN

PEOPLE?

29
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,680
>> I BET WE COULD NAME A FEW

30
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,447
BUT WE WON'T.

31
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,516
THEY WANT YOU TO SUBMIT YOUR

00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:52,018
PHOTOS, THE MOST SECRETIVE

33
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,220
PHOTOS YOU HAVE TO FACEBOOK.

34

FINGERPRINT OF THE PICTURE SO

37
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,526
NOT THE PICTURE THEMSELVES.

38
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:02,128
THEY SAY THEY DON'T STORE IT.

39
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,230
IT WILL BE OFF THE SERVER IN A

40
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,765
FEW DAYS AND THEY WILL BLOCK

41
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,099

43
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:08,968
HERE IS THE PROBLEM, LAURA.

44
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,636
WHO IS LOOKING AT THESE

48
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,440
THE BIGGER QUESTION FACEBOOK

50
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:17,677
LAST YEAR THEY ADMITTED TO.

51
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,411
IN MARCH.

52
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,345
THEY ADMITTED TO THIS.

53
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,247
HOW SURE ARE WE THEY CAN

54
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,082
PROTECT THE IMAGES AND THAT

55
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,784
THE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT

56
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,620
CATCHPYING THEM -- COPYING

57
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,021

00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,357
PEOPLE HAVE OTHER NUDE PHOTOS.

60
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,628
THIS WHOLE THING IS -- FORGET

00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:39,832
WE'LL CALL THIS THE END OF THE

CIVILIZATION SEGMENT.

64
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,035
TOMMY, MAKE A NEW GRAPHIC.

65
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,503
TOMMY IS LIKE I DON'T MAKE

66
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:44,937
GRAPHICS.

67
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:45,805

WE CALL THESE PEOPLE BOOMERANG

74
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:55,581
BATS.

75
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,183
YOU THROW THEM OUT TO THE

76
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,784
WORLD AND THEN THEY COME BACK

77
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,852
AND STAY AT HOME.

78
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,786
>> A 30-YEAR-OLD WHO SAYS

79
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,021
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO BE A

HE HAS A CHILD OF HIS OWN.

82
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,191
I'M TRYING TO BE A FATHER AND

83
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,292
I NEED TO LIVE WITH MOM AND

84
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:06,659
DAD.

85
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,094
THEY GAVE HIM FIVE NOTICES TO

86
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,561
GET OUT.

87
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,096
FIVE EVICTION NOTICES.

88
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,297
THEY DEPRIVED HIM OF FOOD.

89
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,999
>> IS THAT HIM?

90
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,400
>> HE SAT WITH ANOTHER NETWORK

91
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,603
AND SAID THIS.

95
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,213
RESOLVE THIS WITHOUT THE

96
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:27,813
COURT?

97
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,081
>> I WOULD CONSIDER MUCH OF

98
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,483
WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO TRY TO

99
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,287
GET ME OUT AS ATTACKS.

100

HOW ABOUT GET A HAIRCUT?

104
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,763
IT LOOKS LIKE COUSIN IT.

105
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,830
THAT WAS SCARY.

106
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,265
>> HERE IS THE SCARY THING.

107
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,234
A THIRD OF THE MILLENNIALS ARE

108
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,235

HAIR.

113
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,812
HE DOESN'T HAVE MONEY FOR

114
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,246
HAIRCUT.

115
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:00,780
>> TOUGH TIMES.

116
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,847

HOME GYM WITH NO COUCHES OR

121
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,753
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

122
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:08,988

123
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,089
THEM -- THE JUDGE RULED THAT

124
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,791
THE KID HAS TO VACATE, THE MAN

125
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,758
HAS TO VACATE.

126
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,794

PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

129
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,531
I HOPE THAT IS FOR THE PARENT

130
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,166
AND NOT FOR THE SON.

131
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,634

SHE HELD HER HEAD UP WITH

146
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,695

OPENS, I'M HOPING IT'S THE

WINE CELLAR.

171
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,004
THIS COMMUNITY HAS A HISTORY
