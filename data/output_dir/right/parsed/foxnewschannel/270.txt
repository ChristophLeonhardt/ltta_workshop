STEVE: YOU WILL HEARING
CHAINSAWS ALL DAY LONG.
GRIFF JENKINS, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
AINSLEY: JOINING US ON THE PHONE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA, DONALD TRUMP.
GOOD MORNING, MR. PRESIDENT,
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU, AINSLEY.
AINSLEY: GOOD MORNING.
WE SAW GRIFF'S A REPORT ON THE
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.
WHAT WILL THE RECOVERY LOOK
LIKE?
>> IT IS GOING TO GO FAST.
WE'LL MAKE IT GO FAST.
WE'RE FOLLOWING IT IN.
IT IS GONE FROM CERTAIN AREAS.
ONE THING WE HAVE TO OUR
ADVANTAGE WAS THE SPEED.
THIS THING WAS IN AND OUT.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN POWER LIKE THAT.
I WAS GET REPORTS ALL NIGHT.
170, 180 MILES AN HOUR WINDS, AT
ONE POINT IT REACHED 200 MILES
AN HOUR.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE.
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY
STRONGER WIND, THIS IS IN
HISTORY.
IT WAS POWERFUL.
IT WAS A SPEEDSTER AND IT WAS IN
AND NOW IT IS OUT.
IT IS IN GEORGIA.
I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR.
THEY ARE HANDLING IT VERY WELL,
THE WINDS ARE DOWN TO 60 MILES
AN HOUR.
WHICH IS A LOT.
60 MILES AN HOUR.
IT IS DISSIPATING AND IT WAS
FAST.
STEVE: YOU'RE A FLORIDA PROPERTY
OWNER.
I
VOICE -- VISIT THE FOLKS IN THE
PANHANDLE.
YOU TOOK THE HEAT,
MR. PRESIDENT, GOING AHEAD WITH
THE PENNSYLVANIA RALLY LAST
NIGHT?
>> I THINK REALLY WHEN I
EXPLAINED IT THERE WAS NO HEAT.
I HAD VERY LITTLE HEAT OTHER
THAN THE NATURAL HATERS WHICH
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME.
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
STANDING IN LINE.
IT IS A GREAT THING THAT IS
HAPPENING.
IT'S A GREAT MOVEMENT IN OUR
COUNTRY.
I MAKE A SPEECH IN 12,000 SEAT
AUDITORIUM.
PEOPLE START LINING UP TWO DAYS
EARLY.
LITERALLY THEY BRING TENTS.
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED
UP BY THE TIME I HAD TO MAKE A
DECISION.
IS MY DECISION, TELL PEOPLE
WAITING 10, 12 HOURS ALREADY,
THAT I'M NOT COMING?
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE --
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE.
YOU SAW THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN THE
AUDITORIUM WHICH HELD ABOUT
12,000 PEOPLE, IT WAS FULL AND
WE HAD 20 OR 25,000 PEOPLE
OUTSIDE WATCHING SCREENS.
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY GET THERE
THAT EARLY AND, YOU KNOW, THAT
AREA OBVIOUSLY IS NOT AFFECTED
AT ALL BY IT, WE HAD IT UNDER
GREAT CONTROL BECAUSE FEMA AND
EVERYTHING ELSE, WE HAD
WHITE HOUSE ON THE PLANE --
STEVE: YOU WERE MONITORING.
>> I WAS TOTALLY MONITORING.
I MADE THE SPEECH.
EVERYBODY WAS UNHAPPY.
IT WOULD BE REALLY UNFAIR TO ALL
THE PEOPLE WAITING.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNFAIR,
I DON'T THINK REALLY THE HEAT
WAS VERY HOT.
RELATIVE TO OTHER THINGS I THINK
IT WAS VERY MINOR.
BRIAN: MR. PRESIDENT TODAY AT
LUNCH WILL NOT BE ANY NORMAL
LUNCH.
YOU WILL HAVE ONE OF THE
GREATEST ATHLETES AND ACTIVISTS
IN AMERICAN HISTORY, JIM BROWN.
AMAN WHO WAS TOLD IN COLLEGE
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK HE COULDN'T
STAY WITH HIS TEAM SYRACUSE ON
THE ROAD.
ALSO WITH KANYE WEST.
YOU WILL TALK SUBSTANCE.
THESE ARE TWO YEAR SUPPORTERS.
WHAT DO YOU HOPE COMES OUT OF
THE MEETING?
FRIENDSHIP IS.
THERE MUTUAL RESPECT IS ALREADY
APPARENT.
WHAT SUBSTANTIVE CAN COME OUT OF
THE MEETING?
>> BRIAN, I HAVE A LOT OF
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT AND A
LOT DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST
LITTLE WHILE WITH KANYE COMING
OUT.
JIM BROWN HAS BEEN THERE A LONG
TIME.
I HAVE KNOWN HIM, RESPECTED HIM.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM PLAYING IN
THE NFL WHAT HE WOULD BE MAKING?
DOUBLE WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS
GETTING.
HE WAS THE GREATEST.
HE CAME OUT A LONG TIME AGO FOR
ME, WHEN IT WAS MUCH LESS
FASHIONABLE FRANKLY AND NOW YOU
SEE THE RESULTS.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST, IF YOU LOOK
AT UNEMPLOYMENT, IF YOU LOOK AT
ANY STATISTIC, LOWEST
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN HISTORY, IN
HISTORY.
THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME,
INCOME, THINK OF IT, HIGHEST IN
HISTORY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS OF
THE NOW THAT INCLUDES ALSO
SEPARATELY ASIAN-AMERICANS,
HISPANIC-AMERICANS.
WE HAVE THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT
NUMBERS, THE BEST MEDIAN INCOME
NUMBERS.
CRIME RATES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES
WHERE YOU HAVE A REALLY BAD, BAD
NUMBER FOR YEARS.
YOU'VE HAD TERRIBLE NUMBERS.
THOSE CRIME RATES ARE COMING
DOWN.
IN CHICAGO WHICH IS RUN BY
DEMOCRATS I SAID JUST YESTERDAY,
I SAID WE'RE GOING TO GET
INVOLVED IN CHICAGO.
IT IS RIDICULOUS WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN CHICAGO.
THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT.
SO WE'LL GET INVOLVED AND TRY TO
WORK WITH THE MAYOR IF THAT IS
POSSIBLE.
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS ANYBODY'S
INVOLVEMENT.
WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.
BRIAN: HE WILL BE OUT OF THERE
SON ANYWAY.
>> HE WILL BE GONE --
BRIAN: MR. PRESIDENT, JIM BROWN
GOT A CURRICULUM.
HE HAS BEEN WORKING IN PRISONS
20 YEARS WITH HIS AMERICAN
PROGRAM.
WOULD YOU BE TEMPTED TO ADOPT
HIS PROGRAM WHOLESALE?
>> WELL, WHAT'S HAPPENING, JIM
HE GETS IT, VERY MUCH GETS IT.
AND I GET IT.
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR
REALLY LONG TERMS, LIKE
MRS. JOHNSON AS AN EXAMPLE, SHE
HAD ANOTHER 22 YEARS TO SERVE.
SHE WAS IN THERE FOR 20 YEARS.
SHE IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE
WOMAN, HOW THIS WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED.
MAYBE IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME, A
DIFFERENT AGE BUT WE DO NEED
REFORM.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN EASY.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE CERTAIN
CATEGORIES TOUGHER WHEN IT COMES
TO DRUG DEALING AND OTHER THINGS
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A REFORM
BECAUSE IT IS VERY UNFAIR RIGHT
NOW OF THE IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO EVERYBODY
AND IT IS ALSO VERY COSTLY.
SOME OF THE, IF YOU LOOK WHAT
THEY HAVE DONE IN TEXAS, THEY
HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.
TEXAS IS THOUGHT OF BEING A
TOUGH STATE AND ALSO GEORGIA,
GOVERNOR DIEHL.
THEY HAVE DONE, THOSE TWO STATES
HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB.
THEY'RE TOUGH, THEY'RE FIRM, BUT
THEY HAVE REALLY DONE A
TREMENDOUS JOB WITH REFORM.
AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT
WITH BIG JIM BROWN, WHO IS AN
AMAZING -- I HAVE A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WITH
AFRICAN-AMERICAN GREAT ATHLETES.
LOOK AT EVANDER HOLYFIELD,
HERSCHEL WALKER, I HAVE SO MANY
ATHLETES AND STARS THAT ARE
SUPPORTING ME BECAUSE WHEN THEY
LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
WHICH IS THE BEST EVER, THEY
LOOK AT THE INCOME THAT
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE MAKING
UNTRUMP COMPARED TO WHAT --
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO YEARS
AGO.
STEVE: MR. PRESIDENT --
>> SO IT'S REALLY, REALLY BEEN
PRETTY AMAZING.
STEVE: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STARS ONE OF
THEM IS KANYE WEST.
YOU WILL HAVE LUNCH WITH HIM
TODAY.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
STEVE: HE PUBLICLY WORE THE MAGA
HAT WE'RE SHOWING RIGHT THERE,
HE CAME OUT AFTER "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE," HOW HE WAS GOTTEN
PUSHED AROUND AND TOLD NOT TO DO
STUFF DURING THE WEEK, HE HAS
TAKEN A LOT OF HEAT FOR BEING
YOUR SUPPORTER.
HARD TO BE A SUPPORTER WHEN
PEOPLE ARE GANGING UP ON YOU.
>> I TELL YOU, FIRST OF ALL, I
LIKE HIM A LOT.
HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE.
I'VE KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME.
HE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF A
GUY, I SAY THAT IN POSITIVE WAY.
HE IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF A
GUY.
THOSE IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS SAY
HE IS A GENIUS.
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.
WHEN KANYE CAME OUT COUPLE
MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING HAPPENED,
MY POLLS WENT UP 25%.
NOBODY EVER SEEN IT.
HE HAS A BIG FOLLOWING IN THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
A BIG, BIG FOLLOWING.
I THINK HE HAS IN A LET OF
COMMUNITIES, BUT THE POLLS WENT
THROUGH THE ROOF.
I HAVE NOT SEEN, I THINK I HAVE
HONESTLY SAID I NEVER SEEN THAT
BEFORE TO THAT EXTENT.
HE IS RESPECTED.
HE IS REALLY A GREAT GUY.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS?
HE IS NOT ASKING ANYTHING FOR
HIMSELF.
HE DOESN'T SAY GEE, I WANT TO DO
THIS OR THAT.
HE IS A PRIVATE GUY.
HE WANTS TO HELP PEOPLE.
MORE THAN ANYTHING IS PRISON
REFORM BECAUSE HIS WIFE, WAS
TERRIFIC, KIM.
SHE BROUGHT THE ATTENTION TO
MRS. JOHNSON WHERE I COULD LOOK.
YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE LIKE
MRS. JOHNSON IN JAIL FOR ANOTHER
35 YEARS ON A CHARGE THAT
FRANKLY EVERYTHING IS SERIOUS,
BUT YOU DON'T GET LIFE IN
PRISONMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE
TALKING OVER A TELEPHONE ABOUT
SOMETHING.
BRIAN: I HEARD YOUR ATTORNEY
GENERAL DOESN'T WANT PRISON
REFORM.
JEFF SESSIONS STANDING IN YOUR
WAY IS THAT ACCURATE?
>> IF HE DOESN'T, HE GETS
OVERRULED BY ME.
I MAKE THE DECISION, HE DOESN'T.
AINSLEY: WE SEE YOU CAMPAIGNING
WITH KANYE WEST IN THE FUTURE,
EVERYONE SHOULD ADMIRE HIM FOR
AT LEAST STANDING UP AGAINST ALL
OF HIS FRIENDS IN HOLLYWOOD AND
SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT THEY
SAY, DO YOU THINK, WILL WE SEE
YOU ON THE ROAD WITH HIM
CAMPAIGNING?
>> I COULD IT.
I COULD SEE IT.
WE WENT TO INDIANA WITH
BOBBY KNIGHT AND THAT IS A BIG
DEAL.
WHEN YOU HAVE BOBBY KNIGHT, WE
WON INDIANA MANY, MANY POINTS, I
MIGHT HAVE HAVE WON IT ANYWAY
WHEN YOU HAVE BOBBY KNIGHT IN
INDIAN NARCS WE HAVE KANYE,
TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM SO MANY
PEOPLE.
THOSE PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD THAT
YOU HEAR ABOUT, EVEN THE ONES
THAT DO A LITTLE TALKING BECAUSE
THEY THINK IT'S COOL, THEY VOTE
FOR TRUMP, MANY OF THEM VOTE FOR
TRUMP.
I HEARD SOME OF THEM VOTE FOR
TRUMP.
THEY GET IN THE BOOTH, LOOK
AROUND AND PRESS THE TRUMP
STICKER BECAUSE THEY DO.
YOU KNOW, SORT OF, IT IS SORT OF
A JOKE IN HOLLYWOOD.
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE MANY FRIENDS
OUT THERE, MANY HOLLYWOOD
FRIENDS BUT I HAVE MANY FRIENDS.
THEY'RE SAYING SO MANY OF THE
PEOPLE YOU SEE TALKING ABOUT ME,
MAYBE IT IS FASHIONABLE AND
MAYBE IT IS NOT FASHIONABLE,
THEY VOTE FOR ME.
THEY GET IN THAT BOOTH THEY'RE
DIFFERENT.
