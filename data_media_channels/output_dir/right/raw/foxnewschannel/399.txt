6
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,650
TOP RANKING DEMOCRATS.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:27,497
YOU ARE BUSY.

18
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:30,066

00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:31,134
LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH GET ON THE

20
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:31,568
SUPREME COURT.

21
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,036
>> Shannon: THE DEMOCRATS

22
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:33,837
DON'T THINK HE SO NICE.

23
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:36,072
I WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT OF

24
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:36,873
BACK-AND-FORTH.

25
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:37,641
THIS STARTED ON TWITTER, AS SO

26
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,943
MANY FIGHTS IN WASHINGTON DO.

27
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:40,811
THIS IS FROM THE SENATE

28
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,078
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE YESTERDAY,

29
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,980
NOWHERE IN ANY OF THESE SIX FBI

30
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:44,981
REPORTS, REFERRING TO THE

31
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:46,283
PREVIOUS BACKGROUND CHECKS,

32
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:47,150
WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED

33
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,419
ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WAS THERE

34
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,054
EVER A WHIFF OF ANY ISSUE AT

35
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:51,721
ALL.

36
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:52,322
RELATED IN ANY WAY TO

37
00:00:52,323 --> 00:00:54,458
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OR

38
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:55,292
ALCOHOL ABUSE.

39
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:55,992
SENATOR DICK DURBIN SAID THE

40
00:00:55,993 --> 00:00:57,894
TWEET IS NOT ACCURATE.

41
00:00:57,895 --> 00:00:58,962
COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS MUST

42
00:00:58,963 --> 00:00:59,362
CORRECT IT.

43
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:02,232
HE SENT A LETTER.

44
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:05,535
WE ONLY DON'T NOTICE THAT TWO

45
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,169
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SIGN IT.

46
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,437
NOTHING IN THE TWEET IS

47
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,505
INACCURATE OR MISLEADING.

48
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:09,840
THE COMMITTEE STANDS BY IT

49
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,342
STATEMENT WHICH IS COMPLETELY

50
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:13,243
TRUTHFUL, MORE BASELESS INNUENDO

51
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:16,880
AND FALSE MIRRORS, WHAT ARE THEY

52
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,916
REFERRING TO, THE DEMOCRATS?

53
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,685
>> I CAN TELL YOU THE FACTS.

54
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,620
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN NOMINATED IN

55
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:24,955
2006, HE'S BEEN ON THE COURT FOR

56
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:25,689
12 YEARS.

57
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,656
SIX BACKGROUND CHECKS BECAUSE HE

58
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:30,560
WORKED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH AS HIS

59
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,563
SECRETARY, PERSONAL SECRETARY,

60
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:37,133
NOT DOING DICTATION BUTTON

61
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:37,834
MANAGING THE OVAL OFFICE,

62
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:39,703
EVERYTHING AROUND THE PRESIDENT.

63
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:41,171
HE HAD A BACKGROUND CHECK TO GET

64
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:43,006
THAT JOB.

65
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,407
I DEREK DICK DURBIN TO GO

66
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:45,275
THROUGH IT.

67
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:46,009
ME TO GO THROUGH, SEE HOW WELL

68
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,477
WE WOULD DO.

69
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:50,680
SO HE'S WRONG.

70
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:51,381
HE'S JUST MAKING UP ANOTHER

71
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:53,149
STORY THAT'S NOT TRUE.

72
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,419
THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS

73
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,153
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT SUGGEST

74
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:57,821
ANYTHING CONSISTENT WITH THE

75
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,356
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM AND IF

76
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:01,124
THEY HAD BEEN THEY WOULD HAVE

77
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,659
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

78
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,226
SO DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

79
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:05,095
DESPICABLE IN THE WAY THEY HAVE

80
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:06,162
TREATED HIM AND IT IS TRUE THERE

81
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:09,799
WAS SOMETHING THERE, THEY ARE

82
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,101
JUST INCOMPETENT.

83
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:11,701
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

84
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,637
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK THERE A

85
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,205
COUPLE OF THINGS.

86
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:16,907
DR. FORD LEGAL TEAMS TODAY,

87
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:17,541
SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS ASKED

88
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,776
NUMEROUS TIMES FOR RECORDINGS OF

89
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:20,544
THE POLYGRAPHS, COMMUNICATIONS

90
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,145
WITH THE MEDIA REGARDING THESE

91
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:22,846
ALLEGATIONS AND HER THERAPIST

92
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:24,714
KNOWS BECAUSE HE SAYS YOU GAVE

93
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,116
SOME OF THEM TO

94
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:27,083
"THE WASHINGTON POST," AT LEAST

95
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:27,517
ACCORDING TO

96
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,319
"THE WASHINGTON POST," WE WANT

97
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,619
THOSE.

98
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,521
TEAM SAYS DR. FORD IS NOW

99
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:32,455
PREPARED TO PROVIDE THOSE

100
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,057
DOCUMENTS TO THE FBI WHEN SHE'S

101
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:34,424
INTERVIEW.

102
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:36,893
WE HAVE NOT HAD STILL NOT YET

103
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,094
HEARD ABOUT THE FBI INTERVIEW.

104
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,095
WON'T GIVE THEM TO COMMITTEE BUT

105
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,897
WILL GIVE THEM TO THE FBI.

106
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:42,432
>> IT'S JUST A GAME.

107
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,935
THEY KEEP PLAYING A GAME AT

108
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:45,702
DR. FORD'S EXPENSE.

109
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:47,137
IF THIS WOULD HELP DR. FORD WHY

110
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:48,905
WOULDN'T THEY GIVE THEM TO US?

111
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,707
THE BOTTOM LINE IS DR. FORD HAS

112
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,374
BEEN USED BY THE DEMOCRATIC

113
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,476
PARTY HERE.

114
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:54,578
THE PERSON WHO BETRAYED HER

115
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,979
TRUST AND LEAKED HER NAME TO THE

116
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,113
MEDIA HAD A POLITICAL AGENDA.

117
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:59,249
IT WAS NOT A FRIEND IN THE

118
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,419
POLITICAL ACTIVIST LAWYERS THAT

119
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,288
WERE GIVEN TO HER BY DEMOCRATIC

120
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,690
SENATOR STAFF MEMBERS I THINK

121
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:07,324
HAVE A LOT TO ACCOUNT FOR.

122
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,259
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS THE MAN I'VE

123
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,860
KNOWN FOR 20 YEARS.

124
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:12,796
HE'S THE MAN YOU SEE IN THE

125
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,797
RECORD AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS

126
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:15,565
HAPPENED TO HIM DURING HIS

127
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,634
CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS

128
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:19,502
DESPICABLE AND IT'S ALL FALLING

129
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:21,137
APART AND IT'S ALWAYS ANOTHER

130
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:21,705
REASON.

131
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:26,376
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE'S A GANG

132
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:27,577
RAPIST, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IS

133
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:28,678
A STUMBLING, BUBBLING DRUNK, HOW

134
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,981
ABOUT THIS, HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE

135
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:32,282
THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A JUDGE.

136
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:33,717
THIS IS THE ONE THAT OFFENDS ME

137
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:34,084
THE MOST.

138
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,452
HOW WOULD YOU REACT IF SOMEBODY

139
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,087
DESTROYED YOUR LIFE AND YOU

140
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,222
FOUND YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THE

141
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:39,956
ENTIRE NATION BEING HUMILIATED,

142
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:41,024
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

143
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:41,725
>> Shannon: THE TOP DEMOCRAT

144
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:45,695
ON THE COMMITTEE, SENATOR DIANNE

145
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:46,396
FEINSTEIN SAYS THIS ABOUT HIM

146
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:47,163
NOT BEING INTERVIEWED, SHE SAYS

147
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:50,066
WHEN HE WASN'T YELLING AND

148
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,101
DEMEANING SENATORS HE WAS MAKING

149
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:52,936
MISLEADING STATEMENTS THAT CAST

150
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,104
DOUBT ON HIS OVERALL

151
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:54,571
TRUSTWORTHINESS.

152
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:56,439
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN

153
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,140
WITH FBI AGENTS SEATED ACROSS

154
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:59,542
THE TABLE.

155
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,310
NEXT UP.

156
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,111
>> WHAT A JOKE.

157
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:02,479
I LIKE DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

158
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,713
I DON'T THINK SHE LEAKED

159
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:04,748
DR. FORD'S NAME TO THE MEDIA PUT

160
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:06,349
SOMEBODY AROUND HER MAY HAVE.

161
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,885
IF YOU SAW THIS MAN AS YELLING,

162
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:12,288
I SAW A MAN WHO WAS OFFENDED TO

163
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,690
HIS CORE, DEFENDED HIS GOOD

164
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,325
NAME, TOOK IT TO THE PEOPLE WHO

165
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,226
WERE TRYING TO DESTROY HIS

166
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,359
FAMILY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU

167
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:19,562
WERE IN THAT SITUATION?

168
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,531
SO THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW HIS

169
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,701
TEMPERAMENT IS IN QUESTION, YOU

170
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:25,935
ARE REWARDING THE WORST BEHAVIOR

171
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:29,105
I'VE SEEN IN 20 YEARS IF YOU BUY

172
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:29,539
THAT GARBAGE.

173
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,941
TO ANY REPUBLICAN, TEMPERAMENT

174
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:36,012
ACCORDING TO THIS -- DO NOT LET

175
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:37,681
THESE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY'VE

176
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:38,682
DONE TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND

177
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:39,783
REWARD THEM BY SAYING HE'S NO

178
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:43,286
LONGER FIT BECAUSE HE'S IN THE

179
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:44,521
WORLD'S WORST POSITION OF

180
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:45,722
DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST A

181
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:46,523
BUNCH OF GARBAGE FROM PEOPLE WHO

182
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:48,591
DON'T CARE ABOUT FAIRNESS.

183
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,160
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE

184
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:51,327
TRUTH.

185
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:52,562
IT'S BEEN ABOUT DELAYING THE

186
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:53,930
HEARING TO GET PAST THE MIDTERMS

187
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,099
TO FILL THE SEAT IN 2020.

188
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,103
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, LISTEN

189
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:00,704
