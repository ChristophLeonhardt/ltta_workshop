00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:00,900
Hello.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,390
This is Juan Antonio Bayona,
director of "Jurassic World:

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,320
Fallen Kingdom." You’re
watching a scene that takes

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,910
place halfway
through the story.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,810
We find our characters,
Claire and Owen, Chris Pratt

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,360
and Bryce Dallas
Howard, inside a boat —

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,540
a massive boat
full of dinosaurs.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,610
And they just survived
a big volcano eruption.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,040
And we still don’t know why
the dinosaurs are there, what

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,960
is the purpose with
them, and we still

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
don’t know where are we going.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,220
This scene came with
the idea that we

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,586
needed a thrilling moment
into this long section

14
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,210
of the movie that
felt a little static,

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,910
but we didn’t have
many elements.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,150
I came with this idea that
because the characters were

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,880
performing a surgery
on a velociraptor,

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,390
on Blue, later on, maybe
they will need some blood

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,160
to get a transfusion before
they perform the surgery.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,590
So I suggested to
Steven Spielberg

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,480
to get a moment of
comedy and tension,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,780
where the characters
are inside this truck

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,530
with a T. rex,
trying to get blood.

24
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,090
And he loved the idea.

25
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,700
[screams]

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,770
“Oh.

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,690
Ugh."

28
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,380
NARRATOR: It was a moment
very open to improvisation.

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,540
It felt very organic, so
I gave a lot of freedom

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,090
to the actors, and they
came with brilliant lines.

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,180
And of course, we had to
create this big animatronic.

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,090
And it was great
because the actors

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,750
were able to perform in
front of something real.

34
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,650
There was a lot of excitement
on set, and they used that.

35
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,980
There’s a combination
of animatronics with CGI

36
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,900
as the scene moves
forward in order

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,160
to be able to make the
dinosaur perform movement

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,810
that would have been
very complicated

39
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,440
with an animatronic.

40
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,500
Also, Chris came
with this idea

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,930
of finishing the scene
with Owen jumping

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,700
through the mouth
of the T. rex,

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,440
and I felt that
was very exciting.

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,670
It was a real stunt that he
performed no more than three

45
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,320
times because it felt
pretty dangerous,

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,360
and we wanted to
take care of him.

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,950
And we didn’t force
him to make it

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,600
more than three times.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,100
[panting]

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,550
“Did you see that?"

51
00:02:01,819 --> 00:00:00,000
" Uh huh!"
