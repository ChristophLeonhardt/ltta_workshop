the arrest of a notorious drug lord a decade ago in Afghanistan was heralded as a devastating blow to the Taliban but now Haji Juma Khan has walked free from an American prison caleb Maupin has been looking into the case here at this Correctional Facility in Manhattan you've got some very dangerous criminals you've got the Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin el chapo guzman furthermore you've got the terrorist suspected of driving his truck into pedestrians here in Manhattan back in 2017 but one rather famous inmate the Afghan drug lord Haji Juma Khan recently checked out and no one knows why Khan was first arrested back in 2001 as the USA began its operations in Afghanistan however he was almost immediately released and from there he went on to set up a criminal empire known as the Khan organization he was watched very closely by the US Drug Enforcement Agency the Khan organization arranged to sell Morphin base nope and derivative that can be processed into heroin in quantities as large as 40 tons enough to supply the entire United States heroin market for more than two years now it's also important to note that in Afghanistan he became friends with the DEA stop man in Kabul he described their friendship as crucial in getting information he was a major player in the global heroin trade and our aim was to cut off the supply of money from open kingpins like him to the Taliban and terrorists such as al-qaeda he was an unofficial spy in the end he gave us useful information that we passed on to the military at one point in 2006 the DEA chief in Kabul got so close to his drug lord buddy that he was worried he may have cancer he arranged a trip for him to the United States in order to get treatment one day I noticed that he had a growth on his chest I thought it might be cancerous as I had previously had a melanoma cut out and showed him my scars I offered him treatment in DC and we went although it was a false alarm I was helping a friend but also it was worth building trust the friendship soured in 2008 when he was lured to Indonesia arrested by Interpol and then extradited to New York City once he was locked up pending trial the DEA then publicly linked him to terrorists proceeds from Haji makan global drug trafficking organization funded the terrorist activities of the Taliban his arrest disrupts a significant line of credit to the Taliban that will shake the foundation of his drug Network that has moved massive quantities of heroin to worldwide drug markets ever since that time everything related to Khan's case has been completely sealed in 2010 the New York Times wrote about his long-standing friendship with both the DEA and the CIA prior to capture at the time neither agency would confirm or deny it unlike his lawyer several law enforcement agencies from the United States approaching people in Afghanistan included mr. Khan and requesting assistance and assigned standard payments made services requested from my client and others but now Khan is free no criminal charges no trial and no explanation why now at this point perhaps we can assume that the law enforcement agencies know what's best for the public and just don't feel a need to share it their secret collaboration with the worst of the underworld kept secret so you can sleep better at night Caleb Maupin RT New York
