when you look at history the first thing
that dictators do is shut down the press
and I'm not saying that that's that that
President Trump is trying to be a
dictator I'm just saying we need to
learn the lessons of history
let's trust each other let's return to
regular order
we've been spinning our wheels on too
many important issues because we keep
trying to find a way to win without help
from across the aisle
