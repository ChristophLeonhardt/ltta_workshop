we want you to be educated you can't just you know turn over the keys and say hey Mick my house pretty and you know all that you do all the work because basically then the contractor knows well this person doesn't know anything I'm gonna charge you more and you're gonna end up pulling money out of your pocket you don't need to so the big thing I would say is look at the fundamentals one of them is you always want to make sure that you're finding reliable contractors who are setting themselves up like a business and not somebody who's just changing their cellphone number every other week so look for professional affiliations like the Better Business Bureau or maybe they're part of a new home warranty program whatever it is make sure that they're set up like a proper business and looks look at past work that they've done as well there's no problem asking to see past projects if they're gonna be doing a big project for you why wouldn't you want to do that or ask for referrals from friends yet clients love to brag about the work that they've had done and they'll tell you all the good and all the bad the other thing to have everything in writing your quote should be in writing the actual contract should be in writing and it will lay out everything if there's some of the work that's not up to your standard it'll tell you in the contract what has to be done with that you can also go online and you can get sample contracts that you can use but just always make sure there's a contract in writing and make sure your contractor is licensed but remember just because they're licensed it doesn't mean they're any good that's why you have to check references the most important things to realize contractor intelligence is not too high so more grunting Ren oh good that's the best because like knows I'm not here no oh
