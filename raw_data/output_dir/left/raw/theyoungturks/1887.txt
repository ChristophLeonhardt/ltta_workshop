1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,050
>>A THREE YEAR OLD GIRL IN INDIANA
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HER PREGNANT

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,080
MOTHER AND A VEHICLE AS THEY
WERE WAITING FOR THEIR FATHER TO

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,809
RETURN FROM THRIFT STORE.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,360
THEY WERE IN A PARKING LOT NEAR
THE THRIFT STORE AND APPARENTLY

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,880
THE FATHER WAS THE ONE WHO LEFT
HIS GUN IN THE CENTER CONSOLE

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
OF THE CAR.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,650
AT THE TIME THERE WERE OTHER
CHILDREN IN THE CAR INCLUDING

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,480
THE ONE-YEAR-OLD BROTHER.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,140
LUCKILY THE MOTHER IS IN THE
HOSPITAL, HAS NOT PASSED AWAY

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,760
FROM THE WOUND AND IS
EXPECTED TO STABILIZE.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:44,300
THE FATHER HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR
LEAVING HIS GUN IN THE CAR.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,039
>>CHILD ENDANGERMENT.

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,809
HE DIDN'T PULL IT, OBVIOUSLY THE
THREE-YEAR-OLD DID.

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,090
IS ENDANGERING THE KIDS THAT
GOT HIM ARRESTED.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,240
A WITNESS SAID WHAT I SAW WAS A
LADY, SHE WAS ALMOST ABOUT TO

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
FALL.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,599
SHE WAS BLEEDING OUT WITH A
BUCKET OF BLOOD ON THE GROUND.

18
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:11,740
AND I JUST SAW TWO KIDS
STANDING THERE.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,810
THE THREE-YEAR-OLD WHO
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT THE MOM HAS

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,270
GOT TO BE HORRIFIED.

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,430
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HER MOM
SCREAMING AND DYING IN FRONT OF

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,659
HER SAID GOD SHE DIDN'T DIE.

23
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:31,580
AND EVERY GUN OWNER SAYS I AM
RESPONSIBLE, I WOULD NEVER DO

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
THAT.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:40,310
AND DAY AFTER DAY, PEOPLE DO IT.

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:51,590
NO 
THREE-YEAR-OLD ACCIDENTALLY

27
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,310
HIDES A GIANT ROPE OR DRIVES A

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,450
TRUCK OR DOES A MASS STABBING.

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,509
PULLING A TRIGGER SUPER EASY.

30
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,669
THE WHOLE POINT OF GUNS IS
TO KILL THINGS.

31
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:06,520
>> THIS IS JUST A HORRIFIC STORY
THROUGH AND THROUGH THE WAY IT

32
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
UNFOLDED.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,669
THE THING THE GUY YELLED
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE

34
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,470
WITNESSES WHEN THIS MAN LEFT HIS
GUN COMES OUT AFTER HEARING IT

35
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:20,040
GO OFF SAYS Ã± THE BOYFRIEND WENT
OUTSIDE BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD HIM

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
THERE WAS A GIRL BLEEDING.

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
AND HE COMES OUT YELLING DID YOU
KILL YOURSELF, DID YOU KILL

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
YOURSELF?

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,630
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT A FAMILY WITH A SEVERE

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,180
AMOUNT OF WEIRD ISSUES NOT MADE
BETTER BY HAVING A GUN IN THE

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,180
CONSOLE.

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,220
>>I FEEL AS THOUGH IF I WAS
LIVING IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE ONE

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,280
OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT GIVE
OFF A VIBE THAT THEY ARE

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,970
CONSIDERING SUICIDE, MAYBE I
WOULDN'T HAVE A GUN IN THAT

45
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,970
HOUSE.

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,420
OR MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE A GUN
IN THE CAR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,330
TO KIDS.

48
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,780
I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL YOU
SAID THAT THE WHY WOULD YOU

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,400
THINK YOUR WIFE WOULD KILL
HERSELF?

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,000
>> THE GUN, YOU THINK IT'S
GOING TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,830
WITH KIDS IN THE HOUSE, THE
CHANCE OF YOU ARE ONE OF THE

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,670
KIDS KILLING THEMSELVES
ACCIDENTALLY IS SO MUCH HIGHER

53
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,370
THAN SOME INTRUDER BREAKING INTO
YOUR HOUSE AND YOU HEROICALLY

54
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,470
PULLING UP THE GUN IN THE NICK
OF TIME AND SHOOTING THE GUN

55
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,130
FOR HE GETS YOU GUYS.

56
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,630
THAT ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS.

57
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,540
ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

58
00:03:32,540 --> 00:04:13,800
OVER 500 PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR
JUST FROM ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S 
THE GUNS.
