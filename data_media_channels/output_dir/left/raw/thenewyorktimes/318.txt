00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:11,810
“Chloe Kim is, in my opinion,
the best women’s halfpipe rider

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,510
alive right now.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,640
I think she’s the
most promising talent

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,150
we’ve seen in the halfpipe, 
regardless of her age,

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,800
in the last 15 years.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,990
She’s the real deal.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,400
Like, 100 percent.”

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,820
“No one really rides the same.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,470
It’s always different,
and it's always changing.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,090
That’s what makes
snowboarding so interesting.”

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,870
“You look at her and you’re
like, oh, she’s just cruising.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,510
The next thing you know, 
she’s 10 feet out over

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,510
the lip of the halfpipe.

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,110
She’s had a tremendous amount
of success at a very young age.

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,560
In that regard, she’s pretty
similar to Shaun White.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,510
In another regard, she’s very
similar to one Kelly Clark.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,779
They’re both groundbreaking,
dominating snowboarders.”

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,420
“Chloe is one of the
only pipe riders

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,970
I’ve ever seen that
can blend technicality

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,180
and amplitude equally.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,580
So she’s got amazing style.

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,830
She chooses to do 
really technical tricks,

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,620
which the judges tend to like.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,730
She’s just an
evolution of how far

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,620
pipe riding has come since
snowboarding first started.”

29
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,470
“I remember seeing it and
kind of being in shock.

30
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,590
Like, that’s wild that
she just took it there,

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,820
kind of out of nowhere.

32
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,440
It is almost like
leapfrogging two full levels

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,855
and just setting the bar
at such a high standard.”

[music]

35
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,430
“It’s a very committed
thing to do,

36
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,710
and it requires a lot of
courage and a lot of guts.”

37
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,150
“It’s a spectacle.

38
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,501
I mean, it’s a fantastic
athletic achievement.”

39
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,180
“We learned how to
snowboard together.

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,280
We both had no idea
what we were doing.”

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,540
“At the time, I see the film
for the women snowboarding.

42
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,970
Normally they
mostly spin one way.

43
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,760
She has to spin four ways.

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,895
It’s just common sense.”

45
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:54,220
“That was enormous.

46
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,600
And a cab three. Chloe Kim— ”

48
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,070
“Chloe was too young to
go to the last Olympics.

49
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,290
But if she were
eligible, I think

50
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,540
she might have 
won the gold medal.”

51
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
“I always compete with myself.

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,220
Like, O.K., how can I do
better than my last run?

53
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,280
Or how can I do better
than I did in training?

54
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,130
It’s just always
trying to improve.

55
00:04:27,130 --> 00:00:00,000
Focus on yourself and
do the best you can.”
