00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:39,454
REMIND OUR AUDIENCE WHAT IS

00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:41,123

26
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:41,990
THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

27
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,460
>> I WAS WALKING PAST THE

28
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,396
SCHOOL WHERE MY SON WOULD GO

29
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:48,430

00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:53,101
ANTI-NRA AND G.O.P.

32
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,468
MESSAGES.

33
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:54,369
THIS IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL.

34
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,071
CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 5.

35
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,339
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NRA AND

36
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:58,807

37
00:00:58,807 --> 00:00:59,808
ABBY: WHO IS PUTTING UP SOME

38
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:00,342
OF THE SIGNS.

39
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,510
>> ALLEGEDLY STUDENTS.

40
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,744
I THINK THEY WERE FORCED TO

41
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:03,979
DO SO.

42
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,614
AND, NO MATTER HOW YOU COME

43
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:06,882
OUT ON THIS POLITICALLY,

44
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,016
PHILADELPHIA HAS SOMETHING

45
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,551
LIKE A 70% HIGH SCHOOL

46
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:10,585
GRADUATION RATE.

47
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:11,686
THAT'S 10% BELOW THE

48
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,488
NATIONAL AVERAGE.

49
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:14,589
THESE KIDS NEED TO LEARN HOW

50
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:15,857
TO READ AND MATH AND

51
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:16,224
SCIENCE.

52
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,026
ALSO, WHY ARE WE

53
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:18,760
INDOCTRINATING OUR CHILDREN?

54
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,895
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE HATRED

55
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:20,629
IN THEIR HEARTS.

56
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:21,797
THEY SHOULD HAVE LOVE FOR

57
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:22,697
EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT

58
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,332
POLITICAL PARTY YOU BELONG

59
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:24,666
TO.

60
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,901
ABBY: NOW THE G.O.P., THE

61
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:26,435
REPUBLICAN PARTY OF

62
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:27,202
PENNSYLVANIA ARE GETTING

63
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:27,569
INVOLVED.

64
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:28,837
HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY IS

65
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:29,671
GOING ON AT THE SCHOOL.

66
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,173
THEY SAY YOUR HANDBOOK

67
00:01:31,173 --> 00:01:31,873
SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT

68
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:32,674
SCHOOL PROPERTY AND

69
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:33,742
SCHOOLTIME MAY NOT BE USED

70
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:34,876
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES.

71
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,478
WE REQUEST THE SCHOOL

72
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:37,946
DISTRICT IMMEDIATELY REMOVE

73
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,181
THOSE SIGNS SO THAT'S SORT

74
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,949
OF THE LATEST UPDATE IN WHAT

75
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:41,683
IS GOING ON.

76
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:43,051
HOW IS THE SCHOOL, DO YOU

77
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,685
THINK, GOING TO RESPOND?

78
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,687
>> HOPEFULLY THEY WILL

79
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:47,089
FOLLOW THAT EDICT AND TAKE

80
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,190
THE SIGNS DOWN.

81
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,791
I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO

82
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,892
SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL

83
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:51,193
HERE.

84
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:52,294
THEY ARE SAYING THINGS TO ME

85
00:01:52,294 --> 00:01:53,695
NOW MY CHILDREN ARE UNSAFE

86
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,097
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS

87
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,264
GETTING DEATH THREATS AND

88
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:57,732
YOU ARE BRINGING THIS TO THE

89
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:58,100
FOREFRONT.

90
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,935
OF COURSE I'M SORRY I WANT

91
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,903
SAFE I LOVE MY FRIENDS AND

92
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:02,270
CHILDREN.

93
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,638
THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE

94
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:05,474
TEACHERS, 5, 6, 7,

95
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:07,242
8-YEAR-OLDS SHOULDN'T BE

96
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:08,743
ADDRESSING ADULT ISSUES LIKE

97
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:09,610
POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE

98
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:09,877
NRA.

99
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,746
THESE ARE ADULT ISSUES.

100
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:12,581
AND YOU HAVE TO REALIZE IF

101
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,782
YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE ON

102
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:14,950
ADULT ISSUES, YOU ARE GOING

103
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,551
TO HAVE ADULT CONSEQUENCES.

104
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,987
THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.

105
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,822
ABBY: WHAT IF THE SIGNS WERE

106
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:21,289
SWITCHED.

107
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,724
PRO-NRA AND PRO-SECOND

108
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:23,091
AMENDMENT?

109
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:23,859
WOULD YOU BE OKAY.

110
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:26,328
>> I WOULD STILL BE PRETTYIA

111
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:26,628
LARMD.

112
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:27,596
I DON'T THINK KIDS OF ANY

113
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:28,530
AGE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

114
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,264
THE ISSUES.

115
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:30,198
IF THEY ARE THEY SHOULD BE

116
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:31,733
TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE HOME

117
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,335
NOT A PUBLIC SCHOOL.

118
00:02:33,335 --> 00:00:00,000
ABBY: WE WILL SEE HOW THIS
