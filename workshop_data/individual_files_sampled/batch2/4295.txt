I want to play for our audience Rudy Guiliani from tonight on Fox News talking about why the president really fired James Comey and that'll be followed by what the president told Lester Holt about why he fired James Comey he fired call me because Comey would not among other things say that he wasn't they targeted the investigation he's entitled to that Hillary Clinton got that and she he couldn't get that so he fired him then he said I'm free of this guy and he went on Lester Holt Lester Holt interview was as good as anybody could do better than I think any of the people around Mulla could have done and Lester Holt asked him why did you do it he said I did it because I felt that I had to explain to the American people their president was not the target of the investigation regardless of recommendation I was going to fire call me knowing there was no good time to do it and in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said you know this rushar thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story so maybe there you have it the Giuliani argument was interesting we were unable to look up and see when Hillary Clinton had been president but our researchers are still working on that what do you what do you make of that well again I mean it's first of all everyone here loses credibility both Trump and Giuliani because they can't even keep their their story internally consistent and you know we've said this before about Trump he can't keep his story straight it's hard to keep your story straight when you're not telling the truth so that's one problem their stories now are inherently contradictory doesn't doesn't look very credible but second you know what Giuliani said is essentially some of the evidence that Muller would be looking for which is he that that that Trump fired Co me because Comey wouldn't clear his name that goes right to that question of intent with respect to obstruction so you know I think Trump's own statement to Lester Holt also was damaging because he said you know because of that Russia thing it showed it was on his mind but Giuliani's was even more focused than that it's because he wouldn't clear me that that to me rings even more of obstruction hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
