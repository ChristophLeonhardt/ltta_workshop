Rachel Notley is flipping and flopping now she does want to limit supply of oil to BC to fight their pipeline blockade I wonder what UCP policy she'll adopt next and then claim it as her own brilliant idea this week was the Alberta government's speech from the throne now this is an opportunity for the sitting government to lay out what they're going to do and do to us in the next legislative session and this throne speech saw premier Notley talking tough through the lieutenant governor about British Columbia's blockade of the trans mountain pipeline from Edmonton to the BC coast just watch some people have asked how far we are willing to go today we reaffirm we will do whatever it takes in the past when workers in our energy industry were attacked and when the resources we owned were threatened premier Peter Lougheed took bold action your government has been clear every option is on the table we will not hesitate to invoke similar legislation if it becomes necessary owing to extreme and the legal actions on the part of the BC government to stop the pipeline for a little bit of context for the younger folks Progressive Conservative Premier Peter Lougheed cut oil production in 1980 down to 85 percent of capacity to fight back against Pierre Elliot Trudeau 's national energy program and the export tax he slapped on Alberta oil and gas when asked about what those bold throne speech threats really meant in a press conference held after the speech from the throne this is whatnot we had to say here so what we are looking at doing right now is simply ensuring that as part of a long list of tools that we have many of which we haven't really talked about yet but between the wine ban and you're talking about what we're making sure is that we have the ability to engage all those tools strategically so one thing might ultimately turn into the restriction of supply down the road well I guess not least poorly conceived BC wine ban wasn't as effective as she told us all it would be so it's time to play hardball it's good to see Notley being bold and boy those threats to let our Western neighbors freeze in the dark sound pretty darn familiar they sound a lot like something United conservative party leader Jason Kenney has been saying for at least the better part of a year now just watch if the BC government through dilatory measures stands in the way of the construction of the approved expansion of Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain that there will be consequences maybe of Vancouver rates woke up one morning and found that their gas prices have doubled or tripled and wonder what's going on and maybe they would see but they actually do need Alberta and Canadian energy to fuel their own prosperity mayor of Vancouver says he wants a carbon-free Vancouver by 2040 I'm prepared to give him a carbon-free Vancouver by 2020 if they stopped that pipeline 1982 Peter Lougheed stop permitting the shipment of gas to two Sarnia to bring the federal government to the table on the national energy program we might have to consider a similar approach there are a lot of points of economic leverage that Alberta has if beads if BC decides to violate the rule of law by blocking the construction of that safe and approved by plane yeah that's right United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney has been talking about leveraging our oil supply in the standoff against BC over the trans mountain pipeline long before he was ever even leader of his own party and not Lee on the other hand she didn't think it was such a great idea back when Jason Kenney was the one pushing it don't believe me just hear it from Rachel Notley herself listen you know the Conservatives couldn't get a pipeline built for 20 years and now they want to act like tough guys threatening trade more with BC Conservative government BC conservative government in Ottawa Conservative government now Berta and still still they couldn't get a pipeline built those failures we're gonna get this pipeline built you know he's just not going to build a pipeline by crossing his arms sticking out his lower lip pouting and then somehow suggesting that the answer to it is to ask Kinder Morgan to actually stop shipping what they're already shipping in order to get this done I mean none of this makes sense look I'm all for cutting BC off of Alberta oil until they figure out just how important Alberta oil really is to them BC already sees some of the highest gas prices on the entire continent let's see how high those gas prices can go when they don't have Alberta supply to meet their oil and gas needs the green folks in BC will figure out pretty darn fast they're just as addicted to oil and gas as the rest of us those opposed to the trans mountain pipeline will get mugged by reality the exact same way Rachel Notley is today but let's not pretend for a minute that this plan to limit oil supply to BC is not Lee's brainchild or something she didn't take to the national media to openly mock as isolationist trumpian and adversarial I'm glad Rachel Notley has come around to my way of thinking but I'm not about to let her off the hook for what she said in the past about the proponents of limiting oil supply to our political enemies on the bright side though if not Lee keeps up this trend of poaching United conservative party ideas to save face she just might be willing to scrap her own carbon tax before 2019 for the rebel dot media I'm Shiela gunnery please make a donation to cover the cost of the billboard truck did I want to have drive around Calgary to expose King for his sexual misdeeds that's fire Kang calm
