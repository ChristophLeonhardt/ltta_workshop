kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like an infinite circle but</font>

102
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,480
anyway we I forgot about columbus day at

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,220
but Yom Kippur is here I have to mention

104
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,310
since it is Yom Kippur on ricochet this

105
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,049
Orthodox Jewish writer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gil Reich</font>

106
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">worthley nicest piece about my book the</font>

107
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,630
great good thing a secular Jew comes to

108
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,890
faith in Christ and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always</font>

109
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult for Jews to read these books</font>

110
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,820
but I've noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the more orthodox</font>

111
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,500
they are the more religious they are the

112
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,120
more understanding and sympathetic to

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
the book they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and he points out he</font>

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,630
just has a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nice things about it</font>

115
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,970
you can go and see it on ricochet it's

116
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,279
very very touching<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece I thought and I</font>

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,529
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was moved by all right so the GOP</font>

118
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,289
is falling apart basically Trump's poll

119
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,419
numbers are tanking that little tough to

120
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,750
tell at the moment

121
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,490
because he did seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have won</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

122
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,160
debate and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sex tape thing</font>

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,630
is everybody's going crazy over the sex

124
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,490
tape thing and I'm truth there more to

125
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,010
come the<font color="#E5E5E5"> The Wall Street Journal had a</font>

126
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,680
poll that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had him eleven percent 11</font>

127
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,420
points behind Hillary Clinton that pole

128
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,670
was a very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample taken at a very</font>

129
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,590
weird time it was almost like a pole in

130
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the making but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the RCP the Real Clear</font>

131
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,830
Politics average has her up between five

132
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,440
and six percent which I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably is</font>

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,760
pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and that's that's</font>

134
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,770
huge in October so it is it'll things

135
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,480
look better things look bad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

136

142
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,930
the hero would get in trouble and then

143
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,340
the guy would get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble and so</font>

144
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,450
he had this thing where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy was in a</font>

145
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,480
pit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's surrounded by snakes and</font>

searching for him all over town finally

153
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,030
found them pumped him full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee you</font>

to vote it's great i mean is and of

246
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:52,990
course what's the thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

247
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,730
dramatic at this point is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil war</font>

248
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,200
that's opening up in the Republican

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,380
Party<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul Ryan came out and what he</font>

250
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,360
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> was what he said was basically i'm</font>

251
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,950
not going to campaign with this guy

252
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,420
anymore but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't withdraw my</font>

253
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,070
endorsement so he's walking this fine

254
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,740
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to remember look there's</font>

255
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,170
now a real possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real</font>

256
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,870
possibility that the GOP could lose

257
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,150
either either the house or the senator

258
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,430
both which would be pretty disastrous if

259
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,490
these guys these down ticket guys you

260
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,520
know congressmen senators come out and

261
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,060
they say well we hate Trump now then the

262
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,680
Trump voters<font color="#CCCCCC"> turnout and remember</font>

263
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,700
there's forty five percent of the

264
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,680
electorate the Trump voters turn up or

265
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,840
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is now 38 the Trump voters</font>

266
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,250
turn up and they'll vote for Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

267
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,900
they won't vote for the down ticket guys

268
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,570
meanwhile if you say no we still support

269
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,340
from then the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who just find Trump</font>

270
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,290
appalling show up and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't</font>

271
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,300
show up they won't vote for you or or

272
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,120
Trump and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> senator is gone and that's</font>

273
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,760
really really a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know</font>

274
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,580
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way Trump of course with his</font>

275
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,160
usual restraint in class and sense of

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,980
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jawad avi is tweeting all these</font>

277
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,630

Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,640
would be only too happy to rubber-stamp

298
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,710
see this is the thing about the way the

299
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,850
press covers elections is it's all you
