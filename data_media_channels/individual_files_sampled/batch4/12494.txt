with Tom Arnold and well if you missed it you should go back and listen because it actually showed a lot of the differences between the left and the right but if you just want a quick summary here is a quick recap of my interview with Tom Arnold yesterday Freddie the Kosmos for situational tells you what I wrote the participative new committee like I said my friend right here tonight over at University where my friend place and I'm from too many parts samos Monday to the Arizona groom and another person said cool and keen I do but is mine gonna tell you right you show you show you face in

and the whole world does the answer just right just tell just tell you once again who's bad that no that clip was a little bit slower than the way that Tom and I were talking yesterday but if you missed it you know I got a lot of mailbag questions about this I got a lot of tweets and everything about what the interview was like with Tom it was pretty wild or moving pretty fast I'll I'll give my thoughts on that in the mailbag because I reacted to it actually differently than I think a lot of people think so we'll get to that later first as president Trump's birthday to sell right we are we're so lucky on this show we get the best guests folks we are gonna bring on Marilyn Monroe to sing Donald Trump a happy birthday before an audience of Hillary Clinton supporters Marilyn take it away that's incredible footage really well done beautiful Marilyn and happy birthday mr. president it's Donald Trump's birthday but we're getting all of the presents aren't we here's a quick rundown before we bring on the god-king to explain to pour a little cold water on all of our happiness and KO FFA and explain why soccer is a threat to Western civilization to begin on the economy new jobless claims fell again last week meaning that the number of Americans on the jobless rolls fell to a forty four and a half year low could you just imagine this so the labor market right now is at or close to full employment unemployment right now is is under 4% slike 3.8 percent the Fed is predicting it'll drop further by the end of the year that's why the Fed is finally raising interest rates for a second time this year after not being able to do that because of Barack Obama's stagnant economy they're saying the labor market is continuing to strengthen that job gains are strong the Fed says that economic activity is rising at a solid rate layoffs right now are very low there there are signs of workers shortages across all sectors of the economy 6.7 million job openings in April people are receiving unemployment insurance at the lowest level since 1973 there are more job openings in the United States than unemployed workers to fill them imagine this in October 2016 if somebody told you they said hey these what do you think the headlines are going to be under a Donald Trump presidency say I don't know the Western Hemisphere exploding and the eastern hemisphere exploding I don't know the core of the earth exploding right that is what you would predict and you get these absurdly good economic data points on foreign affairs the historic Kim jong-un summit is a big win for the United States a Michael Goodwin points this out in the New York Post today there there are plenty of good reasons to be cynical about the Iran deal plenty of good reasons the Kim's are murderous and deceptive there's no reason to believe that this Kim is any better than his father any less treacherous the Kim's have backed out of plenty of deals that they said they were gonna do before and they you know they've run right out before the ink is dry also China might not let North Korea denuclearize fine yep I get it there are a lot of reasons to be cynical Goodwin makes this great point in the post he writes quote today should be declared a holiday from nitpicking a time to celebrate what has been accomplished instead of fixating on the possible pitfalls it's an occasion to look forward with hope instead of backward with suspicion and this is such an important point conservatives sometimes forget this because we want to like frown all the time cynicism is very stupid it's very stupid that you know Norm Macdonald one of my favorite voices in the world the great voice of our age yesterday he referred to something called the profanity of cynicism in a tweet and he's so right this is such an astute observation cynicism is profane if the cynicism is the the crutch of anxious people who can't tolerate uncertainty and they're terrified that they're gonna look foolish if they end up being wrong and so they don't want to have any hope or smiling to begin with they just want a frown and say everything's gonna be terrible but the world is a hopeful place there's nothing virtuous about cynicism you know you should be courageous you should be a prudent certainly you shouldn't be reckless or stupid but you should be courageous you should be prudent you should be manly not cynical that's what the word courage comes from courage comes from core from from heart right and cynicism is discouraging takes the heart out of everything you should take heart could it go wrong of course are we in the early stages of whatever kind of nuclear deal we're trying to work out yes what are the odds that it works out who knows there's a good first step take heart on Foreign Affairs also and this is right before we'll bring in the god-king to pour cold water on everything we're getting the World Cup in North America it's gonna be this nice alliance between Canada the United States Mexico a Donald Trump by the way has been lobbying since March to bring the World Cup to North America meanwhile Los Angeles is getting the 2028 Summer Olympics as well so we've got two major international sporting events that are coming to the United States because of Donald Trump everybody predicted that Trump would hurt these bids because the whole world hates him right he's you know he's humiliating on the or allies hate us and instead he actually helped now look I do not care very much for the Olympics I don't watch the Olympics other than curling curling is one of my favorite sports in the world but other than curling I don't like it I also think that soccer basically should be outlawed in the United States but it is a very good sign nonetheless of this global leadership the United States has global leadership president Trump has picked up two major international sporting events that's a good thing so say I now I think the god-king the the founder of my feasts and the man who signs my checks disagrees with me on this can we bring on the god-king hey look it's Donald Trump's birthday it's Flag Day I'm feeling so good tell me bring me down what's interesting to me is how everyone who supports the president uh-huh carries water for the president you can't just be a general fan of the guy you have to be basically an evangelist you're Donald proselytizing ff' and so when he says for example he calls Kim Jong than Rocket Man never offers things like yes we have always wanted war on the Korean Peninsula and when he says things like I really trust in there it's like yes we have always wanted peace on the Korean Peninsula and no one ever knows where they stand with you people and this is the greatest example this is a microcosm yeah of all things Trump that one of the great arguments on behalf of Donald Trump is he's going to be a global leader he's going to rebuild America's supremacy he's going to salvage Western civilization America great and make America great again he's gonna salvage Western civilization and now you're that he is bringing this bastard sport of soccer to the United States this is Obama level leading from behind you call that global leadership global leadership is called baseball yes that's baseball maybe four but global leading from behind yeah it's called soccer I have to say when I was reading all the good news today well we'll get to the we'll get to the great explanation because I have to say this is the best never Trump argument that really sort of compels me before we get to this we got to make a little money honey we got to keep the lights on in here keep me employed by this guy we got to talk about Boleyn branch sheets and I love Boleyn branch sheets you need to go out there and buy Bolin brand sheets not only cuz they're so so good but because when enough of you buy Bolin brand sheets they'll like me more and send me more Bolin brand sheets and they're the best thing that I've ever slept on there your job literally depends on how well okay you can sell these volyn branchy might not only my job but also my private life is your confidence in the Bolin branch sheets such that you would bet your job on it I uh I would absolutely bet my job on it because I'll tell you something there's not a lot that we can all agree on you know for instance we were talking in the Father's Day episode when it comes to sleeping sweet little ELISA mrs. Knowles and I we prefer different things for instance I enjoy sleeping on like a firmer mattress she prefers sleeping on a mattress that I'm not on but we both love Boleyn branch sheets they are the they're the best sheets I've ever slept on they're made from 100% pure organic cotton they start out very soft they get softer as it goes on I didn't know this in my bachelor days you probably know this you go out you buy the cheapest sheets they're made of sandpaper and they're well for people who don't live in LA you may not know that we actually buy our sheets in LA at gas stations we do history people set up tables out in front of gas stations and they sell sheets and the thread count is always measured in single digits yes it is I love a nice solid eight eight thread count is really strong and firm so I tried these nice sheets nice sheets cost like $1,000 unless you go direct a Boleyn branch they cut out the middleman they cost just a couple hundred bucks thousands of five-star reviews Forbes Wall Street Journal Fast Company all talking about them three u.s. presidents leap on bull and branch sheets three u.s. presidents one blank book author into God king sleep on Boleyn branch sheets shipping you can try them for 30 nights if you don't love them send it back for a refund you're not gonna send them back you're not going back to that gas station don't do it baby get started right now you and my listeners get $50 off your first set of sheets at Bowen branch com promo code Michael mi CH AE L that's a birthday present for the president's birthday Boland branch comm $50 upper set of sheets bol L and branch comm promo code Michael what's so bad about soccer what's so bad about soccer it's like saying Jeremy yeah everything's going really well I noticed in in a world history until like the late 1930s what went wrong soccer is listen I actually don't hate soccer you know I I think that soccer is a perfectly good sport for the third world and that's what it is it's the sport of the third world because all you need is something roughly the size of a ball doesn't have to be able doesn't human head would work and I think that's probably how it all started and you need a patch of relatively flat earth and then you need a bunch of people to chase after the rolling object and occasionally fall down as though they had been hit yeah pretend it hurts pretend it hurts that is soccer and that's fine because everyone needs sports yes sports teach children about competition they teach children about work ethic they teach children a set of rules and how to succeed within those rules and sports help adults too because they give us an opportunity to play out a competitive aggression in a controlled way that doesn't result in violence although sometimes at soccer games the fans actually participate in the greater contact sport than the players through those hooligans hooligans yeah but you know they bring us together they give us a sense of of pride it's a nice distraction from the hardship of life everyone needs that yeah and so I'm I am glad that Ghana has a soccer team it's good yeah I'm glad that the Ivory Coast has a soccer team I am offended however that Great Britain also participates in this I'm and I am mortally offended that the United States would condescend to have a soccer team I tend to agree - except for six-year-old children and it's it's good yeah well it's really good I wonder at the World Cup now is because it's gonna be a host by Canada the United States and Mexico who is gonna provide the minivans to pick up the players afterward and give them juice boxes and cracker snacks exactly tell him tell him good boy it listen it matters when Great Britain was in her ascendancy the height of the British Empire she had the most complex sport in the world cricket cricket whatwhat did days - bleh sorry no one understands that the smartest guy on the block doesn't understand it that is the sport of an ascendant power America in her ascendancy had baseball a complex sport the offense the defense has possession of the ball fly rule infield fly rule yeah those are the sports of an ascendant nation they're complicated they're intelligent more importantly they're expensive because our sports reflect something about us you can't play baseball with just a ball and a piece of flat earth right right bait the recent little children play soccer is because it's the simplest sport you basically chase the moving ball that's all that's require a ton of training and specialized this and that's right and doesn't require money now America is a superpower our sport really we don't have to like it but the truth is its football right that is the national pastime that is the national pastime of our generation it is the most complex and expensive sport ever conceived the pads alone would break the GDP of many nations that have perfectly serviceable soccer team that's true and that's not bad again I'm not against third world nations having soccer I am against us saying that that's as good as baseball or football and I'm against the idea that we need to reach down and play the sport of the world instead of showing actual global leadership and saying no the entire world needs to be rich enough and powerful enough to play sports that require you not only to chase something but to spend thousands upon thousands of dollars preventing brain damage that's true and you know it's maybe we need like a new Marshall Plan I would be perfectly willing I'm a fiscal conservative so are you if we could invest in the infrastructure required to create booming economies such that these third-world countries can buy very expensive and elaborate equipment to play real sports that are civilized absolutely I would do it in a second I think that absolutely I agree if Trump were to scratch his infrastructure plan and instead you know support the world becoming baseball and football players yeah I'd vote for him for sure for re-election what I don't like though is this game of equality being a sort of the Thatcher view of equality that you know the left you can be here and poor people can be here in the less thinks it's bet the world is a better place if everyone's down here that's right That's not me I think that we should set an example in the world and give some give people something to rise up to and that thing is not chasing a rolling human head across a flat patch that is exactly right and it's so it is this degrading going back and it's bad for us that we yeah it's a and it's not as violent you know there's that there's that other aspect if you're a rich powerful ascendant company you can take some hits you can weather some you know you can pay for expensive hospitals that's right they used to flood the Coliseum and play out in naval battles from antiquity at the height of the decadence of Rome I feel like we can do much the same that's right and we should mm-hm not only that but I think that part of the problem with the rise of soccer in America is that you can trace it one to one to the decline of our culture mmm right when America was putting a man on the moon were grown adults in the freest country on Earth playing soccer Michael no they were not they were not because all that scrap metal was going to the Space Shuttle and not to make more minivans to keep Pikul of people of the field that's that's exactly right and by the way ever since women started to enter the workforce right that's right more women in the workforce yeah more soccer fields in the United States of America look at that's just science that's a correlation how do you even do you even study science you even study correlates with divorce rates it yeah I'm sure it does someone do the math you know you've made a really compelling argument it is the first anti-trump argument that has really started to convince listen I'm not anti Trump I'm a Trump skeptic Trump has done a lot of things that make me very very happy mm-hm this is not one of them I feel like if if previous Jeremy that's Jeremy from 2016 yeah who was busy expressing off his concerns about the worst case what will happen if Donald Trump becomes president you know I was worried the Republican Party would fracture I was worried we would lose credibility with Millennials who are becoming the largest voting bloc I was worried that we would lose our principles in service only of our of our victories yeah I never thought that I would see the President of the United States cheering the ascendancy of soccer yeah I'm sorry you make a great point I'm mr. president I hope you're watching it's been such a good you know it's been such a good year and a half but please you've got to rethink this you've got to rethink what you're doing mr. god-king thank you for being here thank you gotta get Tommy the chief executive dog was here I don't know CED is there any way to lift him up get on stuck because this is my real boss right here this would be the chief yeah he also sleeps on Boland branch that's because we're very wealthy decadent country thank you sir always good to see the god-king all right do we have time to we got a little bit of time to wrap up on the FBI before we have to get to the mailbag okay the investigator a general and Michael Horowitz who's the FBI watchdog he is concluded that a James Comey has deviated from a bureau and Justice Department procedures in handling the Clinton probe which damaged the agency's image I know you're shocked aren't you sure we didn't think we thought they did everything just right we thought James Comey totally aboveboard not political at all turns out that was all why they wrote quote this is from the IG report by departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and department norms the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice now they say that there's no evidence this was politically motivated what does that mean what we know is the James Comey treated Hillary Clinton differently than he would have treated other people and we know that they were trying to this was during a presidential election they were what is not political about that anything involving Hillary Clinton is political that's it that's absolutely absurd the report also by the way uncovered previously hidden text messages that the FBI was just not release it was just totally covering up between disgraced FBI agents and saucy lovers Peter struck and Lisa Paige Paige writes quote Trump's not ever going to become president right right - which struck responds no no he won't we'll stop it it's like the worst saddest soy boy flirting I've ever heard also also probably criminal and anti-american and anti-constitutional he said Peter struck of the FBI key investigators saying we will stop Donald Trump from becoming president what more evidence do you need what more evidence do you people need now right now at this moment the left and the anti-trump right are trying to lionize the FBI and demonize the president there are all of these distractions right there you're looking at this you're seeing a text from Peter struck and a key investigator at the FBI that says we're gonna stop Trump from being president they say look at stormy Daniels so what what do I care about some porn store they said look he said naughty words on a video tapes the FBI is saying he's gonna stop a interfere in a presidential election beyond the smoke and mirrors who has the better track record here who looks better who looks good who looks dirty between Donald Trump and the FBI it's no question it's no question and so it's a happy birthday eat soccer notwithstanding I guess it's good we nabbed these international sporting events and I use sporting loosely but you know we got to be careful here folks we can't let our exuberance get away with us and do things like like try to elevate soccer as a sport oK we've got a lot of mailbag to get to then i want to talk about my favorite flags for Flag Day you got them on my desk right here so by now this isn't this is a new announcement you have surely heard that the Michael Knowles show is available on Amazon Alexa and the Google home so I don't want you to be confused there was a video going around YouTube that was just an Alexa commercial but somebody replaced the all the sound with clips from my show so it's just me Alexa answering as me like I'd become Alexa this is this is sort of like that I am now on Alexa as well if you use one of these virtual assistants you can get my podcast with a simple voice command you just have to enable the skill on Alexa or ask Google to talk to the show for more information check out our pinned tweets daily wires pin tweets on Facebook and Twitter just starts screaming incoherently think that's what that's what starts to put my show on on the Alexa app you got to go over right now I gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but I'm still saying hello to Alexa I guess I guess we're still in there go to daily wire.com subscribe you get me you got the Andrew Klavan sure you get the Ben Shapiro sure you get to ask questions I'm the mailbag in the next one is the big boss himself you get to do all of that for ten bucks a month or $100 for an annual membership it is so simple man go over there right now we're going to get to the mailbag right away we'll be right back mmm oh that's did I forget to mention something did I forget to mention what you get when you subscribe ooh you know what that tastes like today it's got this distinct flavor of 3.8% unemployment it's got this distinct flavor of 44 and a half year low in jobless claims it's just mmm it's really good haven't tasted in a long long time very delicious though let's get to the mailbag before we have to go from Tyler dear Knowles the smoking jacket in combination with the bow tie was truly a sight to see my question is how do you explain the irony of the all-powerful argument in relation to God for example can God create an object too heavy for him to lift or can he lift anything meaning he's not powerful enough to create that object from Tyler yeah this this stupid question I'm sorry I don't mean to insult you Tyler this question is so stupid so the question is can God create an object so heavy that he can't lift it this was asked in the Father's Day video the god-king said Jeremy boring lower case G lower case k said that yes God can create an object so big that he can't lift it and then he would create a mechanism to lift it that's a that's a interesting explanation of Christianity I would put it differently though basically the same point and this is a big difference between Christianity and Islam in the Christian religion and the Christian God submits himself to logic he is not a god of infinite pure irrational wrath he's a God of logic in the beginning was the word the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God the logos being the divine logic of the universe it is a perfectly logical God a God who submits himself to the own logic that he creates and so the question can God create a rock so heavy that he can't lift it is basically akin to saying god bla bla bla bla bla bla right it's like saying parrot yellow elephant banana four times green it is words like there are words together but it doesn't have any meaning it doesn't have any any internal logic so in short answer to your to your question this God is a God of logic that's not true of other religions the God of Islam is not a God that is bound by logic it is a god that can do what it can act very capriciously and do whatever he likes that's a that's a different God it's a different object of worship and it's a different culture that comes out of those things but ours is a god of logic and there is a mechanism by which God lifts that that rock that seems so heavy that he can't lift it and it's and it's God giving His only begotten Son to be incarnate to die for the sins of man that's a that's a pretty beautiful logical way to solve that problem from Lynn dear Michael I'm listening to your interview with Tom Arnold right now you deserve an Emmy for keeping your composure had he'd do it thanks Lynn if you didn't see the interview it was pretty wild as ésta marled famously is he's a pretty wild guy I gotta say though because some some people kind of got it I think and some people gave these were saying pretty mean things about Tom I genuinely like Tom Arnold I do I really like the guy think he's a nice guy I think he's a genuine guy he's not he's really not rude regardless of what you saw in that interview I think he's a really nice guy who's a little out there on some of his premises so he said something very important yesterday about the difference between the left and the right right now he was so honest in his answer because I said Tom here are the facts and he said I yeah I don't care about that I don't care and I said but Tom there's just one reality because he said well this is how I feel and this is what it seems to me and if you're this and that Andrew and I said but there's one reality he said no there isn't there are multiple realities reality is subjective there's no such thing as objective truth and that is the disagreement between the left and the right that's the underlying premise that is why the left and the right just talk past each other is the right is saying there is an objective reality within and without an objective reality we couldn't communicate no way to communicate between people there's no way to do anything there's no way to understand any aspect of the world and the left says da da da da da da da right there there it's as radical subjectivism there's a radical willfulness that that's born into this modern era that largely comes from Nietzsche and this is radical but it goes back further than that it goes back to the early parts of the modern era all the way to the 16th century or prior could go back to the 14th century this rejection of reality and Tom beautifully and honestly showed that that the the right is living in reality and the left at its extremes and its craziness is denying reality when you deny reality things don't turn out very well from Laurie hi Michael I've been thinking about it recently I want to know your opinion on the death penalty and when it should be used and when not and what methods of executing a prisoner are humane and not humane I think it should be used I support the death penalty I think there were medical and health benefits to capital punishment people don't talk about this enough father Rutte lerm i friend and priest in new york wrote a wonderful piece on this I am quoting dr. Johnson who says you can depend upon it sir when a man knows to be hanged in that he's going to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully people should be hanged for crimes there is justice this is not an anti-christian a suggestion there's it's not anti-catholic it's not ooh it's quite clear from the Scriptures that capital punishment is a right of the civil authority and we so as a result there is something that's cruel and unusual I think about our criminal justice system which is that people can languish in prison for decades and decades and decades losing their mind I think that's cruel and unusual I think that's not human in the old days you could sleep it off at night or you could be in jail for a short period of time or you could be in jail turning small big rocks into small rocks for five years or you would be hanged this to me is a much more humane probably than letting someone languish in isolation for decades upon decades slowly depriving them of their Liberty and their humanity and as for the methods yeah they should be clean and easy I think it was Henry the Eighth who ordered a special guillotine from France that would be extra sharp for his wives never let it be said that he was a bad husband huh that's in short this is unpopular today among the touchy-feely people and the people who want to pervert religion to advance their sentimental points of view but there are plenty of good arguments for capital punishment and and when you let criminals run free there are plenty of bad things that happen to society from Jacob hey Michael I guess this will probably have to end on this one if we have now we got a couple minutes left hey Jacob hey Michael s he am I just having a conversation with my mailbag right now hey Michael as a conservative college student studying neuroscience and political science what advice do you have to make sure I balance my time between schoolwork fun confronting leftist campus lies and also looking into the future for my career love the show and hope to see you at U Michigan soon that's right I think I'm coming to you Michigan soon we'll try to have to hash that out so there are three things you can do in college I frequently said there's a time and a place for everything in that place is college there are three things you can do work play sleep and you can pick two I think basically you can pick two this this is what we were told when I was in college this is basically how I lived in college I slept I remember my sophomore year I slept no more than four hours a night every single night for at least a full semester I was taking five classes some of which met every day I was doing I think five plays I was directing an opera I was doing a lot of political work running a campaign starting a new campaign I was going out of my mind I did not sleep I was going out frequently you know going to parties and things like that and I don't regret it at all it's very important the social aspect of college is very very important don't let anybody tell you otherwise and the academic aspect is very important and the academic aspect is highlighted by the social aspect because you'll learn something or you'll read something and then you'll talk to your friends and and you'll have to argue about that or if your classes are total left-wing nonsense then your friends might say hey read this little book this isn't being taught in your political philosophy class but read this one this might change your thoughts so don't disregard the play at all you might have to disregard sleeeeep don't be unhealthy about it but you know it college is a tough time and it's very compact you're trying to fit in your education into four years I'm not one of these guys who's anti college really I mean colleges have been so corrupted and hollowed out by the left that it's very frustrating but I really believe in liberal education i I don't think you should just do some trade you know and say okay if you don't study engineering it's not worth getting an education I don't believe that for one second I think the humanities are basically the essence of they create the stuff of our consciousness and will really help us to come closer to our politics and to know ourselves and to know God better so you got it you got to really dive into it and you know don't don't disregard the party part either you know this is there's a time and a place for everything pal okay could we get one more question then do we have time for one one more one more she says okay from Dean hey Knowles I was curious about your thought your thoughts were on the Republican Party's stance on things that are objectively bad for the environment like the Keystone pipeline and expansion of offshore drilling just because things are hard to conserve does that mean we should not do it furthermore if you do not believe these things are harmful to the environment and surrounding ecosystems can you provide information as to why many thanks for what you do my mom and I love your show thank you to both of you for watching even that phrase is giving away the whole premise to the left harm the environment because what environmentalists do is they they make the environment the rocks and the trees and the water seemed like morally conscious actors so they anthropomorphize things that are not men that don't have moral qualities to them they say oh you're harming the environment what am i harming the earth is a rock I can't I'm not gonna harm a rock though the rock isn't gonna start crying because I harmed it mother nature isn't gonna weep that is crazy nonsense we are here and we have dominion over the earth and over the birds of the air and the fish of the sea and the animals that prowl around the ground and everything else around there we have dominion over that we need to take care of it why do when you have to take care of it so that we can enjoy it not because it has right not because you know it is deserving of some natural right or something it's for us we should be good stewards because we love the earth and we and we love our civilization in our society I don't see evidence that the advantages to all of humanity into civilization and lifting people out of poverty and allowing people to do new things and create more wealth and have a more opportunity to explore their interests and to explore culture and to explore their God and to have a relationship with their God I don't think that which all comes out of the ground in a beautiful little liquid called oil and natural gas when I don't think that the harming a few delta smelt or something is is a reason not to have any of those things you have to ask yourself what is the purpose of the environment what is the purpose of these is it because it's a moral actor with just as many rights as I have in just the same points of life as I have no of course not absolutely not so you have to ask yourself if the costs do do outweigh the benefits then you don't do something but I see no evidence of that with an oil pipeline or pumping more oil out of the ground drill baby drill because we're making America great again and that's and that's a good thing it's a good thing that we'll be more prosperous and we'll be able to give more to charity and we'll be able to live fuller lives and to explore both our physical enjoyments and our metaphysical enjoyments okay that's it we got a lot of good questions I had a really good one that someone was gonna ask me about why Ben and I disagree on the values of partisanship we'll just have to get to that next time we'll have to get to that now I'll be a team player it's Flag Day very briefly some early American flags everybody remembers this one this is the Betsy Ross flag with the circle of stars that's good they say this is the first American flag that isn't true the the first flag that we know was used by George Washington is this flag and appeal to heaven it's the Pinetree flag and on top it says an appeal to heaven this is referencing John Locke it's a it's a refutation of the Divine Right of Kings and it's saying we're not going to accept the Divine Right of Kings if they're doing a bad job we're going to appeal to his king which is an appeal to heaven it's an interesting first flag that a lot of people don't reference and then one of my favorite flags obviously there's the Gadsden flag which is that symbol of America the rattlesnake always a symbol of these colonies don't tread on me a wonderful symbol of that American can do get out of here pal don't you f with me kind of spirit that's a good one but my favorite one is the Grand Union Flag this was the first national flag of the United States it looks like an American flag with the stripes but it's got the Union Flag in there the the British flag in that top corner where the stars are and I really like this one and I'm glad it was the first national flag of the United States because it shows that we're not these radical revolutionaries who are cutting ourselves off from tradition we're inheriting a tradition from the old world and from the country that helped establish this country and there's a there's a long institutional history that goes back and I think it really grounds the American Revolution and something that's different than the French Revolution we don't start cutting off people's heads or in you know cutting off our king's head and trying to undo everything and burning down churches and creating new cults of reason what we do instead is we we take from the tradition and we keep what is so valuable about it we have a continuity with our our forebears who were pretty good guys and and great guys okay that's our show today we're at a time I'm
