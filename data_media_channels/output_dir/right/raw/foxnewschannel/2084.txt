00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:05,048
IT IS A FIERCE FIGHT.

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,385
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIGHT FOR

4
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,187

14
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:32,911
DOES THIS REPRESENT THE SPLIT IN

30
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:04,343
IN OUR CASE, BETTY SUTTON AND I

31
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:05,944
ARE RUNNING ON THE KITCHEN TABLE

00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:07,679
ISSUES THAT PEOPLE TALK TO US

33
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,782
ABOUT ALL OVER THE STATE, THINGS

34
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,251
THAT WORRY THEM WHEN LOOKING OUT

35
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,988

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,908
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'RE TRYING

49
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:38,010
IN A PRIMARY TO GO AFTER VOTERS

50
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,215

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:43,950
ISSUES.

53
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,585
>> WHAT I TRY TO DO IN A

54
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,386
CAMPAIGN IS TALK ABOUT WHAT I

55
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,521
WOULD DO IN THE OFFICE AND MAKE

56
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,723
PROMISES THAT I CAN KEEP AND

57
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:52,025
PROMISES THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

58
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:52,925
MAKING SURE WE DELIVER ON.

59
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:54,961
IN OUR CASE, IT IS FOCUSING ON

60
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,396
THOSE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES AND

61
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,365
LETTING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND --

WHAT CAN YOU DELIVER ON THAT

65
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:02,969
NEEDS CHANGE?

66
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,871
>> THESE ARE THE ECONOMIC ISSUES

67
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,373
THAT DOMINATE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:19,419
THEIR HEALTH CARE.

75
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,721
THERE'S A CIRCUS GOING ON IN

TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR

82
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,131
THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN.

EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT'S THE

85
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,668
KEY TO THE FUTURE.

86
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,804
WE HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM IN

87
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,107
OHIO WHERE A FOR PROFIT CHARTER

88
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,909
SCHOOL EXPERIMENT HAS DEVASTATED

89
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,479
MANY OF THE SCHOOLS, TAKING TONS

00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:01,829
HE HAS HAD TIME INSIDE POLITICS,

98
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:02,596
TIME OUTSIDE POLITICS.

99
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,566
HE WAS ON SHANNON BREAM'S SHOW

TAKE A LISTEN.

102
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,303
>> ONE OF THE MAIN CRITICISMS

103
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,105
THEY HAVE OF YOU, IS YOU SPENT

HE GOES ON TO SAY THEY WERE FAIR

111
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:25,253
AND BALANCED.

112
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,822
HE TOOK THEIR MONEY AND MADE

113
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:28,857
THEIR CHOICES.

114
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:33,194

>> LOOK, I THINK I STATED IT FOR

119
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,236
WHAT IT WAS.

120
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:42,638
EVERYBODY MAKES CHOICES IN LIFE.

121
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,339
WHEN I WAS STANDING UP FOR

122
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,442
CONSUMERS AND FIGHTING TO SEE

AND DEFENDING THEIR IDEALS WHICH

130
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:00,523
HE DID MANY TIMES ON OUR SHOW,

131
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,258
IS THAT SOMETHING TO KNOCK HIM

132
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:02,525
FOR?

133
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,960
I'M NOT CLEAR WHAT THE ATTACK

134
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,227
IS.

135
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,696
>> HE SAID ONE THING ON FOX NEWS

136
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:09,698
AND SAID DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE

137
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:10,466

NOW.

144
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,980
