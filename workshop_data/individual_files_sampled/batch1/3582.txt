my name is John stage and you're in the smokehouse of dinosaur barbecue today we're going to be doing st. Louis style spareribs first got to look at the meat if you look at this rack of rib you'll see that there's no bones so the pig has two two sets of ribs like a humor so in order to get a st. Louis rib you take off the chyme bone you square off the flaps you take the back flap off the meat and that's called a st. Louis cut you're looking for even meat coverage throughout the rack of ribs and you're also looking for marbling so after you've selected the right rack of ribs you bring it over here and we rub it down so ours is a collection of garlic salt pepper onion cumin chilies we just sprinkle it on we don't want to clog the pores of the meat what this does it forms a nice crust which what we call a bark this is where the fat the meat the smoke and the spice all comes together and gives you a nice nice bark so after we rub the ribs we're going to put them in our smokers and what we do is we take Hickory logs we burn it down to cold and then we add Hickory on top of the burning coals the coals give it the heat the Hickory gives it a nice smoke most important thing is the fire getting your fire and your temperature right if you had the fire directly underneath now you'd be grilling barbecue is about indirect heat smoke having almost a convection effect so we put them in about 250 degrees and about four hours later and then what we like to do is give them a little mop as soon as they come out and what the mop does keeps that bark pliable there's very little sugar in this it's a vinegar base mop a little bit of apple juice some spices just going to glaze it a little bit of sauce you want to put your sauce on at the end don't put it on in the middle don't put it definitely don't put it on in the beginning our sauce has a low sugar content but if you happen to have a sauce I share content that sauce is going to burn your salsa burn before your meat gets good so look at your sauce as a condiment or as a glazing towards the end or a cup we've got the right balance again smoke spice and that meat just pulls away from the bone sauce and pure pork textures right on that's good rib you
