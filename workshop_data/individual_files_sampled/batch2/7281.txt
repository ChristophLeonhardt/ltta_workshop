there's a new book coming out called devil's bargain Steve ban and Donald Trump and the storming of the presidency it appears to be an account from insiders now what happened during the campaign it is written by Bloomberg business weeks Josh or green and a Daily Mail has some excerpts from it now and I'm going to quote you from those excerpts and one is about chris Christie and it is a doozy I love this story apparently on election night Christie talked to President Obama already that's surprising and interesting so maybe it was more than just a hug that they shared during superstorm sandy and and was going to make an offer to Donald Trump about the concession call so let's pick it up from there Christie said hey Donald the president talked to me earlier the two had gotten to know each other after superstorm sandy Christie said if you want he's gonna call you call my phone and I'll pass it over to you I guess that's slightly weird you would presumably Obama's Trump's number and could call him it's not that weird if somebody offered that to me I'm like okay great Madam President give me your phone Chris and and their allies chris Christie was the first to back him the Republican field risk his whole political career to help Donald Trump so I wouldn't think twice about that but Donald Trump is a different kind of guy so listen to his reaction Trump flashed a look of annoyance clearly resenting the intrusion and was repulsed by the idea of having somebody else's phone next to his face okay so it turns out there's two problems with chris Christie's offer that I would it would not have occurred to me number one is he's a germaphobe trumpets so he's like oh I don't want this guy's germs on me if I take his phone but you know he has the stain for Chris Christie he said on camera many times hey we're gonna have for example he's like oh we're gonna not eat Oreo cookies anymore because they moved their plan to Mexico and that includes you Chris right and he has told other people that he doesn't like the way Chris Christie looks and and this is well reported that Trump judges people based on their looks in appearance and they have to look like and he has said this too literally in public they have to look like they're from central casting and he doesn't like that Chris Christie's overweight so the idea of touching his phone to his face as I go well you disgust me what a terrible guy Chris Christie I can't stand him either but for other reasons but if you're Donald Trump he helped you tremendously by giving you that endorsement after he dropped out of the race and then he stood like a schmuck behind you and all those perfect press conferences him back to you and you're like oh he's so disgusting I don't want to touch his phone okay maybe he's got an illness with German for whatever okay the second part of it is that no this is my ego like person like me I don't even like yeah he can call me on my phone or he can call me on my friend's phone what difference does it make no for Trump that's a big big deal no in order to respect me you have to call me on my phone what the so he says Trump told Christie hey Chris you know my fucking phone number just give it to the president I don't want your fucking phone $0.08 Christie's move was quote the ultimate mistake and one from which you quote wouldn't recover that's how you make your decisions because he tweaked your ego in a way that I wouldn't even understand and because you didn't want to touch the germs on his phone and that's it he's right there look Chris Christie denies it till the you know and to that of the hearse put out a long steam in the end of it said the author should be ashamed of himself in passing office account as true it is fiction but the proofs in the pudding no offense Chris because Chris Christie didn't get any job in the administration after risking his career after delivering for Donald Trump after do all that he got bupkis he got nothing why if this was a part of it look there are other factors to Chris Christie prosecuted Jared Kushner's father that was a huge part of it but even if this was a small factor in it it gives you a sense of how irrational and petty Donald Trump is he's an absolute child and there's the guy running the country built independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
