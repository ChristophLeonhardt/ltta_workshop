how many people do you think will be wet
ah I'll say - I guess I'll throw a
number out if it's your hook then hey
that's my life already so it's cool
instead of a Hello I just put help nice
alright okay okay I think I definitely
prefer girls who have been in a
relationship before or at least maybe a
long-term relationship because they
really kind of know what it's like to be
in relationship and starting something
new with somebody who's never had that
it's a lot harder
Wow okay not getting a lot of them out
unconscious okay we'll go for the
clickbait first you know getting
experimental in the bedroom is always
fun for me that sounds like I'm
Christian Grey but nothing too crazy I
don't like like things getting boring
I just like position:relative
cool got that out of the way I guess I
think icily wise I have zero preference
I genuinely find you you like any race
but when it comes like physical
attributes definitely prefer girls who
are either a couple inches taller than
me or shorter I don't mind that it when
it girls a little bit taller than me but
if it's over like two inches maybe I
feel a little bit weird
cool cool I don't like you when girls
believe in horoscopes
she's like the weirdest thing ever
but I hate it when someone's like oh I'm
a Libra
I don't think me to click the moon's
aren't aligned for this this month so we
can't really you know get OVA because we
wouldn't click I hate that shit
man okay I like girls who are into the
Arts in my creative arts so people who
are already down that path when we start
dating love studying arts or you know
anything within that field career was
that's something to talk about you know
I can't talk about accounting cuz I
don't know shit about accounting so
definitely like someone who lines within
my interests within the arts whether
that be music physical painting acting
camera whatever
sorry hi nice to meet everyone sorry i'm
motoki okay listen that nice to meet you
Julia nice to meet you how there nice to
meet you guys funny responses I was fine
okay
work was like fun but also terrifying I
don't want to shit myself that whole
time I was surprised at how many people
had not been in a long-term relationship
maybe I was too specific on my my dates
but I was kind of interesting just like
you know from the get-go
yeah I guess I guess the everyone's true
colors comes out as time passes I guess
getting the few preferences out first is
kind of nice but I can't really say that
I would want to get in a relationship
with somebody based on just you know
guidelines that I set
it's hard I'm not a picky guy you know
I'm a lover of all beings as always I'd
