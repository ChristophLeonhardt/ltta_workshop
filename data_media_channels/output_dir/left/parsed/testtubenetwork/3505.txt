Republic of Nauru, Oceania
The small island of Nauru has one of the highest
rates of obesity and diabetes in the world.
After gaining independence in 1968, Nauru
underwent an economic boon from mining.
Â 
The increased wealth led to more sedentary
lifestyles and an influx in Western imports.
Traditional fish and garden diets were replaced
with cheap, processed food.
Now, nearly 80% of the population is overweight.
Officials hope nutrition education and exercise
programs will help change Nauruan lifestyles.
