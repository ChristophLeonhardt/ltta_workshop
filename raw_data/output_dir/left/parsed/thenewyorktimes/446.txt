Enock GLidden is a paraplegic
rock climber.
He relies on his arms to climb
with the help of adaptive
equipment.
Last year, he finished an
1,800-foot route
in Yosemite Valley.
It took nearly 4,000 pull-ups.
This is one of many climbing
trips organized
by Paradox Sports for people
with disabilities.
The climbers on this trip are
already experienced
and will focus on 
particular skills.
Adam Payne was diagnosed 
with Ataxia, a rare disease 
that affects muscle 
coordination, in 1997.
He is a national gold medalist
in competitive adaptive
climbing.
Shawn Sturges became blind 
just after he turned 18.
He's been climbing for less
than two years,
and was on the U.S. 
national team in the
Paraclimbing World Championship
in 2016.
After losing my sight,
I've learned to
kind of go into the unknown
and not worry about what's
ahead of me but enjoy the
moment.
I love climbing because it
shows me that life isn't over.
