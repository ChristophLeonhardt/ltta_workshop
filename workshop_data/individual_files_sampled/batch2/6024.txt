Donald Trump world of trouble not only is there a grand jury that was announced today pursuing their case on the Russia investigation special counsels ask for that but his poll numbers are absolutely disastrous now literally from day one I predicted that he would get into the 20s and he started in the high 30s low 40s so it's not that bold a prediction and since then but people always talking about narratives of comeback Rick Nano comeback from Trump he goes down and then goes further down look at all of his businesses down then further down then complete bankruptcy so we're in the middle of that trajectory downwards so the new numbers disastrous and now we're finally nearing the 20s and this is a Quinnipiac University poll very respected 33 percent approved 61 percent disapprove I think that could be summarized in one word disaster okay 33 percent for a president is awful at any point in their administration but six seven months in you're already at 33 percent it's almost a two to one ratio of disapproval to approval disaster and the Republican senators have started to run away from him already you saw Jeff Flake earlier in the week his hair on fire running from the building all right how's he doing among Democrats because sometimes it is a honeymoon stage another party will give you a chance it's a very American tradition actually a surprising number of Democrats didn't want to give them a chance in the beginning that's why is numbers when all the way up to maybe like it there max 44 45 % so how's he doing with Democrats that knew the jury said 2 percent approval 96 percent disapproval it look you might think that's obvious no I've never seen numbers at large not during george w bush not during reagan 2 percent approval it almost literally can't get any worse than that you got two points left to go trump how about republicans now of course much healthier number with the republicans but these are not good numbers either it's 76 percent approval you might think that's really high 17 percent disapproval sure i mean that's a nice ratio for him but that number has gone down significantly normally you have you'll hold easily 85% of your own guys especially when you're president and if you're doing well you'll go up to 95% etc right to be down at 76% and dropping and I think he lost about nine points with Republicans recently so you know part of the reason he's losing Republican voters are they're finally figuring out what I've been telling him also actually before day one working for about two years during the primaries in the general election I said he could win I said he's a populist you gotta watch out you got to be careful but the number one thing about Trump is that he's incompetent so now the Republicans are going oh you couldn't pass the health care repeal of Obamacare you couldn't pass anything not doing anything right the other problem is that he's firing somebody every single week you're not an apprentice anymore okay you're not supposed to fire one person to each week so the incompetence is just now so obvious that even a decent chunk of Republicans are going yeah that looks pretty bad and conservative media has started to turn on them so Levin of all people so talk radio Breitbart even and now lately Drudge Report starting to criticize Donald Trump world of trouble but most important is independence because there is now a significant chunk of independence people always talk about the two ends and how the country's so polarized but the independence grow every single day and in the old days independence sometimes would be Republican light or concerta light these days none of independents are truly independent and they can swing in either direction and they definitely do swing elections so this is the most important number thirty-four percent approve sixty percent disapprove so now that's not the ninety six percent disapproval the Democrats have but sixty percent disapprove is really bad only thirty four percent among independents means he has lost the middle of the country so if you think he's competent enough to mount a comeback and actually regain them have added Haas how much would you like to bet on that because that ain't going to happen it's only going to go further down all right now more bad news sixty-three percent of respondents feel Russia attempted to influence the election now you could say okay that's it's fairly clear and given that both the Obama intelligence agencies and they're not Obama's and they're not Trump's their intelligence agencies overall but they did have Obama appointees when he was in charge obviously and now they have Trump appointees and both sets of appointees agree there's no question that Russia meddled in our elections so that 63% number is actually surprisingly low I think it's a little bit of like fu to the establishment media that won't stop talking about it so they're like now whatever right but the reality is even if there was Russian meddling but there was no deal with Trump then it's not that big a deal so that's the most important question let's go to that 58 percent believe the president has tried to derail or obstruct the investigation into Russian election interference that's very bad news for the president I don't know if he knows that's illegal and then one final category from a different poll gen4 forward survey on Millennials you thought the general population didn't like and wait there yet a lot of Millennials so every category he let's put it of every category of Millennials can't stand them african-americans have them at 10 percent 76 percent disapproval Asians have met 67 percent disapproval Latinos have at 68 percent disapproval these are horrible but look the white vote is what got him the presidency in the first place and among Millennials they're not buying it they're not going along with the rest of the white population especially the evangelical white population that voted for them at an 81 percent clip no among white Millennials 29 percent approval 55 percent disapproval so mr. president there aren't a lot of people that still like you and this is not three years in this is not the second term the jury is in a matter of speaking maybe the it will be literal soon but in this case the jury's already come in seven months into your presidency and they pretty much can't stand you and they're right support independent media and get the whole young turks to our show and other Network shows all ad-free TYT Network comm /join come join us today
