that actual choice Rosie what that guy
turned around they fight me the auction
guy Jeffrey nearly strangled he had
access to the bowl after the export on
stage had it right before we stolen it

you I'm really sorry this happened
but it is this one more why all right we
did okay we got a plan we might find the
bowl
probably not we're probably not gonna
find the ball okay ah shit okay I think
we're getting own unique ending here do
you think we're gonna be able to do it I
I don't I think there's a here's what I
think guys I think this game has
multiple endings and there's only one
good anyway
oh um okay as you can see I asked the
girl for the beginning but we had some
party to go to
some bit fragrant why'd you come back
here doing extra shift
yeah well things should have gotten way

you here um I'm here to see someone can
you tell me what room Sebastian the
Clarkson place is he here

reaction it's room
well like it was just a key oh come on
hold at night doc this isn't about some
entry ticket to some party yeah this is
way bigger what's so important that you
need to see him now
explain it's complicated
ever since we met this evening - just
got worse and worse

I messed up and you can't go back in a
stupid game hello I'm here to visit
Sebastian the clock bear with me a
second
7:00
no patient by that name so he must have
misheard the name of the hospital thanks
anyway
oh shit
but didn't they see me just go I was
smart reading the reflection their
glasses that's cool
okay I didn't mess that one up but I've
this the kind it's annoying me now
I keep thinking to myself I have to
think about the decisions but they're
too quick I can't decide instantly okay
703 that's it there it is
he doesn't seem awake I don't think we
could talk to him he's gonna recognize
me
Oh shitty Oh
good plan oh he knows me are you doing
here oh you shouldn't be no Sebastian
rocky oh yeah I'm a peaceful man okay I
do not want to hurt you don't say that I
drove her to get I swear to God
the bits of you hug
John Stanley another deal slobber on the
hand oh nasty
alright now where's the pole down the
way the bowl is damn it
tell me about your deal with Sam your
part tell me I know your place to pull
some rice ball with a forgery editor let
as a lie keep bluffing do you want to
discuss that with the police may know
little gander at the surveillance
footage with them they've already seen
the footage of the robbery maybe what
about the footage of you after you left
the main auction are all of we're back
station nothing
he'd not scare me there's nothing you
can do I've it's just a matter of time
until the truth will find you oh shit
Oh where's the rice ball stolen look at
me I was beaten up where is it oh where
I put the original oh I know you switch
this button where is it thank you taking
over sir it's the definite ID
what were you able to cook this oh my
god thank you thank God well Jesus
Christ I swept it I swept the original
with the forgery and hid it the cabinet
passed cabinet bought in auction there
was a secret compartment in the right
this is that wears a ball silicide I
don't know this is the truth you see
George you took everything to the safe
storage after the robbery
okay cold storage so we know so still
inside Hainsworth maybe okay I'm gonna
be shipped apart
small items such as this mostly the next
day but pirates friends on the board he
probably managed to ship it out tonight
so get off the bowl already where's that
bloody ball where's the bloody ball
feels like a 50/50 chance his house I
don't know tell me see that was such a
big thing perhaps you can squeeze him
very lightly where can I find him
Primrose Hill
I've never here right
you never heard about a hidden
compartment
shit hey I think I made it I made a big
one I think I made I don't know it you
think it was a right idea going to his
house rather than the auction house
because the thing is the auction must
have like a bunch of police near it so
what's the point of sneaking in there
I'm returning back to the scene of the
crime I might as well go to his house
that's what I was thinking okay so it
looks like we're here Jesus Christ guys
we're gonna die I think we're gonna die
by the Chinese I don't know do you think
I could have died already I don't think
my choices were that bad I don't know I
think I don't know we'll see we'll see
what happens
I don't think I made so I definitely
made some wrong decisions
good morning morning 1 Samuel Park mr.
Park does not receive guests before 10
o'clock I want to see him and I want to
see him right now wait here don't wait
hey buddy barge in
mr. pod mr. pod this man says thank you

today hello you intrude at the crack of
dawn my friend
I assume it's urgent how long the
original original of what you know I'm
talking about do enlighten me the rice
bowl the fucking rice bowl I bet if
you're referring to the hospitalist over
from Hainsworth last night that piece is
gone lost forever I feel that's not true
no is it not because what was stolen was
a copy the original is safe and in your
possession and you are not you can call
me map yeah well mr. Matt how did you
come by this extraordinary theory they
arranged a copy for you and you
organized the robbery and you have proof
to back up this outrageous Londo yes
Tony proof me we're not in court are we
I know what I know yeah that you fucked
up my life
for a piece of fucking pottery language
dear boy don't get confused all this I
don't know about you deal with Sebastian
o'clock yeah smuggling the original out
of the auction house hidden inside a
wooden chesty ball this is quite the
little work of fiction isn't it hot
again by this not gained anything I'm
gonna dying
Gillan begin to discuss listen to me
although I take perhaps we should
discuss it with the police what do you
say to that
oh it's not to default but to wait
alright sensibly in my study yeah isn't
he now is just gonna give me the ball
just because I smashed up one pot house
that was he's gonna press a panic button
now I know all these rich people have
like panic buttons as obvious was gonna
happen right boy watch out first of all
I don't know since it was stolen I've
lost track that's a lie it's the truth
no use force
what do you think the choice have to say
all of this the choice will never
believe you I am a respected member of
the community and you clearly are not
what him I'm not leaving here I don't
know where it is
