THANK YOU.

2
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:03,530
HIGHER GAS PRICES RAISING

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,931
QUESTIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE

4
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:05,599
BACKLASH AGAINST PRESIDENT

5
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,032

THINGS COULD GET WORSE AS THE

CHRIS STIREWALT, GOOD

17
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:29,456
AFTERNOON TO YOU.

18

>>  --DY, MA'AM.

23
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:39,399
>> WE LOOK AT THE FOUR-MONTH

24
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:39,833
DIFFERENCE.

25
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,168
TODAY'S PRICE IS $2.97, IT'S

26
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,370
ALMOST $3.00.

27
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,639
FOUR MONTHS AGO IN JANUARY

28
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:45,972
$2.56.

29
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:48,108
SO IF YOU ARE FILLING UP AN

30
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:50,010
AVERAGE TANKS OF GAS, ABOUT 12

31
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,945
GALLONS YOU ARE PAYING FIVE

32
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:53,680
BUCKS MORE OUT OF YOUR POCKET

33
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,382
TO FILL UP THE TANK.

34
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:56,449
>> IF YOU LIVE IN A PLACE

35
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:57,918
WHERE I GREW UP, PEOPLE DRIVE

36
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:59,519
A LONG WAY TO WORK OFTEN

37
00:00:59,519 --> 00:00:59,819
TIMES.

38
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:01,154
FARTHER WEST YOU GO IN THE

39
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:04,724
UNITED STATES FROM HERE IN THE

40
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,259
OSCELLA CORRIDOR, THE DAYS AND

41
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:07,561
THE COMMUTES ARE LONGER FOR

42
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,529
PEOPLE IN THE METROPLEXES.

43
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,897
NOW, WE DO KNOW THAT THE

44
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:12,832
RUSSIANS AND THE SAUDIS ARE

45
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:13,667
RETHINKING WHETHER OR NOT THEY

46
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,634
WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME IN

47
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,103
REGARD TO INCREASED GAS

48
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:17,737
PRICES.

49
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,040
HOWEVER, WE KNOW FROM 2004,

50
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,541
2006 THERE IS A LOT OF

51
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,376
POLITICAL HISTORY TO SUGGEST

52
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:26,112
THAT THE HIGHER THE GAS PRICES

53
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:27,480
ARE, THE WORSE IT IS FOR THE

54
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,783
PARTY IN POWER.

55
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,184
EVEN IF THERE IS NOTHING TO DO

56
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,420
TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME AND IT'S

57
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,590
NOT THEIR FAULT, VOTERS TAKE

58
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,058
OUT FRUSTRATIONS ON WHAT

59
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:42,162
PINCHES THE POCKETBOOK.

60
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:43,430
AND NOTHING PINCHES IT MORE

61
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,831
THAN GAS PRICES.

62
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:45,532
>> Sandra: IT IS SOMETHING

63
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:46,733
YOU SEE EVERY DAY AND YOU KNOW

64
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,567
WHEN THEY ARE UP.

65
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,668
WHAT DOES IT DO FOR

66
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:49,603
REPUBLICANS RUNNING ON THE TAX

67
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:49,970
CUTS?

68
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,339
THE SAVINGS TO A MIDDLE CLASS

69
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:53,873
FAMILY OF FOUR, WITH THE

70
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:57,177
AVERAGE INCOME OF $85,000,

71
00:01:57,177 --> 00:02:00,914
WILL SAVE $2,250 ON THE 2018

72
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:01,348
TAXES.

73
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:03,016
WELL, WITH THE HIGHER GAS

74
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:04,718
PRICES YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

75
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:05,919
THE OVERALL GASOLINE

76
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,187
EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT THAT

77
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:08,154
MUCH IN 2018.

78
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:13,159
THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE $2NA

79
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,828
$2NA -- $2,300.

80
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:16,162
>> I WOULD DEFER TO YOU ON

81
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:17,063
MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND

82
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:17,998
ECONOMY BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR

83
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:18,298
STUFF.

84
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:19,633
BUT I THINK YOU BACK ME UP ON

85
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:20,233
THIS.

86
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,203
WE HAD A STAGNANT ECONOMY FOR

87
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:25,538
GROWTH IN THE 2% RANGE.

88
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:26,873
IT WAS SLOW-GOING.

89
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:32,012
NOW WE ARE SEEING KICKED UP

90
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:32,545
GROWTH.

91
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:33,680
GALLUP FOUND TWO WEEKS AGO

92
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,948
THAT AMERICANS WERE MORE

93
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:35,882
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE CHANCES

94
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:37,817
OF GETTING A GOOD JOB RIGHT

95
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:38,852
NOW THEN THEY HAD BEEN SINCE

96
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:40,253
TAKING THE MEASURE OVER THE

97
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:40,754
PAST 17 YEARS.

98
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,188
THERE IS GENERAL OPTIMISM.

99
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:43,757
WHEN THE ECONOMY GETS BETTER,

100
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:44,424
WHAT HAPPENS?

101
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:45,625
INFLATION THAT HAD BEEN IN THE

102
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,860
OFFING WHEN THINGS WERE

103
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,128
FLATTER STARTS TO KICK IN.

104
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,963
PRICES START TO RISE.

105
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,564
AND PEOPLE FEEL THE PINCH.

106
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:52,966
THE DOLLARS DON'T GO AS FAR.

107
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,034
THAT IS ONE OF THE

108
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,835
CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU GET

109
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:56,336
FASTER GROWTH.

110
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,570
WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FEDERAL

111
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,004
RESERVE DOES.

112
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,539
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT PAUL RYAN

113
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:00,573
AND MITCH McCONNELL ARE

114
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:01,775
LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE FEDERAL

115
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,043
RESERVE AND THE ECONOMIC

116
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,044
INDICATORS BECAUSE THEY KNOW

117
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,378
THE OVERALL HEALTH -- YES, GAS

118
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,780
IS PART OF IT -- BUT THE

119
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,681
OVERALL HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY

120
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,716
AND THE OVERALL COST OF WHAT

121
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,751
WE CALL THAT, THE BASKET, THE

122
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:13,119
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX BASKET.

123
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,688
>> Sandra: FOR GOOD, CHRIS

124
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:15,188
STIREWALT.

125
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:16,656
>> SEE, I PAID ATTENTION.

126
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,525
>> Sandra: THE OLD ADAGE ON

127
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,893
THE TRADING FLOOR "NOTHING

128
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:21,494
CURES HIGH PRICES LIKE HIGH

129
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:21,861
PRICES."

130
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,129
WE ARE ALREADY GETTING TO THE

131
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:23,463
LEVELS.

132
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:26,132
WE ARE SEEING A HUGE CHANGE IN

133
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,333
OIL.

134
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,703
IT'S DOWN $3.00, ABOUT A 4%

135
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,070
DROP.

136
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,237
SO WE WILL SEE AND SOMETIMES

137
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:32,739
THE HIGH PRICES ARE JUST A

138
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,174
REFLECTION TO YOUR POINT OF A

139
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:35,275
STRONG AND GROWING ECONOMY.

140
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,243
I GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IVANKA

141
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:37,677
TRUMP.

142
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,111
>> OKAY.

143
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,312
>> Sandra: WHAT IS HER

144
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:39,813
FUTURE?

145
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:41,448
>> WELL, SHE HAS A SECURITY

146
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:41,981
CLEARANCE NOW.

147
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,583
AND SO DOES HER HUSBAND.

148
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,351
THEY SORT OF HAVE WAITED IT

149
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:45,719
OUT.

150
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,955
FOR A PERIOD, HER BROTHER DON

151
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:59,032
JR. WAS THE POLITICALLY

152
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:04,037
ATTENDANT ONE ON TRAIL.

153
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:05,405
SHE IN THE END HAS NOT BEEN

154
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:06,372
TOUCHED BY THIS.

155
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,974
SHE IS A LESS COMPLICATED

156
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:11,044
FIGURE FOR THE FAMILY ON THE

157
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:15,148
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

158
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:18,451
SHE IS BACK ON THE ASCENDSY

159
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:20,153
AND BACK ON THE RISE.

160
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:21,620
SHE CAN HELP IN THE DISTRICTS

161
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,622
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE IS

162
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:22,922
GOING.

163
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,891
SHE CAN HELP WHAT REPUBLICANS

164
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:26,493
NEED VERY MUCH, WHICH IS

165
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:36,703
OUTREACH TO EDUCATED, MORE

166
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:37,337
AFFLUENT SUBURBAN WOMEN.

167
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,304
THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WILL

168
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,039
NEED IN A LOT OF DISTRICTS.

169
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,108
>> Sandra: SHE HAS BEEN A

170
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:43,076
CLEAR PRESENCE ALONGSIDE OF

171
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:43,576
THE PRESIDENT.

172
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,779
HE CLEARLY WANTS HER AND NEEDS

173
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,579
HER BY HIS SIDE.

174
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,148
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LEFT

175
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,382
WONDERING WHAT IS IVANKA TRUMP

176
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,151
TEN YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS

177
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:52,552
FROM NOW?

178
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:53,820
WHAT WILL HER ROLE BE IN

179
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,287
WASHINGTON?

180
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,488
>> I WISH I COULD SEE WHAT

181
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:56,523
WOULD HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER.

182
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:57,557
YOU CAN'T START ASKING ME

183
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:58,792
ABOUT TEN YEARS FROM NOW.

184
00:04:58,792 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sandra: C'MON, YOU KNOW
