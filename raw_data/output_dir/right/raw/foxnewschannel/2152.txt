1
00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:02,682
NEVER LISTEN TO.

2
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:04,717
>> ALL RIGHT, JOHN ROBERTS LIVE

3
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:06,185
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THANK YOU.

4
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:07,286
FOR MORE ON WHAT THIS COULD MEAN

5
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:09,389
FOR THE PRESIDENT LEGALLY, WE

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,058
TURN TO THE JUDICIAL ANALYST

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:13,393
JUDGE NAPOLITANO, MAYBE WE PUT

8
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:15,528
YOU IN THE CATEGORY OF THOSE WHO

9
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:16,729
DO NOT TOTALLY BELIEVE THE STORY

10
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,563
ON THE PEN REGISTER.

11
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:19,399
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STORY ON

12
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,634
THE PEN REGISTER, ON A DAY IN

13
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:24,203
WHICH THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF

14
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:26,439
LAWYER THREW A BOMB SHELL INTO

15
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:27,440
MANY OF THE PRESIDENT'S

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,408
DEFENSES, DO YOU REALLY THINK

17
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:29,108
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS

18
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:31,144
GOING TO ADMIT THAT THEY LISTEN

19
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:32,244
TO PHONE CALLS FROM THE

20
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:32,612
PRESIDENT?

21
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:34,247
THEY MAY NOT HAVE RECORDED IT,

22
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:35,682
BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WERE

23
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:36,049
LISTENING.

24
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,083
IF THEY WERE LISTENING THEY

25
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,052
CANNOT USE ANYTHING THEY HEAR AS

26
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,620
A BASIS FOR AN AFFIDAVIT.

27
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,288
A PROBABLE CAUSE OR IN A

28
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:43,322
PROSECUTION.

29
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:44,924
THEY CAN SEND THEM SEEKING OTHER

30
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:47,427
MEANS TO ATTAIN EVIDENCE TO

31
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:47,960
SUPPORT THAT.

32
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,628
>> Shannon: PARALLEL

33
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:49,362
RECONSTRUCTION COMING UP ON

34
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:50,496
SOMETHING THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED

35
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:52,732
TO HAVE ACCESS TO SO YOU FIND A

36
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:54,267
DIFFERENT WAY TO GET ACCESS TO

37
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:54,534
IT.

38
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,469
>> A DIFFERENT AND LAWFUL WAY SO

39
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:57,870
THAT YOU CAN PRESENTED TO A

40
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,171
COURT.

41
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,641
WHEN MICHAEL COHEN ASKS THE

42
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,976
DOCUMENT CEASED BY THE FBI BE

43
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:05,311
RETURNED, THE GOVERNMENT SAID

44
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,413
THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE HERE

45
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:09,282
BECAUSE OF THE CRIME FRAUD

46
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:09,649
EXCEPTION.

47
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,218
THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAD ENOUGH

48
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:13,219
INFORMATION FROM THOSE PHONE

49
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:13,920
CALLS TO SUGGEST THAT MICHAEL

50
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,622
COHEN OR HIS CLIENT WERE

51
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,725
PARTICIPATING IN A CRIME OR A

52
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,027
FRAUD AND MASKING THE PHONE

53
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:22,028
CALLS AS ATTORNEY-CLIENT

54
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:23,196
PRIVILEGE, AND THEY WEREN'T.

55
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,631
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK THROUGH

56
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:26,933
THE POTENTIAL LEGAL

57
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:27,567
RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT RUDY

58
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,268
GIULIANI REVEALED LAST NIGHT.

59
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,470
HE SAYS HE DISCUSSED IT WITH THE

60
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:30,837
PRESIDENT.

61
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,004
HERE'S WHAT HE TWEETED OUT

62
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:32,305
TODAY.

63
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:35,908
WE WILL WALK THROUGH THIS,

64
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:38,311
"MR. COHEN, RETAINING A MONTHLY

65
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,979
RETAINER NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

66
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,614
CAMPAIGN FROM WHICH HE ENTERED

67
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,382
INTO THROUGH REIMBURSEMENT OF

68
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:44,851
PRIVATE CONTRACT BETWEEN TWO

69
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,285
PARTIES, KNOWN AS A

70
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:47,987
NONDISCLOSURE, THESE AGREEMENTS

71
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:48,588
ARE VERY COMMON AGAINST

72
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:49,889
CELEBRITIES AND PEOPLE AS WELL

73
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:51,257
IN THIS CASE IT IS IN FULL FORCE

74
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:53,159
AND EFFECT AND WILL BE USED IN

75
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,028
ARBITRATION FOR DAMAGES AGAINST

76
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:56,796
DISCOVERED.

77
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:59,465
THE AGREEMENT WAS TO STOP THE

78
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:01,434
FALSE COMMENTS MADE BY HER ABOUT

79
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,168
AN AFFAIR HAVING ALREADY SIGNED

80
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,469
A DETAILED LETTER ADMITTING

81
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,705
THERE WAS NO AFFAIR.

82
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:06,572
PRIOR TO THE VIOLATION BY

83
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,574
MISS CLIFFORD AND HER ATTORNEY

84
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,210
THIS WAS A PRIVATE AGREEMENT.

85
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,779
IF PLAYED NO ROLE IN THIS

86
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:13,212
TRANSACTION."

87
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:14,347
SO NOW WE GET TO THE QUESTION OF

88
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:17,250
HOW THIS MONEY WAS REPAID TO

89
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,584
MICHAEL COHEN, IS THERE

90
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,586
POTENTIAL FOR A FRAUD CHARGE?

91
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:22,355
>> THERE IS POTENTIAL HERE,

92
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,490
BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

93
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,391
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ABLE TO SAY

94
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,193
THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE

95
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,628
AGREEMENT IS HIS NAME DOES NOT

96
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,128
APPEAR IN THERE.

97
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,129
AND HE DID NOT SIGN IT.

98
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:33,399
MICHAEL COHEN AND MS. DANIELS

99
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:37,203
THEN EMPLOYER, NOT HER CURRENT

100
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:39,005
LAWYER USED A PSEUDONYM, DAVID

101
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,807
DENNISON IN PLACE OF

102
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,842
DONALD TRUMP, SO THE QUESTION IS

103
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,076
IT EVEN A

104
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,411
VALUED AGREEMENT, BECAUSE IT

105
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:47,180
BINDS THE PRESIDENT DID NOT

106
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,981
ACTUALLY SIGN IT.

107
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,616
THE PRESIDENT IS CORRECT WHEN HE

108
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,185
SAYS A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

109
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,452
IS COMMON, WITH RESPECT TO

110
00:02:53,452 --> 00:00:00,000
CELEBRITIES.
