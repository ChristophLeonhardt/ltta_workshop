the shot heard round the world and no I'm not talking about the Hawaiian volcanoes or a little rocket man crossing the DMZ I'm talking about the announcement from gretchen carlson the head of Miss America announcing they will no longer judge people based on appearance and abolish the swimsuit competition obviously I'm not allowed to have an opinion on this thank goodness for my guest Maria Montgomery now Maria was Miss Kentucky USA 2009 and was a runner-up at Miss USA and she went on to be a full-time model at companies like Ford models in Wilhemina LA her print works include things like JCPenney Kohl's Sears Nike Maybelline Olay and Victoria's Secret she is also the live announcer at the UK men's basketball home games but most impressively she was featured in the Dustin Tavella music video forget about me Maria thanks so much for coming on that's right that was the best one you haven't seen it go check it out it's fantastic this controversy is really geared at one specific part I guess at the competition so as someone who has walked the runway in high heels in a swimsuit what was it like for you what is it like no you know it wasn't that bad you assume that is gonna be bad and for my and since I had Donald Trump on the front row and it's you know you're on national television when you're doing it but I studied it as if it was a sport and I worked hard for it so not is the physical aspect but how to walk how to have the energy and how to make it fun it's not just about the physical appearance whatsoever I've also judged countless pageants I've judged miss to the scene Miss Georgia Miss Michigan and several others and the prettiest girl this does not always win yeah okay my next question has to be do you have a Trump story whenever we met him you're in like a great big circle and you he came up to each one but it was you know with everyone there so all the stories about him coming in the dressing around so there's just complete lies there's no way that's possible cuz it's such a public event and the security is so high but anyways um so he was coming down the line and I think I was like I was towards the beginning wasn't the first ten girls about the states and I you know he shake her hand and talk to us or whatnot and when you shook my hand I said thank you so much for having us since he is who was behind the whole thing yeah thank you took a step back and he said what do you do all Trumpster like person a and so of course we talked for a little bit but to this day I think he's what put me in the top 15 but another thing when he walked in the room he walked a dog for him to meet us they have the great big TVs showing the feed it's kind of because it was a dress rehearsal for the actual pageant and so he came in he can see the back of his head when he walked in and he said he said I wanna hear is not that bad is it cuz he could see funnier than I thought he'd be bad same time he was exactly the way that you see him on TV so III do want to go to this quote by Gretchen when she was discussing how they were going to judge this from now on she said we will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance what but will rather judge on what makes you you and I don't know how do you judge what makes you you that's my question that's an interesting take on that um I think I guess what I hope that they're saying is that they're trying to judge on you know is each girl the best version of herself possible instead of saying you have to be you know 510 and over and thin and long maybe I'm hoping I'm not sure but I'm hoping that she means that you that they're gonna be judging each girl individually but at the same time that's very difficult because they have comparative judging at least I have in the past where you have all the girls stand up together which makes from the judging panel a lot easier because you can see them side by side yeah I have like I gotta get some pushback on this specifically because I came from I've been judged in my performance my entire life almost with track and field and like you said it's not going to be fair if you know people that are 510 in this or between there's a high trains that or does the best in these competitions and for me I would never tell a high number well you're 610 so it's not fair that you jump higher than me now you have to do compete in the shotput or discus when everyone can excel in their own gifts their own unique you know bodies and gifts in different areas their different sports and competitions for you to excel in instead of knocking people down on various pegs um do you think that that is a possibility now I will say with this being such a public change I think that they're gonna have that in their mind the judges panel and that they're gonna be told to keep that in mind maybe not told who to pick but I could not imagine them picking this year a buddy said 510 in typical beauty queen okay so there's a few controversies that popped up that give me a little pause when I hear these kind of changes going on from one there's been the new inclusive cheerleading policy and some high schools on the East Coast where parents were mad that their children didn't make the cut and so now they're not allowed to have cheerleading tryouts and there's also a report in our USA Today a reporter made a post trying to giving his argument for why they should abolish cheerleaders in the NFL saying that it was somehow let me see his quote exactly it was degrading for these women now here's why I have some trepidation towards this because I feel like the people they're the most vocal pushing for these changes for women are the same people that support things like the slut walk saying that we should be able to do whatever we want with their bodies and also sex workers rights all these kind of things but it seems like as soon as it comes up where there's a competition or a thing where these certain people may not be as pretty or as physically gifted or as charismatic and they can't compete all of a sudden that's a travesty that's demeaning and that's awful it's almost like women can do what they want to do unless you look better than me and I can't compete in whatever you're doing is that a fair assessment I think that if someone feels that they can't stand with the other people whether it be athletically or on a padded stage or whatever they can't compete then yes they're gonna have those those comments come out to try to change it such as the cheerleader is that that no longer have tryouts the NFL thing I think it's crazy because those girls choose to do that as a living I'm whether they need a job where they're gifted or they just cheered all our life and that leads to that they choose to do that so I don't think that people behind it have a right to say that it's degrading exactly and I want to move on too because I don't want to see how this is going to this this pageant and this event has helped so many women in their careers in their futures and all this kind of stuff I'm really curious to see how you think this is gonna play out this is another quote from gretchen carlson she says that now in place of the swimsuit competitions and any also night our evening gown is not happening apparently because that's somehow bad but she said we will highlight her achievements and goals in life and how she will use her talents and passions and ambitions to perform the job of Miss America so basically be asking like what she'll do if she wins and how do you think this is gonna play out because for me like the heroes are the people that will the heroes that I look up to or people that would step forward from the crowd and do these awesome individual things but I feel like in this competition it's gonna be whoever can say the most progressive and and and and politically correct thing that they're going to do possible and all it's going to do is try to speak to the masses as clean and as clear as possible you think that's how it's going to pan out or is looking people that are actually going to break the mold and somehow do well that's with this question now like you said things and I'm not saying that swimsuit is the answer to this if that's the change they want to make but you can't have this interview especially they don't have evening gown I mean if they don't have evening gown there's no show and I was always told when we say that it's a TV show first and then apartment second yeah I'll get you out of this Maria so for you what what would you change to improve these pageants going on now and if a young girl wants to start into the pageant sphere and all these competitions what would you donate her if they felt the need that there was too many of the same body types or too much pressure to be a certain way a certain body I would do fitness I would do that if I felt the need to make a change I don't think some food is bad as long as the judging panel is aware that there should be different body types and so if the little girl was interested in competing for the first time or whatever actually deal with us all the time and I highly encourage it because the things that I've learned life skills that I've learned from pageants I can't even put words to describe them so I would still very much encourage it and I would still encourage them to be in the Miss America Organization because the scholarships at those girls win it's crazy even if you just place at the state level that's awesome well thanks so much hopefully they'll put you on the board you can fix everything for us Maria alright thanks so much for coming did you enjoy that video of course you enjoyed that video so now you need to become a
