ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI IS NOW
DONALD TRUMP'S NEW
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, AND IN
THIS VIDEO WE WILL BREAK DOWN
SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF HOW HE HAS
COMMUNICATED OVER THE PAST FEW
YEARS, STARTING WITH THIS.
THE PRESIDENT IS THE MOST
COMPETITIVE PERSON I'VE EVER
MET.
I'VE SEEN THIS GUY THROW --
I'M MOVING AROUND PAPER RIGHT
NOW, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER
HACK POLITICIAN.
ARE YOU CALLING DONALD TRUMP A
HACK?
HE WILL PROBABLY MAKE
ELIZABETH WARREN IS VICE
PRESIDENT OF NOMINEE WITH
COMMENTS LIKE THAT.
IT'S
ANTI-AMERICAN, IT'S DIVISIVE.
I
TELL YOU WHO WILL BE PRESIDENT
OF, YOU CAN TELL HIM I SAID IT,
THE QUEENS COUNTY BULLIES
ASSOCIATION.
CUT IT OUT AND STOP THIS CRAZY
RHETORIC.
I LIKE YOU SAY THAT NOW, BUT
I'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HOW
HE TALKED ABOUT WOMEN FOR YEARS.
I DON'T LIKE HOW HE TALKS
ABOUT WOMEN, ABOUT OUR FRIEND
MEGYN KELLY, THE POLITICIANS
DON'T WANT TO GO AT TRUMP
BECAUSE HE HAS A BIG MOUTH, THEY
ARE AFRAID HE WILL WRITE THEM UP
ON FOX NEWS, BUT I'M NOT A
POLITICIAN.
BRING IT.
WHY IS HE RESONATING?
YOU ARE AN INHERITED MONEY
DUDE FROM QUEENS COUNTY.
BRING
IT, DONALD.
BLAMING THE HEDGE
FUND COMMUNITY IS RIGHT OUT OF
ELIZABETH WARREN'S PLAYBOOK.
STAND HERE AND PROVE YOU AREN'T
A PLANT FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF THE
OBAMA, WARREN, CLINTON PLAYBOOK.
LET'S SHOW THE EVIDENCE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, HE'S A
CLASS DIVIDER.
GIVE HIM CREDIT, DONALD TRUMP
HAS REDUCED JEB BUSH, SCOTT
WALKER, AND MARCO RUBIO ALMOST
TO THE RELEVANCE.
FOR NOW.
THEIR INTERNAL POLLS ARE
SHOWING -- BEFORE THE INTERNAL
POLLS SHOWED THAT --
I'M
HEARING RAP IN MY EAR BUT I
DON'T WANT A RAP, THIS NONSENSE
WILL END AND I PREDICT IT WILL
END BEFORE THINGS GIVING.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI ON THE
RECORD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.
HAVE THERE EVER BEEN TO PEOPLE
ON A PANEL WHO WANTED TO TALK TO
EACH OTHER LESS?
HE WAS NOT
HAVING THAT GUY WHO KEPT
INTERRUPTING HIM OVER AND OVER.
THAT WAS THAT GUY GOING I SAID
THAT TOO.
EVERY DAY THAT WAS ME AND CENK
IN 2004 AND 2005, TRUST ME.
THAT WAS PRETTY BRUTAL.
THAT WAS.
I WILL HAVE SOME TWEETS IN A
SECOND.
SCARAMUCCI -- I'M SURE A VERY
SMART GUY, FIRST OF ALL TO GET
FIRED AT -- NOT AT LEHMAN
BROTHERS BUT AT -- WHERE IS
EVERYONE AT?
NOW OR THEN?
GOLDMAN SACHS?
HE GOT FIRED AND REHIRED AT
GOLDMAN SACHS.
HE'S CLEARLY IMPRESSIVE.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS FIRED.
THAT HE BROKE OFF, HE STARTED
A FUND THAT ADVISED OTHER FUNDS
-- HE'S THINKING, SO HE'S A
SMARTER GUY I SUSPECT THAN MOST
PEOPLE IN THAT ADMINISTRATION.
BUT THIS GUY JUST COMPARED THE
OBAMA, WARREN, HILLARY CLINTON
PLAYBOOK ON WALL STREET -- THOSE
THREE PEOPLE COULDN'T BE FURTHER
APART ON WALL STREET.
OBAMA
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
WARREN AND HILLARY CLINTON, BUT
THOSE THREE PEOPLE DON'T OPERATE
ON THE SAME PLAYBOOK.
IN 2010 AT
THE TOWN HALL, BECAUSE HE WENT
TO LAW SCHOOL WITH OBAMA AT
HARVARD, HE ASKED OBAMA IN A
TOWN HALL, FIRST QUESTION, WHEN
ARE WE GOING TO STOP WHACKING AT
THE WALL STREET PI—ATA?
HE ASKED
OBAMA.
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT.
IN THEIR MINDS, THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM WITH BARACK OBAMA,
TOO TOUGH ON WALL STREET.
WHICH IS CRAZY.
I FELT THAT.
EXACTLY.
OH NO, NOBODY WENT TO
PRISON.
THAT WAS THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT, BUT IF OBAMA HAD
SAID LET'S GO -- THERE ARE A LOT
OF COMPLICATED REASONS ABOUT WHY
PROSECUTORS GOT SO TIMID WITH
PROSECUTING PEOPLE ON WALL
STREET, INTERESTING BOOK OUT NOW
ON THAT, OR COMING OUT SOON,
DAVID SIROTA HAD THE GUY ON --
BUT NONETHELESS THEY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.
IN THE NOTION THAT
DODD-FRANK WAS WHACKING AT THE
WALL STREET PI—ATA -- SO AGAIN,
IF YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP
IS GOING TO COME IN AND GET
TOUGH AND DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS
AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF WALL
STREET, YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR
EFFIN' MIND.
WE ALREADY KNEW
THAT.
I LOVE THAT IN THAT METAPHOR
WALL STREET IS A PI—ATA, WHICH
IS LIKE A SHALLOW OBJECT THAT'S
BEEN STUFFED FULL OF STUFF IT
NEVER EARNED -- AND THAT'S HIS
ANALOGY.
THAT VIDEO WAS GOOD BUT
THERE'S OTHER STUFF AS WELL THAT
WILL SOON BE PAPERED OVER, IN
FACT MANY OF THESE TWEETS HAVE
SINCE BEEN DELETED, BUT HE
TWEETED --
I BET HE DOESN'T DELETE ANY
OF THEM.
HE ALREADY HAS DELETED THEM.
I BET HE DELETES THOSE.
I REALLY LIKE THIS NEXT ONE --
WALLS DON'T WORK, NEVER HAVE,
NEVER WILL.
THE BERLIN WALL,
DON'T FALL FOR ONE IT.
THAT WALL WORKED FOR 28 YEARS.
ANOTHER ONE --
HE 
RAISED MONEY FOR OBAMA IN
2008.
ANOTHER ONE --
EXCEPT WHEN MY BOSS DOES IT, I
DON'T MIND THAT SO MUCH.
I DON'T
KNOW IF THAT ONE IS DELETED.
HE
ALSO HAD AN INTERESTING
EVOLUTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, AS
PEOPLE DO AS THEY GET OLDER.
AT
ONE POINT HE SAID CLIMATE
SCIENCE WAS INDISPUTABLE, HE
LATER WENT ON TO SAY I'M NOT A
SCIENTIST, AND HE EVOLVED
BETWEEN JUNE AND DECEMBER OF
LAST YEAR.
HERE IS THE THING, WE
UNDERSTAND THAT IN BLOOD I GUESS
MAYBE IT'S TO TRUMP'S CREDIT
THAT HE BRINGS IN PEOPLE WHO
ONCE CRITICIZED HIM, BUT IT'S
THE FAKENESS, AND THE PAID
PERJUROR.
ON HIS FIRST DAY,
SCARAMUCCI SAID THIS --
HE CHANGED HIS POSITION ON
CLIMATE CHANGE, HE WILL CHANGE
HIS POSITION ON GUNS, HE ONCE
SPOKE CRITICALLY OF THE WAY
TRUMP SPOKE ABOUT ISLAM AND
TRIED TO PORTRAY IT AS A
RELIGION OF VIOLENCE, BUT ALL OF
THAT, ALL OF WHAT MAKES A PERSON
THE PERSON THEY ARE, THE VALUES
THEY HAVE, GO OUT THE DOOR ONCE
YOU ARE STANDING AT THAT PODIUM.
THAT'S ONE THING THE PEOPLE HATE
ABOUT POLITICS THAT TRUMP
WAS SUPPOSED TO CHANGE, BUT IT'S
JUST ANOTHER ITERATION OF IT.
HE WANTED THIS POSITION OF
POWER, OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T NEED
THE MONEY, HE'S RICH BEYOND
ANYONE'S WILDEST DREAMS.
OF COURSE YOU COULD HAVE SAID
THAT ABOUT TRUMP.
HE WANTS IT BECAUSE HE WANTS
POWER.
SCARAMUCCI, GIVEN THOSE
THINGS, IF HE HAD SAID THE
DEMOCRATS ARE A DEAD PARTY AND
THEY ARE TOO TOUGH ON WALL
STREET, SCARAMUCCI COULD HAVE
SAID I'M THROWING MY SUPPORT
BEHIND JOHN KASICH AND I HOPE HE
RUNS.
THAT WOULD BE FAIRLY
PRINCIPLED.
HE CHECKED HIS PRINCIPLES AT
THE DOOR.
IT'S THE WORST OF US,
IT'S POLITICS FOR POLITICS SAKE,
AND MAYBE THEY GET THEIR HEAD TO
SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY SAY IT'S
ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT, SOME
SORT OF MODEST LEGISLATIVE
ACHIEVEMENT, I DON'T HOW THEY
GET THEIR HEADS AROUND.
ITS
DESPICABLE.
IN THE NATION, THEY SAID SEAN
SPICER AIDED AND ABETTED THE
WORST OF DONALD TRUMP.
IF YOU
ARE IN CHARGE OF THE MESSAGING
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO
HAVE TO DO.
LET'S PLAY ONE MORE CLIP.
IF
YOU BELIEVE THAT ANTHONY
SCARAMUCCI MIGHT TELL THE TRUTH
IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN IN
THE PAST, LISTEN TO THIS CLIP
FROM TODAY WHEN ASKED IF DONALD
TRUMP IS FEELING UNDER SIEGE.
HE'S THE MOST COMPETITIVE
PERSON I'VE EVER MET.
I'VE SEEN
THIS GUY THROW A DEAD SPIRAL
THROUGH A TIRE.
I SEEN HIM AT
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, WITH A
TOPCOAT ON, HITTING FOUL SHOTS.
HE SINKS THREE-FOOT PUTTS.
I
DON'T SEE HIM UNDER SIEGE, THIS
IS A COMPETITIVE PERSON,
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF
INCOMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT
THE PRESIDENT IS A WINNER
AND WE WILL DO A LOT OF WINNING.
THAT HE HAD THAT HALF-COURT
SHOT IN A TOPCOAT FOR A $50,000
CHECK?
THAT'S HOW HE GOT HIS MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IN
A PRESIDENT, GUY WHO CAN THROW A
SPIRAL THROUGH A TIRE.
BY THE
WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ON TWITTER
WERE LIKE, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
HE'S TRYING TO PORTRAY THIS
GUY WHO IS LAZY AS THIS SPORTS
HERO.
BUT EVEN I, I'M NOT HUGE
ON SPORTS -- HE SAID HE THREW A
SPIRAL THROUGH A TIRE, HE DIDN'T
SAY FROM HOW FAR AWAY.
HE HIT
FREE THROWS.
OKAY.
AND A
THREE-FOOT PUTT?
HOW MUCH
SHORTER COULD A PUTT BE?
MAYBE
HE WAS INSULTING HIM.
KIM-JONG
IL SHOT A 38 UNDER PAR.
GREAT LEADERS DO GREAT SPORTS.
STEPH CURRY/TOM BRADY FOR
PRESIDENT APPARENTLY.
CALVIN MURPHY.
A GUY WHO CAN WORK TO THE
HOOP.
PRESIDENT RICK BARRY.
THE TIRE
IS HERE -- WE COULD ALL THROW A
SPIRAL THROUGH IT.
I ONCE SAW HIM HIT A BALL RIGHT
OFF OF A TEE, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S THE SAME MACHO BULLSHIT
TRUMP HAS, THAT'S HOW THEY BOND.
THEY ALSO BOND OVER BIG MONEY,
AND CLEARLY THEY BOND OVER
NOT CARING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT
MATTERS TO THIS COUNTRY.
SCARAMUCCI CRITICIZED MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS BECAUSE THEY WERE
GUYS WHO DIDN'T HAVE ANY REAL
MONEY.
AGAIN, WE HAVE AN ELITE,
OUT OF TOUCH GOVERNMENT UNDER
THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT
WE FOUND A WAY TO MAKE IT
CONSIDERABLY WORSE.
BOTTOM LINE
ON SCARAMUCCI IS, GUYS WITH
GOOD HAIR WHO GRADUATED FROM
TUFTS UNIVERSITY SHOULDN'T BE
TRUSTED.
THAT IS A NEW RULE HERE FROM
TYT.
