1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,880
When it comes to higher education, America
is second to none. World class professors,

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,660
exclusive liberal arts schools with manicured
lawns, and the highest prices on the planet!

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,159
That is why there’s more than 1.3 trillion
dollars of student debt in the U.S.

4
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:25,019
Experts think it’s more student debt than
every other country in the world...combined.

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,880
And Americans can’t afford it.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,179
There’s a long list of people who think
the U.S. student loan situation is broken.

7
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,800
How to reform it is where the roads diverge.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,220
So here’s the situation…

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,350
Students who borrowed for college and finished
in 2014, took out an average of nearly $29,000

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,410
to pay for their education. In just the past decade, student debt has more than tripled, rising an average

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,449
of 14% a year.

12
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:53,390
And that debt burden is rippling over into
other areas of American life with fewer young

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,749
adults buying homes, new cars, getting married
or starting a business.

14
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,379
Now here’s the argument…

15
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,800
So what’s the real problem here? The cost
of college or the loans used to pay for college?

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,190
One school of thought first championed by Senator
Elizabeth Warren, and now backed by Hillary

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,460
Clinton says part of the solution is letting
students refinance their loans at lower interest rates.

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,060
Clinton: "A 7-to-9 percent interest rate,
when we haven't had interest rates that high

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,570
in years, it makes absolutely no sense."

20
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,250
President Obama has greatly expanded his own program.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,740
Obama: "To offer millions of students the
opportunity to cap their monthly student loan

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,630
payments to 10% of their income."

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,920
But critics say making it cheaper to borrow
just makes it easier for schools to raise

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,280
tuition and fees.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,750
Another suggestion?

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,090
Countries like France and Germany with less
student loan debt do it way differently than

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,690
America: They have higher taxes to make public
universities cheap or even free.

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,000
It’s a solution that isn’t even on the
horizon in the U.S.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,890
It also wouldn't help the millions of students
currently indebted to the government for

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:00:00,000
years to come.
