HEATHER: THE HIGH-STAKES PRIMARY
SEASON CONTINUES WITH SOME VERY
HIGH-PROFILE RACES AGAINST FOUR
STATES, DONALD TRUMP CARRIED
GEORGIA, ARKANSAS, TO KENTUCKY
IN TEXAS DURING THE 2016
ELECTION.
WILL REPUBLICANS SEE THE SAME
EFFECT AS THEY FIGHT TO MAINTAIN
CONTROL OF CONGRESS?
JOINING ME IS JIM MACLACHLAN,
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY
TALKING ABOUT ELECTION AGAIN.
WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A
WHILE NOW.
>> IT IS LIKE THE ELECTIONS
NEVER STOPPED.
HEATHER: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE.
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE
CANDIDATES IN THIS RACE?
>> IN A LOT OF WAYS, ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE, THEY INCREASED
EDUCATION SPENDING, CUT TAXES,
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL BUT
THINK ABOUT IT, THAT IS A STATE
WHERE THE DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING
THEY COULD BE DONALD TRUMP, THAT
DIDN'T HAPPEN.
HE HAD A DECISIVE VICTORY IN
THAT STATEMENT DEMOCRATS ARE
EXCITED ABOUT THEIR CANDIDATE
STACY ABRAMS, A FORMER MINORITY
LEADER IN THE HOUSE, SHE IS
GETTING A LOT OF THAT NATIONAL
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT.
WHICH IS HELPING HER IN THE
PRIMARY BUT QUICKER IN THE
GENERAL ELECTION.
>> WE HAVE SEEN THIS NATIONAL
SUPPORT COMING INTO A STATE OR
LOCAL RACE DOES MORE HARM THAN
GOOD.
>> ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE YOU
HAVE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT
WITH DEMOCRATS EVEN TOO LIBERAL
FOR NANCY PELOSI, THE
ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATIC
SUPPORT, THEN THE EXTREME LEFT
WITH BERNIE SANDERS, ELIZABETH
LAUREN, ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS,
NOT NECESSARILY LIBERAL ENOUGH
SO AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC.
>> THEY DON'T HAVE A
CONSOLIDATED MESSAGE.
>> TED CRUZ AND BETA OVER ORCA.
>> THEY GOT EXCITED ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THE
QUINNIPIAC POLL THAT HAD A 3
POINT RACE BUT I DON'T THINK IT
IS A 3 POINT RACE.
I THINK TED CRUZ IS OVER 50.
THEY SAID THEY CAN BE DONALD
TRUMP IN TEXAS.
OBVIOUSLY THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
SHANNON: HE WON BY 52%.
>> BETA O'ROURKE, THAT HELPED
HIM IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
A LOT OF THIS LEFT OF CENTER
LIBERAL NATIONAL SUPPORT IS
GOING TO HURT WITH MAINSTREAM
TEXAS VOTERS.
HEATHER: IN TERMS OF TED CRUZ,
DOES HE RUN AS PRO DONALD TRUMP?
>> THE INTERESTING THING, 40% OF
THE ADS BEING RUN IN THE
PRIMARIES MENTIONED DONALD
TRUMP, MOSTLY BY REPUBLICANS IN
A POSITIVE SENSE TO GET THOSE
TRUMP VOTERS BECAUSE THAT IS THE
CHALLENGE, TO GET THOSE VOTERS
THAT TURNED OUT IN HUGE NUMBERS
FOR DONALD TRUMP AND HIS VICTORY
IN 2016, TO MAKE SURE THEY TURN
OUT IN OFF YEAR ELECTIONS, TED
CRUZ HAS HIS OWN BRAND BUT IS
ALSO GOING TO RELY ON THE PRES.
TO HELP ESPECIALLY WITH TURNOUT.
>> ARKANSAS WE HAVE HUTCHINSON
AGAINST JARED HENDERSON AND AT
THE SAME TIME LET'S BRING UP
DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET ABOUT THE
ARKANSAS GOVERNOR RACE, THE
GREAT GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS IS IN
THE PRIMARY TOMORROW, HAS DONE
AN INTERNAL JOB FOCUSING ON
LOWER TAXES AND GOES ON TALKING
ABOUT MILITARY VETERANS.
>> NOTHING BETTER IN THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THAN GETTING
A TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP BEFORE
IT HAPPENS.
YOU HAVE SEEN IN GENERAL
ELECTIONS IN THE GENERAL
ELECTION SURVEY, IT IS UP BY 40
POINTS OVER HIS DEMOCRATIC
OPPONENT SO THAT IS ONE WHERE
HUTCHINSON HAS DONE A GREAT JOB
TYING TO THE PRESIDENT IT HAS A
GOOD RECORD AS GOVERNOR, HE WILL
BE SUCCESSFUL.
>> DONALD TRUMP WON BY 60%.
MOVING TO KENTUCKY WERE DONALD
TRUMP WON BY 62%.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING IN
KENTUCKY, CENTRAL KENTUCKY AND
YOU HAVE THAT RACE, IF YOU LOOK
AT ANDY BARR, SHE SHOULD BE GOOD
IN THE GENERAL ELECTION THE
DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED ABOUT
THEIR TWO CANDIDATES, JIM GRAY,
MAYOR OF LEXINGTON AND AMY
MCGRATH, THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING
