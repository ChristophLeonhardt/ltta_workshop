in 1972 a handful of political operatives burgled the democrat offices in the Watergate Building in Washington DC that bungled burglary was uncovered and for the next two years the attempt to hide that story and it's connection to the president eventually led to the resignation of Richard Nixon today in Washington again we have a new scandal to do with surveillance and illegal operations this time FISA Gate what I prefer to call Obama gate promises to be even larger than Watergate why because it goes against all the founding principles of this great nation and especially the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution against unreasonable search and seizure what do we know already from declassified documents from the Senate and the House of Representatives that the FBI knowingly used a political opposition research file paid for by the Democrat Party and Hillary Clinton to illegally obtain a surveillance warrant against at least one member of the Trump campaign that is abuse of power perjury and potentially much worse not only that we now know that one of the people feeding the false information into that so-called dossier was none other than Sidney Blumenthal one of the closest associates of Hillary Clinton but now thanks to very very serious and extensive research done by Lee Smith and his latest article for the tablet we find that there's actually a name at the highest levels of the United States government that is now embroiled in this scandal and that's none other than John Brennan the president's President Obama's former director of CIA in a very very well documented timeline it seems that John Brennan has got confused as to how the accusations and the investigation of so-called Russian collusion by the Trump campaign actually began and what Lee Smith has done is demonstrate that it looks as if the director of the CIA was the person who initiated or told the FBI to investigate these fallacious claims of Russian collusion this is all the more ironic when you find that John Brennan has admitted to proudly voting for Gus hall the Communist Party candidate for president when he was a younger man so we have an individual who was a communist who then became a director of the CIA under Obama and to just add to the irony or the paradox of this whole situation the left wants to obstruct the left wants to say that these issues are not serious the FBI should not be challenged this after more than 40 years of the left and the Democrats being the first to say let it all out unclassified everything from the original Watergate through to the Pentagon Papers through even to Bradley Manning who released tens of thousands of documents to Wikileaks our crimes only crimes when Republicans commit them and is it okay to fabricate accusations and get illegal search warrants and surveillance warrants no not in the United States of America stay tuned as we find out more about who is behind FISA gate and Obama gate and just how high the scandal really goes thanks for watching if you want to see the rest of my videos please subscribe to the rebel media YouTube channel and don't forget to follow me on twitter at said Gorka that's Seb Geor ka and if you like this video please share it on Facebook and Twitter because the fake news industrial complex has been lying for far too long and with your help we can get the truth out you
