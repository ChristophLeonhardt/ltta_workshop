00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:22,733
THE WORLD IS SAYING ABOUT THE

GETTING THE ATTENTION OF THE

00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,717
WORLD.

16
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:42,619
>> THE LEADERS NEED TO BE

17
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,887
CREDITED FOR THEIR COURAGE WITH

18
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:44,588
WHICH THEY DECIDED TO MOVE

19
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:48,692
FORWARD WITH THE SUMMIT.

20
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:50,327
>> PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN HAS

21
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:50,994
PLAYED A CRITICAL

22
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,396
A CRITICAL ROLE THROUGH HIS OWN

23
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:53,797
SUMMITS LEADING UP TO THESE

24
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:54,097
TALKS.

00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:04,474
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

31
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,976
HE LATER WARNED THAT THE SUMMIT

32
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:07,611
COULD BE JUST THE START OF A

33
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,311
DIPLOMATIC PROCESS THAT COULD

34
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:11,381
TAKE YEARS.

35
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,183
THERE WERE OTHER WORRIES FOR THE

36
00:01:13,183 --> 00:01:13,784
PENINSULA.

37
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:14,985
WHAT, IF ANY, PREFERENCE WILL BE

38
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:16,553
MADE TO AN END TO THE KOREAN

39
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:19,389
WAR, HALTED DECADES AGO WITH

40
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:19,890
JUST AN ARMISTICE?

41
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,691
WHAT SECURITY GUARANTEE IS

42
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,994
OFFERED TO THE NORTH BY THE U.S.

43
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,996
MIGHT MEAN TO SOME 28,000 U.S.

44
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:26,396
TROOPS HERE.

45
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:27,397
HOW FAR IS THE NORTH WILLING TO

46
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:29,633
GO TO GET RID OF THE NUCLEAR

47
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:30,600
THREAT TO THE REGION?

48
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,469
AND WHAT WILL BE SAID ABOUT THE

49
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:33,937
HORRENDOUS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD

00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:36,139
FOR THE PYONGYANG REGIME.

00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,208
ONE TIME NORTH KOREAN DETAINEE

52
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,611
KENNETH BAY AS HOPED ABOUT THAT.

53
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,646
>> I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

54
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:47,484
TO SEE THE HUMANITARIAN AND

55
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,019
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES ADDRESSED AT

56
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,720
THE SUMMIT.

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,988
>> THERE IS NO ATTENTION BEING

58
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:52,722
GIVEN BY NORTH KOREAN STATE

59
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:53,990
MEDIA TO THE SUMMIT ACTIVITIES

60
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,192
OF ITS LEADER, ACROSS THE BORDER

61
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:58,128
IN SOUTH KOREA THERE IS GRUDGING

62
00:01:58,128 --> 00:01:58,829
RESPECT FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL

63
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,898
U.S. PRESIDENT WHO HELPED BRING

64
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:07,237
ABOUT THIS ONE ON ONE SUMMIT.

65
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,771
IN A SENSE.

66
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,806
>> A REVOLUTIONARY?

67
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:11,508
>> HE'S DONE SOMETHING THAT

68
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,577
NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN WILLING TO

69
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:14,478
DO.

70
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:16,513
>> SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON

71
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:17,414
ALSO NOTED THAT IT IS

72
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,983
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BIRTHDAY ON

00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,184
THURSDAY, AND WHAT A GREAT

74
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,118
PRESENT IT WOULD BE IF THE

75
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,954
SUMMIT WENT WELL.

76
00:02:23,954 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER TO YOU.
