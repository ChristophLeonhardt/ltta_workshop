1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,870
Aretha Franklin is the Queen of Soul - she
not only embodied the spirit of Soul in her

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,340
music but she lived it.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,260
Because, very simply, she doesn't sing soul — she is soul.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,930
Soul is rooted in gospel, a genre of music
that combines rhythm and blues with church

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,560
hymns.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,750
Aretha was exposed to those sounds her entire
childhood.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,280
She was raised in the church where her father,
CL Franklin, was the most well known preacher

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,019
in the US during the golden age of gospel
in the 1940s and 50s.

9
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:44,550
You could hear any one of Aretha’s hits
and witness a master class in the power of

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,210
gospel music, but it’s her covers and her
live performances that really reveal all the

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,460
gospel techniques she had at her disposal.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,200
Aretha could turn any song into a gospel song.

13
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:01,519
Just take a look at these two tracks.

14
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,080
The top is British soul singer, Dusty Springfield’s,
most iconic song “Son of a Preacher Man”

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,180
Dusty and Aretha shared the same producer,
Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records.

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,770
The song first went to Aretha, who ended up
passing on it.

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,640
Dusty took it, and in early 1969 her version
rose to the top of the charts.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,310
A year later, Aretha released a cover of it
and it sounded completely different.

19
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,620
Where Dusty started with a smooth electric
guitar riff,

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,340
Aretha started on the piano.

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,360
An instrument
that, along with the hammond organ, played

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,680
a central role 
in the sound of gospel music and her career.

23
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,500
The fingers and the voice are all part of that same tradition.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,360
And she was trained by the best.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,520
Aretha comes up during the golden era of gospel music and actually

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,220
her piano teacher is the late Reverand James Cleveland,

27
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,740
who became king of gospel.

28
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,220
Here he is, backing her on the piano.

29
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,569
Aretha sat behind a piano her whole career
-- at any point she could speed up or slow

30
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,379
down, creating a spectrum of emotional moments.

31
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,820
Like this moment here:

32
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
There's an old saying in the black church:

33
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,020
This valley is there to build to that final
climactic moment of the song.

34
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,680
In gospel music it’s often called the “special
chorus” or vamp.

35
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,880
The vamp is almost like
you take the essence of the song.

36
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,489
the most memorable rhythmic piece is repeated
over and over.

37
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,579
Clara Ward and the Ward Singers, Aretha Franklin’s
biggest mentors, perfected this in their gospel

38
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,400
recording of “Packing Up”

39
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,420
This key component of gospel was everywhere
in the music of the 1960s.

40
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
Listen to the Rolling Stones

41
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,580
imitate those high notes of
Marion Williams in “Sympathy for the Devil.”

42
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,640
Aretha carried that gospel tradition of repetition
and vocal improvisation over into her music

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
too.

44
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,160
In this recording she improvises over her backup vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations.

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,140
I think in the case of the preacher man they were even
saying literally Hallelujah.

46
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,460
You know, right on the top of the groove.

47
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,980
The same singers were on Dusty's version too.

48
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,600
But their voicing on Aretha's recording is completely different.

49
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,400
One of the most exciting differences is when they echo

50
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,740
“Sock it to me” a phrase they also sing
in “Respect”.

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,560
They added "sock it to me" into that, it became like a thing.

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,200
[Repeating "Sock it to me"]

53
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me.

54
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,300
Sock it to yourself.

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
Sock it to me?

56
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,780
Sock it to me.

57
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,540
Lay it on me.

58
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,460
Give me a high five.

59
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,420
Know what I'm sayin'?

60
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,980
Was that innocent, or..

61
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,140
coincidental?

62
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,600
Now what did you think it meant?

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
Well, you'd come home and give me my propers.

64
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,600
Son of a Preacher Man lives on vinyl as a
studio recording, but Aretha’s gospel roots

65
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
really shine when she’s playing live.

66
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,540
Take her performance of “Dr. Feelgood,"
live at Fillmore West in San Francisco.

67
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,780
In a 1971 review, Ebony magazine
said “The album captures the spirit of her

68
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,880
in-person performances that are never merely
shows but more rituals of an almost religious nature."

69
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,220
This music has to be inspired of the moment.

70
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,520
There’s always a single moment in every
single one of her live performances where

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,270
the crowd erupts.

72
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,760
In Dr. Feelgood it happens about 2 minutes
in - almost the ending of the song.

73
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:54,820
[ Aretha Frankling performing live at the Fillmore West in San Francisco]

74
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,660
[Cheers and shouting erupting from the audience.]

75
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:19,140
[Aretha Franklin continues singing."

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,100
She can literally control the crowd when she's
at that moment in the song.

77
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,700
This is a blues song, but at this moment she’s
priming people for a spiritual awakening.

78
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,400
At the very end, where she just starts to kind of talk to the crowd,

79
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
and she said you want to sit
down

80
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,380
and cross your arms and crossed her legs and look up to heaven.

81
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,960
So she's now talking about ecstasy but she's
singing about it in a way that's very spiritual

82
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,920
and sacred. You know, she’s using gospel to
get us there.

83
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:21,140
[Aretha Franklin interacting with the crowd at the Fillmore West.]

84
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,800
She inhabits these songs to a degree that we're not

85
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,520
used to seeing much anymore, that naked vulnerability.

86
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,260
It's coming from a church tradition. You may only have

87
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,040
an audience of 10, but you may have been put
there to reach one person.

88
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,740
It was very rare that a gospel singer could
go back and forth between gospel and pop so

89
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,530
freely, but Aretha’s voice and authenticity
transcended genres.

90
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,840
So this is 1971 and if anyone in gospel as a performer
would have done that, it would have been controversial.

91
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,480
Somehow Aretha was able to bounce back and forth

92
00:09:03,860 --> 00:00:00,000
and stay, to the end, true to both worlds.
