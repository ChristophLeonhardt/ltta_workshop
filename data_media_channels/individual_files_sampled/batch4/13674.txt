well-played slimy Democrats you stooped to the lowest possible stratagem coming out waiting till the key Brett Kavanaugh hearings were over then releasing this anonymous attack about a supposed sexual event that happened 35 years ago in high school there's no way there is no possible way that this should matter if the guy whose life has been as clean as it seems to have been for the last 35 years there's no way it can be proved and so there's no way to address it you know personally and and yet because of this me to garbage that's going around some of its garbage something that's not but because in this case it is being used in a garbage like way well played slimy Democrats they had to put off the vote on Thursday and they are now gonna have a hearing where the lady will be able to come forward and state her case and Cavanaugh who not only says the thing never happened he says he wasn't even at the party where it was supposed to have happened he will also testify of course the Democrats do not want this to happen they are just trying to delay the whole thing Dianne Feinstein has already said oh we're rushing to judgment and not rushing to judgment they're just going to have the the testimony you can bet they will do everything to obfuscate and delay they will do everything they can to hold this off that's all it about but they got you got it from Thursday to Monday well played slimy Democrats and just so we remember that this is who the Democrats are it is not after all I can tell who the Republicans are they have their own problems their own things I yell at them about they can be spineless they can be inert but they do not do this stuff just to remember who basically made this a steady standard operating procedure in Congress let us go back to Harry Reid during the MIT Romney Barack Obama election he went out on the floor of the Senate and maligned both the Koch brothers and MIT Romney said MIT Romney didn't pay his taxes because on the floor of the Senate you can't be sued you can't be sued for slandering somebody on the floor of the Senate and here was Harry Reid when he was questioned on CNN about these tactics he used the Senate floor to go after GOP mega donors the Koch brothers and a Mitt Romney of not paying his taxes with no evidence let him prove that he has paid taxes because he hasn't I don't regret that at all the Koch brothers no one would help they were afraid the Koch brothers would go after them so I did it on wheels so no regrets about Mitt Romney about the Koch brothers some people even call it called it McCarthyite well they call it whatever they want Oh me then when did he Romney didn't win did he so it doesn't matter that I lied about him doesn't matter they stood on the Senate floor the floor of the United States Senate and said he did not pay taxes Romney didn't win that is all this is about so this is the thing that the you know this is why I say well played slimy Democrats because now we're all discussing well does it matter who do we believe me to sexual have a high school this and that whatever all that stuff it's not about any of that is about they do not want a conservative vote on the Supreme Court because they believe the Supreme Court should be a super legislature let legislature that will churn out left-wing law five people churning out left-wing law because they cannot get approval from the populous so they don't need it in the Supreme Court
