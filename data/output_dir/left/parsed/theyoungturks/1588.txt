A SELF-DESCRIBED YOUTUBE
INFLUENCER BY THE NAME OF
CHLOE FELDMAN POSTED A LITTLE
PIECE OF AUDIO THAT PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN DEBATING ABOUT AND
THE REASON WHY THEY ARE
DEBATING IS BECAUSE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE HERE SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER
PEOPLE.
IT IS THE WHOLE LAUREL OR JOHNNY
DEBATE AND WE ARE GOING TO
LET YOU LISTEN TO IT NOW AND
THEN YOU DECIDE FOR
YOURSELVES WHAT YOU HEAR AND
THEN WE WILL DISCUSS THE
POTENTIAL REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE
HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS.
TAKE A LOOK.
LAUREL.
SO I PERSONALLY HEARD LAUREL.
I HEARD LAUREL.
I HEARD LONNIE.
HE IS THE ONLY ONE HEARING
LONNIE.
THAT IS PROBABLY WHY I HEARD
LAUREL, KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING?
I ALSO HEARD LAUREL, BUT
THERE ARE EXPERTS WHO STUDY
THINGS LIKE THIS AND HAVE SOME
POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS WHY
PEOPLE HEAR DIFFERENT THINGS.
THAT IS ACCORDING TO A
LINGUISTICS PROFESSOR
AND APPARENTLY I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS,
FREQUENCY, YOUR ABILITY TO HEAR
FREQUENCY CHANGES AS YOU AGE SO
AS YOU GET OLDER, YOU ARE LESS
LIKELY TO HEAR HIGHER
FREQUENCIES.
THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE
STORY.
IT IS TRIPPY THAT YOU COULD BE
IN THE ROOM WITH THE SAME
PERSON AND YOU HEAR SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM
WHAT THEY ARE HEARING THAT IS
THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY.
THIS IS JUST A STARKER EXAMPLE,
BUT WE ALL ACTUALLY HEAR AND SEE
AND SENSE THINGS SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENTLY.
THIS JUST HAPPENS TO BE STARK
ENOUGH THEY HAS CAUGHT OUR
ATTENTION AND OF COURSE THE GOLD
DRESS BLUE DRESS AS WELL BUT WE
ALL SEE AND HAVE DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD AND
THERE IS A WEIRD THING ABOUT ME
IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE IT IS SO
HARD TO UNDERSTAND OTHER
PERSPECTIVES AND I TRY HARD AND
THIS IS A GOOFY EXAMPLE OF IT,
BUT THE EAGLE CAN SEE WAY
FURTHER THAN HUMAN BEINGS CAN.
OBVIOUSLY ALL ANIMALS ARE
DIFFERENT ANIMALS ARE INNOCENT.
I ALWAYS THINK WHAT DOES THE
EAGLE SEE?
I GET IT THAT YOU HAVE BETTER
EYESIGHT THAN I DO, YOU CAN
READ
FURTHER OUT BUT HOW DO YOU SEE
FURTHER?
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
THAT, I DON'T HAVE THAT
PERSPECTIVE, IT IS HARD FOR ME
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE
SEEING SO A STORY LIKE THIS IS
GREAT BECAUSE IT GETS US TO
REALIZE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVES AND THAT THOSE
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AREN'T
NECESSARILY WRONG, THEY ARE JUST
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND THAT
WE ALL HAVE ONE THAT IS SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT AND THAT IS WHY I AM
AN ADVOCATE OF AND IF ANYTHING
OVER COMMUNICATION, WHICH
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I'M A
TALKSHOW HOST.
THIS HAPPENS IN MARRIAGES AND
IN BUSINESSES, EVERYWHERE
WHERE EVERYBODY THINKS, MY
PERSPECTIVE NOT ONLY IS THE
RIGHT ONE BUT THEY THINK, ALMOST
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THE
PERSPECTIVE THEY HAVE IS THE ONE
SHARED BY EVERYONE.
SO WHY ARE YOU REACTING THAT WAY
WHEN I DON'T REACT THAT WAY?
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE EVEN
PERCEIVED IN ANY WAY THE
WAY THAT YOU DID.
IF TWO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT
THE EXACT SAME THING OR
LISTENING TO THE EXACT SAME
AUDIO BUT THEY HEAR OR SEE TWO
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS,
THINK ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION THAT
THOSE TWO PEOPLE HAVE AS THEY
ARE COMMUNICATING ABOUT WHAT
THEY JUST SAW OR HEARD AND I
FEEL LIKE WE KEEP SEEING THAT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN IT
COMES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL
FACTS OF STORIES, FOR INSTANCE.
YOU WILL HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO SEE THE
SAME FACTS, BUT THEY INTERPRET
THOSE FACTS DIFFERENTLY.
THEY HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
WORLDVIEW.
I DO NOT KNOW, I JUST THINK THAT
IS FASCINATING AND IT MAKES
ME FEEL LIKE THERE IS NO HOPE.
LET ME GIVE A SMALL AND A BIG
EXAMPLE.
IF YOU GO AND SAY WHERE IS THE
GAP AND SOMEBODY WILL LOOK
AT YOU LIKE ARGUE STUPID, YOU GO
RIGHT AND LEFT, THEN RIGHT
AND LEFT.
OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE
BEEN TO THE MALL EVERY DAY
AND KNOW YOU KNOW WERE THE GAP
IS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN
THERE BUT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.
THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BUT ON
A GLOBAL SCALE, RIGHT NOW
ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY WE
HAVE SEPARATED INTO OUR
DIFFERENT CAMPS AND WE CANNOT
HEAR THE SAME THING AND WE
CANNOT SEE THE SAME THING AND WE
DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT
WE ARE NOT HEARING AND SEEING
THE SAME THING.
WE HAVE GOT TO GET PAST THAT
AND I BELIEVE THAT YANNY
VERSUS LAUREL WILL FIX ALL OF
THIS.
PERHAPS NOT, BUT IT IS BEGINNING
OF HOPEFULLY A LITTLE
BETTER UNDERSTANDING.
