this week Mother Jones had a really interesting report it's a profile of how the EPA had recently hired a right-wing opposition research firm to help track the media for them so here's a section describing how this process went earlier this month uh Scott Pruett obviously the head of the EPA office at inked a no-bid 120,000 dollar contract with definers Corporation a Virginia based public relations firm founded by Matt Rhodes who managed Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign so that's one guy there other higher-ups at the Finers include former RNC research director Joe pounder who's been described as a quote master of opposition research and senior vice president Colin Reed an oppo research guru billed as among the leaders of the war on senator Elizabeth Warren must be so proud he must be quite proud odd though that they would be chosen to do media research and curation for the EPA in a no-bid that there was no there's no competition or anything like that they simply chose these guys again no bid from the party that loves the free-market supposedly oh so what else is definers well definers also specializes in using the press and social media to validate your narrative that's not me saying that or Mother Jones saying that that's definers saying that to validate a narrative which is obvious what a science and evidence based organization like the EPA is looking for now since that initial report not long ago we've got more information about what definer might do once they get this contract once they're working for the EPA the New York Times reported that a vice president for definer Alden blue Stein has submitted at least 40 Freedom of Information requests in the last year many of the requests targeted EPA staffers and union representatives both question the way Pruett has run the agency so he's using a Freedom of Information Act request to try to get information about people who are rocking the boat and aren't simply going along with this new radical direction of the EPA in addition to targeting agency staff he's also filed open records requests in various states for climate scientists emails at public universities Jesus so they're trying to weed out opposition inside of the EPA and also crush any sort of information coming out of academics and scientists environmental lawyers activists all of that sort of thing but there has been a lot of thankfully because of Mother Jones and eventually New York Times reporting on this there's been a lot of public outcry about this ridiculous change and thankfully an agency spokesman confirmed earlier today that the EPA and the company had agreed to terminate the contract that's good news but one last thing look at the way that the company described this Joe pounder said definers offered EPA a better and more efficient news clipping service that would give their employees real-time news at a lower cost than what previous administrations paid for but it's become clear this will become a distraction so maybe we were freaking out for nothing maybe they were just cutting viral gifts for them I'm sure so I know one of the guys in the story I know Joe pounder and really yeah and you know where I know him from I was on a panel with him at the web summit and we actually had dinner together before as well oh and is gonna be doing media research for us no no he will not so he's he is what they say he is he's an Apple research guy and he doesn't hide that so you hired Joe pounder if you want research against your opponents in this case the opponents were the people and the scientists that work at the Environmental Protection Agency yeah so that's if that's not haunting to you you're not getting it so it's Trump's team going in there and going number one we're going to do political correctness here are the words that are not allowed that's a story we covered in regards to the CDC yesterday but it's also been reported about at the EPA at the CDC they're now allowed to use words like science-based and evidence-based then are you sure we're allowed to say those anymore maybe we should check yeah I thought these guys were for the First Amendment but I guess that only applies to corporations and to right-wing speakers on college campuses anyway so then you hire a guy like pounder to go in there and find out who your political opponents are inside the epa and you know what the next step is once you've found them they're goners yeah okay now in this case the people who are they think are their opponents are the ones that are actually agree with 97% of the world's scientists and are actually looking to protect the environment radicals yeah once you we did those guys out who's left well just the political animals and by the way like I know this is sort of ancient history at this point and it's been proceeding a slightly different pace but I remember back it I think the RNC the news broke that chris Christie who was supposed to be in charge of the transition said that they were gonna go into these Federal Bureau departments and not replace the top 10% the way you normally have when an administration comes into effect but to replace a 90% and we talked about it then and said that that's radical that's a crazy break with the norms of the past now they may not have immediately done that but we know that they're not filling seats at the the Department of State and if they're hiring opposition research firms to help weed out political opponents inside of places like the EPA god only knows what other organizations are suffering from this sort of thing and remember look every administration gets to put their guys at the top we get that right but 90% the people in any building the State Department EPA etcetera are supposed to be the professionals this is their job in the case of the EPA these are the guys who are paid to protect the environment meaning we don't want if we can put us on climate change you don't want your kids getting poison right you don't want the stream next to your house to have toxic chemicals in it and that's the job of the EPA to make sure that your kids aren't being poisoned and the air the water etc and climate change is a part of it now if the companies that are putting the poison in the stream are the ones paying off the donors and those are the guys who they come in and they fire the scientists and they replace ninety percent of the people not with professionals but with political hacks well then you're not going to protect their environment and you're not going to do any of the things that the government needs to do to protect its citizens yeah because they don't serve us anymore I look I I know that it's tiring to hear the same thing over and over again but unfortunately especially in the case of these Republicans in Trump they have just they've made this swamp so much larger so much swampy ER yeah and they've just thrown away any semblance as serving the public they get financed by private interests and they serve those private interests yeah and and for them too and then they make a mockery of it by doing these no-bid contracts there was a panic at the EPA what to fire scientists so you needed to make that not only one company could get that contract why because it wasn't an open bid on who's going to do a better job of serving the EPA they wanted to hire the one company who would go after their political opponent or what they perceived to be their political opponents including scientists at the EPA so that's what this Trump administration is about you just watch the
