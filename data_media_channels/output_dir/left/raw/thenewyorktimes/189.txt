1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,290
Female Democratic candidates
won historic nominations

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,060
in elections in
Southern states.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,310
“What happened
tonight is amazing.”

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,410
“I’m honored to be
here at this moment.”

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,560
“We are writing the next
chapter of Georgia’s future.”

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,530
In Georgia, Stacey Abrams
became the first black woman

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,730
to be a major party
nominee for governor

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,860
in the United States.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,176
“I am so grateful to the
thousands of you in this room

10
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:25,050
and around this state
and around this country

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,860
who have joined me on
this drive to history.”

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,070
[cheering and applause]

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,000
She got more than 75% of the
vote over her challenger.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,590
And there were others, too.

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,400
In Texas, a former Dallas
county sheriff, Lupe Valdez,

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,220
became the state’s first
Latina and first gay nominee

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,390
for governor.

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,690
And Gina Ortiz Jones, an
Iraq war veteran and daughter

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,510
of a Filipino immigrant,
became the first lesbian

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,016
and woman of color to win
a nomination for Congress.

21
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:55,200
“When Houston families are
threatened, we fight back.”

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,350
Lizzie Pannill Fletcher also
won a hard-fought nomination

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,510
for a House seat in a
state that isn’t known

24
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,100
for nominating many women.

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,440
“When I was 12 years old,
I knew exactly what I

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,240
wanted to do when I grew up.”

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,510
In Kentucky, Amy McGrath,
the first female Marine

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,790
to fly an F-18
fighter jet in combat,

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,470
defeated the Democratic
establishment’s

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,320
favored candidate to become
the nominee for another seat

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,030
in the U.S. House.

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,220
Some of these candidates
were backed by the national

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,540
Democratic Party.

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,370
But other victories
came as a surprise.

35
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,650
“— a stronger and fairer Texas.”

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,320
In November’s midterm
elections, all of these women

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,370
will be running against
male opponents,

38
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,760
most of them white.

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,510
They will also be
running in traditionally

40
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,370
Republican states
and districts.

41
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,470
So the midterms will tell how
much demographic, economic

42
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,680
and social forces
are shifting politics

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,202
in conservative
parts of America.

44
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:45,660
The Democratic Party has been
struggling to define itself —

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,380
“Thank you.”

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,080
— after the 2016
presidential loss.

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,640
But these campaigns
now give it

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,190
a chance to try out a
political strategy ahead

49
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,130
of 2020 —

50
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,990
energizing a coalition of
young and nonwhite voters

51
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,910
with a progressive
message instead of

52
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,920
trying to win back
rural white voters.

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,730
[cheering and applause]

54
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,440
“I wish the election
were today.

55
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,110
I think we would win
overwhelmingly today.

56
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,430
But it’s not today.

57
00:02:09,430 --> 00:00:00,000
So we just take it one
district at a time.”
