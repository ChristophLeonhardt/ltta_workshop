00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
hi friends so I'm a relatively small

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,549
person and that has advantages for sure

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,200
I can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reading nook out of most</font>

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,910
closets cabinets and pieces of furniture

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,250
I can weasel my way to the front of

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,040
pretty much any concert and there's no

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,650
mass cultural disapproval of me<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,390
the size that I am but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,070
definitely times where I wish I was not

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite so small in stature like this week</font>

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,380
when I was walking on my way to pick up

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,109
this here piece of art and grab a cup of

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,480
tea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was not this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exact cup but very</font>

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,460
similar half a block away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from me a man</font>

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,510
met my eyes he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was walking directly down</font>

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,610
the Sun and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sidewalk holding something</font>

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,280
a coffee cup and umbrella I don't

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,320
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I moved aside to pass</font>

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,190
him he shifted left<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so I stepped</font>

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,039
right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> did he and this wasn't one</font>

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,570
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things where two people get</font>

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,640
locked in an unintentional merengue

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,320
trying to let each other by he was

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,690
staring directly into my eyes in a way

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,109
that let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know he was trying to get in</font>

26
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,149
my way when I finally managed to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,069
of a half spin and barely squeeze around

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,020
him there was a woman trying to pass him

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,119
from the other direction I nearly ran

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,960
her into a store window and she was the

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
one to say sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight</font>

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,640
crossed<font color="#E5E5E5"> lenti this wasn't even close to</font>

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,100
one of the more egregious times but if

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,420
you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that feminist blog</font>

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,700
for a minute you know how women are

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves small sit</font>

37
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,450

next to on the train is man sweating

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,950
like his soul depends on it move out of

40
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,360
the way of do types when you're walking

freaking organs occupy as little space

45
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,970
as you possibly can just disappear into

00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,060
things so that I could just balloon up
