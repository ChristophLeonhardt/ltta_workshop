next week on the 12th of June there's going to be a mammoth voting session going up to midnight past midnight even in the House of Commons and it's going to determine the future of brexit on the 12th of June just a couple of days before the volition by-election there's going to be a mammoth voting session in the House of Commons and it's being put forward and pushed by Theresa May and the reason people are so unhappy is happening before the Lewisham by-election is because it means there's one less remain MP to vote that's how tight this is remember Teresa Mays government is hanging in there just it's a minority government but it's hanging in because the dup are propping them up with a few votes but even that's not enough because Teresa Mae's got her own party rebels to deal with so she's relying not just on the DUP but hoping to god that some people in the labour party might agree with her and the people in her own party are actually gonna vote with her I mean it's it's it's really crazy this could be the end of May's Premiership it could result in a vote of no-confidence it could be the end of brexit it could delay brexit it could be the end of Jeremy Corbyn because he's having problems which we'll get into in a minute and this is crazy this is the maddest time of Briggs it's so far so it's certainly going to be an interesting night Briggs it really does depend entirely on this vote in the Commons but what's happening so last night labour announced that it wants to table amendments so the EU withdraw a bill the trade bill and the customs bill labour says that the government should now be seeking full access to the single market after breaks it with this new single market deal so I speculated that this has core been tryna keep hold of lewisham East because in the by-election that the Dems are making real gains that seriously campaigning hard they want to make this another Richmond so it could be to do with Corbin keeping the remained wrote from Lewisham east it was about 60 70 % remain but the question is can Corbin order his MPs to vote for the European Economic Area amendment on the 12th of June latest Labour's shadow brags its secretary Kirsten Merced on The Today program quote the difficulty with that and I think everybody recognizes this is that there are very strong and different views across the parliamentary Labour Party that particular amendment so asked there's unity on all the others and we will all be voting together on that amendment we are very divided views but Corbin really wants to keep full access to the single market at least that's what he says I mean Corbin's it breaks a tear and always has been he was probably originated before Faraj I think this is a he's an old school programs it type it just shows what a sellout Corbin's become and this could all because akatosh catastrophic for the Weber party this could split the party down the middle because you've got some Labor who are trying to maintain their appeal to the working-class voters who overwhelmingly voted breaks it and you've got some Labor who are just so far left and crazy that they don't care what people think because they're not Democrats they're ideologues now could these lords amendments to the bill be passed in the Commons is the question so Sadiq Khan has encouraged his former colleagues to vote in favor of the amendments regardless of what constituents think nice for him it's possible the Tory rebels could join forces with Labour MPs and Lib Dem MPs to vote in favor of these Lords amendments which would give powers to delay and even stop begs it now there's a just a few amendments wanted to include here I won't bore you but the three important ones I saw was one amendment requires the government to obey EU rules on asylum seekers no thanks another one makes it hard for the UK government to change EU laws that remain in force after we leave the EU and another one makes it harder for the UK government to change equality and environmental was from the EU so all these amendments are about keeping Britain in a stranglehold on the EU regulation and because of the the difference of opinion on these issues because the fact that Parliament really is split down the middle may could face a rebellion from her own Tory MPs right Anna sue Bri labor could face rebellions from their own MPs Corbin's now endorsing this new single market deal and it makes it tricky for labour and the reason why is 83 labour peers defied Corbin's order to abstain and they voted in favor of the UK stain in the European Economic Area which resulted in a government to fee and Corbin instead of backing remaining MPs has created this brand new puzzle proposal that's going to now split the party people are wondering where the hell did this come from Corbin where did this announcement come from it's it's a real u-turn for a man who's used to be brags it are brags a tear just take a look at this video of those two having a massive row in Parliament can the Prime Minister now tell the house when we will debate the trade bill and when we will debate the customs bill she's had 23 months in order to get ready for it the right honourable gentleman talks about the state of the negotiations but the right honourable gentleman talked about the state of the negotiations before December he was saying that the negotiations won't get to get going to get anywhere what to be get a joint report agreed by the European Council he said before March we wouldn't get what we wanted in the negotiations what did we get an implementation and an agreement with the European Union Council we're now in negotiation for the best deal for the UK when we leave the EU and we will get the best deal for the Europe UK when we leave the Prime Minister three months without a better answer than that from the Prime Minister mr. mr. Deputy Speaker how can they negotiate in the future interests of people's jobs and living standards when cabinet members are more interested in putting their own futures first fundamentally mr. Deputy Speaker how can this government negotiates a good deal for Britain to defend people's jobs and living standards when they're unable to reach an agreement within themselves I bet that you are loving watching all this bickering and fighting the 12th of June is going to be an exciting day it's going to be an era defining day it's going to define our future it's going to define brexit and cramming these votes in just before the Loess shimmies by-election keeping people past midnight just to do it before the 14th shows just how close this is Theresa May doesn't have a majority in parliament she relies on the DUP can't even rely on our own party Tories face rebellion and the Labour Party faces rebellion you know the only party that's consistent on this are the euro foil Liberal Democrats that's how insane this hill situation is amidst brexit chaos the only people with a consistent message are the Lib Dems what's happening it's you know it's it's madness and I find myself rooting for Therese it may go on girl please get this done I know I'm probably in the minority here but I think at this point it's a her legacy and she wants to get this done and gosh she can't because her own party is not a Conservative Party anymore a conservative party once whatever immediately said no to a European super-state that wants to have governor's from abroad with unelected leaders a conservative party would say no but people like ana Supre and half the rest of the Tory Party are potentially going to vote against Theresa May and screw-up brexit the 12th of June is a landmark day for brexit and it could go many ways greg's it could move forward breaks it could be delayed bread's it could be stopped Tereza may could lose leadership jeremy corbyn could lose her leadership jeremy corbyn could form a government who knows in this mad post brexit world or even brexit world if you want to think about it that way the 12th of June is the landmark day for Bragg's it and I for one I'm pretty terrified about what's about to happen if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe and download the new rebel app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store you
