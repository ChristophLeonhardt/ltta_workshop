as Rachel's pointed out it only takes one and this is gonna be a different take on how it only takes one and what that means one senator can stop the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice one perfectly placed senator Republicans have a 51/49 majority on the Senate floor but Senator John McCain is too ill to vote which means Republicans just have a one vote advantage on the Senate floor 52:49 but when they first Trump Supreme Court justice nomination came to a vote on the Senate floor three Democrats voted for Neal Gorsuch three Democratic senators in states where Donald Trump is popular Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota where the president visited tonight and campaigning against her and where Donald Trump won by 36 points Joe Manchin in West Virginia where Donald Trump won by 41 points in Joe Donnelly in Indiana where Donald Trump won by 19 points all three of them voted for Neal Gorsuch but this time everything could be different if one senator does what He has promised to do a retiring senator in his final months in office who is not in the Senate leadership or a chairman of a committee is normally a powerless figure who is in the ongoing process of bidding fond farewell to his colleagues but tonight the occasional Trump critic Republican Senator Jeff Flake who is in his last months in office has positioned himself to become the most powerful senator he's not a chairman of a committee he is normally ignored by most of his Republican colleagues and by the Republican majority leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell Jeff Flake is normally a quiet mild-mannered senator whose only claim on attention has been his occasional sharp and eloquent criticisms of President Trump but they have mostly been criticisms of the president's style not his policies Jeff Flake has supported most Trump policies but there's one Trump policy that Jeff Flake truly hates a recent Trump policy and he has declared his willingness to launch the Senate version of a war over that policy and no it is not the policy of arresting and jailing children and infant babies on the southern border for Jeff Flake the very worst thing that Donald Trump has done is illegally imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and the European Union tariffs on products that have nothing to do with our national security Congress has the sole authority to raise or lower or eliminate tariffs something that Congress seems to have forgotten just like Congress has the sole authority to raise or lower taxes the president cannot raise taxes with an executive order but decades ago Congress inserted a little noticed loophole in international trade law allowing the president to unilaterally adjust tariffs for national security reasons only and Jeff Flake is outraged that Congress is allowing the President to illegally use this power since there is not a national security issue involved in these tariffs and he wants Congress to pass a law that would close that loophole Jeff Flake is pushing a bill along with senator bob Corker who sponsored the bill to do exactly that it wouldn't close the loophole completely it would simply require a Congressional vote to approve any tariff action taken by the president because of national security repeal Consent Leader Mitch McConnell who knows the Trump tariffs are a violation of international trade rules and a violation of American law is afraid of getting in a fight with Donald Trump especially afraid of getting in a fight with Donald Trump during the election season and so Mitch McConnell is refusing to allow Jeff Flake to have a vote on that bill in any form even as an amendment to some other legislation on the Senate floor and so on Sunday George Stephanopoulos asked Jeff Flake what has turned out to be the most important question of the week the most important question of the here are you prepared to use your other powers to do that I know that you've considered at least on this issue of tariffs and a couple of other issues saying that as a member of the Judiciary Committee you will no longer allow judges to come out of the committee unless you there's action on issues like tariffs as George will put it in his column article 3 branch is important the courts certainly and we've approved a number of judges that is important article 1 the Congress article 2 the executive are important as well and I do think that unless we can actually exercise something other than just approving the president's executive calendar his nominees judges that we have no reason to be there so I think myself and a number of Senators at least a few of us will stand up and say let's not move any more judges until we get a vote for example on tariffs let's not move any more judges of course Jeff Flake said that before he knew that by the middle of the week we would be headed for a vote on a Supreme Court justice yesterday Daily Beast reporter Andrew desiderio interviewed Jeff Flake and delivered a report with the headline Jeff Flake I will block Trump judicial nominees until GOP votes on tariffs Jeff Flake told Daily Beast I'm committed to getting a vote on tariffs that was 24 hours before Jeff Flake knew he was going to be facing a vote on a very important judge before he leaves the Senate the next Supreme Court justice Jeff Flake is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee there are 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee and 10 Democrats so it takes only one Republican vote against the nomination in this in the Senate Judiciary Committee to defeat that nomination in the committee and so if Jeff Flake doesn't back down and stays true to what he said before Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement Jeff Flake can be the senator who stops the next Trump nominee to the Supreme Court normally a nomination that is defeat did in the committee dies in the committee that's the end of it but in this case the nomination would still go to the Senate floor Mitch McConnell would still bring it to the Senate floor with the report technical report that the Judiciary Committee voted against it but that wouldn't find the Senate floor it would go to the Senate floor though with one Republican voting against it and that would give plenty of encouragement and political cover to the three Democrats who might be inclined to vote for the nomination by that time there might be enough pressure on Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine and Republican senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to vote against the nomination because of the certain knowledge that the new Supreme Court justice would overturn Roe versus Wade and therefore allow abortion to be made illegal in several states that would choose to do that susan collins and lisa murkowski are the only two pro-choice Republican senators so if Jeff Flake does not back down from what he said he would do to block Trump judges before he knew that one of the judges he would have to block would be a Supreme Court justice then Jeff Flake could create a dynamic situation on the Senate floor where anything could happen the Democrats might be able to hold all of the Democrats then in opposition to a trump Supreme Court nomination and then on the Senate floor it would only take that one Republican to kill the nomination and if Jeff Flake is that one Republican he would then leave the United States Senate with a very important place in history leading off our discussion now Jill wine banks former assistant warteg eight special prosecutor an MSNBC contributor Neera tanden president of the Center for American Progress she was also Hillary Clinton's policy director during the 2008 presidential campaign and Ron Klain former chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee and an Obama administration of he has worked on several Senate confirmations of Supreme Court justices both in his Senate staff position and in his White House positions and with that Ron we're going to begin with you I know you were on the Judiciary Committee during the Clinton confirmations getting Ruth Bader Ginsburg through the committee within the Obama administration you helped get Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan through the Judiciary Committee with your experience what do you see as the possibilities tonight well I think the Democrats are going to have to fight hard but I think if they fight hard it's an open question as to what will happen you laid out one scenario Lawrence I think there are others look I think the key thing is to focus on a woman's right to choose we didn't stop Mitch McConnell when he stole a Supreme Court seat in 2016 but we have to stop Donald Trump's row reversal reproductive rights ripoff we have to not let this happen I think that Democrats showed they could beat the odds when they beat Robert Bork in 1987 I think if they fight hard and organize they can put pressure on Collins on Murkowski on flake and potentially derail whatever Trump's trying to do here near attend and Jeff Flake at 8:56 p.m. tonight knowing what he said in his little-noticed comments on Sunday and and Tuesday issued a written statement that doesn't really say anything he said as I have said before approving a principled conservative who will interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench should be our top priority okay standard language in these press releases and then he simply said as we turn towards filling his seat I look forward to the Senate fulfilling its responsibility of providing advice and consent during a robust confirmation process near it that's Jeff Flake not saying he will not saying he won't not saying anything but he's got to be thinking tonight about what he has been saying before tonight the the most crucial question for Jeff Flake is if you have qualms about this presidency if you give speeches to the American people saying that this president is flattering norms and laws and rules of law and democracy itself the one step he can take to end that to actually discourage it to stop it is to vote against this nomination a nomination which has added importance because of the norm breaking rule breaking that happened with Merrick garland as stolen justice seat that justice course itches in today but I want to say I absolutely agree with Ron that women are leading this resistance they have led the activism in the country what is really happening here is the Donald Trump will put forward a justice who may say one thing or sound good or sounds reasonable but will overturn roe v wade and it is up to the American people to say that that is a bridge too far it is up to women across this country to organize to engage to use democracy's tools to say to Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski you cannot vote for these nominees and this nominee are such a nominee and claim you are pro-choice that is ridiculous Jill one banks I know you have argued cases to the Supreme Court I want to get your reaction to what it will mean to practitioners as a legal practitioner to have this Kennedy seat filled by let's just say another version of Neal Gorsuch I think the difference between the Gorsuch appointment which was replacing a conservative with a conservative is that this is replacing a person who actually listened to arguments on both sides and who was a centrist in a way not as much of a centrist as he is known as because he's done a lot of decisions that I would consider to be bad Hobby Lobby Gore versus Bush many others some of the gerrymandering cases some of the rights cases but he was more of a person who was known at least as a decisive factor in the 5-4 decisions so it's much more important that the Democrats stand up and be strong and that some Republicans join in and say that we need to have someone who will listen to the arguments as a practitioner we want to have an open-minded judge who will listen to the arguments put forth and will make a sound decision on it and that's what I'm afraid of I am so worried about democracy and all the rights that we've come to take for granted that I've grown up with being abolished under this new Court Ron Klain how you've worked on exactly this strategic question both in the Senate and in the Obama administration how do you hold on to the Democrat who is in a state like North Dakota yeah and we've had Democratic senators in states like that in in in every one of these Supreme Court votes that you've worked on how do you hold on to Heidi Heitkamp when the president flies up to her State tonight in North Dakota campaigning against her and Donald Trump is so overwhelmingly popular in North Dakota well a couple things Lords first I think a reminder that President Trump let up and campaigned against her so trying to make peace with Donald Trump is a fool's errand for her right Trump is gonna fight her either way whatever she does so she needs to just do the right thing and look I think what happened with Judge Bork is a model here judge Bork was nominated by a very popular public president Ronald Reagan he had superb credentials and people said the Democrats couldn't hold together they couldn't possibly win and yet the Democrats did hold together and got six Republicans to cross the line of a with them now the Senate is in worse shape now but I do think that if the cases may persuasively about the rights the American people will lose especially the right to choose by confirming this justice you can hold our Democrats you can flip a few Republicans and you can beat this person just like the Democrats beat Robert Bork in 1987 near I've talked to Democratic staff strategists tonight who are saying it is all about Susan and Lisa Murkowski and that every bit of pressure needs to be put on them that they can't stop this with just Democratic votes at this point anyway they need to pick up at least one Republican or more and I just want a rote that's absolutely true and I just want to remind everyone that a year ago at this time health care hung in the balance in a very in a very similar way and the American people rose up people flooded town halls they made calls this is not inevitable Mitch McConnell today tried to sound as if it's everything's on track he's gonna have the vote two before the elections because he wants us to believe it's impossible to fight this but the truth is that Ron is absolutely right these justice justice fights judicial fights have been fought and won and I would like to say I remember you know 20-25 years ago women started engaging in national debates on abortion because roe v wade was on the bounce with George Bush senior's election fact that was the first time I became politically active at all on the choice issue back in my college days and the fact that we are facing a question of whether Roe will be the law of the land and this time means that it's really going to be up to women to engage this in this fight to call your senators tomorrow all of your Senators tomorrow and to engage Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and flake the whole panoply of Republican senators here have to recognize that Roe is on the line and that they want to they don't want to talk about it but we have to merit Anna and Jill wine banks thanks for joining our first round of discussion thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last
