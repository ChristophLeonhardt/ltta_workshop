I'm at Leicester Square in the London
gathering and as you can see there's
just this guy here recording and so on
showing out of the way and then a bit of
laughing if you turn around who's here
boys every woman what has everyone made
a bit so far all these people can have
stories to tell today so they'll be
pacing as a video response to this video
so if you look down there and there
should be loads of videos over the next
week or so check them out and find out
how much of a good day they've had so
thank you everyone
