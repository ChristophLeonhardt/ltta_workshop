young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcasts of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio last Tuesday there were primary elections in Virginia South Carolina Nevada and Maine and there was one particular election that people had a close eye on because it showed us whether or not challenging Trump would be beneficial or detrimental to Republican candidates the Republican candidate that I'm talking about is representative mark Sanford who was primary by a young woman her name is Katie Arrington who identified as a strong Trump supporter now Mark Sanford who we at TYT have never really been big fans of has challenged Trump on a few occasions and Katy Arrington has capitalized on that as her main platform issue she has attacked Sanford for not being pro Trump while she has been very Pro Trump so state representative Katy Arrington who hammered Sanford as a traitor to Trump won the GOP primary in a victory that may spell the end for Sanford's long political career in the state of South Carolina so his willingness to question Trump who is lionized by the GOP primary electorate proved politically fatal so this is uh this is interesting because there has been a pretty noticeable change among long-standing senators and congressmen in that in the beginning they were much more willing to question Trump certainly in the general election before he got elected they denounced him when that Access Hollywood tape came out you know where Trump said that he grabs women by the genitals and that he moves in on them like a bitch those are actual statements that our president made but now all of a sudden they support anything and everything he does there's very few there are very few lawmakers who do challenge Trump and those who do challenge him have decided to retire so what does that say about the Republican Party what does that say about Republican voters is it possible for someone to stand up to Trump on the right without destroying his or her career yeah I mean this is kind of what we're talking about to what extent is the GOP going to step up and represent those things that represent or reflect I should say this country's values and to what degree are they just going to stand up and salute a leader who they know really doesn't speak to them in any way that resonates with their values I think the answer is there they're not going to step up there seeing that he's winning right now in this bizarre way none of them can believe it they all talk about him behind his back we've seen many many a story from inside the GOP and from even inside the White House about how everyone considers him a joke completely and manifestly incompetent but having said that to go up against him you take on the Twitter storm now just speaking of Twitter Sanford I believe the twit the tweet that that Trump delivered the anti Stanford tweet was sort of at the 11th hour it's a last minute tweet so Trump did tweet in support of Katy Arrington just three three hours before the polls close so it's very hard to tribute too much significance to that right exactly and so but you don't need to attribute too much significance to that because what Arrington did was was I guess smart from a political strategy or political perspective she ran on a campaign where she consistently attacked Sanford for not being Pro Trump enough and then you know really applauded herself as being a firm supporter of Donald Trump so I want to quickly go back to what Sanford had said about Trump that was critical in 2017 he told POLITICO that Trump has fanned the flames of intolerance and has been one of the few GOP lawmakers to demand that Trump releases tax returns which i think is awesome that he did that again I don't right no a fan of Sanford but I think he was right I wanted to see Trump's tax returns and he certainly did the did fan the flames of intolerance in the country I mean we've been seeing it and experiencing it ever since he got elected into office now I do want to show you what care Katy Arrington had to say this is a video 5 and you know here's here she is talking about how she's the party of Trump Joe Cunningham and the DC Democrats are the party of Nancy Pelosi we are the party of President Donald J Trump it's the year of the woman it is the year of Trump let's say who is gonna go to Washington and be supportive of what we in South Carolina want okay you can see that she is a smack talker you know she's comfortable in that role kind of uh it's not quite pro wrestling but for politics it's much closer than you'd normally find yeah if you're listening and not watching I'll just tell you she's kind of moving back and forth and using her hands and she's got a very aggressive style and she's attaching Pelosi Democrats these are things that are kind of basic talking points in other words she's not providing solutions or even specific issues as reasons that she should be voted into office you know she mentioned Elizabeth Warren in that list of politicians that the supporters booed and I just I want to have a polite conversation with them and just ask them what it is that they specifically dislike about Elizabeth Warren do you dislike when she held Wells Fargo accountable when they were you know committing fraud against consumers was that one of the things I mean what do you dislike about just curious okay anyway no no I think it's a fair point because she is certainly an advocate for for the everyman I mean it generically and so the idea somehow that Elizabeth Warren could be a campaign issue you could run on you can don't get me wrong you can say things about Elizabeth Warren you can you know talk about foreign policy records and all the rest and you know that they bring up during her her elections but to use her as a talking point as and to get boos but again that crowd is into that trumpian thing it's uh it's it's almost like a it's like a church-going crowd you know you say one thing and they say you know Amen Warren's been fighting the Wall Street bankers and the swamp that Trump supporters claimed they want to fight back against I mean it's just it's all really fascinating stuff anyway I we do want to show you what Mark Sanford had to say in his concession speech so let's take a quick look at that it may have cost me lunch in this case but I stand by every one of those decisions to disagree with the president because I didn't think at the end of the day was either concurrent with the promises I made when I first ran for office or the voices of the very people the first district that I represent so he's saying that he's going to stick by his principles even if it means that he loses and he lost too easy wasteful Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of
