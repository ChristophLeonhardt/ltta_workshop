how did the parkland shooter officially charged today slipped through the cracks of the Broward County School District we have talked a lot about how he got his hands on a gun we've talked very little about the policies and politicians that caused his high school to let him through the door lefties have long harped on the school to Prison Pipeline and advocated lower and lower disciplinary standards for juvenile delinquents my guest today suggests in a recent piece for City Journal that it was precisely Broward County's effort to fight that so-called school to Prison Pipeline that may have helped the parkland shooter evade law enforcement he suggests in another piece that Barack Obama's policies may have made our schools less safe we will discuss with education policy scholar Manhattan Institute senior fellow and my old pal max Eden then we will discuss education policy more broadly because conservatives never talk about education policy because it isn't as sexy as deregulating the EPA or drilling in Anwar baby those are good but conservatives sometimes ignore education policy the left hasn't so now they dominate the culture we will discuss conservative approaches to education and how the Trump administration is doing finally the news and Dred Scott I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show and before we get to any of that we have got

nevertheless go to da Vinci meet dot-com / coffe FA Co V Fe Fe for details alright let's get into this just a little context you remember that interview of Sheriff Scott is real a week or so ago where he said he was doing an amazing job even as he explained he failed in every single aspect of his job and his cowardly deputies wouldn't even go into the building where the shooting was happening in in that interview there was a largely overlooked part where Jake Tapper presses him on what new law what new lacs law enforcement policies played what role they played in this shooting here is sheriff Israel were there not incidents committed by the shooter as a student had this new policy not been in place that otherwise he would have been arrested for and not able to legally buy a gun what what you're referring to is the promise program and it's it's giving this school the school has the ability what under certain circumstances not to call the police not to get the police involved on misdemeanor offenses and take care of it within this school it's uh it's an it's an excellent program it's helping many many people what this program does has not put a person at 14 15 16 years old into the criminal justice in the criminal justice system what if he does something violent to his student what if he takes bullets at school what if he takes knives to school what if he threatens the lives of fellow students then he goes to jail that's that's not what happened in the promise but that's not what happened why shooter no I know Sheriff I know in theory that your theory that you're talking about but the reality is different the sheriff keeps using words like excellent and amazing and I you know I don't think those words mean what he thinks those words mean I also love watching that clip because it reminds me of what Jake Tapper can be what every blue moon Jake Tapper does when he's not being a mean-girl shilling for Democrats he actually can be a journalist and be pretty hard-hitting so this is the context there are these new policies that are at schools across the country and in particular here in Broward County that do not punish kids do not put them into the criminal justice system try to let them slip through the cracks and sometimes with tragic results I'm joined now by max Eden senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute before that Max was program director of the Education Policy Studies department at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on early education school choice and federal education policy his work has appeared in scholarly and popular outlets and now here clearly he's gone downward trajectory those outlets include the Encyclopedia of Education economics and finance National Review Claremont Institute US News and World Report the Washington Post that's okay we'll forgive him for that and the Weekly Standard before all of that max studied history at Yale where he and I caused a lot of political trouble and one afternoon actually hung out with Jim Acosta max thank you for being here max my first question do you remember that afternoon we hung out with Jim Acosta before he completely morphed into Ron Burgundy from anchorman oh my gosh do I ever so just just for context freer for your for your friends out there Michael and I tried to get mitch Daniels to run for president because we thought he was the one Kennedy who could beat Barack Obama and I still think we were right I do tell ya I remember two things Michael or one thing really and it's how much we do and how little we actually knew right you and I were sitting there thinking we knew it was gonna happen next in American politics and like we were ahead of the curve we saw something that nobody else saw we were wrong we were quite wrong you didn't see this we didn't see Trump we certainly didn't see Jim Acosta becoming most of all which which begs the question were we blind was he always Ron Burgundy was he really then or did he become different I don't know Michael I sort of think I do sort of think it was the seeds were always there because people said well was he a crazy liberal or a lefty I don't think it was that I think he just one morning he woke up and looked in the mirror and he's and he's been in love ever since either just jilted lovers he and his mirror let's get into it let let's start with what everybody is talking about which is this high school shooting in Florida what responsibility does the Broward County School District to bear for letting this shooter slip through the cracks yeah so a little bit later on in that clip that you showed part of sheriff israel says you know you can't blame my department for malfeasance misfeasance because we didn't do anything wrong if we weren't if we weren't told about it but the purpose of the policy that Broward County Schools put in place in partnership with the police department was to not tell him those things it was we think that because students who get in trouble well often go on to drop out of high school or get into worse trouble later it must be because they're being punished not because they're behaving poorly so the idea is let's try to as much as we can not suspend not expel not refer to law enforcement really serious things and sheriff run see he he says these these dozen offenses including fighting including drugs we're not gonna do anything with a police with them anymore and hey our arrest rates went down aren't ia hero well not necessarily there's a reason why we want police records and that's so that when somebody like this applies for a gun when the FBI is called that record shows up but this policy was explicitly designed to not let those things show up so when we're asking there were so many warning flags how were all these warning flags missed well the policy was to try to not notice them to try to not process them we can get into specific details but that that's the that's the overarching thing that Broward did and it's a tragic results but but it's amazing to know that this isn't it's amazing to me that this isn't being talked about in these terms because you see obviously there were what thirty some-odd forty five calls to the local police the FBI was notified and everybody turned to blind and the simple explanation here is that was the policy the policy was to turn a blind eye and I've never understood when people shriek about how many Americans are in prison or have criminal records and oh the number is so high that just means America is good at locking up our criminals right that just means that we're good at tracking people who break the law I'm very glad that we lock up our criminals I would rather are criminals be in prison than here where they can bother me and where I when I walk down the street I have to worry or something Fox Butterfield had that famous headline in New York Times in 2004 the headline was more inmates despite drop in crime so I don't know if it's despite or maybe there's some relation there in another piece not just on Broward County you say that Barack Obama's administration made schools more dangerous how did this happen at a federal level yeah so you know we can take Runcie Broward County Superintendent run C's word for it he joked that it looked like the Obama administration took his policies and made it into federal policy right so the idea of try to not suspend and not expel to not issue arrests for potentially serious things because we think that they're harmful we get these numbers down Broward was a first mover in that but shortly thereafter the Obama administration issued a Dear Colleague letter very much like the title nine dear colleague letter that your viewers are probably a little bit more familiar with saying to school districts even if your rules are totally fair even if you administer them totally fairly we might come after you and investigate you for unlawful discrimination if students of different races break them at different rates so that threat was universal and the Department of Education investigated hundreds of school districts across the country major news 6la included and forced them to change these policies forced them to try to aggressively lower these rates now two really bad things happen when this happens right if the adults in the room are looking over the shoulder at the statistics rather than the students the kids know the rules have changed and if they know that the line is farther away if they know that there is no line they'll behave differently if it's human nature you respond to rules that's not something that our friends seem to understand they see all rules as oppression that's their prerogative not really how the world works that's one problem the other problem is that things get swept under the rug so how did it how did it all get swept under the rug before I can show you side-by-side the policies before after how it would have been handled differently by the books but what I also see when I talk to I when I read things when I talk to teachers when I read notes teacher comments they say that to get these numbers down principals tell them don't report these incidents will rip up the papers that you're reporting will just simply hide them from the school district in Washington DC they reduce suspensions by forty percent in two years sounds pretty damn good know how they did it they just didn't tell the district about it anymore they sent the kid home they told teachers don't let him back into the school and they just never reported it so between telling kids that there are no consequences for actions and then not telling the people up the chain of command what's actually going on in the schools that's that's a recipe for danger this reminds me a lot a lot of gun control where with gun control you it these mass shootings always seem to take place in so-called gun-free zones in states with a lot of gun control anyway and then they say well the answer to that of course is we need more gun control same here there's a this tragic shooting that takes place in a in a county like Broward County which is leading the way in sweeping these kind of warning signs under the rug and what's the answer going to be we need more feds sticking their nose in we need more policy tinkering how do we change the narrative on that how do we say you know maybe we should try a new course yeah I mean so it's it's easy to see how that's the narrative right for for a couple of reasons that's obviously what the media wants to go with because it's what they believe it's what they can use to bash the people they don't like it's entirely expected that that's where they want to have the majority to focus where they don't want to have the focus is is on a policy that they might be sympathetic to that they might not want to look under the hood on and conservatives do ourselves no favors in education policy which we can get to later by just kind of accepting the frame of the debate that's set by the left right like if the left says that the problem is too many guns or you know guns guns guns only guns then what you have the president say as well we need more guns there's no really like denial of the question or trying to flip the focus to another place so let me let me offer an alternative emphasis when the Conservatives can't really get their minds around I hope that they will be able to over the next couple years it's not really about more guns less guns I mean that plays a role that's fine the real question is how did the adults in the room not do the right thing here what was it that was influencing their judgment because given what we've read about him any responsible normal sane loving teacher loving principal would have referred to the skids of the cops out of love and the reason they didn't do it was out of fear because these policies come from the top down they're told do this you know this is the opposite side of zero-tolerance the left has honestly very very legitimate critiques of zero tolerance all of a sudden there's Columbine we're scared anything and everything can be turned over to the cops it went way too far in that direction because we didn't just trust teachers and principals to do what they think is right we set up these top-down incentives that made them act insanely and then in response to that we do it right back the other way so conservatives in education accept all the frames of our friends on the left and then just try to argue within it when they really shouldn't you know let the left beg the question like that I say this all the time I say in their premises the left is so good at this their premises avoid the debate altogether and they push us into a corner we need to reject those premises and by the way speaking of love your speaking of compassion it seems to me nothing compassionate or fair or loving about treating these kids differently about saying well you know we've got to get the statistic on this racial group down so we're just gonna we're not going to process you we have a criminal justice system to apply the law fairly to everybody and yet now all of the emphasis coming out of universities that have education policy out of criminal justice policies oh we need to inform a process let's treat some people a little differently than other people how in the end could that produce a just society how in the end could that produce safe outcomes for schools so I just last night I was talking to a gentleman by the name of Aaron Benner who was a teacher in st. Paul and what he has said repeatedly publicly in to me is there's this mass social experiment whereby we've decided to hold African American students to lower standards the softened bigotry of low expectations right as the examination called it exactly we we think that by letting things slide that we wouldn't let slide for for white kids that somehow that's that's going to that's going to help them it's very intimate and this is very interesting right because ten years ago it used to the idea was and it's an idea that you and I are sympathetic to I think I am certainly that in urban cities there are they're broken families there's poverty there's chaos the school needs to be a place where there are no excuses where there's order where they can kind of learn values that their community might not necessarily be able to give them that's what it was until about four years ago when kind of downstream of black lives matter the narrative became kind of any discipline is punishment this is not about values and dorms it's about power it's about oppression and once you once you go down that road it's very very difficult to get out of but but once you're there if if that's what you're presenting to children that that we have to hold you to a lower behavioral standard because we're oppressing you right is what builds the school to Prison Pipeline oh and what else could people conclude from that they'll say either we you know you look at your teacher and you say oh this isn't a this is an oppressive environment and so there's that conclusion or you say what I'm not good enough I'm not as good as that person so I need to be handicapped I need to be treated with some kind of policy handicap because I'm naturally more criminal or something it's so insanely bigoted and yet this is all we've heard ever since black lives matter now speaking of not accepting their premises and giving our own presences as a matter of federal policy conservatives don't pay any attention to it on education what does conservative education reform in the bullet points in the broad overview what does it look like so we don't know well enough I can tell you what it should be but I can tell you the Conservatives don't actually know their own principles on this they they think they got very caught up in this accountability movements right like we need to test we need to measure we need to we need to you know intervene where the tests and the measurements say we should intervene and you see how it makes sense from a kind of business perspective very Jeb Bush II very Chamber of Commerce but it's also just central energy you might say very low energy right it's it's it's technocratic it's it's we can pull levers from central offices and somehow improve the lives of students and because we hate the unions in the Union hates us that means that we're conservative that's not that's not I'm hoping that we're getting out of that and I'm hoping the DeVos is gonna help us get out of that we can talk about that in a second because the real conservative premise right is is is Hayek is Burke is the inability of distant bureaucrats to actually regulate affairs correctly is the utter centrality of letting small groups form their own cultures and inculcate their own values with the freedom and flexibility to do so and so what conservatives should be arguing for at every level is in a way what with teachers unions should be arguing for as well although they're not for other reasons which is just how do we give more freedom and flexibility to teachers what is it that's getting in their way what is it that we have done to schools for our own social engineering purposes that's actually preventing strong cultures from forming right that should be the conservatives that should be the conservative line I'm hoping over the next few years it will be a but it hasn't been for the past 15 years it's funny because we should have total common ground with the teachers unions we don't because they're just a left-wing government thugs but we should have common cause on this more freedom more freedom more fun more edgy Asian its liberal education for a reason right it's supposed to be the the free experience of education and speaking of education freedom charter schools are some of the only tickets out of poverty for for poor black people living in the inner cities among other groups but disproportionately racial minorities benefit here why does the n-double a-c-p oppose charter schools yeah I put two reasons out there one reason is that they have a fair degree of connections with with teachers unions there there's Jews collecting things going back and forth there are financial interests at play so teachers unions are broadly anti charter because it's a threat to their monopoly and that you know means people that they can influence will project that's done the other thing is what kind of what I was saying earlier an option of it is it's it's this kind of inversion in the way that folks to the left view you education view life view culture it used to be that these no excuses charter schools were seen as the way to transmit pooja values to students who had broken home backgrounds but it has since become another tool of oppression and in a few view if you and and there are there are ways in which I'm sympathetic to the case to and this is where we're kind of small see conservatives and and and teachers unions and you know the constituents of the n-double a-c-p up not the end of police EP themselves could come into line is that you know maybe there is a problem in charter schools I have certainly argued this that they're too top-down that they're to buy the books that they don't really empower the communities which they were intended to do so it's it's a two-fold problem what I'm less sympathetic to when I'm more sympathetic I'm less sympathetic to the notion these schools are actually forming these kids this was not with the test scores show that's not the way the outcomes show I'm more sympathetic than the notion that charter schooling was supposed to be a means of decentralization choice empowerment and as quite frequently ended up being something that an outside group comes and just layer something else around a group of people that they don't really know understand how the connection to write and and in terms of instilling those values of a former role of the school now of course the culture has lost faith in its own values it's it's cracked its own premises and so you end up with moral chaos for lack of a better term now those lefty kids in Portland whom CNN has been prostituting for the past several weeks just walked out on education department secretary Betsy Davos for whatever reason who knows this brings up a question I don't really care about the protest or the walkout or whatever what I do care about is how is Betsy DuBose doing she's doing all right you know she she was off to a off to a hard start to say the least you couldn't ask for a worse way to get through your nomination process she hit and write every major interest group right she hit the teachers unions she hit the she had the disabilities Lobby because she didn't quite know what the law was or didn't seem to know what the law was and maybe most importantly she hit the mee-mah cracy right it became a social media thing and that hobbles her right out of the gates it's really like I'm sorry to interrupt I love the word democracy I think I'm gonna re register from a Republican to a meemic rat but please go on please please do I think I think that is the conservative future but we can discuss that so she started she started toppled in the public sphere and quite frankly she started without experience and without experienced hands around her my my old boss Rick Hess would sometimes it's not a joke cuz it's true say that the center the center of the education reform world is two standard deviations to the left of America right so even the people who were kind of on the right of the movement Trump really really really a key to them didn't want to do it staffing problems within the White House didn't help either so she hasn't gotten that many good people around her and she had a very steep learning curve to go through that being said I think she's coming around to it I think that she is getting closer and closer to articulating a legitimate and powerful conservative vision of the way that schools should go I'm not sure she's there yet but certainly philosophically out of anybody they could have picked I'm most sympathetic to to what I understand her opinions to be I think they're they're the most principled of the set that Trump was considering and I have some confidence that as time goes on she'll showed you the right thing she hasn't done anything on discipline yet I think broadly because of fear of media backlash and she still hasn't quite articulated some of the philosophical points or use the bully pulpit the way that I prefer but I I see progress and I see promise for more when is the higher education bubble gonna burst our own dear alma mater what has totally imploded over the last few years lots of other colleges are having riots and hollowed out curricula and tuition is more expensive than ever am I gonna have to sell my organs to send my kids to college yes I don't think it's gonna burst Michael it's it's it's a lot of its just signaling right it's just it's not actually about efficiently transmitting a lot of it is not about efficiently transmitting particular skills that will be directly useful to the workforce it's about you and I went to Yale and and you know the fact that we went to Yale versus a place that's not Yale is what makes a lot of difference right social networks old boys club brand name I'm sure resume line that's that's not going anywhere and unfortunately Republicans are not up to the task of doing what they should on this it's like how much more could we ask college campuses to antagonize everything about America and still have and yet still have Republicans and House Republicans in the Senate not really rein in their funding at all right Jake why is higher ed costs out of line this is a huge debate has been a huge debate I could get into the academic particulars but fundamentally if you're a major institution and you're looking at indefinite blank checks you're gonna plant around those it's amazing how that economic principle works if you get a lot more money just coming in out of the sky you might just start raising your budgets a little bit more you might and the Republican Congress has shown no willingness to significantly turn the spigot right because are scared of the media criticism and you're hurting students and you know some tough love might be in order some real limitations of financial aid instruments would be an order but I don't have a great deal of confidence the Republican Party to do that and so I don't have a great deal of confidence that College will be more affordable for your kids so you can you can deal with one kidney that's fine even one lung I say although I smoked a lot of stogies I probably need both of them on the broader point before I have to let you go conservatives are accused of being anti intellectual usually by people who wouldn't know Socrates if he hit them on the head with the chalice of hemlock the right points out that the real anti intellectuals are the lefties who are running the universities and taking Shakespeare out of English department syllabi for conservatives who don't just want to read Howard Zinn or memorize the ever expanding list of invented gender pronouns mine by the way our milord how do you recommend that they educate themselves and their children you know Mike I don't know that we ever talked about this but I had a little existential crisis first semester sophomore year because I was taking Spanish I was taking constitutional law I was taking intellectual history since Nietzsche and like constitutional law was kind of a joke there has been no intellectual history since Nietzsche so that's why what do I have I had ancient Greek history with Donald Kagan right I had Plutarch I had through Citadis I had Aristotle I had a vision of the good a vision that there was a good a vision that virtue existed and and that vision was what kind of tantalized me to explore more thoughts and questions so I think you know again like conservatives seed the premise of the left even when we talk about this stuff we we talk about it as like reacting to these campus cry-baby we don't even know these kids anymore Michael the kids yelling at those professors they weren't happy they change we react to them were other than put forward no virtue exists the good exists there outside history there in our nature they're designed by our Creator and it is our duty to be the most human that we can be to study the best that's ever been written and said so a great point in virtue exists if we just say that there's a good book you know a really great entry point into all of this thought by Alistair McIntyre called after a virtue yeah that's yeah reasons and reasons to vote the Democrats is the other one you read those two books you'll have a good entry into the history of Western intellectual thought max I gotta let you go we got to get off of Facebook and YouTube if they weren't already censoring us thank you for being here we'll have to catch up next time I'm in your town all right seat belt sorry guys we have so much news to talk about I'm gonna fly through it we've got to go through the Texas primaries and I want to make one point on Dred Scott but before we do any of that I've got to say

all that none of that matters obviously who cares what we really care about or the left is tears tumblers this is some important stuff folks when we start blaming Barack Obama's education policies for making schools less safe they are gonna cry like they haven't cried since November make sure you get this as FDA approved to hold your hot or cold salty delicious leftist ears go to daily wire comm we'll be right back with all the news very quickly the Texas primaries were today weekly I couldn't sign off without talking about this this was too delicious this was too so so good Democrats told us yesterday for the past few weeks there was gonna be an overwhelming Democrat turnout you're gonna see more Democrats turn Athen Republicans we've got the blue way of coming you're gonna be like Morgan Freeman in that movie no no they said that early voting voter registrations had Democrat numbers up over 100 percent and Republicans just 10% oh no I'm Morgan Freeman and deep impact no president Trump your reaction well put very well put President Trump they have been telling us about the big blue wave in Texas for years abortion barbie promised that she was gonna turn texas blue they're trying to give amnesty to 3.6 million likely Democrat voters to turn Texas blue that's right that's right GOP turnout was over 50% higher than Democrat turnout sad over 50% higher in the gubernatorial primary Republicans broke their own record for the highest turnout in history Republicans cast just about 1.5 million votes yesterday Democrats just a little over a million sad absolutely dreadful turnout for Democrats in 2002 Democrats had a great year that cast more ballots in those races than Republicans this year 50% down said for the Senate race Ted Cruz's Senate seat Cruz picked up 85 percent of the GOP vote his next closest competitor was Mary Miller who picked up six percent looking pretty good for Ted Cruz on the Democrat side the leading contender the person who was gonna trounced Ted Cruz the appropriately named Beto O'Rourke grabbed just 62 percent of the Democrat primary vote nowhere near what Democrats were hoping maybe it's Beta Beta Roark who knows that an aspirant mean Democrats wanted to smack down George P Bush land commissioner in Texas just didn't happen Politico dejectedly reports that Bush cruised to victory by the way despite his last name George P Bush embraced president cough FA because despite the constant negative press Donald Trump remains popular and it were it helped him another takeaway from this great news I mean it doesn't really matter because we're out fundraising Democrats too but the money didn't really matter that much three Democrats who led the way in fundraising throughout 2017 they didn't even reach the runoffs in top-tier congressional races admire a former Obama State Department official he led all of his opponents in fundraising he ended up in fourth place whomp-whomp I'd also like to so that this is all good by the way the GOP should remain terrified all of history is telling us that we're gonna get clobbered in November but one good aspect of this Republican conservative exuberance is I think we're paying attention I think we actually might turn out to vote but you've got to do it if you want to win and if we win man we're gonna need to make like a triple-a gallon-sized left us tears tumblr just to stay safe one final point I'd like to make it's a quasi historical point on the stain history yesterday was the hundred sixty first anniversary of the Dred Scott decision the Dred Scott decision has regularly considered one of the worst decisions in American Supreme Court history it basically declared that black people can never become citizens if they have any slave ancestors slave or free they they just cannot become citizens that undid the Missouri Compromise of 1820 thus permitting slavery in all federal territories Chief Justice Roger Taney declared blacks quote an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations and so for inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect no rights including constitutional rights Oh Janey actually went on he knew that citizenship even for free blacks quote would give to persons of the Negro race who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the Union the right to keep and carry arms wherever they went endangering the peace and safety of the state there's a lot more in there but that's that's part of it he obviously this isn't ever reported that Dred Scott was in no small part to keep blacks from owning guns but people criticize this it was the worst Supreme Court decision ever obviously tainting me the wrong decision but I actually loved the Dred Scott decision I love this is gonna preclude me ever from running for office just that one sentence but I love it precisely because it's so clear it put Roger Taney even though he reached I suppose the wrong conclusion Roger Taney recognized very clearly rather logically the the central conflict in American slavery the internal nonsense of American slavery which is this if the language of the Declaration of Independence is correct then human dignity the human dignity that is described in the Declaration depends upon natural rights natural rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness natural rights are not something you earn there's something that our natural innate that are born into you and so the question of free blacks becoming citizens is impossible because there are only two questions here do really only one question do blacks have natural rights or do they not have natural rights if they do have natural rights then slavery is an intolerable a horrific evil it's there's no argument for it if blacks do not have natural rights then even if they become free even if they leave slavery they could never become American citizens America the American project is based on this notion this enlightenment notion of natural rights so if they don't have the natural rights they can not what what does it even mean for them to become free they certainly can't become American citizens and that Taney decision puts that logical problem into stark relief and then within eight years 600,000 Americans would give their lives to resolve that conflict and they resolved it in the former they resolved it to say that blacks do have natural rights and therefore slavery is an intolerable evil but I really do appreciate the Dred Scott decision for making a way doing away with all of the sophistry that comes along with well they're not free here but they can become free and this kind of black can be free but not this one in blah blah blah no it's a question does our Creator endow us with certain unalienable rights or does he not that's the central question of the American experiment and that's the central question of American citizenship so good stuff I'm glad it's a good thing that there were eight years that resolved that question in the right side but good on justice Taney for putting the question into relief that's our show make
