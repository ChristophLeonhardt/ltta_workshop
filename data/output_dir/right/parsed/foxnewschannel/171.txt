MORNING FOR HARSH CRITICISM FOR
THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE.
A TURKISH OFFICIAL IS TELLING
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, WE'VE
JUST RECEIVED THIS, POLICE HAVE
FOUND EVIDENCE MISSING WRITER
JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS KILLED
INSIDE THE SAUDI CONSULATE.
ALL THIS AS SECRETARY OF STATE
MIKE POMPEO IS IN SAUDI ARABIA
MEETING WITH THE PRINCE AND THE
KING OVER KHASHOGGI'S
DISAPPEARANCE.
WE'RE BACK WITH RICH EDSON AT
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AS WE
LEARN THIS NEWS, RICH.
THIS IS JUST COMING INTO OUR
NEWSROOM.
TURKISH OFFICIALS ARE TELLING
THE A.P. THAT POLICE DID FIND
EVIDENCE IN THE SAUDI CONSULATE
THAT THIS WRITER JAMAL
KHASHOGGI WAS INDEED KILLED
THERE.
>> WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS
HOW SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE
POMPEO IS GOING TO RESPOND TO
ALL OF THIS.
HE HAS A FULL DAY OF MEETINGS
IN SAUDI ARABIA.
MEETING WITH KING SALMAN,
MEETING WITH THE CROWN PRINCE
ALONG WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER.
THEY'LL HAVE A DINNER THIS
EVENING AND THE QUESTION FOR
THE UNITED STATES IS IF THERE
IS EVIDENCE, AND EVIDENCE COMES
OUT OR THE SAUDIS ADMIT TO SOME
TYPE OF SCENARIO WHERE JAMAL
KHASHOGGI WAS KILLED INSIDE
THIS CONSULATE, IS THE UNITED
STATES GOING TO RESPOND WITH
SANCTIONS?
IS IT GOING TO CANCEL ARMS
SALES?
THAT REALLY IS THE QUESTION AS
THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS THERE.
OCTOBER 2 IS THE DATE THAT
JAMAL KHASHOGGI WENT INTO THE
CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL AND NEVER
EMERGED.
DETAILS WE'VE BEEN HEARING COME
FROM TURKISH STATE MEDIA CLOSE
TO TURKISH AUTHORITIES WHO HAVE
BEEN SAYING FOR A COUPLE OF
WEEKS NOW THEY HAVE VIDEO OF
JAMAL KHASHOGGI ENTERING THIS
FACILITY.
THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE
WERE 15 SAUDI AGENTS WHO
ARRIVED IN TURKEY, WHO KILLED
HIM, WHO DISMEMBERED HIM AND
THEN WHO LEFT THE COUNTRY.
SO A LOT OF THE DETAILS WE'VE
GOTTEN HAVE COME FROM TURKISH
AUTHORITIES.
THIS IS ANOTHER BIT FROM THAT.
SANDRA.
>> Sandra: RICH EDSON, THANK
YOU FOR HOPPING ON THE BREAKING
NEWS.
THE STATEMENT RELEASED FROM THE
COLUMNIST'S FAMILY.
THE STRONG MORAL AND LEGAL
RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUR FATHER
INSTILLED IN US CALLS FOR US TO
CALL FOR AN INDEPENDENT AND
IMPARTIAL INTERNATIONAL
COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH.
THAT'S THE LATEST THAT WE HEARD
FROM KHASHOGGI'S FAMILY AND WE
CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM THE
PRESIDENT ON THIS.
>> Bill: THERE WERE TWO
SEARCHES PLANNED IN ISTANBUL.
ONE WAS AT THE CONSULATE AND
THE HOME OF HIS HOME IN
ISTANBUL.
THE ALERT COMING NOW SAYING
TURKISH OFFICIALS SAYING POLICE
HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE IN THE
CONSULATE.
THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE THEY
SEARCHED.
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT.
