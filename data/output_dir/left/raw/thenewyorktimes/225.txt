1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,208
I’m not going to put my
lawyer's hat on because

2
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:04,317
I haven’t had a chance to
examine it as a lawyer.

3
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:05,900
I’m doing it as a friend
of Donald Trump.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,380
I've known him for 28 years.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,241
I’ve been in every circumstance 
imaginable with him.

6
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,340
I think.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,460
I’ve seen him
with women all the time.

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,990
I know men who are
inappropriate and I don't like it.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,230
I’ve never seen him one
time, one time act inappropriate.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,590
[saxophone music]

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,250
[record scratch]

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,055
I’ve never seen him one
time act inappropriate.

13
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:34,950
You know you’re
really beautiful.

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,692
I'll go backstage
before a show.

15
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,900
And I'm allowed to go in because
I’m the owner of the pageant

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,250
and therefore, I’m expecting it.

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,980
I’ve never seen him one
time act inappropriate.

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,070
I just start kissing them,
it’s like a magnet.

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,137
And when you’re a
star they let you do it.

20
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:47,970
You can do anything.

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,790
Whatever you want.

22
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,980
You can do anything.

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,580
I’ve never seen him one
time, one time act inappropriate.

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,100
This may be the
best of all.

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,070
If Ivanka weren't my daughter
perhaps I’d be dating her.

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,990
I’ve never seen him one time,

27
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,120
one time,

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,099
act inappropriate.

29
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,160
[slap]

30
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,550
Donald, I thought
you were a gentleman.

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:00:00,000
You can’t say I didn’t try.
