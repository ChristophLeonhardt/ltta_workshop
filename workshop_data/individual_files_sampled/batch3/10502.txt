Oh either I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report magical thinking what's it all about at the singularity pixie-dust hallucinations LSD let's find out Stacy oh ho ho Merry Christmas this is our pre Christmas episode it's going out a few days before Christmas we don't actually have an episode this year on Christmas Day but you know a lot of people say Santa Claus is not real they think it's just magical thinking so I thought my headlines today would reflect this magical thinking obviously Santa's real because we're all getting a lot of presents right magical thinking is stopping us from taking to the streets this is from TruthDig and they were looking at this tax reform policy and how it's a big huge giveaway for the wealthy and taking from the poor again and they're asking why is nobody going down the street and part of it is the magical thinking that you know the Russia gate hoax will save us or or one of their various magical thinking's that if we go to the voting booth and we'll elect somebody and somehow that person is gonna fight for on our behalf rather than the corporations we have yeah so in other words there is no there there there's no help coming there's no cavalry there's no place like home there's only ruby slippers that you can click three times then take you over the rainbow to a fairly magic land of shillelagh sticks and leprechauns we're only crypto currencies groan yes of course you can take Bitcoin to the afterlife and to your fantasy world many of you called Bitcoin a fantasy currency but those are not in my headlines I'm gonna look I'm gonna answer the question of why people aren't taking to the streets and I'm gonna talk about these fantasy headlines and the first headline here might be one reason why people are not taking to the streets robots are being used to deter homeless people from setting up camp in San Francisco in San Francisco autonomous crime-fighting robots that are used to patrol parking lots sports arenas and tech company campuses are now being deployed to keep away homeless people the San Francisco Business Times reported that the San Francisco SPCA an animal advocacy and pet adoption group put a security robot to work outside its facilities in the gentrifying Mission neighborhood the robots presence is meant to deter homeless people from setting up camps along the sidewalks so the robot is known as canine and it's there to prevent crime well this is obviously part of a dystopian nightmare where the Robocop you have autonomous robots and machines and drones targeting human beings economically they're not participating in the grid they haven't purchased anything in six hours therefore they must be homeless therefore they must be killed and swept up into an open pit lighter fluid doused on them set a fire and what's great is that these new autonomous robots will probably be all jacked up with face recognition technology and all kinds of databases so they'll just come up to be like hey Bob we noticed you haven't bought anything in your credit card in over 14 hours so you're no longer used to society and then they put a hypodermic needle into Bob they inject him with cyanide and they sweep them down the road Merry Christmas it's Soylent Green Soylent Green is people so of course they do have all our tracking devices and our smartphones are keeping jobs so where you follow me that's why they don't want to go in streets but in terms of this k9 robots when our robot overlords become more advanced this one's not quite advanced because it was deterred I'll show you the interesting merry Christmas story here is that the canine robots circling the San Francisco SPCA has drawn mixed responses within the first week of the robots deployment some people who were setting up a homeless encampment nearby allegedly quote put a tarp over it knocked it over and put barbecue sauce on all the sensors according to Jennifer Scarlett the president of the SPCA right whether you're damaging corporate property which becoming a felony so then the next the rough flying robot was moved in and the flying Armada of Tanks moves and the you know aerial bombardment of Hellfire missiles is targeting remember it's not about homelessness because there is no such thing as home I mean we're all on planet earth they all share the same home it's about commercial T if you're not if you're not using your credit card that's defined as quote unquote homelessness and you're no longer used to society if you're not putting yourself into debt if you're growing your own food if you're sustainable in any way you are targeted for death this is the new eugenics / fascism which is coming out of the global elites in order to keep their sidewalks clear so that may better access they're freaking you know castles made from all the ill-gotten gains that they've stripped out of the economy over the last thirty years thanks to corrupt Fed and central bank policy okay so now we're moving on from magical thinking to unreal thinking or unreal reality and that is this city in Alaska is warming so fast algorithms removed the data because it seemed unreal last week scientists were pulling together the latest data for NOAA's monthly report on the climate when they noticed something strange one of their key climate monitoring stations had fallen off the map all of the data for Barrow Alaska the northernmost city in the United States was missing and this was because the temperature in Barrow was rising so fast that the data was automatically flagged as unreal and removed from the climate database it was done by algorithms that were put in place to ensure that only the best data gets included and NOAA's reports they're handy to keep the datasets clean but this kind of quality control algorithm is only good in average situations with no outliers the current situation in Barrow Alaska however is anything but average an algorithm is wipe this town off the map off the data it doesn't exist this of course could help many people would like to deny that there is no warming in Alaska even you could see we all saw the video of the Polar Bear starving to death right before Christmas we also can see even from the photo in this article the Barrow Alaska has no snow and this it's snowless and as the northern was town in America well you could you could deny reality all you want and it seems the algorithms are will help you maybe they don't want you to do anything to fix it maybe because these robot overlords want to take over in the first story we have robots that can drive away the homeless so you can pretend that there are no homeless at there there is no poverty created by Silicon Valley and blah blah blah well it's the equivalent of a hedonic adjustments you know in economics when the government doesn't want to pay anymore to Social Security recipients than they can or they don't want to pay cost-of-living adjustments so they changed the way they calculate inflation by substituting let's say steak for hamburger is a classic example that's called a hedonic adjustment and then they look at that data they say see inflation is not accelerating so we're not gonna raise rates we're not gonna have to pay any more money out for cost-of-living because there is no cost-of-living increase you see that's what the data tells us so here you've got a man-made global warming incinerating planet Earth and causing an eco Holocaust but the corporations feel like you know what that might cost us a penny at the end of the year so we'll do hedonic adjustment to our algorithm it will take out this city in Alaska that would flag us to take action appropriate for survival of the species and we're going to instead rely on our balance sheet and our algorithm like having a GPS monitor in your car that's pointing over a cliff they're saying I don't care if the cliff is there my algorithm says it's not there so I'm gonna keep driving I'm gonna do a Thelma and Louise I'm gonna go right over that cliff because that's what the data tells me I'm now flaming ball of wreckage at the bottom of the canyon I'm dead I'm incinerated I'm cooked but you know what I did it because yeah for the algorithm I used to loot the algorithm to heck with America to heck with people to heck with civilization numbers are my god numbers are the key I support the numbers even if it kills me as we establish at the top of the show Santa Claus is real a lot of people think it's magical thinking but he is up in the Arctic Circle so there could be a real world consequence of this app of snow up in Barrow Alaska is that he might not know it's Christmas because he assumes you know once the snow comes that's when all my little helpers come out and help me and I put together all the packages of our Christmas presents and the back of the sleigh and then Rudolph you know flies us around the world then we deliver all these packages but if he doesn't see the snow we might not get our presents well Rudolph is transitioning this year that's becoming a different species not become a polar bear this is not good for them it's no longer red nose to help Santa through the storm because there is no storm there is no Christmas mr. Grinch this is gonna be no Christmas this year it's been canceled and then finally here's another AI fantasy I guess it looks like that all those who's in Whoville I'm gonna be torched all this so the Lorax is gone all these robots and algorithms taking over they of course apparently they also need to be entertained and amuse just like humans algorithms okay i artificial intelligence robots well that's what this next headline suggests here's what happens if you let a whimsical robot write the next Harry Potter chapter watch out writers artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs just take a look at this chapter of Harry Potter fanfiction the the robot called it Harry Potter and the portrait of what looked like a large pile of ash is a three-page dafter of literature produced by an algorithm trained by botnik Studios on the meat of Rowling's expanse of magical universe as an author assistive predictive text document creator Jamie Bruin other writers help nudge the algorithm in the right direction the result is just as weird and uncomfortably for some of us readable as you might expect filled with the characters and whimsical vocabulary notable to rousing the logical plot however is not as great as strength so it does like come up with a whole bunch of bizarre sentences and realities worlds we might be replaced no Briggs at all this was William Burroughs you know and Naked Lunch and other classic texts I think he was stoned right they don't be a crisis he was on heroin the you know ripping apart of pages and concatenating them and rearranging them and the collage technique of literature and the fantastical nature of his otherworldly quasi science fiction informing us about the future that it would be without any connection to what we would identify as human species as we become cyborgs and it's going to be Harry Potter in the flaming trainwreck as the future comes at us at breakneck speed and just plows over everybody with futuristic police BOTS injecting cyanide into our children and processing them for frozen food you can have fetuses armed with guns shooting at people so that they're not aborted they're gonna actually shoot the people trying to abort them with gun wielding fetuses that's gonna happen in 2018 I predict Oh Merry Christmas everybody out there and Happy New Year well stay tuned for the second half a whole lot more coming your way hey welcome back to the kind of report I'm Max Keiser time now to continue our conversations Jim Rickards author and now he's a big data guy it wasn't just now big data welcome back Thank You max great so just to wrap up from our previous conversation you know you you went to the intelligence community and you said hey you know markets throw off a lot of data but and if you know how to read it correct it helps you you know predict the future or as you would say in Wall Street discount the future and then you've added a lot more data and you've come up with this and you're up mara glam and you are the chief global strategist there and artificial intelligence we didn't touch on that at all and so does that a key part of the product as such right this is actually what they call third artificial intelligence or AI this is really third wave AI so first first wave is sort of you know a big data second wave was machine learning so that the machine would reach conclusions which would then iteratively put it back into the algorithm so now the machine is teaching itself third wave is external inputs from something like Watson there other machines that can actually read plain language so every every ten q8k you know all the 10 KS footnotes hundreds of millions of pages of information it can read all that more than any Alice or all Wall Street combined could do for meaning we're working with a finish team of cognitive scientists and linguists to to advance the state of the art in terms of word identification like I can write a great car that says you know look for max and cars are in the same sentence and it's probably you okay but you can get way more sophisticated than that we're doing all of that I just saw a video on it was China you know they there have a remarkable data gathering abilities they are essentially surveying the entire population they people living there have given up the notion of privacy more or less they said you know we're willing to give up privacy completely to the state and is is this a risk in other words you're in the intelligence community you're looking for attack vectors you're looking to keep everybody safe mmm the trade-off is that you're putting a lot of data in there it's coming from a lot of sources social media obviously where people are pouring in their lives into social media and you know how much the privacy factor how do you weigh in on that is it a is it the same world that we lived in 30 or 40 years ago is the world changed or are these things still valuable it's absolutely changed radically it's not the same world we lived in 30 years ago this in some ways the human nature doesn't change human nature hasn't changed in 50 thousand years where we're basically ice age K people quick digression but if so many machines are inputting the data aren't we in fact leaving kind of human based society and moving more toward a machine based society loses genes aren't forming the data then the data is making decisions based on the machines who are then taking that data and acting out their machine worlds and then it goes in this loop of feedback loop of machines to machines so are we abdicating hume our humanity you're a big guy in the whole you know you're you're an art or you're a Christian you know you're a big fan of Jesus you know is this seems like we're forsaking our humanity for the for the further of the beast this is the devil Jim are you are you caving in to the devil I'm not caving in to the devil but I think you're you're on to something in your description of this and this is what Ray Kurzweil calls the singularity is the merger of man and machine so and you know this is portrayed in that Blade Runner area 2049 which I thought was a great movie by the way everyone hated it I just I loved it I loved 3-hour movies where nothing happens I was kind of but there was it was very very deep but you know that that's where we're merging now what and the governments modernist of course but the private the private firms you know the Google Facebook we all know they are Yahoo and Amazon and all that they just data mining like crazy and you know I like I think books about a lot of books you know it's a buy a book and says well you bought this one you might want to buy this one too well often it's you know that's interesting and maybe I will buy it so they're obviously on to something privacy is gone you know so in other words the question was one of privacy and you're feeling there is a privacy is gone worked and and you feel comfortable with that no I don't I'm acknowledging your point trade off for security as privacy in other words if I felt like I would be surveyed less than another 9/11 what happened but I'm since I'm a New Yorker I'd say I don't care let another 9/11 happen because you know stuff happens big big deal you know I don't get it I don't understand it's huge response to 9/11 a beginning here's what troubles me I would not care if the NSA surveyed everything I do they don't actually do that but they yeah they suck up a lot of metadata we always you know I wouldn't really care about that if I had confidence that it was only being used for national security purposes but I don't we saw during the Obama administration with you know Lois Lerner surveillance the tea party and prosecutions of General Petraeus and Dinesh D'Souza I'm not saying that they both pleaded guilty I must send they didn't do anything wrong I'm saying they were singled out for political reasons there's a lot of that so I have no confidence that while the government's collecting the data are ostensibly for national security purposes all it takes is somebody like Obama and Valerie Jarrett to to target you and then all of a sudden that's a whole different world so that that's troubling to me the other thing I think where people can resort to self-help this stuff is addictive and that's you know it's just very basic biochemistry so you know why are people addicted to heroin because it feels good well that's you know and finn's and things well those endorphins are triggered by a lot of things other than drugs I mean there are sex addicts there alcohol addicts or gambling addicts there the many many cons of behavior that are all addictive that they have the same biochemistry well it's pretty clear at this point that the holding that thing in your hand so I've started just you know I go out leave my cell phone home you know I just like try doing that more and more my social media is addictive gives you a higher buzz well touches on the statement devices right I think it is addictive in that way but I think that it's the devices themselves this goes back to a little before most people's time with Marshall McLuhan said the medium is the message it wasn't so much the content was the medium that you were getting it through somehow I convinced in New York a lot of us came down here to the studio today and I had my cell phone my pocket was off I turned it on later but everyone's walking around like it's you know you all know it Mike I talked to an uber driver eclosing the blue faces poor people get in the back of the car and they're all staring at the screens and their faces are blue and the dark but they're not thought here were you you're conflicted you're so you feel bit conflicted about all this in other words if the dividing line for you is that the data has to be safe and and used for thus a national strategic interests sure okay but you know the data gets hacked all data gets hacked right we haven't seen a database not get hacked correct the government database is a targeting folks I mean obviously that's clearly a dictatorial breach of the Constitution that's bad but but the data gets hacked all the time so how do you resolve that conflict or do you feel comfortable that your work which is heavily dependent on data surveillance in the end and you've given up on privacy and and and you've admitted that this is seemingly like with the work of the devil how do you Jim Rickards you know what what institution in America today do you trust in other words you trust this institution and you can say you know what all this stuff troubles me but I know that X is unimpeachable and I'm and I salute the flag to that what is that institution well I'm a member the most countercultural organization on earth which is the Catholic Church we were so out of fashion with conventional wisdom so that's that's an institution I trust but getting back to my work versus the work of the NSA we're using completely open-source data so we we buy a price feed from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the New York star anybody can do that it's not free but anybody can get that information you have Twitter's out there if I you know I used Twitter a lot I have an open Twitter account you don't have to belong to Twitter to read my counsel I choose to put that information out there and so do hundreds of millions of other people so that's that's not really what I can be programmed to make money on Wall Street you know they pick a price and then they do the trades to meet that price sure they manipulate markets so so the algorithms can be used to manipulate social behavior you know Facebook are manipulating social behavior absolutely you're developing a more sophisticated weaponized version of this with this product isn't that getting into some more trouble we're doing something very specific which is uh you know I'm not gonna tell you where the euros going to be tomorrow we're gonna tell you where there's gonna be in six months what the feds going to do in six months you know how the economy's going to do those are we're sort of long you know kind of intermediate to longer range predictive analytics in capital markets we're not trying to sell you a book we're not trying to you know we offer this to us are you saying oh there's a bomb coming in from jihad ease but okay we predicted so we're gonna drown them yeah okay does the database say wow you know we invaded their country a few years ago to take all their oil and resources and we're out of control Empire and we're murderers people for money this did model suggests that maybe the actions of the US military should be curbed in that sense and maybe there should be a more comprehensive foreign policy that doesn't prize genocide in this way right okay so we're not policy makers I can't tell the Pentagon if it data is blind and it just looks at specific outcomes you're facilitating and exacerbating a failed policy and you're making death for a higher and nor normalizing I know one thing we don't do is get our blood pressure up we're analysts we we get that we get the information we do we do consider geopolitics in addition to capital markets I can't tell Rex Tillerson what to do in North Korea I can't tell general mattis what North Korea but we can't analyze they're using a Bayesian statistics in a priority hypothesis about the probability war in North Korea we update the probability all the time actually within the last 24 hours my probability of war with North Korea which was 70 percent went down a little bit I extended the timeline I had it before the end of March now kind of go out to summer based on some things that Rex Tillerson said yesterday to the Atlantic Council that's an example of good Bayesian updating don't get married to a particular conclusion but increase or decrease the probabilities based on incoming data so we do analyze it we do advise clients as to you know what we see coming but we don't change the outcome I'm not pushing the trigger on a missile sometimes we get a rent-a-car we do the geo-locating system and everything's not working and it says drive into that brick wall this happened to me recently I was with my wife we were in Australia we were in the outback we had the driver very bright guy a nice guy couldn't be nicer but he had one of those GPS kind of things and we're driving all of a sudden he turns off the main highway were gonna dirt road I think it sound like a tertiary road and I'm like is this guy gonna like take us somewhere turn around shoot us and robbed us like what's going on here seemed like a nice guy he gets to a fence he goes oh the thing says I can keep going but I can't turn around but I never do I use maps I'm actually old my point is I want to touch on a couple other things and the cars were four years ago yeah the u.s. first pulled the trigger on weaponizing Swift you remember sure international you know against Iran and you any the alternative you predicted that alternative payment systems would erupt that's kind of what's happening right correct Iran Russia Venezuela these countries that are being sanctioned and they're abusing Swift they're inventing thanks to algorithms thank this technology thanks to cryptocurrencies they're inventing their parallel systems sure is that a good trend not for the United States is good for them I mean this is this is geopolitical harbaugh I'm on the the board of a think tank in Washington called the center for sanctions and illicit finance and my colleagues you know great people these are people who kind of invented the financial war on terror meaning they were they were in the White House and Treasury after 9/11 during the Bush administration all the laws that that we live with today they are the wrote those laws or what the regulations or enforcement and they've been extremely affect the stuff is really powerful but I tell them be careful what you wish for because if you keep hammering people with this D swifting them which we've done to the number of countries they're gonna do the work around well they're almost there so I would expect Russia and China to come up with a Syria ledger technology not Bitcoin by the way but coins a sideshow a serial ledger I mean that's the new stimulus a technology distribute ledger military-grade encryption maybe I'll have a Putin coin or Z corner won't be Bitcoin but they'll come up with their own coin and then transact among themselves right so maybe Russia is paying for China with this Putin coin and China settling its dollarization erect would you predict it for many that's right is now happening technologically and that's in that so your view as a predictive analytic guy is that that's that's becoming a bigger factor just in the u.s. we got to go actually fortunately we're out of time all right thanks being on thanks back well that's gonna do if this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser and Stacy I would like to thank our guest Jim Rickards if you want to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
