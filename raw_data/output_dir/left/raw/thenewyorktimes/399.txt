1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,560
New South Wales and its capital
of Sydney have about 100 ocean

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,780
baths and rock pools,
the most anywhere in the world.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,390
These pools are public bathing
areas filled with sea water and

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,349
often carved out of cliffs and rocks.
Some are more than 100 years old.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,139
Now a popular destination year round,
the pools have a history of segregation.

6
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:35,110
Most of them were built
exclusively for men.

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,229
Women and aborigines had to
fight to gain access to swim in

8
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:41,129
these pools in the
early and mid-1900s.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,710
Today the cliffs surrounding pools like
Bogey Hole in Newcastle and Giles Baths

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,380
at Coogee beach have become unstable
due to erosion and weathering.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,619
The Bogey Hole pool was
temporarily closed in 2015

12
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,730
because of safety concerns.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,210
Thousands petitioned the city
and it was reopened in 2016

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,129
after steps were taken to
stabilize the cliffs.

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,140
Authorities say permanently
restricting the site is not an

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:00:00,000
option given the heritage and popularity
of Sydney's original infinity pools.
