the other big breaking story tonight is that we're seeing the first excerpts from James kumys James Cummings explosive new memoir and the former FBI director didn't hold anything back The Washington Post has obtained a copy ahead of its publication next week and is reporting that it even includes new details about the alleged incident in that Moscow hotel room comely reveals that when the solution allegations came up quote Trump told him to consider having the FBI investigate the prostitutes allegation that proved it was a lie Comey says quote in an apparent play for my sympathy he added that he has a beautiful wife and the whole thing has been very painful for her he asked what we could do to lift the cloud well in response to the president's denials Comey writes it though I didn't know for sure I imagined the presidential suite of the ritz-carlton in Moscow was large enough for a germaphobe to be at a safe distance from that activity more broadly however the former FBI director offers a portrait of what he calls the forest fire that is the Trump presidency I'm joined right now by The Washington Post Phil Rucker who wrote that report who's read commis book also joining me tonight is Julian Ainsley investigative reporter for NBC News Jill wine bank's former Watergate prosecutor and MSNBC legal contributor Robert constant national political reporter with the Washington Post and MSNBC political analyst and Brett Stevens op-ed columnist with the New York Times also an MSNBC contributor all these points of view but let's start with the facts we've got just brand new tonight and that's from you Phil Rucker Phil the juicy stuff sir what's in the book well Chris it's a long book detailing all of commis interactions with President Trump beginning when he was the president-elect at Trump Tower when it was Comey one-on-one with him who briefed the president-elect on net intelligence dossier with unconfirmed allegations that you alluded to from that Moscow hotel room and he writes in the book that again and again and again and their conversations Trump would come back to that scene he would try to convince the FBI director that it was not true that it could not be true and at one point he asked Comey to have the FBI investigate the allegations in order to prove that they were not true to the American people to make that that proof that it was not true public trump was really fixated on this well this company say he did investigate and disagreed or disagreed with what the the two sex workers had said it happened in that room well call me in the book does not render a judgment about what happened he simply relates his conversations with the president but he did go ahead and investigate it it really bothered the president according to commis account because it was so painful for First Lady Melania Trump and and president Trump would bring that up with Comey in their conversations and it's important to point out Chris that Comey draws broader conclusions about Trump as a president and about this presidency he says that he's a congenital liar an unethical leader who blurs the line between the politics that goes on at the White House and what should be on an independent FBI and Department of Justice and he calls this a forest fire of a presidency that must be contained let's talk about the accusation Franco me I understand he says the president acted like a mob boss that's exactly right Comey before becoming the FBI director was a prosecutor in New York he prosecuted the Mafia went after mobsters and at a couple different points in the book he reflects on Trump and says that you know a lot of the traits that he saw in the Mafia he also sees in Trump and in the Trump White House the circle of deceit the law demands for loyalty pledges this sort of with us or against us worldview and the constant lies and Comey says it became very clear to him that the lifestyle he saw within the Mafia and the mob was evident in the Oval Office now two more questions the small hands reference which I thought was a bit cheap but also the more serious question about Trump's admitting that he likes oaths of loyalty that's right he talks about the loyalty oath and and this is something that Comey got into in his Senate testimony that we remember there was that one on one dinner Comey had with President Trump in the greenroom of the White House where the president asked for his personal loyalty they sort of went back and forth call me made clear he wouldn't give his personal political loyalty that he'd be loyal to the truth and they sort of left it at that but then after that point Trump went through a litany of accusations against him to try to convince Comey they weren't true beginning with the sexual assault allegations that were the brought up during the campaign he talked about that moment at that campaign rally where he mocked New York Times reporter served Kowalewski who is disabled and said that was not true and went through other examples as well what about the small hands reference yeah the small hands reference he describes meeting Trump for the first time at that briefing in Trump Tower and noticing a few things about his physique one that that he thinks Trump was smaller in person shorter rather in person than he appears on television Trump is 6 3 but Comey is 6 8 Comey also describes his hands as they're smaller than mine being commis and he describes his face as being orange and that he would look at the sort of center of his eyes where he suspected there were tanning goggles it's a real personal attack in this book length of the president strikes me let me go to Robert costume knows the president pretty well what do you make of Trump's reaction to this tonight he's getting this as we're getting it apparently I don't know if he has an advance copy he's already fighting a political war against the Muller probe blowing his decisions if any he's going to make on that front and now it's the Comey book and the White House has some strategy prepared but not a wholesale strategy working in coordination with the Republican National Committee and there's a lot of angst and president Trump's inner circle about could he erupt in the coming days as this book becomes the national firestorm what do you think of Comey putting in this cheap stuff about his hands at all I always believe that if you write a book your weakest cheapest charge becomes your vulnerability that people will focus on that and take you apart if it looks like a vendetta personal vendetta doesn't that hurt commis case on the facts even if he has the facts I haven't read the books I don't want to speculate too much but I will say what's more important about this book about is what it outlines about potential conduct by the president possible obstruction of justice how does the Muller probe look at the Comey book how do people in Congress look at the Comey book the little things do matter politically they're gonna create headlines but in the big picture this presidency his behavior conduct his actions that's what matters hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
