YOU WERE IN THERE FOR TWO YEARS,

00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:28,491
DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL AND

44
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:30,660
I HAD A LOST SENSE OF PURPOSE.

45

I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT MY

46
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:34,030
NEXT STEPS WERE, BUT I DID HAVE

47
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,200
OPIOIDS AND I FOUND OPIOIDS

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,367
REALLY HELPED ME ADDRESS THE

PSYCHOLOGICAL WOUNDS OF WAR.

51
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:43,573

52
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:46,209
HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM AND FAMILY

53
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,444

ME TO GET THE SUPPORT THAT I

55
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:53,716
NEEDED AND GO TO THE ASHEVILLE

56
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:56,052
VA AND FROM THERE I WAS PUT ON A

57
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:59,088
MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT.

58
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:00,857

INTERNED AT THIS AMAZING PROGRAM

67
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,471

APPROACH FOR VETERANS.

70
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,978

00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,723
COMPLETE -- 18 MONTHS PLUS WHERE

75
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:35,091
WE FOCUS ON TREATMENT AND

76
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:35,925
REHABILITATION AND REALLY

77
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,060
GETTING TO THE SOURCE OF THE

78
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,195
SUFFERING THAT LED TO THE

79
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,631
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FOR OUR

80
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,065
VETERANS.

81
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:44,800
AND THE EXCITING PART TOO IS NOT

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,035
ONLY ARE THEY HELD ACCOUNTABLE

83
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,504
FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND THEY

84
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:52,041
RECEIVE THE PROPER TREATMENT,

85
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,643
BUT WE ARE FINDING THIS KIND OF

86
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:54,310
RENEWED SENSE OF HOPE AND

87
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,445
PURPOSE AT THE END OF THEIR

88
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:57,480
JOURNEY SO THEY HAVE A STABLE

89
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,350
JOB, STABLE HOUSE AND A YEAR

90
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,151
AFTER GRADUATION FROM THE

91
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:08,724
VETERANS TREATMENT CORE THEY ARE

92
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:09,425
ELIGIBLE TO HAVE THEIR CHARGES

93
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:09,792
DISMISSED.

OFFENDERS.

99
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,098

THROUGH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

101
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:18,668
AND HAVE FACE THAT STRUGGLE AND

102
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:19,936
WANT TO TALK YOU ABOUT HOW

103
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,003
YOU'VE MADE IT THROUGH TO THE

104

OTHER SIDE.

105
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:22,638

106
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,173
YOUR TIME TRYING TO MAKE SURE

107
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:26,375

108
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,877
THOSE DOWN THE ROAD.

109
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:30,680
HOW WIDESPREAD, HOW MANY PEOPLE

110
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,682
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS COULD

111
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,417
HELP?

112
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,452
>> WELL, WE KNOW THAT

113
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:38,654
PROBLEM-SOLVING COURTS ARE

114
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:39,221
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.

115
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,257
JUST SENDING AN INDIVIDUAL TO

116
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:42,558
PRISON, THERE'S A 50% CHANCE

117
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,061
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO RETURN.

118
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:46,228
THEY ARE GOING TO RECIDIVATE.

119
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:49,598
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RESULTS

120
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:50,299
OF SPECIALTY COURTS LIKE THE

121
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,469
VETERANS TREATMENT COURT IN DRUG

122
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,137

AS WE ARE LOOKING KIND OF AT

125
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,077
WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH THE

126
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:03,179
FUTURE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, I

127
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:06,716
AM A BIG ADVOCATE FOR SECOND

128
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:07,049
CHANCES.

129
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,552
I WAS GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AND

130
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,520
A SECOND CHANCE REALLY SAVED MY

131
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,821
LIFE.

132
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:14,457
I'M SEEING THE AMAZING RESULTS

133
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,858
THAT CAN COME WHEN WE WORK

134
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:17,593
ONE-ON-ONE WITH THESE VETERANS

135
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:19,695
AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU WERE

136
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,297
A HERO, YOU MAY BE AT ZERO RIGHT

137
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:23,265
NOW BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU

138
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:23,866
BACK THERE.

PEOPLE WATCHING WHO WOULD LIKE

142
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,070
DO SOMETHING.

143
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,138
YOU HAVE A VERY SIMPLE ACTION

144
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,706
ITEM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

145
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:31,474
WATCHING, WHAT THEY CAN DO, TELL

146
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:34,477
US ABOUT IT.

147
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:34,977
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

148
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,847
I REALLY JUST ENCOURAGE EVERYONE

149
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,115
ON THIS SPECIAL MEMORIAL DAY TO

150
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,116
JUST GO UP TO A VETERAN AND

151
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:43,652
SIMPLY ASK HOW THEY ARE DOING.

152
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:44,220
ALL THE TRAINING AND

153
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,322
INTERVENTIONS THAT I'VE GOTTEN

154
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:49,925
THROUGH THE YEARS OF EDUCATION,

155
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:51,794
IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE THE

156
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,162
MOST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE CAN

157
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:56,332
SUPPORT A VETERAN IS SIMPLY TO

158
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:59,769
BE THERE AS EMPATHIC AND CARING,

159
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,872
LOVING, COMPASSIONATE FRIENDS,

160
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:04,273
AND THAT WAS WHAT GOT ME THROUGH

161
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:05,608
THIS JOURNEY AND I REALLY

162
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,276
ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME.

163
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:07,977
>> Melissa: IT IS THE VERY

164
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:09,879
LEAST THAT WE COULD DO FOR OUR

165
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,579
MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED

166
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,681
THIS COUNTRY.

167
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,116

170
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:16,786
I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

00:05:16,786 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU HAVE HELPED OUT THERE
