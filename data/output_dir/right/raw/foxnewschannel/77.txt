REALLY THE DEMOCRAT'S PARTY BEST

OUR NEXT GUEST SEEMS TO THINK

00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:14,461
SO.

00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:17,964
IN HIS LATEST OP-ED, ENTITLED,

8
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:19,799
COUNT ON HILLARY CLINTON RUNNING

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,235
AGAIN, MR. MICHAEL GOODWIN

00:00:22,236 --> 00:00:24,037
WRITES, MRS. CLINTON DESPITE HER

ENORMOUS FLAWS AND TWO

PRESIDENTIAL DEFEATS, CAN'T BE

00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,509
RULED OUT AS THE PARTY'S BEST

GOODWIN JOINS US NOW.

18
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:35,015
HI, MICHAEL.

19
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,150
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD SHE DO IT

20
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:37,450
AGAIN?

21
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:38,852
WHY WOULD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

22
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:39,452
PUT HER UP?

23
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:42,555
>> SHE IS NOT MY FAVORITE

24
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:45,392
OBVIOUSLY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

25
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,093
FIELD SHE IS UP AGAINST, CORY

26
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:48,561
BOOKER, JOE BIDEN, TO BERNIE

27
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,096
SANDERS, YOU LOOK AT THAT GROUP,

28
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:52,065
THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS 20 OF

29
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,066
THEM WHO WANT IT.

30
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,503
YOU SAY WHICH AMONG THEM COULD

31
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:58,071
DEFEAT HER?

32
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,073
THAT IS SOMETHING OF THE TEST.

33
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:03,610
SHE IS SOMETHING OF A INCUMBENT

34
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:03,943
NOMINEE.

35
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:04,911
WHO WILL KNOCK HER OFF?

36
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:06,146
I THINK SHE WANTS IT.

37
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:07,714
SHE WANTS IT MORE THAN ANYBODY

38
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:08,014
ALIVE.

39
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,582
SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE FIELD I

40
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,984
THINK SHE IS STILL THE

41
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:11,351
STRONGEST.

42
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:13,286
SHE CAN RAISE THE MONEY.

43
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:14,654
SHE HAS THE RECOGNITION.

44
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:17,123
SHE HAS A FAN BASE, LET'S FACE

45
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:17,424
IT.

46
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,093
SHE GOT 67, 66 MILLION VOTES THE

47
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:21,194
LAST TIME?

48
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,496
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE GETS THAT

49
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:24,531
MANY THIS TIME.

50
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,366
SOMEBODY HAS TO DEFEAT HER

51
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:27,634
WITHIN THE PARTY TO TAKE THAT

52
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:28,435
AWAY FROM HER.

53
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,070
I DON'T SEE RIGHT NOW ANYBODY

54
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,371
ABLE TO DO THAT.

55
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,306
AINSLEY: ESPECIALLY AFTER MAYBE

56
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:35,742
THE "ME TOO" MOVEMENT AS WELL.

57
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:36,343
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

58
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:37,677
AND I THINK THE PROBLEM, WHEN

59
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:39,446
YOU SEE CORY BOOKER FOR EXAMPLE,

60
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:46,419
WITH HIS "SPARTACUS" MOMENT.

61
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,088
HE IS COMES OFF AS A

62
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:48,488
LIGHTWEIGHT.

63
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,657
CAN YOU LEAD THE PARTY AND GO

64
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:51,491
TOE-TO-TOE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

65
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:52,659
THOSE ARE THE TESTS.

66
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,394
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OF THOSE

67
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:55,495
PEOPLE, ANDREW CUOMO, GOVERNOR

68
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:57,664
OF NEW YORK, ELIZABETH WARREN,

69
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,599
CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM ONE-ON-ONE

70
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,334
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A DEBATE

71
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,802
FOR THE PRESIDENCY?

72
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:04,337
JUST HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THEY

73
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:06,306
ALL DON'T LOOK LIKE LIGHTWEIGHTS

74
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:08,041
COMPARED TO THE PRESIDENT.

75
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:10,910
AINSLEY: EVEN JOE BIDEN?

76
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,444
PEOPLE LIKE HIM.

77
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:14,647
>> THEY ALWAYS LIKE HIM BUT THEY

78
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:15,548
NEVER VOTE FOR HIM.

79
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,851
HE GETS BASICALLY 1% WHEN HE

80
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:18,151
RUNS.

81
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,253
I THINK HE WILL BE 78 OR

82
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:21,254
SOMETHING LIKE THAT COME THE

83
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:22,188
NEXT INAUGURATION.

84
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,623
HE IS VERY OLD.

85
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:25,392
BERNIE SANDERS, VERY OLD.

86
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:27,227
I THINK CLINTON AND TRUMP ARE

87
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,795
NOT YOUNG BUT THEY'RE NOT TOO

88
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:29,496
OLD YET.

89
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,030
AINSLEY: HISTORICALLY SPEAKING

90
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,232
IF YOU HAVEN'T WON IN THE PAST,

91
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,933
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF WINNING

92
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:34,334
AGAIN?

93
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,035
WE SAW EVEN JOHN McCAIN RAN A

94
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,204
FEW TIMES, WAS NEVER SUCCESSFUL.

95
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,439
>> RIGHT.

96
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,007
ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE HAD THE

97
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:41,408
NOMINATION.

98
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,009
YES I THINK HISTORY IS AGAINST

99
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,410
HER.

100
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,744
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

101
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:46,713
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU LOOK

102
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:48,715
FORWARD, AND YOU SAY, WHO CAN

103
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,583
BEAT HER, I THINK THAT'S THE

104
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:51,684
TEST.

105
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:53,253
WHO CAN GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH

106
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,387
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

107
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:55,822
WE KNOW SHE CAN DO THAT.

108
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,123
SHE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES.

109
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:58,825
I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR HER.

110
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,627
I FEEL SOMEWHAT AWKWARD

111
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,797
DEFENDING HER AGAINST A LOT OF

112
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:04,998
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE TRYING TO TEAR

113
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,566
HER DOWN BUT I THINK IT IS HARD

114
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,334
TO SEE ANYBODY RIGHT NOW ON THAT

115
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,036
LIST WHO CAN BEAT HER.

116
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,439
KAMALA HARRIS, MICHAEL

117
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,806
BLOOMBERG?

118
00:03:12,807 --> 00:00:00,000
AINSLEY: WE COULD SEE ANOTHER
