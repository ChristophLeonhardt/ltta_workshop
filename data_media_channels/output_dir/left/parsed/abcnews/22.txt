KNOW, IS READY IF NECESSARY.
LIKEWISE, I HAVE SPOKEN TO SOUTH
KOREA AND JAPAN, AND THEY ARE 
NOT ONLY READY SHOULD FOOLISH OR
RECKLESS ACTS BE TAKEN BY NORTH 
KOREA, BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO 
SHOULDER MUCH OF THE COST OF ANY
FINANCIAL BURDEN, ANY OF THE 
COSTS ASSOCIATED BY THE UNITED 
STATES IN OPERATIONS IF SUCH AN 
UNFORTUNATE SITUATION IS FORCED 
UPON US.
HOPEFULLY POSITIVE THINGS WILL 
BE TAKING PLACE WITH RESPECT TO 
THE FUTURE OF NORTH KOREA, BUT 
IF THEY DON'T, WE ARE MORE READY
THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE.
NORTH KOREA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO END DECADES OF POVERTY AND 
OPPRESSION BY FOLLOWING THE PATH
OF DE-NUCLEARIZATION AND JOINING
THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, AND I 
HOPE THAT KIM JONG-UN WILL 
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT IS RIGHT, NOT
ONLY FOR HIMSELF, BUT PERHAPS 
MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT IS RIGHT 
FOR HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING
GREATLY AND NEEDLESSLY.
ALL OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE, NORTH 
AND SOUTH, DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO
LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY, 
PROSPERITY AND PEACE.
THAT BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL FUTURE
CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN THE THREAT 
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS REMOVED.
NO WAY IT CAN HAPPEN OTHERWISE.
IF AND WHEN KIM JONG-UN CHOOSES 
TO ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE 
DIALOGUE AND ACTIONS, I AM 
WAITING.
IN THE MEANTIME, OUR VERY STRONG
SANCTIONS, BY FAR THE STRONGEST 
SANCTIONS EVER IMPOSED AND 
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN WILL 
CONTINUE AS IT HAS BEEN 
CONTINUING, BUT NO MATTER WHAT 
HAPPENS AND WHAT WE DO, WE WILL 
NEVER, EVER COMPROMISE THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
WE WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT 
FEEL VERY, VERY STRONGLY ABOUT 
IT.
OUR MILITARY AS YOU KNOW, HAS 
BEEN GREATLY ENHANCED.
WE'LL SOON BE AT A LEVEL THAT 
IT'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE.
OUR APPROVAL OF $700 BILLION 
THIS YEAR, AND $716 BILLION NEXT
YEAR LARGELY DUE TO THE HELP OF 
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WITH ME 
TODAY AND STANDING RIGHT HERE, 
WE APPRECIATE.
BUT WE HAD TO DO THAT FOR OUR 
MILITARY, AND WE HAVE DONE IT 
AND HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL 
WORK OUT WELL WITH NORTH KOREA, 
AND A LOT OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT PERHAPS 
AND WE WOULD WAIT, IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT THE EXISTING SUMMIT COULD 
TAKE PLACE OR A SUMMIT AT SOME 
LATER DATE.
NOBODY SHOULD BE ANXIOUS.
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT.
OKAY.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE 
SOMETHING ELSE WHICH I HAVE TO 
TELL YOU, ALL OF YOU CHAIRMEN, 
MIKE AND EVERYBODY.
THAT WAS A BIG DEAL UNTIL THIS 
CAME UP.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE'S MIKE?
WHERE ARE YOU?
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB, BUT IT 
DOESN'T SEEM SO IMPORTANT NOW.
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT.
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE TODAY ANNOUNCING WHY HE 
DECIDED TO CALL OFF HIS SUMMIT, 
THE JUNE 12th SUMMIT, IN 
SINGAPORE WITH NORTH KOREA'S KIM
JONG-UN.
ALSO TALKING TOUGH, TELLING KIM 
JONG-UN THE MILITARY IS READY.
THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS 
READY, AND THAT A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLY LIES AHEAD 
POTENTIALLY, AND ALSO SAYING WE 
ARE MORE READY THAN WE HAVE EVER
BEEN, TALKING ABOUT THE 
MILITARY.
THIS IS FROM THE LETTER HE SENT 
KIM JONG-UN EARLIER TODAY.
HE SAID, SADLY BASED ON THE 
TREMENDOUS ANGER AND OPEN 
HOSTILITY DISPLAYED IN YOUR MOST
RECENT STATEMENT, I FEEL IT IS 
INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO 
HAVE THIS LONG-PLANNED MEETING 
CANCELED.
I WANT TO GO TO CECILIA VEGA, 
AND WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS WHIPLASH
JUST TODAY, THIS MORNING ON FOX 
NEWS.
WE HEARD AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS 
TAPED YESTERDAY WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT SIGNALED THE MEETING 
WAS STILL ON, AND AT 9:45, THE 
BREAKING NEWS THE MEETING WAS 
OFF.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> Reporter: IN SOME WAYS, TOM, 
THIS WAS NO SURPRISE.
THEY HAVE BEEN ON SHAKY GROUND 
ABOUT THIS MEETING FOR A COUPLE 
OF WEEKS NOW, AND THE PRESIDENT 
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AS YOU JUST
LAID OUT, HAS BEEN BACK AND 
FORTH ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS 
MEETING WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE 
PLACE.
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HAPPY WITH 
THE LANGUAGE THAT NORTH KOREA 
USED, CALLING VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE RECENTLY IGNORANT AND 
STUPID.
HE CALLED HIM A POLITICAL DUMMY 
FOR THESE COMMENTS THAT THE VICE
PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN TO KIM JONG-UN.
ESSENTIALLILYY SAYING IF HE DOET
MAKE A MOVE WITH THE U.S., HE 
MIGHT END UP DEAD.
THERE WAS ANGER TAKEN TO THAT, 
AND THE MESSAGE COMING FROM 
NORTH KOREA, BUT LET'S GO BACK 
TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST 
SAID RIGHT HERE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
THIS WAS NOT JUST STRONG 
LANGUAGE.
THIS WILL BE INTERPRETED I THINK
BY MANY IN THE CITY AND PERHAPS 
AROUND THE WORLD AS PERHAPS A 
THREAT.
MEETING NORTH KOREA WITH ITS OWN
RHETORIC ABOUT MILITARY USE, 
SAYING THAT HE SPOKE TO GENERAL 
MATTIS, THE DEFENSE SECRETARY, 
AND THE JOINT CHIEFS TODAY.
BY FAR, HE IS SAYING THAT OUR 
MILITARY IS BY FAR THE MOST 
POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
QUOTE, THEY ARE READY SHOULD 
FOOLISH OR RECKLESS ACTS BE 
TAKEN.
THAT IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE, 
AND WE WILL WAIT TO SEE HOW 
NORTH KOREA REACTS TO THAT.
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DID SAY THAT THERE WAS POTENTIAL
FOR A MEETING TO STILL HAPPEN, 
BUT TOM, I HAVE GOT TO SAY, I 
THINK UNIFORMLY HERE IN THIS 
TOWN, THE SENTIMENT IS 
QUESTIONABLE AT TO WHETHER THAT 
WILL ACTUALLY GO FORWARD.
>> SO TRUE, CECILIA.
I WANT TO BRING IN TERRY MORAN, 
OUR CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.
WHAT SET THEM OFF APPARENTLY WAS
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
MENTIONING THE LIBYAN MODEL.
JOHN BOLTON DID, AND NORTH 
KOREA'S RESPONSE WAS A, QUOTE, 
NUCLEAR TO NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN IF 
WE DON'T HAVE A MEETING AND ALSO
CALLING MIKE PENCE A POLITICAL 
DUMMY.
WHY WAS THAT SUCH A RED FLAG FOR
THE NORTH KOREANS?
>> Reporter: WELL, BOTH VICE 
PRESIDENT PENCE AND NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON 
RAISED THE LIBYA MODEL AS THE 
TEMPLATE FOR THE NORTH KOREA 
DEAL.
THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC 
BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING.
GADDAFI GAVE UP HIS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS AND IT WAS IN THE 
PROCESS.
UNTIL 2003, HE GAVE IT ALL UP 
AFTER SEEING THE UNITED STATES 
SWEEP THROUGH IRAQ.
HE WAS WORRIED AND EIGHT YEARS 
LATER, HE ENDED UP OVERTHROWN, 
DRAGGED FROM A DRAINAGE DITCH, 
BEATEN BY A MOB AND SHOT.
AND ESSENTIALLY PENCE AND BOLTON
ARE SAYING, YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
THAT DEAL, AND THAT ALARMED THE 
NORTH KOREAN REGIME, AND KIM WAS
INSULTED BY IT AND SO THE 
RHETORIC WENT UP, AND THEY WENT 
BACK TO SQUARE ONE.
WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.
NORTH KOREA IN THE PAST HAS 
DISD
DISMANTLED NUCLEAR FACILITIES AS
THEY CUT A DEAL WITH AMERICAN 
PRESIDENTS AND THEY HAVE GONE 
BACK AS SOON AS THEY GET THE WAR
TALK BACKED OFF SOME, AND SOME 
BREATHING ROOM.
A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CHINA.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT KIM 
JONG-UN HAS LEARNED FROM HIS 
FATHER, AND CLEARLY IT WAS THE 
TRIGGER OF WHAT VICE PRESIDENT 
PENCE SAID ABOUT LIBYA, BUT HE 
WAS ALSO NEVER CLEAR ABOUT WHAT 
DE-NUCLEARIZATION ACTUALLY 
MEANT.
WOULD HE ACTUALLY GIVE UP ALL OF
HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS?
THAT REMAINS THE KEY QUESTION 
FOR HIM AND FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
IF HE WANTS A DEAL, WILL HE LIVE
WITH SOMETHING SHORT OF 
COMPLETE, IRREVERSIBLE, 
DE-NUCLE
DE-NUCLEARIZATION. 
>> THANK YOU.
JUST TO RECAP.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CANCELED THE
JUNE 12th SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE 
WITH NORTH KOREA.
SAYING NOW IS NOT A TIME TO BE 
ANXIOUS, BUT OUR MILITARY IS 
READY.
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THIS 
WITH REALTIME UPDATES ON 
ABCNEWS.COM, AND A FULL WRAP-UP 
ON "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."
I'M TOM LLAMAS IN NEW YORK.
WE NOW RETURN TO REGULARLY 
SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING.
>> Announcer: THIS HAS BEEN A 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
