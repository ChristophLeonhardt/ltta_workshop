I received an angry email after that show and it is a show especially not with the globe after that show on Friday I received an 8 well I received several angry emails as per usual but this one a particular gave voice to a to a common objection and this person said that my position and the position of any any advocate for immigration enforcement that position lacks compassion and we need to have compassion for illegal immigrants it's important to be compassionate the government has to be compassionate we need we need to have compassionate laws and to be compassionate to these people compassion is I'm sure you've noticed one of the most overused misused abused words in the English language so I want to talk about compassion and I think we should begin by defining compassion and so I went to I went to the dictionary to do that but before we get to the definite to the definition here's my here's my basic position on compassion I don't want the government to be compassionate towards illegal immigrants I don't want compassionate laws I don't want compassionate policies I don't want a compassionate government doing compassionate things and the word compassionate and all those previous sentences just imagine the the scare quotes around it I think that any any law or policy or government action that's justified on the basis of compassion like say welfare for instance is always in the end a bad thing and it's always in the end something that does more harm than good so no I don't want compassion when someone says well don't want you don't want the government to be compassionate towards illegals no actually I don't I think compassion is great compassion is not just great it's it's necessary it is required but I don't want the government to be compassionate I don't think the government can be compassionate
