1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:00,986
TAMMY IS WITH US TONIGHT TO

2
00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:03,322
WEIGH IN ON THE RISING RAGE OF

3
00:00:03,322 --> 00:00:05,424
IMMIGRATION AND HOW IT IS

4
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:06,158
SHIFTING ATTENTION FOR THEIR WAY

5
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:07,293
FROM POLICY AND RESOLUTION.

6
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,828
FIRST, MY TAKE.

7
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:10,596
IMMIGRATION WILL ALWAYS BE AN

8
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:14,166
EMOTIONAL ISSUE.

9
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:14,600
IT IS FOR ME.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,334
MY PARENTS WERE REFUGEES FROM

11
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:20,139
COMMUNISM AND HUNGRY.

12
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:20,839
I AM AN IMMIGRANT HERE IN

13
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:21,173
AMERICA.

14
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:22,007
I HAVE BEEN DETAINED AT THE U.S.

15
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:24,276
BORDER BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM WITH

16
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:24,710
MY DOCUMENTS.

17
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,311
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST

18
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:27,479
FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCES OF MY

19
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:27,780
LIFE.

20
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,514
WORSE THAN THAT, ANOTHER TIME

21
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:30,082
OUR FAMILY WAS DETAINED WHEN MY

22
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:34,186
ELDEST SON SEPARATED.

23
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:34,720
THAT WAS 25 MINUTES.

24
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,923
AGAIN WITH ALL OUR ADVANTAGES

25
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:38,724
THIS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT

26
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:39,858
OTHERS ARE GOING THROUGH.

27
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:43,062
WE REMEMBER THAT TRAUMA TODAY.

28
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:47,666
THE WAY TO MAKE SURE WE TREAT

29
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:52,838
EVERYONE HUMANELY IS NOT

30
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:53,572
YELLING, SCREAMING, AND CALLING

31
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:54,139
PEOPLE NAZIS, IT IS

32
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:54,840
WELL-DESIGNED AND COMPETENTLY

33
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,307
EXECUTED POLICY.

34
00:00:55,307 --> 00:01:00,546
LET'S APPLY SOME LOGIC.

35
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:01,380
THE EMERGING VIEW ON THE LEFT IS

36
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,181
THAT MOST HUMANE POLICY IS JUST

37
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:02,915
TO SAY YES TO EVERYONE AT THE

38
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:03,248
BORDER.

39
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:10,422
THEY ARE FLEEING VIOLENCE AND

40
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:11,190
LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE, LET

41
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,523
THEM IN.

42
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:12,224
HOW HUMANE IS THAT, REALLY?

43
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:12,992
IT PRIVILEGES THOSE WHO ACTUALLY

44
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:14,360
GET TO THE BORDER.

45
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,060
THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

46
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,728
THERE ARE OVER 60 MILLION

47
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:20,099
REFUGEES ACROSS THE WORLD.

48
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:20,766
THAT NUMBER WILL INCREASE.

49
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,500
A HUMANE IMMIGRATION WERE NOT

50
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,234
JUST TAKE THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO

51
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,603
SHOW UP.

52
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:25,304
IT WOULD TAKE THOSE IN MOST

53
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:25,604
NEED.

54
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,438
WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY GET HERE?

55
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:34,446
THERE ARE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES.

56
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,147
AS BERNIE SANDERS SAID, OPEN

57
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:35,914
BORDERS WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY IN

58
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:36,348
AMERICA POOR.

59
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,516
DOING AWAY WITH THE CONCEPT OF

60
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:38,784
THE NATIONSTATE AND BRING IN

61
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:39,118
PEOPLE.

62
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:39,985
THEY WILL WORK FOR TWO OR $3 AN

63
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:47,626
HOUR, I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT.

64
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:48,494
WE HAVE TO RAISE WAGES IN THIS

65
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:48,827
COUNTRY.

66
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:49,561
THERE ARE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES

67
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:49,828
TWO.

68
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:50,529
BARACK OBAMA TALKED ABOUT HIS

69
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,263
QUOTE PATRIOTIC RESENTMENT OF

70
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:55,734
SEEING MEXICAN FLAGS AT

71
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,202
IMMIGRANT RALLIES.

72
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:01,740
WHEN FORCED TO USE A TRANSLATOR

73
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,546
TO TALK TO A GUY FIXING MY CAR,

74
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:08,514
I FEEL CERTAIN FRUSTRATION.

75
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,281
OPEN BORDERS NEED MORE PRESSURES

76
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:18,624
ON SERVICES LIKE SCHOOLS AND

77
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:18,991
HOSPITALS.

78
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:19,692
DIANE FEINSTEIN ONCE RAISED

79
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:20,426
ABOUT THE HEALTH BUDGET BEING

80
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:21,126
SPENT ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

81
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:21,427
BABY.

82
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:21,927
WHAT ABOUT CRIME?

83
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:22,728
IF WE WAIVED EVERYONE THROUGH ON

84
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:23,495
HUMANITARIAN GRANT, WE CAN ARGUE

85
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:24,229
ABOUT THE EXACT PROPORTION WHO

86
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,963
WOULD END UP COMMITTED VIOLENT

87
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:25,297
CRIMES.

88
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:27,900
NOBODY CAN SAY THAT NONE WOULD.

89
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,667
JUST AS CAKES FAMILY ABOUT THE

90
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:32,504
HUMANITY OF THAT.

91
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:33,272
THEN, WHAT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE

92
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:36,341
OF IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES.

93
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:45,284
THEY ARGUED WE NOW HAVE AN

94
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:45,951
IMMIGRATION CRISIS IN AN

95
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:46,485
INTEGRATION CRISIS.

96
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:47,186
TEN OR 20 YEARS AFTER COMING

97
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,188
HERE, IMMIGRANTS ARE LIVING IN

98
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:50,689
POVERTY.

99
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,457
HIS WORDS ARE RACIALIZED INSTEAD

100
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:52,191
OF LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM.

101
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:56,328
HOW IS THAT HUMANE?

102
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:57,029
LOGIC TELLS US YOU HAVE TO

103
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:59,364
CONTROL IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM

104
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,265
SOMEHOW.

105
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,033
THE MINUTE YOU ACCEPT THAT, YOU

106
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,836
GET INTO THE REALLY TOUGH

107
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:04,603
QUESTION, WHO SHOULD WE WELCOME

108
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,438
AND WHO SHOULD WE TURN AWAY?

109
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:10,275
TURNING ANYONE AWAY IS HARD.

110
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,110
AS WE HAVE SEEN, FEELING TO DO

111
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,079
SO IS INHUMANE AS WELL.

112
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:14,847
THE REASON EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING

113
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:18,083
HIGH OVER IMMIGRATION IS THAT

114
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:18,817
SUCCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIONS LOST

115
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:20,219
CONTROL OF IT.

116
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,355
AMERICA IS AN OPENING COUNTRY.

117
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,691
BUT THE PUBLIC CONSENT DEPENDS

118
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,960
ON GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF

119
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,863
IMMIGRATION.

120
00:03:30,863 --> 00:03:31,597
THAT'S WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION

121
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:32,364
IS RIGHT TO TRY AND IMPOSE ORDER

122
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,298
AT THE BORDER.

123
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:37,136
BUT, THE WAY THEY DID IT,

124
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,704
FRANKLY, WAS SHAMBOLIC.

125
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:43,442
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED A NEW

126
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:44,076
POLICY THAT WAS RIGHT AND

127
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:44,409
POPULAR.

128
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,445
ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ILLEGAL

129
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:50,115
IMMIGRATION.

130
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:50,816
HOW COULD ANYONE, ESPECIALLY

131
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:51,450
DEMOCRATS AND NEVER TRUMP

132
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,151
REPUBLICANS WERE CONSTANTLY

133
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,486
SCREAMING ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP

134
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:55,254
UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW BE

135
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:58,757
AGAINST ZERO-TOLERANCE AND

136
00:03:58,757 --> 00:03:59,324
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

137
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,227
BUT, THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE

138
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:06,765
POLICY ARISING FROM THIS IS ON

139
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:11,470
POPULAR.

140
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,970
FAMILY SEPARATION.

141
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,638
IT COULD IT SHOULD'VE BEEN

142
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:13,005
PREDICTED.

143
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:13,539
A PLAN FOR BY THE

144
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,006
ADMINISTRATION.

145
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,208
HERE'S JOHN KELLY OVER A YEAR

146
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,344
AGO WHEN HE WAS STILL HOMELAND

147
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:19,945
SECURITY SECRETARY.

148
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:20,779
>> ARE YOU, THE DEPARTMENT OF

149
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,749
HOMELAND SECURITY CONSIDERING A

150
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:25,884
NEW INITIATIVE THAT WOULD

151
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:29,688
SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR

152
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:30,489
PARENTS IF THEY TRIED TO ENTER

153
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:32,558
THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY?

154
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:35,427
>> I WOULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO

155
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:37,729
DETER THE PEOPLE FROM CENTRAL

156
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,101
AMERICA TO GETTING ON THIS VERY

157
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:46,004
DANGEROUS NETWORK THAT BRINGS

158
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:46,772
THEM UP THROUGH MEXICO AND INTO

159
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:47,306
THE UNITED STATES.

160
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,408
YES, I AM CONSIDERING IN ORDER

161
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,108
TO DETER MORE MOVEMENT ALONG

162
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:55,314
THIS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS NETWORK.

163
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:56,048
I AM CONSIDERING EXACTLY THAT.

164
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:56,815
THEY WILL BE WELL CARED FOR AS

165
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:58,417
WE DEAL THEIR PARENTS.

166
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:09,561
>> I HATE THE ANTI- TRUMP

167
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:10,262
PREMIUM AS MUCH AS ANYONE.

168
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,029
I AM DISGUSTED THE WAY THEY PLAY

169
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,730
POLITICS WITH THIS ISSUE TO

170
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,264
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

171
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:12,965
THE FACT REMAINS THAT THIS

172
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,666
DEMONSTRATION IS IN CHARGE, NOW.

173
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,400
JOHN KELLY OF PARTICULAR NEEDS

174
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,840
TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER.

175
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:22,674
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.

176
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:23,308
WE NEED A BIG GOVERNMENT

177
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,142
RESPONSE AND IS THE CHIEF OF

178
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:24,843
STAFF'S JOB TO ORGANIZE IT.

179
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:25,611
AT THE HEART SHOULD BE SOMETHING

180
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:27,813
THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS ABOUT.

181
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:28,580
DONALD TRUMP IS A BUILDER, LET'S

182
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,853
GET BUILDING.

183
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:35,554
ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION CENTERS

184
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,321
IN GUATEMALA, HONDURAS AND OTHER

185
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,055
PLACES SO THERE'S NO NEED TO

186
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:40,559
COME TO THE BORDER.

187
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,326
FOR THOSE WHO COME BILL PROPER

188
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:41,994
FACILITY SO PEOPLE CAN BE

189
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:42,694
HANDLED QUICKLY, FIRMLY, AND

190
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:43,061
HUMANELY.

191
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,364
BUILD THE WALL TO STOP THE
