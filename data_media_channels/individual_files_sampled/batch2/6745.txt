OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF THREATS FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY THE FLOODING, PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL IN HOUSTON AND SURROUNDING AREAS, BUT THE WATER HOLD THREATS OF ITS OWN, NOT JUST FROM THE AMOUNT OF IT BUT WHAT IS IN IT. THERE ARE THINGS YOU MIGHT KNOW ALREADY THOSE SORTS OF PROBLEMS AREN'T GOING TO SIMPLY GO AWAY ONCE THE RAIN GOES AWAY. THERE WILL BE STANDING WATER IN AREAS WHERE IT IS NORMALLY THEREFORE LITERALLY MONTHS GOING FORWARD, MOLDS WILL GROW FOUR YEARS GOING FORWARD. THAT'S A REAL THREAT AND IT'S BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY, BUT THERE ARE SOME NEW THREATS PARTICULAR TO THIS AREA AND THIS STORM, IT HAS TO DO WITH TOXIC CHEMICALS AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS THAT AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE WATER NOW BEING FLOODED INTO IT THOSE ARE SOME TOXINS THAT I WON'T TRY TO PRONOUNCE BUT THAT WILL THEORETICALLY BE LEACHED OR DUMPED INTO THE WATER AND TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE WATER, THROUGH WHAT BECOME TOXIC RIVERS DOWN THE MAIN STREETS OF HOUSTON, AND ONCE THE WATER FINALLY GOES AWAY, THOSE CHEMICALS, THOSE TOXINS, CAN THEN SETTLE IN AREAS WHERE YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THEM. YOU ARE LOOKING POSSIBLY AT BALL FIELDS AND PARKS, PLACES WHERE KIDS CONGREGATE, IN STORES, IN PEOPLE'S HOMES, THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AFTER THIS STORM. NOW BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MANY SITES, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AREAS THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE MUCH OF A WARNING BEFORE THE STORM HIT, SO I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY, THE THREAT THAT OF VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS AND TOXINS COULD EVEN NOW BE BEING TRANSPORTED AROUND HOUSTON AND OTHER CITIES IN TEXAS AND SOON LOUISIANA. MORE BAD NEWS. JUST IN JULY WE HAD THE FIRST CASE OF ZIKA VIRUS IN THE HOUSTON AREA. NOW WITH MOSQUITO BORNE ILLNESSES THAT COULD BE RAMPANT IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, THE THREAT OF THE ZIKA VIRUS IS GREATLY MULTIPLIED IN THE HOUSTON AREA. FURTHERMORE LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE, VERY DANGEROUS, THAT YOU CAN GET FROM INHALATION OF AIRBORNE MOISTURE DROPLETS. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO DRINK THE TAP WATER, IT'S AIRBORNE, THAT'S POTENTIALLY DEADLY. THERE'S A GREAT IRONY HERE, WHICH IS THAT THE MORE WATER YOU HAVE, THE LESS USABLE WATER YOU HAVE. THE AREAS WHERE THEY GET THE TAP WATER, THE CLEAN WATER, GET FLOODED BY THE DIRTY WATER, THEN YOU CAN'T USE THE TAP WATER. ON TOP OF ALL THE HUMAN DAMAGE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE, 30 PEOPLE KILLED AT LEAST SO FAR, 30,000 OR MORE DISPLACED, WELL, YOU NOW HAVE A SITUATION WHERE ALL THE LOCAL RESIDENTS, NOT JUST IN THE AFFECTED AREAS BUT THE ONES THAT DRINK THAT WATER FROM THE TAP, HAVE TO BOIL ALL THE WATER AND THEN USE IT FOR OR JUST GET DRINKING WATER THAT IS BOTTLED IT IS A NIGHTMARE. THINK ABOUT HOW YOU TAKE SHOWERS, HOW YOUR KIDS BRUSH THEIR TEETH, ALL THE WAYS THESE PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED, AND THEN THE MOLD SETS IN WHERE THE FLOOD HAS HIT, THAT CAN LAST FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND HAVE MORE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE FOR HOUSTON. IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY SENDING BOTH MONEY BUT ALSO THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED THAT ARE STILL STUCK THERE, PEOPLE IN TEMPORARY HOUSING OUTSIDE OF IT, I SAW EARLIER TODAY SHAUN KING WAS HELPING TO ORGANIZE THAT BY SPREADING A LIST OF THINGS THAT WERE NEEDED, THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT NORMALLY THINK OF, AND THAT'S GREAT BUT PEOPLE NEED TO BUCKLE UP FOR THE LONG HAUL BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO LEFT AREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO HOME IN THE END, EVEN ONCE THE WATER GOES AWAY THEIR APARTMENTS WILL BE UNINHABITABLE, MANY PEOPLE FIND THEY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE BUSINESSES WILL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, PEOPLE WILL NEED HELP IN THE NEAR AND MEDIUM TERM, NOT JUST NEXT WEEK. ONE MORE TIME, THIS IS NOT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN LATER. THIS IS CLIMATE CHANGE. IT JUST HAPPENED. IT HIT HOUSTON, AND IT HIT IT REALLY HARD. IT'S HITTING LOUISIANA TODAY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SCIENTISTS PREDICTED. WHETHER YOU WANT TO LOOK AT A POPULAR MOVIE LIKE AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, JUST GOOGLE IT, GO ONLINE, FIND ANY SCIENTISTS NOT FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, AND THEY WILL TELL YOU AND DON'T LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TODAY, LOOK AT WHAT THEY SAID A YEAR AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO. IN FACT, LOOK AT WHAT THE EXXON MOBIL SCIENTISTS SAID IN 1979, 1982, THAT'S A STORY WE COVERED LAST WEEK. TURNS OUT, THIS IS SOME GREAT INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING, THEY FOUND THE INTERNAL DOCUMENTS, THE EXXON SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S GOING TO BE CATASTROPHIC, AND EXXON BURIED ALL THAT RESEARCH. WHY? BECAUSE IN THE SHORT TERM THEY WANTED TO MAKE THE MONEY AND PUT THE COST ON YOU. AMERICA, THESE ARE THE COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THESE ARE THE CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST.
