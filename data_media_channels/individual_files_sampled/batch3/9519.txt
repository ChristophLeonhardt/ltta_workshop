Greg: NEW YORK STATE JUDGE ORDERED A 30-YEAR-OLD MAN TO CLEAR OUT OF HIS PARENTS HOUSE. MICHAEL ROTONDO DIDN'T PAY RENT OR DO CHORES. BASICALLY HE IS A TINY VERSION OF CONGRESS. HE WAS SUED BY MOM AND DAD AFTER HE REFUSED TO LEAVE. SELF-EMPLOYED BUSINESSMAN, THE PARENTS HAVE YET TO SEE ANY OF MICHAEL'S SECRET SOURCE OF INCOME. I AM BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT THAT IS. HIS PARENTS HOME WAS ACTUALLY A SANCTUARY CITY. AND HE REAPS THE BENEFITS, APPARENTLY THINKING EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FREE. HE ALMOST QUALIFIES AS A COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER OR AT LEAST A VERMONT SENATOR. AFTER A PILE OF IGNORED EVICTION LETTER SOME OF THE JUDGE RULED FOR MOM-AND-POP. BEING GOOD PARENTS, THEY OFFERED HIM MONEY TO HELP THEM FIND A PLACE TO STAY AND FIX HIS CAR. THEY ALSO GAVE HIM SOUND ADVICE, INCLUDING "ORGANIZE THE THINGS YOU NEED FOR WORK AND MANAGE AN APARTMENT. "AND "THERE WILL BE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE." THERE ARE JOBS AVAILABLE EVEN FOR THOSE WITH A POOR WORK HISTORY LIKE YOU. GET ONE. YOU HAVE TO WORK. TRANSLATION: GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE. NOW EVICTED, HE DID SEE HIS PARENTS AFTER THE RULING AND SAID IT WAS PRETTY AWKWARD PRINT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE COME HE COULD ALWAYS MOVE INTO A STARBUCKS. Kimberly: THIS IS THE PROBLEM. THIS IS WHY I'M GOING TO DUNKIN' DONUTS. Greg: KIMBERLY, THIS GUY'S ALL OVER THE NEWS. HE'S GOING TO BE ON MARTHA MacCALLUM TONIGHT. I MOVED IN WITH MY MOM WHEN I WAS 23. I SAVED FOR A YEAR. I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. THIS KID IS PUSHING IT. Kimberly: HE IS PUSHING IT. DIDN'T HE GO BACK TO THEIR HOUSE AFTER THE JUDGE TOLD HIM TO GET A LIFE AND GET A JOB. KNOCK, KNOCK. HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO FIND SOME POOR UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL TAKE HIM IN. HE'S GOT HIS 15 MINUTES OF FAME. PEOPLE TAKING SELFIES WITH THIS GUY. WHEN THAT PASSES OVER COME I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO DO. PROBABLY MOVE BACK IN WITH HIS PARENTS. WHAT KIND OF SELF-RESPECT DOES HE HAVE? HIS PARENTS ARE SO SWEET. Dana: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET A GIRL? Kimberly: HE GOT ONE FOR A SECOND, I GUESS. Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS, MOVEMENT AND BECOME A BUTLER. BECOME SOMEONE'S BUTLER. BUT A BAD ONE, A LAZY ONE. Richard: I THINK THE WORD MILLENNIAL IN THE SCREEN BEHIND ME. Dana: THAT BOTHERS YOU? Richard: I PACKED UP AND WENT TO COLLEGE AND 18. I WAS LIKE MOM, I AM NEVER COMING BACK HOME. YOU COULD ALWAYS COME HOME. NO, I'M GOING TO GET A JOB AND WORK AND THAT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS DID AND WE ARE DOING GREAT AND WE ARE ALL MILLENNIAL. THEY WORK AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN APARTMENTS AND THEY DON'T LIVE AT HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS AND THEY PAY RENT. Greg: THIS IS ON AN EARLIER SHOW, ON THEIR NETWORK, I CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME OF IT. DO YOU NOT WANT TO FIND YOUR OWN PLACE? NO. WHY NOT? I DON'T WANT TO LIVE THERE ANYMORE. YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH YOUR PARENTS? NO. WHY DON'T YOU MOVE OUT TOMORROW? I DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO DO THAT TOMORROW. DO YOU HAVE A JOB? NO. DON'T YOU WANT TO RECONCILE? NO. Dana: I KIND OF FEEL BAD. I FEEL BAD FOR EVERYBODY. Greg: YOU DO. HE IS DOING THE TV. HE COULD HAVE MOVED OUT. HE Dana: I THINK THE LURE OF BEING ON TV, I WILL GO INTO THE INTO MY STORY. EVERYBODY, I'M SURE MARTHA MacCALLUM WILL BE ABLE TO GET MORE OUT OF HIM. Pete: HE IS BAD AT BEING A DEADBEAT. HE WANT TO STAY AT YOUR PARENTS HOUSE FOREVER? MAKE THEM DINNER ONCE IN A WHILE. DO SOME CHORES. DO A COUPLE CHORES. THEN THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER YEAR. INSTEAD HE IS LIKE, I WILL DO NOTHING. YOU WILL HAVE TO EVICT ME. Dana: IT'S A WEIRD THING HAVING TO GO TO COURT. Kimberly: WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL THE COPS? THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO. Dana: RONAN COMES HOME, IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN ARMS. Greg: I'M GOING TO DEFEND HIM AND SAY BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING LONGER, 31 IS THE NEW 13. Dana: I AGREE. Richard: I AM 31 AND I AM NOT 13. Greg: I BEG TO DIFFER. LIVING LONGER. YOU CAN STAY LONGER AT HOME. Dana: IT'S A GOOD POINT. WHAT IS THE ACCEPTABLE AGE? LET'S SAY IT'S 25. KIDS SHOULD BE ON THEIR PARENT'S HEALTH INSURANCE UNTIL 25. I DON'T SAY THAT BUT THE LAW SAYS THAT. 26. 30. MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT. Greg: I AM FOR CLOSE FAMILIES, MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILIES. ALL RIGHT, OKAY, THEY ARE
