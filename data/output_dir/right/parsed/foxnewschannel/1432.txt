MR. TRUMP IN ON ANYTHING UNTIL
HE WAS ELECTED, THEN THEY
DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT THE DOSSIER BECAUSE IT
WOULD BE DANGEROUS IF HE DIDN'T.
IS COMING UNDER FIRE BY SEVERAL
DEMOCRATS FOR CRITICIZING THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
HE WROTE AN OP-ED THIS WEEK
ENTITLED "STOPPING ROBERT
MUELLER TO PROTECT US ALL."
HE SAID THIS WHOLE THING WAS
BORN OUT OF QUOTE HYSTERIA.
AND NOW, NBC'S JOE SCARBOROUGH
IS VERY FIRED UP AND ANGRY ABOUT
THAT AND QUESTIONING MR. PENN'S
INTEGRITY.
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS MARK PENN
SELLING?
DOES HE HAVE A FOX NEWS
CONTRACT?
IS HE WRITING FOR A CONSERVATIVE
WEBSITE?
I WANT TO KNOW, OFTEN IN
WASHINGTON, D.C., WHEN PEOPLE DO
STRANGE THINGS LIKE THIS,
CREATURES OF THE SWAMP, THEY ARE
DOING IT FOR A REASON.
>> Martha: HERE NOW TO DEFEND
HIMSELF IS MARK PENN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
ARE YOU GETTING PAID BY
FOX NEWS?
NOT THAT THAT'S A BAD THING,
LOTS OF UPSTANDING INDIVIDUALS
GET PAID BY FOX NEWS.
ARE YOU UNDER CONTRACT?
>> IT WAS A TAX ON ME WHEN I WAS
IN POLITICAL LIGHT, HAVING A FOX
CONTRACT.
NO, I'M NOT BEING PAID BY FOX IN
ANY WAY.
>> Martha: SO JOE SCARBOROUGH,
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU
WORKED WITH ON THE CLINTON
CAMPAIGN.
THEY THINK THEY'RE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU.
SPEAK OUT THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOT
THERE IN 98.
WHERE THERE WHITE HOUSE WAS
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AT PEOPLE'S
LIVES WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN,
AND MY INTEREST HERE WAS A GOOD
GOVERNMENT AND BETTER POLITICS.
TAKING THE CRIMINALIZATION
UNLESS YOU REALLY HAVE THE
FIRMEST OF EVIDENCE, WHICH
CERTAINLY THIS INVESTIGATION
DIDN'T HAVE.
I THINK IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO
START TO QUESTION THIS
INVESTIGATION AFTER YOU LOOK AT
THE STRUCK PAGE TEXT.
I MEAN, THAT ALONE BLEW THIS
THING OPEN.
ONCE THIS REPORT COMES FROM THE
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL --
>> Martha: BUT THEY ALSO SAY,
BIG DEAL.
THEY CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENT.
THEY CANNOT LIKE THE PRESIDENT
AND STILL DO THEIR JOB.
>> THAT INSURANCE INSURANCE
POLICY REALLY SUGGESTED
SOMETHING ELSE WAS GOING ON.
NOW YOU HAVE THE INVESTIGATION
GOING ON BY THE IGS OF THE DOJ.
THAT COULD BLOW THE WHOLE THING
WIDE OPEN.
NOW IF THAT REPORT IS SOFT, I
COULD TAKE BACK SOME OF MY
OPINIONS.
BUT MY OPINIONS ARE BASED ON THE
EXPERIENCE I HAVE AND A FAIR
READING OF THE EVIDENCE THAT'S
COME OUT HERE WHICH RAISES THE
QUESTIONS, WHEN DID IT GET
STARTED, HOW DID THEY CREATE THE
POWERS TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT
WITHIN A GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL, CONGRESS OR
THE PRESIDENT?
>> Martha: THE MUELLER REPORT
IS NOT OUT YET, THE IG REPORT IS
NOT OUT YET, AND CONCLUSIONS
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DRAWN.
THEY KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS,
THEY DECIDED WHAT THE OUTCOME IS
ON THIS, AND THE PROBLEM WITH
MARK PENN SPOUTING THIS STUFF IS
THAT SOME DEMOCRAT WILL LOOK AT
HIM AND SAY, HE'S A DEMOCRAT.
AND YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID IS SO SCARY
ABOUT THIS.
>> I'M SURE HE WISHES MORE
REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY, THIS IS
WRONG.
WE SHOULDN'T BE DISRUPTING THE
COUNTRY FOR THIS.
I WANT MORE DEMOCRATS TO GO OUT
AND SAY THAT NOW.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM REALLY
SERIOUSLY EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY,
AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE
LIVED THROUGH 1998 AND SO MANY
PEOPLE GET SWEPT UP IN IT.
THESE YOUNG STAFFERS PAYING
THEIR LEGAL BILLS, IT MAKES THEM
NEVER WANT TO WORK IN POLITICS
AGAIN.
>> I AM GLAD TO SEE PEOPLE COME
UP TO ME AND SAY, THEY REALLY
ENJOY READING BOTH SIDES OF
THIS.
I SEE PEOPLE HAVING DEBATES
WITHIN FAMILIES.
VERY TOUCHING LETTERS FROM
PEOPLE WHO WENT TO JAIL BASED ON
PREVIOUS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
INVESTIGATIONS WHO APPRECIATE AN
HONEST PERSPECTIVE ON THIS.
>> Martha: WHILE WE WILL TRY
TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
