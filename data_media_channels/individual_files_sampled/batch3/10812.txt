hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report a high colonic for your mind Stacy max you know one thing we have been talking about quite often over the past few years is the fact that we have these Oleg ah police and monopolies in the US for example advertising online something like ninety five percent of all new advertising online advertising went to either Facebook or Google so that competition is not there's not much competition in the US now a lot of the new oleg ah police and you know monopolies online are tend to be silicon valley-based California Democrats so under the Obama administration there was definitely no pushback against many argued that there were you know antitrust legislation could be used against some of the situation emerging they're certainly Amazon is a something to look at but the Louisiana Attorney General is now saying he wants to break up Google and Facebook Wow so this comes from Matt Stoller who of course we often referred to his tweets here because he covers this sort of antitrust and anti-competitive monopolistic behavior Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry would like to see Google Facebook and other major social media behemoths broken up like the federal government did to Standard Oil more than a century ago Landry says that Internet giant's are suppressing conservative agendas stifling competition and infringing on antitrust laws also let's take a look at the breaking up of Ma Bell in the early 1980s into the constituent seven baby bells yes now one thing about the baby Bell spinoff from ma Bell is that the stocks if you put them back and reconstruct them I think they've doubled tripled quadrupled so if they break up these companies look for the stock prices to double and triple I would say because right now they are probably trading at a discount to some kind of breakup but having said that so the idea that they're stifling conservative voices are conservative Genesis they have too much power in the public marketplace of ideas is certainly worth considering I think probably what would be better is to encourage more competition and you would encourage more competition by getting rid of net neutrality or the net neutrality bill however they position that bill by trying to thwart competition or they could get rid of that law that brought money into politics in a big way just a few years ago during the last election yeah citizens united citizens united like those types of laws that stifled free speech and for stifled competition in a huge way get rid of those laws first and you'd bring in more competition that's an easier way than trying to doing something here which is impossible because the managers of these companies own too many politicians breaking up Ma Bell did increase the market cap of all the seven same with Standard Oil by the way Standard Oil was broken up and that is Exxon Chevron mo amico which then became part of British Petroleum so as you can see they're huge monopolistic sort of you know certainly mo mega multinationals still to this day but in terms of having some choice and competition online it seems quite clear that our public square as we have said is Twitter and Facebook everybody goes to those dominate the whole sector and you know if if the likes of Rachel Maddow demand that all right wing voices that those are fascists those are illegitimate their concerns about with their conservative agenda is something that should be banned then Twitter is obviously banning those people I mean I myself don't believe much of the conservative agenda certainly not on the social issues and I would particularly I mute them myself sometimes but you know I don't think a corporation should be assigned the right to you know block anybody from accessing this but nevertheless mass solar when he posted this tweet saying yay Louisiana Attorney General Republican going just met with Jeff Sessions the Attorney General of the United States just a few days ago there they're talking about looking into these media companies for on antitrust legislation he said a lot of angry liberals saying he's doing this for the wrong reasons okay fine but Democratic AG's aren't presenting the alternatives on how to do this correctly they are just supporting the status quo one of the issues that I really like to point out as we head into a mid term and of course the 2020 elections is that so many Democrats Hillary Clinton the chief amongst them remember she talked about single-payer health care as a pony that Bernie Sanders wants us but everybody wants a pony everybody would love a pony but how do you feed the pony how do you take care of the pony you can't you can't deliver these things well that's what happened in the 2016 election is she said you know we can't get we can't modify these trade deals we can't change TTIP or TPP and we can't listen to the concerns of those who are about to lose their job and the auto sector or the manufacturing sector because we have to move forward we have to keep on moving forward and everybody can't keep their job well here you know it should be a democratic platform that's progressive is to break up monopolies and you know Trust bust these things right but as we pointed out the Democrats are not socially liberal they are pro-war and so are the Republicans and the problem people have with Trump is that he's Pro piece and that's not acceptable in America today that runs except for against Iran well you know the talk talk is not walking the walk and you know you have to do what you have to do but he's not actively going down the path that Hillary Clinton clearly was going down I think that's why a people voted he against her now that you bring up war I want to turn to a headline that a skip forward to a headline because there is it in the past week just after the basically Congress passed the new budget so as deadline nears Senate approved 674 billion dollars defense budget bill with a fiscal year winding down Senate lawmakers on Tuesday advanced a multi-agency appropriations deal that would prevent a government shutdown and give the defense apartment its full-year budget on schedule for the first time in a decade so is actually an increase they gave him more than the Defense Department had wanted six hundred and seventy four billion dollars only seven senators voted against it well as six of those four Republicans and Bernie Sanders voted against it so all the Democrats were happy even though they say the commander in chief is a you know insane that there's something wrong with him that he's a threat to national security he just gave him six hundred and seventy four billion dollars for his army if depends how you spend that money I mean having in the bank and then spending it are two separate things but the the the initiatives that come out of the White House to scale back on the military in the Korean Peninsula scale back NATO and scale back America's involvement in Middle East politics suggests to me that they're prepping for massive defunding of military operations as is is inevitable inappropriate because there's no other way to address the debt the two Koreas look like they're gonna have peace and part of that peace deal is that the US has to get out essentially so that could save a lot of money sure six hundred seventy four billion dollars could be a lot if you target it towards the engineers and and people in Silicon Valley who pretend that they don't that they're all entrepreneurs and they've done it themselves but the national interest for security we're gonna rebuild roads and bridges in America from the Pentagon budget and you can do that and I expect that's what will happen in the second term of trumpet here again there's another story he touted right when he became president right around his inauguration Jack Ma the richest guy in China one of the richest guys in the world he said that he was gonna bring 1 million jobs to America because he was a you know it was a new era of you know more trade and globalization well Alibaba will no longer bring 1 million jobs to the US citing tariffs Alibaba is founder and chairman Jack Moss says the Chinese mega e-commerce company no longer has plans to create 1 million jobs in the US citing the ongoing trade conflict is the reason Alibaba is retracting his promise to Donald Trump and two terrorists between the US and China will make mutual trade more difficult Trump applying another two hundred billion dollars and of course China's retaliating but they have less and less to retaliate against because the US doesn't you know they they don't import much from the US Jack miles loss you know he had a chance to go to a low-cost producer in the US but he was obviously pressured from above and I was gonna pay more so good bully bully for Amazon bad for Alibaba well Jack Ma told Chinese state-run news outlet Xinhua that the promise was based on the assumption that the US and China would have rational trade relations which is no longer the case this promise was based on friendly us-china partnership and rational trade relations the current situation has already ruined that there is no way to complete the promise now but we won't stop working hard to promote the healthy development of china-us trade I think Apple was exempt from a lot of those tariffs even though all their products are made in China when I was talking about the US defense budget and that six hundred and seventy four billion dollars it made me think of how national priorities work and how you decide to spend as a nation in your your tax collection the government decides to spend their tax collection and I thought of about because six hundred and seventy four billion dollars is more than Medicare it's about Medicare and Medicaid combined a little bit less but I looked at the UK and the NHS budget there is a hundred and twenty four point seven billion pounds their defense budget is thirty five billion so what I'm saying is that in the u.s. imagine if they did the same as the UK three and a half times their defense budget they spend on their NHS so here in the u.s. that would be 2.2 trillion dollars that we would have Medicare for all essentially Medicaid if we decided to use the same sort of metrics as how the UK and the citizens there decide how to allocate their their funds but here in the US there's huge resistance to having single-payer most people if you go online if you look at the YouTube comments below here they will fight you they will shout until they're blue in the face that that is communism it's socialism we don't want it but they don't shout until they're blue in the face about the socialism that is a massive Defense Department spend most of that is welfare its welfare for Raytheon is welfare for Lockheed Martin its welfare for thousands of people who live in mansions in Virginia its welfare for Facebook its welfare for Google its welfare for Silicon Valley and but they don't see it that way because those are a different class of people that they never get to see right because in the UK there is an entrenched and very hardened class war and so it becomes a subject for class war debates in the US you don't have that similar class war it's more of an ideological war and if you if you could make apples to apples comparison you could see clearly and you'd make good intelligent rational choice but because the people in the UK are every single night on the BBC they're like a little carrot they're pulled along to engage in class war and every single night in America they're a carrot called guns and God and they're moved along like little lemmings toward the cliff in their own particular way so but I want to say you know it's like I said it's choices that you make Europe will is breaking up Google and and all these monopolies these online monopolies the US has decided not to except for maybe this Louisiana Attorney General thank God for Louisiana go Louisiana we've got to take a break when we come back much more coming your way welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to return to Chicago and talk to Mission laka bish calm welcome back mesh they have pleasure tea back on a double segment here today very exciting so listen mish it's ten-year anniversary of the financial crisis now back in 2008 that the big debate was inflation or deflation you and Peter Schiff famously debated this Peter was taking the inflation argument you were taking the deflation argument okay looking back now 10 years back who was right how did it all happen evolve well I was right I mean certainly he was predicting a crash of the dollar he thought China would decouple from the US economy neither of those two things happened actually the dollar ended up strengthening prices temporarily went negative but that wasn't my measure my measure was was always the balance sheets of banks were going to get crucified which is what happened and it drugged the stock market down near my definition of deflation is a decrease in money supply and credit with credit mark to market credit on the balance sheets of banks was was certainly crucified then what kind of rectified it all was in 2009 the Fed came out and said hey we're just gonna suspend mark-to-market accounting actually that's when the corporate bond market took off and it revived the stock market with it okay good good summary now let's talk about gold you know it continues to kind of sit there and bore everybody to death is this a good sign is gold still in a bull market kenick where is it going from here further down well it's down over 20% so technically it's in a in a in a bear Marcus the question is where does it go from here now on this i think peter schiff and i are aligned I think we're we're both expecting gold to go up and I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna see another credit this time it won't be in housing rather it's going to be in the corporate bond market the the whoof but it will impact housing and it will impact the stock market the Fed is going to do the yawn policy which we just discussed that is try and blow bigger bubble than they blew before I believe I mean I can be wrong but I think shift would say the same thing he expects gold to do well when the Fed steps on the gas the next time right so the fuse that was lit that blew up the market in 2008 was the subprime crisis so the fuse this time that would be lit to blow things up in your view will be the corporate bond market okay all of the junk issuance we have far more of it now the covered light the covenant light the leveraged loans absolutely through the roof we've also got corporations borrowing money just to buy back shares of stock all bad news max if you ask me now despite the boring price of gold Russia and China continue to accumulate gold why are they stockpiling gold and is it a good move by these two countries I think it's a good move and contrast my gosh Turkey trying to stabilize the the Turkish Larry sold gold my gosh that has to have the opposite effect the last thing you want to do is is get rid of your hard currency a gold and and to try and support something that's essentially unsupportable i think the big news here is is not to china in gold gold buying but rather how they might respond to more sanctions and tariffs from trunk care to talk about that one right exactly now let's talk about Trump's trade war with China continues to escalate miss you're on the record saying tariffs are bad what do you think about the impact so far there's got to be both some positive and some negative can you give us kind of a view the impact so far okay it's benefited the steel manufacturers it's benefited a few others that's the only I can come up with aluminum I guess but it's all at the expense of either consumers or producers who use steel imports it's been relatively minor and contained so far because it was first just on 50 billion and it was targeted to just single sets of things Trump has widened that in response to the first part though China reacted and it's cut off agricultural imports soy beans kidney beans things like that have been punished I think he's going to lose the midterm elections because of tariffs also for political reasons here we have this Cavanaugh err we'll leave that aside but the Trump is now threatening tariffs on all of Chinese goods we discussed that in the first segment you know we're talking about significant price increases at Walmart the main fear out of the US might be how China retaliates this time it was a veiled threat that I think you caught China came out and said we're the supplier of certain things and the US doesn't have an easy means of getting them what are they talking about max I am positive they are talking about rare earth elements these things are used in weapons systems and extremely powerful Magnus they're used in touchscreen phones specialized glass things that goes into airplanes I've got a contact at Boeing I asked him to quantify that his belief was that he thinks that Boeing and the airline manufacturer will be affected you can't say how much he thinks that Boeing keeps these things secret I don't know but we do know that these rare errs they're not actually all that rare max but China is the only producer of them why because they produce a lot of toxic sludge and other unsavory things when you're manufacturing during these things so yeah another country could step up but we're talking about you know a mine potentially three years down the road so there's no supply of these now what Trump has done analyst suggesting and I agree with is they've driven China and Russia to suspicious countries of each other a little bit closer together how much I don't know but Russia as it turns out is the world's major supplier of titanium so if Trump gets you know puts really puts pressure on Russia we can have a supply shortage of tank titanium and rare earth elements there's gonna be a lot of repercussions to that on top of the 10 15 20 percent price increase on all goods coming from China alright great points Mitch now despite the fact that Democrats believe Trump is a grave threat to the Republic the Congress voted 93 to 7 to approve a huge military budget your thoughts what's up with that max that's my thought it shows that both sides here are war mongers hey you know I you pressure me over Trump I voted for him I would vote for him again the I'm just happened to be a free trade advocate I'm convinced that free trade is the right way regardless of what everybody does but to partisan politics there are such that typically anything the Trump wants to do the Democrats are disagree with and vice versa so it is kind of strange here 97 to 3 vote or was was able to I excuse me 93 to 7 vote in favor of increasing warmongering max what's up with that both sides are war mongers they don't want you to believe that but they are yeah let's get into some details on this so a leaked State Department memo reveals that Mike Pompeo backed continued US involvement in the war on Yemen because a cut-off would undermine a two billion dollar deal to sell 120,000 Raytheon percent guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and the UAE so here's some details mesh continue you're on a roll well we saw the same thing the the u.s. backs allegedly moderate al-qaeda forces in Syria you know what's up with that we have the strangest bedfellows here all the things the the minute one person dies in Syria over what I believe are a false flag incidents the US mainstream media goes completely eight over this yet we have US bombings certified killing people with us weapons you know and and Yemen everyone looks the other way where is the balanced reporting there is none max let's talk kind of go back to China and trade war for a moment so a lot of people when they talk about this they discuss currency war and of course what is often decided is China sitting on four trillion dollars of reserves etc so would how would that play out China would they drop the peg etc what would a currency war how it might that unfold if this trade war gets more heated mich the most likely thing in a currency war would probably be China slowly devaluing the one they came out the other day and they made some statement well we're not gonna do this well they've already done it act but but the idea that they're going to just sell all of these Treasuries what are they gonna do with them it's counterproductive remember one of the ways that they supported the one during the capital flight crisis was they actually sold US Treasuries bought one to prop up the price of the one if they did that again sold Treasuries and bought one the price of the wine would rise which is counterproductive to what they want to know so I think they've got limited impact here in terms of a currency war or selling Treasuries also once again Treasury accumulation is a function of math China still runs this surplus with the United States as long as they're running a surplus they have to accumulate US assets they're accumulating US Treasuries so I think fears of of this massive wave of selling of Treasuries is overblown but China very much my slowly talk down the wand which is exactly what I expect you know with trade war if there is an occasion for a reciprocal trade tariffs you know the problem is that China doesn't really important much from the US so is that you know a fair statement and what do you think about that absolutely that's a fair statement yeah given that China's surplus with the US is is so massive they can actually only respond about a third as much as what the US can do you know the Trump can do administration can do even more China can further cut off access to US corporations in China they can increase their tariffs by a higher percentage than what the US did but the real not the real threat here is they cut off rare earth elements supplies used in US weapons systems glass cell phones and the like I think that's the big retaliatory threat at the moment all right Mitch excellent as usual thanks for being on the Kaiser report pleasure to be back on max and we got to do this again looking forward to it well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy Everett I want to thank our guest mich shed lock of mich talk.com if you want to catch us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
