PHONE.
HE IS PUSHING TO EASE THE BAN AS
PART OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH
CHINA.
TO PULL THE PLUG ON THE UPCOMING
SINGAPORE SUMMIT AFTER 1-SIDED
DEMANDS FOR DENUCLEARIZATION.
KIM JONG UN CALLING ON THE
UNITED STATES TO END MILITARY
DRILLS WITH SOUTH KOREA.
WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART AFTER
THE STAGE IS SET?
POLICY EXPERT, THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US.
WHY DO YOU THINK THE SUDDEN
CHANGE OF HEART OR IS IT A
CHANGE OF HEART?
>> NEVER HAVE ANYONE ON THE SHOW
WHO TELLS YOU WHAT THE NORTH
KOREANS ARE THINKING.
WE SHOULD NEVER PRESUME TO KNOW.
WE SEE A PATTERN OF NORTH KOREAN
BEHAVIOR WHERE WE ARE THE ANGRY
GUY PAYING ATTENTION AND IN SOME
WAYS THIS THE SAME OLD SAME OLD.
GOING INTO THE TALKS, THEY HAD A
SENSE THAT MOMENT WAS TOO STRONG
ON THE US SIDE AND WENT TO DO
SOMETHING.
>> THERE HAS TO BE A REASON
BEHIND IT.
LET'S LOOK AT THE STATEMENT
THREATENING TO CANCEL THE
SUMMIT, THE UNITED STATES WILL
-- THIS IS A DIFFERENT
SOUNDBITE.
OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
TAKES AN APPROACH TO THE SUMMIT
WITH SINCERITY FOR IMPROVED
RELATIONS IT WILL RECEIVE A
DESERVED RESPONSE BUT IF THE US
IS TRYING TO DRIVE US INTO A
CORNER TO FORCE NUCLEAR
ABANDONMENT WE WILL NO LONGER BE
INTERESTED.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WORDS
THEY ARE USING?
THE PROVOCATIVE MILITARY DRILL,
THIS IS SOMETHING THE UNITED
STATES HAS BEEN DOING A LONG
TIME WITH SOUTH KOREA.
>> THE NORTH KOREANS WHEN THEY
WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT. THE
END TO THESE THINGS AND WHEN THE
NORTH KOREANS SAY WHATEVER, WE
DON'T CARE.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
DRILLS, THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE DRILLS BUT WHAT I FOUND
INTERESTING ABOUT THAT
STATEMENT, IF THE US COMES TO
THE TABLE, WE DON'T WANT TO DO A
DEAL BUT THE US SENT STRONG
SIGNALS THE UNITED STATES
ADMINISTRATION COMING TO A DEAL.
WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER, IT
IS NOT NOTHING FOR YOU.
YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU NEED TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF
THIS DEAL BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
YOU WON'T HONOR IT BUT I WILL
GET OUT OF THE DEAL WHAT I NEED
AND THAT IS THE WAY THE
PRESIDENT WILL NEGOTIATE THIS.
>> THE STATEMENT, THE UNITED
STATES WILL UNDERTAKE CAREFUL
DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE FATE OF
THE SUMMIT IN LIGHT OF THIS
PROVOCATIVE MILITARY RUCKUS
CONDUCTED WITH SOUTH KOREAN
AUTHORITIES AND YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT THAT.
>> NORTH KOREANS WALK AWAY FROM
THE TALK, WHO CARES?
OUR STRATEGY IS MAXIMUM
DETERRENCE WHICH IS NUCLEAR
DETERRENCE, MISSILE-DEFENSE,
SANCTIONING AND KEEPING THAT IN
PLACE AS LONG AS NORTH KOREA'S
NUCLEAR THREAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM
ANY RUNNING ROOM.
IF WE KEEP THE STRATEGY IN PLACE
THEY CAN DO THAT ALL THEY ONCE.
>> CHINA COMES INTO PLAY WITH
THIS AND CERTAIN TALKS IN TERMS
OF TRADE WITH CHINA.
IS THIS ANY LEVERAGE CHINA CAN
USE?
>> I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION
CAN'T GET INTO A BOX, MANAGER
