00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
hashtag logging while driving I feel a

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,920
little ridiculous and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at you because I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus</font>

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,670
on the road actually while I live in the

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,130
car I have always had<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an</font>

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,610
interesting relationship with driving

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,520
and vehicles in general i started

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,770
driving like most people when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was 16</font>

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,270
but I was like really really nervous

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're supposed to have like a</font>

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,720
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of hours of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> practice or</font>

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,189
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get your license</font>

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,279
and I remember like just barely getting

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,619
to that because practicing driving was

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,540
so stressful of course I failed the

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,250
first driver's test that I took and

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,350
eventually it past so I could like to

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,610
drive myself to school every day and

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">dance practice and I got comfortable</font>

20
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,710
just by practicing constantly kind of

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,600
like what I was saying the other day the

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,100
more you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something the better you get</font>

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,070
imagine that plugging while driving at a

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,739
red light I look kind of stupid but

25
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,300
anyway then I went to college and I

26
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,940
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a car so like for four years</font>

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,180
I basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> never drove maybe like a</font>

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,489
dozen times<font color="#E5E5E5"> in four years but actually</font>

29
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,069
that was really nice because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

30
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,500
to walk or bike everywhere like the

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,270
internship I had I could walk to I

32
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,010
walked all my classes

33
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,110
the only time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ever got in a car was if</font>

34
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,310
a friend was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,990
grocery<font color="#CCCCCC"> store I gotta say if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

36
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,640
swing it living life without a car is a

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,070
really nice way to live life but now I'm

38
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,750
back living in a city where basically

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,600
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get around and</font>

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
it kind of sucks so i drive to work

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,900
every day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not afraid of driving</font>

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,390
anymore and i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually become an</font>

43
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,030
excellent parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> parker but I still</font>

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,320
kind of missed those days when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,150
get around without a vehicle just better

46
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,250
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind like I could think through</font>

47
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,750
things or I could just take in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

48
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">around me and I got to skip that little</font>

49
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,860
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> anxiety that always still comes</font>

50
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">with getting behind the wheel of a car</font>

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,160
plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting around from point A to</font>

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,800
fresh<font color="#E5E5E5"> air it makes you feel human I am</font>

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,420
little more dense you know that there's

59
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,310
enough going on that you're close enough

60

to everything you need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can walk</font>

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,929

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,760
transportation so it's a backup if you

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,530
need to go a little further is that I

64
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,300
can live the car free life once again

65
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,840
