THE. Shepard: A MOLTEN MIX OF LAVA AND GAS COMING DOWN THE SLOPE IN GUATEMALA, BURNING VILLAGES FASTER THAN PEOPLE CAN RUN AWAY IT FROM. THEY'RE CALLING THIS ERUPTION THE VOLCANO OF FIRE. NOW THEY SAY AT LEAST 62 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE IT ERUPTED YESTERDAY AND THEY SAY THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO RISE. RIGHT NOW RESCUERS ARE WORKING TO PULL BURNED AND ASH-COVERED PEOPLE FROM THE RUBBLE AFTER THE MOST VIOLENT ERUPTION IN MORE THAN A CENTURY. MORE IMAGES THAT I HAVE FOR YOU TODAY IN THE SLIDE SHOW. THIS IS AN OVERVIEW. POLICE IN GUATEMALA RELEASING THIS PICTURE. IT WASN'T LIKE THE LAVA IN HAWAII THAT IS SLOW. NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. THE TYPE OF FLOW FROM THIS VOLCANO CAN TRAVEL AROUND 430 MILES AN HOUR. IT'S DIFFERENT. MORE RESCUERS ON THE GROUND HERE. SOME OF THE LAND TOO HOT TO TOUCH AND MELTED WORKERS SHOES, WE'RE TOLD. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. RESCUERS SAY THE PEOPLE THEY FOUND WERE COVERED IN SUCH A THICK LAYER OF ASH THEY LOOKED LIKE STATUES. THIS IMAGE OF A VICTIM. A MAN THAT MADE IT OUT ALIVE WITH A GAS MASK ON AND HOLDING A DOG. STEVE HARRIGAN WITH THIS IN A LIVE UPDATE. STEVE? SHORT, THE ASH AND THE LAVA MOVING SO QUICKLY THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WERE QUITE BY SURPRISED AND TRAPPED. HERE'S A POLICE CAN OUTRUNNING A CLOUD OF ASH. THEY GUNNED THE CAR BUT SUDDENLY DAY TURNED INTO NIGHT. YOU CAN SENSE THE PANIC, GO, GO. WASH OUT FOR THE PEOPLE. A SENSE OF PANIC ON THE PEOPLE EVEN RESPONDING TO HELP. WE'RE GETTING A DEATH TOLL THAT IS REVISED EACH HOUR. STILL DOZENS OF PEOPLE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR, SHARD. Shepard: WHAT ARE WE HEARING ABOUT THE RESCUE EFFORTS? IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE THE LAVA IS RECOVERING THE ROADS. EVEN FOR THOSE THAT ARE BEING RESCUED, THERE'S STILL A REAL SENSE OF TRAUMA. ONE WOMAN SAID I TURNED BACK AND SAW CARS WITH PEOPLE INSIDE BEING COVERED BY LAVA. SHE SAID I SAW A LITTLE GIRL SCREAM OUT FOR HER MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER. REALLY SIMPLE HORRIFIC IMAGES. A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FACED WITH A SPLIT SECOND DECISION. YOU HEAR THE ACCOUNTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN SAYING I TRIED TO RUN FOR HIGH GROUND. I TRIED TO RUN FOR A HILL. OFTEN THEY HAD TO LEAVE EVERYTHING.
