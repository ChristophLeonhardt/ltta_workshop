is president Trump's announcement my fellow Americans today I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon the Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror it exports dangerous missiles fuels conflicts across the Middle East and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah Hamas the Taliban and al Qaeda over the years Iran and it's proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations murdered hundreds of American servicemembers and kidnapped imprisoned and tortured American citizens the Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people he goes on and we'll get to more of that later but I know John Kerry he's so he's trying so hard he just wants to weigh in all he's been calling the Iranians he's been calling his former co-workers and allies abroad okay that's fine former Secretary of State John Kerry what is your comment on this deal can you kiss a pretty

him his own I'll just pass him out to everyone here at the Daily wire this is so so good I might sprout a John Bolton mustache just to celebrate I might will it in just all the cough if a forces in me to pop out of John Bolton mustache the Iran deal was terrible it was terrible don't believe what the lefty study on Twitter today it was terrible practically and it was terrible symbolically it was terrible practically because it paved the way for Iran to have a nuclear weapon and it was so weak it was so we just gave them a bunch of money that's basically what the deal I'll explain the intricacies of the deal in a little bit it was also terrible symbolically because it was the United States just bending over to Iran after we said for years and years you're not gonna get a bomb you can't do this don't do this we'll have a red line don't man way and then we just bent over and gave them all this money and bowed down so yes here take whatever you want you know it's okay just don't build a bomb for the next 15 minutes and then you can build a bomb that's not what we get now what Donald Trump said today President Trump in his announcement is that the United States no longer makes empty threats oh what a relief what a relief the entire Obama age was oh you better not do this you better not although I'm gonna be I'm gonna write you a strongly worded letter I'm gonna say hey booboo can we all just admit finally that Donald Trump is a way way better president than basically anybody thought he would be can we all finally admit that there I bet right now the last anti Trump conserve is somewhere in the oak-paneled study of the Weekly Standard or somewhere and he's saying yeah sure sure but you know but does Trump read Baudelaire I don't does he he is doing so well now you might be wondering how can Donald Trump just scrap the Iran deal doesn't he have to go through Congress or the Senate or I don't know anybody can't any have to ask this person or that person no no he doesn't he can just scrap it and do you know why he can scrap it because it's not a treaty now why isn't a treaty I thought it was a treaty doesn't it sound like a treaty it's an international agreement between the United States and another country on pretty important matters matters of national security there are other Signet would-be signatories to this non treaty treaty but there's a beautiful irony here there is a beautiful irony this gets to the Obama rule the current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo then a congressman from Kansas in 2015 when the Iran deal was inked or not quite inked he hated the Iran deal and he was one of its biggest critics the State Department wrote to Pompeo the current Secretary of State in 2015 and said the joint comprehensive plan of action that's the Iran deal the joint comprehensive plan of action is not a treaty or an executive agreement and is not a signed document so what is it if it's not a treaty it's an executive agreement it's not a signed document the reason for that is that it could never get through the Senate Barack Obama couldn't build consensus even within his own party he certainly couldn't get an international treaty like that where we just surrender and say Iran build a nuke in 15 minutes you certainly couldn't get that signed so they did everything they could to avoid having any oversight from the people any oversight from our elected representatives on the Iran deal now we should have seen this coming a little while ago some people did see it coming when Donald Trump named Pompeo to be Secretary of State that was a signal from the White House that this would happen notice that he was a major Iran deal critic apparently his predecessor Rex Tillerson was a little more open to the Iran deal he wasn't as critic of it so when that shift happened when you brought in Ambassador John Bolton to be the national security adviser one of the great critics of the Iran deal an end of Iran generally as the threat to the world order when you brought him in you had to think hmm I bet this deal isn't very long for this world but the Iran deal because it's not a treaty because treaties need to be ratified by the Senate the Iran deal can just be scrapped because Donald Trump says so and Pompeyo says so and john bolton says so and every reasonable american says so this is the Obama rule this is what makes it that much sweeter this is what makes the irony's so nice it's not only do we get rid of this stupid terrible policy that further imperils the world order and destroys American credibility abroad not only do we scrap that but we add insult to injury with Barack Obama because the Obama rule is that which can be enacted with a pen and a phone can be repealed with a pen and a phone this was what Obama would brag about he would brag about how he was a king how he was a dictator he would say I don't need to go through Congress if Congress doesn't want to enact my policies I've got a pen and a phone I'll sign executive orders and I'll just make them instituted by my godless headless unaccountable bureaucracies and the bureaucratic agencies okay that's what you can do that ain't gonna have legs and now there's there is no more Obama legacy what's left what is left of the Obama legacy after the Iran deal is gutted Obamacare has been gutted it hasn't been officially repealed but the individual mandate the sticking point of Obamacare the the government saying you have to pay this penalty or tax or a tax when it's not a penalty or blah blah blah you got to pay us you got to buy a product from a private company that's gone Trump snuck that into the tax reform plan so that that's gone Obamacare has gutted the death spiral has been accelerated the clean power plan a signature Obama EPA achievement gutted the Iran deal gutted Supreme Court balance totally preserved Antonin Scalia died unfortunately but we got this new guy in his place who's an originalist on the court the balance of the court would have totally been in disarray it had Donald Trump not won the presidency would have preserved a lot of Obama era policies and priorities that didn't happen the transgender military experiment that existed for 15 minutes you know that they didn't exist for most of Barack Obama's presidency and then he decided to poke a finger in the eye of Americans because he believes that the only thing that matters in the United States are the handful of people who suffer from gender confusion and we need to tailor all of our priorities as a country to eliminating biological sexual differences that's over offshore Arctic oil drilling offshore drilling and Arctic oil drilling that's back on government regulation of the internet and the so called net neutrality that's over how about the Paris climate want to be treaty another fake treaty that Barack Obama knew he couldn't get through so he had to sort of ante constitutionally sign this agreement what about that oh we're out of that one too what's left what is left it's the end of the Obama legacy it is as if the man were not president it's over it's over today mark it on your calendars folks it's done John Kerry now the Barack Obama is Secretary of State the one of the most boring men in the world when he's not spending time just standing on his yacht calling to Teresa Hinze as a monkey bring me my mai tai monkey mm-hmm when he's not doing that he's not just being Thurston Howell the third on Gilligan's Island he has been working overtime to try to save this deal he's been calling foreign leaders he's been calling the leaders of Iran all the people who used to work with overseas when he was Secretary of State he met with the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to try to save this deal I know you're confused you would say wait a second why is he doing this when he's not the Secretary of State and he not only that he doesn't hold any position in our government oh because he's a big jerk who thinks too highly of himself and really wants to salvage any even slight vestige of a legacy for him or for Barack Obama or for Hillary Clinton but they can't cuz it's over hah hah hah hah hah hah so he's meeting with these people and he's meeting with adversaries of the United States and he's negotiating behind the back of the US government not only is this sort of uncouth not only is this a little bit gauche and disrespectful of your current administration and your current government it's illegal it is illegal in the Logan Act we'll get to that in a second of course in typical trumpian form the president responded via Twitter Donald Trump wrote quote the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran deal he was the one that created this mess in the first place that's right and it reminds you of like a little kid this is what John Kerry and the Obama people are doing now there is a little kid and he was playing around where he shouldn't have been and he broke the cookie jar and he smashed the vaz or whatever and he's trying to clean it up really quick before you notice he's trying on they want man they won't notice if I do it real except except we did notice your legacy is terrible you've been at a net negative for the country sorry try again you can't try again it's over you had a bad career you did you did bad you failed at your job and now Donald Trump is cleaning up your mess and doing it very well so what he did here what John Kerry is clearly doing is violating the Logan Act the Logan Act was passed in 1799 it criminalizes unauthorized persons from negotiating with foreign governments that have a dispute with the United States makes sense there's a reason that this law was passed very early on in our nation's history almost immediately is you can't possibly have that can you you can't have a government negotiating deals and then have the opposition party you can't have the Republican administration governing the country and in the world because the United States is a leader of the free world and then behind their backs you have Democrats saying hey don't listen to them yeah don't we're gonna kick them out in a few years and then you deal with that so don't listen to them that would that would destroy the United States a house divided against itself cannot stand wise man said that and and then other wise men quoted that you can't possibly have that so it's an important law this is what they booked Mike Flynn on this is how they got former Trump national security adviser for four also about 15 minutes Mike Flynn they got him on the Logan act because the incoming national security adviser talked with his counterparts overseas during the transition a perfectly normal practice they decided to go after him on the Logan act and and try to get him on this what John Kerry is doing right now up until two hours ago it's way way worse than anything Mike Flynn did with regard to the Logan Act the trouble here of course is that no one has ever been convicted of violating the Logan Act since it was passed in 1799 so we partisans always use this as a threat they always said when it's I've done it too it's a good little thing to point out because it is a good law so you actually do need to watch out for it but no one's actually going to get prosecuted for it the the law started because President Adams John Adams didn't like France very much which is a good American tradition so a Jefferson loyalist George Logan of Philadelphia went to Paris in 1798 to get around the Federalists administration yeah the Federalists Adams you had the anti-federalists led by Jefferson and the anti-federalists sent some people to Paris and said don't don't negotiate with the Federalists that's not good I I totally understand why that law was passed as a matter of politics we probably don't want to prosecute people for it it would just get pretty messy if you have your political opponents talking with people overseas and you start throwing your political opponents in jail it just doesn't look good even if they deserve it even if they're Hillary Clinton frankly it's not a great look to throw your political opponents in jail no matter how criminal they are and how much they deserve it so it's I suppose it's a good thing we don't prosecute people for this but important to keep in mind because John Kerry is violating this it is an important law it is really horrible what he's doing it's very disrespectful it's very anti-american but hey we're talking about John Kerry we're talking about John Kerry who just speaks in French on his yacht to to little monkey you know monkey hello bring me my bring me my Tom Collins so not just John Kerry's upset about this Barack Obama's flacks the people who were 14 years old when they worked in the White House now they're 16 years old they're also very very sad the one that this one came out I believe from Ben Rhodes quote beyond the potentially catastrophic consequences with Iran Trump's decision is devastating to us credibility globally after this why would anyone trust an international agreement that the u.s. negotiates you jerks that's what that's what he tweeted out former he was like a failed novelist this guy he was in a master's program for fiction writing and for some reason he came to determine foreign policy for the United States under Barack Obama I think he drove a van one time for the Obama campaign so he was promoted to this major presidential advisor are you kidding me are you kidding you are gonna talk to me ben rhoades about the credibility of the United States you're gonna talk to me Obama administration officials about international credibility in the United States the Obama administration's the President himself not just Aflac not just a one of you the President himself said we have a red line we're drawing a red line in Syria and there will be dire consequences if Russia if Syria crosses that red line and guess what Syria did they said well Barack Obama you look like kind of a wimp so we're gonna cross it what are you gonna do and Obama said mmm I'm gonna write you a strongly worded letter that's what I'm gonna do pathetic absolutely pathetic are you kidding me you people people who allow the international community people who allow our foreign adversaries little tin-pot dictator x' in the middle of nowhere they when they allow them to push us around to and we stand down and we don't back up our threats those are the people that are gonna tell us about us credibility give me a break getting rid of the Iran deal is finally restoring us credibility abroad it's finally saying no we're not going to allow the the worst regime on planet Earth we're not going to allow and look there are other crazier regimes like North Korea's that kind of crazier regime but it's a threat to the world order as a persistent constant threat to the world order nobody touches Iran and we're gonna let the okay you can have a nuclear weapon but hey we'll only give you a nuclear weapon if we can give you a ton of money too that was the deal basically finally were restoring credibility and by the way mr. Rhodes what about what what international agreement are you talking about what why would get into an international agreement with the United States I thought this wasn't an international agreement I thought this wasn't a binding agreement I thought this wasn't a treaty I thought this wasn't an executive agreement it's just a thing right it's because that's that's the way the Obama administration sold it because what their actions were patently anti-constitutional you can't have it both ways you cannot have it both ways it can't be a binding treaty that the United States committed itself to when it's convenient for the Obama people and then oh just a thing that nobody actually had to sign because we don't want to go through the Senate on the other hand you can't have it both ways another Obama flack Dan Pfeiffer tweeted quote pulling out of the Iran deal will make all that trumpets feel good but what is the plan now to contain the Iranian nuclear threat huh it doesn't seem like anyone in the White House has even thought as today's event this is another one of the Obama pod Bros he's one of the people on pod save America that I've been saving my brain from by not listening to but I'm gonna have to listen today because it's gonna be the biggest wine fest ever it's gonna be the biggest wine fest since November 8th 2016 but through mr. Pfeiffer's suggestion that nobody in the White House has thought about how to prevent the Iranian bomb after the Iran deal is scrapped pretty sure someone has if memory serves correctly the national security adviser to President Trump john bolton published while the iran deal was being finalized while all people of good sense were protesting this stupid deal he published an op-ed in the New York Times titled to stop Iran's bomb bomb Iran seems like someone's thought of it doesn't sound like a bad idea either and by the way that was the headline that was written it's a good piece it's a more nuanced piece just like all things with John Bolton the headline always sounds crazy and then you actually read anything about it and you realize this is an extremely nuanced thinker who knows much more than you do about these topics that people spout off on but to stop Iran's bomb bomb Iran is an important statement because it doesn't mean that we're gonna launch a massive war with Iran it doesn't mean we're going to invade Iran doesn't even quite mean that we're going to bomb Iran necessarily what it means is that we're not going to appease you and we're going to have the credible threat of violence against them if they continue to threaten the world order and this is to ensure world peace simple-minded people a pacifist type people they say oh if you if you threaten violence that that threatens the world order not true when you when you have strength when you come to adversaries from a position of strength you can have peace the the Reagan years were they his critics said they were bellicose he was saber rattling he was threatening war was a madman there were some of the most peaceful years in recent history the Reagan administration both terms peace when you come when you come to an adversary and you say I'm not going to fight I don't want to fight please don't make me fight that creates chaos that creates war you have peace through strength and you have chaos and war through appeasement appeasing Iran threatens the World Order and it threatens the world order in a very specific way I'm not just speaking in ethereal terms we have kept a lid on nuclear weapons for a very long time we've been using nuclear weapons since the 1940s and we've been developing them we've been trying to develop them for for a long time and we used them in the Second World War we've been able to keep a lid on nukes since then an L would stand to reason if the United States has nuclear weapons if the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons pretty soon everybody would have nuclear weapons that's what people expected but that's not what happened right now the countries that possess nuclear weapons are the United States Russia the UK France China India Israel Pakistan now other other country and North Korea other countries have actually denuclearized they've had nukes and then they've gotten rid of them South Africa the former Soviet republics like Belarus Kazakhstan Ukraine but they've actually denuclearized and we've kept nukes away from the other countries we've just said you're not gonna do it we're gonna keep a hold on it for as long as we can we've done a very good job for six seven decades Iran threatens all of this because if we allow if we permit Iran the greatest threat to the world order it's always got one foot in the world order one foot funding terrorism abroad if we allow them to have a nuclear every other country is going to demand this every other country around the world is going to demand these things despite what the Obama Bros and the pod Bros and John Kerry thinks this is great news so very quickly what did the Iran deal do well it was sold to us as reducing Iran's ability to produce plutonium and uranium to components used in nuclear weapons didn't do that there's also a sunset clause that would ease the restrictions over time so at best even if Iran was a straight player it would delay the program slightly but we know from the recent presentation in Israel it didn't even really do that the Iranians are liars they lied to us they did have a secret program nobody can trust them especially on this issue so in return that's what we get is basically nothing in return maybe a at best a slight delay in the nuclear bomb for Iran at best in return we gave them a ton of money we lifted massive sanctions from them we unfroze between 50 and 150 billion dollars of Iranian assets in banks throughout the US and overseas and then to top it all off we sent an airplane carrying 1.7 billion dollars in cash euros Swiss francs other currencies we just flew it to Iran and just gave them cash that was our negotiation we pretended that Iran doesn't have a nuclear program that they're trustworthy enough to to be to be trusted to work with here even though we know definitively that they've been lying to us about the nuclear program they already have we at best slightly delay the bomb in return we give them gazillions of dollars that took two years to negotiate that took two years to say hey would you like a bomb and a lot of money you're going to noodle give us more money mmm okay that basically that was a negotiation by the way Donald Trump tried to fix this deal he didn't initially scrap it altogether or seem determined to scrap it altogether the New York Times reports Trump negotiated but the talks collapsed when Trump insisted on sharp limits on Iran's nuclear production continuing after the sunset clause in 2030 under the Obama deal within 12 years Iran gets a bomb Trump said no way the talks broke down so Trump has told the Allies we're gonna reinstate all the sanctions we're gonna impose economic penalties we're he told France first I think this is significant Donald Trump told his a new BFF his best friend forever French president pfff Emmanuel macron I told him first this is significant because France is typically the most dovish you know they call this is the flag of the French army was what they say the handkerchief white handkerchief macron has been skittish about the u.s. withdrawing from the deal and so Trump it was good he's a good people person he gets him on board mainstream media's furious the AP reports breaking Trump to withdraw from landmark nuclear accord with Iran dealing blow to u.s. allies the CNN reports he's withdrawing from the nuclear deal further isolating himself from the world then then CNN reports OPEC official ditching Iran deal would harm the global economy OPEC is Iran by the way OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that includes Iran Iraq Kuwait Saudi Arabia Venezuela just like some of the worst places on planet earth and so if basically the headline could read Iran warns ditching Iran deal is bad for a breaking well so and by the way Trump is sending a message with the timing of this announcement today is a victory in Europe day today is you it might have forgotten in the excitement the New York Times headline in 1945 today the war in Europe has ended surrender is unconditional VE will be proclaimed today our troops on Okinawa game now critics always say oh it's just a coincidence you're reading too much into Trump oh you just got lucky it just happened to be it's just an accident just a coincidence okay or yeah sure so either Donald Trump knows what he's doing or he's a complete idiot buffoon who just happens to be the luckiest person in the history of the world the entire Trump Foreign Policy promise from the beginning of the campaign has been we don't win anymore we need to win we need to win we need to have more wins like we had in World War two the last time we had a major World acknowledged win so he chooses the anniversary of the greatest u.s. foreign policy win to declare this nuclear deal over and to say we're enough peace through strength seems like a tough coincidence that's a hard argument to make the less no longer makes empty threats we've got some more

John Kerry variety we'll be right back with excellent other political news it's too much today I can't how am I supposed to go through all of these leftist tears and I'm gonna be drowning okay really really good news coming up right now from the from the federal government believe it or not under Donald Trump the federal government has had a month which was on time and under budget in April the federal government had the best budget month in history the federal government took in five hundred fifteen billion dollars in taxes it's only spent only two hundred ninety seven billion dollars this is a two hundred eighteen billion dollar surplus it beats the old record that happened seventeen years ago of 190 billion you always hear they talk about the great budget surpluses of that that's what they're talking about they're talking about 2001 we just beat him we just beat it the surplus surprised CBO analysts the CBO analysts predicted a lower lower receipts to the government and this they said is the result of a stronger than expected economic growth listen to that language surprised they'd surprised the analysts it's stronger than expected I don't think it's stronger than expected it's just stronger than you expected and these analysts these experts keep telling us well we all expected this it's unexpected growth it's unexpected this no no you just honor you you are not expecting it because you're not seeing what's going on because you're still living in fantasy land 99% certainty Hillary Clinton's going to win the election Trump isn't going to appoint an originalist Trump isn't gonna pull out a pair of climb it's a climate Accord Trump isn't going to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal Trump isn't going to lower taxes Trump but that's the world so everything is unexpected to you but an annex unexpected if you're just mainlining khofifah every day and that's what's going on here so on that it's on time it's under budget this reminds me of a favorite clip of mine of Donald Trump from 13 years ago understand a residential luxury building is far more complex than an open floor office building to build much more you have many more bathrooms you have many more kitchens you have many more rooms it's more complex office building is essentially open space with sub dividers so I looked at it and I added up some of my costs and for Trump World Tower across the street built not long ago I spent approximately 250 $8 foots tallest building tallest residential building in the world two hundred and fifty eight dollars and 32 cents a foot I have eight hundred and seventy one thousand feet it costs two hundred and twenty five million dollars to build so you hear this it goes on Trump keeps talking like this a lot of people are surprised when they see that clip because it's Donald Trump speaking with technical expertise on something we usually hear because he's talking about so many things the Iran deal tax reform Obamacare this that the other thing and so he speaks in these broad terms just like all presidents do they have to speak in broad terms because they can't nail down to the my new details on every single thing we know that building buildings is something on which Donald Trump has a technical knowledge technical expertise so he says so yeah he was being called to testify before Congress I think Tom Coburn was who was interviewing him and he said the UN building renovations were going way over budget taking way too long and Trump said oh yeah I'd paid two hundred ollars a square foot I'd do this do on tangible things Donald Trump is great he really is expert when it comes to tangible things that you can put your your hands around and that's why Donald Trump even if he lacks precise technical wonkish knowledge of certain areas of public policy or economic policy or foreign policy or whatever he get the issues where there's a gut reaction his gut seems to be in the right place on the Iran deal the Iran deal actually isn't that complicated because it was such a terrible deal but he doesn't maybe he doesn't know the minutiae of this bank account had to be frozen in this because it bump up up but he just could tell this is a bad deal we're giving Iran money we're allowing them to have a nuclear weapon over time bad deal and then they can sort it out there that those tangible sort of things say oh yeah do you think do you think we should give our adversaries the greatest threat to the world order on planet earth should we just give them a bunch of money and nuclear weapons they said no it's a bad deal I don't know a lot of bad Iran sounds like a bad deal so you you see this again and again and the mainstream media they're furious they've turned up the attacks on Donald Trump over the past few months according to a new Media Research Center study God'll of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell they do excellent work 91% of Trump coverage on major networks has been negative specifically of the evaluative comments 90% negative 39% of TV network news coverage of Donald Trump has focused on the scandals the porn star and the whatever other stuff they're gonna gin up the fake dossier whatever 16% an additional 16% of coverage was on the scandals of Trump administration officials so some guy buys an expensive table for his office that's major Network news all night only 45% of TV network coverage was devoted to actual issues actual policy issues that is an insane number 55% was just on frivolous scandal nonsense 45% the minority of time was spent on actual policy issues total ginned up tawdry reality TV scandals that's the news that's the news for you I'm a banana facts first democracy dies I'm the I'm the facts news nonsense they're tabloid trash incredibly though this is the incredible thing Trump's job approval rating actually rose over this period of time it rose from 37% in mid-december to 43% at the end of April and that's not just selectively picking polls that are nice to Donald Trump that is broadly reflected across all public polling now why is this well we've paid our taxes so all that scare mongering nonsense about tax reform that's over and why else because we see the countries doing well you can just sense it you can just feel it you can see oh Johnny's not bite off oh okay that's oh this is oh this is kind of nice man my my wages are increasing we know that wages are increasing oh that's good that hasn't happened in a while additionally public perception of the direction of the country is a ten-year high even CNN admits this this is the greatest sign of the Apocalypse some people are saying Donald Trump's a good president that's a sign of the Apocalypse maybe CNN is admitting the truth about a Republican that is truly the of the apocalypse 57% of Americans the majority of Americans now say things are going well that's up from 49% in February that's a change in just a few months that's this is the largest proportion of people in America who say things are going well in the direction of the country is in the right place since January 2007 since the Bush administration since the beginning of the last year of the Bush administration since before the financial crisis since before that awful nightmare of the Barack Obama administration this is the largest proportion of Americans who say the country's going in the right direction which means that all of the Obama administration was the country going the wrong direction there's even a surge of approval among Democrats 40% of Democrats now say the country is doing well 40% now that number was 25 percent in February that is a thirty-seven point five percent surge in the number of Democrats who thought the country was doing well in February as I think so now just a few months later Trump's daily approval rating from Rasmussen the only polling firm that still does daily approval is between 47 and 51 percent excellent numbers CNN shows those who approve of Donald Trump this is a pretty interesting fact of this survey the those who approve of Donald Trump overwhelmingly cite policy for their positive view the majority of those who disapprove of Donald Trump cite his personality or his body language or his tweets or whatever the people who approve of Trump say hey look all the things that matter they're going great the people who still disapprove of Trump for now they cite ephemeral nonsense another poll Huffington Post and YouGov poll shows that more than half of Hillary Clinton voters say the country was better 50 years ago which makes them deplorable they are now the deplorable zz they're even there is a sense even among Hillary Clinton voters that something in recent years is broken there's a sense that America used to be better and greater than it has been recently I choose that word importantly there is a sense that we need to make America great again that's among Hillary Clinton voters that is wonderful news do we have any time yes in the last it because there's too much good news so we have to get a little bit of ridicul and sad news in we just got to inject that just so that we're not like going through the ceiling today I have to talk about this Met Gala last night the Met Ball this happens every year in to support the the Costume Institute at the Met and it's very big Hollywood stars come they wear these crazy costumes designed by all these amazing designers they're usually quite beautiful this year's was titled heavenly bodies get it fashion and the Catholic imagination now I would have preferred heavenly bodies fashion and the Catholic logical deduction of the nature of reality but that is a minor semantic quibble it's neither here nor there this is the annual show and usually they have these boring themes so they have recently they had China through the looking-glass now you probably can't do that because that's cultural appropriation now you know that's fine as a little boring American woman fashioning a national identity kind of bland they've all been kind of bland recently the Roman Catholic Church is not bland there's many things it is not bland Chesterton described it as a thick steak a glass of red wine and a good cigar that the the the aesthetics of the Catholic Church or the aesthetics of the West and some of these costumes last night some of these gowns and costumes were really quite good Katy Perry's I loved it it was very it was seraphic it was she went is this giant angel six foot tall wings very beautiful it actually did reflect a Catholic aesthetic Rihanna took things a little literally Rihanna was one of the hosts of this this singer Rihanna you know I'm sure we're all very familiar with her her ODEs and you know quartets or whatever she writes she she just showed up in a Pope hat so she just wore a mitre you know and that's but I kind of liked it and sort of it didn't look good exactly but it was kind of fun you know and I don't know I get this I kind of like Rihanna is a you know she works with Kanye I kind of like Kanye now she worked with Paul McCartney that's fun doesn't seem to take herself super seriously yeah I kind of liked her and so but you know she wears this Pope at is it to say like did I do it right and you think well I probably could have done a little but that's okay then it gets to Leena waste I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right she's some actress that I've never heard of and she decided that her response to the Catholic Church she's gonna wear a rainbow flag cape you know cuz she's a she's a lesbian I guess and that's her but yeah now you could say that she was evoking Joseph's coat of many colors I don't know if that's quite what she was going for but either way you know she wears this this rainbow flag cape and she's basically saying yeah yeah that'll show you roman curia that'll show you church to kind of miss the point it's not a Catholic aesthetic so okay good yeah good point hey you got him sure broadly speaking I like the idea of this some Catholics were getting offended they said you know no you shouldn't make a mockery of this I don't think it makes a mockery of the Catholic Church or the Catholic aesthetic to wear clothing that's evocative of the Catholic imagination as they call it I wanted some some Crusaders to show up wearing the big cross and the you know chain-link arm or whatever but the Catholic aesthetic is the aesthetic of the West the greatest art in history has been made by the Catholic faithful Dante Michelangelo Raphael of people that have last names that you know a lot of a lot of of the art of the West is Catholic the majority of it certainly all comes from the tradition of Catholicism the culture of Catholicism the part that's sad about this is that it's a costume the West now wears crucifixes and they were people were wearing big crucifixes they wear them for costume rather than for worship and lest I be accused of being like the cultural appropriation people I'm actually making the exact opposite of their argument I'm not saying that you know my culture is not a costume or my I'm not saying that at all I'm happy that they're wearing Catholic aesthetic garb I'm happy that they're appropriating the Catholic culture I just wish they would appropriate the Catholic cult as well I wish they would go further in their appropriation actually because this dinner wasn't earthís this gala wasn't medieval themed it would be one thing if they said fashion and the early church fashion and the late medieval church fashion and the Provence all bishops or what I don't know it was fashion in the Catholic imagination so it's not just wearing a clothing from a different time period and saying that's my costume all clothing that's out of fashion becomes costume when you wear it I can wear the armor of a knight I'm not really where I'm wearing a costume that would always be a costume but now we're saying Catholic culture itself is a costume because we don't do it anymore and this is not good this is fundamentally disconnecting the culture from the cult you can't have a culture without a cult the culture is defined by what the people worship so this this could threaten to transform modernity into a new Dark Age because everybody's got to serve somebody and that is being supplanted by something the culture that fashioned the West now where's that that garb as a costume that's not a good sign this this poses a lot of threats but ain't gonna happen today because today we're fighting back this is a point I'll try to bring in some clay Venus here because Drew's out all week he always says you just have today if you have a good day then you have a good day tomorrow you have fight for liberty today you preserve Liberty today you preserve it tomorrow if you do that enough days you have a good life you can all we can do is preserve Liberty today and we have done that the cut of the United States has done that today this is a very good day
