1
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:12,429
>> Laura: WE TOLD YOU LAST

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,332
NIGHT ABOUT A SHOCKING REPORT

3
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:17,034
THAT FOUND THAT LAWS LEGALIZING

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,068
MARIJUANA HAVE NOT DRIVEN

5
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:19,770
ORGANIZED CRIME OUT OF THE POT

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,504
TRADE, JUST THE OPPOSITE.

7
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:23,240
THEY HAVE CREATED A HUGE GOLD

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,109
RUSH.

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,978
OUR GUEST MAKES INVERT OF THE

10
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:28,846
MARIJUANA POLICY PROJECT

11
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:29,713
DISAGREES.

12
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,714
>> STATES LIKE COLORADO,

13
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:32,650
WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA, AND

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,219
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS, THE

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:35,953
DEMAND AMONGST THE POPULATION IN

16
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,189
THOSE STATES IS BEING MET BY A

17
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,292
NEW LEGAL MARKET, WHERE THE

18
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,393
PRODUCT IS BEING CONTROLLED.

19
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,528
IT'S BEING GROWN AND SOLD BY

20
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,530
LICENSED BUSINESSES.

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,133
>> Laura: IF THAT STATEMENT

22
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,235
REALLY IRKED SHERIFF PHIL ELDER

23
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:52,369
OF EL PASO COUNTY IN COLORADO

24
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,139
AND HE JOINS US NOW FROM DENVER.

25
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,407
SHERIFF, YOU ARE ON THE FRONT

26
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:57,141
LINE.

27
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,143
YOU SEE THE RESULTS OF POT

28
00:00:59,143 --> 00:00:59,743
LEGALIZATION.

29
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:01,378
I HAVE BEEN A STAUNCH CRITIC OF

30
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:03,614
THIS MOVE TO LEGALIZE DRUGS FOR

31
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:04,013
YEARS NOW.

32
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:07,484
YOU SEE THE MONEY IN IT, IT'S

33
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:07,952
HUGE MONEY.

34
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,754
CORPORATIONS AND LOBBYISTS ARE

35
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:11,956
SWARMING ALL OVER WASHINGTON.

36
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:14,758
I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU WHAT

37
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,460
CHUCK SCHUMER SAID ABOUT THIS.

38
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,928
>> I STUDIED THE ISSUE AND WE

39
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:21,732
NOW HAVE SOME EVIDENCE.

40
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:22,833
THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND

41
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,536
OTHER STATES, WHERE IT HAS DONE

42
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:27,538
LOTS OF GOOD AND NO HARM.

43
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:29,640
THE JUSTICE BRANDEIS SAID, LET

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,141
THE STATES THE LABORATORIES.

45
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,410
THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN A

46
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,678
SUCCESS, LET'S NATIONALIZE IT.

47
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,580
>> HE DOESN'T WANT THE STATES TO

48
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,851
BE LABORATORIES OF PRO-LIFE

49
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:41,418
LEGISLATION, HOWEVER.

50
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:41,752
SHERIFF?

51
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,988
>> IT HAS BEEN A GRAND

52
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:44,588
EXPERIMENT.

53
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,090
WE HAVE TAKEN COLORADO AND WE

54
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,958
HAVE OPENED THE FLOODGATES, AND

55
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,593
NOW WE HAVE BLACK MARKET

56
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:52,196
MARIJUANA EVERYWHERE.

57
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,098
>> Laura: AND IT WAS SAID

58
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,333
YESTERDAY THAT, THE ONLY REASON

59
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,534
THIS IS HAPPENING,

60
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,836
SHERIFF ELDER, IT'S BECAUSE ALL

61
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:01,605
THE OTHER STATES HAVE A NEED FOR

62
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:01,939
THE POT.

63
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:02,640
YOU CAN'T BUY IT IN ALL THE

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,341
OTHER STATES WHERE IT'S NOT

65
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,342
LEGAL.

66
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,577
AND ONCE IT'S LEGALIZE

67
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:07,277
NATIONALLY, THEN THE CARTELS

68
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:08,544
WILL MOVE OUT.

69
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:11,181
DO YOU BUY THAT ARGUMENT?

70
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:13,550
>> NOT AT ALL.

71
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,585
THE CARTELS HAVE INFILTRATED

72
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:15,586
COLORADO RIGHT AND LEFT.

73
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,454
RIGHT NOW WE ARE TRACKING OVER

74
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:20,124
600 GROWS IN EL PASO COUNTY

75
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:22,526
ALONE, WITH ANOTHER 150 OR 200

76
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,161
IN PUEBLO COUNTY THAT ARE ALL

77
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:26,930
CARTEL CONTROLLED BLACK MARKET

78
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,564
MARIJUANA.

79
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,532
THAT MARIJUANA IS BEING PACKAGED

80
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,701
AND SOLD ALL OVER THE EAST COAST

81
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,770
AT TWO OR TWO AND A HALF TIMES

82
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,339
ITS VALUE IN COLORADO.

83
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,573
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

84
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,242
>> Laura: THEY SAY, ONCE ALL

85
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:42,046
THESE OTHER STATES LEGALIZE IT

86
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,148
IT, -- IT'S DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE

87
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:45,449
AND THE MARKET.

88
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:46,950
THE MARKET DEMANDS THAT POT IS

89
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,985
SENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND

90
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:49,753
ALL THESE OTHER STATES NEED TO

91
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,154
GET WITH IT.

92
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:51,955
I WILL SHOW THESE BUREAU

93
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,557
STATISTICS THAT THEY MAY NOT SEE

94
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:54,525
ANYONE ELSE.

95
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:57,961
HERE'S THE CHANGING CRIME FROM

96
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,763
2013-2016 DURING THE

97
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,731
LEGALIZATION.

98
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,565
IN COLORADO.

99
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,967
COLORADO WAS UP 5%, NATIONALLY

100
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,370
IT WAS DOWN 9%.

101
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,372
VIOLENT CRIME, SAME PERIOD,

102
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:10,774
COLORADO OF 12.5%, AND

103
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,610
NATIONALLY UP A 5% CORRESPONDING

104
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,345
TO THE PERIODS OF LEGALIZATION.

105
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:17,314
DOES THAT COMPORT WITH YOUR OWN

106
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,049
EXPERIENCE WITH THE VIOLENT

107
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,151
CRIME INCREASE, SHERIFF?

108
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:24,722
>> IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.

109
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:27,157
WE HAVE NOW LEGALIZE MARIJUANA

110
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,927
FOR MEDICINAL USES, AS WELL AS

111
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:30,427
RECREATIONAL USES.

112
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,763
WE DIDN'T PUT ANY CAPS ON IT.

113
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:34,531
BEFORE YOU COULD GROW UP TO 99

114
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:37,134
PLANTS IN A RESIDENTIAL ZONE AND

115
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,937
TODAY WE HAVE LIMITED DATA TO 12

116
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,038
PLANTS AND EVERY ONE OF THESE

117
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,239
GROWS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN DOWN

118
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,574
SINCE THE FIRST OF THE YEAR HAS

119
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:45,676
HAD WELL OVER 100 PLANTS.

120
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:48,178
SINCE THE FIRST OF THE YEAR, WE

121
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:49,813
HAVE EXECUTED 64 SEARCH WARRANTS

122
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,750
AND RECOVERED ALMOST 5300

123
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,550
MARIJUANA PLANTS THAT WERE

124
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,551
DESTINED FOR THE EAST COAST.

125
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,421
THIS IS NO LONGER AN EXPERIMENT.

126
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,556
>> Laura: AS OF THIS IS

127
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,358
CHINESE, MEXICAN AND CUBAN, A

128
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:02,392
LOT OF THE CARTELS.

129
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:05,129
IS THAT RIGHT?

130
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,933
>> ALONG WITH SOME LOCATIONS IN

131
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:10,434
SOUTHERN COLORADO.

132
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,735
>> Laura: AND A PARTRIDGE IN A

133
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:12,703
PEAR TREE.

134
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,305
THIS IS ABOUT HUGE MONEY, THE

135
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,974
TOBACCO INDUSTRY MOVING INTO THE

136
00:04:16,974 --> 00:00:00,000
POT INDUSTRY, AND APPARENTLY WE
