NOT.
BUT HE'S PRETTY MUCH GIVEN US AN
OUTLINE OF WHAT HE WOULD FIND
ACCEPTABLE WHICH AGAIN, IN SO
FAR AS IT GRANTS A PATH OF
CITIZENSHIP FOR 1.8 MILLION
PEOPLE, THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY IN
AND OF ITSELF.
BUT THE MAJORITY LEADER MADE A
COMMITMENT TO HOLD THIS DEBATE
AND TO HOLD IT THIS WEEK.
HE HAS LIVED UP TO HIS PROMISE.
AND NOW WE CAN'T LET IT ALL GO
TO WASTE, WHICH AS EACH MINUTE
AND EACH HOUR THAT CLICKS OFF
THE TOP -- THE CLOCK, IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT IS MORE AND MORE
LIKELY TO HAPPEN, THAT ALL OF
THIS WILL GO TO WASTE.
THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING.
THE DACA RECIPIENTS IN MY HOME
STATE, ALL 124,000 OF THEM, ARE
WATCHING AND WORRYING,
UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS ABOUT
WHAT THEIR STATUS IS GOING TO BE
WHEN THIS PROGRAM ENDS ON MARCH
5.
ONE OF THOSE DACA RECIPIENTS IS
JULIO RAMOS, A BIOLOGY TEACHER
WHO IS GETTING HIS MASTER DEGREE
IN BIOMEDICAL INFRAMATICS.
HE IS A DACA RECIPIENT.
AFTER HIS MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH BREAST CANCER, HE DECIDED
HE WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR.
HE'S EVEN BEEN ACCEPTED INTO
TEXAS MEDICAL SCHOOLS, BUT HE
WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE WOULD BE
ALLOWED TO ATTEND.
HE'S WAITING AND WATCHING,
WORRIED ABOUT LIZ FUTURE.
-- WORRIED ABOUT HIS FUTURE.
THEN THERE'S MIRIAM SANTAMARIE
FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
SHE GRADUATED FROM HOUSTON HIGH
SCHOOL WITH HONORS.
SHE PAID HER WAY THROUGH
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND SHE WORKS
AS A MANAGER AT A CONSTRUCTION
COMPANY AND OWNS HER OWN
PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS.
SOUNDS LIKE QUITE AN
ENTREPRENEUR TO ME.
MIRIAM SAID, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
ANY KIND OF RECOGNITION OR
SYMPATHY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AND INSPIRE OTHERS.
SHE'S ALSO LOOKING TO LIVE IN
PEACE IN THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT
SHE'S EVER KNOWN, THAT SHE CALLS
HOME.
SHE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES
WHEN SHE WAS 4 YEARS OLD.
FINALLY, THERE IS A MAN WHO I'LL
JUST CALL BY THE FIRST NAME OF
DANIEL.
HE, TOO, LIVES IN TEXAS.
HE GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF NORTH TEXAS WITH A DEGREE IN
ADVERTISING AND CONTRIBUTES
PRODUCTIVELY TO SOCIETY.
DANIEL CAME FROM MEXICO AT THE
AGE OF 2.
AND HE SAID, ALL THE CHOICES I
MAKE I MADE AS AN AMERICAN
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I AM.
WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THESE
STORIES AS WE CONSIDER THIS
LEGISLATION AND AS PEOPLE ARE
PERHAPS TEMPTED INTO THE
POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING AND
GAMESMANSHIP THAT UNFORTUNATELY
SOMETIMES OVERWHELMS OUR BEST
INTENTIONS.
THESE ARE REAL HUMAN LIVES
HANGING IN THE BALANCE.
THEY'RE IMPORTANT.
THEY TEACH US ABOUT THE REAL
PEOPLE BEHIND THE POLICY.
BUT THEIR STORIES ARE NOT THE
ONLY ONES WE NEED TO LISTEN TO.
WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THE STORIES
OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE
BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY FOR YEARS
TO COME HERE IN A LEGAL WAY
THROUGH VISAS AND GREEN CARDS,
WAITING PATIENTLY TO JOIN THEIR
FAMILIES HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES DOING IT THE OLD FASHION
LEGAL WAY.
BUT THEY'VE HAD TO WAIT, SOME
FOR YEARS, SOME FOR DECADES.
AND WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE
STORIES OF THE BORDER
COMMUNITIES THAT I'M PROUD TO
REPRESENT IN TEXAS.
FOR MEN AND WOMEN, MANY OF WHOM
ARE OF HISPANIC ORIGIN, WHO
SUFFERED PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION IS A PRETTY UGLY
BUSINESS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT
IT'S IN THE HANDS OF DRUG
CARTELS AND TRANSNATIONAL
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS.
RECENTLY ONE OF THE MILITARY
LEADERS WHOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SOUTHERN COMMAND, WHICH IS
CENTRAL AMERICA SOUTH, HE SAID
THAT THESE TRANSNATIONAL
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS OR■■
CARTELS ARE COMMODITY AGNOSTIC
IS THE PHRASE HE USED.
HE SAID THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER
IT'S PEOPLE, IT'S DRUGS, OR
OTHER CONTRA BAND.
WHAT THEY'RE IN IT FOR IS THE
MONEY.
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING FOR THE MONEY.
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE VICTIMS OF
HUMAN TRAFFICKING KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
DESPITE THESE HARDSHIPS,
BUSINESS IN MANY OF THE
COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE ALONG THE
BORDER ARE THRIVING, BUT WE NEED
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE
SURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TO BE
THE CASE.
SYMPATHY FOR DACA RECIPIENTS IS
RIGHT AND GOOD BECAUSE IN
AMERICA, WE DO NOT PUNISH
CHILDREN FOR THE MISTAKES OF
THEIR PARENTS.
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUNISH
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW
ADULTS AND HAVE BECOME PART OF
OUR COMMUNITIES.
BUT THOSE AMERICANS WHO LIVE
ALONG THE BORDER IN MY STATE
REALIZE THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
HAS CAUSED REAL TANGIBLE HARM IN
TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY, IN TERMS
OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND THEIR
WAY OF LIFE.
WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE MANNY
PADIA, THE BORDER PATROL SECTOR
CHIEF IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY,
IT'S HARD NOT TO REALIZE JUST
HOW MUCH IS REQUIRED, HOW MANY
MORE RESOURCES WE NEED TO
MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
AND OPERATIONAL CONTROL ALONG
THE BORDER.
AND I'LL SAY THIS, MADAM
PRESIDENT.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS
FAILED OVER THE YEARS TO LIVE UP
TO ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO
MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF OUR
BORDER.
AND SO TAXPAYERS IN MY STATE
HAVE TO STEP UP AND FILL THE GAP
LEFT BY THE FAILURE OF
LEADERSHIP AT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
FIX THAT IN THIS LEGISLATION.
FOLLOWING THE PARAMETERS THAT
THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT FOR
US.
THAT'S WHY DURING THIS WEEK'S
DEBATE, ENSURING ADDITIONAL
RESOURCES FOR BORDER SECURITY IS
AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THE
PUZZLE.
THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY IN THE
AREAS BETWEEN THE PORTS OF
ENTRY, BUT WE HAVE -- WELL,
MEXICO IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST
TRADING PARTNERS.
WE HAVE LEGITIMATE TRADE AND
WHICHERS THAT FLOWS BACK --
COMMERCE THAT FLOWS BACK AND
FORTH THE BORDER WITH MEXICO
THAT SUPPORTS FIVE MILLION
AMERICAN JOBS.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE CARTELS
HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO EXPLOIT
THAT AS WELL.
SO BECAUSE OF ANTIQUATED
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY AT
OUR PORTS OF ENTRY, MANY OF THEM
ARE VULNERABLE TO THE
IMPORTATION OF POISON, LITERALLY
DRUGS LIKE METHAMPHETAMINE,
COCAINE, HEROIN, AND THE LIKE
THAT'S TAKEN THE LIVES OF SO
MANY AMERICANS.
AND WE NEED TO DO MORE AND
BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO
MAINTAINING THOSE PORTS OF
ENTRY, UPGRADING THE
INFRASTRUCTURE, IMPROVING THE
TECHNOLOGY SO WE CAN INTERDICT
MORE OF THAT.
AGAIN, THE BORDER IS AS VARIED
AS ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD WITH
AREAS THAT ARE FLAT AND OPEN AND
AREAS THAT HAVE MOUNTAINS AND
ROLLING HILLS, RIVERS OBVIOUSLY,
AND TECHNOLOGY AS WE'VE COME TO
SEE AS TRANSFORMED OUR WAY OF
LIFE.
AND TECHNOLOGY CAN INCREASINGLY
BE THE ANSWER TO SUPPLEMENT
THOSE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE
BORDER PATROL THINKS ARE
NECESSARY.
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
DETECTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN
RURAL AREAS AND URBAN ONES.
IN URBAN AREAS YOU MIGHT JUST
HAVE A FEW SECONDS, THE BOARDER
PATROL TELLS US, BEFORE SOMEBODY
CAN CROSS THE BORDER AND ENTER
INTO THE UNITED STATES.
IN LARGE, OPEN AREAS, THERE'S
MORE OF A LAG TIME.
AND SO, PERHAPS, A FENCE OR SOME
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT AS
IMPORTANT.
TECHNOLOGY MIGHT BE MORE
IMPORTANT ALONG WITH THE BORDER
PATROL AGENTS THEMSELVES.
MY BASIC POINT IS THAT BOARDER
SECURITY IS COMPLEX.
FOR THOSE WHO THINK IT'S AS EASY
AS ONE, TWO, THREE, I WOULD
ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO, AS SOME OF
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE, AND
THAT IS TRAVEL TO THE BORDER.
WE'LL HOST YOU.
SEE IT FIRSTHAND TO SEE WHY IT'S
CRUCIAL THAT WE STRENGTHEN OUR
PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY, AND
INFRASTRUCTURE.
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF OUR
PRIORITIES.
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE
PRESIDENT FOR MAKING THIS ONE OF
HIS REQUIREMENTS AS WELL.
SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, MADAM
PRESIDENT, TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY
THE ANXIETY AND PLIGHT OF THESE
DACA RECIPIENTS BUT ALSO TO MAKE
OUR COUNTRY SAFER AND MORE
SECURE.
AND ALSO TO REFORM OUR LEGAL
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT
WILL HELP US ACCELERATE
THE ROLL OF THE DICE IN THE
DIVERSITY LOTTERY THAT MAKES
LITTLE SENSE GIVEN OUR NEED FOR
PEOPLE WITH JOB-BASED SKILLS AND
GRADUATE DEGREES AND OTHER
MERIT-BASED CRITERIA THAT WOULD
MAKE THEM VALUABLE TO THE UNITED
STATES IN ADDITION TO WINNING
THE LOTTERY.
SO, MADAM PRESIDENT, I HOPE
WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
OPPORTUNITY THIS WEEK.
TIME IS WASTING.
IT'S WEDNESDAY.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO WASTE
AT ALL.
MADAM PRESIDENT, I YIELD THE
FLOOR.
I'D NOTE THE ABSENCE OF A
QUORUM.
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE
CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL.
QUORUM CALL:
