welcome back last night the Senate Judiciary Committee released documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh including some of his views of the Watergate scandal according to the AP a 1999 article reveals an instance in which Cavanaugh said US versus Nixon may have been wrongly decided you'll remember that that decision led the Supreme Court to order President Nixon to hand over tape recordings to a federal court and ever since it has been referenced as one of the major cases that limits executive power Cavanaugh's views on executive privilege are being carefully looked at as he makes his way through the confirmation process joining me now to talk about this and everything else that went on this past week Democratic senator from Connecticut and member of the Judiciary Committee Senator Richard Blumenthal senator thank you so much for being with us tonight I want to start right there with this revelation from these documents that the Judiciary Committee has found about Cavanaugh's comments on the US versus Nixon case do you think that that should be applicable in his confirmation hearing it is of profound importance to these confirmation hearings the reason is very simply that US versus Nixon not only stands for the basic principle that the president must provide evidence that is relevant and cannot assert over broad claims of executive powers but also that no one is above the law no president is above the law and here we have judge Cavanaugh questioning whether it was rightly decided after a unanimous Supreme Court in an opinion written by the Chief Justice Warren Berger who was appointed by Nixon said that the president Richard Nixon must provide these tapes it is potentially a bombshell in these confirmation hearings there have been some indications that Senator Grassley is not interested in forcing the executive branch to turn over more additional documents for Democrats and Republicans on the committee to review and it's been reported that Mitch McConnell behind the scenes is potentially threatening to push the nomination vote until right before the midterm are you seeing the documents that you need to and do you think the Chuck Schumer should fight this to the point that you are facing down that vote right before the election well that's a really important question Casey first we have yet to see all the documents that we need and the recent rejection and withdrawal of the nomination of Ryan bounds he was nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals shows the importance of seeing all of the documents because his racial comments in the course of his past were extremely relevant to this nomination and the excessive haste in that instance an absence of adequate vetting shows the importance of seeing every single document here that we need to assess this nomination the American people deserve it and so far we have yet to see all the documents we need and chairman Grassley has yet to provide in my view the kind of cooperation we need if this nomination vote is delayed until literally the days or weeks before the midterm elections it will be the height of cynical manipulation in a vote that is probably the most important that most of us will ever cast because these are lifetime appointments the highest court in the land and again judge Kavanagh has indicated in the writing you just mentioned we just discussed as well as others that he is an outlier in many of his views out of the mainstream and the result of vetting by extreme right-wing groups such as overturning roe v wade and withdrawing many of the protections under the affordable care act so we deserve every document what's the behind-the-scenes thinking on what kind of impact of votes so close to the election would have I mean there has to be some tension in the Democratic caucus between those moderates facing re-election in red states who want to be out on the trail campaigning and those liberal potentially 2020 candidates that as we know there are a number of them in your caucus how is that playing out behind the scenes what we need to do is to bring this case to the American people about how Judge Cavanaugh has passed the Trump litmus test overturning roe v wade eliminating the protections for people who suffer from pre-existing conditions millions of Americans who suffer from obesity or heart disease or alcohol abuse and many other common conditions but the tension is really in my view exaggerated on the Democratic side I think our Republican colleagues are gonna have to answer to history this journey down the HBV will go through go through with pushing this to right before the elections I mean I hope not and I do have doubt there you go I mean closely as I have I mean I you know I just it seems to me like he makes these kinds of threats and he follows through on them Casey you may be right but let me just say that when I go to work every day I have to believe that as an institution our leadership and most particularly they were hope Republican leadership will recognize that we're answering not just to the politics of the moment but to history every one of us will be judged by history on this vote and my hope is that Mitch McConnell wants to be recognized as a leader not just a master politician a leader of conviction and conscience senator I want to change gears quickly before we have to wrap up here and but the events of the last week what we saw with with the president in helsinki and then what we saw in aspen from dan coates his Director of National Intelligence who was surprised by my colleague Andrea Mitchell and told that Vladimir Putin was had been invited to come here to the United States some Democrats have called for Dan coats to step down in protest do you agree with those calls I hope that Dan coats will stay he is a former colleague I know him as an individual of integrity and dedication to our country I have disagreed with him probably more often than I've agreed when he was a member of the US Senate but he has stayed true to the mission of the intelligence community Donald Trump likes to operate without intelligence frequently disregarding his briefings and keeping Dan Coates in the dark very humiliatingly but I'm gonna be supporting in fact introducing a resolution that will condemn any second visit by Vladimir Putin to the United States any meeting that rolls out the red carpet to Vladimir Putin while he is continuing to attack the United States as dan coats has said in ongoing and pervasive use of cyber objective and verifiable evidence that stan coats speaking truth to power I hope he stays in that job as long as he fulfills the oath of office to defend our country senator Blumenthal thank you so much for your time tonight really appreciate it and I of course will see you on Capitol Hill hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out
