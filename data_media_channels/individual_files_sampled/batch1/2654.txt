setting goals is the biggest waste of time on planet earth anymore shocked when I say that setting goals is a complete waste of time if you don't have a target destination so I say it like this have you ever gone on a vacation you didn't know where you were going and if that ever happened how did you pack so I don't know where I'm going I got here's my goals I'm going to set goals of getting surfboard getting skis getting hunting rifles getting fishing rods okay all those took time to research I spent resources I got them yeah I accomplish my goals where you going we're going rock climbing right so these goals did not help me effect they wait I wasted valuable hours of my life and valuable resources I could have spent getting me to my destination on stuff that was a complete waste so now think of it like this if I said we're going to Rome in two weeks all the goals self populate what do we need to do we got to get a passport visa we got to get plane tickets we got to get a hotel we got to figure out what we're going to eat we're going to see what we're going to go see so the goals self populate so stop wasting time trying to you know come up with goals just come up with a destination and a target of where you want to be and all your goals are self populated
