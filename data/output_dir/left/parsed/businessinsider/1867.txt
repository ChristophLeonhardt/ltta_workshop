go to your settings click messages and
scroll down to expire go to your
messages hold down the camera button to
record a video the receiver has the
option of keeping the video before it
self-destructs which will happen two
minutes after the receiver presses play
if you do the same thing with audio the
self-destruct feature only applies to
audio and video created within the
messaging thread so if you attach audio
or video created elsewhere it won't
disappear
