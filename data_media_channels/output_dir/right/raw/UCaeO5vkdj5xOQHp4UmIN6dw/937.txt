1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,310
- [Ami] Some of you may be wondering

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,140
why President Trump decided to
get us out of the Iran deal.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,860
Well, let's discuss it.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,880
In 2015, The United
States and President Obama

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,740
along with various other
countries signed the Iran deal.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,920
The deal was created in order to make sure

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,410
that Iran can never have the ability

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,060
to develop nuclear weapons.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,960
The IAEA which is the
nuclear watchdog of the UN

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,010
was given the task as
the enforcer of the deal.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,843
Let's just say

12
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:33,568
they have a spotty record
at that particular task.

13
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,765
♪ France got the bomb
but don't you grieve ♪

14
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,927
♪ 'cause they're on our side I believe ♪

15
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,099
♪ China got the bomb but have no fear ♪

16
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,441
♪ They can't wipe us out ♪

17
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,037
♪ for at least five years, who's next? ♪

18
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:51,037
♪ So Israels getting tense
wants one in self defense ♪

19
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:53,684
♪ The Lord is our
shepherd says the Psalm ♪

20
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:57,973
♪ But just in case we better get a bomb ♪

21
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:02,973
♪ Who's next, who's next,
who's next, who's next? ♪

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,820
- [Ami] The Iran deal's been lauded

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,470
as the only thing standing

24
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,202
between Iran and a nuclear weapon.

25
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,330
One of the chief reasons for optimism

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,530
is its unprecedented inspection
regime led by the IAEA.

27
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,920
For instance, they can
inspect any site at any time.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Well, as long as the Iranians

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,450
don't designate it a military site.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,595
And after the Iranians
exhaust their official inquiry

31
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:30,309
as to why that site was
chose in the first place

32
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,095
followed by a 24 day mandated await

33
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:36,180
before inspectors are
allowed into the site at all.

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,670
The actual time from inspection request

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,180
to boots on the ground?

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,010
Well that may take several
months and the Iranians,

37
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,760
they know how to use their time wisely.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,370
In 2003 the Lavizan facility in Iran

39
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,920
was outed as a nuclear weapons site.

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,720
The IAEA sought permission

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,770
to visit the site a year and a half later.

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,910
In the interim, publicly
available satellite imagery

43
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,060
showed that the entire site was raised

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,400
including the removal of the
first six feet of topsoil,

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,720
eliminating all traces of evidence.

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,020
The IAEA, after inspecting
the scrubbed down site

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,410
were satisfied and they considered
the matter to be closed.

48
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,100
But I didn't.

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,930
Now I'm not a nuclear expert

50
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,350
but I am playing one in this movie.

51
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,330
If you have Lavizan, there
was a satellite imagery

52
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,230
that showed evidence of a
nuclear weapons program.

53
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,320
Explain to the audience why you felt

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,010
the need to then dig the
first six feet of topsoil,

55
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,330
remove it, and then recover it up,

56
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,593
what would be the reasoning behind that?

57
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,750
- That is closed

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,250
and clearly the IAEA
report Director General

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,510
says that that was absolutely incorrect

60
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,880
and there was no evidence
of nuclear material,

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,070
nuclear activities

62
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,490
and you can read the agency's
report at the IAEA website.

63
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,920
- [Ami] But the report is meaningless

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,880
because you dumped all the evidence.

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,897
- No evidence, you can go to the website

66
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:03,470
and if you're interested

67
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,814
I can show you a different copy of it.

68
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:10,150
- Why raise the area and
then cover it with soil?

69
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,150
- Look, I think that you're
bringing obsolete issue but--

70
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:17,360
- [Ami] How is that obsolete?

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,670
- That's very old stuff,

72
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,180
the important thing as I go back again

73
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,730
rather than you and me discuss about it

74
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,930
it is better to leave to
the experts, inspectors.

75
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,320
- They're supposed to sound the alarm

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,530
when illicit nuclear
activity is discovered

77
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,070
but so far it's been very
reluctant to do that.

78
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,340
- I think it's established,

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,390
it's clear you're not
building nuclear weapons

80
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,970
and that you made the argument very fine

81
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,140
but if you did build a nuclear weapon,

82
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,990
what country would you blow up first?

83
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,630
- The question is wrong.

84
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,080
- So I have your word, you are
not building nuclear weapons?

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,220
- Certainly 100%.

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,020
I'd like to reject any
of these allegations.

87
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,910
- Like the IAEA, that's
good enough for me.

88
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,970
- A way out is to have a time out.

89
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,910
Iran will take a time out.

90
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,560
International community
will also take a time out.

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,380
- [Mark] Let the United Nations
handle this incompetently.

92
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,540
- Supporting the idea of a time out.

93
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,420
- And allow Iran to have nuclear weapons.

94
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,680
- It was all about the process,
it was not about results.

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,540
The results were worthless.

96
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,600
- Now are they intending to kill someone

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,470
or are they only intending
to defend themselves?

98
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,390
But how do you know whether
they have that intention or not?

99
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,370
It's impossible to say

100
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,650
such and such a country
has that intention.

101
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,593
Then again what is the intention?

102
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,300
- [Ami] Only God knows.
- Exactly.

103
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,940
- [Ami] And anyone who reads.

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,663
So Americans can sleep soundly.

105
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,470
- [Ami] The IAEA is on the watch.

106
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,303
- Yes.

107
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,903
- Process is an outcome at the UN.

108
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,863
It is a way of avoiding and
kicking a problem down the road.

109
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,580
A single country like Iran
can play to that, they can say

110
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,156
all we need to do is buy some time.

111
00:05:15,156 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Ami] And the Iran deal did just that.
