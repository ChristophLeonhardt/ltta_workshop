if people are trying to murder you then perhaps you can take a little satisfaction from the facts that they are officially heroes of the Russian Federation much of the life of dr. Alexander Myshkin was put on display in Westminster housing records car insurance documents even the swampy village in the Arctic where he grew up all of it providing a body of evidence that he was involved in the assassination attempt on circus cripple this was a man who had claimed he'd abandon attempts to visit Salisbury Cathedral because of the snow and slush yet the village he came from is in permafrost most of the year still he rose through specialist medical school spent time undercover in Ukraine and the breakaway republic of trans nestor before being honored it seems by helping to squirrel outed President Viktor Yanukovych out of Ukraine to exile in Russia in 2014 but this of course all hinges on the theory that the investigators who come out with it all right we're absolutely sure I mean from the photographs we have alone I mean we haven't be able to publish all the photographs because it would've ile some of our sources but we do have multiple photographs showing him he's got two very distinct blemishes on his face on his chin and on the bottom of his cheek his ear also has a kind of little mark on it this visible in all the photographs got she had digital analysis of the photographs done as well which confirm it's the same person it continues to be a bad time for the GRU intelligence agency having also been found out for trying to hack the OPCW chemical weapons building in the Netherlands it all looks amateurish the British government feels like it is in fightback mode it's not necessarily a huge problem convincing people in Russia who will want to believe their government anyway I think the rest of the world and the global audience I think the evidence of Russian involvement is now overwhelming and we've had hundreds of GRU officers named in the past few weeks anyway and if you're trying to run a secret organization if your secret agents are no longer secret then you have a problem of course you might argue that it's a shame that colonel anatoly chappy gir and dr. alexander Myshkin if that's their real names tried to present themselves as unhappy tourists called Bashir off and Petrov in Salisbury for entirely benign reasons after all to the in states both men are heroes and Sergei scribble was a traitor but they can hardly change their story now of course the people who'll be most pleased about all this are the British governments who've always said that the Russians did it and can now sit back and relax as everybody else suggests that Russian intelligence is just debating competence the Russians themselves have always maintained that the British can't provide any evidence but if this isn't proof it's really difficult to know what is lawrence lee al jazeera in london
