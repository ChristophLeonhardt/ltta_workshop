AND IN SEPTEMBER IN PYONGYANG,
HIGH HOPES BECOMING MORE FIRM
MIGHT COME FROM HIM.
>> MILLIONS OF MIGRANTS TO STAY
IN THE UK, LEADERS CAN'T MAKE A
DEAL ON BREXIT.
JILLIAN: WHAT IS THE POINT OF
BREXIT TO STRENGTHEN BORDERS?
REACTION, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR
AND UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY LEADER
NIGEL FARAGE.
HOW DID IT GET TO THIS POINT?
>> Reporter: SOMEBODY
NEGOTIATING BREXIT WAS WEEK.
THE IDEA WAS IF WE HAD A DEAL
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ON
TRADE, PEOPLE WOULD BE ALLOWED
TO STAY.
NOW WE ARE TOLD EVEN IF THERE IS
NO DEAL NOT ONLY CAN 3.8 MILLION
PEOPLE STAY BUT THEY WILL BE
ALLOWED TO BRING THEIR EXTENDED
FAMILIES, THEY HAVE FULL ACCESS
TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND BENEFIT
SYSTEM AND EVEN WORSE, THERE IS
NO PROPOSED CUT OFF DATE FROM
WHICH ANY OF THIS IS CHANGING.
IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE BECAUSE
THE BRITISH PUBLIC
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED WITH
BREXIT, TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR
BORDERS, REDUCE THE HUGE INFLOW
COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND
THEY ARE BEING WILLFULLY IGNORED
BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND
BRITISH PARLIAMENT.
ROB: TERESA MAY WANTS TO WATER
IT DOWN AS MUCH AS SHE CAN.
UP WITH A PRIME MINISTER WHO
VOTED IN MAY AND WHEN ASKED EVEN
TODAY DOES SHE BELIEVE IN BREXIT
CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION.
I WALKED INTO A SHOP TO BUY
SOMETHING AND THE ONE BEHIND THE
COUNTER SAID OF DONALD TRUMP WAS
NEGOTIATING FOR US WE WOULD HAVE
IT ALL SORTED OUT BY NOW.
EUROPE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS
THAT RESULTED IN 182 DEATHS, AND
814 INJURIES AND IN 2015 ISIS
EXPLOITED REFUGEE ROOTS TO GO
BACK AND FORTH FROM SYRIA TO
GERMANY UNHINDERED.
YOU GAVE SPEECHES ON THAT POINT
IN THE PAST.
>> IN APRIL AND MAY 2015 THE EU
WERE BEGINNING TO SAY OUR DOORS
ARE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO COMES,
WILL USE THE MIGRANT CRISIS AS A
MEANS OF GETTING OPERATIVES INTO
EUROPE, PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO
BELIEVE THEM.
THE AUSTRALIANS DID WHEN THEY
HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM, NO ONE
WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY, NONE OF
THAT HAPPENED AND WE DO NOT HAVE
A CLUE HOW MANY BAD PEOPLE ARE
BEING LET INTO EUROPE.
IT IS MADNESS AND ANOTHER REASON
WHY BREXIT IS THE COMMON SENSE
AND SAFEST THING TO DO FOR OUR
PEOPLE.
ROB: THE ANTI-BREXITERS WILL
ADMIT YOU CAN'T KNOW WHO IS
COMING IN IF YOU OPEN THIS PLACE
UP TO ALL THIS MIGRATION, YOU
CAN'T KNOW AND THE PROOF IS IN
THOSE NUMBERS WE JUST GAVE AND
PUT IT TO THE PEOPLE AGAIN, ARE
WE COMFORTABLE BRINGING IN A LOT
OF PEOPLE KNOWING SOME
PERCENTAGE OF THEM WILL TRY TO
DO HORRIBLE THINGS WHEN THEY ARE
HERE?
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE
BELIEVE WE ARE ALL GLOBAL
CITIZENS, LOVELY AND FLUFFY AND
NICE, WE SHOULD GO WHEREVER WE
WENT AND MOVE FREELY AROUND THE
WORLD AND WHEN YOU LINK THIS
DIRECTLY TO TERRORISM OF ANY
KIND THEY SIMPLY SAY YOU ARE
RACIST, TURNAROUND AND WALK
AWAY.
THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO ENGAGE
THIS CONVERSATION BUT PEOPLE IN
THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE IN MIDDLE
ENGLAND, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY
BELIEVE.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE
