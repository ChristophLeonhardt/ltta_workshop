first it was an antique emember assaulting college Republicans with paint then it was a professor throwing fake blood on an NRA lobbyist house and now this is the third week in a row where I'm bringing you a story of a petulant progressive vandalizing something because using words is never enough for these people except this time it might have been actual blood judging by that cloth around the students hand that University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill history PhD students name is Maya little ironically enough UNC police arrested and charged her with vandalism of the silent Sam Confederate statue but here's what happened when they tried to cordon off the monument for cleaning no unfortunately that was not a clip from your local daycare these are 18 to 22 year olds and I think little is actually 25 UNC Chancellor Carol folt says that she's prohibited by law from taking down the statue or else I bet she would in a heartbeat but another cancerous tentacle of the totalitarian left might get to it before students state or even the administration and that's the professor's 17 unc professors wrote a letter to folt saying they would take matters into their own hands and tear down the statue at some unspecified time if it wasn't taken down by the end of february we do not fear arrest indeed we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the commitment that the Carolina faculty has to the well-being of its students and the principles that make this university great oh you don't fear arrest how brave I guess that's why you're not attaching names too this little statement you know this kind of reminds me of New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu who tore down Confederate statues sometimes under the cover of darkness he was of course awarded for his heroic efforts with the JFK courage award to be fair to Maya little at least she identified herself now a lot of people brush off stories of Confederate statue vandalism or removal by saying oh well why are we glorifying or romanticizing traitors but remember the left's not going to stop with Lee and Jackson they didn't in Shaw its Vil we're perpetually aggrieved cry boys have vandalized the Thomas Jefferson statue on multiple occasions this isn't an attack on certain individuals no this is an attack on history and if you keep giving these mental children candy they're only going to ask for more even if it's super unhealthy so as with every child there are only two options spank them in this case figuratively with superior logic or when asked of you as a voter or official will concede to their cultural marxism you just say sorry Stalin not today for campus unmasked I'm Robson Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
