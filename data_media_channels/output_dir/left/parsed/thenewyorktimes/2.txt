“Hello and welcome to
‘Internetting After Dark.’
If you don’t know
by now, I’m Amanda.”
“I’m Shane.”
“And we’re here to give you a
closer look inside the making
of ‘Internetting.’”
“And this is our season finale
of ‘Internetting After Dark.’”
“And after this, I never have
to wear this sweater again.
So should we get started?”
“Let’s do it.”
“One of the videos we
made was about babies,
and how it’s like
pretty horrifying how
some parents take
videos of them
and put them here. From
All Things Fascinating:”
“‘I feel the same way for cute
kitten and cute dog videos.
I really can’t put my finger
on what’s wrong about them,
but after watching too many of
them, I just feel depressed.’”
“It’s a similar
sensation to watching
a baby fail, where you know
that the subject of the video
can’t consent.
I’m just thinking about
how funny they are.”
“Well, that’s the thing,
though, they’re super joyful.
I say that if you
watch too many of them,
you feel depressed
in the same way
that if you eat too
much birthday cake,
you feel depressed.
In any event, inspired by
these animal prank videos,
I did videotape a
prank of Wanda.”
“You pranked Wanda?”
“I don’t know that
you did it right.”
“I don’t think I
did it right either.
So I didn’t have a cucumber.”
“So we also made a
video about drag.”
“And we got some really
great and very thoughtful
YouTube comments.
“Orion Rummler wrote on
Twitter: ‘Awesome video
and writing, but
it also would have
been cool to address
RuPaul’s transphobic comments
as a relative consequence
of his mainstream drag,
especially since so many
straight people consume
his content.
Seems that convo is lacking.’
For those of you who
aren’t familiar with it,
in an interview,
RuPaul had
said he probably wouldn’t
allow trans women
or cisgendered
women onto his show.
He put out a tweet that
doubled down on that idea.
Shortly thereafter,
he put out a tweet
essentially apologizing
for his previous tweet.
In previous cuts
of this video,
we had included this
particular topic.
By the time we got
to the final cut,
it felt to us like it was
too far afield from our more
narrow argument.
So we had considered it,
unfortunately we just
didn’t really have
time to address
that particular
controversy in this video.
But we’re going
to put some links
to a few articles on this
very topic in the comments.
And if you’re looking for a
great short history of how
being trans and
being a drag queen
have interacted
with each other,
I would point you towards my
friend Charlene Incarnate’s
essay on the topic.
And please keep
talking about it.
Gunnar Stenger wrote, ‘Since
the series is about internet,
you must not forget
that internet is global.
You can’t mention drag
without bringing up Thailand
and Brazil.’”
“I love this comment.”
“Excellent point.
Talk about a blind spot.”
“It also gave us
the opportunity
to check out some
amazing video
from some incredible drag
queens around the world.”
“So we also made a video
about modern celebrity
on the internet.
A big feature of
this video was
Cameo, an incredible
service that
allows you to pay low-level
celebrities to send you
messages.”
“Several levels
of celebrities.”
“Mid-level?
Anyway, one of the celebs that
I solicited a personal video
from, or what I thought
was a personal video,
was Dina Lohan,
Lindsay’s mom.”
“I just want to give you
a shout out from the Lohan
family.
I just got back from
Greece, opening Lohan Beach
Clubs with Lindsay.
I manage Ali and my son,
Dakota, and great things
come are to come
for both children.
I hope you and your
family are well.
Wishing love, laughter,
and great health.”
“If you notice, she doesn’t
even say my name, or anything
that I had suggested that
she put in the video.
Which makes me wonder,
has she sent this Cameo
to more than one person?
If you have gotten a
suspicious Cameo from Dina
Lohan, please let us know.
I would love to
solve this mystery.
So our final
‘Internetting’ video
was about surprise videos
and why I hate them.
And at the end
of the video, we
asked you to tell us what
you hate that everybody
else seems to love.”
“Ian Lack wrote, ‘I hate
gender reveal videos.’
Everbury 51 wrote, ‘Gender
reveal parties’ videos are
reactionary and
cringe worthy.’
Well, first of all,
they should be called
the sex reveal parties.”
“I spoke with someone
recently who was pregnant.
And when you’re pregnant, you
have to do all these tests.
And the only thing
that you can find out
is that something is bad,
like something has gone wrong.
So with like a
sex reveal party,
even though, as Ian
Lack says, ‘People
are getting excited
about nothing,’ there
is something I think nice
about the nothing, in that
it’s not like, oh,
either everything’s O.K.,
or it’s bad.”
“The sex reveal party is
like a coping mechanism
for like too much
data that you’re
getting about your baby.”
“All the other sort of
tests that you have to do.”
“And in that respect, aren’t
we all just looking for ways
to mitigate our
anxieties about having
too much information
in our lives?
This season was the first
time on ‘Internetting’
that we interacted with the
comments section on YouTube.
So, thank you guys so much for
leaving comments, interacting
with us, talking to us,
and mostly for thoughtfully
watching your videos, and
responding to it, which
I was super impressed by.”
“Yeah.
Thank you for not
being horrible monsters.
One thing we heard
over and over again
was how much you
all of the theme
song, which was written and
recorded by Shane O’Neill.
So we are giving you
all a special gift,
which has access to the
theme song on SoundCloud.
You can find it
in the comments.
So we wanted to present
an award to the greatest
commenter, the person
who was there with us
video after video.
And that award goes to — “
“All Things Fascinating,
congratulations on winning — ”
“Congratulations.”
“ — the first ever
‘Internetting’ Super Fan Award.
You deserve it.”
“So Shane, what’s the best
thing you saw on the internet
this week?”
“Well, Amanda, I went to
an event in Los Angeles
recently, where I
met Meredith Gene
Levine, who is a
Fanthropologist
of online culture.
She introduced me to a new
genre I’d never seen before:
Video footage of
trash being picked up
in residential neighborhoods,
with thrash metal
being played underneath it.
Inspiring, gorgeous,
satisfying and super
confusing.
How about you, Amanda,
what’s the best thing
you’ve seen on the
internet this week?”
“Oh, a bunch of round
boys on Instagram.
There was like a round duck.
There’s some round
seals, round rabbits.
There are a lot of
round dogs, which
I think is kind of
cheating, because you
can cut their hair in
whatever way you want.
I think that’s it.
Thank you all so
much for watching.
We really appreciate it.
That is the end of
‘Internetting Season Two.’”
“Thanks so much for watching.”
“Bye.”
“Internetting
with Amanda Hess.
After dark.”
