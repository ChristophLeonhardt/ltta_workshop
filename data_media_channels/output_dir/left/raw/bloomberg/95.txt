00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,380
First, let’s rewind to two decades ago,

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,080
Alan Greenspan famously warned of what he called...

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,620
Now the former Federal Reserve chairman says
investors worried about excess in stocks might

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,820
be better off worrying about bonds.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,620
people betting that prices will only go up.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,760
Like the infamous tulip mania in the 17th
century.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,381
It happened in Holland...where prices for
tulip bulbs skyrocketed...and then suffered

8
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,969
a spectacular collapse.

9
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:43,239
The problem - prices of tulips got way out
of line with their intrinsic value.

10
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:46,519
Prices of bonds… well they have been climbing
for decades.

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:51,309
In recent years borrowing costs for governments
have hit record lows in many countries and

12
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:55,030
we can easily point to two basic reasons for
that.

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,819
One: since the financial crisis, central banks
have been buying trillions and trillions of

14
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:04,160
dollars worth of bonds to stimulate the global
economy, that's boosted demand for assets

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,340
in a massive way.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,930
Driving bond prices up and borrowing costs
much, much lower.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,430
Two: low inflation.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,640
Consider inflation the enemy of bond investors,
when consumer prices rise that eats into the

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,130
real income of bond investors and market participants
demand higher interest payments from borrowers

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,440
to compensate them.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:30,520
For years now, inflation has remained stubbornly
low, that's a fertile environment for a strong

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,780
bond market.

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,880
Now Greenspan's basic argument is that we are moving into different environment.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,800
And environment where

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,800
Combine that with central banks beginning
to remove stimulus and end bond buying programs

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
and the argument is essentially that it could
spell trouble for the bond market.

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,730
Right now you'll struggle to find an investor
who will tell you what they see in bonds is

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,950
reminiscent of the tulip mania of centuries
ago but most accept the bond market is very

29
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,230
expensive.

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:00:00,000
Greenspan thinks it's unsustainable and when
it pops, it will be bad for everyone.
