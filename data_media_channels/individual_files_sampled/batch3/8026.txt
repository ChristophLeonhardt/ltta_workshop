MACCALLUM WILL MODERATE THE DEBATE AND MACCALLUM WILL BREAK IT DOWN IN A SPECIAL STARTING AT 7:30 EASTERN TIME. JILLIAN: A CANDIDATE IN CALIFORNIA SPARKING OUTRAGE AFTER SAYING COP KILLERS DON'T DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE JOB. LAWRENCE STRAUSS SAYING QUOTEMAC I FEEL SORRY FOR THE OFFICER, PART OF THE RISK THEY TAPE BEING AN OFFICER OF THE LAW. HERE TO WEIGH IN HIS LAW-ENFORCEMENT PANEL DR. DARREN PORCHER AND STEVE ROGERS, FORMER MEMBER OF THE JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE. YOU SAW THE STATEMENT, TWO PAGE STATEMENT AFTER HE MADE THESE COMMENTS TRYING TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION. HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL? IT IS HYPERBOLE BECAUSE THE DEATH PENALTY HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD SINCE 2014 IN CALIFORNIA. HE IS TRYING TO PAY THIS TO HIS BASE BUT LOOKING AT WHERE HE IS COMING FROM IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING POLICE OFFICERS IT IS TROUBLING BECAUSE POLICE OFFICERS ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE, SOMETHING STEVE CAN ATTEST TO. POLICE OFFICERS PUT THEMSELVES ON THE LINE EVERY DAY. THE DEATH OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IS ADEPT TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. WE NEED DISTRICT ATTORNEYS SIGNING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS FIGHT AGAINST CRIME. Reporter: HE TALKS ABOUT THE SERVICE AND DEDICATION TO THE COMMUNITY, THE RETIRED DEPUTY SHERIFF SHOT ON THE JOB AND A LOT OF CONNECTION TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY BUT DOESN'T SEEM HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY DO AND HOW MUCH RISK IS INVOLVED. WE DON'T BECOME POLICE OFFICERS TO GET KILLED BUT TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FROM GETTING KILLED AND WE DON'T BECOME POLICE OFFICERS BE LEAVING AND WANTING TO CD As LIKE HIMSELF AND JUDGES RELEASE PRISONERS, CAREER CRIMINALS, GET THEM BACK ON THE STREETS AND THESE PEOPLE KILL AGAIN. HIS STATEMENT AFTER THE FACT IS HE REALIZES HE MADE A BIG MISTAKE AND BY HIS STATEMENT AND THE ACTIONS OF JUDGES WHO RELEASE THESE BAD PEOPLE, PUTTING POLICE OFFICERS AT RISK. JILLIAN: 23 OFFICERS HAVING KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY THIS YEAR, DO YOU COMPARE THAT TO 35 TOTAL IN 2017, THAT IS DISTURBING. WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THE LIFE OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER? WHEN WE CONSIDER THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IT AFFORDS PROTECTIONS AS A SOCIETY AND THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS TO COMMIT ATROCITIES AGAINST SOCIETY AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR POLICE OFFICERS IT IS NECESSARY WE AS A COMMUNITY AND THE NATION STAND BEHIND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR JOBS THEY PARTAKE IN. TO COP KILLERS DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY? THEY DESERVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND JUDGES WHO RELEASE THESE INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREET, TALKING ABOUT JUDGES, IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THEM CIVILLY AND COMMONLY LIABLE BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE, CREATING FOR POLICE OFFICERS ON THE STREETS. THE MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR PROFESSION DON'T SIGN UP TO BE HURT OR KILLED OR RECEIVE LESS JUSTICE THAN FELLOW CITIZENS.
