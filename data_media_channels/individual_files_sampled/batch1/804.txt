let's look at why road safety is such a sensitive issue in Bangladesh more than 25,000 people have been killed on its roads in the past three and a half years that's 20 people a day dying and more than 62,000 have been injured on the road Oh Jonas now via Skype from Dhaka is Shaheed all Elam he is a photographer and social activists so as we've been saying these protests were sparked by two teens who were killed in a road accident but is this all about road safety or is there something larger going on here very much larger this has been going on for a very very long time it's an unelected government so they do not really have a mandate to rule but they've been taking on by brute force the looting of the bank's the ganking of the media you mentioned just now that mobile internet disconnect is currently switched off the extrajudicial killings the disappearances the need to get protection money at all levels bribery at all levels corruption in education it's a never-ending list it's it's been huge so it really is that pent up inner energy emotion anger that has been left loose this particular incident sad as it is is really the foul that allowed things to go through very recently there was another very big protest about the quota because the quota system is rigged in such a way that only people close to the party in power get to get guff and jobs and there is a disproportionate amount of jobs going to them so ordinary people protested that would very brutally brought down under pressure the Prime Minister offered reforms but then reneged on so this time that's also part of the reason so this time when the students did go on protests again it went to a situation where they cannot control it and the Prime Minister has promised that she will see to the demands but of course people normally believe she has no credibility she's made promises big it's not been accepted so now they don't do it but I think what we need to look at is what's happening in the street today the police specifically asked for help from these armed goons to combat unarmed students demanding safe roads I mean how ridiculous is that today I was in the street there are people with machetes in in their hands chasing unarmed students and the police are standing by what had happened in some cases they're actually helping it up I mean I've been under this morning there was tear gassing and I saw the police going ganging up trying to catch these amount students whereas these armed goons are going out wielding sticks and machetes are walking past so what do you think things are going to go from here because these these protests appear to have spread across the country quite spontaneously and without any kind of central leadership here this is part of the challenge that the government is is dealing with in that this is this is so so grassroots in in in in in the way that it has spread well I think the gunman has miscalculated it it suddenly felt that fear was in that repression would have been enough but I think you cannot tame an entire nation in this manner and they of course are approaching elections so the nearer it gets the elections the more sensitive they are they know if there is a fair and free election they will lose but they haven't got an exit plan because they've lived room for so long that if they do lose they will be torn apart so they have to hang on by any means so that's exactly what they're doing they they are clinging on using the entire might of the system plus the armed goons at their disposal good to speak with you Shaheed or Allen joining us there from Dhaka
