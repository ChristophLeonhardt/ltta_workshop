what I'm going to tell to every 20 year
old watching is that you don't have to
burn out to succeed that in fact when
you get all the sleep you need when you
recharge yourself I promise you you're
going to be more effective more
successful healthier happier and you're
going to enjoy your life because life is
a dance between making it happen and
letting it happen and it's good to
remember that my biggest mistakes when
mistakes are made when I was tired you
know hiring the wrong people and being
too irritable and making the wrong
decisions these are all mistakes that I
remember making when was running on
empty and I just wanted to check another
thing of my to-do list
