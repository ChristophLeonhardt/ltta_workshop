managerial people then whether they are
broad I'm ready to speak to everyone I'm
ready to tell my story
- happy body
my father also both of them my younger
sisters
sure so deities that I design my
father's mother tree all day and I my
late sister during 2014
she wanted a DS virus in Guinea our
family among us no one the gods know if
whether this is an Ebola at a time I was
in Freetown University of Surrey on to
seven days everybody kept sick
39 in number
my father called me to do it that time
it was only to unbalance district I took
a photo by starting to took them two by
two
may I finish - to the end to the
hospital
I got this virus true from my family
and they are all discharged I asked
discharge officer I want to see my
family that Erickson they are all
possibly
so I said your mother she's alive I came
back to the community
and people we are be standing on the
roads looking at me or look at the
survival don't touch him
before we have been sitting on the
ground if like
I mentioned on the road sitting down I
said instead everything what is your
problem
I said that really because he's a baller
survivor right now he don't have a job
even something to eat to feed his family
his mother and know him before as a
protection journalist so I brought him
in the radio to be such practicing how
to blue cast have to talk to your
campaign Ebola survivor to convince
people that distinguish on we go down I
have 15 orphans and presently with their
loss their families all of them all of
their families as it is not easy really
for us to move our lives on technology
we have streets Chilean and also the
abused ones also like domestic violence
the way the beating traffic and that's
it's not easy okay so this one was
abused by her mother the two fingers we
are born by the power to turn with us we
have more than 500 survivors this
organization takes care of them

hurmati the monomer Natalia from your
chosen from again to being a very
changeable
everybody that survived from the Ebola
testing man nobody wants to go near
there nobody wants to talk to them we
are going out to schools to hospitals to
marketplaces talking to people not to
stigmatize they're not to be away from
them they are human beings they are not
having the values anymore
we know the mentality in our country a
whole lot of people i'ma say 60% are not
educated so by you having an Ebola with
the little knowledge they have they will
be so afraid of him that you're a
survivor maybe the other tendency that
you transfer the virus to them so does
writing they do face the stigmatization
very seriously

condominium cold it's relative
I let University 2014 I was in mass
communication I have no money to

mr. literally heads
since we have been played in November
2016 and all this time we have no time
to train as a team and we have no time
to please I'm a friendly match sometimes
if we get to defeat then if you Punto if
you are a player and you happen to miss
a ball neither to score a goal those who
are standing outside the field of those
dots in the most dissimilar survival is
so weak today the average arrival still
have to play with humble ions since they
create their teams they have been ever
play against the Ebola survivors and we
we are hoping that we are to play this
game successfully and without no
injuries and without no abusive language
I believe we can win this game
like a fast some of us were seriously
afraid of them but now there are humans
like us cannot aspire away from them
there are humans the more we talk to
them the more they feel happy today is
my very big happiest day in my life
because I'm seeing Michael in survival
and 3d origins we need to play and laugh
we need to hold each other's
so now the given and against us
five four so if no problem we are guys
the whole nation let enough against both

suffer forget education will suffer
forget with all my heart right now

survival we although we have a survival
the Ebola survival but don't call those
people people a survival we are always
here now

you all
