1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
I want to start by looking forward to
Tuesday president Trump is going to

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,030
speak to world leaders his first-ever UN
General Assembly meeting during his

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,690
campaign he had some pretty harsh
criticism for the UN listen to what he

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,510
told eight-pack last year he utter
weakness and incompetence of the United

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,080
Nations the United Nations is not a
friend of democracy it's not a friend to

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,240
freedom it's not a friend even to the
United States of America we're as you

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,489
know it has its home and it surely is
not a friend to Israel will the

8
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,170
president stick by his America first
message when he appears before the UN

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,860
this coming week well I think you have
to look at the fact that what he said at

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,449
the time was accurate I mean I think we
saw United Nations where the United

11
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,170
States was giving over 25 percent of the
funding and was being utterly

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,399
disrespected a United Nations that was
bashing Israel every chance they get a

13
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,910
United Nations that talked a lot but
didn't have a lot of action and now we

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,760
can say it is a new day at the UN what
you are now seeing is the Israel the

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,260
Israel bashing has become more balanced
you've got a United Nations that's

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,860
action-oriented we've passed two
resolutions on North Korea just in the

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,720
last month and you also have a United
Nations that is totally moving towards

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,869
reform you have a secretary-general
who's come out with a massive reform

19
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,380
package we said that we needed to get
value for our dollar and what we're

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,530
finding is the international community
is right there with us in support of

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,750
reform so it is a new day at the UN I
think that the pleas that he made in

22
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,079
terms of trying to see change that the
United Nations have been heard and I

23
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,100
think what we'll do is see him respond
to that come on Tuesday let's talk about

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,470
North Korea the UN as you well know
voted 15 to 0 on Monday to impose a new

25
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,990
set of sanctions on North Korea you said
this will cut deep but the president is

26
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,560
not so sure listen to what he said this
week

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,960
we think it's just another very small
step not a big deal I don't know if it

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,360
has any impact but certainly it was nice
to get a 15 to nothing vote but those

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,270
sanctions are nothing compared to what
ultimately will have to happen so

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,570
ambassador Haley what is the
administration's position are the North

31
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,790
Korea sanctions something that will cut
deep or not a big deal well I think you

32
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,720
know the facts are the facts so you look
at it from the first sanctions bill that

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,150
was the largest ever that we had done to
North Korea was a billion dollars and

34
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,350
was one that really was a punch in the
gut to North Korea this one which we

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,290
passed in a week was 1.3 billion dollars
and that didn't count the reduction of

36
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,620
30% of the oil which was made up of 55
percent reducing their diesel oil and

37
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,370
their gasoline that they used to move
the missiles the trucks that go and move

38
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,140
all of the equipment so you take that
with the elimination of joint ventures

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,880
the laborers which we consider
modern-day slavery all taken away you

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,370
look at all of those things that total
90 percent of North Korea's trade is

41
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,290
being cut off so we have economically
strangled North Korea at this point and

42
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,519
they have said as much I think what the
president saying is look we've done all

43
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,420
this but we can do a whole lot more and
so just to be clear what you just

44
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,560
described you don't agree that that's
not a big deal oh I think everybody in

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,860
the international community sees what a
big deal it is but also we know the

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,459
importance is enforcement and North
Korea is already starting to feel the

47
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,000
pinch it's the reason you see them
reacting the way they are but I think

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,420
this has not only been a kick to North
Korea this was a real hit to China they

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,540
had to take a real hit when it comes to
the fact that they do 90 percent of

50
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,650
trade with North Korea that's been
reduced on their end - so a lot of

51
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,190
people feeling this a lot of countries
feeling this but the most important

52
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,739
thing 15 to 0 United strong and North
Korea has pretty much been cut off from

53
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,209
the world the president said last month
that North Korea would face fire and

54
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,530
fury if it continues to threaten the US
and its allies well since the president

55
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,340
said that North Korea has really done
nothing but threatened the US and its

56
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,150
allies North Korea threatened Guam North
Korea fired two missiles

57
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,310
over Japan and tested a hydrogen bomb so
was the president fire and fury remark

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,180
an empty threat it was not an empty
threat what we were doing was being

59
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,320
responsible where North Korea's being
irresponsible and reckless we were being

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,889
responsible by trying to use every
diplomatic possibility that we could

61
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,669
possibly do we've pretty much exhausted
all the things that we could do at the

62
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,289
Security Council at this point now I
said yesterday I'm perfectly happy

63
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:40,380
kicking this over to general mattis
because he has plenty of military

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,150
options so I think that the fire in fury
while he said this is what we can do to

65
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,900
North Korea we wanted to be responsible
and go through all diplomatic means to

66
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,680
get their attention first if that
doesn't work general mattis will take

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,010
care of it well by saying general mattis
will take care of it you're talking

68
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,340
about the Pentagon and you're talking
about a military option is that what

69
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,360
fire and fury meant you have to ask the
president what fire arm fury met but I

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,580
think we all know that basically if
North Korea keeps on with this reckless

71
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,680
behavior if the United States has to
defend itself or defend its allies in

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,910
any way North Korea will be destroyed
and we all know that and none of us want

73
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,199
that none of us want war but we also
have to look at the fact that you are

74
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,970
dealing with someone who is being
reckless irresponsible and is continuing

75
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,990
to give threats not only to the United
States but to all of their allies so

76
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,130
something is going to have to be done
we're trying every other possibility

77
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,580
that we have but there's a whole lot of
military options on the table

78
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,760
ambassador Haley's stick around there's
a lot more to talk to you about

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:50,570
including the president's tweets and
whether they make her job harder

80
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,710
and we're back with US ambassador to the
United Nations nikki Haley ambassador

81
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,210
Haley let's talk about the latest terror
attack in London the fifth attack in

82
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,890
Great Britain this year President Trump
responded to the attack with the tweet

83
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,960
and here's what he said another attack
in London by looser terrorists these are

84
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,220
sick and demented people who were in the
sights of Scotland Yard must be

85
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,200
proactive we saw British Prime Minister
Theresa May he scoped she scolded the

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,940
president for his response saying it is
never helpful for anybody to speculate

87
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,260
about an ongoing investigation we know
that British intelligence is reluctant

88
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,010
to share information lately with the
u.s. because of president Trump's

89
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,870
conduct do tweets like this make it
harder for people like you to work with

90
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,890
allies around the world on important
issues well I think that you have to

91
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,800
understand that the president can
communicate in any form that he wishes

92
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,240
and if he uses Twitter I think what you
saw was a reaction to the fact that this

93
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,410
is terrible and we cannot let terrorist
attacks become part of our normal day

94
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,170
and when you see the number of these it
makes the president more and more

95
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,790
assured that he has to do everything he
can he can to keep Americans safe and so

96
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,560
he was concerned for for the UK he's
concerned for the terrorist attacks that

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,160
keep happening all over Europe and he
wanted to make sure that he had their

98
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,669
back and that he was showing strength
and so I think as they move forward

99
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,700
certainly we're always going to be their
allies we're always going to have their

100
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,590
back but we have to be very careful we
cannot allow terrorist attacks to be a

101
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,510
part of our everyday life do you wish
that the president was more careful in

102
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,080
suggesting information about the
investigation that is ongoing obviously

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,640
the British prime minister wished he
were he was well I look the president

104
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,450
would not want to do any harm to the
investigation let's be clear so if he

105
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,030
goes out and he gets emotional and
passionate about the fact that he's

106
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,800
upset at what happened in the UK I mean
of course that's what he put out there

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,340
but there was no ill intent with that I
think it was the fact that he was just

108
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,060
very concerned and very disturbed that
these terrorist attacks keep happening

109
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,150
in Great Britain ambassador Halley I
wouldn't ask you about immigration

110
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,890
President Trump recently
Cinda daca which is the Obama era

111
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,400
program that protects undocumented
immigrants brought to the US as children

112
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,360
and President Trump wants a legislative
solution well Senator Lindsey Graham

113
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,740
senior senator for your from your home
state of South Carolina is the co-author

114
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,180
of what's known as the DREAM Act and it
would offer these young people a path to

115
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,530
citizenship do you believe that dreamers
should get not just the right to stay in

116
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,330
the US but an actual path to citizenship
well first of all I think that we have

117
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,299
to remember that we all feel for
dreamers we all feel for those that came

118
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,459
here or were brought here without their
willingness or without their

119
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,970
understanding that this was going to
happen so we all have a heavy heart for

120
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,210
that but I also think we have to
remember that the United States is a

121
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,900
country of laws and we have to always
follow those laws and I think what

122
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,620
you're seeing is the president is trying
to work with Congress on what is a very

123
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,850
difficult situation there is no easy
answer when it comes to things like this

124
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,940
and I think the fact that they're having
the back-and-forth the fact that they're

125
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,790
talking about it I think it's important
and I think at the end there will be a

126
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,540
resolution that they come together with
on this as they go forward

127
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,770
ambassador Haley before I let you go I
want to ask about a report on cnn.com

128
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,780
that my colleague Elise Labbit did about
you and in that she reported that you

129
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,740
were under consideration to become
president Trump's Secretary of State

130
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,300
after the election but you said no
because you felt at the time as governor

131
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,230
of South Carolina you didn't have enough
foreign policy experience would you give

132
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,080
the same answer today if asked to be
Secretary of State

133
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,670
well I'm not gonna be asked because Rex
Tillerson is not going anywhere you know

134
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,360
at the time that I went to Trump Tower
they were asking me to come there to

135
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,830
talk about Secretary of State and I just
knew at that time I he could find

136
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,580
someone better and so I took myself out
of the running and I will tell you now

137
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,660
that secretary Tillerson continues to
work hard he's not going anywhere and I

138
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,750
continue to work well with him so we're
gonna keep doing it that way if he does

139
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,070
go somewhere would you want the job he's
not going anywhere so I'm not gonna

140
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,670
think about it okay ambassador Haley
thank you so much for your time this

141
00:10:02,670 --> 00:00:00,000
morning appreciate it okay thanks Dana
