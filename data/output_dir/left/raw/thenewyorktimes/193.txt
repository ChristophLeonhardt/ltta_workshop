1
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:05,410
Nicolás Maduro has
overseen Venezuela’s worst

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,200
economic disaster
in recent times.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,150
Nine out of 10 people here

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,150
can’t afford
enough food to eat.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,980
And yet he was re-elected
by a landslide.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,540
Few signs point to anything
getting better here,

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,820
so how will he be able to run
this country?

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,297
To answer this,

9
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:24,088
let’s look back and
see how he was elected.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,210
It’s the day before the
presidential election,

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,070
and I’m here in a
leaky basketball court

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,770
in a neighborhood that
voted heavily for Maduro

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,460
in the last election.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,710
There’s no stump
speeches, no candidates,

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,660
no flags for any party.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,220
But there are eggs
and frozen chickens

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,440
subsidized by the government.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,660
Maduro’s campaign has
been widely criticized

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,120
for dangling food in front
of the poor in exchange

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,650
for votes.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,350
Brigid is a Maduro
party supporter,

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,900
a community leader in charge

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,980
of food distribution for 100
or so families in the barrio.

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,840
This isn’t new.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,510
Handing out food and promising
benefits have been popular

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,760
“get out the vote” tactics here
since Hugo Chávez’s time.

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,530
What is new is the
level of desperation.

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,640
Maduro has turned this need
into a not-so-subtle pitch:

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,800
“I give and you give.”

30
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,520
Now it’s the morning
of the election

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,260
and Maduro supporters
are out in force.

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,200
This neighborhood has been hit
hard by the economic crisis

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,390
and you still have die-hard
supporters of the president

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,948
turning out the vote.

35
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:08,758
For years now,

36
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,330
they’ve benefited from this
party’s welfare system.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,300
Yasmín is a community leader.

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,940
She’s going around the barrio
knocking on doors, making

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,410
sure people vote for Maduro.

40
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,560
Some here don’t blame the
president for their hunger.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,750
They blame the U.S.

42
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,570
Others don’t buy that line.

43
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,970
But Maduro’s critics don’t
have many other choices.

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,810
He’s already banned or jailed
his most popular rivals.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,670
If anything, this
election seemed

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,650
to be about perfecting
a system in which

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,380
his party always wins.

48
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,440
Not 50 yards away from
the voting station

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,850
is a punto rojo, or a red station,

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,850
the color of 
Maduro’s party.

51
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,370
They're writing down the number

52
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,060
of your benefit card,

53
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,730
what’s called the
Fatherland Card,

54
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,910
to make sure that you voted,
and promising a special bonus

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,420
if Maduro is re-elected.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,420
A hungry country
should be a weakness.

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,340
But in this election,

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,410
it was Maduro’s strength
because his government

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,200
owns the food.

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,689
Is this how it’s going
to be from now on?

61
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,230
Walking around the
streets of Caracas

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,490
it feels like we’ve
passed a crossroads,

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,290
one where the president had
everything going against him,

64
00:04:03,290 --> 00:00:00,000
and yet he still wins.
