interest at where it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font>

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,540
is when the travel ban is constantly

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,460
challenged in court well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

countries which the travel ban applause

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,320
all countries that are quite poor and do

serious conflict of interest and where

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,130
it's going to come up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the travel</font>

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,880
ban is constantly challenged in court as

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,750
lacking a reasonable basis lawyers for

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,610
plaintiffs who want to challenge the

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,860
travel plan are going to argue and I

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,809
think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good argument that</font>

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,090
this was an arbitrary order that does

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,610
not have any link to the national

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,949
interest because first the countries

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,570
were a lot of tourists have come from

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list have sent you of any people</font>

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,640
of the United States who have committed

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump Organization or not on the</font>

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,990
list that's not a legitimate basis of

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,880
which to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list together for</font>

litigate to defend the travel ban and

that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on top of before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>
