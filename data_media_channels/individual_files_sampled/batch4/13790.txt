Rachel Dolezal gets herself in trouble again plus we discuss president Trump's pullout from the North Korean summit and we talk to Memorial Day this is the Ben Shapiro show well it is a day on which we celebrate the Valor of our soldiers of our of our service people all over the world and I want to start the show today by talking a little bit about some things you may not know about Memorial Day now this is from history calm so this information is I think really useful and relevant and pretty cool actually because most folks don't really know all that much about Memorial Day I will admit that I didn't until fairly recently some of the stuff is really neat so did you know that Memorial Day one of the first Memorial did one of the first commemorations of a Memorial Day was organized by recently freed slaves so according to history calm as the Civil War neared its end thousands of Union soldiers held as prisoners of war were herded into a series of hastily assembled camps in Charleston South Carolina conditions at one camp a former racetrack near the city Citadel were so bad that more than two hundred and fifty prisoners died from disease or exposure and were buried in a mass grave behind the tracks at grandstand actually this is one of the great untold stories of the Civil War is the differing prison camps that were held by the north and the south there's a very good book about one of those prison camps that was those in the South that ended up with thousands of people dying in just horrific conditions people being held outdoors without tents I mean just horrendous stuff three weeks after the Confederate surrender an unusual procession entered the former camp on May 1st 1865 more than 1,000 recently freed slaves accompanied by regiments of US Colored Troops including the Massachusetts 54th infantry and a handful of white Charlestonians gather in the camp to consecrate a new proper burial site for the Union dead the group sang hymns it gave readings and distributed flowers around the cemetery which they dedicated to the martyrs of the racecourse the racecourse of course being the place where they had held this awful awful prison kemon brutality the Civil War really cannot be overstated and this is why it's so frustrating when people overlook the legacy of the literally hundreds of thousands of American troops who gave their lives to end the evil of slavery within American borders it's an amazing thing and to overlook that and to pretend that Americans made no sacrifices on this score is just to be historically ignorant now doesn't mean all the problems got solved obviously 1865 but America so elders have spent their lives in their blood they've spent their days their years you know upholding America's first freedoms and those freedoms are deeply important to the cause of freedom in the world obviously obviously thanks soldiers who are stationed around the globe right now I'm sure listening to the sound of my voice we have lots of members of the military who listen to the show thank God for them and thank them for listening holidays founder was a guy named General John Logan he was commander in chief of the Union veterans group known as the Grand Army of the Republic and he issued a decree on that May 30th 1868 should become a nationwide day of commemoration for more than six hundred twenty thousand soldiers killed in the recently ended civil war on declaration day as Logan dubbed it Americans should lay flowers and decorate the graves of the war dead whose bodies now lie in almost every city village and Hamlet churchyard in the land according to legend Logan chose May 30th because it was a rare day that didn't fall on the anniversary of a Civil War battle because there were so many Civil War battles some historians think that the date was selected to ensure that flowers across the country would be in full full bloom according to history calm after the war Logan who served as US congressman before resigning to join the army returned to politics and he eventually served in both the House and the Senate he ran for vice-president in 1884 unsuccessfully and his body was laid in states at the US Capitol he was just one of 33 people to have received the honor apparently he adapted the idea from earlier events in the south because in April 1886 the ladies Memorial Association of Columbus Georgia resolved to commemorate the fallen once a year which was the decision that seemed to have influenced Logan to follow suit according to his own wife but commemorations were rarely held on one standard day they were sort of held on a variety of days it didn't actually become a federal holiday until 1971 because declarations day is what it was called the first year more than 27 States held some sort of ceremony with more than 5,000 people in attendance at a ceremony and Arlington National Cemetery by 1890 every former State of the Union had adopted it as an official holiday but for more than 50 years the holiday was used to commemorate those killed just in the Civil War not in any other American conflict and then after World War one it was it expanded out to include those killed in all wars Memorial Day obviously as opposed to Veterans Day which is about everybody who served Memorial Day specifically about people who gave their lives in order to preserve the freedom of the Union so I think I find this stuff fascinating according to street comm although the term Memorial Tate was used beginning in the 1880s the holiday was officially known as declaration it for more than a century and then it was changed by federal law as you mentioned well four years later the uniform Monday holiday Act of 1968 finally went into effect in a move Memorial Day from its observance on May 30th regardless of the day of the week to set it for the last Monday in May a lot of veterans groups were concerned that a lot of people saw it as a long weekend as opposed to a day to pay tribute to our fallen soldiers for more than 20 years their cause was championed by Senator Daniel Inouye who recently died in 2012 he had reintroduce legislation to set it any day in the middle of the week you wouldn't just been on a Monday it wouldn't been another a long weekend it would have been a time when we all stand and pay tribute to fallen soldiers honestly I'm in favor of that I think that we should move it to whatever day May 30th is we should move it back to its original date said it doesn't just become another day that you have off and you take it off for a long weekend yes we can enjoy Memorial Day but obviously we should have half our brain more than half our brain I'm the reason that we are spending that day barbecuing as opposed to working and we should all you know try to do something for a soldier that day or a soldier's family that's a in Israel they do this right in Israel they actually stop all traffic in the country at a particular time on the fallen soldiers day in Israel and they place they play air-raid sirens all across the country people literally stop their cars on the freeway get out of their cars and stand there until the air-raid siren is over we should have something like that in the United States as well despite the increasing celebration of the holidays of summer right of passage there are still some formal rituals on the books the American flag is supposed to be hung at half-staff until noon on Memorial Day and then raised to the top of the staff and since 2000 when the US Congress passed legislation all Americans are encouraged to pause for national moments of remembrance at 3 p.m. local time so that should actually be formalized we should have whatever noise it is sirens whatever it is to ensure that at 3:00 p.m. everybody stops what they are doing the federal government has also used the holiday to honor non veterans the Lincoln Memorial was dedicated on Memorial Day in 1922 the Indy 500 has become its own Memorial Day tradition obviously the reason that I think it's important to remember all of this is because we live in a country when there are very few unifying symbols there very few unifying things that bring us together we fight about everything with each other all the time we seem to really like each other in a lot of ways but this is one where we should all come together and it's unfortunate that during the 1960's a lot of the patriotism surrounding our fallen soldiers was lost during the 1960's soldiers who are coming back from Vietnam were treated really terribly even now there's this weird idea on the left that soldiers are either heroes or victims and that if a soldier goes off to serve in a foreign land and dies heroically that soldier was somehow a victim of the government that sends him over there in the first place we haven't violence here army now I've always found this idea really insulting these soldiers are making a sacrifice and the sacrifice that they are making they're doing with full knowledge of what it is they are getting into that's what makes the sacrifice worth worth making that's what makes the sacrifice so incredible and making more of a sacrifice than I have and making more of a sacrifice than virtually anyone in my generation has mean the number of people in my generation joining the military is still extraordinarily low they're doing something I did not do they're doing something I did not have the bravery and the courage and the decency to do that's an amazing thing and to rob them of the volition of that choice by suggesting that when American soldiers die they die in vain or that when American soldiers die they are victims of the evil American corporate hierarchy and the evil American government these are independent minded people who are making the most altruistic decision they can which is to take their own lives and put them on the line for us to rob them of that volition is to rob them of what makes their lives meaningful in the first place it's also a great time to remember that for all of the leftists talk about how America has been a terrible force in the world how America is responsible for slavery and imperialism and colonialism wherever American troops have set their boots the world is a better place wherever American troops have kept their boots the world is certainly a better place hey if you don't believe me just look at a rock and there's a lot of talk about how Iraq is a worse place because we intervene no Iraq is a worse place because we pulled out when American troops entered Iraq Ameri Iraq was run by the Saddam Hussein dictatorship where women were being forcibly imprisoned and raped and tortured by Saddam Hussein's sons it was a hellhole he was gassing his own people the Kurds and when we went in we broke a lot of stuff and a lot of people died and that is awful but there is no question that the place got a lot worse when America pulled out hey we're American troops set their boots things get better which is why still the vast majority of oppressed people planet Earth if they could would look to the arrival of the American flag in their land as a as an opportunity to cut back repression and to fight repression as opposed to imperialism colonialism look at these evil Americans and all the rest again the reality is that America has freed Europe but not once but twice America has freed about has freed the world of the Soviet Menace okay that is due to the sacrifice of American soldiers our history is long and glorious with regards to our military interventions and that is certainly true including wars like Vietnam which was not a war fought for American imperial interests it was a war fought to preserve South Vietnam independence there's a war fought to preserve the democracy of Vietnam and to move toward a better democracy in Vietnam and saved them from the repression and evil of the Vietcong administration which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people including in Cambodia just across the border domino theory was correct Cambodia did fall and a million people were killed by Pol Pot when America precipitously pulls out things get bad when America stays Germany becomes nice Germany and nobody thinks of Germany as a threatening country anymore why because America over ran Germany along with her allies and then proceeded to turn Germany into a thriving Western democracy and the same thing is true in Japan which was a complete imperialist dictatorship and then America came in with our troops and we occupied the place and there are still troops in Japan South Korea is only free because of American troops because of American material and American men and women willing to sacrifice their lives in order to make South Koreans free the reason they're not all living under the Gulag conditions of kim jeong-hoon is because of the strength and power of America's military might this is why whenever there's an attempt by folks on the left to cut back America's military the case being that a strong virile military scares people it makes the world a scarier worse place the answer is every time we do that that is immediately followed by some sort of terrorist attack or brutal attack on Americans and then we have to build up our military again Bill Clinton spent years cutting back the American military and then there was the attack of 9/11 and then we had to rebuild the American military the threat either is stopped there or it comes here the same was true in Pearl Harbor by 1941 by the time of America's entry into World War two and Pearl Harbor the American military the standing American military was smaller than the standing military of the Philippines Americ had the 16th largest military on planet earth in 1941 and we ramped back up if America had been a lot more muscular on the world stage and had attempted to prevent the imperialism of the Japanese and the imperialism of the of the Germans earlier than that working with our allies a lot of lives had been saved a lot of lives would have been saved and there's this this weird idea that's risen in both isolationist circles and leftist circles it is sort of where a lot of Ron Paul foreign policy fans runs directly into the arms of Bernie Sanders foreign policy fans then America's presence on the world stage is unnecessary that if we draw nothing bad happens that it's not in America's interest to be quote unquote global policeman we don't have to be global policeman nobody suggesting that America has to be the world police and save everybody from themselves but we do have to assess what is in America's interests where do the gravest threats lie and then we have to be active on those threats because just like with policing if you are not proactively policing a particular area it goes to hell in a handbasket and soon those areas spread broken windows theory doesn't just apply to domestic crime it also applies to foreign policy which again does not mean that America has to compromise our own safety and security and the use of our military force for every small humanitarian mission it doesn't mean that when we can we should and it also means that morality has a heavy part to play in America's foreign policy it has always had a heavy part to play in America's foreign policy there's this realist idea out there that morality doesn't play any role in in what we do on foreign policy and obviously the American people do not disagree do not agree with that the American people believe that there is still room for virtue in American foreign policy which is why we have this really divided mind about foreign policy that I think we need to figure out because otherwise we're putting our own soldiers in unwinnable situations the divided mind goes like this something terrible happens on a farm front there's a slaughter in in Syria there's a slaughter in Sudan there's a saw a slaughter in Somalia and the American people say see it on TV they say that looks awful we need to do something about that that looks terrible and then whatever American administration is in power Republicans Democrats doesn't matter they say okay we'll respond to that by doing something and then within five weeks the American people say we really shouldn't be in there you know there's no reason for us to be in there in the first place foreign policy should be conducted along the lines of a long-range attempt to figure out exactly what is in America's interest if we can do that then we can ensure that we are using our military in the best possible way and that our military members signed up for the right gig but on this Memorial Day it's time to stop and say thank you to all of the members of the military who laid down their lives so that we could spend today having fun and then I could do my podcast and then I could spend time with my family and that you could do whatever it is that you're doing today there's a free and wonderful country because of the power and might of the American military the greatest force for freedom in the history of mankind okay meanwhile speaking of foreign policy there is there's a lot of hubbub over the weekend and and today about President Trump and North Korea obviously last week President Trump pulled out of the summit with North Korea and now they're rumors that the summit is going to be back on with North Korea this is a negotiation tactic by President Trump I don't think that President Trump should be giving us constant updates on whether there's going to be a summit with North Korea I think the reason for that is that if he continues to give us these constant updates about what's going on with North Korea it makes it seem as though he is desperate to have this meeting with North Korea America should never be desperate to have a meeting with anybody we're the most powerful country on the face of the earth and in the history of the world there's no reason we should be desperate to meet with a tin-pot dictator it is his job to come to us with something to give up so that we can reinstate him in the community of nations now President Trump is saying that North Korea blew it on the summit and you know basically this is right based on the recent statement of North Korea I've decided to terminate the plan summit in Singapore on June 12th well many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world okay well this is a negotiation tactic by President Trump Democrats however are celebrating the fact that the summit fell apart so it's hilarious the Democrats who were saying he never should have held this um in the first place are celebrating the fact that it fell apart now basically whatever Trump does they proceeded to do the opposite so Nancy Pelosi comes out she says Kim jong-eun must be having a giggle fit over the canceled summit well it really is having a giggle felt like why you can go back to his crappy his crapoly run country with its exploded nuclear mountain and continue to impoverishes on people like where's the giggle fed I'm not really seeing the evidence of this I think it's a good thing for Kim Jung hoon here you had a thug a person who killed all his own family members a person who has runs a police state being legitimized by the President of the United States they were on a par with each other he got the global recognition and regard he's the big winner and when he got this letter from the president saying okay never mind he must be having a giggle fit right there there's no evidence whatsoever Kim jong-un is happy about any of this but that's not gonna stop Democrats from claiming that Kim Jong moon is happy about all of this because their opposition to Trump is much stronger than their opposition to Kim jong-un you can figure that with a nuclear-armed evil dictator we might all be able to get at least a little bit on the same page as far as who's the bad guy in the narrative but apparently Democrats are unable to do that speaking of which there's a lot of talk before the election about President Trump and Russia Russia collusion and president Trump is going to be giving up power over American foreign policy to the Russia ins and all of the rest of this well that obviously has not happened president Trump has been quite harsh with the Russians he's imposed a lot of sanctions that the Obama administration did not his arm the Ukrainians the Ukrainian government was thanking president Trump just last week for arming them properly or more properly well now it has come up that Malaysia Airlines flight 17 which was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014 that was shot down indeed by a group connected with Russia at the time Russia denied any involvement in the crash that killed all those aboard a news conference in the Netherlands last week Wilbert policin of the Dutch National Police announced that after investigators had scrutinized the images it was determined that the missile originated from Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade from the city of Kursk in western Russia in western Russia the missile was part of the Russian Armed Forces friend Westerbeck II whose chief prosecutor of the National Prosecutor's Office of the Netherlands according to media I also noted that at the time the plane went down the area was controlled by Russian separatists he said that this raises questions such as to whether the brigade was actively involved in downing MH 17 it's an important question which the joint investigation team are still investigating Russia continues to deny any involvement of course the Russian Defense Ministry announced both in his first hours after the tragedy and further officially denied the insinuations of the Ukrainian side about the alleged involvement of Russian servicemen to the catastrophe that happened in the skies of Ukraine and brought the relevant evidence to the Dutch investigation team Vladimir Putin is in evil human being his regime is evil and his conducted acts of evil that was 300 dead for no reason other than Russian militarism president Trump has stood up to the Russia this is this is the part of the quid pro quo I don't understand if the idea was the Russians were going to elect Trump said they would get sub backed something from Trump I'm waiting for the thing that they are getting back from Trump I'm just not seeing the evidence of this I just don't see the evidence of this and although all the Democrats are complaining about Russian interference in the election I'd like to see them be half as upset when Russia actually kills journalists or in Russia invade sovereign countries as they did to Crimea and President Obama did nothing or when they took controlled Syria and President Obama facilitated all of that in other words it's Democrats playing politics with foreign policy and I just I find it abhorrent that they are so attached to the idea that Republicans are the bad guys they can't even get together on some pretty obvious matters here okay meanwhile President Obama made an amazing statement at the end of last week and this statement is worthy of discussion so the statement is that he did not have scandals as president hey the coverage of scandals by the media is completely disproportionate between Republicans and Democrats this is the real issue here but so President Obama according to Newsweek took a light swing at his successor during a tech conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday he said his eight years in office were scandal-free he says I didn't have scandals which seems like it shouldn't be something you brag about and he said actually if you look at the history of the modern presidency coming out of the modern presidency without anybody going to jail is really good it's a big deal he said no one in my white house never got in trouble for screwing up as long as there wasn't malicious intent behind it okay this of course is the point right you see him allied the point right there at the very end where he says no one got in trouble because there was no malicious intent does that ring a few bells malicious intent that was the excuse used by James Comey in the FBI not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for maliciously setting up a private server to hide her emails in putting 33,000 emails on there and then destroying all of them hey so that was not malicious intent according to James Comey and so it obama says is maybe we had scandals I mean maybe we did scandalous but we never meant to do scandalous stuff absolute hogwash absolute nonsense his administration was certainly not scandal-free Benghazi it was a major scandal despite what Democrats would say hey this was a scandal in which the State Department repeatedly refused requests by ambassador Chris Stevens for additional security in Benghazi no no troops were forthcoming in the middle of a 17 hour attack in the middle of the a huge attack in in Benghazi our 13 hour attack in Benghazi and nothing came and then there was a cover-up by the Obama administration claiming had nothing to do with lack of security or Libyan policy in the first place instead what it really had to do with was if it was a video made by some anonymous YouTube guide nobody had ever heard of Schnauzer scandal there's fast and furious in which the Obama administration greenlit the movement of killing weapons as they would say down to Mexican drug cartels which were then used in the murder of US border Agent Brian Terry you remember that the Obama administration was involved in the IRS scandal in which Obama's IRS suspiciously started targeting only conservative 501c3 groups they claimed no no no we never would do that of course that's exactly what happened the Obama administration was repeatedly involved in deep levels of corruption no-one was prosecuted because the DOJ was run by Barack Obama's wingman Eric Holder but here's the real point Barack Obama thinks that he was never involved in a scandal because he was not according to the media according to the media he was never involved in a scandal and this has been a repeat point of contention for folks on write a lot of people on the Left don't understand why so many folks on the right are so upset all the time about the media why are we so upset about the media aren't the media just trying to tell the truth don't the media have a job to do here's the problem whenever a Democrat gets involved in a scandal the coverage is less blanket shall we say then the coverage of Republican when a Republican is involved in a similar scandal right you still like do you even remember the name of that New York Attorney General who had to resign because he was calling girlfriends his slaves and then sexually abusing them do you remember that guy allegedly he allegedly sexually abusing them remember that guy his name was Eric Schneiderman they lasted for five hours right mean that's that sucker was over immediately and that was over as fast as it began but think of Republicans for whom this has happened the David Vitter scandal went on for a long time that was a Consent affair with a call girl and that went on for a lot longer the Donald Trump scandals obviously have continued for a lot longer now you may say well what about Republicans who resigned did the scandals continue for them the answer is yes the scandals does continue for Republicans who resigned from office Bob Packwood obviously is still synonymous with scandal so I mean you can go all the way back with this can the media have guarded Democrats with their with their pens for years hey here's the latest story about this okay and it's not played by the like this.for it's not played this way before the New York Post by the New York Post but this is obviously the hidden story here in May 1961 an elderly woman in Paris heard a knock at the door of her 6-story walk-up apartment it was the only powerful man only it was only the most powerful man in the world the President of the United States was going door to door hoping to find the call girl he had discreetly arranged to meet John F Kennedy it turned out used a fake excuse about a doctor's visit to attend a long arranged dalliance well in Paris for a crucial summit only and wind up in the wrong building knocking on the doors of random Parisians who were left with the surprise of their lives the tale of this ill-advised but ultimately successful liaison is recorded in madam cloud her secret world of pleasure privilege and power by William studien madam cloud born Fernan grew day in 1923 and engineer France was one of the world's most successful Madam's starting in 1957 she ran an exclusive high-class prostitution ring that offered a very specific type of woman tall supermodel gorgeous classy and upscale or at least trained to appear so - the world's richest and most powerful men the only woman who worked for her were known as Claude girls which became a well-known in powerful brand she scouted them carefully paid for plastic surgery if needed and ultimately hoped to marry them off to aristocracy a day with a cloud girl was one of those pinnacle Paris experiences right Stadium like staying at the Ritz or a dinner at Maxine's whoring a Lanvin suit an apotheosis of luxury the French can do better than any other nationality according to Stadium Madame's clouds client lists included the world's most successful men Kennedy Frank Sinatra Pablo Picasso Marc Chagall Sammy Davis jr. former vice president Nelson Rockefeller three generations of Geddes Marlon Brando Groucho Marx few rich famous and male in the 20th century Chancellor madam cloud knew what you liked in bed and provided exactly that for Kennedy his desired liaison required almost as much detailed preparation as an actual political summit after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in April 1961 Kennedy thought a meeting in your with French and Soviet leaders Charles de Gaulle and Nikita Khrushchev respectively could serve as a reset for his presidency he decided that he and first lady Jackie Kennedy would embark on their first official European tour this would be the trip where Jackie so entranced the French Kennedy famously introduced himself as the man who accompanied Jacqueline Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris but while Jackie was thrilled to the prospect of meeting novelist and newly appointed French Culture Minister Andre malroux one of her literary idols her husband looked to fulfill a different sort of fantasy if JFK had a type it was a wholesome snooty proper preppy girl who's flaunted untouchability he could violate girls lay shackle in Bouvier Wright's stadium who notes that Kennedy learned about Madame Claude from Sinatra here was a Madame who specialized in exactly what JFK was after the liaison was apparently arranged between madame clown and pierre salinger Kennedy's press secretary when Salinger first proposed the arrangement cloud turned him down fearing the many things that could go wrong if the president's visit to a prostitute went haywire but Salinger convinced cloud that any problems could work in her favor a scandal would make her a legends of the sex comfortable French and that a successful dalliance would bring her to the attention of the world's most powerful men so Salinger who's again this is JFK's private secretary exhorted the madam quote rise to the occasion do it for your career do it for your country he rift paraphrasing JFK's inaugural address think big weighing risks and rewards like the shrewd banker she might have otherwise been cloud decided to go for it so Kennedy wanted to hook up with a French actress who looked like Jackie Kennedy and apparently that didn't work so instead he decided to go to a whore now here's the real question it's not that was 1961 it is now 2018 it took 57 years for this hit the press 57 years for the test the press do you really think the press weren't there in Paris at a meeting with Charles de Gaulle and Nikita Khrushchev do you think the press really weren't around for any of this do you think the press really didn't know about it the press knew about everything they know about everything that was going on with JFK hey the plan was apparently for the four malroux this this French culture minister to play tour guide to the first lady while the president visited French historical sites but then Kennedy begged off claiming a flare-up of his bad back and saying he needed to visit a French pain specialist but instead he had brought his dr. feelgood max Jacobson for cover and they headed off to find his mystery lover only to wind up at the wrong apartment so again is it possible the press didn't know about this unlikely and cuz JFK did this kind of crap all the time the Kennedys did this kind of stuff all the time the Camelot imaged the press plastered across the front pages it was all a lie now you might say that these lies were done for the sake of the American public they did this with Hollywood stars at the time they did it with all presidents at the time all politicians at the time but that is clearly not true because even today the press treat JFK with this sort of glamour and sophistication JFK was a significantly worse person in many ways than Bill Clinton okay and Bill Clinton isn't nobody's idea of a saint and yet JFK is treated as this wonderful guy right nobody talks about shipping Kennedy off the Kennedy Center nobody talks about taking that chisel and just chipping that right off the Kennedy Center talking about removing Woodrow Wilson's name from the Woodrow Wilson School over Princeton but they will never talk about removing JFK's name even though Kennedy was indeed the worst kind of sexual scumbag none that matters right that's totally fine because Kennedy was Kennedy and then you wonder why people on the right don't respect the press you want to write people on the right have no respect for how it is that the the press Khoa bout their business it's because of stuff like this now meanwhile and apparently the least shocking news of the day Rachel Dolezal you remember her she's the white lady who said that she was black and then she ended up working for the Spokane chapter of the n-double a-c-p and then it turned out that she was actually just a white girl from Kansas well now it turns out that according to KHQ which is a local station Dolezal has legally changed her name to nichette CD ah Wow in 2016 because she's a screwed up human being is accused of first-degree theft by welfare fraud perjury in the second degree and false verification for public assistance her potential punishment under RCW seventy four point oh eight point three three one could include up to fifteen years in prison because Dolezal changed her name will be referring to her as Nikki Diallo according to court documents Diallo illegally received almost nine thousand dollars in food assistance and illegally received one hundred bucks in child care assistance total restitution according to documentation is nearly nine thousand dollars allegedly stolen from August 2015 through November 2017 so what exactly happened well the investigation into D Allah's alleged theft started in March 2017 when a DSHS office of fraud ability investigator received information that Diallo had written a book that got published the investigator said he'd heard zlo say she was getting public assistance but also knew a typical public publishing contract included payments of ten to twenty thousand dollars the investigator conducted a review of diablos records and found she'd been reporting her income was usually less than five hundred bucks a month in child support payments at one point when asked as to how she was paying her bills she reported barely with help from friends and gifts however between August 1 2015 in September 2017 she'd installed nearly 84,000 dollars into her account and she'd not report this to the Department of Social and Health Services so there's that now I feel bad for h 'l Dolezal is obviously a mentally ill person right that's that's not hard to see Rachel Dolezal is a mentally ill person she's a white girl who believes that she's black and she has lived a really dissolute life I mean her life has been just a mess why is it that if I say that Rachel Dolezal is mentally ill this is treated as common knowledge but if I say that a man who believes he's a woman is mentally ill this is treated as crazy and let me tell you something believing you're a member of a different race is a lot less biologically suspect than believing that you are a member of a different sex okay just putting that out there by Rachel Dolezal doing what everybody always knew she would write she it turns out that she is a fraud shocking no no who can believe it who can believe it now in in other

Peterson who stood outside the old school for several minutes while bullets rang out had done his job their children might not have lost their lives I think Peterson is the lowest form of life available said Fred Guttenberg whose daughter Jaime was gunned down on the 3rd floor my daughter would be alive if not for him Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel publicly criticized Peterson for his inaction during the shooting but now is amazing they report that recently surfaced has some victims families calling for a nude investigation of Peterson for a case he handled four years to the day prior to the massacre the case involved two 17 year old students bullying a 14 year old freshman with one holding down the younger boy by his ankles while the other kicked the victim grabbed his genitals and then took the victims own baseball bat and began shoving it against his buttocks simulating rape threw the boys clothes one of those assailants the boy who allegedly held down the victim was Scott Israel's son the sheriff of Broward County Bret defense attorney Alex Ariza who represents shooting victim Anthony Borges who shot five times in the Valentine's Day Massacre but survived said the case could have led to felony charges he could have been charged with a lewd and lascivious and I'm being conservative said arias a peterson claimed in the report it was simple battery under the board it's discipline matrix and he decided to give both of the boys attacks a three day suspension what is that it's like an alternative universe law Oryza said because what happens because you're in the school you don't have to obey regular laws in fact the Disciplinary matrix includes sexual misconduct and serious battery both of which arguably applied in this case arias a said quote you will never see somebody grabbing somebody's crotch and poking some kid in the butt with a bat and getting a simple battery for it Gutenberg's had the facts of the incident infuriated him and Scott Peterson failed to do his job again it's just another example of a bad crime and somebody not being held accountable it's kind of interesting the intersection of the same people well it's more than interesting obviously it means that there was some sort of relationship between Scott Israel the sheriff of Broward County and deputy Peterson one of the boys father says listen if deputy Peterson had been made to answer for this maybe he been it would have been replaced by a more competent deputy but this wouldn't have been the sheriff's son what a sexual assault has been reduced to a simple battery apparently Peterson noted in his report the victim's parents were notified of discipline and did not request additional law enforcement action but who cares it's the job of the police to enforce the law it's not the job of the parents to enforce the law just amazing just amazing and Scott Israel remember has been defended by a bunch of the people in parklands who wish to put blame on the NRA for what happened in parkland the reality is this is a law-enforcement screw-up in every possible way and corruption in local law enforcement is not relegated to issues of race very often it is relegated also to issues it includes issues of personal corruption of relationships between people who then use those relationships in order to forward their own ambitions or to protect people who they know what a horrifying story and really just bad okay meanwhile ESPN continues to lose subscribers the reason I bring this up is because I think so much of our sports debate now whether it's the NFL kneeling controversy which you know I don't know why you would kneel for the flag I think they're better ways to protest the entire NFL kneeling controversy has been driven by media coverage if players were not getting media coverage for dealing then they wouldn't be doing it and part of that is the insane politicization that has taken place over at ESPN now I used to be a huge ESPN fan a huge ESPN fan for a while I subscribe to ESPN The Magazine I was a probably our daily watcher I would get up at 6:00 when I was a kid I would get up at 6 o'clock in the morning because before the internet was really great with clips I used to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning every morning and run into the den and turn on ESPN and watch SportsCenter hoping to catch my White Sox highlights and now you can watch eight hours of ESPN without ever getting a Sports highlight instead ESPN has become entirely talk radio combative back and forth between liberals and leftists there's there's no one on the right ever on ESPN ESPN is completely to the left anybody who even expresses a mildly conservative opinion is immediately thrown out or suspended and this happened multiple times well there's a great article at The Wall Street Journal about the politicization at at ESPN here's they say John skipper was furious one of his star anchors Jamel Hill had sent a tweet calling President Donald Trump a white supremacist mr. Trump supporters called for her to be fired prominent black athletes defended the anchor who's African American sitting in his office last September mr. skipper then ESPN's President lit into miss Hill according to people familiar with the meeting if I punish you he told her I'd open up to protest and come off as racist if I do nothing now fuel a narrative among conservatives and a faction within ESPN that the network had become too liberal mr. skipper chose to spare miss Hill mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics and bad programming people are dumping it in record numbers the president's fruit was hyperbolic but it's happed into a real anxiety at ESPN what was the way forward for a company shaken to its foundations by the cord cutting revolution and the answer is pretty obvious cover sports you idiots but they haven't covered sports instead they've decided to counter program these discussion programs every half an hour on the half hour for the entire day well why would anybody subscribe to us PN for that you can just listen to Bill Simmons his podcast and get better sports coverage and better support Siskiyou listen to the ringer I listen to them they're great you can you can listen to all that there's tons of great sports programming out there you can get on demand why would you tune into sports television on ESPN to watch a couple people who don't know anything about politics jabber about politics utterly useless so according to The Wall Street Journal executives at the sports media giant wanted to seek out new audiences by spicing up shows with opinionated analysis and debate including on SportsCenter it's struggling news and highlights franchise except that the struggle at SportsCenter has largely been occasioned by the politics of SportsCenter again I can like I can watch 45 minutes of SportsCenter without seeing a single baseball highlight they've decided which sports they want to cover and it's usually enough on the NBA there's very little coverage of the MLB I've done full articles on this over a daily wire about the discrepancy in coverage and that's because they're going after different demographics the reality is that demographically speaking the disproportionate share of people who watch NBA NFL our NFL tends to be pretty proportionate across the spectrum NBA NBA fans tend to be disproportionately African American and MLB fans tend to be disproportionately white ESPN has decided that because a lot of viewers of the NBA watch more sports program it's not stupid decision they'll focus more on the NBA but in doing so in completely cutting the MLB out and the hockey for example I mean they've cut a lot of their baseball coverage baseball tonight is barely on anymore they've cut out a lot of the audience they used to have like Legacy subscribers executives the sports so but the amount and intensity of political expression generated sharp internal disagreements over whether ESPN was appropriately taking part in the broader national conversation or whether top executives were encouraging a divisive company culture and giving too much leeway to to promote left-leaning views both on air and in social media and this of course is absolutely true Linda Cohen who's one of the most prominent female anchors in April 2017 she have a radio interview and she said ESPN's politics were pushing away viewers and the network had overpaid for NBA rights so skipper of course called her to yell at her why ESPN found itself torn up by the nation's partisan politics traces back to its fundamental business challenge its status as cable TV's most expensive channel had become a liability consumers grew fed up with their monthly cable prices big cable distributors began offering discounted packages that didn't include the network and consumers started opting for these so there's obviously a cost-cutting problem a cord cutting problem rather but that doesn't answer the real question which is was the answer to that to completely counter-program along the lines of stuff that nobody wanted to see here's the reality Sports is a politics free zone for most people who watch it they're not interested in the politics and more politics you ladle into our sports unless we're gonna watch you the NFL realized it ESPN had better or they're gonna go the way of the dodo bird okay we will be back here tomorrow first actually I have to do a couple of things so first I want to do a couple of Federalist Papers because we haven't had a chance to actually do the Federalist Papers in the recent past so I have to catch up on a couple of them and then we'll do some things I like and some things that I hate so let's begin with the Federalist paper so when do Federalist paper 29 which we didn't do last week and we'll do Federalist paper 30 for this week so Federalist paper 29 is by Alexander Hamilton and this is the concluding Federalist paper about whether there should be a standing army in the United States that is run by the federal government so Alexander Hamilton says yes and then he says that if the standing army starts to make trouble the states will stand up to them so for all the talk about you don't need militias you don't need armed citizens Hamilton repeatedly and throughout the Federalist Papers claims the best insurance against an overreaching federal government will be states that are able to call upon their citizens to defend themselves against federal overreach critics according to Hamilton said the federal army would be chief law enforcement mechanism and they said that there was no provision for Posse Comitatus so there are a lot of people who said well instead of the federal government having its own law enforcement body why don't they just call on the states to help them enforce the law now ironically enough there's a push by the states against Posse Comitatus after the Civil War they said we're not going to be the levers of the federal government but at the time there are a lot of people saying we don't need the federal government to be quite so overreaching we'll just have the state enforce some of this law well Hamilton says that Congress could create such mechanisms but in reality a lot of these fears were justified because as the federal government grew there is a serious move to to grow the federal law enforcement bodies virtually every branch of the Federal Executive now has some sort of law enforcement agency attached to it with guns and with them with bulletproof vests and the whole deal and that's because in the end the government is essentially a group of people with guns okay the government is a body that is made for force as as knock would say and so here's what Hamilton says is what shadow of day here here is his guarantee against federal tyrannies is what shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feeling sentiments habits and interests what reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for the militia and to command its services when necessary while the particular states are to have the sole and exclusive appointment of the officers if it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the state audit wants to extinguish its the idea was that there'd be these state militia that we call that by the federal government is supplementing as supplementary forces there'd be this core of experts at the federal government level and they would be the expert military and then the states would supplement that with the National Guard for example in reality obviously the Army has grown way beyond these bounds the military's one way beyond these bounds for both good and for ill in some cases so Alexander mostly for good I think but in terms of threats to to state rights that don't involve actual horrible racism and Jim Crow and slavery it's it's not great the federal government has the capacity to override everybody okay so time for Federalist paper number 30 so Federalist 30 now Hamilton shifts topics in Hamilton instead of talking about the standing military he's going to talk about why the federal government should be able to levy taxes directly so under the Articles of Confederation which preceded the formation of the Constitution of the United States the federal government requested money from the state government so they would say we need this much money from you Connecticut and Connecticut would have to turn in the money one problem Connecticut wouldn't turn in the money so Alexander Hamilton says listen we can't run a federal government along these bases he says national credit will be destroyed if we can't levy taxes to support issuance of bonds for example when we are in the middle of a war he says money is with proper with propriety considered as the vital principle of the body politic as that which sustains its life in motion and enables it to performance most essential functions a complete power therefore to procure a regular and adequate supply of it as far as the resources of the community will permit may it be regarded as an indispensable ingredient in every Constitution from a deficiency in this particular one of two evils must ensue either the people must be subjected to continual plunder as a substitute for a more eligible motive supplying the public wants order the government must sink into fatal atrophy so either the government's gonna come in and steal your money on an occasional basis or they're going to collapse oh the federal government will collapse does it seem to be doing under the Articles of Confederation and then he makes the argument that we need a system that allows the federal government to tax directly the citizens of the United States now the income tax was not a thing the income tax was not constitutional until the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution which happened in the early 20th century up until then most taxes were through the form of property taxes on the state level import taxes on the federal level and the coming that come the the government was able to run on that basis the government was able to run on the basis of that now I've advocated for national sales tax I think Hamilton probably would have advocated for the same but that is not this just because I think tariffs are generally bad policy and using them as a way to garner revenue seems like seems like a mistake but here is here is what Hamilton says if we don't have the power to tax then we're gonna fall into a national debt from which we'll never be able to recover embedded in this message is a simple message for us we now have 20 trillion dollars in national debt the only reason anyone is buying our bonds is because they expect us to pay that off the only reason they expect that to pay us to pay it off is at some point they assume that we will massively tax our own citizenry which means we better get our debt under control or as Hamilton says we're gonna have to tax the living bejesus out of the entire American public okay that is what's happening next that's what's coming next so just have that in mind Hamilton knew it and so should everybody else okay time for a couple of things that I like and then we'll do a couple of things that I hate so here is the thing I like today Van Jones has been talking about bipartisanship with the Trump administration Van Jones actually is working with the Trump administration on a number of issues including Van Jones a communist okay man Jones is working with them on criminal justice reform this idea that no one in the Trump administration is willing to reach out to the other side of the aisle is nonsense Trump is much more willing to reach out to the other side of the aisle than Barack Obama ever was and that is perfectly obvious here's Van Jones talking about it the first step act will actually make their lives better they'll let them earn their way honk home sooner it will stop women prisoners from being shackled and when they're having babies there's a lot of horrific stuff that's been going on that this bill will eliminate and I just can't tell you the entire Democratic leadership in the house including Nancy Pelosi voted with on this bill and for this bill that Donald Trump engineered kuschner before it was a bipartisan breakthrough okay so Van Jones obviously making a good point here and bottom line is that this is true I mean the Obama the Obama ministration never won't breach not Republicans there's no effort to reach out to Republicans Trump's at least trying he's just being refused it's one of the reasons his approval ratings are going up okay time for a quick thing that I hate okay so dr. David Hansen who's created the eerily lifelike Sophia robot has now revealed his vision for a future of androids in a new research paper so here is what he says he says that humans are already making love to sexy robots in 2018 but soon they'll be able to marry their amorous Androids as well so androids will get the same civil rights as humans by the Year 2045 which includes the right to marry own land and vote in general elections good luck good luck with the voting in the general elections although they can't do worse than then most people are doing with their votes so his new paper suggests that people will be marrying robots here's my problem with the whole marrying of robots idea presumably these robots will be unable to procreate right you're not gonna have robot children and they don't actually have you dry they are not capable of making babies it shows the tremendous selfishness that is overtaking our vision of marriage when people are talking about marrying robots obviously because this is a lifeless thing right this is a program thing now maybe AI develops to the point where robots have lifelike intelligence but they certainly don't have the ability to procreate and the notion that you're going to marry a piece of machine because it pleases you this is not what marriage was for as soon as you said that marriage was between any two individuals who loved each other as opposed to an institution about the bearing and rearing of children you're immediately running down the path to people marrying whatever it was that they pleased also you do have to ask the question whether you can actually get proper consent from a sex robot you know if we're gonna be in the area of consent it seems to me that you know animals can't give consent I guess the idea what the the robot is the robot isn't the lives who cares I mean you're just you know presumably having sex with a chair essentially but at a certain point there will be serious moral issues with you having sex within it with a with an Android if the Android achieves a certain level of intelligence and this is something that people who are participating in this sort of activity ought to consider it's funny actually Silicon Valley sort of dealt with some of these issues actually in the last in the last season in a very funny way but what it really goes to is the human beings have decided that all of the universe is about fulfilling our solipsistic desires this seems to me uh turley untrue particularly in the realm of marriage any successful marriage is based on precisely the opposite notion so maybe you will be pleased to marry a robot but if so what you really have is not a marriage it's you pleasing yourself in every sense of the world in in every sense of the word okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with a lot more this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Sonia Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer is Mathis Glover and our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Jess wah alvera the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright Ford publishing 2018
