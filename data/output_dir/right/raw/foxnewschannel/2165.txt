00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,955
THREE YEARS SINCE TWO BROTHERS

HEBDO".

10
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:24,669

00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:28,273
OTHERS INJURED.

14
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:28,974
THE ATTACKERS MANAGED TO GET

15
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:30,308
OUT OF THE OFFICE AND CONTINUED

16
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,043
FIRING SHOTS IN THE STREETS

17
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:33,144
OUTSIDE OF PARIS AND NOW THE

18
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:35,747

SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HIS PAST TO

21
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:41,686
DERADICALIZATION AND HOW HE IS

22
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:45,056
HOPING TO HELP OTHERS DO THE

23
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,357
SAME.

24
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:45,857
INTERESTING TWIST.

25
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:46,925
AMY KELLOGG HAS THE STORY LIVE

00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:47,926
WITH US NOW.

27
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:49,494
WHAT DID YOU LEARN?

28
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:51,596
>> IT IS RARE TO GET INSIGHT

29
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:54,933
INTO THE MINDSET OF A JIHADIST

30
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,269
AND EXTREMELY RARE TO HEAR ONE

31
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:57,602
REPENT.

32
00:00:57,602 --> 00:01:01,940
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL DOUBT THE

33
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,407
SINCERITY.

34
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,943
OTHERS SAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE

35
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:06,378
LIVED AND BEEN DISILLUSIONED

36
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:08,680
ARE THE MOST RESPECTIVE TOOLS

37
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,783
TO DEBUNK THE ISIS PROPAGANDA

38
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,184
DESPITE THE FALL OF ISIS

39
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:16,421
TERRITORY IS AS OUT THERE AS

40
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:18,290
EVER.

41
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,293
A FRENCHMAN OF ALGERIAN DESCENT

42
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:25,597
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE

43
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:30,268
DERADLY INDICATION EXPERTS TO

44
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:34,005
GET FRENCH EXTREMISTS OFF THEIR

45
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:34,372
IDEOLOGY.

46
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:35,640
HE WAS A LOST SOUL AND IT LED

47
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,843
TO A CAREER AS A PREACHER AND

48
00:01:38,843 --> 00:01:39,945
RECRUITER OF YOUNG FRENCHMEN TO

49
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:42,514
GO TOIR ACT TO FIGHT.

50
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:43,748
THE BROTHERS WHO MURDERED 12

51
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:49,421
PEOPLE AROUND THE OFFICES OF

52
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,189
"CHARLIE HEBDO" IN PARIS WERE

53
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,490
HIS DISCIPLES UNTIL 2005.

54
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,527
HE WAS CLOSE TO ONE BROTHER,

55
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:55,860
SHARIF.

56
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,395
THEY WERE ARRESTED FOR THEIR

57
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:57,796
ACTIVITIES.

58
00:01:57,796 --> 00:02:00,932
THEY DIDN'T DO MUCH JAIL TIME.

59
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:08,205
ODDLY IN JAIL THEY MANAGED TO

60
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,841
DERADICALIZED WHILE ONE MORE

61
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,208
HARDENED.

62
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,210
HE FEELS A SENSE OF

63
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,677
RESPONSIBILITY.

64
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:15,547
>> IT IS I WHO GAVE HIM THE

65
00:02:15,547 --> 00:02:16,348
IDEOLOGY AND ENCOURAGED HIM AT

66
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,116
A TIME TO GO TO IRAQ.

67
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,652
WHEN HE HAD DOUBTS, I HELPED

68
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:21,119
DISPEL THEM.

69
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:24,189
I PARTICIPATED IN SOME WAY.

70
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,357
>> IT'S INTERESTING HE SAYS THE

71
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:28,526
FACT THAT HE WAS NOT HANGING

72
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:31,329
OUT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN PRISON

73
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:34,833
HELPED HIM DERADICAL EYES AND

74
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,500
LONG-TIME JEWISH NEIGHBORS

75
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,402
EMBRACED HIM WHEN HE WAS

76
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:38,570
RELEASED FROM JAIL KNOWING WHAT

77
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,071
HE WENT TO JAIL FOR HELPED HIM

78
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,406
UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A WAY OUT

79
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,173
OF ALL THIS.

80
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,676
PERHAPS THAT'S A LESSON TO THE

81
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:45,276
PRISON SYSTEMS.

82
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:46,778
THE BOTTOM LINE NOW THERE ARE

83
00:02:46,778 --> 00:00:00,000
19,000 PEOPLE SAID TO BE
