ice has been given permission to utilize data that has been collected by a company known as vigilant solutions vigilant solutions is a company that has collected data on our license plates and they have been tracking each and every one of us and that data is very valuable to ice agents who want to really ramp up their efforts in deporting undocumented immigrants now ice has officially gained agency-wide access to a nationwide license-plate recognition database so this impacts every single one of us and the amount of information they have on us because of this license plate tracking is really something that concerns me it gives the agency access to billions of license plate records and new powers of real-time location tracking so to give you an idea of how much data there is on our whereabouts and on these license plates vigilant solutions has amassed a database of more than 2 billion license-plate photos by ingesting data from partners like vehicle repossession agencies and other private groups they've also partnered up with local law enforcement agencies often collecting even more data from camera-equipped police cars so to give you a sense of how they would track us and how easily they could do so as a result of this new power that they've been given a historical search would turn up every place a given license plate has been spotted in the last five years a detailed record of the targets movements the data could be used to find a given subjects residence or even identify associates if a given car is regularly spotted in a specific parking lot also ice agents can receive instantaneous email alerts whenever a new record of a particular plate is found a system known internally as a hot list mmm clever name yeah just two things jump out about this one I always like to focus on the whole like amazing infrastructure going back to the Bush administration of all the private companies that it's like a self licking ice cream cone that's another reason why certain tech types actually we're interested in Trump there's a ton of money to be made in contracts really distracting people but I mean beyond escalating this sort of vicious attack on immigrants you've had administration officials float even you know looking at politicians and sanctuary cities that aren't enforcing these laws supposedly church groups are being monitored so when you talk about the jump from how can this type of massive invasion of all of our civil liberties we'll start to translate beyond the abuse of immigrants it's going to go to civil society that's trying to protect people's rights and you're gonna see that bridge immediately and it will also be a self licking ice cream cone so that even if these things are reformed these companies are gonna have a whole new gravy train of contracts that came out of the bush administration with private contractors and forces in Afghanistan and Iraq so here's a fun prediction almost guarantee that they will track people go into certain churches because certain churches will be hiding undocumented immigrants because Joel Osteen's probably okay yeah because the immigrant hunters are coming but no that goes exactly to my point and my prediction is that the right wing won't even care that they're tracking churches nope that you know for like hey it was one thing when they were trying mosques and their people were right-wing was ecstatic about those are terrorists yeah now when it comes to churches they're they're tracking which churches you've got to they still won't care because they'll think those are Latino churches or churches that support Latinos right it's not gonna go I'm going to Joel Osteen there nobody's tracking that I'm I'm going to Copeland I'm going to people who I'm giving money to so they can buy jets I'm going to the prosperity gospel guys I'm an idiot nobody needs to track this is the federal government this is the federal government not just tracking undocumented immigrant they're tracking all of us they have all this data on where we are who we associate with where we work where we hang out they have all this data on us this is the definition of big government big brother is watching us and this is I mean this is part and parcel of what this country has become right you have politicians who fear monger about disenfranchised groups or politicians who fear monger about the others those big scary others so then everybody is so scared that they give away any and all privacy any and all freedom that they have because they're you know peeing in their pants over honestly non threats and yeah and and and and and to this point is where the Obama critics are dead on because of course right he expanded the surveillance they expanded the George W Bush survey highlighted and codified it and yeah I it's okay I can I would be able to live with it maybe I'm a hypocrite well I'm definitely ever crypt but I would be able to live with it if I knew that for the rest of time the Obama guys were gonna run it but that of course will never happen and of course then look what happened look who gets in charge of it and that's why hopefully if there ever is a vaguely progressive person running for office they'll say the words one of the things I'm gonna do in my first hundred days is massively rollback the surveillance then just and it's big government a big corporate it's a hybridization yeah and it's a really into jet point they'll come after the politician who says that absolutely will and I think that when I was debating people like a couple years ago saying Obama does all of these programs so it's fine I would say okay I don't agree with that but let's take your premise and I would try to think of the most insane person that could be elected president and I didn't quite quite you didn't come close enough so well let's expand about first of all just so you know the reason they're saying it's agency wide is because the Obama administration had some portions of ice already apply this yeah so they were already doing this to some degree and real progressives like us hated it back then and and now they've made it for the entirety of ice and and by the way Obama thought about making it for the entirety of ice but he got a ton of pushback so he's like okay some parts value of who you have at the table like it turns out of course that matters but again we're never gonna we're not gonna have 48 straight years of responsible people at least getting a seat at the table value if we could push yeah and this is the main warning we had when Obama was doing all this stuff don't open the door you don't know who comes next but he kept opening one door after another after another that was a terrible idea and including invasions of privacy drone strikes etc so now to the Republicans are right-wing out there you don't want them tracking your guns you go nuts over that by the way if they're tracking your cars and that means they know where your residences that means they know where your guns are sometimes you have your guns in your car they know where they are apparently you don't care about yourself or your family so I'm trying to get it you to care about the one thing you care about guns so they could also track your guns this way in a sense and then what happened to the lunatic right wing which is a significant percentage of the right wing you thought there was gonna be FEMA camps under Obama hey oh my god they're gonna put us in FEMA camps so let's not reverse the argument we've been making you think Trump is a benign dictator I mean president and so you think no him spying on all of us not just the immigrants they're collecting all of our license plates right and they know which parking lot you're going to think about the part we have our next Muslim president right no that's where I'm going this thing about the parking lots you've been in right wing guys think about the places that you have gone to so what happens when a progressive president comes in and you and your lunatic might think that they're gonna set up FEMA camps right it will have all of your information right then they could use it against you if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash join get the whole younger so every
