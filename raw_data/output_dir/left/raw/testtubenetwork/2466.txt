1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,899
The U.N. estimates that 2.5 billion people
do not have access to proper toilets or latrines

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:06,019
with

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:13,019
one billion of those people having to defecate
in the open. That is 14% of the human population.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:19,000
India has over 626 million people who are
forced to practice open defecation, followed

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,440
by

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,300
Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia. And this
problem is bigger than being an inconvenience

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,800
or

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,779
discomfort.

9
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,630
According to the United Nations, almost a
million children under the age of 5 die every

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,140
year

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,260
from illness directly related to feces contaminated
wat er. Tack on the fact that 80% of diseases

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,720
and one third of all deaths in developing
countries can be traced back to contaminated

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,450
water,

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,170
and it’s no wonder why the U.N. is calling
for updated toilets that can isolate and sanitize

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,290
waste.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,079
Preventing feces from getting into the water
and soil will not only improve the health

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,570
of hundreds

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,379
of millions of people, but would save countries
a combined $260 billion dollars per year.

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:58,379
This

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,420
high number comes from health care costs,
lack of tourism and money loss due to people

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,159
calling in sick or spending too much time
finding a place to go. For example, people

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,610
in Kenya

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,490
spend an estimated 2.5 days per year trying
to find a place to use the bathroom.

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,810
The negative effect of open defecation on
women is another huge problem. Women living

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:18,909
in

26
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,200
communities where they are forced to leave
their house at night to use the bathroom increases

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,470
the risk of sexual assault and violence. Also,
the lack of privacy offered by having to use

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:28,580
the

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,570
bathroom outside has led to girls dropping
out of school once they hit puberty. One study

30
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:33,950
found

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,290
that 23% of girls in India dropout of school
as a direct result of the lack of private

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:39,799
bathroom

33
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,470
facilities they need in order address their
menstrual cycle.

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,020
So, what is being done about it? Actually
a lot. The United Nations has sponsored World

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,600
Toilet Day to help raise awareness, this included
installing a giant inflatable toilet in front

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,840
of the

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,970
United Nations building in New York. Other
organizations have formed to help join in

38
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,850
the fight,

39
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,710
including the Toilet Board Coalition, which
brings together businesses, experts and non-profits.

40
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,090
And one Indian village took matters into their
own hands. A group of women wake up early

41
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,239
and

42
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,709
greet people on their way to the field to
relieve themselves, taking away the illusion

43
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,329
of= privacy.

44
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:18,629
They also hope that a friendly hello and a
quick chat about open defecation will shame

45
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:18,709
out of

46
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:23,749
doing that activity in the future. It appears
that their tactics are working, as 90% of

47
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:24,180
the village

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,079
now has individual toilets.

49
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,859
