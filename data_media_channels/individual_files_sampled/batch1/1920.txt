I am for me okay then really could be louder and you're in the stream now live on youtube today it's the only country in the world that doesn't allow divorce in the Philippines should couples be allowed to break the bonds of marriage well look at the ongoing debate Pro divorce legislation is facing a difficult battle in the Philippines where a largely Roman Catholic population remains divided over the legal and moral issues related to break a marital contracts a divorce bill still waiting to be addressed by the Senate would expand the reasons for ending a marriage to include abuse infidelity and irreconcilable differences listen to what the former Speaker of the House who was just out stood on Monday said on this issue this is Pantha Leon Alvarez it is so difficult to see the couples living in hell with each other it's a badge of stupidity see you in the bantha named upon her fetus a Paloma the Philippines and Vatican City are the only places in the world where divorce remains illegal so how would legalize divorce impact couples and families with us to discuss this in malabon city Lawrence Quintero he's head of family ministries with the group Couples for Christ Philippines in Manila in diaspora Verona a journalist and women's rights advocate also Manila Ana peace Antos independent journalist whose work focuses on health and gender inequality she's also a single parent and a divorce advocate it's good to have you here everybody Ana you gave us a lesson in what it is like for one person at least to go through that process of trying to end a marriage let me show everybody the piece in the Atlantic as a couple of years old right now but nothing has changed which is why we're all here here's the title ending a married in the only country that bans divorce that marriage was your might I'm not going to go into the nitty-gritty of what happened but the process the process is why some women and some advocates for divorce are really pushing for it in the Philippines if you could explain what are the options your marriage is failing or failed in the Philippines what choices do you have that you can only file for a legal separation which means that you can only like live apart so it doesn't severe the marital bonds you're still married on paper but you can live apart or you can file for annulment of marriage or nullity and that is a very extremely complicated process I apply I filed for nullity of my marriage and it took me four years to get that involvement and during that time because adultery is criminalized in the Philippines and only women could be charged with adultery I couldn't have a relationship I couldn't begin a new one I couldn't buy property because it would be considered conjugal I couldn't change or revert to my maiden name it was literally like my life was in limbo and finally when I had to go to court to testify and defend my annulment case I was relentlessly interrogated by the judge I was made to feel like a criminal for a failed marriage and I guess you know that's how it is in this country it's like I'm worse than a criminal because I had violated marital vows I was a sinner and after even after all of that I should consider myself lucky that I could get an annulment because so many people can't get one either they can't afford it or there's even a possibility of your annulment being denied so try to imagine that you can choose who to marry but if your marriage fails and if you file for an annulment or analogy of marriage the state can actually decide for you to grab that annulment or not they can decide for you who you should stay married to that's just ridiculous Lawrence I'm just wondering here and I just gave an explanation of what the options are if your marriage has failed do you see any issue with those options you have two options yeah I heard what I understand and I will not say that I understand where it is going but again I would like to highlight some options aside from liquor separation in annulment again I hope that people will also realize plenty of friends we have around us we have a lot of courses well who went through a lot of challenges in their lives and though we have a lot of community structure organizations and they've been an organization not church organizations we have a lot of married couples so in assist in help the couples go through the challenges in their married life and for me I would really like to highlight that I would like to push that to prevent the separation you know I don't think anybody and III want to go to you with this but I wanted to pick up on what Lauren said about the assistance because online there are some people who are saying well there are a few things in marriage that there's no assisting one out of this is a Kathryn or assisting one towards a reconciliation rather Kathryn says if this divorce bill passes spouses would be able to end their marriages for reasons like abuse and infidelity they can't right now which means that many women are trapped and abusive and dysfunctional relationships so picking up on that Croatia here says regarding divorce if it's costly even if they're being physically abused by their partners and women are considered strong for putting up with those circumstances rather than allowing them to get out of toxic relationships so and I think for people who are not in the Philippines what might be surprising to them is even in the cases of abuse and detriment to the woman's the health and body she's not allowed to get a divorce can you explain that for us that's true under our laws you're only allowed legal separation and that's a very strange law there because you can't have the opportunity to marry again to find happiness again and also these are crimes you know battery is a crime infidelity bigamy is a crime and yet when you're systematically abused for years and years you're still trapped there in the marriage I mean Lawrence everybody would want counseling and all my friends were now separated deep con through counseling nobody jumps in and says you know I want a divorce people try to save their marriages between em woman has been battered like for years why do we forbid her the chance to get out of hell and find a new life I agree again just like what you said bigger separation is allowed for those in a situation like violence domestic violence yeah it's there so Terry Mary was just like what you said four years of being battered four years of being in a very difficult situation I believe that this people they will be in in a situation of trauma and would these people it or jump into a new new life a new marriage again right there in there I think it will take time as well or then that they will jump into marriage you know they might say I'm telling what we're talking about it stopping them from getting the opportunity to do so with counseling if you want to that's not the same I think what I think what we're talking about here is you know being able to give people options depending on what their circumstances are in life so if a couple is going through some kind of rocky period and they want to seek some kind of counseling Lawrence as you said there are there are organizations like yours that will offer that but I'm also coming from a place of where the marriage is just it's it's just unheard emption and where do you go from there legal separation is not a viable option because it won't allow you to marry again and you're still married on paper can you imagine that you're allowed to live apart you don't need the Lord to tell you that that you can live apart but you do need a lot to allow you to start again to allow you that second chance at happiness and then let's go to the two versions of annulment that are available it's incredibly rigid because there's only a set of predefined criteria that you that will qualify you to apply for an annulment apart from that it's so it's so it's it's insufficient you know those grounds are insufficient because they don't include physical violence they don't include fidelity as grounds for severe in your marriage is a little bit more because this is quite it's gonna be quite surprising because the way that or Norman is set up in the Philippines is it has to be quite combative you cannot say okay we agree that we're not going to be together but we had we had something and now we want to move on you have to prove that your spouse is what Ana right now the for annulment you have to prove they will catch all if you don't fall into any of that preset criteria and it's very rigid a lot of people will cite psychological incapacity as the reason for filing for an annulment and you have to prove psychological incapacity because it's just such a wide catch-all term and you have to cite it's like a bucket where you put in all sorts of things that were wrong with the marriage right terrible things about your spouse and you can think of because you don't want the judge to not give you the annulment exactly and even if they were true you know you if they're especially if there are children involved do you really want to air out your dirty laundry you don't you just want to end this mess and move on amicably you want some kind of uncoupling as they say a very nice uncoupling right it's already bad so you want to turn that kind of situation into something good and also with respect to if there are children involved again these are this is the father of my child it with respect to that you want to be able to get out of that with as much respect and as much dignity as possible and because the annulment process is so adversarial it prevents you from doing that mmm I want to share this story and that's circulating on Twitter from someone with a personal story she says when I was a kid I dreamt to get married and build my own family and then the dream came true unfortunately to the wrong one I'm tied to a monster who made my cloud dark and all I can do is dream again to be free so that's one person's story there but I want to shift to this because it picks up with what you were saying on about the annulments al hombre hair says I support this Bill's legalization because marriage annulment is extremely expensive and it used to be part of our pre-colonial culture and I'm wondering if you can unpack that for us where were the years the average well one you you need a psychiatrist you know to certify that one of you is psychologically incapacitated for marriage okay that's the only well that's one of the most common ways that people get annulment okay um - you got to pay a judge I mean if people understand our court system in the Philippines they're all full of cases judges a single case can take well honest four years some will take as long as 10 years you know and you've got to pay lawyers and everything so 250,000 is the low average for it two hundred fifty thousand pesos would be around more than four thousand dollars but that would mean more than a year of minimum for a minimum wage owner if he or she only spends his income for annulment so it's just beyond people's pockets and so they stay there suffering because they just can't afford it then the divorce bill that has been approved by the House of Representatives allows indigent women and men to free court services when they seek divorce so that's a lot of them I'm hearing your arguments in die and Ana and they are very powerful but I'm also looking at some of the pro staying married protesters one here I'm just looking at here this was just a couple of men months ago in the Philippines where the very religious community in the Philippines is saying no to divorce we uphold the sanctity of marriage and then Laurence on your organization Couples for Christ defending the Filipino family is that what you feel that you're having to do right now staving off these calls for divorce because you are defending the family the concept of the family in the Philippines yeah because you know if we legalize divorce it will be very easy for a lot of couples to just drop their marriage I understand for some situations wherein couples were in very difficult situations like what we have been talking earlier about domestic violence and we don't want to happen not if Milligan is the worse it is not only for those in very difficult situations who will benefit but it will also be used by those couples who just want to get away from their marriage you know it will be very supportive it will be very easy available for those other couples well I don't really see a problem with our Lauren's intuitions you know I don't really see a problem with that Laurence if two people decide to get married then they should be able to freely decide not to be married to one another I mean that's the plain and simple thing for me but also just to go back to the the way that this divorce bill has been drafted it has taken that into consideration the legislators didn't want to make it easy to get a divorce that's why the provisions include a six-month cooling-off period where you file for it and then there's still a six-month waiting period to see if there's a chance at a couple may reconcile and they have also removed chronic unhappiness or citing chronic unhappiness as reasons for getting a divorce and that was all part of making this what they call Filipino style divorce it wasn't going to be made easy for others for people just don't get a divorce just because they wanted one but again I'm saying I don't see anything wrong with that I hear you there I want to bring up a tweet of someone who might agree with Lawrence here this is D MP who says I'm against divorce in the Philippines because as a family oriented country I believe in the great bonding that we have in every family here in our country most of us were raised with supportive loving and caring people around us which is considered our family so so this person clearly they've said family three times in this tweet is really upping that aspect of why people should stay together but this tweet from Manila brings up something different she says married couples don't realize how much their arguments affect their kids mentally sometimes having divorced parents is healthier than living in a household with constant fights Lawrence what's your take on this argument having two people who hate each other in the same household and having children see that what do you think that does to the children of course it is very traumatic for the children who see their parents fight every day and again I think I believe we have we can get support for that we can resolve it again through the help of other people through counseling through other cohorts who are more mature enough to support marriage it's not just your very consistent with the way that you're approaching this issue in the Philippines let me show this with you this is from Pope Francis and he said about three years ago the family separation can be morally necessary I am reading family separation as divorce where he's saying that there are times when there are extreme situations where it is better for that family not to be together but how about society and public opinion in the Philippines how is that changing or how is that changed have a look at this graphic here and you'll see in the green the people who actually want to have divorce for Aaron cuz irreconcilably separated couples I have trouble with that word if you don't like your spouse that's the reason because I have trouble reading that word and you see in 2005 43% but look at the green over the years 2011 2014 2015 2016 2017 consistently more people in the Philippines are interested in this idea of having divorce than are not what is that saying in died about public appeal I think people realize now that they don't need to remain cropped in very unhappy relationships marriages I grew up in a in a huge loving Catholic family my parents were devout Catholics I'm one of eleven siblings and I am i we were all very happy but it's precisely because they taught us that we have a loving God that I think he would not want anybody woman or man and especially children to be trapped in a living hell and that he would want to allow anybody you know after considerable counseling and you know going through a process with respect the cooling-off period to start life anew and have a chance at happiness so many people we have very high rate of domestic violence in the Philippines you know who we have read we have abused and I think women talking to each other have found strength to say that we need a system where we are given a chance not only to start anew but also to make sure to give our children a chance to have the same economic benefits that they had when we were together and also to to give people a chance to have joint custody of children and it's a more reasonable and more efficient way and I don't think people who have good marriages are going to be tempted to go for divorce just for the heck of it hmm I think there are a lot of members of our community that would completely agree with you and then there are these two comments that I want to bring up when we talk about public opinion this is jet who says being in a religious country I'm against divorce in the Philippines the union of two individuals cannot be separated because they receive a sacrament of marriage from the church meaning they vowed and promised not only to the witnesses that are present but also to God so keep that in mind we also got this live comment on YouTube from someone who says this no divorce policy in the Philippines will make a couple think really really hard before going into married life on a of course you have the privilege out of hindsight but even looking forward and looking towards your friends and people you know what is this done to people who might be thinking about marriage well I think that you know the people who are thinking of I don't know what people are thinking marriage or thinking right now but you know it it definitely is a detriment or some kind of you know it dampens you right to think about not being able to to have a second chance of had at happiness if this doesn't work out what I've always said to people is you know if you are not for divorce then I really really sincerely hope that you will be in a relationship be in a marriage where you won't need one an annulment is an ugly hurtful extremely painful process I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy so I and right now those people who don't need a divorce their rights are protected you know that's a disco but what about those people that we've talking about people like me and other friends that I know and that Lawrence knows and I'm sure and I knows as well who have marriages that are beyond repair and that need a legal solution for them to have a second chance at happiness just like everybody else I think that's all that's all we want us people who are advocating for divorce we just want to level that playing field I know there was a moment where you started to cry just a few minutes ago what were you thinking in that moment well I'm just a little I'm always a little frustrated about how number one it took it was such an artist process to get an annulment for me and it was um it was traumatizing in its own right I didn't feel like I had to be made out to look like some kind of criminal in in the courtroom I still remember that exact I can so remember you know how I was questioned how I was interrogated and having a courtroom of people filled in strangers just looking at you while all of that is happening I can it was more than ten years ago now and I can still tell you exactly how that went so it was extremely traumatizing to say the least but at the same time it's also a point of anger for me because again I'm supposed to consider myself lucky because I got an annulment I had the financial resources to do so whereas other people can't even get to that point and then they have to stay trapped in their marriages it's it's a real complete injustice when you think about the way that the laws are set up it favors people who have the resources people who have the connections to get an annulment and at the end we all just want a second chance at happiness to rectify a mistake and for those people who didn't make a mistake in show as well great your rights are protected you're you you can stay married and sincerely we want all of that you're right so protect we want all of that for others who are happily married and in in Lawrence thank you so much we're gonna wrap up with Malika she's got the the Tempe in the temperature for my online community ended with this from Mitch who says I'm a Catholic myself however I believe in our law being able to support our making autonomous decisions by blocking divorce based on Catholic beliefs to sue me that everyone in this country believes in that and nots an infringement on people's agency Thank You guests for joining us our conversation always continues online look far to the threat at AJ
