got me but I still feel very sad that was the president's reaction when reporters asked him about convicted felon Paul Manafort last week today reporters asked the President of the United States about the death of decorated war hero and Senator John McCain here was why would you say to me my John McCain mr. president you have any thoughts on John McCain you have any thoughts at all about John McCain to do to bleep John McCain was a hero sir nothing at all about John McCain that's just weird right he just got asked several times today many opportunities very clear there was no chance he didn't hear that question and he just looked straight ahead when asked about John McCain it's a layup saying something nice about John McCain is about the easiest thing any American could possibly do today it would come easier than most of your normal errands but all of that came after the Washington Post reported that President Trump refused to release a statement that would have called McCain a quote hero instead he sent a tweet that didn't offer a single word of praise for McCain it said my deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain our hearts and prayers are with you that's nice but no compliment it's not hard to call John McCain a hero it's just not hard at all the White House also broke tradition this morning by placing its flag back at full staff before John McCain's burial even as the Capitol flag remained at half-staff but tonight President Trump appears to be relented after withering criticism from the American Legion which represents two million veterans and criticism from kind of everyone else the White House flag sometime in the three o'clock hour went back to half-staff again late this afternoon and tonight after nearly 48 hours of refusing to utter a positive word about American hero John McCain the president said this also our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Senator John McCain gonna be a lot of activity over the next number of days and we very much appreciate everything that Senator McCain has done for our country so thank you very well that's a start joining us now is Jon Meacham a presidential historian and the author of the soul of America also joining us as Jennifer Rubin a conservative opinion writer at the Washington Post both our MSNBC contributors I mean look Jennifer I'm I'm just trying to keep it under wraps here because I just don't understand I when somebody dies it's just not hard to say something nice about them because they're not gonna know you said anything nice about them so you get to you get to take the win about being mean to them while they were alive I just don't understand why this was such a struggle but more interestingly why he flipped well it's because you're not a raging narcissist that you find it difficult to understand why someone can't say something nice about a dead war hero but Trump is incapable of acknowledging other people's superiority and John McCain was in every way imaginable superior to the president the United States so it was not going to be something that he was going to do willingly and I think he was probably under the impression in that like charlotte's felt like all of the other horrible things he said and done that there would be a little fuss and then things would move on but here he took on the wrong group of people and that is veterans the two million people who are members of or allied with the American Legion I think had an impression on him and from what we understand everyone in the White House in terms of his senior staff in terms of general mattis in terms of even Sarah Huckabee Sanders or basically telling him you need to do this you need to do this now in the past John McCain has resisted that kind of advice but I think he could probably see if he was watching fox's which is where he likes to go even they were praising John McCain so the jig was up and this is not everybody was praising jokes acting and a lot of people who you know I Jon Meacham I talked to a lot of people who would describe John McCain as their nemesis John McCain was a thorn in the side to a lot of people in his party in in in the Democratic Party is there a historical sort of precedent for the idea that the president has or invents a nemesis and then there's just no ability to sort of get partisanship in order to honor that person I John McCain is one of these people that people on the Left honor people on the right honor people say they didn't agree with him but they respected the idea that he put principle before most other things yeah you know the person who presided the longest in that office where he was sitting today where John Karl was giving him the chance to do the right thing was Franklin Roosevelt who said in September of 1932 in the midst of the Great Depression in the midst of his campaign against Herbert Hoover that the presidency is not an engineering or managerial job that's the least of it it is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership that was FDR's vision of the presidency it was also his cousin Theodore's it was the biggest it was the same view that the biggest men so far who have held that office have have adhered to and you know it's I agree with Jennifer and we you know it's it's sweet of you in a way to be somewhat surprised I think it speaks well of your character but we're at a point where I was sort of toting up the list a lot of us got a sense of this with his attack on Senator McCain during the campaign but also the attack on the Khans the gold star family and there's something telling about that I'm practicing psychiatry that a licensed but that's what biographers do he doesn't he has a very hard time acknowledging the courage and sacrifice of others and I think it's because he has fundamental if unacknowledged anxieties about his own virtues so Jennifer Donna John McCain had released he had written a letter had written a statement to Americans that was to be released upon his passing and his longtime friend and former campaign manager Rick Davis read that today there there's an interesting paragraph in here that I want to play that I think is is very telling it's after John McCain talking about America's greatness this is what he wrote these are John's words we weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resent and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe we weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down when we doubt the power of our ideals rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been do not despair of our present difficulties we believe always in the promise and greatness of America because nothing is inevitable here Americans never quit we never surrender we never hide from history we make history so Jennifer putting aside the fact that he said we weaken it when we hide behind walls which seem like a not so veiled attack on on President Trump we weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe there isn't something even remotely partisan about that statement but it does speak to our national anxiety right now and I often say for somebody like you a conservative is this is this is this the kind of thing that Republicans can rally around and say this is what Republicans have stood for in this country for decades prior to Donald Trump showing up it would be my fond hope but at this present juncture I feel that the party has completely lost his way and I think they will salute John McCain they will make nice speeches and then they'll go back to their toady ISM and it is not until the party is delivered one or maybe more devastating election losses that they will come around to see the error of their ways and I think we all think of Donald Trump when we hear those words but those are equally applicable to the Republican Party as a whole which has become this tribalistic know nothing unprincipled party that simply jumps whenever Donald Trump tells them to and is loathe to perform the constitutional obligation which is to check the President of the United States which is to conduct appropriate oversight and so I would like to think that Donald Trump would have finally played his tune out but I see no evidence of that now I will grant you the Republican Party's al smaller these days in part because people like me have left it if you do the math you know you can come up with 10 or 15 million people who no longer identify as Republican so it's a smaller party than it used to be but I still maintain that the only way to rescue the party or to clear the decks is to frankly give them a spanking in November and probably in 2020 as well John let's talk about how the world is going to remember these two men and their their interactions John McCain it wasn't perfect he says it himself there are lots of things that he's criticized for but there are a lot of things for which he is admired and in the end he will be remembered the way he wanted to be remembered a man who served his country hopefully honorably I think those were I'm paraphrasing his own words about how he wishes to be remembered yeah how will history remember him and his relationship with Donald Trump do you think well John McCain is a great American original he's a great American story he's fascinating not least because he feels as though he's a world war two figure though he was younger than that his his heroism was tested in the crucible of Vietnam in captivity and yet when we look at him I think we to some extent we tend to see someone who has more in common with George HW Bush or Bob Dole the the world war two guys who are who are also passing so so quickly seems to me that the contrast between John McCain and the incumbent president will be a useful one for historians and biographers who look at the competing traditions in American life John McCain was someone who in this remarkable last Testament has once again affirmed a big-hearted vision of the country it's a vision that again for all their faults TR had it Ronald Reagan had it John McCain had it Donald Trump represents the other end of that spectrum which is the the tradition of building walls imposing tariffs of constricting the classic conservative ideas of the free movement of thought and people conservatives in in the classical sense are people who want to let freedom go as far as it possibly can as long as it doesn't harm you or me and John McCain represents opening arms Donald Trump today you saw him folds them yeah he certainly did thanks to both of you Jon Meacham and Jennifer Rubin thanks for checking out our
