ken Delaney who's outside the courthouse where George papadopolis was just sentenced to 14 days in jail in one year of supervised release any any insight into what went into that sentence and whether or not that was because Papadopoulos ended up being useful or helpful to the Moller investigators it wasn't because he was useful or helpful Nicole it was because the judge heard him express profound remorse for what he did he said he was deeply ashamed and embarrassed and he apologized to his family and the judge said he took took that into account when passing sentence the judge also noticed that Moute noted sorry that most people charged with this crime of lying to investigators and who are in george papadapolis position with no prior criminal record most of those people are never sentenced to jail at all but the judge found that this was a different case because this was about national security and the judge found that george papadapolis put his own personal interests over the interests of the nation because don't forget let's back up you know george papadapolis was worked essentially by an agent of russian intelligence who approached him who saw him it's low-hanging fruit an advisor to the Trump campaign a junior person 29 years old and this Professor Joseph Massoud told Papadopoulos that the Russians had obtained dirt in the form of thousands of emails on Hillary Clinton Papadopoulos possessed this information and we still don't know to this day who inside the Trump campaign he told about that information but Papadopoulos lawyer Thomas Breen said that after meeting with Smith Sood he Papadopoulos made a lot of efforts to try to broker a meeting between senior Russian officials and the Trump campaign and Papadopoulos his lawyer told the judge that Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions appeared to look favorably on the idea that that meeting should occur and I'll tell you one other really interesting thing that Papadopoulos lawyer said in trying to explain why his client misled the FBI in January 2017 when they went to talking about this he noted that just a few days before Donald Trump had called the Russian investigation fake news and witch-hunt and george papadapolis lawyer said the President of the United States hindered this investigation more than george papadapolis ever could he said the guy he worked for was telling everybody that this investigation was fake news and a witch-hunt the idea being that that those statements by Donald Trump may have influenced George papadopolis when confronted by the FBI about this Russian investigation to mislead the FBI Nicole hey they're armed Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
