why is democratic representative Adam Schiff hysterical and throwing temper tantrums I'm gonna tell you Adam Schiff is absolutely hysterical over Chairman Devin Nunez is the chairman of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence chairman Devin nuñez's memo which details FISA abuses or an Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses presumably by a hierarchy of the DOJ and the FBI also some in the intelligence community on behalf of the Obama White House for Hillary Clinton now we all know that story that stories old now we're waiting for the memo to be released and Schiff is losing his mind but remember when the memo first popped up shift did a counter memo well representative Lee sailed in from New York a guy that I happen to believe in trust that I read both memos one memo details serious abuses by our government and federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies the other is all about damage control and spin of course he was saying that núñez memos accurate and shifts us about damage control and spin Schiff has offered nothing substantive to refute the allegations in Nunez's memo whatever they may be we have a lot of speculation on what they may be and people like trey Gowdy representative trey Gowdy representative Matt gates have alluded to enough on air for us to know what's in that memo FBI Christopher Rae this past Sunday went and read the memo he went up to Congress went to the Capitol read the memo and the next day removed FBI number two Andrew McCabe from his post as deputy director now I researched back to J Edgar Hoover back to the start of the FBI the beginning and ascent stages of the FBI I could have missed one but I don't think I did I research this for quite a while I was not able to find one single solitary instance of a director removing a deputy director now there were instances of deputy directors retiring resigning to go to the private sector leaving to go to other agencies moving within the FBI moving to task forces within the intelligence community things like that but I couldn't find one instance of a director reading a memo that alleged wrongdoing by the deputy director on a Sunday no less and then removing the deputy director the next day I could not find one instance of that but when Democrats downplayed this and say oh it's no big deal McCabe oh he stepped down he was ready to retire they're lying to you not true this is historical this has never happened since the FBI came to me it's never happened and that's why Jeff is hysterical now shifts new allegation is that Devin Nunez egret Lee changed wording in the memo he's saying that there are glaring inaccuracies and and distortions well Biron New York over the Washington Examiner spoke to some sources on the committee who said well the changes were grammatical and some changes were put into place by the Dems and the FBI themselves and then the committee confirmed that a committee spokesman said well the changes to the memo were minor edits such as grammatical changes in to edits requested by the FBI and the minority themselves the minority being the Democrats now if they were requested by the minority that means they were requested by Adam chef Adam Schiff is the ranking Democrat the ranking minority member on the house permanent Select Committee for intelligence meaning he he and he alone speaks for the Democrats with anything generated by or coming out of the committee so if the minority recommended edits to the memo additions or changes to the mammal and they were implemented that came from Adam Schiff to Devin Nunez so shift making it seem as if he was unaware of these changes now most likely ally or chef gave Nunez disinformation to put into the memo in an attempt to discredit the memo either way this little plot blew up in chefs face he looks like a fool now let's think about the double standard here it's not OK for the chairman of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who take the recommendations of the FBI and Democrats his minority ranking member on the committee and implement those changes that's not okay it's not okay to rework your grammar to make it proper and correct order fix spelling errors typos that's not okay those are crises but the FBI changing polonius criminal culpability from grossly negligent who non criminal extremely careless well that's no big deal there's another scary trend here when you dilute it all down and you look at what shifts real objections are their process well I wasn't told about these edits well that we know that's not true because if they came from the minority he knew all about him and he was there when Christopher Rea was reading the memos of the FBI recommended edits he was standing and sitting or sitting in the room when director a recommended those edits and they were implemented that's the double standard right that's the big double standard but let's think about the process piece of this who knowing all that knowing all that ship is still objecting to the process by which it was done well who else objected the process or used process while combing deflected changing grossly negligent - extremely careless using the process argument Hilary herself well she never denied her emails were classified right she used a process argument as to how they got from point A to the server in her bathroom that was her only defense the process homies only defense the process chefs only claim the process who else is using process robert muller there is no underlying crime of russia' collusion crimes consisting of russia' collusion there is no underlying obstruction of justice charge because you'd have to have been obstructing justice on something in if there was no rush of collusion there was nothing on which to obstruct justice but Muller's got nothing but he's prosecuting people on process crimes Wow the Democrats and their cronies love process they use it to deflect and swat away allegations they use it to prosecute their enemies process crimes nothing substantive nothing material no underlying crimes all about process that's a very big problem when we have a senior ranking member the ranking Democrat on the committee not wanting transparency for the American people now what I say as an American as a conservative as a believer in the rule of law as a brief believer in the First Amendment as a former cop open up the books open it all up show us everything have hearings under oath not closed-door committee hearings in DC put him on c-span put him on television put him on CNN put him on Fox let every witness every asset every subject everybody surrounding this situation of potential Phi sub uses of the Malheur investigation of what went on inside the FBI in the IC put them on television put the one on one's on that are good for the Republicans put the ones on who are good for the Democrats release shifts memo as well as Nunez's memo release it all and let the American public decide what's best for us let us make our decision but Democrats don't want to do that remember when I analyzed the State of the Union I said that the National Black Caucus was sitting like this and was mad and Antipolo seizes weird old meth Jawas call it like this it's not because they hate Donald Trump it's because he debunked their line they don't want transparency Democrats want to tell you you're no good without us the Congressional Black Caucus exists because it tells black Americans you're not smart enough you're not good enough you don't work hard enough you're too incompetent to get ID to vote then Trump lays out a path for black Americans saying you are good enough you are smart enough we want you to be wealthy we want you to be prosperous we want to give you the same educational opportunities here's the money here are the opportunities here you go the markets are soaring we're not gonna give you handouts but if you work a little harder if you go for that brass ring you can have it and black Americans say you know what it's right or working got more money in our checks we've got our bonuses we've got lower taxes we're taking our kids to Disney World we're buying them more Christmas presents hey Democrats hey Congressional Black Caucus you've been lying to us for years Donald Trump's making our lives pretty good with this new paycheck this increased paycheck the Democrats are terrified and that's what they're doing with the memo either chef in in true Democrat fashion it's telling the American people you're too stupid too simple too basic too rudimentary to understand what's in all this complex FBI and legal and governmental stuff you won't understand it so just take you don't even need to see you don't need to see it you just take my word for it Devin Nunez is lying to you this is so complicated you you measly peons you're never gonna understand this take my word for it they're lying hillary was wonderful the Democrats are great Trump is terrible Nunez is corrupt let Muller run unfettered leave McCabe alone put him back in his job nothing happened take my word for it I'm a Democrat the government is here to help we'll take care of you come to Big Brother and big sister but Americans are an having it they're sending the hashtag released the memo viral they want it released because we're sick of career politicians lying to us we're sick of it we don't want it anymore we're over it we're done with it the game is up and that's why Adam chef is absolutely hysterical because he's got nothing this memo when released in mana hope its today is going to be absolutely damning for Democrats damning people are gonna lose their careers people may go to jail over this the American people are gonna understand how their federal law enforcement agency's most terrifyingly the ones with badges guns how are over s power of prosecution were weaponized on behalf of one political party and one political candidate who I say open the books open it all up put the witnesses on television put everybody on television on the record out in the open democracy dies in darkness and sunlight is the best disinfectant if you like
