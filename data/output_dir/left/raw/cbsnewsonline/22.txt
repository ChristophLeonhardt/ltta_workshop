GREAT MAN, GREAT PERSON.

7
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:20,587
FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE BRETT

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,855
KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED RADICAL

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,126
DEMOCRATS WERE ON A MISSION TO

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:26,693
RESIST, OBSTRUCT, DELAY,

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,728
DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY.

12
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,264
THEY WANT TO DESTROY THAT MAN

13
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,866
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY ME

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,801

15
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,369
ME WE UNDERSTAND.

16
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,338
HIM, HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

17
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,640
THEY WANT TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,675
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE GOOD AT.

19
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:42,942
RESISTING.

20
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,177
THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS RESIST.

21
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:51,084
OURS IS TO CREATE.

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,586

23
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:57,357
AND HIS BEAUTIFUL FAMILY IS A

24
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,592
NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT, A

25
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,093
NATIONAL DISGRACE.

26
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,728
YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU

27
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,964

28
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:05,197
YOU SEE.

29
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,366
INCLUDING THE PHONY PROTESTERS

30
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:14,040
THAT GOT PAID, AND NOW THEY WANT

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,174
TO PROTEST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

32
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:20,280
GET PAID YET AND THEY WANT THEIR

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,480
MONEY.

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,683
SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY

35
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,184
PROTEST.

36
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,285

00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:51,844

00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:52,145

54
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,149
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO

00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,015
ME ANYMORE TONIGHT.

56
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:59,486
IN FACT, IF YOU DID EARLY VOTING

57
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,088

58
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:02,288

THANK YOU.

60
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,724
WE'LL LET SOME ADDITIONAL PEOPLE

61
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,858
FROM OUTSIDE IN, RIGHT?

62
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,293
NO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

63
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,495
GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE.

64
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,130
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

65
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,804
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

66
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,904
IT NEVER CHANGES.

67
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,740
COULD I ASK THE CAMERAS TO JUST

68
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:29,516
TAKE A SWOOP OF THIS ROOM

69
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,783
PLEASE?

70
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,819
THEY DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT.

71
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,821
THEY DON'T LIKE TO -- THEY LIKE

72
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,056

73
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:42,729
ME AND ABOUT SIX PEOPLE IN THE

74
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,029
BACKGROUND.

75
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,199
ALL WEARING HATS SAYING MAKE

76
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:55,041
FARMERS GREAT AGAIN AND WE'RE

00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,944

78
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,481
EARLY, SO I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING

79
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:01,714

80
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,817
WE'RE GOING WITH 515 YEAR ROUND,

81
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,720
OKAY -- E15 YEAR ROUND, OKAY?

82

I MADE THAT PROMISE TO YOU

83
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,088
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

84
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:12,692
I MADE THAT PROMISE TO YOU

85
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,726
DURING THE PRIMARIES, REMEMBER?

86
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:17,497
I MADE THAT PROMISE.

87
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:27,340
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT.

88
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,540

89
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,242
ON NOVEMBER 6TH, YOU HAVE THE

90
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,978
CHANCE TO STOP THE RADICAL

91
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,080
DEMOCRATS BY ELECTING A

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,515
REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND A

93
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:35,915
REPUBLICAN SENATE.

94
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:42,088
SO WE NEED THE VOTES.

95
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,790
WE HAVE A MAJORITY THAT IF ONE

96
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,358
PERSON HAS A COLD WE HAVE TO

97
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,592
HOLD THE VOTE.

98
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,528
WE DON'T HAVE -- IT'S LIKE WE

99
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,430
HARDLY HAVE A MAJORITY.

100
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,630
WE NEED VOTES.

101
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,365
EARLY VOTING IS NOW UNDERWAY.

102
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,434
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

103
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,769
YOU GOT TO GET OUT EARLY VOTING.

104
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,071
GO OUT NOW AND VOTE.

105
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,438
LEAVE HERE NOW IMMEDIATELY.

106
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:00,973
IS IT STILL OPEN?

107
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:01,207
YES.

108
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,110
GET THE OUT OF HERE.

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,443
EARLY VOTING.

00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,847
AND IN THEIR LUST FOR POWER, THE

111
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,351
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME TOTALLY

112
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:11,618
UNHINGED.

113
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,187
THEY'VE GONE CRAZY.

114
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,789
NO, THEY'VE GONE CRAZY.

115
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,925
NOW THE DEMOCRATS, OR AS SOME

116
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:25,631
PEOPLE WOULD SAY, THE DIMS, THE

117
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,232
DIMS.

118
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,333
WHO SAYS THAT?

119
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:34,073
LOU TO BEBS, THE -- LOU DOBBS,

120
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,541
THE GREAT LOU DOBBS.

121
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,879
SEAN HANNITY SAYS THAT.

122
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,179
THE DIMS.

123
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:46,919
JUDGE JANINE SAYS THAT, DOESN'T

124
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,085
SHE?

125
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,189
LAURA, LAURA, HOW COULD HAS

126
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,225
LAURA BEEN, RIGHT?

127
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,395
WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE.

128
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,197
DO WE LIKE TUCKER?

129
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:03,202
I LIKE TUCKER.

130
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:03,970
HE SAYS IT.

131
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,473
HOW ABOUT STEVE DUCEY?

132
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,274
HOW ABOUT BRIAN?

133
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,710
WE GOT A LOT OF GREAT FRIENDS.

134
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,214
THE DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN TALKING

135
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,318
ABOUT DOING REALLY BAD THINGS

136
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,487
NOW TO JUSTICE KAVANAUGH.

137
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,990
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING

138
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,190
ABOUT?

139
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,058
AND PACKING THE COURTS WITH

140
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:27,226
RADICAL JUDGES TO OVERRULE THE

141
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,294
WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

142
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,297
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, FOLKS.

143
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:37,203
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

144
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,873
LAST WEEK THEY'R SAYING WE'LL

145
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,173
IMPEACH HIM.

146
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:46,078
IMPEACH HIM FOR WHAT?

147
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:46,345
FOR WHAT?

148
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,848
BESIDES THAT I HAVE TO GO FIRST,

149
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,148
RIGHT?

150
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,884
DON'T I HAVE TO GO?

151
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,218
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE NOTHING

152
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,654
WRONG OTHER THAN CREATE ONE OF

153
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,191
THE GREATEST ECONOMIES IN THE

154
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:06,065
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

155
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,800
THAT'LL BE INTERESTING.

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,469
YOU GET IMPEACHED FOR HAVING

157
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,436
CREATED THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN

158
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,305
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

159
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,207
THE BEST JOB NUMBERS IN THE

160
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,944
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, JUST

161
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:18,144
ABOUT.

162
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:18,344
RIGHT?

163
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,379
THE GREATEST TRADE DEALS WHICH

164
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,081
WE'VE JUST FINISHED IN THE

165
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:27,019
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

166
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,589
THE BIGGEST REGULATORY CUTS, BY

167
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,859
FAR, ALREADY IN LESS THAN TWO

168
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,092
CLEARS.

169
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,360
BIGGER THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT

170
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,300
DURING THEIR ENTIRE TERM OR

171
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,634
TERMS.

172
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,236
THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN REFORMS.

173
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,873
YOU GOT A LOT OF MONEY BACK IN

174
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,508
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

175
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,677
BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME

176
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,214
TOO EXTREME, AND THEY'VE BECOME,

177
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,184
FRANKLY, TOO DANGEROUS TO

178
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,585
GOVERN.

179
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,022
THEY'VE GONE WHACKO.

180
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,958
THEY'VE GONE SO FAR LEFT THAT

181
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,629
THEY CONSIDER POCAHONTAS TO BE A

182
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,497
RATIONAL PERSON.

183
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,731
IT'S CRAZY.

184
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:13,365
ELIZABETH WARREN.

185
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:14,834
OH, I HOPE SHE RUNS.

186
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,602
I HOPE SHE RUNS.

187
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,104
THEN WE CAN FINALLY GET DOWN TO

188
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,107
THE FACT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

189
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,377
SHE HAS INDIAN BLOOD.

190
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,446
BECAUSE SO FAR SHE'S NOT DOING

191
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:27,713
TOO WELL.

192
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,583
HER MOTHER SAYS SHE HAS HIGH

193
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,050
CHEEKBONES.

194
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,350
THAT'S WHY.

195
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,153
AND SHE'S GOTTEN A LOT OF

196
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,321
ADVANTAGES BY FALSELY CLAIMING

197
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:35,954
WHAT SHE'S CLAIMED.

198
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,190
SO I HOPE SHE'S ONE OF THE

199
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,490
FINALISTS.

200
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,760
BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK TOO

201
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,261
MANY OF THEM, BECAUSE MAYBE BY

202
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,464
DOING I'LL KNOCK THEM ALL OUT

203
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:45,932
EARLY.

204
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,166
AND I'LL ACTUALLY END UP

205
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,801
SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT SOME TALENT.

206
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,268
THEY WOULDN'T BE GOOD.

207
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,236
SO WE HAVE TO BE NICE AND QUIET.

208
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,539
I SHOULD BE REALLY QUIET.

209
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,541
REALLY REALLY QUIET ON THE BAD

210
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,375
ONES.

211
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,077
ON THE BAD ONES.

212
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,279
LIKE WE WON'T TALK ABOUT CORY

213
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:08,154
BOOKER WHO RAN NEWARK INTO THE

214
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,387
GROUND.

215
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:14,093
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT DA NANG DICK

216
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,095
WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE FOR

217
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,898
15 YEARS THAT HE WAS A GREAT WAR

218
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,098
HERO.

219
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,866
THEY WERE GOING DOWN LEFT, THEY

220
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,268
WERE GOING DOWN RIGHT.

221
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:23,468
RIGHT?

222
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:25,771
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS.

223
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,071
BLUMENTHAL.

224
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,573
HE SAID THEY WERE GOING DOWN ON

225
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:27,806
MY LEFT.

226
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,208
THEY WERE GOING DOWN.

227
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,510
HE WAS IN DA NANG PROVINCE,

228
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,245
EXCEPT THE ONE PROBLEM, IT'S

229
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,514
HARD TO BE THERE BECAUSE HE WAS

230
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,048
NEVER IN VEET NAMG.

231
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,515
BUT THESE -- VIETNAM.

232
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,385
BUT THESE ARE MINOR DETAILS.

233
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,822
THEN HE GETS UP AND SAYS I

234
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:47,493
DEMAND TOTAL HONESTY AND

235
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:47,826
TRANSPARENCY.

236
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:48,928
HE WANTS HONESTY.

237
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,196
GREAT WAR HERO.

238
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:55,367
HE'S A GREAT HERO.

239
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:55,567
YEAH.

240
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:55,767
RIGHT.

241
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,304
HOW ABOUT SENATE TOR FEINSTEIN?

242
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,972
-- SENATOR FEINSTEIN?

243
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,074
THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY.

244
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,408
THAT'S A BEAUTY.

245
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:08,948
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENTS?

246
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,148
WHAT?

247
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,248
NO, I DIDN'T DO IT.

248
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:14,186
DID WE LEAK THEM?

249
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,590
DID WE LEAK?

250
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,190
NO, NO.

251
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,992
NO WE DIDN'T.

252
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,460
DID YOU EVER SEE, NO.

253
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:33,739
HE JUST SAID NO WE DIDN'T LEAK.

254
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,608
AND I THINK THEY'RE TALKING

255
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,576
ABOUT FEINSTEIN.

256
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,843
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

257
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,913
NOW, WAS THAT THE WORST BODY

258
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,346
LANGUAGE HONESTLY.

259
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:45,817
IN OTHER WORDS, DID SHE LEAK IT?

260
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:46,018
100%.

261
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:46,251
NO, NO.

262
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,288
I DON'T WANT TO GET SUED.

263
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:49,455
99%.

264
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:53,425
SEE, NOW I CAN'T GET SUED.

265
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,762
YOU DON'T HAND MATCHES TO AN

266
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,163
ARSONIST.

267
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,731
AND YOU DON'T GIVE POWER TO AN

268
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,899
ANGRY LEFT WING MOB.

269
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:06,038
AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS

270
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:06,906
HAVE BECOME.

271
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,175
THEY WOULD TURN OUR COUNTRY SO

272
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,777
FAST INTO VENEZUELA.

273
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,679
AND VENEZUELA'S NOT DOING TOO

274
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:13,979
WELL, FOLKS.

275
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,348
IF YOU WANT TO DRAIN THE SWAMP,

276
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,184
YOU MUST DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS OR

277
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:25,458
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF

278
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,192
A SWAMP.

279
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,426
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,

280
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,595
AMERICA IS BOOMING.

281
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,630
AMERICA IS THRIVING.

282
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,802
AND AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN

283
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,605
LIKE NEVER BEFORE BECAUSE WE ARE

284
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:44,676
FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.

285
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:47,613
THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

286
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,116
HAS FALLEN TO 3.7%.

287
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:54,520
YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE?

288
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,753
3.7%.

289
00:10:54,753 --> 00:11:00,059
THE LOWEST IN 50 YEARS.

290
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:00,292
5-0, 50.

291
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,094
AND IT'S GOING BETTER.

292
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,430
IT'S GOING BETTER.

293
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,567
IOWA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 2.5%

294
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:17,610
AMONG THE LOWEST IN ITS HISTORY.

295
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,412
AND BY THE WAY, WE NEED PEOPLE

296
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:20,712
HELPING YOU.

297
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,614
WE NEED PEOPLE COMING IN.

298
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,482
WE NEED PEOPLE TO RUN THE FARMS.

299
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,917
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE

300
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,184
COMING IN.

301
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,453
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN

302
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:27,686
LEGALLY.

303
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,555
AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN

304
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,089
THROUGH MERIT.

305
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:52,778
IT'S CALLED THE MERIT SYSTEM.

306
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,880
AND WE BUILT THE WALL.

307
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,447
WE STARTED.

308
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:58,250
A LOT OF IT IS GETTING DONE NOW.

309
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,421
WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION AND ANOTHER

310
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:02,754
$1.6 BILLION.

311
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,956
AND ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION.

312
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,159
I WANT THEM TO GIVE US THE MONEY

313
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,528
SO WE CAN -- WE CAN BUILD IT IN

314
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:09,829
A YEAR.

315
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,897
A LOT OF IT, IT'S GOING UP RIGHT

316
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,131
NOW.

317
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,066
BUT YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS FEEL

318
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,935
THAT THAT'S ONE THING WE REALLY

319
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,135
WANT.

320
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:22,174
WE GOT OUR MONEY FOR THE

321
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,175
MILITARY, $700 BILLION.

322
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:27,112
WE GOT OUR MONEY TO HELP US OUT

323
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:35,521
WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS, $6

324
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,321
BILLION.

325
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,591
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL,

326
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,093
THEY FEEL WE WANT IT SO BADLY.

327
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,862
BUT WE KEEP GETTING BIG CHUNKS,

328
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:43,695
AND IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

329
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:47,666
WE'RE GOING TO GET IT FINISHED

330
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,635
SOONER THAN ANYONE CAN BELIEVE.

331
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,771
AND IF YOU CAN GET ME SOME

332
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,672
REPUBLICANS, WE'LL GET IT DONE

333
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,072
QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

334
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:58,077
I MEAN WHEN I HAVE TO ASK NANCY

335
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:03,449
PELOSI AND MAXINE WATERS, MAXINE

336
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:03,682
WATERS.

337
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,084
CAN WE BUILD A WALL, MAXINE?

338
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,354
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT WALL

339
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:08,687
BUILT.

340
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,155
SHE DOESN'T WANT A WALL BUILT.

341
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,890
CAN WE BUILD IT?

342
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,225
HOW ABOUT PELOSI?

343
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,094
WE WANT TO BUILD A WALL.

344
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:20,332
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT WALL

345
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:20,532
BUILT.

346
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:20,732
LOOK.

347
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:21,500
IOWA MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE

348
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,370
GROWING AT THE FASTEST RATE AT

349
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,605
MORE THAN -- IN MORE THAN 20

350
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,606
YEARS.

351
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,975
AND IF YOU REMEMBER, THE LAST

352
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,277
ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT

353
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,879
MENTIONING NAMES, THE LAST

354
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,880
ADMINISTRATION SAID

355
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,582
MANUFACTURING JOBS, THEY'RE

356
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:36,782
DEAD.

357
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,083
THEY'RE GONE.

358
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,753
WE HAVE 600,000 HAVE COME BACK

359
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:46,291
SINCE THE ELECTION.

360
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,328
600,000.

361
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,463
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW WORKING

362
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,298
THAN EVER BEFORE.

363
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,732
THINK OF THAT.

364
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,235
AT THIS POINT TODAY, THIS DAY,

365
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,971
WE HAVE MORE AMERICANS BY FAR

366
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,673
WORKING RIGHT NOW WORKING THAN

367
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,709
HAVE EVER WORKED IN OUR COUNTRY

368
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:03,942
BEFORE.

369
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:04,743
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

370
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,078
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

371
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,216
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

372
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,985
TEED I KEPT ANOTHER -- TODAY I

373
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,920
KEPT ANOTHER MAJOR PROMISE, AS I

374
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,623
SAID, TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND

375
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:43,015
NEBRASKA AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

376
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,016
WAIT A MINUTE.

377
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:58,898
I GOT TO DO THAT AGAIN.

378
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,766
I GOT TO DO THAT AGAIN.

379
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,934
I LOVE NEBRASKA.

380
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:05,637
YOU KNOW, WE WON IOWA.

381
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:10,442
WE WON NEBRASKA.

382
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,444
BUT THEY SAID, SIR, YOU'RE

383
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,214
SPEAKING IN IOWA, BUT WE'LL HAVE

384
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:25,524
PEOPLE FROM NEBRASKA.

385
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:32,397
LIKE I SAID, NEBRASKA.

386
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:33,666
OKAY, SO WE HAVE BOTH.

387
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:41,106
BY THE WAY, WE HAVE BOTH GREAT

388
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:41,573
GOVERNORS HERE.

389
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,443
AND I DID THAT JUST IN CASE.

390
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:44,709
SO READY?

391
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,812
I'M GOING TO GO IOWA FIRST.

392
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,280
THEN I'M GOING TO GO NEBRASKA.

393
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,417
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHO THE

394
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,618
I'M SPEAKING TO, OKAY?

395
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,586
BECAUSE THAT WAS A LITTLE

396
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,055
SHOCKING WHAT I JUST HEARD.

397
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,625
SO I'M GOING TO GO -- I'M JUST

398
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:05,531
CURIOUS, OKAY.

399
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:14,106
IOWA.

400
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:34,793
NEBRASKA.

401
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,360
UNBELIEVABLE.

402
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,196
SO THEY SAID, SIR, YOU'RE

403
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,364
SPEAKING IN IOWA, THERE MAY BE A

404
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,100
FEW PEOPLE COMING IN FROM

405
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,367
NEBRASKA.

406
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,470
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

407
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,637
GREAT GOING FELLOWS.

408
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:45,937
GREAT GOING.

409
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:49,041
I'LL TELL MY STAFF, GREAT GOING

410
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:49,441
FELLOWS.

411
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:49,942
DOESN'T MATTER.

412
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,645
WE LOVE BOTH.

413
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,947
WHO CARES?

414
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:55,147
RIGHT?

415
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:55,748
WHO CARES?

416
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,748
WE LOVE THEM.

417
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,717
ALL I KNOW IS YOU'VE GOT A LOT

418
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:05,924
OF FARMERS IN BOTH, RIGHT?

419
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,060
AND MY ADMINISTRATION IS

420
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,827
PROTECTING ETHANOL.

421
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,094
ALL RIGHT?

422
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:14,532
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

423
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,669
TODAY WE ARE UNLEASHING THE

424
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,940
POWER OF E15 TO FUEL OUR COUNTRY

425
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,275
ALL YEAR LONG.

426
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,178
NOEIGHT MONTHS.

427
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:30,582
ALL YEAR LONG.

428
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,084
THE DEMS WILL END ETHANOL.

429
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:33,886
YOU KNOW THAT.

430
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,787
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO APPROVE

431
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:36,020
ETHANOL.

432
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,322
THEY WILL TAKE IT AWAY.

433
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,924
WILL TRY TO MAKE IT LIKE THEY

434
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:39,558
CAN'T DO IT.

435
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,627
BUT THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO TAKE

436
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,796
IT AWAY IF YOU GIVE THEM THE --

437
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,666
SO YOU BETTER GET OUT THERE AND

438
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,604
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS.

439
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,173
WE'VE ALSO ACHIEVED ANOTHER

440
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,341
HISTORIC VICTORY FOR IOWA

441
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,177
FARMERS AND RANCHERS BY

442
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,345
REPLACING THE JOB-KILLING NAFTA

443
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:05,450
WITH AN INCREDIBLE, BRAND NEW,

444
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:11,623
U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT.

445
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,560
THE USMCA.

446
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,094
BUT IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL,

447
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:20,199
THEY WILL TRY TO REVERSE OUR

448
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,068
AMAZING PROGRESS AND PLUNGE OUR

449
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,405
COUNTRY INTO GRIDLOCK, FRANKLY,

450
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,006
INTO POVERTY, ULTIMATELY INTO

451
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:28,206
CHAOS.

452
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,508
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

453
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,977
AND WE'VE NEVER HAD IT LIKE IT'S

454
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:32,344
BEEN NOW.

455
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,079
WE HAVE NEVER HAD IT LIKE IT IS

456
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,245
NOW.

457
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,682
LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY YOU PEOPLE

458
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,015
ARE MAKING.

459
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,785
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING TO DO

460
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,018
WITH IT?

461
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,455
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR

462
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,824
TAXES, IMPOSE SOCIALISM,

463
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,261
DISMANTLE LAW ENFORCEMENT,

464
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,164
ELIMINATE I.C.E., AND GET RID OF

465
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:52,597
AMERICAN BORDERS.

466
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,766
YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THE

467
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:55,433
BORDERS, RIGHT?

468
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,402
YOU WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.

469
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,338
AND I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS, AND I

470
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:04,910
MEAN IT, DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY

471
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,177
OF CRIME.

472
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:05,911
THEY ARE.

473
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,380
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF

474
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,613
SAFETY.

475
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:16,455
WE ARE ALSO THE PARTY OF JOBS,

476
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,122
JOBS, JOBS.

477
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,490
NOW, WE ARE THRILLED TO BE

478
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,927
JOINED TONIGHT BY A NUMBER OF

479
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,130
TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS.

480
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,001
IOWA CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING.

481
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,334
WHERE'S STEVE?

482
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:36,341
WHERE IS HE?

483
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:41,547
WHERE IS STEVE?

484
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,782
WHERE IS HE?

485
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,584
I WISH YOU COULD GET A LITTLE

486
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,251
BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE.

487
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,286
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?

488
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:51,356
HE MAY BE, WE'RE ALL -- HE MAY

489
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,894
BE THE WORLD'S MOST CONSERVATIVE

490
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,196
HUMAN BEING.

491
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,898
THANK YOU, STEVE.

492
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,167
AND I SUPPORTED HIM LONG BEFORE

493
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,468
I BECAME A POLITICIAN.

494
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,137
DO I HAVE TO USE THAT TERM?

495
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,938
AM I A POLITICIAN?

496
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,675
THANK YOU, STEVE.

497
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,543

THEY ARE, THOSE TWO, ALWAYS WITH

504
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,296
US.

505
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,565
ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE, GOT TO

506
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,400
KNOW HIM DURING THE PRIMARY, GOT

507
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,236
TO KNOW HIM DURING THE ELECTION.

508
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,405
WE TOOK THIS STATE BY STORM.

509
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,074
HE HELPED, BUT I DID EVEN BETTER

510
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,908
THAN HIM.

511
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,176
YOU STILL NEED A PRODUCT, RIGHT?

512
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,945
BUT WE DID GREAT.

513
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,082

BY A LOT.

517
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,892
THAT WASN'T CLOSE.

518
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:06,131
IOWA GOP CHAIR, FRIEND OF MINE,

519
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,733

WHERE IS HE?

527
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,429
I DON'T KNOW TOM OSBOURNE.

528
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,566
ALL I KNOW, IT'S TOM OSBOURNE,

529
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:41,766

ISN'T THAT NICE?

540
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,224
EVERY YEAR YOU WON.

541
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:15,434
YOU BETTER GET GOING NEBRASKA

542
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,636
BUT WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO'S

I DIDN'T HEAR THAT ONE, BUT I

825
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,698

826
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:20,898

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,932
ELIMINATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE FOR

897
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:08,532

THE DEMOCRAT AGENDA IS RADICAL

912
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,231
SOCIALISM AND OPEN BORDERS.

913
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:44,502
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE DEMOCRAT

914
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,069
PARTY IS TO ABOLISH I.C.E.

915

YOU KNOW WHY?

917
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,778
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR

00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,713
I.C.E., THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY,

919
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,948
BUT THEY'RE VERY TOUGH PEOPLE.

920
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:58,916
GUESS WHAT?

921
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:03,020

00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:11,128
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

925
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,562
EVEN YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

926
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:16,099
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT EITHER.

927
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:17,034
THEY ARE FANTASTIC PEOPLE.

928
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,101
THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY.

929
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:21,505
AND TO THEM IT'S A DAY IN THE

930
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:21,738

931
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:22,606
FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEY WANT NO

932
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,208
PART OF IT.

933
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,845
THEY WANT TO TURN AMERICA, THESE

934
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,047
DEMOCRATS, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY

935
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,049
WANT INTO A GIANT SANCTUARY FOR

936
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:38,989
CRIMINAL ALIENS AND THE MS-13

937
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:39,222
KILLERS.

938
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:40,825

00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:49,700

THOUSANDS.

00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,969
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER TOWNS IN LONG

943
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:52,202
ISLAND.

944
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:53,070
I MEAN LITERALLY.

945
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,905
COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY.

946
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,407
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER TOWNS IN LONG

947
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:56,640
ISLAND.

948
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,976
AND WE GO IN AND LIKE LIBERATE

949
00:37:58,976 --> 00:37:59,576
THE TOWNS.

950
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,143
CAN YOU BELIEVE?

951
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:02,179
TOWNS THAT I GREW UP RIGHT NEXT

952
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:02,646
TO.

953
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:03,414
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.

954
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,016
AND THEY GO IN AND THEY GO IN

955
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,417
AND THEY HAVE NO FEAR.

956
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,885
AND THEY TAKE CARE OF THE

957
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:08,152
SITUATION.

958
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,488
THEY GET THEM THE OUT OF

959
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,323
THERE OR THEY PUT THEM IN JAIL.

960
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,691
THEY EITHER SEND THEM BACK WHERE

961
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,661
THEY CAME FROM OR THEY PUT THEM

962
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:16,894
IN JAIL.

963
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,763
AND THEY LIBERATE -- CAN YOU

964
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,364
IMAGINE WE'RE SAYING THIS ABOUT

965
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,501
MRAESS IN OUR KUN -- PLACES IN

966
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:23,801
OUR COUNTRY?

967
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,668
THEY LIBERATE TOWNS AND SMALL

968
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:26,170
CITIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES OF

969
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,238
LONG ISLAND AND OTHERS.

970
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:29,307
THEY LIBERATE THEM LIKE WE'RE

971
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,577
TAKING OVER IN A WAR, AND WE GET

972
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,111
LIBERATED.

973
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,513
HOW SAD, HOW PATHETIC.

974
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,580
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE I.C.E.

975
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:36,713
IT

976
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:37,548
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

977
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,451
SO WE HAVE TO CHERISH OUR LAW

978
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:40,851
ENFORCEMENT.

979
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:47,591
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR LAW

980
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,594
ENFORCEMENT.

981
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,730
THE DEMOCRAT IMMIGRATION

982
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,966
POLICIES RESPECT JUST WRONG,

983
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,134
THEY'RE LETHAL.

984
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,069
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY

985
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:01,472
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR

986
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,840
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR

987
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,742
CRIMINAL AMERICANS THAT SNEAK

988
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:08,645
INTO OUR COUNTRY.

989
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:09,613
AND REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY

990
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,283
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF

991
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,017
I.C.E.

992
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,487
AND BORDER PATROL AND OUR

993
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,922
GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING

994
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:23,260
YOUR GREAT LOCAL LAW

995
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,560
ENFORCEMENT.

996
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,462
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SAFE

997
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:28,933
COMMUNITIES, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

998
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,402
A BORDER, THEN YOU MUST

999
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,169
ORGANIZE, REMEMBER THIS, YOU

1000
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,004
DON'T HAVE A BORDER YOU DON'T

1001
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,440
HAVE A COUNTRY FOLKS, OKAY?

1002
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,274
LET'S FACE IT.

1003
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,175
LET'S FACE IT.

1004
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,411
YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING THINGS

1005
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,079
THAT ARE INCREDIBLE OUTSIDE, BUT

1006
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,447
THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

1007
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,381
YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1008
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:46,183
YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S

1009
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,384
GOING ON WITH NORTH KOREA.

1010
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,019
THEY WERE READY TO GO TO WAR

1011
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:49,987
WITH NORTH KOREA.

1012
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,822
NOW WE'RE GETTING ALONG VERY

1013
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,055
NICELY.

1014
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:59,897
IT'S WORKING OUT VERY WELL.

1015
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,831
LOOK AT IRAN.

1016
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,366
BEFORE I GOT THERE, IRAN WAS

1017
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,967
GOING TO TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE

1018
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,869
EAST IN LIKE 12 MINUTES, RIGHT?

1019
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,039
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE.

1020
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:15,946
THEY GOT RIOTS IN EVERY CITY.

1021
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,148
SO IF YOU WANT TO REALLY JUST

1022
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,950
KEEP UP WHAT WE'RE DOING AND

1023
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,186
KEEP THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE

1024
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,153
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.

1025
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,556
YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING WELL, BUT

1026
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,891
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO

1027
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:28,025
.

1028
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,428
WHEN WE GET RID OF THESE

1029
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,630
HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING TRADE DEALS

1030
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:33,930
WITH CHINA.

1031
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,067
OVER THE LAST FIVE, SIX YEARS

1032
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:41,071
WE'VE BEEN LOSING $300 BILLION

1033
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,074
TO $5 00 BILLION A YEAR -- $500

1034
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,110
BILLION A YEAR, NOBODY EVEN

1035
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,646
KNOWS WHAT THE IT IS IT'S

1036
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,080
SO MUCH.

1037
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,783
IT'S ENDING.

1038
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,083
IT'S ENDING.

1039
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,618
IT'S ENDING.

1040
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,520
AND IT'S NOT JUST CHINA.

1041
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,388
IT'S NOT JUST CHINA.

1042
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,891
AND WHAT WE DO IS WE PROTECT

1043
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,762
WEALTHY COUNTRIES FOR NOTHING.

1044
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:05,596
FOR NOTHING.

1045
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,133
WOULD YOU SAY SAUDI ARABIA IS

1046
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:09,366
WEALTHY?

1047
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:09,566
YEAH.

1048
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:09,766
RIGHT?

1049
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:10,601
AND I SAID TO THE KING, YOU GOT

1050
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,870
TO PAY.

1051
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,371
I'M SORRY, YOU GOT TO PAY.

00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,941
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT YOU, YOU

1053
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,274

1059
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,850
BUT YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN, YOU

1060
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,685
GOT TO PAY.

1061
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,789
JAPAN IS AN IMMENSELY WEALTHY

1062
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,456
COUNTRY.

1063
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:32,789
GREAT PEOPLE.

1064
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,825
PRIME MINISTER ABE IS A FRIEND

1065
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,195
OF MINE, BUT I SAID LOOK, WE'RE

1066
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:38,862
PROTECTING JAPAN.

1067
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:40,965
THEY'RE SENDING US MILLIONS OF

1068
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:41,165
CARS.

1069
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,701
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SEND THEM.

1070
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,334
THEY HAVE BARRIERS.

1071
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,970
WE AN'T SEND THEM CARS, BUT

1072
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,871
THEY SEND MILLIONS OF CARS INTO

1073
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:48,839
HERE.

1074
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,608
THEY PAY ESSENTIALLY NO TAX.

1075
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,711
AND WE SUBSIDIZE THEIR MILITARY.

1076
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,680
WHEN I SAY SUBSIDIZE, I DON'T

1077
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,214
MEAN 2%.

1078
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,417
WE PAY FOR 70% OF THEIR

1079
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,186
MILITARY.

1080
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,988
NOBODY KNOWS THIS.

1081
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,657
AND I SAID TO THE PRIME MINISTER

1082
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,360
WHO'S A GREAT GUY, I SAID, HOW

1083
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,727
COME?

1084
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,597
AND HE HONESTLY SAYS, NOBODY

1085
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:13,930
EVER ASKED.

1086
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,866
WHEN WE STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS, WE

1087
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,867
HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

1088
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,168
AND THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES

1089
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,503
LIKE THAT.

1090
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,472
I'M NOT LOOKING AT JUST THOSE

1091
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:21,638
TWO.

1092
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:23,240
THERE ARE MANY MANY COUNTRIES

1093
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,807
LIKE THAT.

1094
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:24,842
AND WE SHOULD PROTECT PEOPLE

1095
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,343
THAT CAN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES

1096
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,144
AND THEY'RE GETTING SLAUGHTERED.

1097
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:29,613
IT'S OKAY.

1098
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,983
IT'S OKAY.

1099
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:33,417
THAT'S OKAY.

1100
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,086
AND WE'RE NOW BUILDING BY FAR

1101
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,454
THE STRONGEST MILITARY THAT

1102
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,589
WE'VE EVER HAD.

1103
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:45,529
AND THE REASON IS -- AND THE

1104
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,265
REASON IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE

1105
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,200
STRONGEST MILITARY EVER IN THE

1106
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,735
HISTORY OF THIS WORLD, NOBODY'S

1107
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,571
GOING TO MESS WITH YOU.

1108
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,873
THESE BIG GUYS KNOW IT OVER

1109
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,273
HERE.

1110
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,641
THESE PEOPLE KNOW IT.

1111
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,843
I DON'T WANT TO USE MY MILITARY,

1112
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,945
BUT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS

1113
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:02,145
WORLD.

1114
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,949
THIS IS A SICK WORLD IN MANY

1115
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:05,249
WAYS, OKAY?

1116
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,618
IT'S A VERY VERY -- I MEAN I SEE

1117
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:08,652
THINGS AS PRESIDENT THAT YOU

1118
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,154
DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

1119
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,789
THE THINGS THAT I SEE, YOU DON'T

1120
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,924
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

1121
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:18,128
WE HAVE TO BE ON GUARD FOR SOME

1122
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,463
REALLY TREACHEROUS PEOPLE THAT

1123
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,999

WE ARE SO PREPARED.

1127
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:34,311
WE ARE SO PREPARED.

1128
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,214
BECAUSE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT

1129
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:41,085
SECURITY AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT

1130
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:41,418
PROSPERITY.

1131
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:46,390
SINCE THE ELECTION, SEAL TEAM IS

1132
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,590
RIGHT.

1133
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,491
WHO'S SEAL TEAM?

1134
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,692
GOOD LOOKING GUY OVER THERE.

1135
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,526
THAT'S GOOD.

1136
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,994
SEAL TEAM, THEY'RE GREAT.

1137
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,597
BUT SINCE THE ELECTION, WE'VE

1138
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,365
CREATED -- NOBODY BELIEVES THIS

1139
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:56,734
-- IF I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THIS

1140
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,769
WHEN I CAME TO IOWA MANY TIMES,

1141
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:04,475
OR WHEN I CAME TO NEBRASKA MANY

1142
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:11,115
TIMES WITH YOUR GOVERNOR, WITH

1143
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,283
YOUR GOVERNOR, IF I WOULD HAVE

1144
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,918
SAID WE WOULD CREATE 4.2 MILLION

1145
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,887
NEW JOBS, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,

1146
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,655
LOOK AT THIS LIKE THE ACADEMY

1147
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:22,626
AWARDS BACK THERE.

1148
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:22,893
LOOK.

1149
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,328
THE FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID,

1150
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,765
OH, WHAT HE'S SAYING, OH, IT'S

1151
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,500
-- WELL, GUESS WHAT?

1152
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,604
WE CREATED 4.2 MILLION JOBS JUST

1153
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:40,077
SINCE THE ELECTION.

1154
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,879
AND WE LIFTED OVER 4 MILLION

1155
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,882
PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.

1156
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:51,188
HOW GOOD IS THAT?

1157
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,091
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY HALF A

1158
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,059
MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS.

1159
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:56,793
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT

1160
00:44:56,793 --> 00:44:59,730
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER

1161
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:07,204
RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

1162
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:07,571
COUNTRY.

1163
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,540
AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS

1164
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:16,580
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER

1165
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,049
RECORDED.

1166
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:26,090
AND KANYE WEST, WHO GETS IT, AND

1167
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,457
BIG JIM BROWN.

1168
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:29,726
HOW DO YOU THINK HE'D DO IN THE

1169
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,094
NFL TODAY?

1170
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:31,427
THE GREATEST.

1171
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:33,197
BUT THEY'RE COMING OVER TO THE

1172
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,031
WHITE HOUSE VERY SHORTLY.

1173
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,766
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE

1174
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,367
LUNCH AND TALK ABOUT IT.

1175
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,836
BUT THEY GET IT.

1176
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,138
HOW DO YOU WIN WHEN YOU HEAR

1177
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:41,471
THOSE NUMBERS?

1178
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,540
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS FOR 100

1179
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,112
YEARS HAVE BEEN PROMISING

1180
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,279
AFRICAN-AMERICANS,

1181
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,614
HISPANIC-AMERICANS, ASIANS,

1182
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,182
THEY'VE BEEN PROMISING

1183
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:52,482
EVERYTHING.

1184
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:52,849
NOTHING HAPPENS.

1185
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:54,752
HERE WE ARE LESS THAN TWO YEARS,

1186
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,954
THE BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS.

1187
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,755
THE BEST NUMBERS THEY'VE EVER

1188
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:05,629
HAD IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CATEGORY.

1189
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:05,996
EVERY CATEGORY.

1190
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,898
HISPANIC-AMERICAN AND

1191
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,832
ASIAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT

1192
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,567
RATES HAVE ALSO REACHED ALL TIME

1193
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:10,767
LOWS.

1194
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,003
HOW DO YOU BEAT US IN 2020?

1195
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,205
GOVERNOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

1196
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,907
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

1197
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,740
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

1198
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,610
WE'RE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB.

1199
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,045
BUT WE HAVE THE BEST NUMBERS

1200
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:22,378
EVER RECORDED.

1201
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:24,481
THOSE DEBATES I LOOK FORWARD TO.

1202
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,518
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THAT.

1203
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:27,784
REMEMBER?

1204
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,186
WHAT THE DO YOU HAVE TO

1205
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,587
LOSE, REMEMBER THAT?

1206
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:30,787
RIGHT?

1207
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,190
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO IT.

1208
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,625
BUT NOW WE'VE DONE IT.

1209
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,561
SO HOW'S SOMEBODY GOING TO DO

1210
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:37,794
BETTER?

1211
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,263
BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO MUCH

1212
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,198
BETTER THAN EVEN THAT.

1213
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,199
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST

1214
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,704
FELL TO 3.6%.

1215
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:52,643
WHICH IS THE LOWEST IN MORE THAN

1216
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,077
65 YEARS.

1217
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,346
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT

1218
00:46:56,346 --> 00:47:06,857
IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING.

1219
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,293
WE HAVE FINALIZED A NEW FAIR

1220
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,928
TRADE DEAL FOR SOUTH KOREA.

1221
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:13,630
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

1222
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,166
WE JUST DID A DEAL,

1223
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,634
MANUFACTURERS, FARMERS, THE DEAL

1224
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,235
WAS SO BAD.

1225
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:22,039
THAT WAS A HILLARY CLINTON DEAL.

1226
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,307
SHE SAID, NO NO, SHE WAS

1227
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:41,692
SECRETARY OF STATE.

1228
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,961
SHE MADE A STATEMENT TODAY.

1229
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:44,962
SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE DOING A

1230
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,129
TOUR OR SOMETHING.

1231
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,766
AND SHE MADE A STATEMENT, SOME

1232
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,066
RIDICULOUS.

1233
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,336
I SAID THAT'S WHY SHE LOST THE

1234
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:52,603
ELECTION.

1235
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,437
SHE DOESN'T GET IT.

1236
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,104
SHE NEVER GOT IT.

1237
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:58,775
SHE SAID WE WILL CREATE 250,000

1238
00:47:58,775 --> 00:47:59,142
JOBS.

1239
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,576
AND EVERYBODY WAS EXCITED.

1240
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:02,079
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE WAS RIGHT,

1241
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,413
BUT IT WAS CREATED IN SOUTH

1242
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:08,485
KOREA, NOT IN OUR COUNTRIES.

1243
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,654
JUST ANOTHER DEAL, CHECK IT OFF.

1244
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,190
JUST ANOTHER HORRIBLE DEAL.

1245
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,560
WE WILL CREATE 250,000 -- YOU

1246
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,996
KNOW IF SHE SAID FOR SOUTH

1247
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:19,196
KOREA?

1248
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,298
AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

1249
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:21,631
HONEST, RIGHT?

1250
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:23,400
BUT WE'VE TOTALLY RENEGOTIATED

1251
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:23,566
IT.

1252
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:26,470
UNDER THE GUISE OF MASSIVE

1253
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,703
TARIFFS.

1254
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,271
THEY SAID LET'S DO IT, COME ON.

1255
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,841
LET'S DO IT, LET'S MAKE A DECENT

1256
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:31,041
DEAL.

1257
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,710
AND WE'VE OPENED IT UP FOR YOUR

1258
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,379
FARMERS, FOR YOUR MANUFACTURERS.

1259
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,281
WE'VE TAKEN A HORRIBLE DEAL AND

1260
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,282
MADE IT A GOOD DEAL.

1261
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:41,285
MADE IT A GOOD DEAL.

1262
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,853
AND NOW WE'RE OPENING UP, OR

1263
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,121
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING

1264
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,823
WHERE WE DO EVEN BETTER, BUT

1265
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,426
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP JAPAN FOR

1266
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,829
TRADE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION

1267
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,297
WHICH IS BRUTAL.

1268
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:56,533
THEY ARE BRUTAL.

1269
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,603
SOUNDS SO NICE, SO NICE.

1270
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,804
THE EUROPEAN UNION.

1271
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,906
SOUNDS SO NICE, RIGHT?

1272
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:03,774
THEY ARE BRUTAL.

1273
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,208
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD

1274
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,310
THEIR WAY.

1275
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,444
THEY FORMED IN ORDER TO TAKE

1276
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,647
ADVANTAGE OF US ON TRADE.

1277
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,883
NOW, WE PROTECT MOST OF THOSE

1278
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,153
COUNTRY, EUROPEAN UNION, NATO,

1279
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,287
WE PROTECT MOST.

1280
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,123
SO GERMANY IS PAYING 1%.

1281
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,760
WE ARE PAYING 4.3% TO PROTECT

1282
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:23,993
EUROPE.

1283
00:49:23,993 --> 00:49:26,196
EXPLAIN THAT ONE TO ME, PLEASE.

1284
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,564
THE NUMBERS ARE HORRIFIC.

1285
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:31,702
BUT I'VE GOTTEN $44 BILLION LAST

1286
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,171
YEAR MORE PAID INTO NATO BY

1287
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:34,671
OTHER COUNTRIES.

1288
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,607
AND THIS YEAR WILL BE MORE THAN

1289
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:37,807
THAT.

1290
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:40,444
THAT'S WHY I SAY OUR COUNTRY HAS

1291
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,711
SUCH INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL.

1292
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:43,413
THERE'S SO MANY -- I MEAN I

1293
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,182
COULD GO THROUGH DEAL -- I COULD

1294
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,984
GO THROUGH SO MANY THINGS, JUST

1295
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:47,417
THE SAME THING.

1296
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,386
THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD THE

1297
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,187
EMBASSY IN ISRAEL.

1298
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:55,926
AS YOU KNOW, WE GOT APPROVED.

1299
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:56,126
RIGHT?

1300
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,496
ON MY DESK WAS A DOCUMENT TO GET

1301
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,264
READY TO SPEND OVER $1 BILLION

1302
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,098
TO BUILD A BUILDING.

1303
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:04,101
I SAID HOW DO YOU SPEND A

1304
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,636
BILLION DOLLARS TO SPEND A

1305
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:06,903
BUILDING?

1306
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,005
I DIDN'T LOOK, BUT PROBABLY ONE

1307
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,308
STORY, IT'S AN EMBASSY, TWO

1308
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,576
STORIES, A BILLION DOLLARS.

1309
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,344
AND I SAID MAYBE WE CAN GET A

1310
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,812
BUILDING AND RENOVATE IT AND FIX

1311
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,681
IT UP REAL FAST AND WHO KNOWS.

1312
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:22,819
AND OUR GREAT AMBASSADOR TO

1313
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,121
ISRAEL, DAVID FREEDMAN CALLED.

1314
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,289
HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE

1315
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,125
BEST SITE IN JERUSALEM AND

1316
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,593
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING ON

1317
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:29,759
IT.

1318
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,361
AND WE CAN TAKE JUST A BIG

1319
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,896
CORNER OF THAT BUILDING, FIKTS

1320
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,931
IT UP, AND INSTEAD OF -- FIX IT

1321
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,667
UP, AND INSTEAD OF WAITING 15 OR

1322
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,803
20 YEARS, WE CAN HAVE IT IN

1323
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:51,181
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS, SIR.

1324
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,084
I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S THE

1325
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:54,284
BEST?

1326
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,752
THE BUILDING IS GOOD, BUT WE

1327
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:56,452
HAVE TO RENOVATE.

1328
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,822
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A BILLION

1329
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,757
AND PROBABLY NEVER GET IT OPEN.

1330
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,360
IT WOULD END UP COSTING THREE OR

1331
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:03,693
FOUR BILLION.

1332
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,462
PROBABLY ONE-THIRD THE SIZE OF

1333
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,630
THIS ROOM.

1334
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,132
THEY'LL SPEND $2 BILLION.

1335
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,800
I SAID DAVID, HOW MUCH IS IT

1336
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,270
GOING TO COST AND HOW GOOD IS

1337
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,603
THE SITE?

1338
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,337
THE SITE'S GREAT.

1339
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,607
AND THE BUILDING IS SET WAY BACK

1340
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,009
FOR PURPOSES OF SECURITY.

1341
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,179
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE

1342
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,747
SIDEWALK, CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

1343
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,682
HE SAID SIR, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1344
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,983
AND IT'S A BIG SITE.

1345
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,219
I SAID HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO

1346
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:29,419
COST?

1347
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,223
HE SAID, SIR, IT'S GOING TO COST

1348
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:33,723
ABOUT $18,000.

1349
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,459
I TOLD -- $180,000.

1350
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:42,165
I TOLD HIM -- THINK OF IT.

1351
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:42,365
TRUE.

1352
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:42,632
$108,000.

1353
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,634
FIRST TIME -- $180,000.

1354
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,170
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I'VE EVER

1355
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,604
DONE THIS.

1356
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,171
DON'T GET ANGRY AT ME.

1357
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:51,942
I SAID DAVID, IT'S TOO CHEAP, IT

1358
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,642
DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

1359
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,143
I NEVER DID THAT BEFORE.

1360
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,879
I NEVER DID IT BEFORE.

1361
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,281
LIKE I LIKE TO SAY, LIKE AIR

1362
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,182
FORCE ONE, WE GAVE OUT THE

1363
00:51:59,182 --> 00:51:59,449
CONTRACT.

1364
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,351
THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE IT OUT

1365
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,353
FOR $1.6 BILLION MORE THAN I

1366
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:04,588
GAVE IT OUT FOR.

1367
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,256
I SAID TO BOEING, I'M NOT GOING

1368
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,724
TO PAY THAT PRICE.

1369
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,728
AND I SAID I'M NOT PAYING IT.

1370
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:16,333
CANCEL THE CONTRACT.

1371
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,233
I'M NOT PAYING IT.

1372
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:18,868
AND I HELD A LINE.

1373
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:24,474
I SAID YOU GOT TO TAKE OFF $1.8

1374
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:24,707
BILLION.

1375
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:27,077
SUPPOSEDLY WE TOOK OFF $1.6

1376
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:27,310
BILLION.

1377
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,778
WE HAVE A DEAL.

1378
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:29,379
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T.

1379
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,680
I SAID CUT IT IN HALF.

1380
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,782
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

1381
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,084
THE WHOLE DEAL.

1382
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,887
BUT WITH THE EMBASSY, I SAID

1383
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,522
DAVID, DAVID, $180,000 IS TOO

1384
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:39,923
CHEAP.

1385
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,925
WE GOT TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT.

1386
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,159
IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

1387
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,362
BUT SIR, I CAN DO A REALLY GOOD

1388
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,764
-- I KNOW YOU CAN, IT'S NOT

1389
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,766
GOING TO PLAY WELL.

1390
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,903
WE TOOK IT FROM $1 BILLION TO

1391
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:54,170
$180,000.

1392
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,239
I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, DAVID,

1393
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,041
MAKE IT $400,000.

1394
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,510
AND USE JERUSALEM STONE.

1395
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,612
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STONE.

1396
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,615
AND YOU'RE IN JERUSALEM, IT'S

1397
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:06,716
PROBABLY INEXPENSIVE.

1398
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,451
MOST EXPENSIVE STONE WHEN YOU

1399
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:08,784
BRING IT HERE.

1400
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:09,953
BUT YOU'RE IN JERUSALEM.

1401
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,822
THEY SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF IT,

1402
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:13,022
RIGHT?

1403
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,058
I SAID, DAVID, USE BEAUTIFUL

1404
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:16,926
JERUSALEM STONE AND LET'S DO IT.

1405
00:53:16,926 --> 00:53:19,496
WE OPENED IT UP FOUR MONTHS

1406
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,830
LATER FOR $400,000.

1407
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,232
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

1408
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,135
IT'S OPEN.

1409
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:25,402
IT'S OPEN.

1410
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,570
I COULD TELL YOU MANY OF THESE

1411
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:27,804
STORIES.

1412
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,739
I COULD TELL YOU MANY.

1413
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:32,575
I COULD TELL YOU SO MANY OF

1414
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:32,908
THESE STORIES.

1415
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:38,615
THAT STORY AND I GOT 30 MORE WE

1416
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,249
COULD TALK ABOUT.

1417
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,216
THE WAY WE SPENT.

1418
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,185
HE SAYS I WANT TO HEAR MORE.

1419
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:46,089
SHOULD I GIVE YOU ONE MORE OF

1420
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:49,326
THOSE STORIES?

1421
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:49,593
ONE STORY.

1422
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:53,262
SO WE LIKE SOUTH KOREA.

1423
00:53:53,262 --> 00:53:56,433
WE'VE GOT 32,000 SOLDIERS OVER

1424
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:56,633
THERE.

1425
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,401
THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNITED

1426
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,035
STATES.

1427
00:53:59,035 --> 00:53:59,636
THEY DON'T PAY.

1428
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,172
THEY DON'T PAY US.

1429
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,373
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

1430
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,609
THEY ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL.

1431
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,509
AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

1432
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:11,448
GAVE THIS INCREDIBLE -- IT'S ALL

1433
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:18,154
RIGHT, DON'T WORRY, IT'S BEING

1434
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,625
MOSTLY DISMANTLED.

1435
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,458
MOSTLY DISMANTLED.

1436
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:25,028
SO MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE I GET

1437
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,998
THERE AND I NOTICE THERE'S THIS

1438
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,699
INCREDIBLE THAD SYSTEM.

1439
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,501
THAD SYSTEM TO KNOCK DOWN

1440
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:31,734
ROCKETS.

1441
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:33,937
SHOOTS DOWN ROCKETS, MISSIMS,

1442
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,840
MOST INCRED -- MISSILES, MOST

1443
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,974
INCREDIBLE THING YOU'VE EVER

1444
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:38,174
SEEN.

1445
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,243
AND THE COMPANY LIKES TO SAY IF

1446
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:44,114
YOU SEND UP TWO MISSILES, YOU'LL

1447
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:44,380
GET 100%.

1448
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:44,781
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

1449
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,749
I SAID DO IT WITH ONE.

1450
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:49,586
BRAND NEW, THEY PUT IN.

1451
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,155
I SAID JUST OUT OF CURIOUSTY,

1452
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,089
WHO PAYS FOR THIS?

1453
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,592
I SAID TO A CERTAIN GENERAL,

1454
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:55,859
GOOD GUY.

1455
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,894
BUT HE'S NOT INTO BUSINESS.

1456
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,430
HE'S INTO WINNING WARS, BUT NOT

1457
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:00,997
BUSINESS.

1458
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,499
HE'S INTO WINNING, BUT NOT

1459
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:02,766
BUSINESS.

1460
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:03,633
LITTLE BUSINESS TO HIM.

1461
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:07,437
SO I SAID, SO, LET ME ASK YOU

1462
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,238
SOMETHING.

1463
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,840
HOW MUCH IS THAT SYSTEM COST?

1464
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,443
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.

1465
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,812
AS A BUSINESSMAN, YOU BY THE

1466
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,714
WAY, A GOOD BUSINESSMAN, YOU

KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

1468
00:55:18,747 --> 00:55:20,583
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?

1469
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,584
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.

1470
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,353
WHO PAYS FOR IT?

1471
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,487
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.

1472
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,822
NOW, YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, THE

1473
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,391
PURPOSE OF THIS IS ON THE

1474
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:28,624
BORDER.

1475
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:30,192
THIS IS IN THE TIME WHEN WE WERE

1476
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:31,294
HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM, YOU

1477
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,729
KNOW AT THE BEGINNING.

1478
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,064
A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE

1479
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:34,998
GOING TO WAR.

1480
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,566
BUT WE'RE DOING NICELY NOW.

1481
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,735
BUT I SAID, SO LET ME GET THIS.

1482
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,104
WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S VERY

1483
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:41,371
EXPENSIVE.

1484
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,139
AND WE SHOOT DOWN ROCKETS THAT

1485
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,907
ARE SHOT FROM NORTH KOREA TO

1486
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:48,545
SOUTH KOREA TO SHOOT OKAY.

1487
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,246
SO WE'RE PROTECTING SOUTH KOREA,

1488
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,214
RIGHT?

1489
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,214
WHY AREN'T THEY PAYING?

1490
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:53,116
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

1491
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,818
I SAID GENERAL, IMMEDIATELY GO

1492
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,719
AND FIND OUT WHO'S PAYING FOR IT

1493
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:59,622
AND HOW MUCH.

1494
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,291
SO HE GOES, NEXT MORNING HE

1495
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,059
COMES INTO MY OFFICE.

1496
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,729
SIR, WE ARE AN ALLY OF SOUTH

1497
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:08,298
KOREA, AND THEREFORE WE ARE

1498
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,066
PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM, SIR.

1499
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:14,336
I SAID, I THOUGHT SO.

1500
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:17,740
THEN I SAID, ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME

1501
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,008
THE BAD NEWS.

1502
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,944
GIVE ME THE BAD NEWS.

1503
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,746
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST?

1504
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:26,182
SIR, $1 BILLION.

1505
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:30,653
I SAID, WELL, WHOA.

1506
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,822
SO WE'RE PUTTING IN A SYSTEM

1507
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,291
THAT WE PAY FOR AND IT'S GOING

1508
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,160
TO COST A BILLION DOLLARS IN

1509
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,896
ORDER TO PROTECT AN IMMENSELY

1510
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,764
WEALTHY COUNTRY THAT MAKES ALL

1511
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:47,404
OF YOUR TELEVISION SETS, RIGHT?

1512
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,204
SAMSUNG, LG.

1513
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:52,942
I ORDER A LOT OF THEM.

1514
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:53,242
SOUTH KOREA.

1515
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:56,312
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THAT

1516
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,781
OUT, STEVE KING, AS A TRUE

1517
00:56:58,781 --> 00:56:59,349
CONSERVATIVE.

1518
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,817
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

1519
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,786
SO WE DO THIS AND I SAID DO ME A

1520
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:04,154
FIVER.

1521
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,989
GO BACK TO THE -- FAVOR.

1522
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,322
GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY.

1523
00:57:07,322 --> 00:57:08,091
RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL.

1524
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,459
THAT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL.

1525
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,660
BUT SIR, THE OBAMA

1526
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,494
ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY

1527
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,795
AGREED TO IT.

1528
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:15,498
I SAID I DON'T CARE IF THEY

1529
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,231
AGREED TO IT.

1530
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,134
I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF THEY

1531
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,836
AGREED TO IT.

1532
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:26,075
I DON'T CARE.

1533
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,411
SO THAT'S THE SECOND OR THIRD

1534
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:28,745
STORY.

1535
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,312
I COULD GO ON ALL NIGHT, BUT I

1536
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:33,583
WANT TO GET THE OUT OF

1537
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:33,883
HERE, OKAY?

1538
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,052
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS COMING

1539
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:43,159
TO IOWA AND THERE'S MORE PEOPLE

1540
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:47,596
FROM NEBRASKA.

1541
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:50,866
RIGHT, PETE RICKETTS?

1542
00:57:50,866 --> 00:57:54,437
PETE RICKETTS, GOVERNOR

1543
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:54,704
RICKETTS.

1544
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,139
WE LOVE YOU BOTH.

1545
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,774
WE LOVE YOU BOTH.

1546
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,243
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER

1547
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,078
NATIONS, I COULD GIVE YOU 30

1548
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:02,311
STORIES.

1549
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:05,381
I COULD GIVE YOU 100 STORIES

1550
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:05,647
LIKE THAT.

1551
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:07,784
WE'RE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR

1552
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:08,518
NATION.

1553
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,520
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

1554
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,090
AMERICA IS NOT BEING TAKEN

1555
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,193
ADVANTAGE OF ANYMORE.

1556
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:23,232
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED

1557
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:23,432
AGAIN.

1558
00:58:23,432 --> 00:58:25,768
WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE

1559
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:26,803
PASSED THE BIGGEST PACKAGE OF

1560
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:31,874
TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN

1561
00:58:31,874 --> 00:58:32,107
HISTORY.

1562
00:58:32,107 --> 00:58:32,608
BIG NUMBERS.

1563
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:35,411
SO IMPORTANT FOR THE FARMERS AND

1564
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,914
SMALL BUSINESS TO SAVE YOUR

1565
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:41,550
FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES.

1566
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,919
WE VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED THE

1567
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:49,525
ESTATE TAX, ALSO KNOWN AS THE

1568
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:50,960
DEATH TAX.

1569
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,429
SO NOW IF YOU LIKE YOUR CHILDREN

1570
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,000
OR LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, YOU CAN

1571
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,067
LEAVE YOUR BEAUTIFUL FARM TO

1572
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,168
YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY WON'T

1573
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,003
HAVE TO PAY ANY TAXES.

1574
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:03,706
THEY WON'T HAVE TO GO TO YOUR

1575
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,742
LOCAL BANKER, BORROW MONEY, AND

1576
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,277
END UP LOSING THE FARM WHICH WAS

1577
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:08,544
HAPPENING.

1578
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:10,480
NOW YOU WON'T HAVE ANY, YOU GUYS

1579
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,746
KNOW THAT.

1580
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,148
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

1581
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,183
THAT'S A BIG DEAL JEFF AND STEVE

1582
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,084

1585
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,558
LEAVING THEIR FARMS, THE KIDS

1586
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,126
END UP GOING THROUGH AND

1587
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,093
LOSING THEIR FARMS.

1588
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,862
SO NOW YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO TO

1589
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:29,198
THE BANK, BORROW MONEY, PUT A

1590
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:29,498
MORTGAGE ON.

1591
00:59:29,498 --> 00:59:31,000
HERE'S THE THING, IF YOU DON'T

1592
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,002
LIKE YOUR KIDS OR IF YOU DON'T

1593
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,771
LOVE YOUR KIDS, IT DOESN'T HAVE

1594
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,538
ANY IMPACT ON YOU.

1595
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,174
SELL THE FARM, ENJOY YOURSELVES,

1596
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:38,707
AND RELAX.

1597
00:59:38,707 --> 00:59:39,942
DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING.

1598
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,644
DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING IF YOU

1599
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:42,945
DON'T LIKE THEM.

1600
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,847
DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING.

1601
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,249
WE'RE REDUCING THE PRICE OF

1602
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,285
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO HELP

LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT.

1605
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:56,225
WE PASSED RIGHT TO TRY.

1606
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,728
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS.

1607
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,097
WE HAVE RIGHT TO TRY NOW.

1608
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,166
FOR YEARS PEOPLE WANTED TO

1609
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,001
ACCESS SOME OF THESE CURES THAT

1610
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,235
WORK, BUT THEY CAN'T GET

1611
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,171
APPROVED BECAUSE IT'S A LONG

1612
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,806
PROCESS WHICH WE'VE CUT WAY

1613
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:10,173
DOWN.

1614
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,274
RIGHT TO TRY.

1615
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,543
THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL AND

1616
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,745
THEY COULDN'T GET TREATMENT OF

1617
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,480
SOMETHING THAT MAY WORK.

1618
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,317
WE JUST SIGNED RIGHT TO TRY AND

1619
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,686
THESE GUYS HELPED A LOT.

1620
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:23,886
RIGHT?

1621
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:24,787
STEVE, JEFF, EVERYBODY.

1622
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,057
THEY HELPED A LOT.

1623
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,792
DAVID WAS GREAT.

1624
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,192
DAVID YOUNG.

1625
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:33,096
SO NOW YOU GET THE RIGHT TO TRY.

1626
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:33,729
PEOPLE USED TO TRAVEL ALL OVER

1627
01:00:33,729 --> 01:00:35,465
THE WORLD IF THEY HAVE MONEY.

1628
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,300
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE MONEY THEY'D

1629
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:37,533
GO HOME.

1630
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,801
THEY HAD NO HOPE.

1631
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,102
NOW THEY CAN GET TREATMENT.

1632
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:41,738
THEY SIGN A DOCUMENT.

1633
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:42,939
THEY CAN GET TREATMENT.

1634
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,807
THEY TRIED FOR 40 YEARS TO GET

1635
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,308
THAT PASSED.

1636
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,175
WE GOT IT PASSED.

1637
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:52,548
RIGHT TO TRY, I LOVE IT.

1638
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,684
WE ALSO PASSED VETERAN'S CHOICE,

01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,487
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT TO

1640
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:02,191
SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR.

1641
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,493
BIG THING.

1642
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:03,793
44 YEARS.

1643
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,395
44 YEARS THEY'VE TRIED TO GET IT

1644
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:06,628
PASSED.

1645
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,931
PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR

1646
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,802
12 DAYS, 20 DAYS, FOR 28 DAYS.

1647
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,203
PEOPLE AREN'T THAT SICK BY THE

1648
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,306
TIME THEY SEE THE DOCTOR.

1649
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:17,572
SERIOUSLY.

1650
01:01:17,572 --> 01:01:18,073
THEY'RE TERMINALLY ILL.

1651
01:01:18,073 --> 01:01:20,843
THEY COULDN'T SEE A DOCTOR.

1652
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,044
NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LET

1653
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,013
THEM GO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR.

1654
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,748
WE PAY FOR THE BILLS.

1655
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,850
IT'S GREAT FOR THEM.

1656
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:32,622
IT ACTUALLY IS SAVING FOR US.

1657
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:37,693
44 YEARS.

1658
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:38,695
44 YEARS.

1659
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,495
44 YEARS.

1660
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,597
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY IDEA, BUT

1661
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,400
THEN I CAME BACK AND SAID WHAT A

1662
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:44,901
GREAT IDEA.

1663
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,035
THEY SAID WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

1664
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,003
GET IT PASSED FOR 44 YEARS.

1665
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:50,506
I MEAN HOW SIMPLE, RIGHT?

1666
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:50,873
44 YEARS.

1667
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,743

01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,893
ACCOUNTABILITY -- VA

1675
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,326
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW.

1676
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:13,329
YOU COULDN'T FIRE ANYBODY,

1677
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:13,596
LITERALLY.

1678
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,265
THERE WERE SADISTS WORKING FOR

1679
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:16,766
THE VA.

1680
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,733
THERE WERE BAD PEOPLE.

1681
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,101
THERE WERE THIEVES, HORRIBLE

1682
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:19,334
PEOPLE.

1683
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:20,736
YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM.

1684
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:23,139
WE PASSED I THINK IT'S 46, 47

1685
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:23,439
YEARS.

1686
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,142
I HATE TO SAY IT, UNION

1687
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,344
PROBLEMS, ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS,

1688
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,678
CIVIL SERVICE PROBLEMS.

1689
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:32,615
PRETTY STRONG LOBBY, RIGHT?

1690
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:38,087
WE GOT IT PASSED.

1691
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,555
44, 46 YEARS.

1692
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,457
AND NOW WHEN WE CATCH PEOPLE

1693
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,392
THAT AREN'T TAKING CARE OF OUR

1694
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,296
VETERANS WE LOOK AT THEM, WE SAY

1695
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,664
JIM, YOU'RE FIRED.

1696
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,099
GET OUT OF HERE.

1697
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:58,074
IT'S TRUE.

1698
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:08,117
IT'S TRUE.

1699
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,519
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T SPIN THE

1700
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:10,752
CAMERAS.

1701
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:12,989
FELLAS, I SAID AT THE BEGINNING,

1702
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:13,522
NOBODY DOES IT.

1703
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:16,058
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW

1704
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,493
HOW BIG THESE CROWDS ARE.

1705
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:18,294
NO, I'M TELLING YOU.

1706
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,196
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.

1707
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:23,765
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.

1708
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:23,966
LOOK.

1709
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:24,800
THEY'RE NOT SPINNING.

1710
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,769
DO YOU SEE ONE CAMERA TURNING.

1711
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,738
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW ALL

1712
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:29,071
THESE PEOPLE.

1713
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:36,245
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.

1714
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,514
I DON'T SEE -- LOOK, I DON'T SEE

1715
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:39,581
ONE CAMERA TURNING.

1716
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:46,923
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.

1717
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,025
OUR GREAT FIRST LADY.

1718
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,093
I COME HOME, DID THEY SHOW THE

1719
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:51,427
CROWD?

1720
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:55,198
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MASSIVE.

1721
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:55,431
RIGHT?

1722
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,634
IT SOUNDED -- LOOKS LIKE AN

1723
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,204
IOWA, IOWA STATE OR NEBRASKA

1724
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:01,537
FOOTBALL GAME.

1725
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,072
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

1726
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:10,346
WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

1727
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,047
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

1728
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:14,083
MY WIFE WOULD SAY THEY DIDN'T

1729
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,686
SHOW THE CROWD BUT IT SOUNDED

1730
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:16,852
BIG.

1731
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:18,253
YOU CAN'T CHEAT ON THE SOUND.

1732
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:19,922
IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.

1733
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,958
THEY CHEAT BECAUSE THEY NEVER

1734
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,192
SHOW THE CROWD.

1735
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:32,301
WE SECURED $716 BILLION TO FULLY

1736
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,802
REBUILD OUR GREAT AMERICAN

1737
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:34,069
MILITARY.

1738
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:36,672
AND AT MY DIRECTION THE PENTAGON

1739
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:38,174
IS NOW PREPARING TO CREATE THE

1740
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,543
SIXTH BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN

1741
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,381
ARMED FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE.

1742
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:45,781
VERY IMPORTANT.

1743
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:46,148
VERY IMPORTANT.

1744
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:49,819
WE GOT TO GET THAT DONE,

1745
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:50,119
CONGRESSMEN.

1746
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,756
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT.

1747
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:54,290
SO IMPORTANT.

1748
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,993
FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS YOUR

1749
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:59,462
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA.

1750
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:00,029
THEY APOLOGIZED.

1751
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,098
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS

1752
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:07,436
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA.

1753
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,272
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR

1754
01:05:10,272 --> 01:05:10,973
VALUES.

1755
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:18,213
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR IOWA AND

1756
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:19,315
NEBRASKA.

1757
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,219
AND WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP

1758
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:50,012
FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM.

1759
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:54,817
AND BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF THE

1760
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:55,117
NFL.

1761
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:55,618
NO, IT'S OKAY.

1762
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,753
BUT YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS THE NFL

1763
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,922
HAD A BIG PROBLEM WITH CANADA

1764
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,857
AND THE SUPER BOWL AND RIGHTS,

1765
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,058
IT'S A COMPLICATED THING.

1766
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:03,492
DOESN'T MATTER.

1767
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,227
I HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WE

1768
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:06,629
WERE DEALING WITH A MUCH MUCH

1769
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:06,996
BIGGER ISSUE.

1770
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,465
AND THE NFL IS A GREAT AMERICAN

1771
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:09,698
COMPANY.

1772
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:12,101
AND I TOLD MY PEOPLE, GET THE

1773
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,468
NFL PROBLEM SOLVED.

1774
01:06:13,468 --> 01:06:15,237
IT TOOK THEM ABOUT TWO MINUTES.

1775
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:20,443
AND I GOT A CALL FROM THE

1776
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:20,776
COMMISSIONER.

1777
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:21,777
I THOUGHT HE WAS CALLING ABOUT

1778
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,079
THE FLAG.

1779
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:28,384
I THOUGHT HE WAS CALLING TO SAY

1780
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,586
WE AGREE TO STAND WITH OUR HAND

1781
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,221
ON OUR HEART AND OUR HELMET ON

1782
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,722
THE GROUND.

1783
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:33,989
HE DIDN'T.

1784
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:34,890
BUT A GOOD GUY.

1785
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,425
HE CALLED ME TO THANK ME.

1786
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,327
YOU KNOW WHY I DID THAT?

1787
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,162
I DID THAT -- NOBODY TOLD ME TO

1788
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,231
DO IT -- I DID THAT BECAUSE I

1789
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,766
KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM, AND

1790
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,066
IT'S A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY.

1791
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:46,769
WHETHER WE LIKE IT, DON'T LIKE

1792
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:47,870
IT, IT'S A GREAT AMERICAN

1793
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,137
COMPANY.

1794
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,939
AND SO I GOT IT DONE.

1795
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,741
TOOK US LIKE TWO MINUTES.

1796
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,409
AND NOW THE PLAYERS WILL BE PAID

1797
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,845
MORE MONEY AND THEY'LL STILL

1798
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,180
HATE ME.

1799
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,315
ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE?

1800
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,583
THEY'LL STILL HATE TRUMP AS THEY

1801
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,483
GET MORE MONEY.

1802
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:04,153
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

1803
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,622
THAT'S WHY GUYS LIKE JIM BROWN

1804
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,357
AND KANYE AND SO MANY OTHERS

1805
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,391
LIKE ME.

1806
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:12,294
BUT TO CONTINUE OUR INCREDIBLE

IT WILL ALL BE TAKEN AWAY IF

THEY GET CONTROL.

1866
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:35,504
INCLUDING THEY'LL START

1867
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,505

1868
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,474

1874
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,086
FRUSTRATIONS OF THE PAST OR

1875
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,721
WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD INTO

1876
01:09:53,721 --> 01:10:05,267
A FUTURE OF AMERICAN GREATNESS.

1877
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:10,139
NEVER FORGET THAT IN 2016 WE HAD

1878
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,674
THE GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE

1879
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,374
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

1880
01:10:13,374 --> 01:10:15,177
AND THEY WON'T CHALLENGE THAT.

1881
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,712
THEY EVEN ADMIT THAT.

1882
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,981
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

1883
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:19,414
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY.

1884
01:10:19,414 --> 01:10:21,383
BUT THAT WAS THE GREATEST

1885
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:23,185
MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

1886
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:23,418
COUNTRY.

1887
01:10:23,418 --> 01:10:28,557
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA OR THE

1888
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,025
FAKE NEWS OR THE PUNDITS TO

THESE STATES WERE SETTLED BY

1906
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:23,812
TOUGH PIONEER MEN AND STRONG

1907
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:24,479
PIONEER WOMEN.

1908
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:25,748
THE WOMEN ACTUALLY WERE STRONGER

1909
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,049
THAN THE MEN, BUT I DON'T WANT

1910
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,283

1911
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:29,785
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT.

1912
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,653
THE WOMEN ARE STRONGER THAN THE

1913
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:31,819

1914
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:35,423

1918
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,365

01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:43,698
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1920
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:45,668

1921
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,835

A LIFE AND A HOME RIGHT HERE.

1923
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,171
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY.

1924
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:52,775
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF

1925
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:53,542
LUXURY.

1926
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,578
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN

1927
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:57,079
COMMON.

1928
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,447
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES.

1929
01:11:58,447 --> 01:11:59,748
THEY LOVED THEIR COUNTRY.

1930
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:12,594
AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD.

1931
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,296
THESE COURAGEOUS PATRIOTS DID

1932
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,198
NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND

1933
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,667
TEARS SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT

1934
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:23,338
