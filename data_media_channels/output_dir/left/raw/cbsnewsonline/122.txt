189
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,661
BEING SOME SORT OF SPY FOR 

190
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:28,894
RUSSIA. 

191
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,896
I THINK THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL. 

192
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,331
YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE A STEP 

193
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,933
BACK, SLOW DOWN AND QUIT GOING 

194
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,602
AFTER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

195
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:36,736
 

196
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,069
TAKES PLACE. 

197
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,237
>>  NO RESPONSE TO THE 

198
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:38,537
INDICTMENT? 

199
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:42,108
>>  I SAID WE ARE LOOKING AT 

200
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:42,274
IT. 

201
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,375
THIS IS A LONG PROCESS. 

202
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,076
WE ARE GOING THROUGH IT. 

203
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,777
HOWEVER, I DO HAVE A RESPONSE 

204
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,414
TO THE FACT THAT BECAUSE 

205
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,715
SOMEONE HAD THE SAME HAIR COLOR 

206
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,517
THEY WERE ACCUSED OF BEING A 

207
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,719
RUSSIA SPY BY PEOPLE IN THIS 

208
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:53,919
ROOM. 

209
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,856
>>  THE PRESIDENT TODAY AND 

210
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,225
SECRETARY OF STATE BOTH SPOKE 

211
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,827
ABOUT PROGRESS BEING MADE IN 

212
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,862
TALKS, TRADE TALKS WITH MEXICO 

213
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,197
AND I'M WONDERING IF TALKS WITH 

214
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,667
MEXICO AND CANADA AND ALSO THE 

215
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,501
TALKS WITH CANADA ARE 

216
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,137
EFFECTIVELY OFF THE TABLE FOR 

217
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:11,337
NOW? 

218
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,238
IS THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDING 

219
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,140
TO GO WITH MEXICO WHERE THEY 

220
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,509
SEE IF -- THERE IS PROGRESS AND 

221
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,310
FORGET ABOUT THE. 

222
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,779
>>  WE ARE CONTINUING BOTH OF 

223
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,346
THOSE TRACKS. 

224
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,315
WE SEE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE 

225
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,616
CONVERSATIONS WITH MEXICO AND 

226
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,452
IF WE COULD MAKE A DEAL WITH 

227
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,420
THEM WE ARE CERTAINLY VERY 

228
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,891
HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT WE ARE 

229
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,925
CONTINUING BOTH CONVERSATIONS, 

230
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,459
BOTH TRACKS. 

231
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,527
>>  RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES NAMED 

232
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,096
AMERICANS THEY WANT TO QUESTION 

233
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:41,000
WHO THEY CLAIM WERE INVOLVED IN 

234
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,169
CRIMES IN THEIR TERMS INCLUDING 

235
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,571
FORMER AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA. 

236
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,741
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT THAT 

237
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:48,941
IDEA? 

238
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,842
>>  THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET 

239
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,412
WITH HIS TEAM AND WE WILL LET 

240
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:57,450
YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE AN 

241
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:57,783
ANNOUNCEMENT. 

242
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,752
>>  DID PRESIDENT PUTIN RAISE 

243
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,485
THAT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

244
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:03,355
>>  THERE WAS CONVERSATION BUT 

245
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,359
NOT A COMMITMENT MADE AND THE 

246
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,860
PRESIDENT WILL WORK WITH HIS 

247
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,093
TEAM. 

248
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,197
>> THE PRESIDENT EARLIER TODAY 

249
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,098
SAID THERE COULD BE 

250
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,399
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE EU IF 

251
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,601
THERE IS NOT A DEAL STRUCK ON 

252
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,268
AUTO IMPORTS. 

253
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,572
IN THE PAST HE HAS TALKED ABOUT 

254
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,476
POSSIBLY PUTTING A TARIFF OF 

255
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:23,676
20%. 

256
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,677
IS THAT WHAT HE MEANT? 

257
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,380
>>  THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE 

258
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,382
TABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 

259
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:29,715
CONSIDERING. 

260
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,783
WE ARE IN THE INVESTIGATION 

261
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,817
PROCESS RIGHT NOW. 

262
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,386
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 

263
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,655
>>  YOU BROUGHT UP THE FED. 

264
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,190
THE BEIGE BOOK JUST CAME OUT 

265
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,292
WHICH IS FROM ACROSS THE 

266
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,493
COUNTRY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THE 

267
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:41,760
ECONOMY. 

268
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,799
HERE ARE SOME OF THE HEADLINES. 

269
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:51,470
MANUFACTURES ARE DEALING HIGHER 

270
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,070
PRICES, THEY ARE INCREASING 

271
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,873
AGRICULTURE AND -- IT'S NOT 

272
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,275
NECESSARILY A ROSY PICTURE WITH 

273
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,276
THE TARIFF SITUATION. 

274
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,111
YOUR RESPONSE TO THOSE 

275
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,179
HEADLINES WOULD BE WHAT? 

276
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,381
>>  THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON 

277
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:02,782
LONG TERM. 

278
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,183
WE HAVE ONE OF THE STRONGEST 

279
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,787
ECONOMIES THAT WE HAVE HAD IN 

280
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,054
DECADES. 

281
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,388
CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO 

282
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,690
HELP PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS 

283
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,291
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ON 

284
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,659
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FRONTS 

285
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,895
AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS. 

286
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,329
AGAIN THIS IS SHORT TERM. 

287
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,931
THE PRESIDENT HOPES TO OPEN UP 

288
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,000
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MARKETS 

289
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,469
AND TO CREATE A MORE PLAYING 

290
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,506
TRADE FIELD ACROSS THE GLOBE. 

291
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,274
>>  TWO QUESTIONS. 

292
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,709
FIRST, PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN 

293
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,511
TALKING ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE 

294
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,480
UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE 

295
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,482
COMMITTEE, HE SAID THAT -- BOTH 

296
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,884
-- I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN BOTH 

297
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:39,116
PARTY. 

298
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:42,989
AFTER A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED 

299
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,623
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA 

300
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,523
AFTER PROTESTING NEONAZIS HE 

301
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,392
SAID I THINK THERE IS BLAME ON 

302
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:46,925
BOTH SIDES. 

303
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,995
SOME SEE IT AS THE PRESIDENT 

304
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,463
MAKING FALSE COMPARISONS. 

305
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,032
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? 

306
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,703
>>  I WOULDN'T COMPARE THE TWO 

307
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,003
SITUATIONS. 

308
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,305
THE PRESIDENT, I THINK, SAID 

309
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,706
EXACTLY WHAT HE THOUGHT 

310
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,042
YESTERDAY IN HIS REMARKS AND I 

311
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,244
WOULD REFER YOU BACK TO THOSE. 

312
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,112
>>  GO HEAD. 

313
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,014
>>  ALSO, DOES THE PRESIDENT -- 

314
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,448
SEE THE INTERFERENCE IN THE 

315
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,318
ELECTION AND POSSIBLY IN THE 

316
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,619
MIDTERMS AS AN ATTACK ON 

317
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,520
DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN, UNITED 

318
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,354
STATES -- THE SECRETARY FOR 

319
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:22,061
HOMELAND SECURITY SAID IT WAS 

320
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,562
AN ATTACK ON AMERICAN DEMO 

321
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,965
CRACA AND -- WE SEE IT AS AN 

322
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,468
ISSUE OF IT OR JUST HIS 

323
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,202
OPPONENTS BEING ATTACK ? 

324
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,138
>>  THE PRESIDENT THINKS WE 

325
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,740
HAVE TO FOCUS ON SECURING OUR 

326
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,541
ELECTION AND OUR ELECTION 

327
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,343
SYSTEMS WHICH IS WHY HE HAS 

328
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,844
SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH HIS 

329
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,746
ADMINISTRATION MAKING SURE THAT 

330
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,047
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. 

331
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,582
LET'S NOT FORGET THIS DIDN'T 

332
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,084
HAPPEN UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

333
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:45,351
WATCH. 

334
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,019
THIS HAPPENED UNDER THE OBAMA 

335
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:47,386
ADMINISTRATION. 

336
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,453
WE ARE TAKING STEPS. 

337
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,022
WE ARE MAKING BOLDER REFORMS TO 

338
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,724
TRY TO FIX THIS AND MAKE SURE 

339
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,059
IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN BECAUSE 

340
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,662
WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND WE 

341
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,663
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR ELECTION 

342
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,432
SYSTEM IS IMPORTANT AND A 

343
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,901
CORNER STONE OF THE GOVERNMENT. 

344
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,668
>>  THE PRESIDENT. 

345
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,937
>>  TWO -- THE PRESIDENT SPENT 

346
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,639
TOUR HOURS AND TEN MINUTES WITH 

347
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:06,872
PUTIN. 

348
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,742
WAS THERE A DEAL MADE ON SYRIA, 

349
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,009
ANYTHING? 

350
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:10,976
CAN YOU GIVE US ANY SENSE OF 

351
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:13,311
WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT MEETING? 

352
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:16,148
>>  AS THE PRESIDENT SAID A 

353
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:22,655
NUMBER OF ISSUES WERE RAISED 

354
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,057
INCLUDING SYRIA, IRAN'S NUCLEAR 

355
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,693
AMBITION, ISRAELI SECURITY, 

356
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,394
NORTH KOREA, UKRAINE. 

357
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,463
REDUCING RUSSIAN AND UNITED 

358
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,531
STATES ARSENALS AND YOUR 

359
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,666
FAVORITE TOPIC, RUSSIA'S 

360
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,767
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTIONS. 

361
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,002
ALL OF THESE ISSUES WERE TALKED 

362
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:37,235
ABOUT. 

363
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:41,240
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE 

364
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,041
DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA AND OUR 

365
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,342
ADMINISTRATION AND THEIRS AND 

366
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,776
WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING 

367
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,078
THROUGH THOSE THINGS. 

368
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,013
THOSE WERE ALL OF THE TOPICS 

369
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:48,947
AND CERTAINLY PROBABLY OTHERS 

370
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:49,481
THAT WERE COVERED. 

371
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:54,053
>>  ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES FROM 

372
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,321
CRIMEA TO THE ELECTION MEDDLIN 

373
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,289
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE 

374
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,059
SPENT MORE TIME CRITICIZING 

375
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,794
OBAMA FOR LETTING IT HAPPEN 

376
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,495
UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION THAN 

377
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:02,728
PUTIN. 

378
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,296
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHY 

379
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,498
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T BEEN MORE 

380
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,765
CRITICAL OF PUTIN FOR SOME OF 

381
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,067
THESE EVENTS THAT THE WORLD 

382
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,502
STAGE HAS REALLY GONE AFTER HIM 

383
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:09,735
ABOUT? 

384
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,604
>>  I THINK THE PRESIDENT AS HE 

385
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,472
HAS SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE HAS 

386
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,473
BEEN TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN 

387
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:14,706
ANYONE. 

388
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:16,442
I THINK YOU CAN SEE NAH IN ALL 

389
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,146
OF THE ACTIONS THAT HE HAS 

390
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,082
TAKEN WHETHER ITS WHAT A PLANT 

391
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,850
THAT WAS CLOSED DUE TO TARIFFS 

392
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,852
PUT IN PLACE BY THE PRESIDENT, 

393
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,754
THE TREASUREY DEPARTMENT HAS 

394
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,192
ISSUED NEW SANCTIONS ON 

395
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,593
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IN 

396
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:34,993
RUSSIA. 

397
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,496
THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT IN 

398
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:37,796
SANCTIONS. 

399
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:38,497
WE HAVE EXPELLED 60 OPERATIVES 

400
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:44,103
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND 

401
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,604
CLOSED TWO CONSULATES. 

402
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,074
THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNED RUSSIA 

403
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,877
FOUR TIMES, AUTHORIZED MILITARY 

404
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,813
STRIKES AGAINST THE ASSAD 

405
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,483
GOVERNMENT IN SYRIA AND HAS 

406
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,249
CALLED OUT THEIR ACTIONS. 

407
00:11:58,249 --> 00:11:59,285
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY 

408
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,320
TOUGH ON RUSSIA AND TO SAY 

409
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,088
ANYTHING DIFFERENT IS JUST NOT 

410
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:03,288
TRUE. 

411
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,090
>>  OTHER WORLD LEADERS BY NAME 

412
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,525
FAR MORE OFTEN THAN PUTIN. 

413
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,593
WHY WON'T HE CRITICIZE PUTIN BY 

414
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:07,793
NAME? 

415
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,695
>>  I THINK HE HAS. 

416
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,997
I THINK HE HAS CALLED THEM OUT 

417
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,033
FOR INTERFERING IN THE 

418
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:14,300
ELECTION. 

419
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,235
HE HAS BEEN TOUGH ON RUSSIA AND 

420
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,136
HE HAS TAKEN ACTION AGAINST 

421
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,137
RUSSIA ON A NUMBER OF FRONT 

422
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,774
THAT I JUST LISTED OFF. 

423
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,608
>>  ALL RIGHT. 

424
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:24,977
ONE AT A TIME. 

425
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,680
>>  WHY WASN'T HE CRITICAL OF 

426
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,047
PUTIN ACTIONS? 

427
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,683
>>  THEY HAD A NUMBER OF 

428
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,083
CONVERSATIONS. 

429
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,218
THE PRESIDENT DISCUSSED SOME OF 

430
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,354
THESE THINGS DIRECTLY FACE TO 

431
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,089
FACE WITH PUTIN. 

432
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,090
HE ADDRESSED THEM AGAIN 

433
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,423
YESTERDAY. 

434
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,491
HE ALSO SEES THIS AS AN 

435
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,392
OPPORTUNITY AS HE SAID MANY 

436
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:46,332
TIMES TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH 

437
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:46,732
RUSSIA. 

438
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,466
90% OF THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR 

439
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,034
WEAPONS ARE UNDER THE DIRECTION 

440
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,236
OF THE UNITED STATES AND 

441
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:50,469
RUSSIA. 

442
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,104
HE THINKS IT'S A GOOD THING TO 

443
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,405
GET ALONG WITH THE OTHER PERSON 

444
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:59,311
THAT CONTROLS THAT MUCH OF THE 

445
00:12:59,311 --> 00:12:59,778
NUCLEAR ARSENAL. 

446
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,213
HE WANTS TO CREATE A MORE 

447
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,915
STABLE AND PEACEFUL WORLD IF WE 

448
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,918
CAN'T DO THAT IF WE CAN'T GET 

449
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,452
ALONG WITH RUSSIA. 

450
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:08,821
WE HAVE CALLED HIM OUT. 

451
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,654
WE HAVE BEEN TOUGH. 

452
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,257
WE HAVE APPROACHED THIS IN A 

453
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,126
DIFFERENT FASHION THAT HAS BEEN 

454
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:14,526
PREVIOUSLY DONE. 

455
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,263
IN THE PAST WHAT'S BEEN DONE 

456
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:17,630
HASN'T WORKED. 

457
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,065
TO ABOUT LIKE HE HASN'T BEEN 

458
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,568
TOUGH, HASN'T CALLED THEM OUT 

459
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,470
ISN'T TRUE AND IT CHANGES 

460
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,970
EVERYTHING THAT THIS 

461
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,739
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE IN 

462
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,007
REGARDS TO THAT COUNTRY. 

463
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:29,975
I WILL KEEP GOING. 

464
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,010
>>  YOU DESCRIBED THE NEGATIVE 

465
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,946
IMPACTS OF THE TRADE CONFLICT 

466
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:34,847
WITH CHINA, THE SHORT TERM. 

467
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,849
THAT'S ONLY TRUE IF WE ARE ABLE 

468
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,717
TO STRIKE A BETTER DEAL. 

469
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,754
FROM THE OUTSIDE SINCE THE 

470
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:47,560
TARIFFS WENT ON IT SEEMS LIKE 

471
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,297
THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BROKEN 

472
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:51,497
DOWN. 

473
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,765
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 

474
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,401
TELL US ABOUT THE STATUS AND 

475
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,502
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO RESTART 

476
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:56,968
THE TALKS IN. 

477
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:59,138
>>  I WON'T NEGOTIATE WITH YOU. 

478
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,473
I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE 

479
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,241
SECRETARY AND AMBASSADOR. 

480
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,143
WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE 

481
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:04,710
CONVERSATIONS WITH CHINA. 

482
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,178
WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK FOR 

483
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,582
WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER 

484
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:11,250
TRADE DEAL. 

485
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,453
>>  SHE ASKED ABOUT THE IDEA 

486
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,556
THAT PUTIN OFFERED OF 

487
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,356
ESSENTIALLY LETTING THE SPECIAL 

488
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,660
COUNSEL TO GO TO RUSSIA TO SEE 

489
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,627
THE INTERROGATIONS OF THE 

490
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,196
RUSSIAN MILITARY AFTER IFS THE 

491
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,397
UNITED STATES WOULD HAVE 

492
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,899
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATORS COME HERE 

493
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,200
TO WATCH AMERICAN CITIZENS FACE 

494
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,402
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CRIMES THEY 

495
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,903
ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED IN RUSSIA. 

496
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,472
THE PRESIDENT CALLED IT AN 

497
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:33,872
INTERESTING IDEA. 

498
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,174
HE SAID IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE 

499
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:35,774
OFFER. 

500
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,542
WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT? 

501
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,744
>>  HE SAID IT WAS AN 

502
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,578
INTERESTING IDEA. 

503
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,347
HE WANTS TO WORK WITH HIS TEAM 

504
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,783
AND DETERMINE IF THERE IS ANY 

505
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,819
VALIDITY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL 

506
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,119
TO THE PROCESS. 

507
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:52,457
WE HAVE COMMITTED TO NOTHING. 

508
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,793
>>  SOME DEMOCRATS ON CAPITOL 

509
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,096
HILL SAY THEY WANT TO DRAG THE 

510
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,733
TRANSLATOR IN THE ROOM WITH THE 

511
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,667
PRESIDENT AND PUTIN BEFORE 

512
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,936
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES TO 

513
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,872
FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID 

514
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:07,439
IN THE PRIVATE MEETING. 

515
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,874
IS THAT SOMETHING THE WHITE 

516
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,474
HOUSE WOULD SUPPORT? 

517
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,209
>>  THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD 

518
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,578
GO THROUGH THE STATE 

519
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:12,878
DEPARTMENT. 

520
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,281
>>  THE LIST OF SUBJECTS YOU 

521
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,983
WENT THROUGH AS FAR AS THE 

522
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,686
MEETING, WERE SANCTIONS, DOESED 

523
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:20,919
AT ALL? 

524
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,188
DID THE PRESIDENT BRING IT UP 

525
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,823
OR DID PUTIN BRING IT UP TO 

526
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,323
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

527
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,058
>>  I'M NOT AWARE. 

528
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:30,129
I WOULD HAVE TO ASK. 

529
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,831
>>  JUST ONE -- YESTERDAY THE 

530
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,033
PRESIDENT'S REVISION -- IT WAS 

531
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,335
JUST KIND OF SEEN THAT HE WAS 

532
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,736
LEAVING HIMSELF ROOM WHEN HE 

533
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,005
SAID THERE COULD HAVE BEEN 

534
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,140
OTHERS TOO WHO MEDDLED. 

535
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,076
WAS HE REFERRING TO ANY 

536
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,011
SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE ON THAT 

537
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,779
OR WAS THAT HIS INSTINCT? 

538
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,314
>>  THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES A 

539
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:56,789
NUMBER OF BRIEFINGS AND HAS 

540
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,222
TALKED ABOUT THIS 

541
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,457
SUBJECTTENSIVELY. WE SUBJECT. 

542
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:02,160
>>  I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT 

543
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,828
SOMETHING YOU SAID. 

544
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:08,767
DESPITE THE VIDEO THAT SHOWS 

545
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:13,038
THE PRESIDENT LOOKING AT 

546
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,307
ANSWERING NO ABOUT RUSSIA STILL 

547
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,043
TARGETING THE PRESIDENT AND THE 

548
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,011
PRESIDENT HAVING NEVER SAID NO 

549
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,278
TO. 

550
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,412
>>  HE SAID NO ONE TIME. 

551
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,515
>>  THIS IS THE FIRST THING 

552
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,919
THAT HE SAID THANK YOU VERY 

553
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,520
MUCH AND NO I'M NOT ANSWERING 

554
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,155
ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND EVEN 

555
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,557
FURTHER I THINK THAT -- EVEN 

556
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,724
SHE DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT THE 

557
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:33,825
ANSWER GAS BECAUSE SHE ASKED 

558
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:39,264
FOR CLARITY AND HE DIDN'T 

559
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,331
ANSWER THE FOLLOW UP. 

560
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:40,766
AGAIN. 

561
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,867
I -- SHE WASN'T SURE. 

562
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,268
I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT. 

563
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,369
HE WASN'T ANSWERING THAT 

564
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:44,837
QUESTION. 

565
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,403
HE WAS SAYING NO. 

566
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:50,042
HE IS NOT TAKING QUESTIONS AND 

567
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,043
I HAVE STATED WHAT OUR 

568
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:51,410
POSITIONS. 

569
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,311
>>  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME 

570
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,745
THAT THE PRESIDENT OR THE WHITE 

571
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,247
HOUSE HAS COME OUT AND REVERSED 

572
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,016
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID. 

573
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,853
>>  ACTUALLY I'M SAYING WHAT 

574
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,353
THE PRESIDENT SAID. 

575
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:01,886
I'M NOT REVERSING IT. 

576
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:05,057
I WAS IN THE ROOM AND I DIDN'T 

577
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,825
TAKE IT THE WAY YOU DID. 

578
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,894
>>  WHY SHOULD HE HAVE ANY 

579
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,696
CREDIBLE IN WHAT HE SAYS IF 24 

580
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,498
HOURS LATER OR THREE HOURS 

581
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,898
LATER THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS JUST 

582
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:14,165
KIDDING? 

583
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:19,371
>>  FIRST OF ALL THAT'S NOT 

584
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:19,704
WHAT I SAID. 

585
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,574
I WAS INTERPRETING WHAT HIS 

586
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,775
INGE TENSION WAS. 

587
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,078
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU JUST 

588
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:26,545
EXPLAINED. 

589
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,846
WE NEVER SAID JUST KIDDING. 

590
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,883
I THINK -- I THINK THAT YOU CAN 

591
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,084
TAKE THE FACT THAT THE 

592
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:32,984
PRESIDENT HAS CREDITABILITY 

593
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:35,654
BECAUSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD 

594
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,688
MISSPOKEN AND HE WANTED TO 

595
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,556
CLARIFY YESTERDAY WHICH HE DID. 

596
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,660
WHEN HE SEES THAT HE IS 

597
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,197
MISSPOKE HE SAYS THAT. 

598
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,164
I WILL KEEP MOVING. 

599
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:47,499
JORDON GO HEAD. 

600
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,601
I WILL GO HEAD. 

601
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,402
YOU HAVE ASKED TWO. 

602
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,173
>>  ONCE AGAINST I'M MOVING 

603
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:54,506
ONTO JORDON. 

604
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:54,773
GO HEAD. 

605
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,107
>>  SORRY. 

606
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:56,875
GO HEAD IF YOU WANT. 

607
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,978
ACTUALLY I WILL TAKE A QUESTION 

608
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:00,311
FROM JORDON. 

609
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,279
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US 

610
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,981
REMEMBER -- I DON'T REMEMBER A 

611
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:07,386
TIME WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS 

612
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,087
PUBLICLY CALLED  OUT PUTIN. 

613
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,789
BY SAYING THAT RUSSIA 

614
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,990
INTERFERED THE RUSSIA. 

615
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,458
THAT'S A PRETTY BOLD CALL OUT 

616
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,727
ú 

617
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:24,736
. 

618
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,704
>>  OR IN THE FUTURE. 

619
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,271
WOULD THE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

620
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,639
SUPPORT PROPOSAL LIKE THAT? 

621
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,176
>>  I WON'T GET INTO 

622
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,377
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS UNTIL 

623
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,379
WE SEE A FINAL PIECE OF 

624
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,914
LEGISLATION AND ALSO A 

625
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,782
DETERMINATION IF THERE IS 

626
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,215
ELECTION MEDDLING. 

627
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:38,784
AGAIN OUR GOAL IS TO STOP THAT 

628
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,285
FROM HAPPENING WHICH IS WHY WE 

629
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,086
HAVE SPENT SUCH A SIGNIFICANT 

630
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,688
AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE FIRST 

631
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,290
YEAR AND A HALF OF THE 

632
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,029
ADMINISTRATION FOCUSING ON 

633
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,730
PROTECTING THE ELECTION. 

634
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:51,930
JOHN. 

635
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,264
JOHN GO HEAD. 

636
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:52,497
SORRY. 

637
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:52,697
GUYS. 

638
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,533
IF WE COULD GO ON PEOPLE THAT I 

639
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,001
HAVE CALLED ON. 

640
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,904
>>  IS VOTER SUPPRESSION PART 

641
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,905
OF THAT ELECTION PROCESS THAT 

642
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,907
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO LOOK 

643
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,107
FOR? 

644
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,775
YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANSWER 

645
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:03,975
THAT? 

646
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,344
>>  IF I CALL ON YOU I WILL BE 

647
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:06,945
HAPPY TO ANSWER. 

648
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,279
JOB GO HEAD. 

649
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,615
>>  YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANSWER 

650
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,115
ME. 

651
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:10,548
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. 

652
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,416
FINE. 

653
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,317
>>  THANK YOU. 

654
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,620
I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 

655
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,621
IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THE 

656
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,623
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS THAT HE 

657
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,426
MADE AT THAT JOINT PRESS 

658
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,027
CONFERENCE. 

659
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,061
IT WAS IMMEDIATE. 

660
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,062
EVERY CABLE CHANNEL, FOX, NBC, 

661
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:24,963
CNN REACTED IMMEDIATELY TO THE 

662
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,364
SUGGESTION THAT THE PRESIDENT 

663
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,700
MADE THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE 

664
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,237
THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE 

665
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:32,971
UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL 

666
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,238
ELECTION. 

667
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,842
I GOT MY INBOX HIT WITH E-MAILS 

668
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,276
FROM REPUBLICANS FROM CONGRESS 

669
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:41,012

PRESIDENT 20 CORRECT THE 

672
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,183
RECORD. 

673
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,719
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THE 

674
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,555
PRESIDENT TO CLARIFY THE 

675
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,224
COMMENTS THAT HE MADE? 

676
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,725
>>  LOOK. 

677
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,660
THE PRESIDENT PUT OUT AN 

678
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,862
INITIAL TWEET AFTER BOARDING 

679
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,365
AIR FORCE ONE THAT CLARIFIED 

680
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,300
HIS COMMENTS ON THE 

681
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,833
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 

682
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,068
HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS 

683
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,469
CLEAR AND AT THE FIRST CHANCE 

684
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,873
HE HAD IN A PUBLIC SETTING THE 

685
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,874
FOLLOWING DAY HE CLARIFIED HIS 

686
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,275
COMMENTS AND I DON'T THINK THAT 

687
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,177
IT WAS THAT LONG FOR THAT TO BE 

688
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,378
THE VERY FIRST PUBLIC 

689
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,847
APPEARANCE THAT HE HAD AFTER 

690
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,049
ARRIVING BACK TO THE UNITED 

691
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,449
STATES. 

692
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,650
>>  IT'S A PRETTY LONG TIME. 

693
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,352
IT WAS OUT THERE FOR QUITE A 

694
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:20,552
TIME. 

695
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,455
>>  IT WASN'T 24 HOURS BEFORE 

696
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,456
HE RESPONDED AT ALL. 

697
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:24,689
AGAIN. 

698
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,558
HE PUT OUT THE TWEET FROM AIR 

699
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:26,858

TO WOULDN'T OR THE WOULDN'T TO 

703
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,400
WOULD AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF 

704
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,002
PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE 

705
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,570
WAS TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

706
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,771
HE TWEETS ALL THE TIME FROM AIR 

707
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,272
FORCE ONE. 

708
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:49,481

NIGHT. 

710
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,383
>>  WHAT TOOK SO LONG? 

711
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,487
>>  ONCE HE REVIEWED THE 

712
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,589
TRANSCRIPT HE WANTED TO 

713
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,893
PUBLICLY ADDRESS THE CLARITY 

714
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,027
AND WHICH HE DID. 

715
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:03,528

IMPEACH DEPUTY ATTORNEY, IS 

718
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:10,335
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE WHITE 

719
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,306
HOUSE WOULD SUPPORT FOR LACK OF 

720
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:14,639
COOPERATION? 

721
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,974
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 

722
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,841
CLEAR HE WANTS ALL DOCUMENTS 

723
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,809
TURNED OVER BUT WE ARE 

724
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,012
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 

726
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:22,780
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER. 

727
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,849
JIM, GO HEAD.

>>  SORRY. 

730
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:29,121
>>  WOULD THE WHITE HOUSE 

731
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:29,921
DENOUNCE THAT EFFORT? 

732
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,323
DO THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE 

733
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:31,890
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL? 

734
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,994
>>  THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO 

735
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,962
SEE THE DOCUMENTS TURNED OVER. 

736
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:38,830
WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE 

737
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,232
IN SOMEONE WE WILL LET YOU 

738
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:40,766

739
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:50,409

WOULD TELL PUTIN TO STAY OUT OF 

743
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,314
ELECTIONS AND HE SAID YES. 

744
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,816
DID HE TELL PUTIN TO STAY OUT 

745
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,216
OF ELECTIONS IN. 

746
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,719
>>  CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT AS 

747
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,421
HE AND PUTIN SAID DISCUSSED 

748
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:02,888
ELECTION MEDDLING. 

749
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,925
I THINK WE HAVE MADE THAT VERY 

750
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,259
CLEAR. 

751
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,326
>>  DID THE PRESIDENT OF THE 

752
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,327
UNITED STATES TELL THE 

753
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,563
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA TO STAY OUT 

754
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,298
OF UNITED STATES ELECTIONS? 

755
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,866
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 

756
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,868
CLEAR TO PUTIN THAT HE SHOULD 

757
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,237
STAY OUT OF UNITED STATES 

758
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:19,537
ELECTIONS. 

759
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:20,672
I WILL KEEP MOVING. 

760
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,606
APRIL, GO HEAD. 

761
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,340
>>  THANK YOU. 

762
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,109
SORRY JIM I WILL TAKE A COUPLE 

763
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:24,709
LAST QUESTIONS. 

764
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:28,146
>>  WAS THERE A RECORDING MADE 

765
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:28,814
OF THEIR MEETING? 

766
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,615
>>  I'M NOT AWARE OF ONE. 

767
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,218
>>  THE PRESIDENT IS CONCERNED 

768
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:33,918
ABOUT THE ELECTION PROCESS. 

769
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:38,757
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT HE IS 

770
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:39,658
DOING. 

771
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,226
YOU DIDN'T MENTION VOTER 

772
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,127
SUPPRESSION. 

773
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,728
ITS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR DECADES. 

774
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,597
PARTICULARLY IN THESE LAST FEW 

775
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:45,864
 

776
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,666
TABLE WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 

777
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,368
VOTER FRAUD, PEOPLE WERE 

778
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,835
TALKING ABOUT VOTER 

779
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:51,168
SUPPRESSION. 

780
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:52,070
IS THAT ON THE TABLE? 

781
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,738
>>  WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING 

782
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:56,241
WITH IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT 

783
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,142
THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTIONS 

784
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:05,150
AND WE  WILL LOOK AT THAT. 

785
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,952
I ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BECAUSE 

786
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,019
OF RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 

787
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:08,219
PAST. 

788
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,622
>>  I WANT TO CHANGE TOPIC A 

789
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,091
MINUTE IF I MAY AND GO SOUTH. 

790
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:13,358
>>  SURE. 

791
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,059
THAT WOULD BE FINE. 

792
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,026
>>  THANK YOU. 

793
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,662
>>  THE INCOMING PRESIDENT OF 

794
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,599
MEXICO HAS MADE TWO VERY BOLD 

795
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:20,932
SUGGESTIONS. 

796
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,069
NUMBER ONE, HE IS LOOKING AT 

797
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,438
GIVEN AMNESTY TO THE DRUG 

798
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,539
CARTELS OPERATING WITH IN 

799
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:27,772
THERE. 

800
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:30,775
TODAY THEY COME OUT AND SAY 

801
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,345
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY LOOKING AT 

802
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,079
LEGALIZING ALL DRUGS IN MEXICO. 

803
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,449
IF THEY DO THAT IT'LL HAVE A 

804
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,984
HUGE IMPACT ON THE INCOMING 

805
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,053
AMOUNT OF DRUGS IN TO THE 

806
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:42,687
UNITED STATES. 

807
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,455
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 

808
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,958
POSITION ON THAT AND ARE THEY 

809
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,995
GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP 

810
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:50,695
THAT FROM HAPPENING? 

811
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,299
>>  CERTAINLY WE ARE GOING TO 

812
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,470
CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH OUR 

813
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,637
MEXICAN PARTNERS. 

814
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,440
I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC POLICY. 

815
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,975
WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT LEGALIZING 

816
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:04,976
ALL DRUGS ANYWHERE AND WOULDN'T 

817
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,344
WANT DO TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD 

818
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,713
LET MORE DRUGS COME INTO THIS 

819
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:08,980
COUNTRY. 

820
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,280
THANK YOU. 

821
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,649
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 

822
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,151
>>  WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION 

823
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,288
DOING ABOUT [INAUDIBLE] 

824
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,388
AND USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA? 

825
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:19,157
>>  ALL RIGHT. 

826
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,259
WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO THE 

827
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:25,196
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY 

828
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,163
GIVE A PRESS  BRIEFING. 

829
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:29,734
SHE FACED A LOT OF TOUGH 

830
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,903
QUESTIONS OVER THE PRESIDENT'S 

831
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,371
SUMMIT WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 

832
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:33,604
PUTIN. 

833
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:36,374
SHE WAS ASKED TO CLARIFY A 

834
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,576
NUMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

835
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:37,876
POSITIONS. 

836
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,977
SHE REPEATED WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

837
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,145
HAS SAID THAT NO OTHER 

838
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,580
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN AS TOUGH ON 

839
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,414
RUSSIA AS PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

840
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:44,882
SHE WENT THROUGH A LIST OF 

841
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:47,385
SANCTIONS AND ACTIONS THAT THE 

842
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:51,056
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN AGAINST 

843
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:51,289
RUSSIA. 

844
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,693
SHE MENTIONED THE SYRIA 

845
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,060
STRIKES, EXPELLING THE 60 

846
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,694
RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS. 

847
00:24:56,694 --> 00:25:01,633
WHEN SHE WAS ASKED IF THE 

848
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,534
PRESIDENT HAS EVER VERBALLY 

849
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:04,803
USED STRONG WORDS WITH 

850
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,970
PRESIDENT PUTIN ABOUT ELECTION 

851
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,775
MEDDLING SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO 

852
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,108
ANSWER THAT. 

853
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,677
CBS NEWS MAJOR GARRET WAS AT 

854
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,880
THE PRESS BRIEFING AND IS HERE 

855
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,080
NOW. 

856
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,984
YOU HAD THE FIRST QUESTION OF 

857
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:19,550
THE BRIEFING. 

858
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,185
YOU ASKED WHETHER THE 

859
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,786
PRESIDENT'S NEGATIV COMMENT AS 

860
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,488
TO IF HE BELIEVED RUSSIAN 

861
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,290
MEDDLING WAS ONGOING, WHETHER 

862
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,091
THAT REPRESENTED WHAT THE 

863
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,158
PRESIDENT BELIEVED, WHAT DID 

864
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,159
YOU MAKE OF HER RESPONSE? 

865
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,961
>>  THAT SHE HAD TO CORRECT IT. 

866
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,130
THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION 

867
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,266
MADE BY THE PRESIDENT THAT IT'S 

868
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:41,506
NOT HAPPENING WHICH IS A DIRECT 

869
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,875
CONTRADICTION OF WHAT DAN 

870
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,778
COATES HAS SAID. 

871
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,179
IT GOT IMMEDIATE REACTION FROM 

872
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,113
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND OTHERS. 

873
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:52,484
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

874
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,350
WAS THE WHITE HOUSE POSITION. 

875
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,186
WELL, SHE HAD TO GO IN AND TALK 

876
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,188
TO THE PRESIDENT AND SAID NO 

877
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,024
THAT CAN'T BE OUR PRESIDENT. 

878
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:02,694
YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S NOT 

879
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:02,994
HAPPENING. 

880
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,895
IT IS HAPPENING IF. 

881
00:26:04,895 --> 00:26:06,731
THANK YOU CONTINUE TO SAY IT 

882
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,934
ISN'T YOU ARE GOING AGAINST THE 

883
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:12,103
PEOPLE AT THE OF YOUR 

884
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:12,804
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT 

885
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,106
YESTERDAY YOU HAD TO CORRECT TO 

886
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,207
SAY YOU BELIEVE. 

887
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,210
SECOND DAY WHERE THERE WAS THIS 

888
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,312
GAP CREATED BY THE PRESIDENT IN 

889
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,915
RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE OF 

890
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,718
EITHER PAST RUSSIAN MEDDLING, 

891
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,187
2016 OR ONGOING EFFORTS TO 

892
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,489
DESTABILIZE OR INFLUENCE OR GET 

893
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,091
INTO ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS 

894
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:33,391
THIS YEAR. 

895
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,227
THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT THE 

896
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:41,533
PRESIDENT HAS COMPLICATED ON 

897
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:46,504
HIS OWN WITH HIS OWN WORDS. 

898
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,506
. I KNEW IT WOULD BE A STORY SO 

899
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,476
I GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY IT 

900
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,977
OFFER A NEW PERSPECTIVE WHICH 

901
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:56,915
SHE HAD AND THEN WENT THROUGH A 

902
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,717
ROSTER OF THINGS THAT THE 

903
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,418
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE TO 

904
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:04,122
IDENTITY THIS ISSUE, SET ASIDE 

905
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,123
RESOURCES AND PROVIDE 

906
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,524
INFORMATION AND HELP TO STATES 

907
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,625
IF THEY BELIEVE THERE IS 

908
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,560
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE 

909
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,062
CHECKED FROM A CYBER SECURITY 

910
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,464
PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO 

911
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:12,897
ELECTION SYSTEMS. 

912
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,265
>>  LET'S GO THROUGH A FEW OF 

913
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,468
THOSE STEPS SHE SAID THE 

914
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,001
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING. 

915
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:17,869
SHE SAID THE DEPARTMENT OF 

916
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,507
HOMELAND SECURITY IS WORKING 

917
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,142
WITH STATES TO BOLSTER THEIR 

918
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,577
ELECTION SECURITY. 

919
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:31,416
SHE SAID 18 STATES HAVE 

920
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:31,783
REQUESTED HELP. 

921
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:32,183
>>  CORRECT. 

922
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,453
ALL OF THAT MAY BE TRUE AND 

923
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,223
THAT'S AT THE MARGINS OF THIS 

924
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,524
TACTIC, MEANING THE RUSSIAN 

925
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,327
TACTIC AND THE UNITED STATES 

926
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,294
RESPONSE. 

927
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,561
REMEMBER, STATES RUN ELECTIONS 

928
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:47,699
AND THERE HAS TO BE A GROUP 

929
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:48,166
GOVERNMENT. 

930
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,567
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T 

931
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,871
TELL STATES WHAT TO DO WITH 

932
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,671
CERTAIN THINGS. 

933
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,206
THEY HAVE TO UNDER FEDERAL LAW 

934
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,975
PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE BALLOT 

935
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:01,045
AND A PROCESS THAT IS FAIR AND 

936
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:01,278
EQUAL. 

937
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,450
IN LARGE MEASURE THE ACTIONS OF 

938
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,784
STATES ARE THEIR BUSINESS. 

939
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,252
WHATEVER STEPS THIS 

940
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,219
ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN 

941
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,822
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF 

942
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,956
HOMELAND SECURITY OR OTHERS, 

943
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,525
WHAT MATTERS IN OUR CURRENT 

944
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,060
CONTEXT IS THE DIRECTOR OF 

945
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,727
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, DAN 

946
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:20,265
COATES, FORMER MEMBER OF THE 

947
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,866
UNITED STATES SENATE, AN 

948
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,800
PERSONSED POLITICAL LEADER 

949
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,172
EXPERIENCED IN THE INTELLIGENCE 

950
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,041
LIGHTS BLINKING ON RUSSIAN 

951
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,876
EFFORTS TO DESTABILIZE, MEDDLE 

952
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,345
WITH THE 2018 MIDTERMS. 

953
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,346
THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM NOW. 

954
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,314
THOSE COMMENTS CAME LONG AFTER 

955
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,051
SOME OF THESE INITIAL STEPS 

956
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,352
WERE TAKEN BY THIS 

957
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:41,719
ADMINISTRATION. 

958
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,520
WHATEVER STEPS THE 

959
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,056
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO POINT 

960
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,824
TOO. 

961
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,991
IN THE OPINION OF DIRECTOR OF 

962
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,560
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE THEY 

963
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:48,960
AREN'T ENOUGH. 

964
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,297
>>  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SARAH 

965
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,065
SANDERS COMMENTS ABOUT THE 

966
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,665
PRIVATE CONVERSATION. 

967
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,333
THEIR ONE ON ONE MEETING. 

968
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,469
SHE WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE 

969
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,037
TOPICS. 

970
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,738
SYRIA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA AND 

971
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,940
SHE MENTIONED AND -- RUSSIA 

972
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,806
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. 

973
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:03,942
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD 

974
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:08,646
IT WAS SOMETHING THEY DISCUSSED 

975
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,313
IN THAT LITTLE MEETING. 

976
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:12,450
NOWHERE DID SHE TALK MORE ABOUT 

977
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:12,750
THAT. 

978
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,751
>>  SHE DIDN'T. 

979
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,353
AFTER A SERIES OF QUESTIONS, 

980
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,155
VERY POINTED QUESTIONS SHE 

981
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,958
FINALLY SAID THE PRESIDENT MADE 

982
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:25,597
IT CLEAR TO PUTIN DON'T MEDDLE 

983
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,830
IN THE 2018 ELECTION. 

984
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,800
THAT WASN'T THE FIRST THING SHE 

985
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,100
MENTIONED. 

986
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,602
THIS ADMINISTRTION FOR 

987
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,603
WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T FOCUS 

988
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,073
ON THAT ISSUE OR IT'S FOCUS ON 

989
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:35,806
THAT ISSUE. 

990
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:37,075
WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE 

991
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:37,408
INTERACTIONS. 

992
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,978
THE ONES THAT JUSTER HAPPENED 

993
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,380
OR THE ONES BEFORE. 

994
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,782
SO, IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THIS 

995
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,984
ADMINISTRATION BY ITSELF OWN 

996
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:50,488
WORDS AND LACK OF FOCUS SORT OF 

997
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,422
LEAVES DANGLING OUT THERE. 

998
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,559
THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS AND THE 

999
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,960
REMARKS THAT NEEDED ANOTHER 

1000
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,429
POINT OF CLARITY AGAIN TODAY 

1001
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,231
LEAVE DANGLING HOW MUCH FOCUS 

1002
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,034
THIS ADMINISTRATION PUTS ON IT 

1003
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:06,136
AND HOW SERIOUSLY IT TAKES IT. 

1004
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,172
ON CAPITOL HILL THE VOICE THAT 

1005
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,474
IS CARRYING THE DAY ON THIS 

1006
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,677
QUESTION IS NOT THE PRESIDENT 

1007
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,012
OF THE UNITED STATES. 

1008
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:15,946
IT'S DAN COAT ES. 

1009
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:16,247
>>  SURE. 

1010
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,683
WHEN SHE WAS PRESSED ON WHY THE 

1011
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,585
PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN MORE 

1012
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,554
PUBLICLY CRITICAL OF PUTIN SHE 

1013
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,590
SAID WE ARE TRYING A NEW 

1014
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,293
APPROACH SINCE WHAT'S BEEN 

1015
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,329
TRIED BEFORE HASN'T WORKED. 

1016
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,632
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

1017
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,233
>>  WELL. 

1018
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,036
TO TAKE ONE ASPECT OF THE 

1019
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,203
ENTIRE APPROACH AND GIVE THIS 

1020
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:41,105
ADMINISTRATION IT'S DUE, IT HAS 

1021
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,207
TAKEN STEPS THAT THE OBAMA 

1022
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:44,409
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T TAKE, 

1023
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,276
THAT RUSSIA DISAGREES WITH. 

1024
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,979
FIRST OF ALL CONTINUED AND HAS 

1025
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:48,913
CONTINUED ALL THE SANCTIONS PUT 

1026
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,681
IN PLACE BY THE OBAMA 

1027
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:56,187
ADMINISTRATION AT THE END OF 

1028
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,355
ITS RUN TO PENALIZE RUSSIA. 

1029
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,190
THOSE SANCTIONS REMAIN. 

1030
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,191
WHEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 

1031
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,493
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE NERVE 

1032
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,362
AGENT POISONING OF A BRITISH 

1033
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,030
CITIZEN THE UNITED STATES UNDER 

1034
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,798
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

1035
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,098
EXPELLED MORE THAN 60 RUSSIANS 

1036
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:12,403
IN THE UNITED STATES ACTING AS 

1037
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,305
DIPLOMATS, SHUT DOWN TWO 

1038
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,808
CONSULATES AND IT AUTHORIZED 

1039
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,111
THE SHIPMENT OF LETHEL WEAPONS 

1040
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,648
TO UKRAINE AS A COUNTER TO 

1041
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,451
RUSSIA AND HAS APPROVED THE 

1042
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,719
EXPORTATION TO EUROPE OF 

1043
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,086
NATURAL GAS. 

1044
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,821
ALSO SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA 

1045
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,056
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT DO. 

1046
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:32,890
ON SOME OF THESE POLICY 

1047
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,392
MATTERS, IT IS REAL AND FAIR TO 

1048
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,495
SAY THAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 

1049
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,429
THAT THE PREVIOUS 

1050
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,331
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T TAKE THAT 

1051
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,299
ARE IF NOT AGGRESSIVE TO 

1052
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,500
RUSSIA, CERTAINLY ACT AS A 

1053
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,302
UNITED STATES COUNTER WEIGHT TO 

1054
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,572
SOME OF WHAT IT'S DONE 

1055
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,539
RECENTLY. 

1056
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,873
THAT'S ALL FAIR AND ACCURATE. 

1057
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:52,210
WHAT IS AND HAS BEEN ABSENT IS 

1058
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,977
THIS PRESIDENT SAYING ANYTHING 

1059
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,514
IN PUBLIC OR IN ANY 

1060
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,815
RELATIONSHIP WHEN ASKED ABOUT 

1061
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,719
PUTIN THAT IS ANYTHING THAT 

1062
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,287
COULD BE REGARDED AS CRITICAL. 

1063
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,923
HE SAYS ABOUT HOW STRONG AND 

1064
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,024
POWERFUL HIS DENIALS ARE. 

1065
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:08,326
HOW IMPRESSED HE IS WITH THINGS 

1066
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,361
LIKE THE WORLD CUP AND OTHER 

1067
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,496
ASPECTS OF HIS REPRESENTATION 

1068
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:16,067
OF THE INTERESTS OF THE RUSSIAN 

1069
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:16,801
PEOPLE. 

1070
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,769
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH HIS REMARKS 

1071
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,869
ABOUT PUTIN, FIND ANYTHING 

1072
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,738
THAT'S NEARLY AS CRITICAL AS 

1073
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,740
WHAT MANY REPUBLICANS ARE 

1074
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,409
WILLING TO SAY ABOUT PUTIN. 

1075
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,309
THAT IS THE BIG DISCONNECT. 

1076
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:28,446
>>  CAN YOU SHED A LITTLE LIGHT 

1077
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,080
ON THE SUGGESTION THAT WAS 

1078
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,349
FLOATED THAT RUSSIAN 

1079
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,085
INVESTIGATORS COME TO THE 

1080
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,152
UNITED STATES AND INTERROGATE 

1081
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:37,321
IN EXCHANGE FOR AMERICAN 

1082
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:38,255
INVESTIGATORS GOING TO RUSSIA? 

1083
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:39,657
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS IDEA 

1084
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,325
THAT, I BELIEVE THAT THE 

1085
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:44,062
PRESIDENT CALLED AN INTERESTING 

1086
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:44,996
IDEA? 

1087
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,265
>>  HE DID SAY THAT. 

1088
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,568
CAN TELL YOU AFTER THAT 

1089
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,337
PRESIDENT CONFERENCE I WAS 

1090
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,239
GETTING TEXTS WITH SOURCES WHO 

1091
00:32:55,239 --> 00:33:00,344
WERE -- THEY WERE GOING THROUGH 

1092
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,447
AND VAGUELY IF NOT HORRIFIED BY 

1093
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,849
THAT BUT THEY WERE ALARMED BY 

1094
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:05,415
THAT REACTION. 

1095
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:07,151
FIRST OF ALL, AS THE 

1096
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:07,784
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SOURCES 

1097
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:10,521
I TALKED TO SAY WE DON'T WANT 

1098
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:19,564
TO SHARE ANY OF OUR CYBER 

1099
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,364
TOOLS, METHODS, WITH THE 

1100
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:20,998
RUSSIANS. 

1101
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:23,968
WE DON'T WANT TO SHARE WITH 

1102
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,002
THEM. 

1103
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:29,140
WE ARE TRYING TO STOP THEM. 

1104
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,943
POINT 2 WE AREN'T INTERESTED IN 

1105
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,945
HAVING RUSSIA JUSTICE 

1106
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,446
DETERMINING WHO SHOULD BE 

1107
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,047
INTERROGATED BY THEIR 

1108
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:36,547
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. 

1109
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,049
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE 

1110
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,750
GOING TO DO, THAT WE SHOULD DO 

1111
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,653
OR EVEN SUGGEST WE ARE OPEN TO 

1112
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,053
THINKING ABOUT. 

1113
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,157
THEIR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IS 

1114
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:46,957
DIFFERENT FROM OURS. 

1115
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:49,527
WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IS IN SO 

1116
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,428
GETTING THE 12 RUSSIANS 

1117
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:55,932
INDICTED BY SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

1118
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:58,802
THAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS. 

1119
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,271
NOT HAVING RUSSIANS INTERROGATE 

1120
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,141
AMERICANS WHO THEY THINK DID 

1121
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:03,807
SOMETHING WRONG IN RUSSIA. 

1122
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:05,576
WHAT SHE SAID TO OFFER THE BID 

1123
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,378
OF CLARITY IS NOTHING HAS BEEN 

1124
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,646
AGREED TOO. 

1125
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,081
IT WAS JUST AN IDEA. 

1126
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:17,621
THE RUSSIANS THREW IT OUT 

1127
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:18,255
THERE. 

1128
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,257
THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED 

1129
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,659
SOMETHING A LOT MORE HARD LIKE 

1130
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:28,166
NOT JUST NO BUT HECK NO. 

1131
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,703
>>  ALL RIGHT. 

1132
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,871
>>> AND JEFF WILL INTERVIEW THE 

1133
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,072
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1134
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,540
YOU CAN SEE THAT HERE. 

1135
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,811
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 

1136
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:41,210
MORE NEWS AHEAD. 

1137
00:34:41,210 --> 00:00:00,000
