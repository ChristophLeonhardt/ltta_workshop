I think this whole brogrammer culture goes back to the classroom it does not start at the office I think if we really take ourselves away from just criticizing the workplace we need to criticize the classroom because I can say personally growing up as a young girl even though I was highly ambitious and have a very entrepreneurial spirit it was never encouraged for me to take the classes or to use the tools that were available to perhaps go and become an entrepreneur the coding classes lack thereof at so many schools they were extremely masculine to the point of you know women being very dismayed at from wanting to join that class how can we expect a group of qualified young women to be able to take jobs in in the tech field when so many of us were never given that option with our education and so I would love to see more opportunity in schools at a younger age so that we can really change this culture and it's on us to start young and yeah I do think that there is absolutely an imbalance in in women to men in in this field but we see it in so many other fields as well I would love to see it start much younger than just when you graduate you
