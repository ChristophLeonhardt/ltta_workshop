SAYING NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE WANT TO FOCUS ON TRUMP AT ALL TIMES. Bret: STANDBY. MARK MEADOWS WALKING OUT, JOINING US. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. GIVE US THE INSIDE SCOOP. OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A LONG MEETING WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY THE AGENDA ON IMMIGRATION BUT WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO FROM HERE. IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING IT DONE. HE REALLY WANTS US TO MAKE SURE WE PUT UP 218 VOTES ON THE HOUSE FLOOR THIS WEEK. HE SAID HE IS BEHIND US 1000%. OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO DEAL WITH THIS SEPARATION ISSUE WITH CHILDREN AT THE BORDER. BOTH BILLS DO THAT. THE COMPROMISE BILL OR THE LEADERSHIP BILL IS CERTAINLY THE ONE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST, THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF GETTING TWO TO 18. Bret: THE PRESIDENT WALKED BY. DEMOCRATS CHANTING ABOUT GETTING FAMILIES TOGETHER. DID THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT HE KNOWS THAT HE CAN DO A CHANGE HIMSELF? HOW DID HE PLAY IT WITH THE LEGISLATION? HE DIDN'T DO THAT. HE HAD SECRETARY NIELSEN THERE AND OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS THERE THE ROOM AND TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOT TO FIND A REAL SOLUTION TO THIS. THIS IS MORE A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH A LONG TIME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRODUCTION OF CHILDREN, THAT'S WHY THIS DEGREE CAME DOWN ORIGINALLY. THEY BELIEVE IT'S BEST WE GET A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. I THINK THERE ARE SOME NARROW BILLS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE THAT WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I AM HEARING CHUCK SCHUMER IS NOT SUPPORTIVE OF ANY LEGISLATIVE EFFORT. Bret: WE REPORT ABOUT AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TODAY TO REPORTERS. THERE IS NOT A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THAT DEMOCRATS WILL SIGN ONTO. YOUR REACTION. MY REACTION IS READ THE BILLS. WE HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL, SENATOR TED CRUZ HAS INTRODUCED A BILL. IS HE SAYING THAT THERE IS NO LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT US TO SOLVE IT. I'VE BEEN GETTING CALLS ALL DAY LONG. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WANT US TO COME TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. A NUMBER OF US ARE GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. Bret: I WANT TO LISTEN IN AND SEE IF THE PRESIDENT SAYS ANYTHING AS HE IS WITH THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER, McCARTHY. Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT . President Trump: THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR MANY YEARS, DECADES. WE HAD A GREAT MEETING. Bret: REITERATING WHAT HE SAID GOING IN, THAT THE LAWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR DECADES. I HAD A GREAT. DID HE TALK A LOT ABOUT IMMIGRATION OR WAS IT A MIXED? IT WAS A MIX. HE STARTED WITH IMMIGRATION. HE CAME BACK TO IMMIGRATION AT THE MIDDLE AND AN KNACKERED WE TALKED ABOUT REGULATION, WE TALKED ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS TO BRING DOWN PREMIUMS FOR HEALTH CARE THAT HE IS SIGNING WITH THE SECRETARY OF LABOR. Bret: IS THEIR URGENCY HERE OR IS THIS AN ISSUE BOTH SIDES ARE PLAYING POLITICS WITH? OUR SIDE IS NOT PLAYING POLITICS WITH IT. I HAD MY STAFF WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND, BUT A LEGISLATIVE FIX. 77 PAGES THAT WE WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK TO GET INTRODUCED TODAY. WE DID THAT AT NOON. IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE JOB DONE RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S BEEN A POLITICAL FOOTBALL BACK AND FORTH AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT DONE RIGHT. HOPEFULLY WE WELL AND I BELIEVE WE WELL THIS WEEK. Bret: WERE REPUBLICAN SAYING WE NEED TO DO A NARROW BILL OR THE PRESIDENT HAS TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC? THE FOCUS WAS ON THE COMPREHENSIVE BILLS. THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT A NARROW BILL. THE SEPARATION ISSUE DID COME UP A COUPLE TIMES, AND THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY COMPASSIONATE ABOUT IT, TALKED ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER BRINGING THAT UP, IVANKA. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT, IT'S NOT LOST ON HIM THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE'VE GOT THIS FOR WEEK.
