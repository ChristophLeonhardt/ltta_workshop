people don't like facts because a lot of the time we get into what the kind of the term going around now is like identity politics where you'd rather be right than accurate and you really have to check yourself and so that's why I follow far right-wing knows and I follow far left wing knows and I follow bipartisan know that and I try to get this story completely before I before I make an informed decision I get informed and that's that's the problem with today is people just want to be right people just want to identify with the side and it's a dangerous it's a dangerous time it's a beautiful time we live in because there's so much information for you to go get but if you're not if you're not careful on on having like a checks and balances within yourself you'll you'll end up sanitizing yourself and to believe it's something that might not coincide with reality okay so that's really interesting so I of course I got asked to follow up on that so which shows do you watch obviously I watch you guys which I would consider left and I watched guys like your buddy Ben Shapiro I don't know how he missed his name was Shapiro Shapiro yeah so I watch him i watch you know a steven crowder i watch you know john oliver i watch you know just a multiple guy because I feel like the Internet is a better news source than the actual TV I don't even watch TV anymore I love there because it's just it's it's noses it could be very toxic but you you have to you have to have some kind of balance yeah no I love it man I love that you're not watching TV anymore and I love that you're getting a range of opinions obviously I don't agree with those guys but god bless man I mean I hope that we're all in favor of freedom of speech I don't know why they're not supporting Colin Kaepernick because I felt freedom of speech was there like number one issue but all of a sudden when it comes to police violence against African Americans they're a little quiet about that so I hope that they speak out and actually live their principles but I like that you again that
