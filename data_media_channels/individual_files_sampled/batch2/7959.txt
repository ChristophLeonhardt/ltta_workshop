so Donald Trump tried to take credit over and over again for the stock market increases breaking records he said and and he said oh my god it's up by a thousand points in in one year it's the fastest rise ever the economy is booming because of me Sean Hannity and his buddies on Fox News back that up and bragged about it to no end and then the stock market crashed as it almost always does under Republican presidents because they over inflate what what the top 1% gets and and it creates a bubble so they lost 1175 points in the Dow on Monday alone today it has bounced back up a little bit pouncing back up I think about 579 points by the time that it closed so getting almost Friday's losses back which was 666 points but still over a thousand point loss on Monday unaccounted for overall about 1200 point drop which is more than what Trump had bragged about in its increase over a year so how is Sean Hannity gonna handle this uncomfortable unfortunate news well he's got a great idea it turns out it was someone else's fault you'll never guess who let's watch because the Obama economy was so weak all of these years we had just artificially cheap money now what's cheap much cheap money cheap money is when you can borrow at ridiculously low rates the era of cheap money at some point has to come to an end and the government is artificially the Fed has artificially kept the price of money down and the price of borrowing down and now that's going to come to an end and in many ways it represents actually once there's something in many ways it's a sign of the strength of the economy more than anything else I'll give you an example of this and it looks like you know Wall Street hit their bump today but we could be on the verge of long and long-expected correction 10% as normal so I think the underpinnings of the economy are so strong now that the adjustment is coming there's I think a lot of people understand that cheap money is no longer gonna be available I like to decipher these things for you so I'll translate that a equates to so let's get this right the stock market crashes under President Bush it does nothing but rise under Obama somehow that is weak numbers under but when the stock market Rises under Obama that shows a weak economy now in his first year in office the stock market continues to rise under Trump that's good according to Hannity and then it crashes and the crash is because of Obama y know well you know they had artificially cheap money okay that's fair enough and I think that the Obama and and Geithner and summers and all those guys were printing way too much money at the Fed but sort of Trump Trump didn't change any of that so they continued those same policies and they all pump that market all the way up to until it was a bubble so I look up I'm not a partisan in that says I I blamed Obama for a number of things that he did that I thought were not the right economic principles including bailing out the banks which the Republicans agreed to I think that the Fed buying and doing quantitative easing over and over and keeping interest rates too low was problematic I thought it was gonna create a bubble but you can't say the Trump didn't do the same exact things he did them and then added a giant tax cut for the rich and for corporations which they used to do stock buybacks which overinflated the market even more how is that crash then only Obama's fault but not Trump's fault but if that twisted logic wasn't crazy enough he then adds that the crash is actually a sign of how well the economy is doing now what in the world okay I can't even figure out how he jumped from that point A to point B on that one so somehow the market rising under Trump is great rising under Obama is bad crashing under Trump is Obama's fault what is actually a good thing for Trump what I feel like all of Fox news segments should be followed by someone going what if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash joined get the whole young turks Oh every day
