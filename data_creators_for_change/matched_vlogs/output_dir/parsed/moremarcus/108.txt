hello beautiful sexy people how's it
going welcome we're still at VidCon
filming videos here yeah I'm on a bouncy
rocky chair Oh
sign me up into a rap song yo today
we're gonna be looking at youtubers
first videos going through a whole bunch
of different YouTube's first videos
although the youtubers some of the
youtubers we can be looking at a newer
youtuber so I feel like YouTube has
changed quite a lot since people like me
YouTube dinosaur my first video was like
a little kid in his bedroom out bored
I'm not really knowing where YouTube's
what YouTube is or what where it could
go whereas people who start youtube more
freak more recently kind of know what
YouTube is and they know they can come
in and start with this vision of what
exactly they want to have so basically
what I'm saying is these people's videos
first videos often much better than
older youtubers first videos because we
didn't know what we're doing so here we
go the first host we may be looking at
is david dobrik the legend himself I
want my favorite youtubers his vlogs
shit and yeah I had the chance to
actually meet him I met him yesterday at
VidCon and it's pretty cool it's like we
smell each other we had this moment
we'll probably talk about on the podcast
so make sure this is a podcast there's a
link just down there not tonight but
more about VidCon it will come out in
the next few weeks
yeah the early onlet anyway let's go
have a look what David's doing no 15th
of February 2015
wow that's not that oh that's like two
in a bit years old oh he hasn't got the
421 theme that he's got going on right
now let's see david dobrik if you don't
know me that's because I'm a piece of
shit

piece of shit yeah that's my that's my
slot that maybe my fourth girlfriend new
youtuber you know a new French video
every week every Friday I'll try to
upload one so I'll subscribe let me know
if you like the video that's coming up
look a quality so bad of that intro in
terms of like the lighting
grunts like opening intro shot or
whatever then sick I want like I want

corner and we'll put like some
slow-motion shit I'm gonna drive around
the corner like look really cool and
it's just gonna be sick it's not David

so it's so funny cuz his vlogs have now
turned into like his whole crew and
everything that happens in that words
you don't really see him in front of a
camera where he's not holding it so it's
kind of interesting to see that
I swear he always has gum in his mouth
bye even when I saw him the other day
chomping on gum and even there he's just
got cheering on it now cool first video
that is like funny it's not our awkward
I'm a big fan that first video also he
hasn't really changed much now he's
looked into years I think he's lost
weight in his face and his hair is just
that weight has just gone into his hair
his hair is just like uncontrollable mr.
