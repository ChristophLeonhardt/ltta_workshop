LEVERAGING FOR POSITION. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS JOINS US FROM THE NORTH ONE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S LATEST TAKE ON THE SUBJECT. GOOD EVENING, JOHN. GOOD EVENING TO YOU. WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ON THE SUBJECT SINCE NORTH KOREA STARTED GOING SQUISHY ON THE IDEA OF THE SUBJECT, BUT TODAY THE PRESIDENT WAS IN A CHATTY MOOD AND STILL OPTIMISTIC. IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH NATO SECRETARY GENERAL TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP REVEALED THAT, DESPITE INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE FROM NORTH KOREA IN RECENT DAYS, HIS JUNE SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN APPEARS TO BE STILL BE ON TRACK. President Trump: NOTHING HAS CHANGED ON NORTH KOREA THAT WE KNOW OF. WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ANYTHING, AND IF IT DOES, THAT'S FINE. IF IT DOESN'T, I THINK WE WILL HAVE A SUCCESSFUL MEETING. Reporter: AND STATEMENTS MADE EARLIER THIS WEEK, THEY SINGLED OUT COMMENTS FROM JOHN BOLTON WHO DESCRIBED IT TO EACH CHRIS WALLACE WHAT HE SAID WAS A WHITE HOUSE'S VISION FOR NORTH KOREAN DISARMAMENT. WE HAVE ARE VERY MUCH IN MIND THE LIBYA MODEL FROM 2003-2004. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES, THE LIBYAN PROGRAM WAS MUCH SMALLER, BUT THAT WAS BASICALLY THE AGREEMENT THAT WE MADE.

President Trump: THE MODEL ISN'T WHAT WE HAVE AT ALL WHEN WE THINK OF NORTH KOREA. IN LIBYA, WE DECIMATED THAT COUNTRY.

President Trump: HE WOULD BE RUNNING HIS COUNTRY, HIS COUNTRY WOULD BE VERY RICH. WHAT SECURITY GUARANTEES ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE? President Trump: WE ARE WILLING TO DO A LOT AND HE'S WILLING TO DO A LOT, ALSO. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP ASSUMING WE HAVE THE MEETING AND SOMETHING COMES OF IT.

Reporter: PRESENT HAS TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE U.S. PROTECTION FORCE IN SOUTH KOREA COME DOWN FROM THE CURRENT 28,500 TROOPS. NORTH KOREA HAS LONG DEMANDED THAT THE U.S. REMOVE TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA. TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD NOT SAY IF THAT WAS ON THE TABLE. President Trump: I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT, I WILL SAY THAT HE WILL HAVE PRETTY ADEQUATE PROTECTION AND WE WILL SEE HOW IT ALL TURNS OUT.

Bret: IN HIS MEETINGS WITH THE NATO SECRETARY GENERAL TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOW HE IS PREPARED TO TREAT NORTH KOREA AND HOW HE MAY TREAT IRAN GOING FORWARD, SAYING THAT ANY NEW
