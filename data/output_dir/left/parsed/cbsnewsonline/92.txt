MAKING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY, WE 
WILL NOT JEOPARDIZE ANY PART OF 
THIS INVESTIGATION. 
HOWEVER, TODAY WE WILL TAKE 
SOME QUESTIONS, BUT NO DETAILS 
WILL BE RELEASED THAT WILL 
JEOPARDIZE ANYTHING. 
SIR. 
>>REPORTER:  YEAH. 
CHANNEL 7 HERE. 
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER 
THE BODIES? 
>> AT THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO RECOVER A BODY THAT 
WE'RE QUITE CERTAIN IS SHANANN 
WATTS' BODY. 
WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO 
BELIEVE THAT WE KNOW WHERE THE 
BODIES OF THE CHILDREN ARE AND 
RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE IN PROCESS 
ON THAT. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU MENTIONED 
DARCO. 
 
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT. 
>>REPORTER:  HAS HE GIVEN YOU 
ANY INDICATION AND YOU KNOW AND 
I HAVE REPORTED THAT YOU GUYS 
HAVE SPOKEN WITH HIM, HAS HE 
GIVEN YOU ANY INDICATION AS TO 
WHY HE MIGHT HAVE ALLEGEDLY 
COMMITTED THESE CRIMES? 
>> THAT PART, JASON, WE JUST 
CAN'T GET INTO ANY COMMENTS 
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
MADE BY AN INDIVIDUAL IN AN 
INTERVIEW. 
THAT REALLY WOULD JEOPARDIZE 
THE CASE. 
>>REPORTER:  HAS HE BEEN 
COOPERATIVE WITH YOU? 
>> I CAN'T EVEN GIVE YOU AN 
ASSESSMENT OF THAT. 
I APOLOGIZE. 
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU THINK THERE 
COULD BE ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED 
IN THIS HELPING WITH THE BODIES 
OR THAT THERE COULD BE 
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE? 
>> WE HAVE AN AWFUL, AWFUL LOT 
OF PEOPLE WE STILL NEED TO TALK 
TO. 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, AN 
INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS, IT'S 
COMPLEX. 
WE TALK TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE 
NO MATTER HOW LOOSELY RELATED 
TO THIS THEY MIGHT BE, AND SO 
WE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS WE NEED 
TO TALK TO. 
IN TERMS OF -- I THINK IT'S 
SAFE TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF 
ANY DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY OR 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WE'RE NOT 
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AT ALL. 
AND SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. 
>>REPORTER:  THE STATEMENTS BY 
WATTS AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE 
BODIES? 
>> IT WOULD BE A TOTALITY OF 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A FULL 
POLICE INVESTIGATION REGARDING 
ANY MORE DETAILS THAN THAT I 
WILL NOT GIVE OUT. 
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU KNOW WHEN 
THEY WERE KILLED MORE OR LESS? 
>> THAT I DO NOT HAVE AT MY 
DISPOSAL. 
>>REPORTER:  ANY SENSE OF IF HE 
KILLED THEM ALL AT THE SAME 
TIME, DID HE DO IT OVER THE 
WEEKEND, CAN YOU TELL US A 
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT? 
>> THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE 
MANY DETAILS WE ARE NOT ABLE TO 
DISCUSS AT THIS TIME. 
AS I SAID BEFORE, THE CASE IS 
STILL ONGOING, THE 
INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
CONTINUING. 
>>REPORTER:  IS THERE A 
TIMELINE BETWEEN WHEN MR. WATTS 
WAS ARRESTED AND WHEN THE BODY 
OF SHANANN WAS RECOVERED, CAN 
YOU GIVE US THE DETAIL ON THE 
TIMELINE? 
>> I DON'T WANT TO ATTEST TO 
ANYTHING THAT I'M NOT CERTAIN 
ABOUT MYSELF OR WOULD 
JEOPARDIZE THE CASE IN THE 
MATTER. 
>>REPORTER:  THE VICTIM'S 
FAMILY ON SOCIAL MEDIA SAID HE 
CONFESSED TO THE MURDERS. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT? 
>> AGAIN, THAT WOULD BE A 
DETAIL I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
DISCLOSE AT THIS TIME. 
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU TALK MORE 
ABOUT THE TOLL THIS CASE HAS 
TAKEN ON THE TOWN OF FREDRICK, 
ON YOUR OFFICERS, ON THE TEAM? 
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY. 
THAT IS A QUESTION I CAN'T 
ANSWER, AND IT'S BEEN EARTH 
SHATTERING. 
OUR SMALL DEPARTMENT, 20 PLUS 
OFFICERS, WE'VE BEEN WORKING 
AROUND THE CLOCK ON THIS, AND 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN 
WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY, 
WITH THE COMMAND STAFF, WITH 
THE TOWN OF FREDRICK 
THEMSELVES, OBVIOUSLY THE MEDIA 
AND IT'S BEEN NONSTOP. 
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THERE'S 
NO END IN SIGHT, BUT IT'S 
CERTAINLY ONGOING. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU TALK ABOUT -- 
I KNOW THAT THE FAMILY IS 
LOCATED ON THE EAST COAST FOR 
SHANANN, JUST KIND OF BRINGING 
THEM HERE AND HOW YOU GUYS ARE 
TALKING TO THE FAMILY. 
>> OUT OF RESPECT TO THE 
FAMILY, I DON'T WANT TO 
DISCLOSE ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
PERSONAL LIVES. 
THANK YOU, THOUGH. 
>>REPORTER:  ANY IDEA WHEN MORE 
INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WILL 
BE HERE? 
>> THE AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF 
WARRANTLESS ARREST WAS SEALED 
LAST NIGHT AT OUR REQUEST BY A 
DISTRICT COURT JUDGE. 
WE DID SO SO THAT WE COULD 
FINISH UP A FEW OF THE 
INVESTIGATIVE STEPS. 
MY ANTICIPATION IS THAT ON OR 
ABOUT MONDAY WHEN WE MAKE A 
FILING DECISION MY HOPE WILL BE 
THAT WE CAN ASK THE COURT TO 
UNSEAL THAT INFORMATION AND 
MAKE IT A PUBLIC RECORD AT THIS 
POINT IN TIME. 
>>REPORTER:  AND THE LAST 
PERSON THAT SAID THAT THEY SAW 
SHANANN WAS CHRIS TALKED TO US, 
HE WAS THE LAST ONE THAT SAW 
HER AT 5:00 A.M. 
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE YOU KNOW 
OF THAT KNOW OF THE LAST PLACE 
OR TIME THAT SHE WAS SEEN 
PHYSICALLY BY SOMEBODY OTHER 
THAN THE SUSPECT? 
>> AGAIN, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO 
SAY THAT THAT'S, YOU KNOW, ALL 
PART OF DEVELOPING A TIMELINE 
IN A CASE LIKE THIS. 
WE HAVE MANY, MANY PEOPLE TO 
TALK TO. 
SO ANYTHING THAT YOU HEAR LIKE 
THAT, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY 
THINGS THAT WE CHECK INTO, BUT 
THEN WE ALSO TRY TO VERIFY AND 
TALK TO OTHERS AND REALLY 
COMPLETE THAT TIMELINE AS BEST 
WE CAN. 
>>REPORTER:  WE HEARD SHE GOT 
BACK FROM A BUSINESS TRIP. 
AT THE AIRPORT, TICKET, 
SURVEILLANCE? 
>> IT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE 
DETAILS THAT I JUST DON'T WANT 
TO DISCLOSE. 
LET'S TAKE ABOUT TWO MORE 
QUESTIONS, GUYS. 
>>REPORTER:  HER BODY WAS 
FOUND, BUT IS THERE ANY REASON 
TO BELIEVE SHE WAS KILLED 
ELSEWHERE, JUST DROPPED OFF 
THERE? 
>> WE CAN DISCLOSE THAT HER 
BODY HAS BEEN LOCATED, HOWEVER, 
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING FURTHER 
THAN THAT. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU CAN'T TALK 
ABOUT THE  
>> MATTER OF DEATH -- WE DON'T 
WANT TO SPECULATE ANYTHING OR 
RULE ANYTHING OUT. 
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR 
TODAY, GUYS, AND I THANK YOU 
ALL FOR COMING. 
AGAIN, I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL 
THE AGENCIES IN CHARGE THAT 
HELPED US OUT, AND GOOD DAY TO 
YOU ALL. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THAT HAS BEEN A PRESS 
ONFERENCE IN FREDRICK, 
COLORADO WITH VARIOUS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
PERTAINING TO THE MURDER OF 
SHANANN WATTS AND HER TWO 
DAUGHTERS, BELLA AGE 4 AND 
CELESTE AGE 3. THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE CHARGES THAT 
WILL COME AGAINST THE HUSBAND 
OF SHANANN, CHRISTOPHER WATT, 
AGE 33. 
THEY DID NOT SAY SPECIFICALLY 
WHICH CHARGES, WE CAN ASSUME 
SOME FORM OF HOMICIDE, MURDER 
CHARGES. 
THEY SAID THAT IT WILL BE 
DETERMINED BY MONDAY. 
THEY WILL BRING THOSE CHARGES 
THEN. 
HE IS IN JAIL RIGHT NOW. 
HE HAS A BAIL HEARING COMING 
UP. 
AS YOU REMEMBER, THIS FAMILY, 
THE WOMAN WHO WAS 15 MONTHS 
PREGNAT AND THE TWO GIRLS WENT 
MISSING A FEW DAYS AGO, THE 
HUSBAND CHRISTOPHER WATTS WENT 
ON TV PLEADING FOR THEM TO BE 
SAFELY RETURNED BEFORE REPORTS 
SAY THAT HE ACTUALLY WAS 
CONFRONTED AND CONFESSED TO 
THEIR MURDERS. 
ONE OF THE INTERESTING QUOTES 
THAT CAME OUT OF THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WAS FROM ONE OF 
THOSE LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS WHO 
SAID THAT THEY'RE A SMALL 
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT THIS 
HAS TAKEN AN EARTH-SHATTERING 
TOLL ON THEM, THIS 
INVESTIGATION, THEY'VE BEEN 
ORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. 
WE'VE SHOWN YOU A FEW IMAGES 
TOO OF THE FAMILY'S HOUSE WHERE 
THERE IS A SMALL MEMORIAL THAT 
IS GROWING WITH STUFFED ANIMALS 
AND FLOWERS.

HE ADDED, QUOTE, WE ARE

ENFORCEMENT TO IDENTIFY THE

APPROPRIATE LEGAL ACTION.

FRUSTRATION OF THOSE WHO 
RECEIVED THESE BOGUS E-MAILS.

INVESTIGATION SHOWS, QUOTE, NO 
EVIDENCE OF HACKING OR
