3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,589
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've actually been</font>

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,450
pretty excited budget throughout not

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,980
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I live in London</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,510
had the opportunity to see the schottky

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,219
was getting excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also managed to</font>

8
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,630
see the torch earlier this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

9
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,009
was so much fun I got to the highest

10
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,330
reached around eight in the morning

11
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,619
because I'm so used to having to queue

12
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:17,880
for things being a member of the harry

13
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,410
potter generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really didn't need</font>

14
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there was one other couple</font>

15
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,590
that as I got closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scheduled</font>

16
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,029
time with the torches arrival which I

17
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,710
think was around 10 20 people did start

18
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,420
flooding in and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 the whole</font>

19
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,099
high street was packed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even though I</font>

20
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">only saw the torch for about 20 seconds</font>

21
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,549
or so it was so worth it and had such

22
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,410
fun time more for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy of the day</font>

23
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,790
than anything else it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so rare that</font>

24
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,410
there's that much noise and movement in

25
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,760
my community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was really sunny</font>

26
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,290
days so everyone just felt extremely

27
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,000
positive and excited I think you did a

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,530
very good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizing it and they did</font>

29
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,670
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job of getting there on</font>

30
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,440
time generally I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had an awful lot</font>

31
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,059
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun thing about London in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the summer</font>

32
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,620
is that every part of it feels like a

33
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,510
festival there's always something on and

34
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,940
loud and music and things to go to and

35
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,829
things moving and in a sense that's the

36
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,170
same in<font color="#CCCCCC"> wintertime but ever does it feel</font>

37
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,910
festival<font color="#E5E5E5"> e everyone kind of feels ready</font>

38
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,469
to hibernate they always get

39
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,690
anticipatory holiday blues you can

40
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,339
imagine myself in October thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

41
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,020
some are not here yeah there are things

42
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,729
i like about autumn but it's not the

43
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,680
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as being able to go outside and</font>

44
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,450
dance around my friends and stuff I just

45
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like there's so much look forward</font>

46
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,000
to in summer and everyone makes a real

47
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,680
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make their some was like the</font>

48
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,299
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of their year I wonder what it</font>

49
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,500
would be like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put as much effort</font>

50
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">into winter time I enjoy my summer so</font>

51

52
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,229
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> either/or situation I'm just going to</font>

53
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and carry that energy through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,930
winter who knows how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go</font>

55

especially want the temperatures start

56
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,750
dropping but I would be supporting

57
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,310
Britain of course and I also be

58
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,040

the world but normally cook bricks can
