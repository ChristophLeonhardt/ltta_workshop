oh it is very sweet like a cotton candy
7-eleven Slurpee kind of I would say it
actually tastes kind of different than
it looks it's much more of a bright
appley flavor in there
it's aggressive getting this size of
this would be a mistake why would you
sell this why am i drinking this in a
small dose it's kind of tasty I don't
know if I can recommend getting it but
it's not terrible
you're paying six dollars for Instagram
and then it turns into this like green
mush I feel like it'd be better to spend
$6 on like soggy bodega sandwich instead
of this and we'll probably be more
filling and worthwhile
