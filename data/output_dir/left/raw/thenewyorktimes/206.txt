1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,203
When I stumbled across a high
school graduation in Gaza City,

2
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:08,826
it was disorienting.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,630
I could have been
in Southern California

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,590
or suburban New Jersey.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,980
Eager, excited kids in
their caps and gowns.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,750
And then, a big dance party.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,520
But these graduates of Gaza’s
American International School

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,500
are the privileged few,
the sons and daughters

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,660
of the elite.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,680
They’ve come of age
in a place that’s

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,910
been under blockade since
they were 7 years old.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,450
And even they can’t be sure
that they’ll ever get out.

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,050
The other 99 percent of
Gazans are far worse off.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,440
They’re stuck here in one of the
most densely populated places

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,480
on earth, with little or no work,
sporadic electricity,

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,980
filthy water and
worsening public health.

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,450
The most acute
shortage is of hope.

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,940
Since March, thousands
have gathered

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,430
in protests demanding
a right of return

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,234
to their ancestral homes
in what is now Israel.

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,300
The protests were the
idea of a young activist.

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,180
He imagined masses of people
camping out peacefully

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,660
along the Israeli fence
that hems in Gaza,

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,770
then knocking it over
and walking across,

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,920
making a point
if nothing else.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,950
But he lost control
of what he had started.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,520
Hamas, the militant group
that has run Gaza since 2007,

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,870
took over.

29
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,290
The demonstrations
gave Hamas

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,820
a way to put themselves
on the side of their

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,371
frustrated constituents and
rage against a common enemy:

32
00:01:58,371 --> 00:01:59,380
Israel.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,970
The protest camps
set up along the fence

34
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,288
can make you do
a double take.

35
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,900
In parts, they look like
a community festival,

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,530
a carnival, a fair,

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,600
like a distant cousin
to Burning Man.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,870
Women prepare
falafel sandwiches.

39
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,970
Barbers give haircuts
and trim beards.

40
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,480
Lip synchers and dancers
perform in the shade.

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,485
Actors ham it up playing
cruel Israeli soldiers.

42
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,656
Families come with their children.

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,090
It all seems like fun,
but closer to the fence,

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,220
it looks more like a battle.

45
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,970
The protesters, mostly
young men, but some women

46
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,040
and boys too, want to break
through the barrier

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,470
separating them from Israel.

48
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,310
The soldiers are
determined to stop them.

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,370
Scores have been
killed so far in Gaza.

50
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,702
Thousands have been injured.

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,940
Hamas calls the
protests peaceful —

52
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,490
because nobody is
firing rifles or rockets,

53
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,110
they say.

54
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,060
But Israel sees some
in the crowds throwing

55
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,190
grenades and
Molotov cocktails.

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,270
The protesters have
organized themselves

57
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,690
into teams — of rock
throwers with their slings,

58
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,560
the wire cutters who drag
away coils of barbed wire.

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
And the tire teams who
collect and then burn tires

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,660
to create a smokescreen
against sniper fire.

61
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,830
Other squads turn toys
into firebombs.

62
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,620
Rags soaked in gasoline
are tied to frilly kites

63
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,000
and sent flying
toward Israel.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,130
Acres of farmland and
forest have burned.

65
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,650
Ambulance crews
circle in a loop, waiting

66
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,760
until they hear gunshots,

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,490
and running when they 
see someone fall.

68
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,170
Nearby, doctors and nurses
in hospital tents

69
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,630
tend to the wounded.

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,870
What the protests
can achieve is unclear.

71
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,000
The organizers talk
about increasing

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,920
international pressure on
Israel to lift the siege of Gaza,

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,950
and it seems like nothing
would do more

74
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,120
to accomplish that than
a tremendous body count.

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,040
It’s all meant to ramp up
to a climactic conclusion

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,940
over two days:

77
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,400
May 14, with the U.S. Embassy's
move to Jerusalem

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
on the 70th anniversary
of the state of Israel,

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,270
and May 15, when Palestinians
remember that history

80
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,140
as the Nakba,
a catastrophe.

81
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,710
The head of Hamas
in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar,

82
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,820
now says that the protests
will continue indefinitely

83
00:04:52,820 --> 00:00:00,000
until, he says,
“We break the siege.”
