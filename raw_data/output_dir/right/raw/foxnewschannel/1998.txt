1
00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:02,988
DANA PERINO.

2
00:00:02,988 --> 00:00:10,296
"THE FIVE" ."

3
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:11,096
DONALD TRUMP NICKED THE IRAN

4
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:11,830
DEAL WHICH HE SAID HE WOULD DO

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,899
ALL ALONG.

6
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:15,834
>> I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT

7
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:19,038
THE UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAW

8
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:21,006
FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

9
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,944
WE WILL BE INSTITUTING THE

10
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:27,346
HIGHEST LEVEL OF ECONOMIC

11
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:28,480
SANCTIONS.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,482
ANY NATION THAT HELPS IRAN AND

13
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:32,351
ITS QUEST FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS

14
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,119
COULD ALSO BE STRONGLY

15
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,488
SANCTIONED BY THE UNITED STATES.

16
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:39,625
AMERICA WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE

17
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,627
TO NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL.

18
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:44,163
TODAY'S ACTION SENDS A CRITICAL

19
00:00:44,163 --> 00:00:44,897
MESSAGE.

20
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,665
THE UNITED STATES NO LONGER

21
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:49,702
MAKES EMPTY THREATS.

22
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:52,204
WHEN I MAKE PROMISES, I KEEP

23
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:52,871
THEM.

24
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:53,872
>> Greg: BEFORE THAT,

25
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:55,608
APPARENTLY JOHN KERRY SPOKE TO

26
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:56,909
IRANIAN LEADERS ABOUT SAVING THE

27
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:57,509
DEAL.

28
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,879
I DON'T BLAME THE GUY.

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,680
KERRY'S LEGACY IS UNRAVELING

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,349
FASTER THAN A MUMMY ON A

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,483
MERRY-GO-ROUND.

32
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,721
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE IRAN DEAL

33
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:10,889
WAS LEGACY, IT WASN'T SECURITY.

34
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,058
BEFORE THIS DEAL, IRAN WAS ON

35
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:13,492
THE ROPES.

36
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:15,894
THE ECONOMY WAS HEADED INTO

37
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:16,595
NORTH KOREAN TERRITORY AND IT

38
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:20,132
WAS ABOUT AS STABLE AS

39
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,100
JOHN KERRY ON A SKATEBOARD.

40
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,170
THEN WE THREW THEM A LIFELINE.

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,706
STUPID.

42
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:28,907
WE WENT TO NEGOTIATE WITH

43
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:31,710
APOCALYPTIC THEOCRAT'S AND WE

44
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,379
SENT THIS GUY.

45
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,750
DO JAMES TAYLOR STROM SOME

46
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,050
MUSIC?

47
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,789
THE IRAN DEAL, THE NEW GUY,

48
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,691
TRUMP, TORE IT DOWN.

49
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,293
DOES THIS MEAN WAR?

50
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:48,627
IF YOU THINK THE CURRENT

51
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:49,628
PRESIDENT HARBORS A GRUDGE

52
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:51,563
AGAINST IRAN, YOU'D BE WRONG.

53
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:53,198
HE SEEMS WILLING TO TALK TO JUST

54
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:53,632
ABOUT ANYONE.

55
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:55,868
THE ONLY THING HE HATES HIS DUMB

56
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:56,168
DEALS.

57
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:58,570
HE WOULD RATHER START, THIS IS

58
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,374
HIS VERSION OF A RESET WITH

59
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:02,741
LEVERAGE.

60
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:05,477
>> IRAN'S LEADERS WILL NATURALLY

61
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:06,111
SAY THAT THEY REFUSED TO

62
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:09,914
NEGOTIATE A NEW DEAL.

63
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,684
THEY REFUSE, AND THAT'S FINE.

64
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,185
I WOULD PROBABLY SAY THE SAME

65
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,321
THING IF I WAS IN THEIR POSITION

66
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,055
THING IF I WAS IN THEIR POSITIO

67
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:16,422
POSITION.

68
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:17,956
BUT THE FACT IS THEY ARE GOING

69
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:22,528
TO WANT TO MAKE A NEW AND

70
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:22,961
LASTING DEAL.

71
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:25,698
ONE THAT BENEFITS ALL OF IRAN

72
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,099
AND THE IRANIAN PEOPLE.

73
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,904
WHEN THEY DO, I AM READY,

74
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,305
WILLING, AND ABLE.

75
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:34,573
GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR

76
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:37,743
IRAN COMMAND GREAT THINGS CAN

77
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:40,512
HAPPEN FOR THE PEACE AND

78
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,246
STABILITY THAT WE ALL WANT IN

79
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,482
THE MIDDLE EAST.

80
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,883
>> Greg: THAT'S NICE.

81
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,885
FOR THOSE OF YOU IN A PANIC,

82
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,854
REMEMBER THAT YOU FELT THAT WAY

83
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:50,289
ABOUT NORTH KOREA TOO.

84
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:52,891
AS TRUMP DEALS WITH THE WORST ON

85
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,893
THE PLANET, HE SCRATCHES OFF

86
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,295
ISIS AND NORTH KOREA, IRAN SEEMS

87
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:57,629
NEXT.

88
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,064
IT'S A SKILL SET THAT HISTORY

89
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,133
WILL BE KINDER TO THAN

90
00:03:01,133 --> 00:00:00,000
JOHN KERRY.
