CAROLINA'S AS WELL AS THOSE 
ACROSS THE NATION FROM 
ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS 
TO VOLUNTEER, OFFER SERVICES 
AND HELP WITH OUR RELIEF 
EFFORTS. 
AT THIS TIME, THE NEED FOR THIS 
TYPE OF COORDINATION IN NEW 
HANOVER COUNTY HAS OUTGROWN THE 
CAPACITY OF THE UNITED WAY OF 
THE CAPE FEAR AREA. 
CONSEQUENTLY, AN INCIDENT 
MANAGEMENT TEAM ASSIGNED TO 
HANDLE VOLUNTEER AND DONATION 
COORDINATION ARRIVED YESTERDAY. 
IT IS FULLY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED 
IN ENSURING THE VOLUNTEER 
OPPORTUNITIES ARE DELIVERED 
SWIFTLY TO OUR RESIDENTS. 
THOSE WISHING TO VOLUNTEER OR 
DONATE SHOULD NOW CALL 910, 
THIS IS A NEW NUMBER. THIS IS 
THE VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY PHONE 
NUMBER OR EMAIL AT 
HURRICANERELIEF@NHCDOV.COM . WE 
WILL WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO 
WANT TO HELP AND THEY ARE 
CURRENTLY STATIONED AT THE PORT 
CITY COMMUNITY CHURCH WHERE 
THEY ARE COORDINATING 
ADDITIONAL SUPPLY PROVISIONS. 
MOMENTS AGO, SENDER MICHAEL LEE,
THE COMMISSIONER COCKE COUNTY 
MANAGER AND MYSELF SPENT THE 
BETTER PART OF OUR MORNING AT 
PORT CITY AND THEY WANT TO TAKE 
A SECOND TO THINK OF THE 
HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE 
OVER THERE AS WE SPEAK DOING 
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HELP OUR 
COMMUNITIES. IT IS AN 
INCREDIBLE SITE TO IN THIS AND 
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THOSE 
EFFORTS. 
I WILL SPEND A BRIEF AMOUNT OF 
TIME TALKING ABOUT ROAD 
CONDITIONS, RIVERS, AND 
REENTRY. 
WE STILL ARE ENCOURAGING OR 
ASKING FOLKS NOT TO COME HOME. 
WE WANT YOU HERE, WE LOVE YOU 
AND WE MISS YOU BUT ACCESS TO 
WILMINGTON IS STILL VERY 
LIMITED AND IS NOT IMPROVING AS 
QUICKLY AS WE WOULD LIKE. 
ROADS THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTY AND 
ESPECIALLY IN SURROUNDING AREAS 
THAT LEAD INTO OUR COUNTY, ARE 
UNSAFE FOR TRAVEL. 
AS THE RIVERS CONTINUE TO RISE, 
ADDITIONAL FLOODING IS EXPECTED.
SINKHOLES ARE DEVELOPING UNDER 
FLOODED ROADS, MAKING IT 
HAZARDOUS TO DRIVERS. 
WE CANNOT REITERATE TO STAY 
AUTHOR WROTE. 
IF YOU HAVE TO BE ON THE ROAD, 
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THROUGH 
ANY STANDING WATER. 
WITHIN NEW HANOVER COUNTY, 
CHERRY BEACH, REOPENED TO 
RESIDENTS YESTERDAY. 
I WILL EMPHASIZE THE WORD 
RESIDENCE. 
WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH OPENS TO 
RESIDENTS THIS MORNING. 
AT 7 AM. 
SOME OTHER GROUPS LIKE 
CONTRACTORS FOR EMERGENCY 
REPAIRS, ETC., CAN GAIN ACCESS 
TO WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH AT NOON 
TODAY. 
CHECK WITH YOUR BEACH 
COMMUNITIES ABOUT PROPER 
DOCUMENTATION NEEDED TO GAIN 
ACCESS. 
THE COUNTY'S LANDFILL RESUMED 
OPERATIONS TODAY AND LANDFILL 
HOURS ARE 6:30 A.M. 
TO 5:30 P.M. 
ON WEEKDAYS AND 6:30 A.M.

THE TRASH PICKUP SERVICES 
RESUMED THIS MORNING AS NORMAL. 
THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE RECYCLING 
OR DEBRIS REMOVAL. 
MONDAY ROUTES WILL BE PICKED UP 
TOMORROW. 
IN THE CITY OF WILLINGTON IF 
YOUR TRASH IS NORMALLY ON 
MONDAY IT WILL BE TOMORROW. 
RESIDENTS SHOULD MONITOR THEIR 
TRASH PICKUP PROVIDERS FOR WHEN 
REGULAR SERVICE WILL RESUME. 
SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 12, 11 PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 74 LOOTING, 
2 FOR CURFEW VIOLATIONS AND 2 
FOR BREAKING INTO VEHICLES. 
OUR CURFEW IS STILL IN EFFECT 
FROM 8 PM-6 PM UNTIL FURTHER 
NOTICE, COUNTYWIDE. 
CREWS CONTINUE TO WORK ON 
DEBRIS REMOVAL AND RESTORING 
POWER TO THE COMMUNITY. 
AS OF 11:30 THIS MORNING, THERE 
ARE STILL 61,600 RESIDENTS IN 
-- HOUSEHOLD IN OUR COUNTY WITH 
NO POWER. 
THAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT. 
ANOTHER 11,000 OF OUR 
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE POWER AND THE 
CREWS ARE OUT THERE. 
YOU HAVE ALL SEEN THEM DOING 
EVERYTHING THEY CAN. I JUST 
SPOKE PERSONALLY WITH A DUKE 
REPRESENTATIVE WHO WAS HERE IN 
THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER 
WHO TOLD ME THAT EVERY LINE OF 
POWER HAS ECRU ON IT. 
THANK THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING IF YOU SEE THEM. 
I ASKED HIM WHEN POWER WOULD BE 
RESTORED AT MY HOUSE AND I GOT 
ONE OF THESE. 
WHICH WAS NOT A GOOD SIGN. 
SO I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING 
OUT THERE. 
WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO 
CONTINUE TO BE PATIENT. DUKE 
ENERGY'S COMMENT WAS THAT SOME 
OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PART -- 
REPARATION WORK STILL IS AHEAD 
IN AREAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED 
MASSIVE FLOODING AND STRUCTURAL 
DAMAGE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND 
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO 
REPAIR. 
NEW HANOVER COUNTY HAS BEEN 
DECLARED A FEDERAL DISASTER 
AREA. 
RESIDENTS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
FEMA, INDIVIDUAL DISASTER 
ASSISTANCE. 
FOR MORE INFORMATION AND TO 
APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE, YOU CAN 
CALL 800-621-3262.  
OUR DIRECTOR WILL BE HERE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND I LOOK FORWARD TO 
SPEAKING TO HIM AND WE WILL 
MAKE THE FOLLOWING REQUEST OF 
HIM PERSONALLY THAT FEMA SET UP 
A DISASTER RECOVERY CENTER TO 
FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE 
FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND 
TEMPORARY HOUSING HUNDREDS OF 
OUR CITIZENS ARE DISPLACED AND 
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT FEMA WILL 
DEPLOY THOSE ASSETS AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. 
WE ARE CONTINUING TO OPERATE 
THE HIGH SCHOOL AS OUR COUNTY 
SHOULDER AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE 
593 RESIDENCE. IT WILL REMAIN 
OPEN AND OPERATIONAL UNTIL IT 
IS NO LONGER NEEDED. 
THERE IS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY 
FOTHOSE SEEKING SHELTER AND 
PETS ARE WELCOME. 
THOSE WITH SPECIALMEDICAL 
NEEDS DO NEED -- WHO NEED 
SHELTER SHOULD CALL -- OUR 
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER 
CONTINUES TO OPERATE RIGHT OVER 
HERE, 24 HOURS PER DAY, SEVEN 
DAYS PER WEEK TO SERVE OUR 
COMMUNITY AND KEEP OUR 
RESIDENTS SAFE. 
FOR NONEMERGENCY NEEDS, 
REMEMBER TO CALL 910-718-SIX 
800. 
THE COUNTY DOES HOPE TO RESUME 
NORMAL OPERATIONS AND NORMAL 
BUSINESS HOURS ON MONDAY, 
SEPTEMBER 24. UNTIL THEN COCKE 
COUNTY STAFF WILL REMAIN 
OPERATING THE EMERGENCY 
SHELTERS AND FOR THAT WE ARE 
GRATEFUL. 
WE ARE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS AND 
WE HAVE BEGUN OUR LONG JOURNEY 
BACK AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE 
WITNESSED THE SAME THINGS I 
HAVE WITNESSED IN TERMS OF THE 
NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR AND 
FRIEND HELPING FRIEND, STRANGER 
HELPING STRANGER. 
IT CONTINUES TO HUMBLE ME AND 
IMPRESS ME AND I JUST ENCOURAGE 
ALL OF OUR CITIZENS TO CONTINUE 
DOING THAT. 
AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO 
THANK THE MAYOR FOR BEING HERE 
AND ASK HIM TO COME UP AND MAKE 
A STATEMENT OR ADDRESS ANY 
OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE 
AND I WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR 
QUESTIONS AFTER THAT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. 
I WANT TO BE CERTAIN THAT ALL 
OF OUR RESIDENTS UNDERSTAND 
THAT EVERY ONE OF OUR MAJOR 
INTERSECTIONS WILL HAVE 
ROUNDABOUTS AND SOME OF YOU 
HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THAT. 
THEY ARE CONED AND YOU WILL SEE 
THEM AS YOU APPROACH THE 
INTERSECTIONS. 
THOSE INTERSECTIONS, THAT IS 
HOW WE WILL BE DEALING WITH 
THOSE. 
THE CLEARING OF OUR STREETS, WE 
ARE CURRENTLY AT 60% AND MORE 
TO COME. 
WE HAVE CREWS, 30 CREWS THAT 
ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, 
OPERATIONAL WHO ARE WORKING 
VERY HARD TO CLEAR THE STREETS. 
OBVIOUSLY THE SECOND PART OF 
THIS IS THE PICKUP OF THE 
DEBRIS THAT IS BEING CLEARED 
BUT WE ASK RESIDENTS AS THEY 
START WORKING IN THE YARDS AND 
CLEANING UP THEIR YARDS, TO 
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY PUT THE 
DEBRIS ON THE SIDE BY THE ROAD 
AND DO NOT BLOCK THE ROAD IF AT 
ALL POSSIBLE. 
I ALSO SPOKE WITH THE DUKE 
REPRESENTATIVE WHO INDICATED 
SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT AREAS 
IN DOWNTOWN ARE IN SOUTH OR 
LEANDER, -- SEVERAL OTHER 
AREAS, THOSE AREAS ARE WHAT I 
HAVE BEEN TOLD WAS DESTROYED. 
IT WILL TAKE SOMETIMES FOR 
THOSE CREWS TO GET IN THERE. 
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.
>>> THERE HAS BEEN SOME LIMITED
ACCESS THE WAY THEY'RE BRINGING
GASOLINE IN THERE'S LIMITED RAYS
THAT THEY BROUGHT IT IN BUT THEY
HAVE BEEN USING HIGH WATER
TRUCKS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE RIVERS
WILL BE CRESTING TODAY.
SOME WILL BE CRESTING INTO NEXT
WEEK.
SO WE'LL BE DEALING WITH A
FLOODING EVENT GOING INTO NEXT
WEEKEND.
WE ASK FOR EVERYBODY'S PATIENCE.
PLEASE STAY SAFE OUT THERE.
AND AGAIN THE CURFEW IS STILL IN
PLACE FROM 8:00 P.M.
TO
6:00 A.M.
TOMORROW.
AND THE CURFEW WILL BE EVALUATED
ON A DAILY BASIS.
WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TOWARDS
OR WE MAY LIFT IT.
AS POWER COMES ON AND WE GO BACK
TO NORMAL WE WILL BE EVALUATING
IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BE SAFE.
>> ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS AT
THIS TIME?
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU SPOKE OF SOME
OF THE RISKS OF DRIVING.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
CONSEQUENCES OF PEOPLE DRIVING
BACK AND BLOCKING EMERGENCY
CREWS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO BE
RESCUED?
>> JESSICA, YOU WANT TO ANSWER
THAT.
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.
FIRST OFF IT PUTS FIRST
RESPONDERS THAT ARE PRIORITIZED
FOR OTHER THINGS DIVERTS THEM
UNNECESSARILY IF YOU GET IN
TROUBLE, IF YOU'RE IN STANDING
WATER.
>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO
OFFICIALS IN NEW HANOVER COUNTY,
NORTH CAROLINA GIVING UPDATES.
WILMINGTON AS YOU KNOW IS
THREATENED BY RISING WATER
LEVELS.
LET'S ALSO LISTEN TO THE
GOVERNOR GIVING AN UPDATE TO
STATEWIDE RESOURCES.
>> TO BEGIN THE FEMA PROCESS
CALL 1-800-621-FEMA.
AND THAT IS FOR TELL PHONE.
BUT TO DO IT ONLINE VISIT
disasterassistance.gov.
HERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL UPDATES.
AS OF THIS MORNING NORTH
CAROLINA HAS 26 CONFIRMED DEATHS
DUE TO THIS STORM.
WE KNOW NORTH CAROLINA FAMILIES
AND FRIENDS OF THESE VICTIMS ARE
SUFFERING AND WE EXTEND OUR
DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THEM.
THERE ARE MORE THAN 1100 ROAD
CLOSURES INCLUDING I-95 AND I-40
STILL.
NUMEROUS HIGHWAYS AND OTHER
PRIMARY ROUTES.
WHILE ROAD CONDITIONS ARE
STARTING TO IMPROVE IN SOME
PARTS OF OUR STATE RISING
CREEKS, STREAMS, AND RIVERS
CONTINUE TO MAKE TRAVEL UNSAFE
IN MANY AREAS OF OUR STATE.
343,000 PEOPLE APPROXIMATELY ARE
WITHOUT POWER AND FIRST
RESPONDERS HAVE REPORTED
RESCUING AND EVACUATING MORE
THAN 2200 PEOPLE AND 578 ANIMALS
AND RESCUES ARE CONTINUING.
FARMERS ARE SEEING FLOOD AND
BINNED DAMAGE TO THEIR CROPS.
A QUARTER TO A HALF OF THE
TOBACCO CROP WAS STILL IN THE
FIELD AND DAMAGED.
COTTON, PEANUTS, AND OTHER CROPS
AT HARVEST SUFFERED DAMAGE AS
WELL.
APPROXIMATELY 10,000 PEOPLE ARE
STAYING THIS OUR SHELTERS AND
THE COUNTLESS MORE STAYING WITH
FRIENDS, FAMILIES, OR IN HOTELS.
I KNOW IT WAS HARD TO LEAVE HOME
AND IT'S EVEN HARDER TO WAIT AND
WONDER WHETHER YOU EVEN HAVE A
HOME TO GO BACK TO.
BUT PLEASE FOR YOUR SAFETY AND
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS DO NOT TRY
TO RETURN HOME YET.
PARTICULARLY IN THE COUNTIES OF
PENDER, NEW HANOVER, AND
BRUNSWICK.
ROADS REMAIN DANGEROUS.
AND NEW ROAD CLOSINGS ARE STILL
HAPPENING.
KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE AND
PEOPLE WILL BE WORKING TO HELP
YOU.
I WAS IN NEW BERN YESTERDAY.
THE DAMAGE THERE IS DEVASTATING.
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH
PEOPLE, SOME WHO ROAD OUT THE
STORM AND WHO SAID THIGH THEY
WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN IF THEY HAD
THE CHANCE TO MAKE THE -- WHO
SAID THEY WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN
IF THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO DO IT
OVER.
I ALSO JOINED THE BAPTIST MEN AS
THEY HANDED OUT HOT MEALS TO
PEOPLE IN NEED.
AS DISTRESSING AS THIS DAMAGE IS
IT'S EQUALLY HEARTENING TO WATCH
NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS AND
SEE VOLUNTEERS AND PEOPLE OF
FAITH STEPPING UP TO DO THEIR
PART.
THIS IS THE NORTH CAROLINA THAT
I KNOW IN MY HEART.
AND IT IS THE REASON WE WILL
MAKE THIS STATE WHOLE AGAIN.
I KNOW FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS
FEELS LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT JUST
WON'T END.
I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF
THE PRESENT AND ARE SCARED OF
THE FUTURE.
BUT PLEASE KNOW WE WILL NOT GIVE
UP ON YOU.
I WANT TO RECOGNIZE MIKE
SPRAYBERRY.
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE.
THE STATE EMERGENCY OPERATION
CENTER IS STILL ACTIVATED AT A
LEVEL 1 WITH ALL OF OUR STATE
AND FEDERAL PARTNERS WITH
VOLUNTEERS AND ALSO THE FOLKS
FROM PRIVATE SECTOR.
ON DAY NINE OF THE OPERATION FOR
HURRICANE FLORENCE I WANT TO
STRESS TO EVERYONE THAT WE NEED
TO REMAIN VIGILANT AS MANY OF
OUR RIVERS IN EASTERN NORTH
CAROLINA WILL BE CRESTING OVER
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, IN FACT
THROUGH SATURDAY.
SIGNIFICANT OUT OF THE RIVERBANK
FLOODING IS EXPECTED AND WILL
CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE STATE.
TODAYS CRESTING RIVERS WILL
INCLUDE CAPE FEAR RIVER, LITTLE
RIVER AT MANCHESTER AND
CUMBERLAND COUNTY.
LUMBER RIVER AT LUMBERTON.
NORTHEAST CAPE FEAR RIVER AT
DUPLIN COUNTY.
NEUSE RIVER AT GOLDSBORO AND
WAYNE COUNTY.
TAR RIVER AT GREEN SKPRIL PITT
COUNTY.
NEUSE RIVER AT LENORA COUNTY.
CAPE FEAR RIVER AT FAYETTEVILLE
AND CUMBERLAND COUNTY.
CAPE FEAR RIVER IN PENDER
COUNTY.
AND IT WILL REMAIN AT A MAJOR
FLOOD LEVEL UNTIL THE 20TH.
THE TRENT RIVER IN TRENTON AND
JONES COUNTY.
IT WILL ALSO REMAIN AT A MAJOR
FLOOD LEVEL UNTIL THE 20TH.
THEN THE LUMBER RIVER AT FAIR
BLUFF IN COLUMBUS COUNTY.
WE URGE ALL OF OUR RES DEPUTIES
TO LOG INTO OUR FLOOD INUNDATION
MAPPING AND ALERT NETWORK AT
fiman.nc.gov.
THAT WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT ROADS AND STRUCTURES ARE
GOING TO BE FLOODING.
YOU CAN ALSO SIGN UP TO BE
NOTIFIED BY TEXT OR EMAIL WHEN
THE RIVERS BEGIN TO RISE IN YOUR
AREA.
WE CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED IN
LARGE SCALE SEARCH AND RESCUE
OPERATIONS AS WELL AS LOGISTICAL
RESUPPLY.
WE HAVE RECEIVED OVER 3,000
RESOURCE REQUESTS IN THE LAST
NINE DAYS FROM OUR COUNTY
PARTNERS AND WE CONTINUE TO PUSH
OUT RESOURCES AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE BOTH BY LAND AND BY
AIR.
THERE ARE NOW FOUR MASS FEEDING
KITCHENS OPERATING IN
WASHINGTON, NEW BERN, LUMBERTON.
WE ANTICIPATE HAVING FOUR MORE
OPERATING SHORTLY.
SPECIAL THANKS TO OUR
OUTSTANDING VOLUNTEERS FROM THE
AMERICAN RED CROSS, THE NORTH
CAROLINA BAPTIST MEN, AND THE
SALVATION ARMY FOR MAKING THESE
HOT MEALS POSSIBLE.
SHELTERS DO REMAIN A TOP
PRIORITY AND WE'RE ENGAGED IN
MASS SHELTERING OPERATIONS WITH
APPROXIMATELY 10,000 SHELTER
OCCUPANTS.
WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL
PARTNERS TO DEVELOP AN OVERALL
RECOVERY STRATEGY.
AS A REMINDER IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOTE THAT ALL 911 CENTERS ARE
OPERATIONAL.
WHEN YOU CALL YOU MAY BE
ANSWERED FROM A 911 CENTER IN
ANOTHER COUNTY BUT RESPONDERS
WILL BE DISPATCHED TO YOUR
COUNTY AS NORMAL RIGHT FROM YOUR
OWN COUNTY.
THIS IS HOW THE 911 BACK UP
CENTER WORKS.
I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ALL OF
OUR FEDERAL, STATE, VOLUNTEER,
AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS.
ESPECIALLY THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR
LOCAL PARTNERS.
I ALSO WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY
TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF YOUR
LOCAL OFFICIAL EMPHASIS THEY
TELL YOU TO EVACUATE FROM A
RIVERBANK FLOODING OVER MAKE
SURE YOU FOLLOW WHAT THEY TELL
YOU TO DO AND ALSO STAY IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR LOCAL MEDIA FOR
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK BRET LONG
FOR BEING HERE WITH HIS TEAM TO
SUPPORT US.
WE APPRECIATE IT SIR.
AND ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR YOUR
SUPPORT OF THE NORTH CAROLINA
EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM.
>> THANK YOU, MR. DIRECTOR.
SECRETARY JIM TROGDAN.
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.
I'M JIM TROGDAN THE SECRETARY OF
TRANSPORTATION.
ON INTERSTATES WE HAVE TWO MAJOR
INTERSTATES STILL CLOSED I-40
AND I-95 IN 19 SEPARATE
LOCATIONS.
AND ON US ROUTES 93 LOCATIONS
THAT ARE CLOSED.
AS ROADS ARE CLEARING IN THE
NORTH EASTERN PART OF OUR STATE
THEY ARE ALSO FLOODING IN THE
PIEDMONT.
YOU SEE THE MAP BEFORE YOU HOW
THE BLACK DOTS ARE MOVING A
LITTLE WESTWARD.
WE ANTICIPATED THAT THAT IS DUE
TO THE FLOODING FROM THE RAIN
EVENT FROM FLORENCE THAT HAS
MOVED OUT OF THE STATE.
SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE WILL
STABILIZE OVER THE NEXT FEW
DAYS.
WE HAVE PUSHED 12 ADDITIONAL
CREWS INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES
PRIMARILY FOCUSSED ON DEBRIS
SKPROFL ROAD REPAIR
CAPABILITIES.
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO WORKING
SINCE SUNDAY CONTINGENCY PLANS
IN CASE OUR ROUTES DUE TO THE
RIVER FLOODING THAT WILL CREST
LATER THIS WEEK.
CONTINGENCY TO SUPPORT
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEING ABLE
TO GO INTO NEW HANOVER AND
BRUNSWICK AND THOSE SOUTHERN
COUNTIES.
OUR FERRIES ARE GOING BACK TO
REESTABLISH SERVICE FOR FIRST
RESPONDERS AND LOGISTICS SUPPORT
ONLY FROM FORT FISHER DOWN TO
SOUTH PORT.
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO AND YOU SEE
ON THE SLIDE TO YOUR LEFT WE
HAVE REQUESTED THE MARINE VESSEL
CAPE RAY WHICH IS COMING OFF OF
A MISSION IN FLORIDA TO BE
AVAILABLE TO US TO COME TO THE
PORT OF MOREHEAD.
THIS VESSEL CAN HANDLE HUNDREDS
OF LARGE AND HEAVY VEHICLES
WHILE IT RESUPPLIES OF FUELS AND
HEAVY MATERIALS.
BY TOMORROW WE'LL BE ABLE TO
SUPPORT THIS VESSEL AND IT CAN
MOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF GOODS AND
SERVICES DOWN INTO WILMINGTON IN
CASE OUR PRIMARY ROUTES THAT
WE'RE SERVICING THOSE AREAS ARE
CLOSED BY RIVER FLOODING.
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SHOW OUR
APPRECIATION FOR OUR PARTNERS
HELPING US GET THE PORTS OPEN,
SUPPORTING THIS REQUEST FOR THE
MARINE VESSEL CAPE RAY.
THE COAST GUARD, U.S. ARMY CORPS
OF ENGINEERS HAVE DONE AN
EXCELLENT JOB IN HELPING US GET
OUR CHANNELS REESTABLISHED INTO
OUR MAJOR PORTS.
ALSO USDOT AND MARITIME
ADMINISTRATION FOR ALLOWING US
TO CONSIDER THIS.
WE'RE IN THE FINAL STEPS OF
PLANNING FOR THIS VESSEL.
AND AS SOON AS WE GET THE
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE RELEASED
FROM ITS PREVIOUS MISSION WE'LL
BE ABLE TO BRING IT INTO
MOOREHEAD CITY.
PLEASE DO NOT RETURN YET, THE
TRAVEL CONDITIONS ARE MUCH TO
RISKY FOR OUR CITIZENS.
THE ROUTE THAT IS WE HAVE ONLY
SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS.
THEY ARE NOT SAFE ROUTES, THEY
HAVE RISKS OF THEIR OWN.
BUT THEY ARE CRITICAL FOR US TO
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE RESPONSE
TO THIS EVENT.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, JIM.
COLONEL GLENN McNEIL.
>> THE SAFETY OF OUR MOTOR AND
PUBLIC REMAINS OUR PRIORITY.
WE CONTINUE TO SERVE RESOURCES
AND MANPOWER TO SUPPORT LAW
ENFORCEMENT IN THE IMPACTED
AREAS.
TRAVEL IN THESE AREAS IS STILL
VERY DANGEROUS.
THERE ARE NO SAFE ROUTES IN AND
OUT OF THE EFFECTED AREAS LIKE
WAS PREVIOUSLY STATED.
SINCE OUR LAST BRIEFING OVER THE
LAST 24 HOURS OR TROOPERS HAVE
RESPONDED TO 126 COLLISIONS AND
370 CALLS FOR SERVICE IN OUR
TROOP A AND TROOP B AREAS.
THESE ARE THE TROOPS THAT
ENCOMPASS THE MOST EFFECTED
STORM AREAS.
WE CONTINUE TO URGE MOTORISTS DO
NOT TRY AND CROSS FLOODED
ROADWAYS.
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A
FLOODED ROADWAY SCENARIO CLIMB
OUT OF THE WINDOW IF YOUR
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS STILL
OPERATIONAL.
IF NOT, WAIT UNTIL THE VEHICLE
BEGINS TO PARTIALLY FILL WITH
WATER AND OPEN THE DOOR TO EXIT.
IF YOU CANNOT EXIT THE VEHICLE
AND YOU NEED TO BUST OUT A
WINDOW WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIGHT
AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO BUST OUT
THE TOP LEFT AND TOP RIGHT
PORTION OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD
THEN SAFELY EXIT THE VEHICLE
IF YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL INTO THESE
AREAS OR LEAVE YOUR HOME IF YOU
CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE AREA WE'RE
ASKING EVERYONE TO PLEASE VISIT
drivenc.gov AND TO AVOID THE
RUMORS BEING CIRCULATED THAT
SOME OF THESE ROADWAYS ARE ABOUT
TO OPEN.
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE.
SO PLEASE STAY TUNED TO YOUR
LOCAL MEDIA AND ALSO VISIT
drivenc.gov TO VERIFY THE ROAD
ROUTE YOU PLAN TO TAKE.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, COLONEL.
DR. MANDY COHEN.
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.
SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES.
I START MY UPDATE TODAY WITH A
REQUEST.
WE KNOW THAT THIS STORM IS GOING
TO BE A MARATHON AND RECOVERING
FROM THIS STORM WILL BE A
MARATHON NOT A SPRINT.
AND SO TODAY WE ARE REQUESTING
FOR NURSES WHO MAY BE VOLUNTEER
TO RAISE THEIR HAND.
IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL NURSE WE
WOULD ASK THAT YOU REGISTER WITH
THE RED CROSS.
GO TO redcross.org/ENC IF YOU'RE
A GROUP OF NURSES COMING FROM AN
ORGANIZATION THAT CAN DEPLOY AS
A TEAM WE ASK THAT YOU REGISTER
WITH THE STATE ONLINE
nctrainingexerciseresponse
managementsystem.ncem.org/TRS
THIS IS ALL ON THE HHS WEBSITE.
BUT AGAIN TODAY OUR REQUEST IS
FOR NURSES WHO MAY BE ABLE TO
VOLUNTEER TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS
IN RECOVERING FROM THE
HURRICANE.
WE CONTINUE TO PUT IN PLACE AS
MUCH FLEXIBILITY FROM OUR
PROGRAM AS WE CAN GOING FORWARD.
PEOPLE IN THE FOOD AND NUTRITION
SERVICE PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO
PURCHASE HOT FOOD FROM
AUTHORIZED REALTORS USING THEIR
EBT CARDS.
THIS CHANGE APPLIES TO THE
ENTIRE STATE AND IS ACTIVATED
UNTIL THE END OF OCTOBER.
ADDITIONALLY FAMILIES FROM OUR
PROGRAM WILL HAVE AN EXTRA
MONTH OF BENEFITS LOADED ON TO
THEIR CARDS AUTOMATICALLY TO
ALLOW OUR MOMS AND KIDS
CONTINUAL ACCESS TO HEALTHY
FOOD.
WE ALSO PUT ADDITIONAL
FLEXIBILITY IN OUR MEDICARE
PROGRAM SO PEOPLE CAN GET CARE
EASIER AND DOCTORS CAN PROVIDE
THAT DIRECT CARE.
WE CONTINUE TO HEAD UP OUR FOUR
MEDICAL SHELTERS, WE HAVE OUR
DISASTER HOTLINE AVAILABLE FOR
24-HOUR CRISIS COUNSELING.
THAT NUMBER IS 1-800-985-5980.
WE KNOW DISASTERS ARE STRESSFUL
AND THIS HOT LINE IS A PLACE
24 HOURS A DAY WHERE YOU CAN GET
CONNECTED TO SERVICES OR JUST
TALK.
KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE AND HELP
IS AVAILABLE.
1-800-985-5990.
AND LET ME END WITH A FEW HEALTH
AND SAFETY ADVICE, PLEASE DO NOT
DRIVE OR WALK THROUGH STANDING
OR MOVING WATER.
TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.
IF YOU HAVE FLOODING TO YOUR
HOME BE VERY CAREFUL TOUCHING
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT.
IF YOU DO LOSE POWER DO NOT USE
A GAS POWERED GENERATOR INSIDE
ENCLOSED SPACES FOR THREAT OF
CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING.
AND LASTLY RELATED TO FOOD THROW
AWAY ANY FOOD THAT MAY HAVE COME
IN CONTACTED WITH FLOOD WATERS
OR NOT BEEN REFRIGERATED
PROPERLY.
THANKS AGAIN AND BE SAFE.
>> THANK YOU, GOVERNOR.
SO FOLKS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO GET OUT OF D.C. BE ON
THE GROUND AND MAKE SURE WE'RE
GIVING THE GOOD GOVERNOR, MIKE
AND HIS TEAM EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO HELP NORTH CAROLINA OVERCOME
THIS HIT AS WELL AS SOUTH
CAROLINA AND OTHERS.
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH WHERE WE
ARE BUT I KNOW WE HAVE A LONG
WAY TO GO BECAUSE THIS EVENT IS
NOT OVER.
I THINK THE NEXT 48 HOURS WILL
BE INCREDIBLY CRITICAL.
WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO HELP THE GOVERNOR AND HIS
TEAM.
WE REALIZE WE HAVE A LOT OF
PEOPLE OUT THERE IN SHELTERS AND
WE REALIZE THERE WAS A LOT OF
DISPLACED FOLKS.
SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
EACH AND EVERYDAY AS PROGRESS IS
MADE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR
THE WATER TO RECEDE AS THE
GOVERNOR WAS PUSHING FORWARD
SOME OF THESE RIVERS HAVEN'T
CRESTED YET WHICH IS INCREDIBLY
FRUSTRATING NOT ONLY TO YOU
WANTING TO GO HOME BUT TO OUR
PARTNERS WHO WANT TO GET IN AND
FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
AS THE WATER RECEDES AND THE
SAFETY, SEARCH, AND RESCUE
MISSION COMES TO AN END WE'LL BE
FOCUSSING ON OTHER CRITICAL
LIFELINES SUCH AS FIXING THE
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, HELPING
MR. TROGDAN DO THAT.
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET THE ROADS
BACK OPEN TO FULLY GET THE POWER
BACK ON SO PRIVATE INDUSTRY CAN
GET THE POWER ON.
IF WE GET THE POWER ON WE SOLVE
95% OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE
PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE.
WE ALSO KNOW WE'LL BE DEALING
WITH A LOT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE,
AGRICULTURAL ISSUES, ALL KINDS
OF THINGS.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH DOWN
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO
OVERCOME AND ALLEVIATE AND
STABILIZE THOSE CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE LIFELINES.
WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING CARE OF
PEOPLE THAT'S PRIORITY NUMBER
ONE.
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS THE
GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD
1-800-621-FEMA.
WE'RE ALSO ASKING YOU TO GO TO
disasterassistance.org WE WANT
TO ACCOMPLISH AS MUCH OF THIS
DIGITALLY AS YOU CAN.
NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE POWER ON,
NOT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO
COMPUTER CAPABILITIES.
YOU CAN ALSO DOWNLOAD OUR FEMA
APP AND IT CAN PROVIDE TIPS THAT
WILL LEAD YOU HOPEFULLY THROUGH
THE RECOVERY BUT ALSO TO
REGISTER.
A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS TOO
FEMA WE REALIZE THIS IS GOING TO
BE A BIG RECOVERY MISSION AND
TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE.
SO WE'RE PREPOSITIONING NOT ONLY
OUR DISASTER ASSISTANCE TEAMS.
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE
ARE PUSHING FORWARD INTO THE
FIELD TO WORK CASE MANAGEMENT TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET INTO THE
COMMUNITIES.
YOU'RE GOING TO START SEEING OUR
PEOPLE GET INTO THE COMMUNITIES
AS SOON AS THEY CAN.
GOING TO COMMUNITY CENTERS AND
SHELTERS AND HELPING PEOPLE
REGISTER FOR ASSISTANCE SO WE
CAN START KICK STARTING
RECOVERY.
THE OTHER MAJOR RECOVERY FEMA
RUNS IS THE NATIONAL FLOOD
INSURANCE PROGRAM.
IF YOU'RE A POLICYHOLDER CALL
YOUR LOCAL INSURANCE AGENT.
WE'LL ALSO BE PUSHING OUT
SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS AND
ADJUSTERS TO HELP THIS PROCESS.
THE GOAL IS TO EXPEDITE THE
ASSISTANCE AS QUICK AND FAST AS
WE CAN.
BUT I'M HERE TO SAY GOVERNOR
COOPER, YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE
DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB AND IF I
COULD MODEL THIS STATE AND TAKE
IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY I WOULD DO
IT.
SO THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, ADMINISTRATOR.
WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR FEMA'S
ASSISTANCE ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE HELPING US HERE ON THE
GROUND AT THE EMERGENCY
OPERATIONS CENTER.
QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF US UP ON
THE STAGE?
>> THERE ARE DOZENS MAYBE A
COUPLE HUNDRED AMBULANCES
SITTING IN GARNER DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THEY HAVE DONE ANYTHING
YET.
IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE
NEEDED, DID WE JUST HAVE TOO
MUCH, WERE THEY STAGED IN THE
WRONG PLACE, IF SOMEONE CAN
SPEAK TO THAT?
>> I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF US
CAN VERIFY RIGHT NOW WHOSE
AMBULANCES THEY ARE.
OH THAT I THEIR FEMAS.
THEN THAT'S THE NATIONAL
CONTRACT WE ROLL.
THAT'S A PREPOSITIONED ASSET TO
MAKE SURE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
THERE'S LARGE SCALE EVACUATIONS
OF HOSPITALS OR ASSISTED LIVING
FACILITIES WE MOBILIZE A MASSIVE
AMOUNT OF AMBULANCES INTO THE
STATE TO SUPPORT THAT MISSION.
LUCKILY WE'RE NOT HAVING TO USE
THEM AT THIS POINT.
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND STUFF
THAT'S STAGE AND HAD READY TO GO
BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW HOW BAD
THESE THINGS WILL BE.
AND IT'S A GUESSING GAME UNTIL
FLORENCE FULLY EXITS THE AREA.
GOOD QUESTION, THANK YOU.
>> GARY ROBERTSON, AP.
ABOUT SOME WATER INFRASTRUCTURE
ISSUES COULD YOU TALK ABOUT
EVALUATIONS OF DAMS HOW THAT'S
GOING NO TERMS OF GETTING AN
UPDATE ON THAT.
AND ALSO ON WASTE WATER
TREATMENT PLANTS.
HAVE THERE BEEN, HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE FAILURES OF THOSE
SYSTEMS AND WHAT KIND OF DANGERS
MAY THEY HAVE TO PEOPLE?
>> THE DAMS APPEAR TO BE HOLDING
AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH
DEQ TO HAVE A FLY OVER OF DAMS
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BEING
LOOKED AT AND ANALYZED AND WHAT
THE WATER LEVELS LOOK LIKE.
SO WE DON'T SEE ANY ISSUES OF
THAT.
WE DID HAVE A SMALL DAM FAILURE
THIS WEEK IN BRUNSWICK COUNTY.
BUT THEE WERE NO HOUSEHOLDS IN
THE INUNDATION MAP AND WHAT WAS
THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION.
WATCHING THAT VERY CAREFULLY, WE
HAVE A WATER SYSTEM FAILURE IN
SOUTH PORT.
BUT WE HAVE PARTS ON THE WAY.
WE THINK THAT WILL BE MITIGATED
SHORTLY.
WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT OTHER WATER
SYSTEMS AS THE RIVERS BEGIN TO
CREST.
SO EVERYBODY IS WATCHING THAT
CLOSELY AS WELL.
WE HAVE SOME EQUIPMENT ON
STANDBY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU HAVE A WATER SYSTEM FAIL
TOTALLY THAT'S A BIG ISSUE.
SO WE'RE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD ANY
SIGNIFICANT WATER SYSTEMS
TOTALLY FAIL YET.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I DO KNOW
THAT JONES COUNTY WAS HAVING
SOME ISSUES BUT CRAVEN COUNTY
HAD INTERCONNECTS WITH JONES.
SO THEY TURNED ON THOSE
INTERCONNECTS AND MAINTAINED THE
WATER SYSTEMS.
SO THINGS ARE WORKING BACK UP.
PLANTS ARE WORKING.
NO MAJOR ISSUES.
>> AMY ELLIOT, WITH SPECTRUM
NEWS.
I KNOW A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO WE
WERE HEARING ABOUT SEVERAL
HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ABOUT PRICE
GOUGING.
DO WE HAVE AN UPDATE TO THAT
NUMBER AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN
PARTICULAR PEOPLE NEED TO BE
AWARE OF IF SO?
>> I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE TO THE
NUMBER.
YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN GO TO
8775-NO SCAM TO REPORT PRICE
GOUGING.
OUR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE HAS
REALLY HELPED OUT.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL
BUSINESSES HAVE PITCHED IN TO
HELP.
SO MOST OF THE BUSINESS
COMMUNITY IS DOING GREAT WORK
RIGHT NOW.
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU'LL
HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL VIOLENT
THE PRICE GOUGING LAW.
WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO REPORT
THEM.
I KNOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS
INVESTIGATING SOME OF THEM, GAS
PRICES BEING ONE.
>> WANTED TO JUST GET A LITTLE
BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE MEDICAL
SHELTERS.
HOW MANY FOLKS DO YOU HAVE THERE
AND YOU MENTIONED TO ME EARLIER
THIS WEEKEND, DR. COHEN, THAT
PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A FIFTH
SHELTER OPENED.
WHAT'S THE STATUS THERE?
>> THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
WE HAVE FOUR SHELTERS OPEN RIGHT
NOW AND HAVE A LOT OF BED
AVAILABILITY.
SO RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT BELIEVE
WE HAVE A 50 SHELTER.
I CAN GET YOU THOSE EXACT
NUMBERS.
BUT WE'RE SEEING ABOUT 75%
OCCUPANCY IN EACH OF THOSE.
THANK YOU.
>> I KNOW WE'RE STILL IN
RECOVERY MODE.
BUT I'M SURE ALSO SOME THOUGHTS
HAVE SPUN FORWARD TO REBUILDING.
AND I WONDER MR. LONG, WITH YOU
HERE, WHAT ARE WE OR CAN WE DO
DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME GIVEN THAT
WE HAVE HAD MATTHEW AND FLOYD.
IS THERE ANY THINKING LONG TERM
IN HOW WE REACT TO THESE STORMS
AND HOW AND WHERE WE REBUILD?
>> WE WANT TO BE SMARTER.
WE WANT TO PLAN THIS IN A WAY
THAT WE GET PEOPLE BACK INTO
HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
THIS STORM HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT
ON THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE
HOUSING THAT WE HAVE HERE IN
NORTH CAROLINA AND ALL ACROSS
OUR STATE FOR THAT MATTER.
WE WERE TALKING TO ADMINISTRATOR
LONG THIS MORNING ABOUT A NUMBER
OF OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE THAT
COULD SPEED UP THIS PROCESS.
AND I MIGHT LET HIM SAY A WORD
OR TWO ABOUT THAT.
>> WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN HAVING
CONVERSATIONS AND THE GOVERNOR
HAS BEEN EXPRESSING HIS IDEAS ON
OUTCOME DRIVEN RECOVERY THAT WE
HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR AND ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH IN RECOVERY IS THAT
RECOVERY IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
WHEN IT COMES DOWN FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO CUT THROUGH THAT
COMPLEXITY SUCH AS EXPEDITING
MONEY OUT INTO THE FIELD TO FIX
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SEVERAL
THINGS.
WE ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES,
THERE'S A LOT OF TOOLS IN THE
TOOLBOX.
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AND SIT
DOWN AND WE'LL BE PREPLANNING
MOVING FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNOR
AND HIS STAFF ON WHAT ARE THE
OUTCOMES THAT YOU WANT TO
ACHIEVE.
I'M A BIG FAN OF DOING IT RIGHT.
LET'S DON'T REBUILD TO THE
PREDISASTER STANDARD TO SEE IT
BLOWING OUT AGAIN.
WE'RE GOING TO PUSH FORWARD AND
HELP THE GOVERNOR MAKE SURE THAT
WE GET OVER THIS AND DO IT
RIGHT.
>> AND NOT ONLY HOUSING BUT OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, OUR
BRIDGES, OUR WATER SYSTEMS.
WE WANT TO TRY TO PULL IN AS
MANY FEDERAL RESOURCES AS WE
POSSIBLY CAN.
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS AND MEMBERS OF OUR
STATE LEGISLATURE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE
REBUILDING PROJECT.
WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT.
>> GOVERNOR, YOU MET WITH
ADMINISTRATOR LONG TODAY.
IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY
YOU TOLD HIM OR HIS STAFF THAT
YOU NEED OR THAT YOU FEEL LIKE
HAS NOT MET THE EXPECTATIONS OF
THE STATE?
>> RIGHT NOW FEMA IS GIVING US
WHAT WE NEED.
THEY ARE BEGINNING TO GET THEIR
PEOPLE OUT ACROSS THE STATE
VERY DIFFICULT TO ENTER RIGHT
NOW.
ADMINISTRATOR LONG AND I ARE
GOING TO GO DOWN TO WILMINGTON
TODAY.
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE.
THESE NEXT 48 HOURS ARE GOING TO
BE CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT AS
THESE RIVERS RISE WE CONTINUE TO
FOCUS ON SAVING LIVES.
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BOTH
THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND THE
LONG TERM FUTURE.
>> LAUREN HARSH WITH THE NEWS
AND OBSERVER.
LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP
ANNOUNCED HE WAS PLANNING TO
COMING TO NORTH CAROLINA.
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING HE'S COMING
TO SOUTH CAROLINA TOMORROW?
IS HE ALSO MAKING HIS WAY TO
NORTH CAROLINA TOMORROW AND WHEN
HE COMES ARE YOU PLANNING ON
MEETING WITH HIM?
>> THE ANSWER, WE BELIEVE THAT
THERE ARE PLANS FOR HIM TO COME
TOMORROW.
I KNOW THAT PLANS LIKE THAT ARE
FLUID AND YES I WOULD MEET WITH
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES WHEN HE COMES TO NORTH
CAROLINA.
ALL RIGHT.
211 FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS
INFORMATION.
THANK YOU TO MONICA McGEE FOR
AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE.
888-892-1162 FOR PEOPLE DEAF AND
HARD OF HEARING FOR PEOPLE WHO
NEED THAT NONEMERGENCY
INFORMATION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE
LATEST ON FLORENCE FROM NORTH
CAROLINA.
THE GOVERNOR THERE AND OTHER
OFFICIALS.
26 DEATHS BLAMED ON THE STORM IN
NORTH CAROLINA.
STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
SHELTERS ABOUT 10,000 ACCORDING
TO THE GOVERNOR.
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT UP SOMETHING
WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT.
IT WAS THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE
TO AGRICULTURE THERE WAS A LOT
OF PRODUCT IN THE FIELD TOBACCO,
COTTON, ALL OF THAT WOULD BE
DESTROYED.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE
IMPLICATIONS AND IMPACT OF THIS
STORM FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS TO
COME THAT'S PART OF THE IMPACT
AND PART OF THE PRICE TAG.
>> FOR SURE.
WE DID GET AN UPDATE FROM THE
U.S. COAST GUARD ON SOME OF THE
NUMBERS AND THE RESOURCES THAT
THEY HAVE APPLIED TO THE
RECOVERY FROM HURRICANE
FLORENCE.
THE COAST GUARD HAS RESCUED 426
PEOPLE AND 234 PETS SINCE THE
HURRICANE NOW STORM BEGAN.
THERE ARE 26 TEAMS DEPLOYED TO
THE NORTH CAROLINA REGION.
COMPRISED OF ABOUT 116 PEOPLE.
SO THEY ARE STILL IN THE MIDST
OF DOING THIS SEARCH AND
RECOVERY.
IN FACT THEY GO ON TO SAY THE
SEARCH AND RECOVERY MISSION
REMAINS THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IMPACTED BY
HURRICANE FLORENCE.
>> PART OF THE REASON IS THAT
THOUGH THE STORM IS LONG GONE
IT'S SORT OF UP THIS WAY NOW
WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS ARE THE
RIVERS AND CREEKS RISING.
SO PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN
THEIR HOMES AND THE WATER GOT UP
TO THEIR FRONT DOOR AND THEY
THINK IT'S OKAY TO GO BACK THEN
IT'S NOT BECAUSE FLOODING IS
STILL, YOU'RE STILL AT RISK OF
FLOODING.
>> YOU MAY HAVE ALSO NOTICED
WHILE WE WERE LISTENING TO THAT
UPDATE FROM THE GOVERNOR WE HAD
A SMALL BOX SHOWING THE RIVAL OF
POLAND'S PRESIDENT -- THE
ARRIVAL OF POLAND'S PRESIDENT AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.
WE'LL BE CHECKING IN A LITTLE
BIT LATER TO SEE WHAT THE
PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE IS AS HE
HOSTS THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
BREAK AND COME BACK WITH A WHOLE
LOT
