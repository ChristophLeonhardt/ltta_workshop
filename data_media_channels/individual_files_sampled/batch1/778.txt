at the start of the Security Council meeting a moment of silence for those protesters shot dead by Israeli snipers US ambassador nikki Haley was not in her place as the others stood on their feet and when the meeting started she took a very different tone from other members of the council the u.s. is closest allies questioning the volume of life are used by Israel calling for an independent inquiry and calling for restraint but the US ambassador blamed Iran for the region's troubles and insisted Israel had shown restraint I asked my colleagues here in the Security Council who among us would accept this type of activity on your border no one would no country in this chamber would act with more restraint then Israel has Bolivia's ambassador read out the names of some of the dead yes sir Mohammad Ahsan Haque can use Allah and he then addressed the Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour leave the school bus I'm sorry that for 70 years the promise of the creation of the State of Palestine has not been fulfilled the international community has failed you when ambassador Manso later addressed reporters he seemed close to tears although it is Nakba day but I am proud to be a Palestinian proud to be Palestinian belonging to those heroes in Gaza to those heroes in Jerusalem to those heroes in the occupied Palestinian territory the Palestinian ambassador was surrounded by the other Arab ambassadors at the UN but when he spoke his Israeli counterpart was alone apart from a photograph he said justified his Army's actions international law says that the use of lethal force needs to be proportionate how can you say that using snipers with precision equipment against unarmed people is proportionate and very happy you thinning so close to me because you can look at this picture if we hadn't the IDF protecting our border thousands of Palestinians would have crossed the fence yesterday they wait you ask the questions they wouldn't have stopped at the fence that's right to break the fence and cross the fence Kuwait's is circulating a draft Security Council resolution calling for international protection for the Palestinians that though is unlikely to go anywhere because the US has veto power more important I think is a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday it has the power to set up an independent investigation James BAE's al-jazeera of the United Nations
