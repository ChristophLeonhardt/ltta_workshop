the minute you take a drug drink alcohol smoke a cigarette if those are your poison when you get a like on social media all of those experiences produce dopamine which is a chemical that's associated with pleasure when someone likes an Instagram post or any Content that you share it's a little bit like taking a drug as far as your brain is concerned it's a very similar experience now the reason why is because it's not guaranteed that you're going to get likes on your posts and it's the unpredictability of that process that makes it so addictive if you knew that every time you posted something you'd get a hundred likes it would become boring really fast one of the problems with Instagram is everyone presents the very best versions of their lives so you can curate Instagram you can take it a hundred thousand shots if you want to before you actually share anything what that means is every time you look at someone's feed you're getting only the very best aspects of their lives which makes you feel like your life in comparison with all its messiness probably isn't as good seeing the best version of everyone else's life makes you feel deprived
