England erupted in delight and cheer last night when our football team beat Colombia in a penalty shootout the BBC reports that the game was seen by twenty three point six million viewers on ITV with a further 3.3 million viewing it online via ITV hub and Twitter was aflame with ecstatic emojis and cheers for England and while the whole country seems optimistic I feel pessimistic because I can't help but think that the interest and the passion invested in the England Football team is misdirected patriotism my critics would say that not everything should be political and that people need time off to enjoy something outside of politics and I wouldn't disagree I mean my whole life is politics so I understand the need for getting away but this isn't really the issue it's not that I think football should be political but that people who follow the football religiously are so often not doing enough for their country in the first place obviously there's groups of football lads who have brags it marches across the country and that's great but for the most part the millions of viewers who tuned in to watch England win last night are not doing anything to protect the country they're cheering more people watch the football last night than who voted breaks it more people watch the football last night the new have ever put a cross in the box for a political party that stands up for British values and I don't think it's malicious I don't for a moment think that football fans are too lazy to care for their country I don't think that their support for the England Football team but they're ignorant of England's serious cultural and economic problems is a result of their own hatred stupidity or shortsightedness or something in fact I think it's a result of a ruling elite knowing how to control its people the misdirected patriotism of the masses in England is a result of decades of fear-mongering and indoctrination when a population is told not to express their patriotism or face accusations of racism and taught in schools that our country's history is one of pillaging rape and colonialism then the World Cup the Queen's Jubilee and even the final of Britain's Got Talent become the only acceptable or state-sanctioned forms a it is Imai called racist if you celebrate st. George's Day or you might get called xenophobic if you join a political party that protects British values but you definitely won't be attacked if you celebrate with millions of other Englishmen and women when we win a game in the World Cup this is the disdain of the ruling elite this is their trick they know that to achieve their aim they must first attack the common masses and then they must distract the common masses just imagine the changes that could be made if this passion for football could be translated into political activity the good that could be done if man across this country stood up bravely and said enough is enough but that at least for now might just be a dream because the effects of the long march through the institution's still maintain a stranglehold over the average Englishman and it's not a stranglehold that's easily broken if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
