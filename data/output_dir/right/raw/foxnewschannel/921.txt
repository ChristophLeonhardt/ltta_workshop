1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:01,338
WE ARE LEADING WITH THE

2
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:03,106
SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS BUT THE

3
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:05,275
DATA ARE IN THIS REPORT AND

4
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:06,176
WORTH READING.

5
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:07,410
TOM FITTON GOOD TO SEE YOU.

6
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,378
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

7
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:11,081
TOM TOM THE FORMER ASSISTANT

8
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:12,515
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI JOINS US

9
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,484
TONIGHT.  MR. HOSKO, THANKS

10
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:15,251
FOR COMING ON.

11
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,686
I WANT TO READ TO YOU

12
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,054
EXCHANGE BETWEEN FBI

13
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:19,789
EMPLOYEES ON ELECTION NIGHT.

14
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,725
I CAN'T STOP CRYING SAYS

15
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:22,025
ONE.

16
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:22,993
I'M NUMB SAYS ANOTHER.

17
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:24,361
I'M SO STRESSED ABOUT WHAT I

18
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,462
COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

19
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:27,464
I THINK THE FBI'S INFLUENCE

20
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:28,798
MAY HAVE HAD AN EFFECT IN

21
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:29,099
THIS.

22
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,234
I DON'T KNOW, WE BROKE THE

23
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,836
MEANING THE MOMENTUM OF THE

24
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:33,903
HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

25
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:36,006
HERE HAVE YOU UNNAMED FBI

26
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,140
EMPLOYEES LAMENTING THE FACT

27
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,708
THAT THEY COULDN'T HELP A

28
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,276
SPECIFIC POLITICAL CANDIDATE

29
00:00:40,276 --> 00:00:40,944
BECOME PRESIDENT.

30
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,178
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO

31
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:42,479
THAT?

32
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,114
>> YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF

33
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:45,148
SICKENS ME, TUCKER.

34
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:46,783
I THINK THOSE EMPLOYEES,

35
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:49,619
THOSE MENTIONED IN THIS

36
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,187
REPORT HAVE FAILED THE

37
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:51,621
ORGANIZATION.

38
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:52,789
THEY HAVE FAILED OUT

39
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:53,823
EXPECTATION OF THE HIGHEST

40
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:58,128
DEGREE OF PROFESSIONALISM.

41
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:01,031
THEY HAVE LEFT THEIR BIASES

42
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:01,865
INTERSECT WITH AN

43
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:02,298
INVESTIGATION.

44
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:03,566
SO IT'S DEEPLY CONCERNING.

45
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:07,237
AND I THINK CHRISTOPHER WRAY

46
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,304
ACTION ON THAT.

47
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:08,938
>> Tucker: I'M CONFUSED

48
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:09,906
THOUGH AS TO WHY WE DON'T

49
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,107
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHO

50
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:12,542
THESE PEOPLE ARE AND WHAT

51
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,176
THEY ARE DOING NOW.

52
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:14,811
I MEAN, IF YOU WRITE IN AN

53
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:16,546
EMAIL AND APPARENTLY THIS IS

54
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:18,715
REAL, WE BROKE THE MOMENTUM,

55
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:19,549
WE HURT HILLARY.

56
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,884
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT

57
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,285
I'M HEART-BROKEN THAT SHE

58
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:23,820
LOST, DON'T I HAVE, AS A

59
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,721
CITIZEN, A RIGHT TO KNOW

60
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,722
WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW?

61
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:26,656
WHO ARE YOU?

62
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:27,357
WHO WROTE THAT?

63
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:28,825
THESE ARE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.

64
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:30,794
>> WELL, THEY ARE PUBLIC

65
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:31,161
EMPLOYEES.

66
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,462
THERE IS ALSO A PUBLIC

67
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:32,796
PROCESS.

68
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:34,364
THERE IS AN INTERNAL

69
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:35,131
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS.

70
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,366
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH A NUMBER

71
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:37,333
OF EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN

72
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,601
REFERRED TO THAT PROCESS.

73
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:40,070
AND SO, JUST LIKE THE

74
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,704
DIRECTOR SAYS IN HIS PRESS

75
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:42,739
CONFERENCE TODAY, IS HE

76
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,207
GOING TO HOLD OFF ON THAT

77
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,376
AND FOLLOW STANDING POLICY

78
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:47,544
UNTIL THOSE ISSUES ARE

79
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:47,911
RESOLVED.

80
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:49,979
NOW, WE MAY LEARN WHO THAT

81
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,714
IS LATER, QUITE CLEARLY WE

82
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:54,017
HAVE SEEN AND HEARD SOME OF

83
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:55,552
THE TEXT MESSAGES AND IM'S

84
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:56,619
BACK AND FORTH WITH STRZOK

85
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:57,187
AND PAGE.

86
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:58,455
THEY ARE VERY, VERY

87
00:01:58,455 --> 00:01:59,389
CONCERNING.

88
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:00,123
AND, TRUST ME.

89
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,658
THE WORKFORCE IS HURT BY

90
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:03,193
THAT AND THEY ARE OFFENDED

91
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:04,260
BY IT.

92
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,761
>> Tucker: YEAH.

93
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,428
ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE

94
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:06,329
INVESTIGATED BY STRZOK AND

95
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,131
PAGE AND THE REST OF THESE

96
00:02:08,131 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE GROUNDS FOR REOPENING
