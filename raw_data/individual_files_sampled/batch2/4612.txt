Frank let me give you a hypothetical let's say that yesterday our Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for all things Russian was in Helsinki for a meeting with his or her counterpart in Russia and they came out at a press event after that and seemed to take the Russian side in a matter of great perhaps existential importance back home how would that government official be treated and viewed by the government if this were in other words anyone else in our government what mechanisms would be triggered well you know I think that if you looked at it from the context that there were already this litany of behaviors that existed a very good possibility that there would already be an investigation underway that could include everything from the use of National Security Letters to interviews to FISA activity the point being to try to build a case against this individual and if they were to make some kind of a disclosure like that again it would just heighten our awareness that we were on the right track that we were looking at somebody who could be betraying this country I it was that stunning yesterday in terms of the disclosures that were made in terms of the betrayal like Charlie was talking about to this country in terms of the oaths that we all swear to protect and defend the Constitution in this country so yeah it would be another straw on the camel's back so to speak another piece to the puzzle as we were making our way through this investigation that would not bode well for that subject hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
