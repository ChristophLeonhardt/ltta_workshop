00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:02,154
SIDE.

2
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:05,958
HERE IS THE INTERVIEW WITH

3
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:06,325

4
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:09,862
BRET: JOINING US, ADEL

5
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:10,229
AL-JUBEIR.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,399
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,902
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

8
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:19,438
BRET: THERE IS SCEPTICISM AROUND

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,940
THE WORLD, HERE IN WASHINGTON,

10
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,474
ALL OVER OF THE LATEST

11
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:23,709
EXPLANATION ABOUT THE

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,911
DISAPPEARANCE AND DEATH OF JAMAL

13
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:26,679
KHASHOGGI.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,781
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO

15
00:00:28,782 --> 00:00:31,850
LAY OUT THE LATEST EXPLANATION

16
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:38,023
AND HOW YOU CAME TO THIS.

17
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:41,460
>> WE HAD AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME

18
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,429
TO THE CONSULATE, HE WAS

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,731
APPROACHED BY THE SAUDI SECURITY

20
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:46,031
TEAM.

21
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:49,301
THEY TOLD US HE LEFT THE

22
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:58,010
CONSULATE.

23
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,680
THE THEY DISPATCHED A TEAM TO

24
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:02,014
TURKEY.

25
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:06,952
REPORTS WE WERE GETTING FROM

26
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,721
TURKEY, THEY DIRECTED THE PUBLIC

27
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:11,190
PROSECUTOR TO LAUNCH AN

28
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,624
INVESTIGATION WHICH HE DID.

29
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,027
HE DISCOVERED THERE WERE

30
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,028
DISCREPANCIES.

31
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,596
WE DISCOVERED HE WAS KILLED IN

32
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:18,230
THE CONSULATE.

33
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,499
WE DON'T KNOW IN DETAILS HOW.

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,701
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BODY IS.

35
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:25,904
THE PROSECUTOR PUT OUT ORDERS TO

36
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,106
DETAIN 18 INDIVIDUALS FOR

37
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:32,511
QUESTIONING AND POSSIBLY FACING

38
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:32,811
TRIAL.

39
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:35,347
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN A LONG

40
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:36,081
JOURNEY.

41
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:38,183
WE ARE DETERMINED TO UNCOVER

42
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:41,053
EVERY STONE AND FIND OUT ALL THE

43
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:43,122
FACTS AND PUNISH THOSE

44
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:45,824
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MURDER.

45
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:48,027
AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO INSURE

46
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:50,229
THAT THE INFORMATION WE HAVE

47
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,130
WITH INTELLIGENCE IN THE FIELD

48
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:53,332
HAS CHECKS AND BALANCES INTO

49
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,200
SURE THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN

50
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:55,501
AGAIN.

51
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:58,070
BRET: YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW

52
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,972
WHERE THE BODY IS.

53
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:01,306
SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS.

54
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:05,377
WAS IT CHOPPED UP AND

55
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:05,778
DISMEMBERED?

56
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:09,515
>> WE ARE WORK ON THIS WITH OUR

57
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:11,583
TURKISH COLLEAGUES, THE

58
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,685
PROSECUTE YEARS CONTINUING HIS

59
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:14,086
QUESTIONING.

60
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,588
WE ARE INTENT ON UNCOVERING ALL

61
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:19,491
THE FACTS THAT EXIST IN THIS

62
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:20,159
CASE.

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,593
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE

64
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,395
RESPONSIBLE ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT.

65
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:26,999
BRET: WHY DID IT TAKE 18 DAYS

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,436
FOR THE SAUDI STORY GEL?

67
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:32,604
FIRST IT WAS THAT HE WALKED OUT

68
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:33,539
OF THE CONSULATE.

69
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,274
THEN IT WAS SILENCE.

70
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,476
THEN THIS FAILED EXPLANATION

71
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:42,014
MINUS WHERE THE BODY IS, AND WHO

72
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,549
ORDERED IT.

73
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,819
>> WE HAD REPORTS THAT INDICATED

74
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,354
THAT HE LEFT THE CONSULATE.

75
00:02:49,355 --> 00:02:52,724
THEN OUR INVESTIGATING TEAM IN

76
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:55,094
TURKEY DISCOVERED THERE WERE

77
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,628
ELEMENTS THAT CONTRADICTED WHAT

78
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,496
WAS IN THE REPORT.

79
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:59,498
THEN THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WANTS

80
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:03,502
TO DO AN INVESTIGATION AND HE

81
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,703
DETERMINED NAWBLG THERE WAS

82
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:06,705
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THAT WAS

83
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:10,042
CRIMINAL AND AS A CONSEQUENCE --

84
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:12,010
WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE

85
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,145
THIS YOU WANT THE INFORMATION

86
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,013
YOU PUT OUT TO BE AS ACCURATE AS

87
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,348
YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

88
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,450
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT OUT

89
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:20,119
SPECULATION AND HEARSAY AND

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,786
GOSSIP.

91
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:22,888
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME.

92
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,423
YOU LOOK AT THE TIMELINE BETWEEN

93
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:28,060
WHEN THE INCIDENTS WERE

94
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,394
DISCOVERED AND THE REPORT CAME

95
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,396
OUT OF WHAT HAPPENED.

96
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,031
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME AND YOU

97
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:34,233
WANT TO BE CAREFUL.

98
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:37,469
BRET: YOU ARE AN AUTHORITARIAN

99
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:37,870
GOVERNMENT.

100
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:42,674
YOU ARE SAYING THE CROWN PRINCE

101
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,909
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS EVEN

102
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,911
THOUGH THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THIS

103
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,913
15-PERSON TEAM THAT ARE CLOSELY

104
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,948
ALIGNED WITH HIM?

105
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:52,918
>> FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE MEAN IN

106
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,619
THE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT.

107
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,988
WE ARE A MONARCHY.

108
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,359
WE HAVE OUR CHECKS AND BALANCES.

109
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,894
THE INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE THE

110
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:04,830
AUTHORITY THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS

111
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,332
MISTAKE MADE AND COMPOUNDED THE

112
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,001
MISTAKE BY TRYING TO COUCH.

113
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,235
THESE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY

114
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:11,103
HAPPEN.

115
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,038
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE WHO

116
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,873
ARE RESPONSIBLE ARE PUNISHED AND

117
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,975
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PROCEDURES

118
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,311
ARE IN PLACE TO PREVENT IT FROM

119
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:20,979
HAPPENING AGAIN.

120
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,648
SAUDI ARABIA SINCE THE FOUNDING

121
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,084
OF THE MODERN SAUDI STATE WE

122
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:28,854
HAVE NEVER ENGAGED IN SUCH

123
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:29,221
BEHAVIOR.

124
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:32,691
THIS IS AN ABERRATION, IT'S A

125
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:33,959
CRIMINAL ACT AND THOSE

126
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,661
RESPONSIBLE WILL BE PUNISHED.

127
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:38,030
BRET: DID THE CROWN PRINCE KNOW

128
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,698
ANYTHING ABOUT IT IF THERE WERE

129
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,802
PEOPLE CLOSELY TIED TO HIM THAT

130
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:46,305
WERE CLOSELY INVOLVED IN THE

131
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:46,672
OPERATION.

132
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:49,875
>> THERE WERE PICTURES OF SOME

133
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,210
SECURITY OFFICERS IN THE

134
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,644
SECURITY DETAIL FROM TIME TO

135
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:53,312
TIME.

136
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:55,414
BUT THIS IS NORMAL SECURITY,

137
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,816
PEOPLE WHO DEAL IN SECURITY

138
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:59,618
DETAILS ROTATE AMONG THE

139
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:00,719
OFFICIALS.

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,187
HAVING SOMEBODY IN A PICTURE

141
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:05,023
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE CLOSE AT

142
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:05,290
ALL.

143
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,794
THE CROWN PRINCE IS NOT AWARE OF

144
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:09,094
THIS.

145
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:11,163
THIS WAS AN OPERATION THAT WAS A

146
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:11,964
ROGUE OPERATION.

147
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:17,102
THIS WAS AN OPERATION WHERE

148
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,203
INDIVIDUALS ENDED UP [INAUDIBLE]

149
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:20,472
THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEY HAD.

150
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:24,409
THEY TRIED TO COVER UP FOR IT.

151
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,812
BRET WHERE WHAT DO YOU SAY -- DO

152
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:28,914
YOU BELIEVE THAT THE TURKS HAVE

153
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:33,819
AUDIO OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT

154
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,186
CONSULATE?

155
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:35,487
>> I DON'T KNOW.

156
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:37,623
THEY SAID THEY HAVE AUDIO, BUT

157
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:38,724
WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT.

158
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:41,360
AND I DON'T KNOW ANY GOVERNMENT

159
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,428
THAT HAS ACCESS TO THOSE

160
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:44,963
AUDIOTAPES.

161
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,299
BRET: DO YOU BELIEVE THE U.S.

162
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,468
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAS

163
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,436
INTERCEPTS THAT HAS

164
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:54,706
UNDERSTANDING AT A HIGH LEVEL OF

165
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:55,207
THIS OPERATION?

166
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,241
>> I DON'T KNOW.

167
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:58,176
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD US

168
00:05:58,177 --> 00:05:58,844
ABOUT IT.

169
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:02,014
I SEE A LOT OF SPECULATION AND

170
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,583
HEARSAY AND GOSSIP IN THE PRESS.

171
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:06,785
I CAUTION PEOPLE TO LET THE

172
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:07,452
INVESTIGATION UNFOLD.

173
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,721
AND WHEN THE RESULTS COME OUT,

174
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:12,257
WE'LL KNOW THE TRUTH.

175
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:14,693
BRET: YOU UNDERSTAND THE

176
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,028
SCEPTICISM, THAT THIS WAS A

177
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:18,463
FIGHT THAT DEVELOPED IN THE

178
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:21,967
CONSULATE, AND A 0-YEAR-OLD

179
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,803
COLUMNIST -- A 60-YEAR-OLD

180
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:27,939
COLUMNIST WRITER IS GOING TO

181
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,976
RESIST A 15-MEMBER SECURITY TEAM

182
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:32,411
AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

183
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,946
TEAM WAS AN AUTOPSY SPECIALIST.

184
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:36,481
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT.

185
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,784
>> I DON'T BELIEVE ALL 15

186
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:40,118
MEMBERS WERE IN THE CONSULATE

187
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:40,819
WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

188
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,888
WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY

189
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:43,588
INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

190
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,590
WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

191
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,328

THEY WERE A -- HOW THEY WERE

196
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:54,166
ASSEMBLED AND DISPATCHED AND

197
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,667
WHAT HAPPENED CONSEQUENT TO

198
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:56,802
THAT.

199
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:58,804
THE INITIAL RESULTS ARE NOT

200
00:06:58,805 --> 00:06:59,705
CONCLUSIVE.

201
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:01,573
THE INVESTIGATION IS IN ITS

202
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:02,474
EARLY PHASES.

203
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:05,110
WE'LL PURSUE THIS TO THE END TO

204
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,545
UNCOVER THE TRUTH TO MAKE SURE

205
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,113
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED

206
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:10,082
AND WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.

207
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,718
BRET: I'M SURE YOU HEARD

208
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,852
LAWMAKERS SPEAKING OUT.

209
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,121
HERE IS WHAT SENATOR RAND PAUL

210
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:19,091
SAID ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

211
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,959
>> I FEEL CERTAIN THE CROWN

212
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,462
PRINCE WAS INVOLVED AND HE

213
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:25,297
DIRECTED THIS AND WE CAN'T

214
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,099
CONTINUE TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH

215
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,532
HIM.

216
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,102
HE'LL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.

217
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:33,972
SANCTIONS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH.

218
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:36,074
BRET: THERE WERE A LOT OF

219
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:39,945
WASHINGTON LAWMAKERS IN THE SAME

220
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:40,245
BOAT.

221
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,480
HOW DO YOU RESPOND.

222
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,982
>> I FIND IT INTERESTING HOW

223
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,252
SOMEONE 6,000 MILES AWAY CAN

224
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:49,254
HAVE AN OPINION ON THE INCIDENT.

225
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:54,693
THIS IS A JUDGMENT CALL BY

226
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:57,529
SENATOR PAUL BASED ON

227
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,064
SPECULATION.

228
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,799
WITH RESPECT TO THE CONGRESS TO

229
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,901
WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE THE FACTS,

230
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,070
THEN JUDGE THE RESULTS OF THE

231
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,038
FACTS AND TAKE POSITIONS THEN.

232
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,274
BUT NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

233
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:12,677
BEFORE SOMETHING IS CONCLUDE.

234
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,312
THERE IS A PRESUMPTION OF

235
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:16,047
INNOCENCE AND PEOPLE HAVE TURNED

236
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:18,016
IT UPSIDE DOWN UNFORTUNATELY.

237
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:21,386
BRET: ARE YOU WORRIED THAT

238
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,889
SOMETHING IN THIS INVESTIGATION

239
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,891
WILL TURN UP SOMETHING DIFFERENT

240
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:28,059
THAN THE ORIGINAL STORY YOU PUT

241
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,627
OUT NOW?

242
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,629
>> WE PUT OUT THE VERSION WE

243
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,565
HAVE BASED ON THE FACTS WE HAD

244
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,800
AT THE TIME.

245
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,234
WE'LL CONTINUE TO PUT OUT

246
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,303
INFORMATION AS IT BECOMES

247
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:40,739
AVAILABLE AND IT IS CERTIFIED.

248
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,208
WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR WE'LL LEAVE

249
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:49,548
NO STONE UNTURNED.

250
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,483
BRET: KING SALMAN IS STANDING

251
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,585
BEHIND THE CROWN PRINCE ON ALL

252
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:58,023
OF THIS?

253
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:01,693
>> [INAUDIBLE] THE INVESTIGATION

254
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:04,396
TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS AND HOLD

255
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:05,630
THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE

256
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:07,632
AND DETERMINE TO PUT IN PLACE

257
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,835
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

258
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,169
MEASURES IN THE SECURITY

259
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,604
SERVICES TO PREVENT SOMETHING

260
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:14,573
LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

261
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:16,875
BRET: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE

262
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:18,877
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED

263
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:19,644
SURROUNDING THIS?

264
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:22,214
>> THIS IS UP TO THE COURTS TO

265
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:23,448
DECIDE.

266
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,517
THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WILL BRING

267
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:28,453
CHARGES AS THE INVESTIGATION

268
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:28,787
UNFOLDS.

269
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:29,955
THEY WILL BE REFERRED TO THE

270
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:32,657
COURTS AND THE COURTS WILL

271
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:33,091
SENTENCE THEM.

272
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:36,528
BRET: DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE TO

273
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:37,796
THE KHASHOGGI FAMILY?

274
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:40,565
>> YES, THIS IS A TERRIBLE

275
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:43,101
MISTAKE, A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

276
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:44,703
WE FEEL THEIR PAIN.

277
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:50,242
I WISH THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN.

278
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:51,710
UNFORTUNATELY A FEW [INAUDIBLE]

279
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:55,714
WAS MADE AND I ASSURE THOSE

280
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,816
RESPONSIBLE WILL BE HELD

281
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,150
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS.

282
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:01,486
BRET: YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME AS

283
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,154
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S., NOW AS

284
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,623
FOREIGN MINISTER.

285
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:06,424
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THE

286
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:08,493
FUTURE OF THE U.S.-SAUDI

287
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:14,833
RELATIONSHIP AFTER ALL THIS?

288
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,769
>> [INAUDIBLE] GREAT INTERESTS

289
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,372
THAT WE SHARE TOGETHER.

290
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,439
WE HAVE A GREAT TRADE

291
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,007
RELATIONSHIP.

292
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:23,842
WE HAVE SECURITY ISSUES

293
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:25,410
IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF US.

294
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,914
WE WORK CLOSELY ON COMBATING

295
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,316
TERRORISM AND EXTREMISM AND

296
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,618
CONTAINING IRAN'S AGGRESSIVE

297
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,053
POLICIES IN THE REGION.

298
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,355
TRYING TO BRING PEACE TO

299
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:40,258
PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.

300
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,626
THE STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP IS

301
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,261
IMPORTANT FOR BOTH COUNTRIES.

302
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,729
I BELIEVE WHEN THE INVESTIGATION

303
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,699
IS OVER AND THE FACTS ARE

304
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,267
REVEALED, PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS

305
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,469
RESPONSIBLE AND SEE THOSE

306
00:10:51,470 --> 00:00:00,000
INDIVIDUALS PUNISHED, THAT THE
