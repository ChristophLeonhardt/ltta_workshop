we're suffering a lot because of this
draught we had so many animals and we
lost all of them there's nothing left
for us these animals that are left we
are feeding just once a day we're just
trying to keep them alive
we sacrificed our animals that they
should be the first victim rather than
losing our children
in piranha village and across here our
profits agriculture provides 95 percent
of income so when the water dried up and
their livestock and crops died many were
forced to leave
