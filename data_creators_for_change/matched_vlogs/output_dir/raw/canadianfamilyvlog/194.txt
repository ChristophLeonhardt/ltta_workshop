64
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,680

it would just be very stressful kind of

74
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,050
day so I didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was</font>

78
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,360
at the flyers because I didn't want to

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,190
see something really really good deal

80
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,230
