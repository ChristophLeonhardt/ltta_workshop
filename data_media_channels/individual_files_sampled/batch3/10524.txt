German foreign ministers urged the EU to review its policies towards the u.s. in light of Washington's sanctions against a number of foreign States we must adapt our politics to fit the new reality we must take Washington's new attitude into account when formulating our foreign policy this means that Europe must take more responsibility for its own security we have to be ready in case Europe and America go their separate ways where the u.s. crosses red lines we as Europeans must counterbalance as hard as that is it is indispensable that we strengthen European autonomy by creating payment channels that are independent of the United States the European monetary fund and an independent Swift system the global payments network known as Swift is used by 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries it claims political neutrality that has apparently caved into American pressure in the past after Washington dumped the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions Swift had a clear choice cut off Iranian banks from its systems or face an asset freeze travel bans and restrictions on its business in America but the EU has said it's still committed to the Iranian deal without the u.s. we are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran this is why the European Union's updated blocking statute enters into force on the 7th of August to protect EU companies during legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extraterritorial sanctions we believe that it is and it has to be up to the Europeans in this case to decide with whom to trade oh we're now joined by Bijan to have a solely member of the Delian car party who's in Hamburg Germany mr. Stavis early thank you for coming on the program for us now Heiko mass's wordsworth far stronger just a few days ago what does this change in rhetoric tell us well I would be among the first to applaud him if it was more than just a change in rhetoric but so far we have seen little sign of it because he has been talking about in alliance with Canada and European Union countries but if he were to really challenge the US hegemony then he would have to include other European countries such as Russia as well and what's your opinion about the ways out of this crisis suggested by Mars well of course if you could build a new monetary system then you would have a way to challenge the power of the US but that can only be done if you include Russia if you include China and other countries and so far he has not been willing to do that if we were to create an alternative to the Swift payment system I mean first of all is that at all possible and is it possible to do it quickly enough to minimize the financial risks it would be tough because right now most of the transactions in the world are going through the Swift payment system but if you could include major countries then in a short timeline you could at least take some of the transactions off and by doing so could take some of the pressure from countries such as your app and from companies that are doing countries doing business with countries such as Iran what other possible options does the EU have to protect the Iran deal now I don't think there are any options I think the deal is in a very critical phase right now if you look at the situation in Iran then the government is split whether to continue with the deal or whether to renegotiate with other countries or maybe even to restart the nuclear program so I think the European Union is in a bind and it has to consult with its allies such as Russia and China who have been part of that deal do you think the EU will confront the US with physical action and not just words I'm very doubtful on that because as my cherished colleague dieter dim has said Heiko Maas has in the past only been a well-paid prostitute of NATO and I have nothing to add or subtract from that comment so what does this mean for the future of you us-eu relations well if it were to be followed through then we could see a different stage of relations but we are now in a very early stage and my party is of course very much in favor of such realignment you
