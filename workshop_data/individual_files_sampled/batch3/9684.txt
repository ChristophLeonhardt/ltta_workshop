Laura: PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JAMES COMEY ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF LYING OVER "SPYGATE." THAT IS WHAT TRUMP CALLED REPORTS THAT THE F.B.I. HAD AN INFORMANT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. COMEY TWEETED TODAY ATTACKS ON THE F.B.I. AND LYING ABOUT WORK WILL DO LASTING DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY. TRUMP RESPONDED BY SUGGESTING THAT COMEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THE UPCOMING I.G. REPORT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE DID, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE LAWS, THE TREMENDOUS LIES IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIES, THE TREMENDOUS LIES, ALL THAT IS GOING ON, JAMES COMEY HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS NOW. Laura: AMONG THE PROBLEMS ACCORDING TO THE REPORT FROM THE DAILY CALLER THE RANK AND FILE F.B.I. AGENTS WANT TO TESTIFY TO CONGRESS THAT POLITICS AND INCOMPETENCE AT THE TOP ARE DESTROYING THE BUREAU. LET'S DISCUSS THAT WITH SENATOR RON JOHNSON, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE WHO RECENTLY SENT A LETTER TO F.B.I. DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY REQUESTING INFORMATION ON COMEY'S BRIEFING OF TRUMP ON THAT INFAMOUS RUSSIA DOSSIER. GREAT TO HAVE YOU IN THE STUDIO. HELLO, LAURA. Laura: TELL US. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT THREADS IT'S HARD TO UNPACK. TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE. THERE IS A LOT OF SMOKE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. THIS IS LIKE 1,000-PIECE JIGSAW PUZZLE. MILLER PROBABLY HAS A FEW HUNDRED PIECES. I.IG HOROWITZ HAS A FEW LESS. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER AND HE CAN'T BRING IN WITNESSES OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT. THE PRESS HAS MORE PIECES THAN THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. Laura: THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF LEAKS. SELECTIVE LEAKS. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THOSE LEAKERS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH? TRYING TO GET AHEAD BEFORE THE PUBLIC HAS THE TRUTH. THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION IS BACKWARDS. THIS IS A POLITICAL INVESTIGATION. I THINK CONGRESS OUGHT TO GET THE INFORMATION FIRST. WRITE THE REPORTS AND THEN IF WE SEE THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY REFER IT TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR A SPECIAL COUNSEL. THE PROBLEM IS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR CONGRESS TO GET ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER. WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION. I'M TRYING TO LAY IT OUT IN TIMELINES. CHUCK GRASSLEY TALKING ABOUT THE RECENT TWEET THAT IS GETTING PROMINENCE. ON AUGUST 5, THE WHITE HOUSE IS RUNNING THIS. COMBINE THIS WITH THE TWEET WE GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR PUBLISHING IN ONE OF OUR REPORTS Laura. PUT IT UP SO PEOPLE CAN SEE IT. A QUOTE FROM GRASSLEY TO ROSENSTEIN TODAY IN A LETTER AND SAID AS ONE EXAMPLE OF THE TEXT FROM LISA PAIGE AND PETER STROZK THEY WANT ALL THE TEXTS. ONE EXAMPLE AN OFFICIAL'S NAME WAS REDACTED IN REFERENCE TO A TEXT ABOUT THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE RUNNING AN INVESTIGATION. ALTHOUGH IT'S UNCLEAR WHO THIS INVESTIGATION THEY WERE REFERRING. GOING BACK TO MY QUESTION IN THE ANGLE, WHO KNEW ABOUT THIS? WE HAVE SO MANY REDACTIONS WE CAN'T PUT PIECES TOGETHER. THERE IS A LOT OF SMOKE. IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE TWEET WE PUBLISHED ID JUST GOT BASHED FOR IN THE PRESS A MONTH LATER. SEPTEMBER 2. POTUS WANTS THIS IS FROM PAIGE TO STRONG PAGE TO STROZK. POTUS WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING. THIS IS AFTER THEY CLOSED UP, EXONERATED HILLARY CLINTON. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL GET AN I.G. REPORT ON. HOROWITZ DID AN EXCELLENT JOB. McCABE GOT HIM, CAUGHT HIM LYING AND LAID OUT 32 PAGES EXACTLY WHY THE DEPUTY AND THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I. LIED TO THE F.B.I. OKAY? I MEAN, IF ANYBODY OUGHT TO KNOW THAT IS A CRIME, THAT IS THE MAN WHO SHOULD HAVE DONE SO. IT'S NO LONGER MARTYR McCABE. THESE TYPE OF THE TEXTS HERE ARE UNBELIEVABLY REVEALING. Laura: THE QUESTION I ASKED IN MY OPENING ANGLE, WHO BASICALLY KNEW HOW THIS WAS GOING DOWN? CARTER PAIGE IS THE REASON YOU ARE OPENING UP A BIG INVESTIGATION WHERE YOU END UP PUTTING AN INFORMANT OUT THERE? AND THEN YOU ENUP SURVEILLING THE TRUMP TOWER AND CUSHION CUSHION AND THE GUYS TO GET THE PHONE CALLS LISTENED TO? THEN YOU HAVE A RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE VISITED BY THE F.B.I. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2016. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET HIM TO AGREE TO THIS IS A COLLUSION THING GOING ON. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THEY WERE LOOKING FOR C'MON, HELP US WITH THE COLLUSION STUFF. EVEN THE RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE WHO HATES PAUL MANAFORT, THE OLLIE OLIGARCH SAYS I CAN'T STAND HIM BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH IMAGINATION TO LOOK AT THIS AND SAY THIS IS A SETUP. THE WHITE HOUSE RUNNING THIS AND POTUS WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING. THE HATS START PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. WE MAYBE GOT 25 TO 50 PIECES OUT OF THAT 1,000 PAGE Laura: ARE YOU GOOD AT JIGSAW PUZZLES? ARE YOU GOOD AT IT? I GET FRUSTRATED. RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR THE I.G. REPORT ON THE CLINTON E-MAIL. HOPEFULLY THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. THAT HAS BEEN OUR INVESTIGATION. THREE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS INFORMATION. WE'LL GET THAT. BUT WE ARE ON THE CASE. I'M WRITING TO CHRISTOPHER WRAY. WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR DOCUMENT PRODUCTION? WHO IS DOING THE REDACTION? WHAT IS THE CRITERIA? WHAT WAS IT? WHAT IS IT NOW? WE CAN'T EVEN GET THAT INFORMATION. Laura: HOW DO YOU YOUR OVERSIGHT? IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT IT IS THIS TAFFY PULL. I KNOW THERE IS ALWAYS HISTORIC TENSION AMONG THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO SHOW EVERYTHING. I DON'T EVER REMEMBER IT BEING THIS BAD. I DON'T. WHAT SURPRISED ME IS WE HAVEN'T HAD F.B.I. AGENTS COME FORWARD TO THE COMMITTEE. THEY WILL GO TO THE PRESS Laura: THEY WANT TO TESTIFY ON WHAT, SENATOR? WELL, WE HEARD THAT WHEN COMEY EXONERATED CLINTON THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANTED TO, THEY WERE GOING TO BLOW A GASKET BASICALLY. WHY DIDN'T THEY COME FORWARD? COME FORWARD TO MY COMMITTEE. WE WILL PROTECT YOU. Laura: YOU SHOULD BRING THE RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE IN, GET HIM ON VIDEO. GET THE RUSSIAN LAWYER. GET VESELNITSKAYA. THEY DIDN'T TALK TO HER. IT WOULD NICE TO HAVE MORE EVIDENCE BEFORE DOING THE
