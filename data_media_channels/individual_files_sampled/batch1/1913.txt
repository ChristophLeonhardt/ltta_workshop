every month in Afghanistan sees more bombings more civilian casualties more suffering as both the Taliban and - Mount fresh attacks and US forces under President Trump continue to support the country's believe that government we sent correspondent Souter to ask the American general in charge if and how this war will ever end Kabul the Afghan capital in early 2018 after 17 years have american-led operations here US President Trump decided to reverse his predecessors crawl down we've come to meet the general who persuaded Trump to stay in Afghanistan and who's now responsible for helping the Afghan forces hold the line against both the Isis insurgency here and the Taliban Monday morning oh so welcome I'm heading to the moment Valley with General John Nicholson the four-star general in charge of the NATO mission in Afghanistan it's where Isis made its Afghan headquarters close to the Pakistan border the Taliban affected successful the Isis fighters originally were getting money from Syria money from Iraq advanced weaponry for them that money is dried up and now they're trying to extract money this is where the war started you know on a 911 was launched from here my office was destroyed in the Pentagon on 9/11 by the plane that hit the building thanks to God I was not in my office at that time so it's deeply personal for me I'm the first journalist to land in the moment rally since general Nicholson dropped the mother of all bombs here last April as well as destroying an Isis network of tunnels the detonation of this huge ordnance signaled that Nicholson had changed the mind of his new commander in Bravo and then will assess what the situation is and act accordingly okay do you guys have any questions for now no thanks the fighters in that particular Valley are primarily I mean eighty percent from the origin see of Pakistan and they are Pakistani Pashto former members of the Taraki Taliban Pakistan who formerly applied for membership in Isis and they attempted to establish a Caliphate which Olalla bad is their capital and so initially when I arrived here two years ago in 2016 they had carved out nine districts of southern Afghanistan since that time in the last two years we have driven them down into about three districts Isis Khorasan as they're known here soon became another proxy power in Afghanistan's propaganda war but theirs was the most brutal this online video shows them executing locals using land mines how do you know who they are well we know this by capturing their headquarters capturing their passports or identity cars some of these people have gone from government controlled Taliban control to ISIL controls to back to government controlled again they get kicked around a group of elders and a youth leader who recently returned to the valley after Isis K was routed have been invited to meet the general with a NATO photographer on hand keen to record how the US is here at the consent of the people in August you know our president talked about staying here in Afghanistan this was a big decision for the United States it's because you're fighting these terrorists Isis here in Afghanistan you're fighting on behalf of us one of the big differences of this strategy is that we're not leaving based on a timetable the timetable was President Obama's his drawdown had left general Nicholson facing a rejuvenated Taliban when President Trump took office he was rumoured to be about to sack Nicholson and pull out completely so the general went to Washington and in very on general light language told the Senators that they were far from winning in your overall commanders assessment are we winning or losing mr. Chairman I believe we're in a stalemate this is the highest concentration of terrorist groups anywhere in the world we believe as we said that our operations in Afghanistan directly protect the homeland we need a strategy to succeed and if we can know that strategy which is being developed I can assure you you will receive the bipartisan strong support but we need to know what assets the Congress can give you Nicholson pulled off a presidential u-turn Trump increased his troop level by another 3,500 the new focus became the training advising and assisting of their Afghan partners and ramping up the air campaign the airstrikes have been effective against Isis K where Afghan commandos are supported by US Special Forces whose identities we have to hide how many fighters we're estimating around 20 fighters right there just talk to me about your fight against Isis how do they differ as a fight against say the Taliban are they different deliberately technically Jenny McCarthy when they were holding kids up so how did I pee excited Delta Chi to Redondo who sued the Pakistan Oh how do you feel towards Pakistan is the focus our bomb okay bill okay today another propaganda video shows Afghan children being used to execute captured Afghan soldiers we see the weapons here the battle here the fight here actually the fight is as much in here for the young people as it is and he it's the ideological fights are more total production and I'm still at the pace here active me as one that's alert time of the peace dr. Joseph Johnson the need for education I mean it so it's a music to my ears to hear you talk about the education for your children thank you could they still be threatening if it wasn't for Pakistan that's a good question I think this ideology is a threat wherever it exists so I think in one sense the ideology is what we're trying to defeat with its brutality with its strange interpretation of Islam which is again rejected by the majority of the Afghans so the fact that they could operate from across the border recruit and then move into Afghanistan is a problem for us because of course we cannot affect them and in the place of origin but the u.s. is taking on these fighters across the border John warfare on Pakistan's soil has increased with 12 attacks since Trump took office for its part Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos violence and terror the president has turned up the heat freezing two billion dollars in security aid and raising fears that further strikes are planned on areas the u.s. deems enemy sanctuaries in Pakistan Tuesday night Helmand province and a different battle against a different enemy this is the Taliban heartland it's where the Afghan army is facing its fiercest fight and where it's losing a lot of ground the Taliban controls nine out of Hellmann's 14 districts there is a lot of publicity be made about oh the Taliban are contesting 70% of the country now would you give us an estimate as to where the major battles are and how much is it testing the AAA we believe that the government controls two-thirds of the country two-thirds of the population at 12 percent controlled by the Taliban 25% being fought over so at most a third of the country has been fought over we've been allowed into Hellmann's war room the joint operating center where the US calls in airstrikes to coordinate with the Afghan ground offensive the intelligence officers are nervous about us filming the screens and walls are full of sensitive data I'm very clear we go beyond that to decide this military necessity that requires that we do something about it sorry to let somebody live to fight another day but the figures tell a different story more than 4,300 weapons were dropped in their expanded air campaign last year 631 civilians were killed I guess no we're really more than here looking out over one of the biggest former camps in Helmand sums up how the foreign presence has changed here in Afghanistan and thinking about the numbers that it's height just here in Helmand there were tens of thousands of foreign soldiers across the whole of Afghanistan and over 120,000 17 years on that figure has just got so small here less than a thousand foreign soldiers across the country and wasn't 15,000 many people are looking at this figures I'm thinking well how can that few and number win the peace when over a hundred thousand couldn't the forces couldn't win this war with over a hundred thousand foreign fighters in the country how can they do it with so few now yeah well the difference is that the Afghan army is doing the fighting so when we had 150,000 foreign forces here the Afghan army was much smaller now Afghans are flying their own UAVs that are flying there on aircraft we're shooting their own artillery and they're closing with the enemy and defeating them and so this is what's gonna win this war but a win fills a long way off here in Helmand and these patients came in overnight yeah for business okay well created from kojiki ID blasts when they was in car unfortunately right lake invitation left leg fracture the right hander injury and he was in shock and what waited time do you remember what happened something interesting yeah for sure what's out of my mind a free short cut to sit again I could have told to sell again I wonder Tony it would wash aside Janko but I feel that si is wrongfully like that was a hero sir Houghton and Fisher cat into a song with her well as you question it has so much value Giacomo what am i apparently say short on when we're in such short of our module in the hall so to salute optimize our wonderful job now again wonderful space immunities right and injuries with bull fractures left leg multiple injuries when skiing depicted never damage and also he had some intra-abdominal injuries it's impossible to know how the Afghan offensive is going against the Taliban since the Pentagon classified the casualty figures some Afghans find it a little bit unnerving that no longer of the Afghan casualties being made public as a military man yourself you're used to being in the states where that sort of thing is made public it's it's transparent in the United States can you understand why people might feel a little bit suspicious that these kind of figures aren't now being revealed since the Pentagon classifies them yeah so this was a request from the Afghan government and frankly it's in keeping with the the theme we heard from the United States about not providing information that's a value to the enemy we honor that request as you correctly point out we do publicize our casualty figures in the United States the major general in charge of Afghan forces in Helmand is adamant that his soldiers could beat the Taliban if it weren't for those fighting a proxy war a luminosity agraja manager another particular deal molecular scale D predicable militarism Oh Judy the epididymis Gilly sorry wedge color with our junk last her hump are my other caste and the most beautiful form okay we'll catch any adulation awesome Jenga was from his novel America Watts Mustafa Kemal atatürk sure cardinality back in Kabul the general is greeting VIPs the supreme Allied commander for Europe and the US ambassador to NATO their visit doesn't go unnoticed early the next morning multiple attacks across the country the first just a kilometer from us on the NATO base where an Isis case suicide bomber kills two a Taliban attack on an army checkpoint in Farah province kills 22 Afghan soldiers and another in Helmand kills two more injuring 12 civilians explosion took place near a NDS building near of the green zone security zone in Kabul it doesn't deter the VIPs from holding a press conference so we're just learning this week that the US and now indeed the Afghan government are requesting the Taliban office in Qatar is shut down you talk about hoping to get peace talks restarted again what sort of channel what sort of contact is going to be used for this now that that office is no longer going to be there there's no talking to the Taliban we don't want to talk to the Taliban we're going to finish what we have to finish what nobody else has been able to finish we're going to be able to do it know for the first time Trump's mischievous don't quite chime with what his people are saying on the ground talks about those beginning talks are certainly in the works in different forms don't think that nothing is happening there is a lot that is happening in a very beginning stage of a beginning stage of a way forward the next day I leave the base to make a pre-arranged phone call with the Taliban is there any peace going on with the Americans or with the Afghan government are you open to peace we spoke on the telephone to the Taliban spokesman and his attitude is look in the end the American presence is basically prolonging the war he was using the fact that you're still here as a reason the war is still going on the only thing that's prolonging the war is that this insurgency can exist outside the borders of the country if they actually had to live inside the country and face the Afghan army backed up by the international coalition they would have been gone a long time ago what's particularly disturbing about this recent round of attacks is that despite their stated objective to reduce civilian casualties the Taliban are deliberately targeting civilians your recent bombing campaign especially in the cities is killing civilians is this a concern of yours because the the campaign is in highly populated areas civilians are dying by late February just this year the Taliban attacks on Kabul had killed 117 civilians it's made securing the capital more important and more difficult than ever okay sounds good sergeant major Clark's nighttime checkpoint inspection goes to the heart of this u.s. training mission taking responsibility instilling discipline leading by example pink let our guards down and sometimes they let their guards down this one bad thing he's ever so I want to ask him a couple of questions how many patrolmen he have here at this check for a ginger China party 23 people 23 yeah do they put their finger on there if that record was in the biometric system it is good to go if no go back okay gotta be in the system he will be in the system that record yes to keep morale with there's many attacks is it difficult for them to keep their morale discourage hi yes you know the iron when you put the iron like that that are this changing to the steel wheels all right oh we are good for us we are every day the morality just Afghanistan us yeah we are one person wearing the uniform and we are very proud of that why is it important to come here to see you need to lead by example 24 plus 7 that's all this is your business we are they still own the night so that's the new campaign for this year is NCO young do the knight NCOs out on the front line and the we we are was checking on the shoulders lean from the front and showing them that they truly care about their man so that one is convenient but in the middle of the night we are America's longest war is far from one indeed the Taliban say they're making significant headway but the general wants the world to believe the momentum has turned in their favor I have deep respect for the Afghan people these people just want a better more peaceful life for themselves and their children they don't want their home to be a place where terrorists attack others from I've had many friends who have fought here and died here soldiers who work for me and then many great Afghan friends and comrades who have served alongside the fight that they are fighting against terrorists is not only on behalf of Afghanistan it's on behalf of all of us this conflict is driven by foreign interests the u.s. is here not to help Afghans but to protect Americans back home the Taliban and Isis K have their own foreign benefactors and so this geo political quagmire gets ever deeper the general may have no timetable for withdrawal but is his president committed to the long game
