11
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,533
DEMOCRATS HOPING TO GET THE

12
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,735
RIGHT MIX OUT OF THAT JUNGLE

13
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:15,703
PRIMARY, WHAT HAPPENS IN

14
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,505
CALIFORNIA COULD BE KEY TO

15
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:19,340
DEMOCRATS EFFORTS TO END THE

16
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,140
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.

17
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,408
JOINING ME TO BREAK THIS DOWN, A

18
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:24,578
NUMBER OF HOT ISSUES, SENIOR

00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,246
CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER CHAD

20
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:25,746
PERGRAM.

21
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:27,181
CHAD, LET'S START BY TALKING

22
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,582
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

23
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:29,783
CALIFORNIA TONIGHT.

24
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:30,651
WHY IS THIS PRIMARY RACE SO

25
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,219
PIVOTAL TO THE BIGGER PICTURE OF

26
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,621
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDTERM?

27
00:00:33,621 --> 00:00:34,822
>> WELCOME OF THE GOLDEN STATE

28
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:37,424
IS IN FACT GOLDEN FOR BOTH

29
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:38,425
PARTIES HERE.

30
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:39,159
THINK ABOUT THIS, THE DEMOCRATS

31
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,864
WERE TO WIN THE HOUSE OF

32
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:44,431
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUT

33
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:44,465
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOU2

34
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:45,466
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOU1

35
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:45,499
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUS

36
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:45,533
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUA

37
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:45,566
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOUS

38
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,267
REPRESENTATIVES, THEY NEED ABOU.

39
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,068
THERE ARE POTENTIALLY NINE SEATS

40
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:48,903
IN CALIFORNIA.

41
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:49,770
AS PETER SAID, DEMOCRATS ARE

42
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,272
FLOODING THE ZONE, SO MANY

43
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,907
DEMOCRATS ON THE BALLOT IN THESE

44
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:54,441
RACES HERE, THEY ARE DILUTING

45
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:54,942
THEIR OWN VOTES.

46
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:56,911
YOU COULD HAVE WITH A JUNGLE

47
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,178
PRIMARY, MAY BE TWO DEMOCRATS,

48
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,314
MAY BE A DEMOCRAT AND

49
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:01,015
REPUBLICAN, OR TWO REPUBLICANS

50
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,150
AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.

51
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,984
THAT LOCKS THESE MEMBERS OUT

52
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:04,318
HERE.

53
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:07,655
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET THE

54
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:09,390
MAJORITY, CALIFORNIA IS A BIG

55
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,057
PRIZE.

56
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:11,458
THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS.

57
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,860
GRANTED, THEY CAN MAKE UP THE

58
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,861
DIFFERENCE IN PLACES LIKE

59
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:15,462
VIRGINIA, WHERE THERE ARE SOME

60
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:17,731
RACES, COLORADO, MAYBE FLORIDA,

61
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:19,900
BUT CALIFORNIA IS THE BIG PRIZE.

62
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,101
>> Shannon: IT IS A BIT OF A

63
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:22,303
PROXY WAR BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO

64
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:24,305
WANT TO BE THE NEXT SPEAKER OF

65
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,105
THE HOUSE.

66
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:25,973
>> YOU HAVE NANCY PELOSI, WHO

67
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:28,108
WANTS TO RETURN TO THE

68
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:28,776
SPEAKERSHIP, KEVIN McCARTHY,

69
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:31,345
WHO WANTS TO BE THE SPEAKER,

70
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:32,112
REMEMBER, PAUL RYAN IS RETIRING

71
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:33,747
AT THE END OF THIS CONGRESS.

72
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,516
AT WHICHEVER PARTY KIND OF

73
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:37,351
FORGES AHEAD HERE, THIS IS HOME

74
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,587
TURF IN CALIFORNIA, IF

75
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:40,788
THOSE TWO LEADERS SHOW THEIR

76
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:41,755
BONA FIDES AND MAYBE THE

77
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:43,424
REPUBLICANS CAN LOOK AT THE

78
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,625
DEMOCRATS, MAYBE NANCY PELOSI

79
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,994
CAN BRING THINGS HOME FOR THE

80
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:49,863
DEMS, THIS PORTENDS THEIR FUTURE

81
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,465
IN CALIFORNIA.

82
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,132
WE'LL KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT

83
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:53,667
PARTY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HOLD

84
00:01:53,667 --> 00:00:00,000
THE ROWS HOUSE OF
