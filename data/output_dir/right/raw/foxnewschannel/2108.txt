WE KNOW THAT POLITICS CAN GET

23
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,921
PRETTY NASTY, BUT IT APPEARS

24
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,722
THAT MR. BLANKENSHIP HAS DECIDED

25
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:25,524
THAT THIS IS A GOOD PLAN.

26
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,093
A GOOD STRATEGY FOR HIM.

28
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:32,931
WRONG, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF

ABOUT THIS, HE WENT TO JAIL

00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,106

SO LET'S PICK A CLEAR, HE IS A

00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,050
BIGOT, A MORON, IF HE WINS THE

66
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,752

00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:27,853
CHANCES GO BY APPOINTING

68
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:28,287
WEST VIRGINIA.

69
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:30,322
>> Martha: TAMMY?

70
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,324
>> I THINK THAT THIS IS AN

71
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:33,525
EXTRAORDINARY, I AM NO FAN OF

72
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,327
MITCH McCONNELL, BUT THIS GUY

73
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,162
IS MAKING ME WANT TO DEFEND

74
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:37,896
MITCH McCONNELL, BECAUSE IT IS

75
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,499
SO ABSURD.

76
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,068
LOOK, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

77
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:45,003
SITUATION, HE REPRESENTS WHY

78
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,172
POLITICIANS PRETTY CLEARLY SEEMS

79
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:49,040
TO BE TRYING TO LOOK AT HIS OWN

80
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,110
REPUTATION BACK OR, HERE'S WHAT

81
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,446
YOU HAVE, YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS

82
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:57,082
RUNNING ON RACISM AND BIGOTRY,

83
00:01:57,082 --> 00:02:00,785
NO IDEA, NO POLICY IDEA,

84
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:01,820
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, MAYBE

85
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,488
HE IS RUNNING, SHOULD BE RUNNING

86
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:05,123
AS A DEMOCRAT AT THIS POINT.

87
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:06,658
HE IS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO

88
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:10,094
DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP AND

89
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,062
DONALD TRUMP JR. HAS REJECTED

90
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:13,064
HIM, DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS GUY,

91
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,499
THE PRESIDENT IN APRIL HAD AN

92
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:16,134
EVENT WHERE THE TWO OTHER

93
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,135
REPUBLICANS RUNNING WERE THERE

94
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:19,771
AND SUPPORTED HIM AND SUPPORTED

95
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,874
BUT THIS IS ABOUT TO VOTERS OF

96
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:23,875
WEST VIRGINIA, THE REPUBLICANS.

97
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,543
IT IS AN INSULT IN THE WAY THAT

98
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,312
HE IS APPROACHING THEM.

99
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:29,147
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO DO AND TO

100
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:30,048
ALLOW THIS KIND OF, IT IS ALMOST

101
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:34,085
LIKE A PARODY, THAT ADD TO, AND

102
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,153
IT IS HEARTBREAKING, BECAUSE WE

103
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:35,720
HAVE SO MUCH TO DO.

104
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,190
AND THIS IS A GUY WHO I THINK

105
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,191
IT'S NOT JUST TRYING TO SMEAR

106
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,895
MITCH McCONNELL, BUT TRYING TO

107
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:47,098
SMEAR THE ENTIRE CONSERVATIVE

108
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:47,699
MOVEMENT IN THE PROCESS.

109
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,666
>> Martha: IT IS INTERESTING

110
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,702
THAT AD THAT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A

111
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:51,903
PARODY, IT DOES, SORT OF AN

112
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:53,204
ONION AD OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE

113
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,540
IT IS ALMOST AS IF THEY SAID,

114
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,307
THESE ARE THE BUZZWORDS THAT WE

115
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,109
WANT YOU TO USE, WE WANT YOU TO

116
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,545
SAY CHINA FAMILY, WHAT A BIZARRE

117
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,513
EXPRESSION THAT THAT IS.

118
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:03,748
THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO WORK.

119
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:07,151
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, THERE

120
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,854
IS THIS MOUNTAINTOP FAMILY

121
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:12,390
PACKED WHICH ASSOCIATES OF

122
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,691
LEADER McCONNELL ARE INVOLVED

123
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,927
WITH, THEY DO NOT WANT HIM TO

124
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,428
WIN BECAUSE AS MITCH McCONNELL

125
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:19,297
OFTEN SAYS, HE WANTS CANDIDATES

126
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:19,931
THAT THEY THINK AND WIN.

127
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:27,171
SO THEY ARE BACK IN MORRISEY AND

128
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,640
OTHERS EVAN JENKINS, BUT THE

129
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,540
FEAR OF REPUBLICANS IS THAT THIS

130
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,143
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE A SHARON

131
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:34,312
ANGLE RACE OR WHAT HAPPENED WITH

132
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:36,314
ROY MOORE, YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE

133
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,683
VERY CONNECTED WITH THE

134
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:40,084
CAMPAIGNS IN THE REPUBLICAN

135
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:40,785
PARTY, DO YOU THINK, ARE YOU

136
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,386
NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO

137
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,122
HAPPEN ON TUESDAY NIGHT?

138
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:46,791
>> YES, I AM, TWO POINTS, WITH

00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,127
FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS WEEK I'VE

140
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,661
KNOWN EVAN JENKINS FOR A WHILE,

141
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:52,330
I DID A FUND-RAISER FOR HIM AND

142
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,664
HIS FIRST RACE FOR CONGRESS

143
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:56,167
WHERE HE DEFEATED AND THE MOST

144
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,535
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL

145
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:59,070
DISTRICT IN WEST VIRGINIA AND 19

146
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,938
TERM INCUMBENT, HE IS A DOCTOR,

147
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,740
HE SERVED AT THE STATE

148
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,641
LEGISLATOR, A DEMOCRATIC CHANGE

149
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,343
PARTY WHEN HE WAS IN THE

150
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:06,377
LEGISLATOR.

151
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,346
SO I WANT FULL DISCLOSURE, I AM

152
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:08,946
FOR HIM.

153
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:12,150
AND I CONTRIBUTED BECAUSE I AM

154
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,551
AFRAID OF BLANKENSHIP WINNING.

155
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:15,119
JENKINS IN THE FOX NEWS POLL A

156
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,954
WEEK AGO THURSDAY HAD 25.

157
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:20,057
PATRICK MORRISSEY HAD 21,

158
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:22,527
BLANKENSHIP HAD 16, BUT THERE

159
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,362
ARE 38% UNDECIDED, AND THIS WEEK

160
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,697
SINCE THIS POLL CAME OUT OF THE

161
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:28,966
FIELD, BLANKENSHIP HAS PUT

162
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,701
$1.2 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY

163
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,104
INTO THE RACE IN ADDITION, A

164
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:33,804
DEMOCRATIC SUPER PACKED HEADED

165
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:36,507
BY THE FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY WHO

166
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,876
PROSECUTED HIM AND SENT HIM TO

167
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:39,877
JAIL HAS SPENT SEVERAL MILLION

168
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:43,314
DOLLARS ATTACKING NOT DON

169
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,082
BLANKENSHIP, BUT EVAN JENKINS

170
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:47,118
AND PATRICK MORRISSEY, BECAUSE

171
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:48,085
THEY FEAR JENKINS AND PERHAPS

172
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:50,621
PATRICK MORRISSEY, BUT JENKINS

173
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:54,959
CAN BEAT MANCHIN IN THE FALL,

174
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,826
NOW HE IS SPENDING MONEY TO PUT

175
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:59,096
HIMSELF IN THE LEAD.

176
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:00,531
>> THE OTHER IS A SPLIT, THEY

177
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:04,035
CAN SPLIT THE VOTE GIVING

178
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:05,269
BLANKENSHIP THIS WIN, BUT THEN

179
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:06,904
IT COMES DOWN TO G.O.P.

180
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:07,305
LEADERSHIP.

181
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:09,073
WHY ARE WE IN THIS POSITION?

182
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:10,708
THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

183
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,108
ASKING.

184
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,777
WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO

185
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:13,177
ACCOMPLISH.

186
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:15,579
THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF

187
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,316
COALESCING IN MAKING THIS NOT

188
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:19,083
HAPPEN IN THIS FASHION, AND THIS

189
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,285
IS WHY WE LOOK FUNNY AT THE

190
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,054
G.O.P. ESTABLISHMENT THAT ONCE

191
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,322
AGAIN THEY SHOULD BE SOMETHING

192
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,057
THAT SHOULD BE A FIGHTING FIGHT

193
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:30,494
BY A STRONG REPUBLICAN END

194
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:31,262
AGAINST MANCHIN COULD WIN.

195
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,296
WE ARE NOT EVEN THERE.

196
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,964
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SOME

197
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:34,965
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE G.O.P.

198
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:36,500
>> I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU

199
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,903
MORE, THAT'S WHY I PERSONALLY

200
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:39,904
STEPPED UP AND CONTRIBUTED TO

201
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,438
THE JENKINS CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE I

202
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:42,940
FELT THAT HE WAS THE BEST

203
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,208
CANDIDATE, BUT YOU KNOW, I'M NOT

204
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,343
A WEST VIRGINIAN, BUT I BELIEVE

205
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:47,645
THAT WEST VIRGINIA IS A GREAT

206
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:48,345
OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

207
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:51,415
IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIRGINIAN

208
00:05:51,415 --> 00:00:00,000
BALLOT, THE GENERIC REPUBLICAN'S
