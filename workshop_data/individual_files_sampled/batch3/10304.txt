and sincere support results would have been very different so once again I would like to thank all of you thank all the voters in fact everybody who voted for me and I said something on the square and I would like to repeat it once again here to me this is a sign that we were able to achieve a lot in recent years despite difficult circumstances so people appreciate what we've done number two this result indicates that they trust us and third they have hope it's important to bring all the people together regardless of who they voted for because we have very difficult problems facing us and we have not just to resolve them but like I said in my State of the Nation Address we need a breakthrough and we can do that we have every reason to believe that we will do this and it's important for us to know that all political forces should not follow their short-term plan interests they should think about the whole nation yes we can have different approaches but I would like everybody to have a sincere desire to achieve good results in difficult circumstances that we live in and for that it's really important to me and in fact to our whole team I think it's very important to continue working together like we did of course each one of us will be working in his own circumstances his or her own circumstances but this doesn't matter whether we are officially a member of some institution or not what really matters is that we should be aware of the great challenges facing us today and we have to overcome those challenges we have to accomplish what our country needs today and I really hope that we will keep working together you know when I was on the square what a few minutes ago somebody shouted in the crowd saying we are your team and I was very pleased I said I'm also a member of our team I would like to preserve this team in the years to come I want us all to work together for Russia for our country thank you very much thank you thank you once again I would like to thank all of you the best of luck to all of you thank you thank you very much yes we are Russia Russia Russia thank you you the creation good evening what how do you feel tell us about your emotions and your plan for tomorrow emotions I'm very grateful to voters for what they did for the choice they made for their trust or their appreciation our work in recent years and for their hope they clearly hope and expect us to work together our entire team expanded team and yours truly we will all work even harder and as hard as we did but achieving even better results and we have every reason to believe that we'll be able to achieve a lot there was the situation with Sergey the poisoning of Sergey stripout during the race what do you think about Russia EU relations well as regards this tragedy that you mentioned I learned about it from the media and the first thing that came to my mind that if this was a military-grade substance they would have died straight away you have to understand that a second Russia doesn't have chemical weapons we've disposed of all our chemical weapons observed by international monitors unlike some of our international partners who promised to do the same but unfortunately failed to deliver on their promises so we are ready to cooperate and we said as much straight away we are ready to participate in the investigation but in order for us to do that the other side has to show some interest as well and but now we still are open to work together on this matter and I think everybody understands that it is nonsense and it's absurd to claim that Russia can do something like that immediately before the presidential election and the World Cup it's just unthinkable still despite all these difficulties we are ready we are ready to work together we are ready to discuss any matters and overcome any difficulties the turnout was quite high but unfortunately our neighbors Ukrainians did not allow Russians to vote in Ukraine what do you think about that and how can Russia respond it's awful it's a violation of all international norms Russia will not respond in any way to us Ukrainian Ukrainian people they're our brothers I've always said so so we won't respond with any restrictions on the contrary we'll do everything we can the Ukrainians feel at home in Russia yesterday you congratulated chairman citizen Tina are you confident that bilateral relations between Russia and China will prosper Chairman C sets ambitious goals for China he wants to develop his country we wish the best of luck to the Chinese Chinese leadership and the people of China there are some ideas like the Silk Road and the economic component of the Silk Road I don't want to talk about the specifics of our cooperation but we think that this initiative is quite comparable with our projects we want to build Eurasian Economic Union we want to develop our Eurasian cooperation in an expanded sense of the term and our interests coincide they converge we have a lot of things on which we could work together and we'll do that China is our strategic partner the level of relations between Russia and China is unprecedented lehigh we are proud of it and we treasure these relations we congratulate chairman C on being reelected and we are confident that China led by him and Russia will do everything they can to further develop Russia China cooperation thus News Agency when will you nominate new members of your cabinet before inauguration day or after well the standard practice is the President appoints the new government in the new cabinet after he enters office so I will have to consider a few things first I think all the appointments will take place after inauguration day I would like to clarify do you have somebody in mind for Prime Minister will it be me trim it very for somebody else and are you going to launch a constitutional reform during your new term no at this point no constitutional reform is on the table as for Prime Minister and the cabinet in general I'm thinking about candidates but I'll start thinking specifically from today because I had to wait for the results but all announcements will be made after inauguration day what about the United States in Latin America the United States have has reinstated the Monroe Doctrine in Latin American well we know about history we know it's a history of gunboats and political pressure in Latin American countries but I really hope the current US administration they have a chance and I hope that they will take advantage of it they will be able to renew their relations with Latin American countries based on equality and mutual respect we want all continents countries and all continents to develop their relations in a positive way and the last question do you think it would be possible for you to return as president in 2030 if you change the Constitution in six years this is ridiculous what you're saying the let's just do the math do you expect me to stay here until I'm 100 years old of course not no do you have any plans to meet with other candidates yes I do I don't know when we'll see if my staff will contact them and we'll make an entire I will invite them all of them yes all of them so what will happen in the next six years will it be a new Latimer Putin or the old Putin you know everything changes all the time thank you we all change
