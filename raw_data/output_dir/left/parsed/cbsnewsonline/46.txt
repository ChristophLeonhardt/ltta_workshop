IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE MENTIONED 
THAT HE WAS DECLARED BY THE 
JUDGE AFTER A HEARING AS A 
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR. 
THAT WILL AFFECT HIM ONCE HE IS 
OUT OF PRISON. 
>> THE ONE BIG PIECE OF 
INFORMATION THAT WE ARE STILL 
WAITING FOR IS THE BAIL ISSUE 
AND IF HE GOES STRAIGHT TO 
PRISON OR IF HE IS OUT FOR A 
TIME BEFORE HAND. 
>> THAT MAY BE FOR HIM JUST AS 
IMPORTANT AS THE THREE TO 10 
YEARS. 
BECAUSE HE WILL MOVE IF THIS 
JUDGE DENIES IT THEY -- THE 
LAWYERS WILL IMMEDIATELY GO TO 
AN APPELLATE JUDGE AND THEY 
WILL ASK THAT HIS SENTENCE  BE 
STAYED, PENDING APPEAL. 
WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT IS THAT 
THEY WANT HIM TO GO HOME WHILE 
THE APPEAL IS PENDING. 
AND THE REASON FOR THAT, IN HIS 
PARTICULAR SITUATION IS HIS 
AGE. 
BECAUSE HIS APPEAL, WHICH COULD 
TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS, AND IF 
IT IS ULTIMATELY DECIDED IN HIS 
FAVOR, NO COURT REALLY WANTS 
HIM SERVING A SENTENCE THAT 
COULD BE REVERSED. 
BUT THIS JUDGE IS VERY 
CONFIDENT, I'M SURE, THAT HE 
DID NOT COMMIT ADDITIONAL 
ERROR. 
>>> WE MENTIONED THAT YOU ARE 
OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM AND WHAT 
ARE YOU HEARING AND SEEING 
THERE? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE HEARING 
PEOPLE LOUD.  
WE ARE HEARING PEOPLE SHOUTING. 
WE HEAR THAT THE JUDGE SAID 
THAT THE VERDICT, THE VERDICT 
OF THE JURY FROM APRIL MUST BE 
HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR. 
WE ARE ALSO HEARING THAT 
SEVERAL OF THE ACCUSERS OF BILL 
COSBY ARE IN THAT COURTROOM 
AND, AS THAT SENTENCE WAS READ, 
THEY WERE ARM AND ARM. 
SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN SOBBING. 
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT 
ANDREA COSTAND MUST BE FEELING 
AT ALL OF THIS. 
SHE ACTUALLY READ A VERY SMALL 
PORTION OF HER VICTIM'S IMPACT 
STATEMENT YESTERDAY BUT WE WERE 
ABLE TO GET A FULL COPY OF WHAT 
SHE SAID TO THE COURT. 
I WANT TO READ SOME OF THIS TO 
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT SHE 
MUST BE FEELING RIGHT NOW. 
SHE SAYS I HAVE OFTEN ASKED 
MYSELF WHY THE BURDEN OF BEING 
THE SOLE WITNESS IN TWO 
CRIMINAL TRIALS HAD TO FALL TO 
ME. 
THE PRESSURE WAS ENORMOUS, SHE 
SAID, BUT I HAD TO TESTIFY. 
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DEAL. 
SHE GOES ON TO SAY THAT BILL 
COSBY TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL, 
HEALTHY, YOUNG SPIRIT AND 
CRUSHED IT. 
HE ROBBED ME OF MY HEALTH AND 
VITALITY, MY OPEN NATURE, AND 
MY TRUST IN MYSELF AND OTHERS. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO LOOKING 
FORWARD. 
I WANT TO GET TO THE PLACE 
WHERE THE PERSON THAT I WAS 
MEANT TO BE GETS A SECOND 
CHANCE. 
SO AGAIN, JUST TO REITERATE, 
THIS CASE GOES BACK ALMOST 3 
YEARS WHEN BILL COSBY WAS 
CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED 
INDECENT ASSAULT AT THE END OF 
DECEMBER 2015, CLOSE TO THE 
TIME THAT THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS WAS ABOUT TO RUN 
OUT. 
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
REOPENS THIS CASE AND GOES TO 
TRIAL IN 2017. 
AS YOU RECALL, IT WAS IN HIS 
TRIAL BECAUSE THE JURY COULD 
NOT REACH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT. 
IN THAT SECOND TRIAL, IN APRIL, 
IT WAS A CONVICTION ON ALL 
COUNTS FOR BILL COSBY, AS YOU 
MENTIONED, HEARING THAT HE WILL 
BE GOING TO STATE PRISON, 3 TO 
10 YEARS SENTENCE. 
WE ARE GETTING EMAILS AS WE 
SPEAK FROM THE PEOPLE INSIDE. 
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT 
THE APPEALS ARGUMENTS ARE 
UNDERWAY, SO WE ARE NOT SURE 
WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE 
BAIL, WHETHER OR NOT BILL COSBY 
WILL BE ABLE TO GO HOME TONIGHT 
OR IF YOU WILL SPEND TIME  IN A 
COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY 
AND THEN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE 
STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE OF 
PHOENIX. 
A COURT OFFICIAL EARLIER TOLD 
ME THAT IF HE IS REMANDED, HE 
WILL BE BROUGHT OUT IN 
HANDCUFFS AND PROCESSED AT THE 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY CORRECTIONAL 
FACILITY ABOUT SIX MILES FROM 
HERE. 
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WAITING TO 
HEAR FROM SOME OF THOSE 
ACCUSERS AS WELL AS ANDREA 
COSTAND, THE WOMAN AT THE HEART 
AND SOUL OF THIS CASE. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. úWE HAV 
THE COURTROOM WHO HAS SAID THAT 
THERE WERE SEVEN VICTIMS IN A 
ROW BEHIND HIM, ARM IN ARM, ALL 
CRYING, AS THIS TOOK PLACE. 
BILL COSBY, AGAIN, SENTENCED 
TODAY, MOST AGO TO THREE TO 10 
YEARS IN PRISON. 
HE WAS TALKING A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT WHERE HE WILL END UP. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT? 
>> SHE IS CORRECT THAT HE WILL 
BE ASSESSED FIRST AT THE 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY FACILITY AND 
GOING TO GO INTO A STATE PRISON 
SYSTEM. 
WHEN HE IS ASSESSED, HE COULD 
WIND UP IN GENERAL POPULATION 
WHICH ARE CELLS OF TWO EACH AND 
HE COULD END UP IN A MEDICAL 
FACILITY, WHICH IS HIGHLY 
LIKELY TERMS OF HIS HEALTH, HIS 
BLINDNESS, A -- MEDICAL 
FACILITY BEING AT THE STATE 
PRISON. 
STATE PRISONS IN PENNSYLVANIA 
DO HAVE FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE 
ú 
DIFFICULTIES. 
>> BREAKING NEWS, AND WE HEARD 
THAT THE JUDGE HAS REACHED YOU 
REFUSED HIS REQUEST FOR BAIL. 
STRAIGHT TO PRISON. 
THEY WILL GO STRAIGHT UP, HIS 
LAWYERS, TO TRY TO GET A STAY, 
PENDING APPEAL, BASED ON ERRORS 
THAT THEY BELIEVE WERE 
COMMITTED AT THE TRIAL. 
THEY HAVE A LAUNDRY LIST OF 
ERRORS. 
THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES 
BUT THEY ARE NOT FRIVOLOUS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SENTENCED TO THREE TO 10 YEARS 
IN PRISON FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT 
JERICKA DUNCAN IS OUTSIDE THE 
COURTHOUSE NOW IN NORRISTOWN, 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
TELL US WHAT YOU CAN TELL US 
ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS 
SENTENCING. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT NOW  THERE 
ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE INSIDE 
THE COURTROOM. 
WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT ANDREA 
COSTAND MUST BE FEELING. 
WE ARE HEARING THAT BILL COSBY 
ACCUSERS WERE LINKED ARM IN 
ARM. 
SOME OF THEM WERE SOBBING AT 
TIMES. 
JUST GETTING WORD THAT BILL 
COSBY WAS SENTENCED TO THREE 
YEARS TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON. 
THIS GOES BACK ALMOST 3 YEARS 
AGO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CASE. 
AT THE END OF DECEMBER, 2015, 
HE WAS CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED 
INDECENT ASSAULT. 
THE FIRST TRIAL ENDED IN A 
MISTRIAL. 
THE SECOND ONE LAST APRIL AND 
ENDED IN HIS CONVICTION. 
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD ASKED 
A JUDGE FOR FIVE TO 10 YEARS SO 
THIS IS CLOSE TO THE REALM OF 
WHAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
ASKED FOR. 
WE HEARD BRIEFLY YESTERDAY FROM 
ANDREA COSTAND THAT READ A 
LITTLE BIT FROM HER VICTIM 
IMPACT STATEMENT, BUT WE WERE 
ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET A COPY OF 
THAT TODAY. 
I WANT TO READ YOU SOME QUOTES 
OF WHAT SHE SAID. 
FOR THE COURT. 
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF 
WHAT SHE MUST BE FEELING? 
SHE SAID I HAVE OFTEN ASKED 
MYSELF WHY THE BURDEN OF BEING 
THE SOLE WITNESS IN TWO 
CRIMINAL TRIAL -- TRIALS HAD TO 
FALL ON ME. 
THE PRESSURE WAS ENORMOUS BUT I 
HAD TO TESTIFY BUT IT WAS THE 
RIGHT THING TO DO. 
BILL COSBY TOOK MY BEAUTIFUL, 
HEALTHY, YOUNG SPIRIT, AND 
CRUSHED IT, SHE SAYS. 
HE ROBBED ME OF MY HEALTH AND 
VITALITY, OPEN NATURE AND MY 
TRUST IN MYSELF AND IN OTHERS. 
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO LOOKING 
FORWARD. 
I WANT TO GET TO THE PLACE 
WHERE THE PERSON THAT I WAS 
MEANT TO BE GETS A SECOND 
CHANCE. 
ON TOP OF BEING SENTENCED TO 
THREE YEARS TO 10 YEARS IN 
PRISON, BILL COSBY WILL NOW BE 
DESIGNATED AS A SEXUALLY 
VIOLENT PREDATOR. 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
IT MEANS THAT HE WILL BE 
REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX 
OFFENDER FOR THE REST OF HIS 
LIFE. 
HE PRETTY MUCH HAS TO LET THE 
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA KNOW 
ABOUT HIS EVERY MOVEMENT, AS 
WELL AS HIS NAME, ADDRESS, AND 
WHAT HE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF. 
IT WILL APPEAR ON THE STATE 
WEBSITE FOR ALL TO SEE IF THE 
DEFENSE HAD ARGUED POINTS IN 
THIS SENTENCING HEARING THAT 
BILL COSBY BE ABLE TO SERVE 
TIME AT HOME ON HOUSE ARREST. 
THE PROSCUTION WAS ADAMANT 
THAT IT WOULD BE A GET OUT OF 
JAIL FREE CARD ACCORDING TO THE 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. 
THEY WERE REALLY OFFERING TO 
SEE THAT BILL COSBY SPENT TIME 
BEHIND BARS. 
I AM HEARING A LITTLE BIT OF 
ACTIVITY BEHIND ME. 
FOLKS ARE COMING OUT OF THE 
COURTHOUSE. 
WE ARE GETTING EMAILS RIGHT NOW 
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL IN 
THERE. 
THEY ARE RECESSING APPARENTLY 
TO HEAR THE ARGUMENTS ON BAIL. 
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT 
IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE 
JUDGE DENIED THE REQUEST FOR 
BAIL. 
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT BILL COSBY 
COULD PRESUMABLY SPEND THE 
NIGHT AND THE REST OF THE NEXT 
FEW NIGHTS AND YEARS IN PRISON. 
SO WE ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT 
IF THAT WILL REMAIN THE CASE. 
THE BAIL IS DENIED. 
WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY MEANS IN 
TERMS OF HIM BEING REMANDED 
FIRST TO THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY 
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, ABOUT 
SIX MILES FROM HERE BEFORE THEN 
HAVING TO GO TO THE STATE 
CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTE OF 
PHOENIX. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
IF YOU CAN HANG OUT FOR US FOR 
A SECOND. 
I WANT TO BRING IN RICKY 
KLEEMAN THAT IS JOINING ME ON 
THE SET. 
I WENT TO PICK UP THE LAST 
POINT THAT EUREKA HAD ABOUT THE 
BAIL. 
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THAT? 
>> NOT WITH THE JUDGE. 
THE JUDGE HAS BEEN STRICT IN 
THIS CASE. 
IT IS CLEAR HOW HE FEELS ABOUT 
THIS DEFENDANT. 
HE HAS DEALT WITH THIS 
DEFENDANT AND HIS MARIETTA OF 
LAWYERS FOR TWO TRIALS AND A 
SLEW OF MOTIONS AND THE JUDGE 
WAS READY TO SAY ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH.  
SO NO. 
IT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME. 
AT THE SAME TIME, WE CANNOT, IF 
WE LOOK AT IT FROM A LAWYER'S 
POINT OF VIEW AS OPPOSED TO 
FROM A WOMAN'S POINT OF VIEW -- 
AS A LAWYER, I SAY THIS. 
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES 
HERE FOR APPEAL. 
THIS IS NOT A FRIVOLOUS APPEAL. 
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT GO ALL 
THE WAY BACK TO THE FACT THAT, 
WHEN YOU FIRST DEAL WITH THAT 
BILL COSBY AND HE ENTERED INTO 
THE CIVIL LITIGATION, WAY BACK, 
THAT HE EVENTUALLY SETTLED FOR 
$3.4 MILLION WITH ANDREA 
CONSTANT, THAT HE TESTIFIED 
WITHOUT FEAR OF HIS TESTIMONY 
WITH THE BELIEF THAT HE SAYS HE 
HAD A PROMISE FROM THE PREVIOUS 
GA THAT HE WOULD NOT BE 
PROSECUTED. 
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE FIFTH 
AMENDMENT. 
HE DID NOT. 
THE STATEMENTS IN THAT 
DEPOSITION THEN EVENTUALLY, 
WHEN THE DEPOSITION GOT 
UNSEALED, SO MANY YEARS LATER, 
OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE RATHER 
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER, SOMEWHERE 
IN THE VICINITY OF 60 WOMEN, 
THAT HAVE ACCUSED BILL COSBY 
AND NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE SO 
UNTIL THAT DEPOSITION BECAME 
PUBLIC. 
>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR. 
WHEN YOU ARE SAYING THAT HE 
GAVE THE DEPOSITION, DO YOU 
BELIEVE THAT THE ATTORNEYS HAVE 
SOLID LEGAL FOOTING TO COME BACK
AND APPEAL THIS? 
>> THEY HAVE GROUNDS FOR 
APPEAL. 
WHETHER OR NOT THE CASE IS 
ULTIMATELY REVERSED IS UP TO AN 
APPELLATE COURT BUT THIS IS NOT 
JUST LAWYERS SAYING WE ARE 
GOING TO APPEAL. 
HE HAS ISSUE AFTER ISSUE AFTER 
ISSUE WITH THIS CASE.  
I WANT TO BRING IN JERICKA 
DUNCAN THAT HAS NEW DETAILS TO 
REPORT. 
>> Reporter:  I AM JUST HEARING 
FROM SOMEBODY INSIDE THAT THE 
JUDGE SAYS THAT THE COURT 
DENIED BAIL, PENDING AN APPEAL, 
BUT WILL CONSIDER ARGUMENTS 
FROM THE DEFENSE AND A MEMO 
PRESENTED TO HIM FROM THE 
COMMONWEALTH IN HIS DECISION. 
SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE 
OF ALL OF THAT. 
I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU. 
TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT 
MEANS. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY, 
PENDING AN APPEAL? 
>> DURING THE APPELLATE 
PROCESS, WHICH COULD TAKE A 
COUPLE OF YEARS, THE QUESTION 
IS, IS BILL COSBY GOING TO 
SPEND THOSE COUPLE OF YEARS IN 
PRISON AND, WITH A CHANCE THAT 
THE CASE COULD BE REVERSED ON 
APPEAL, IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAD TO DO A DAY SO IN 
LIGHT OF HIS AGE, AND WHAT 
CLEARLY APPEARS THAT HE IS NOT 
A FLIGHT RISK AND HE HAS BEEN 
HERE THROUGH ALL OF THESE 
YEARS, WHAT THE DEFENSE IS 
SAYING IS, JUDGE, WAIT A 
MINUTE. 
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE ISSUES FOR 
APPEAL. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 
WE ULTIMATELY WIN. 
BUT THEY DO HAVE MERIT. 
THE COMMONWEALTH, THE 
PROSECUTION, IS SAYING, NONE OF 
THESE ISSUES ULTIMATELY HAVE 
MERIT. 
THEY HAVE BEEN FULLY LITIGATED, 
AND THE CASE IS NOT GOING TO BE 
REVERSED. 
SO IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO FACE 
THE PIPER. 
SO WHAT IS YOUR SENSE BUT I 
KNOW THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A 
CRYSTAL BALL BUT THE WAY THAT 
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORKS, HE 
IS 81 AND HE HAS CITED HIS 
EYESIGHT AS BEING AN ISSUE, 
HEALTH ISSUES. 
WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS GOING? 
WILL HE ULTIMATELY SERVE TIME 
IN PRISON? 
>> WELL, ULTIMATELY, YES. 
WHETHER THAT IS TODAY  OR 
WHETHER THAT MAY BE YEARS FROM 
NOW,  ONE BELIEVES THAT HE IS 
GOING TO SERVE SOME OF THIS 
TIME IN PRISON, AND THIS JUDGE 
-- I CANNOT SEE THIS JUDGE 
REVERSING HIMSELF. 
I THINK THAT THIS JUDGE IS 
GOING TO SEND HIM NOW. 
AND IT WOULD BE UP TO AN 
APPELLATE COURT TO SAY, OKAY, 
WAIT A MINUTE. 
HE IS 81. 
HE MIGHT DIE BEFORE THE APPEAL 
IS EVER DECIDED. 
AND SO, WE SHOULD SEND HIM 
HOME. 
THE COMMONWEALTH, THE 
GOVERNMENT, HAS THE RIGHT TO 
SAY, LOOK, WE HAVE FACILITIES 
THAT DEAL WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE 
OLD. 
WE HAVE FACILITIES THAT DEAL 
WITH PEOPLE WITH HEALTH, 
INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF HIS 
BLINDNESS. 
THAT DOES NOT PASS HIM FROM 
THIS. 
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS A 
VERDICT FOR THE ME, TOO 
MOVEMENT? 
>> HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT. 
IT IS THE VERY FIRST CRIMINAL 
VERDICT OF GUILTY AND NOW 
SENTENCED TO PRISON THAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY. 
KEEP THIS IN MIND AS WELL. WE 
HAVE HAD TWO TRIALS OF BILL 
COSBY. 
TRIAL NUMBER ONE WHICH ENDED IN 
A HUNG JURY IN THE SUMMER OF 
2017 WAS A TRIAL THAT CAME 
BEFORE THE ONSLAUGHT OF ROGERS, 
RILEY, AS THE DOMINOES FELL TO 
HARVEY WEINSTEIN WHICH CLEARLY 
LED TO THE UN-BURDENING OF THE 
ME, TOO MOVEMENT. 
BILL COSBY THEN DOES TRIAL 
NUMBER TWO IN APRIL OF 2018, 
ALMOST A YEAR LATER, AT THE 
HEIGHT OF THE ME, TOO MOVEMENT. 
TIMING IS EVERYTHING IN LIFE. 
IF BILL COSBY HAD GONE TO TRIAL 
THE SECOND TIME BETWEEN JUNE 
AND OCTOBER OF 2017, IT IS 
POSSIBLE THEY -- I AM NOT 
SAYING THAT IT IS PROBABLE -- 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT 
HAVE HAD ANOTHER HUNG JURY.  
AND EVEN, LOOKING AT THE HUNG 
JURY THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY SAID 
THAT THERE WERE ENOUGH 
ACQUITTAL VOTES IN THAT HUNG 
JURY, I SUPPOSE IT IS -- IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE 
BEEN ACQUITTED. 
ONCE THE ME, TOO MOVEMENT 
STARTED, THERE WAS A WHOLE 
SHIFT IN HOW WE REGARD THE 
ALLEGATIONS OF ONE WOMAN, LET 
ALONE A WOMAN THAT IS THEN 
BOLSTERED, IN THIS CASE, BY 
FIVE OTHER ACCUSERS. 
SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF 
THE ME, TOO MOVEMENT, AND IT 
WILL BE A WATERSHED MOMENT. 
I WANT TO GO BACK TO JERICKA 
DUNCAN. 
WHAT IS THE REACTION FOR SOME 
OF THESE ACCUSERS THAT ARE IN 
THE COURTROOM TODAY? 
>> Reporter: AGAIN, WHAT WE 
WERE HEARING IS THAT MANY OF 
THEM, AGAIN, NOT NECESSARILY  
PART OF WHAT GOT BILL COSBY THE 
CONVICTION BUT THE ONES THAT 
HAVE BEEN HERE THROUGHOUT, THE 
FIRST, THE SECOND TRIALS AND 
SOME FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
THAT CAME AND SUPPORTED ANDREA 
COSTAND AND SOME WHO HAVE SAID 
THAT BILL COSBY SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED THEM AS WELL, WERE 
ARM IN ARM, APPARENTLY, WHEN 
THE SENTENCE WAS READ. 
SOME OF THEM WERE SOBBING AT 
TIMES, VERY EMOTIONAL. 
THE JUDGE SAID AT ONE POINT A 
JURY VERDICT MUST BE HEARD LOUD 
AND CLEAR, KIND OF GOING BACK 
TO WHAT SHE MENTIONED ABOUT HER 
NOT SEEING THE JUDGE REVERSING 
THE DECISION AND REFERENCE TO 
THIS APPEAL. 
WE SEE A FEW ACCUSERS THAT HAVE 
COME OUT. 
ONE WOMAN, YOU CANNOT SEE HER 
-- SHE ACTUALLY TESTIFIED IN 
THE SECOND TRIAL. 
I JUST SAW JANICE DICKINSON WHO 
ALSO TESTIFIED IN THE SECOND 
TRIAL. 
I THINK THAT SHE MIGHT BE 
TALKING TO OUR AFFILIATE. 
WE ARE WAITING. THERE IS A 
RECESS. 
I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SOME 
PEOPLE INSIDE. 
WE ARE GETTING NOTES FROM THEM. 
WE ARE WAITING TO GET ANY 
UPDATES. 
AGAIN, THIS IS A GOOD DAY 
WITHOUT A DOUBT FOR ANDREA 
COSTAND BECAUSE SHE SAW THIS 
THING 30. 
I EVEN REMEMBER IN THAT FIRST 
TRIAL, EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT 
END THE WAY THAT SHE WANTED, I 
REMEMBER HER POSTING A SHORT 
VIDEO ON TWITTER, WHERE SHE IS 
PLAYING BASKETBALL AND SHE SAYS 
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF 
ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH. 
WE KNOW THAT SHE IS A FORMER 
BASKETBALL PLAYER AND SHE 
ACTUALLY MET BILL COSBY WHEN 
SHE WAS WORKING AT TEMPLE 
UNIVERSITY AS THE OPERATIONS 
MANAGER. 
IT SPEAKS TO HER COMMITMENT TO 
SEEING THIS CASE THROUGH. 
HERE SHE WAS, SOMEBODY THAT 
WENT TO THE POLICE IN 2005, AND 
THE CASE WAS PRETTY MUCH CLOSED 
AFTER TWO WEEKS OF LOOKING INTO 
IT UNDER A DIFFERENT DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY. 
THE NEW EVIDENCE, INFORMATION, 
CAME FORWARD FROM THE 
DEPOSITIONS, FROM A CIVIL 
LAWSUIT, AND THAT IS WHAT 
PROMPTED THIS DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO TRY AND 
FIGURE OUT IF THEY HAD ENOUGH 
INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE TO 
PURSUE A CASE AND COME IN THAT 
CASE, THEY DECIDED THAT 
AGGRAVATED INDECENT ASSAULT WAS 
WHAT THEY COULD CHARGE BILL 
COSBY AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE 
EMAIL -- THREE YEARS AGO THAT 
THEY COULD GET A CONVICTION ON. 
AGAIN, I KNOW IN THE VERY 
BEGINNING, PEOPLE ARE JUST 
TUNING IN. 
WE WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME OF 
THE THINGS THAT ANDREA COSTAND 
SAID IN HER VICTIM IMPACT 
STATEMENT. 
I OFTEN ASK MYSELF WHY THE 
BURDEN OF BEING THE SOLE 
WITNESS IN TWO CRIMINAL TRIALS 
HAD TO FALL ON ME. 
THE PRESSURE WAS ENORMOUS. 
I HAD TO TESTIFY. 
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 
SO AGAIN, THIS SPEAKS TO 
SOMEBODY THAT HAS TALKED ABOUT 
HAVING A REALLY TOUGH TIME WITH 
THIS. 
HER MOTHER TESTIFIED YESTERDAY. 
WITH A VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT. 
HER FATHER AND HER OLDER 
SISTER. 
REALLY, THEY BASICALLY TALK 
ABOUT HOW THIS HAS CHANGED HER 
WHOLE LIFE. 
SHE DOES NOT REALLY HAVE CLOSE 
FRIENDS, SO TO SPEAK. 
SHE ONLY TRUST HER FAMILY. 
SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS HAS 
CREATED TRUST ISSUES FOR HER, 
EVEN AS AN ADULT. 
WE ARE INTERESTED IN HEARING 
FROM HER. 
WE ARE NOT SURE IF SHE WILL BE 
MAKING ANY STATEMENTS LATER. 
SHE DID NOT AFTER THE SECOND 
TRIAL, WHICH WAS THE 
CONVICTION, BUT WE IMAGINE THAT 
MAYBE SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE 
SOMETHING TO SAY TO THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC, TO THE MEDIA. 
SHE OBVIOUSLY SAID THANK YOU TO 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE VICTIM 
IMPACT STATEMENT FROM THE 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO THE TWO 
PROSECUTORS WHO ALSO WERE VERY 
DILIGENT ABOUT GETTING A 
CONVICTION. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
THAT. 
THE BURDEN OF BEING THE SOLE 
WITNESS AS SHE HAD TALKED 
ABOUT. 
PART OF THE ISSUE THAT I HEARD 
TEST -- HER TESTIMONY WAS VALUE 
BECAUSE OF THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS. 
THERE ARE FIVE DECADES OF OVER 
60 PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD, 
ACCUSING BILL COSBY. 
DO YOU EVER SEE THAT LAW 
CHANGING? 
SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE FACED 
SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE NOT BEEN 
ABLE TO COME FOR BECAUSE OF THE 
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRED. 
IS THAT EVER GOING TO CHANGE? 
>> IT IS, STATE-BY-STATE, 
LITTLE BY LITTLE. 
IT IS NOT ONLY A RESULT OF THE 
ME, TOO MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE 
REALIZE, AS A SOCIETY THAT WOMEN
DO NOT COME FORWARD IN 80% OF 
THE CASES OR MORE AT THE TIME 
THAT THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE OF 
FEAR, BECAUSE OF SHAME, BECAUSE 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
RETALIATION. 
WHAT WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED -- WE 
ARE IN PENNSYLVANIA. 
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE PREDATORY 
PRIEST CASES. 
YOU HAVE COME IN PENNSYLVANIA, 
HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS -- 
HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN THAT 
BECAME A PART, AS ADULTS, OF A 
GRAND JURY REPORT. 
ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS EXPIRED, THERE WAS 
CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE BECAUSE 
THE CHURCH HAD KEPT RECORDS OF 
THIS ABUSE AND MOVING PEOPLE 
AROUND. 
SO THIS IS HAPPENING STATE-BY-
STATE. 
WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPENING IN 
CALIFORNIA. 
WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPENING IN 
NEW YORK WERE THE STATUTE OF 
LIMITATIONS IS GOING AWAY. 
I THINK THAT IT IS PARTICULARLY 
VALUABLE, NOT ONLY IN THE CASE 
OF WOMEN AND PERHAPS MEN THAT 
HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT BUT FOR THE WORK THAT I 
HAVE DONE IT WORKING AT THE 
RAPE TREATMENT CENTER WHEN I 
WAS LIVING IN LOS ANGELES, IT 
IS CRITICAL FOR CHILDREN. 
IT IS JUST CRITICAL THAT WHAT 
HAPPENS AS A CHILD REACHES THE 
AGE OF 18 AND THEN THE STATUTE 
WAS ALWAYS TOLD UNTIL THEN BUT 
THEN IT RAN FAST. 
SO IF SOMEBODY KNOWS THAT THEY 
WERE ABUSED AS A CHILD, 
PERHAPS, REPEATEDLY BY A 
TRUSTED INDIVIDUAL, BY A LOVED 
ONE, LET ALONE A STRANGER AND 
THEY REACH THE AGE OF 18 AND 
THEY CANNOT COME TO GRIPS WITH 
IT AND IT TAKES YEARS FOR THEM 
TO GET INTO THERAPY. 
AND THEN TO GO BACK AND TALK 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BY PERHAPS 
NOT ONLY A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY 
OR A RELATIVE BUT A COACH. 
WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN IN THE 
LARRY NASSAR CASE, THIS IS 
UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNUSUAL. 
SO THE ENDING OF MANY OF THE 
STATUTES OF LIMITATION, IT WILL 
TAKE WORK. 
BUT STATE-BY-STATE, I PREDICT 
THAT EVENTUALLY THEY WILL ALL 
GO AWAY. 
>> WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
>>> REMARKABLE TO HEAR YOU SAY 
THAT. 
WE HAVE MORE DEVELOPMENTS, 
SHAMIKA DUNCAN OUT AT 
NORRISTOWN AND WE ARE EXPECTING 
THE 2:40 PM COURT TO TAKE UP 
THE ISSUE OF THE BAIL. 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT LIVE 
AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE. 
YOU CAN JOIN US THROUGHOUT THE 
AFTERNOON WITH MUCH MORE. 
THIS IS CBSN.
