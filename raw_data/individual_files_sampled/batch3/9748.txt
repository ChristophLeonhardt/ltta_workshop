LELAND: WELCOME BACK TO DELAY SOME HOUSE REPUBLICANS YOU THIS WEEK'S ATTEMPT FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM IS LIKELY TO MEET THE SAME FATE AS EVERY OTHER ATTEMPT AND NOW SOME HARDLINERS TO FUND MR. TRUMP'S WALL DESPITE A WHEN THE APPROPRIATIONS BILLS COMES UP IN THE RULING IN SEPTEMBER. I SAID THIS FOR A LONG TIME. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T GO HOME FOR THE AUGUST RECESS. I WOULD DEFINITELY SHUT DOWN THE WALL. ABSOLUTELY. HERE TO DISCUSS ON THIS FATHER'S DAY, THE VOICE OF INDIANAPOLIS TONY CAT FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA. GOOD TO SEE YOU. FIRST TO YOU. THIS IS A PRETTY BOLD PROCLAMATION BY STEVE BANNING. ARE YOU ON BOARD WITH THAT ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE MID-TERMS? DID YOU SEE A BOLD PROCLAMATION BY STEVE BANNING? I DIDN'T REALIZED THERE WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT PROCLAMATION SPICE EVENT. LELAND: ABC NEWS IS. I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE OR YOU ARE, BUT GO AHEAD. ABC NEWS CAN THINK ABOUT IT ALL THEY WISH. THAT'S TOTALLY FINE. THE IMMIGRATION CONVERSATION HAS TO COME DOWN TO WHETHER WE HAVE A BORDER OR NOT. IT HAS TO COME DOWN TO A MUCH GREATER OPEN CONVERSATION AS OPPOSED TO THE PARTISAN SCREAMING FOR STEALING CHILDREN OUT OF PEOPLE'S ARMS AND COMPARING THAT MANEUVER OF PEOPLE HAVING TO FOLLOW THE LAW. HOLD ON A SECOND. COMPARING IT TO THE HOLOCAUST. LELAND: WE ARE GOING TO GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE. I PROMISE YOU WE'LL GET TO ALL OF THAT IN A MINUTE. IN THE MEANTIME, BACK TO THE QUESTION I ORIGINALLY ASKED. GOOD IDEA TO DO AND SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER BORDER WHILE FUNDING OR NOT? SORRY. THE ANSWER IS THAT A THINK THAT'S WHAT IT WILL COME TOO. THE PRESIDENT DOES WANT THE WALL IN THE MONEY FOR THE WALL. IT IS MATTER OF SYMBOLISM. I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET. WIDGER SAID REPRESENTATIVE JOE WILSON ON THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM AND DESPITE ALL THE GOOD INTENTIONS, HE FEELS AS THOUGH THESE TWO IMMIGRATION BILLS AMOUNT OF GOOD LUCK BILL AND THE COMPROMISE BILL ARE NOT GOING TO GET THROUGH EITHER. WE WILL SEE IF IT COMES TO THAT. VERY MEL MIGHT IF YOU LISTEN TO FOLKS. DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN A CONSTRUCTIONIST VIEW ON THIS ONE. THEY VIEW IT AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE THAN SALT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS? I DO ENJOY THE PROCESS OF WATCHING REPUBLICANS CANNIBALIZE THEMSELVES ON THE MODERATE BILL AN EXTREME RIGHT BILL. WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS FIND A FUNDING MECHANISM IN CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK ON THE WALL, FIND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR THE $1.8 MILLION. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH REPUBLICAN ON ANYTHING THAT WOULD RESEMBLE A COMPROMISE THAT THEY MADE A DECISION THIS IS BETTER TO HAVE BEEN A CAMPAIGN ISSUE. MEETINGS BETWEEN CHUCK SCHUMER AND DONALD TRUMP EARLIER THIS YEAR. NANCY PELOSI IN THOSE MEETINGS. THEY ATTEMPTED TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH ON THIS ISSUE. NOT THE MODERATES IN THE CENTER OF THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OCTOBER OR RADICALIZE THIS ISSUE. REPUBLICANS ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. SPEAKING OF RADICALIZING IN THE ISSUE, TAKE A LISTEN TO ADAM SCHIFF THIS MORNING. THE ADMINISTRATION IS USING THE GRIEF, THE TEARS COME UNDER PAIN OF THESE KIDS TO BUILD THEIR WALL. LELAND: TONY, HERE IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY. WITH THEM, ADAM SCHIFF HAS ENOUGH. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE PIECE OF IT. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE BEST WAYS TO GO FORWARD ON THIS. THE IDEA OF THE TEARS ARE USED BY MORTAR AND HE'S TRYING TO BUILD THEIR. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PASSOVER CONVERSATIONS. IN A SECOND HERE, THERE SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT YOU DO WITH PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. ARE YOU GOING TO APPLY THE LAW OR NOT APPLY THE LAW? IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CHANGE POLICY COMMITTEE CAN. IF CONGRESS WANTS TO WORK TO CHANGE THE LAW, YOU CAN. THE MEETING BETWEEN SCHUMER, PELOSI AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS PRESIDENT WANTS THE WALLET IS GOING TO GET THE FUNDING OR REALLY THERE'S NOT A MOVEMENT. YOU'RE GOING TO COMPROMISE OR YOU'RE GOING TO GET NOTHING. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE WAY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON THE SUBJECT. IN 15 THE 22nd, IS IT WORTH IT FOR DEMOCRATS TO KEEP DENYING THE PRESIDENT FUNDING FOR HIS WALL? THE PRESIDENT HAS ARTICULATED WHERE THE FUNDING WILL COME FROM FOR THE FISCAL CONSERVATIVES. HOW ARE YOU PAYING FOR THE WALL? 25 BILLION COULD BE GOING TOWARDS SUPPORTING POOR FAMILIES. I SUPPORT THE TROOPS 100%. ROBERT, YOU HAVE BEEN
