1
00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:02,696
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS

2
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:02,996
THAT.

3
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:05,298
>> I THINK THAT'S THE GREAT

4
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,033
POINT ABOUT IRAN.

5
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:08,868
THE WORLD IS WATCHING.

6
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:09,803
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT SAID I'M

7
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,038
GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS BAD

8
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:14,507
IRANIAN DEAL, AND HE DID.

9
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:15,642
HE IS ALSO VERY SMARTLY SAYING

10
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:17,877
IT WILL GO THROUGH CONGRESS AND

11
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,345
PROPER CHANNELS.

12
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:19,379
SO THE NEXT PRESIDENT CAN'T WIPE

13
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,649
IT OUT WITH A WAVE OF THE PEN.

14
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,751
>> EVERYTHING THE PRESIDENT HAS

15
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:28,221
DONE IN JUST OVER 500 DAYS IS

16
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,356
BIGGER THAN THE SPECIFIC EVENTS.

17
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:32,025
SO THE CREW WAS MISSILE

18
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:33,560
ENGAGEMENT IN SYRIA, THAT SENDS

19
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,596
A MESSAGE FOR THE RACEMIC.

20
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:38,298
IF THAT'S THE REASSERTION OF

21
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:39,432
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND THAT

22
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,368
SENDS A MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA

23
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:42,736
AND IRAN, EVEN TO OTHER

24
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:46,206
COUNTRIES SUCH AS RUSSIA.

25
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,041
SO EVERY SINGLE ACT HAS A LARGE

26
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,776
STRATEGIC MESSAGE TO THE WORLD

27
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:52,178
AND THAT'S WHY THIS PRESIDENCY

28
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,649
WITH HIS TEAM, LET'S NOT FORGET.

29
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:56,850
IT'S A PALE AND BOLTON.

30
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,020
>> THE PRESIDENT, YOU CALLED

31
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,521
LAST NIGHT, THE SPEED OF TRUMP.

32
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:04,257
>> THE SPEED OF TRUMP.

33
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,092
BUT LET'S REMIND OURSELVES, HE'S

34
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:07,994
BEEN IN OFFICE LESS THAN SIX

35
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:08,662
MONTHS.

36
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:10,030
THESE RESULTS, YOU WOULD BE

37
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,232
PROUD OF THESE AT THE END OF

38
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:14,467
YOUR SECOND TERM AS PRESIDENT.

39
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:17,270
HE HAS NOT EVEN HALFWAY THROUGH

40
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,737
HIS FIRST TERM.

41
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,507
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE IS A

42
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,475
MOMENT IN HISTORY EMERGING TO

43
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:24,611
THE MIDDLE EAST, ALSO.

44
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,180
THE JORDANIANS, EGYPTIANS,

45
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,616
SAUDIS, EMIRATES AND IS REAL,

46
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:30,216
AND THE U.S.

47
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,653
>> IF I MAY COME ALL OF THIS IS

48
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:34,854
THE GEOPOLITICAL RESTRUCTURING

49
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:37,457
GLOBALLY, WHETHER IT'S THE

50
00:01:37,457 --> 00:01:39,459
MIDDLE EAST, HERE IN ASIA OR

51
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:40,427
EUROPE.

52
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,228
AND AMERICA LEADING THE FRONT.

53
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:44,531
BECAUSE WHAT IS THE KEY MESSAGE?

54
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:45,265
FOR EIGHT YEARS THE WHITE HOUSE

55
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,934
SAID IT, WE WILL NOT LEAVE.

56
00:01:47,934 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO COME UP THE
