1
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:07,660
>> Bill: THE RACE IS ON TO FILL

2
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:08,727
RETIRING SENATOR BOB CORKER'S

3
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:11,030
SEAT IN TENNESSEE APPEARS TO BE

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:11,864
A CLOSE ONE.

5
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:15,868
REAL CLEAR POLLING AVERAGE HAS

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:16,802
THE REPUBLICAN BLACKBURN

7
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:19,872
LEADING BREDESEN BY SIX POINTS.

8
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,540
MARSHA BLACKBURN IS WITH ME NOW.

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,042
I SAW A POLL THAT SHOWS YOUR

10
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:24,577
OPPONENT UP A POINT.

11
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,778
WHAT'S GOING ON IN TENNESSEE ON

12
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,213
THIS RACE?

13
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:28,481
>> I TELL YOU, THERE WILL BE

14
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:29,548
ALL SORTS OF POLLS.

15
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:32,284
THE ONLY ONE THAT COUNTS IS

16
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:33,853
NOVEMBER 6 ON ELECTION DAY.

17
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,287
WE INTEND TO WIN THIS RACE.

18
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:36,689
WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE.

19
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,125
>> Bill: SO THE PRESIDENT RIGHT

20
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:42,228
NOW IS DOING A FOUR-STATE SWING.

21
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,896
HIS STRATEGY IS OBVIOUS.

22
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:44,864
HE IS PUTTING IMMIGRATION ON

23
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,166
THE FOREFRONT OF A LOT OF MINDS

24
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,801
OF AMERICAN VOTERS ESPECIALLY

25
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:50,536
WHEN IT COMES TO ARIZONA TODAY

26
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:51,637
AND TEXAS ON MONDAY.

27
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:54,473
IS THAT A BIG DEAL IN TENNESSEE?

28
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,510
>> IT IS SUCH A BIG DEAL.

29
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,312
THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF LOOSE

30
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:01,013
IMMIGRATION POLICIES, EVERY

31
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:02,648
STATE IS A BORDER STATE AND

32
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,316
EVERY TOWN IS A BORDER TOWN.

33
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:08,020
AND IN MY RACE IN THE U.S.

34
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:10,389
SENATE WHEN PHIL BREDESEN WAS

35
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,925
COVER NOR HE ISSUED VALID STATE

36
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:16,462
ISSUE TAXPAYER FUNDED DRIVING

37
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:17,863
CERTIFICATES TO 51,000 ILLEGAL

38
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:18,197
ALIENS.

39
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:21,166
HE MADE OUR STATE A MAGNET FOR

40
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,067
ILLEGAL ALIENS.

41
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,502
AND PEOPLE IN TENNESSEE

42
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:23,969
REMEMBER THAT.

43
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,238
THEY DID NOT LIKE THE POLICIES.

44
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,741
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD TO GO

45
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:30,876
IN AND CHANGE THAT POLICY, SHUT

46
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:31,577
IT DOWN.

47
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:33,012
AND PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN

48
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:36,015
THAT WE SECURE OUR BORDERS AND

49
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:37,783
WE END SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES.

50
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:40,386
>> Bill: HE IS A PRETTY POPULAR

51
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:40,753
GOVERNOR.

52
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:42,721
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD RACE.

53
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,156
I MENTION THE ISSUE ABOUT

54
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:44,557
IMMIGRATION.

55
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:45,791
THIS IS WHAT OUR FOX POLLING

56
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,660
FOUND OUT A FEW DAYS AGO.

57
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,762
THEY PUT HEALTHCARE AS THE

58
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:50,930
NUMBER ONE ISSUE FACING

59
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,131
AMERICANS, THE ECONOMY IS

60
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:54,667
NUMBER TWO, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

61
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:55,367
NUMBER THREE.

62
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:56,435
TAKE NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER

63
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:58,170
THREE FOR A MOMENT HERE.

64
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,338
PERHAPS THE ECONOMY SLIDES TO

65
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:00,306
NUMBER TWO BECAUSE THINGS ARE

66
00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:01,941
GOING WELL FOR A LOT OF FOLKS

67
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:02,408
RIGHT NOW.

68
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,143
HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT PLAY IN

69
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:08,380
TENNESSEE IN THIS VOTE?

70
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:09,682
>> TENNESSEE APPRECIATES DONALD

71
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:09,982
TRUMP.

72
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:14,086
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

73
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:17,656
WE HAVE KAVANAUGH ON THE

74
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:18,824
SUPREME COURT, TENNESSEANS

75
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:19,758
REALLY LIKE THAT.

76
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,161
THEY SUPPORTED BRETT KAVANAUGH

77
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:24,964
AND THEY WANTED HIM CONFIRMED.

78
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,131
THEY'RE SO GLAD PRESIDENT TRUMP

79
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:28,200
STOOD WITH HIM AND I TELL YOU

80
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,302
WHAT THEY DO LIKE, TOO, IS

81
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:31,036
LINDSEY GRAHAM'S COMMENTS.

82
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,606
HOW HE CAME TO THE DEFENSE OF

83
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,642
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND CALLED OUT

84
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:38,944
THE DEMOCRATS FOR PLAYING

85
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:39,511
POLITICS WITH THIS.

86
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:43,215
SO YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE

87
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,150
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES KEEPING

88
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,686
TAX CUTS, JOBS AND THE ECONOMY,

89
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:51,156
KEEPING THAT GOING, THE

90
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:51,657
IMMIGRATION ISSUE.

91
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,959
TENNESSEANS WANT TO GET THE

92
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OFF THE

93
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,361
BOOKS.

94
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,762
THE REASON IS THAT HAS DRIVEN

95
00:02:56,763 --> 00:03:00,766
UP THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE

96
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,201
IN TENNESSEE BY 176%.

97
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:05,404
>> Bill: YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR

98
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:09,608
OPPONENT WOULD SAY GET RID OF

99
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:10,242
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

100
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:11,243
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS GOING ON THE

101
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:11,543
ROAD.

102
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:14,146
I THINK HE IS GOING TO 12

103
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:14,647
DIFFERENT STATES.

104
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,781
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR HIS

105
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:17,416
TRAVEL IS TO REMIND PEOPLE

106
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,051
ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH

107
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:19,485
CONFIRMATION.

108
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:21,620
DOES THAT THEN SUGGEST IN A

109
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:23,489
NEWS CYCLE THE KHURNS EVERY

110
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,058
HOUR OF EVERY DAY THE KAVANAUGH

111
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,926
BUMP MAY BE DISSIPATING FOR

112
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:28,327
REPUBLICANS?

113
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:30,262
>> NO, IT IS NOT DISSIPATING.

114
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:32,131
I STARTED MY MORNING HERE IN

115
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:34,533
CHATTANOOGA WITH A GROUP OF

116
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,701
VETERANS OVER AT THE VFW.

117
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:38,270
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY

118
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,839
TALKED ABOUT WAS HAVING GOOD

119
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,175
FEDERAL JUDGES AND HAVING GOOD

120
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:43,909
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.

121
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,512
AND THE REASON IT IS SO

122
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:49,181
IMPORTANT TO THEM IS NOT

123
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:50,349
NECESSARILY ABOUT TODAY, IT IS

124
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,418
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR

125
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,319
GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR FUTURE

126
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,054
AND PRESERVING THESE FREEDOMS

127
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:57,489
THAT THEY PUT ON THE UNIFORM

128
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,757
AND THEY FOUGHT FOR.

129
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:01,593
SO THEY BRING IT UP.

130
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,228
OUR TENNESSEANS BRING THIS UP

131
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,831
IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE

132
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:06,532
CONVERSATION.

133
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,667
AND I AM REALLY DELIGHTED THAT

134
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:11,236
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS GOING TO BE

135
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:12,404
REMINDING PEOPLE ABOUT THIS

136
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:13,305
BATTLE.

137
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,207
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SO MANY

138
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,309
PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN

139
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,411
HERE IN TENNESSEE, WATCH WHAT

140
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:20,945
WAS CARRIED OUT AGAINST JUSTICE

141
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,214
KAVANAUGH AND THEY SAID WHAT IF

142
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,449
THAT WERE MY HUSBAND OR MY

143
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,017
BROTHER OR MY SON?

144
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,820
WHAT IF THEY WERE DENIED AN

145
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:28,754
OPPORTUNITY?

146
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:31,090
WHY IS HE CONSIDERED GUILTY?

147
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,658
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INNOCENT

148
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,359
UNTIL WE'RE PROVEN GUILTY.

149
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,695
AND THAT REALLY KIND OF STRUCK

150
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,797
THE CORD OF FAIRNESS WITH

151
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,232
PEOPLE IN TENNESSEE AND THEY

152
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,334
WANT TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE

153
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,436
GOING TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND

154
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:45,137
HAVE DUE PROCESS.

155
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:47,272
>> Bill: YOU WONDER IF IT CUTS

156
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:48,674
DIFFERENTLY BETWEEN MEN AND

157
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:48,974
WOMEN.

158
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:50,309
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN 18

159
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,809
DAYS.

160
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,844
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WELL TWO

161
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,378
YEARS AGO IN TENNESSEE.

162
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,914
SHOULD THIS RACE RIGHT NOW BE

163
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,082
AT SIX POINTS?

164
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,586
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, PHIL

165
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:03,188
BREDESEN -- THIS IS HIS FOURTH

166
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,425
STATEWIDE RACE AND HE HAS THAT

167
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,293
STATEWIDE NAME I.D., AND WE

168
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,962
KNEW IT WOULD BE A TIGHT RACE.

169
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,531
HE HAS ALL THE MEDIA AND MONEY

170
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,867
WORKING WITH HIM.

171
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:17,069
CHUCK SCHUMER, MIKE BLOOMBURG.

172
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,003
THE DEMOCRAT ORGANIZATION HAVE

173
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:20,372
PUMPED A LOT OF MONEY INTO

174
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:20,739
TENNESSEE.

175
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,907
THEY'RE PUMPING IT IN HERE

176
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:23,442
REALLY AS FAST AS THEY CAN.

177
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,376
>> Bill: WE'RE WATCHING IT

178
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:24,710
CLOSELY.

179
00:05:24,711 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
