♪ ♪ Sean: JOINING US WITH REACTION TO THE LEFT WING RESPONSE TO THE ON-GOING SUPREME I CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE. I? I WILL SAY IT. I AM PREGNANT! Sean: . NO, HE WAS JUST APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT. I JUST SELF-IDENTIFIED. YOU ARE MY GUEST. I WILL INTERVIEW YOU FOR AN HOUR. Sean: THAT ROLE REVERSAL THING IS WEIRD FOR ME. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. MARK, YOU ARE PROBABLY BEST KNOWN FOR YOUR RUN AWAY BEST LONG BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE. YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS WHAT THE LEFT CAN ACCOMPLISH IN AN ELECTION. WHAT THEY CAN'T ACCOMPLISH. THEY WANT TO IGNORE SEPARATIONS OF POWERS CO-EQUAL BRANCHES AND THEY WANT THINGS LEGISLATED FROM THE BENCH. THIS PRESIDENT WANTS TO CHOOSE AN ORIGINALIST. GO THROUGH THEIR REACTION TO THIS OPENING NOW AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE COUNTRY. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROGRESSIVE IDEALOGY ON THE LEFT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTITUTION. THEY TURNED THE SUPREME COURT INTO A ALL-POWERFUL, CENTRALIZED POLITICAL OPERATION WHERE THEY WANT TO CONTROL A MAJORITY OF THE SEATS. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION OR TALK THIS THIS ARTICLE OR THIS SECTION OR CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION. WHEN YOU HEAR THEM YACK AWAY ON THE OTHER NETWORKS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION ON DEMAND. SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND OBAMACARE AND OPEN BORDERS. THEY GIVE YOU THE SAME LEFT WING AGENDA AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OR THE SENATE WHAT THEY WANT IN A NOMINEE. WE DON'T WANT A CONSERVATIVE. WE DON'T WANT A LIBERAL. WE WANT A CONSTITUTIONALIST. LOOKS AT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE WORDS. TAKES THEM THIS CONTEXT. TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS AND APPLIES IT. THE PARTIES BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT'S WHAT THE JUSTICES WILL DO. THE DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU DON'T NOMINATE RUTH BADER GINSBERG IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, WE WILL OPPOSE WHOMEVER YOU NOMINATE. THE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO STEAM ROLL THE DEMOCRATS. THAT'S OKAY. THE DEMOCRATS DON'T MAKE SENSE. NOW THEY OPPOSE FILIBUSTERS. NOW THEY OPPOSE IT IN MID-TERM ELECTIONS. FORGET ABOUT SCHUMER AND THE DEMOCRATS. LET US UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION. THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS THAT. HE RAN FOR OFFICE AND HAD A LIST. HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T HAVE FRANKLY. BUT THIS PRESIDENT HAD A LIST. HE HAS TREMENDOUS CANDIDATES ON THIS LIST. HE SAID I WILL CHOOSE FROM THIS PRESIDENT IS STICKING TO THE LIST. THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE MORE POWERFUL IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT. IT'S GOTTEN WAY OUT OF WHACK. THE ATTITUDES OF THE PROGRESSIVES WHO USED TO ATTACK THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN BY A BUNCH OF WHITE MEN WHO OWNED SLAVE. NOW THEY PRETEND TO SUPPORT IT. THE POSITION OF THE LEFT: THEY WANT TO ENSHRINE THEIR IDEALOGY INTO THE CONSTITUTION. WHEN THEY SAY SUPPORT PRECEDENT, WAS PRESIDENT. SEGREGATION WAS PRECEDENT. NO, WHAT THEY MEAN IS THE MOST RADICAL DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IN. NOT THE CONSTITUTION. BUT THE LEFTIST DIRECTION THAT THE COURTS HAVE TAKEN THE CONSTITUTION. Sean: YOU WROTE "MEN IN BLACK." IN 2005, I THINK. Sean: ONE OF THE REASONS WE GAME FRIENDS AND I THINK WE WENT INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT. MARK, WE BECAME FRIENDS BECAUSE OF ISSUES. I WILL TELL A LITTLE BIT OF THE STORY. FOR ME ON RADIO. TWIST YOUR ARM TO DO A WEEKEND SHOW. TWIST TO IT DO 6 TO 9. TO BE HONEST, IT'S BEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN TWISTING YOUR ARM TO COME ON THIS TV SHOW. NOW YOU ARE HERE. NOW YOU FLIPPED IT AND I HAVE TO TOGETHER. I WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. I WANT YOUR VIEWERS TO KNOW SOMETHING. WE JUST DID THIS INTERVIEW. I WANT THE VIEWERS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON TV. YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL BRACKED. HOLD ON YOU GIVE ME 20 BUCKS, I HAVE TO FINISH. I WANT THE PEOPLE TO KNOW THE REAL SEAN HANNITY. THAT WILL HAPPEN. Sean: I DID SOMETHING A LOT OF LIBERALS DO. HE TRIED TO GET ME TO TALK IT ME AND I TALKED ABOUT ISSUES. STOP IT, TALK ABOUT YOU. YOUR LOVE OF THIS CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN YOUR LIFE STUDY. IMPORTANT. IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT, WE WILL LOSE THIS COUNTRY. OF ALL OF OUR LAWS. YOU ARE HAVE HEAVYWEIGHT ON ALL OF THIS. LET ME SAY ONE THING. THE PROGRESSIVES DON'T OWN THE CEMENT. THEY SUPREME COURT. STOP! Sean: YOU LIKE MIKE LEE? I THINK HE WOULD BE OUTSTANDING. Sean: HE IS BRILLIANT. A GREAT CHOICE. MARK, LIFE, LIBERTY AND LEVIN EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT ON CABLE AT
