1
00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:02,253
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THE DEPUTY

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:05,256
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI WAS ACTUALLY

3
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,557
FIRED FOR MISCONDUCT.

4
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:07,491
THE PRESIDENT IS CONCERNED ABOUT

5
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:11,829
THE MATTER.

6
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,564
AND WE WILL GO FROM THERE.

7
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,733
>> Bret: SO TREY GOWDY HAS

8
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,102
BEEN BREACHED IN THE CLASSIFIED

9
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,069
BRIEFING AND HE SAID HE DOESN'T

10
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,105
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT THE FBI

11
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,574
DATED AS FAR AS AN INFORMANT IN

12
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,910
AND AROUND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,744
HERE WAS THE PRESIDENT LAST

14
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,946
NIGHT.

15
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,147
>> President Trump: HOW DO YOU

16
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:32,482
LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY HAD

17
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,151
PEOPLE INFILTRATING OUR

18
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:35,352
CAMPAIGN?

19
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:37,922
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

20
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,390
>> IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

21
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,558
HIMSELF WHO SAID NUMBER ONE I

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,326
DIDN'T COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA BUT

23
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,295
IF ANYONE CONNECTED WITH THAT

24
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,095
THE CAMPAIGN DATA, I WOULD LIKE

25
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,897
TO FIND THAT OUT.

26
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:51,302
>> WHAT WORRIES ME IS BEYOND THE

27
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:55,306
RUSSIANS THEMSELVES, OR THEY ARE

28
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:59,109
MAKING ATTACKS AGAINST THE WHOLE

29
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:08,986
OF THE FBI.

30
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:09,620
AND, A.B. STODDARD IS THE

31
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,823
ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR.

32
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,060
THAT'S ALSO ON THE RADIO, AND

33
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,931
OUR GUEST IS HOLDING DOWN THE

34
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:22,366
FORT.

35
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,535
I THINK WE NEED TO PAY VERY

36
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:25,903
CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT TROY

37
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,971
GAUDI IS SAYING BECAUSE HE HAS

38
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,540
EXTRAORDINARY ACCESS TO ACTUAL

39
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,041
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS.

40
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,643
WE ALL CHATTER ABOUT IT AND

41
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:34,344
SPECULATE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT,

42
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,115
BUT HE KNOWS MORE THAN 99.9% OF

43
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,918
US DO BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN AN

44
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:42,619
ACTUAL.

45
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,687
SO WHEN THIS WAS AN

46
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,288
APPROPRIATELY PREDICATED

47
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,122
INVESTIGATION AND THE INFORMANT

48
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,925
WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS

49
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,459
NOT A SPY, OR ACTING

50
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:56,533
INAPPROPRIATELY IN ANY WAY, AND,

51
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,935
WE ARE IN THAT ELEMENT OF OUR

52
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,836
INTERVIEW, BUT THE QUOTE ALSO TO

53
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:03,740
ME THAT STICKS OUT, HE SAID "IT

54
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,543
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

55
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,110
DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF."

56
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,014
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.

57
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,249
WHAT HE WAS EXAMINING IS NOT

58
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:15,419
TARGETING THE PRESIDENT AND THAT

59
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:15,752
MATTERS.

60
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,087
>> AS YOU LOOK AT THE COVERAGE

61
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,990
AROUND THE HORN, THE SECOND PART

62
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,857
REALLY GOT CHOPPED OFF.

63
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:23,927
>> THE FIRST PART GOT IGNORED,

64
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:24,995
THE SECOND PART -- I THINK THERE

65
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:27,264
ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS TO

66
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:29,099
EXPLAIN THIS.

67
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,601
ONE, TREY GOWDY HAS MORE TRUST

68
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,802
IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THEN

69
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,137
DEVIN NUNES DOES.

70
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,338
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR

71
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:36,106
HERE.

72
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:40,777
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE

73
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:46,316
HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT NUNEZ.

74
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,919
BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING

75
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,522
IS, THE HOUSE WAS TRYING TO GET

76
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,324
DOCUMENTS, AND WE ARE TRYING TO

77
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,526
SEE FOR EXAMPLE, DID THE

78
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,294
INFORMANT ISSUE GIVE REPORTS TO

79
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:58,595
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT?

80
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,331
IF THE INFORMANT TALKED TO

81
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,399
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, DID HE

82
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,567
WRITE IT UP?

83
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,835
THE FACT IS, THEY HAVEN'T SEEN

84
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:06,703
THAT STUFF YET.

85
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:07,404
SO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CAN

86
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:11,908
SAY, WE ARE FOLLOWING ALL THE

87
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:12,209
ROLLS.

88
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,577
BUT THE HOUSE HASN'T SEEN THE

89
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,545
STUFF YET.

90
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,180
>> Bret: THE OTHER QUESTION

91
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,116
IS, IF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS

92
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,551
GETTING CLASSIFIED BRIEFING IS

93
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,519
AS PRESIDENT-ELECT, WHY IS HE

94
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,521
NOT IN THE LOOP IF IT HAD

95
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,755
NOTHING TO DO WITH

96
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:26,223
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

97
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:27,891
WHY WAS HE NOT TOLD WHAT THE

98
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:31,061
INFORMANT IS TRYING TO DO ABOUT

99
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:36,466
FINDING ANY RUSSIA CONNECTION.

100
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,936
>> ONE WOULD THINK HE HAD THEM

101
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:40,937
ALONG THE WAY.

102
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:46,076
HE WAS TOLD THIS WAS HAPPENING,

103
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:51,681
AND PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING AND

104
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:52,415
THEY ARE IMPUTING HIS INTEGRITY

105
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,851
AND HIS MOTIVE TODAY.

106
00:03:54,851 --> 00:04:12,535
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT AND

107
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:13,536
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT AND

108
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:14,270
BECAUSE IN THE FEVER SWAMPS, AND

109
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,038
IN TRAVEL BATTLE, PEOPLE WANT TO

110
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:15,738
PAINT THIS LIKE HE IS A SECRET

111
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:16,072
LORETTA

112
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:16,738
LYNCH-HILLARY CLINTON-OBAMA

113
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,473
PARTISAN, FIGHTING TO COVER UP A

114
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:17,874
CORRUPT FBI.

115
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:18,608
HE'S DOING THIS BECAUSE HE KNOWS

116
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,341
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING IS

117
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,043
WHAT SENATOR WARNER DESCRIBES.

118
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:20,810
HE'S LAUNCHING AN ASSAULT ON THE

119
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,444
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND

120
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,178
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS THAT

121
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:22,545
WE DEPEND ON IN THIS

122
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,354
AND IT'S WORKING.

123
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,022
IF THIS IS A CAMPAIGN TO

124
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,158
DISCREDIT BOB MUELLER'S FINDINGS

125
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:38,494
AND NOTHING ELSE, TRUMP KNOWS

126
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,228
THERE WAS NO SPY INFILTRATING

127
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:42,865
HIS CAMPAIGN.

128
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:48,071
AND THEY WERE CHECKING HE'S

129
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,939
DOING IT ANYWAY.

130
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,944
HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY

131
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,145
SET ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION

132
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:56,479
OVERALL.

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,347
>> PEOPLE KIND OF GOT EXHAUSTION

134
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,750
FROM THE DAY TODAY, BACK AND

135
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,984
FORTH OF THIS STORY.

136
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,921
I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WILL

137
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:09,859
BE TIRED OF IT, IF THIS IS NOT

138
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,562
WOUND DOWN IN THIS CALENDAR

139
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:12,862
YEAR.

140
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,198
>> I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

141
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:15,932
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT IS

142
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,134
LOOKING INTO THIS WHO WAS REALLY

143
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,803
AGGRESSIVE IN THE BEGINNING.

144
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:25,508
AND, SEEMS TO BE SAYING, WE NEED

145
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,443
TO WRAP THIS THING UP.

146
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:29,178
>> BASICALLY ECHOING THE

147
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:30,146
VICE PRESIDENT FROM A FEW WEEKS

148
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,114
AGO URGING ROBERT MUELLER TO GET

149
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,282
THIS THING FINISHED UP SOON.

150
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:37,019
I THINK IT MAKES SENSE ON SOME

151
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,120
LEVEL, INVESTIGATIONS DON'T NEED

152
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,755
TO BE UNENDING AND FOREVER WHICH

153
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,390
SEEMS TO BE THE STANDARD THAT

154
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,059
SOME CRITICS WANT IN THIS CASE,

155
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,660
WHICH IS THE CLOUD THAT

156
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,333
CONTINUES TO HANG OVER HIM.

157
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,535
THAT WILL PREVENT OTHER HOSTILE

158
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,537
POWERS FROM -- IT WOULD BE NICE

159
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,205
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE

160
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,340
NEXT ELECTION.

161
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,008
SO WHAT WARNER SAID THERE, I

162
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,943
THINK YOU ARE RIGHT, IT IS

163
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,811
SIGNIFICANT.

164
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:06,115
A DEMOCRAT SAYING, OKAY, LET'S

165
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,818
GO.

166
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,954
>> Bret: "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"

167
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,124
AND WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK ON IN

168
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:15,157
AND WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK ON IT

169
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,860
AND WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK ON IE

170
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,698
GAME.

171
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:26,502
THE SESSION WAS NEVER AGAINST --

172
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,137
RECUSE HIMSELF, AND IF HE WAS

173
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,138
GOING TO RECUSE HIMSELF, HE

174
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:29,939
SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME BEFORE THE

175
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,508
JOB AND I WOULD HAVE PICKED

176
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:33,943
SOMEONE ELSE.

177
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,644
>> WEEK THEY TOLD ME LATER, ALL

178
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:38,047
BY THE WAY, I'M NOT GOING TO BE

179
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,181
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE.

180
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,683
IN THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE IN

181
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,952
THE OFFICE, I'D BE FRUSTRATED,

182
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:44,353
TOO.

183
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:46,155
>> I THINK THE SOUND YOU PLAYED

184
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,223
FROM THE PRESIDENT IS FROM JULY

185
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:49,158
OF LAST YEAR.

186
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,726
HE STILL MAD ABOUT IT AND HE'S

187
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:53,329
ALWAYS GOING TO BE MAD ABOUT IT,

188
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,631
BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT THAT

189
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,432
THE GROUNDS THAT SESSIONS USED
