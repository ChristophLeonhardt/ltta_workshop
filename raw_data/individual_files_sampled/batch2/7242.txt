will your commission look at the role of firearms as it relates to gun violence in their schools that is not part of the Commission's charge per se Betsy Betsy Betsy just when I thought you couldn't get any worse after the whole barrels of the real threat to our kids and that's why we need guns thing I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential Grizzlies you're going out to yourself you see just this week divorce said that guns will not be a primary topic in discussions for the new federal Commission on violence in schools a decision that baffled most same people you know like Senator Patrick Leahy a Democrat from Vermont who posed a seemingly obvious hypocrisy of someone studying gun violence but not considering the role of guns but would Betsy like most in the Trump administration when you peel back a layer or two you start to uncover what's that smell again oh yeah rife in competency in conflicts of interest and nothing says conflict of interest like Betsy divorce you know the same woman Hill bent on chasing up aa student loan debt why you may ask well because of course a company that once had financial ties to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was one of two firms selected by the Education Department to help the agency collect overdue student loans the deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars but that's not fishy at all right and then after recently doing everything she can to avoid discussing guns in her attempts to combat violence in schools because what twenty-five school shootings this year alone isn't a red flag right a report by our very own 280 investigates identified that in her recent commission discussing measures to improve school safety devos failed to mention that she invested 1 million dollars in a company called X elitist that makes accessories for firearms now I know hold your horses I know the Second Amendment trolls have already flooded the feed screaming they don't just make gun scopes they make other cool things like x-rays and stuff and how is she supposed to know where all her money is going to which I would respond by simply referring to the previous example and divorce is lengthy track record of investments directly related to the fields she is supposed to be making unbiased is about free from financial incentives so now pardon me if I don't buy the she just wants to invest in the highest quality dental optics and microscopes argument the point is that someone who is supposed to be identifying and highlighting areas of concern relating to violence in schools should one not be avoiding it and putting her focus on a non-existent bear problem as if she's bloody Leonardo DiCaprio and - she should be disclosing such investments as it's still a conflict of interest even if they sell two scopes a year Jesus are people that desperate to avoid gun control that they'll wilfully lower themselves to divorces level because I want a woman that's a slippery slope before you know it you'll be thrown out your microwave because Kelly and Conway told you so President Obama the reality has gun control and gun violence should of course be atop the list in regards to issues involving violence within our schools man we got kindergarteners in Massachusetts learning a song to the tune of twinkle twinkle little star that details what to do during a school shooting to ensure safety instead of you know actually enacting measures to help prevent the risk of such an atrocity happening again but this shouldn't surprise us one bit considering the folks we have leading the way Betsy but Ron I'll take measures to remove Goldilocks from schools because she was really putting herself in danger when she dined with those three little bells instead of talking about the number one danger to school kids guns follow me on instagram at Francis and Mike Shawn on Twitter also Francis and Mike so as always like and share the video you can get the TYT app here continue to resist
