â™ª AINSLEY: HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? BRIAN: IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME KIRSTJEN NIELSEN GOVERNOR HUCKABEE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. WHERE IS THE MANAGEMENT HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO YOUR TED CRUZ YOU JUST WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR WIFE AND YOU GET SCREAMED AND AT PROTESTED A AND FORCED OUT OF THE RESTAURANT. STEVE: THEY WEREN'T FORCED OUT OF THE RESTAURANT. THE RESTAURANT ESCORTED THEM TO A PRIVATE AREA. AINSLEY: THEY DID PROTECT. STEVE: THEY WENT IN AND FINISHED THEIR MEAL. RON DESANTIS IS A GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE. YOU KNOW HIM A MEMBER OF CONGRESS ON HOLD RIGHT NOW. MR. DESANTIS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF GOING ON A NUMBER OF PROTESTERS WHO SEE PUBLIC FIGURES AND THEN JUST KIND OF TRY TO DRIVE THEM OFF? I THINK THE LEFT IS TOTALLY UNHINGED AND THEY HAVE BEEN. IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THEY DID TO SENATOR CRUZ. OBVIOUSLY YOU SAW THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS WHICH IS A TOTAL DISGRACE. THIS STUFF CAN BE REALLY DANGEROUS. IF YOU REMEMBER, LAST YEAR, OUR REPUBLICAN BASEBALL PRACTICE WAS SHOT UP BY ONE OF THESE LEFT WING ACTIVISTS. SO THIS IS REALLY, REALLY A BAD ROAD TO GO DOWN. AND, YOU KNOW, LOOK, IF I WAS A PRO-FRIRT OF THAT STUFF I WOULD HAVE NO TOLERANCE OF THAT STUFF IN MY ESTABLISHMENT. YOU WANT PEOPLE TO EAT IN PEACE. STEVE: THEY DID ESCORT THEM INTO PRIVACY. BOTTOM LINE IS IF I WALKED INTO A BAR OR RESTAURANT AND I STARTED THROWING PUNCHES, I WOULD BE TOSSED OFF. THESE PEOPLE WALKING AND SCREAMING AND NOW THE SENATOR AND HIS WIFE HAVE TO LEAVE. WHY IS THIS ALLOWED? THIS ANARCHY, BLAMING HIM FOR RED TIDE GOT HIM THROWN OUT OF THE RESTAURANT. WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR STATE? YOU HAVE FAR LEFT WING FRINGE REPRESENTED BY ANDREW GILLUM. THEY ARE RADICAL AND GOING TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN NORMAL PROCESSES TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM. THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY SAUL ABOUT. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE CIVILITY. THAT'S BEEN TOSSED OUT THE WINDOW. AINSLEY: THE RESTAURANT DID SEND OUT A TWEET. THE RESTAURANT IS CALLED FEE WHEN THE SITUATION RESOLVED THE GUEST RETURNED TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND FINISH THEIR EXCEPTIONAL MEAL. YOU MENTIONED WITH HECKLERS COME INTO THE MIDDLE OF A ASTRONAUT JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. IT'S AWFUL. I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN THERE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IT JUST DELAYS EVERYTHING. THAT'S IN FRONT OF A GROUP. IT'S NOT AS EMBARRASSING. IF YOU ARE SINGLED OUT AND SOMEONE VIDEOTAPES IT AND GOES NATIONAL. ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT IS JUST AN INVASION OF PEOPLE'S PEACE OF MIND AND PRIFSZ TO HAVE A MEAL WITH YOUR FAMILY. JUST TACTICS THAT I THINK MOST AMERICANS REJECT. STEVE: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS. THEY ARE CALLING ON ROD ROSENSTEIN EITHER TESTIFY IN FRONT OF THEM OR QUIT. WE DO KNOW THAT HE IS GOING TO SHOW UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE MEMOS THAT HE APPARENTLY WROTE RATHER, ANDY MCCABE WROTE DISCUSSING THAT ROSENSTEIN HAD OFFERED TO WEAR A WIRE AND DISCUSS THE WHOLE 25TH AMENDMENT THING, LET'S GET RID OF THE PRESIDENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE HOUSE DEMANDING THIS? WELL, HE NEEDS TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. I MEAN, IF THAT IS TRUE, CLEARLY, THAT'S DISQUALIFYING. TO TALK ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT, THAT IS JUST TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS. TO SAY YOU ARE GOING TO RUN A SURVEILLANCE OPERATION AGAINST A SITTING PRESIDENT FOR NO REASON? AND OBVIOUSLY HE APPOINTED A SPECIAL COUNSEL WITHOUT HAVING GOOD REASON. SO HE WAS BUNGLING A LOT OF THINGS AROUND THAT TIME PERIOD. BUT, I WOULD SAY THIS. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TO RUN THAT I'M JUST SKEPTICAL ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATIONS. I WONDER WHETHER IT'S TIED TO MCCABE. MCCABE OBVIOUSLY ISN'T TERRIBLY CREDIBLE. I DO THINK HE NEEDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS UNDER OATH. IF HE DID DO IT, THEN IT'S DISQUALIFYING. BRIAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR RACE YOU SAID ENOUGH OF WASHINGTON I HAVE GOT TO FOCUS ON FLORIDA. YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST ANDREW GILLUM ON THE LEFT. IS HE WAY TO THE LEFT ON THE LEFT. MOST POLLS YOU ARE TRAILING, YET, YOU ARE REPLACING A GOVERNOR WHO IS HANDING OVER A STATE IN SURPLUS THAT BY ALMOST ALL ACCOUNTS IS DOING EXCEEDINGLY WELL. WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU HAVE TO GET OUT RON DESANTIS? MY MESSAGE AND VISION FOR FLORIDA IS LET'S BUILD UP THE SUCCESS. LET'S EXPAND OUR ECONOMIC BASE, HAVE EVEN MORE HIGH PAYING JOBS. DO SOLID REFORM WITH EDUCATIONAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS. LET'S MAINTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY. ANDREW GILLUM AS MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE PRESIDES OVER THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN FLORIDA FOUR YEARS IN A ROW. IN FACT, LAST YEAR THEY HAD MORE MURDERS IN TALLAHASSEE THEN AT ANY TIME IN THEIR HISTORY. WANTS TO AABOLISH ICE. IMMIGRATION AGENCY. HAVE PEOPLE COMMITTING CRIMES TO BE RELEASED BACK INTO OUR SOCIETY. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. HE HAS ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH THE FURTHEST LEFT FRINGE GROUPS THAT YOU CAN HE IS RUNNING ON A 40% TAX INCREASE WHICH WOULD TOTALLY DESTROY OUR ECONOMIC MOMENTUM. HE WANTS TO HAVE A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ABOLISH HEAD CARE AND ABOLISH PEOPLE'S PRIVATE INSURANCE AND COST 32 TRILLION OVER 10 YEARS. SO, AS FLORIDIANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT THE MORE THEY SEE THAT THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO GO THIS THAT DIRECTION. THEY KNOW WITH ME WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON OUR COURSE, YES WE HAVE ISSUES WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH LIKE OUR WATER AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WE DON'T WANTING TO GO OFF THIS FAR LEFT WING TAN JENGT AND HAVE VENEZUELA LIKE POLICIES IMPOSED IN FLORIDA. AINSLEY: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, WE HAVE A LOT OF VIEWERS DOWN IN FLORIDA. SUPREME COURT OF YOU TO COME ON.
