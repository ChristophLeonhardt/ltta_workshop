1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,151
UNIDENTIFIED SUBSTANCE THAT MADE

2
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:02,686
THAT TRIO SICK IS ULTIMATELY

3
00:00:02,686 --> 00:00:03,954
WHAT KILLED THE MAN.

4
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:04,254
YIKES.

5
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,157
>> OTHER TO

6
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:07,191
>> TTHER TO

7
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:07,224
>> THAER TO

8
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:07,257
>> THAT' TO

9
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:07,291
>> THAT'STO

10
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,259
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD.

11
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,295
TWO FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS

12
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:13,130
SUGGESTING THAT EUROPE RETALIATE

13
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,865
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT FOLLOWING

14
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:17,201
HIS WITHDRAWING FROM THE IRAN

15
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:17,634
DEAL.

16
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:19,870
IN A "THE NEW YORK TIMES" OP ED

17
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,241
THEY WRITE THE EUROPEAN UNION

18
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,677
COULD ANNOUNCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF

19
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:27,778
AMBASSADORS FROM THE U.S.

20
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,012
ISN'T THAT THIS WHAT THEY DO

21
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,048
WHEN THEY BREECH AGREEMENTS,

22
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,916
EXPOSE THEM TO SECURITY RISKS

23
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,152
AND BREAK HAVOC.

24
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:37,221
MIGHT FOLLOW UP WITH EXPULSION

25
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,689
OF AMERICAN AMBASSADORS.

26
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,024
THIS FOLLOWING HILLARY CLINTON'S

27
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:43,627
ATTACKS AND JOAN KERRY'S MEETING

28
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,229
WITH IRANIAN OFFICIALS BEHIND

29
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,164
THE SCENE TO TRY TO SAVE OBAMA'S

30
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:48,065
DEAL.

31
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,867
COULD THEIR MOVES BE CONSIDERED

32
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:50,567
TREESEN?

33
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:54,705
HERE TO DEBATE, FORMER OBAMA

34
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,640
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JOE

35
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,776
RUBEN AND ADVISER TO GEORGE W.

36
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,411
BUSH AND BILL CLINTON.

37
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,446
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

38
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:04,447
JOEL, LET ME START WITH YOU.

39
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,950
IS THIS AN APPROPRIATE FORM OF

40
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,620
DIPLOMATIC PROTEST OR ARE THESE

41
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,122
FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS COACHING

42
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,391
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO RETALIATE

43
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:14,892
AGAINST THE U.S.?

44
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,927
>> WELL, GOOD MORNING, PETE.

45
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:19,096
AND CLEARLY THIS IS AN

46
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,530
OPPORTUNITY FOR DEBATE AND WE

47
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,132
SHOULD HAVE A DEBATE.

48
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,601
AMERICANS, WE STILL LIVE IN A

49
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,469
FREE SOCIETY.

50
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,304
WE'RE ABLE TO EBBING PRESS OUR

51
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:28,238
OPINIONS AND WE SHOULD.

52
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,140
THIS OPINION HAS VALIDITY.

53
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,108
WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

54
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,809
DID WITH THE IRAN DEAL IS

55
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,112
ESSENTIALLY TO DECLARE ECONOMY

56
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,713
WARFARE ON EUROPE AND SAY THAT

57
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,282
IT WAS GOING TO VIOLATE THE

58
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:38,582
DEAL.

59
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:39,983
THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT

60
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:41,818
EUROPE NOW IS IN A BOX.

61
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:44,922
>> WE DECLARED ECONOMIC WARFARE

62
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:45,289
ON EUROPE.

63
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:45,856
>> YES.

64
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,891
>> OR WE DECIDED THAT -- THIS

65
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,459
WAS NOT RATIFIED BY THE U.S.

66
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:49,793
SENATE.

67
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,695
THIS IS AN EXECUTIVE AGREEMENT

68
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,930
BETWEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIO.

69
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,399
>> I'M HAPPY TO GO TO THE U.S.

70
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:55,732
SENATE.

71
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:59,603
>> IT WON'T SO IT WOULD NEVER

72
00:01:59,603 --> 00:01:59,970
RATIFIED.

73
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,204
YOU WOULD SAY THE TRUMP

74
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,506
ADMINISTRATION ISN'T TRYING TO

75
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:05,809
COMMIT ECONOMIC WARE

76
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,244
COMMIT ECONOMIC WARFARE, IT HAS

77
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:09,246
A DIFFERENT VIEW OF IRAN.

78
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,515
>> THAT WAS THE LANGUAGE

79
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:12,649
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DEAL, THAT

80
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,052
WE WERE GOING TO IMPOSE

81
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,887
SANCTIONS ON EUROPE TO HELP IRAN

82
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,889
DO BETTER JOB ON THE DEAL.

83
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,058
WHY SHOULD WE PENALIZE OUR ALLY

84
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,759
TO GO AFTER IRAN.

85
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,561
WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER IRAN IF

86
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,929
ANYTHING AND THAT WASN'T CLEAR

87
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,531
IN THE WAY THE TRUMP

88
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,132
ADMINISTRATION DECLARED

89
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:29,733
OPPOSITION TO THE DEAL.

90
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,971
>> IT FEELS THAT THESE FORMER

91
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,472
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

92
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,274
ARE ROOTING AGAINST THE UNITED

93
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:37,607
STATES.

94
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:38,408
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

95
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,577
IT'S ONE THING, NO ONE SAYING

96
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,345
THEY SHOULD HAVEN'T THEIR

97
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,647
OPINION BUT SAYING THEY SHOULD

98
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:47,117
HAVE OUR AMBASSADORS EXPELLED,

99
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:48,151
THAT'S CUSTOMARILY SOMETHING YOU

100
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,753
DO BEFORE YOU GO TO WAR.

101
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,423
WE'RE NOT APPLYING SANCTIONS ON

102
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,391
EUROPE.

103
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,593
WE'RE APPLYING SANCTIONS ON

104
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:56,893
IRAN.

105
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,295
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN AFOUL

106
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,063
OF THESE, DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH

107
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:00,364
IRAN.

108
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,298
THAT IS THE POINT.

109
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,133
TO RETURN TO THE TOUGH SANCTIONS

110
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,801
THAT EXISTED BEFORE THIS LAW

111
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,970
DISI DEAL WAS ENACTED, JUST

112
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,871
GOING BACK TO THAT.

113
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,009
AND AS FAR AS THE OP-ED WITHIN,

114
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,643
THANKFULLY I THINK EUROPE WILL

115
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:14,444
IGNORE IT.

116
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,847
YOU MENTIONED HILLARY AND JOHN

117
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:20,050
KERRY, I WOULD MENTION CHUCK

118
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,452
SCHUMER REFUSING TO CONFIRM

119
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:22,819
OFFICIALS.

120
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,256
IT'S PART OF THE RESISTANCE TO

121
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,491
THE 2016 ELECTION OUTCOME AND

122
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,558
ROOTING FOR THE UNITED STATES TO

123
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,727
FAIL FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES GOING

124
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:31,495
INTO THE MIDTERMS.

125
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:34,431
>> JOEL, DOESN'T THIS INFLECT AN

126
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,900
INFLATED SENSE OF EUROPE'S

127
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,267
INFLUENCE?

128
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,169
WITHOUT OBAMA AND THE U.S., IRAN

129
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,670
DEAL DOESN'T HAPPEN, WE TAKE THE

130
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,572
LEAD ON THIS, WE WANT TO STOP

131
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,441
THEM FROM GETTING A BOMB.

132
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,409
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS A

133
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:45,876
DIFFERENT VIEW.

134
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,412
ARE THEY NOT ALLOWED A DIFFERENT

135
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:49,746
VIEW OR DO YOU HAVE TO IMPUGN

136
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:50,480
THEIR MOTIVES ?

137
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,747
-L.

138
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:52,849
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN

139
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:53,917
HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW.

140
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,252
AND IT HAS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

141
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,353
FOR YEARS.

142
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,321
BUT THIS IS A DEAL WE HAVE WITH

143
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,891
EUROPE AND THE IRANIANS AND

144
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,926
RUSSIA AND CHINA.

145
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,661
RIGHT NOW BREAKING THE DEAL,

146
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,531
WE'RE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF

147
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:08,665
IRANIAN HARD LINERS.

148
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,167
RUSSIA IS HAPPY.

149
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,501
THE U.S. IS FIGHTING WITH

150
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:11,835
EUROPE.

151
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,173
AND THE U.S. SAID WE WOULD APPLY

152
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,507
SECONDARY SANCTIONS ON COMPANIES

153
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,642
DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN.

154
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,709
WE AS AMERICANS DON'T DO

155
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,845
BUSINESS WITH IRAN RIGHT NOW.

156
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,313
THEY'RE GOING TO CANCEL THE

157
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:23,914
BOEING DEAL.

158
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,149
ROLLING IT BACK AS IF WE CAN

159
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,384
SOMEHOW GET THE SANCTIONS BACK

160
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:30,353
FROM FOUR YEARS AGO, THAT

161
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,922
HILLARY CLINTON APPLIED AND PUT

162
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:32,456
INTO EFFECT.

163
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,356
THAT'S REALLY FANTASY.

164
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,659
WE NEED A DEAL THAT'S GOING TO

165
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,560
WORK TOWARDS WHAT PRESIDENT

166
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,128
TRUMP SAID, BREAKING THIS

167
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:39,162
CURRENCY, IT WON'T GET US THERE.

168
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:41,298
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT

169
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,999
BREAKING THIS CURRENT DEAL WON'T

170
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,935
GET US THERE?

171
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:46,269
>> IT WILL.

172
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,504
FRANKLY THE SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN

173
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:48,305
EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST.

174
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:50,040
WE DON'T WANT IRAN TO BENEFIT

175
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,742
FROM A WINDFALL OF HIGHER OIL

176
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,076
PRICES.

177
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,479
AND THE ALLIES THAT COUNT THE

178
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:56,813
MOST, FRANKLY NOT FRANCE AND

179
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:57,647
GERMANY HERE.

180
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:58,882
IT'S PATHETIC THAT THEY'VE

181
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,484
DECIDED TO ENRICH THEMSELVES BY

182
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,886
DOING BUSINESS WITH THE BIGGEST

183
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,488
DETABLIZING FORCE AND THE

184
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:07,124
BIGGEST OPPONENT OF FREEDOM IN

185
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:08,425
THE MIDDLE EAST -- THAT'S HOW

186
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:09,392
YOU PUT PRESSURE.

187
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,863
>> SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB

188
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:13,230
EMIRATES.

189
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,931
ALL OF THE MIDDLE EAST IS

190
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:15,265
