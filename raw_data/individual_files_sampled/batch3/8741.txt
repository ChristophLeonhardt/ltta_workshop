Shannon: WELCOME BACK TO "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT," ACCENTED PRIMARY COVERAGE TONIGHT. WE HEARD A SHORT TIME AGO FROM THE REPUBLICANS, TALKING ABOUT GAS TAXES IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK YOU'RE A CITY REVOLT. WONDERING WHETHER DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM IS THERE TONIGHT. LET'S ASK A MAN WHO SHOULD KNOW. COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE, JOINING US NOW ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY? YES, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME COME SHANNON. I THINK WE ARE SEEING THAT DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM IS ONCE AGAIN, DON NOT IN THESE PRIMARY RACES. IN NEW JERSEY, IOWA, AND IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE CANDIDATES WHO ARE WINNING THESE PRIMARIES AND EMERGING FROM THESE RACES, CANDIDATES WITH DEEP TIES TO THESE DISTRICTS AND WE THINK THEY'LL GO ONTO A LOT OF SUCCESS IN NOVEMBER. Shannon: I WANT TO REDO SOMETHING WE HAVE EARLIER FROM THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER." "THE DEMOCRATS BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS INTERNAL. THEIR ENTHUSIASM IS LEFT OF CENTER BUT THEIR PATH TO THE MAJORITY IS SMACK DAB IN THE CENTER." TO GAIN BACK THE SEATS THEY LOST IN THEIR PITCH LEFT BETWEEN 292,016, THEY NEED TO CENTER THEMSELVES. WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE PARTY? THERE NEEDS TO BE ENERGY AND THE FURTHER LEFT, BUT ARE YOU SEEING, THINKING ABOUT THAT AND WEIGHING IT AS YOU LOOK AT CANDIDATES TO BACK IN THE PRIMARY END OF THE GENERAL? THE FOCUS OF THE PRIMARY HAS BEEN TWO ISSUES, HEALTH CARE, AND THE TAX BILL THAT THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS PASSED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW. ON HEALTH CARE, WE SAW A REVOLT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AGAINST REPUBLICAN ATTEMPTS REP HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM WORKING PEOPLE. EVEN IN THE TAX BILL, BECAUSE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT, HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS WILL SPIKE ACROSS THE COUNTRY DUE TO THE IRRESPONSIBLE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN. OUR CANDIDATES ARE IN THE DISTRICT TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, TALKING ABOUT THE TAX BILL, AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THESE DISTRICTS. THESE CANDIDATES UNDERSTAND THE DISTRICTS THEY ARE RUNNING IN, THEY ARE OUT THERE EVERY DAY TALKING TO VOTERS. WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE MESSAGE THEY ARE DELIVERING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. Shannon: AS YOU KNOW, THE NONPARTISAN TAX POLICY CENTER, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK LEADS TO THE LEFT, THAT 85% OF AMERICANS WERE GETTING CAUGHT UNDER THE TAX BILL, 10% WOULD REMAIN THE SAME, 5% MAY HAVE A HIKE. POLLING SHOWS THAT MORE THE PEOPLE LEARNED ABOUT IT, THE MORE THEY SEE THEIR PAYCHECKS, THEY THINK IT IS NOT SUCH A BAD THING, GROWING IN POPULARITY. HOW DO YOU RUN AGAINST THAT? WE HAVEN'T SEEN HUNDRED IS GROWING IN POPULARITY. ULTIMATELY, A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE TAX BILL, IN ADDITION TO THE HEALTH CARE PREMIUM INCREASES THAT IT WILL LEAD TO, IS THAT IT WAS USUALLY WEIGHTED TOWARD LARGER CORPORATION, CORPORATIONS ON THE WEALTHY. AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT IMBALANCE IN THE BILL, AND I THINK THAT MANY AMERICANS WILL AGREE THAT THERE ARE BETTER THINGS TO SPEND $1.5 TRILLION ON THAT MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS, AND THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS YOU DON'T NEED IT. Shannon: ALSO INCLUDING 85% OF AMERICANS. 85%. THOSE AREN'T MY NUMBERS. WE ARE NOT DISPUTING THAT SOME AMERICANS WILL GET SOME TAX CUTS IN THIS BILL. BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE LION'S SHARE OF THE TAX CUTS WENT TO THESE CORPORATIONS AND WENT TO THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS. AND MANY AMERICANS HAVE SAID, MAYBE THEY GET A LITTLE BIT THAT HELPS AND THAT'S GREAT BUT THEY SEE THAT IT'S A VERY UNBALANCED BILL. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS AS TO WHY REPUBLICAN MEMBERS THOUGHT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO GIVE THESE KINDS OF TAX CUTS TO CORPORATIONS AND TO THE WEALTHY WHEN THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE COULD SPEND THAT MONEY ON. Shannon: WE KNOW THOSE ARE THE SECTORS OF SOCIETY THAT ALSO PAY BY FAR THE LARGEST MARGIN OF THE TAXES. PATRICK, I HEAR YOU. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
