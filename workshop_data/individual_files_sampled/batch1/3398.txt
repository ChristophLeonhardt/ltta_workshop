Trump's border wall may destroy a wildlife refuge engineers are preparing to build a wall through the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge and southern Texas the refuge is 2088 acres there are more than 400 species of birds and 450 plant species it's also home to the endangered Ocelot fewer than 50 are left in the u.s. the refuge is part of the Rio Grande Valley the valley has already lost 95% of its native habitat to agricultural and urban development a barrier would further disturb the wildlife u-turn was supposed to be a refuge into a death trap and Ocelot can't climb an 18-foot slab of concrete and so they're trapped so the animals need to be able to get in and out of this refuge into adjacent portions of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge originates picnic pygmy owls they don't typically fly higher than 8 feet off the ground so if they see a barrier they're not going to go past it Santa and a refuge is federally protected land but homeland security can bypass environmental regulations for national security purposes in 2007 the Bush administration planned on building an 18-foot wall through the refuge that plan wasn't completed due to lack of funding the Center for Biological Diversity may file a lawsuit to protect Santa Ana but similar suits against President Bush's wall failed and we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary funding for Trump's proposed wall is awaiting approval from the center it could cost 22 billion dollars and possibly devastate his crown jewel of wildlife refuges
