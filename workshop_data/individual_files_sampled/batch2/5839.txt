when we think about though the context that Donald Trump as a marketer as a performer was able to take those energies however disparate they were in the economy and and really captured him look at this moment at a rally in Atlanta the lights go out and watch what Trump does they were probably sent here so that we put him in our jails because to put him in our jails they didn't pay the electric bill to put him oh I like that much better oh that's so much better those lights were brutal are they come from the dishonest press oh don't turn them on forget it better write something that would embarrass any speaker and I've been up at podiums if the lights go out and you're in the dark that's kind of tough to deal with but he turns it in the crowd I'm gonna show you the next moment the excitement builds as he leads people in a chant that's literally about nothing I won't pay the rent so we get better lighting and we don't pay the rent right right no get those lights off off turn them off there too they're too bright turn them off turn them off let's go ready turn off the lights turn off the lights turn off the lights turn them off so much nicer no no that's the way we have to negotiate for our country I'm joined by Tony Schwartz co-author of art of the deal and a businessman what do we see there and how does it tap into the larger anxiety that you see in the country well I think Trump has been a instinctive but masterful exploiter of people's fear and the thing about fear which i think is the dominant emotion in our country right now and I mean this for Trump supporters as I do for Trump opponents the problem with fear or the value of fear if you're somebody who's trying to exploit it is that it shuts down the prefrontal cortex right and on that point let me show one more thing take a look at this I know Bob Muller I know I know that whole team and they in there right and they probably have something on Trump trumped in something pretty bad i five innocent what do they have I don't know I have no idea but they have something do you think they were more interested in Trump related to the criminal hacking which occurred and we know they were stolen emails or in relation to all the social media and I think they were interested in something with his business that was an interesting moment from someone who worked for Trump about his business and his exposure but it goes to I think partly a nexus of the fear you're talking about so again with you analyzing this larger picture you said fear is dominant right now what do you mean I mean that fear that we're living in a world where you take this rise of authoritarianism you get climate change you get the nuclear threat you get companies that are dealing with being disrupted in ways that really threaten their future you get artificial intelligence which threatens everybody's jobs and it's a pretty fearful atmosphere and what happens with fear is that it essentially shuts down the prefrontal cortex so here's the way it works because it's physiological you prompt the fear you feel a threat Trump was incredibly good at making people feel that anxiety and the first thing that happens is your vision to the threat itself so actually what that means practically as you stop seeing the big picture then you keep getting more fear what happens is the prefrontal cortex completely shuts down so you no longer can think and reflect all you can do is react you know it's why it's why FDR said we have only fear but the only thing we have to fear is fear itself because the fear makes us smaller at precisely the time we need to be bigger the fear makes us simpler when the world is more complex and is that what's happening in outside of us or is that really what happens inside of us that some of us are just more really that's a really good distinction I would say legitimately you have reason to be fearful now you're almost being crazy if you are not somewhat fearful the question is how much that fear dominates you and that is what's happening inside the degree to which we can manage that fear the degree to which you can sort out the stories you're being told and the stories you tell yourself from a more reasonable perspective on things is the difference in how well you can manage in the world mm-hmm and so as Donald Trump uses that does that come from the fact that he's a master manipulator or does it come from the fact that he himself has a lot of fear oh I think he is fear it's both he's he's deeply fear driven that's really at the heart of it what's he fearful of because this is the heart of the issue what he's fearful of is that he's worthless what he's fearful of it's that there is nothing there and he's always fighting I've said before he's a bit of a black hole but he's not that different than most of us he's just more extreme all of us are deeply insecure and that is what we spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to cover up it's we that is where the fear comes from that feeling that you don't matter Wow so briefly do you think he's the president with the worst case of impostor syndrome in history you know I'm not an expert in presidents what but he is the he's the worst case of impostor syndrome that I've ever experienced and it gives us an opportunity to real to recognize that turning our own attention inside is a critical part of being able to to thrive in a world that's beset by fear when you put it that way I know that's part of what you work you do now that is so important cuz you're tapping into do you echo the problem you see in the world or do you find the antidote which I I'd love for you to come back and tell us more about let's tell you one last thing that I run a company that the the energy project that helps leaders and organizations manage their internal life better hmm that's actually that is what came out of my experience with Trump hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you
