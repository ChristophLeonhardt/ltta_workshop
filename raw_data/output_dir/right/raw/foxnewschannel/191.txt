2
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:12,348
AND THE G.O.P. CONGRESSIONAL

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,082
INVESTIGATION INTO THE JUSTICE

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,119
DEPARTMENT'S PROBE AT THE 2016

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,953
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

6
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,888
AN AIDE TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

7
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:21,557
COMMITTEE SAID THEY EXPECT

8
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:22,391
FUSION GPS COFOUNDER GLENN

9
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:24,494
SIMPSON TO COMPLY WITH THE

10
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:25,928
SUBPOENA AND APPEAR BEFORE

11
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,130
INVESTIGATORS FOR A DEPOSITION

12
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:27,864
TOMORROW.

13
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:28,531
SIMPSON'S ATTORNEY SAYS HIS

14
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:31,701
CLIENT INTENDS TO TAKE THE FIFTH

15
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:33,136
AND REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY

16
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:33,503
QUESTIONS.

17
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:35,304
REPUBLICANS SAY SIMPSON'S

18
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:39,308
DECISION NOT TO TALK DOES NOT

19
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,544
SURPRISE THEM AS WELL.

20
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:42,278
THAT'S BECAUSE HIS PAST

21
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:43,546
TESTIMONY APPARENTLY CONTRADICTS

22
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:49,218
THE TESTIMONY OF TOP DOJ

23
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:49,752
OFFICIAL BRUCE OHR.

24
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:54,857
SIMPSON CLAIMS HE AND OHR NEVER

25
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:58,961
MET TO DISCUSS THE DOSSIER.

26
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:02,899
OF COURSE HIS WIFE NELLIE WORKED

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,303
FOR GPS.

28
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:08,871
JOHN RATCLIFFE SAYS HE

29
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:09,739
UNDERSTANDS WHY SIMPSON WOULD

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,473
WANT TO TAKE THE FIFTH.

31
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:15,344
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT HE

32
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:19,148
WOULD WANT TO TAKE THE FIFTH.

33
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,316
REMEMBER, IT'S THE EXTRAORDINARY

34
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:21,317
MEASURE OF GETTING THE WARRANT

35
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,319
TO SPY ON AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,154
AND IF THAT WAS DONE UNDER FALSE

37
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:27,523
PRETENSES AND FALSE INFORMATION

38
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:29,292
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES, THEN

39
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:30,693
THAT'S VIOLATING SOMEONE'S CIVIL

40
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:35,097
LIBERTIES UNDER COLOR OF LAW.

41
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,866
>> Harris: SO JUDGE KNAPP

42
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,902
SAYS -- THAT'S AFFECTIONATE FOR

43
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:40,403
JUDGE NAPOLITANO.

44
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:42,939
THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THIS.

45
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,606
>> Judge Napolitano: SO THE

46
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:47,944
TWO SIDES, WITH TOP SECURITY

47
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:49,412
CLEARANCES SAY THAT THEY HAVE

48
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,514
SEEN ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE

49
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:52,949
GIVEN TO THE FISA COURT AND THEY

50
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,750
HAVE SEEN DOCUMENTS THAT WERE

51
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,819
NOT GIVEN TO THE PFIZER COURT,

52
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,088
AND IF THE COURT HAD SEEN WHAT

53
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,390
THEY SAW, NO WARRANT WOULD HAVE

54
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:05,561
BEEN ISSUED AND THIS ENTIRE

55
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,430
INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE NEVER

56
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,497
COMMENCED.

57
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:09,264
IF THEY WOULD HAVE PERSUADED THE

58
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:12,134
PRESIDENT TO EXPOSE IT, ISRAELI

59
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:14,270
INTELLIGENCE MUST HAVE BEEN

60
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:14,837
INVOLVED, BRITISH AND

61
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:15,605
TELEVISIONS MUST HAVE BEEN

62
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:16,973
INVOLVED AND DISSUADED THE

63
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:19,609
PRESIDENT FROM REVEALING THE

64
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,042
APPLICATIONS.

65
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:21,143
THE OTHER SIDE IS, WAIT A

66
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:23,112
MINUTE, YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF

67
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:25,448
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND THE

68
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,415
SUBJECT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

69
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,550
UNITED STATES.

70
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,552
YOU CAN'T DISRUPT A CRIMINAL

71
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:30,286
INVESTIGATION FOR POLITICAL

72
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:32,555
REASONS, YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

73
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:33,256
THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS

74
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:33,556
OVER.

75
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:35,324
I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN

76
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:36,759
EXPERIENCE, AND IT'S A BAD

77
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,928
EXPERIENCE, IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO

78
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,329
LEARN THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CAME

79
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,397
TO YOU FOR A SEARCH WARRANT DID

80
00:02:41,398 --> 00:02:45,234
NOT TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU

81
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:45,735
WANTED TO KNOW.

82
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:46,269
>> Harris: CLEARLY.

83
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,105
>> Harris: I'M TRYING A CASE

84
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,873
AND I SAVED THE PROSECUTOR'S,

85
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:52,575
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS BLOOD?

86
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:54,277
WHILE SOMEBODY SIGNED A SEARCH

87
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:59,749
WARRANT TO GET THIS TO US.

88
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,884
WELL, WHICH JUDGE SIGNED THAT?

89
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:09,325
THREE YEARS AGO.

90
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:10,726
THE CONSEQUENCE OF MISLEADING A

91
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,561
COURT CAN BE CATASTROPHIC TO

92
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:13,296
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO

93
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:14,130
ACCOMPLISH.

94
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:16,899
>> WHAT IF THAT COURT IS SECRET?

95
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,167
WHAT IF IT OPERATES LIKE THE

96
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,269
PFIZER COURT DOES WITH

97
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,138
ABSOLUTELY NO OVERSIGHT AND

98
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,906
ESSENTIALLY IT'S A RUBBER STAMP?

99
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:28,244
>> THAT'S WHY JUDGES HAVE TO NOT

100
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,112
BEND OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

101
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:32,481
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN YOUR

102
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:33,215
POSSESSION THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN?

103
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:34,917
IF THEY SAY NO AND THE ANSWER IS

104
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:38,754
YES, THEY HAVE MISLED THE COURT.

105
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:39,622
>> QUICK SUGGESTION MELISSA AND

106
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,324
I WILL GO RIGHT TO YOU.

107
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,926
WHAT YOU AND KENNEDY ARE TALKING

108
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:45,161
ABOUT IS POWER.

109
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:46,662
IN SECRECY, WE GAIN SO MUCH

110
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:47,330
POWER.

111
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,664
WHAT IF THE COURT FEEL SO

112
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,567
POWERFUL IT DOESN'T NEED TO ASK

113
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:52,935
ANYMORE QUESTIONS?

114
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:54,570
>> SECRECY IS DANGEROUS TO

115
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,138
POWER, IT ENHANCES POWER AND TO

116
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,473
PERMIT THE ABUSE OF POWER WHICH

117
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,976
IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CONDEMNING

118
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,778
THIS FISA COURT SINCE IT WAS

119
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:03,112
CREATED.

120
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,081
>> LOOK HOW LONG AND HARD

121
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:06,015
JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS HAVE

122
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,084
HAD TO WORK JUST TO SEE THAT

123
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,119
PFIZER WARRANT APPLICATION.

124
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,956
>> BUT CAN I ASK THE QUESTION,

125
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,725
SOMEONE IS LYING ABOUT WHERE

126
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:17,126
THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THIS

127
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,762
DOSSIER AND SHOPPING IT AROUND,

128
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:21,696
AND, THEY ARE MAKING EFFORT TO

129
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:25,968
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE EARLIER RATHER

130
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,403
THAN LATER NOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN

131
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:28,738
CAUGHT IN THIS LIFE.

132
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:31,741
>> IF A COURT IS THE RECIPIENT

133
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:33,809
OF A LIE, IF A LAWYER OR PERSON

134
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,344
AFFILIATED WITH THE COURT COULD

135
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:39,482
BE AN FBI AGENT, THAT MAKES A

136
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:40,316
MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION OF

137
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:40,716
THE COURT.

138
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:44,787
THAT PERSON'S CAREER IS IN

139
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:49,625
JEOPARDY.

140
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:56,399
AND BECAUSE OF THAT LIE -- I'M

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,136
GUESS I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

142
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:00,603
TESTIMONY HERE.

143
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,638
I UNDERSTAND WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE

144
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,773
WOULD HAVE CONCERNS TESTIFYING

145
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,407
IN FRONT OF THE JUDICIARY

146
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,342
COMMITTEE AND THE INTELLIGENCE

147
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:08,544
COMMITTEE BECAUSE SO MUCH OF

148
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:11,347
WHAT IS RELEASED THESE DAYS IS

149
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:12,014
CHERRY PICKING INFORMATION.

150
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,516
PEOPLE GO IN AND TO TESTIFY

151
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,151
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND SOME OF

152
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:16,919
THAT TESTIMONY ENDS UP GETTING

153
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,219
LEAKS.

154
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,223
THAT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE.

155
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,091
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE

156
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:22,958
WOULD HAVE INTERPRETATION AT

157
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,128
THIS CURRENT STAGE TESTIFYING,

158
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,731
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS TEND TO

159
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,131
CHERRY PICK.

160
00:05:29,132 --> 00:00:00,000
>> FROM WHAT WE KNEW ABOUT --
