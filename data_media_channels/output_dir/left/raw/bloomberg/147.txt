1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,740
Instead of taking a sledgehammer approach

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,700
to brain disorders, which is what we're doing today,

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,600
with technology like Inscopix,

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
we can peer deep into the brain

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,180
when the subject is actually interacting with its environment.

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,460
At a NASA research facility in the heart of Silicon Valley,

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,100
neuro scientists are working on a microscopic camera

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,280
that can record individual nerve cells or neurons

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,500
as they fire inside a living working brain.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,680
A start-up in nearby Palo Alto called Inscopix

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,800
developed this tiny device.

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,800
The company science director took me inside the NASA animal lab

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,099
where they test their product on mice - like this little guy.

14
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,160
So I'm going to put him back in his cage.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,620
Right now he's doing a little bit of digging!

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,940
There's a little docking station right on the animal's head

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,940
and this allows us just to attach the microscope.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,420
So the microscope is what you see on top.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,040
The whole thing depends on some pretty crazy science.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,480
They start with a special virus

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,260
and inject it into the mouse.

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,220
The virus bores into the nuclei of the furry guy's neurons

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,740
and changes DNA there so the cells will glow.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,700
But they only glow when they're hit with a special light

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,880
and when the neurons fire off.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,260
To see the neurons flashing,

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,399
researchers surgically implant a microscopic optical needle

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,700
into the specific part of the brain that interests them.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,080
The microscope plugs into a brain docking station

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
straight out of "The Matrix"

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,660
and streams video of brain activity to a computer screen.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,320
All while the mouse scurries on about its mousey business.

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,300
Each one of these flashing dots you see

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,620
is one brain cell.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,220
So we're looking at a live picture of

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,160
information transmission within the brain.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's crazy.

38
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,020
Do you remember the first time you ever saw this in action

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,480
and what did it feel like?

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,640
Yeah I was extremely excited.

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,220
Before, I was trying to record

42
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,520
from these cells you see

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,320
one cell at a time

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,280
and the very first time that I saw

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,040
this many cells, a thousand neurons light up

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,300
it was transformational.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,800
We've had techniques to analyze the brain

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,820
on a whole scale like MRI

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,980
and we've had techniques that allowed us

50
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,200
to record from individual neurons.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,400
But if you actually want to understand

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
how the brain functions,

53
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,420
we have to visualize multiple cells

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,180
that are working together

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,880
to perform a particular function

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,960
as an animal navigates its space.

57
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,280
Inscopix does just that.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
It films brain cells

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,040
while a mouse wanders around his cage

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,680
or during an epileptic seizure.

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,760
It can even capture the symphony of neurons

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,300
inside a songbirds mind.

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,640
The brain camera started its life

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
as a research project at Stanford

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,040
ten years ago.

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,300
But it proved so popular,

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,920
its developers thought labs would pay to use it

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,260
even at sixty to a hundred thousand dollars a pop.

69
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,560
And so Inscopix was formed.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,620
I was always a scientist, even as a little girl

71
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,100
and with technology like this,

72
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,060
it's exciting because with a

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,320
thorough understanding of how the brain

74
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,700
is actually operating,

75
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,920
we're starting to develop the ability to control it,

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,940
to potentially alleviate devastating brain disorders.

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,500
In San Francisco at the

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Gladstone Institute Of Neurological Disease,

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,120
researchers use the Inscopix microscope

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,540
to live-stream the brain,

81
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,100
as mice make basic decisions.

82
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,660
Are you looking at the brain up close or what's the...?

83
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,620
So we're really interested in how

84
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,500
the brain functions during behavior.

85
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,280
So, we measure the behavior of mice as they

86
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,000
make economic decisions about what to do

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,060
and what kinds of rewards they're going to get.

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,740
What's the application in humans?

89
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,720
There are a number of neuropsychiatric diseases

90
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,740
where value based decision making has gone wrong.

91
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,480
Addiction I think is probably the most prominent one

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,260
in which people have decided that

93
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,680
obtaining and using drugs

94
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,360
is really the main action that they want to perform.

95
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,020
And then of course diseases like depression

96
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,020
where patients have lost the motivation to perform

97
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,520
any kind of action really.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
As we understand more specifically

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,560
how cells control basic decisions,

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,540
we'll be able to develop entirely new strategies

101
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,120
for treating these diseases.

102
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,740
About 200 labs already use Inscopix

103
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,540
and the company has raised 10 million dollars in funding.

104
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,760
DARPA, the Pentagon sci-fi research arm

105
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,420
just gave them four million dollars to

106
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,160
create a device that can be hardwired

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,230
into the brain and restore vision for

108
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,840
some blind patients.

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,840
Futurists in Silicon Valley believe that

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
decoding how the brain works

111
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,880
will help us build a new generation of computers

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,040
that are more powerful because they resemble human intelligence

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,780
or maybe it'll be the other way around.

114
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,370
I always enjoyed a range of

115
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,820
sci-fi movies when I was growing up

116
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,080
and these concepts are coming to life

117
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,020
like a merging of a computer

118
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,900
with an active, living brain.

119
00:06:08,080 --> 00:00:00,000
The sky's the limit really.
