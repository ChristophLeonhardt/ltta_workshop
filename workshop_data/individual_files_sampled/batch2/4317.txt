our top story tonight is the most consequential test on the power of the presidency since Donald Trump assumed office and this is a test he narrowly passed today the Supreme Court upheld the revised version of Trump's travel ban now whether you agree with that decision or not it's a reminder that for all of this president's hyperbole and attacks on the rule of law it is the law that has the final word tonight not Donald Trump just as it was the law that narrowed his original travel ban after those first days of total airport chaos and in a tradition familiar to many presidents who wait to see if the Supreme Court will let them use their powers or if it will narrow their powers Trump celebrated today's ruling a tremendous success a tremendous victory for the American people and for our Constitution this is a great victory for our Constitution we have to be tough and we have to be safe and we have to be secure the ruling shows that all of the attacks from the media and the Democrat politicians are wrong and they turned out to be very wrong the Supreme Court did not rule on whether this travel ban makes America more secure many experts say the opposite but that was not the question before the court today the question was quite narrow does the Constitution give a president the power to bar immigrants from certain countries and did the final version of the travel ban do that or operate as a religious test if you follow this issue you may have heard many other questions like is this fair is it right is it good for security and those are certainly important questions for the political branches for the voters but the Supreme Court is not supposed to resolve those questions for us that's the way it's always been which means Trump was always more likely to have this ban upheld and whether you think that's good or bad that's always been the legal framework because we know the courts give presidents a lot of latitude on immigration back on the first day after Trump ordered the original travel ban amidst that Airport chaos and those protests I was out reporting on the whole mess but also on the legal framework I explained at the time that ban was likely to be upheld because the courts could interpret it as something less then the religious band that Trump originally campaigned on is it likely to be upheld probably we can say that there is great executive authority in the area of immigration is it written as a religious ban the way Donald Trump campaigned on no not at all today the Chief Justice's of REME court wrote a majority opinion ruling that this ban has legitimate purposes and says quote nothing about religion also noting the issue before the courts not whether to denounce things Trump said that critics believe strike at fundamental standards of respect and tolerance by the standards of the Supreme Court here that is an important line think about it like this tonight the court upholds the president's constitutional authority but also notes that critics say this president is an affront to the very tolerance America needs right now in fact if you put aside a lot of the hyperbole and read this opinion it cites President Eisenhower's defense of Muslim Americans rights to pray and then it shouts out george w bush for visiting the same islamic center that eisenhower visited to bring his message of tolerance for muslims after 9/11 quite a contrast to today's donald trump now the court obviously is inciting that history of random today it is a sobering moral contrast to this president but when judges are restrained they don't weave their moral calls into the rulings themselves and thus Justice Roberts writes a key phrase today that captures much of this era quote we must consider not only the statements of a particular president but also the authority of the presidency itself the statements of this particular president are different for the reasons we all know because they're divisive they're often ugly sometimes they're even blatantly unlawful like that campaign pledge he made of a plan to violate the Constitution Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on against this backdrop today the court also took an extraordinarily unusual step using this majority decision that agrees with Trump to also state its view on a totally unrelated historical case that think about this until today remained a shameful precedent on the books in American court history because the Supreme Court infamously upheld the legality of Japanese internment a precedent that's been discussed a lot lately given Trump's internment and separation of immigrant families today in response to critiques from dissenters about the travel ban decision the conservative majority on this court given the current climate rights this the old decision upholding internment was gravely wrong the day it was decided it has no place in law under the Constitution so there is much important substance in this decision whether one agrees with the result or not the political reaction of the case has been fierce the first Muslim elected to Congress Keith Allison hammering the electoral side today that the Supreme Court seat stolen from Obama before the election paved the way for this ruling this decision was set as soon as Neil Gorsuch was seated in the court it is not really a decision based on what the facts are it's based on with the composition and the political ideology of the Supreme Court at this moment that is broadly true the court reflects its appointees who then reflect at least to some degree the party that controls the White House and we do know Senate Republicans broke a precedent by flatly refusing Obama's nominee to the court in 2016 but if you play what if eventually it cancels everything out if Trump didn't win then Gorsuch wouldn't be on the court but also there wouldn't be a travel ban to rule on today the larger point goes a little deeper tonight courts are still with everything going on right now they are still a guardrail for the Constitution that's a good thing but they're not there to overrule any old bad idea people may want out of the political arena the Constitution gives the president broad immigration power and as the nation now assesses the competence and the ethics of Donald Trump's use of that broad power question is not whether Donald Trump has it but whether as a nation we want him to continue using it like this I'm joined by a special guest for this discussion Anthony Romero is the executor of the ACLU he's led the charge on the ACLS Lakes Helios lawsuit against this travel ban and a legal eagle legend NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg mr. Romero what do you say to the fact that you lost because the Supreme Court determined that in its narrowed form this was not technically a ban on Muslims or a religious test it's a tragic day it's a tragic day for the Supreme Court it's a tragic day for the country and when I read the opinion twice today especially the majority opinion and then the dissent from justice Sotomayor I was struck about how we had two competing worldviews I mean the the majority opinion tried so very hard to give him every benefit of the doubt and gave him great deference as you cited in the opening segment it skirted over the questions of the Animus which we believe really was at the heart of the of this third Proclamation and ultimately I believe and my colleagues of the ACA and I believe that they applied the wrong standard in in deciding this case and so they set the bar incredibly low for the government that they could easily hurdle over at the end of the day I think this case will go down here today just to be clear Anthony you're saying that they basically put the fix in by using a rational basis standard which almost anything would pass rather than something stricter because of the anti-muslim statements the president made and it's relegated to a small footnote on page 32 of Roberts opinion but when you read justice Sotomayor yours opinion where she talks about how they discarded precedent in dealing with the Establishment Clause the reasonable person standard the reasonable observer standard is what of governed and that they rigged they rigged the outcome of this ruling by using the rational basis standard and then she talks about how they gave complete short shrift to the long history of the animus that led up prior to the first and second and third executive orders the comments he made as president I mean they're cited in Justice Roberts opinion because he's smart enough to put some reference to it but he gives it a really short shrift and there was a line especially in justice Sotomayor s opinion which I found so telling deference is different from unclutch from unquestioning deference or acceptance rather and the idea that we can be deferential to the executive branch but it's not anathema to question the executive branch and she really does walk them through the whole process of how they miss an opportunity to delve into the facts of this case it's a missed opportunity and it will go down in history they repealed or they overruled Korematsu and they put another Korematsu on the books Nina well I think it's fair to say that this decision does give the president this president and any president more power than they had before that there are for all practical purposes almost no no bars that that have to be crossed that are too difficult to cross if you have if if all you have to do is show that there is arguably a connection to national security almost anybody can make that argument and in some ways the Trump administration is lucky that the first two of them two versions of this got struck down by the lower courts because it's not entirely clear to me what the court would have done if it had gotten one of the earlier ones that had very little to back it up they even were for example borrowing legal permanent residents in the United States from returning here if they were abroad and they were coming back they were barred they forgot to put that in that's how crazy the first one was so in some senses by the time they got around to the third one they had jumped through all the hoops they actually did and had been straight of review they cross the T's and dotted the eyes and what the Chief Justice said is we actually don't dispute any of the comments that the president made about Muslims and whether they display a bias towards Muslims the fact is that we're not even looking at that we're only looking right at what is in this third version which has neutral words on its face and therefore passes muster but you know you can make the argument and some people I talked to today did and some of them were from previous Republican administrations and national security positions one of them said this is still a pig they put the lipstick on it they dress it up so that five out of nine people accepted it but it's still a pig and you know you can make that raises the question Nina it raises a question is it a Blind Pig if it won't look at what the president said and did well I think the court made pretty clear and it always makes pretty clear but it really doesn't want to get involved in national security questions this isn't like kids at the border that's not really a different question this is a question that the president linked to national security and over and over again over the years the court is very hesitant to get involved in these questions and even in the Guantanamo cases it took them six years to finally realize that if they didn't set down some standards there weren't going to be any for how these people were treated and how their trials were to go forward and etc and I don't I think for a while this chapter is closed but there is a tiny little place there are a couple of nooks and crannies where after a couple of years it's conceivable that litigation could put a lot of pressure on the Trump administration for example to grant many more waivers of the ban in the ban and to let people come here when they have medical problems when they write which is hardly scholarly endeavors etcetera right which is partly what Justice Breyer was getting out in his dissent I'm saying we how much can you hide behind exceptions if they aren't really meaningful and why didn't we do fact-finding that so I think the crosstalk you know between the majority-minority there was rich I want you both to stay with me for a perspective from a Trump supporter I want to bring in Republican congressman Bill Johnson who is happy with the decision sir why is this good for America in your view tonight well I think first of all let me say arey that I respect our panel members today Nina I have followed your work for a long time Anthony I've watched your work from the sidelines as well and and I think all of you make some some points some of them good obviously it's not a secret some of them I disagree with what the Court did today was essentially Airy what you said in in your initial comments they ruled on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's actions the rule of law that's why I believe it is a victory for America because it stands on the Constitution and it stands on the rule of law and I think that's what is so vitally important what the Supreme Court said today is that the president of the United States who is solely charged with the the defense the protection and defense of American people charged with executing policies to protect our national security it is the chief executive who has the authority to make these kinds of decisions not the courts not drive ciders right and I think you're alluding to a point that that Nina was making earlier in other case law which is even in very controversial situations we do know the court or at least a block of the court doesn't like to second-guess potential national security decisions in real time Anthony and other critics of them go ahead look lower courts have made this decision before also I mean if you look back at at Shaughnessy versus Harris I t's a federal judge said that a federal court should not even hear a case related to determining whether or not the chief executive can make or decide comes into our country and who doesn't come into our country and and you know we can we can argue the points about rhetoric and and and what was said but what we have to base this on is what was actually done because there's rights Olimpico has been Muslim countries let me do cluded in this ban less than ten percent let me do let me do one thing on this for you first and then the panel which is this other thing that happened a night that's so unusual the Supreme Court using today's decision to deal with Japanese internment I think we would all agree that's an unusual thing that occur in the middle of this kind of decision congressman for you first take a listen at Donald Trump doing what his lawyers would surely advise against which was citing that disfavored president on this issue you know he did the same thing congressman that was a candidate Trump's defense for you and then the panel your view of the news tonight is it good the Supreme Court as emphatically and finally said that Japanese internment decision was wrong and if so was Donald Trump wrong to invoke it well I can't speak for the President and I have not read the full report or the full ruling from the Supreme Court I do agree with you that it's very unusual that they would go back that far and bring something up like this I I think I'll have to stand on my my earlier comments that what makes this such a landmark decision is that the Supreme Court said that it is the chief executive under our Constitution under our system of government our president has the sole authority to make these kinds of decisions based on America's vital interest to national security I think that's the important takeaway here well you know yes sir let me go Nina and then aunt well if you look at this decision by the chief justice obviously the Japanese internment was added on on the last page because the dissent justice Sotomayor is dissent said this is analogous to the Japanese internment and that clearly jerked his cord big time because you know you can't find a serious scholar in the United States of America who would defend the Japanese internment or slavery anymore or Dred Scott and that's and he didn't like at all being lumped into that group and so he made very clear that's why he reached back and said it was wrong the day it was decided it's wrong now and we're taking this opportunity to wipe it off the books it is no longer operative precedent absolutely right Dena and I think I with all due respect sir although reasonable people might differ about this opinion no one can differ about what the legacy was of Korematsu in that case in 1941 brought by the ACLU and lost in 1944 the Supreme Court and the fact that the Justice Roberts bent over backwards to have to reference it because he must have seen it in the draft at the dissent that was coming to him as he was writing his majority opinion and also the insertion of some nominal talk of the religious animus in the majority opinion also speaks about how that he had to respond to the dissent I think ultimately the one the one opinion that I find the most curious is the tormented opinion by Justice Kennedy one and a half pages he talked about what it says he talks about how we can't review this action by the president but then he goes on to scold the president in my view and as I read it between the lines about how we need civility how elected officials need to uphold the Constitution and it's a man who's obviously tormented by the fact that he's voting with the majority because he has a very limited view of what judicial review is in this context but he obviously is having very great difficulties on the statements and even the the policy outcomes of the president and with all due respect I think this is one of those moments when I think Justice Kennedy might regret that opinion that he didn't go the extra yard to bring the ball across the goal line tell what would happen in the future he has changed he changed his mind about Guantanamo exactly and that that's what happened in those six years and I thought that that page and a half opinion was a little bit of a warning shot as was in some ways the Chief Justice's opinion talking about the responsibility of a president and refusing to in any way try to mitigate president Trump's statements expressing an anti-muslim bias just saying that's not our business if the president if Congress wants to change it it should change it but not he's no we're defending those comments right I have a warning shot as well which is I have to fit in a break congressman briefly final word well I was gonna say you can't just take a few things that the president said you have to look at the context of all that he did he did not include all Muslim countries there's only there's less than 10% and two of the current countries are not even Muslim countries windows oh and and with the waivers and the waivers for asylum I'd we have to look at the total context hey I'm all remember from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're
