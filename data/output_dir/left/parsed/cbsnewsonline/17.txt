JUST HOURS AGO, WE CELEBRATED 
ANOTHER TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT. 
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF VICTORIES 
FOLKS. 
CAN YOU HANDLE IT? 
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE, I WELCOME HOME PASTOR 
ANDREW BRUNSON, GREAT MAN FROM 
TURKEY. 
HE IS NOW FREE FROM JAIL. 
THINK OF THAT. 
35 YEAR JAIL SENTENCE. 
35 YEARS. 
NOT ANYMORE. 
HE'S BACK WITH HIS FAMILY. 
TOGETHER, WITH HIS WIFE. 
AND, HE IS ON AMERICAN SOIL. 
AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. 
THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER. 
THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER. 
WASN'T EASY. 
WASN'T EASY. 
THAT WASN'T WASN'T EASY. 
AND WE DON'T PAY RANSOM. 
WE DON'T PAY RANSOM.
I THINK WE WILL ESTABLISH A 
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
THIS EVENING IN THE WAKE OF 
HURRICANE MICHAEL, OUR THOUGHTS 
ARE WITH OUR FELLOW CITIZENS IN 
FLORIDA, GEORGIA, THEY GOT HIT 
HARD. 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
FLORIDA.
ALMOST 200 MILES AN HOUR. 
ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS WE HAVE 
EVER BEEN HIT WITH. 
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF 
THOSE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
THE PEOPLE OF FEMA. 
THE FIRST RESPONDERS. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
AND ALL OF THE THOUSANDS OF 
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. 
AND NATIONAL GUARDS, ALL OF THE 
PERSONNEL, THEY ARE NOW ON THE 
GROUND SUPPORTING THIS REALLY 
MAJOR RECOVERY. 
I WILL SAY, THOUSANDS OF 
ELECTRIC TRUCKS ALL LINED UP. 
THEY'RE GETING THE ROADS 
CLEARED. 
NOT EASY. 
AND THEY HAVE DONE SOME JOB. 
600,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRIC 
IN ONE DAY. 
THEY GOT IT DOWN TO 250,000. 
THAT'S SOME JOB. 
ONE DAY. 
AND WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL THE 
JOB IS DONE. 
WE'RE HERE TONIGHT TO DISCUSS 
EVERYTHING WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED 
TOGETHER IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS 
TIME. 
THINK OF IT. 
AND I'M HERE TONIGHT, ALTHOUGH 
I'VE BEEN BACK MANY TIMES, I 
LOVE THIS STATE. 
TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY 
FOR 2016. 
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG 
FOR THAT. 
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG 
FOR THAT. 
REMEMBER, THE VOTE IS IN, THE 
POLLS ARE CLOSED IN KENTUCKY. 
DONALD TRUMP IS THE WINNER OF 
KENTUCKY. 
THAT WAS FAST. 
THAT WAS FAST. 
AND, TO MAKE SURE THAT 
AMERICA'S EXTRAORDINARY 
COMEBACK, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 
IT GOES FULL SPEED AHEAD. 
WE DON'T WANT DEMOCRATS COMING 
FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE. 
WE DON'T WANT THEM GETTING IN 
OFFICE. 
ALL THEY'LL DO IS OBSTRUCT. 
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, 
AMERICA IS BOOMING. 
IT'S THRIVING. 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN 
BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING 
AMERICA FIRST. 
 OUR COUNTRY'S 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS JUST 
FALLEN TO 3.7%. 
THE LOWEST IN OVER 50 YEARS. 
50 YEARS. 
MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS 
REACHED AN ALL-TIME HIGH. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
THAT MEANS YOU'RE MAKING MORE 
MONEY THAN YOU EVER MADE 
BEFORE. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH BETTER 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT UP 
HIGHER. 
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD 
NUMBER OF JOB KILLING 
REGULATIONS. 
AND SOME OF YOU WILL LOVE THIS 
AND I'M PROUD OF IT. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
A GREAT RESOURCE WHEN PROPERLY 
USED. 
WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON CLEAN, 
BEAUTIFUL COAL. 
WE'RE PUTTING OUR MINERS BACK 
TO WORK LIKE NEVER BEFORE. 
THEY'RE GOING BACK, BACK, BACK. 
AND AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING 
OTHER NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY 
REBUILDING OUR NATION. 
AND WE ARE DOING IT WITH 
AMERICAN IRON, ALUMINUM, AND 
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO STEEL. 
YOU SEE THE COMEBACK WITH 
STEEL? 
EVERYONE'S GOING BACK TO WORK. 
THE STEEL MILLS ARE OPENING UP. 
U.S. STEL. 
THEY'RE ALL OPENING UP THEIR 
STEEL MILLS. 
THAT WAS FASTER THAN I THOUGHT. 
AND WE'RE STOPPING THE DUMPING. 
IF THEY WANT TO DUMP, THEY CAN, 
BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY A LOT. 
SO, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, SO 
TRUE. 
DESPITE OUR SIZE, AMERICA IS 
NOW THE HOTTEST COUNTRY 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO 
BE. 
SINCE MY ELECTION, WE PICKED UP 
IN WORTH, $11.7 TRILLION. 
THINK OF THAT. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG 
GREAT WITH CHINA. 
WE'RE DOING THINGS WITH CHINA 
AND THEY DROPPED ABOUT 20 
TRILLION. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE. 
BUT THEY HAVE TO TREAT US 
FAIRLY. 
THEY HAVE TO TREAT US FAIRLY. 
RIGHT? 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
AND EVERY DAY, WE ARE LIVING BY 
OUR MOTTO. 
PROMISES MADE. 
PROMISES KEPT.
AND YOU LOOK AT THE TAKE NEWS 
MEDIA. 
LOOK AT THEM. 
LOOK AT THEM. 
IT'S LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS 
EVERY TIME. 
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO WALK INTO 
A PLACE ONE NIGHT AND NOT HAVE 
ANY OF THESE GUYS. 
BOY, IT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER. 
BUT, EVEN THEY HAVE SAID THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOU KNOW, 
THEY PROBABLY GET FIRED THE 
NEXT DAY, THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
MADE PROMISES DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN AND I'VE ACTUALLY 
PRODUCED MORE THAN THE PROMISES 
I MADE. 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HEAR THAT? 
AND WE ALL PRODUCED IT 
TOGETHER. 
WE HAVE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
MITCH AND RAND. 
WE ALL PRODUCED IT TOGETHER. 
WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM. 
BUT, WE NEED MORE OF THEM. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES. 
WE HAVE A MAJORITY THAT'S 
ESSENTIALLY RAND, NOT A 
MAJORITY. 
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, WE 
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY, RIGHT? 
SO WE HAVE TO GET SOME MORE 
REPUBLICANS IN THERE. 
AND WE'RE HERE FOR SOME GOOD 
ONES TONIGHT. 
ON MONDAY NIGHT, AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
WE KEPT ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND 
MOST HISTORIC PROMISES OF ALL. 
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT, RIGHT? 
NEVER HAS A MAN BEEN TREATED SO 
BADLY. 
AMERICA WATCHED AS WE PROUDLY 
SWORE IN THE NEWEST MEMBER OF 
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT. 
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
A GREAT, GREAT GENTLEMAN. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM WAS SO 
UNFAIR. 
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 
IT. 
AND WE STUCK WITH HIM ALL THE 
WAY. 
BECAUSE WE KNEW THE FACTS. 
WE STUCK WITH HIM ALL THE WAY. 
AND RAND PAUL, AND MEMBERSHIP. 
THEY STUCK WITH HIM. 
NO DOUBTS ABOUT IT. 
NO DOUBTS. 
REMEMBER THAT. 
REMEMBER THAT. 
HE NOW SITS ALONGSIDE JUSTICE 
NEIL GORSUCH TO DEFEND YOUR 
SACRED RIGHTS AND YOUR GOD GIVEN
FREEDOM. 
WHA THE CRAZY RADICAL 
DEMOCRATS DID TO JUSTICE 
KAVANAUGH IS A NATIONAL 
DISGRACE. 
FROM THE MOMENT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
WAS KNOWN, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
WE NOMINATED HIM. 
AND LITERALLY FROM THE MOMENT 
HE WAS NOMINATED, THEY DIDN'T 
EVEN KNOW. 
IT'S ACTUALLY, IF YOU THINK OF 
IT, IT'S FROM BEFORE HE WAS 
NOMINATED. 
NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT WHO 
IT WAS GOING TO BE. 
I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE MY DECISION 
YET AND THEY STARTED SAYING 
HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT WHOEVER 
THE PERSON MIGHT BE. 
THEY WERE ON A MISSION TO 
OBSTRUCT, RESIST, DELAY, 
DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME 
TOTALLY CONSUMED BY THEIR 
CHILLING LUST FOR POWER. 
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. 
WE HAVE A MAN, ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD, IT'S 
OKAY, COMES FROM KENTUCKY. 
NOT BAD. 
AND HE HEARD ABOUT THIS. 
HE SAID I WANT TO BE THERE. 
HE'S ONE OF YOURS. 
HE'S JOINING US TONIGHT. 
HE'S ROCK RIBBED. 
KENTUCKY LEADER. 
HE'S BEEN A LEADER FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
THERE'S NOBODY TOUGHER. 
THERE'S NOBODY SMARTER. 
HE REFUSED TO CAVE TO THE 
RADICAL DEMOCRATS' SHAMEFUL 
CAMPAIGN OF POLITICAL AND 
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION. 
HE STARED DOWN TOUGH COOKIE. 
I KNOW TOUGH PEOPLE. 
HE'S TOUGH. 
HE'S KENTUCKY TOUGH WHICH IS 
ABOUT AS TOUGH AS IT GETS. 
HE STARED DOWN THE ANGRY LEFT 
WING MOB. 
HE NEVER BLINKED AND HE NEVER 
LOOKED BACK AND HE GOT US A MAN 
WHO WILL BE ONE OF OUR GREAT, 
GREAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. 
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 
MCCONNELL. 
COME UP HERE. 
COME UP. 
>> THANK YOU KENTUCKY. 
AREN'T WE PROUD OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP? 
LET ME JUST ADD, THANKS TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND REPUBLICAN 
SENATE, 84 NEW FEDERAL JUDGES 
JUDGES. 
THAT'S ALREADY A RECORD  MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
KEEP SENDING THEM TO US AND 
WE'LL KEEP COME FIRMING THEM. 
CHANGE THE COURT SYSTEM 
FOREVER. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AND MITCH IS A TRUE FIGHTER FOR 
KENTUCKY. 
LOVES HIS STATE. 
AND YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE RUNNING 
TOGETHER IN 2020. 
THAT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN. 
THANK YOU MITCH. 
ON THIS ELECTION DAY, NOVEMBER 
6, EVERY AMERICAN FACES A 
SIMPLE CHOICE. 
YOU CAN EITHER VOTE FOR 
DEMOCRAT MOB RULE OR YOU CAN 
VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN PARTY 
THAT STANDS PROUDLY FOR LAW AND 
ORDER, FAIRNESS, FREEDOM AND 
JUSTICE. 
SIMPLE AS THAT. 
IF NANCY PELOSI, CRYING CHUCK 
SCHUMER. 
AND THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS TAKE 
OVER CONGRESS, THEY WILL TRY TO 
RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY RESTORE 
JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. 
THEY WILL IMPOSE, BELIEVE IT OR 
NOT, SOCIALISM, TAKE AWAY YOUR 
HEALTH CARE. 
YOUR HEALTH CARE AND YOUR WHOLE 
LIFE WILL BE UNAFFORDABLE. 
SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY. 
OH, FORGET THIS ONE. 
THEY WILL DESTROY YOUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO OPEN 
OUR BORDERS TO A FLOOD OF 
DEADLY DRUGS. 
THEY HAVE BECOME THE PARTY OF 
CRIME. 
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF 
SAFETY. 
AND WE ARE THE PARTY OF JOBS. 
JOBS, JOBS. 
AND WE'RE THRILLED TO BE JOINED 
THIS EVENING BY SEVERAL 
TERRIFIC KENTUCKY REPUBLICANS. 
FIRST OF ALL, KENTUCKY SENATE 
PRESIDENT, ROBERT STIVERS. 
WHERE IS HE? 
WHERE IS ROBERT? 
THANK YOU. 
CONGRESSMAN TOM MASSEY. 
. TOM MASSIE. 
DOING A GREAT JOB. 
THANK YOU. 
CONGRESSMAN HAL ROGERS. 
CONGRESSMAN JAMES CARMER. 
JAMES, THE WHOLE GROUP. 
THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. 
WE HAVE TAX CUTS. 
BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS. 
WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE.
WE HAD OBAMA CARE REPEALED AND 
REPLACED. 
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT 
VOTE. 
BUT WE'LL GET IT DONE. 
WE HAD A LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT 
THAT NIGHT. 
A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAPPOINT. 
BUT, IT'S ESSENTIALLY DONE 
ANYWAY. 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, IT'S DONE. 
AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE 
REMNANT OF OBAMA CARE IS KEPT 
YOUR PREMIUMS DOWN BELOW WHAT 
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 
THROUGH GOOD MANAGEMENT. 
THROUGH SECRETARY ALEX AZAR. 
NOW A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS 
HELPED US SO MUCH. 
HE'S REALLY SMART. 
BUT I HAVE TO SAY HIS WIFE THE 
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAS BECOME 
MAYBE THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE 
FAMILY. 
I SAID RAND, YOU HAVE TO GET 
HER ON TELEVISION MORE. 
SHE'S BECOME THE BIGGEST STAR 
IN THE FAMILY. 
YES. 
A MAN THAT HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
FRIEND OF MINE. 
AND HE'S REALLY SOMETHING. 
HE'S A GREAT GUY. 
NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 
NOT EVERYBODY. 
IT'S LIKE MITCH. 
NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS MITCH IS A 
GREAT GUY. 
HE'S A GREAT PEOPLE. 
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS 
TO YOU WHEN YOU GROW UP IN 
KENTUCKY I GUESS. 
RIGHT? 
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
BUT I CALL RAND A SENATOR OF 
TREMENDOUS COMMON SENSE. 
THAT'S A GREAT COMPLIMENT. 
COMMON SENSE. 
RAND IS YOUNG AND SPRY. 
COME UP HERE FOR A SECOND. 
COME UP HERE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S 
TIRED. 
I CAN TAKE 20 OR 30 MINUTES, 
RIGHT? 
NO, I'LL TELL YOU A VERY QUICK 
STORY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. 
THIS SHOWS HOW HE IS DIFFERENT 
FROM ANY OTHER POLITICIAN AND 
WHY YOU'RE ALL OUT HERE. 
I WENT TO HIM WITH AN IDEA ON 
HEALTH CARE. 
I SAID, LET'S LET INDIVIDUALS 
BUY IN A GROUP. 
LET THEM JOIN AN ASSOCIATION. 
LET COMPETITION DRIVE PRICES 
DOWN. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT'S A 
GREAT IDEA. 
WHAT DID HIS STAFF SAY? 
OH NO, WE COULD NEVER DO THAT. 
MIDDLEMANNAGEMENT SAID WE COULD 
NEVER DO THAT. 
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID MAKE IT 
SO AND HE DID IT. 
>> BUT IT'S TRUE, WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND 
RAND HAD THIS CONCEPT THAT HE 
WAS SO FAR ADVANCED. 
EVEN THE EXPERTS DIDN'T KNOW. 
THEY SAID HE'S RIGHT. 
HE'S RIGHT. 
ASSOCIATION HEALTH CARE WHERE 
YOU CAN TEAM UP WITH OTHER 
COMPANIES. 
YOU TEAM UP. 
YOU GET PHENOMENAL PRICING. 
YOU HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH 
CROSSING BORDERS. 
AND THAT WAS RAND'S INITIAL 
IDEA. 
THAT'S TRUE. 
AND IT'S DOING REALLY WELL. 
INEXPENSIVE AND TERRIFIC. 
AND ANOTHER MAN, A VERY SPECIAL 
FRIEND OF MINE. 
A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. 
DECIDED TO WIN AND RUN IN 
KENTUCKY. 
THIS GUY WAS REALLY A 
SUCCESSFUL GUY. 
HE SAW THINGS HAPPENING IN 
KENTUCKY. 
HE WANTS TO GET THE JOB DONE. 
YOU HAVE YOUR LOWEST YOU HAVE 
YOUR BEST INCOMES IN HISTORY. 
YOU HAVE JOBS AND COMPANIES 
FLOWING BACK IN. 
ALL OF THAT WOULDN'T MATTER IF 
I DIDN'T LIKE HIM. 
IF I DIDN'T LIKE HIM, I WOULD 
SAY FORGET ABOUT HIM. 
BUT I LIKE HIM A LOT. 
HE'S A TERRIFIC MAN AND A 
TERRIFIC GOVERNOR. 
MATT BEVIN. 
THANK YOU MATT. 
THANKS MATT. 
SO WE'RE HERE FOR A TRULY 
SPECIAL GUY. 
THESE ARE ALL SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE. 
WHAT DID WE WIN BY, 38? 
WE WON BY A LOT. 
I HAVE A FEELING THAT MITCH 
MCCONNELL IN TWO YEARS IS GOING 
TO DO VERY GOOD. 
VERY GOOD. 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE 
TOGETHER. 
BUT HE IS BETTER WHEN I WAS 
PRESIDENT THAN HE WAS WHEN 
ANYONE ELSE WAS PRESIDENT. 
DOING MUCH BETTER. 
BUT I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE 
LEADER WE ARE ALL HERE FOR 
TONIGHT. 
ALL OF THE CONGRESSMEN KNOW 
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. 
HE HAS BEEN SO STRONG ON ALL OF 
THE THINGS THAT WE STAND FOR. 
TAX CUTS. 
REGULATION CUTS. 
EVERY SINGLE THING WE PASS. 
HE HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. 
THE DEMOCRATS, IT'S THE ONLY 
WAY THEY CAN WIN. 
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. 
TO THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE, LOOKING 
AT MOVIE SCREENS, WE LOVE YOU. 
YOU HAVE TO SEE THE LINES THAT 
GO ALL THE WAY BACK. 
MANY MILES. 
BUT, A LOT OF THEM SAY IT, 
THEY'RE WATCHING SCREENS, I 
LIKE YOUR LOCATION BETTER, DO 
YOU AGREE? 
BUT, THIS IS A SPECIAL GUY. 
AND, NORMALLY, I WOULDN'T MAKE 
A TRIP. 
BUT HERE, I HAD TWO REASONS. 
ONE WAS I LOVE THE STATE OF 
KENTUCKY. 
AND THE OTHER WAS THAT ANDY 
BARR IS A GREAT CONGRESSMAN. 
ANDY, COME ON UP. 
>>  MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO 
KENTUCKY'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT. 
HE SWING DISTRICT THAT  
YEARS AGO, YOU SENT A MESSAGE 
TO THE NATION BECAUSE YOU WON 
IT BY 15 POINTS. 
AND WELCOME TO MADISON COUNTY. 
A COUNTY  MR. PRESIDENT, THAT 
YOU WON BY A WHOPPING 32 
POINTS. 
HOME OF EASTERN KENTUCKY 
UNIVERSITY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT 
NOW. 
THE MOST PRO VETERAN UNIVERSITY 
IN AMERICA.
THE WORKERS FROM EASTERN 
KENTUCKY WHO VALUE A PAYCHECK 
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, AND  
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR 
ENDING THE WAR ON COAL. 
AND MADISON COUNTY HOME OF THE 
TRAINING OF KENTUCKY STATE 
POLICE. 
TWO AWESOME POLICE DEPARTMENTS. 
AND DEMOCRAT SHERIFF MIKE 
COYLE, THE SHERIFF OF THE YEAR 
WHO SAYS  MR. PRESIDENT, TO 
KEEP THE DRUGS OUT OF OUR 
COMMUNITIES. 
WE NEED TO BUILD THE WALL. 
AND WHEN I FIRST MET YOU, WHEN 
I FIRST MET YOU  MR. PRESIDENT, 
I TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR DRUG 
PROBLEM IN KENTUCKY. 
AND YOU LISTENED. 
AND SIX MONTHS LATER I WAS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE WITH YOU WHEN 
YOU DECLARED A NATIONAL PUBLIC 
HEALTH EMERGENCY TONIGHT THE 
DRUG EPIDEMIC. 
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. 
AND WE WORKED TOGETHER. 
AND WE FUNDED THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO FIGHT 
A DRUG CRISIS IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY. 
THIS PRESIDENT IS A MAN OF 
ACTION. 
A MAN OF ACTION. 
OTHER PEOPLE RESIST. 
BUT, THIS PRESIDENT GETS 
RESULTS. 
AND SO, I WANT TO TURN IT OVER 
TO HIM. 
BUT I JUST WANT TO REMEMBER ONE 
SPECIAL NIGHT TWO YEARS AGO IN 
CLEVELAND. 
THE MOMENT I KNEW THIS MAN 
WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
REMEMBER. 
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID. 
HE SAID THAT MY OPPONENT HAS A 
SLOGAN AND THAT SLOGAN IS I'M 
WITH HER. 
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID NEXT? 
WHAT HE SAID WAS I HAVE A 
DIFFERENT SLOGAN. 
AND THAT SLOGAN IS I'M WITH 
YOU. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
MR. PRESIDENT, I'M WITH YOU TO 
FIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! 
>> THANK YOU. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
NOW YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING 
THAT ANDY DIDN'T SAY IS THAT 
SHE PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR 
THAT SLOGAN. 
AND THE MORNING AFTER I CAME UP 
WITH MY LITTLE FEEL ON IT, THEY 
CHANGED THE SLOGAN. 
IT WAS GONE. 
IT WAS GONE. 
BUT, WE WEREN'T GONE BECAUSE 
THIS WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST 
MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF 
AMERICAN POLITICS. 
AND OUR SLOGAN WAS A GREAT 
SLOGAN. 
I THINK IT'S THE GREATEST 
SLOGAN THAT ANYBODY WILL EVER 
COME UP WITH. 
THOUGH IN TWO YEARS WE HAVE A 
NEW ONE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. 
OURS IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
LOOK AT ALL THESE HATS. 
AND AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING, 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FAST. 
IT'S CALLED KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
THAT WILL BE IT. 
RIGHT? 
SO I'M HERE FOR ANDY BARR. 
A VOTE FOR SAFE COMMUNITY, 
STRONG BORDERS AND KENTUCKY 
VALUES. 
A VOTE FOR ANDY'S OPPONENT, I 
HAD TO DO A LITTLE CHECKING. 
WHO'S HE RUNNING AGAINST? 
WHO? 
THIS IS AN EXTREME LIBERAL 
NAMED AMY MCGRAFF. 
CHOSEN BY NANCY PELOSI. 
MAXINE WATERS. 
THAT'S A REAL BEAUTY. 
AND, THE RADICAL DEMOCRAT MOB. 
NOW, AMY SUPPORTS A SOCIALIST 
TAKEOVER OF YOUR HEALTH CARE. 
WHICH BY THE WAY MEANS YOUR 
TAXES ARE GOING TO TRIPLE IF 
YOU'RE LUCKY. 
SHE SUPPORTS OPEN BORDERS. 
SHE NEEDS THE TAX HIKES TO 
COVER THE THROUGH THE ROOF 
GARBAGE THAT YOU WANT NO PART 
OF. 
AND SHE WANTS TO IMMEDIATELY 
DECIMATE YOUR NOW THRIVING COAL 
INDUSTRY. 
SO IF YOU WANT TO STOP NANCY 
PELOSI FROM BECOMING SPEAKER OF 
THE HOUSE. 
NO. 
WE CAN'T DO THAT. 
THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD. 
AND YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND 
VOTE FOR ANDY BARR. 
A GREAT MAN. 
GREAT LEADER. 
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I MUST TELL 
YOU, KENTUCKY, YOU'RE ALWAYS 
INVOLVED AT THE MIDDLE OF 
POLITICS. 
THE ELECTION OF ANDY IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT THING. 
COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN UNBELIEVABLE CONTINUED 
SUCCESS AND FRANKLY, FAILURE 
WHERE WE FIGHT FOR TWO MORE 
YEARS WITH THESE PEOPLE. 
ITH THESE OBSTRUCTI 
SO, IT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT 
RACE. 
IT COULD BE THE CONGRESSMAN. 
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
THEM. 
THEY'RE SO FAR AHEAD IN THEIR 
RACES. 
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 
THEM ANY MORE. 
RIGHT? 
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 
THEM. 
WE WERE TALKING BACKSTAGE AND 
THEY SAID IT. 
THIS COULD BE THE MOST 
IMPORTANT RACE THERE IS. 
SO GET OUT AND VOTE. 
WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. 
A MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR 
SOCIALIST HEALTH CARE. 
BY THE WAY, IT DOESN'T WORK 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
IT DOESN'T WORK. 
IT'S GOOD IF YOU DON'T MIND 
WAITING FIVE WEEKS TO SEE A 
DOCTOR. 
THEY COME FROM SOCIALIST 
COUNTRIES. 
FRANKLY, THEY COME FROM CANADA. 
BECAUSE, THEY WANT TO USE OUR 
DOCTORS. 
THEY COME FROM ALL OVER THE 
WORLD. 
AND WE'RE MAKING IT NOW, 
BETTER. 
AND THEY WANT TO DESTROY 
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN BUILT. 
ALL OF THAT GREAT FOUNDATION. 
THEY WANT TO OUTLAW THE PRIVATE 
INSURANCE PLANS OF 2.4 MILLION 
KENTUCKY RESIDENTS AND SOME OF 
THOSE PLANS ARE FANTASTIC. 
AND INEXPENSIVE. 
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN WOULD 
OBLITERATE MEDICARE AND 
TERMINATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 
FOR MERELY 250,000 KENTUCKY 
SENIORS WHO DEPEND ON IT. 
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT 
MEDICARE. 
AND WE WILL. 
FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS WHO HAVE 
EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT. 
AND REPUBLICANS ONLY WILL 
ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH 
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. 
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT IT. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RADICAL 
SOCIALISM AND OPEN BORDERS. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH ICE. 
AND THEY WANT TO TURN AMERICA 
INTO A GIANT SANCTUARY FOR 
CRIMINAL ALIENS AND MS-13 
THUGS. 
AND DON'T KID YOURSELF. 
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 
AND THEY WANT TO GET RID OF 
ICE. 
THEY THINK ICE ISN'T NICE. 
DID YOU EVER SEE WHAT THEY'RE 
DEALING WITH? 
FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE 
INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS. 
THEY HAVE A JOB THAT NOBODY IN 
THIS GROUP WANTS. 
THEY GO IN THERE AND THEY MEET 
THE MOST VILE, MOST VICIOUS 
PEOPLE AT WORK LIKE IT'S A DAY 
AT THE OFFICE. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 
YEAH, YOU MIGHT DO IT. 
THIS GUY MIGHT DO IT. 
YOU WANT A JOB? 
I'LL GET IT TO YOU. 
LOOK AT THIS GUY. 
THIS GUY WILL DO IT. 
I'M LOOKING AT YOU. 
HE MIGHT DO IT. 
YOU MIGHT DO IT. 
BUT, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. 
THEY GO IN THERE AND THEY 
LIBERATE TOWNS. 
THESE PEOPLE CAME IN BY THE 
THOUSANDS. 
AND, WE'RE TAKING THEM OUT BY 
THE THOUSANDS. 
THEY'RE GETTING OUT. 
THEY'RE GETTING OUT. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY 
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-
ABIDING AMERICANS. 
NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. 
AND, REPUBLICANS AND YOU KNOW 
THIS, YOU KNOW THIS. 
REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY WITH 
THE HEROS OF ICE AND BORDER 
PATROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
ONE BY ONE, WE ARE FIGHTING THE 
ILLEGAL ALIEN PREDATORS, DRUG 
DEALERS, M S-13 KILLERS AND 
SENDING THEM BACK HOME. 
WE ARE LIBERATING AMERICA'S 
CITIES AND TOWNS. 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
THE ONLY IMMIGRATION POLICY 
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT IS CATCH AND 
RELEASE. 
YOU CATCH A CRIMINAL THUG, YOU 
TAKE THE NAME AND YOU RELEASE 
THEM. 
SAY PLEASE SHOW UP IN FIVE 
YEARS TO COURT. 
NOW, NUMBER ONE, IT'S 
RIDICULOUS, NUMBER TWO, THEY 
NEVER SHOW UP. 
WHAT A MESS. 
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION 
LAWS IN THE WORLD. 
THE WORLD LAUGHS AT US. 
BUT, WE'RE GETTING THEM 
CHANGED. 
WE NEED SOME MORE REPUBLICANS. 
WE NEED SOME VOTES. 
IF YOU ELECT REPUBLICANS THIS 
NOVEMBER, WE WILL PASS 
LEGISLATION TO END CATCH AND 
RELEASE. 
HAVE YOU HEARD THE OTHER ONE? 
LOTTERY. 
LOTTERY. 
LOTTERY. 
OKAY? 
NAMES. 
COMING TO THE UNITED STATES. 
LET ME ASK YOU. 
THESE COUNTRIES SET UP 
LOTTERIES. 
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THEY'RE 
GIVING US THEIR FINEST? 
NO. 
THIS IS A LOTTERY. 
THIS WAS CHUCK SCHUMER'S 
SPECIAL DEAL FOR THIS COUNTRY. 
HOW CRAZY. 
THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IN 
MANHATTAN WHERE I LIVE. 
WHERE I LOVE. 
RIGHT ALONG THE HUDSON RIVER. 
HE'S DRIVING A CAR DOWN THIS 
ROADWAY WHERE THE SPEED LIMIT 
IS 35. 
HE'S GOING ABOUT 70. 
AND, HE DECIDES TO MAKE A RIGHT 
TURN INTO A BEAUTIFUL PARK THAT 
GOES ALONG THE RIVER WITH LOTS 
OF PEOPLE. 
MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 
NOBODY EVERY TALKS ABOUT THE 
PEOPLE THAT WERE HORRIBLY 
INJURED. 
THEY LOST LEGS, THEY LOST ARMS. 
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
RUNNING. 
THEY WANT TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN 
SHAPE. 
THEY WERE WORKING OUT. 
THEY WERE WALKING HAND IN HAND 
TOGETHER. 
THEY'RE DEAD. 
THEY'RE HORRIBLY WOUNDED. 
MANY WILL NEVER EVER RECOVER. 
AND WHAT HAPPENS? 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? 
IT WILL BE YEARS OF LITIGATION. 
HE CAME IN. 
AND THEN HE TOOK CHAIN 
MIGRATION. 
AND HE BROUGHT HIS MOTHER, 
FATHER, BROTHER, SISTER, AUNT, 
AND GRANDFATHER. 
NONE OF THEM WORKED. 
IT ENDED UP BEING APPROXIMATELY 
22 PEOPLE CAME IN. 
IT'S CALLED A CHAIN. 
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? 
A CHAIN. 
AND WE'RE STUCK WITH THEM. 
WE'RE STUCK WITH THESE PEOPLE. 
AND I DON'T WANT A CHAIN. 
I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR 
COUNTRY ON A MERIT BASED 
SYSTEM. 
AND I WANT THEM TO HELP ALL OF 
THE GREAT COMPANIES THAT ARE 
MOVING BACK INTO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THEY'RE MOVING TO MICHIGAN, 
OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA. 
THEY'RE MOVING TO NORTH AND 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
THEY'RE COMING IN. 
MOVING TO FLORIDA. 
AND YES, THEY'RE MOVING INTO 
KENTUCKY. 
AND WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE, WE 
HAVE BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL, WE 
NEED PEOPLE TO COME THIS THE 
WITH ALL THESE COMPANIES. 
BUT WE NEED GREAT PEOPLE WHO 
LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT RESPECT OUR COUNTRY. 
AND THAT WANT TO WORK.
THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY AND 
POSTERITY. 
SINCE THE LAST ELECTION. 
THE FAKERS NEVER WOULD HAVE 
ALLOWED ME TO SAY. 
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS HAVE I 
EVER SAID THIS DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD HEADLINES. 
WE HAVE CREATED OVER 4.2 
MILLION NEW JOBS AND LIFTED 
OVER 4 MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF 
FOOD STAMPS. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? 
THE SECOND FOOD STAMPS, IT 
MEANS NUMBER ONE, WE GET RID OF 
AN UNBELIEVABLE COST, YOU 
WOWEDN'T BELIEVE IT. 
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 
BUT YOU GET A LOT OF HAPPY 
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING. 
IT'S A GREAT THING. 
A GREAT THING. 
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY 600,000 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
MANUFACTURING IS NEVER GOING TO 
COME BACK. 
NEVER GOING TO COME BACK. 
REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION, YOU THINK 
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? 
YOU NEED A MAGIC WAND. 
I GUESS WE HAD THE MAGIC WAND. 
WE HAD THE MAGIC WAND. 
AND THESE ARE GREAT JOBS. 
THESE ARE IMPORTANT JOBS. 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
COMPANIES POURING BACK IN. 
MANUFACTURING. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL 
EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS 
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 
HISTORY. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN 
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAS 
REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 
HISTORY. 
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STILL 
SAYING THIS. 
I AM SO SORRY. 
I APOLOGIZE TO THE WOMEN IN THE 
ROOM. 
REMEMBER I GOT 52%. 
THEY KEPT SAYING, THE FAKE 
NEWS. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
REMEMBER, HE SAID, THEY WERE 
ALL SAYING HE WILL NOT DO WELL 
WITH WOMEN. 
WOW DID WE DO WELL WITH WOMEN. 
DID WE DO WELL. 
HE WILL. 
FAKE NEWS. 
WE DID REALLY WELL WITH WOMEN. 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE WOMEN'S 
UNEMPLOYMENT, MITCH, IS NOT AT 
A HISTORIC LOW. 
IT'S ONLY THE BEST NUMBER IN 65 
YEARS. 
WE LET DOWN WOMEN. 
WE LET DOWN WOMEN. 
65 YEARS, 3.6%. 
AS THE CHARTS GROW JUST A 
LITTLE BIT, IT WILL BE HISTORIC 
VERY SOON. 
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE 
DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF 
WINNING. 
YOU KNOW ABOUT WINNING. 
YOU REALLY KNOW ABOUT WINNING. 
YOU PEOPLE ARE WINNING. 
THOSE HORSES WIN. 
I'M JUST AFRAID THAT KENTUCKY 
IS WINNING TOO MUCH. 
YOU'RE GOING TO SEND MATT TO 
SEE RAND PAUL AND MITCH 
MCCONNELL. 
AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO COME 
TO THE OVAL ALWAYS TO SEE ME 
AND SAY  MR. PRESIDENT, WE 
CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE. 
KENTUCKY IS WINNING TOO MUCH. 
THEY CAN'T DO IT. 
THEY DON'T LIKE IT. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT 
ANYMORE. 
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WE'RE 
WINNING SO MUCH, WE JUST CAN'T 
STAND IT. 
I'M GOING TO SAY MITCH, AND 
MATT, AND RAND, I'M SORRY. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING. 
WE'RE GOING TO WIN MORE. 
AND MORE, AND MORE, AND MORE. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING. 
I'M SORRY FOLKS. 
AND I WILL SEND THEM HAPPILY 
BACK TO KENTUCKY. 
YOU'RE WINNING A LOT. 
WE WON TODAY. 
WE WON TODAY WITH A GREAT 
PASTOR. 
PASTOR BRUNSON. 
LAST WEEK, I ANNOUNCED WE ARE 
REPLACING THE HORROR SHOW. 
ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER 
MADE KNOWN AS NAFTA WITH AN 
INCREDIBLE BRAND NEW U.S. 
MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT CALLED 
THE USMCA. 
AND, EVEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
SAYING WOW, WHAT A GREAT DEAL 
THAT IS. 
WE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. 
WE MAY ACTUALLY GET BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT. 
THOUGH IF IT'S TOO GOOD. 
THEY WON'T SUPPORT IT. 
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. 
NO. 
I WILL SAY. 
EVEN CHUCK SCHUMER LIKED IT. 
HE SAID THAT'S A GOOD DEAL. 
WE'VE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER 
ACTION ON CHINA'S ABUSIVE TRADE 
PRACTICES. 
CHINA, AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT 
FOR CHINA. 
WE ALL DO. 
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THEIR 
PRESIDENT. 
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE HEAD OF 
CHINA. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY'VEBEEN MAKING 300 BILLION 
TO $500 BILLION A YEAR TAKING 
IT OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. 
AND I DON'T BLAME CHINA. 
I BLAME OUR PAST LEADERS 
BECAUSE THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE 
LET IT HAPPEN. 
I DON'T BLAME CHINA. 
AND THANKS TO OUR STRONG TRADE, 
AND ECONOMIC POLICIES, BRADY 
INDUSTRIES BROKE GROUND ON A 
NEW BILLION DOLLAR ALUMINUM 
MILL THAT WILL CREATE UP TO 
1,500 JOBS RIGHT NEXT TO 
ASHLAND, KENTUCKY. 
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT? 
ASHLAND. 
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE 
ALSO PASS THE BIGGEST PACKAGE 
OF TAX CUTS AND TAX REFORMS. 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE TAKEN HISTORIC ACTION 
TO REDUCE THE PRICE OF 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 
YOU SAW THREE WEEKS AGO, A LOT 
OF DRUG COMPANIES ANNOUNCED A 
VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. 
I SAID TO SECRETARY ALEX 
AUGUSTA, THIS IS NO GOOD. 
THIS IS NO GOOD. 
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING, I WANT 
TO CALL THEM. 
AND I CALLED THE HEAD OF FIZER. 
BIG COMPANY, I GUESS LIKE THE 
BIGGEST. 
BIG, BIG DRUG COMPANY. 
I CALLED THE HEADS OF THESE 
COMPANIES. 
I SAID SIR, SIR, WE WILL 
IMMEDIATELY DROP THE PRICE BACK 
TO WHERE IT WAS. 
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THAT? 
AND RAND PAUL, IT'S THE FIRST 
TIME I REALIZED HOW POWERFUL IT 
WAS TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
NO, THEY REDUCED ...  
AND BY THE WAY, I KID. 
BUT, I DO. 
I RESPECT THAT THEY DID THAT. 
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 
AND NOW, BECAUSE OF WHAT 
SECRETARY AZAR IS DOING, YOU'RE 
GOING TO SEE DRUG PRICING, 
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS GOING DOWN. 
WE HAVE COUNTRIES, THE EXACT 
SAME PILL, THE EXACT SAME 
PRESCRIPTION MADE IN THE EXACT 
SAME FACTORY OR PLANT IN 
CANADA. 
AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OVER 
THE WORLD. 
IS MUCH LESS. 
SOMETIMES 50%, SOMETIMES MUCH 
LESS. 
THAN WHAT AMERICANS PAY. 
WE'RE DOING A NUMBER. 
I'M GOING TO BE HATED SO MUCH 
BY SOME PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY 
THAT MADE A FORTUNE. 
BUT, WE'RE GETTING DRUG PRICES 
WAY DOWN. 
AND WE STARTED IT LAST FRIDAY. 
WITH THE SIGNING OF TWO BILLS. 
AND SOMETHING THAT THE 
CONGRESSMAN REALLY HELPED ME 
WITH. 
ALL OF THEM IN THE ROOM. 
AND ANDY. 
IN PARTICULAR, WE HELP, RIGHT 
NOW, GET CRITICALLY ILL, 
TERMINAL PATIENTS, ACCESS TO 
LIFE SAVING TREATMENTS. 
WE JUST PASSED RIGHT TO TRY. 
RIGHT TO TRY. 
I HOPE NOBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS 
TO USE IT. 
BUT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS 
TERMINALLY ILL. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST DRUG 
COMPANIES AND THE GREATEST 
RESEARCH IN THE WORLD BY FAR. 
NOBODY CLOSE. 
BUT WE HAVE A PIPELINE. 
IT WOULD TAKE 12 TO 15 YEARS TO 
GET IT APPROVED. 
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. 
BUT IF WE HAD SOMETHING THAT 
REALLY SHOWED GREAT PROMISE, 
TOWARD A PROBLEM THAT SOMEBODY 
HAD WHO IS TERMINALLY ILL. 
44 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
GET THIS PASSED. 
THEY COULDN'T. 
NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. 
BETWEEN THE INSURANCE 
COMPANIES, THE LIABILITIES, THE 
COUNTRY ITSELF. 
THE LAWSUITS. 
SO I GOT EVERYBODY IN A ROOM. 
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF. 
HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW FRIENDS? 
IF THEY HAVE MONEY, THEY TRAVEL 
ALL OVER THE WORLD BEGGING AND 
LOOKING FOR A CURE. 
THEY WANT HOPE. 
IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY, THEY 
GO HOME. 
THEY HAVE NO HOPE. 
AND WE HAVE RIGHT TO TRY 
PASSED. 
A MONTH-AND-A-HALF AGO. 
ALREADY IT'S HAD AN INCREDIBLE 
IMPACT. 
INCREDIBLE IMPACT. 
44 YEARS. 
SO NOW A PATIENT IS TERMINALLY 
ILL. 
WE MAKE THEM SIGN A DOCUMENT. 
VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT. 
AND WE GO IN AND WE WORK WITH 
THEM AND WE SEE IF WE CAN HELP 
THEM. 
AND WE HAVE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE 
RESULTS ALREADY. 
SO, I JUST WANT TO THANK ANDY 
BARR AND ALL OF THE CONGRESSMEN 
HERE. 
AND MITCH AND RAND BECAUSE WE 
GOT IT PASSED. 
WE GOT IT PASSED. 
MANY, MANY YEARS THEY WORKED ON 
IT. 
THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE. 
WE ALSO PASSED VETERAN'S 
CHOICE. 
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT 
TO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR INSTEAD 
OF WAITING ONLINE. 
FOR 12 DAYS, 24 DAYS, 38 DAYS. 
WE HAVE OUR VETERANS. 
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH 
THE VETERANS. 
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THINGS. 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE WAITING 
IN LINE FOR SOMETIMES MONTHS IF 
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. 
WE HAD PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE 
AND THEY WEREN'T VERY SICK. 
BY THE TIME THEY SAW A DOCTOR 
THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL. 
NOW, IF THERE'S A WAY. 
BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT DOCTORS 
IN THE VA. 
THAT'S ONE THING EVERYBODY 
TELLS ME. 
CAN'T GET TO THEM. 
NOW, IF THERE'S A WAIT, YOU GO 
TO A LOCAL DOCTOR. 
YOU GET YOURSELF TAKEN CARE OF 
AND WE PAY FOR THE BILL. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE. 
TOOK OVER 40 YEARS. 
I USED TO SAY TO PEOPLE WHY 
DON'T WE DO THAT? 
I SAID LISTEN. 
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. 
THESE LINES ARE TERRIBLE. 
28 DAY, 30 DAYS. 
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. 
THE GREATEST IDEA I THINK I 
HAVE EVER HAD. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM GO TO 
A PRIVATE DOCTOR INSTEAD OF 
WAITING IN LINE. 
WE ARE TRYING TO GET THAT 
PASSED 40 YEARS. 
YOU HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE. 
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED BUT 
WE'RE GOOD AT GETTING THINGS 
PASSED. 
WE GOT IT PASSED. 
RAND AND MITCH AND ANDY. 
WE GOT IT PASSED AND THE 
LANDMARK VA ACCOUNTABILITY LAW 
TO ENSURE ANYONE WHO MISTREATS 
OUR VETERANS WILL BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
JIM, YOU MISTREATED OUR 
VETERAN, JIM. 
JIM, YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT. 
WE JUST SECURED $700 BILLION 
AND $716 BILLION. 
TWO YEARS, TO FULLY REBUILD THE 
AMERICAN MILITARY. 
BIGGER, STRONGER, MORE POWERFUL 
THAN EVER BEFORE. 
WE ARE GIVING WARRIORS THEIR 
LARGEST PAY RAISE IN OVER A 
DECADE. 
AND AT MY DIRECTION AND WE NEED 
RAND AND WE NEED  MITCH'S HELP. 
LET THEM KNOW HOW POPULAR IT 
IS. 
IT'S ALL ABOUT SPACE. 
ALL ABOUT SPACE. 
EVERYTHING WILL SOON BE ALL 
ABOUT SPACE. 
SO LET RAND AND MITCH KNOW 
ABOUT THIS. 
AT MY DIRECTION. 
THE PENTAGON IS NOW WORKING TO 
CREATE THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES KNOWN AS 
THE SPACE FORCE. 
NOW THEY HAVE TO DO IT. 
I PUT THEM ON THE SPOT. 
I PUT THEM ON THE SPOT. 
NOW THEY HAVE TO DO IT. 
IT'S VERY POPULAR. 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST APPLAUSES I 
GET IS WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE 
SPACE FORCE. 
CHINA AND RUSSIA HAVE ALREADY 
STARTED. 
THEY HAVE STARTED BUT WE HAVE 
THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE 
WORLD. 
WE MAKE THE GREATEST EQUIPMENT 
IN THE WORLD. 
WE MAKE THE GREATEST ROCKETS 
AND MISSILES AND TANKS AND 
SHIPS IN THE WORLD. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-SIDED 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
AND WHEN I CAME TO OFFICE, 
WEEKS BEFORE I WAS GIVEN RUN 
DOWNS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND 
IRAN IS JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN 
WILL THEY TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT 
ANYMORE FOLKS. 
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT 
ANYMORE. 
THEY HAVE A LITTLE DISASTER 
GOING. 
THEY HAVE RIOTS IN THE STREET. 
THEIR CURRENCY IS SHOT. 
THEY'LL BE COMING TO US SOME 
DAY PROBABLY NOT TOO FAR OUT 
AND SAY WE'D LIKE TO MAKE A 
DEAL AND THAT'S FINE. 
THAT'S GOOD. 
BUT A REAL DEAL. 
NOT THE JOKE OF THE DEAL MADE 
BY THE PAST ADMINISTRATION. 
AN WE RECOGNIZED THE CAPITAL OF 
ISRAEL. 
AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY 
IN JERUSALEM. 
RIGHT?
TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE 
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS. 
BUT, WE'RE JUST GETTING 
STARTED. 
IF YOU VOTE TO ELECT REPUBLICAN 
HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO CUT YOUR 
TAXES. 
CUT YOUR REGULATIONS. 
AND, RAISE YOUR INCOMES VERY, 
VERY SUBSTANTIALLY. 
WE, UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATS, WILL 
PROTECT MEDICARE AND PROTECT 
SOCIAL SECURITY. 
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID DURING THE 
DEBATES? 
WE WILL PROTECT IT. 
WE WILL DEFEND YOUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT. 
AND PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO FREE 
SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. 
WITH YOUR HELP, MITCH 
MCCONNELL, RAND PAUL, AND ALL 
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK SO WELL 
WITH US WILL CONTINUE TO 
CONFIRM INCREDIBLE PRO 
CONSTITUTION JUDGES. 
NOT RADICAL FAR LEFT JUDGES WHO 
WILL REWRITE YOUR CONSTITUTION 
AND REPLACE YOUR KENTUCKY 
VALUES. 
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 
84 JUDGES. 
THINK OF THAT. 
THAT'S A RECORD. 
THAT'S A RECORD. 
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT TO 
GO. 
A RECORD. 
84 JUDGES APPROVED. 
WHAT A DIFFERENCE. 
GOING TO BE BY THE TIME WE 
FINISH, MAYBE 50% OF THE COURT. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 
MAYBE 50%. 
WE'LL FULLY SECURE THE BORDER. 
WE'LL PASS KATE'S LAW. 
STOP SANCTUARY CITIES. 
END THE VISA LOTTERY AN CHAIN 
MIGRATION. 
AND WE WILL KEEP THE CRIMINALS, 
DRUG DEALERS AND TERRORISTS OUT 
OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS MORE OF 
OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO 
WORK. 
FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. 
BUT, TO ACHIEVE THIS FUTURE, TO 
CONTINUE THE GREATEST MOVEMENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 
AND MAYBE OF ANY COUNTRY, YOU 
NEED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR THE 
GREAT PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY. 
AND WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP 
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
ON NOVEMBER 6, I NEED YOU TO 
GET YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, 
YOUR NEIGHBORS, YOUR COWORKERS. 
AND GET OUT AND VOTE FOR ANDY 
BARR. 
GREAT MAN. 
A VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESS IS A VOTE FOR MORE 
JOBS, MORE WEALTH, AND MORE 
PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE 
GOOD OLD USA. 
IT'S A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR 
LAWS. 
AND TO RESPECT THE HEROS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY ARE HEROS. 
AN A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT 
POLITICS OF HATRED, ANGER AND 
DIVISION. 
AND TO CELEBRATE THE GREATNESS 
AND THE GLORY OF BEING AN 
AMERICAN. 
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA. 
IT'S NOT UP TO THE PENDANTS. 
IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE YOUR 
OWN FAITH. 
YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH YOUR 
VOTE TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY. 
DEPEND YOUR VALUES, YOUR FAITH, 
AND YOUR DIGNITY. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY. 
AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING 
BACK OUR COUNTRY. 
RETURNING POWER TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.
THIS GREAT STATE WAS SETTLED BY 
REALLY, HOW TOUGH? 
HOW SMART? 
BY TOUGH, TOUGH MEN AND EVEN 
TOUGHER WOMEN, BY THE WAY. 
BUT IT WAS SETTLED BY TOUGH 
MEN, PIONEER WOMEN WHO BRAVED 
THE WILDERNESS AND DEFIED THE 
DANGERS TO BUILD A LIFE AND A 
HOME. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES. 
THEY LOVED THEIR COUNTRY. 
AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. 
THESE COURAGEOUS KENTUCKY 
PATRIOTS DIDN'T SHED THEIR 
BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS SO WE 
COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE OTHERS 
TRY TO ERASE THEIR LEGACY AND 
DESTROY OUR PROUD AMERICAN 
HERITAGE. 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM AND 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN, 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK. 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, 
WIN. 
WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN, WE WILL 
NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER. 
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ONTO 
GLORIOUS VICTORY. 
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS AND 
OUR HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE, 
AND BLUE. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, 
ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU KENTUCKY! 
VOTE FOR ANDY BARR! 
[ YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU 
WANT PLAYING ] 
>> THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 
RICHMOND, KENTUCKY. 
THE PRESIDENT HOSTED A MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN CAMPAIGN 
RALLY IN SUPPORT OF REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESSMAN ANDY BARR. 
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE AHEAD. 
YOU'RE WATCHING CBSN. 
ALWAYS ON.
