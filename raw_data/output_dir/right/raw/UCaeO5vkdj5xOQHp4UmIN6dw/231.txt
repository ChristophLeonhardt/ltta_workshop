1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,860
now let me stipulate one thing I I don't

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that Christine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford is the villain</font>

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,700
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this situation I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's made</font>

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,380
decisions and behaved in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,179
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> inexcusable but the villains are</font>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats and they obviously are</font>

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,119
using her they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happily eagerly</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,119
destroying Brett Kavanaugh and they're

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,740
pretending suddenly to care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about women</font>

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,970
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though they didn't care about women</font>

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">when Bill Clinton was raping them</font>

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">allegedly they didn't care about women</font>

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">when Ted Kennedy drowned one in his car</font>

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">so now they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretending to SAR they're</font>

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">liars</font>

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,820
but what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> this even more disgusting</font>

17
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,649
what makes this just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so dark and evil is</font>

18
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,860
the reason why they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah</font>

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,969
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they want to prevent</font>

20
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,379
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cavanaugh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for being confirmed</font>

21
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">but why do they want to prevent why are</font>

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,530
they so desperate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent it in fact</font>

23
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,640
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so desperate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of</font>

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,440
Cavanaugh with it now there's a few

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,670
Democrats<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone on the record</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

26
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">and said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if Cavanaugh is</font>

27
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,829
confirmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the Democrats are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

28
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:53,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Congress they're going to</font>

29
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,190
investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> him anyway that's how</font>

30
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,420
desperate they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

31
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they will investigate a sitting</font>

32
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,199
Supreme Court justice<font color="#E5E5E5"> for because of</font>

33
00:01:01,199 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">allegations from 35 years ago</font>
