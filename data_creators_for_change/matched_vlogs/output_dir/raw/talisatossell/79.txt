Hi guys! In today's video, I'm going to be testing out some popular edible

2
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:06,265
slime recipes, and I really hope that you enjoy this video.

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:08,995
For method one, we're going to need some starbursts and I decided to use all

4
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:11,855
of the red ones just so it had a matching colour, and I popped

5
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:14,905
it into the microwave for 15 seconds before getting some icing sugar.

6
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:17,565
And you want to add this really gradually-- because you do not want this

7
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:21,100
to have a doughy texture, you really want this to be  a slime. And I did add this when it was hot,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,235
but before going in and touching it with your

9
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,905
hands,  you need to leave it for at least an hour to cool down,

10
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:28,905
because sugar can stick to your hands and really burn you, so

11
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,655
I do recommend getting a parent to help you out with this.

12
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:34,655
And when it has cooled down like this, it may be a bit hard, so you may want

13
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:37,725
want to add some oil or some water just to loosen the mixture up,

14
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:40,625
but you just want to keep adding some icing sugar until it isn't

15
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,925
sticky anymore, and it makes a really nice, stretchy slime.

16
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:47,885
The next recipe isn't the best tasting one, but it's so cool

17
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:50,295
to play with, and it definitely is edible. So we're

18
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:53,695
going to need some cornflour or cornstarch if you live in America, and

19
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:56,635
I like to add some food colouring in this just so it's completely

20
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:59,905
edible, if you don't want to eat this then you can go ahead and add some paint,

21
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:03,055
and all you want to do is pour half a bowl of water over this, and

22
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,165
bear in mind I'm making a giant one this is literally

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,285
going to be 3 liters worth of this slime.  And you want to stir it

24
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:10,825
all in, and the first batch of cornstarch is normally

25
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:13,955
quite easy to stir in, because it just dissolves, but the more cornstarch

26
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:17,225
you add, the more thick the mixture will become. It will become a lot harder.

27
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:20,475
So what I recommend doing is just pushing the cornstarch under,

28
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:23,475
and then at a later stage is going in with your hands and breaking up all of

29
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:26,075
the lumps, but you just want to keep getting the cornstarch under

30
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,985
and trying to stir it in. After adding in the second

31
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,565
batch, I do recommend just taking it a bit slower, 'cause

32
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:34,325
otherwise the mixture can get really thick like this, 'cause I added

33
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:37,375
a bit too much cornstarch, and I needed to go in and start over

34
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,275
and add some more water. I needed to go in and break it up with

35
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,145
emy hand which became quite messy, but again

36
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,035
this just helps the texture get a bit better, and you just want to keep

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,795
adding cornstarch  again until it becomes thick. And

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,745
as you can see there, it became a bit too thin, so I added a tiny bit

39
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,820
more, and as you can see it's made all of the difference, the tiniest

40
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:57,845
bit makes it super thick, so do not rush this method, and you're

41
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:00,885
'gonna be left with a really cool slime, and I don't recommend

42
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:03,975
eating lots of this, normally it's used to thicken up gravy, but you

43
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:07,065
can have like a teaspoon worth, I just wouldn't recommend a whole bowl.

44
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:08,065
 

45
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:11,675
Last but not least we have a slime that really surprised me, and was

46
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,955
so stretchy, even when it cooled down, and this is made out of Haribo

47
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,695
gummy bears, and I just added the whole pack of this, and this really didn't

48
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:20,395
take a long time to melt, I think it was about 10-15

49
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,325
seconds in the microwave on top heat. The mixture was so sticky

50
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,415
so I went ahead and added a whole tablespoon of icing sugar

51
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:29,135
to start off with, and the mixture kind of looked like caramel, it was

52
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:32,325
so sticky, and it was just such a nice texture, and it wasn't

53
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,975
an ugly colour either which I was really surprised with because all of

54
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:37,445
colours were mixed together. So I just kept adding

55
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:40,635
my icing sugar really gradually, and eventually it was losing it's stick,

56
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:43,495
a bit. I was really worried that when I started playing with it, it would become like a

57
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,435
dough, so I started adding it gradually with my hands and playing with it, and it

58
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:49,875
became such a nice texture, and was so, so strechy.

59
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:53,075
I really hope that you enjoyed this video, and if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs-up,

60
00:02:53,075 --> 00:00:00,000
and I'll see you next week. ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜ {Subtitles by Anna Hubbard}
