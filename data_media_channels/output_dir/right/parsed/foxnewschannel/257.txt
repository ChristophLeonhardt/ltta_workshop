MODEST CRITICISM FROM SOME OF
HER DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS.
>> Martha: THE KIND OF
BEHAVIOR THAT YOU WERE JUST
DISCUSSING IS WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT TONIGHT,
SAYING THAT THAT'S WHY HE HOPES
SOMEBODY IN THE NEXT ELECTION
RUNS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.
>> I DO HOPE THAT SOMEBODY DOES
RUN IN THE PRIMARY AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT.
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO
BE REMINDED ON WHAT CONSERVATISM
IT REALLY IS.
AND, WHAT IT MEANS TO BE DECENT.
WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT KIND OF
POLITICS LATELY.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, AND IT DO
YOU THINK IS RIGHT?
>> JEFF FLAKE IS A FAILED
POLITICIAN, HE HAS 18% APPROVAL
RATING IN HIS HOME STATE LAST I
CHECKED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS
TALKING ABOUT, LIKE 92% OF
REPUBLICANS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF
THE PRESIDENT.
SO JEFF FLAKE IS LIKE THE
STANDARD BEARER FOR
CONSERVATIVISM, AND DONALD TRUMP
ISN'T.
THAT MEANS THE WHOLE PARTY IS A
FRAUD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSTITUENCY
HE THINKS HE REPRESENTS BUT I
WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE PLAN FOR A
GDP RATE HIGHER THAN 4%, SOMEONE
WHO COULD HAVE FIGURED OUT NAFTA
FASTER OR PUT CHINA BACK ON
THEIR HEELS FASTER BUT I THINK
JEFF FLAKE LOOKS TO JOIN AN
INVESTMENT BANK OR SOMETHING AND
MAYBE THAT WILL BE MORE POPULAR
THERE.
HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A FUTURE
AS A POLITICAL PUNDIT.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT NUMBERS
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGOT ABOUT
THAT AND ALL OF HIS SPEAKING
OUT.
>> MARTHA, YOU ARE BEING NICE.
HE HATES TRUMP.
OKAY?
>> Martha: ABSOLUTELY.
>> HE DESPISES DONALD TRUMP SO
JEFF FLAKE WANT SOMEONE TO RUN
