on the brink of a global trade war u.s. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are met with rhetoric and retaliation from America's close allies Canada Mexico are imposing their own the EU is also taking action they say Donald Trump's move is illegal and acceptable is this the beginning of the end of the global trade order this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I am Hoshi mahabhava a black hour for transatlantic relations a bad day for world trade politicians and business leaders react angry to president Trump's decision to impose Tinian tariffs on imports the European Union has vowed to take action against the United States at the World Trade Organization and Canada and Mexico two of the biggest sources of aluminum and steel for the u.s. we now impose their own charges on US goods we find ourselves the target of punitive tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel under pretext of a 2/3 to national security provision let me be clear these tariffs are totally unacceptable if players in the world do not stick to the rulebook the system might collapse and that is why we are challenging today both the US and China at the WTO and it demonstrates that we are not choosing any sides we stand for the multilateral system for a rule-based global trade la posici√≥n de mexico in materia commerciale Mexico's position on trade or immigration or security or whatever area of cooperation with the United States will not vary not because of offensive rhetoric or unjustified unilateral measures like this type we will continue to defend the interests of Mexico just as we have done until now so what are these tariffs and what do they mean for the nations involved the US has imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum imports from Canada Mexico and EU it means American companies we now have to pay more if they buy those goods the most affected is northern neighbor Canada the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the US it is heading back with duties that will impact twelve point eight billion dollars in American imports Mexico's responded with new charges on US farm and industrial projects and the EU is proposing to tax 3.4 billion dollars worth of US exports including signature products like harley-davidson motorcycles and boo-boom whiskey let's introduce our guests joining us in London filly program former adviser to the director-general of the World Trade Organization in Philadelphia Joe Watkins a Republican strategist and former White House aide to President George HW Bush and in Lancaster UK Mauricio Sun Rd international economist at the Lancaster University thank you for joining us Philip what is Trump trying to do here is he defending US interests what is he trying to change a world order that has prevailed for many years well obviously he's trying to curry favor with the Trump voters at the same time I think he's itching for a fight this he is taking incendiary measures against a close US allies on the bogus pretenses that their imports threaten American national security and he's doing this in a week where he's reignited the trade war with China and where he's also recently launched an investigation into car imports also on the bogus grounds of national security which could lead to an even larger ask escalation of hostilities this is not in the interests of the US economy it's not in the interests of US jobs I think he's itching for a fight and I think the consequences are going to be very damaging Joe tying the measures with national security doesn't seem really to impress many people in the international community well it doesn't impress a lot of Republicans either there are many Republican members of the House and the Senate who were not at all pleased with the president's decision to impose these tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and they think that in the long term could hurt the US economy but the president is a very independent independent minded president and he's also a very counterintuitive president he's not in the mold of other Republican presidents who might have a set philosophy but he is very very much very different so this could be a plea an effort on his part to to spur further negotiations when the negotiations that might work in his favor as he sees it which to him would be keeping campaign promise that he made when he was running for the presidency back in 2016 where he said that he felt that the US had had not benefited from past trade agreements that he would do all that he could to change that so I think he sees himself as making good at his campaign promise that that by even not listening to some of his advisors and imposing these tariffs that at the very least he'll send a message and likewise open the door to further negotiation okay open the door for further negotiations Mauricio it seems that he that Trump is opening the door for further compromise in the near future does it mean that he's just using this as a pretext to seek further leverage like when it comes to the NAFTA or when it comes to negotiating deals with the EU well that could be an objective on the other hand I think that the line that he's pursuing is very dangerous because it's making enemies are quite quickly one thing is to try to use something as a leverage for gaining something but a slapping these very high tariffs on Canada and Mexico while the NAFTA negotiations are moving on although maybe not as fast as they would like I'm not sure is the best strategy to get something at the bargaining table likewise with the European Union now also because this back and forth if we think of the recent case of China also provides a doubts uncertainty in the mind of policymakers all over around the world over how much the word of President Trump and his representative can be counted on if they in the case of China and people are changing their mind on a weekly daily basis and when I mean people I mean that they negotiate or the President himself mm-hmm Philip well it seems that we're moving into an uncharted territory and the question that I would like to ask you now is whether the the near-term costs of the of the steel now are going to be manageable by the Americans and by the international community Pauline you know the costs of the sanctions applied so far is are relatively limited you know steel and aluminum exports are not huge at the United States so the direct impact is relatively small the worry is first of all that it's leading immediately to retaliation understandably from Canada Mexico and soon the EU and the fact that Donald Trump seems eager to up the ante by broadening the conflict to cars and as the previous guests just said you know there's not much incentive in the best of times to make concessions to the United States at the barrel of a gun even less so with a president who's likely to go back on his word and one who in any case even if you make concessions now is threatening to hammer your car exports in future which makes me think that this is going to you know escalate rather rapidly and that the consequences are going to be severe mm-hmm Joe US Commerce Secretary Weber was said that we're talking about just a fraction one percent which he is going to be affected in a global market of 16 trillion dollars but then if that's the rationale why would you push for those restrictions if he's just about a tiny fraction of the economy well the administration is still at odds even with most of the Republican delegation in the House and the Senate Paul Ryan the the House Speaker even spoke against these tariffs and said that he thought that it would hurt American jobs yeah the Commerce Secretary mr. Ross may be correct in saying that you know the percentage that might be affected is very very small but at the end of the day American lawmakers that is members of the House and the Senate they're I really want to do anything at all to jeopardize American jobs and American jobs they feel will be jeopardized not only in in in in in in the obvious areas but but throughout the the US economy right now the u.s. is experiencing what is arguably the lowest rate of unemployment that it's seen in years at three point nine percent and Republican lawmakers don't want to see anything to change that it wouldn't happen overnight but nonetheless they feel that that that these these tariffs could to have a very punitive effect on the employment market the labor market in the US Moishe this is someone president Trump who has expressed in the past his disregard disrespect for the international economic and political order saying that his the moment he comes to president he he's going to change many things now the question that I'd like to ask you is if someone who is trying to inject a protectionist dose into the u.s. political agenda or do you think that what we are seeing is more of an erratic improvised policy that could create further shocks in the international global markets I think there is a little bit of both on the one end is if we think of the rule-based system as enshrined in the World Trade Organization what President Trump is doing is using the excuse of national security in order to impose a tease that protectionist measures now it is difficult to think of national security when the United States is targeting countries like Canada and Mexico and the European Union which in a sense of one could say well that's just the legal excuse that he can make use of in order to impose a protectionist measures but at the same time that is going to create a conflict with the rule-based system that has worked quite well in the last half-century and more so the question to me is what will be the reaction of the other politicians and then in the context of the multilateral organizations and that I think is a big challenge because on the one hand that may put a bigger threat and for the WTO for the World Trade Organization at the same time the European Union and other countries bring in the case to the WTO may give and back to the WTO to make sure that it is erratic behavior is a put into prosper into context and then is a stopped before it leads to further damages mm-hmm Philip why would someone wage a war against major players key allies unless he has a political message to send well I mean he's been very clear indeed for decades that he thinks that America is hard done by that the system is unfair to the fact that the United States runs large trade deficits is because other countries are cheating and that it needs to throw its weight around bilaterally in order to get better deals from its former partners and that I think I agree again with the with the previous speaker I think partly Donald Trump is an instinctual a protectionist and in part he thinks that by acting out like this he's going to be able to use in the might of the United States to lever concessions out of its allies I think for the WTO this is a very dangerous moment because the case is being referred to the WTO the it's and it's really a lose-lose situation it will be loathe to rule against the United States on its perceived national security grounds but if it fails to rule against the United States then that opens the door for other countries to follow suit and to act protectionist in protectionist ways even for bogus reasons if on the other hand the Derby Gio does a rule against the the US then Trump may follow through with his threat to pull out of the WTO in which case he really has blown a hole in the multilateral trading system and it will be hard to see well it would it would it would be a very different system without the United States Joey said that many Republicans have expressed concerns about their measures taken by Trump and that we've seen also unions expressing concern where does this new move leave US consumers and US companies well of course there's still a lot of the companies and consumers that have the same worry that the men have they don't know exactly what the impact will be and they're fearing that it'll have a negative impact obviously but president Trump is counting on the fact that he's been very independent-minded and counterintuitive in the past and when nobody has seen or understood what he's been doing is somehow or another managed to work he would probably point to the fact that he certainly nobody thought that the tweets that he that he sent out against the North Korean leader would would bring the North Korean leader to the table for discussions with both South Korea and the United States and so he says you know maybe what I'm doing is the right thing to do I know nobody else understands that nobody may agree with me it's certainly not the normal way that we do business normally US presidents by now who have named ambassadors to major countries and to the EU normally US presidents don't replace their secretaries of state and and and various other lead agencies like the CIA within within a period of a year or two years he's been very very different in that regard he's done all these things that are counterintuitive and and yet and still he manages to to come out ahead so he's thinking the same thing on this with regards to the opposing these trade tabs whether or not it's going to work with with the WTO and with our trading partners is yet to be seen but he believes that it will mm-hmm and he's willing to stand alone if he has to to make that point mauricio secretary was said that there are many steel companies which are now either reopening or expanding is it easy to see it from that perspective or do you think that the tit-for-tat could further create more problem for the American companies and the American consumers even in the near term I think about the problems are much bigger than the share of trade that is actually targeted by these tariffs and for two important reasons one because of the general uncertainty and erratic potentially erratic behavior that the trump administration is signaling and the other aspect is the global value chains I mean we are in India where made in that doesn't mean much anymore because a product are assembled in various countries using intermediate inputs from all sorts of countries and that's why then even if the nominal value attached to the protectionist measures is more is going to disrupt all these international chain of productions and therefore the incentives and motivations that firms multinational firms ever to locate in a country or another therefore the effect of even the smallest italics can be magnified as several times and at the end of the day the effect may be very large for companies and also for consumers I was reading this morning some analysis that say that for each job as saved in the steel industry in the United States that there may be seven jobs elsewhere in the economy that are affected so then at the end of the day economically and politically the question is is that a price that the US administration that the u.s. voters about companies and people at the end they are willing to pay to save someone's job versus are using someone else's job mm-hmm Philip do you think this is something which is going to stop here Seymour compromise in the near future or do you think it might go further if the international community insist on tit-for-tat well I mean Trump's behavior himself is is always erratic you know one minute he's threatening in the next minute he's compromising he'd almost shut down a Chinese mobile phone company called a ZTE and then he decided actually against the law I'll give it a reprieve one minute there's a trade war with China the next minute he's best friends with President Xi and you know when these tariffs were initially threatened we saw them suspended quite quickly so with Trump you know what his erratic behavior it's hard to it's hard to say what his next move will be and no doubt he thinks from his past as a property developer that this kind of unsettling erratic behavior puts his opponents on the backfoot and is actually beneficial III don't think that's the case I think precisely because he keeps making threats that there is no entry from other sides to compromise because any concession that you might be willing to make to avert a future trade war actually he might pocket that concession and then reawaken the threat of a trade war days or weeks later it seems to me therefore that even though on the European side there might be a willingness to compromise if Trump was more conciliatory if he keeps raising the stakes and threatening more Europeans and indeed Canadians and Mexicans I have to respond Joe this is not an unprecedented move I mean Republican predecessors like george w bush imposed tariffs which many believe cost the more than 200,000 jobs in the US and now there are reports suggesting that the new tariffs could cost Trump heavily particularly in states where he got most of the votes is this something to be a similar scenario now well that could be the case and that's what many legislators are cautioning the president and the administration they're saying mr. president you must want to be careful of the repercussions of this this action it's very possible that American jobs across the board could be affected and and and that would of course impact the rate of unemployment he's been able to say that so far under his watch that the rate of unemployment has continued to decrease if the rate of unemployment suddenly starts to increase under his watch because of these these these these tariffs that he's imposed that of course would would would be something he'd have to pay for in a twenty20 re-election bid but I think the president is taking the gamble that that this is the the best course of action right now the world knows that that he has the capacity that changed his mind in an instant to change direction in an instant he he's the same president who said some months ago that the NATO was obsolete and then and then reversed that that that pronouncement so again he might reverse himself on these these tasks that have been imposed but I'm guessing that he wants to bring his neighboring countries these neighboring countries are certainly Canada and Mexico and also the EU with whom the US has had a friendly and partnership relationship back to the table and it many legislators are not thinking that it's going to be so easy but I think the president is convinced that this is the best way to go and he also sends a message as well to his support based okay Mauricio I mean this is the decision that has left many puzzling as trying very trying to connect the dots was China in any way or another a factor in this decision I mean was he basically trying to tackle the the issue of the oversupply of steel in the global market well China is clearly a major player and it's interesting that I think that we will all agree that the current overcapacity and overproduction of steel and aluminum is mainly down to the production capacity of China at the same time the measures that were announced already back in March on steel and aluminum affected China very little why because a Chinese exports to the United States are already subject to many extra duties compared to other countries in particular lanthanum B annuities that make that most of the imports of steel and aluminium do not come from China and that's why then in a sense is paradoxically to invoke a national security against that the closest political economical eyes when the problem would the lie lies mostly with China and this paradox may also I want to be optimistic clay in the favor of the multilateral trade system in the sense that I agree with the previous comments that any trade dispute or WTO may be challenging independent if it is ruled in favor or against the United States but if the security is excuse was invoked against the China possibly there would be more grounds to say well maybe there is a security issue but when the national security argument is invoked against a European Union or Canada Mexico I think that it would be easier politically and legally to dismiss it that is really a national security now then the question is how will the president Trump react and that we don't know I definitely do not know and but what is important it's a very good example that Canada makes the United States and all the other countries Australia are using the rule-based system of the WTO to try to counter in attack what the US administration is doing in a sense paradoxically we know that China is the big problem leaving the bite by way of the by way of the way that is done on the side may actually help the situation other it is paradoxically if you think in terms of its economic implication I have one last question and I would really appreciate if you could each of you answer me in less than 15 seconds do you think that this could upset the global financial order are we into a new unchartered territory Phillip first I think his Trump is destroying the global geopolitical order pulling out of the Paris climate change deal pulling out of the Iran a nuclear deal starting a trade war with his closest allies being disdainful of of them I think that he's trying to destroy the old world order and create a new one where America first is actually America alone Joe it's very possible that this move could at least cause a reset though I don't think it'll destroy it but I think it caused it to be reset so we'll have to all stay tuned Mauricio I think that transactions are posing a threat to the global order be it on the financial terms at trade terms of political terms environmental issues and that may create a bigger effect because each of these dimensions magnify each other I really appreciate thank you very much
