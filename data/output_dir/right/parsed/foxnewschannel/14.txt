>> THE LANGUAGE OF MORAL
CONDEMNATION AND DISTRACTIVE
ROUTINE, THESE ARE ARGUMENTS AND
DISAGREEMENTS THAT HAVE TO STOP
IT.
NO ONE SHOULD CARELESSLY COMPARE
POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO
HISTORICAL VILLAINS.
WHICH IS DONE OFTEN, IT IS DONE
ALL THE TIME.
IT'S GOT TO STOP.
>> Sandra: THAT WAS
PRESIDENT TRUMP LAST NIGHT.
LET'S GET TO HER HOUSE LATER
THIS MORNING, ANTHONY SCARAMUCC
SCARAMUCCI.
FORMER WHAT HAS COMMUNICATION
DIRECTOR, AND AUTHOR OF A
BRAND-NEW BOOK, RIGHT AWAY.
YOU SPEND A LOT OF YOUR TIME
TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND
WHERE HE IS COMING FROM ON
ISSUES.
WHERE IS HE COMING FROM ON THIS
PARTICULAR ISSUE?
>> I THINK HE WAS GREAT LAST
NIGHT.
HE IS SENDING THE RIGHT MESSAGE.
IT IS A MORE TEMPERATE MESSAGE.
TRYING TO DE-ESCALATE THE
TENSION THAT IS OUT THERE.
YOU DON'T WANT THE ROUGHNESS OF
THE RHETORIC TURNING INTO
VIOLENCE.
HE IS THE LEADER OF THE FREE
WORLD.
A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIM.
AWFULLY HE WILL DIAL DOWN AND TO
DE-ESCALATE.
>> Sandra: IS HE RESPONSIBLE?
>> I THINK WE ALL ARE.
ELEMENTS OF THE MEDIA THAT FIRES
PEOPLE UP, DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS, AND CERTAINLY THE
PRESIDENT HAS HIS MOMENTS WHERE
HE HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH
HIS RHETORIC.
KNOWING HIM AS WELL AS I FEEL I
KNOW HIM, IT IS USUALLY WHEN
SOMEONE IS COMING AFTER HIM.
I HAVE NEVER REALLY SEEN HIM GET
UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY OKAY,
I AM GOING TO START A VICIOUS
ATTACK OF A, B, AND C.
USUALLY SOMEONE IS FIRING A
MISSILE INTO HIM.
>> Bill: I'M GOING TO PUT TWO
THINGS ON THE SCREEN.
JUST REACT TO IT.
JEFF STUCKER OF CNN.
"THERE WAS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN THE
WHITE HOUSE OF THE CONTINUED
ATTACKS ON THE MEDIA.
THE PRESIDENT AND ESPECIALLY THE
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR
WORDS MATTER.
THUS FAR, THEY HAVE SHOWN NO
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT.
SARAH SANDERS HAD A VERY STRONG
REACTION TO THIS.
DONALD TRUMP ASKED AMERICANS TO
COME TOGETHER IN A VERY CLEAR,
STRONG, AND UNMISTAKABLE STANCE.
DO YOU CHOOSE TO ATTACK AND
DIVIDE.
SHOULD DIVIDE AGAINST ALL
POLITICAL VIOLENCE.
THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE NOT GOING
TO COME TOGETHER.
>> THERE WAS A WAR DECLARATION.
THOSE TWO SIDES ARE AT WAR.
THE PRESIDENT FEELS JUSTIFIED
BECAUSE HE WILL LOOK AT THE
HARVARD STUDY.
92% OF THE MEDIA IS DECIDEDLY
BIASED.
THAT IS A HARVARD STUDY.
THAT IS NOT SO REPUBLICAN SAYING
IT.
SO JUSTIFIABLY, PEOPLE LIKE
SARAH SANDERS FEEL THAT THEY
DON'T GET A FAIR SHAKE.
I AM A LITTLE SORE.
HE DOES INTENTIONALLY LIE TO
CREATE A DOG WHISTLE AND THIS
ATMOSPHERE SO THAT YOU RAISE THE
VOLUME ON HIM LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL
PROCTOR.
SO THEY GO OUT AND PUT OUT A
TAGLINE.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI CALLS THE
PRESIDENT A LIAR.
THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.
WHEN WE GET UPSET WITH EACH
OTHER, I HAD TO CALL MY WIFE
DOWN LAST NIGHT BECAUSE SHE
WATCHED A VIDEO OF ME ON THEIR
SHOW FOUR TIMES.
I DID NOT SAY THAT HE WAS A
LIAR.
I SAID THAT HE IS USING A
METHODOLOGY OF THE MINISTRIES TO
CREATE THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY.
HE IS TRYING TO GALVANIZE HIS
BASE.
IT IS A MEDIA DEVICE.
IF YOU READ HIS BOOKS, I READ
EVERY SINGLE ONE.
ONE OF HIS STRATEGIES IS TO GET
THE VOLUME UP ON THE MEDIA.
HE HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB IN
THE CAMPAIGN AND IN THE
PRESIDENCY.
>> Bill: BUT WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT NOT FIRING THE FIRST SHOT,
WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW, IS THE
WEST WING ON OFFENSE BASED ON
THE CRITICISM THAT HAS COME FROM
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER
AND JOHN BRENNAN?
>> LISTEN, I THINK EVERYBODY
WOULD BE WELL SERVED IF THERE
WAS ANOTHER PIECE MEETING.
I THINK YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS
GOING BACK INTO THE TRANSITION.
OF COURSE IN DECEMBER.
A LOT OF THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVES
IN THE AREA DESCENDING ON
TRUMP TOWER.
HAD A BIG MEETING TO SEE IF WE
COULD WORK ON A PATTERN OF
DE-ESCALATION.
IT DIDN'T WORK.
BUT NOW WE ARE HERE AT THE
BORDERLINE OF VIOLENCE.
MAYBE IT IS TIME TO REVISIT THAT
IN THE WEST WING.
A GROUP OF MEDIA EXECUTIVES GET
DOWN THERE TO THE PRESIDENT.
THEY HAVE AN AIRING OUT OF THE
ISSUES.
CLEARLY, REMEMBER WHAT THE
PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT THE
KHASHOGGI SITUATION.
HE SAID TO LESLIE STAHL, THE
FACT THAT THIS PERSON IS A
JOURNALIST, IT MAKES ME EVEN
MORE UPSET.
THAT IS TELLING YOU THAT HE
BELIEVES IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT,
HE WANTS THERE TO BE A RIGOROUS
DEBATE WITH THE PRESS.
AND OBVIOUSLY, AT TIMES IT WILL
BE ADVERSARIAL.
IT HAS BEEN FOREVER PRESIDENT OF
EVERY ADMINISTRATION, FRANKLY.
LEFT AND RIGHT.
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DIAL IT
DOWN FROM THE WARTIME SITUATION
THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW.
THOSE TWO STATEMENTS THAT YOU
PUT UP, THAT IS MORE
DECLARATION.
LET'S CEASE FIRE.
>> Sandra: "A VERY GOOD PART
OF THE ANGER THAT WE SEE TODAY
IN OUR SOCIETY IS CALLED BY THE
WILL EVOLVE AND INACCURATE
REPORTING OF THE MEDIA.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA MUST CLEAN
UP ITS ACT FAST.
WE ARE NOW 12 DAYS OUT FROM
MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
WHERE DO THINGS STAND?
>> IT IS A LOT HIGHER THAN
PEOPLE THINK.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING DATA,
SOME OF THE POLLING DATA THAT WE
ARE LOOKING AT YESTERDAY, I LOOK
AT CERTAIN POLLS THAT WERE VERY
PREDICTABLE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT
SUCCESS, DESPITE PEOPLE LIKE
NATE SILVER SAME DIFFERENTLY.
86%.
SAID THAT THE SECRETARY CLINTON
WAS GOING TO WIN BY 86%.
LITERALLY TWO YEARS EARLIER.
BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS BOMB
SCARE, THAT THE PERPETRATION OF
THE BOMB SCARE HAS GOT SOME OF
THAT MOMENTUM, SOME OF MY
GALVANIZING MOMENT WAS TAKING
PLACE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GET OUT THE
VOTE.
YOU HAVE TO GET THE
PORT-AU-PRINCE PATIENT AFOOT.
HAPPY ABOUT THE ECONOMY, THE
ONES THAT ARE REALLY UPSET WITH
THE PRESIDENT, THEY HAVE A
TENDENCY TO TURN OUT.
THAT IS WHY MOST PRESIDENTS LOSE
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
LOOK, IT IS MORE MOOCH IN ONE
DAY.
>> Bill: I THINK WHAT IS
INTERESTING ABOUT YOUR BOOK, I
WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PITCH
IT.
YOU MADE A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU LOST
TOUCH WITH AMERICA.
NOW, HOW DID YOU FIND A WAY TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING?
WEST OF NEW JERSEY?
>> YES, MY DAD WAS A BLUE-COLLAR
WORKER.
PUT HIS LUNCH PALED TOGETHER.
WE HAD A NICE MIDDLE CLASS
UPBRINGING.
THEN I STARTED TALKING TO MY
PEER GROUP.
I STARTED GETTING ALL OF THOSE
CONFIRMED BIASES OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT AND OF THE ELITE
APPEAR TO JOIN THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN, ENDED UP IN
ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO.
WENT INTO SEE THE PEOPLE THAT
WERE TALKING ABOUT SUPPORTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S, THAT I
REALIZED HE WAS TALKING TO MY
FRIENDS AND MY NEIGHBORS, THE
ONES HE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.
MY COUSIN BOBBY, WHO IS IN THE
AUTO GLASS INDUSTRY.
HE WAS TALKING TO PEOPLE THAT I
GREW UP WITH, AND TO THOSE
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.
THEY FEEL THAT THERE HAS NOT
BEEN A VOICE OF ADVOCACY FROM
THE OVAL OFFICE IN THE LAST
30-35 YEARS.
AND IF THEY LIKE HIM.
SO IF HE SAYS SOMETHING THAT
MAYBE NEEDS TO BE FACT-CHECKED,
THEY ACTUALLY DON'T CARE.
THEY ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE
POLICIES.
THE NUANCES OF HIS PERSONALITY,
SO I TRIED TO PUT THAT IN THE
BOOK.
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE
PRESIDENTS DATA DATA AND THE
PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS A YOUNGER
MAN.
PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE TRUMP
APARTMENTS.
THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT THE
25-YEAR-OLD TRUMP IN THE DJT CAR
WITH HIS LICENSE PLATE.
GOING OVER TO YOU COLLECT COINS
OF THE LAUNDRY FACILITY.
COLLECTING COINS OUT OF THE
VENDING MACHINE.
AND ALSO LETTING PEOPLE SLIDE
ONCE IN A WHILE ON RENT WHEN
THEY WERE HAVING TOUGH TIMES IN
THEIR LIVES.
SO THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT ALL OF
THAT, ALL OF THAT BLUE-COLLAR
INTERACTION, ALL OF THAT
BLUE-COLLAR INTERACTION WITH
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INTO THE
GAME OF POLITICS.
HERE'S WHAT HE DID, GUYS.
HE TOOK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
MANTLE OF LEADERSHIP WITH THE
NOMINATION, AND THEN HE STOLE A
BASE OF THE OTHER PARTY.
HE BROUGHT IT OVER TO THE
REPUBLICANS.
WHILE THEY WERE FOCUSED ON
SOCIAL ISSUES AND POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS --
>> Bill: ECONOMIC DESPERATION.
>> EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A GOLDEN
TOILET SEAT, THE BLUE-COLLAR
PEOPLE LOVE HIM.
