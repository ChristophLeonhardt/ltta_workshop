you know the really fascinating thing I've discovered about the left is that they'll suppress speech involving political opinions they don't like but when it comes to threatening or inciting violence they'll use speech very liberally both in the free sense and the political one case in point Florida State University student Reem zeitoun who tweeted announcer at national students for justice in Palestine there's police here for our safety because there are people who are upset and angry that we are here me I'll f up a Zionist let's take a look that Florida State students for justice in Palestine member didn't back down when pro-israel watchdog canary mission called her out on Twitter yes I did I definite in 16 and we're still doing it in 2018 thanks for the free promo well consider this another free promo Zeitoun zeitoun that's very close to cartoon and she is almost a parody of a leftist activist sporting a palestinian cape and fighting the Nazis which of course is anyone in every one except those on the Left who actually do hate Jews and Israelis and lest you think Zeitoun is one of those moderate Palestinians he or she says Zionists can kick and scream for a two-state but it will never happen we will achieve liberation within our lifetime and it will be a single state called Palestine whether they like it or not and of course don't think she'll just focus her zaniness on the east and leave the West alone oh no she says we will see a unified Korea and a free Palestine inshallah as soon as we dismantle the United States happy Valentine's Day death to the United States long live the DPRK hmm I wonder if she'd be able to make such a remark about her country if she actually lived in North Korea I wonder if she'd even be allowed to use the internet but it's funny because zeitoun is so progressive that she hates the same people conservatives and libertarians hate on the anniversary of the Columbine massacre she said brace yourselves Parkland five about to pump out a slew of progressive tweets about how they're the change they want to see in the world as we remember a Columbine david hog sitting in his bedroom thinking he's actually politically intelligent and not like every other white guy because white men of course are a homogenous group that derived their politics from having the same genitalia in the same low melanin levels don't pay attention at all to actual numbers and facts showing that many of them did vote for Hillary it's all just fake news well this was conducted by CNN so it might actually be fake news but you get the point as for Florida State's SJP chapter they issued a statement which zeitoun shared saying that many of the tweets canary mission refers to are legitimate criticisms of Israeli governmental policies and practices but a few tweets and posts that we are referring to you are undeniably racist and anti-semitic and that people who made such posts are no longer members of our organization nor are they students at FSU the group also apologized separately for the FFA Zionist tweet made by Zeitoun who is a current FSU student and SJP member but that doesn't answer the bigger question which is why do these remarks come so unilaterally from only one side of the israel-palestine conflict for campus unmasked i'm rob strim shocked if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
