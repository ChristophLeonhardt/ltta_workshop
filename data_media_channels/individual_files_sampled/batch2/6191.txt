Fox & Friends knows that Donald Trump watches they like that fact and so everyone said why they like to Pat Donald on the head be like oh my god you're so right so the latest example of that is they had one of the Republican congressman who wants to end the funding for the Special Counsel investigation into Donald Trump and his team they had him on the show and they all had a big circle something or other where they were like oh yeah address we go Donald it's got to stop yeah we're with you mr. Trump it's got to stop so they have represented Rhonda Santos on he's the one that proposed to stop it in the first place and Brian Kilmeade is very excited about this let's watch he's proposing legislation to kill the special counsel Robert Moses probe is that the presidentials ties to Russia six months after it passes it seems reasonable congressman six months is enough plus you had James Comey into investigating prior to this where's this where's this proposal going well Brian what we want to do is say very clearly we don't want to fund fishing expeditions Oh unless they're about Benghazi or whitewater all right I'm gonna get to that in a second don't miss those facts but right now it's a six foot come on I mean we've been looking into this for a whole six months I don't you like I said I'm gonna tell you how long whitewater I'm Benghazi lasted okay let's keep going though my amendment basically says look this thing needs to be limited to the campaign and Russia and it needs to have an end date if you haven't produced evidence of a crime after almost two years of investigating because Comey investigated for a year before Muller was appointed then at some point we have to move on with the American people's business at some point we've gotta move on alright I can't help you don't have any committee hearings they had on Benghazi 33 I mean at some point we gotta move on every one of the committee's that looked into it was led by Republicans they all concluded there was nothing illegal and and and nothing to charge anyone on and they couldn't find wrongdoing but at some point we've got to move on you know I mean we've had a couple of seconds here and but they're in the middle of the investigation they are in the middle of a grand jury and just to wrap up the grand jury come on what are you trying to hide if you don't have anything to hide why why are usually gonna panic to move on while there's a grand jury listening to evidence more does it concern you what you've known so far the fact that they raid Paul mana Ford's house they're looking at international context does it bother you that Robert Moore reportedly conferring with the archenemy of President Trump the Attorney General Schneiderman who's they've been going at each other for years now they're conferring directly does that bother you or encourage you that they're trying to get to the end of this it concerns me because a lot of the mana port stuff happened way before the campaign maybe he did stuff to three years ago but that's not really you don't need a special counsel for that so let's get this right he says they should be limited only campaign not anything that happened before the campaign not anything that happened after the campaign no I want to really really live it a man at Ford who was this campaign manager maybe he committed crimes with the Russians but don't look at doing don't look at do it how about Trump's financial dealings no no circumstances what are you in a panic for so the guy says he's got ten billion dollars and then and then everything is on the up and up and he's such a great businessman you should want them to look into it in an app I'm sure Robert Muller will come out and go my god what a successful business executive this guy is there's nothing untoward at all no no no you're afraid of what they're gonna find of course and and by the way shinai Durbin being involved is very important why he's the New York State Attorney General Donald Trump as president can issue federal pardons so if they turns out his son Donald Trump jr. Kushner or Manta fort were all in one of the Russian meetings where by the way there's a new story out today they say man afford in one of his texts talked about donations and next to the RNC when they were in a conversation a sentence with the RNC when they were in with the Russians so I don't know if and now of course it's just a leak for now that's why I let them finish the investigation you don't know what's gonna happen I don't know the secret evidence that they have or that they're sharing with a grand jury and neither do you you don't know if it exonerates him or says that he he's culpable so but it's interesting that now they're talking about it made possible Russian donations by the way yes that would be a crime it is illegal for foreigners to give money to politicians especially running for president so let's see how it turns out they don't want it to but what they can't do what Trump can't do its pardon someone if they are charged with a state crime so if mana fort for example broke state laws in New York and now they're investigating his money laundering for the Russians well there's no get out of jail free card for that that's why Republican Congress Manik DeSantis and Fox News are in a panic we're gonna wrap this up and go to know dr. Schneider man oh really oh he's his nemesis he's why cuz he investigates him okay last one for you guys here Rosenstein seems to be a gift to Democrats and anti Trump errs they just want to see this president not be successful the way this was written seems criminal well that's the thing Brian what happens I don't think this Russia stuff I've never seen evidence of a crime but I'm not worried about that Jackson special oh they're investigating of the crimes is the crime okay now these guys want to end this in six months let me show you how long whitewater took their investigation started in January of 1994 lasted to September of 2000 not six months six years is and by the way at the end what do they get these guys who are talking about it don't look at Trump's finances don't look at bad afford feet before they can't paid her after the campaign they found out that down low that Bill Clinton had done nothing wrong in whitewater in so having nothing new that land deal in Arkansas they're like oh yeah but he slept with this random woman over here I got you on a completely unrelated thing that had nothing to do with amount of financial malfeasance or anything along those lines and these guys have the nerve to talk about an investigation that's a fishing expedition are you kidding me let's look at Benghazi there's ten different organizations and committees like looking into Benghazi and having investigations to at the bottom or not congressional but eight out of ten were congressional you know that they only did 21 hearings on 9/11 they did 33 hearings on Benghazi unbelievable and how long did it last from September of 2012 to December of 2016 not six months but four years fine you don't want to use the Whitewater example we'll take Benghazi after Robert Robert Muller looks into Trump for four years we'll say okay I guess that was enough I'm just going by the Republican standard that's what the Republicans did on Benghazi so I guess four years is the rule now help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
