and Alize in his Fox interview President Trump also discussed his relationship with Vladimir Putin take a look I'm not for Russia I'm for the United States as an example if Vladimir Putin who was sitting next to me at a table instead of one of the others and we were having dinner the other night in Canada I could say we can't do me a favor we can get out of Syria would you do me a favor will you get out of the Ukraine get out of Ukraine you shouldn't be there just come on I think I'd probably have a good relationship with them or I'd be able to talk to them better than if you call somebody on a telephone until I will tell you as an example a reporter asked me do you think you'd be better off with Russia said absolutely you know we spend probably 25% of our time talking about Russia and I said to myself wouldn't it be better if they were here and a lot of people agree with me despite all of these done to us you think he's gonna I'm not sticking up for anybody I'm just saying this he didn't respect our leadership previously look what he did to Obama with Crimea he took me he took Ukraine he I mean sections of Ukraine which is why I got kicked out that you know I know but he didn't respect our leadership you didn't respect it and so this wasn't me it's really hard to put into words what I just saw and Elise for me as a daughter of a former national security adviser who's probably one of the greatest minds on geopolitical relations around the world and strategy I will tell you that sickens me to hear him speak that way to be so flip to be so pompous to be so arrogant to be so stupid about history so short-sighted and also so unbelievably confident in nothing he has no clue what he's doing and our prayers will rest on the people around him but I think we better get with the program no one can do anything under him that is effective and I'm concerned right now from Mike Pompeo I'm concerned for general mattis and I'm concerned for Republicans in Congress who have the opportunity to straight to right this ship and are not taking it I feel like we're on the edge of a huge crisis mica that exchange was just so utterly ignorant in the content of him of Donald Trump believing that he could just sit down with Vladimir Putin and say get out of Syria and he would do it get out of Crimea and he would do it like why not bring me a unicorn while you're at it that's just not how radomir Putin operates it's not how he's ever operated and if anything Vladimir Putin feels incredibly empowered because he interfered in our election in Donald Trump's own ego it's keeping him from fully admitting it and fully looking into it and making sure that it will never happen again so that is such a fundamental misunderstanding by Donald Trump of Vladimir Putin and his motivations that yes it's truly petrifying it's petrifying it truly is ya know Willy yeah that was I think what we just saw there in the interview was Donald Trump's version of george w bush's i have looked into his soul and I've seen he's a good guy I can deal with him Donald Trump again suggesting that he can deal with him but so interesting is about what he said on the plane it I reflected back to gosh it was such a long time ago this past weekend when Donald Trump I said said that actually that the Crimea invasion made a lot of sense because the people of Crimea wanted the Russians to be there which reminded me of something that I saw last night on Twitter someone had quoted a page from David Halberstam great book the 50s where he was talking about Joe McCarthy and he said there was no plan he was shooting from the hip it was always I mean McCarthy was a day trader like Roy Cohn was a day trader I reviewed Larry Ty's book on RFK for the Washington Post a couple of summers ago the most revealing part was this was during 2016 they contrasted Bobby Kennedy working in in the the Senate as a lawyer versus Roy Cohn Roy Cohn never did research never a the files were left unopened there were never read anything he just went out was a day trader and just made allegations and and as Habersham said in the 50s there was no plan there's no plan here right this guy is a day trader so one day the crimeans want Russia to invade the next day hey I could get them out of Crimea tomorrow it'll be something else which of course this very nature of Donald Trump this reckless undisciplined nature of Donald Trump is what's so dangerous on the foreign policy stage yeah I think if you're gonna have the bumper sticker quote about Donald Trump it also came last week when he said I don't have to prepare it's about attitude when talking about the North Korea summit and that as you say is sort of the roy cohn view of the world which is the power of personality will win out there's he doesn't believe in preparation doesn't believe in history doesn't believe in context he believes his singular personality can get things done that if he gets in the room with somebody like on the apprentice or like he's doing a building deal in New York City he can convince them to come to his side and Joe as you know it's working I know we'll get into this and we're gonna have Mark Sanford on the show in just a few minutes but you had that chairwoman of the Republican Party tweeting yesterday this anyone that does not embrace the Donald Trump agenda of making America great again will be making a mistake that's where the Republican Party is it's a power of personality it's not about ideas it's not about even conservative policy any more ask mark Sanford of the freedom caucus with a 100% ACU rating it's about your loyalty to Donald Trump and Donald Trump knows that and that's why he knows he can go on camera and say the things he said without penalty he does and before we go to break Mike Barnicle wants to share a picture Joe I don't know whether you've seen the front of The Times this morning could we get a look at that's right there close up of this this is a two year old Honduran girl at the border of the United States Mexican border crying as her mother is being triste by an ice agent and we have in this country right now thousands of children who have been orphaned by the actions of the United States government and so we've talked a lot about the country today what it is and what it means what it is meant to the world are and we should ask ourselves is this the United States that you remember is this the United States that you want to be is this the United States you want the world to see and you let me let me add to that that I've talked to a lot of conservatives and I've read what a lot of conservatives have said about our current policy conservatives who like myself are what want a very tight border and are very tight what are very conservative when it comes to immigration we believe that borders mean something we believe that the first thing someone does when they come into our country should not be violating United States laws I'm hardliner on immigration at the same time what's going on right now at the border is unamerican and i will tell you a lot of catholics leaders have come out and said it is UNCHR Iced like yesterday reports coming out that a woman was breastfeeding her daughter and in the middle of it her baby was ripped away from her public defenders in the federal courts down there in McAllen Texas reporting that that children are being told and their parents are being told that they're being taken off to the showers and that they'll return and they never return you know I don't have to compare that to previous regimes in other horrific countries that that conclusion actually is too obvious this is Donald Trump's America and yes it sounds like something we would be condemning coming out of North Korea and if this is his Mitch McConnell says what he considers to be the high-water mark of conservatism in America then Mitch McConnell is a fool Mitch McConnell is an ignorant fool who knows absolutely nothing about conservatism about Edmund Burke about Russell Kirk about Milton Friedman about about William F Buckley and yes about the sainted Ronald Wilson Reagan who Mitch McConnell says was not as conservative as Donald J Trump lifetime Democrat and contributor to the DNC Nancy Pelosi Rahm Emanuel and Chuck Schumer that's our America Mika and sadly that's our Republican Party and that is the problem today it's a big one thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on
