1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,282
DEMOCRAT MEDIA, HE'S FINDING A

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,050
WAY TO GET OUT WHAT HE WANTS TO

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,955
GET OUT AND IT WORKS FOR HIM

4
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:12,355
REALLY WELL.

5
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:13,489
TODD: THOUSAND CAME OUT TO

6
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:14,224
PRAISE HIM FOR GETTING AMERICANS

7
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,492
HOME THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DOES

8
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,661
NOT SEEM TO AGREE.

9
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:26,569
>> SUCCESS IN THE FOREIGN-POLICY

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:27,303
FIELD MIGHT DISTRACT ATTENTION

11
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:28,037
FROM THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

12
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:31,741
>> VERY KEEN TO GET A WIN OUT OF

13
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,040
THIS.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,844
>> COMPLETE INCAPACITY FOR HUMAN

15
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:35,178
EMPATHY.

16
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,248
>> HE KNOWS HOW TO GET

17
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:38,982
PUBLICITY, BLEED A LOT OF DRAMA.

18
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:42,652
IT IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, IT IS

19
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:43,152
ABOUT THE RATINGS.

20
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:43,820
>> WHY WON'T THE MEDIA GIVE

21
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,824
DONALD TRUMP CREDIT?

22
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:48,558
HERE TO WAY AND IS THE PRESIDENT

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:49,158
OF DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP.

24
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:54,864
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

25
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:58,868
THAT WAS SUCH AN AMERICAN

26
00:00:58,868 --> 00:00:59,202
MOMENT.

27
00:00:59,202 --> 00:00:59,902
I THOUGHT, THEY WILL GIVE THE

28
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:00,637
PRESIDENT THE CREDIT IS DUE BUT

29
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,539
NOT SO MUCH.

30
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,706
>> SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BRING

31
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:05,474
ALL AMERICANS TOGETHER WITH YOU

32
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:06,142
ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT

33
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:07,777
REGARDLESS WITH THE WORK IN THE

34
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:13,449
MEDIA OR NOT, BRINGING HOME

35
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,851
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES IS A

36
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,518
HUGE VICTORY, TALKING ABOUT

37
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:16,152
HOSTAGES FROM NORTH KOREA.

38
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:23,626
THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN.

39
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,360
THINK ABOUT THE STATE THAT OTTO

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,798
WARMBIER WAS IN, HORRIFIC

41
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:29,198
CONDITIONS.

42
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:30,867
TO HAVE THIS MOMENT, THE PRES.

43
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:34,437
MEETING WITH THREE INDIVIDUALS

44
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:35,171
WHEN THEY LANDED AT ANDREWS AIR

45
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:39,208
FORCE BASE, A HUGE MOMENT.

46
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:39,876
WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT RUSSIA

47
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:41,911
YESTERDAY, STORMY DANIELS AND

48
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:49,819
THIS SHOULD BRING AMERICANS

49
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,186
TOGETHER.

50
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:50,820
>> A FEW HOURS AFTER THE

51
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,554
HOSTAGES RETURNED WE DEVOTED OUR

52
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:52,288
ENTIRE 60 MINUTES DURING MY TIME

53
00:01:52,288 --> 00:02:02,832
IN THE CHURCH A COVERAGE OF THE

54
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:03,399
NORTH KOREA SITUATION.

55
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:04,334
FLASH FORWARD TO THE EVENING

56
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:08,104
NEWS, NBC, 2 MINUTES AND 20

57
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:08,805
MINUTES AND 5 SECONDS.

58
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:13,810
THAN MSNBC TOTAL PRIMETIME

59
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,412

60
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,513
ON WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST STORY OF

61
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:23,720
THE DAY, TOTAL OF 30 SECONDS.

62
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,090
AT SOME POINT ISN'T THERE SOME

63
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,160
DISINGENUOUSNESS, A MAJOR

64
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,627
AMERICAN STORY.

65
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:35,064
>> NOT JUST THE HOSTAGE RELEASE

66
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:35,798
BUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT NORTH

67
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:38,101
KOREA WILL GET RID OF THEIR

68
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,037
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, IT WILL HAPPEN

69
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:53,683
ON JUNE 12TH, AND THE PRES. KIM

70
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:54,417
JONG UN, THAT CAME OUT AS WELL.

71
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:55,151
THESE ARE MAJOR NEWS STORIES, A

72
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,885
COUNTRY THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IF

73
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:56,619
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO

74
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:56,986
WAR WITH.

75
00:02:56,986 --> 00:03:00,623
FOR THERE TO BE A POTENTIAL FOR

76
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:02,859
A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO NORTH

77
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:03,593
KOREAN WEBKINZ AND THAT IS NOT A

78
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:06,462
MAJOR NEWS STORY IS SHOCKING.

79
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:07,163
I KNOW THERE IS BIAS IN SOME

80
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:07,897
MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS, THEY

81
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,400
DON'T LIKE TRUMP BUT EVEN ON

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,100
THIS STORY IT IS SHOCKING HOW

83
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,801
LITTLE TIME IS DEVOTED TO IT.

84
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,972
HEATHER: AFTER THIS INCIDENT I

85
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:16,639
DON'T SEE ANY SITUATION THE

86
00:03:16,639 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT CAN GET ANY POSITIVE
