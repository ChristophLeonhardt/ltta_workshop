Sandra: GREG PALKOT FROM LONDON. THANK YOU. WE HAVE TO FIRE THAT ON THE BEARING OF ENEMY CONTACTS. SOLUTION READY. SONAR BEARINGS. FIRE. TORPEDO COURSE 219. A LOT OF INTERFERENCE ON THE SURFACE, CAPTAIN. HARD TO FIND IN THE NOISE. Sandra: U.S. VERSES RUSSIA ACTION THRILLER HUNTER KILLER PREMIERS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY ABOUT A SUBMARINE CAPTAIN AND A GROUP OF NAVY SEALS WHO HAVE TO SAVE A KIDNAPPED RUSSIAN PRESIDENT TO STOP WORLD WAR III. THE STAR OF THAT FILM IS JOINING US, GERARD BUTLER AND THE DIRECTOR. I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MANY PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO AND GREENROOM IN A LONG TIME. EVERYBODY IS COMING DOWN TO SAY HELLO. A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU BOTH HERE. WHAT A FILM THIS IS. THIS FULFILLS SORT OF A DREAM OF YOURS TO MAKE A FILM LIKE THIS. SINCE I WAS A KID MY FAVORITE MOVIES WERE ALWAYS SUBMARINE MOVIES. ONE HADN'T BEEN MADE FOR A WHILE. WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE SCRIPT WE WEREN'T INTO THE CLIMATE THAT IT MADE SENSE OR FEEL PLAUSIBLE BECAUSE I HAD IT SINCE 2011. AROUND 2015 WHEN THINGS STARTED GETTING A LITTLE STRANGE WE SAID OKAY, NOW WE HAVE THE MAKINGS OF A MOVIE THAT AN AUDIENCE CAN CONNECT WITH AND THEN YOU GET TELL ALL THE FUN PARTS. Sandra: YOU ARE BEING APPLAUDED FOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE FILM. YOU WERE THE PRODUCER AND STAR OF THIS FILM, GERARD. HOW DID YOU GET THE ACCESS TO REALLY PRODUCE THIS WHAT IS BEING SEEN AS A VERY AUTHENTIC FILM? WE WENT TO THE NAVY AND BASICALLY SHOWED THEM THE SCRIPT AND SAID HERE WE HAVE A MOVIE THAT ALLOWS AN AUDIENCE TO CLAIM INCITE INTO SUBMARINERS AND SEE HOW TALENTED THEY ARE AND THE WARRIORS THEY ARE. FOR THE NAVY IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HELP US. A BEAUTIFUL PARTNERSHIP TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A BIG, EPIC MOVIE THAT AN AUDIENCE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT INCREDIBLE PEOPLE THEY HAVE. Sandra: THAT WAS SOMETHING FOR THEM TO WORK WITH A STAR FOR YOU. WHAT WAS IT LIKE MAKING THIS MOVIE? INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. WE WENT FOR THREE DAYS ON A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE TO GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE. THEY DID ALL THE DRILLS AS IF IT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. WE TOOK ALL THAT AND PUT IT INTO THE FILM. Sandra: ONE THING I HEARD YOU SAY IS THIS MOVIE IS FILLED WITH SURPRISES. PREMIERS FRIDAY. DON'T GIVE ANYTHING AWAY. WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT MAKING THE FILM AND GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS? I THINK IT'S THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WANTED TO BRING THE HEROISM AND SHOW HAVE ACCESS INTO THESE KIND OF DEEP, DARK SPACES, I THINK WHAT REALLY IS SAID WE'RE SURPRISED AND WHAT AMAZING MEN ARE DOWN THERE AND HOW MUCH THEY DRILL AND TRAIN AND HOW COURAGEOUS THEY ARE AND HOW SO MUCH OF THAT IS UNHEARD AND UNSEEN. THEY REALLY ARE THE UNSPOKEN HEROES. WE CAME AWAY TRULY MOVED AND INSPIRED TO DO A GOOD JOB IN THIS MOVIE TO SHINE THE LIGHT ON THEM. Sandra: FASCINATING AND YOU APPEARED AT THE PENTAGON LAST WEEK TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT, A STATEMENT. YOU WERE PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED TO BE THERE BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NAVY BUT YOU ENDED UP MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT YOUR TRAVELS TO SAUDI ARABIA BASED ON THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI. I DIDN'T MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. I WAS ASKED A QUESTION. I WENT ALONG TO VISIT THE NAVY AND IT WAS A TREAT TO US AND ALSO FOR US TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE PARTNERSHIP AND TO TALK TO THE AUDIENCE ABOUT THAT PARTNERSHIP. OF COURSE, WE HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO TRAVEL TO SAUDI ARABIA THE DAY BEFORE THIS NEWS CAME OUT SO WE CANCELED THAT TRIP AND WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY WANT NOT TO BE KNOWN IN THE PRESS BUT IT CAME OUT IN THE PRESS AND THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION I WAS ASKED AT THE PENTAGON. Sandra: YOU WERE SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH THE CROWN PRINCE. I WAS. I DIDN'T THINK ANY OF THE TEAM FELT IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO MAKE THAT VISIT. Sandra: WHAT IS THIS FILM? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE GO OUT AND SEE IT? A LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE HAD AN AMAZING SUBMARINE FILM. THESE THIS IS A BRAND-NEW SUBMARINE IN YOUR NAVY. UNBELIEVABLE EQUIPMENT. WE'LL SHOWCASE THAT AND AN EXCITING STORY. A SEAL STORY LINE. A PENTAGON STORY LINE. A SUB STORY YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND GREAT ACTION AND FUN. I'VE WATCHED IT WITH MANY DIFFERENT AUDIENCES AND HOW THRILLING AND EXHILARATING THE WRITERS AND HOW MOVING IT IS. BECAUSE YOU REALLY GET TO SEE THESE PEOPLE AT WORK AT THEIR BEST AND IT IS THIS SIMMERING VIOLENCE THE WHOLE TIME. GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES. IT IS REALLY A RIDE. Sandra: WE'RE SEEING QUITE A WELCOME. THANK YOU. GETTING THROUGH MANHATTAN IS NOT EASY.
