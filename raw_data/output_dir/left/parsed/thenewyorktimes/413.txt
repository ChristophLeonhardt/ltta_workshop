The Land of Salt and Fire
Dallol, Ethiopia
It is so hot here,
the hottest place on earth.
I come here to push my imagination.
To see something new.
To understand how this place
is possible, I’ll take you to the white.
To the salt.
I’m Andrea Frazzetta, there on the back
of the car, with the camera.
I’m a photographer.
And we are driving across the bottom
of an ancient ocean,
now a thick bed of salt.
It is so hot you can imagine how
10,000 years ago the sun evaporated
the ocean, leaving behind the
vast plain of salt.
Salt that the Afar people
have been mining for centuries.
They shape the salt into those blocks
at your feet to sell at market.
The blocks were once so valuable
they were used as money.
The miners are working now, but the week
before, they had gone on strike
to protest the falling price of salt.
I met a man named Kedir
who cut salt for 46 years.
"The salt is right here on our doorstep.
Our fathers mined salt to raise us
and we do it to raise our children.
In the hot season, we hire help.”
“I think, in the future, the government
will give the work to outside companies,
and that the traditional way we mine salt
with camel caravans will end.”
Roads are being built in this area
of Ethiopia, which brings access,
and new mining techniques. If it’s easier
to move the salt, that means fewer
camel caravans each week.
Across the salt plain, there is another
industry growing. Tourism.
That’s Ali. His father was a salt miner.
But Ali has chosen a different path.
"I work as a local guide to bring tourists
to Dallol."
"I have lived in Dallol all my life.
Every day brings new things.
New people, new colors.
It never stops changing."
Because just under our feet is one of the
most active tectonic zones in the world.
Magma heats the groundwater, pushing it up
through cracks in the crust of the earth.
The water mixes with minerals and the salt
to create these rock formations and colors.
Sulphur makes the yellow,
copper makes the green.
Iron brings the red.
This landscape, a geyser island sitting
in the middle of the vast salt plain,
is like no other place in the world.
It’s a reminder that, just as the Afar
adapt to the forces that are changing
their traditional way of life, the earth
keeps shaping and shifting under our feet.
