I'd like to read a statement from the President on the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer I'm grateful for Shawn's work on behalf of my administration and the American people I wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities just look at his great television rating did you have any hesitation taking this job knowing it might cause some friction in that it might leagues Shawn Levy which is what's going to happen and the two are at least somewhat coincidental and did you have any hesitation about how you would relate to the rest of the White House that you came in under those circumstances okay well listen you know I'm a business person and so what happens in business a lot of the times is you have some rotation in personnel as you're as you're making changes and you have lifestyle choices that people are also making I would love to have shots here Sean decided that he thought it would be better to go and for me as a relation it speaks volumes to who he is as a human being who is as a team player okay so his attitude is the entities coming in let me clear the slate for Anthony and I do appreciate that about Sean and I love him for it but I don't have any friction with Sean I don't have any friction with Rights this is the White House the United States of America we're serving the president and I want to make sure that our cultural template is that we put the president's agenda first which is perfect for the American people and we serve as interest and so if we have a little bit of friction inside the White House as a result of that it's okay we can all live with that I'm a business person I'm used to dealing with friction here
