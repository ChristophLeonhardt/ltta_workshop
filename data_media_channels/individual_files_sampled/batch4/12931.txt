for the past two weeks the Trump administration has been slammed for supposedly tepid response to anti-semitic attacks on cemeteries and threats to Jewish community censors Trump himself was smashed over and over for suggesting that the threats might be coming from left-wing provocateurs attempting to cast a shadow on his administration he was widely mocked for such an assertion pretty much everyone on the Left assumed that the JCC threats had to be coming from Trump supporters including the intercept the left-wing publication that had lined just two days ago Trump can't accept his allies are targeting Jews so he blames his opponents and now turns out that the culprit at one point worked for the intercept on Friday a Missouri man named Juan Thompson was arrested for making multiple threats to JCC's across the country in order to harass his ex-girlfriend Thompson is suspected of being a copycat of hearing about the JCC phone calls and then conducting his own campaign of phone terrorism according to the FBI Thompson dated a Jewish woman after the relationship ended he sent two family emails and faxes to her employer he then stalked her after that he made quote at least eight jccc threats nationwide as part of his campaign against his ex-girlfriend he then tried to blame the woman in order to have her prosecuted he tweeted quote know any good lawyers need to stop this nasty racist hashtag white girl I dated who sent a bomb threat in my name and wants me to be raped in jail unquote so here's what we know about Thompson he's a left-wing reporter who made up material while working at the intercept he was fired in February 2016 for fabricating quotes in his stories and creating quote fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people one of which was the Gmail accounts in the name of the editor-in-chief of the publication he says he voted for Bernie Sanders Thompson who is black tweeted just two weeks ago that Trump was attempting to quote remove black people from the southside of Chicago naturally folks on the right are triumphantly pointing out the irony the guy behind the JCC threats isn't a Trump backer but a left-wing fake news guy who hates Trump who for weeks the left stated when four left 4 weeks left stated this had to be an outgrowth of trumpian anti-semitism but let's be fair for a second the guy sounds like a complete nutjob not just a left winger gone to ride according to the FBI this is all designed to act out some sort of personal vendetta against an old girlfriend who was Jewish the Jews were only involved in so far as they could be used as a tool against her it doesn't make the guy's contact any less egregious or anti-semitic but it doesn't really seem to connect to an ideology so much as a desire to hurt somebody he knew by using anti-semitism furthermore there's still another suspect out there dozens of JCC's have been called and this terrorist was a copycat but but this is evidence that while the left-wing media constantly accuses the right of jumping to conclusions about terrorism and ignoring right-wing terror involvement the left has a major blind spot for its own extremists and you just know that Trump's Twitter feed this morning will be totally epic I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so we'll talk a little bit more about that story I also want to talk about these

happened the other night with Donald Trump in his speech to a joint session of Congress was at that moment with Carrie Owens who's the the wife of the Karen Owens the wife of Ryan Owens is the Navy SEAL who was killed in this Yemen raid and the left has been saying that it is terrible Donald Trump used her he brought her out there and he used her and I got a bunch of questions about this people who were saying that it's just ridiculous he did use her or is it bad that he used her here's my view of politicians you just be clear about this my view of politicians using you know victims to promote their political agenda it's bad I don't like it I don't know that's what Trump was doing with Karen Owens if he was doing it in order to get the Yemen issue off the table yeah that's kind of yucky at the same time what it really was was him honoring a vet and if the issue was we need to draw closer to our vets then I'm all for it so it's not quite the same thing as bringing out the victim of gun violence issue like Piers Morgan did in order to in order to claim that everyone who disagrees with you on gun violence is some sort of evil person who wants people to get shot it's more here's the widow of a hero let's pay her tribute that's not the same thing in my mind whatsoever but I want to talk about the Democrats reaction to the Yemen raid because it really is telling so here's what you need to know about the Yemen right let's go through it actually happened we haven't talked at length about this on a lay out the timeline this is according to The Washington Post on November 7th of last year CENTCOM yo Central Command told the Pentagon about a plan to raid al-qaeda in Yemen the Defense Department approved the plan December 19th while Obama was still president and the Obama administration apparently took a look at it then once Trump was president he was briefed and defense secretary mattis recommended support for the raid Trump was briefed a bunch of times he finally authorized the raid January 26th or 27th On January 28th the raid happened apparently went wrong al Qaeda apparently knew the Americans were coming and attacked from a building upon which American forces had to call in an airstrike so they were using the building as a front basically hiding behind women and children because that's what terrorists do and we called in an air strike took out the building and killed a bunch of civilians and when when our soldiers were in trouble we also tried to send in mv-22 Osprey aircraft which is like a 75 million dollar aircraft and and it ended up crashing and we had to destroy the aircraft so the enemy didn't get ahold of it the Washington Post reported that 14 militants were killed terrorists were killed as were owns and numerous civilians the dead included the eight-year-old daughter of an Rolla key who's the the cleric that we droned under President Obama a few years ago several female terrorist rants who planned fighting positions opened fire on the seals according to US military officials Trump was in the White House during the raid and he was tweeting during right so what's the great objection over this whole thing what is the grand objection so there are two objections one is there's an objection saying that Trump never should have greenlit the raid that it was a risky raid he did it in order to show that he was macho I haven't really seen the evidence of that madisyn it it seems to me that if Madison proves it it's totally fair for Trump to rely on the judgment of a guy who should know much better than he should general mattis who has been doing this sort of stuff his entire life and then there is the second problem and this is where the left says this mission was a disaster and it was a giant failure this is the part I object to so I guess the idea here is that if Trump could have just roam the site Obama and not risk to American lives that would've been better and that would be better if specifically because no intelligence was found so there's now controversy over whether we found usable verifiable Intel at this place or not so apparently the seals went in they grabbed hard drives they grabbed laptops they grabbed cell phones and there's no an argument from leakers versus the administration the administration says there's an intellectual there's Intel that we can use and the leakers say there is no Intel that we can use but here's my question why should that matter how are the seals supposed to know what Intel is it how's the Defense Department supposed to know what Intel is on the phones or the computer they don't have the phone or the computer if they could have hacked them they would hack them right so they collected the materials and somebody died in the line of duty I don't understand why this is why if the mission went bad that is somehow a referendum on the president and I don't like this in general I really don't like this in general because the idea seems to be that if somebody is part of a mission that fails somehow their life was wasted or somehow that's the fault of the president that the mission failed that's pretty dangerous standard and to be fair I think President Trump when he was just Donald Trump was but he promulgated this he's a sort of fellow who's ripped the Bush administration and sort of imply that we had wasted thousands of lives in Iraq which is really gross because here's the truth in a war on terror in any war there will be missions that are successful and there will be missions that are unsuccessful you're not of more value because you were part of a mission that was unsuccessful than if you were part of a mission that was successful if you died at the First Battle of Bull Run as a Union soldier that didn't make your life any less valuable than if you died as a Union soldier at the Second Battle of Bull Run which the Union won it's very it's it's silly to try and say that if a mission goes bad or a battle goes bad the people who are in the bad mission are somehow less valuable or they wasted their lives or the botch was definitely the fault of the President of the United States as though every mission is going to be successful war isn't science and not every operation is gonna go as planned now a lot of people on the Left are saying well you know Trump isn't getting the sort of flack over the Yemen raid that Obama got over Benghazi right and he shouldn't because those are two completely different things okay and I'll tell you why there are a lot of military missions under Obama that went wrong their missions where seals got killed and you really didn't hear the the American people or the people on the right making too big an issue of it because we understand in a war there gonna be some missions that go wrong that are badly planned badly coordinated or where the crap just hits the fan but that's not what happened in Benghazi him thank God it wasn't a mission Benghazi was an ambassador sitting there requesting help for months and months and months didn't get it and then things went bad that's not the same thing as a military mission where we don't have all the information they had every bit of information it wasn't a military attack it wasn't an attack intended to go after the bad guys who's literally a guy sitting in an office in Benghazi and he was attacked by a bunch of terrorists and the Obama administration should have known that that was going to happen and done something to protect him or withdraw him ASAP that's their fault so the equating Benghazi with the Yemen raid is really illogical and quite foolish but it just demonstrates the extent to which the left is going to go in order to push this agenda and it's it's really I think incredible the extent to which they'll go in order to push their agenda the latest example of this is the attempt to go after Jeff session so as I said yesterday I talked about the Jeff Sessions issue attorney general sessions has now recused himself from any investigation of Trump Russia connections or connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians and and the Democrats are saying it's not enough for him to recuse you should resign so I want to go through how this broke down because the truth is he should recuse he should not resign and it is very silly for the Democrats to claim this and also the Trump administration really has to get their Commons office in order they they do need to get their communications office in order because it just looks messy and that feeling of chaos is not helpful so here's how all this started flashback to January of this year Al Franken senator from Minnesota he asks chef sessions during his confirmation hearings did you have talks with the Russians and here's what session says these documents also allegedly stated quote there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do senator Franken I'm not aware of any of those activities I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have to not have communications with the Russians and I'm unable to comment okay so people take this there's two ways to read this exchange one is that sessions is saying as a campaign surrogate I did not have contacts with the Russians and the other is I didn't have contact with the Russians and I was a campaign surrogate and those are both plausible readings it seems to me that the question was you know if anyone from the Trump campaign had contact with the Russians and he is saying I never had contact with the Russians then it turns out that he had two meetings with the ambassador that I'm sort of sort of get Chris Lee ACK which is just the typical Russian ambassador named he's by the way surrogate Chris Lee AK is getting more attention this week than he will up to the week that Putin murders him but in any case Stuart Smalley asks Andy Griffith about this and you know this becomes a big issue because the idea now is that somehow sessions has something to hide somehow he's working with the Russians to do something nefarious now well III think that that is wildly exaggerated I don't think there's a lot of evidence that that sessions was doing anything nefarious there are lots of senators who've met but that's not really the issue the issue is whether he lied about it it's whether he covered it up whether there was anything to cover up is another issue but just like him it seems everything in politics now boils down to if you're not totally transparent and forth right at the very beginning then you get smacked which is why it seems to me if you can't identify any wrongdoing but all you can identify is that somebody you know misheard the question or answered wrong or even if you lied you know if you lied I guess that's perjury you should resign but if it just looks like what it is which is he answered the question as I was a campaign surrogate for Trump and I didn't have any meetings with the Russians and he never thought well I'm a senator and I had a meeting with the Russian ambassador you know that seems to me okay recused because it is a you know it gives a scalp to the Democrats I suppose but the truth is that it looks mildly compromised so recuse let your deputy do all the work what's the big deal but no but don't resign but the left has to play this over the top so Chuck Schumer says it's not enough for sessions to recuse himself the Senate Minority Leader says that sessions should resign for weeks I have said that attorney general sessions needs to recuse himself from any investigation into contacts between the president and his associates on the campaign and transition and Russia for weeks I made clear that I believe Attorney General Sessions close relationship with the Trump campaign requires that he recuse himself from the executive branch investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia okay and so this is over the top obviously because Democrats feel like there's blood in the water now part of the problem here is how the Trump administration handled this so what they should have said is sessions should have answer more specifically he didn't do anything wrong but to avoid the appearance of impropriety he's gonna recuse himself that's what you handle this instead what you end up with because this is always the way it works with the Trump administration they need to get their common office in order instead what you get is this this mass confusion before such an recuse himself so Trump comes out he says we have total confidence in sessions and you shouldn't recuse himself yes in Russia listen I think he has a right to be grumpy about all this cuz it's really silly is really silly okay every senator has met with chrisley AK or Russian or Russian members of the administration Obama I guess had chrisley AK into the White House like 22 times so again there's no underlying problem here but should sessions have answered that he never ever spoke with anybody from Russia clearly not could even misremembered sure is it a big deal no but again Trump says he shouldn't recuse himself and then Paul Ryan says that sessions should not recuse himself well okay two questions first I would just refer to the Senate Judiciary Committee I checked the transcript on all of that so I can't speak to what the Judiciary Committee transcript has frankly I haven't read that I'm sure did community Susan recuse himself I think he answered that question this morning which is if he himself is the subject of an investigation of course he would but if he's not I don't see any purpose or reason to doing this and so that's the that's the answer and it's a consistent answer its head Cruz and he said it's the same things a lot of political theater and he's right so there's a good grounds here if you're going to say don't recuse yourself and everybody's gonna immediately gonna say don't recuse yourself and don't recuse yourself the problem is that sessions then recuse himself which makes it look like there is something more going on it's just stupid politics they should have come out yesterday morning and as a body they should have said exactly what I said right they should have said he didn't do anything wrong but he misremembered and that gives the appearance of impropriety he's gonna recuse himself just so that everything looks perfectly clean now before I go any further I want to make you guys an offer as listeners and Watchers of the Ben Shapiro show this is an offer that you can't get anywhere else because it is actually SuperDuper cool would you like $1,500 to buy the gun of your dreams really 1,500 bucks to buy the gun of your dreams well they need to work with my friends the United States concealed-carry Association so us CCA is changing the game for responsible gun owners like you and preparing us for everything that comes before during and after a self-defense shooting so they have shooting club you know they teach you how to use your gun things you how to act during you know some if something bad happens during some breaks in your house how to treat that and then they also help you with defense afterward because just cuz you did the right thing doesn't mean that you won't you know the police won't arrest you so you have to have people to help you out that's what the u.s. concealed-carry Association does and you know what they're doing right now is actually super cool which is they want to get ten people in my audience fifteen hundred dollars to buy the gun of their dreams so if you want a ar-15 or if you want a custom 1911 any gun that you're dreaming of could be yours because over at CCA USC CA they've started a website defend my family now calm and you can enter for the chance to win that fifteen hundred dollars so go over to defend my family now calm enter for that free chance to win fifteen hundred dollars toward any gun that you want it's super cool defend my family now calm and check out their membership program there's nothing out there like it again they have all sorts of services that provides the gun owners information classes defense they're the people that you need to talk to if you are in as a gun owner I will say I think you SCCA the u.s. concealed carry Association is indispensable you should certainly get a membership you should be working with them if you're a responsible gun owner you almost have a responsibility to work with them plus it's kind of cool that right now you do have that shot to win fifteen hundred dollars to buy any gun that you want at defend my family now calm defend my family now calm go over and check them out the u.s. concealed carry Association okay so session all this happens and then sessions finally recuse himself so you have the entire Trump administration again the confusion is the part that I think is frustrating to people they all say he shouldn't recuse himself not gonna recuse himself and then sessions comes out and he says yeah I guess I'll recuse myself and my staff recommended recusal they said that since I had involvement with the campaign I should not be involved in any campaign investigation I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation I believe those recommendations are right and just therefore I have recused myself in matters that deal with the Trump campaign the exact language of that refusal is in the press release that we we will give you okay so again the whole thing looks shadier than it is just because when you botch communications it matters somebody needs to get that White House press that White House communications in order they really need to get this crap in order because again the more they do this the more amateur s get looks and that's just a problem it's a problem it's gonna dog them all so I would like to see a full investigation so that we could get all of this behind us it's either true or it's not true if it's not true then I'd like this cloud to dissipate and if it is true I'd like to know it and I think we have a right to know it okay so if you want to listen
