I used San Marzano San Marzano tomato
some Marzano tomato you're gonna know
it's in a can so there is no peel san
marzano tomatoes gotta be can and
although a lot of people are fanatic of
doing tomato sauce with fresh tomato
I tell you tomato sauce it's a lot
better when it's done with canned tomato
because you can keep it consistent
throughout the year we're still talking
about tomato who cares
with yet a lot of question about tomato
okay doesn't matter you got to cook them
anyway so if you want to eat a salad
today they better be cold but if you
want to cook nobody cares it's not a
cake you don't have to bake any with it
