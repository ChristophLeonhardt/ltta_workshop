00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
hi YouTube so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just shift</font>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,600
around a little bit and film here next

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,490
to the embarrassing photos of my friends

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,020
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> University random people from</font>

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,210
magazines and vote lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,889
Iliad I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found amazing that</font>

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,410
this massive poem has been passed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,389
such a long time voice has is relevant

9
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,859
so it's raising these little questions

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,930
that I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> this applies to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,340
life yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were talking about</font>

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,920
Achilles as a sort of invar man his

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,260
mother's goddess and his father's mortal

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,660
warriors<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general are kind of</font>

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,849
uberman we're all very close to death

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,859
for example but warriors<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to</font>

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,480
kind of accept that and take it in their

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,340
stride there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this scene in book 9</font>

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,660
which we will get yesterday where you

20
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">come upon Achilles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whose isolate himself</font>

21
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,160
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big argument in book one with</font>

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980
Agamemnon when he accuses Agamemnon of

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,809
trying to take away his honor by<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">back to fight the Achaeans arm using a</font>

28
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,039
lot of men though they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know this</font>

29
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,510
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the killings asked his</font>

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,090
messy lots of God's get involved

33
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Achilles refuses to get back because</font>

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,990
nothing Agamemnon can do we has any

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,640
will do etc etc etc what's more

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,020
interesting I think is this conflict

40
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,210
between what the Greeks called no stops

41
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,970
which I believe means home the root for

42
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,880
the word nostalgia Claire's but<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's</font>

43
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,130
kind of glory but our lecturer whose

44
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,810
wonderful describe it more as being

45
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,790
heard of people kind of hearing of you

46
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,229
the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> way a war ii would be heard</font>

47
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,299
of is actually through these poems the

48
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,100
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being immortalized through</font>

49
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,290
poetry the<font color="#CCCCCC"> romantics especially paid</font>

50
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,490
with this a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concert or</font>

know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that we seek to find</font>

something in the way they've been for

61
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,000
thousands of years we've been caught

62

between<font color="#E5E5E5"> this North dogs and payouts</font>

63
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,180
Achilles has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the choice of going home</font>

64
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,000
and living his life or dying in battle

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,450
in remembered through poetry and through

66
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,590
story and having that glory which<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

67
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,360
to go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font>

70
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,340
horrible photos where they're like hey I

71
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,739
despise that kind of stuff occasionally

72
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,269
I'll watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality program I can't</font>

73
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,280
watch x<font color="#E5E5E5"> factor or something just for fun</font>

74
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,690
and sometimes because people are

75
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,340
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but I've always</font>

76
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,599
said if I can never write something that

77
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,599
has a positive impact kind of helps just

78
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,930
one person in one way then that would be

79
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,790
worth it what I write will be worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

80
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,390
and in a way what I do as a human like

81
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,860
that will be worth it and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

82
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering to what extent is that glory</font>

83
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,480
the glory of my name it doesn't mean

84
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,860
people are going to put up statues with

85
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,690
me but I still want that recognition and

86
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,819
after all glories about recognition

87
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,799
Judaizing as a culture thing do you

88
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,870
think that see human nature thing and do

89
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's possible to find a middle</font>

90
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,680
way as arguably Odysseus does in the

91
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,629
Odyssey between having both the glory

92
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,519
and the home they're not stops in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,440
clear that idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being hired of is</font>

94
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
very limited we hate to admit it but

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,500
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a time when there's</font>

96
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,299
no one to hear of us I mean there's no

97
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,650
one to read our books when there's no

98
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,660
one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I name say a point before I</font>

99
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,880
even humans die out or anything if

100
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,980
people just won't understand and just

101
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,109
wait care I wonder is it not better to

102
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,030
embrace the North dose to embrace the

103
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,459
good life to live well to live kindly

104
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,859
turn away from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> glory or is that just</font>

105
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,660
an illusion like is that ever possible

106
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,870
are we ever able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn away from the</font>

107
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,880
cliffs I genuinely want your answers to

108
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,709
this people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing well I have my last</font>

113
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,049
read dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde for a

classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> are today actually I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read it</font>

115

now ah I'll talk to you guys soon it

117
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,430

today probably not going to know who

119
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,549
this isn't my job if I stay remember
