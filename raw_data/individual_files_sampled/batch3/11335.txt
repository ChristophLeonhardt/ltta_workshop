group of women working in his really high tech companies have staged the flash mob in central Tel Aviv posing with a cardboard cutouts of a German Chancellor to mock her group photo of a meeting with an all-male group of Israeli tech specialists a few days earlier the women also hoped to highlight gender imbalance within the technology industry Mecca was here last week she met with future leaders was the name of the group and rarely it was a meeting about innovation and and future developments and she commented during the meeting on the fact there was not a single woman in the room a photograph from that meeting that was released a world media immediately after showed her standing in the middle of a group of about 25 min now we thought that in response to that the thing to do was to simply stage an alternative photograph well the Israeli Foreign Ministry has responded saying that the choice of who to send to the meeting was simply done to the companies involved and apologized but the lack of women wasn't picked up during preparations for the event we are sorry for that and are committed to doing the best we can together with other partners to prevent such cases in the future and to ensure the appropriate representation of women I received the apology from the foreign ministry and I have spoken personally to the people involved I was told that it was unintentional but you know it's not acceptable to us that in 2018 almost 2019 people should not notice that there's not a single woman in the room how can you not notice that half the population isn't represented you
