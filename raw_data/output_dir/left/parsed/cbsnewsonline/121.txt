BIPARTISAN WAY TO ENACT. 
CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD 
PAYING JOBS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED TO 
DRAIN THE SWAMP. 
BUT HE'S TURNED IT INTO A 
CESSPOOL. 
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE WATER OUR 
CHILDREN DRINK, THE AIR THEY 
BREATHE, THE RIGHTS OF 
AMERICA'S CONSUMERS AND THE 
INTEGRITY ARE OF OUR AMERICAN 
-- OF OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY 
AND THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC 
SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
DEMOCRATS ARE HERE TO OFFER A 
BETTER DEAL FOR THE PEOPLE WITH 
BETTER JOBS, BETTER WAGES AND 
BETTER FUTURE. 
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
EXCUSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOVED 
UP THE VOTE UNTIL NOW. 
SO THANK YOU. 
>> CAN YOU COME BACK AFTER THE 
VOTE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS? 
>> WE COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT. 
IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG IT TAKES 
WE'LL SEE. 
OKAY THANK YOU. 
THAT'S UP TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW 
THE ROOM IS USED BY OTHERS 
FOLLOWING. 
>> SO NANCY PELOSI HAVING TO 
RUN OFF AND NOT TAKING 
QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OF 
MEDIA AND AUDIENCE THERE. 
SHE REITERATED HER 
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE RUSSIA 
SUMMIT SAYING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT LOOKED FRIGHTENED. 
STANDING NEXT TO VLADIMIR 
PUTIN. 
AND THEN THERE WAS SORT OF A 
LONG LAUNDRY LIST OF OTHER WAYS 
IN WHICH SHE IS DISAPPOINTED BY 
THE PRESIDENT. 
BUT ONCE AGAIN THE INITIAL 
FOCUS WAS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
SHORING UP THE SECURITY FOR THE 
ELECTION SYSTEM HERE AS WE MOVE 
INTO OF COURSE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN AND WE 
ARE ALWAYS ON. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RAMPING 
UP HIS ATTACKS ON THOSE WHO 
HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF HIS 
SUMMIT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
MR. TRUMP TWEETED EARLIER TODAY 
CALLING HIS SUMMIT WITH PUTIN 
QUOTE A GREAT SUCCESS, EXCEPT 
WITH THE REAL ENEMY OF THE 
PEOPLE. 
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THAT HE 
NOW LOOKS FORWARD TO A SECOND 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
>>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR JAMES 
LANGFORD OF OKLAHOMA JOINS ME 
NOW FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
HE'S THE MEMBER OF THE SENATE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND ALSO 
THE HOMELAND SECURITY AND 
GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATOR 
FOR JOINING US. 
>> GLAD TO. 
>> SO WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 
TO JEFF GLOR, HE TOLD HIM THAT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN -- THAT HE TOLD 
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THAT SUMMIT 
IN THAT PRIVATE ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING, HE TOLD HIM TO STOP 
INTERFERING WITH OUR ELECTION. 
HE DIDN'T MENTION THAT DURING 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
DO YOU WISH HE HAD SAID 
SOMETHING PUBLICLY? 
DO YOU THINK HE DID ENOUGH? 
>> WELL, WE'LL KNOW IN THE DAYS 
AHEAD WHETHER HE DID ENOUGH AND 
I DO WISH HE HAD SAID SOMETHING 
PUBLICLY. 
THAT WAS A GOOD MOMENT TO BE 
ABLE TO PUSH BACK. 
HE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO DO THAT. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TO 
PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE PAST 
KNOCK IT OFF. 
I THINK WAS THE PHRASE THAT HE 
USED TO BE ABLE TO TOYOTA. 
ULTIMATELY PUT -- STOP IT. 
ULTIMATELY PUT ADDITIONAL 
PRESSURE ON RUSSIA. 
WE HAVE SANCTIONS ON THE 
OLIGARCHS THAT FUNDED THE 
SOCIAL MEDIA ATTACK. 
IT'S TIME TO ALSO ADD SANCTIONS 
TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE 
DIRECTLY ATTACKING OUR SYSTEMS. 
>> YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAVE SUGGESTED ON 
MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THERE 
ARE OTHER ACTORS ATTEMPTING TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS, I 
WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 
SOUND FOR SECURE THEN WE'LL 
TALK -- YOU AND THEN WE'LL TALK 
AFTERWARDS. 
>> I ACCEPT OUR INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY'S CONCLUSION THAT 
RUSSIA'S MEDDLING IN THE 2016 
ELECTION TOOK PLACE. 
COULD BE OTHER PEOPLE ALSO. 
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 
THERE. 
>> WEAR AWARE OF OTHERS THAT 
HAVE -- WE'RE AWARE OF OTHERS 
THAT HAVE MADE ATTEMPTS BUT I 
CAN'T GET INTO OTHERS AT THIS 
POINT. 
>> YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, ARE YOU 
AWARE OF OTHER ACTORS ATTEMPT 
TO BE MEDDLE IN THE U.S --   
U.S -- ATTEMPTING TO MEDDLE IN 
THE U.S. ELECTIONS? 
>> THE LEVEL THAT THE RUSSIANS 
HAVE DONE IS FAR AND AWAY 
GREATER THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT'S 
TRIED TO DO AND IT THE 
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE 
GOVERNMENT AND BETWEEN PRIVATE 
ENTITIES LIKE THE INTERNET 
RESEARCH AGENCY AND OTHER 
ENTITIES THEY'RE PUSHING OUT TO 
AFFECT OUR ELECTIONS DWARF 
ANYONE ELSE BY COMPARISON. 
THINK KEEPING THE FOCUS ON WHAT 
THE RUSSIANS HAVE DONE IS A 
GOOD THING TO BE ABLE TO DO BUT 
ALSO BEING AWARE THAT THEY'RE 
NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE OUT 
THERE. 
THAT COULD TRY TO INTERFERE IN 
OUR ELECTIONS. 
>> SO WHO ARE THESE OTHER 
ACTORS? 
OTHER COUNTRIES AND IS THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTEMPTING 
TO PROSECUTE THEM AS WELL? 
>> WELL, WE'RE GOING THROUGH 
INVESTIGATING I MEAN IT'S NOT 
AS EASY AS IT LOOKS ON THE 
MOVIE TO BE ABLE TO SEE AND 
IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE 
EVERYTHING IS COMING FROM. 
WHAT'S CALLED TRICK WHEN YOU 
SEE DIFFERENT -- AATRANSCRIBE 
USE. 
SOMETIMES YOU CAN TELL WHERE 
THAT'S COMING FROM AND STATION 
SOMETIMES IT MAKES MONTHS AND 
MONTHS OF RESEARCH. 
BUT IT'S A LISTENING TIME. 
AGAIN I COME BACK TO THERE'S NO 
ONE DOING IT LIKE THE LEVEL THE 
RUSSIANS ARE DOING IT. 
NOT ONLY ACROSS ALL OF EUROPE 
AND UKRAINE AND OTHER AREAS BUT 
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 
>> ALL RIGHT, SO IN INSPHERE 
VIEW BEFORE THAT SUMMIT. 
YOU TOLD NRP THAT THE 12 
RUSSIANS CHARGED WITH HACKING 
WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT 
LEVERAGE ONCE HE IS SITTING 
DOWN WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
YOU CALLED IT A GIFT FROM 
MUELLER BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT COULD CITE CLEAR 
EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED 
IN THE ELECTION. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 
USED THAT INFORMATION AS 
LEVERAGE WHEN HE WAS WITH THE 
POTION PRESIDENT? 
>> YEAH THAT -- RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT? 
>> YEAH THAT I DON'T KNOW 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THAT TWO HOUR 
CONVERSATION ON IT AND QUITE 
FRANKLY SHOULDN'T KNOW. 
I WOULD HOPE THAT HE WOULD VERY 
SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE BY 
QUITE FRANKLY BY CHRIS WALLACE 
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN WHEN HE HAD THE 
INDICTMENT IN HIS HAND AND 
TRIED TO HAND IT RIGHT TO 
PRESIDENT PUTIN TO SAY THIS IS 
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS AND 
-- WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS AND 
OF COURSE PUTIN WOULDN'T ACCEPT 
IT. 
THE BIG ISSUE THOUGH IS WE DO 
HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THAT. 
WE'VE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME 
AND OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
HAS SEEN IT FOR A LONG TIME. 
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'M GLAD 
HAS COME OUT OF THE PUBLIC IN 
THE DETAIL THAT IT HAS AND TO 
BE ABLE TO USE THAT TO SAY TO 
THE RUSSIANS YOU'VE GOT TO BE 
ABLE TO STOP OR WE'LL CONTINUE 
TO ADD SANCTIONS TO YOU. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU A DEABOUT 
A TOPIC THAT SAY -- QUESTION 
ABOUT A TOPIC THAT SARAH 
SANDERS WAS ASKED ABOUT 
YESTERDAY. 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT YET 
REJECTED PUTIN'S INTEREST IN 
QUESTIONING SEVERAL AMERICANS 
INCLUDING FORMER AMBASSADOR TO 
RUSSIA MICHAEL McFALL FOR 
ALLEGED CRIMES. 
THAT WOULD BE IN EXCHANGE FOR 
THE U.S. QUESTIONING THE 12 
RUSSIAN OFFICERS CHARGED WITH 
HACKING INTO THE DNC. 
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD 
SUPPORT? 
>> I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY THAT 
IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD NOT 
ENTERTAIN. 
NOT GOING TO TURN OVER AN 
AMERICAN CITIZEN TO A RUSSIAN 
COURT OR A RUSSIAN INVESTIGATOR 
TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THEIR 
LIFE AND THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. 
WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF ABUSES OF 
THAT. 
OBVIOUSLY RUSSIA DOES NOT HAVE 
FREE COURTS THEY DON'T HAVE A 
FREE PRESS. 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME 
INDEPENDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
AND I HAVE ZERO TRUST FOR THEIR 
LEGAL SYSTEM. 
SO I WOULD ABSOLUTELY OPPOSE 
ANY AMERICAN BEING TURNED OVER 
TO ANY RUSSIAN FOR QUESTIONING 
LIKE THAT. 
>> YOU KNOW ALL -- 
>> ESPECIALLY A DIPLOMAT. 
>> RIGHT. 
ALL THIS CONVERSATION ASIDE, 
WE'RE HEADING INTO THE MIDTERM 
ELECTION. 
YOU KNOW, AMERICANS ARE 
CONCERNED. 
WE KNOW NOW THAT THE RUSSIANS 
CONTINUE TO MEDDLE OR ATTEMPT 
TO MEDDLE IN OUR ELECTORAL 
SYSTEM. 
WHAT CONFIDENCE CAN YOU GIVE 
VOTERS THAT THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS WILL BE PROTECTED? 
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON A 
BILL. 
>> SURE, I AM WORKING ON A BILL 
A BIPARTISAN BILL WITH AMY 
KLOBUCHAR THAT WE WORKED ON FOR 
MONTHS AND MONTHS TO BE ABLE GO 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. 
HAD TWO HEARINGS IN THE RULES 
COMMITTEE RECENTLY AND WORKING 
TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT TO THE 
FLOOR. 
BUT INTERESTING A LOT OF 
REPORTING ON DIFFERENT 
STATEMENTS MADE BY THE 
ADMINISTRATION ONE WAY OR THE 
OTHER ABOUT RUSSIA BUT THEIR 
WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY ON SECURING 
OUR ELECTIONS HAS BEEN STELLAR. 
THEY HAVE WORKS VERY HARD TO BE 
ABLE TO GIVE SECURITY 
CLEARANCE. 
WORKING TO EVALUATE THE CYBER 
PROTECTIONS FOR EVERY STATE 
THAT MADE THE REQUEST. 
OBVIOUSLY STATES RUN ELECTIONS 
BUT IF A STATE REQUESTED IT THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS STEPPING 
IN TO PROVIDE THEM ADDITIONAL 
ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO WORK 
ON MAKING SURE THEIR SYSTEM IS 
SECURE. 
WE JUST ALLOTTED $380 MILLION 
TO THE STATES TO BE ALLOWED TO 
UPGRADE THE SYSTEMS AND 
SECURITY UPGRADE ULTIMATELY 
THEIR MACHINES. 
NOW THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO 
CHANGE THE ELECTION MACHINES BY 
2018 BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
DO IT BY 2020. 
BUT AGAIN, I REPEAT. 
IT'S A STATE'S SPEEDOMETER TO 
BE ABLE TO -- RESPONSIBILITY TO 
BE ABLE TO RUN ELECTIONS. 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN 
PARTNER WITH THEM BUT 
ULTIMATELY IT'S THE STATE THAT 
HAS TO RUN IT. 
>> ALL RIGHT, SENATOR JAMES 
LANGFORD, THANKS FOR GIVING US 
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. 
>> YOU BET GLAD TO HELP. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 
QUICK BREAK BUT WE'VE GOT A LOT 
MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
THIS IS CBSN, CBS NEWS, ALWAYS 
ON. 
>>> A NEW STUDY SHOWS CHILDREN 
OF WORKING MOTHERS ARE JUST AS 
HAPPY LATER IN LIFE AS KIDS OF 
STAY AT HOME MOMS. 
71% OF EMPLOYED WOMEN IN THE 
U.S. HAVE CHILDREN 18 YEARS OLD 
AND YOUNGER. 
THE STUDY BY A HARVARD 
UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR FOUND THAT 
DAUGHTERS OF WORKING MOMS ARE 
MORE LIKELY TO ADVANCE IN THEIR 
OWN CAREERS. 
IT ALSO FOUND THAT WHEN THE 
SONS OF WORKING MOMS STARTED 
THEIR OWN FAMILIES, THEY SPENT 
50 MORE MINUTES EACH WEEK 
CARING FOR THEM. 
SO STOP FEELING GUILTY MOMS.
