hi I'm Malika Balad today owning up to decades of racist reporting in the pages of National Geographic will look at the one hundred and thirty year old magazines recent apology hello I am so Jewish journalist of the Hungarian weekly a tavella's and you are in history how should media organizations atone for racist reporting of the past National Geographic magazine recently apologized for a history of racism in its coverage of non-western cultures and people of color around the world in this month's special the race issue the publication said it could not cover stories about race without acknowledging its own past and upholding certain stereotypes here's editor-in-chief Susan Goldberg in an interview with PBS Newshour so when we decided to do an issue devoted to race I didn't think that we could do that in a credible way without looking at our own history you know there's so much of our history that we are so proud of that we have sent writers and explorers and scientists and researchers all over the world but it did feel important to me if we were going to look at race that we look at some of the things that we weren't quite as proud of known for its iconic photography National Geographic had long portrayed non-white people as exotic primitive and uncivilized as part of its own examination the magazine asked photography historian John Edwin Mason to evaluate its coverage of people of color over the years and learn where it could have done better so joining us to discuss his findings is John Edwin Mason who teaches African history and a history of photography at the University of Virginia also with us from Stonington Connecticut is Katherine Lutz a professor of anthropology at Brown University she co-authored the 1993 book reading National Geographic and joining us in London is Chicago dot banaji an associate professor in the department of media and communications at the London School of Economics now we reached out to National Geographic for a representative to appear on this program but they declined our offer so welcome to all of our guests and if you're watching us on youtube send us your comments you're welcome and your questions and I'll try to get them into the show you can also tweet us at AJ stream Oh John how would you describe your relationship to the magazine of which I have several issues here on my desk because so many of us are the world know this magazine very intimately because we grew up with it we're you a reader sure absolutely I grew up in a middle-class American family and if you grew up in a middle-class American family very likely your parents subscribed to national Neck National Geographic and also very likely they never threw it away there was something iconic about the magazine the physical magazine that made it almost impossible for people to toss it out like they tossed out the newspaper so yes I grew up reading it I enjoyed it as a child as a child that took me to places that I had never been it showed me people I'd never seen before the photography was fantastic and I have to admit that I mainly looked at the photography I don't think I read the stories very closely and the fact that I eventually became a historian of photography partly has to do with the way that photography enchanted me when I was a kid and the photography at National Geographic in particular but I do have to say that I grew up as an African American and so in the back of my mind I was trouble by the way that I saw people with brown and black skins being represented in the magazine but I didn't have at the time as a child I didn't have the vocabulary and I didn't have the language to express those reservations so you mentioned the photography and and that is something that resonates with our community this is a tweet we got from Denver and cube who says there is much that has not been covered correctly or fairly when it comes to rates hence the narrative feeds the global image of so-called quote unquote savage lands many people unfortunately had that narrative seared into their minds and it drives prejudice she comes to like can you relate to what he's saying of an image seared into minds of faraway places filled with savages absolutely and it doesn't just have to be an image filled with savages I think one of the things one has to recognize is that you can have exotic images of things that look very beautiful and look very good which might be the only image that somebody has in their head of a particular place and it has a strange effect in that other places which are next to that place might be very very similar but don't get the same kind of coverage and I'll give you the example which is if you take the two countries India and Pakistan in the international media sphere often India gets associated with beauty and peace and and temples and and and the river Ganges whereas Pakistan seems to be almost uniformly represented as somehow the birthplace of terrorism and this is the case in South Asian media it's the case in international Western media - and when you talk to people you say what's your first thought and you talk to students and you say what's your first thought about these places peacefulness and spirituality spring to mind immediately relating to India which is just as much a stereotype and just as much a deception as the notion that Pakistan is the place of terrorism and so on I can see you nodding your head there what did you learn that surprised you upon going back through the archives through the photos to do this research well I have to say that that tweet that you just showed us resonated tremendously with me because I have two relationships with National Geographic and one is that child who was enchanted by the magazine and the other as the adult who sees it through critical eyes and I agree entirely with that tweet now when I was invited to go into their archives I was happy to see that National Geographic was not defensive at all and they welcomed me into their archives but I frankly wasn't surprised by what I had seen and that's partly because are one of our guests Katherine Lutz co-authored a brilliant about National Geographic that has become a classic and that I certainly have read more than once and I read it again in in anticipation of going into the archive so I was prepared to pour what I found what was good to see was not simply images that had been published but images that had been unpublished so I was able to see how photographers were working I was able to see how the editorial process worked and it was an opportunity to a really deep dive into the into National Geographic it's published volumes so I read much more thoroughly than I had in the past so this conversation would be nothing without solid examples and images and so I'm gonna take us through a couple of tabs here and then Katherine you want to jump in because of course he referenced your work that so many have read on this topic I welcome you to do that so take a look here this is from the archives team or Ireland warriors wearing silver breastplates crowd around the photographer to see his camera this is just one example here's another cotton or most fiber of the world what are we looking at here John well what we're looking is looking at is a very stereotypical and frankly demeaning representation of African Americans in this particular issue this particular image that's on the frame right now and it harkens back to minstrel shows where African Americans were shown as happy in their oppression as seen as musical as seen as willing subordinates it's an image that not only reproduces and reinforces but naturalizes and legitimates a racially oppressive system and you know not only depicting african-americans as inferiors but saying that this is a natural and a natural social system and one that African Americans willingly accept you right now you're showing us an African American Butler who's arranging things and Ankle a shil us and he's smiling as he doesn't so he's sort of smiling in his subordination these in these images we heard time and time again in the magazine reinforcing in the minds of its readers that this was simply the natural and ordinary way that things work this is the 19th that's a depressed photo different well I was going to say that first photo you showed of the camera is a very common trope they would have many pictures of people with cameras looking at cameras with sort of amazement or looking in mirrors and in a sense some of the more subtle messages are about people of color around the world being without history being served timeless and timeless present and some of the more subtle ways in which photographs communicate to us about race and reinforce ideas that are out there already in the readership about race I think those are really important for people to learn how to see because they're they're seeing them but just not recognizing that they are and can I just jump in their blog that you mentioned because the thing that strikes me about that is the fact that it's white people and technology and this is a trope that we have been studying and seeing again and again through the years and the frequency with which you see now someone with a wonderful camera as opposed to someone with some older technological tool a whole pic some kind of scythe or you see someone with new digital technology and a smartphone being looked at enviously by villagers in a place where they've never seen that before or children who've never seen that before this is carrying the idea that modernity is white that modernity is technologized that you can't have modern ideas or political systems which don't rely on these kinds of technological things and I think a good example of that would be the way in which facebook revolution became the trope which defined the Middle East in 2011 although it was decades and decades of people working in many different ways using old media using graffiti to try and galvanize a kind of resistance to oppressive regimes into hunger and poverty but none of that came across it suddenly became Facebook and Twitter which were Western invention became the story so it should come together here someone who might agree with you this is a tweet from kindy who says for goodness sake how is the apology that I'll mention in a minute how is that supposed to help anyone not Gio has entrenched the idea that only white people can discover engage in conservation of any form and that the darker races of earths do not care about conservation so that's just one example apparently but I got to move to this this apology that this person references in their tweet because of course we have this cover which came out this month this is the April 2018 cover I'll show it to our audience right here you can see it on my screen here and it's gotten a lot of conversation going online here is just one of the tweets from someone that will recognize Oprah Winfrey tweets in I read every article this issue was remarkable great job Nat Geo of course not everyone felt similarly I want to share this article this is from The New Yorker the National Geographic twins and the falsehood of our post-racial future John sure yes please the floor is yours I I think they're both right and I think Oprah is exactly right it's an extraordinary issue with extraordinary writers and extraordinary photographers of color and from around the world who are not pulling their punches in addressing issues of race so much of the criticism of this issue of the magazine has been not addressed at the content of the magazine but at the editors letter and the story on the two little girls now I think the story on the two little girls is poorly cast the takeaway point is that race is simply a social construction and so it doesn't matter but of course social constructions matter race is very powerful it may be simply an idea it may have no reality in biology but it shapes the world in which people live it shapes oppression so I I agree with the criticism of that video that so many people saw and the story about the two little girls but I really encourage people to actually grapple with the content the rest of the content magazine which is really extraordinary for a popular for a popular magazine mm-hmm yeah I think it's great to encourage that closer reading um I think what we know about how people look at media is also important so many people will have just seen that cover they will have just gone to that story that it feels comfortable that feels like a feel-good story for particularly for our wider audience and I think that that understanding of how people what kinds of information they might avoid and what kinds of information they prefer to look at helps explain both the history and maybe the present of the the geographic and of their media I would have shared this tonight so come thought I'll go to you with this actually but I want to share this tweet we got from our community this is Alan he says I deeply appreciate that the editors of national Geographics April issue on race begins with a clear and painful confession of how their magazine contributed to racism in America if you haven't picked up a copy I strongly encourage you to do so this is a reply that he got from someone this is Kelly and Kelly says I'm not trying to be rude but my question would be why did they think that highlighting these twins had anything to do with racism or even race because both of them are black actually they're biracial half black Jamaican descent and half white but she come to I do you want to take that on I'll take on the first tweet because I think it's really important to encourage self reflection in large media organizations and whatever and also to ask the question why are they doing this and why now at this particular moment in history so I think there's two things I'd like to say for anyone who has read the content and I strongly encourage people to read the content rather than just looking at the cover and of course having a visceral reaction to the cover and one thing is we've often through history and this happens a lot with the Second World War we tend to defend the present by going back and apologizing about the past but it's not good enough to say once we acknowledge the past everything's okay you have to look at the way in which the past has shaped the present and the way in which present racist practices of representation are continuously reinforcing and also co-opting and reinventing new forms of Orientalism and new forms of racism and it's not and I think one of the things that I'd say is it's great that they've done this it's just the tip of the iceberg it's just a beginning and people need to take it forward and I mean people not just in Western media organizations people in Asian media organizations so for instance looking at the way in which Indian media represents China so the notion of self Orientalism the way in which China represents itself to the world in various programs or represents itself to itself and media organizations large news organizations tend to have stereotypes about the self which are somehow building off of those historical stereotypes they haven't gone away they're just morphing into different forms hmm so I what are the things that would really happen to have or it's gonna say to build on what you can tell they just said to have a visual literacy in the in the reading audience is really important particularly when you're talking about photography and so many of these images have incredible messaging that is again below the level of awareness and to be able to pick apart the present not again that this very issue or many media outlets use imagery constantly we're awash in images that many people did not know how to read for that that kind of racist and orientalist messaging that's in things like angle of view or shadowing or again whether or not someone's represented with these tools of self-reflection like a mirror or camera I mean those are things I think we can we can expect media organizations to help do not just to leave it to academics to talk to each other about it or to try and educate their students about it but to have the media organization of themselves do that mm-hmm I agree and can I ask a question to both of you because obviously you're in the u.s. and I'm not but I I have a I have a theory or a hypothesis about why it's at this particular historical juncture with this particular president I love it because I understand that question do you believe ionian do you have your own hypotheses about why now and whose interests are served by doing this kind of very public apology not to say that it's a cynical ploy but to say that it comes from a place of some desperation in the u.s. sure I mean what I say is that you a person that Katherine you follow up one thing to say is that the race issue was in progress before Trump was elected president and I think that the historic moment that we're in precedes truck and if you look around the American landscape you find all sorts of institutions in the media in the church at universities corporations that are looking at their past many universities in the United States right now are looking at the role of slavery in the history of their universities many churches are making confessions about the role that they played in supporting segregation in the United States the New York Times is just started publishing a series of obituaries of women that they ignored when they had died I mean important significant historical figures whose deaths were ignored so this is a moment of reflection in American culture generally but it frankly it actually precedes Trump and I think that it might be more Obama in than it is trumpian but I absolutely agree with your point that confession is not enough right that that that one repents but then one pledges to do better in the future so the question now when a university or a magazine has said that we helped shape an oppressive racial climate well then what do you do about right what is what is the next step and and so the question will be for my university which is one of those universities that has acknowledged the role in slavery and the question will be for National Geographic what remedial steps do you take to change a social system that you were important in constructing an oppressive social system that you were important in constructing and Kathryn before yeah I'm consulate Catherine before you answer she can't allow this excellent question if I do say so myself I want to bring in this live comment that we got from from YouTube elamite says NatGeo confront its racist past how about the world confront its racist past not geo published magazines for Christ's sake and overall any racism was minimal compared to most publications at the time and apologies for using Christ's name like that's just reading out to the comment but Catherine you publisher book in 1993 why has it taken until this year to get that apology what do you think that has to do with well I think the National Geographic is a product they have they sell it to an audience that they have to please in certain ways and that the racism I think you're the person who's just written in is is right I mean it is we have to look at the audience that they're marketing to they help create the audience but the audience's racism particularly when it was an all-white readership which it was for many years a mainly white Otter readership we have to ask about whether they're doing this now making the apology now because they want a need or have a wider readership than they did and a readership that won't tolerate that same kind of treatment of people around the world people of color and and are asking for a more accurate and more just kind of representation of themselves and and people like them so I think that's that question of the market and how how the market is reshaping institutions like the geographic I mean if we don't have to be cynical to to recognize that but we we do need to say well that that helps us to see this relationship between the audience and it's racism which is you know not created entirely by the National Geographic it's rated by conflicts of interest by histories of colonialism and slavery and and those are very big issues to tackle in media itself mm-hmm can I just jump in with one point that we haven't raised which I feel very strongly about do I mean although I challenge representation I think there's absolutely no point having this conversation about the camera and what it produces unless we also have a conversation about who's behind the camera the producers and the owners of media and the narrowing field in which people are now cross media ownership means that the same platform the same game the same the same magazine might be owned by the same person with the same ideological output with this outlook with the same racist views and I think this is a very very dangerous thing and unless we have diversity in production you're never going to be able to change those mindsets and change those kinds of representations for company line ring you are you're the brain waves are the exact same level as our community members because as you said that I'm putting up this tweet from iw well - it's Nicola Hannah Jones she's a New York Times magazine reporter she writes into the stream what's the racial makeup of their staff contributors photographers that answers the question so John I wonder are there checks in place now do you think that there's enough to make sure that this style of coverage that we've been talking about from National Geographic no longer exists look I don't know the internal makeup of National Geographic I will say that in this particular issue this particular race issue you have photographers and writers of color who did extraordinary work and for me the challenge for National Geographic is now to assign these writers and these photographers to work on stories that have nothing to do with race you know there's no you know you don't want to compartmentalize these people that they can only work on race they can only work on what used to be called the Negro question you want them to be able to work on anything that their talents make them appropriate for and so we've shown that they can produce work and they can get it in on time on deadline let's let's broaden the range of writers and photographers and editors who are responsible for producing this magazine hmm so here's the headline once more these twins one black and one white will make you rethink race that is the premise there we've heard what our guests had to say about that but I'll in but this tweet from Allen who says it is not a perfect nor complete response to the depth of racism in our world but I genuinely think it will move the conversation forward and deeper and an honest and thoughtful way our thanks to John Edwin Mason Catherine Lutz and Shakuntala banaji for this conversation and of course our community continues online with hashtag AJ's dream thanks for being here you
