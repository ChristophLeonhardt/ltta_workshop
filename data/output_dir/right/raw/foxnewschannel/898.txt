1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:02,364
MOVE SAYING HE DID NOT KNOW THAT

2
00:00:02,364 --> 00:00:05,300
PAUL MANAFORT WAS HEAD OF THE

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,503
MOB AND ASKED WHAT ABOUT COMEY

4
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,405
AND CLINTON AND ALL THE OTHERS.

5
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:11,039
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,641
KIM JONG UN IS ALWAYS JUST A

7
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:13,575
PHONE CALL AWAY.

8
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:18,013
THE PRESIDENT TALKING MORE ABOUT

9
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:19,714
HIS SUMMIT WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

10
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:20,048
LEADER.

11
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,617
>> I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP

12
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,786
WITH KIM JONG UN.

13
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:26,588
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING.

14
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,623
I CAN NOW SAY, WE HAVE A

15
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:29,157
PROBLEM.

16
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:29,691
I TOLD HIM.

17
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:32,661
I GAVE HIM A VERY DIRECT NUMBER.

18
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,396
HE CAN NOW CALL ME IF HE HAS

19
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:34,829
DIFFICULTY.

20
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,200
OR I CAN CALL HIM.

21
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,367
WE HAVE COMMUNICATION.

22
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:42,170
>> BACK HOME AFTER THE SINGAPORE

23
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,371
SUMMIT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

24
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:46,374
TAKING A VICTORY LAP,

25
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,643
HIGHLIGHTING THE NEGOTIATION

26
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:51,179
AND, PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED THAT

27
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,682
TRUMP WAS GOING TO GET IN AND

28
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:57,252
START THROWING BOMBS ALL OVER

29
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:58,186
THE PLACE.

30
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:01,156
>> NOW CONVINCED HE IS DEFYING

31
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:09,664
HIS CRITICS EXPECTATIONS, AND,

32
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:12,133
HE SAID THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT

33
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:13,201
THE UNITED STATES HAS COME AND

34
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,604
BY FAR THE MOST DOMINANT MOST

35
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:16,705
DANGEROUS PROBLEM, AND AT WHAT

36
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:19,941
HE SAID TO ME THAT WE EVER HAD,

37
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,042
IS NORTH KOREA.

38
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:23,778
>> OWN SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

39
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:25,080
ECHOES THAT SENTIMENT JUST A FEW

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,680
HOURS AGO.

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,816
>> THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO

42
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:30,185
DEFINE THE FUTURE.

43
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:37,025
BUT WHILE A POSSIBLE NEW AVENUE,

44
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,561
WE REMAIN VIGILANT IN PURSUIT OF

45
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:39,894
WEAPONS.

46
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:41,496
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ALSO TAKEN

47
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:45,834
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFLECT BLAME

48
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:46,301
ON HIS NEMESIS.

49
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,036
>> WHEN IT'S MY FAULT I WILL

50
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,437
TELL YOU.

51
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:50,105
PRESIDENT OBAMA BY NOT GOING

52
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,673
ACROSS THE REDLINE IN THE SAND

53
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:55,043
THAT HE DREW, I WENT ACROSS IT

54
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:57,445
WITH THE 59 MISSILE HITS.

55
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:59,414
BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE

56
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:00,982
DIDN'T GO ACROSS THE REDLINE,

57
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:03,652
WHAT HE GAVE AWAY, NOBODY EVEN

58
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:04,052
KNOWS.

59
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,687
>> BUT ACCORDING TO

60
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:06,755
PRESIDENT TRUMP, OBAMA IS NOT

61
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,257
ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NUCLEAR

62
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:12,727
PROGRAM AND THE SYRIAN WAR.

63
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:20,368
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA LOST CRIMEA,

64
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:22,871
LOST CRIMEA.

65
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:28,376
>> IN HIS EYES, KIM JONG UN

66
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:28,810
DOESN'T HAVE.

67
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,847
>> I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE

68
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:33,448
SAME.

69
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,716
SOMEONE WHO DEFINITELY ADMIRES

70
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:36,217
KIM'S LEADERSHIP STYLE IS

71
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:37,385
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

72
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:40,221
HE ISSUED A WARM INVITATION FOR

73
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:41,156
KIM TO VISIT RUSSIA JUST

74
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:41,623
YESTERDAY.

75
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:42,590
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED

76
00:02:42,590 --> 00:00:00,000
