A REMARKABLE DAY.

8
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:12,165
BRETT KAVANAUGH JUST STEPPED

9
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:13,366
AWAY FROM THE MICROPHONE IN

10
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,235
THE SENATE HEARING ROOM.

HOURS THERE.

13
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:19,272
IT WAS A REMARKABLE MOMENT.

14
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:20,740
STUNNING IN MANY WAYS LIKE

15
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,841
WITHOUT PRECEDENT AND

16
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,743
LIFETIMES OF MANY WHO WATCHED

17
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:24,077
IT.

18
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:25,445
UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON,

19
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:26,546
KAVANAUGH HAD STRUCK MANY WHO

20
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:28,648
WATCHED HIM AS BOOKISH AND

21
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:29,048
ACADEMIC.

22
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,750
THE CLASSIC TEMPER AMOUNT OF A

23
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,951
FEDERAL JUDGE.

24
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:36,189
BUT HE EMERGED TRANSFORMED.

25
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,557
A MAN ON FIRE, FIGHTING WITH

26
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:38,758
EVERYTHING TO SAVE HIS FAMILY,

27
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,193
HIMSELF AND THE PRESUMPTION OF

28
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:40,560
INNOCENCE.

29
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,861
KAVANAUGH BEGAN THE TESTIMONY

30
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:46,366
WITH AN UNEQUIVOCAL DENIAL OF

31
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:47,166
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM.

32
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,802
I DID NOT SEXUALLY ASSAULT

33
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:50,837
CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD OR ANYONE

34
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:53,406

"THE ALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE."

37
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:00,547

38
00:01:00,547 --> 00:01:03,917
RESPONSE AND AIMED IT AT

39
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,351

HAS BECOME A NATIONAL

DISGRACE.

43
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:09,289
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE

45
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:14,794
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS.

46
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:17,363

47
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:20,366
AND CONCEPT WITH SEARCH AND

48
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,168
DESTROY.

49

SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY,

50
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,605

THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER

56
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,416
SAID HE WOULD, "OPPOSE ME WITH

THINK ABOUT THAT WORD.

63
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,865
AND SAID THOSE WHO SUPPORTED

64
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:56,303

CAREFULLY TO YOU.

HAVE BEEN WILLING TO DO

00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:39,112
ANYTHING.

HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND AN

108

ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT.

AND THE 2016 ELECTION.

AROUND COMES AROUND.

135
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:23,517

THAT IS COMING.

140

BUT TODAY, I HAVE TO SAY THAT

141
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:38,232
I FEAR FOR THE FUTURE.

148
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,978
HAD PRAYED FOR HER IN ONE OF

149
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:52,313
THE MOST RIVETTING MOMENTS OF

150
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:52,747

00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:36,584
NEVER.

193
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:37,819
>> Tucker: DEMOCRATS IN THE

194
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,387
ROOM SEEMED STUNNED BY

195
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,822
KAVANAUGH'S REMARKS AND FOR A

196
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:41,890
MOMENT THEY SEEMED THROWN BACK

197
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,791
ON THEIR HEELS.

198
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:43,992
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

199
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:44,893
RANKING MEMBER DIANNE

200
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:45,694
FEINSTEIN BEGAN THE

201
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:46,494
QUESTIONING FOR DEMOCRATS.

202
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:47,896
SHE SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT

203
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:50,065
KAVANAUGH WAS SECRETLY A

204
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,366
SEXUAL PREDATOR.

205
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,301
READING FROM A SCRIPT SHE

206
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,503
REFERRED TO A WOMAN CALLED

207
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:56,238
JULIE SWETNICK, COLLEGE

208
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:57,639
STUDENT IN SUBURBAN WASHINGTON

209
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,607
WHEN BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS IN

210
00:06:58,607 --> 00:06:59,174
HIGH SCHOOL.

211
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,642
YESTERDAY AS WE TOLD YOU,

212
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:01,676
SWETNICK CLAIMED THAT SHE

213
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,011
WITNESSED AT LEAST TEN PUBLIC

214
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,679
GANG RAPES IN WHICH BRETT

215
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:08,917
KAVANAUGH WAS SUPPOSEDLY

216
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,386
PRESENT AND PARTICIPATING.

217
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:12,187
REMARKABLE CHARGE.

218
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,588
FEINSTEIN NEVER MENTIONED THAT

219
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:14,923
PART OF SWETNICK'S CLAIM.

220
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:15,790
WHY IS THAT?

221
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,492
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

222
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:18,593
IT CLASHES WITH COMMON SENSE

223
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:19,694
AND IT'S LUNATIC.

224
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:20,795
NOBODY BELIEVES THAT.

225
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:21,696
FEINSTEIN LEFT THAT PART OUT

226
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,431
IN ORDER TO SMEAR KAVANAUGH IN

227
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,300
FRONT OF THE WORLD AND OMITTED

228
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,334
HIGHLY RELEVANT INFORMATION

229
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,702
ABOUT HIS ACCUSER.

230
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,571
INDEED THE ENTIRE ACCUSATION.

231
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,807
IT WAS REPREHENSIBLY DISHONEST

232
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:33,942
BEHAVIOR, ESPECIALLY FOR A

233
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:34,576
U.S. SENATOR.

234
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,845
KAVANAUGH ALL BUT SAID SO.

235
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,948
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING

236
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,650
THE EVIDENCE AND HAVING THE

237
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,985
EVIDENCE LOOKED AT.

238
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:49,191
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU

239
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:53,262
KNOW, WE HEAR FROM THE

240
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,396
WITNESSES.

241
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,198
BUT THE F.B.I. ISN'T

242
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:57,332
INTERVIEWING THEM AND ISN'T

243
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,467
GIVING US ANY FACTS.

244
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,835
SO ALL WE HAVE.

245
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,169
>> YOU'RE INTERVIEWING ME.

246
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,504
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING ME.

247
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:03,705
YOU'RE DOING IT, SENATOR.

248
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:05,173
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT YOU

249
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:06,608
ARE DOING IT.

250
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,944
THERE IS NO CONCLUSIONS

251
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,378
REACHED.

252
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:12,080
>> WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IF I

253
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,915
UNDERSTAND IT, IS THAT THE

254
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:20,188
ALLEGATIONS BY DR. FORD,

255
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:22,324
MS. RAMIREZ, AND MS. SWETNICK

256
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:22,991
ARE WRONG.

257
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,493
>> THAT IS EMPHATICALLY WHAT

258
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:27,196
I'M SAYING.

259
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,230
EMPHATICALLY.

260
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,232
THE SWETNICK THING IS A JOKE.

261
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:33,902
THAT IS A FARCE.

262
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:34,970
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY MORE

263
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,339
ABOUT IT?

264
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:37,740
>> NO.

265
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,607
>> Tucker: IT WAS A SURREAL

266
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:38,974
MOMENT.

267
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:40,576
THE DAY WAS FILLED WITH THOSE.

268
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:42,644
AT TIMES THE HYPOCRISY LEVEL

269
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:43,946
GOT SO HIGH YOU WONDERED HOW

270
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,147
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM COULD

271
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:45,481
BREATHE.

272
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:48,183
THERE WAS THE ONLY SENATOR

273
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:50,786
FROM NEW JERSEY A MAN WHO ONCE

274
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:52,521
ADMITTED MOLESTING A GIRL IN

275
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,289
HIGH SCHOOL SIT THERE ACCUSING

276
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,891
SOMEONE ELSE OF MOLESTING A

277
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,459
GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

278
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:58,527
>> THERE ARE DOCK ELEMENTS

279
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:02,231
THAT ALLOW UNCONSCIONABLE

280
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:03,599
LEVEL OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

281
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:03,999
HARASSMENT.

282
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,035
YOU ARE OPENING UP TO OPEN AIR

283
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,703
HURT AND PAIN THAT GOES ON

284
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:08,871
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

285
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:15,144
IF YOU WERE SPEAKING TRUTH,

286
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,478
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO

287
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:16,946
UNDERSTAND.

288
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:17,880
>> Tucker: IT WOULD BE

289
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,182
INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT THE

290
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:23,719
GIRL CORY BOOKER SAYS MOLESTED

291
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,220
SPEAK HER TRUTH.

292
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,222
WE EAGERLY AWAIT THAT

293
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:29,091
TESTIMONY, HOPEFULLY SOON.

294
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:29,825
BLOODLESS SENATOR FROM

295
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,227
CONNECTICUT WHO LIED ABOUT

296
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,862
SERVING IN VIETNAM TRIED TO

297
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:34,196
IMPUGN ANOTHER MAN'S

298
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:34,630
INTEGRITY.

299
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,298
>> FALSE IN ONE THING, FALSE

300
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:37,099
IN EVERYTHING.

301
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:39,936
MEANING IN JURY INSTRUCTIONS

302
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,537
THAT SOME OF US AS PROSECUTORS

303
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,641
HEARD MANY TIMES, IS TOLD A

304
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,643
JURY THAT THEY CAN DISBELIEVE

305
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,244
A WITNESS IF THEY FIND HIM TO

306
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:51,014
BE FALSE IN ONE THING.

307
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:53,349
SO THE CORE OF WHY WE ARE HERE

308
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:58,488
TODAY REALLY IS CREDIBILITY.

309
00:09:58,488 --> 00:09:59,722
>> THE CORE OF WHY WE ARE HERE

310
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:02,892
IS THE ALLEGATION OF THE FOUR

311
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:03,860
WITNESSES PRESENT SAID IT

312
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,360
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

313
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,395
>> Tucker: FALSE IN ONE

314
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:06,696
THING, FALSE IN MANY THINGS.

315
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:09,065
IF YOU ARE SENATOR BLUMENTHAL

316
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:09,966
CAN YOU IMAGINE SAYING

317
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:10,800
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

318
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,502
WHAT KIND OF LOOK OF

319
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:13,436
SELF-AWARENESS WOULD IT TAKE

320
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:14,871
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

321
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:15,305
REMARKABLE.

322
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:16,906
UNDERNEATH ALL OF THIS,

323
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:18,074
THOUGH, HUNG THE MOST OBVIOUS

324
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:20,176
QUESTION OF THE DAY WHICH

325
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:21,711
NOBODY ASKED OUT LOUD.

326
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,379
WHO DID THIS TO CHRSTINE

327
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,781
BLASEY FORD?

328
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,282
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY HELD THE

329
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,050
HEARINGS FOR HER.

330
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,685
IT WAS DEMOCRATS WHO LEAKED

331
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:29,986
HER NAME TO PRESS AGAINST HER

332
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:33,022
WISHES AND DRAGGED HER IN THE

333
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:33,389
MAELSTROM.

334
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,090
WHO DID IS THAT?

335
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,391
LIKELY SOMEONE IN DIANNE

336
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,092
FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE.

337
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:37,760
FEINSTEIN CLAIMS SHE WAS

338
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,127
INVOLVED.

339
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:39,329
SHE WOULD LIKE THE PRESUMPTION

340
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,263
OF INNOCENCE ON THAT.

341
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:40,697
OKAY.

342
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,732
SO WHO WAS IT?

343
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:43,800
IF YOU CARE ABOUT CHRSTINE

344
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,002
BLASEY FORD AND ABOUT ALL

345
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,337
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, YOU

346
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:48,438
WOULD BE ANXIOUS TO KNOW.

347
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,906
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A NEW

348
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:50,807
INVESTIGATION IN THAT.

349
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,876
REPUBLICANS COULD START ONE

350
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:53,309
IMMEDIATELY.

351
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:54,010
LIKE TOMORROW.

352
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,445
WOULD DEMOCRATS PARTICIPATE IN

353
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:56,646
AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT

354
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,582
WHO LEAKED FORD'S NAME NO THE

355
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:00,016
PRESS?

356
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:00,750
PROBABLY NOT.

357
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,951
THEY SEEM STRIKINGLY

358
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:04,487
UNINTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT

359
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:05,054
CHRISTINE FORD TODAY.

360
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:06,756
THEY RARELY ASKED ABOUT HER

361
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,191
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH ON THE

362
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:08,591
SET.

363
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,160
INSTEAD THEY PEPPERED HIM

364
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,264
ABOUT THE GEORGETOWN PREP

365
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:15,999
YEARBOOK AND HOW MUCH BEER HE

366
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:16,699
DRANK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

367
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:17,066
COLLEGE.

368
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,034
THIS IS ONE OF HIS RESPONSES

369
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,302
TO THE LINE OF QUESTIONING.

370
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:22,539
>> I NEVER SEXUAL ASSAULTED

371
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:22,872
ANYONE.

372
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:25,208
THERE IS A BRIGHT LINE BETWEEN

373
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,809
DRINKING BEER WHICH I GLADLY

374
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:31,014
DO, AND WHICH I FULLY EMBRACE,

375
00:11:31,014 --> 00:11:31,815
AND SEXUAL ASSAULTING SOMEONE

376
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:34,818
WHICH IS A VIOLENT CRIME.

377
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,486
IF EVERY AMERICAN WHO DRINKS

378
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,956
BEER OR EVERY AMERICAN WHO

379
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,291
DRANK BEER IN HIGH SCHOOL IS

380
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,561
SUDDENLY RESUMED GUILTY OF

381
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,096
SEXUAL ASSAULT, IT WILL BE AN

382
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,364
UGLY NEW PLACE IN THIS

383
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:47,731
COUNTRY.

384
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:51,268
I NEVER COMMITTED SEXUAL

385
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:51,701
ASSAULT.

386
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:52,936
>> Tucker: WHEN THEY WERE

387
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,037
DEMANDING ANSWERS ABOUT THE

388
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,839
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK DEMOCRATS

389
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,706
STALLED FOR TIME.

390
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:58,542
THEY DID THAT TO TRY TO GET

391
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,376
ANOTHER F.B.I. INVESTIGATION

392
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,112
INTO KAVANAUGH.

393
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:05,749
>> WHY AREN'T YOU ALSO ASKING

394
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:06,983
THE F.B.I. TO INVESTIGATE THE

395
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:07,417
CLAIMS?

396
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,085
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WILL YOU

397
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:09,719
SUPPORT AN F.B.I.

398
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,588
INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW?

399
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:14,157
>> YOU COULD ACTUALLY JUST GET

400
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:15,792
THIS OPEN SO WE CAN TALK TO

401
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:16,593
THESE WITNESSES.

402
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,028
AND THE F.B.I. CAN DO IT

403
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,964
INSTEAD OF US.

404
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,032
>> ARE YOU WILLING TO ASK THE

405
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:26,603
WHITE HOUSE TO AUTHORIZE THE

406
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:27,638
F.B.I. TO INVESTIGATE CLAIMS

407
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:29,473
MADE AGAINST YOU?

408
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:30,340
>> Tucker: AN F.B.I.

409
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,907
INVESTIGATION SOUNDS

410
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:31,308
REASONABLE.

411
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,043
I WOULD BE THE SEVENTH F.B.I.

412
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,511
INVESTIGATION THAT HAS LOOKED

413
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,046
DEEPLY INTO BRETT KAVANAUGH'S

414
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,214
PERSONAL CONDUCT.

415
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,682
HE WAS ONCE STAFF SECRETARY TO

416
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:39,516
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

417
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:41,218
AND HAD THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

418
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:41,952
SECURITY CLEARANCE THIS

419
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:43,854
COUNTRY GIVES.

420
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:46,390
ONE THAT GAVE HIM ACCESS TO

421
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,157
THE AMERICA NUCLEAR CODES.

422
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:48,225
HE GOT THAT CLEARANCE BECAUSE

423
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,326
THE F.B.I. SPOKE AT LENGTH TO

424
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:51,261
A CROSS SECTION OF EVERYONE HE

425
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:52,329
HAD EVERY MET GOING BACK TO

426
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,397
HIGH SCHOOL OR EARLIER AND

427
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,565
THERE WERE NO HINT OF SEXUAL

428
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:54,998
ASSAULTS.

429
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:55,499
NONE.

430
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,767
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO

431
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:57,334
INVESTIGATE HERE.

432
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:57,868
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

433
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,604
THIS IS A POLITICAL TACTIC AND

434
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:01,572
IT'S DISINGENUOUS.

435
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,273
WHY ARE THEY DOING IT?

436
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:03,807
SIMPLE.

437
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:06,343
DEMOCRATS KNOW IF THE VOTE ON

438
00:13:06,343 --> 00:13:08,212
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS HELD SOON

439
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:09,446
HE WILL BE CONFIRMED.

440
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,448
IF IT'S DELAYED BY POINTLESS

441
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:13,617
F.B.I. INVESTIGATIONS DEMANDED

442
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:14,952
BY DEMAGOGUES IN BAD FAITH HE

443
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,453
WILL NOT BE CONFIRMED BECAUSE

444
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:19,690
THE ACCUSATIONS WILL NEVER

445
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,057
END.

446
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,026
THE INCENTIVE TO MADE THEM IS

447
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:22,526
TOO STRONG.

448
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,695
YOU WILL SEE ANONYMOUS CLAIMS

449
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,997
HE LED GANG RAPES ON SAILBOATS

450
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,832
IN RHODE ISLAND OR WHEREVER.

451
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:31,802
AND THE STANDARD OF JUSTICE

452
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,137
WILL DEGRADE.

453
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,705
WITH THE HELP OF THE

454
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:35,105
CONFERENCE.

455
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,907
THE DEMOCRATS RETAIN POWER AND

456
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,175
THAT IS THE POINT.

457
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,410
THE ONLY POINT OF ALL OF THIS.

458
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,812
BUT FOR NOW UNTIL AND IF THAT

459
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,081
HAPPENS NO REPUBLICAN SENATOR

460
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,850
WHO WATCHED KAVANAUGH TESTIFY

461
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,951
TODAY ARE LIKED TO VOTE

462
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,451
AGAINST HIM.

463
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,719
THOSE WHO DID WOULD BE

464
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,655
PUNISHED BY VOTERS.

465
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,257
MANY VOTERS AT HOME WEPT AS

466
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:56,293
THEY WATCHED KAVANAUGH

467
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:56,661
TESTIFY.

468
00:13:56,661 --> 00:14:02,099
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN

469
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,703
ACCUSED WRONGLY KNOW WELL THE

470
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,805
EMOTION ON HIS FACE.

471
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,206
PROVE YOU DIDN'T DO IT OR

472
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:10,641
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE BE TAKEN

473
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,542
AWAY FROM YOU.

474
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,511
HE CAME AS CLOSE AS HE COULD

475
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,512
TO CLEAR HIS NAME.

476
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:15,813
HE DIDN'T GET HELP FROM THE

477
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,648
REPUBLICANS OTHER THAN LINDSEY

478
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,015
GRAHAM.

479
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:19,717
THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE FALSELY

480
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,185
ACCUSED OF A CRIME DON'T ASK

481
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:22,019
THEM FOR A BACKUP.

482
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,421
KAVANAUGH DID IT HIMSELF.

483
00:14:23,421 --> 00:00:00,000
HE HAD NO CHOICE.
