instead of using normal courts and getting normal warrants since 2015 US Intel agencies have been spying on journalists by using a special secret court setup for Intel purposes well civil liberties advocates have long suspected secret FISA Court orders may be used and abused to conduct surveillance and journalists the government to our knowledge has never acknowledged that they have even contemplated doing so the FISA program which has special courts set up for monitoring emails phone calls and personal communications can monitor media entities or known members of the media now basically this means that with the Attorney General's approval any journalists or other individuals suspected of being a foreign agent can be spied on simply the suspicion that a journalist might possess foreign intelligence info is enough this puts key sources in danger national security surveillance authorities conferring strawed inori powers the government's failure to send more information about them damages journalists ability to protect their sources and jeopardizes the news gathering process with an approved warrant the government can do electronic surveillance physical searches and go through business records to name a few it's a pretty broad stroke and how hard is it to get a FISA warrant approved well last year there were 1614 applications only 26 of them were denied that's less than 2% the FISA Court is a rubber-stamp Court it approves something like 99% of government requests the judges often come out of the government they are simply agents of a mass surveillance apparatus and so basically what the government has done is give itself cover to monitor reporters domestically this all started under the administration of Barack Obama when spying on journalists turned into an epic scandal the rules were rewritten and at that point everyone was reassured that due process was being followed but it seems they found a new loophole it hypothetically theoretically provides the basis for government officials including president to obtain the private communications of reporters operating domestically any US reporter can be surveilled under the guidelines that have been revealed through this Department of Justice memo now no one can say how many times if at all journalists were spied on using the FISA program that's the wild thing about FISA courts not only are the privacy rights of journalists violated but they'll have no idea that it ever happened Kalib Maupin RT New York you
