start calling me Oh Gauri slap in a way it's like the refuse point like to call it a racial attack some of you made us may have seen a viral photos that went online this week the young lady I'm here with Nicki now can you tell us what happened to you 24 days ago and I were a solid by three Asian let's smash me into a Yantra storm while down it just welcome back from test scores will be a breakfast dish out at your white girl gives a light and I said I ain't gonna love it I carried on walking and then the start calling me Oh Gauri slap in a way it's like means white gouache met I woke up holding my weight bigs happened that fast didn't even have time to break me fall I've got ya I think it's about that five five five inch - cross my head you could see me yeah miss Cole I've got 20 21 stitches on outside and 38 are far ta taan inside dissolving stitches on the inside so you rang the police from the scene when you when you come around well a lady did she see me coming from under tunnel and way it down there five - five five minutes what please to come didn't come and you're walking on myself got nearly our wheel and met me in that car park back of meows okay so the police met you at the back your house you've explained them what's happened it's been a racist attack you've been violently being since then 24 days ago what contact if you had were the police non face-to-face of them I've received a couple of messages from PC Joyce it was meant to be investigating officer it's not still unmet and saying to me that she's investigating but she's not willing to take a statement cuz I've got ID people it is and there's pretty much all of it they haven't took any written statement for you to give any information about the men you saw I think and up until you put those photos online what was the police contact then none non-existent until me partner got in touch and I think it about two and a half week later he got in touch we am a police officer called sarah back and she's like we know community appalachian all that working with ink she said she saw a couple days later I received a phone call from that PC Joyce and that's when she told me that she she weren't willing to waste their time or my time taking a statement I've got an idea the people but she will make inquiries what about taking photographs of you injuries the come out day after took three but apparently they got lost in black holes they were her words again misstatement in the in the file you know about the incident that had been lost in black hole she said lost exact words it had been lost in black hole this didn't hit the press it didn't hit any media just so everyone knows it was in no papers it was on no news there was no witness appeal the first thing the police should have done off this is a massive witness appeal but there was nothing the first time I hit the papers was because Nikki shared the photos and said how outraged she was because she's been a victim of a racist attack and nothing's been done in three weeks now if I read you what the police say Detective Inspector mark Atkinson of Kirkley CID said this was a terrible Winston and one which left the victim of severe serious injuries we have been in regular contact with her to enable us to investigate the instant fully lies not mean regular contact all never first time the contact is were to I'd say in days two weeks so I'd say about 1718 days afterwards and that's when they said the comment about the the file had been lost in black holes bearing in mind a young English girl has been severely beaten in such an attack this is the appeal this now just for one minute if you're watching this reverse the roles for a minute imagine a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and violently beat him by free young white men and faced injuries like these do you know who would be sitting here now with you having with the media the leader of the police force your local politician everyone be here speaking to cameras across the country tell them they will find them in this do a few appointments call it a racial attack they were saying that I had no right to call it that because we couldn't say that that's what it was and until the finally today and exactly what it was on Friday just gone in a text message so until Friday we're not treating this as a race hate crime from the start you told them the names again yeah from start yeah from very beginning but the point-blank refused it actually really that they start giving us me a partner a bit of a chilled for saying that you know it was saying that if it were vice-versa it would it got a totally different and they were saying that they could we couldn't say that that we couldn't we say it and they were down to race even though they'll calling me a why it's lagging and stuff like that so do you think this is they've tried to just avoid this completely in their if you hadn't put the pictures out this would has been completely I feel like I think it's been investigating no I don't to be quite honest we I feel like that there were really really open it if they just kept quiet and get bad I don't believe for one minute from the partner got in touch with him to find out why they'd nobody'd been out for a statement I don't believe that they would have actually got back in touch with me myself it was worth one minute didn't the men reveal life would like me lies worthless to be honest what would you say if I told you that the inspector in charge of this police force his name's Mohammed well I ever told you the neighborhood supports item for this police force is also called moment do you think that's anything to avoid this hasn't been investigated rounding that just will not the doesn't know when it comes to Muslim you know nobody says when it comes to what the work you do not want to upset them in in any way shape or form bit so in this local area cuz I know we spoke earlier do you know any other women who have been attacked yeah there's another white last night she got weak today in a week to the day they happened to me and they don't seem to wear but they are stare frame for the sake that's me from like they are stare for his sake and which actually managed to get away is that been reported no of but is down to fact that where we were speaking about in exact way as well what's point that's how people feel ice all over the country how many victims have wholly unlike you do you know about so much the part of a Facebook and stuff and it's it was so like it would overwhelm a nice because I didn't I got to point where I feel like that much a big deals you know I mean and then they want to look at me face and it yeah yeah when I saw your photos when I saw your photos it shocked the hell out me as a female was a lady keep saying to me partner did you think I'm being a bit melodramatic I think I'm being a bit prophetic about it but it's easily when you see me for I don't think I am you know I'm gonna ask you to I'm I'm gonna ask you we're gonna set up a web and a justice campaign view justice for Nikki we're set up and we'll get a petition going and I'm gonna find Muhammad Ralph who's your top police officer I want to find him if you're willing to come with me or one you'd find the website for this we've got justice for Nikki calm I'm gonna ask you people don't think this matters when

and we'll do everything and I'm sure the public watching this is going to everything they can to make sure you get justice and there you get help and support changing and you put it's just nice to see it's nice to see that surprise notice because I felt I could I felt I could innovate to be honest and I felt I could didn't have it from people that I should have read the people that get paid I think
