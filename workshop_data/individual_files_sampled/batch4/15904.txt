you don't have to love Doug Ford but you have to vote for him it's really very simple because the old there is no alternative well we're just standing outside the Robin Martin office she's a candidate for the PCs for the Eglinton Laurens riding really a tumultuous time in political history right now for intere you had Kathleen Wynne on Saturday saying she'll step down this premier and now we have news about a lawsuit from Renata Ford against Doug Ford and his brother Randy Ford and we're right now awaiting the arrival of Doug Ford and hopefully we'll get some of his response to what's going on stay tuned yesterday of course was that bombshell announcement about this family feud going to the courts filed by renee afford nothing's been proven in court of course but do you think this kind of an issue moves the needle at all when it comes to Ford supporters in reality I would think that anyone who really is thinking would wonder why would somebody release this kind of a bombshell three days before the election well I find it really interesting that's over the last two years issues that should be settled in the public court seem to be taken into the public arena before it goes to court at the most detrimental time so one of the parties my question with regards to all of it is the timing for three days to a provincial election no Doug four is running for a premier and the fact that this is coming out at this time it just says that there's another agenda behind it all do you feel like it's like a shakedown given the timing I would say so you know it's very suspicious I think it's just another trick and we don't we don't listen to such gossip because it's just another claim and anybody can say anything I mean anybody can call me beautiful okay and it's just a clue you're beautiful it's just a claim though we haven't proved it yet because I'm single guys suddenly we're cupid come here who's a lawyer who is the lawyer sir I don't know that would be my first question I've heard rumors that the the law the lawyers representing ran out of order are aligned with Patrick Brown's sister so that kind of puts question mark on a couple of things I'm not so sure if that's verified or not do you think that the public these days just collectively shrug their shoulders and goes on with who they were supporting or does it affect an outcome you know honestly I I think it has a lot to do with who the people are and and why they're voting for who they're voting for my position is you don't have to love Doug Ford but you have to vote for him it's really very simple because the old there is no alternative you have Kathleen Wynne who speaks a great game and has done nothing but put us into very serious debt spent us into a scenario that is so dangerous got us downgraded and then you have Andrea Horvath who has a bunch of crazies as far as I'm concerned the media is is throwing a lot of a lot of accusations around about Doug for in the PC party and I don't think the people of Ontario are falling for it I think it's a time for innocent until proved guilty if mr. Ford has an issue they has to pay up for and they'll have to pay up he's like every other human being we really don't care either way you know like like really what I care about is you know it's my kids gonna have a feasible job you know we we grew up we had cars we had jobs we had houses we worked for them nobody gave it to us but now we're just being you know kicked kicked aside and thrown out and are you know there's no manufacturing and if these people get in again we're done for friends we are ready to govern we're excited and a couple days left and we will be able to turn this province around and once again make this the engine of Canada hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new amp please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
