Mike Pompeo is the person who keeps going back and forth negotiating with North Korean officials and these talks are allegedly and reportedly going nowhere and so Pompeyo was unaware of some of the negative commentary coming from these North Korean officials when he was approached by reporters about how things are going so we're going to show you the video featuring what he told reporters but keep in mind that a spokesman of Pyongyang's foreign ministry said we had expected the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders summit we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures however the attitude and stance of the United States showed in the first high-level meeting between the countries was no doubt regrettable so they said that they talked about how you know the US has been gang-like in the way that they've treated these talks and before Mach might Mike Pompeo got word of what they had been saying here is his version of how these talks have been going take a look many hours of productive conversations these are complicated issues but we made progress on almost all of the essential issues some places a great deal of progress other place there's still more work to be done then he hears about how North Korea is referring to the u.s. tactic tactics as gangster-like and then he changed his tone a little bit take a look I am counting on Chairman Kim to be determined to follow through on the commitment that he made and so if those requests were gangster-like there that the world is a gangster because there was a unanimous decision at the UN Security Council about what needs to be achieved but there wasn't really a unanimous decision you see what I'm saying like there was there was a lack of clarity in regard to what North Korea was going to do there was no specificity in what North Korea was to do in this negotiation or in this agreement finally one quick part that I found a little entertaining Pompeyo spent the night in a hotel in North Korea right this is during the talks and so kim gyeong-cheol kind of talked about whether or not Pompeyo was sleeping comfortably after these talks take a look so so look that's super weird and when I read it I was like what is what what kind of stupid gamesmanship or the North Koreans playing here but now I'm being me to think that maybe that was some sort of coded language now that I saw it on video because Pompeo and senior American leaders had never stayed in North Korea overnight before this time they do did they bug his room did they know something that he did last night it was creepy there was definitely something creepy about that exchange I was amused by it just because it was unlike anything we've ever seen before and I was curious to see on video what Pompeii was reaction would be and I think he handled it final totally so I actually have two things where I think we should be fair to Pompeo against sentences I never thought I'd speak is he's right-wing a total super militaristic does not believe in separation of church and state so I don't want you to get me confused Pompeyo is a terrible guy okay and but in this case one I gotta give him credit for that great line then the world's a gangster okay maybe we see that on the soundboard I kind of like that one okay now in all seriousness the the thing that we have to be fair to him about is he stuck between two idiots right who can't keep their word at all more importantly one is Kim jong-un and others Donald Trump so Donald Trump comes out and says we solved it they're gonna denuclearize well Pompeyo can't say that's true because is not true but he can't say it's not true because then Trump will yell at right then kim jeong-hoon comes in and goes I can't believe you're doing this gangster like demand for denuclearization he's like what do you read no that was the whole point of the negotiations is for you to denuclearize so but if he's super harsh still send him home because they're all so thin thin skins yes but if he's not suit appropriately harsh enough or doesn't push back then Trump's going to be mad and ending and you're gonna lose face in the negotiations so he's in an incredibly tough spot between a hard-headed guy in a rock filled brain and you pick him on which one is Kim jong-un which one is Donald Trump but they're both totally stubborn pathological liars so it's nearly an impossible position to be in so Pompeo hasn't had success but I really don't think that he's the one at fault for that it's the two leaders two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you are notified of our videos
