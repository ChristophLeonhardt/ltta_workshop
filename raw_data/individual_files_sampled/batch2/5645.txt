whereas hearing dr. ford submitted prepared remarks to the committee in which he details the incident when Cavanaugh and his friend assaulted her she says quote I believe he was going to rape me I tried to yell for help when I did Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming this was what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life she goes on to say I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all the questions that have been it that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party where it took place and so forth I don't have all the answers the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget they have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult well we're back with our panel Jonathan Lemire you me shall sender Mike Murphy and f√°tima Gus graves let me go to Mike Murphy you were trying to ask the question would go for it your statement oh no I was I'm just I'm pushing back a little bit on the whole concept of anonymous accusations I mean the women who were brave enough and it's incredibly difficult to come forward ought to be respected and ought to be heard but I've been in politics for thirty years and I know that an anonymous accusation that instantly gets sprayed over the media and instantly believed by a lot of people can often come close to a smear so well it's difficult I would encourage whoever sent the letter in to the gardener the staff in Colorado that they owe it to the country in the process to come forward and share horrible are you thinking he's every probably clapping it was leaked not efficient officially released I think I'm not sure I just saw it before we went on the air but for that to be considered seriously and it might have to be I think the accuser has to come forward my team at one thing and you're the expert on this unfortunately there has to be experts because this happens there's such a pattern to this latest thing and anything could be untrue but all these four cases now seem to suggest a guy who drank a lot especially in his teenage years 17 to 18 into into Yale freshman year and then further now with this latest evidence back as recently as 20 years ago 99 when he's a full-grown adult and calm regular person who women liked respected women throw all the right things in the office but when he had a few too many he became this other guy that's all the reporting one of the things that we know is that sometimes people can present one way with a set of people their friends their families at work and very differently with other people and that's one of the things we've had to come to grips with over the last year with the me2 movement as more and more people whose conduct has come finally to light so if there was an FBI investigation or any sort of serious neutral investigation they would be asking questions of the people around them who knew them then they'd be asking what their behavior was like winning was wrong that's a great thing we keep getting petitions from dozens and dozens of people say nicest guy in the world who's right who's putting together these petitions that you're also getting actually on the record under penalty of perjury people saying this account happened I'm willing to take a lot of risk and Mike talked about why are people doing some anonymous once where you see what has happened this sort of bullying and shaming and blaming of people who've actually come out on the record I'm I'm so grateful that Christine Blasi Ford is actually coming and showing up tomorrow even after she has been smeared by the President of the United States and everyone else over the last week the treaters day missions that are doing I'm terrified it's powerful and she has a lot of people who were standing with her but it's gonna be tough and prepared remarks which he is scheduled to deliver tomorrow judge Cavanaugh described his time in high school writing I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics sports church and service but I was not perfect in those days just as I am not perfect today I drank beer with my friends usually on weekends sometimes I had too many when it comes after he said this on Fox the other night was there ever a time that you drank so much that you couldn't remember what happened the night before no that never happened I was focused on trying to be number one in my class and being captain of the varsity basketball team in doing my service projects going to church the vast majority of time I spent in high school was studying or focused on sports according to the Washington Post that choirboy image dis heard does not match the description of some who knew cabinet at the time according to one woman we told the post she was friends with the cabinet in college and drank with him cabinet was a sloppy drunk and drank more than a lot of people he'd end up slurring his words stumbling it's not credible for him to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to excess let me go to you Mitch you know in the Watergate days I remember the phrase limited modified hangout will you admit everything short of criminality so he says I drank a lot of beer I said things I cringe at today but I didn't commit any crimes it seems like he's protected there's some print prevented defense here getting ready pre-gaming the fact there will be a lot of testimony like this well Brett Kavanagh has also said that he didn't do any of this sexually inappropriate behavior because he was a virgin during high school and many years after so there's this idea that president that Brett Kavanaugh was really crafting this image of himself and saying look at all the things that I've accomplished the issue of course is that all the women who have accused him or at least two or three of the women that have accuse him are very very credible women who have had Federal jobs who have had to go through clearances or if I've talked to people who are close with Professor Ford and they say so this is someone who's a psychologist who's very smart who understands what it means to remember things and that wouldn't make up false accusations just out of nowhere so while Brett Kavanaugh is saying I'm very credible his accusers are also saying I'm very credible so tomorrow's hearing is going to be really tough I think for a lot of people to watch anyway which person you should agree with what I go back to the president I think the president is gonna be all about who looks like someone who's winning president Trump is all about winners and losers and if Brett Kavanaugh goes in there and doesn't seem as though he's gonna be aggressive doesn't seem as though he's gonna be someone who's gonna fight tooth and nail who maybe even has to go after a little bit of a little these accusers the president's not gonna be impressed with Brett Kavanaugh and that could mean that he would pull his nomination
