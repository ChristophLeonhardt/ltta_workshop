being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mainstream he said</font>

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,340
specifically this historically

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,590
filmmaking has always been an elitist

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,080
art form here's what I need if you

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,610
wanted to be a painter you needed a

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,600
brush and paint if you wanted to be a

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,320

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,300
you wanted to be a filmmaker you needed

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,820
cameras and film and lenses and gear and

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,950
people and actors and money and

33
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,190
connections and<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution you needed</font>

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,590
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know important people it's never been</font>

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,800
an accessible means of self-expression

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,229
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology change that the beauty of</font>

52
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,120
increasingly pressured to use incredibly

high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology in order to create</font>

54

bloggers who have people who shoot and

59
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,940
edit their videos for them now and that

60
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now seen as the minimum in order for</font>

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,870
you to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to be legitimate on</font>

62
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and I think the sooner that we</font>

realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this illusion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of YouTube</font>

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,090
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> democratic and being a place where</font>

65
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,960
anybody can

67
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,040
that is a load<font color="#CCCCCC"> of BS I think it's the</font>

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
better for us because then we can move

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,050
forward as a community and the sooner we

70
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,590
can you know except that you don't have

Casey has a very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of the people that I associate</font>

vlogging in the late<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2010's he is first</font>

78
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,750
and foremost a filmmaker a filmmaker who

79
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,810
had the frustrations of having to deal

80
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the mainstream and having to deal</font>

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,330
with gatekeepers and compared to that

82
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,890
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how the mainstream kind of</font>

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,110
film industry is YouTube is an

84
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,240
incredibly refreshing place to be but

85
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing is only people see the kind of</font>

86

vlogs that people make nowadays those

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,230
who are the biggest creators and they

88
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,880
have management<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and teams</font>

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,800
behind them and editing teams and

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,440
sponsorship deals and then they're like

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">well that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not something I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do I</font>

92
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,290
have a nice site on an imac that's it

93
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,800
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's terrible because</font>

94
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this increased level of bar of entry</font>

95
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,580
this increased level of benchmark means

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,430
that when I was like 16 17 18 I would

97
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,290
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never thought of making videos I'd</font>

98
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,760
have never thought of starting on this

99
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,980
medium and this medium has changed my

100
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">life probably more than anything and I</font>

101
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,520
want that opportunity to be for

content my videos do not always look

160
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:35,169
slick and edited and amazing the third

161
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,669
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do is to break out of</font>

162
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,309
these social bubbles the YouTube has

163
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,499
naturally created there's not something

164
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,719
innately problematic bout them but one

165
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,009
of the things that Casey said in this

166
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,039
video was you need to know important

167
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,619
people and that is how you grow a

168
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,689
channel these days the way that you

169
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,429
become the next big<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is by</font>

170
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:56,020

somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has an established audience</font>

173
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,889
and that is yes another outside of

174
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">finance that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is yet another high barrier</font>

175
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,770
to entry that young kids who want to be

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,689
filmmakers who want to vlog who want to

177
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,639
share their lives I've struggling with

178
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,619
if they see youtube want to do it and
