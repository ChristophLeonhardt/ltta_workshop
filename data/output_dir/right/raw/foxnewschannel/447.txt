1
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:07,783
MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

2
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:09,618
CONFIRMATION BATTLE OVER BRETT

3
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:10,185
KAVANAUGH.

4
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,953
THE WHITE HOUSE GIVING THE FBI

5
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:14,756
THE GO-AHEAD TO EXPAND ITS

6
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:15,891
INVESTIGATION OF THE

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:16,958
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BY

8
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:17,659
INTERVIEWING ANYBODY HE DEEMS

9
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:19,828
NECESSARY.

10
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:22,731
THIS IS, THE BUREAUS PROBE COULD

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,200
WRAP UP AS EARLY AS TOMORROW.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,601
PRESIDENT TRUMP STANDING BY HIS

13
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,070
NOMINEE IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,471
FDA REVIEW.

15
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,173
>> THIS IS THEIR SEVENTH

16
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,174
INVESTIGATION.

17
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:33,375
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE JUST

18
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,176
STARTING.

19
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:36,545
I WANT THEM TO DO A VERY

20
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:39,614
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION.

21
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:44,953
WHATEVER THAT MEANS ACCORDING TO

22
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:46,154
THE SENATORS AND THE REPUBLICANS

23
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:47,122
AND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.

24
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:49,157
I WANT THEM TO DO THAT.

25
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:50,559
I WANTED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE.

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,961
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A GOOD

27
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:53,995
THING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

28
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:55,163
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD

29
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:56,198
LIKE IT TO GO QUICKLY.

30
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,167
THE REASON I WOULD LIKE IT TO GO

31
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,602
QUICKLY, VERY SIMPLE.

32
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,403
IT'S SO SIMPLE BIRD BECAUSE IT'S

33
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:05,340
UNFAIR TO HIM AT THIS POINT.

34
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,041
>> Jesse: AFTER DEMANDING THE

35
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,510
FBI PROBE, DEMOCRATS ARE

36
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,947
PREDICTABLY COMPLAINING IT'S NOT

37
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,347
GOOD ENOUGH.

38
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:13,582
>> BASED ON SOME OF THE REPORTS

39
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:15,550
WE'VE SEEN I'M VERY CONCERNED

40
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,318
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE

41
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:20,155
WHITE HOUSE SHOULD NOT BE

42
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,523
ALLOWED TO MICROMANAGE AN FBI

43
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:21,957
INVESTIGATION.

44
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,490
>> THERE IS TIME.

45
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,794
THE THING IS, EVERY SENATE VOTE

46
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,561
MATTERS AND THERE'S TIME TO GET

47
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,731
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT EVEN IF IT

48
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:30,365
IS SEVEN DAYS.

49
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,133
THAT'S BAD ENOUGH BUT THEN TO

50
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,535
LIMIT THE FBI AS TO THE SCHOOL

51
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,570
BAND WHO THEY'RE GOING TO

52
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:35,937
QUESTION.

53
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:36,972
>> Jesse: THE ARIZONA

54
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,707
PROSECUTOR WE SAW AT THE HEARING

55
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,676
LAST WEEK IS DEALING A BLOW TO

56
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,043
DEMOCRATS.

57
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:42,811
RACHEL MITCHELL DETAILS IN A

58
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,780
MEMO WHY SHE WOULD NOT BRING

59
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,982
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST

60
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:47,983
KAVANAUGH, SAYING IT'S EVEN

61
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,852
WEAKER THAN "HE SAID-SHE SAID."

62
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:55,523
DANA, YOU MISSED THIS, ON

63
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:55,991
VACATION.

64
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:56,658
>> Dana: I KEPT TABS ON IT A

65
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,394
LITTLE BIT.

66
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:00,729
THEY HAVE A THING CALLED WI-FI

67
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,366
IN SPAIN.

68
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,434
IT'S ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE, THE

69
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:10,071
WEEK.

70
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,007
I SAID TO GREG I CAN'T BELIEVE I

71
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:12,474
MISSED THE WEEK.

72
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:17,746
HE SAID THAT'S A OKAY.

73
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:18,380
NEXT WEEK WILL BE WORSE.

74
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,751
HERE WE ARE.

75
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:23,485
SO EXTREMELY COMPELLING ANSWER

76
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,619
INTERESTING POLLING CAME OUT

77
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:28,990
TODAY FROM QUINNIPIAC SAYING 40%

78
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,292
OF PEOPLE POLLED, VOTERS POLLED,

79
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,160
SAID THEY DID NOT THINK HE

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,829
SHOULD BE CONFIRMED.

81
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,496
42 PERCENT DID.

82
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,333
BUT 56% THINK HE'S -- THIS IS

83
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,368
PART OF A POLITICAL SMEAR

84
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:39,735
CAMPAIGN.

85
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:40,769
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER

86
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,136
NUMBER.

87
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,739
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME MORE

88
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:44,273
POLLING ON THIS.

89
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,175
THERE ARE BASICALLY FOUR CENTERS

90
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:50,379
THIS COMES DOWN TO.

91
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,382
MURKOWSKI, FLAKE, COLLINS, AND

92
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:53,716
MANCHIN.

93
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:57,386
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN

94
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:57,986
WEST VIRGINIA.

95
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,922
THERE IS INCREDIBLE PRESSURE ON

96
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:00,589
SENATOR MANCHIN BECAUSE HIS

97
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:03,726
CONSTITUENTS, A NUMBER THAT'S

98
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,359
ASTRONOMICAL, WANT BRETT

99
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,561
KAVANAUGH TO BE CONFIRMED.

100
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,696
I THINK A RISK PER BRETT

101
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,231
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION THIS WEEK

102
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,766
IS THAT NOW THAT THE HEARING IS

103
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,968
DONE, NOW WE HAVE THIS FBI

104
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,203
INVESTIGATION, AS YOU SAID,

105
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:15,838
DEMOCRATS SAYING THAT'S NOT GOOD

106
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:16,171
ENOUGH.

107
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,107
SENATOR McCONNELL SAYING TODAY

108
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:20,943
WE WILL VOTE THIS WEEK.

109
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,177
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU BASICALLY

110
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:24,747
HAVE DEAD AIR PER BRETT

111
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,548
KAVANAUGH.

112
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:29,184
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING SO

113
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:30,552
PASSIONATELY ABOUT HIS NOMINEE

114
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:31,787
TODAY FROM THE ROSE GARDEN HELPS

115
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,856
FILL THE GAP A LITTLE BIT BUT

116
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:35,591
THE NEWS CYCLE MOVE SO FAST.

117
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,592
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A RALLY

118
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,593
TONIGHT AND HE'S GOT ONE

119
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,394
TOMORROW.

120
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:40,195
HOW LONG CAN HE KEEP IT GOING?

121
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:41,230
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE NOMINEE

122
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,198
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TO KEEP IT

123
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:44,800
IN THE NEWS ON THEIR TERMS.

124
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,168
>> Jesse: HE IS HIGH-ENERGY

125
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:46,502
ENOUGH.

126
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,804
I THINK YOU CAN FILL THE VOID.

127
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:50,339
THIS MITCHELL REPORT, EMILY,

128
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:52,941
THAT CAME OUT.

129
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,976
SHE WAS NONPARTISAN SEX CRIMES

130
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,177
PROSECUTOR WHO REPUBLICANS

131
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:55,577
BROUGHT IN.

132
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:56,578
SHE RELEASED A LETTER THAT SAID

133
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,446
SOME INTERESTING THINGS THAT SHE

134
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,049
WOULD NEVER, EVER BRING CHARGES

135
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,052
IN A CASE LIKE THIS AND IT'S

136
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:05,354
INCREDIBLY WEAK FOR A NUMBER OF

137
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:05,688
REASONS.

138
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:07,156
>> Emily: MULTIPLE THINGS

139
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:07,656
ABOUT THE REPORT.

140
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,792
FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE ALREADY

141
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,293
HEARING BACKLASH THAT SHE SHOULD

142
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,628
MENDED A REPORT WHICH I FIND

143
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,162
PREPOSTEROUS.

144
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,830
WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO?

145
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,800
TEXT FROM THE PLANE?

146
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,701
THIS WAS OUTSOURCED BY THE

147
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,468
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

148
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,570
REPUBLICANS FOR HER TO DO A JOB.

149
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,972
OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO ISSUE A

150
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:23,973
REPORT.

151
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:24,640
I'M ALSO HEARING A LOT OF

152
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,176
BACKLASH FROM OTHER PROSECUTOR

153
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:28,377
SAYING THIS WASN'T A PROPER

154
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:30,579
INVESTIGATION AND THAT'S NOT THE

155
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,147
APPROPRIATE STANDARD.

156
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,381
THE BOTTOM LINE IS SHE DID THE

157
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,650
ABSOLUTE BEST WITH WHAT SHE WAS

158
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,818
GIVEN AND THE INVESTIGATION IN

159
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,920
THAT CLOSED WORLD.

160
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,056
SHE USED A PREPONDERANCE OF

161
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:41,190
EVIDENCE STANDARD WHICH IS THE

162
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,591
LOWEST.

163
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,960
TO BRING CHARGES AS A

164
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,660
PROSECUTOR, THE STANDARD FOR

165
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,763
THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE REASONABLE

166
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:47,997
BELIEF THAT THE CHARGES ARE

167
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,967
SUPPORTED BY PROBABLE CAUSE.

168
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,770
AND THEN ALSO ADMISSIBLE

169
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,871
EVIDENCE SUPPORTED AND IT'S IN

170
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,005
THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE.

171
00:04:56,005 --> 00:05:00,143
SHE USED THE LOWEST POSSIBLE

172
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:00,977
STANDARD, GETTING THE LOWEST BAR

173
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:02,378
TO CROSS SO FAR TO INSUFFICIENT.

174
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:06,349
I FOUND THE REPORT DETAILING AND

175
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,183
THAT SHE SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE

176
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,751
CREDENCE THAN SHE IS.

177
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,353
>> Jesse: ARE THE DEMOCRATS

178
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:10,820
OUT OF BULLETS?

179
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,588
WE'VE HAD HEARING AFTER HEARING

180
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:14,323
GRADY HAS PRODUCED MORE

181
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:14,991
DOCUMENTS AND ANSWERED MORE

182
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:18,961
QUESTIONS THAN ANY SUPREME COURT

183
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,197
NOMINEE IN HISTORY AND NOW WE

184
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:22,765
HAVE A SEVENTH FBI BACKGROUND

185
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,066
CHECK.

186
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,767
IS IT GOING TO BE ENOUGH?

187
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,370
>> Juan: CHECK YOUR HISTORY.

188
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,071
WE'VE HAD LONGER CONFIRMATION

189
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:31,174
BATTLES IN OUR HISTORY.

190
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:32,608
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE, I'M

191
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,377
AMAZED AT WHAT YOU JUST SAID

192
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,445
ABOUT THIS PROSECUTOR FROM

193
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:36,946
ARIZONA NOT BEING PARTISAN.

194
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:38,281
SHE WAS BROUGHT IN BECAUSE THEY

195
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,949
WERE ALL MALE REPUBLICANS AND

196
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:40,817
SHE WAS BROUGHT IN BY THE

197
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:44,754
REPUBLICAN SIDE, I DEFINITION --

198
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,022
>> Jesse: DOES THAT MAKE HER

199
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:46,389
PARTISAN?

200
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,392
>> Juan: YES, IT DIES.

201
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:49,560
AS I RECALL, LINDSEY GRAHAM CUT

202
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,794
HER OFF BECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE

203
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,463
WASN'T BEING EFFECTIVE AND NOW

204
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,398
SHE DECIDED SHE'S GOING TO

205
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,699
REDEEM HERSELF WITH THE

206
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:56,400
REPUBLICAN BUDDIES BY ISSUING

207
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,234
THIS REPORT WHICH HAS NO

208
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:58,002
STANDING BECAUSE IT WASN'T BASED

209
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:00,137
ON ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION

210
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:04,708
BASED ON WHAT SHE WAS ABLE TO

211
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:10,114
GATHER AT THE HEARING.

212
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:10,781
>> Jesse: THE KEY POINT FROM

213
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:11,482
DEMOCRATS, THE DEAL LIKE THIS

214
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:12,182
WOMAN AND SHE DID A NICE JOB.

215
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:12,783
GENTLE AND PROFESSIONAL.

216
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:13,384
>> Juan: THE DEMOCRATS.

217
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,452
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THE KEY

218
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,554
POINT IS YOU LOOK AT THE POLL

219
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:19,356
NUMBERS THAT DANA REFERRED TO.

220
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,724
LOOK AT THE FOX POLLING,

221
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:22,159
QUINNIPIAC, YOU LOOK AT HARRIS,

222
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,329
HARVARD, IT'S ALL THE SAME.

223
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:26,063
PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE KAVANAUGH.

224
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:29,633
THEY DO BELIEVE HER.

225
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:30,968
>> Dana: NO, THAT'S NOT --

226
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:31,402
THAT'S NOT --

227
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:33,737
THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION.

228
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:34,471
UNLESS YOU SAW A DIFFERENT POLL.

229
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:39,309
THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION ASKED.

230
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:40,844
>> Juan: THE FOX POLL HAS

231
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:44,181
50 PERCENT DO NOT CONFIRM.

232
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,583
36% [BLEEP]

233
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:46,784
BELIEVE FORD

234
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:49,186
, NOT KAVANAUGH.

235
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:49,987
IT'S BECOME TRIBAL.

236
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:51,889
YOU SEE AN UPTICK IN TERMS OF

237
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,490
THE NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO

238
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,094
ARE BACKING KAVANAUGH.

239
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,129
THEY DIDN'T ACT KAVANAUGH TO THE

240
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,165
EXTENT THEY BACKED NEIL GORSUCH.

241
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:02,332
THIS IS NOT A POPULAR NOMINEE.

242
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:05,135
IN THE MIDST OF THE TRIBAL

243
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,537
WARFARE, IT TAKES UP.

244
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,371
IT TAKES UP AMONG DEMOCRATS AS

245
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:07,971
WELL.

246
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,973
THE KEY QUESTION FOR ME, IN

247
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,141
TERMS OF WHEN WE GO FORWARD,

248
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:13,343
WHAT'S THE STANDARD?

249
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:14,545
NOW THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE WHO KNEW

250
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,379
KAVANAUGH EITHER IN HIGH SCHOOL

251
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:18,115
OR COLLEGE AND THEY ARE SAYING

252
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:18,749
HE WASN'T FORTHCOMING AND

253
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:21,151
TRUTHFUL ABOUT HIS DRINKING.

254
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,586
IF YOU HOLD TO THE STANDARD, AND

255
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,754
I ARE GOING TO GET DEMOCRATS

256
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:26,356
WERE GOING TO SAY THIS IS A

257
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:27,091
MATTER OF CHARACTER FOR SOMEONE

258
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,494
WE ARE PUTTING ON THE COURT FOR

259
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:32,463
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AND WAS

260
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:33,931
LYING ABOUT WINKING.

261
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,165
>> Jesse: NO ONE LIED ABOUT

262
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:35,532
DRINKING.

263
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:40,938
YOU WANT TO USE THE DRINKING

264
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,473
STANDARD, TED KENNEDY COMES TO

265
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:42,773
MIND.

266
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,975
>> Greg: I HATE THAT WE ARE

267
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,543
USING POLLING TO GAUGE SOMEONE'S

268
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:46,944
INNOCENCE.

269
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,746
THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW.

270
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:49,980
THIS IS NOW THE COLISEUM IN

271
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,982
WHICH WE TURN TO THE CROWD, GAVE

272
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:53,183
THE THUMBS-UP OR THUMBS DOWN.

273
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,485
THEY DIDN'T JUST MOVE THE

274
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,085
GOALPOST HERE.

275
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,722
THEY TURNED OVER THE GAMEBOARD

276
00:07:58,722 --> 00:07:59,456
BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WERE IN

277
00:07:59,456 --> 00:07:59,790
TROUBLE.

278
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,358
IF HE IS LYING ABOUT BOOZE, WHAT

279
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:02,993
ELSE IS HE LYING ABOUT ARGUMENT

280
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:05,162
COMETH CLEAR DR. FORD LIED ABOUT

281
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:08,165
A NUMBER OF THINGS AS WELL.

282
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:08,999
YOU CAN CALL THEM

283
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:09,466
INCONSISTENCIES.

284
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,268
THAT'S THE POLITE WAY OF SAYING

285
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:11,769
LIES.

286
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,337
WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT PLANE

287
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:13,938
TRAVEL.

288
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,539
SHE ONLY HAS A FEAR OF FLYING

289
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,141
WHEN IT'S NOT ON VACATION.

290
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,942
THE POLYGRAPH.

291
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,310
SHE WASN'T SURE WHEN IT WAS.

292
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,945
SHE SAID IT WAS A DEVASTATING

293
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,713
EXPERIENCE BUT THERE WERE TWO

294
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:23,080
QUESTIONS.

295
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,983
THE CLAIM THAT SHE NEVER GOT AN

296
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,952
OFFER FROM THE REPUBLICANS, LIKE

297
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:29,253
GRASSLEY, TABLET MEETING OVER

298
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:29,553
THERE.

299
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:33,157
GIVING NOTES TO REPORTERS.

300
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:34,725
CHANGING BYSTANDER TO NOT

301
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:35,092
BYSTANDER.

302
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:37,227
I WILL BE DIPLOMATIC AND SAY

303
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:38,929
THERE'S A LOT OF INCONSISTENCIES

304
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,964
TO HER OTHERWISE CREDIBLE

305
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:40,498
TESTIMONY.

306
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:43,967
THAT IS HOW YOU TALK APPARENTLY.

307
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,936
IF HIS LIES ABOUT BOOZE, WHICH I

308
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,405
DO BELIEVE HE FIBBED ABOUT HIS

309
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:48,172
DRINKING BECAUSE HE'S TALKING

310
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,740
ABOUT HIS DRINKING IN FRONT OF

311
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,541
HIS WIFE AND KIDS.

312
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,842
I AM SORRY.

313
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,744
I DO THE SAME THING.

314
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,347
WHEN MY WIFE ASKS ME HOW MUCH I

315
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:57,348
DRANK OVER THE WEEKEND WHILE

316
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:59,083
SHE'S AWAY I SAY NOT MUCH,

317
00:08:59,083 --> 00:08:59,784
HONEY.

318
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,385
SHE SAYS YEAH, RIGHT.

319
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,154
THOSE LIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO

320
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:04,355
THE ACTUAL ACCUSATION BUT SINCE

321
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:06,524
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALCOHOL

322
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:07,758
ABUSE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

323
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,193
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY

324
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:09,927
ALCOHOLICS BECAUSE THEY

325
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:11,228
COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT THE LAST

326
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,396
FIVE DAYS.

327
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,166
THEY DO NOT REMEMBER THAT THE

328
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,568
THIRD ACCUSER HAS A HISTORY OF

329
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:19,136
LYING AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

330
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,338
CLAIMS, LYING ABOUT HER

331
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,005
EMPLOYMENT, LYING ABOUT HER

332
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:21,372
EDUCATION.

333
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:25,376
THEY DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER THE

334
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,043
AVENATTI BOMBSHELL FROM LAST

335
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:28,312
WEEK WHICH IS NOW THE BOMBED

336
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,414
SHELL THAT SHE LIED ABOUT HER

337
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:31,916
BACKGROUND.

338
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,417
THEY BLACKED OUT ABOUT THE

339
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:33,985
RACHEL MITCHELL MEMO.

340
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,553
WE ARE COVERING IT.

341
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,955
THE ONLY REASON WE ARE COVERING

342
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:38,623
IT, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE'S

343
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,158
BECAUSE THEY BLACKED OUT.

344
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:41,826
THESE ARE HUGE THINGS THAT THE

345
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,161
MEDIA CANNOT REMEMBER BECAUSE

346
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,363
THEY DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER IT.

347
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:46,531
IT'S DISGUSTING.

348
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,367
>> Juan: YOU LISTEN TO THE

349
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,401
PRESIDENT TODAY, THE PRESIDENT

350
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,905
IS NOW ENGAGING IN JUST THE KIND

351
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,373
OF ANGRY BULLYING BEHAVIOR.

352
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:55,773
CORY BOOKER.

353
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:57,942
>> Greg: [LAUGHS]

354
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:58,776
>> Juan: RICHARD BLUMENTHAL IS

355
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:00,512
A LIAR COME ALL THESE DEMOCRATS,

356
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,414
THEY ARE NOT ANGELS OVER THERE.

357
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:06,751
>> Greg: ISN'T THAT GREAT?

358
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,452
>> Juan: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

359
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,121
A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.

360
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:13,958
TOTALLY DENIGRATING THE WHOLE

361
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,292
PROCESS.

362
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,026
>> Greg: UNCORROBORATED

363
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:15,427
ACCUSATIONS.

364
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:18,163
DESTROYING A PERSON'S LIFE.

365
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,964
AND UNCORROBORATED ACCUSATION.

366
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,399
>> Juan: YOU ARE FOCUSING AS

367
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,167
IF THIS IS JUST ABOUT KAVANAUGH.

368
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,303
>> Greg: THIS IS ALL IT'S

369
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:25,603
ABOUT.

370
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:27,372
YOU ARE WILLING TO DESTROY

371
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,173
SOMEBODY OVER A SEAT.

372
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,775
YOU CAN HAVE THE SEAT.

373
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,444
>> Juan: I HAVE BULLETS AND ME

374
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:33,144
FROM TRYING TO DEFEND SOMEONE

375
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:35,346
WHEN I THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING

376
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:36,347
