one side the right has basically surrendered the culture and they have willingly handed their children over to it most of what we call the culture war we say where we're fighting for the culture most of that stuff is not relevant the things that really matter I think many conservatives have just given up especially when it comes to the sexual stuff we say the left can do whatever wants there they can they can meet they can normalize they can put it in the mainstream they can do whatever they want we're not gonna stand in the way because if we stand in the way of that then we look like prudes we look like we're intolerant and we don't want to deal with those accusations now listen if you aren't a religious conservative if you want someone who believes in the in me or adheres to judeo-christian morality then um I don't expect you to have any problem necessarily with with Disney using their films as a means to promote homosexuality although I think even if you were in that camp and you're a libertarian or something I would think maybe you'd still be fed up with this need to turn every movie into an opportunity for a leftist sermon but that aside I'm speaking now about into those who do believe in judeo-christian morality those of us in that category we have to ask ourselves at what point do we stop giving our money to these companies whose primary mission is to undermine our morality and to bend - and to indoctrinate our kids into a morality that is opposite of our own it's no good to try and pretend that well this doesn't matter it's just a small thing has no effect on anything we know that isn't true Hollywood has an immense amount of power to normalize things and that is precisely what it's trying to do
