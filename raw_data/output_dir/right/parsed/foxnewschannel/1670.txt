>> Martha: WHO CAN OUT-TRUMP
TRUMP MAY BE THE NAME OF THE
GAME IN THE GEORGIA RACE FOR THE
NEXT GOVERNOR OF THAT STATE.
NEXT TUESDAY, FIVE REPUBLICANS
ARE ON THE BALLOT TO THE REPLACE
THE G.O.P. GOVERNOR, WHO IS TERM
LIMITED THERE AND HERE COME THE
CANDIDATES.
FIRST UP, FORMER STATE
SENATOR HUNTER HILL.
>> AS GOVERNOR I WILL STOP
SANCTUARY CITIES AND ELIMINATE
THE STADIUM TAX.
DURING THREE COMBAT TOURS I
DEFENDED OUR CONSTITUTION AND
NOW I AM READY TO SERVE AGAIN.
THESE GUYS, THEY WILL NEVER MAKE
IT OUT OF THE SWAMP.
>> Martha: THEN THERE IS
GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE BRIAN
KEMP.
>> I OWN GUNS THAT NO ONE IS
TAKING AWAY.
MY CHAINSAW IS READY TO RIP UP
SOME REGULATIONS.
I'VE GOT A BIG TRUCK JUST IN
CASE I NEED TO ROUND UP CRIMINAL
ILLEGALS AND TAKE THEM HOME
MYSELF.
YEP, I JUST SAID THAT.
WE WANTED TO GET THE SUBTLETY
AND THAT MESSAGE?
LAST AND MOST PROVOCATIVE,
PERHAPS, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH RACE.
MICHAEL WILLIAMS.
>> WEEK AT THE DEPORTATION BUS.
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME.
THE MICHAEL WILLIAMS DEPORTATION
BUS.
WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE WE ARE
COMING?
GO TO DeportationBus.com.
WE WILL IMPLEMENT MY DEPORTATION
PLAN THAT'S GOING TO FILL THIS
BUS WITH ILLEGALS TO SEND THEM
BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO TRACK
THEM AND WATCH THEM ROAM AROUND
OUR STATE, WE ARE GOING TO PUT
THEM ON THIS BUS AND SEND THEM
HOME.
>> Martha: HE JOINS US NOW
WITH THAT BUS BEHIND HIM.
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING,
SIR.
HOW DID THIS IDEA COME TO YOU
AND YOU ARE I THINK FIFTH IN THE
POLLS RIGHT NOW.
IS IT SORT OF A LAST DITCH
EFFORT TO GET SOME ATTENTION I
GUESS IS ONE QUESTION?
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR HAVING US ON IN THE WAY
THAT WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA,
MY CAMPAIGN STAFF, WE WERE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND
OF BUS TO WHERE WE WANTED TO
HAVE AND WE DECIDED WE DIDN'T
WANT TO DO ONE OF THOSE
TRADITIONAL KIND OF BORING
CAMPAIGN BUS STORIES.
WE WANTED TO COME UP WITH
SOMETHING THAT EXEMPLIFIES WHAT
OUR TAGLINE MEANT, WHICH WAS
FEARLESS CONSERVATIVE, AS WELL
AS ADDRESSES AN ISSUE THAT IS
PIVOTAL TO MY CAMPAIGN AS WELL
AS IMPORTANT TO ALL GEORGIANS,
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SO WE CAME
UP WITH THE MICHAEL WILLIAMS
DEPORTATION BUS TOUR AND WE
ACTUALLY STARTED IT TODAY AND WE
WENT TO TWO SANCTUARY CITIES TO
BRING ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTS
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HERE IN
OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY AND WE
FEEL VERY, VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT
OUR POSITION IN THIS RACE.
WE HAVE HAD TONS OF PEOPLE REACH
OUT TO US OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
WEEKS SAYING THEY'VE ALREADY
VOTED FOR US.
I KNOW THERE ARE POLLS OUT THERE
THAT WANT TO SAY OTHERWISE BUT
WE ALL KNOW POLLS DON'T MATTER,
WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHO SHOWS
UP AT THE BALLOT BOX.
HE >> Martha: YOU HAVE A VIDEO
ABOUT THE BUS AND IT WAS TAKEN
DOWN BY YOUTUBE.
WHY WAS THAT AND I BELIEVE THEY
PUT IT BACK UP, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THEY TOOK IT DOWN BECAUSE THEY
SAID, AND THEY SENT US A
CONFIRMATION THAT THEY TOOK IT
DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS FEAR, HATE
SPEECH.
WHAT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO ME
WAS THAT WE HAD SUPPORTERS NOT
JUST HERE IN GEORGIA, BUT ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY.
PEOPLE THAT LOVE THE
FIRST AMENDMENT, THAT LOVE OUR
CONSERVATIVE VALUES.
THEY REACHED OUT TO YOUTUBE AND
SET PUT THAT VIDEO BACK UP AND
THEY CAVED AND THEY PUT IT BACK
UP SO I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT
HAPPEN.
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN YOUR STATE, THERE
WAS A PERIOD WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE
IT COULD GO BLUE, SORT OF
BLUE-RED IN GEORGIA.
AT WHAT YOU'RE FEELING FOR HOW
YOUR STATE IS SHIFTING RIGHT NOW
AND HOW DO YOU THINK THAT YOU
CAN MAKE UP THE GROUND THAT YOU
APPEAR TO HAVE LOST TO CASEY,
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNMENT THERE?
>> WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT CASEY
CAGLE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT TO
THE RUNOFF.
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR ALMOST A
QUARTER OF A CENTURY.
REALLY HIGH NAME I.D.
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD NAME IDEA BUT
IT'S HIGH.
OUR GOAL, OUR OBJECTIVE WAS
ALWAYS TO MAKE IT TO THAT SECOND
SPOT SO WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE
RUNOFF WITH HIM AND AS FAR AS
THE STATE GOING BLUE, GOING RED,
WE HERE IN GEORGIA, WE LOVE OUR
PRESIDENT, WE LOVE WHAT HE'S
DOING, WE LOVE THE VALUES THAT
HE IS FIGHTING FOR AND I AM 100%
CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IN
GEORGIA IN 2019.
>> Martha: DID YOU GET ANYBODY
ON THE BUS YET?
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
THAT WE GET ASKED AS WE TRAVEL
AROUND, WE'VE SPOKEN TO MANY
NEWS OUTLETS AND THEY WANT TO
KNOW, ARE YOU ACTUALLY PICKING
UP ILLEGALS AND PUTTING THEM ON
THE BUS?
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO WE ARE
NOT.
THE PURPOSE OF THE BUS IS TO
BRING ATTENTION TO MY 287G
DEPORTATION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD
ALLOW SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES TO HAVE
MANY OF THEIR DEPUTIES ACT AS
ICE AGE AND SO WE CAN HAVE 159
COUNTIES WITH ACTING AS AGENTS.
THEY CAN BEGIN THE DEPORTATION
