once again this weekend the women marched and once again they had nothing to say we will dismantle the women's March point by point then Allie Stuckey and amber Athey joined the panel of deplorable z to discuss feminism the 45th anniversary of roe v wade the pointless government shutdown how technology is leading to unhappiness and further evidence that donald trump is boosting the global economy I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael nul show so by what I have to assume as divine providence I spent the women's March in pre-cana marriage counseling with my fiance sweet little ELISA actually sitting next to a guy named Jesus I turned to my right and there's a guy just named Jesus he pronounced it differently but sitting right there in pre marriage counseling so while the shrieking harpies yelled about nothing downtown I learned about how women actually are empowered and I just wanted to share a few takeaways because it was pretty good so one well feminism preaches about the Equality of the sexes women's empowerment you'll notice it only values masculine traits you know assertiveness aggression casual sex it leaves women generally unfulfilled and used so you see this especially in the hook-up culture so in the hook-up culture you know women are encouraged to view sex and exactly the same way that men view sex so men went frequently I don't want to tell any tales at a school men go out and they try to have sex and casual sex is much more common for men so women are told you have to do that you have to value that too and if women don't value casual sex if they don't feel fulfilled from it they're told that something is wrong with them this obviously leads to men just doing whatever they please and it's very nice for men but it's an ironic effect of feminism and a Christian marriage on the other hand sacramental marriage on the other hand is predicated on the Equality of the sexes on the equal dignity of the sexes in the beginning God created man both male and female he created them Eve comes from Adam's rib and Adam says bone of my bone you are flesh of my flesh and the rib here is important because he doesn't come from Adams skull from his head she's not above at him she doesn't come from Adam's foot she isn't from his toe she's not below him she's from his rib she's she has equal dignity men and women have equal dignity from the very beginning and so there you have a real equality of the sexes but a complimentary equality so in civil marriage and non-christian marriage non sacramental marriage civil marriage is a dis all Yubel contract that either party can break so when men get tired they can move on they can find a younger wife and they can leave women who have become less sexually desirable often less professionally capable high and dry usually leave them in custody of the children that they need to feed and because sacramental marriage is an oath taken before God that cannot be broken one phrase that was used as you shouldn't make a fool of God and as the the spouses go grow closer together they grow closer to God like an equal at equilateral triangle so as they move closer to God they move closer to one another at the pre marriage counseling they didn't harp too much a natural family planning commonly referred to as pull and pray which I sort of expected them to do I was expected they'd say have kids immediately you have a gazillion kids right now but they did point out that marriage which is from the beginning closed off to even the possibility of procreation that we don't want to have kids we just want to have a nice beach house or something that isn't valid in the eyes of the church we have to be open to life into giving life and to giving love even not everyone's going to have kids not everyone can have kids but there's a there's a sense of viewing the marriage which is that it has to be open to life that I think is widely throughout the culture is not the case in the United States especially after this sexual revolution but the church still views it that way they and it's very affirming and it's very life-giving so as we were learning all of this sweet little ELISA and I across town in downtown LA the shrieking harpies were marching to end life through abortion I guess I guess those are the most coherent signs really I don't think they had any idea what they were protesting flicka's talks friend of the show he went out there to check it out here's what he saw basically everything that he stands on as a platform to be honest what do you disagree with Trump so far well I tried for a lot of time so about five years so a lot of negativity towards the tribes what is like the number one reason whenever everyone's here pull my hair with Margaret NAT well what brings you here today everything they had nothing to say what are you here for I don't know I'm not sure yeah absolutely nothing to say the historian David McCullough observed that to write well is to think clearly which is why it's so hard but they can't write well they can't put a sentence together because they don't know what they're there for they aren't thinking clearly they're seeing a lot of people out and they're marching and we know that it should be marching we should feel things what are you there for you know just to be it to empower and to come out and I know no idea it's just foggy meaningless thinking this is incredible the New York Times listed the best quotes from the most articulate women's marchers that it could find here is the creme de la creme of the aimless shrieking harpies the first court they use one thing I hope for women in 2018 I want us to prove that we can we are here we know we can do it now we are here to stay that was a 36 year old woman who said that Amelia Paz the amazing thing with all of these quotes you'll see is you can't tell which of them were said by six-year-olds and which of them were said by 36 year olds but consider every single word that was just said there we are here wait no one ever said you weren't here no one ever I promise you no one ever thought you weren't here we may we know that the women are here they're more than half of the country that we can we know you can do a lot of things no one there they're reacting not only to problems that don't exist or to to quite no one ever said you're not here or you can't do something or whatever they're they're not even making a point they're just saying words that sound like they mean something but they don't really mean anything they're just words as would say words words words mashed up together that don't have any significance another quote there is power in numbers we all have different reasons for being here but we are all here to educate ourselves and empower each other it is an honor to be here that was a 19 year old named summer now they don't they don't actually have different reasons at all for being here it's all the same thing and it's unreason it does note there is no reason there are different ones though I'm here for this I'm here for that it's the same totally vague platitudinous nothing and now that woman went on she said it felt like such an important moment in history and that's the key here that's the key to this whole protest the whole women's March it isn't about anything it just seems like something important it has the look of a real protest movement like say the civil rights movement or john brown's raids so the abolition movement it looks like that but it isn't that they just want to seem like activists but they don't want anything because they have everything another quote I hope women keep coming together for positive movements in 2018 there was a 22 year old named shimmy me Branch I hope women keep coming together for positive no that doesn't mean anything obviously doesn't mean anything but Shamima you'll note isn't even marching for positive movements or whatever that is she's there to get extra credit for her gender studies class her Gender Studies class offered her credit to go to this thing and then she repeated the platitude she heard that means that this is being encouraged by the culture by institutions this isn't countercultural it isn't subversive it's it's part of the cultural orthodoxy to oppose the women's March is to contravene the orthodoxy of political correctness it could put your career in jeopardy this is real-life hashtag slacktivism signifying nothing other than one's own performed virtue but it's in real life it's moved off of Twitter into real life but it's just as empty it's just as vapid the next quote I believe that women are the key to world peace and justice I'm hoping that all women infuse their organizations with the common good because that's what we need for our country fill a blank 88 years old you have no idea what that means Expo in 2018 we want girls to stay strong and be confident in what they can do the more we stand together the more that we can do together now I know that sounds like all of the other quotes you just heard that was from an 11 year old girl and that's fine if an 11 year old girl wants to say something that doesn't really mean anything and is just kind of muddy thinking that's fine that's what 11 year olds do trouble is the 50 year olds is saying the same thing the 11 year olds are just as articulate as the 50 year olds what's the next one I hope that women fill up a whole lot of offices that's what it'll take to turn this around we need to step up to the plate and do it that was less articulate than any 11 year old the 11 year old made much more sense as Beverly may 59 years old and she said it seems like every day is an assault on my soul with what comes out in Washington the dismantling of our democracy blah blah blah blah blah doesn't she can't point to anything in particular of course just the just the feeling that's all the fields man next quote I hope for fair representation and more women in government I think that's where change will happen so you hear in all of these quotes as a 43 year old who said that just as meaningless as the 11 year old they're all about change so they're all saying we need to change we need to change things what change what change do you want what are you hoping for there isn't any clear chant we just had 8 years of Barack Obama the most left-wing administration in modern American history we've had we've got Europe but we've elected your candidates for years what change do you want nothing just perpetual change that's what we need next what I'm participating because education is the only cure for ignorance I believe women know compassion and kindness and love and empathy more than men that was a man that was a 26 year old man who said that unfortunately these days education seems to be the cause of ignorance rather than the solution of it next quote I want everyone to become equal it's like we're living in the 1920s and it is ridiculous we need freedom for all that was a 20-year old Rebecca Logan she's right because the stock market is really high our culture is really decadent that is true in a way it is a lot like the 1920s unfortunately people here are not only politically and philosophically ignorant they're historically ignorant as well there's this common perception among the lightly educated the Millennials that the past was uniformly just those bad olden days before the goodness of modernity and this is the heart of the progressive vision of the world you hear it throughout the change we need the change and the this and that the progressive vision of the world is that we're always getting better we're going toward progress and sometimes people who are either stupid or evil try to stand in the way of progress those people are conservatives but we know where progress is and that's why we have to be changing we can't be happy with what we have we can't count our blessings because we're not at utopia yet we're gonna go back to the Garden of Eden d'arnot we are we have not been kicked out of perfection human nature is perfectible but of course that isn't true and they can't that's all they can say right because they can't articulate quite what they want quite what is wrong is just something another woman said we're three generations my mother my daughter and me it's incumbent upon us as women to stand up and represent things are not gonna change if we don't become the instruments of the change so you hear the change that is all just about change as a 51 year old who said that but the standing is important here to the stand Michael Oakshott rights in rationalism and politics that the rationalist is always standing you just standing yeah they can't do anything because they they're they're so far and their own abstractions that they don't realize that real life takes place in time and space and with flesh so they just have to stand so she's standing for change whatever that means next well I'm marching because I want women to continue fighting and for the conversation to be more inclusive of the transgender community that was a Joe of a lace 28 whose stage name is Beatrix and who is from Brownsville Joe is a man this is an irony of the intersectionality stuff is that now a men are choosing to just call themselves women and then they get to take over the women's march and now there's no purpose to the women's March cuz it's a man's March next well we need to stand up not only for our choices but for everyone else's choices even if we disagree we have to accept each other and respect each other and meet in the middle okay next one said I chose this sign this the last one I chose this sign because the term angry black woman is so heavily stigmatized and I want black women in 2018 to know they're allowed to feel the widest amount of human emotions and that includes anger because anger inspires impactful change anger inspires impactful change the word impactful is that isn't a real word but people said this is it's it's like the quintessence of meaningless sloganeering it was a word that was invented in the 1960s it doesn't mean anything and that's that that quote really sums it all up it's just about feelings we need to feel things and then the feeling is going to vaguely do something but but not really do anything it's impactful clickhole did a parody of this kind of slacktivism a couple of years ago but now the culture has transcended parody here is a clip that could be an advertisement for the women's March I always wanted to be part of something bigger than myself to make a difference you go through life and you see all this injustice but you never really do anything about it you don't know how I have two little kids so I'm always thinking about their future after solution begins with just one person stepping up and taking responsibility that's why I'm taking the pledge I'm dating the plenty because I care about my community for my kids my grand for you for me for us for us for them and for me too because I care about the future and not just my future but the future of everyone every single person my baby boys taking the pledge is about standing up for what matters right it doesn't matter if you're black white Muslim Christian and Jewish anyone can take the pledge I got my brother to take the pledge and he got a spread to do it I got everyone in mice you get her to take the pledge and she gets someone else to get someone else and on and on and on and suddenly we've got something which bigger than anyone Foss you take the pledge and you're part of a global movement of people who believe in change this is big I can feel it can you feel it you go online and you see these little videos of all around the world people taking the pledge and sharing it with their friends and it's inspiring my name is you a and I'm taking the pledge Packard my god sucks mess with me do you know I'm getting the pledge I'm taking the pledge it's easy to be cynical but I really do believe it's possible to change the world wake up people it's 2015 we can freakin do this that could have been the advertisement for the women's March just a meaningless is nothing it doesn't get any better by the way on the women's March website here is the mission statement from women's March calm the mission of women's March is to harness the political power of diverse women in their communities to create transformative social change women's March is a women led movement providing intersectional education on a diverse range of issues and creating entry points for new grassroots activists and organizers to engage in their local communities through trainings outreach programs and events women's March is committed to dismantling systems of oppression through nonviolent resistance and building inclusive structures guided by self-determination dignity and respect what what what what does any of that mean they get a bit more as a specific later on but this just shows you how to how out of touch they are the first principle that they list is ending violence they right women deserve to live full and healthy lives free of all forms of violence against our bodies just to correct the record here women live significantly longer than men on average by the end of the 20th century the u.s. male life expectancy was seventy three point four years compared to eighty point one years for women unlike men when women register to vote they don't simultaneously have to register for the military draft men are far more likely to be the victims of violent crime than we 76.8% of murder victims are male boys and men are far more likely than girls and women to be victims of assault and robbery as well additionally according to the Gallup World poll women report being happier with their lives than their male counterparts women's March con goes on to the euphemistically titled reproductive rights they say we believe in reproductive freedom we do not accept any federal state or local rollback cuts or restrictions on our ability to access quality reproductive health care services birth control hiv/aids prevention or medically accurate sexuality education this means open access to safe legal affordable abortion and birth control for all people so it's all it's just about abortion they put all that other stuff there but it's really about abortion and yet according to a 2016 Marist Poll despite constant Democrat euphemisms renaming abortion as women's issues or reproductive health nationally the vast majority of women 77 percent support restricting abortion to at most the first trimester far fewer just 71 percent of men support restrictions on abortion the the women are clearer the majority of women 59% say abortion is morally wrong 52% of women believe that abortion should at most at most be permitted in cases of rape incest were to save the life of the mother but nevertheless according to the women's March women want abortion on demand anytime anyplace that just isn't backed up by reality on workers rights women's March comm declares we believe in an economy powered by transparency accountability of security and equity all women should be paid equitably and you hear this constantly this popular disinformation that there's a gender pay gap women make 77 cents on the dollar no equal pay for equal work but that gender pay gap disappears once you control for factors like education time in the industry and hours worked actually single childless women in metropolitan areas they don't earn less than their male counterparts they earn more than their male counterparts by 8% on average nationally women also graduate from college at significantly higher rates than men in 2015 39% of women 25 to 29 I had earned a bachelor's degree compared to just 32 percent of men on civil rights women's March comm explains we believe civil rights are our birthright including voting rights this is odd to pick a fight on voting rights as according to the Center for American women and politics since 1980 women have voted at higher rates in every single presidential election than men so by 2016 that gap widened to sixty three point three percent of women voting compared to just fifty nine point three percent of men additionally the number of female voters has exceeded the number of male voters in every presidential election since 1964 despite constituting a majority of the u.s. population 50.8% to forty nine point two percent women also benefit from affirmative action policies on campus and in the workplace that give them a competitive advantage over men there's a section on disability rights women's March comprar claims we believe that all women's issues are issues faced by women with disabilities and deaf women I guess that one's right that's right I guess that yes that's very deaf women or still women I don't know what the point of that is but sure that is that's the one thing that the women's March got right deaf women are women on immigrant rights women's marched out calm insists rooted in the promise of America's call for huddled masses yearning to breathe free we believe in immigrant and refugee rights regardless of status or country of origin we believe migration is a human right and that no human being is illegal so putting aside for a moment the illogic of a national policy to do away with national borders even on the numbers the women's March doesn't seem to represent women even among illegal aliens brought to the United States as children and teenagers even the dreamers the most sympathetic and relentlessly demagogue group of illegal aliens a November survey from morning consult and Politico shows that fewer than 30 percent of Americans support amnesty even among Democrats support for granting amnesty to the most sympathetic group of illegal aliens is just 44% finally at last segment on environmental justice women's March comm observes we believe that every person in every community in our nation has the right to clean water clean air and access to an enjoyment of public lands lucky for them federal law has protected all of those things to say nothing of state and local management for at least the past five decades the women's March is the most frivolous protest in the history of the world to discuss we bring on two women who are not frivolous Allie Stuckey and amber Athey but first before I can talk to these brilliant and beautiful women I've got to talk about Skillshare I've got to keep the lights on in here folks this is a wonderful thing so some people all they want to do is complain that they can't get ahead they can't make more money they can't learn anything they can't start a new career whatever and then other people are just productive and they just do it Skillshare calm is the best way to do this so you know what I've talked about this before this isn't the first time we've talked about Skillshare but I love it so it's January you're probably thinking about your New Year's resolution if you haven't broken it already it's gonna late January so usually most of those are gone by now but while many people have resolved to go on a diet you know start shedding for the wedding as I need to do before my tuxedo fitting hit the gym call mom more often Skillshare encourages listeners to use 2018 to learn new skills and make this year their best year yet so Skillshare calm is great it's an online learning platform with over 18,000 classes and design business technology more for me it's very hard for me to manage my time really well I get pulled in a lot of different directions obviously I always need to finish my stogies and I gotta sleep at least 27 hours a day so it's very hard to fit things in they're great classes on Skillshare about time management how to be more productive whether you're trying to deepen your professional skill set start a side hustle because it's 2018 and

morning of the women's March quote beautiful weather all over our great country a perfect day for all women to March get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones an unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months lowest female unemployment in 18 years is there anything for women to be upset about in America in 2018 I what they were celebrating I saw so many clever signs that celebrated the surging economy and the low women's unemployment didn't you there were varying dollar bills not vagina cause a lot more apps not only do women not have anything to complain about an American 2018 but we really do have so much to celebrate I just I don't buy this whole intersectional farce that we are all split up based on our unique oppression and that we're not united by anything good and that's why I think feminism is cancer not just to women but to the country in general because women aren't allowed to celebrate the same things that benefit men we don't see economic success I guess is something that is special to women but we have to break down our oppression to something that's specific to our race to our gender to our socio-economic background in what they're refusing to see is the unity that President Trump has actually accomplished through his policies and the interesting thing is I was on HLN and I was speaking to a co-organizer last week and I asked her which policy specifically are you protesting and she said anti-choice the gender wage gap and criminal justice reform well the problem with that is none of those things are policies they're not policies I don't even know any policies that President Trump has put forth that has been in opposition to those things and this was a co-organizer of the women's March so they really they really do not know what they are marching for against not in a tangible sense it's like what you said just completely frivolous and nebulous this intangible sense that they are dealing with injustice it's my central theory of the left which is that they want the appearance of the thing the form of the thing but not the essence of it so they want to look like those really cool marchers back in the 1960s and didn't they look so cool so we're gonna do that - what are you marching for what do we want I don't know when do you want it whenever that's basically what it's become amber have we reached peak feminism or women realizing that feminism is a pack of lies as Ali was describing that will just destroy their lives or sadly as Lena Dunham the voice of a generation well here's the problem and I think you touched on this in your opening segment which is the women's March does actually have a platform on their website but the way that they market the March is so reduction so reductionist that people don't even realize what they're actually marching for so there's like these pink hats and there's nice signs about how women are so powerful and you know anti-trump and also of course some very vulgar signs which stood in stark contrast to the March for Life the day prior but women just go out there because they're told if they don't that they're anti-woman that there are bad women and that's why you have men out there who of course are trying to support their wives and their girlfriends who have told them that if they don't go that they're complicit with the patriarchy so it's all boiled down to this this pro-women March but no one can really define what exactly that means so it's hard for me to say that feminism has reached a breaking point just yet when people don't realize what exactly they're marching for when they go out for an organization like this which in reality is just like hard left progressive policies but I will say I was a little bit surprised when and that lore'l had this model come in she was a hijab model she was actually modeling for a hair campaign which is one of the silliest things I've ever heard because obviously you can't see her hair but we uncovered some anti-israel tweets that she had made back in 2014 and she was pretty quickly removed from being a spokesperson for l'oréal which was incredibly surprising to me because you have these leaders of the women's March who are consistently very anti-israel and pro-palestine mmm and something you said in particular that is surprising is that's a sign of hope something that in particular you said it really sticks with me is being complicit in the patriarchy that is the slogan of our show the Michael no licit in the patriarchy so that I got to write that down that's a that's a nice good marketing material Ali what do you think you're you're a you'd you're a conservative millennial you you are very much involved in the culture is the culture turning against feminism or is that just wishful thinking are we just stuck in our own conservative bubbles yeah I think it's hard to say I think we're going to see in the polls which is actually something to their credit that they did emphasize a lot now we'll see if their emphasis on actually going out to vote will work during the midterms and of course in 2020 but I think that's where we're going to see our answer to is all of this marching the celebrity influence this crazy bias in the media towards the women's March and towards intersectional feminism and Linda Sarsour and all of this crazy stuff is that actually going to translate into votes for the Democratic Party and I'm just not sure because you read off some of those stats and that really the majority of Americans aren't represented by these far-left policies that the women's March is pushing for so are people actually going to be swayed by the vagina costume where people who had to be swayed by the crude posters of well I won't even go into all that I don't know it'll be interesting to see on the one hand on the one hand I do think that the celebrity influence kind of gives them perhaps an upper hand on the other hand on the other hand I think that Millennials are um we're not as impressed with celebrity anymore and we're kind of turned off by it in a way so I do I think that actually that could also do them a disservice um so I know that's not a clear answer what I think that we're gonna see is just how we vote and if we vote and in the midterms it's hard for me to say because of course I am I'm denouncing it and I am NOT a feminist and I didn't go Marsh but that's me is that gonna be the pitch for a new show on CR TV look I'm not a feminist I'm a millennial I'm is that how's the show going to prep the show prep and everything to tell us a little bit about it before we hand over to do yes it will be launching on the 29th which is next week I'll be going to DC to meet all of my see our TV peeps on the 30th for the State of the Union will be doing a live show all together on that night but all of my videos and stuff will come out next week as well so thanks for X yeah I look forward to it I obviously I had actually deleted CR T V from my browser or my computer wouldn't even go to it when it was just Crowder and then now that you're there roaming is going over there I guess maybe I'll have to complete yes I guess so so we're gonna talk about the March for Life which is like the opposite of the women's March it's just it has a point it's very life-affirming it's this wonderful thing it actually coincides and aligns with the opinions of the vast majority of American women but if you're just on Facebook and YouTube I'm sorry folks you got to go to daily wire.com to do it if you're already a member thank you you helped keep the lights on you keep khofifah in my cup it's really nice if you go to daily wired.com right now you will get me you get the Andrew Klavan show you get the Ben Shapiro show you'll get the conversation and you can ask questions I think I'm up next so you can log-in and ask questions in the mailbag and you can ask questions during the conversation you get no ads on the website yeah right enough of that enough of that what do you really get you get this I I want like a little pink hat on top of the leftist years tumblr this is the day to do it folks the anniversary of Roe be waiting it the whole country is turning pro-life we've got the women shrieking my luckily I had my official daily wire earbuds in so they didn't pop my eardrums over the weekend and I had my leftist tears tumblr to collect all of their salty salty delicious and incoherent tears so go to daily wired.com right now you've got to get it we'll be right back the March for Life took place last Friday today is the anniversary of roe v wade which invented some constitutional right to abortion that I don't ever really remember Alexander Hamilton or James Madison writing about but they found it there somewhere Ali will we see an end to legal abortion in our lifetimes I don't know I don't know and I think roe v wade was a horrible decision and I don't think it was constitutional like you said I think he completely made up an inference from the 14th amendment that had no found in what the founders actually meant it's a little you kind of hope that we'll go back to our constitutional roots and that a bad decision will one day be reversed but it seems like we're going away from the Constitution wholesale anyway so it's hard for me to believe that we will go back on this decision but of course I mean that that is my hope that even if even if it was just a 20-week ban even if we just made headway in that direction I would be happy and I think that might be possible because I think Trump actually just made some sort of announcement to to that end but I don't I don't have confidence that we will ban abortion altogether in our lifetime and the pro-abortion left they always talk about rape incest life of the mother all three of those cases of abortion constitute less than one percent of annual abortions so that's fine you want an exception for that I could compromise on that if I could get rid of 99% of abortions tomorrow and ironically we were told Donald Trump is this lifelong politically not quite clear sort of a Democrat playboy from Queens he's perhaps the most pro-life president we've ever had he's the first u.s. president to address the March for Life which itself is the the longest continuous protest in American history he's been very good on pro-life and we can only hope that he'll push to just etched away at the edges maybe we can't overturn roe v wade tomorrow but we can push those bans a little further back we can get more originalist Sanh the court and we can we can work toward that as the March for Life has done for four decades Amber compare and contrast the March for life to the women's March the former seemed to me was life-affirming joyful triumphant really nice the latter was miserable shrieking and laced with profanity as just a matter of marketing who on earth would want to go to the women's March what kind of people is it attracting and turning off yeah well I mean you pretty much just summed it up the March for Life no was that a loaded question I don't it was a really happy like fun time obviously people had really nice signs no one was screaming at each other and then you go to the women's March and you have women who's simultaneously claimed that Trump is debasing the office of the president while holding up signs with curse words and vaginas drawn on them so it's kind of unreal and actually the the point was demonstrated pretty clearly to me last year I went to both last year I didn't make it this year but I was riding on the Metro on the way to the women's March to cover it for I was working at campus to form at the time and I actually ended up getting berated by a random man on the metro when he found out that I was a conservative pro-life woman and to the credit of the women around him they were very shocked at the way that he was you know talking to a woman it was very much what one might call mansplaining but just I've never seen something like that in March for life I've never seen you know pro-life people offer anything but love and acceptance and you know they're never judgmental about women who choose to get abortions they just they're always talking about the message of love and how you know women are best served by accepting them and loving them despite whatever mistakes that they've made and the women's March is just all it's it's about you know there are certain women that are wrong that have internalized misogyny that need to be reallocated and you saw this with Cecile Richards calling out specifically white women who are at the March and how they need to do more work before they are truly feminist and just just for the viewers who don't aren't familiar with Cecile Richards she is the the maniacal ghoul who 300,000 babies a year as the head of Planned Parenthood so if you answer who makes hundreds of thousands of dollars profits off of the sale of their parts and their organs in their limbs that woman that's the sale Richards and I think the women's march in their quest for intersectionality they end up actually becoming much more divisive than they originally intended because someone's plate is always worse than someone else's plate so yeah you're black woman so you must have it harder than a white woman but oh here's a transgender black woman who's missing your left hand and all of a sudden you've lost the oppression of a snake starts eating its own tail and this is to an aspect in the March for Life these people are protesting the slaughter of innocent babies they have a clear purpose they have a clear objective and it's pretty serious but they're joyful about it and it's because they have a seriousness of purpose and they're really doing something the women's March are griping about absolutely nothing they cannot describe what they're protesting but they're shrieking vulgarities because that's the only thing bouncing around their empty heads and very often we see this in political debate people who don't know what they're talking about or know what they're doing they get crazed and hysterical and the people who do have a purpose and a seriousness of purpose or a bit joyful because they're they're pointed toward the good they're doing something that has a purpose and they're going to achieve it and not let their own craziness get in the way of that you know speaking of totally purposeless things the government reopened again and no we didn't give amnesty to the illegal aliens and we didn't give up on the wall but Democrats shut down the government last week and then they reopened it today without gaining anything Ali what was the point of this government shutdown the point of the government shutdown was for Schumer to flex the muscles and for them to be able to use the rhetoric that Bernie Sanders has already made over the weekend I predict I knew was going to happen they're going to continue it through the midterms is they're going to say look the government shut down I told you that Republicans were completely unable to govern they haven't been able to govern anything since Trump took office they made you all these promises they haven't been able to do it and they shut down the government because they don't care about illegal which we know is totally not true at all Trump can't vote in the Senate we know that's a lie but they are going to continue that line of rhetoric can tell the midterms to say that Republicans cannot govern I think that was the entire purpose of it I've always thought that Democrats wanted to shut down the government so they can use that messaging going into the midterms I think that's what they'll do yeah I think you're right there's so much more to talk about there's just one last bit we're gonna have to skip ahead a little because we're running late today the International Monetary Fund announced today that it expects global economic growth to exceed predictions largely because of Republican tax reform amber the better things seem to be going the more hysterical the left seems to get why is that why are why are they reacting in exactly the opposite way that you would suspect well it's really sad I think just in general liberals and Democrats to some extent are so anti Trump that they put the failure of President Trump over the success of the country they would rather see president Trump's presidency implode they'd rather see the government shutdown they'd rather see Robert Muller's investigation prove Russian collusion and impeach Trump than they would for you know everyday Americans to get $1,000 tax cut it's just pathetic and they've gotten to this hysteria to this point that they're they're selling such heavy partisan politics except they can't be happy for any successes in this country as long as Trump is out there and even more than that obviously they're dedicated to their political goals and their agenda but they're so devoted to their narrative that when reality contradicts their narrative as it has they deny reality they deny their lyin eyes because the narrative is more important so they predict that the economy will tank if Donald Trump is elected they predict he'll become an authoritarian they predict the this that and the other thing it will clamp down on rights for everybody none of that has happened the opposite has happened they say he'll be a terribly obscure president they won't let the press do anything it's the most transparent administration in modern presidential history and yet they have to believe the narrative you see this on the left obviously and even among anti-trump Republicans they they're so committed to that narrative but it's very important the one thing we know about politics is you're never gonna get it right especially the thing we know about Donald Trump is the guy is a complete wild card and if you make a prediction about him you're probably going to be proven wrong so that the narrative aspect of all of it the ideological aspect of all of it is really not helpful to the ideologue sit puts blinders on them and I think they're missing the reality that that's right in front of us but that's why they gotta stay tuned and enjoy the cafe if you just enjoy the cafe you're gonna see the world
