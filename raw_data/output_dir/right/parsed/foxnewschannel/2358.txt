JONG-UN.
>> Rick: GREG, WHAT CAME OUT OF
TODAY'S SUMMIT?
>> RICK AND SANDRA, NO MORE WAR.
I THINK THAT WAS THE HEADLINE
THAT CAME OUT OF TODAY'S SUMMIT.
A BIT LIGHT ON DETAIL BUT VERY
STRONG ON MESSAGE.
KIM JONG-UN BECOMING THE FIRST
NORTH KOREAN LEADER SINCE THE
KOREAN WAR TO STEP FOOT INSIDE

LEADER.
PROBABLY GOT THE SAME
IMPRESSION MANY HERE GOT.
A BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THAN
EXPECTED.
AFTER STUDYING KIM JONG-UN I
ASKED ONE OBSERVER IS THIS A
GUY THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN DO
BUSINESS WITH?
I WAS TOLD YES BUT WITH A
