Laura: COULD HISTORY BE REPEATING ITSELF WITH OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTOR SEEKING FAME AND GLORY? MARK VARGAS CITED THE FATE OF FORMER ILLINOIS GOVERNOR, ROB BLAGOJEVICH OF ILLINOIS. DEMOCRAT IS SERVING A 14 YEAR SENTENCE FOR CORRUPTION. VARGAS ARGUED THAT THE STOMACH HE WAS A VICTIM OF OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTION. IT WAS THEN THAT FBI DIRECTOR BOB MUELLER, WHO IN 2008 AUTHORIZED A TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND RUTHLESS PREDAWN RAID OF THE GOVERNOR. HERE WITH US EXCLUSIVELY ARE BLAGOJEVICH'S WIFE, PATTY, AND CHICAGO ATTORNEY LYNN GOODMAN, WHO REPRESENTS THE FORMER GOVERNOR. IT'S GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. PATTY, YOUR HUSBAND HAS BEEN IN JAIL FOR NOW SEVEN YEARS OF A 14 YEAR SENTENCE. HE WAS CONVICTED ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CORRUPTION CHARGES, BRIBERY AND EXTORTION I BELIEVE. I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THAT THEY THINK, HE MUST HAVE TAKEN A BRIBERY, OR PROMISE TO DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE GIVING HIM MONEY, AND HE MUST HAVE BEEN HEARD OR THERE MUST HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE SAYING ALL THAT. BUT IN FACT, NONE OF THAT HAPPENED. NONE OF THAT AT ALL. FOR ME LISTENING TO YOUR SHOW, IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOGI BERRA SAYS, DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. TEN YEARS AGO, THE SAME PEOPLE, COMEY, FITZGERALD AND MUELLER, THESE OUT-OF-CONTROL PROSECUTORS CAME AFTER MY HUSBAND WITH THEIR UNCHECKED POWER TO UNDO AN ELECTION BY THE PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE ARE SO FAR FROM ELIOT NESS, THEY ARE A MILLION LIGHT LIGHT YEARS AWAY. THEY ARE USING THEIR OFFICES FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL ENRICHMENT TO FURTHER THEIR CAREER TO SELL BOOKS. SPEED Laura: I DON'T THIK SPEED Laura: I DON'T THIB MULLER NEEDS TO FURTHER HIS CAREER, HE IS THE FBI DIRECTOR. HE'S ESTEEMED BY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. HOWEVER, AND YOU COULD GET IN ON THIS, HE DID AUTHORIZE A RAID THAT WAS REMINISCENT OF MANNA PU THAT WAS REMINISCENT OF MANNA PL MANNA FORT AND COHEN. IT WAS A PREDAWN RAID, THEY GO IN AND TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF THE APARTMENT. AND IT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS. IT COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND A WHITE COLOR CASE. THEY COULD HAVE CALLED THE LAWYER AND HE WOULD HAVE COME DOWN AND SURRENDERED. TO DO THAT TO HIS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN WAS DISGRACEFUL. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT PATRICK FITZGERALD, FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING ARE LIKE, WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS GUY, PATRICK FITZGERALD? IT GOES BACK INTO THE 80s, AND HE WENT BACK TO SCOOTER LIBBY. OUTRAGEOUS PROSECUTION, AND HE WENT AFTER CONRAD BLACK. THE COURT PART OF THAT CONVICTION OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME COURT. AND OF COURSE NOT ONCE BUT TWO TIMES, THEY TRIED BLAGOJEVICH. THE COURT SADLY DIDN'T TAKE THE CASE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THEY COULD HAVE CLEARED UP THIS RIDICULOUS FEDERAL BRIBERY STATUTE WHICH IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING, WIDE ENOUGH TO DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH. AND YET HE IS PRAISED FOR BEING IS THE MOST ESTEEMED PERSON. HE DID THE ENRON INVESTIGATION AND THE ENRON CASE. BUT THERE WERE PROBLEMS THERE, TOO. ARTHUR ANDERSON ENDS UP GETTING EXONERATION EXONERATED, MEANWHILE THEY LAID OFF 85,000 PEOPLE IN THE INTERIM OFF 85,000 PEOPLE IN THE INTERI INTERIM. IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE PROTECTING THEM BUT THEY HAVE UNCHECKED POWER OFTEN TIMES AND IT CAN BE OUT OF CONTROL. AND I'M SORRY, BUT AS I SPEAK OF THE FORMER CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, I DON'T WANT TO BE ON
