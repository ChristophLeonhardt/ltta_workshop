1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
I had planned on monitor trusted and

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,009
although it would have been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,429
difficult primary I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I could have</font>

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">one I don't know maybe not I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I</font>

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,990
could have one and I had a lot of data

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,830
and I was fairly confident that if I

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,710
were the democratic party's nominee I

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,180
had the better need a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,609
president when I said I would make a

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:34,320
decision by the fall following fall one

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
year before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general election</font>

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
everybody's announced well before that

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,410
the press began to think i was playing a

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,969
game but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't tell them about my</font>

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,570
boy he didn't want anybody feeling sorry

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:01,280
for you if he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run but</font>

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,809
people who were close to say well I

18
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,309
didn't run because it wasn't good for

19
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,020
the family I have to be honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,710
I didn't run because no man a woman

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,240
should announce for president nited

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
states unless they can look the public

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,850
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye and say I promise you giving</font>

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,299
one hundred percent my attention is

25
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,939
dedication<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this effort I knew I</font>

26
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,509
couldn't do that

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,950
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because he kept</font>

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,979
saying don't announce you're not running

29
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,380
because my son Hunter my daughter Ashley

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,270
my wife all thought I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

31
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,170
but at the end of the day I just

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:58,830
couldn't do it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> regret not</font>

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,899
running in the sense that it was the

34
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,970
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision for my boy for me for my</font>

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,209
family at a time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I regret not</font>

36
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,410
being president yes and I know that

37
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,590
sounds I know what it sounds like but no

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,360
man or woman announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> for president</font>

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,850
on his face unless they honestly believe

40
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,920
from their experience they're the best

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,510
qualified person to do that and at the

42
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,819
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought that the circumstances</font>

43
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,319
are such that I was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best qualified</font>

44
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,430
not every year would you be the best

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,010
qualified but the things that I've spent

46
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,280
my whole life doing American foreign

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,510
policy I the ability to bring people

48
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,780
together the respect of both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,510
the aisle I thought there was a need to

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,239
bring the country together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font>

51
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,340
I could have done it but you know is my

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,989
mother would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say everything happens for</font>

53
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:09,989
a reason and some being as honest as I

54
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,450
can possibly mean try agreed not being

55
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,630
president yes there get not running for

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,079
president light of what was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in</font>

57
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,390
my life at the time no I don't regret I

58
00:03:21,390 --> 00:00:00,000
made the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right decision</font>
