this evening the Senate will receive the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh there'll be plenty of time for members to review and be briefed on the supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announcing on the Senate floor late last night that the FBI has finished its supplemental background check into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the report was given to the White House and delivered to Capitol Hill where it will be reviewed today the investigation which is centered around decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct against Cavanaugh is planned to be kept secret sources briefed on today's schedule tell NBC News that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley will be the first to see the report at 8:00 a.m. followed by ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein at 9:00 a.m. the GOP members on the committee will get the report at 10:00 a.m. and Democrats on the panel can view the report an hour later other senators will have access to the report afterwards McConnell last night arranged for a key vote for Cavanaugh's nomination to be held on Friday if that vote passes there will be up to 30 hours of debate setting up a final confirmation vote on Kavanagh as early as Saturday deputy press secretary Raj Shah tweeted overnight that the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh to the Supreme Court meanwhile the White House is defending president Trump after he mocked Kavanagh accused her Christine Blasi Ford at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night here first is what the president said Tuesday night followed by what press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway had to say yesterday what he's going through 36 years ago this happened I had one beer right I had one beer well you think it was written up there was one beer oh good how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know what neighborhood was it in I don't know where's the house I don't know upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember the president was stating the facts every single word judge Cavanaugh has said has been picked apart every single word second-by-second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off-limits and outrageous she's been treated like a Faberge egg by all of us beginning with me and the president he's pointing out factual inconsistencies you have preparation for her claims have you found me can you fill in her memory gaps her ink at her factual inconsistencies that is part of the evidence gathering process in any hunt for truth you know I find it to be flabbergasting Sarah Huckabee Sanders especially I sort of discount Kellyanne Conway because she so so clearly didn't tell the truth from the get-go but you had Mitch McConnell Jeff Flake Lindsey Graham Lisa Murkowski a lot of people said they did not like but the president said when he visibly mocked this woman on stage if you want to pick apart the details of how this is being treated and exactly what she said and show that there are some discrepancies show that there are some challenges to her story that's fair no that is absolutely fair that's why the hearings are being had that's why finally the FBI was able to step in because there are questions but when you have this misogynist knowingly mocking her on stage I really don't understand Sarah Huckabee Sanders I don't get it some would say that you're basically a flak for a misogynist who is a proud predator who brags about grabbing women by the genitals as a woman in a powerful position I'm sorry you're a complete disappointment a complete disappointment there is absolutely no excuse for defending a president for mocking a victim of sexual misconduct a victim of something a woman who is suffering you can't say that's wrong you have been you have made rotten to the core by this president so Willie it is as weakest said it's one thing if you want to question this story as it pertains to Brett Kavanaugh if you want to say hey it's a New York time to set and as many other news outlets have said all along that nobody could corroborate her story and you could talk about the inconsistencies in a calm way to say well just as the president said before I respect dr. Ford but I also respect Brett Kavanaugh I don't believe that he did it there have been many people that have been walking that fine line and be and and being respectful of her but what we saw here of course was the president using as a political punch line the pain and agony that a woman has been enduring for over three decades and that is as all the Republican senators in spoke yesterday said that is simply not defensible and for the women of the White House to defend this misogynist attack is just really it's beyond well it's beyond most Americans comprehend and included in that group of people who did criticize the president's rally in Mississippi were Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake the three people who would determine the fate of this nominee so clearly it's on their minds but remember Kellyanne Conway's quote on September 17th quote this woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored this woman will be heard setting the early tone for the White House's reaction to this story something that Jonathan Lemire the president stuck to for a while until he veered wildly from it but I think what you see there is frustration they feel like they offer dr. Ford to come to California they feel like she's made excuses for not providing information to the committee they feel as Kellyanne said they've treated her well and that she has not given them what they've needed to move this process forward yeah for weeks now as you say the White House the president's aides both inside and outside of the West Wing were saying to him like look don't criticize her support Kavanagh don't go after doctor forethought there's no upside here you're just gonna alienate perhaps the voter it particularly the electorate particularly female voters and certainly these key senators who were going to determine Cavanaugh's fate and he listened for a while there's been a few cracks in that you know the tweet from Las Vegas that morning where he called into question her story and made the dig about her parents you know since then he has expressed some frustration when we've heard him talk but what happened the other night was in an eruption and and the reporter we've done suggests that you know it was a frustration about the process how long that was taking but in particular two other things that as he was flying down there on Air Force One down to that rally in Mississippi that he was reading stories the latest sad stories about Kavanagh that the the bar fight with the ice and things of that nature and he was growing frustrated thinking this is a good man whose name is being tarnished but also and this is not a coincidence the day then that New York Times story grant about his finance rights and that he was fuming about that feeling that that was out of bounds that was unfair and he had worked himself into a state when he got to this rally despite what other aides have been telling him hey behave yourself of course support your guy but don't go after her he couldn't help himself and resulted was this display which a lot of Republicans as you just said really felt was counterproductive to their efforts they're really disappointed what he said and cast into doubt you know Cavanaugh's fake going forward and here again another example of an overreach we've been talking this morning how some Republican voters feel like the media and the Democrats have overreached so here is the president doing the exact same thing I wouldn't be surprised if he continues this line of attack and if Kellyanne Conway is referring to a woman as a Faberge egg that's being handled too delicately like I said we've got a long way to the election you watch this can swing back the other way now Betsy the FBI report is going to be released in an hour - we know what's going to happen the Democrats are going to squawk and say that it's a rigged investigation the Republicans are going to squawk and say what John Cornyn said let's just go ahead and vote this is ridiculous has been too much time at the end of the day all of the noise all of the bread and circuses all everything that's going to be surrounding this we are exactly where we were last week aren't we this comes down to flake this comes down to more Kowski this comes down to Collins and it comes down to a handful of Democrats where are they right now one thing that we know for sure is that flake however he decides to vote is going to feel like he's gained significant cover because of this FBI investigation remember last week when he pulled his stunning switcheroo on the dais of the Senate Judiciary Committee one thing he made clear in the wake of that movement was that his top priority was preserving public confidence in the process for him this was more about the way the Cavanaugh confirmation played out potentially than the ultimate results of that confirmation process now I don't think there's been any significant increase in public confidence in the way the United States and it works because of this FBI investigation it's been widely viewed as insufficient and as something that's largely a symbolic undertaking but for flake it's something that he'll be able to point to going forward as an accomplishment as potentially appoints that he put on the board and as him taking a stand to try to defend this institution whether it has any impact whatsoever on broader American confidence in the institution very much remains to be seen but for him things have changed because this investigation happens and my understanding is that Murkowski and Collins are kind of thinking the same way we shouldn't expect to hear anything publicly from them until they've looked at this report but remember McConnell wouldn't have wanted to file to file cloture on the Kavanagh a confirmation vote if he hadn't been fairly confident that things were moving in his direction so that's significant Betsy Woodruff thank you very much still ahead Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to meet with kim jeong-hoon once again this weekend in an effort to reinvigorate nuclear to love each other we'll see if it will be like his last visit when the North Korean leader had more pressing business to conduct at a potato farm morning Jo will be right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
