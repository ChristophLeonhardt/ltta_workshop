1
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:06,323
ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:07,490
AS IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,727
ARGUE ABOUT, THE DEBATE OVER

4
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:11,361
IMMIGRATION CONTINUES TO

5
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,028
RAGE.

6
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:13,530
THE QUESTION OF THE BORDERS IS

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,300
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,401
THE AUTHOR OF MELTING POT FOR

9
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,669
CIVIL WAR, THE SON OF

10
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:21,037
IMMIGRANT MAKES THE CASE

11
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:23,773
AGAINST OPEN BORDERS.

12
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:29,713
TELL US QUICKLY THE ARGUMENT

13
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,647
YOU ARE SETTING OUT IN THIS

14
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:31,014
BOOK.

15
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:31,781
>> THE BASIC ARGUMENT IS THAT

16
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,017
WE HAVE ABANDONED THE IDEAL OF

17
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:32,749
WE'VE I

18
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:38,588
THE MELTING POT.

19
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:39,422
WE'VE ABANDON THE IDEAL THAT

20
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:40,357
WHAT WE NEED IS THE UNIFYING

21
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:41,124
NATIONALISM THAT CAN CREATE A

22
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:41,591
COMMON CULTURE.

23
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:42,292
INSTEAD WE HAVE IMMIGRATION

24
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,226
POLICIES THAT ARE EXACERBATING

25
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:43,860
OUR DIVIDE.

26
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,828
THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT FIND

27
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,764
YOURSELF IN A CIVIL WAR FEELS

28
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:48,331
MORE REAL THAN EVER.

29
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:49,966
THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR.

30
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,836
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS OFFER

31
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:53,670
A POSITIVE POPULIST PROGRAM OF

32
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,172
THE KIND THAT YOUR VIEWERS

33
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:55,872
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT'S ABOUT

34
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,408
HOW WE CAN OVERCOME THOSE

35
00:00:58,408 --> 00:00:59,142
DIVIDES AND BUILD A NEW

36
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,244
AMERICA THAT IS RICHER,

37
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:01,978
STRONGER, FAIR AND THAT REALLY

38
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,947
WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS

39
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:07,284
REGARDLESS OF CLASS OR ETHNIC

40
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:07,751
BACKGROUND.

41
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,919
>> SOTELO SOME OF THE

42
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:09,786
SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF A

43
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:13,891
POTENTIAL PLAN TO DELIVER THAT

44
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:17,561
PROMISE.

45
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,462
>> THE HEART OF THE IDEA IS

46
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,396
THAT RIGHT NOW OUR IMMIGRATION

47
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:20,164
SYSTEM DOES NOT REALLY SERVE

48
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:20,764
OUR NATIONAL INTEREST.

49
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:24,001
THAT'S ONE REASON WHY THERE'S

50
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,701
SO MUCH RESENTMENT.

51
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,003
IT'S NOT CONTROLLED.

52
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,273
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S

53
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:29,973
SPEAKING TO THEIR INTERESTS.

54
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:32,709
THE HEART OF THE IDEA IS THAT

55
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,577
WE SHOULD HAVE AN IMMIGRATION

56
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:38,715
POLICY IN WHICH WE SELECT

57
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:39,416
IMMIGRANTS ON HOW THEY CAN

58
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,051
HELP US OVERCOME ALL THE

59
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,586
OBSTACLES WE FACE TOWARD

60
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:43,220
BUILDING A BETTER, FAIRER

61
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,554
SOCIETY.

62
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:47,624
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A

63
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,159
MORE SELECTIVE APPROACH BUT WE

64
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,527
MIGHT ALSO NEED SOME KIND OF

65
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,296
AMNESTY OR PATH TO LEGAL

66
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:55,366
STATUS PROVIDED WE HAVE TRUE

67
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,367
CONTROL OVER WHO COMES IN AND

68
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,135
WHO LEAVES THIS COUNTRY.

69
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:03,407
>> SOME OF THAT, PEOPLE WILL

70
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:04,241
CHEER AND SAY YES, PROPER

71
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:04,842
MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION.

72
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:09,380
THE OTHER PART OF IT, THE

73
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,114
LEGALIZATION, PEOPLE WILL SAY

74
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,048
FINE BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS AND

75
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,616
YOU NEVER GET THE BORDER

76
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,150
SECURITY COMPONENT.

77
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,154
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT

78
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:17,755
CRITICISM?

79
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:18,356
>> WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN

80
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,590
BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION DEALS

81
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,559
IN THE PAST, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

82
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,059
TRULY BIPARTISAN.

83
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,127
THEY HAVE BEEN FAKE

84
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:24,762
BIPARTISAN.

85
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:25,396
THEY'VE BEEN AN ALLIANCE

86
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,965
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO WANT CHEAP

87
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:28,632
LABOR AND GUESTWORKERS AND

88
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:32,436
PEOPLE WHO WANT AMNESTY,

89
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:33,337
RATHER THAN THOSE WHO WANT TO

90
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:34,305
DEAL WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN

91
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:37,208
IN THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME

92
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,576
UNLAWFULLY WITH THOSE WHO WANT

93
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,377
CONTROL AND WANT TO NATIONAL

94
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:40,044
INTEREST IMMIGRATION POLICY.

95
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,580
THAT'S WHY I OFFER A SPECIFIC

96
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,314
PROPOSAL SAYING YOU ARE NOT

97
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:44,281
GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF

98
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,083
PATHWAY UNLESS IT'S DONE IN

99
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,720
CONCERT WITH A TRUE NATIONAL

100
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,921
INTEREST IMMIGRATION POLICY

101
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,856
THAT ALLOWS US TO ACTUALLY

102
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,891
HAVE THE KIND OF INTERMARRIAGE

103
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,960
AND INTERMINGLING THAT CREATED

104
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,628
THE MELTING POT MAJORITY THAT

105
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,398
MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT IN THE

106
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,699
DECADES FOLLOWING THE SECOND

107
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,501
WORLD WAR.

108
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:04,569
IT WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO MAKE US

109
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,970
THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE

110
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,873
WORLD.

111
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:09,741
>> I'M SORRY, I NEED TO MAKE

112
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:10,341
SURE RICHARD CAN GET IN.

113
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:11,075
CAN YOU SEE DEMOCRATS GETTING

114
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:11,609
BEHIND THE.

115
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,410
>> I THINK DEMOCRATS CAN GET

116
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,311
BEHIND THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE

117
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:14,679
TO FIND A PATHWAY TO

118
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,180
CITIZENSHIP FOR THE 11 MILLION

119
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,948
UNDOCUMENTED THAT ARE HERE AND

120
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:22,253
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE WHO

121
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:22,854
HAVE BEEN PART OF OUR

122
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:23,187
ECONOMY.

123
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:23,955
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

124
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:24,989
THEY TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS AND

125
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:25,890
CLEAN OUR HOME, THEY WORK ON

126
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,492
CONSTRUCTION SITES MR LARGO,

127
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:30,862
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY WANT

128
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:31,496
NOTHING BUT THE AMERICAN

129
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:31,796
DREAM.

130
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:32,497
WITH THAT BEING SAID WE DO

131
00:03:32,497 --> 00:03:38,202
HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE

132
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,137
SURE THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF

133
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:39,737
SECURITY ON THE BORDER.

134
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:40,705
I'M NOT SAYING A WALL IS THE

135
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:41,673
ANSWER BUT WE SAW PRESIDENT

136
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:42,373
OBAMA DOUBLE THE SPENDING ON

137
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:43,174
THE BORDER AND DOUBLE THE

138
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:49,180
BORDER PATROL.

139
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,852
>> JUST A QUICK QUESTION.

140
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:55,787
, THE POINT IS, DEALING WITH

141
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:57,522
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HERE,

142
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:00,558
THE POINT IS WE WANT TO ENSURE

143
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:01,960
THAT THIS PROBLEM DOESN'T GET

144
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,430
FURTHER EXACERBATE

145
00:04:05,430 --> 00:00:00,000
EXASPERATED.
