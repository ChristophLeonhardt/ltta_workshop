DESPITE A NUMBER OF EXPLOSIVE

00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:16,921
REVELATIONS, SOME LAWMAKERS ARE

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:20,358
STILL SUGGESTING THE PARTS MAY

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:20,792
BEEN REDACTED.

7
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:21,959
JOINING ME NOT TO GIVE US

00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,162
EXCLUSIVE REACTION'S HOUSE INTEL

00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,097
CHAIR DEVIN NUNES.

10
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:26,931
CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS WHAT WE'VE

11
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,634
ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

12
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:31,769
ON THIS MATTER, THE HILLARY

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,071
EMAIL MATTER, YOUR INITIAL

14
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,139
REACTION.

15
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,841
>> THE FIRST THING I CAN THINK

16
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,943
OF IS THERE WAS INFORMATION WE

17
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:41,946
GOT TODAY AT 11:00, 12:00 THAT

18
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:42,947
CHAIRMAN GOWDY HAD TO CALL AND

19
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:45,149
TELL ME WHAT IT WAS, TEXT

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,384
MESSAGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

21
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:48,652
ASKING FOR SINCE LATE LAST YEAR.

22
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:52,123
THESE ARE TEXT MESSAGES THAT

23
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:53,157
CLEARLY WERE PERTINENT TO OUR

24
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:55,659
INVESTIGATION AND TO FISA ABUSE

25
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,394
AND THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION,

26
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:58,129
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS

27
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,563
COLLUSION.

28
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:00,998
THESE ARE EMAILS OR TEXT

29
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:02,566
MESSAGES THAT SOMEBODY HELD A

30
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:03,467
FROM US.

31
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:04,233
EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY, THERE'S

32
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:08,839
A NEW EXAMPLE OF OBSTRUCTION OF

33
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:10,207
THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION.

34
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:12,543
>> Laura: I WANT TO READ TO

35
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:13,644
YOU BETWEEN AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN

36
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,379
LISA PAGE AND PETER STRZOK, THE

37
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,547
STAR-CROSSED LOVERS.

38
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:18,548
SHE BASICALLY SAID SHE WAS --

39
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:19,816
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GET

40
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:21,885
ELECTED, RIGHT, RIGHT?

41
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:23,787
HE ANSWERS BASICALLY DON'T

42
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:24,087
WORRY.

43
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:25,555
WE WILL STOP IT.

44
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:28,058
NO, NO, NO, WE WILL STOP IT.

45
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:31,962
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

46
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,798
THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR, THE LEAD

47
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:35,232
INVESTIGATOR.

48
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,033
>> LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON THE

49
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:40,570
CLINTON EMAIL CASE.

50
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,004
STARTS OFF THE

51
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:41,738
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

52
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:42,372
INVESTIGATION USING OUR

53
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,573
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO GO

54
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,542
AFTER THE TARGET, THE TRUMP

55
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:45,909
CAMPAIGN.

56
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,210
THIS IS A GUY WHO LEADS AT ALL.

57
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,478
WORSE THAN ALL THAT, WORSE THAN

58
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:49,779
ALL THAT AND I WANT TO REPEAT

59
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,948
WHAT I SAID IN THE OPENING.

60
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:53,817
WHY WASN'T THAT GIVEN TO

61
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:54,184
CONGRESS?

62
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,953
WHY DID I FIND OUT ABOUT THAT

63
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:57,387
TODAY AT NOON?

64
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:01,358
THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF

65
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:02,893
OBSTRUCTION BUT THE QUESTION IS

66
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:03,760
WHO'S GOING TO INVESTIGATE THESE

67
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,394
GUYS?

68
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:05,362
WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY

69
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,163
TRANSPARENT WITH THE AMERICAN

70
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:06,963
PEOPLE, WERE GOING TO GET ALL

71
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,598
THE DOCUMENTS WE WANT.

72
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,600
ULTIMATELY THIS IS ALL GOING TO

73
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,735
SPILL OUT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING

74
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,637
TO ASK, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING

75
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:14,337
TO DO?

76
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,606
WHO IS GOING TO GET BUSTED?

77
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:19,976
WHO'S GOING TO GO TO JAIL?

78
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,579
>> Laura: LISA PAGE'S TEXT WAS

79
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,781
RELEASED BEFORE BUT THE STRZOK

80
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:25,381
"DON'T WORRY.

81
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,817
NO, NO, NO WE'LL STOP IT."

82
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:28,685
THAT CAME TODAY.

83
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,820
>> HOP WITHOUT A POSSIBLY BEEN

84
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,187
REDACTED?

85
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,522
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

86
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,657
THEY KEEP BLACKING THINGS OUT

87
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,859
ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT GIVING US

88
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,227
DOCUMENTS THAT AT THE END OF THE

89
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,063
DAY ALWAYS END UP BEING VERY

90
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:42,198
PERTINENT TO OUR INVESTIGATION.

91
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,299
>> Laura: THE IG WROTE THE

92
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,668
FOLLOWING IN ONE PART OF THE

93
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,236
"UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

94
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,571
DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT

95
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,339
STRZOK'S DECISION TO PRIORITIZE

96
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,008
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION OF THE

97
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:52,975
FOLLOWING UP ON THE MIDYEAR

98
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:55,144
RELATED INVESTIGATION LEAD

99
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,280
INVESTIGATED DISCOVERED ON THE

100
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,947
WEINER LAPTOP WAS FREE FROM

101
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:01,517
BIAS."

102
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,953
SO THE IG CANNOT CONSTANTLY

103
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:06,956
STATE THAT IT WAS FREE FROM BIAS

104
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:07,423
STATE THAT IT WAS FREE FROM BIA

105
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:07,990
BIAS.

106
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,959
THEY ARE SAYING THERE WAS NO

107
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,527
POLITICAL BIAS ON THE PART OF

108
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:12,161
COMEY.

109
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,162
THEY ARE TRYING TO DOWNPLAY IT.

110
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,631
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE KNOW.

111
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:26,675
I'VE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE.

112
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:27,376
WE HAD WHISTLE-BLOWERS BUT WE

113
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:27,977
COULDN'T REALLY USE THE

114
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:28,711
INFORMATION BUT NOW THAT IT'S IN

115
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:29,278
THE IG REPORT, WE CAN.

116
00:03:29,278 --> 00:03:30,012
WE HAD WHISTLE-BLOWERS WHO CAME

117
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:30,746
TO US IN LATE SEPTEMBER OF 2016

118
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:31,380
WILL TALK TO US ABOUT THIS

119
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,114
LAPTOP SITTING IN NEW YORK THAT

120
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,282
HAD ADDITIONAL EMAILS ON IT.

121
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:43,826
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

122
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:44,660
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTE

123
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,327
COMMITTEE, WE HAD IT BUT WE

124
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:46,028
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

125
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:46,728
>> Laura: WHEN WAS THAT AGAIN?

126
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:47,296
>> INCORPORATED 2016.

127
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:47,930
>> Laura: DO YOU KNOW WHEN

128
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,263
EXACTLY?

129
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:48,997
>> ETIQUETTE WAS LATE SEPTEMBER.

130
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:49,665
>> Laura: ULTIMATELY THEY

131
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,933
DIDN'T MOVE ON THIS UNTIL LATE

132
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:51,567
OCTOBER.

133
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,401
>> GOOD FBI AGENTS BROUGHT THIS

134
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:56,538
TO OUR ATTENTION, BUT WHAT COULD

135
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:57,172
WE DO WITH IT?

136
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:57,940
>> Laura: THERE IS ANOTHER

137
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,942
EXCHANGE I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR

138
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:00,309
ATTENTION.

139
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,410
>> I SAY THAT BECAUSE OF THE

140
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,679
CLASSIFIED AND THIS IS A GAME

141
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:07,149
THAT COMEY AND COMPANY HAVE BEEN

142
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:09,218
PLAYING THAT THEY HIDE BEHIND

143
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:09,785
THIS --

144
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:10,986
>> Laura: THEY ALL THOUGHT

145
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:11,620
HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN.

146
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,790
ROCKING THE BOAT WAS TOUGH.

147
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,992
HE MADE A DECISION TO GO AFTER

148
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,192
THAT LAPTOP BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

149
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,060
IF SOMEONE FINDS OUT ABOUT IT,

150
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,762
THEY ARE GOING TO BAKE THE WHOLE

151
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:26,401
ELECTION WAS ILLEGITIMATE.

152
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,570
>> WHAT'S ALSO TRUE AS I THINK

153
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,172
THE SAME PEOPLE IN CHARGE TODAY

154
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,506
STILL BELIEVE THEY CAN RUN THE

155
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:32,607
CLOCK OUT AND THEY ARE TRYING TO

156
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,675
RUN THE CLOCK OUT FOR THE REST

157
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,977
OF THE CONGRESS THAT WE GET

158
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:36,845
FINISH OUR INVESTIGATION.

159
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:37,812
>> Laura: ARE THERE STILL

160
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,647
PEOPLE IN THE FBI TODAY WHO

161
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:42,951
BELIEVE THEY OPERATE BY A

162
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,486
DIFFERENT SET OF RULES?

163
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:45,587
>> AT THE TOP.

164
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,155
AT THE TOP, I THINK THAT IS

165
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:47,756
STILL TRUE.

166
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:49,858
WE HEARD SOME GREAT WORD

167
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,993
STATEMENT CHRISTOPHER WRAY, THE

168
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:52,761
NEW DIRECTOR.

169
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,296
BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A

170
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:55,664
LITTLE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE

171
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:56,598
HAVE THESE VERY CONVERSATIONS

172
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:58,233
WITH HIM MANY MONTHS AGO WHERE

173
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,367
WE SAID LOOK, YOU ARE NOT

174
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,202
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF IT.

175
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:02,303
YOU NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP, AND

176
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,137
WE WILL SUPPORT YOU AND CLEANING

177
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:07,141
IT UP BUT YET HERE IT IS TODAY

178
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:11,179
WE GET THIS TEXT MESSAGE AT NOON

179
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,547
TODAY, ONE THAT'S ABSENTLY

180
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:13,281
PERTINENT TO OUR INVESTIGATION.

181
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,015
MAYBE THEY HAVE A GOOD EXCUSE

182
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:18,152
FOR IT BUT THE PROBLEM WITH IT

183
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,154
IS IF THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT TO US

184
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:20,721
IT'S A PROBLEM.

185
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,956
IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT

186
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,558
IT'S AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM.

187
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,992
>> Laura: THERE'S OTHER

188
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,260
THINGS, ANOTHER EXCHANGE.

189
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,163
FBI ATTORNEY SENT --

190
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,765
THEY DON'T IDENTIFY WHO THIS IS.

191
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:31,566
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

192
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,366
WHO THIS IS.

193
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,768
FOR SOME REASON, WE CAN'T GET

194
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,370
THE PERSON'S NAME.

195
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,572
FBI ATTORNEY NUMBER TO SEND AN

196
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:40,374
INSTANT MESSAGE TO FBI ATTORNEY

197
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,842
NUMBER ONE COMMENTING ON THE

198
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,811
AMOUNT OF MONEY THE SUBJECT

199
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,713
OF AN FBI INVESTIGATION HAVE

200
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,815
BEEN PAID WHILE WORKING ON THE

201
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:51,485
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

202
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,520
FBI ATTORNEY ONE SAYS IS IT

203
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,256
MAKING YOU RETHINK YOUR

204
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,292
COMMITMENT TO THE TRUMP

205
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,128
ADMINISTRATION?

206
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,097
FBI ATTORNEY NUMBER TWO SAYS

207
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:15,976
HELL NO.

208
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,779
>> THE IG REPORT, THERE'S FIVE

209
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,814
PEOPLE BEEN KICKED OFF THE

210
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:21,982
CAMPAIGN.

211
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,151
IF THERE'S FIVE PEOPLE BEEN

212
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,953
KICKED OFF THE CAMPAIGN OR OFF

213
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,220
THE MUELLER TEAM, HOW IS IT

214
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,855
POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE REST

215
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,823
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE, THEY

216
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,959
WERE ALL CLINTON DONORS.

217
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,860
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING

218
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,164
TO END UP FAIRLY.

219
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:37,864
I DON'T KNOW.

220
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,566
>> Laura: SHOULD WE LEARN THE

221
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,968
NAMES OF THESE ATTORNEYS WHO

222
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,803
WERE SENDING THESE MESSAGES WHO

223
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,404
WERE PART OF THE RESISTANCE?

224
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,073
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY.

225
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,108
UNLESS THEY ARE AND ARE

226
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,278
UNDERCOVER AGENT.

227
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,313
>> Laura: IT SAYS THEY ARE

228
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,581
ATTORNEYS.

229
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,750
>> THIS IS THE TYPE OF STUFF

230
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,451
THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS.

231
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,251
>> Laura: NOW I KNOW YOU HOW

232
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,586
YOU FEEL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

233
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,821
IT'S HAPPENING TO THE WHOLE

234
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:01,388
COUNTRY NOW.

235
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:05,892
THERE WAS ANOTHER ISSUE

236
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,794
INVOLVING FBI EMPLOYEES AT EVERY

237
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,562
LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION.

238
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,397
THIS IS FROM THE REPORT.

239
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,364
WITH NO OFFICIAL REASON TO BE IN

240
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,968
CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA.

241
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,036
WHO WERE NEVERTHELESS IN

242
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,270
FREQUENT CONTACT WITH REPORTERS.

243
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,573
THE LARGE NUMBER OF FBI

244
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,507
EMPLOYEES WHO WERE IN CONTACT

245
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,309
WITH JOURNALISTS DURING THIS

246
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:23,610
TIME.

247
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,014
IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY

248
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,617
LEAKS.

249
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,386
AND THEY WERE GETTING PERKS,

250
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:33,853
GETTING TICKETS.

251
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,455
>> THEY HAVE BEEN LEAKING LIKE

252
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,389
CRAZY.

253
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,157
THE PROBLEM IS THE IG REPORT

254
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:38,791
DISCOVERED THAT.

255
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,193
THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE YEARS

256
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:40,593
AGO.

257
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,228
BUT DON'T FORGET THE LEAK THAT

258
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,132
JUST OCCURRED LAST WEEK WHERE AT

259
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,766
MIDNIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF

260
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:51,170
JUSTICE SENDS OUT THIS DEVIN

261
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,405
NUNES AND PAUL RYAN HAD A CHANCE

262
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,573
TO READ DOCUMENTS AND THEY

263
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,007
DIDN'T READ THEM.

264
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,008
REMEMBER THAT?

265
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,777
THAT WAS A LEAK IN THE MIDDLE OF

266
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,178
THE NIGHT, IT MIDNIGHT PRESS

267
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,680
RELEASE SO THAT WE WOULD WAKE UP

268
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,981
IN THE MORNING AND HAVE TO

269
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,950
ANSWER ALL THIS NEW NARRATIVE

270
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,584
THEY ARE CREATING THE

271
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,952
REPUBLICANS ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS.

272
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,420
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING

273
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,787
WITH.

274
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,988
IT'S NOT AS IF THE LEAKS HAVE

275
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,555
STOPPED.

276
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,991
NOW THEY ARE DOING IT, THE FBI

277
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,025
PEOPLE WERE LEAKING.

278
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,560
NOW IT'S AT THE TOP LEVEL THE

279
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,261
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT'S

280
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,163
LEAKING.

281
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,398
>> Laura: THERE WAS A FEW

282
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,366
PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA DOWNPLAYING

283
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,367
ALL OF THIS GRANT WANT TO PLAY

284
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,803
FOR YOU A SHORT MONTAGE.

285
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,971
WATCH.

286
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,573
>> I EXPECTED A SLEDGEHAMMER.

287
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,443
WE GOT THE SAME KIND OF HAMMER

288
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,444
USED TO NAIL PAINTING ON THE

289
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:31,811
WALL.

290
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,846
I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW MILD IT

291
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,113
WAS.

292
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,847
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE ASSAULT ON

293
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,250
THE FBI THAT'S TAKEN PLACE,

294
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,852
THAT'S BEEN THE CALL OF SOME OF

295
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,922
THE OPPOSITION SAYING THESE ARE

296
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,255
CROOKS.

297
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:44,423
THEY ARE CORRUPT.

298
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,125
THEY TRIED TO THROW AN ELECTION.

299
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,960
THIS REPORT DOES NOT SAY THAT.

300
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,994
>> Laura: CONGRESSMEN.

301
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,162
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE ONE

302
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,664
GENTLEMAN ON THERE, THAT'S THE

303
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,332
GUY THAT IT IS ONE OF COMEY'S

304
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,967
BUDDIES WORKING AT THE FBI.

305
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,770
A LOT OF THESE AGENTS, THE OTHER

306
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,372
NETWORKS HAVE HIRED ALL OF THESE

307
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,173
FORMER FBI AND DOJ CLINTON

308
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,641
PEOPLE AND OBAMA PEOPLE AND

309
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,978
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

310
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,713
>> Laura: NOTHING THERE TO

311
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,080
SEE.

312
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,115
CONGRESSMAN, YOU STILL HAVE A

313
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,850
LOT MORE TO GET TO WITH THE

314
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,386
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

315
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,988
>> WE ARE ALMOST THERE.

316
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:16,521
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

317
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,489
THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY'VE

318
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,223
BEEN HIDING THESE DOCUMENTS FOR

319
00:09:18,223 --> 00:00:00,000
TWO MONTHS.
