the defense attorney for the mass shooter at parkland Florida is confirming reports that he has received a large volume of fan mail in addition to sexually explicit images and other notes from women and girls who find him attractive so let's go to that the suspect in the florida high school shooting that killed 17 is getting letters of support in jail including fan mail and pictures of scantily clad women in addition to hundreds of dollars in contributions to his commissary account the South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained copies of these letters including one from a woman who called the shooter beautiful and others with suggestive photos to give you an example of one of these letters by the way they're not letting him see these letters thankfully one of the letters says I'm an 18 year old I'm a senior in high school when I saw your picture on the television something attracted me to you your eyes are beautiful and the freckles on your face make you so handsome what is going on this isn't a new phenomenon I know it's not new it's not new but apparently the attorney who's representing in the public offender offender the public defender who is representing him said that you know they've experienced this before but not to this extent not with this volume and that's I think social media I mean I hate to always hang out on social media but I do think this age of so many different you know tributaries fitting into that river of communication that you can get to that guy I think these days there's just more of it because sort of as gray says it's not new the number of crazies out there who just want a piece of his weird Fame and that's the disturbing thing about it that these guys who do this crap and it's overwhelmingly guy guys I mean men so I say guys deliberately the guys are involved in these massacres and these horrible acts they're achieving a I know it's an infamy but it's also a Fame it is they're their pictures are plastered everywhere their manifesto that's found on Facebook is then read you feel like you get to know them in this awful way and that creates an aura around them and that aura is something that people respond to and in this now I go back to the technology in this day and age if I can use that phrase when you can get your message in so many different ways out to so many different places it just creates an even bigger aura around this guy so I see that as the phenomena as it plays out in this culture it's like this sinister cloud and that people get sucked into it for twisted reasons and it's actually I would say that I don't think it has that much to do with social media although we were more aware of it I think we have a heightened awareness because of through that a number of serial killers that we've talked about on murder with friends there will be people that will show up to their trial supporters that are that are fully fledged supporters that want to you know they get married behind bars and all this stuff happens I already cover when we cover Columbine I was doing research for that and I remember finding that there are active tumblr sites fan sites for those shooters those murderers and so I'm not surprised by this but I think that it sounds like his public defender is handling it in a responsible way I feel weird about even kind of talking about it for it to be a main news story because I'm really hesitant for this person for the shooter to get wind of this I don't want that I don't want there to be any validation of that sort I forgot that grace is an expert on me now they're in and these people who are involvement I mean it's her show murder with friends does talk about a lot of stuff so she is familiar with it I mean it's not a grim thing it is and it kind of all again like it is like that aura it all kind of comes with this like gross territory and there are people that will find that will become fans so okay and I don't mean to put you on the spot because you know you weren't expecting me to ask you these questions but the people who end up you know fantasizing about these mass murderers and these terrible people I mean are they mentally sound I are they every day people or you know in covering these stories and these mass murders the admirers like are they just normal average women who just it can be sometimes I mean I think it's sort of varies case-by-case there's usually some identifying factor within one of these figures within the infamy that I think they're sort of drawn in by that that they that they connect with and I and you sometimes it's you know up people that you're like oh that's kind of a crazy you know that whatever that means you know that's someone that would have this deviant interest but then a lot of times you'll just have people and I think men and women alike that out of nowhere align themselves with a murderer and maybe it's not something they would have ever expected and I maybe there's more research on it off the top I can't think of anything but it's a variety of people that will be drawn in I just think it comes down to how you handle that when you do have the this mass murderer behind bars making sure that he is not aware that he's growing a fanbase because I think that's where it gets really dicey and that's where you sort of get into you know sort of like the Manson isms and how he was able to cultivate a following even behind bars right right and you know people are donating their money toward his commissary that's like up to eight hundred dollars according to his public defender so that's what's going on but luckily you know it is being handled responsibly and it doesn't seem as though he is getting any type of access to this fan mail or this money if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash join get the whole younger so
