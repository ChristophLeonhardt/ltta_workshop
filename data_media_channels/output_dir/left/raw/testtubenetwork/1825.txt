00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,090
Following a terror attack on an Indian Air
Force base in January 2016, US President Barack

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,650
Obama urged neighboring Pakistan to “delegitimize,
disrupt, and dismantle” its terror networks.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,949
Although in his interview with the Press Trust
of India Obama did not directly accuse Pakistan’s

4
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,530
government of sponsoring terrorism, the country
has long been accused of harboring and funding

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,000
terrorists. Pakistan did end up being the
hiding place for one of the most notorious

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,629
terrorists in history, Osama bin Laden. But
perhaps due to necessary relations between

7
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:39,390
the US and Pakistan, the country does not
appear on the US’s official “State Sponsors

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,120
of Terrorism” list. In fact, only three
countries are currently on that list. So,

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,389
which countries does the US accuse of sponsoring
terrorism?

10
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:51,909
Well, since 1979, eight countries have occupied
a spot on the State Sponsors of Terrorism

11
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:57,829
list. These are: Syria, Libya, Iraq, Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, Sudan and the former South

12
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,979
Yemen. Five of these countries have since
been removed, most recently Cuba in 2015.

13
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:08,000
That leaves three remaining members: Syria,
Iran, and Sudan. Being on the list means that

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
a number of serious sanctions are levied against
the country. These include various controls

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,940
and bans on military supplies, including weapons
sales. There are also severe financial restrictions.

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,000
Terror sponsoring countries cannot get loans
from the World Bank, nor can any US citizen

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,800
do business with them without a license from
the Treasury department.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,490
The oldest member is Syria, which was one
of the first countries added in 1979, and

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,930
the only original country to remain on the
list. The designation was sparked by the oppressive

20
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,220
rule of Hafez al-Assad. Today, his son Bashar
al-Assad is believed to militarily support

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,290
Hezbollah in Lebanon, while terrorist network
grow within the currently war-torn Syria.

22
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,110
According to the US state department, this
has allowed foreign fighters to enter Iraq,

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,350
and possibly led to the formation of ISIS.

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,120
The next oldest member is Iran, which was
placed on the list in 1984. Similar to Syria,

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,840
Iran is believed to support US-designated
terrorist groups in Palestine, including Hezbollah

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,380
and Hamas. They are also thought to have funded
Iraqi Shia militias in support of the Assad

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,319
regime, and even sent Iranian Revolutionary
Guard members to Syria. Multiple senior al-Qaeda

28
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,889
members have been allegedly detained in Iran,
but their identities have not been released

29
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:22,569
and Iran has been unwilling to prosecute them.
In fact, the US believes that Iran has allowed

30
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,400
al-Qaeda operatives to move fighters and money
into South Asia and Syria.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,249
Finally, war-torn and politically unstable
Sudan was added to the list in 1993. According

32
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:37,209
to the US State Department, affiliates of
Hamas have been able to travel and fundraise

33
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:42,719
in Sudan with no repercussion from the Sudanese
government. Additionally,al-Qaeda inspired

34
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,359
groups see high Sudanese membership. Moreover,
multiple men detained in a terrorist training

35
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:52,560
camp, and one involved in the murder of two
US Embassy members, were released by Sudanese

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
authorities.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,139
However, many say that the US’s State Sponsors
of Terrorism list is outdated and incomplete.

38
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,829
Critics contend that rather than listing the
realistic sources of terrorism, these countries

39
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,700
are simply on the US’s bad side, and weak
enough that they are easy to shut out. Some

40
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,779
unlisted countries like Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia are more widely considered to have

41
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:19,159
links between terrorism and government officials,
but as they are US-allied, they are not targeted.

42
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,769
The U.S. has spent billions fighting terrorism
around the world. After over a decade, the

43
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,480
government is still paying for wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan. To learn just how much money

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:45,419
has been allocated to the War On Terror, watch
