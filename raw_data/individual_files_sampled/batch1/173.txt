- okay and you're in the stream today all about self-deleting messaging apps and encrypted messaging services the dark side perhaps of encryption Mallika I'm only could be LAN looking out for your live comments in our YouTube chat and on Twitter as always at AJ stream do you use apps like snapchat or perhaps signal or telegram share with us how you use them and why they're so important to you and I'll do my best to bring in as many of those conversations into today's conversation so many of us want privacy and security in our communication and there's several ways to achieve that here's one of those ways text messaging is often the fastest most efficient way for employees to exchange important information unfortunately traditional text messaging is unsecure at any given time there are multiple copies of every message floating around vulnerable to prying eyes the mobile phone companies keep a record the sender has one the receiver has one you get the idea this kind of Achilles heel insecurity cost companies millions each year and losses regulatory fines and public embarrassment luckily Tiger text has the solution tiger text is a fully encrypted easy to use solution for safe and secure messaging send confidential company data sensitive personal information documents and more worryfree with Tiger text end to end encryption Tiger text accelerates your company's communications by allowing critical information to travel faster and more securely than ever tiger texts can also help you comply with communication security regulations with one of the strictest security platforms available worried your text messages last forever tiger text messages will self-destruct after a designated period of time accidentally sent an erroneous message tiger text can be recalled with the swipe of a finger unsure your boss received your latest report confirmations tell you when your message has been delivered and read best of all it's a snap to get started so what could possibly go wrong with that well that self-deleting messaging app tiger text was adopted by an one police department in the United States and the police in question in Long Beach California may have used it to share sensitive and potentially incriminating information but they would not want to disclose in court since the investigation by Al Jazeera was made public some changes have happened in Long Beach Al Jazeera's Simon Bozeman filed this report for us explaining the latest the Long Beach Police Department announced the suspension of tiger text after an al jazeera investigation revealed allegations from former and serving officers that they had been instructed by their superiors to use the app that would automatically delete potentially discoverable evidence I was told that tiger text was to be used to have conversations with other officers that wouldn't be discoverable we wanted to keep our communications private on certain issues especially on officer-involved shootings or murder cases the police department denies those allegations the American Civil Liberties Union believes that by deleting the text messages the Long Beach Police Department may have breached the California records retention and evidence disclosure legislations potentially putting thousands of court cases at risk in response to the investigation the Long Beach Police Department issued a statement saying that the use of the app would be suspended effective immediately pending further review of whether the use is consistent with the city's record retention policy and as part of the review of internal communication practices the city will be reviewing best practices and current case law Simon Bozeman joins us now on set he's an investigative reporter for al-jazeera we're also joined in San Francisco by Eva galperin the director of cyber security at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and in Los Angeles by Mohammed as our national security staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union that's the ACLU of Southern California welcome to the stream everyone now Simon as we saw in your piece there your investigation has had immediate fallout and has led to more investigations which we will get into today questioning who should use these self-deleting messaging apps before we get into it though I want to go to Eva for a break down some of the terminology we're going to get into today clarification on self-deleting texts apps and into end encryption break it down for us Eva all right so frequently when people talk about secure messaging apps they sort of lump everything together they say the this messaging app is great because it's encrypted and sometimes they mix it up with this whole notion of self deleting messages now an end-to-end encrypted message as as we saw in the and the animation earlier is a message that cannot be read by the the company whose app you're using or the ISP it can only be read by the sender or the receiver of the message now self deleting messages are different and they're not necessarily encrypted though apparently with tiger texts they were both self deleting and encrypted messages and a self deleting message just disappears from your phone this doesn't necessarily mean that it has disappeared from the servers being run by by the company who's whose app you're using or the ISP it doesn't even necessarily mean that it's being deleted from from the phone of the person that you are sending your message to and it certainly doesn't mean that it can't be a screenshot or saved in some other way but it does protect against certain types of record retention policies which is what the police are particularly concerned about ok I'll be asking you questions later audience on Eva's description thank you Evo really appreciate that so back to this police department Simon how did you form from how do you stumble upon the story that they were using an app that meant that at some point the messages on it would totally disappear we were looking at a completely different story we were looking at the high number of officer-involved shootings in America by police forces on young black men and looking at that and there was a report back in 2015 called mapping gun violence that had long beach very close to the top of that list over police pumps I had per capita the largest number of officer-involved shootings a long beach is interesting because it's not particularly violent place it's not a particularly area of high poverty so we started talking to officers there and in other police forces around the world around the u.s. and very quickly when we speaking to serving officers and former serving officers in Long Beach they pointed out there was this app being used between the departments that are involved in officer-involved shootings primarily the homicide department and the internal affairs department and they pointed out this as that was being used where the any information between those two departments would just vanish and that could be pivotal to any family who wants to find out whether their loved one was killed by the police legally or correctly and so we started looking to that and that's where the story kind of grew from and some of the quotes in and that report that you you did the update from of extremely incriminating we deliberately use this so that other people couldn't track that we were using it I feel comfortable about saying that to officers we spoke to former and serving said that when they were given the app their superiors told them to use this app for information that they wouldn't want to be discoverable wow so that was why for us that was that was a stunning piece of information and from there we unraveled the rest of the use and how many people were involved and how widespread it had become within Long Beach Police Department so I mean so I want to share a comment we got from a resident of Long Beach who is not surprised at what your investigation revealed this is Don mode can she's the co-founder of black lives matter the Long Beach chapter and this is what she told the stream we are not surprised the Long Beach Police Department is hiding and deleting evidence Long Beach PD has a notorious history of abuse brutality militarization profiling of black and brown communities predictive policing and murder of 1152 people killed by police in the u.s. in 2015 Long Beach police were the fifth most murderous billions of residents tax dollars have been spent covering up their systemic abuse all of those cases need to be reopened investigation of their Tiger text used to discard evidence is merely affirmation for why we want our tax dollars better spent in Long Beach so Mohammed while Don may not have been surprised some of our community members are this is one person who tweeted in wait why are police departments using self deleting apps isn't that a violation of the Freedom of Information Act and as public servants aren't they required to preserve any and all communications Hamid that's exactly right I think the our principle problem at the ACLU with what the city of Long Beach was doing was that the use of these applications violates basic records preservation rules that ensure that the public has access to important records and information about how the government's function and these rules exist across the United States and are designed to provide a basic accountability mechanism for what the government is doing now in this case if the government uses these records these applications to immediately destroy these very same records that prevents the public from having access to what could potentially be incredibly important information and in this case information that it touches on the lives of so many people and has and concerns the foundational issue that's been a subject of a lot of debate and controversy in the United States and that is the issue of rampant police killings and so we effe so you are incredibly concerned about the use of this technology both by the city of Long Beach but also by governments across the country Simon a couple of bits of evidence here if anybody's dousing that this actually took place in your report you have an update email and it says Tiger Tech's secure messaging app and it says please feel free to resume communicating why the tiger texts have so let's go on to the secret channel no one can follow and then another one which is basically it's really simple it's a purchase order but the purchase order it's for a certain price it's for up to twenty five thousand and then it actually just details here the Tiger Tech's subscription license period from 2016 to 2017 is there anything wrong with the police department having this kind of app yes I mean I think if you had if you if we split the thing into if they had into Inc encryption method in apps and then they retained all records for the set period of time under California law and then handed them over during court cases as requested at the discovery phase and with all compliance legislation you could argue that using a system like this would be absolutely fine and but they chose a system which deletes the messages forever it can now no longer go back and get those messages and produce them in court or produce them in any kind of documental phase to say we have done nothing wrong you know the Long Beach Police Department said to us when we first told them we comply with all legislation on this we don't break any laws two days later they suspended all use and now they're doing a review of whether they're complying with all the laws they told us they were complying with its the two days later after your reporting that is the red flag that they knew that they weren't doing they arrived they had had tiger text since 2000 2014 up until 2018 that's hundreds and hundreds of cases that these this app was being used to communicate evidence around this a hundred and fifty odd officers within Long Beach Police Department had it out of the 290 phones issued to staff in Long Beach over half of them had the app to communicate with each other you will never know what they were talking about to each other that the the city's attorney the person who's legally responsible to ensure that the police are you applying with complying with all legislation didn't even know they had it he didn't know he had it until we told them that they had it the district attorney for the County of Los Angeles has just launched an inquiry through this and the same body that's doing the inquiry into Long Beach Police Department's the same inquiry group that investigate whether police killings illegal it's the judiciary and Oversight Committee so these are now a serious allegations against Long Beach Police Department whether they comply with their own legislation whether they would held em for evidence from any court cases and mohammad' all tell you now better than some I think it's going to be a very brave law that opens up hundreds and hundreds of prosecutions in Long Beach again because we don't know what these police officers were talking about you know Simon at the risk of echoing you here we have a tweet here and it really shows just the the gravity of this this is James reporter at the Los Angeles Times he says less than 12 hours after the al-jazeera report detailing its use of a self-deleting messaging app that could cause record retention discovery issues the city of Long Beach has suspended the use of Tiger Tech's Long Beach police had been using it since 2014 so really just echoing what you said there but even I want to bring you in here on this because secure communication seemingly is a good thing what's your take on this well privacy and security are two different things and both private and secure communications are good but ordinary citizens have different freedoms and obligations than the police department the police department is made up of police these people are public servants they have obligations to maintain records of the of the things that they are doing and their investigations in ways that ordinary citizens do not and it looks like they were using tiger texts specifically for the purpose of circumventing those obligations which is really disturbing so if we're looking at who should be using these apps and who should not be using these apps Mamet well I mean I think what's interesting here is that is that what we need to do is be able to sort of think a little bit strategically and a little bit sort of in a nuanced fashion about the technologies that are available to members of the public to the corporate sector the private sector as well as to governments and so what's important is to recognize as Abel was saying that there are different obligations and different requirements that we all share in these different spaces and so as members of the public or is a lone individual I have an interest in making sure that my communications with my spouse with my family members with my friends are private and that individuals whether sort of hackers government agents or or other sort of intruders don't have access to that information but I don't have that same obligation for the local police department who come who patrols my streets or or you know the housing authorities that I apply to get public housing from or from the taxman for who might provide all kinds of sense of information I want to make sure that their communications are recorded and are kept in a secure fashion so that they do not leak they are not compromised at any fashion so I think we really have to be able to understand how technology operates in this sort of multifaceted existence that we all live in so talk what's particularly interesting is what's particularly interesting is that governments and law enforcement including the FBI and police departments all over the US have insisted that that they should be able to backdoor these apps because they're being used by criminals and so they're perfectly fine with using with using these apps to circumvent their own obligations but they're not into the idea that they might be used by the people that they're trying to keep an eye on or that they're trying to catch we're in Long Beach was the amusing scenario now we always talk about the arms racing technology of of criminals and the law enforcement staying one step ahead of each other so if the criminals using something the real enforcement has to catch up what we may be entering in is to new era in which the government are trying to stay ahead of people like myself activists like Muhammad saying what are you doing and they're trying to stay ahead of our ability to keep an eye on their communications now which I think it's going to be an interesting challenge for the 21st century I'm trying to see what you really don't want is is a dynamic in which the people in power the people who have guns the people who have the power to imprison you have privacy and security and the ordinary people who might be activists or journalists are trying to hold them to account don't that is in fact the opposite of civil liberties this make us in a very mushy area where the criminals and the police are using the same technology and the public is using the same technology and they're all trying to keep secrets from each other yes and no I mean I guess I'd say that the it secrecy by itself is not bad right so secrecy deletion sort of privacy these are not bad concepts these are all really good depending on the context of how they come up so I'll give you one example so the government engages in a whole host of different surveillance and investigatory operations to keep tabs on members of the public even one members of the public aren't suspected of committing a crime so for instance if you drive in an intersection there might be a camera that tracks what cars drive that past that intersection that camera collects all manner of different sort of data about you and about members of the public would we want that data for instance kept in an insecure fashion that might leak in a way that would result in our movements and our sort of public private information disclosed to members of the public certainly not and indeed what I would suggest is that that information about sir about members of the public collected through surveillance technologies must itself be deleted if the government does not suspect you of a crime so in that context I'm for the deletion of government records however I'm against the deletion of government records when it violates laws that are designed to interrogate how government itself functions right so you can imagine between those two polls a sort of nuanced debate about when these records should be kept and when they should be deleted on the one hand records about how government works and on the other hand records about you and I and everything that we do that happens to be scooped out by the government and I think the punishments are up completely in equal because if the police department released my social security number or some piece of my personal information I can take action against that for breach of my personal data so when the Long Beach Police Department potentially break legislations on records retention it's it's almost like nothing is going to happen to them nothing legally will happen to them for that undertaking someone might lose their job you never know but nothing legally will happen to Long Beach Police Department now so I like the point about being able to take action if your information is leaked when it shouldn't be here's someone whose glasses perhaps have they say there can always be a reason for breaching your privacy be it a hack you're looking for data to sell or a government body because your name resembles a terrorist at the end I don't think anyone has is a privilege of privacy which is sad so in keeping that in mind I want you to take a look at this evil because this is what afros tweeted us in he's not the only one who's talking about this idea of a backdoor he says when fake messages are the reason for riots and lynching especially in India referencing whatsapp chains that are not fact checked and are then spread afro says backdoor access should be given there are no other way to stop this agenda but ordinary people should not be harassed or their messages should not be exposed so take us through the idea of a backdoor who should have access to that door the company or the government well I think that one of the biggest problems with with the demand for a backdoor is that when you have and encrypted messaging backdoor suddenly makes your end-to-end encrypted messaging no longer and to end encrypted it's no longer as secure as it was before and there's no way to guarantee that only the sender and the receiver are able to are able to get the message we have had a number of very high-profile weeks of government data and of of data from apps showing that if you if you build a backdoor it's not only going to be used by governments or law enforcement or whatever you think of as as the good guys it will inevitably be used by criminals by governments that you don't approve of it will be used by you know jealous boyfriends stalking their their exes there will be all kinds of very serious abuse and that is why any kind of backdoor is simply unacceptable because it destroys the entire premise of end-to-end encryption Mohammed I'm just wondering should to be a front door then the front door is the law they just you cannot use this if you're a public official well certainly what you cannot do is you cannot devise and mandate back doors and into otherwise secure communications we know that government the intelligence agencies in the United States and in the UK have tried to weaken encryption protocols and this is a really dangerous sort of push because not only for the reasons that every was talking about but also because the the ends here are pursuit of an agenda to to tackle a problem that on its face is incredibly rare so if the concerns are about terrorism for instance that concern the rates of terrorism are incredibly miniscule or in it the incidents of terrorism are incredibly rare in sort of in the Western world and yet the threat from weakening encryption has a natural consequence of sort of impacting literally all walks of life that we engage in whether it's communications with each other whether it's communications with lenders banks whether it's sort of data that's controlled by members by the government or all in all forms of digital life encryption is literally the sort of backbone of how this of how the digital age works and so threatening that in pursuit of a frankly a negligible sort of chance of an attack I think is a dangerous premise and something that we should not accept all right now Simon in the final seconds of our program lessons learned from your reporting and and the instant reaction that you got lessons learned everyone should fire their local police force and find out they're using some text messaging that is what a fire is go and ask them ask them and you know you know a result of what we've done they've stopped using it the local community now are incredibly aware of it and people like Mohammed he's keeping on top of them to make sure that they don't slip it back into how they operate thank you so much - Eva - Simon - Mohammed Malika what you want to leave us interesting conversation I will leave us with this suite from bando who says I used whatsapp in - in encryption there I live in the States I've converted more than a few American friends to use I love using it to communicate with friends overseas as well I believe we are entitled to our privacy and governments cannot be allowed to take that away this will not be the last time we have this conversation but for now we're wrapping it up Malika and I will see you online always a twitter at AJ stream until the next time thanks for watching you
