we start with two images the first an actual photograph of four presidents and their wives the photograph was taken by Paul Morse at the funeral for Barbara Bush in the center you can see George HW Bush behind him his son George and his wife Laura his arm around the Clintons on the edge Melania Trump and Michelle Obama arm an arm the other image you're gonna have to conjure for yourself the sitting president Donald Trump at mar-a-lago tweeting 29 times since Friday about Michael Cohen James Comey Michael Flynn the special counsel about a former aide that he calls drunk and drugged up loser and what he calls a third-rate reporter named Maggie Haberman he insists that she is someone who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with but there they are in the Oval Office she has interviewed him multiple times to talk more about all of this I want to welcome in my panel the co-founder of Foundry strategies and MSNBC political analyst Rick Tyler Pulitzer Prize winning White House reporter for The Washington Post and MSNBC contributor my friend Ashley Parker NBC News intelligence and national security reporter Ken Delaney inand White House correspondent for PBS Newshour and MSNBC contributor yummy Sh Allison door actually I'll give you the first word because this is the first time I've seen you on the air since on this show since you won your Pulitzer last week congratulations to you and all of your colleagues at the Washington Post but we've talked a lot about this theme that the president is isolated and and increasingly as time has worn on he seems to be more and more isolated I think it's certainly set into sharp relief for me that the difference between that photograph where he was obviously excluded and what has gone on over the course of the weekend do you think this is the most isolated time yet for this president yes and no I mean if you look at his West Wing in his White House there's been stunning turnover and not just across the board but some of these people who were really sort of comforts to him hope Hicks his trusted communications advisor Keith Schiller his longtime bodyguard who played a key role there a number of people who he really knew and was familiar with and liked that said he still does what he's always done which is he's always had a kind of small group of people around him and he still stays in touch with them late at night on the phone when he's down at mar-a-lago John Kelly has a stencil of broccoli so he's surrounded by people it might not be the people his chief of staff wants him to be surrounded by but he's not purely isolated Kendall e nian what what potential damage does the president done with these these tweets that have been sort of aimed across the board I think Chuck Todd was talking this morning on Meet the Press about how it feels like the the focus is you know Russia Russia Russia at the weight of this investigation sort of pressing down more on the president and the country as a whole you mean aside from damage to our national fabric Casey I mean look it makes him look guilty I think at the end of the day I mean the way he is continuing to attack anyone that he feels can hurt him in the Russia investigation anybody that seems to be a witness although interestingly he hasn't attacked Michael Cohen yet because he believes that his lawyer and longtime confidant may be on the fence and there may be a chance he could flip and there's a chance you might not flip and Donald Trump seemed to have words of support right this week you may just weigh in on this question I mean what was your take I mean we watched and talk too much and we'll talk a little bit more about Barbara Bush later on in the show but sort of the the the dignity and grace that that she showed on the national stage and the contrast with you know the events of the last year I think there are two things the first is there is this kind of stunning moment where President Trump said people keep saying I'm gonna fire Robert Mother I'm gonna fire - Rob Rosenstein and then Rosenstein and then but they still are here there's still people that are working and I haven't fired them and that it felt like for a couple of moments there I would say I won't venture to say a whole day that people thought oh these people are gonna have their jobs they're not gonna go anywhere and then Friday night when he starts tweeting about James call me setting off the special invest investigation and special counsel and he talks about this idea that like it's built off of an illegal act so what does that mean it started to feel like okay so is he now building a case or dropping crumbs for why he's gonna fire these two men and why he's gonna try to stop this investigation that's there's that one thing the other thing is that during a few right well well everyone was watching the bushes while everyone was kind of reminiscing on what the quorum is like and how beautiful the the casket is just like disco every that's in the nation as a whole was kind of pausing to think about all of those things you had Donald Trump go on a rant of all rants that really show that the Republican Party is in completely different hands now this is not the bushes and as much as people might have made fun of George Bush and he had his own issues with Katrina and the war in Iraq people never thought he was someone who just didn't have any decorum who just kind of was tearing away like he said at the National certainly I think you're right there has been some George W Bush nostalgia that has some people maybe papering over some of the things that we we remember of his presidency at the time I mean we Tyler what's your take on that I think you Misha's point is a good one that perhaps it is you know those people in the photograph who are gonna be the ones that are permanently outside the frame many of those people ran against each other but they were they were still able to appear in the same room at the same time they hadn't diminished or demean themselves to the point where it just would be embarrassing now the White House a little bit of cover saying you know the Secret Service would have created a disruption on the funeral and it would have but I think Trump's presence there would have created a much larger destruction disruption and I do think the Bush's who I've disagreed with many many times but it's hard to argue that they aren't honorable people I remember visiting the bush library which you couldn't argue as a propaganda place but perhaps any president everyone it's the best history possible I read a letter by George HW Bush to his boys during Watergate and he was very concerned about the way his boys would perceive Watergate and it was a father instructing his younger sons and it was about character and honor and and dignity and we're lacking that in this White House right now so speaking of those tweets in a series of other tweets throughout the weekend the president is questioning the legality of the special counsel claiming that James Comey illegally leaked classified documents he also slighted his own attorney general quote GOP lawmakers asking sessions to investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton good luck with that request meanwhile The Washington Post reports jeff sessions warned the White House he might have to his job if President Trump fired his deputy rod Rosenstein on the call reportedly to Don McGann last weekend sessions expressed to the difficult position it would put him in the call came after Rosenstein approved the raid on Cohen's offices and home Kendall a nyan what are the ramifications of these potential Domino's if sessions really does think well if frozen Stein goes I'd have to resign to I personally do not think that the Congress would approve another Attorney General in first place but that aside I mean it seems like that would in fact spark the crisis based on this absolutely it certainly wouldn't approve an attorney general without that person promising to continue the mauler investigation as it's happening so but leaving that aside I mean actually one of the things the implications of this sessions threatening to resign was I was wondering is that is that a motivating factor for Donald Trump to make this happen right that would absolutely cause a crisis in Congress and in the executive branch now Donald Trump could put acting people in who could potentially remove robert muller but as James Comey said many times this week you you would have to fire the entire Justice Department and the entire FBI to make this investigation go away the documents the findings those would just simply go if Muller was removed they would go to US Attorneys offices the FBI what it is but every few days or so or at least every week we seem to get a new round of okay the president is about to prepare to do this or another report that says you know we thought about firing Muller at such-and-such additional time where does that stand right now how secure is rod Rosenstein well I think first to understand that we sort of have to put it in context which is the president often sort of floats ideas and bounces things off of aides and friends and says you know I'm so fed up with him I think I should fire him what do you think do you think I should fire him and that doesn't and that doesn't mean it's necessarily going to happen and as you Mitch mentioned earlier he said in that press conference you know look people have been writing these stories for four or five months and these two men are still here aren't they and that's true and there is sort of an adage people say pay attention to what the president says not what he does although sometimes he he does do the thing he is saying such as firing James Comey so it it's tenuous right and you bring up Comey as well I mean and I want to play a sound bite that we have from Susan Collins on Meet the Press this morning because it seems to me that in some ways Comey did some damage to himself over the course of the last week tickler I cannot imagine why an FBI director would seek to essentially cash in on a book when the investigation it's very much alive he should have waited to do his memoir I think this is an interesting assessment from a senator who is by all accounts you know carried some antipathy towards Donald Trump and she raises a question we talked about this initially that does this potentially and Ken Delaney and I'm interested to know your opinion on the impact on the investigation but politically Rick Tyler do you think that that James Comey did himself well over the course of the last week is he did he survive politically as the stand-up courageous guy that he set out to paint a portrait of in his book no I think it's kind of a break even but we have to remember something in James Comey was fired they took away a man's career a prosecutorial career that went all the way back to when he work for rigidly I mean before that so they took away his career they also disparate besmirched him publicly so I think he had a right to come out and make his case and his case couldn't be done in sound bites I've read his book I disagree with some of the things Comey has done and said did he make a mistake and he seems to think he maybe made a mistake in writing about the size of the president's hands it's hair some other things look I'm sure the publisher had more to do with that book it does give a justification of why he did a separate press conference from the Justice Department about reopening the investigation of Hillary Clinton's Emo's which I profoundly disagree with but he has a rationale for that and people didn't decide on their own but I think on balance he probably broke even it can is your take that he potentially did any damage to himself as a witness potentially for Bob Muller or not I think that there's a potential for that absolutely I mean in terms of the impact of the investigation I think that if Muller didn't want this to happen really put his foot down it have happened so it's not that these words are going to sort of interfere with the investigation but the damage that he may have done to his credibility with as you say you know going to the size of Donald Trump's hands and the color of his skin and and just appearing to be cashing in although I agree with everything we're excited I think Susan Collins is raising a fair question to the extent that he is a crucial witness in any obstruction of justice case to be made against Donald Trump I think this could do some damage yeah and you Miche with the memos coming out after the book was released I mean the memos do seem to add credibility to you know whatever may have been taken away from him from you know his references that some people interpreted as yeah maybe below the belt takes the memos coming out and Republicans were clamoring for them it seemed to in some ways damaged the Republican case and bolster commis credibility would you say that's right I'm not sure because I think it's so it was such a partisan response to these to these memos you had Republicans jumping and running saying look it shows that this is not obstruction of justice you had Nancy Pelosi tweeting actually this shows that Donald Trump has a contempt for the rule of law I think as a reporter I saw someone not only of course we knew about all the details in the memo but there's this part where Comey were James Comey basically says that yeah I told him I would give him honest loyal tea we had heard that before but then he says well he called me back maybe a couple months later a couple weeks later and said you know member that thing about let's see I told you about it and James Comey basically says like oh yeah I remember that and it to me it tells you that James Comey is trying to hold on to his job he's trying to outlast this presidency he's thinking of his career saying ten years down the line I want this to be a whole thing that I can close and I can I can serve but in reality I think that if he's looking back he's probably I think doesn't feel as great at the idea that he had that loyalty held hanging over his head because the the memos don't paint him as someone who's saying Donald Trump you cannot say that this is completely unethical that's just not there so I don't know if it's really helped his credibility actually what's your take on that do you think that the memos have bolstered commis stature in case across the board or as you meet right I don't know that's a good question I mean my understanding and again I'm not a legal expert is that those sorts of memos that are written extemporaneous Lee can be used basically as as proof of something having happened and and they would be very valuable to robert muller and his team of investigators and the memos sort of do both bolster his account of what did happen he sort of been very consistent in that and what leaked out in the news reports and what we then saw but as you me said I do think everything is sort of at this point seen through a partisan lens so people will sort of pick and choose what they want to take from that I also came out in response to Republican investigators who who want these hundreds of thousands of perhaps millions of documents that Rosenstein has no hope of fulfilling at any time and which will set up a pretext of why he needs to be fired and there's talk of the Republicans trying to enrage him so he sends okay then I'll send over the Comey memos which he does and what happens within one hour they are leaked I mean these supposedly illegal classified memos are now everybody gets to read them there they're a whole lot of nothing really and you know so what do you think the FBI's what do you think is gonna happen when the FBI sends over a million documents many of which will be classified they're gonna leak yeah well that's what Capitol Hill's best at sometimes as we mentioned the president has tweeted 29 times since Friday we know certainly I know it can be hard to keep up so we here at KCDC distilled them to under 20 seconds for you and oh we put them in the president's own words almost Nancy Pelosi called numbers James Comey which on Maggie Haberman Sylvester a little drunk drugged up the Washington Post kim
