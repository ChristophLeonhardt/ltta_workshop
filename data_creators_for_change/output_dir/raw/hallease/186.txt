3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,599
of vlogging every day in August because

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,549
you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna explain myself do</font>

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,079

have to get paid and sometimes I'm lazy

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,449
so there I said it there's the real

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,790
reason and I work too but it's probably

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,030
like eighty percent laziness so sorry

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,610
