personal favorite a story about how Republicans are quickly abandoning the tax cut messaging in their campaigning no good don't wanna ask him if they're all right they're heard dog okay and we will talk throughout this show about it's on the soundboard okay so watch out the number of times I referred to that will be astronomical I'm just giving you a warning ahead of time Ari Casper take it away right cNN has obtained some of the audio that Michael Cohen had recorded during his discussions with Donald Trump now the recent story has everything to do with a Playboy model former Playboy model that Donald Trump allegedly had an affair with and that allegation is true that's true yes he had an affair with her and and the the tape that we will have you listen to in just a minute will prove just that but this particular audio has to do with Karen McDougal again former Playboy model who had an affair with Donald Trump and of course Donald Trump had denied any involvement with her denied any efforts to offer her money to hush her up so we're gonna give you the details give you some context before we toss to that audio just before Election Day just before Election Day The Wall Street Journal had actually broken a story uncovering a secret deal with the National Inquirer to buy the silence of a former Playboy model that's Karen McDougal who said she had an affair with Donald Trump and his campaign issued a denial of that in fact hope Hicks specifically said we have no knowledge of any of this the claim of an affair was totally untrue now fast-forward to today and we have audio the audio recording of Trump and Cohen relates to whether Trump should buy the rights of the story from American media that is the parent company of National Enquirer which paid mcdougal 150 thousand dollars in August in 2016 for her story about an alleged 10 month affair with Trump the story was never published by Ami now that is a strategy known as catch and kill they are supporters of Donald Trump which is why they didn't publish that story and again Trump claimed that he had absolutely no knowledge of any of this well here's the audio that CNN obtained and it seems as though in his conversations with Michael Cohen right before the election he knew exactly what what was going on I need to open up a company or the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so that I'm gonna do that right away I've actually come up on TV and I just broke into Allen weiselberger about how to set the whole thing up with a finding that yes and it's all the stuffing all the stuff because here you never know where that company you never know what he was good he gets it correct so I'm I'm all over that and I spoke to Alan about it when it comes time for the financing which will be listed what financing oh my god okay so there's a lot that comes out of that tape number one is what Ana was referring to we're done with alleged affair clearly he had the affair clearly paid her off it's right there in the tapes there's no question about it okay so we're done with that portion of the story by the way evangelical voters that voted for him I hope you're proud that is yet another affair that is now confirmed that he had by the way his wife had just given birth and and that's when he was having that affair back in the day and he is such a slimeball that he's paying people off not to talk about his extramarital affairs but I I hope you're proud I know you think God works in mysterious ways and has picked the what George will said basically slime to to represent you guys hey you said you were worried about Bill Clinton and morality in the Oval Office okay I assume that you're apologizing right now to every progressive you ever met I'm so sorry I was just kidding I don't care about morality in the Oval Office at all morality and the president I kind of hate it I love immorality just admit it if you're an evangelical voter and move on with your life okay you never cared about morality it was always a lot okay now on of the parts that might or might not be illegal so as you see there they're talking about payments first before we get to the cash or no cash which gets to the potential may be illegality I love that Cohen's like so American media their owners of National Enquirer paid $150,000 to until the story is an appointed out and and Cole was like now we got to pay him back that's kind of how it works and Trump's like what financing yeah okay well you've done this before but every time you bring up as something that he has to face like I don't know how to pay hey I don't talk about and then cause like we asked them to basically he's implying we asked him to kill the story you gotta now pay him and he's like fine and then we get into the question of whether it's cash or not right exactly I mean Trump is notorious and this is based on what people close to Trump have said about him he's notorious for not wanting to pay for anything even when you know the payment would actually secure you know his presidency or his election from from a scandal that could you know really hurt him he doesn't care so here Michael Cohen yes you're right is is encouraging him hey we got a we got to pay and my back and then let's talk a little bit about the cash component of it because there's there seems to be some disagreement so Trump's camp is saying that no Trump did not suggest financing this in cash Michael Cohen's camp is saying that is not true Trump wanted to finance this in cash but Michael Cohen is you can clearly hear in that audio indicated that he wanted to create a an organization a company to kind of funnel this money through to kind of hide the payment right now that's relevant for a number of different reasons and we'll get to that in just a second but first here is Rudy Giuliani responding to the audio and saying that Trump no they said nothing about paying in cash I agree with you to say it's a little bit hard to hear but I assure you that we listen to it numerous numerous times and the transcript makes it quite clear at the end that President Trump says quote don't pay with cash Cohen dent interrupts and says no no no I got it and then you hear distinctly if you're careful and you slow it down check and then Cohen follows with no no no and then quickly cuts off the date which indicates exactly where she was saying that Cohen doesn't want the rest of the court because it was to expel fitori from point of view the press there's no way the president is gonna be talking about setting up a corporation and then using catch unless you're a complete idiot any chance president that idiot yeah no we have our answer right there he just accidentally admitted it I mean no there's no way you would do that unless you're a complete idiot check we already know that the president total complete idiot he did look even though he's done this before and that's why I'm telling you people do not that know or understand the depth of how stupid Donald Trump is he's done these kind of payments before but every time you come to me is like what financing all right let's paint in a you know suitcase full of cash because like no we set up a company we've funneled the money through it so that we at least have the veneer of legality right right and he's like oh right right right okay so that's part one part two it in right now what Giuliani said is if you couldn't we just played you the tape and if you want you can go back and rewind and it is to look in my opinion it is not perfectly clear when Giuliani says he clearly says that we don't pay in cash Trump says we don't pay in cash that's not clear at all no I listened to it about ten times and what I heard is we'll have to pay with cash right but if you say Yanni and I say Laurel I hear your brother okay so I understand that and any you might bring your own biases and I might bring my own biases into it and it is what Trump says is a little muddled it is not perfectly clear either way but now let's talk about the context that gives us clues as to what people might have said remember Cohen is the one who recorded it and while he's recording it he knows he's recording it so he's not going to want to admit the illegal things that's why when Trump says in my opinion we'll have to pay in cash he goes no no no no it cuz he knows he's on tape Trump doesn't know he's on tape and so Cole goes no no no no let's set up a company etc that's a great point yes and nobody talks about that now by the way the tape is cut this is not I don't give a damn about Michael Cohen and I have no interest in protecting all I want to do is find out the truth right and if you say you don't like Trump you're goddamn right I do it so I'm very clear about my perspective but it might be the Kohen cut the tape not because the rest showed how innocent Donald Trump is right now technically Cohen hasn't even turned on Donald Trump I mean it's obvious he's going to but he hasn't yet so it's not like he's even necessarily negotiating with prosecutors yet he hasn't been charged yeah look we don't have any confirmation that he's already working with prosecutors but we already know that he has turned on Trump and so Cohen's attorney is making media appearances and and saying some pretty damning things about Trump yeah I hear you on that but I don't think his main thing and cutting the tape is because it would have shown that Donald Trump is innocent I'd like you to find that Dave okay I like anybody to find that day it doesn't exist he might have cut off the tape because that Michael Cohen might have said things that were illegal afterwards he might have talked with Trump about okay look we can't do it in a suitcase with Tripp cash you knucklehead but even if we set it up through these ghost companies this shady business and that's why you might have cut the tape because it ain't implicates him as well but it right now the tape that is presented by Michael Cohen implicates Donald Trump so Lanny Davis who is the attorney for Michael Cohen did a few media appearances namely with Cuomo on CNN and I thought what he had to say about utilizing cash was interesting and also accurate so take a look Richard Nixon couldn't spin the tape that did him in and there's no way that mr. Giuliani who knows from being US Attorney the only people who use cash or drug dealers and mobsters cash is not what you do and it was Michael Cohen who said no no no no so as Jake had mentioned yeah he said no no no no because he knew he was being recorded which even I I didn't really think about that you're right I see it mentioned almost nowhere else but it's obvious that he knows he's recording okay so two things about Lanny Davis number one huge Clinton supporters so that's why Anna's right we already know cones flipped on Trump in in just the lawyers that he is hired and here's Lanny Davis cones attorney attacking Giuliani Trump's attorney so they are obviously fighting there's no question about that now to Trump you know this is based on stories that we have done we've shared with you guys whether it was using you know undocumented immigrants for his jobs whether he was using the same attorneys as mobsters and and associations with those same officers etcetera what appears on its face to be money laundering involving the Russians for decades I think Donald Trump is a lifelong criminal so that's why he thinks maybe I should pay it in cash like no rational human being doing a business deal in today's environment would be like hey maybe I should go banking withdraw a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash no one in their right mind does that unless they're doing some sort of criminal activity but again you could listen to that tape and think he's saying that no we're not gonna do it in cash but what you cannot conclude is oh they didn't buy off Susan MacDougall's sounds because they clearly clearly did Karen McDougal sorry Karen McDougal there's so many women though I mean it's hard to hear what did I did I say Susan Susan that's funny cuz that's a white water person okay so can we talk a little bit more about the cash versus setting up a corporation thing because what I'm curious about is look yes you're right that you know the mobsters usually use the tactic of using cash to pay people off but whether he's using cash or setting up this this corporation isn't paying off someone in a way to or paying a media organization to catch and kill a story isn't that some sort of violation of campaign laws any type of law I mean it just seems so shady yeah so it totally depends so if you had a relationship and you don't want your wife to find out about it and you just want to pay the person hundred fifty thousand dollars not to talk my guess is that that is not illegal okay if you do it right before an election and you do not reveal who is giving 150 thousand dollars and if it's not Donald Trump it's worse okay because then that is a in kind campaign contribution so then you get into a thicket of was it Donald Trump who gave 150,000 dollars was it technically one of these companies that shell companies they set up was it David pecker who runs American media and and made the deal in the first place so that's where you might get into some illegalities so there's the obvious lies that's just a political issue and then there if it was just a payout not at all related to campaigns you might have some legal issues but not as many since it's right in the middle of a campaign you have a lot more legal issues and that's what they're gonna have to sort out exactly so that is you know that is an interpretation that I've heard and I'm always curious to see how conservatives are responding to all this stuff because you hear - you've heard excuse after excuse in terms of what Trump is done how he's done it it seems as though he's gotten away with pretty much everything however Judge Napolitano has been openly critical of Trump and he was also asked about the legality of this whole situation involving Karen McDougal so I want to go to Napolitano's analysis of this this is video 5 so I'm skipping ahead let's take a look at what he had to say there doesn't appear to be the indication of any crime but I think that's the wrong analysis there is an indication of a fraud and the significance of that is if the client and the lawyer discussed the commission of a crime or discuss the commission of a fraud there is no attorney-client privilege in that conversation meaning the tape can be used by anybody who can get their hands on it for any purposes which would include which would include biomotor MacDougal if she's suing the precedent which would include Bob Muller if he's investigating the president now what's the fraud the conversation is about paying national is about paying national enquirer to pay mcdougal 150 thousand dollars to buy her story and to lead her to believe that the National Enquirer is going to publish her story but they aim here is to bury the story by duping her into selling it to them and then not publishing that failure to be truthful to her and the involvement of Donald Trump and Michael Kohn in that decision is the fraud I say that's not a criminal fraud it's a civil fraud I think the president's something to worry about yes you do yes I do based on if there's a no attorney-client privilege than all his communications about these subject matters with Michael Cohen go right to Bob Muller and to do with whatever he's gonna do with it yeah so let me fill that out just a little bit more cuz I and I those are great points I keep getting credit than their balls out on Fox News but he's earned it he's being honest so she could bring a civil suit saying hey America media told me they were gonna publish the story on top of that they said that I was gonna get a column and I was gonna kid and I was gonna be on the cover over and over again that was part of what they were paying me for and you can tell if they were honest or not one we have the tapes it's already done we already know that the whole thing was a scheme to cover it up but number two they never published any columns they never put her on the cover they never did any of the things that they said so it's an excellent case to bring a civil lawsuit and in this case they do civil fraud which is clear on the tape no matter what you think you said about cash in which case all this is admissible now the thing is it probably would have gotten in anyway but Rudy Giuliani is and Trump or such morons that they weighed their attorney-client privilege on these tapes yes and and I was thinking even at this late juncture I thought do they know something I don't know like I wonder why they did that no the answer is simpler they're dumb how do I know that because today Giuliani came out and said dad do we make attorney-client privilege oh you schmuck oh you're so stupid why did you waive it earlier you can't walk back you know the actions that you've already taken pertaining to attorney-client privilege remember the first sign of ignorance from the Trump camp was when Trump went on Fox & Friends and totally minimized the the legal relationship that he had with Michael Cohen and you know the hosts on Fox and Friends were like oh no like just trying to get him to walk his statements back during that interview because it was gonna hurt him legally moving forward he didn't walk it back because they didn't know any better yes so now today Giuliani talking about like I don't know what these tapes are even out I mean there's attorney-client privilege oh wow wow they're so incompetent by the way there's things that are out in the open that people are ignoring because I don't know it's uncomfortable they don't want to say things that are obvious anything all the professional lawyers almost all the professional lawyers that Donald Trump had have already left the building that's why he's with clowns like Rudy Giuliani who are mainly political actors right and apparently buffoonish once the fact that several of his high-profile actual professional attorneys have quit is amazing if you're defending the President of the United States that's a career building career-defining case you don't voluntarily walk out of it unless your hair is on fire you're like this guy is both total moron and totally guilty I gotta get out of here so they've all left the building that's Oh that leaves Giuliani and him going huh i waived the privilege I met privilege I'm a privilege oh no okay total clown show so what is the response from Donald Trump he has decided to attack Michael Cohen on Twitter so let's read a few of those tweets right now he said what kind of lawyer would tape a client so sad is this a first never heard of it before why was the tape so abruptly terminated and then in parenthesis cut presumably saying positive things I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad so look remember prosecutors rated Cohen's property they've obtained all of this audio I believe 12 tapes in total so whether it's edited or not we'll find the truth in the end and so I'm curious to see how this all plays out but so far it's not looking good for Trump I mean just based on that tweet you're right he is just shaking in his boots and doesn't know what to do I mean he's not even really responding to the con of that audio he's doing character assassination against Michael Cohen so let me tell you why he's so scared of it in one side I have to note before we get to that one we just gotten used to a president who writes tweets saying so sad too bad you're so right like what normalize that he's being a total child buffoon anyway now when he said what kind of a lawyer would table client a lot of people have already said this I'm not the first to say it but like the kind of client who doesn't try it kind of lawyer that doesn't trust their client yeah and knows their client is both a criminal and will turn on him at some point that's kind of the situation we're in so finally why is Trump so panicked if it's civil fraud and he's probably not gonna get brought up on charges you eat like I said there might be some campaign finance violations no he's worried about the 11 other tapes hmm this is the first tape this is it this is like an appetizer at one of those French restaurants where they bring you like this tiny tiny little appetizer they're like enjoy no no you're about to get a seven-course meal or apparently a 12-course meal there's 12 tapes now others are much worse we haven't yet hit bruh chard we don't I don't know if she's in the tapes but that's the former Playboy model who they say Donald Trump didn't sleep with oh that's when they serve you the bitter greens but okay but I will say this if they if Bashar does on the tapes that's the one they say no Trump didn't sleep with her broidy there his finance guy slept with her and didn't pay her 150 or 130,000 paid her 1.6 million she happened to get an abortion but that's not necessarily connected unless it's in the tapes yeah look I I don't know we'll see we'll see oh by the way or a hundred other criminal things that Donald Trump has done so this is the tip of the iceberg I can't wait for the iceberg well I want to leave you with this for people like jank who have heard these audio tapes and read these stories and and are starting to be swayed by this content a Donald Trump has a message for you you said this quote what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening that is the defining quote of Donald Trump okay but I believe your lying eyes yeah I actually I'm glad you reminded me cuz I actually do there is one more tape that that we got it's and it just has a very simple message on it it says I heard Donald Trump was backing into it as he was say by the way if you don't know Jason Spencer that guy Sacha Baron Cohen punked quit today he resigned and I heard it his resignation speech he just had one word just having fun folks Donald and anyway we'll see all right we got to take a break when we come back what the White House is doing to avoid any transparency of Trump's interactions with foreign leaders alright back on The Young Turks lots of comments I'm Lawrence Royce in on YouTube super chat it could also be cash meaning paid off rather than financing it with a loan like Cohen did with stormy Daniels fair point I wanted to make sure that you guys heard that Sandra santamarina rights in any update on the Android app getting tired a slice scared of sneaking on my boss's iPad hashtag team Android first of all man you're the bomb you I mean risking getting fired to make sure that you could listen to The Young Turks gibberty that's amazing man so thank you Sandra so of course shop D y-t-dot-com for merchandise Basenji will get one for free lots of people saying nice things about Anna Reed those real quick Eva pieces Anna's makeup is so beautiful today much love kelan Whitaker says Anna looks so great in purple this is all YouTube super chat but a couple tweets coming out for you too last one from the super chat Erica DuPont says my little eight-year-old TYT soldier Alena got our first TYT shirt and she's ecstatic she can't wait to show everyone and quote roast Trump she put a pic on Twitter to show her favorite host jank Anna and jr. okay when jr. is back and jerry' made a great point during the the break about Donald Trump's cash cash who asked about paying in cash in any transaction right right like even if he said don't pay in cash why do you normally pay in cash right like and I was and I was talking to him during the break real quick I was saying if I talked to anyone at the Young Turks to somebody said hey we got a deal with an advertiser or somebody and I said don't pay in cash you'd be like what why the hell would we pay in cash right so obviously they do shady things all the time over there and that two comments that are great from Twitter the four got ten arm rights in pretty sure the reason Cohen was recording Trump wasn't to have leverage over Trump but to have a vocal order from Trump telling him to spend the money Trump has a long history of not paying people back sir Cohen may have been ensuring his payment great point that is a great point also I mean think about it I mean different scenarios obviously but remember when Comey had all those interactions with Trump and then immediately wrote memos which he then you know leaked I mean why did he do that it was because he knew that there was a possibility that things would blow up and Trump would lie about those interactions yeah and I feel like you know that could have been a motivating factor for Michael Cohen as well yeah and you know what you also get a t-shirt because that's a good point we hadn't thought of so bless your heart thank you for being part of this show I love it so last one Johnny I keep Johnny I can't read your

anybody else doing it did you see anybody else interviewing all of them doing all those videos nope okay t y-t-dot-com /join okay Anna what's next alright the White House is taking more steps in avoiding transparency especially when it comes to Donald Trump's conversations with foreign leaders so according to recent reporting the White House will no longer publish summaries from president Trump's calls with world leaders and there are read about which are historically you know put out by the White House so reporters can kind of keep an eye on what's going on how what these conversations are really about now the phone conversations rarely contain news but are the only proof or heard of such a call taking place they are distributed internally and often contain descriptions of what was discussed so this all started to kind of unravel back in mid-june when the White House was you know releasing these readouts that really didn't have much detail at all so the last redoubt was published by the White House on June 16th and contained a vague three sentence summary of Trump's call with the Hungarian Prime Minister but you know now they've decided yeah we're not gonna do any of these readouts anymore period now this is problematic because oftentimes when there are calls with let's say Trump and a world leader there could be two sides to the story that was the case when Trump had a call with Justin Trudeau in regard to trade negotiations Trump Trump's White House made it seem as though they had this great amicable discussion when in reality well I'm inclined to believe Justin Trudeau but Justin Trudeau claims that the call was a little more combative so it's hard to get the u.s. is narrative or perspective on these discussions if the White House is refusing to be transparent about it there's another component but Jake I want you to jump in yeah so apparently my call with candidate Trump talked about how Canada burned down the White House which of course they never did when the White House was burned down Canada did not even exist where did he get that from because the English came from what is now Canada oh okay oh they controlled it back then Canada would not exist for another 50 years and the English came down and burned down the White House but so what does he know he doesn't know anything yes so he comes on well you know you guys buried naturally your national security to it that's why I to do tariffs and patrols like national security threat so you remember where you burned down the White House and Trudeau was like no I don't remember that because I didn't happen great but but that goes to the heart of this story which is he doesn't want you to have the transcript or even summaries because then it was show that he's lying there is absolutely no pushback from Republican lawmakers about this story none zero there's absolutely no Republican pushback about Trump's uh you know executive power how he flexes executive power how he issues executive orders I mean there was so much controversy about Obama using executive actions they thought that it was it was just the wrong way to go about things but Trump has been doing things unilaterally no pushback from Republicans but to be fair Anna I'm not sure that they that the Republican would have been hypocritical about other things like Trump's Affairs and payoffs to his mistresses if Obama had had multiple affairs while his wife had just given birth and was paying people off during campaigns I'm sure the Republicans would have let it slide oh yeah definitely I mean it's and then of course the you know the Supreme Court issue where they're trying to rush Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation when they did the exact opposite when it came to Merrick garland because it was an election year anyway the list goes on and on but there's another part of this that I really want to discuss because it's just incredible how the White House also tries to alter transcripts and omit certain things that make Donald Trump look bad so for instance when Donald Trump had his joint press conference in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin Vladimir Putin was asked whether or not he wanted Trump to win the election here is the video to Waddle president were helped to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that yes because he talked about bringing the us-russia relationship back to normal the White House has admitted that Armen has basically taken out that interaction from the official White House transcripts okay it goes to the heart of who Donald Trump is both a liar and stupid we already saw the whole world saw it we all have it on tape so he's a no no I got it you just when Putin said he wanted me to win you just take it out of the transcript no I know we've all seen it and maybe I'm I'm wrong but tell me what you think about this perspective I don't think it's about convincing Americans about what's really going on today I think it's about basically taking hold and controlling the narrative for history like for for us history in the future right so if it's not in the official you know White House transcripts did it really happen sure there'll be video of it but who knows I just feel like it's time to whitewash everything I hear you Anna and it's and it's a great point a lot of people have already called it Orwellian because it is the government says do not listen to your ears and do not believe your eyes so bow your head okay and and it's also the technical definition of politically correct both the Soviets and the Nazis would say yes that is technically correct but it is not politically correct so you should strike that from the record and they would not allow you to use certain language etc so in this case they go well it is obviously factually correct that Putin said that but it is not politically correct that he said that so remove it from the transcript but it's such a ham-handed is it ham-handed or fisted either way a ham-fisted way of doing that right because it's not 1948 it's not night you know it's not the old days where the government just wipes it off and no one knows maybe some guy wrote it in a newspaper working you could easily deny it it's the year 2018 we all see it we already saw it so to try to wipe the record clean you cannot do that as in this day and age but he's too stupid to realize that all it does is exposes you further but I had even better news so he in so he wipes that away because he's obviously guilty and he's trying to cover up his guilt but the more important part of this story is there is no summary of his one-on-one meeting with Putin he would not allow oh the schmuck admitted things when he was with Putin I don't know how we're gonna find out I don't know if it's because of the translators I don't know if Muller can somehow get his hands on that information and you know Trump he's such an idiot asuras lawyers that maybe they'll bungle it it right into the prosecutors hands as they did with the michael cohen tapes but he must have said things they're talking about his collusion and and so you can say oh no Jake you're doing specially sorry believe whatever the hell you want to believe here's what we know Trump's like no no don't let anybody find out even a summary of what I said to Putin so he must have sent things that were I mean if you're a logical person so who are it which show that he's guilty of course and he's so stupid I told you you can't cover it up he's probably going to and go Vlad what do you need me to do next don't worry just me and you in this room so there there are some updates to this whole story if you can recall even though it was a terrible idea Donald Trump had invited Vladimir Putin to the White House they were supposed to meet in Washington DC and it has just been reported today that the White House has decided to postpone that meeting until after the midterm elections likely in 2019 and I think it's because finally someone in his circle convinced him that it is a terrible idea in the middle of this investigation after this hellish joint press conference in Helsinki it's a terrible idea to invite Vladimir Putin to the White House and and look it's not necessarily a terrible idea to invite Vladimir Putin for a discussion right in any other context I'd be fine with that in the context of Donald Trump I if you care about him and you don't want him to make more mistakes you do you want to dissuade him from inviting value look a couple of guys here I involve it but hey Suz Edwin the guys who work on the crude through our director etc made a great point if Putin had come into the Oval Office he would have sat in the president's chair and they would have taken a picture and they would have put it out I know it's obvious speculation we'll probably never find out but he would have done it because that's who Putin is and he would have made sure that he knew where he stood yeah and it would have been devastating to Trump so this is a rare situation where Trump's advisors have headed off disaster but this ass was coming either way now this again I grant you this a speculation okay and I'm being clear with you about it but I know guys like Putin certainly don't know putting himself but he has that smirk on his face throughout that entire press conference where he's pulling the strings on Trump and getting Trump to say I don't know why it would have been the Russia's it would probably not it was our our intelligence is stupid and weak right Russia is strong right so during that press conference he's got the smirk on his face and then they ask him the thing that we were just telling you about did you want Trump to and he's like of course they did now you don't admit that if you're trying to cover things up my guess is he will milk a Trump for everything that he could possibly get out of him see if he could destroy the NATO alliance etc etc and then when he's done with Trump he's gonna release the compromise anyway because that's who Putin is he's a bad guy and he revels in his power and he rebels and destroying things and even if you say hey Jake you're trying to psychoanalyze Putin ok fair but remember that Putin the other objective he had was chaos in America and if you want chaos at the end you'd release the P tape anyway ok so take take take take take take take take listen I think Ben mankiewicz is right when he says a picture is not necessarily worth a thousand words but with that said to jinx point take a look at this I mean throughout the entire well I um it I love the bowing posture of Trump even more but the smirk does add a nice little touch to it like now what did I tell you reach yes sir America's at fault not Russia I'm so sorry for America sir oh my god that again I know we're over analyzing and it's just one snapshot in time let's be clear the picture means nothing I just think it's funny and entertaining I agree yeah but that unfortunately if we are right is the picture of their relationship yeah okay let's talk economy because there's a lot going on and I can't wait to discuss it so Donald Trump's tariffs have been absolutely disastrous for various industries throughout the United States but particularly for farmers and so Trump is doing what he typically does when he's in trouble and when he's getting called out for a failed policy or a bad behavior he doubles down and that's exactly what's happening today in fact he is responding to Republican lawmakers who have been criticizing him and these tariffs and of course he did so in the form of a tweet because that's what Trump typically does he says every time I see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off lost eight hundred seventeen billion on trade last year no weakness now the farmers themselves are deeply unhappy with what's going on with these tariffs because they are concerned about destroying trade relations and contracts that they took years to establish they're worried that it's not just the financial downfall that they'll experience this year but a financial downfall that will extend for years to come and so you know Trump's response to that was all right we're gonna give you some money but farmers aren't happy about that and we will get to that later now Donald Trump also claims that negotiations are going really well be cool the end result will be worth it and he also says they are being vicious meaning China in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice until now China made 517 billion dollars on us last year so I want to stop there for a second first off I acknowledge that China has made a terrible mistake in allowing the United States to owe its country 1.1 eight trillion dollars the u.s. is in debt to China to the tune again of 1.1 eight trillion dollars now I mean it's just fascinating how Trump's narrative of all of this is very one-sided the u.s. is being taken advantage of well again the u.s. owes China a lot of money right and so if China wanted to dump US Treasury bonds it would be disastrous for their own economy but that would be a nuclear option that would destroy our economy as well and we put ourselves in that situation we didn't have to borrow from China we chose to borrow from China China was it gave it to us and you know if you're looking for to borrow money and somebody gives it to you they're not being a mean to you they're being nice to it but anyway all this is meaningless it's all business so all right now let me break down two things that are important first I actually think the first part of what Trump said in the tweet is not wrong i if you're trying to show a united stance and you have people in your own country not backing you it does make negotiation harder so I think he's right about that now I don't think that his stance here is the logical one and I understand why people are saying that they don't agree with it but it does make the negotiations more difficult for example when and I'm always try to look at it what if two shoes on the other foot when Obama was trying to do negotiations with Iran and many other countries but particularly with Iran the Republicans here literally sent a letter to the Ayatollah saying Obama doesn't represent us and we're gonna betray him okay which was unbelievable and hurt the negotiations you want to pulling it off anyway but but fair is fair so now again this is mainly the Republican Party saying it's a terrible idea and undercutting Trump but it they are undercutting him they are undercutting him but I would argue that this is one of the rare instances where Republicans Republican lawmakers are doing the right thing now are there instances where trade negotiations make sense threatening other countries with tariffs makes sense of course right but as I've said a billion times on the show it's a nuanced issue that you have to be knowledgeable about and Trump is not knowledgeable about this he's just slapping on arbitrary tariffs left and right many of which are impacting our relationship with allies long-standing allies and so I feel as though lawmakers don't know what else to do because Trump unilaterally does things that are completely disastrous his own aides are against this his own economic advisors you know behind the scenes are against this based on the reporting that we've seen and so yeah it's making your job harder for a good reason because you're not what is your negotiation what are you gonna try to do so far all we've seen from him is I don't think this is fair so I'm gonna slap on some tariffs and then of course the countries that he's done this to will retaliate and his form of negotiating is I'm gonna do more tariffs yeah that's not negotiating yes so look I don't agree with his policies so but I'm just pointing out that he is being undercut now his policies are stupid for now reasons one is he never had an endgame he never thinks more than one step ahead so they're like hey Donald Trump if you do tariffs against China they will do reciprocal tariff tariffs against you and the minute he de do it he said what why do they do the tariffs what they're being so vicious no you schmuck any country when there's a tariff against them does a reciprocal tariff that's why you don't start those trade wars and then he says they're being so vicious by targeting the farmers because they know it hurts me yeah what did you think they were gonna do be nice to you you slapped hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on them of course they were gonna try to hit you where it hurt not where it doesn't hurt but the fact that he's surprised by that is what's amazing like oh it turns out they hit the farmers of course they were gonna hit the farmers you idiot right and then finally for in terms of why he doesn't understand anything look at the last part of the tweet and he says this over and over again he said we lost eight hundred and seventeen billion dollars on trade last year I think that he actually believes we just lost the money right it's gone no it's a trade and yes so for example we have a trade surplus with Canada even though he doesn't realize that so it's not that we took money from Canada it's that we sold them more Goods than they sold us but they bought our goods we bought their goods they didn't just we didn't just take their money and the China didn't just take our money exactly we didn't lose eight hundred and seventeen billion dollars that's not how trade works to give you a sense of it how it works in your life when you have a trade deficit with your car dealership let's say you paid thirty thousand dollars for your car then he just take thirty thousand dollars from you you gave them thirty thousand dollars they gave you a car that's how it works it's not if there were two different countries you would have a trade deficit to them but you didn't lose the money you've got a car for it hey but he doesn't understand that I think he literally believes where did the money go the eight hundred and seventeen billion dollars it's gone we lost it we got to get it back oh my god you're so stupid they just feel look if you're concerned about trade deficits I mean I guess it's a negotiating tactic to threaten any given country with tariffs but don't you also have to play like your economic advisors for instance right the head of the Treasury I don't know I mean shouldn't they work as a sales person who has communication with these countries and and sells us products that we would then export to kind of close that trade deficit but that's not the way that he wants to handle it he wants to handle it with this like hardball way of doing things and it hasn't worked so far in fact it's only hurt the economy it's hurt the farmers and his uh you know his response to it has been ridiculous by the way this is also hurt the solar power industry here in California when he first imposed these huge tariffs on solar panels coming from China I mean no one cared about that no one made a big deal about that a bunch of jobs in California were lost as a result of that but no one cared and he's just continued that failed policy moving forward by the way another thing I always found really fascinating was Trump's rhetoric in response to China in regard to China is very different compared to his own personal business with China even when it comes to his current re-election campaign so his reelection campaign of course is gonna have campaign flags and all sorts of stuff and it is currently being manufactured in China and we have some photos to prove it ok ok no no look this is a guy whose slogan is make America great again mm-hmm this is the guy who says if you don't do to make products in America I will punish you like he said the harley-davidson and he said over and over again to different companies without missing a beat because he does not care about hypocrisy he just doesn't care about it his own campaign slogans for 2020 his banners are being made in China in fact they're now rushing orders to America before the tariffs start yes because then the signs will be more expensive and they don't want more expensive signs because they like buying from China how could you not see the mess of hypocrisy if you were for if you wear the red hats that say make America great again and your whole thing was I like Trump he's tough he's doing the tariffs that'll show China we've got a make birthday job back home he's shipping out is the banners first campaign to China I look I guess if you think I don't care man I just hate Latinos and Muslims and mainly black people too okay so I don't care where he makes the things I don't care about any of his slogans I don't care about anything attached to reality as long as he hates the same people I hate I'm gonna vote for Trump I go okay fair I get it okay but just admit it and finally Trump is planning on imposing some new tariffs on foreign cars that are being imported to the United States so 25% tariffs on about 200 billion in foreign made cars later this year so the EU trade commissioner said that the EU is also readying tariffs on 20 billion dollars of US goods if Trump imposes trade levies on imported cars so it just it just keeps devolve and getting worse I'm sure that once they do that Trump will be shocked all over again what do why are you being so vicious to us well I I thought we just get to do it to them what I didn't know they get to do it to us alright we gotta take a break guess we got we got so much more and I've got the amazing news for you guys look Trump's a ticking time bomb we've covered some of that right now but wait till you see the polling and the information on how badly they're losing the Republican Party it might be on their deathbed they don't even know it we'll talk about that when we come back thanks for listening to this podcast you're only halfway through so hold hold stay right here just want to remind you if you want to get all five segments of the Young Turks commercial free these are just two of them every day we do it so go to TYT Network comm slash join and you get the whole five segments two hours ad free do it now alright back on The Young Turks a couple of comments from YouTube super chat Sean st. Hart writes in what kind of an idiot claims to possibly have recordings of the FBI director Comey taped in the Oval Office what kind of a person has goons break into his doctor's office to steal files oh right Trump I mean there's so many amazing preposterous stories that you forget because of the tsunami of idiotic things he does he broke into his doctor's office to steal the files first about that to steal his own files amazing amazing any one of these stories if Obama had done it hearings till the end of his term non-stop a hundred hearings anyway Callen Whittaker Trump looks weak but remember Trump supporters ideal social hierarchy aka the cucking order it goes Trump Trump supporters then brown people etcetera and the bottom positions are far more important than the topmost ones great point killing because they don't care that he just cooked to Putin care any of that right they think yeah my slaw above brown people good check mission accomplished right so and the last one is Isabella Roman writes in Anna i watch the postgame with you and Brett and I know it's hard I drove Phoenix to LA for the sweet 16 to see you speak you have no idea how much it means to women like me that you rep us you give me hope Thanks thank you although ironically it ends thanks dude but still is it oh that is very nice we really really do appreciate it we wonderful postgame for you guys today - I actually want to talk about Anna at Ozzie fest because I I'm not gonna give we're not going to give it any private conversations you had with Senator Gillibrand I actually want to say something positive about her based on what you told me okay that I don't think you've shared you know I haven't shared yeah so and I also want to ask you some saucy questions - about Ozzie fest okay so all the members get the postgame TYT calm /join okay right Anna was next all right Republicans were planning on running their campaigns based on Donald Trump's tax cuts now Congress success fully gave tax cuts to the wealthy even though the tax cuts for the wealthy we're polling horribly among the American people now it turns out that they're abandoning that platform idea because it is not looking good for them and they're pivoting to something completely different whether it's border security or identity politics anything other than the tax cut so I have a few examples for you and I want to start off with Ohio's upcoming special election for its 12th district so this is a congressional race you have Republican Tory Ball derson versus Democrat Danny O'Connor and so the first strategy that Baldr syns campaign wanted to utilize was tax cuts and they wanted to feature ads where middle-class Americans were hailing Trump and correctional Republicans for successfully passing these tax cuts so I'll give you an example of one of their ads take a look as a mom of three I really appreciate the middle-class tax cut it's saving families like my own over $2,500 a year I'm voting from Troy Bal derson because I trust him to protect the middle-class tax cut Nancy Pelosi called our tax cut crumbs and promised to raise our taxes and Danny O'Conner is standing with her no I don't know if Nancy Pelosi called those tax cuts crumbs but if she did she was accurate because the middle class either saw a tiny increase in their take-home pay or no increase at all in some cases especially middle-class earners living in states like California for instance or New York they actually did not get a tax cut at all they were paying more in taxes they will pay more in taxes when they file because they cannot deduct their state taxes in their federal taxes so look Americans get paid they see what their paychecks look like you can't keep lying to them and so what did Danny O'Connor do he decided to hit back by highlighting how much Americans actually hate these handouts to the wealthy take a look Congress a choice Troy Ball derson supports a corporate tax giveaway that racks up two trillion and forcing massive tax hikes on our kids or deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare now ball derson goes further saying I have no problems raising the retirement age The Dispatch endorses Danny O'Connor Social Security and Medicare are things that folks earned by doing things the right way and that's why I will stand against any cuts to Social Security and Medicare I'm Daniel Conner and I approve this message okay so just keep in mind that in Ohio's 12th district Trump very comfortably won by 11 points and this is this was completely unexpected but now there is a very tight race and it's just I love it I love all of this object yeah yeah so look i for me it's totally expected hey they're gonna lose that seat and they're gonna lose dozens upon dozens of seats they're in a world of hurt and so let me give you my sense of why so first of all and brag about tax cuts is Republican 101 it's their playbook that they have run for as long as I have been alive now in Connor lambs race in Pennsylvania Trump had won that seat by 20 points they lost now we go on with our lives as if that's not a harbinger of things to come but it is we go on as if these are not big deals when a Democratic Socialist won in the middle of Virginia against that one of the Republican leaders in the state in the middle of Virginia and not like not a costume of Cortez who ran on it if you ask me the heart of our campaign was really solidly progressive things like Medicare for all in higher wages the guy in Virginia just real democratic socialist no joke okay and and I'm not look and it's not a thing against the cross-state of Cortez at all III aligned with her positions much more but these are massive swings they're happening all across the country and we're pretending like it's not happening it is right so an 11-point lead gone but but look there was drawing their ads about tax cuts you know why they do that because they have internal polling and the polling is showing get those ads off the air not only are they not working and it's a waste of my it's counterproductive same thing happened in the Conor lamb race in Pennsylvania they ran a whole bunch of ads like tax cuts for the rich isn't it great of course they don't say rich they say tax cuts for you isn't it great and people like yeah I just saw my paycheck no not great and remember that tax cut for the wealthy was immediately followed with people like Paul Ryan going in the media and talking about how they needed to cut entitlements and Americans aren't stupid they think they are you know they say entitlements and they think Americans are idiots they're just gonna think Oh these are handouts we don't like handouts but no people know that when you say entitlement you're talking about Social Security you're talking about Medicare and those are popular programs and they're not buying your your complete BS anymore they they're so out of ideas guys that they are now running positive ads Republicans never run positive ads you only run positive ads if you're screwed and none of your negative ads are working I'm keeping it real with you guys okay look that's politics I've been covering this for well over 20 years Republicans never run positive ads and but they have all this money that they raise from corporate interests and none of their ads are working so they're like oh get the tax ads off the air it's costing us points we're going further and further behind so now in some of the races they're running positive biographies of their candidate yes like they're a good person that doesn't get the job done in politics and it is not what Republicans do ever that means they're out of any ideas the only thing they got left is that as they're running everywhere and there's two categories Gary Brown people are coming into the country and we're gonna crush them and the Democrats would let all the brown people in the country okay now that will motivate some of your base and I know why you're running those but that isn't gonna win you an election man you need independent voters and I've seen the polling the polling indicates that actually the overwhelming majority people including the independents want a pathway to citizenship so I know you're trying to scare the crap out of them but it's a really really old playbook in that sense and if that's your only move you're in a world of trouble because you're not talking about economic issues which they care about a lot more and of course the second thing is scary woman and they think that it's because Americans think she's really too liberal but look the other ads they're running it doesn't have Bernie Sanders in it okay it doesn't have all these people who are actually very very progressive now does have Elizabeth warm but that is curious why not Pelosi a Schumer who are the two leaders know the ads generally have Pelosi and if they have anyone else it has Elizabeth Warren why not have Schumer Schumer is a guy who's considered you know liberal elitist the center I don't think he is liberal but that is the same that's what the perception is but they don't have a Schumer in that I didn't even realize yeah so they're gonna go to the well on misogyny and and fear and hatred right but that well already gets them there twenty eight percent base and that base is immovable but they've lost the independence they're in for a world of hurt here and I also want to provide some evidence for you guys pertaining to wages after the tax cuts because that was also one of the arguments that Trump and Republicans in Congress would use in order to drum up support for these tax cuts on these corporations are gonna increase your wages that did not happen so let's go to graphic forty nine this is a study done by pay scale and they found that in the first quarter of 2018 wages actually drop significantly no I need you to study this chart because this is one of the most important charts you'll see and it is an indication unfortunately of both how the corporate Democratic and Republican parties have screwed you because that chart does fall precipitously under Donald Trump but the numbers have been bad throughout if you notice the good numbers are at negative seven and a half percent wage grows negative seven and a half those are the best numbers okay and then it falls into near nine and a half negative nine and a half so what that shows you is how the corporatists in both parties have been screwing you for decade after decade that's part of what part of why America voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton because they don't know that chart in particular but they feel it in their gut they see their paychecks they snow that they used to make a good living and have some sort of economic dignity and they don't anymore and they make a terrible living and they had gotta work two three jobs to maintain themselves it's not a mirage you were right all along they are screwing you you do have negative wage growth when you count inflation into it now it's also true that the Republican Party is worse and that's why the chart goes down like that like it was already terrible under the corporate Democrats then it got WAY worse under the corporate Republicans led by Donald Trump that is the swamp that's the swamp you hated that's why you throw a brick through their window and you voted for Trump because you hated the system so much but it turns out Trump's even worse go populist left vote for people who actually care about you and how do you know how can you tell well do they take corporate money or don't take take corporate money now look the Democrats have wizened up and in all their ads including the one we just showed you they're attacking corporate tax breaks corporate giveaways why because they're polling indicates what we have said all along which is that Americans actually hate big corporations they get crushed by big corporations and you can tell them all day long on MSNBC and CNN how wonderful big corporations are they're not buying it they work for big corporations and they've seen their wages get crushed so now now that the corporate democrats aren't necessarily are going to help you in that regard but at least they're smart enough to go oh the polling indicates they hate corporations this was a terrible corporate tax break and they shouldn't have given it to corporations they should have kept it with you that's a winning political strategy they're gonna crush the Republicans in this election cycle now it is incumbent upon all of us yes to help them do that because the Republicans are worse it's that part is true you could see it in every number but it is also common to come upon us to keep the Democrats honest yes because if they take that corporate PAC money and this was all just a gimmick and go back to crushing you and lower your wages then we haven't made a difference that's why support Democrats that don't take corporate PAC money that's when you know they're uncorrupted and are actually on your side and not their side yep well one of the Democrats who has been very clear in her disdain for corporate PAC money and has rejected corporate PAC money is Alexandria Acacio Cortes and she had the sunny upset in New York she beat out a you know an establishment Democrat who was expected to be the next speaker in Congress well here's some great news turns out that Republicans conservatives they're incredibly afraid of her and they can't stop fear-mongering about her and recently there was a video that went viral on Facebook featuring a woman named Allie Stuckey someone who I had debated on HLN about democratic socialism the video was cut together to make it appear that like Allie Stuckey was interviewing Acacio Cortez it was a doctored video there was no indication that it was satire when it was initially posted on Facebook and here is what the video looked like Alexandria thanks for being here thank you thank you for having me do you have any experience that qualifies you for this job I was growing up during the Clinton era and then basically when I was in middle school 9/11 happened do you have any knowledge whatsoever about how our political system works mmm yikes but socialism into your own words unprecedented concentration of wealth at the very top tippy top of the 1% Wow I'm I'm kind of surprised to hear you admit that it sounds like what's going on in socialist Venezuela mm-hmm what do you think about what's going on in Venezuela just an increasing crisis of humanitarian condition and to me it would just be completely unacceptable if that happened on our shores well couldn't that happen here it's if we adopted socialism it's hard to say what direction that that takes I am not the expert on geopolitics didn't you major in international relations in college Middle Eastern politics is not exactly with at my kitchen table every night Venezuela is not in the Middle East I may not use the right words well this has been enlightening thank you so much for coming on so that video was viewed a million times by people on Facebook and as I mentioned it previously had no indication that it was satire and you can tell by the viewers reactions in the comments sections a lot of people actually it's amazing but genuinely believed that that was a real interview later after receiving backlash they titled it appropriately and mentioned that it was satire but the clips of Alexandria Cosmo Cortes were from her interview with PBS's firing line and I just find it interesting because if first of all that wasn't funny so if it was an attempt to be satirical you failed miserably you're not the Daily Show there isn't any anything clever or funny about that video whatsoever but more importantly here's what you do when you come across political ideas or a political ideology that you disagree with you fight ideas with ideas right you fight with evidence with data statistics and you make your point ally Stuckey is really bad at doing that and so an easy way of doing this is to just defame someone and try to write them off as an idiot who doesn't know what she's talking about the only idiot here is the person who's unwilling to have a real debate about what democratic socialism is so yeah so no there's more idiots it's their viewers and I'll tell you why they did it so they describe the video initially as Stuckey grilling across here Cortez about her quote socialist agenda and knowledge of government or lack thereof so it was labeled to get you to believe that it was real and it had an emoji at the end if that helps okay and and so what they were counting on is the people who watch us are not bright they're conservatives and so they will will get to call a satire but we know that they won't think it's satire and when they saw the comment section they must have known immediately hey I can't believe what a complete moron she is I can't believe she doesn't know about as well as not in the Middle East if you thought it was satire and a doctor the tape you would know that she didn't answer Venezuela to the question about the Middle East right right but if you read the comments I should know the Conservatives are furious the irony of that is hilarious because this conservative organizations knows our viewers are dumb they won't be able to figure it out so we'll deceive them and then we won't do anything unless we're caught and if we're caught after we're caught we'll say oh or satire we always meant it for it to be said to her well nobody took it as satire and and that's that the entirety of the point which is unfortunately it is much easier for these conservatives just spread their fake news and get it viewed by a lot of people their retraction or their labeling of it afterwards no one doesn't get anywhere near as many views I mean the people people who have commented and seen that video they've already seen the video what makes you think they're gonna go back and read the description again I mean it's just not gonna happen and by the way if this organization was known for satire then that's one thing but they're not known for satire it is a conservative outlet that does conservative content and look I think I was supposed to debate Allie Stuckey again today on HLN and I don't know I mean she dropped out last minute it could have been for a good reason I don't know what the reason was but I did have an interaction with her in regard to democratic socialism and she you know takes a page out of the conservative playbook just fear monger about it because we don't like the ideas so I want to just show you a small snippet of that interaction we had talked about it on the show previously but it gives you a sense of who Allie Stuckey is first of all Democratic Party has moved much further to the lessons 1990 that's not an opinion you can look at Pew Research on surely every single issue since 1990 the entirety of the Democratic Party has moved to the fact whereas Republicans have stayed about the same so it's just not true to say that this is some kind of reform going back to the original purpose of the Democratic Party the fact of the matter is is that they're putting socialist candidates out there and socialism has not worked you can tell me democratic socialism is different it's not true it's just socialism that you choose it is not possible to maintain a capitalist society in which the government takes over the means of production it doesn't work it hasn't worked in the past it doesn't work now there are hundreds of millions of dead and buried people that can attest to the danger of socialism and communism infuse a few things if you hate no you are confusing democratic socialism I'm not socialism no one is looking to overthrow a capitalistic system I believe in capitalism but what we have right now is crony capitalism and the American people in general that includes Republicans are sick and tired of it if you look at the approval rating for Donald Trump's massive tax cuts for corporations even among Republicans the approval rating has dropped considerably because people have noticed already benefiting the top one percent not the American people wages remain stagnant and by the way a federal judge that was appointed by Bush by Bush just struck down the zero tolerance policy under the Trump administration indicating that yes the right wing has moved further to the right I want to make a quick clarification so in the very beginning of that because I was furious I said you're confusing democratic socialism with socialism I forgot to at allit Aryan socialism right so they think of the USSR they think of you know what happened in Cuba of course we already have socialist programs here in the United States that actually do really well with voters Medicare Social Security those are programs that Americans don't want cut but she just fearmongers about it I mean it's it's incredible well look now I'm a little afraid of what's been created here and I'll tell you why so was she right about anything no everything she said was wrong you could look at the polling and it shows the Republican Party has moved massively to the right I know that I used to be a Republican there was such thing as liberal Republicans backing data it doesn't exist anymore on every issue the Republican Party's moved to the right and the Democratic Party has moved to the right the Democrats used to be really liberal now they're mainly corporatist so and that and that's a feeling that we criticize the Democrats over all the time and I can go on and on so what am I afraid of they're gonna make a star out of our TV is over that yeah wait a young attractive conservative who gets everything wrong welcome to prime time yeah so that you might be looking at the next time he'll are in there they're like a person who doesn't know anything but it supports right-wing positions we need right-wingers get around here get around there get her on air okay and so a star is born now the person who was actually saying things that were correct like well now did we get called liberal all the time so we don't want any liberals on air but if you're a knucklehead conservative you will get all the press coverage you want so even though she did fake news here in this you know doctored video with Alexandria Casa of Cortes if I've got media figured out right and we've seen it a hundred times already this will help her career oh yeah media star is born yeah because the the reality is the mainstream media doesn't care whether you're telling the truth or you're lying they're just looking for to appease right-wingers and in a minute they get a right-winger like this they will give them more airtime than you could possibly imagine so you'll probably see a lot more valley Stuckey because nobody cares if she's telling the truth yeah all right we got to take a break when we come back how Trump is dealing with corporate violations thanks for watching what I hope was a lovely edition of The Young Turks now you know that that is two
