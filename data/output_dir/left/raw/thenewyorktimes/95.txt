1
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:04,410
Men have always been
obsessed with the fantasy

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,870
that they could actually
give life to a woman instead

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,670
of the other way around —

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,300
Adam’s rib,
Pygmalion’s statue

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,330
and Andrew McCarthy’s
“Mannequin.”

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,490
The point is not
just to create women

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,110
but to control them.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,260
It’s literal
objectification —

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,220
a dream girl who
is less a person

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,990
than a personal plaything.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,330
And for the past hundred 
years or so,

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,920
this fantasy has taken

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,790
the form of the “fembot,” a
woman who can be programmed

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,065
to do as her creator pleases.

15
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,560
“Did I do bad, Dad?”

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,235
“No, sweetie, you didn’t.”

17
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:39,720
Masculine robots
in pop culture

18
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,720
get to do a lot of
things like help people

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,755
make friends, do science,
hang out with cats, murder.

20
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,395
“Send in the fembots!”

21
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:52,410
But more often than not,
fembots exist to please men.

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,400
And these days, feminized
tech is all around us.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,505
“And welcome to 
Newark Liberty

24
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,505
International Airport.”

25
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,470
Digital helpmates
like Siri and Alexa

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,450
are fitted with
feminine voices.

27
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,075
“Make me a sandwich.”

28
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:05,685
“I can’t.

29
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,305
I have no condiments.”

30
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:08,970
Men can engineer
their fantasies

31
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,460
with hyperrealistic
sex robots.

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,840
And on social media, 
a new breed of

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,080
fembot has emerged.

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,990
Meet Lil Miquela.

35
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,540
One million people follow
her on Instagram.

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,240
She reps streetwear
brands, speaks out

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,580
on social issues like trans
rights and Black Lives

38
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,030
Matter, and now she’s making
the inevitable transition

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,864
to a pop music career.

40
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,780
Oh, and she’s not real.

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,730
She’s an entirely
computer-generated

42
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,200
online influencer.

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,810
Her look is an exaggerated
version of the beauty

44
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,240
standards that have
swept Instagram, making

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,750
its most followed women
look oddly similar

46
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,183
and a little bit unreal.

47
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,070
“If I was a celebrity,
I’d be famous.”

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,530
And then there’s Poppy,
a real human woman

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,310
who acts like an android, a
digital star wholly molded

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,727
by internet trends.

51
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:03,540
“Havana, oh na na, ay.”

52
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,960
Her videos have nearly 300
million views on YouTube.

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,663
“Only sweet robots
get whipped cream.”

54
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:16,290
In 1984, Donna Haraway
wrote “A Cyborg

55
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,170
Manifesto,” in which she
imagined a world where

56
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,870
embracing the cyborg 
allowed women to escape

57
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,510
the confines of traditional 
gender roles.

58
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,450
But today, it seems
that the cyborgification

59
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,240
of women online has just
created new standards

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,580
to adhere to, ones
that are increasingly

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,230
costly and time-consuming
to fulfill.

62
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,710
Take Kylie Jenner.

63
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,270
It’s so typical
for her to appear

64
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,980
with her phone in
the shot that she

65
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,760
starts to look like a cyborg,
device permanently attached

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,430
to her hand.

67
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,450
Clicking through
Kylie’s changing looks

68
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,910
over time gives the
impression of software

69
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,220
upgrading to a new version.

70
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,594
She changes her hair
color so frequently

71
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,400
that it recalls the ease
of a Photoshop click.

72
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,730
Representations
of fembots tend

73
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,760
to track along with our
current cultural anxieties,

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,120
from women’s suffrage to
the housewives’ revolt

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,340
to the third-wave feminist
campaign for women

76
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,750
to take control over
their sexuality.

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,160
These social media fembots
play on the anxiety

78
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,460
that women are fake, that
they’re somehow deceiving men

79
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,040
through makeup or plastic
surgery or Spanx or

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,130
Instagram filters.

81
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,250
But they also point out
how real human women are

82
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,950
being molded by technology.

83
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,550
These fembots no longer 
need villainous male creators

84
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,440
to tell them what to do.

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,870
Their followers do that
for them, collectively

86
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,470
molding their behavior by
dispensing and withholding

87
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,150
likes.

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,031
“I don’t like this video.

89
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:46,805
Trash it.”

90
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:49,410
Their creator is us.

91
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,990
Hey, I’m Amanda.

92
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,850
I’m Shane.

93
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,940
He edits the videos.

94
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,220
She writes the videos.

95
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,720
And you watch the videos.

96
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,240
And if you like the videos,

97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,580
like, comment and 
subscribe here.

98
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,020
We are very thirsty.

99
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,130
Very.

100
00:04:03,179 --> 00:00:00,000
[singing] “Internetting with
Amanda Hess.”
