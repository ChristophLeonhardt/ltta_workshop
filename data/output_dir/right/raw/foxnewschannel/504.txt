YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TONIGHT

FREDDY WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION

24
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,317
IMPASSIONED -- I THINK IT WAS

25
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,186
"THE MOMENT" OTHER THAN

26
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:19,920
KAVANAUGH'S OPENING STATEMENT.

27
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,954
THE MOMENT OF THE DAY FROM

28
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:21,521
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

29
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,656
LET'S WATCH.

30
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,591
>> IF YOU WANTED AN FBI

31
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,292
INVESTIGATION, YOU COULD HAVE

32
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:25,859
COME TO US.

33
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,260
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY

34
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,163
THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT

35
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,000
OPEN, AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020.

36
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
YOU HAVE SAID THAT.

37
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,170
NOT ME.

38
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,405
IF YOU HAVE GOT NOTHING TO

39
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,774
APOLOGIZE FOR.

40
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,545
WHEN YOU SEE SONIA SOTOMAYOR AND

41
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,547
ELENA KAGAN -- I VOTED FOR THEM.

42
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,583
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT

43
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,584
YOU DID TO THE SKY.

44
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,587
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM

45
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,789
SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS.

46
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,258
ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST?

47
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,930
>> NO.

48
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,998
>> I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND

49
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:07,801
YOUR FAMILY ARE GOING THROUGH.

50
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,402
BOY, Y'ALL WANT POWER.

51
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,570
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT.

52
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,938
TO HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN

53
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,173
SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM, THAT

54
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,541
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU HELD

55
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:14,808
IT.

56
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,411
GOD, I HATE THIS.

57
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,545
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIEND.

58
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,213
BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHEN IT

59
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,182
COMES TO THIS.

60
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:22,917
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR

61
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:26,186
PROCESS, YOU CAME TO THE WRONG

62
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,721
TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, MY

63
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,055
FRIEND.

64
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,590
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF

65
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,761
YOU VOTE NO, YOU ARE

66
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,931
LEGITIMIZING THE MOST DESPICABLE

67
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,734
THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN

68
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:40,368
POLITICS.

69
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,802
>> Laura: NEWT, I'VE NEVER

70
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,004
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT MOMENT

71
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:44,171
AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR

72
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:44,705
ALMOST 30 YEARS.

73
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,173
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT.

74
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,775
YOUR REACTION TO THAT PIVOTAL

75
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,810
MOMENT?

76
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,846
>> I THINK THAT MOMENT JUSTIFIED

77
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,949
LINDSEY GRAHAM'S ENTIRE CAREER.

78
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:59,587
HE WAS COURAGEOUS, BLUNT,

79
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,122
HONEST, DIRECT, EMOTIONAL, AND

80
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:01,489
EFFECTIVE.

81
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,227
THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST

82
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,361
DESPICABLE BEHAVIOR BY A MAJOR

83
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,398
PARTY IN MODERN HISTORY.

84
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,333
THIS IS A DELIBERATE, VICIOUS

85
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,636
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, HURT

86
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,773
THE GUY'S DAUGHTERS, HURT HIS

87
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,975
MOTHER, HURT HIS WIFE, HURT HIS

88
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:21,409
REPUTATION.

89
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,810
THEY DIDN'T CARE.

90
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,545
YOU ARE WATCHING PEOPLE ON THAT

91
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,514
PANEL, DEMOCRATS ON THAT PANEL,

92
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,416
WHO KNOW IT'S A LIE.

93
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,917
THEY KNOW IT'S A LIE.

94
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,019
THEY KNOW THE WAY THAT FEINSTEIN

95
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,156
DID THIS WAS UTTERLY, TOTALLY

96
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,591
DESPICABLE.

97
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:37,191
THEY WENT ALONG.

98
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,927
MY BIG QUESTION IS, IS THERE A

99
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,163
SINGLE DEMOCRAT WITH THE GUTS TO

100
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:47,168
STAND UP AND VOTE FOR THIS JUDGE

101
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,236
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS IS

102
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:48,603
SICKENING.

103
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,571
I WANT TO SEE WHETHER IT IS JOE

104
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,839
MANCHIN OR HEIDI HEITKAMP OR ANY

105
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,573
OF THEM.

106
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,741
DO THEY HAVE THE GUTS TO STAND

107
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,612
UP TO THE LEFT AND SAY, THIS IS

108
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:58,680
EXACTLY WHAT IS WRONG WITH

109
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,147
MODERN AMERICA?

110
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,749
BECAUSE THIS IS A DESPICABLE ACT

111
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,952
OF UTTER CHARACTER ASSASSINATION

112
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:05,420
BY PEOPLE WHO FRANKLY HAVE

113
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,989
BEHAVED IN AN EVIL WAY, UNWORTHY

114
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,225
OF THE UNITED STATES.

115
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,794
>> Laura: WE HAD HEIDI

116
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:13,595
HEITKAMP AS A POSSIBILITY, JOE

117
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,797
MANCHIN LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE

118
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:16,664
VOTING YES.

119
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:17,599
SOMEONE LIKE JOE DONNELLY,

120
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,903
CLAIRE McCASKILL, THIS IS

121
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,938
WHERE FAIRNESS AND BASIC SENSE

122
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:24,606
OF DECENCY, YOU WOULD THINK

123
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,907
WOULD KICK IN BECAUSE THE TABLES

124
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,642
CAN BE TURNED ON THE DEMOCRATS,

125
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:27,942
NEWT.

126
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:28,676
ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLICANS WOULD

127
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,410
NEVER DO THIS.

128
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,146
I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING BECAUSE

129
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,447
YOU MENTION IT, NEWT.

130
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:36,184
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND THE LEAK.

131
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:36,918
BOTH MIKE LEE AND JOHN CORNYN

132
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,521
TRIED TO HIT HER ON THIS IDEA

133
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,723
THAT THIS DOCUMENT JUST KIND OF

134
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:42,991
APPEARED FROM HER OFFICE AND

135
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:43,892
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS OF THE

136
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:44,192
PRESS.

137
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,261
LET'S WATCH.

138
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,762
>> CAN YOU TELL US THAT YOUR

139
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,065
STAFF DID NOT LEAK IT?

140
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,900
>> I DON'T BELIEVE MY STAFF

141
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,934
WOULD LEAK IT.

142
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:55,370
I HAVE NOT ASKED THAT QUESTION

143
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:55,737
DIRECTLY.

144
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,172
>> DO YOU KNOW THAT?

145
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:58,073
I MEAN, HOW IN THE WORLD DID

146
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:00,042
THAT GET IN THE HANDS OF THE

147
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,342
PRESS?

148
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:03,545
>> THE ANSWER IS NO.

149
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:04,213
THE STAFF DID NOT.

150
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:08,050
>> HAVE YOU ASK YOUR STAFF OR

151
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:05,881
>> Laura:         >> I ALREADY D

152
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:11,019
OTHER STAFF --

153
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:11,587
>> Laura:         >> I ALREADY .

154
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:14,356
>> THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?

155
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,824
>> PARTED ME -- JENNIFER RIDES

156
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,259
ME THAT I BACKED HER BEFORE.

157
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,327
>> SOMEBODY LEAKED IT IF IT

158
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,128
WASN'T YOU.

159
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,564
>> Laura: WAIT A SECOND, SHE

160
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:30,305
JUST SAID HER STAFF, SHE DIDN'T

161
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:30,906
ASK HER STAFF, WHICH IS

162
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:31,573
UNBELIEVABLE, IF A DOCUMENT

163
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:32,307
LEAKS FROM YOUR OFFICE, AND THEN

164
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:32,941
SHE SAYS, OH, NO, SHE JUST

165
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:33,542
REMINDED ME I DID.

166
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:34,476
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST A

167
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:38,180
SHATTERING MOMENT FOR

168
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,047
DIANNE FEINSTEIN PRAY THAT WAS

169
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:39,748
ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASSING

170
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,184
MOMENTS OF THIS WHOLE DAY.

171
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:44,219
>> I THINK THAT

172
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,321
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, WHO WAS ONCE

173
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,924
A RESPONSIBLE AND HONORABLE

174
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,560
PERSON, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

175
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,294
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE IS CHALLENGED

176
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:56,131
FROM THE LEFT IN CALIFORNIA AND

177
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:56,999
THE ELECTION THIS YEAR, BUT FOR

178
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,902
WHATEVER REASON, THIS HAS ALL

179
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:00,469
GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL.

180
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:05,307
THE FACT IS THE REPUBLICANS ARE

181
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,377
OUGHT TO GO AFTER HER STAFF, THE

182
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:08,410
