PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A GOOFBALL.
I THINK THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT
NOW, AND HE IS A CHILD, SO
HE WILL TWEET LIKE A CHILD.
HE WILL OFTEN ADMIT THINGS THAT
HE SHOULDN'T ADMIT IN TWEETS,
KIND OF LIKE HIS SON, AND HE
WILL END TWEETS WITH SAD,
BABY, THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES.
HE WILL MISSPELL THINGS, HE WILL
GET FACTS HORRIBLY WRONG, SO
OBVIOUSLY, HIS STAFF FROM TIME
TO TIME MAKES AN EFFORT TO TAKE
HIS TWEETER AWAY FROM HIM, AS
RICK PERRY WOULD SAY,
SPEAKING OF UNINTELLIGENT
PEOPLE.
THEY'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL.
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY TRY
TO TAKE AWAY HIS TWITTER
MACHINE.
HE WAS TALKING TO MARK LEIBOWITZ
FOR NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE AND
HE SAYS, THEY WANT TO DELAY MY
VOICE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY
MY SOCIAL MEDIA.
FIRST OF ALL, WHO IS THEY?
IT IS YOUR OWN GUYS WHO ARE
LIKE, MR.
PRESIDENT, I'M
SORRY BUT YOU ARE TOO DUMB.
YOU KEEP GETTING YOURSELF
INTO TROUBLE, AND YOU KEEP
ADMITTING THINGS YOU
SHOULDN'T ADMIT AND IT IS
GETTING ALL OF US IN TROUBLE.
PLEASE PUT DOWN THE TWITTER.
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY, I LIKE
THAT ONE.
SAD.
BABY.
FOR THE MOMENT BEING, HE DOES
KEEP HIS ACCOUNT AND HE IS
STILL TWEETING AND I THINK THAT
IS GOOD NEWS FOR AMERICA.
YES, IT MAKES US LOOK RIDICULOUS
BECAUSE HE IS NOW OUR
PRESIDENT, BUT AT LEAST HE WILL
PROBABLY ADMIT TO SEVERAL
DIFFERENT CRIMES ACCIDENTALLY ON
TWITTER, AND IT WILL HELP
GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE.
MARK LEIBOWITZ, FROM HIS POINT
OF VIEW SAID, "NO, I THINK IT
LEADS TO BETTER TRANSPARENCY."
OF COURSE IT DOES.
IT DOES,
THAT IS THE ONE THING IT
DOES DO.
WE HAVE BETTER TRANSPARENCY INTO
THAT MIND WHETHER WE LIKE
IT OR NOT.
