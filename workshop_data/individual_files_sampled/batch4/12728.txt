in the wake of the worst terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11 Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton seen the enemy and the enemy is you it's us during the presumptive Democratic 2016 presidential nominee speech she spent a lot of time calling on Americans to give up their guns in the name of stopping mass shootings like the Orlando radical Islamic terror attack she said quote I believe weapons of war have no place on our streets we may have our disagreements on gun safety regulations but we should all be able to agree on a few things President Obama by the way said exactly the same thing his initial statement called on Americans to think about the risks we are willing to take by being so lacks in how we make very powerful firearms available to people in this country we have to go after terrorist organizations and hit them hard but we also have to make sure it's not easy for somebody who decides they want to harm people in this country to be able to obtain weapons to get at them I have a two-word response to President Obama and Hillary Clinton and it rhymes with truck mu here's why first off this was their responsibility right this is on men as presidents and Secretary of State it's their job to protect Americans from the spread of terrorism in the country they have not they've turned Isis from the JV team those are Obama's words into a major global terror threat both Obama and Hillary simultaneously suggest that their government is omnipotent and powerful when it comes to screening terrorists and administering gun law but they don't have enough tools at their disposal Obama's FBI investigated its irony of brothers the San Bernardino shooters the Orlando terrorists it came up empty all three times they came out completely empty yet we're supposed to believe that if we give them more power and we give it to Moeller of the federal government the parts of the federal government less competent by the way than the FBI somehow this is gonna win ou out terrorists through thorough transparency model efficiency and pinpoint implementation if we give them a right to seize weapons from Americans or borrow Americans who haven't been charged with a crime from exercising the rights in short the incompetence in the federal government at least in part got 49 Americans killed in Orlando their solution we shouldn't give them more power and limit our own ability to defend ourselves not gonna happen see here's the deal I live in California I've had 40 minutes from the San Bernardino attack I lived in the same community as Yaakov Amman off the six-year-old father who was murdered at LAX in 2002 by a radical Islamic terrorist at the LAX ela encounter I went to school next to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in LA that was the original target of white supremacist terrorist Buford furrow I live with an easy driving distance of the JCC the Jewish Community Center that he ended up attacking in LA nobody gets a concealed carry permit nobody every time I walk to the synagogue I have to make a risk assessment is it worthwhile to illegally carry my Glock 9-millimeter in case the terrorist tree decides it shoot up some Jews today what's the bigger risk getting shot in a synagogue or being arrested for illegally carrying because the government can't be there at once well for Obama and Hillary there's no dilemma they lie they pretend they can keep us safe even as they fail to do so and then they insist all we have to do is just disarm ourselves they're writing checks victims are going to cash in blood neither Obama nor Hillary can protect us if we delegate our complete self-protection to the same bunch of morons who fret over Donald Trump's rhetorical excesses more than the importation of Muslim extremists who worry more about the ownership of an ar-15 by people like me then a radical Muslim gallivanting around with actual terrorists in Florida nobody will be protected I do have things to protect however and so do you we all do those things are too important to be left to the sniveling cowardice of the same exact administration that refuses to pronounce the words radical Islam I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show tend to demonize people don't care about your feelings all ready so here we are and the fallout continues from the Orlando shooting President Obama yesterday spent a lot of the day blabbering about how radical Islam using the word was just useless it was pointless it was useless there was no reason to do it it was just a waste of his time we discussed yesterday exactly why this is particularly done because we feel the reason that he's not using radical Islam is because he's sympathetic not to radical Islam per se but he's sympathetic to the perspective that radical Islam doesn't really matter that radical Islam doesn't really matter that it's sort of an afterthought that if we just gave everybody enough money and a rich lifestyle and if life weren't so unfair radical Islam would just sort of just disappear into the woodwork we said that this is this is really you know this is a an afterthought for the Obama administration and I said no it's not an afterthought I just don't want to say it I don't want to say it because it's useless and it's useless because it's counterproductive okay here's the proof that we're right and he's wrong so Jay Johnson who is his homeland security secretary he's on TV and he and explains what this threat really is in places like Orlando the president's number one priority as is mine is the protection of the homeland protection of the American people as you know we're doing a number of things to do that both militarily through aggressive law enforcement and homeland security and we're going to continue and we're going to keep at this in this environment of homegrown violent extremism and that's what Orlando is looking more and more alike okay he says it's it's home bound terrorism you shouldn't be that worried is is it's just silly it's just silly and and it's silly because the fact is that we know that we should worry about it because this terrorism is in some ways more likely to kill you than the sort of terrorism the organized terrorism of 9/11 this happening all over the place where we got Stan Bernardino we've got Texas Fort Hood we had another one parently and arm in armadillo where is it in Texas and not armadillo and in Texas in any case Oh Amarillo thank you my goodness it's like I'm from LA or something Amarillo Texas there was an attempted shooting we're still determining the motivation but the guy who did it was apparently Muslim yeah all over the United States we've seen cases like this you're more likely to be killed in a movie theater by a terrorist than you are to be killed in a spectacular terrorist attack 9:11 so when he says you don't have to worry these are just homegrown extremists I'm worried I'm worried and I'm worried because you imported their parents I'm worried because as Donald Trump says you imported their parents and also you imported a lot of their spouses so we're now learning that the the mother the the wife in this particular case that the wife she was apparently somebody who knew that the husband was casing the joints apparently Disney reported to the authorities this guy was casing Disney World for an attack and the authorities did nothing because hey that's what the authorities do right and now we know not only that we now know that the wife is talking to the FBI and she may be charged because she knew he was casing this particular gay bar he kept going there and taking her and she says I tried to talk him out of it but you know oops oops so Donald Trump comes down he says there has to be consequences for Muslims who don't report suspicious activities but it's so important that they and they're tremendous people it's so important that when they see trouble going on like they did in San Bernardino I mean there were numerous people that saw bombs all over this apartment floor they knew something was going on they never reported him or her they never reported in the 14 people were killed many many people injured same thing here you're going to find out with this savage that did this horrible thing over the weekend that many people said oh I knew that was going to happen they've got to report them because the Muslims are the ones that see what's going on the Muslims are the ones that have to report them and if they don't report them then there have to be consequences to them okay so he says that if you don't report people the Nats and then the immediate result is going to be prosecution most Americans look at this go yep yep absolutely right Donald Trump talking sense that's exactly right especially when Barack Obama is doing this routine yesterday I mean this was news that was completely ignored by everybody yesterday the Senate passed overwhelmingly overwhelmingly the Senate passed this law the Senate bill that was it's not a law yet a bill that funds the Defense Department right it funds the Defense Department only one problem only one problem President Obama threatens to veto it right a couple of days after the largest terror attack in America since 9/11 President Obama threatens to veto the defense bill why what happened well it turns out President Obama didn't like that he didn't like the defense bill why because it continued to fund Gitmo it continued to fund Guantanamo Bay so you have one party that's fundamentally unserious about terrorism and even our most unserious person on the other side even the rights most unserious person if he is of the right even the most unserious republican in america donald trump he knows that you have to take terrorism seriously and the left isn't doing it the left isn't doing it Jeff Sessions he's a surrogate for Donald Trump he said he points out correctly the orlando attackers father was an extremist but his father was clearly an extremist a taliban member and that you properly done he wouldn't have been admitted i think so we can protect the united states in many ways by a much more aggressive on enforcement okay so he says that his father was was extreme to a gun true again true and look at donald trump justify himself and he looked seriously done bill o'reilly was an ally of donald trump's granted but bill o'reilly asks him you know Donald Donald President Obama keeps accusing you of contributing to the demonization of Muslims in the United States here's Donald Trump's answer do you believe that there is a danger now that because of your hot rhetoric about the topic and I agree with some of what you're saying okay you got a vet these people from overseas you just can't let them waltz in I agree but you see that you could be contributing to a demonization of all Muslims in general is that possible no just the opposite I really believe it's just the opposite I have many friends you know that I've said it before I've many friends who are Muslim I get calls from many people thanking me who are Muslim thanking me I have some incredible friends some wonderful friends some are very successful some aren't but I have many Muslim friends and they're thanking me many of them not all of them but many of them the fact is she's allowing massive numbers of people to come in and they're not all radicalized and they're not all terrorists but they're it doesn't take many bill if you take a look this is one young man that did this damage fifty people killed and probably a lot more to follow them very very gravely injured in hospitals right now they're wound so badly so this is one man so it doesn't take very many but we have many in my opinion you have many coming in and they're smart and they're cunning and they know how to get through the system and by the way they've stolen our passport machines so they make passports better than we make passports we don't know who's coming in and frankly our president doesn't know what the hell he's doing okay so the president doesn't know what he's doing and of course the Trump is exactly right what he's saying here is right you know that this this talk about Muslim demonization nobody is saying all Muslims are responsible for this sort of stuff nobody is saying that but radical Muslims are responsible for this sort of stuff because they're the ones doing it they're the ones doing it now here's where we go off the road here's where we go off the road so Donald's from over the weekend and this preceded his speech I talked about his speech yesterday and I said I thought it was the best moment of his campaign I thought he said a lot of relevant and decent and good things here's Donald Trump talking about President Obama this happened on Monday morning on Fox & Friends and this is what the media is seizing on and jumping on well let by a man that either is is not tough not smart or he's got something else in mind and there's something else in mind you know people can't believe it people cannot see that they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism there's something going on it's inconceivable okay so you say and then he continued along those lines again it's not the end of the quote he says it's inconceivable and what he continued by saying and try and find the direct quote from Donald Trump because it's important what he actually said was there's something else in my says look we're led by a man that is either not tough not smart or he's got something else in mind and there's something else in mind you know people can't believe it people cannot they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism okay so far so good there's something going on it's inconceivable there's something going on he doesn't get it or he gets it better than anyone understands it's one or the other and either one is unacceptable he gets it better than anyone understand so what does he get better than anybody else understands right I mean there's only one way really to interpret that and the idea there is that Obama totally understands radical Islam and he's fine with it happening he's fine with them coming to the United States and engaging in terror and the only reason presumably he would do that is because he's a Muslim himself that's that sort of the implication that's particularly implication coming from Trump in 2011 of course Trump suggested that Obama wasn't born in the United States and he suggested that maybe his birth certificate said he was Muslim in 2012 Trump tweeted quote does Madonna knows something we all don't about Barack at a concert she said we have a black Muslim in the White House okay so this is dumb stuff it's dumb okay it's really dumb and the reason it's dumb is because you don't have to be a Muslim in order to let radical Muslims get away with things right the left doesn't routinely Hillary Clinton is not Muslim Obama is not Muslim either right Obama is his eighth is an atheist he doesn't believe in God all this talk if he's a Christian it's in name only he's a he's a he's a Jeremiah right Christian which is to say he believes in in a in a Christ that reflects the leftist political priorities of Jeremiah right okay certainly not a bible-believing Christian clearly he's somebody who struggles to cite the Bible he's somebody who's not familiar with it he's somebody who believes more in his own atheistic agnostic version of the world than in the Bible that's fine but what that means is that he believes as we mentioned yesterday that the world exists on a materialist Marxist plane the only reason that people do bad things is because they're poor and the only reason they do that thing is because they're poor is because the world's is unfair so if we just made the world more fair than things would be all better Trump says this sort of thing right he says that maybe Obama is is a Muslim maybe he's a covert Muslim okay this is really dumb stuff it's really dumb stuff and this is the problem with Trump well Trump giveth with one hand he takes away with the other people who are the same today Trump brought up issues that nobody else would have brought up in the aftermath of this attack that's not true every Republican every single Republican says the same sort of thing about radical Islam that Donald Trump says all of them right they they all say the same thing they they and they all say the same thing the idea that Donald Trump brought something up it's is one of the great myths about Trump he raises issues no one else would raise no the media pays attention to him raising issues that other people raised the media pay attention when Trump says illegal immigration is bad they don't care what other Republicans say it Republicans been saying this since 9/11 right there's nothing new and what Trump said when Trump goes after Obama on the basis of he must be a cover Muslim er it's it's all under cover and all this is this is the danger of Trump can't handle it if the I've said before if the man had any discipline if you had any discipline at all he'd be President easily he has no discipline and so he endangers that pretty much every day and so what happens the Washington Post reported a headline and the headline that they reported was something along the lines of it was it was fascism right Donald Trump was was calling for a something about Donald Trump was was saying that Obama was a Muslim and that was the implication there but but Donald Trump didn't like it so he said based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record-setting Trump campaign we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post so Donald Trump doesn't like the Washington Post report the Washington Post is banned from his campaign so you know all of that this is this is all distraction from what should be the central issue right the central issues should be the central issues should be radical Islam and why blunt the left mention it instead the central issue is why is Donald Trump banning the Washington Post after quasi claiming that Obama is a covert Muslim why what's the point the posts original headline was Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting that's an unfair headline it's also an unfair headline Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting all of that's unfair granted that's unfair Trump sure the Senate in the first place the Washington Post shouldn't have lied when they reported it Trump's within his rights to ban them it's not a smart move but it's a move I suppose the problem is it's all a distraction it's all distraction from the one thing that he does right right the one thing that he does right is named radical Islam this is just it's just it's just silly talk it's just silly talk and so Donald Trump does this and naturally the media are all over it here CNN there's a much larger point here and I don't I mean I kind of hesitate when I thought about saying it but I mean this is fascism at its best I mean you know we've gone down the path of whether or not you know Donald Trump has said things that are racist or not racist I mean we've gone down the path of whether or not he said things that are offensive or not offensive but this is fascism at its worst and be completely honest with you I mean banning The Washington Post I mean that is that's absurd I mean just just thinking about the fat that press and professing your love for freedom but not your love for the freedom of the press that's what happens when you get needle to get thin-skinned I mean Donald Trump even blocked me on Twitter haha this is somebody who is running for president United States and I just think that we need someone in this country who's built to lead and the last thing Donald Trump is built for is leadership okay so Donald Trump is incapable of leading because he said all these things here's the problem I think Donald Trump probably is incapable of leading he is incapable of leadership and when he says good things that are immediately overshadowed by saying stupid things and if we had somebody who was on message somebody who's willing to fight and on message he'd be unstoppable I mean this this would be the time when he could make hay against Hillary Clinton who is a coward and who is weak on terror and who is weak on radical Islam but instead we get caught up in all of this by the way when CNN says it's fascist for Trump to ban the campaign it ain't good but but Hillary Clinton has done the same thing I agree you shouldn't ban the Washington Post or refused to credential them I also think that Hillary Clinton shouldn't do the same thing neither should Barack Obama you remember Obama refused to credential people to get on his to get on his campaign plane during 2008 okay so the media have been responding in the media this gives the lie by the way to the Obama wine in the Hillary line yeah we talk about everything we talk about radical Islam and we talk about gun control we talk about radical Islam and we talk about we talk about both of them both of them will talk about and we have to talk about both the reality is the left does not want to talk about radical Islam the radical the left does not want to talk about how do you stop radicalization Hillary Clinton by the way in her speech on Monday she said we have to stop the Saudis and Qatari government from funding church from funding mosques she took their money at the Clinton Foundation the whole thing is ridiculous if you want to know what the left actually believes don't look at Hillary or Barack they're they're both they're both politicians look instead to the media the media is fighting mad what's the media fighting mad about they're not mad about terrorism they don't care about terrorism instead they're fighting mad of course of course of course about guns here's Stephen Colbert leftist Stephen Colbert the least funny man on television now he used to be at least somewhat amusing now that he can't play Bill O'Reilly he just has on Bill O'Reilly and his unfunny Bill O'Reilly on to push his book and Colbert goes after O'Reilly over the Orlando shooting the reason we beat these British oppressors because everybody had a gun everybody and all these redcoats were running around and bang that's what self-protection bring us all right I think our situation is comparable to the Lexington and Concord you have to understand the history and emotion tied into the Second Amendment you have to understand there there's essentially there for self-protection by law-abiding people that's why it's there and it's not gonna be overturn well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State or something anything it's not gonna be over truck you got a deal with I don't think it's gonna be overturned with the coins and no let's let's not go better let me get that punish the people who abuse the gun okay fine punish them but I also restrict some guns who say it's possible yes it's possible okay nice isn't but also restrict some gun laws and Colbert can't deal with this argument that you need guns to protect yourself from an overarching government which is just historically ignorant in every way as I said to Piers Morgan called there's very angry and his suggestion that you only get to carry a gun as part of a state regulated militia is insane that's it's just stupid that doesn't it's historically ignorant it's not how militias worked militias drilled in absence of state authority then they were called up by the state okay in any case that's Stephen Colbert meanwhile Samantha bee who I thought at one point might have been funny but now she's just terrible she does this show on TBS and you knew it is gonna suck as soon as they called it full frontal you just knew is gonna be a brutal terrible show as soon as they called it full frontal and then all of the critics started calling her important when critics call a comic important that means the comic now sucks that's that's the that's the translation important equals suck in in critical and so they'd say that Sam B's important she's very upset because people say that they're going to pray for the victims in Orlando and she's still on this bender that Obama was on months ago after after the San Bernardino shooting thoughts and prayers don't matter here Samantha be doing that routine you heard the man the biggest most helpful thing you can do to ensure this never happens again is sit quietly in a room with your eyes closed talking to nobody wait a minute we pray after every mass shooting and yet they keep happening maybe we're not praying right can we check the instruction manual thus also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead okay and this is coming from someone who doesn't understand how prayer works this is really stupid stuff so prayer is not supposed to be the be-all end-all obviously prayer is supposed to inspire you to action and it's supposed to make a connection with your Creator closer and it's supposed to express sympathy for people who have fallen people who have died it doesn't mean that we have to embrace your stupid gun control agenda Samantha bee there's nothing in the Bible that says take away the swords of the people who want to defend themselves what absolute asininity but anybody who says we're gonna pray for people and then doesn't agree with Samantha bee she's fine with Hillary praying or Obama praying Hillary said in her speech pray for the victims she's fine with that but she's pissed if somebody like me says I'll pray for the victims because I disagree with her on policy Whoopi Goldberg - why should this go to Trevor Noah first so we're going through all the most unfunny people from Comedy Central that's Stephen Colbert who used to be on Comedy Central and is no longer funny Samantha bee who's never very funny and Trevor Noah who in the womb must have been just smacked with the unfunny jar like God God took down the various jars to make a human being and he took the humorless in his jar and he poured it all over Trevor Noah prenatally here is Trevor Noah saying that he wants your gun he wants your gun right now and the separate part is every time this happens it feels like America has already decided this is exactly the kind of country it wants to be because we know how this always plays out we're shocked we mourn we change our profile pics and then we move on it's become normal but I'm sorry I'm like maybe it's because I'm new but it's not normal and it shouldn't be normal we shouldn't allow this to be normal it's not a normal thing it's like milk from almonds or sushi from Walgreens it's not normal people that's also not normal is having the same thing happen to us over and over and over again and doing nothing to change it that's not normal okay it's not normal and he's gonna lecture us because he has a British accent that's how this works he comes over here and he's like Piers Morgan he comes over here and he lectures us about how he knows what's normal and what's not normal how about how about the rape of Europe by Muslim immigrants in terms of the crime rate how about that is that normal is that the new normal how about the destruction of the Middle East by radical Muslims is that normal or you not care about that how about the fact that the guy who just shot 49 people was a radical Muslim do you not care about that or is that the new normal for you it seems like you want to import a lot of people who believe like this guy does is that your new normal but apparently it's the new normal I'm not treating it as normal when someone gets shot that's why I'm angry at the government what I am saying is that movie nights of somebody there had the capacity to put this bastard down that would be a good thing your solution is disarm the gay guy and also the terrorists my solution is you're not going to be able to disarm the terrorists he's a terrorist disarm anybody in this disarm the gay guy in this situation and you basically guaranteed that he's unarmed against somebody with a gun but I'm hearing that the moral posturing from the left but they and they all do this they all do this and this is this is the universal appeal but it's not gonna work it's not gonna work because Americans don't want to hear about how it was the guns fault that a radical Muslim who had homosexual tendencies and went to this bar regularly apparently attempting to pick up dudes that this guy he's the reason I can't have an ar-15 just like just like Justin Bieber getting in car accidents is the reason I can't have a lab redeem me I'm sorry it has nothing to do with me this is totally dumb Whoopi Goldberg does the same thing it's a universal way from the left whenever the left says they care about terrorism and also gun control what they're really saying is we only care about gun control peace please maybe it's my age how come and don't so don't get it they do it's it's about a lot of different things you know it's about an amendment in the Constitution that people must read the Constitution doesn't say you can carry hundreds of guns it says you can you can protect your home since you can protect yourself it doesn't say get fifty five gods it's not you know and people say well we need to have our guns because we can you know go you can't hunt anything with an assault rifle you can't do it there's nothing it's God okay she doesn't know anything about quote unquote assault rifles people hunt with ar-15s all the time it's the most popular hunting rifle in the United States in any case but you know don't expect IQ points from a show that has combined less IQ points the number of fingers that I'm currently holding off there's nobody on that show with any semblance of IQ or decency and they all get it wrong I mean they're all stupid Tom Brokaw we used to be as you remember the the chief anchor on NBC right Tom Brokaw he says well you know that this is all the ar15 only one problem gang it wasn't here's Tom Brokaw well politicians will jump all over that and say we better do something about them but let's say it's a domestic shooting we've got to do something about that you know I'm a gun owner I've been saying this for months now it's time for people to come together and say enough if he had no salt weapon it was in a r14 stan mcchrystal has said not to be in civilian hands it's designed to do one thing to kill people okay first of all it wasn't an AR 14-second vote wasn't an ar-15 right president any of these things there's a completely different type of gun doesn't matter even if it were those types of guns the idea that the gun is responsible for the shooting is a way of preventive saying that the human being is not responsible the human being is never responsible in the leftist view unless the people responsible are conservative Christians it always has to be conservative Christians tomorrow will have to grab the audio of Anderson Cooper grilling Pam Bondi it's congresswoman from North Carolina suggesting that or from Florida actually suggesting that she doesn't have a right to be upset that Muslims kill gay people because she opposes same-sex marriage for the left the struggle to turn this narrative into it was a conservative Christian to turn this narrative into is a white conservative Christian it's their fault it's the nras fault it's Christians fault the struggle is real man they got to have it they got to have it it has to be their fault no matter what and they're gonna stay on this forever so Bernie Sanders by the way also wants automatic weapons ban but here here's Bernie Sanders doing the same routine it's it's horrific it's unthinkable and it just hopes go out to all those who are shocked that they can recover and I got to tell you you know but 25 years ago I believe that in this country we should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people and we have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them criminals the people who are mentally ill so that struggle continues that struggle continues that we have to take the guns out of these people's hands it's just it's amazing the myopia right we have to it's always that it's always that it's always that right it's always the same solution it's always the same solution and it must be white Christian people who are responsible for this a human rights leader that leader of the Human Rights Council he ripped into into Donald Trump because he says that it's just terrible it's just terrible Donald Trump would say he's a better friend to gays and women than Hillary Clinton even though it's true it's true Hillary Clinton who wants to import radical Muslims to the United States and kowtow to radical Muslim states yeah that doesn't make you a friend of women or gays but the Human Rights Council is very upset here he says here's him explaining it well at a time like this no person in America regardless of their political beefs beliefs should be using a tragic moment like this for their own personal ambition and their political desires and I and I think the broader community and Republicans and Democrats alike were disgusted by what we saw Donald Trump do today and I want to say two things about what he said first and foremost he is no friend to the LGBT community he is no friend and at a moment like this when a leader should put their personal ambitions and their partisan differences aside or just shut up but if they choose to speak out they should be speaking from a place of unity and a place of sympathy and talking about building bridges and I would tell you wolf I bet there is not a single family member our friend our brother or sister or girlfriend or boyfriend that is suffering from this great loss that's found any comfort in what Donald Trump had to say today instead he was up there bragging about the fact he claims he predicted this and let me say one other thing LGBTQ people we are Muslims we are women we are Latinos we are as diverse as the fabric of this nation and wolf any attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us and it's shameful and disgusting what Donald Trump did today and what he said today and I hope he says not another word about it okay so he's talking about from some original tweet as I mentioned yesterday Trump's original tweet was terrible Emery said thanks for the congrats because he had predicted the sort of thing happening in the past but you should be it's a matter of comforting the families these are two separate things you can say things to try and comfort the families or you can create policies that prevent future attacks from taking place and for him to sit there ripping into Trump well completely ignoring Obama and Hillary doing nothing and calling for gun control it just demonstrates the left is so myopic in its view and so one of the questions that has to be asked is why are so many members of the gay community on the left when it comes to fighting radical Islam and the answer is because the leftism comes before the gay identity the leftism comes before the gay identity the idea that this white patriarchal Christian society is so responsible for all the unfairness in the world will make common cause with other people who have been so-called victimized by this white patriarchal Christian society we will we will go after them together and then after we've torn down the system we'll fight with each other but but first we have to focus on tearing down the system and that means we can't go at each other because we're all minorities and because we're all minorities even if we're minorities who murder each other we have to sort of just let that go by the wayside it's it's short-sighted in the extreme it's short-sighted in the extreme because the truth is what thing what what gaze across the world have found out is that it doesn't matter what you think the motivation of radical Muslims is their rather their most their motivation is radical Islam right it's and and you can tell this okay there's a lot of attempt today to say that this guy murdered these forty nine people because he was secretly gay and struggling with it or because he's mentally ill the reality is he did it because he's a radical Muslim you know how you can tell there's another story today in Pakistan in Pakistan there was a transgender woman meaning a guy who transitioned into a female and he he was walking down the street in Pakistan and a bunch of dudes started hitting on him started soliciting him and when he refused to have sex with them they immediately took out their guns and they all shot him this was not front-page news everywhere this is anywhere this is the first time you're hearing of it I'm sure why because it's in dog bites man's story radical Pakistani Muslims shoot to death a transgender guy why is that shocking in any way why is that shocking it's not shocking in any way of course it's not shocking in the slightest it's totally it's totally not shocking because this is what radical Islamic ideology does the left refuses to acknowledge II any idea acknowledge any ideology other than its own and therefore it just pretends that none of this exists meanwhile members of the gay community continued to downplay radical Islam as as an effect here Stanley Kohn she's tweeted out this is what she tweeted we must stand against hate and discrimination whether in Islam or Christianity or Judaism whether in bullets or bathrooms hashtags stand together if you're really equated me not wanting a man to go into my daughter's bathroom with me suggesting that that man can be shot to death by a radical Muslim you're out of your damn mind you're out of your damn mind for you to suggest that Christianity's treatment of gays or Jewish treatment of games is in any way similar to Muslims treatment of gays on a global scale is insane fully crazy fully crazy but this is what the left has to suggest because again they have to lump all religions together all religion is bad but really religion is just for stupid people religion is just for stupid people and for poor people and that's why if we can just cure them of their stupidity and their poverty then everything will be all better okay time for a thing I like then something that I hate okay things I like so I'm doing a little bit more more sports books this week so sorry ladies if you're not into this sort of thing David Foster Wallace he's an author and committed suicide he's a really terrific writer I'd never read any of his stuff I was recommending this book string theory David Foster Wallace on tennis and he has some essays in there on Roger Federer and Andre Agassi and it's it's really a fun bathroom book to read the writing is really great David Foster Wallace on tennis the book is called string theory okay thing I hate the left simply cannot leave children alone the left does not want to leave children alone so according to the UK independent today finding dory which is the new Finding Nemo sequel and this is upset to me because my daughter really is into Finding Nemo shoes she has a bathing suit that looks like Nemo she's adorable she's the best finding Dory will feature Disney's first transgender character according to Ellen in the upcoming Finding Nemo sequel they said there's a stingray that becomes a sting Rhoda so there's a trans sting in the movie this is shortly after there is suggestion that there was a lesbian couple in the middle of the movie DeGeneres says this is a great thing she says I think everything we see in the media whether it's television or film or anything is she should represent everything that's happening in the world so then why aren't four presumably graphic descriptions of anal and oral sex in children's movies because there are certain things that are not appropriate for children and the fact is that when you show supposedly lesbian couples and movies the only reason to do that is because you're attempting to push a particular or sexual agenda and the reason you show heterosexual parents in movies and heterosexual couples is because these generate children okay this is this idea that you have to start a lesbian couple in a film just to show a lesbian couple to children it's it's a normalization of behavior that a lot of parents might find sinful and it may not want their children to engage in I love that she she said now I guess that there's a it's just wonderful so now we get a trans sting trans sting ridiculous ridiculous all the way through friends sting I know a guy we got a trans sting trans ray it's it's a ray and it's a rota because we have to teach children that men are women and women are men and boys are girls and girls are boys because nothing is is less risky than messing with the psyche of a child particularly on sexual issues which is where adults are confused makes perfect sense to me well that's the left okay well we'll be back tomorrow with more adventures in sanity across the United States i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
