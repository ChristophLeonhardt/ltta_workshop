good afternoon guys okay we we have a
mission today to get couch for our house
and we found a pretty good one at the
IKEA but we've been trying to figure out
how to get in the delivery was going to
take like ten days so we didn't want to
do that so anyway I found that one of
the four ideas in LA has in stock it's
like an hour away so we're gonna rent a
massive kind of moving truck and go pick
up this huge couch it's like it's gonna
be it's gonna fill up like half of our
living room but I'm so excited it's
gonna mean we can finally host people
and have them over so yeah me and B so
you're gonna go get it finally okay here
is our truck I think we're in a little
bit too big
there's only $10 more this is the other
size this is the 10-foot one we went for
the 15-foot one I think this is going to
be more than enough I'm thinking we
should jump on Craigslist and Facebook
marketplace to try and find some other
furniture just whilst we have this we're
gonna go pick up some cardboard that
were tired from all our other deliveries
see if we can dump it somewhere and then
we're heading to Ikea guys we have a
special guest she's over from Germany I
saw her last week come on I'm just a
guest wasn't very smoothly okay are you
alright
and we can hit traffic now it should be
a haul maybe on the way back on the way
back we might
okay I'm just excited that we're
actually gonna have couch
oh my god gonna be so nice that means
we'll actually want to hang out in the
living room yeah
and like like each other yeah
when Wesley loading I fell over that
rock there no you're good
these need to get this right by the mo
going between fetch a pickup
oh yeah would it take I'm trying to eat
I'm trying to look for someone to dump
the cardboard as well yeah me too
okay uh minibuses thank you do it right
here because there's some space for it
oh all right that was like an hour and
20 minutes bro we've arrived
I'm kind of excited cuz it was gonna
take 10 days if we just got it dropped
on the say to save us a lot of time I
think it's gonna be huge
yeah that's how you hold like that
thank you so much
funky funky look we are all heading up
the beach on our skateboards so first
time you've been on your skateboard in
like a year right
the Sun has set but we're gonna cruise
around apparently somewhere there's like
there's this kind of event happening
which happens after Burning Man which is
a couple of weeks ago called the
afterburn and there's something
happening anyway we're getting going to
check out yeah does it feel like you're
back at Burning Man
oh yeah
it's great
flying saucer the hug deli guys look at
the size of this dog
that is an amazing piece cruiser
I'm getting a bit of nostalgia from
Africa burn last year Africa burn if you
didn't see is like the baby brother of
burning that having snakehead count
I've never been to Burning Man I think
maybe next year might be the year
okay we've moved all of these hearts to
so far in sight we've unpacked them from
the boxes we've got under the cardboard
to return the u-haul band we are almost
ready to roll
I'll put my thrill I've got this bad boy
this is the color that's the question
you guys both comment below you decide
the size that one squared ones not
square guys I'm sorry comment below
so every morning Karen and I are morning
Karen and I are writing down five things
for I was thinking activity well it's
been a very fun night it's incredibly
satisfying that we've finally got our
safe you're in we need to add a splash
of color I think some other pillows and
stuff and then get our plants in here
and projective screen and we've got some
other plans but anyway it's mainly
excited because this is gonna be a great
space now just to sit around and chat
and socialize and know I can just
imagine many great conversations
happening on this couch so that's the
main reason I'm excited about it you
still need to do something about this
situation and I've got I bought an
orbital sander the other day my dad
advised me a bit of a ways and carpentry
stuff
and the table that we pulled back on our
boosted boards the other day say yeah
it's plenty more to do but the house is
slowly taking shape and yeah I'll

times but he is the last and final
housemate to move in and we've just been
