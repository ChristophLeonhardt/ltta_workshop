today I'm doing a much requested video I'm going to do with the mainstream media just won't do and can't be trusted to do and that's cover maxine Bernays new party fairly now before I get to the news let me first just say I want to cover Maxine Bernays new party the very same way I covered the United conservative party leadership race I don't think our viewers could tell who if anyone I supported and I like it that way I'll cover the new party the very same way I cover the Conservative Party of Canada as in I will spare no criticism when the party deserves it and I will champion good ideas to make government cheaper and less intrusive in all of our lives wherever those ideas may come from besides this is what the mainstream media thinks of Bernier supporters as for Bernie look there's no part of his stance on immigration and identity that is libertarian he wants to lead a libertarian party and he else wants to lead anti-immigrant party his supporters on Twitter seemed to be that tiny Venn intersection of people who think it's great that Donald Trump is the president of the United States and people who think that Maxine Bernier would be like Donald Trump you you cannot have been paying much attention to max Bernie over the last 20 years to entertain that fantasy very far so basically his voter base right now is the stupidest people on Twitter and so we'll see how far that gets them no comment isn't that disgusting that clip is in part why people will support someone like Maxime Bernie over Andrew Shearer because people want to support someone who will take on Paul wells and the CBC for this kind of casual slander they want to support someone who will push back when normal people are called racists and all right and the phobic adjective of the moment that's why the media will never cover Bernie Farrelly they hate him because he isn't scared of them he doesn't know his place they think by the way we never heard a peep from the conservative part of Canada when Bernier supporters were called names on the CBC and last time I checked the Conservative Party of Canada needs those people back in the conservative fold because those Bernie supporters are needed for the Conservatives to win the next election and that's a big problem the silence anyway let's get to the Bernie news from the one media outlet that doesn't think conservatives are the scum of the earth the name for the new party was just announced it is the People's Party of Canada I hate the newly announced party name with a burning passion of a thousand suns and it looks like other people hate it too it sounds so Maoist and reminds me of North Korea and then Hillary Clinton's horrible North Korean style tunic pants suits and makes me think less about Maxine Bernie and more about Bernie Sanders it's a Bernie Sanders kind of name I hate hate hate the new name but that's just me I'll probably get over it eventually and maybe the rest of the country isn't looking for the Red Scare under every Rock the way I completely acknowledge I sometimes can be maybe the rest of the country will miss the blatant communist connotations of the new name I sure hope so but I think I know why Bernie a named the party that way after the broad mass appeal of Doug Fords for the people campaign in Ontario and his success at obliterating the Liberals in their own strongholds maybe Bernays trying to capitalize on that next news the People's Party of Canada is musing about joining the Libertarian Party of Canada I think this is good I really like this I wouldn't say that I am a libertarian but I am absolutely sympathetic to libertarian ideas and on many many issues like gun rights free trade and the welfare state I would say that we are fellow travelers in the right-wing sphere I think the conservative movement is better with the libertarians in the fold promoting ideas of smaller government they're a gut-check and they have long been ignored and alienated relegated to the fringe in Canadian politics getting them engaged and involved and mobilize is a very good burn a move he needs their support they need his now this is what the current libertarian leader Tim Moen had to say about joining forces with the People's Party I'll be honest with you I am NOT a fan of the name of his new party the People's Party sounds a little bit - yeah left-wing for me but I can live with whatever the name is as long as it's it's a principled party and so I have to trust that max now is going to present me with the principled Constitution principles and and policies he's got the right platform he's got a decent platformer but that platform is less important to me than what the the DNA of this party is and I think that he's demonstrated to me that he would like to have us in party leadership over there and the People's Party and and so that demonstrates to me that he wants to keep this a fairly principled party and I'll wait to see what he says next week but I think that the membership will be faced with a vote on whether we merge parties with him now there's there's pros and cons to this but personally I think that the upside vastly overshadows the downside risk next news on the Bernie beat the mainstream media thinks the People's Party is attracting racist because of course they do from this CBC the official party is People's Party of Canada yay it features a smiling picture of Bernie a run down of his platform in a pitch for people to sign up as founding members to receive a personalized certificate signed by the leader on the other hand there's the website the people's party dot CA which redirects users somewhere else entirely to a controversial reddit discussion group bernie a spokesperson was unaware of the situation until contacted by the CBC News on Tuesday we have nothing to do with this we did not even know that this stuff existed Bernie a spokesperson mass said if only the c.b.c would take such an interest in the actual racists and anti-semites in the NDP and their constant anti-israel BDS campaigns as harshly as they cover random reddit trolls who buy URLs Bernier on the other hand tweeted out i hear that certain groups and individuals are causing trouble on the PPC's Facebook pages questioning some of the fundamental principles of our party and trying to steer it in a different direction I launched this party to offer Canadians a different option at the next election based on the ideas that put people first that I ran on during the CPC leadership campaign last year I have been defending these principles for over a decade they are not negotiable everybody is welcome if they share these principles whether they voted for any of the other parties before or did not vote at all PPC members will have an input on specific policies as they are refined and will nominate local candidates but to those who want mass immigration this is not your party if you want Ottawa to intervene more in provincial jurisdictions or you prefer protectionism to free trade the PPC will not defend this if you're obsessed with racial differences go debate it elsewhere don't waste your time with the PPC if you want to promote ideas that clearly contradict the basic principles that define it no group will hijack this party and turn it into something else you are free to launch your own party good luck so that's the latest on Bernie everyone look I know the New People's Party is splitted dividing the broad and perpetually stable Stephen Harper big tent conservative coalition yes that's true I agree and I don't like it and I think Bernie should have stayed in the party to push his ideas forward until the party threw him out and after Bernie a left Shearer should have stopped the bleeding by opening up for discussion the ideas Bernie's supporters really care about none of this had to happen this way but you know what here we are and despite my criticism for both sides I will not resort to Paul Wells CBC style coverage of conservatives from either party at the rebel we're going to be fair to both sides because you know what no one else is maybe Bernier will even show how fearless he is in the face of the mainstream media bullying and do what Shearer won't and come on our rebel shows and speak directly to our viewers that would send the mainstream media into a beautiful five-alarm freakout wouldn't it I guess I'll close by offering a little bit of opinion and a little bit of advice conservatives pride ourselves on being people of principle we don't blindly follow a leader if we think the leader is wrong it's one of our best qualities and it's one of our worst qualities for political parties to try to manage its what leads us to have these breakaway parties when the big party drifts left it happened in Alberta with the Wildrose cracking away from the Progressive Conservatives it happened federally when the reform broke away from the federal pcs and then formed opposition the best way for any truly conservative party to avoid dividing itself into dissident movements like the Wildrose and the reform is to actually stay conservative and ignore the pull to be liked by the mainstream media serve the people not the people who hate you for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read on the topic of serving the people I have a new petition at 50,000 a and it calls on the Trudeau government to take care of the people who served us our Canadian Forces and Canadian Forces veterans by treating them better than we do fake migrants go to 50,000 CA to see the full story and to sign my petition
