Putin's first visit for bilateral talks to Germany since 2014 although mrs. Merkel has visited Russia several times since then most notably back in May many outlets are hitting the headlines with these this meeting questioning who can come out on top who can get what from these meetings who is the better negotiator very much it's a case of realpolitik for Miss that mrs. Merkel and mr. Putin the two have been forced somewhat closer together because of a rift between America and Donald Trump and Europe over the Iran nuclear deal and tariffs and of course additional US sanctions on to Russia it's become a sort of marriage of convenience the pair have clashed the numerous issues but of course they do also agree on some mrs. Merkel has said this as a working visit don't expect much from this meeting it has been a message although she did say that $1 the relationship with Russia is necessary to keep communication going not surprising perhaps given the amount on of hot topics on the agenda Syria being the top one as the country moves from an active battlefield military phase to negotiations about spheres of influence and the interests of various actors mrs. Merkel has said that talks on Syria could bring some progress between the various differences of Trump macron earth-1 etc that will be one of the topics very much on the agenda in this meeting mr. sports cannot enter a meeting on Syria between Germany France Russia and Turkey could be useful it needs to be well prepared that's the reason why there is no date for it yet we are working on a prepare to a meeting of our advisors and afterwards we will decide whether such a meeting makes sense this meetings also symbolic for mrs. marker as the one of the unofficial leaders of Europe if you will a stalwart as leaders in countries as the US UK in France of moved on Merkel has remained and maintained a relationship with mr. Putin it's an opportunity for the Russian president as well to make take steps towards ending Russia's isolation perhaps winding down of sanctions except for something that Russia has been aiming to do over the last few years economic cooperation as well the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which will enable gas to flow from Russia to Germany avoiding Ukraine an issue as well which Trump criticized Merkel and Germany for being reliant on rush of being dependent upon Russia that is something on which the two leaders have found and will continue to find common cause the last issue of course is Ukraine touching upon the peacemaking process there the Minsk Accords how to move them forward and complete that process bringing that conflict to a close now as I said earlier as other leaders have come and gone mrs. Merkel has remained and despite being quite an implacable critic of mr. Putin on some issues she has always maintained a cordial relationship with the Russian president oh mama we don't know each other well enough but I'm amazed by her ability to listen this is for Kanto civilization it is know that the Russian president likes to drink German beer and sometimes there's a possibility that we can make exchanges I have also gotten very good smoked fish angular from time to time sends a couple of bottles of Raider burger beard however Germany is not Putin's only stop off on Saturday before he gets there he's paying a social visit attending the wedding of Austrian Foreign Minister Karen Kim nestle and businessman Wolfgang Malinga the ceremony will take place at a vineyard in Austria's stereo state and while some are guessing whether Putin will often a dance to the bride and what present he has for the couple others have slammed the Foreign Minister for daring to invite him you
