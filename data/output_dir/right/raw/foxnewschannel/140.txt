1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:01,959
YOU ARE OUT.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,327
DEFENDING AMERICA IS SUDDENLY A

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,429
FIRING OFFENSE ON THE LEFT.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,464
MARK LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY.

5
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,333
HE WASN'T SIMPLY A LOYAL

6
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:10,534
DEMOCRAT.

7
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:12,570
HE WAS THE HEAD OF

8
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,571
ALLEGHENY COUNTY DEMOCRATIC

9
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,306
PARTY, ALSO A MILITARY VETERAN.

10
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,073
YOU THINK HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO

11
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:16,840
STICK UP FOR AMERICA ONCE IN A

12
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:18,576
WHILE, BUT NO.

13
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,977
HE MADE THE MISTAKE OF WRITING

14
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,545
THIS IN A FACEBOOK POST.

15
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:23,113
"I STAND FOR THE FLY, I KNEEL AT

16
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:23,881
THE CROSS.

17
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:25,382
NOT SO LONG AGO MOST DEMOCRATS

18
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:26,116
WOULD HAVE NODDED IN AGREEMENT

19
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:27,785
AT THAT, TODAY IT'S HATE SPEECH

20
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:29,086
AND HE LOST HIS JOB.

21
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,821
TONIGHT THERE LOSS IS OUR GAIN

22
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,156
AND MARK JOINS US NOW.

23
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,291
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING ON THE

24
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:35,526
SHOW.

25
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,194
DID I MISS STATE THAT?

26
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:37,962
DID YOU HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR JOB

27
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,797
RUNNING THE COUNTY'S

28
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,165
REPUBLICAN -- THROUGHOUT THE

29
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,366
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE OF

30
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:43,534
THOSE WORDS ON FACEBOOK?

31
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:44,868
>> I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

32
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:48,405
OF THE COUNTY PARTY AND, YES,

33
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,206
BASICALLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

34
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:50,307
HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THAT POST,

35
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:51,742
WHICH I REMIND YOU WAS OVER A

36
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:54,345
YEAR AGO THAT I POSTED THAT.

37
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,213
I WAS ASKED TO RESIGN, YES.

38
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:57,781
>> Tucker: YOU ARE A VETERAN

39
00:00:57,782 --> 00:00:59,116
AND YOU SAY YOU STAND FOR OUT

40
00:00:59,117 --> 00:00:59,850
THE FLAG AND YOU WERE DENOUNCED

41
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,386
AS A RACIST FOR THAT.

42
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:02,786
>> CORRECT.

43
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:04,488
THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THIS TO

44
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,725
LIGHT TRIED TO TIE IT TO THE NFL

45
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,094
PLAYERS TAKING ANY.

46
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,396
>> Tucker: SO, LOOK, I'M

47
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:12,763
CONFUSED.

48
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:13,964
I MET A DEMOCRATIC VOTER, NEVER

49
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:14,698
HAVE BEEN, BUT I'VE BEEN HERE A

50
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,268
LONG TIME.

51
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:17,901
I'VE KNOWN A LOT OF DECENT

52
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:19,403
PATRIOTIC DEMOCRATS.

53
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,537
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT LONG

54
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,939
AGO IT WOULD'VE BEEN WEIRD FOR

55
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,140
THE HEAD OF A PENNSYLVANIA

56
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:23,907
DEMOCRATIC COUNTY PARTY TO SAY I

57
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:28,646
STAND FOR THE FLAG AND KNEEL

58
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:29,747
BEFORE THE CROSS.

59
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:30,948
WOULD IT HAVE BEEN FIVE YEARS

60
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:32,016
AGO?

61
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:32,516
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

62
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,551
AND I CAN TELL YOU EVEN LAST

63
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,185
YEAR WHEN THE PITTSBURGH

64
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,287
STEELERS DECIDED TO STAY IN THE

65
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:36,987
LOCKER ROOM INSTEAD OF COME UP

66
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:40,324
WITH THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, ONE

67
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:43,427
PLAYER, AN ARMY RANGER, CAME OUT

68
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:44,561
AND STOOD BY HIMSELF WITH HIS

69
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,663
HAND OVER HIS HEART AND HE WAS

70
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,364
NOT CONSIDERED A RACIST.

71
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:49,099
EVEN AS MUCH AS A YEAR AGO, IT

72
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,101
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNHEARD OF

73
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:53,003
TO HEAR A LEADER IN THE PARTY

74
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,506
DEFEND THE FLAG.

75
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,374
>> Tucker: YOU WHERE THE

76
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,542
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PARTY.

77
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,144
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW A LOT OF

78
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:04,381
DEMOCRATS INTERCOUNTY.

79
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,249
WHAT HAS YOUR FORMER COWORKER

80
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,984
SAID TO YOU SINCE THIS HAPPENED?

81
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:08,352
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANY OF

82
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:08,652
THEM.

83
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:09,585
I UNDERSTAND THE PARTY LINE IS

84
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:11,588
THAT IT IS A PERSONAL MATTER,

85
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,590
AND I CAN RESPECT THAT.

86
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,658
HOWEVER, THOSE THAT ARE ELECTED

87
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,027
OFFICIALS OR PARTY MEMBERS WHO

88
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,462
ARE NOT TIED WITH MY DIRECT SORT

89
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,963
OF CHANGE OF COMMAND, IF YOU

90
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:20,731
WILL, I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANY

91
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:22,466
OF THEM.

92
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,767
>> Tucker: 'S THAT'S SHOCKING.

93
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,601
WHAT DOES THIS SAY TO YOU ABOUT

94
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,870
HOW THE PARTY HAS CHANGED?

95
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,740
>> WELL, IT MAKES ME WONDER IF

96
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,041
THERE IS ROOM FOR MODERATE

97
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,876
DEMOCRATS IN THE DEMOCRATIC

98
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:34,411
PARTY NOWADAYS.

99
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:36,747
THERE WERE SOME ELECTED

100
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:37,948
OFFICIALS WHO SAID THAT THEY

101
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,649
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'VE KNOWN

102
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,883
ME AND I AM NOT A RACIST.

103
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,786
HOWEVER, IT WAS INSENSITIVE.

104
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,355
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IF MY

105
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,357
PATRIOTISM AND STANDING UP FOR

106
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,659
FAMILY FRIENDS HAS BECOME

107
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,928
INSENSITIVE, THEN I THINK WE AS

108
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:51,895
DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP AND

109
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:54,064
REEVALUATE EXACTLY WHAT WE STAND

110
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:54,365
FOR.

111
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,133
>> Tucker: IF STANDING UP FOR

112
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,601
THE FLAG IS CONSIDERED RACIST,

113
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:58,602
THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE COUNTRY

114
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,805
DO YOU THINK GOING FORWARD?

115
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,940
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

116
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:04,241
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

117
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:04,975
>> Tucker: WHAT ARE YOU GOING

118
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,678
TO DO?

119
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,545
>> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO

120
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:11,782
CONTINUE TO BRING THIS TO LIGHT

121
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,150
AND CONTINUE TO VOICE CONCERN

122
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,751
FOR THIS VERY ISSUE.

123
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:16,754
AND THEN IN THE SHORT TERM,

124
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:17,521
IRONICALLY, MY SON IS GOING IN

125
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,390
THE AIR FORCE IN 60 DAYS SO I'M

126
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,257
GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH

127
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:22,793
HIM, AND THEN I WILL CONTINUE TO

128
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:23,961
FIGHT THIS BECAUSE AS LONG AS I

129
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:26,096
CAN AND CONTINUE TO CLEAR MY

130
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:26,897
NAME.

131
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:27,765
>> Tucker: GOD BLESS.

132
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:30,200
AND LET ME JUST SAY, AGAIN, I'M

133
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:31,068
NOT A SUPPORTER OF THE

134
00:03:31,069 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BUT I HOPE YOU
