ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY, SAFETY 

110

AND YOU'LL RIGHTFULLY HAVE SOME 

112
01:50:35,394 --> 01:50:36,495
HARD QUESTIONS FOR ME TO ANSWER.

113
01:50:36,495 --> 01:50:37,630

WE'RE TAKING TO ADDRESS THEM, I 

115
01:50:39,832 --> 01:50:42,602
WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT 

116
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:43,036
HERE.

117
01:50:43,036 --> 01:50:45,605
FACEBOOK IS AN IDEALISTIC AND 

118
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:46,206
OPTIMISTIC COMPANY.

119
01:50:46,206 --> 01:50:48,407
FOR MOST OF OUR EXISTENCE, WE 

120
01:50:48,407 --> 01:50:51,044
FOCUSED ON ALL OF THE GOOD THAT 

121
01:50:51,044 --> 01:50:52,779

122
01:50:52,779 --> 01:50:55,014
AS FACEBOOK HAS GROWN, PEOPLE 

123
01:50:55,014 --> 01:50:55,848
EVERYWHERE HAVE GOTTEN A 

124
01:50:55,848 --> 01:50:57,116
POWERFUL NEW TOOL FOR STAYING 

125
01:50:57,116 --> 01:50:59,419
CONNECTED TO THE PEOPLE THEY 

126
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:00,787

127
01:51:00,787 --> 01:51:01,287
HEARD, AND FOR BUILDING 

128
01:51:01,287 --> 01:51:03,556
COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES.

129
01:51:03,556 --> 01:51:05,825
JUST RECENTLY, WE'VE SEEN THE ME

130
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:08,027
TOO MOVEMENT AND THE MARCH FOR 

131
01:51:08,027 --> 01:51:09,128
OUR LIVES ORGANIZED AT LEAST IN 

132
01:51:09,128 --> 01:51:11,664
PART ON FACEBOOK.

133
01:51:11,664 --> 01:51:14,034
AFTER HURRICANE HARVEY, PEOPLE 

134
01:51:14,034 --> 01:51:16,735
CAME TOGETHER TO RAISE MORE THAN

135
01:51:16,735 --> 01:51:17,637
$20 MILLION FOR RELIEF, AND MORE

136
01:51:17,637 --> 01:51:19,872
THAN 70 MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES

137
01:51:19,872 --> 01:51:23,443
USE FACEBOOK TO CREATE JOBS AND 

138
01:51:23,443 --> 01:51:23,643
GROW.

139
01:51:23,643 --> 01:51:25,077
BUT IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT WE 

140
01:51:25,077 --> 01:51:26,512
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT 

141
01:51:26,512 --> 01:51:31,818
THESE TOOLS FROM BEING USED FOR 

142
01:51:31,818 --> 01:51:32,752
HARM AS WELL, AND THAT FWGOES F 

143
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:34,287
FAKE NEWS, FOREIGN INTERFERENCE 

144
01:51:34,287 --> 01:51:35,888
IN ELECTIONS AND HATE SPEECH, AS

145
01:51:35,888 --> 01:51:37,256
WELL AS DEVELOPERS AND DATA 

146
01:51:37,256 --> 01:51:37,924
PRIVACY.

147
01:51:37,924 --> 01:51:38,925
WE DIDN'T TAKE A BROAD ENOUGH 

148
01:51:38,925 --> 01:51:41,060
VIEW OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY, AND 

149
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:43,929
THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

150
01:51:43,929 --> 01:51:47,433
IT WAS MY MISTAKE AND I'M SORRY.

151
01:51:47,433 --> 01:51:47,933
I STARTED FACEBOOK.

152
01:51:47,933 --> 01:51:49,669
I RUN IT.

153
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:53,106
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT 

154
01:51:53,106 --> 01:51:53,973
HAPPENS HERE.

155
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:57,143
SO NOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL

156
01:51:57,143 --> 01:51:58,544
OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE

157
01:51:58,544 --> 01:52:01,247
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING 

158
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:02,682
A BROAD ENOUGH VIEW OF OUR 

159
01:52:02,682 --> 01:52:03,049
RESPONSIBILITY.

160
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:04,450
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST CONNECT 

161
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:04,818
PEOPLE.

162
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:05,851
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE 

163
01:52:05,851 --> 01:52:07,854
CONNECTIONS ARE POSITIVE.

164
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:08,888
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GIVE 

165
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:09,989
PEOPLE A VOICE.

166
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,591
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

167
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:13,125
AREN'T USING IT TO HARM OTHER 

168
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:13,559
PEOPLE OR TO SPREAD 

169
01:52:13,559 --> 01:52:15,595
MISINFORMATION.

170
01:52:15,595 --> 01:52:17,963
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST GIVE 

171
01:52:17,963 --> 01:52:18,832
PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR 

172
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:19,132
INFORMATION.

173
01:52:19,132 --> 01:52:21,668
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

174
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:22,268
DEVELOPERS THEY SHARE IT WITH 

175
01:52:22,268 --> 01:52:25,104
PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION TOO.

176
01:52:25,104 --> 01:52:26,472
ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE A 

177
01:52:26,472 --> 01:52:29,642
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT JUST BUILD

178
01:52:29,642 --> 01:52:30,276
TOOLS BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

179
01:52:30,276 --> 01:52:32,245
THEY'RE USED FOR GOOD.

180
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:34,013
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK 

181
01:52:34,013 --> 01:52:34,914
THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES WE NEED 

182
01:52:34,914 --> 01:52:36,883
TO MAKE ACROSS THE COMPANY, BUT 

183
01:52:36,883 --> 01:52:39,219
I'M COMMITTED TO GETTING THIS 

184
01:52:39,219 --> 01:52:39,419
RIGHT.

185
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:41,320
THIS INCLUDES THE BASIC 

186
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,223
RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING 

187
01:52:43,223 --> 01:52:44,156
PEOPLE'S INFORMATION WHICH WE 

188
01:52:44,156 --> 01:52:47,594
FAILED TO DO WITH CAMBRIDGE 

189
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:47,861
ANALYTICA.

190
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:49,829
SO, HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 

191
01:52:49,829 --> 01:52:51,798
WE ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THIS AND

192
01:52:51,798 --> 01:52:54,400
TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING 

193
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:54,934
AGAIN.

194
01:52:54,934 --> 01:52:56,068
FIRST, WE'RE GETTING TO THE 

195
01:52:56,068 --> 01:52:58,804
BOTTOM OF EXACTLY WHAT CAMBRIDGE

196
01:52:58,804 --> 01:53:00,773
ANALYTICA DID AND TELLING 

197
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,141
EVERYONE AFFECTED.

198
01:53:02,141 --> 01:53:03,376
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THAT 

199
01:53:03,376 --> 01:53:05,077
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA IMPROPERLY 

200
01:53:05,077 --> 01:53:06,078
ACCESSED SOME INFORMATION ABOUT 

201
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:08,982
MILLIONS OF FACEBOOK MEMBERS BY 

202
01:53:08,982 --> 01:53:13,219
BUYING IT FROM AN APP DEVELOPER.

203
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:14,921
THAT INFORMATION -- THIS WAS 

204
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:15,821
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE 

205
01:53:15,821 --> 01:53:16,922
GENERALLY SHARE PUBLICLY ON 

206
01:53:16,922 --> 01:53:20,226
THEIR FACEBOOK PAGES, LIKE NAMES

207
01:53:20,226 --> 01:53:21,727
AND THEIR PROFILE PICTURE AND 

208
01:53:21,727 --> 01:53:22,829
THE PAGES THEY FOLLOW.

209
01:53:22,829 --> 01:53:24,697
WHEN WE FIRST CONTACTED 

210
01:53:24,697 --> 01:53:26,132
CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, THEY TOLD 

211
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:28,133
US THAT THEY HAD DELETED THE 

212
01:53:28,133 --> 01:53:28,401
DATA.

213
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:29,936
ABOUT A MONTH AGO WE HEARD NEW 

214
01:53:29,936 --> 01:53:31,771
REPORTS THAT SUGGESTED THAT 

215
01:53:31,771 --> 01:53:32,472
WASN'T TRUE.

216
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:34,240
AND NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH 

217
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,441
GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.S., THE 

218
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:36,809
U.K. AND AROUND THE WORLD TO DO 

219
01:53:36,809 --> 01:53:38,277
A FULL AUDIT OF WHAT THEY'VE 

220
01:53:38,277 --> 01:53:39,545
DONE AND TO MAKE SURE THEY GET 

221
01:53:39,545 --> 01:53:40,179
RID OF ANY DATA THEY MAY STILL 

222
01:53:40,179 --> 01:53:43,583
HAVE.

223
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:45,384
SECOND, TO MAKE SURE NO OTHER 

224
01:53:45,384 --> 01:53:47,386
APP DEVELOPERS OUT THERE ARE 

225
01:53:47,386 --> 01:53:48,821
MISUSING DATA, WE'RE NOW 

226
01:53:48,821 --> 01:53:49,922
INVESTIGATING EVERY SINGLE APP 

227
01:53:49,922 --> 01:53:51,257
THAT HAD ACCESS TO A LARGE 

228
01:53:51,257 --> 01:53:53,326
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE 

229
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:53,559
PAST.

230
01:53:53,559 --> 01:53:54,894
IF WE FIND THAT SOMEONE 

231
01:53:54,894 --> 01:53:59,532
IMPROPERLY USED DATA, WE'RE 

232
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:01,401
GOING TO BAN THEM FROM FACEBOOK 

233
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:02,435
AND TELL EVERYONE EFFECTED.

234
01:54:02,435 --> 01:54:03,970
THIRD, TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER

235
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:04,837
HAPPENING AGAIN GOING FORWARD, 

236
01:54:04,837 --> 01:54:06,072
WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT 

237
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:07,173
DEVELOPERS CAN'T ACCESS AS MUCH 

238
01:54:07,173 --> 01:54:07,807
INFORMATION NOW.

239
01:54:07,807 --> 01:54:09,976
THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT WE 

240
01:54:09,976 --> 01:54:11,978
ALREADY MADE BIG CHANGES TO OUR 

241
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:14,747
PLATFORM IN 2014 THAT WOULD HAVE

242
01:54:14,747 --> 01:54:17,383
PREVENTED THIS SPECIFIC 

243
01:54:17,383 --> 01:54:17,916
SITUATION WITH CAMBRIDGE 

244
01:54:17,916 --> 01:54:19,284
ANALYTICA FROM OCCURRING AGAIN 

245
01:54:19,284 --> 01:54:19,619
TODAY.

246
01:54:19,619 --> 01:54:21,320
BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO AND YOU 

247
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,688
CAN FIND MORE DETAILS ON THE 

248
01:54:22,688 --> 01:54:25,925
STEPS WE'RE TAKING IN MY WRITTEN

249
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:26,192
STATEMENT.

250
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:29,161
MY TOP PRIORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

251
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:31,264
OUR SOCIAL MISSION OF CONNECTING

252
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:32,698

BRINGING THE WORLD CLOSER 

254
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:36,202
TOGETHER.

255
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:37,637
ADVERTISERS AND DEVELOPERS WILL 

256
01:54:37,637 --> 01:54:39,839
NEVER TAKE PRIORITY OVER THAT AS

257
01:54:39,839 --> 01:54:42,041
LONG AS I'M RUNNING FACEBOOK.

258
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:44,277
I STARTED FACEBOOK WHEN I WAS IN

259
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:44,644
COLLEGE.

260
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:48,314
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE 

261
01:54:48,314 --> 01:54:48,514

MOST.

01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:59,392
I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN WHAT WE'RE 

269
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:01,827

AS OF THIS -- EARLY THIS YEAR,

326
01:58:45,951 --> 01:58:47,987
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, 

327
01:58:47,987 --> 01:58:49,455
CONGRESS IS REALLY LOOKING TO 

328
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:51,557
MAKE LARGER, MORE ROBUST CHANGES

329
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:53,526
WHEN IT COMES TO OVERSIGHT.
