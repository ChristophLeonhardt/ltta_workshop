REPORTING AND I'M GLAD TO SEE A

4
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,698
LOT OF IT WAS INDICATED.

THEN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP YET

13
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:19,678
KEY PLAYERS ARE NOT OVER WHETHER

14
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:20,813
THAT MEANS THERE BIAS IMPACTED

15
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,982
THEIR INVESTIGATION.

16
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:28,787
>> THIS REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY

17
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:29,488

>> CHRIS WRAY, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE

22
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:37,696
WRONG.

23
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,064
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

24
00:00:39,064 --> 00:00:42,100
THIS IS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTING

25
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,434
REPORT.

26
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:46,638

ANDREW McCARTHY.

29

HE'S BEEN TRACKING THIS A LONG

TIME WITH ALL THE MUELLER STUFF.

31
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:55,247
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

THANK YOU.

>> Shannon: LET'S TALK A

35
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,051
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'VE

36
00:00:59,051 --> 00:00:59,851
LEARNED TODAY.

37
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,687
I WANT TO START WITH THIS

38
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,855
COMMENT FROM CONGRESSMAN TREY

39
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,491
GOWDY EARLIER TONIGHT ON

40
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:06,992
"SPECIAL REPORT."

41
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:08,994
>> PETER STRZOK, THE FBI AGENT

42
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:10,629
WHO WAS ON HILLARY CLINTON'S

43
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:11,363
INVESTIGATION ARGUABLY THE LEAD

44
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,299
RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR, NOT ONLY

45
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,234
WANTED TO STOP HIS CAMPAIGN BUT

46
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:18,203
ONCE HE WON, GOT ON THE MUELLER

47
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,137
PROBE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO

48
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:20,272
IMPEACH HIM.

49
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:23,875
THAT'S A LEVEL OF ANIMUS AND

50
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,943
BIAS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD

51
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:25,277
REJECT.

52
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,912
>> Shannon: AND D, THE OVERALL

53
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:27,412
CONCLUSION OF THE

54
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:28,113
INSPECTOR GENERAL IS THAT IF

55
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,348
THERE WAS POLITICAL BIAS, THEY

56
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:31,883
DIDN'T SEE EVIDENCE IT THAT

57
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,884
FACTORED INTO ANY DECISIONS

58
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,286
MADE ON THE INVESTIGATION.

59
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,921
DOES THAT SETTLE IT FOR YOU?

60
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,856
>> NO, IT REALLY DOESN'T.

61
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:38,890
THINK ABOUT HOW CAREFULLY THEIR

62
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,893
WORDING THIS.

63
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,461
I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY

64
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,096
SAY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE BECAUSE

65
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,464
THAT MEANS THERE IS NO

66
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:47,866
SUGGESTION IN THE RECORD THAT

67
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,668
BIAS COULD HAVE BEEN A FACTOR.

68
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,671
WHILE THEY ARE SAYING HERE AND

69
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,674
IT'S VERY CAREFULLY DONE IS THAT

70
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,742
WHILE THE IG WAS EVALUATING WAS

71
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,777
A SERIES OF JUDGMENT CALLS AND

72
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:01,680
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO

73
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,247
SECOND-GUESS PEOPLE'S

74
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,251
DISCRETIONARY JUDGMENT BECAUSE

75
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:06,918
THEIR METRIC WAS, WAS THE

76
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,455
DECISION MADE A RATIONAL, NOT

77
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:11,323
WHETHER THEY AGREED WITH FEDERAL

78
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:12,357
WHETHER IT WAS THE ONLY DECISION

79
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,059
THAT COULD'VE BEEN MADE

80
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,060
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

81
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,294
IF THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE COMING

82
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:18,496
FROM AND YOU'RE ALSO SAYING AT

83
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,032
THE SAME TIME THERE IS PERVASIVE

84
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,368
EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD BIAS,

85
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:24,502
THEY CAN'T RULE OUT THE FACT

86
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:28,707
THAT BIAS MAY HAVE PLAYED IN AND

87
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:29,874
MAY HAVE BEEN DECISIVE.

88
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:30,642
WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SAYING IS

89
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:34,846
WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE HERE FROM

90
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,314
WHICH WE CAN CONCLUDE FOR

91
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:38,316
CERTAINTY THAT BIAS WAS WHAT THE

92
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,651
DRIVING FACTOR WAS HERE.

93
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,052
BUT THEY CAN'T DISCOUNT IT.

94
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:43,287
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO SAY

95
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,856
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT BIAS

96
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:46,090
PLAYED A ROLE HERE IS JUST

97
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,691
PREPOSTEROUS.

98
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,660
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE REPORT SAYS.

99
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,560
>> Shannon: WELL, IT FEELS A

100
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,496
LITTLE BIT LIKE THE DAVID JAMES

101
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,197
COMEY, THEN FBI DIRECTOR, CAME

102
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,699
OUT AND OUTLINED THIS ENTIRE

103
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:55,433
CASE WHAT HAPPENED WITH

104
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,701
HILLARY CLINTON AND THEN AT THE

105
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,270
END SAID BUT THERE'S NOTHING

106
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,771
PROSECUTABLE HERE.

107
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,874
WERE GOING TO DECLINE TO MOVE

108
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:04,108
FORWARD WITH ANY RECOMMENDATION

109
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:04,676
ALONG THAT LINE.

110
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:05,576
SOMETHING I LEARNED FOR THE

111
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,278
FIRST TIME TODAY HERE IS THAT

112
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:07,979
THERE WERE FIVE DIFFERENT FBI

113
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,248
EMPLOYEES THEY FOUND TEXT AND

114
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,849
MESSAGES THAT THEY WERE

115
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,483
CONCERNED ABOUT.

116
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,217
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT PETER STRZOK

117
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,152
AND LISA PAGE BUT THERE WERE

118
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:14,852
OTHER PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE A

119
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:17,288
NAME YET FOUR.

120
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:20,291
DO YOU THINK WE WILL GET THOSE?

121
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,560
>> I THINK EVENTUALLY WILL GET A

122
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,595
LOT MORE INFORMATION THAN WE

123
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,064
HAVE NOT, PARTICULARLY IN THE

124
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:26,864
CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS.

125
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:29,133
AND I THINK WHERE WE WILL END UP

126
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,902
GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION,

127
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:32,070
SHANNON, IS WHEN WE GET THE

128
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,804
OTHER HALF OF THE STORY.

129
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,338
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT

130
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,874
HAPPENED HERE.

131
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:38,576
THE FBI AND THIS IS EVIDENT FROM

132
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:42,080
THE TEXT MESSAGES OF STRZOK AND

133
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,748
PAGE, THEY CONSIDERED THE

134
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:44,482
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION AND

135
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:48,052
THE TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

136
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:48,753
AS A SINGLE CONTINUUM TO THE

137
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:53,224
POINT THAT WHEN CREWS DROPPED

138
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:54,492
OUT OF THE RACE AND IT WAS CLEAR

139
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,293
TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE THE

140
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,762
NOMINEE, THE FIRST THING THESE

141
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,797
TO SAY IS, AND REACTING TO TRUMP

142
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:00,898
BEING THE NOMINEE, MAN, WE'VE

143
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:04,535
GOT TO GET THIS HILLARY CLINTON

144
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,303
EMAIL INVESTIGATION DONE.

145
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:07,872
RATCHETS UP THE PRESSURE TO AND

146
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,973
MADE YOUR EXAM, WHICH IS WHAT

147
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:09,440
THEY CALLED IT.

148
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,275
AND THE MINDS OF THE AGENTS,

149
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:15,679
THIS WAS ONE SERIES OF

150
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,514
INVESTIGATIONS TOGETHER THAT

151
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:17,515
IMPACTED THE ELECTION.

152
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,517
AND THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT

153
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:22,086
IS YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE

154
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,854
DIFFERENT DECISIONS THAT GOT

155
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:24,622
WAITED BY INSPECTOR GENERAL

156
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:27,291
HOROWITZ AND LOOK AT THEM IN THE

157
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:27,992
ISOLATION OF THE CLINTON EMAIL

158
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:30,094
CASE AND SAY YEAH, YOU KNOW,

159
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:30,928
THAT LOOKS REASONABLE.

160
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,096
MAYBE THAT'S REASONABLE.

161
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,797
MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE WHAT I

162
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:35,466
WOULD'VE DONE BUT OKAY.

163
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,502
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T GET IS

164
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:40,571
COMPARING HOW THEY HANDLED THE

165
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,273
EMAIL INVESTIGATION TO HOW THEY

166
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:43,474
HANDLED THE TRUMP-RUSSIA

167
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:44,275
INVESTIGATION.

168
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,110
SO IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT A

169
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,511
DECISION THAT THEY MAKE TO GIVE

170
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:50,881
A GUY IMMUNITY EVEN

171
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:51,515
THOUGH THEY HAD IRONCLAD

172
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,717
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD LIED TO THE

173
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,085
FBI AND WAS INVOLVED IN THE

174
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,320
DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE, THEY

175
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,857
MAKE A CASE FOR WHY IT WAS

176
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:00,691
REASONABLE TO GIVE THE GUY

177
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:01,458
IMMUNITY.

178
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,860
IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT IN THE

179
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,561
ABSTRACT, YOU, YOU WOULD SAY

180
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,296
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE NOT WHAT I

181
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,697
WOULD'VE DONE BUT REASONABLE.

182
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,566
YOU DON'T GET TO COMPARE THAT TO

183
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,601
THE FIVE GUYS THAT MUELLER HAS

184
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,870
INVESTIGATED WHERE THE LIES THAT

185
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,472
WERE TOLD WERE NOT NEAR THE CORE

186
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,941
OF WHAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING,

187
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,709
AND YET HAVING THEM OVER THE

188
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,411
BARREL, HE PROSECUTED EVERY

189
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,446
SINGLE ONE OF THEM FOR FALSE

190
00:05:22,446 --> 00:00:00,000
STATEMENTS AND GOT THEM TO
