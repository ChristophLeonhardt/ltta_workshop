00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:05,966
GREG AND JESSE AND KIM

2
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,234
GUILFOYLE.

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,770
WE ARE LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,075
IT IS A WEEK FULL OF OUTRAGEOUS

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:20,314
AND OVER THE HILL COMMENTS FOR

6
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:23,350
ROSEANNE AND HER SHOW.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:23,651
AND

8
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:29,657
>> IF IVANKA TRUMP CHOSE TO HAVE

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:31,559
THE MOST OBLIVIOUS TWEET.

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,695
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL PHOTO OF YOU

11
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,197
AND YOUR CHILD.

12
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:38,265
ONE MOTHER TO ANOTHER.

13
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:41,502
DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR DAD'S

14
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:43,537
IMMIGRATION PRACTICE YOU

15
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:43,904
[BLEEP].

16
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:46,073
HE LISTENS TO YOU.

17
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:48,442
PUT ON SOMETHING TIGHT AND LOW

18
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,511
CUT AND TELL YOUR [BLEEP] AND

19
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:52,780
TELL HIM IT WAS AN OBAMA THING

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,350
AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,885
>> Dana: THE WHITE HOUSE SAID

22
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:00,087
THE COMMENTS WERE VILE AND

23
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,790
VICIOUS AND SHE RESPONDED SHE

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,824
CROSSED THE LINE.

25
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,659
BUT MICHAEL MOORE CALLED IT

26
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,062
A BRILLIANT RANT AND SALLY

27
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:11,232
FIELDS IS SHOWING SUPPORT WITH

28
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:14,201
A VULGAR TWEET OF HER OWN.

29
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:19,039
AND CATHY GRIFFIN GOING AFTER

30
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,908
SARAH SANDERS.

31
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,810
>> THE PRESIDENT POINTED TO THE

32
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,378
MEDIA SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS

33
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:26,514
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND NO BODY

34
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:27,348
ADDRESSES IT.

35
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:31,318
WHERE WAS THE APOLOGY FOR KATHY

36
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:33,587
GRIFFIN GOING ON A PROFANE RANT

37
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:37,091
OF THE PRESIDENT ON THE VIEW

38
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:42,963
AFTER A PHOTO OF HER HOLDING THE

39
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:43,831
PRESIDENT'S HEAD.

40
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:48,202
>> DON'T CALL FOR ME AND FOR F-

41
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:50,437
SAKE TAKE A COLD READING CLASS

42
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,573
AND MAYBE YOU WILL NOT STUMBLE

43
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:57,011
SO MUCH AND THERE IS HEAVY METAL

44
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,312
BAND, PUNK BAND.

45
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:01,815
AND THAT WAS DROPPED FROM THE

46
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:03,250
MUSIC FESTIVAL FOR JOKING ABOUT

47
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,023
THE VICTIMS OF THE LAS VEGAS

48
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:13,761
SHOOTING.

49
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:14,562
[INAUDIBLE]

50
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:18,499
>> THAT AT LEAST THEY WERE

51
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,134
COUNTRY FANS.

52
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:23,904
>> Dana: SO IT'S THURSDAY AND

53
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:25,839
TGIF TOMORROW AND QUITE A WEEK

54
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,209
FOR ALL OF THESE KINDS OF

55
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:28,676
THINGS.

56
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:30,444
GREG, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU

57
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,413
AND BRING IT BACK TO EARTH.

58
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,181
WHAT IS GOING ON?

59
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:37,585
>> Greg: IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE ON

60
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,753
AN OUTRAGE SUPER HIGHWAY AND

61
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,989
DRIVEN BY EMOTION THAT CREATES

62
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,458
MOMENTS AND PEOPLE SAY THING AND

63
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,427
IN THOSE MOMENTS IT IS AN

64
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:50,331
OPPORTUNITY FOR SCALPS, RIGHT?

65
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:53,467
AND THEN IF I DON'T LIKE YOUR

66
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:59,740
POLITICS, I WILL GET YOUR SCA L,

67
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,242
VICE VERSA AND COMPANIES FIRE

68
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:03,444
PEOPLE AND SUSPEND AND THEY SEE

69
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,212
THE PITCHFORKS AMASSING AS

70
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:05,913
A MOB.

71
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:09,650
BUT HERE IS THE THING, YOU KNOW,

72
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,919
SAMANTHA BEE APOLOGIZED AND I

73
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,521
BELIEVE YOU SHOULD ACCEPT AN

74
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,956
APOLOGY EVEN THOUGH NO ONE WILL

75
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:19,326
RETURN THE FAVOR TO ME.

76
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:22,162
>> Geraldo: I APOLOGIZE.

77
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:23,464
>> Greg: PEOPLE ARE COMING AFTER

78
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,933
YOU AND WAITING FOR YOU TO SLIP

79
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,402
UP AT ANY MOMENT AND THERE ARE

80
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,537
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PAID

81
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,206
MILLIONS THAT HAVE SPONSORS THAT

82
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:34,742
WAIT FOR US TO SCREW UP SO THEY

83
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:36,877
CAN GO AFTER YOUR ADVERTISERS

84
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,946
AND LIVELIHOOD AND CAREER.

85
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:40,447
BUT WE DON'T DO THAT.

86
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:43,284
I WOULD NOT SAY THAT TO SAMANTHA

87
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:43,617
BEE.

88
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,953
SHE APOLOGIZED AND THAT IS FINE.

89
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:47,588
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN

90
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,089
INDUSTRY OF KNIVES WAITING FOR

91
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,057
ALL OF US.

92
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:52,259
WE HAVE TO DO IT BACK TO THEM

93
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,362
AND IT WAS A MUTUALLY ASSURED

94
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:55,863
DESTRUCTION.

95
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:58,532
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

96
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:02,102
WHY DON'T YOU STOP THAT.

97
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,204
>> YOU MEAN ALL OF US.

98
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,774
PEOPLE ARE PAID TO MONITOR FOX

99
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:10,911
NEW AND WAIT FOR TO YOU SAY

100
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,780
SOMETHING.

101
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,316
>> Geraldo: MY GOODNESS, GREG,

102
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:19,119
THE C- WORDS THE EQUIVALENT OF

103
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,786
THE WORD.

104
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:22,022
IT IS DISGUSTING AND YOU ARE

105
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,590
TALKING ABOUT LOOKING FOR

106
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,359
A PERSON TO SLIP UP.

107
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,796
THIS WAS NOT A SLIP UP.

108
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,864
IT WAS A ASSAULT ON PRESIDENT

109
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:31,298
TRUMP.

110
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,534
>> Greg: YOU ARE SAYING, I AM

111
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,236
WILLING TO ACCEPT THE APOLOGY

112
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:38,505
EVEN THOUGH NO ONE WOULD ACCEPT

113
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:39,306
OURS.

114
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,075
>> Dana: I WOULD SAY THE WAY WE

115
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:43,677
ARE ALL RAISED THAT IS THE RIGHT

116
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,812
THING TO DO.

117
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:47,981
>> Geraldo: ACCEPT THE APOLOGY.

118
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,319
>> Dana: WHEN ROSEANNE BARR HER

119
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,722
TWEET AND APOLOGY AND SAID I WAS

120
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:58,192
ON AMBIEN AND TRIED TO BLAME

121
00:04:58,192 --> 00:04:58,659
THAT.

122
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,094
THIS WAS SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW

123
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:04,765
IF SAMANTHA BEE INTENDED OR

124
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:08,402
WROTE IN THE SCRIPT THE C- WORD.

125
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:10,504
>> Geraldo: IT SOUNDED LIKE IT

126
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:11,171
WAS SCRIPTED.

127
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,640
THE CROWD LOVED IT.

128
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,212
>> Dana: IS THAT WHY PEOPLE DO

129
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:19,146
THIS?

130
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:21,048
>> Geraldo: GREG SUGGESTED

131
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,717
BEFORE THE SHOW MAYBE SHE

132
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,185
PRE-MEDITATED THIS BECAUSE HER

133
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:26,253
RATINGS WERE LAGGING.

134
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:28,622
I ASKED ABOUT HER RATINGS.

135
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:31,225
TO ME, THIS IS IT A LARGER

136
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:33,627
PROBLEM, AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT

137
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:38,665
IVANKA, I THINK THAT TO ATTACK

138
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,901
IVANKA FOR HER FATHER IS UNFAIR.

139
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,603
REMEMBER YOUR TENURE IN THE

140
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,804
WHITE HOUSE, THE KIDS.

141
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:45,105
THIS IS NOT A KID.

142
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:49,176
THIS IS A FULLY MATURE WOMAN AND

143
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:49,643
ENTREPRENEUR.

144
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:53,881
>> Dana: JUST WORKING IN THE

145
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,482
WHITE HOUSE.

146
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,284
>> Geraldo: FOR NO PAY AS HER

147
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:58,185
HUSBAND IS.

148
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:00,754
THEY ARE BRILLIANT AND MOST

149
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,489
UNDERESTIMATED IN WASHINGTON AND

150
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,258
EASY MARKS FOR PEOPLE LIKE

151
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:06,360
SAMANTHA BEE TO BE SNOTTY AND

152
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,095
ATTACK AND TRY TO TEAR DOWN.

153
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:12,266
AND I THINK THAT THIS WAS AN

154
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,668
ABSOLUTELY PRE-MEDITATED AND I

155
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,337
BUY IN GREG'S POINT PARTIALLY IT

156
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,306
WAS PRE-MEDITATED BECAUSE OF THE

157
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,975
RATINGS AND LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT

158
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:22,276
ME.

159
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:25,245
AND NUMBER TWO, TO USE THIS

160
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:25,646
VICIOUS.

161
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,247
I MEAN THE C WORD.

162
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,116
IT IS LIKE ROSEANNE.

163
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:32,486
SOME PLACES YOU JUST CAN'T GO

164
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:32,886
ANYWHERE.

165
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:35,889
WE HAVE EVOLVED PAST THAT.

166
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,357
>> Dana: THERE WERE QUICK

167
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,026
DECISIVE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR

168
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,127
ROSEANNE AND IT DOESN'T LOOK

169
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,463
LIKE IT WILL BE FOR SAMANTHA

170
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:42,996
BEE.

171
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:45,432
>> Jesse: NO, THE MEDIA WILL SAY

172
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,035
SHE MOVED ON AND ON TO THE NEXT

173
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:48,368
MARK.

174
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:50,237
COULD BE GREG, WE ARE ALL

175
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:51,738
WAITING FOR IT.

176
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:53,540
>> Greg: I THINK YOU ARE

177
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,808
PROBABLY RIGHT.

178
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,844
>> Jesse: I DON'T THINK THE

179
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:59,413
CWORDS EQUIVALENT TO THE N WORD.

180
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:02,149
NOT TO SAY IT IS NOT BAD.

181
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:05,619
BUT I WOULD NOT EQUATE WHAT

182
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,222
ROSEANNE SAID TO SAMANTHA.

183
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:09,990
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SLICE OR

184
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,391
DICE IT.

185
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:14,761
BUT NOT AS UGLY AS THE N- WORD.

186
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,964
SHE'S LOOKING FOR ATTENTION AND

187
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:18,632
LIKE A CRY FOR HELP.

188
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:24,137
SHE'S NOT A TALENTED COMEDIAN

189
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:28,742
AND NOT ON THE COLBERT.

190
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:31,311
SHE IS A MANTHA BEE LIST.

191
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,914
AND SHE IS TRYING TO BE FILTHY.

192
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:36,950
AND I ASK PEOPLE AT FOX NEWS AND

193
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,919
THEY DO ALL OF THE NUMBER

194
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:39,319
CRUNCHING.

195
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,755
GIVE ME A LIST OF OTHER NASTY

196
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:42,823
STUFF SHE SAID.

197
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:46,193
I HAVE THREE PAGES OF DEROGATORY

198
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:48,495
SEXUAL SLURS SHE USED AGAINST

199
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:52,733
THE MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP FAMILY

200
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,334
AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

201
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:54,801
THEM.

202
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:58,171
>> Greg: DON'T BE A TEASE.

203
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,806
>> Jesse: IT IS ALL BAD.

204
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,975
AND SOME OF THE WORST STUFF SHE

205
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,911
RESERVED FOR THE WOMEN.

206
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:07,881
KELLY ANN CONWAY.

207
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:12,185
[BLEEP] AND F--- SARAH SANDERS.

208
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:15,289
WHETHER CHELSEA HANDLER AND

209
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,790
SAMANTHA BEE.

210
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,959
THEY SAVE THE WORST FOR THE

211
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,293
WOMEN.

212
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:22,162
WHETHER IT IS MELANIA, OR IVANKA

213
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:24,131
OR SARAH SANDERS.

214
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:28,702
THEY GO NUTS ON THESE PEOPLE.

215
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:30,237
>> THEY ARE MAD BECAUSE THEIR

216
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:31,204
GIRL DIDN'T WIN.

217
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,640
AND I FEEL LIKE THE COMEDIANS

218
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,643
WENT FROM BEING FUNNY TOANGRY.

219
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,779
AND I LIKE THE WORD SNOTTY.

220
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,280
WE ARE WATCHING ADULT MEAN GIRLS

221
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,316
ALL OF THE TIME.

222
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,419
AND I THINK COMEDIANS HAVE

223
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,722
A HARD JOB, YOU WANT TO BE FUNNY

224
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,792
BUT NOT TOO UNPOLITICALLY

225
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,094
CORRECT OR DID I OFFEND ANYBODY.

226
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:56,363
BUT COMEDY SHOULD BE FUNNY AND

227
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:59,232
THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

228
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:01,668
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS HAVING

229
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,570
A PROBLEM AND SHE IS TURNING

230
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,806
INTO A MEAN GIRL SEEING WHAT SHE

231
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:06,673
CAN SAY.

232
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,408
THIS HAD TO BE SCRIPTED AND

233
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:09,476
PEOPLE HEARD IT.

234
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:11,745
AND THIS WAS A NETWORK DECISION

235
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:13,614
TO RELEASE THIS.

236
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,215
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS IT

237
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,317
AN OFF THE CUFF.

238
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:19,052
>> Jesse: NOT A LIFE SHOW.

239
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,121
AND EVERYBODY ALL THE WAY UP TO

240
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,025
THE TOP BRASS KNEW IT.

241
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:28,795
>> THEY HAVE TO LOOK HOW THEY

242
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:29,796
HANDLE IT.

243
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:33,567
AND THEN PEOPLE JUMP AND SAID IS

244
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:36,236
THERE A IDEOLOGICAL REASON?

245
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:37,838
GET FIRED AND NOT.

246
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,841
WE LIVE IN A DAY AND AGE AND NOT

247
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,909
TOLERATE MEAN AND NASTY STUFF.

248
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,646
THAT IS NOT FUNNY MEANT TO MAKE

249
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,949
PEOPLE FEEL BAD OR BE RACIST,

250
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:51,652
YOU HAVE TO DO IT ACROSS THE

251
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:52,386
BOARD.

252
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,954
>> Jesse: I DON'T THINK SHE WILL

253
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,889
BE CANNED.

254
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:59,259
CBS IS NOT THINKING THEY WILL

255
00:09:59,259 --> 00:09:59,593
LOSE.

256
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:03,230
SHE MAY GAIN VIEWERS.

257
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,298
ROSEANNE, I THINK PEOPLE WOULD

258
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:06,299
TURN IT OFF.

259
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,403
>> I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT

260
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,604
THE APOLOGY.

261
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:13,206
THERE HAS TO BE A POLICY HERE

262
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:14,908
AND NOT ONE PERSON SAID

263
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:16,943
SOMETHING HEINOUS AND DISGUSTING

264
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:19,246
AND THEY LOSE THEIR JOB.

265
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:20,547
AND ANOTHER PERSON KEEP THEIR

266
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:23,884
JOB AND GET PROMOTED THAT

267
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:28,789
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

268
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,625
>> Greg: IT GOES BACK TO WHAT

269
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,493
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER SAID IN THE

270
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:33,860
'80s.

271
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,830
THE RIGHT THINKS YOU ARE WRONG

272
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,265
AND THE LEFT THINGS YOU ARE

273
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:38,598
EVIL.

274
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:40,867
AND THAT DEFINES THE SELECTIVE

275
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,869
OUTRAGE AND MEANING THAT SOMEONE

276
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,572
CAN GET AWAY SAYING SOMETHING

277
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:47,407
HEINOUS ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOU

278
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:49,710
ARE EVIL.

279
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,547
BULLPEN I SAY SOMETHING

280
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,048
DISGUSTING ABOUT ANY LIBERAL

281
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,417
THEY WILL GO HOW CAN YOU DO

282
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:57,751
THAT?

283
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,419
THAT IS DISGUSTING AND YOU ARE

284
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:00,721
A TERRIBLE PERSON.

285
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:02,589
IT IS THAT DIVIDE.

286
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:04,725
THEY THINK YOU ARE EVIL AND WE

287
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,994
THINK THEY ARE WRONG.

288
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:09,696
AND THAT CREATES THE CULTURE.

289
00:11:09,696 --> 00:11:11,865
>> Jerry: MAKING EXCUSES.

290
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,568
>> Greg: YOU ARE THE BAD PERSON.

291
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,737
>> Jesse: THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA

292
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:19,206
IS SO RIGHTOUS THEY ALLOW FOR

293
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,408
THINGS LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.

294
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:23,110
>> Dana: WHAT ABOUT THE SELF

295
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,178
POLICING OF YOUR OWN SIDE?

296
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,980
>> Greg: YOU MENTIONED THE BAD

297
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,515
AND NO AFFECTS.

298
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:30,517
THEY MADE A JOKE ABOUT THE

299
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,119
SHOOTING OF THESE PEOPLE AND

300
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:37,991
SAID THEY WERE COUNTRY MUSIC

301
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:38,325
FANS.

302
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,594
AND TO THAT LIBERAL FAN, COUNTRY

303
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:43,830
MUSIC FANS ARE RACIST RED NECKS

304
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,932
AND THE JOKE IS OKAY AND THEY

305
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,502
ARE BAD PEOPLE.

306
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,337
>> Geraldo: I THINK IT IS

307
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:53,707
ANOTHER POINT HAVING TO DO WITH

308
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:54,074
TIMING.

309
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:57,310
I MADE MY SHARE OF GAFFES AND

310
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,615
THE TIMING OF YOUR APOLOGY IS

311
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:02,015
CRITICAL.

312
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:05,819
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AS

313
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,888
SAMANTHA BEE AS ROSEANNE DID

314
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:11,491
HOURS AFTER YOU TALK TO YOUR PR

315
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:12,893
MORE THAN AND MANAGEMENT AND

316
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:15,929
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND SEEN THE

317
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,365
AUDIENCE REACTION, I GIVE THAT

318
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,233
LITTLE CREDIT.

319
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:23,069
AND I DON'T IN ANY WAY, IT

320
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,571
DOESN'T ABSOLVE THE SIN.

321
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,239
IF YOU DO IT IMMEDIATE.

322
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,542
AND OH, MY GOD I SCREW UP AND

323
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,811
HIT THE SEND BUTTON AND I WISH I

324
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,513
COULD GET THAT BACK.

325
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:39,052
AND IF THERE IS A SPONTANEOUS

326
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:39,786
APOLOGY WHERE IT COMES FROM THE

327
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:41,021
SOUL AND YOU ARE YOUR OWN

328
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,423
POLICEMEN AND MONITOR AND

329
00:12:43,423 --> 00:00:00,000
RESPONDING TO YOUR OWN MISDEED
