more accusations you knew they were coming we all knew they were coming a lady is accusing Kavanaugh of gang rape in the 80s or whenever she doesn't remember this has come out before this was this is the woman represented by Michael avenatti which tells you everything that you need to know about her credibility but we're now getting to meet her in person we finally get a TV interview from her she sat down with MSNBC here is just a quick clip of the accuser Julie sweat Nick giving this interview yeah it's just about as credible as I expected the the testimony to be from Julie sweating I think we have a little more from the interview though don't we will fast forward to the rest of the interview on MSNBC things that she told us on camera that differ from her written statement last week we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attending parties with Julie sweat Nick and Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found anyone who remembers that she's also unclear about when she first decided to come forward Julie sweat Nick says she was in Community College when she started attending house parties that included high schoolers you graduated in 1980 crack from high school correct from Gaithersburg public high school so you would have been out of high school so a lot of people have wondered what are you doing at a high school party if you're already wasn't a high school party these parties had everybody between about an age range of 15 16 to 25 maybe even more how did you meet Brett Kavanaugh did you actually meet him I did actually meet him I remember meeting him because I remember he's got a very distinctive face very distinctive face did you know anything about red Cavanaugh no I just I I believe he might have been wearing a Georgetown Prep uniform which a lot of the boys used to wear at least a uniform or parts of their uniform there are some differences between sweat and extreme statement last week oh gee you don't say there's some differences between your story story is changing and she's denying certain things she used to say I love her answer though because obviously this woman is I think maybe a little bit of a kook but also clearly just a liar a liar through through and we'll get through her long history of lying but she's such a bad liar so they say well you you were already out of high school you were in college Community College at the time why would you go to a party with 15 year olds I know there was everybody there 15 16 32 47 and I don't know any number any old number you want say well how do you know that you you met Rick Cavanaugh oh well you know his that face you know that face and what's great about it is he doesn't have a distinctive face he doesn't it he's God not to insult the judge he's a handsome enough man but he's got a very plain face he's like kind of the cookie cutter young Republican right he's got the hair parted to the side and he's sort of I don't know he's not in great shape but he's not too completely out of shape he's just like if you said pick just draw me a milquetoast judge you would just draw that guy he is just the archetype of that so he doesn't have a distinctive face in them well how else do you know you met him like what was he wearing oh it was wearing a I'm Brett Kavanaugh t-shirt he was wearing a yeah I remember distinctly he had this shirt that said I'm Brett Kavanaugh I went how do you know you met Michael Knowles I was wearing a daily wire t-shirt he just wore that damn daily wire t-shirt everywhere he went you know yeah reminds me in norm MacDonald's book based on a true story he says that anywhere he goes he would wear a norm show t-shirt and a SNL a Norma Connell jacket something like that you know that's the other day saying Brett Kavanaugh did so she's also just a liar and she's a demonstrated liar she has a long history of making false allegations her ex-boyfriend went on TV I won't subject you to that interview but he went on TV and said that she after they broke up she threatened to fight him go after him get violent with him litigious whatever she also has tried to sue everybody for harassment physical harassment sexual whatever so she she tried to sue American Airlines for harassment she made multiple unsubstantiated workplace misconduct claims in 94 she filed a personal injury a lawsuit against the DC Metro I should I used to get so angry because that metro takes forever especially during the summer so she filed a got some money out of it apparently then we found out that she lied in her claim about the lawsuit and then she named for people to corroborate this story that she met Brett Kavanaugh you know with that distinctive face and that I am Brett Kavanaugh t-shirt at this party and so she named for people to corroborate so the news called these four people one of them said I never heard of Julie sweat Nick I don't know who that is another one is dead and then the other two didn't respond to requests for comment so I think according to Democrats that makes her absolutely perfectly credible she must be believed the new Saint Julie sweat neck of the wacky eyes but I think for sane people we know that this woman is a liar and it brings up an important point because what we're hearing this whole time is why would any woman make up an allegation like this why would any woman lie why would any woman not know why would any woman misremember I don't know but look at her look at that wackadoodle she clearly isn't telling the truth so for perhaps a band all of the biggest rape cases the big national rape news stories in recent memory have been hoaxes Tawana Brawley Duke lacrosse the UVA so many others so okay that strategy is failing so what's the next democratic strategy the next strategy is he lied in his testimony so they're saying he perjured himself who cares if Ford has changed her story who cares if Julie sweat Nick is obviously an insane person who cares about any of those things what matters is that when brick haven't always called to testify he misspoke or he perjured himself relied or whatever he hid he actually had more beers than he said he had all right I guess so so that's this is their new strategy that he perjured himself and the news media are just lying about this they're flat-out line first of all first of all he let's not forget Brett Kavanaugh should never have been in this position they never should have allowed these hearings to happen they should have immediately voted and just simply confirmed him now these hearings have been allowed to happen it may read and two Republicans benefit though there is some some worries still but he never should have been in this position if someone you know they basically put him in out in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and said a judge Kavanagh when did you stop beating your wife I didn't beat my wife say okay stop getting so angry senator suddenly you're getting so angry sound like a guy who still probably beats his wife when did you stop I didn't stop so you're still beater no I didn't I never beat her stuff yelling senator so so this is the game that there now the question is what did it what would he have lied about so there are these text messages that came out NBC News is running with this story they said the Kavanagh lied about when he learned of Debbie Ramirezes allegations Debbie Ramirez is this girl who says that Kavanaugh whipped it out whipped out little Bret and a party freshman year in college when they were all very drunk and other people who have been asked about this say it didn't happen so I don't know who knows it again don't know if it's true don't know she's lying don't know if she's misremembering don't know if it was another guy certainly don't care either way about something that happened 35 years ago that nobody's brought up until five seconds ago when it was politically expedient but the Cavanaugh said or what NBC is alleging is that Cavanaugh said he didn't know about the accusation until he read about it in the press but bum-bum-bum these text messages have come out of Cavanaugh reaching out to other people asking them if they remember this or to refute this or to go go to bat for him and that happened before the Ramirez story made it into the papers so we got him he perjured himself he's a liar if he's lying about this he's lying about everything NBC kind of buried the lead though which is that when Cavanaugh has already testified that he heard that Debbie Ramirez the accuser was reaching out to other classmates asking her them to confirm the story that she said happened or that other people said happened and that he heard about that but he didn't know what the accusations were so then he was also reaching out and saying what happened what are you saying happened I don't know this that the other thing so he didn't perjure himself and NBC News is updated this story but they won't change the headline they won't make a retraction they want none of that because they always do the hit job first and they do that on page 1a they do that in prime time before the whole country and then they issue the retraction or that the correction or the slight change on page Z 57 at 3:00 in the morning and nobody pays any attention the great example of this is Candy Crowley during that 2012 presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama the question was whether Barack Obama called the Benghazi terrorist attack a terrorist attack the day of or if he waited to sometime and he said I did it the day of Romney said he didn't do it the day of candy crowley said he did do it he called it a terrorist attack that day governor you're wrong and then it turns out she she was completely dead wrong about that so after the entire country was watching after they all tuned out and then later on you know an hour later she said oh yeah i got that wrong whoops tee-hee-hee and then so that's what NBC is doing it with this Cavanagh thing they do it time and time again nevertheless didn't perjure himself the other one they're trying to say he perjured himself because he said that he drank less beer than he really drank okay all right maybe he drank a little extra beer by the way how much beer you drink is relative I got to tell you I've been around even just New York and LA nobody in LA drinks people don't drink a lot in New York people drink like fish by New York standards I'm a teetotaler by LA standards I'm like the caricature of Brett Kavanaugh you know I'm like speaking in cursive what seems to be the officer problem and um you know part of that is because in LA everybody's smoking the Haitian oregano but I am just trying to make the point these things you know are we really gonna sink a Supreme Court nominee over whether he had three or four beers I don't think so so that line of attack I don't think really works then they have a new one here's the new one and this one is very personal to me because it involves Brett Kavanaugh when he was in college at Yale going to a lot of bars around New Haven I've been to just about every bar around New Haven and he got into a major bar fight did you hear about that did you hear what happened I know what you think guns drawn knives pulled out shares getting broken right I've actually been in bars in New Haven at Yale affiliated events where like 20 minutes after I leave a gun goes off you know I mean New Haven is not the most pleasant town in America but no that's not what happened it's not the cabin I was there and some guy pulled a knife or a gun or pulled a snoop doggy dogg and started shooting out a car window any of that it's the Brett Kavanaugh threw an ice cube at some guy he that sick monster that predator Brett Kavanaugh was have it first of all the really crazy thing because we know Brett Kavanaugh likes beer is that he had ice and his beer I think that's the actual unforgivable thing that he did that's the best a disqualifying activity maybe that's how we know he didn't do it it's cuz nobody puts their ice and their beers but anyway the allegation is that he was at this bar and he had a drink and and he took some ice and he threw ice at a guy off with his head he's out no time for judge Barrett so that's the allegation I don't know do you let's we'll do a quick flash poll do you think that throwing ice at a guy at a college bar is disqualifying for the Supreme Court no no I'm getting him I'm hearing no from everybody okay so never mind that ones up and then so now he's still facing look he said in his testimony this has already ruined my reputation my family my life I mean it's really destroyed his career there are practical and professional consequences to this that are already happening to the judge and we will go into that in just one second but first let me save you a little money honey just in case just in

teach a course at Harvard in the spring Harvard has fired him from teaching the course I technically he wrote a letter he said my schedule will not permit it but that was only after all of these alumni and faculty members and students say it would be awful if Harvard brought a Supreme Court justice to teach at their law school they said would be terrible they couldn't do it because he's a rapist because he's a rapist don't you know I know that no one's even really accused him of rape but he's a rapist we'll get to that in a second his that is so despicable I was in an event last night and it really opened my eyes to how the left is treating this so so he lost his job at Harvard by the way if they actually succeed in working him if they actually succeed in torpedoing him they've got to kick him off the DC Circuit right they have to kick him off the DC Court of Appeals how could you have a rapist on the DC Court of Appeals if the allegation that he's some super-secret Nazi rapist I don't know what the allegations are now but I you know I assume he's a Nazi - just throw the whole book at him if the allegation is that he's a sexual predator and end up maybe a murderer according to part of Ford's testimony then how on earth could he serve on the second highest court in the land he has to lose that job we should be banished banished somewhere to the South Pacific or something the ACLU is spending 1 million dollars to oppose Brett Kavanaugh in in commercials that they're already running you might be a little confused the ACLU stands for the American Civil Liberties Union they're supposed to protect people's civil liberties but the trouble is the ACLU is a Jo ke so they're not doing that at all they've gotten even crazier than they used to be the whole point of the ACLU is to protect the individual against the mob against the lynch mob against injustice to protect their civil liberties nobody in recent American history has had their civil liberties so brazenly trampled as a judge red Cavanaugh and what are they doing they're jumping on the bandwagon and destroying them even more the the ACLU has never once opposed to judicial nominee to mine ah I don't think it's ever happened before in their history and now they're coming out they they put up this tweet with a video the tweet said quote senators pay attention a vote to confirm judge Kavanagh is a vote that tells survivors their experiences can be disregarded if they inconvenience their powerful abusers America is watching we will remember so what they're saying by the way is that Brett Kavanaugh is an abuser the ACLU has convicted him with no evidence with a lot of evidence that the accusations are bogus they've convicted him he's a sexual abuser although these women Christine for their victims they're survivors I mean Christine Ford was almost killed according to part of her testimony at some point that she made five seconds ago they've already convicted him of it and they're spending a million bucks to try to stop Cavanaugh and they produced this silly silly commercial my name is Christine Blasi Ford I am here today not because I wanted to be I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school Meera's told The New Yorker magazine Cavanaugh exposed himself to her during the dorm the other major development that third accuser now coming forward with a sworn statement of a fourth and fifth accused er after a third accuser as I said came forward earlier today the air as another woman comes forward it is not my responsibility to determine whether mr. Cavanaugh does to sit on the Supreme Court my responsibility is to tell you the truth with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted 100% so the American Civil Liberties Union has now the ACLU has become the ALM you I think it's the American lynch mob Union that's what it is they're the American lynch mob Union they're whipping people up into a lynch mob they're defending the lynch mob they're trying to make sure that the lynch mob gets their guy by the way this commercial has all the subtlety of one of those Sarah McLachlan commercials with a little puppies and studyin you know I'm sorry Andrew it's like it makes that look subtle it makes that look like it's a really sober and serious commercial how it so they asked the accuser look the accuser said that that he did it so he did it right isn't that how it works look hey the white woman said that that black guy tried to rape her so get him get him boys go get him boys the Abe we're the ACLU go get him absolutely despicable absolutely awful and such an irony I mean it is worth pointing out how we talk all the time about how political correctness just inverts reality so it's always the opposite it's always an opposite day for the left you know so social justice right is not justice oh they're always political correctness is not correctness they always do the opposite it's the same with the ACLU here they are they are doing they are destroying civil liberties in this country by joining the lynch mob against Brett Kavanaugh still I don't know if it's gonna work you know I I was at this event last night I was invited to be on a panel with a bunch of lefties and it was at the Hollywood improv and it was that you know a couple comedians that opened it up and then we had a political panel and it was funny yeah there's mostly left wingers there but there was another conservative the comedian Michael Loftus was very funny and so we're sitting on the panel and it's a few comedians and some political I was one of the political guys and then a Democrat political guy and I was struck that they they almost uniformly called Kavanagh a rapist they called him a rapist so they referred to him as a rapist they called him a rapist christine ford hasn't called him a rapist nobody others I mean this wacko that Michael avenatti dragged up that even NBC doesn't believe ooh I guess she said that he was a rapist but even actually even she says she doesn't have any evidence of that you didn't see him do anything but these lefties are calling him a rapist even though no one's even accusing them of that even if they had you there is a presumption of innocence but they're doing it and it's so ugly I mean it's so right now in Illinois at the GOP office in Illinois a bunch of vandals covered it in the word rape they just wrote the word rape all over the office is rape rape rape and it occurs to me rapists is the new racist rapist is the new racist they used this is what the left used to do when they have no argument they call you a racist they still do this when they have no argument they call your race a racist now when they have no argument they call you a rapist and it shows you a militant they've gotten how shameless they've gotten have despicable they've gotten Ann Coulter told me once when I was in college that when I left he calls you a racist you know you've won the argument now it's gotten so much uglier I mean it's all it was always it used to be that being a rape being called racist was the worst thing you could be called in America now they've turned it up to 11 and now it's rapists it's so awful because we used to always say when they would call non racist people racist we'd say you know you're really making light of bigotry you're really doing a disservice to the cause of racial tolerance and racial justice by calling people who are not bigoted bigots but now they're making such light of rape that there's they're doing a huge disservice to women who actually are raped but they don't care they don't care at all they don't care about women I mean that the real hashtag is hashtag I believe all women except when Ada Broderick and Cara Monahan and a number of others they don't they're so preening about this it's so disgusting and if I were a woman I would be furious I'd be furious that a crime that's this I suppose the second worst crime if not the worst crime rape is now just some little plaything for Democrats rapists you're a rapist what are you talking about don't you are you I said so you are because I want to win this election because Trump lowered my taxes too much and that bothers me for some reason it's so disco a woman I'd be so disgusted by that and I don't in the long run this is gonna serve Democrats you know when they called everybody and their mother a racist that led to Donald Trump that led to Donald Trump we said we're not gonna take this anymore like kicking over the tables you know you don't get to tell it you don't get to do that anymore and if they keep doing this thing with it with rapists which is so much more despicable I you're not going to get that blue wave let's put it this way and Senator Lindsey Graham senator cocaine Lindsey that's my new nickname for his cocaine Lindsey he has a great strategy if if they succeed at torpedoing the Brett Kavanaugh nomination if he's down by you I know he loses by one or two votes here is Lindsey Graham's strategy what would happen if something really weird did occur and we're one vote short here's what I would tell the president I would appeal the verdict of the Senate to the ballot box this good man should not be destroyed if you legitimize this process by one vote short will be unto the next person I'd hate to be the next person nominated I would feel horrible that we destroyed Cavanaugh so what would I do I would read on innate him and I would take this case to the American people and I'd s voters in Indiana and Missouri and North Dakota and other places for Trump one saying who he would nominate if he got to be President and see if the voters want to appeal the verdict of their senator perfectly correct exactly right and the Lindsey Graham is a shrewd politician almost anybody who makes it to the Senate with with very few exceptions is a political genius drew says all the time that the guys who make it up to that level or the all-star team I mean they are the ones who are really really good at politics and Lindsey Graham is one of the best of them and not saying he's the most conservative guy in the world that nothing is the best philosophically ideologically but politically he's a really shrewd operator and he knows that the American people want Cavanaugh confirmed they all of the poll number will go into the polls on this tomorrow but all of the poll numbers are showing this huge momentum in the direction of confirming Brett Kavanaugh and especially in those red states so this gives the Chuck Shumer Sophie's Choice this is Sophie's Choice for Chuck Schumer he's got to kill one of his babies which is ironic because this whole thing is about killing babies in the first place this whole thing is about Roe vs. Wade and people aren't really talking about it we have to remind them every now and again this whole thing is about Democrats abortion lust it is all about Roe vs. Wade but Chuck Schumer now has to kill one of his babies he can either keep fighting Cavanaugh or he can try to win the Senate but he can't do both he can't do both if he had torpedoed Cavanaugh if they had gotten Cavanaugh out then it would then it would have redounded to his benefit then I think it would've been a blue tornado but if you take a shot it when the stakes are this high if you take a shot with a supreme court pick in this political climate with this president and a pick that will shift the balance of the court that will change the dynamic the al gore search didn't change the dynamic so Democrats didn't play as hard this guy does he moves the court in a more originalist more textualist and therefore a more conservative direction if you're gonna take that shot you better not miss you better hit him you better take him out on your first shot because if it doesn't work you are going to royally infuriate all of those red state Democrats and there are a number of races up now where that could really imperil Democrats chances there we've got all of the poll numbers and it's it is look you know I take polls with a grain of salt but the movement in all of these different states in all of these different polls is pretty uniform and it's all happening because of Brett Kavanaugh we'll get to that in a second but I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube we have a lot more coming up we got to talk about snoop diggity Doo dog who allegedly shot a guy or was party to shooting a guy near my old neighborhood in LA and he is mocking and yelling at Kanye West for being an Uncle Tom because Kanye West thinks for himself we will analyze that also Republicans gave Woodrow Wilson a stroke because they don't like globalism on this day in history and an important poem for a little addendum to this day in history all of that and more but you've got to go to daily wire.com if you go there you get me you get the end reply be sure you get the Ben Shapiro show you ask questions in the mailbag and especially the conversation blah blah blah about this is what you get oh the leftist tears tumblr now I'm not I'm not offering you my current brew yet because I do want it to age and it needs to age because what we need is four we need four judge Kavanagh Associate Justice Kavanagh to be that deciding vote whenever roe v wade comes up however that case is gonna be looked at again I don't know how it's gonna be some little baby is gonna sue or something but however it comes up and then when that justice Kavanagh he remembers oh he remembers Kamala Harris he remembers Dianne Feinstein Hyrum he remembers that Roe vs. Wade is an absurd decision the worst in our nation's history and then he is going to bring justice the likes of which we have not seen in a long time and Feinstein is going to go from a full human being full of water they say our bodies are something like 90% water she's going to turn into a raisin and all of that water is gonna go right into the leftist here's tumbler you're gonna guzzle it down it's going to be so so delicious go to daily we're calm we'll be right back with a lot more delicious delicious so now the rest of you are out you're either on daily wire.com or you're listening on itunes which we appreciate by the way if you wouldn't mind please leave some five-star reviews and subscribe on iTunes and get all your friends to subscribe the main reason I need you to do this is because it really bothers been you know whenever I get a lot of good reviews on iTunes it really bothers him and this brings me great joy and I get to sort of do a little jiggle around the daily wire offices so I'd appreciate that if you wouldn't mind doing that okay we've got to get into these polls because the polls look great since this Cavanaugh thing since they've been targeting Cavanaugh for well for all of those allegations where there's no corroboration whatsoever you know the Christine Ford thing where everybody she names refutes her fantasy of what went on and the obviously Michael a vanadis kooky client to who knows what she's thinking and then he threw ice at a guy at a bar one time and then he apparently had a couple beers in college and then he who blah blah blah ever since they did all that their poll numbers have fallen right now Claire McCaskill has fallen behind Josh Hawley in Missouri a Heidi Heitkamp is way behind in North Dakota I think she's something like 10 points behind now behind her Republican opponent Mike Braun is ahead of Joe Donnelly in Indiana just a little bit and in Montana in Montana there's a dead heat Jon Tester the Democrat is only up by four points so close to her within the margin of error but it's an a dead heat right now wasn't supposed to turn out that way was it I thought it was a blue wave remember they've been saying it's a blue wave for like 25 years now John Asaf is gonna win in Georgia remember John a so if nobody remembers John so but they they are caught you know they're constantly saying here's the blue waver is the blue wave they're a little quiet now aren't they why because reasonable people don't want to see a good man destroyed over this sick nonsense and they don't want to see Democrats make a mockery of rape which is what they're doing they're making a mockery of rape it's disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves so great news on the on that front what are they going to do is Chuck Schumer or the Democrats going to keep going after Kavanagh are these red state Democrats going to keep going after Kavanagh rile up their base and lose the red states or are they going to drop the Cavanaugh stuff and try to salvage those swing states I don't know but those are the two choices and I got to tell you something I'm not sure that it's in the Democrats interest to salvage the red states I'm not sure it's in the Democrats interest to retake the Senate why not well if they if they can take the house which historically they're supposed to do but I'm not even sure that they're going to do that then they can obstruct president Trump's agenda to a reasonable degree and they can impeach President Trump which they all really want to do they've been clamoring to do there is no situation in 2018 where the Democrats are going to win in a enough Senate seats to convict President Trump if Trump is impeached he's not going to be convicted and then what happens then you're in a then you're in a Bill Clinton situation where probably impeachment actually redounds to Trump's benefit I'm giving Democrats free advice here by the way so you guys should I know that like two of them watch this show so they're probably not going to hear about this but I don't really see the benefit of them winning these red states because if they win these red states it means they're gonna have to drop all this Cavanaugh stuff and they're gonna have to alienate they're absolutely hysterical childish insane base and look I'm mocking their base but their bases their base those are the guys that they rely on so I don't know maybe they won't do that maybe they won't maybe they'll they'll say okay sorry heidi heitkamp sorry claire mccaskill sorry Donnelly sorry guys we're gonna double down on this and look it they're in a bad situation the Democrats are in a bad situation cuz they took their shot and they missed they meant they might still get him yet but it's not looking great if the longer that the at this point the longer that this drags out without any credible allegations and none of which have come up yet at this point it looks like it's going to read out to Republicans benefit probably we should have awarded this whole thing and just confirmed him and then we just be running this election on the economy and peace abroad all of which is going very very well so I think Republicans also would have had a real advantage there but where we are now maybe the Democrats just have to cut ship and abandon their guys in those red states and I don't know it's up to them they're in a tough spot I don't really care what happens because either way things are looking up for the GOP in other political news a white powdery substance was sent to Ted Cruz's campaign off so obviously people thought it was anthrax and some people went to the hospital but it turns out it wasn't anthrax I could have told them that from the beginning because that package was meant to go to Mitch McConnell's office that was not intended for Ted Cruz and I promise you it wasn't anthrax okay it's interesting I think I met Cruz office probably to keep the package you know I said no no I don't know where I went I guess we must have lost it hello no they're not gonna do that I think he's gonna beat Beto O'Rourke bet to robert Francis Beto O'Rourke Michael John McGarrett Knowles Yeah right III really don't think our work post is much of a challenge though it does the polls do say it's tight and the the cycle is so strange I guess there's a chance he pulls it out but I wouldn't put money on it I I do bring up I don't just bring up the fake anthrax letter though to make a cocaine joke about Mitch McConnell I also bring it up because it shows you the desperation of these Democrats in the the depths to which they're stooping in the Trump era especially in this election but they've been doing it for a long time let's be honest about that they've been doing it since Robert Bork at least since Ted Kennedy played did the same exact playbook against Robert Bork he hates women women will die way away away and they they shot down that nominee when they shouldn't have and then again with Clarence Thomas and they've been keep trying to do it again and they it's so disgusting but they're out for blood and they're sending fake poison to Senate GOP Senate Senators and Senate candidates and what they do is they gasp like they first they they admonish Republicans for not being polite enough they say you're not being polite enough yeah send them to poison send a mad poison that will kill all of them yeah go a go assault them at their homes go out where they sleep we know multiple Democrats they go out major Democrats and go out and attack Republicans where they and their children sleep that we now have this Georgetown professor distinguished associate professor that we talked about yesterday saying that she wants to murder and castrate white men that it would give her great joy so Georgetown University finally issued a statement about this do you know what they said they defended the professor they defended the professor for saying she wants to castrate and murder Republican white men she said but they said she'll be fair in the room she wouldn't be fair that you know she does look I've been around Georgetown there are white Republican men in Georgetown who attend there you really think she's gonna be fair in the classroom are you kidding me so they defend her and all of this brings me back to to woke Lindsey Graham to new Lindsey Graham I don't give a darn I'm going out there re nominate them that's the attitude to have because the Republican and conservative instinct is to be nice guys is to be civilized fair enough we sit where we prefer civilization we like being civilized yeah but you you can be a brutal you can you you can be no that's not the word I'm looking for you can be tough and hard and punch back really hard without being vulgar and I think that's what Republicans should do because conservatives what we want to do is say oh well I don't know well let's see if dr. Ford's testimony is legitimate mail let's see and maybe he doesn't remember it oh you can't you don't want to fly here because you have a fear of flying even though you fly to French Polynesia and Hawaii and New Hampshire and year and there and there and there okay well we'll fly out to you and they all they do this thing no no don't they so we have to push off the vote Oh Jeff Flake a George Soros operative approached me in an elevator so I can't we have to push off the vote no you don't know you don't you don't owe them a single explanation you don't these these Democrat operatives the George Soros operatives in the elevators with flake and the ACLU and Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris they are despicable and you don't owe them a single explanation just hold the vote don't you don't owe them an explanation the American people don't want you to give them an explanation to give these Democrats an explanation they're playing vicious ugly brutal politics they want to murder and castrate you sure a Georgetown professor said it Georgetown University backed her right on up Maxine Waters leading Democrat elected official says we should go to Republicans houses and keep their children up at night don't play nice with them don't play nice punch them back rhetorically not physically very very hard and hold votes and push right on through don't be nice be like woke Lindsey Graham okay and Lindsay good job buddy let's get into a Snoop Dogg before we have to go here we've got a few more we got actually a number of other things we're gonna run late I don't care we're running late today Snoop Dogg is calling Kanye West and Uncle Tom they always do this by the way the the left they call if you're a black person who doesn't know the party line they call you Uncle Tom if you're a woman who doesn't owe the party line they call you an aunt Lydia that's the that's the lady version of Uncle Tom I guess and so Snoop Dogg posts a picture on his Instagram about Kanye and he says this quote Magga music ain't getting attention I'm gonna have to edit this as I go because Snoop Dogg has a limited vocabulary and I'm not allowed to say some of the words that he uses most regularly but he says make you music great again ninja Uncle Tom I'm gonna just say ninja fella laisse fella but that's the not the word he said but fella I don't give a hoot if you like that fella you mother-lovin racist to heck you and to heck with him now what draw the line fella Kanye to buddy don't forget about him too to heck with you too I think I confused that more than I needed to I think you should go to Instagram if you want to read the original viewer discretion advised so anyway you can see Snoop Dogg a really an eloquent writer he clearly has a mastery of the English language very literate person and so Snoop Dogg you might remember him for those of you who are not familiar he is the guy who was acquitted of murder for a drive-by shooting in my old neighborhood in LA in the 1990s even though the panel was deadlocked on the charge of voluntary manslaughter because he was totally in that car with that guy with that gun who shot that other guy and so what he did this store if you don't know about this because we think of snoop Diggy do Dawg as some pothead who you know says mean things about women and posts on Instagram and his friends with Martha Stewart or something but he in the 1990s he drove by a gang member in the Palms neighborhood of LA and he was there the guy got shot after an altercation with these guys the defense said that the victim was reaching for his gun and so therefore Snoop Dickie doodads buddy pulled out his gun and shot him I don't know just trying to paint a picture of what kind of person Snoop Doggy dog is so anyway why was he so upset at mr. West he was upset because Kanye West is no longer a Democrat that's why that's the whole thing so here's what Kanye West said this is what really irked him if Kanye West said this on SNL he said quote 90% of news or liberal 90% of TV la New York writers rappers musicians so it's easy to make it seem like it's so so so one-sided the blacks weren't always Democrats you know it's like the plan they did to take the father's out of the home and put them on welfare does anybody know about that that's a Democratic plan which statement do you think is more coherent which guy do you think has a better grasp on reality the one who said I don't give a hoot if you like that ninja you mother love and racist fu him now what draw the line ninja Kanye to buddy don't you yeah that guy or the one who just actually explained the history of the relationship of black voters and Democrats but for the 20th century which one Kanye is making perfect sense I never thought I would say that but you know look we got cocaine Lindsay we got cocaine Mitch we got president PFF a we're in a brand new age aren't we and and Konya is making a lot of sense so they call him an Uncle Tom that this happens to one degree or another to a lot of people who to quote Clarence Thomas in any way deign to think for themselves and refuse to kowtow to an old order whether it be to use Thomas's words uppity blacks or women or any other group and subsection of the population that the Democrats have claimed ownership over and so you got to stay strong I mean you know as Ann told me when I was a wee college lad when the Democrats call you a racist you know you've won the argument now when the Democrats call you a rapist you know you've won the argument when they call you an Uncle Tom or an aunt Lydia or whatever other word they're going to use hold your head up high it means you're doing something this brings us to this day in history we have we got a run through these things always art oil nature is but art unknown to the in doll chance direction which that cants not see so on this day in history 1919 President Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke he suffered a stroke according to the history books and according to Wilson's widow because of Republicans because Republicans trolled him and too and triggered him so much that he actually had a stroke I don't know that this is really why he had a stroke but in any case he had just done this tour of the country to promote his League of Nations because Woodrow Wilson the imperial president decided that he was going to govern the country like a monarch like a dictator and he was going to form this super national imperial government and we were just gonna have to go along with it because he's the man he's Woodrow Wilson he's our leader so he forms the League of Nations and goes around the country to sell it and Americans just don't want it we rejected it because we're not going to let ourselves be governed by some super national body that has no allegiance to us and we no allegiance to it and all sing Kumbaya well they take away all of our liberties and sovereignty so he had this intense tour scheduled 8,000 miles 22 days he suffered all of these headaches during the during the tour he collapsed in Colorado and he did make it to Washington but he suffered a near-fatal stroke on this day in history as wife blames the Republicans in Congress and called it character assassination for attacking Woodrow Wilson we're seeing real character assassination these days what Republicans were doing in those days was not character assassination they were trying to stop the President Woodrow Wilson from giving away their sovereignty and giving away American liberty and undermining the rule of law and in the constitutional order we're seeing a lot of these same things today you know this election was in many ways just like 1919 just like the Republicans then who said no we are not giving ourselves over to global governance and giving away our liberties to ever greater organizations that have no allegiance to us and no accountability to us the same same thing today and we're seeing the effects of that by the way President Trump just renegotiated the NAFTA agreement stock markets and all of the countries shot right up include and including the United States Dow gained 250 points when it was announced the brexit happened and what are they said that the British economy was going to implode Europe was going to fall apart both countries are doing just fine the economy and in Britain rebounded just fine they tell us this again and again and again and yet again and again and again we find that the the order of independent nation states is the greatest governing system for our time for our air as the best one that we've come up with so Woodrow Wilson suffered this stroke on this day in history but an our day in history we we see that very idea that Woodrow Wilson was championing is seems to have been dealt a pretty tough blow it's gonna come back up because bad ideas always come back up but for now we're seeing how great it is when you can strike a tough blow to a bad idea also on this day in history I should point out just before we leave Wallace Stevens was born a great modernist poet he's born in 1879 the reason I bring him up is I I just really like this guy as a character he is a modernist for much of his life maybe all of his life he was sort of secular it's not like I agreed with him on everything or even very much there is a story though that he had a deathbed conversion to Catholicism some people refute this but there is a letter about this so I don't know we'll see maybe maybe maybe some day in heaven will see Wallace Stevens walking around but the reason I like him is because he he was an artist but he worked all of his life as an insurance executive so he is this wonderful poet one of the great poets of his age if not the greatest poet of his age certainly up there top three top four and but he was an insurance executive he actually worked a job and whenever people ask you know how to get around Hollywood how do you do this how do you work in political media or show business or that or that I always say you've got to work you've just got to work you need to have a job and just don't don't be like the classical version of an actor or a writer or a producer whatever and just wait for the phone to ring you can't do that and he didn't do that he worked because man has made the work even in the Garden of Eden man was made to work so I there's this great poem that he it's one that in high school you used to have to memorize I memorized when I was in high school and I don't know that you have to anymore I don't know that high schools even have you memorized poems anymore but it's called the Emperor of ice-cream it ties in a little bit with what we were talking about yesterday about living forever and the keys to a happy life and what our life is like when we come to its end it's called the emperor of ice-cream call the roller of big cigars the muscular one and bid him whip in kitchen cups concupiscent curds let the wenches dawdle in such dress as they are used to wear and let the boys bring flowers in last month's newspapers let B be finale of seem the only Emperor is the Emperor of ice-cream take from the dresser of a deal lacking the three glass knobs that sheet on which she embroidered fan tales once and spread it so as to cover her face if her horny feet protrude they come to show how cold she is and dumb let the lamp afix its beam the only Emperor is the Emperor of ice-cream I won't even say anything about it I'll just let that sink in I'll be back tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the
