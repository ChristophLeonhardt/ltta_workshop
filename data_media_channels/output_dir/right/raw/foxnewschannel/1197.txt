1
00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:01,970
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, ONE WILLIAM

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,572
WILLIAMS, DANA PERINO, AND

3
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:04,406
GREG GUTFELD.

4
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:05,774
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

5
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:09,778
THIS IS "THE FIVE" ."

6
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:11,646
IT'S A BIG DAY AT THE

7
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,581
WHITE HOUSE.

8
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:13,482
PRESIDENT TRUMP MARKS 500 DAYS

9
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:15,183
IN OFFICE BY TURNING HIS

10
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,318
COMPLIMENTS.

11
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:17,586
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING.

12
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:18,987
THE NORTH KOREA SUMMIT IS BACK

13
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:19,855
ON AND THE PRESIDENT HAS REBUILT

14
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,990
THE MILITARY.

15
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,592
BUT THE DARK CLOUD OF THE

16
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:24,393
SPECIAL COUNSEL RUSSIA PROBE

17
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:26,995
CONTINUES TO HANG OVER HIS HEAD.

18
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:29,064
THIS WEEKEND, SOMEONE LEAKED A

19
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:30,766
20 PAGE LETTER THE PRESIDENT'S

20
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:32,500
LEGAL TEAM WROTE BACK IN JANUARY

21
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,369
TO MUELLER'S LAWYERS.

22
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,638
IT ARGUES THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

23
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:37,639
CANNOT POSSIBLY COMMIT

24
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:38,974
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND THAT

25
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:39,908
HE HAS A BROAD AUTHORITY TO

26
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:42,611
PARDON HIMSELF.

27
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,246
THIS MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED HE

28
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,714
HAS THE RIGHT TO PARDON HIMSELF

29
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:47,682
BUT WOULDN'T BECAUSE HE'S DONE

30
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:48,617
NOTHING WRONG.

31
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:50,986
THIS COMES AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S

32
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:52,387
LAWYER RUDY GIULIANI SAID IN

33
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,522
INTERVIEWS THE PRESIDENT MIGHT

34
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:55,323
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PARDON

35
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:55,657
HIMSELF.

36
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,126
>> DO YOU AND THE PRESIDENTS

37
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,861
ATTORNEYS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT

38
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,164
HAS THE POWER TO PARDON HIMSELF.

39
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,032
>> HE'S NOT BUT HE PROBABLY

40
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:04,599
DOES.

41
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,367
HE HAS NO INTENTION OF PARDONING

42
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:11,406
HIMSELF BUT HE PROBABLY DOES.

43
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:11,973
IT'S AN INTERESTING

44
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,241
CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT.

45
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,876
CAN THE PRESIDENT PARDON

46
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:15,243
HIMSELF?

47
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,978
>> Jesse: THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO

48
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:17,813
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.

49
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,581
>> THE PRESIDENTS HAD HAVE AN

50
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,184
ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARDON MYSELF.

51
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:23,885
WHY DOES HE THINK THAT.

52
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:27,589
DOES HE AGREE WITH RUDY GIULIANI

53
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,291
THAT A PARDON FOR HIMSELF WOULD

54
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,160
BE UNTHINKABLE AND LEAD TO

55
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,361
IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT?

56
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,963
>> THANKFULLY THE PRESIDENT

57
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:36,465
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG AND

58
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:37,999
WOULDN'T NEED A PARDON.

59
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,801
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE HE

60
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,403
IS ABOVE THE LAW?

61
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,505
>> CERTAINLY NOT.

62
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:44,806
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE

63
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:45,273
ANYTHING WRONG.

64
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,176
>> Jesse: 500 DAYS, GREG.

65
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,744
FAIR ASSESSMENT, WHETHER YOU

66
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:52,114
AGREE WITH THE POLICIES ARE NOT.

67
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:55,317
HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A BIT.

68
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,785
>> Greg: I LIKE TO THINK OF IT

69
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,554
AS THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS

70
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:00,388
FIRST 100 DAYS.

71
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,190
A LOT OF STUFF HAS HAPPENED.

72
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,526
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

73
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:04,926
WHITE HOUSE.

74
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,461
I AM TALKING ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

75
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,865
THE KEY IS, LIFE WENT ON FOR

76
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:14,369
EVERYBODY FOR THIS 500 DAYS.

77
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:16,738
IF A TRUMP CRITIC HAS TO ADMIT

78
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,607
YOUR LIFE EITHER STAYED THE SAME

79
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,208
OR IT GOT MARGINALLY TO

80
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:20,976
DRAMATICALLY BETTER.

81
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,011
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE OPTIONS

82
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,179
HERE.

83
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,780
BUT IT DIDN'T IMPLODE.

84
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,883
ACCORDING TO THE PREDICTIONS, BY

85
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:29,284
NOW WOULD HAVE HAD A CIVIL WAR.

86
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,586
WE WOULD HAVE HAD A NUCLEAR WAR.

87
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:34,389
WE WOULD HAVE HAD A DEPRESSION,

88
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,223
PERHAPS ASTEROIDS WOULD HAVE

89
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:35,524
HATE.

90
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:40,996
WE HAVE HAD PEACEFUL PROSPERITY.

91
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,197
A PEOPLE STEP OUTSIDE THEIR

92
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:43,865
EMOTIONAL BUBBLE, THEY WILL SEE

93
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:45,400
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD AGE TO BE IN

94
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,801
RIGHT NOW.

95
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,904
AND YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM YOU

96
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,639
HAVE IS A PRESIDENT THAT DRIVES

97
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,275
YOU CRAZY BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE

98
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,976
HIS PERSONALITY.

99
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:57,612
YOU HAVE PROSPERITY, LOW

100
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,015
UNEMPLOYMENT, A STRONG ECONOMY,

101
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,584
NO ISIS, PERHAPS NORTH KOREA

102
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:05,287
ACTUALLY BECOMING PART OF THE

103
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:05,587
WORLD.

104
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:09,391
IMAGINE IF IT WAS BAD NEWS.

105
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:10,792
IMAGINE HOW THE MEDIA -- THE

106
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,561
MEDIA IS IN A CONSTANT MELTDOWN

107
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,229
WITH GOOD NEWS.

108
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,364
IMAGINE IF THINGS WERE ACTUALLY

109
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:20,535
BAD.

110
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,804
TO INSTITUTIONALIZE ALL OF THEM.

111
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:25,106
>> Jesse: JUAN, ARE YOU SICK

112
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:26,908
OF ALL THE WINNING?

113
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,009
>> Juan: YOU ARE KILLING ME.

114
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,412
HE IS SO POPULAR.

115
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,613
STUNNINGLY POPULAR.

116
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:32,981
HE'S NOT POPULAR WITH THE

117
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,817
GENERAL POPULACE, BUT HE'S VERY

118
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,319
POPULAR WITH REPUBLICANS.

119
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,587
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING

120
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:39,988
HIM AFLOAT.

121
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,324
GREG SAYS EVERYTHING IS JUST

122
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,024
GREAT, SO MUCH ACCOMPLISHED.

123
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,459
BUT I THINK THIS IS OUR

124
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,393
PRESIDENT WHO WORRIES PEOPLE.

125
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,528
I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE

126
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:49,664
CONCERNED ABOUT HIM, AND IF YOU

127
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,865
LOOK AT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT, HIS

128
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:52,500
NUMBER ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT I SAW

129
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,070
IN THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASE WAS

130
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,404
OF COURSE REPUBLICANS DON'T EVEN

131
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,906
THINK THEY CAN RUN ON TAX CUTS

132
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,407
IN THE FALL BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

133
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,109
PROVEN TO BE THAT POPULAR.

134
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,814
THE SECOND ONE IS PUTTING A

135
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,482
CONSERVATIVE, NEIL GORSUCH COME

136
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:08,717
ON THE SUPREME COURT.

137
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,385
YOU WON THAT ONE.

138
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:11,820
I WOULD GIVE THE CREDIT TO

139
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,189
MITCH MCCONNELL WHO SAVED THAT

140
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,991
SEAT FROM MERRICK GARLAND.

141
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,692
EVEN ON THEIR TAX CUT, THE

142
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,862
DEFICIT CONTINUES TO RISE

143
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,264
INCREDIBLY.

144
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,999
NO PROGRESS ON INFRASTRUCTURE

145
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:24,633
WHICH WAS A KEY PROMISE.

146
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,301
I COULD GO ON.

147
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:28,603
BUT I THINK IF YOU WANT, IT

148
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,172
FEELS TO ME LIKE YOU SAY 500

149
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,407
DAYS.

150
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:36,911
FEELS TO ME LIKE WOW, 500 YEARS.

151
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,980
>> Dana: AND JUAN HAD A WEEK

152
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,247
OFF.

153
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,249
>> Kimberly: SO EXHAUSTED FROM

154
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:42,784
WINNING.

155
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,420
>> Juan: THE     THE THING THATG

156
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,453
>> Juan: THE     THE THING THATT

157
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:45,687
>> Juan: THE     THE THING THATS

158
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:47,389
ME IS THE IMMIGRATION STUFF.

159
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,025
>> Jesse: WE WILL GET TO THAT.

160
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,192
KIMBERLY, THE PARDON SITUATION.

161
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,661
LEGALLY THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN SOME

162
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:53,628
GAMESMANSHIP.

163
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,797
LOOKS LIKE HE GOT SET UP,

164
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:56,564
RUDY GIULIANI, ON THE QUESTION I

165
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,499
DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

166
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,901
HOW DO YOU SEE THE PARDON THING

167
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:00,435
PLAYING OUT?

168
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,870
>> Kimberly: YOU LOOK AT THE

169
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,607
NUANCE THERE.

170
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,274
IT POSES AN INTERESTING

171
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:08,109
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.

172
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,178
CAN THAT PRESIDENT PARDON

173
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:10,512
HIMSELF?

174
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,180
THEN HE FOLLOWED UP WITH A TWEET

175
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,281
SAYING HE CAN.

176
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,417
MAYBE HE SPOKE TO SOMEONE AT

177
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,618
SAID YOU'RE SAFE TO GO AHEAD AND

178
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:17,018
TWEET THAT.

179
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,486
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TO

180
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,188
THAT POINT, RIGHT, YOU DON'T

181
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,123
WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WOULD BE

182
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:22,490
NECESSARY.

183
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,993
YOU WOULD SAY OKAY, I HAVE DONE

184
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,561
NOTHING WRONG SO I DON'T EVEN

185
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,430
HAVE TO GET TO THE QUESTION OF

186
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,198
WHETHER OR NOT I CAN PARDON

187
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:30,532
MYSELF.

188
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:31,599
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NOTHING ON

189
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,301
THE MERITS TO SUGGEST ANY KIND

190
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,102
OF CRIMINALITY ON MY PART.

191
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:36,171
THAT'S THE MESSAGING I WOULD

192
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:39,207
STICK WITH.

193
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:39,974
THAT IS WHAT HE BELIEVES THAT HE

194
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:42,811
KNOWS THE FACTS AND WHAT

195
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,079
TRANSPIRED BETTER THAN ANYBODY

196
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,217
IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS GONE ON AND

197
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:51,553
THAT'S PROBABLY THE WAY TO STICK

198
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:52,387
WITH IT.

199
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:53,621
YOU SAW THE PRESS CORPS WAS

200
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,489
SAYING DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK

201
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:59,427
HE'S ABOVE THE LAW?

202
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,795
YOU WANT TO SWITCH THE

203
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,197
DISCUSSION, GIVE THEM THE POINTS

204
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,366
TO TALK ABOUT AND DRIVE THE

205
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:06,401
MESSAGING, TALK ABOUT THE

206
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,737
ECONOMY, TRUMP'S GOLDEN AGE OF

207
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:10,105
THE ECONOMY IN TERMS OF JOB

208
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:14,209
NUMBERS AND THINGS AT THAT.

209
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:18,446
>> Jesse: TO BRING UP THE P

210
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:20,715
WORD ON PROMPTED.

211
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,349
>> Dana: YOU MEAN PARDON.

212
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:23,985
>> Jesse: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT,

213
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:24,352
OBVIOUSLY.

214
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:27,222
A DAY WHEN EVERYONE WAS TALKING

215
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,125
ABOUT BILL CLINTON AND THE

216
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:30,992
LEWINSKY THING.

217
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:31,693
HE DROVE THAT OUT OF THE NEWS

218
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:36,598
CYCLE AND NOW EVERYONE IS

219
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:37,599
TALKING ABOUT PARDONS.

220
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:38,199
>> Dana: THE WHITE HOUSE

221
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,334
BRINGS THIS ON THEMSELVES LITTLE

222
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:39,801
BIT.

223
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,668
THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETS ARE

224
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,604
DRIVING THE NEW CYCLE.

225
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,105
WHEN HE'S TWEETING ABOUT IT, YOU

226
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,173
CAN BET PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TALK

227
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:45,807
ABOUT IT.

228
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,509
IF YOU ONLY WANT PEOPLE TO TALK

229
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,843
ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS, TWEET

230
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,845
ONLY ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS.

231
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:51,780
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

232
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,215
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT

233
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,817
YOU HAVE THIS REPUBLICAN

234
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:56,818
CONGRESS FOR TWO YEARS.

235
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:57,619
FIVE MONTHS FROM TOMORROW IS THE

236
00:06:57,619 --> 00:06:58,052
MIDTERM.

237
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:01,790
RIGHT AFTER THAT IMMEDIATELY YOU

238
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,590
START THE 2020 ELECTION.

239
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,226
I THINK WHAT IS SO INTERESTING

240
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:05,760
IS THAT DEMOCRATS --

241
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,929
>> Kimberly: HERE WE GO AGAIN.

242
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,197
>> Dana: DEMOCRATS ARE SO

243
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:11,032
BEFUDDLED AT THIS POINT.

244
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:11,499
WHAT DO YOU DO?

245
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,968
ALL THESE GOOD NEWS THINGS, IF

246
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,403
ALL OF THESE GOOD NEWS POINT

247
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:16,304
THAT HAPPENED DURING THE OBAMA

248
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,406
ADMINISTRATION, THEY WOULD'VE

249
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,340
TOUTED THEM.

250
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,108
COULD BE THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

251
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,211
GOING TO HAVE TO USE THIS TIME

252
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:25,513
TO STEP BACK AND SAID.

253
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,582
POLITICS IS TIMING.

254
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:28,450
REGROUP.

255
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,288
FILL OUT THE RANKS IT WAS

256
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:34,589
DEPLETED.

257
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,623
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TRY TO GET

258
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,593
THROUGH THEM IN TERMS OF IF THEY

259
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:39,494
COULD FLIP THE HOUSE, WE WILL

260
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:39,761
SEE.

261
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:43,898
I THINK IT'S, I GUESS IT'S 50/50

262
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,233
AT THIS POINT.

263
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,234
REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING

264
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,102
DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT 500 DAYS

265
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:51,005
NOT FIGURING OUT HOW THEY LOST

266
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,674
IN 2016 WHICH MEANS THEY ARE

267
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:53,775
BEHIND IN FIGURING THAT OUT

268
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,844
BECAUSE 2020 IS GOING TO BE HERE

269
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:57,245
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

270
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,414
AND I DON'T SEE HOW THE ROARING

271
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:00,048
ECONOMY CHANGES.

272
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:03,017
I DON'T SEE HOW THE FOREIGN

273
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,419
POLICY POSITION CHANGES.

274
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:05,420
UNLESS THERE IS SOME

275
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,221
CATASTROPHIC EVENT WHICH

276
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,489
HOPEFULLY THERE IS NOT BUT WE

277
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:08,756
ARE BETTER POSITIONED TO DEAL

278
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:09,457
WITH.

279
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,626
IN THE MEANTIME, PARTIES CHANGE.

280
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:13,595
THEY EVOLVE.

281
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:14,195
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT'S

282
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,597
HAPPENING WITH THE REPUBLICAN

283
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:16,331
PARTY BUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

284
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,132
HAS DONE THAT.

285
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,535
THAT IS PRETTY MUCH OVER, AND SO

286
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:21,302
THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES NOW

287
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,838
THAT ARE IN A POSITION OF

288
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,406
FIGURING OUT, WHO ARE WE AND

289
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:29,043
WHAT ARE GOING TO BE?

290
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:29,911
>> Jesse: THEY MIGHT HAVE TO

291
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:30,812
REINVENT THEMSELVES.

292
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:31,813
>> Greg: LET'S HOPE SO.

293
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,248
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

294
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:35,783
IN THAT THEY ARE OUT OF POWER.

295
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,818
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO GET

296
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:38,620
BACK INTO POWER.

297
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,022
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

298
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:41,289
DO.

299
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,758
THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, CARTER WAS

300
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:44,425
A REACTION TO NIXON.

301
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:47,562
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTIO

302
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:47,595
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTI

303
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:47,629
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTIO

304
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:47,662
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTIC

305
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:47,695
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTIR

306
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:47,729
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTIE

307
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,331
REAGAN WANTS       WAS A REACTI.

308
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,199
EVERYONE IS A REACTION TO

309
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,900
SOMEBODY ELSE.

310
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,701
THEY SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS

311
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,135
IN A TANTRUM.

312
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:55,837
THEY HAVE BLOWN ALL OF THIS

313
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:56,237
TIME.

314
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,672
I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY HAVE

315
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:02,243
FOUND ANYONE.

316
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,344
>> Jesse: WHAT WOULD BE THE

317
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,445
REACTION TO DONALD TRUMP.

318
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:06,214
COULD YOU IMAGINE THE OPPOSITE

319
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:07,882
OF DONALD TRUMP?

320
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:08,416
>> Greg: GOOD POINT.

321
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:13,988
I AM SAYING IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY

322
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:14,822
INCREDIBLY LEFT-WING.

323
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,925
YOU ALWAYS SEE THE PENDULUM

324
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,060
SHIFT.

325
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,830
THEY MIGHT TRY -- HE IS UNDOING

326
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,498
EVERYTHING OBAMA DID.

327
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,867
THE NEXT ONE IS GOING TO TRY TO

328
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,502
UNDO EVERYTHING TRUMP DID.

329
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,203
>> Jesse: THE OPPOSITE OF

330
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,206
TRUMP IS PROBABLY A FEMALE,

331
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,809
HISPANIC, VERY POLITE LIBRARIAN.

332
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:35,410
>> Juan: NO, NO.

333
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,845
THE THING IS.

334
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,014
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

335
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,015
THE PENDULUM SWINGS.

336
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,283
BUT IF A DEMOCRAT WAS DOING WHAT

337
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,620
TRUMP IS DOING, LET'S SAY THIS

338
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,021
WEEKEND, PUT THIS BUSINESS ABOUT

339
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,790
HE CAN PARDON HIMSELF, CAME OUT

340
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,959
THAT IN THAT LETTER IT WAS

341
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,527
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD

342
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:56,097
DICTATED THIS LETTER ABOUT DON

343
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,800
TRUMP, JR.'S MEETING AT

344
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,500
TRUMP TOWER WITH THIS RUSSIAN

345
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,034
LAWYER.

346
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,003
WE HAD HEARD FROM TRUMP

347
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:05,006
OFFICIALS THAT WASN'T TRUE,

348
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:05,773
REPEATEDLY, FROM SARAH HUCKABEE

349
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,041
SANDERS, JAY SEKULOW, AND

350
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:07,375
OTHERS.

351
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,043
NOW IT COMES OUT WE WERE LIED TO

352
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,445
AND I THINK IF OBAMA DID

353
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,312
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, JESSE, I

354
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:14,616
THINK YOU WOULD BE STANDING ON

355
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:15,617
THIS TABLE, BROTHER.

356
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,785
HE WOULD BE SCREAMING ABOUT

357
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:18,386
OBAMA.

358
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:19,921
>> Greg: THAT LIGHT ISN'T EVEN

359
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,690
CLOSE TO BENGHAZI.

360
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,695
BLAME IT ON A MOVIE.

361
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,597
>> Jesse: HE LIED ABOUT A

362
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:31,833
LETTER, NOT DEAD AMBASSADORS.

363
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,800
>> Juan: WE HAVE A SITUATION

364
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,737
WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS

365
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,404
CONSOLIDATED AROUND TRUMP.

366
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:37,505
HE HAS MADE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

367
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,207
INTO THE TRUMP PARTY.

368
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:42,176
THAT IS WHAT HAS CHANGED IN 500

369
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,344
DAYS.

370
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:45,046
>> Greg: THE DEMOCRAT PARTY

371
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:45,647
BECAME THE OBAMA PARTY.

372
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:46,814
>> Juan: I DON'T THINK THAT'S

373
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:47,448
