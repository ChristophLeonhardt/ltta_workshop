they're brothers before anything else so you know if we need to resolve to solving things the old-fashioned way with our hands we will you know we're brothers that's the normal thing that's why I'm bigger we got some great advice early on saying just have an operating agreement so Ian and I have an operating an agreement in the event of a disagreement or anything where that's all planned out if for some reason we can't come to some sort of resolve in the conflict this is how it will be resolved I don't think we've ever looked at that agreement since we know it's there as a business starting to become more and more successful the landscape of our family changed our parents both had cancer they both passed away we've both got married and have our own families and children and so learning the values that that those life experiences teach you keep the business in check you know I think it comes with you know age comes wisdom we are a team and that takes some relationship managing as well we really believe passionately in what we're doing but at the end of the day we both want the business to be successful to sustain and to prosper and we want the best for each other in any sort of relationship there has to be compromise we've been tested but at the end of the day we get through it
