there is a there is a advice column there's an advice column in the New York Times I know why would you read it well you want their advice for but apparently some people do so says somebody writes a letter and he says that his name is whitey now this should have been the New York Times his first clue that maybe they were getting trolled it was not because we have now reached the point in American politics we are now violating what is called Poe's law Poe's law is an internet law that basically says that if you are not extraordinarily clear about when you are being facetious on the internet everyone will take you literally that's exactly what happened in this case here is the advice letter dear sugars yes that's the name of the the advice columnist I'm riddled with shame white shame this isn't helpful to me or to anyone especially people of color I feel like there is no me outside of my white upper-middle class cisgender identity I feel like my literal existence hurts people like I'm always taking up space that should belong to someone else a human being wrote this I consider myself an ally I research proper etiquette read writers of color vote in a way that will not harm people of color and other vulnerable people I engage in conversations about privilege with other white people boy person is a real party I take courses that will further educate me I donate it to black lives matter yet I fear that nothing is enough part of my fear comes from the fact that privilege is invisible to itself what if I'm doing or saying insensitive things without realizing it and then it continues it continues there's more I don't talk about my feelings because it's hard to justify doing so while people of color are dying due to systemic racism and making this conversation about me would be again centering whiteness yet bottling it up makes me feel an existential anger did I have a hard time channeling since I don't know my place instead of harnessing my privilege for greater good I'm curled up in a ball of shame how can I be more than my heritage this was signed whitey but here's the best part okay that's not even the good part the good part is the response from Steve Almond one of the sugars shame and anger our powerful emotions whitey yeah let's give these people power over our government and yet your central struggle is around identity you write that you don't know your place in fact your letter describes your place as a kind of prison cell of privilege what you really feel is trapped within an identity that marks you inescapably as an oppressor this feeling is especially acute right now I suspect because you're suddenly immersed in a milieu there are flecks are privileged back to you we do live in a culture steeped in white supremacy and class bigotry as well as patriarchal values this is the New York Times writing okay so the answer is go kill yourself basically hey their final solution is that they say that this person should give more money to black lives matter of course and then buy an extra subscription to The New York Times and then read a lot of tiny PC codes and that kind of thing and then you then that's how you get over your white privilege and that's how you feel better about yourself is by reading a bunch of people who tell you that you're a piece of crap but you shouldn't really have no place in the world that is the best way to do this why oh why when people resonate to Donald Trump I can't understand it it's just a puzzlement
