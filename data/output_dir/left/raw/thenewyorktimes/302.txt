1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,979
For this Olympics, we
have 21 total suitcases.

2
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:08,520
They’re all the size
of Ford Focuses.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,780
Small trucks.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,336
Small trucks.

5
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:12,960
Because we want to
make sure that we’re

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,890
prepared for anything.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,880
I mean, what if we get
sent to the mountains?

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,400
We’ve got to have
a boot for that.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,380
What if we’re doing a solid
interview with the president

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,100
of somewhere?

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,770
We have to have a
brooch for that.

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,880
I feel like, when you’re
competing at the Olympics,

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,600
the costume that you wear has
to portray not only the music

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,450
and the story of
your choreography

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,445
but also who you are as a
person, what you’re all about,

16
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:40,570
what you feel beautiful in.

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,990
And of course, it has to
stretch and move with you.

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,602
I loved getting
into the character

19
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:45,810
of whatever I was skating to.

20
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,180
So I skated attached to
Anastasia, for example,

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,500
for my Olympic short program.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,590
And I tried to copy her dress
as much as I could, just so you

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,114
feel like, when you
step on the ice,

24
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,280
this is a representation
of your entire performance.

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,418
[music]

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,220
Probably at 13 or
14, I really didn’t

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,040
know what my style would be.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
It was mainly whatever
I wanted to wear.

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,660
When I was a teenager, my
style was very pop princess.

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,640
I was very into the Christina
Aguileras and 'N Syncs

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,390
of the world.

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,340
My style was definitely
a work in progress.

33
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,840
Yeah.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,469
Mine was too.

35
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,260
I feel like I’m thinking
back to — remember

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,252
when Uggs with, like,
the jean skirt was in?

37
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,710
Were you still a
teenager for that?

38
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,840
Yeah.

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,350
I was.

40
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,250
That wasn't our time.

41
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,750
Yeah.

42
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,620
You’ve got to know
your face and your body

43
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,820
and your style and your vibe.

44
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,200
And I rocked those bangs.

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,160
And I was full.

46
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,740
And my mom cut them with
the Conair curling iron.

47
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,350
Remember where
you used to just —

48
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,933
Those were around
the world bangs.

49
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,000
Yep.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,420
I feel like I credit my parents
to keeping me very grounded

51
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,420
and down to earth
and never feeling

52
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,505
like I should be
anything but who I was.

53
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:08,419
I grew up lower middle class
in the middle of nowhere

54
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,830
in Pennsylvania.

55
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,240
And my parents were both very
different from their families.

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,640
And they always talked
about the importance

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,290
of being who you are,
and if you are different,

58
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,670
celebrating that and being
as special as you can be,

59
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,290
because coming from a town like
I did, everyone’s the same.

60
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,240
It’s 99.9% white Christians
who may or may not

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,390
have had a close run in with a
cow at one point in their life.

62
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,250
And that’s where I come from.

63
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,260
So my mom was like,
Johnny, go be special.

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,370
Go do you.

65
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,590
So when I’m choosing the things
I wear or the things I say,

66
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,390
it all really does
come from the heart,

67
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,750
because that’s all I know.

68
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,250
I don’t know how
to create an image.

69
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,820
I don’t know how
to be premeditated.

70
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,650
And I don’t know
how or understand

71
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,750
why anybody would
want to lie just

72
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,240
for the sake of people thinking
better or worse of them.

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,430
I’m going to be who I am
from the time I wake up

74
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,500
to the time I go
to bed until I die.

75
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,499
And there’s nothing that’s
going to change that.

76
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,520
We like to provide our
viewers with an atmosphere.

77
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,330
It isn’t just, these are
the people that are talking,

78
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,080
and these are the
people that are skating.

79
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,413
Why not start off a show and
get people ready for what

80
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,560
they’re going to see?

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
We are Olympians.

82
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,920
So every Olympic cycle,
we start training as soon

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
as the Olympics are over.

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,850
So as soon as we get
the go-ahead and the O.K.

85
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,750
that we’re going
to work in Beijing,

86
00:03:27,750 --> 00:00:00,000
we’re going to be preparing.
