1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
“What is unfathomable is Jamie
took a bullet and is dead.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,890
I don’t know what I do next.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,180
My wife is home.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,250
We are broken.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,450
But I can tell
you: Don’t tell me,

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,930
there’s no such thing
as gun violence.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,050
It happened in
Parkland.”

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,400
“No more guns.”

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,840
“No more guns.”

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,689
“No more guns.”

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,976
“No more guns.”

12
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:35,443
“No more guns.”

13
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:38,560
“As your sheriff,

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,110
I will implement the full
powers of the office,

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,730
the Broward Sheriff’s office.

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,440
My friends who came with 
me here tonight, elected officials.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,820
And they have no choice, but

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,340
we will introduce
common-sense gun

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,150
laws that make our
streets safer.”

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,540
“We must
hold other people’s

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,850
elected officials accountable.

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,480
We must make sure
that they hear us.”

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,800
“This is our home.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,030
And this is where we will
not be intimidated by evil.

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,430
We have amazing students,
awesome administrators

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,900
and incredible teachers.

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,740
Everyone at Stoneman Douglas carries 
a special place in my heart.

28
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,420
I feel weak thinking about
my beloved high school

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,980
and this tragedy occurring.”

30
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,550
“This makes no sense.

31
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,410
This is impossible.

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,730
My girl, my 14-year-old baby.

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,640
And for those of you
who know my Jamie,

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,170
she was the life of the party.

35
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,600
She was the energy in the room.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,850
She made people laugh.

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,860
And yes, sometimes
she made us cry,

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:00:00,000
but she was always known. She
always made her presence felt.”
