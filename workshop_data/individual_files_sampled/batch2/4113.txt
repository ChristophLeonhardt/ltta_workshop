a letter was given to me by Kim jong-un's and that letter was very nice letter Oh would you like to see what was in that letter how much how much it was a very interesting letter and at some point I may be it may be appropriate and maybe I'll be able to give it to your baby good morning and welcome to am joy well the on-again off-again June 12 summit between Donald Trump and North Korean dictator kim jungeun is back on and all it took was a big fancy letter with which Trump praised effusive ly without bothering to read it I purposely didn't open eleven haven't opened it I didn't open it in front of the director I said would you want me to open it he said you can read it later I may be in for a big surprise folks well the White House says that Trump has now read that letter and while Trump was talking up his burgeoning relationship with North Korea and praising Chinese leader Xi Jingping for his help the United States imposed massive trade tariffs on imports from Europe Mexico and Canada our largest trading partners and close allies prompting outrage and threats of retaliation from our closest allies oh and according to The Wall Street Journal Trump is planning another summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin so just as a thought experiment what would happen if the world's sole economic and military superpower will to alienate Europe and Canada and Mexico and Ally itself instead with China Russia and North Korea joining me now is David corn of Mother Jones Malcom Nance MSNBC contributor and executive director of the terror asymmetric project Sara Kenzie our journalist and scholar of authoritarian states and Christine on founder of women a croc women cross dmz and co-founder of the korea policy institute thank you all for being here i want to go around the table and just sort of get you guys a take on that question david on the question of whether or not we're seeing a de facto realignment where the world you know used to the United States sort of being a leader if not the bleep de facto leader of the West now Donald Trump has sort of had a large break with the West and seems to prefer or want or be eager for an alignment with you know China we have some trade issues with but he's very positive toward North Korea very positive toward Russia you know it's a very serious and important question I still can't help shaking my head at his at the big envelope and that he seems to be so easily played that if you treat him well as Putin has done yeah and if you flatter him the way North Korea seems to be doing yep he's on your side he doesn't care if you're you know if you about giving a photo-op to this repressive state of North Korea where they right there on this yeah whether it use mass starvation yeah I mean he just doesn't give it's all about how they respond a him and they seem to get this now our allies seem to take it for granted that you can have a reasonable adult relationship with the president the United States yeah well they're learning that's not the case yeah so whether it's judo or merkulov they're all looking at the United States and saying we actually want to work with you we actually share values with you democracy economic trade and all these other things and you are spurning us while going you know towards strongmen autocrats like you want to be because they flatter you and they play you it is a very serious matter but i think it's it's it's it's not a strategic intent yeah his part I think it's rooted in his personality disorder yeah and Malcolm you know there's a piece in political right now which I recommend everybody read which is called headline he pretty much gave in to whatever they asked when they talked about Donald Trump's deal making over the years and all the times he's basically given away the store the fact that he got very little for The Apprentice even because he asked for a million in episode you know he was told you can get fifty thousand he's like okay I just want that and and and it's already a little piece of it it says that Trump men in the Oval Office yesterday with Kim I mean this is the setup for this is that Trump did meet in the Oval Office yesterday with Kim Jung Choi who is the a chairman of the ruling Workers Party and former head of the North Korean intelligence services the RGB so he also met with you know an interpreter Mike Pompeo was in there John Kelly was in there he was escorted into the Oval Office by Andrew Kim a CIA officer in charge the office of the spy agency's Korea mission center etc etc so you have you have Donald Trump who is known to give away things when he feels flattered would Pete when he feels that people are nice to him the you know the Saudis UAE he's known to like sort of a personality type like duterte and now that person it has let the chief spy master from North Korea into the Oval Office having done the same letting the Russian Foreign Minister into the Oval Office does this worry you oh yeah very rhetorical question it should worry everyone and it's not just because Donald Trump has opened the door to North Korea we have to make rapprochement with our strategic adversaries even if it's Russia the way Nixon did to China it's the mechanism that it was done under and the philosophy that he believes that allows that to be opened David and you get made a very good summary Donald Trump believes in autocracy he does not believe in Republican democracy as it is represented or parliamentary democracy throughout Europe in the United States over its entire history he believes and his biggest obstacle is democracy that's why he doesn't like the investigations that's why he doesn't like the the way of governance in America and he feels comfortable with dictators and autocrats and you know I just finished a new book on this plot to destroy democracy which is which shows that he is a little complete alignment with Vladimir Putin because Putin has worked very hard over the last 20 years to create an axis of autocracies and Donald Trump was one of those people that they saw as very favorable to this global oligarchy running democratic nations and destroying the Atlantic Alliance the global world and democracy as it's been spread since the end of World War two and you know it's era to that very point you know there was a lot of criticism that came from Republicans about President Obama you know doing the Iran deal there's a lot of antipathy to a Donald Trump of course has now junked that deal but that deal was made in you know close conjunction with our Western allies it was a pan Western you know European and American deal and so it was a group or pouch mount with with Iran in this case Donald Trump really is going in the opposite direction right that you know the people we traditionally see as our allies he is you know hitting with trade sanctions etc and there is there does seem to be the sort of cleaving toward autocratic governments what does that mean you study these kinds of states what would that mean if you had in a realignment of the world where the United States was not a de facto you know leader of the West but what was more sort of free-form yeah I mean I think what everyone has said so far is exactly what we're seeing we're seeing a global realignment that favors autocracies that favors new alliances between autocrats and possibly the end of traditional alliances like NATO like NAFTA and of the end of our the u.s. relationship with our Ally's which Trump is intentionally trying to sabotage I think some of this is a personality thing Trump is a person you know who hates scrutiny but likes attention that's basically the mindset of a dictator he feels comfortable in situations for other dictators and you know in the u.s. often other criminals or kind of fixtures or mobsters are able to protect them in this way in terms of his motivation behind us though I think you also need to follow the money when you have an autocratic system when you have an alliance of dictators it is easier to carry off these kind of kleptocratic practices that Trump and Putin and others have been engaged in for 30 years so again you know you have this alliance of politics of business of crime that is you know underneath its buffering this new alliance of autocrats but I think if you kind of want to break it down that's where the trail that you should follow yeah and Christine I want to come to you on this because specifically for this June 12 meeting on North Korea on the one hand there is a great you know every person of goodwill should want there to be some kind of a deal that ends this 70 year stalemate on the Korean Peninsula and then hopefully you know improves the lives of the North Korean people but I wonder what you make of the circumstances of that meeting Donald Trump makes it the meeting then he pulls out of the meeting he seems to be very very eager for it and willing to give kim jeong-hoon a lot of the status that he's been seeking in the world the big letter and the praise that in exchange for the meeting and it's not clear just from his past that he you know will do the homework or be the great negotiator that he says he is so given all of it's on the table can you just give us some perspective on whether or not this realignment could you know in its own way help the Korean people what are we looking at here at this June 12 meeting thanks joy I mean I I completely disagree with most of the other panelists I first of all I mean the Defense Department the Pentagon just issued a report about who are the new enemies of the United States last December and it was China and Russia far beyond Isis so even though President Trump may be flip-flopping on who are our closest allies let's just remember that that has been the u.s. military position and we know during the Obama administration that the pivot to Asia meant that you know he would move sixty percent of u.s. naval and air force capacity from the Middle East in Europe towards the Asia Pacific as an effort to kind of encircle China we know that China obviously is soon going to eclipse the u.s. in terms of being the largest economy and so we know that there's obviously an ongoing struggle between the US and China over the South China Sea but you know when we talk about allies of the United States how could we completely dismiss South Korea which perhaps could be the most democratic country in the world moon jae-in was ushered in to power from a candlelight revolution this potentially could be the only successful Arab Spring in recent and modern times and so you know the greatest number of people voted in that election he has had you know enormous support 85% and this is what South Korea our ally historic ally has wanted and and I just don't understand why peace would not be a good thing I mean the fact that Donald Trump said yesterday that we are discussing ending the declaring an end to the Korean War this is a 70 year war that has divided the Korean Peninsula it has maintained that 5,000 American families with powa mi A's with you know still remains in North Korea that are wanting to have closure this is Korean American families that want to see their families in North Korea so you know let's let's bring this back to what this means and and also think about how much we spend annually seven hundred billion dollars towards defense quote unquote defense when that should be reinvested into things that really improve our day to day security we could really improve people's access to health care to food I mean one in three children go to bed hungry in this country so let's let's bring this back to what is important and what matters and you know for 80 million Koreans on the peninsula this is a historic day they are looking forward to this summit they very much want a peace treaty and so let's let's see whether Trump and led by Mike Pompeo and the the Department of State can negotiate a deal with North Korea that you know achieves both aims the North Koreans want a peace treaty the u.s. wants complete denuclearization I believe that it you know the great news was that he said it's going to be a process and that that is a very pragmatic diplomatic approach but let's let's just let's put it all into context about what this means about ending a cold war that really began on the Korean Peninsula now I think it's an important point and you know one of the questions I guess not going around the home very quickly I'll start with you David what you are seeing in this Trump era where his own sort of you know maybe err aside you're seeing the emergence of other leaders who are stepping forward and becoming very important and prominent leaders in their own right I agree that moon jae-in you know if anybody deserves to be referred well Peace Prize it's him I mean he has really made this happen is the sort of back door benefit of Donald Trump's disengagement that you will have other leaders like moon jae-in you're seeing Angela Merkel Emmanuel macron now you're seeing the Prime Minister of Canada other people have to step forward I think that's true they have to step forward particularly when it comes to defending the what you might call a Western set of values and principles I do think on the on the courious you and I take her points very seriously I think one of the issues has been that Donald Trump seems to you know while the goal is peace on the peninsula and denuclearization he's been erratic he's you know he's declared you know he's threatened nuclear war against North Korea he's derided the North Korean as Rocketman and then he invites in the spy chief who's involved with you know the death camps and then and so it's the erratic nature of this but I don't think it's fatigue ik which leads me to believe that Trump isn't serious they may not be up to the job it's very difficult getting peace in the peninsular and some degree of denuclearization and then what is the risk of failure Malcolm what would be the you know because I think Kristie makes the most important point which is the people on the Korean Peninsula who are in the balance and who it would be a great thing if this could work out but if Trump can't pull it off then what well then what people will do is what they're probably going to do anyway which is ignore Donald Trump and it would actually be in their interest to do that Trump wants a photo-op and he has already shown us that he is absolutely willing to do anything to get that photo op I mean even going so far as offered might pay the hotel bill in Singapore for the North Korean representatives but what's really at stake here is the matter of peace on the peninsula and Kim Jong on now it excuse me he is the player who will make the determination of what that piece looks like he will not give up his strategic nuclear forces there is no way if that is what brought him to the table to be an equal to the President of the United States he will probably lessen tensions with South Korea we open border cross border family visits reopened the the industry center that they had to get for North Korea but there are issues that have or took place with Japan like the hostages that they took from Japan that will never get resolved yeah I think everyone will be paying attention to this June 12 meeting because the stakes are so high for so many people you know there's not a lot of confidence necessarily a lot of people among American president but I definitely take Christine's point that the leader of South Korea someone we definitely all should be watching David Korins sticking around Thank You Malcolm Nance Thank You Sara Kenzie or Thank You Christine on and
