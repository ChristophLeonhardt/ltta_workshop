124
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,649
felt like today like dragged on but like

125
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,479
in a good way because we thought took us

126
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,399
so long to set up and get everything

127
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">organized and then it ended up only</font>

128
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,379
being like two hours like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it we</font>

129
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,609
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like for class and it was</font>

130
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">only two o'clock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

131
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,989
but we were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron this day is going</font>

132
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">so slow but everyone's pretty exhausted</font>

133
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,389
we're pretty ready for bed so we're

134
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:48,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some little campfire and</font>

135
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,509
then we're probably all gonna head to

136
00:07:50,509 --> 00:00:00,000
bed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then sleep all night long</font>
