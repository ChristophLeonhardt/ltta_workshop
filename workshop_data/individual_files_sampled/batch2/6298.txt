Annapolis Maryland has made a decision to do away with a Confederate monument now this monument is different from what we were reported on earlier this week with Baltimore taking down Confederate statues in the middle of the night now workers began removing the statue of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert aney who ruled in favor of slaveholders in the infamous Dred Scott case at about 12:20 a.m. on Friday so it happened this morning and as you guys can imagine they are purposely taking down these monuments in an effort to prevent controversy violence the type of scenes that we saw during the hate rallies in Charlottesville Virginia now the decision comes after Maryland governor Larry Hogan who is a Republican called for the Statue to be removed days ago Larry Logan did say the following while we cannot hide from our history nor should we the time has come to make clear the difference between properly acknowledging our past and glorifying the darkest chapters of our history great quote yeah that is a great quote and and keep in mind when they take down these Confederate statues they don't throw them in the garbage they're removing them and putting them in places that I would argue it makes more sense so either a cemetery that honors Confederate soldiers or a museum that talks about the history basically putting these monuments and these statues in its proper context in this case they're likely to go to the Maryland State Archives facility so I agree with it in the end bring them to archive or museum or Confederate cemetery those are logical places and it's it's not to say that they shouldn't exist of course not right it's just a matter of do you glorify them and do you honor them by putting in front of the state capitol or a courthouse or whether you have a slave auction now having said that you'll be hard-pressed to find people that are more opposed to the Confederacy than I am and it is amazing that we're having this conversation we still have to have a conversation as to whether we're opposed to the Confederacy we don't really have to it's you're just opposed to it it's like it's implicit yes but a lot of people did to this day and they defend the traitors who betrayed this country and so a part about why I'm so opposed to it is not just because they were for slavery but also because they hate in America and I love America and so if you're a fan of the Confederacy as I've told you before you should never chant USA USA cuz you're the exact opposite but I so since I can't stand the Confederacy and the people who did this I kind of liked where Baltimore put them temporarily they put them in a waste treatment facility right well if they have to exist in context if they're gonna exist they can't just be at the Statehouse in Tennessee right now Governor Bill Haslam who has for a long time actually as a Republican has said that he wants to get rid of the statute to Nathan Bedford Forrest who was a military tactician and a KKK member and a slave trader who was honored with a park in Memphis and honored with the statue at the Statehouse he has ordered that that statue be removed now the the opposition to that in the past was so strong that they changed the rules of how you remove a statue to favor the people that want the statues to stay there but they have to be in context fear black lawmaker and you're walking by someone who has a statue who was a slave trader right come on think about that it doesn't matter and not just the slave trader people who you know defended of course in the case obtaining ya know - no question and I want to touch on that a little bit because you know we talk about the Dred Scott decision and I'm sure everyone knows what that is but Taney was the one who wrote the decision and when you read the words that you use you can understand why people would find him or have a statue of him in a state house or in front of a State House so offensive so I'm gonna read you a part of his decision he says the question is simply this cannon Negro whose ancestors were imported into this country and sold as slaves become a member of the political community formed and brought into existence by the Constitution of the United States and as such become entitled to all the rights and privileges and immunities guaranteed by the instrument to the citizen one of which rights is one of which rights is the privilege of suing in a Court of the United States in the case is specified in the Constitution Taney ruled that black people were regarded as beings of an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations and so far inferior that they had no rights and that white men or white man was bound to respect and that the Negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefit so now that you've read that the alt-right would like him even more buddy yeah if you can't understand that african-americans don't want to walk past that guy on their way into the State House well there's not much we can do for you that means yeah you're fine with racism and and Tani's decision was so disastrous not only because it applied to slaves and we had slavery in the country and that was of course right before the Civil War but because it also applied to former slaves and they said no no you're not a human being I don't care what your legal rights are and whether your slave reforms sleep you're black you're inferior to all of us you don't even belong in this courthouse and have no rights by the way this is also the same period of time where the Supreme Court ruled that corporations are human beings and have all the rights of human beings now that God expanded as the years went on and later in the 1970s and of course famously in citizens united it got to mean that they can give political donations but back then is when they decided corporations were people and had rights that citizens do but black people who are actually human beings were not right ironic that and the civil war led to citizens united yeah so Tanny you know his thatch is being removed is a great day in America and and he was one of the worst Supreme Court justices with one of the worst decisions that were that guy should not be celebrated I think the waste treatment facility is a perfectly good place for him but fine and eventually move them to an archive somewhere where he belongs and guess what Republicans you can do this you can order the removal of a statue and still wake up the next day and you're fine and your Republican governor and even governing and doing the things that a lot of people who of my oak don't like but you can still do the right thing once in a while and it does not crush you do that more of them did it Haslam and and and Larry Hogan and Maryland good stuff and if you're black and you're walking past the tanne statue that's like being in Germany and being Jewish and having to walked by a Goebbels statue yeah it's it's not acceptable it it doesn't mean that all Germans are bad today or even back then but it means that we shouldn't celebrate Goebbels we shouldn't erase them from history because we need to learn from it same with Tanny it's an important part of history but it doesn't mean that we should walk past them on the way to an official government building that represents all of us and you don't have to in Germany you go to a museum and you can see what you want about Goebbels if you want to see that stuff and that there's a lot to be gleaned and learned from it and there as there is for Nathan Bedford Forrest and judge tani there you know it's important to see that history where it's meant to be seen help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
