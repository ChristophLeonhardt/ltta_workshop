1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
Most people know that Facebook
has information about them.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,560
We submit things like
our names, our hometowns,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,890
our ages, our birthdays
and our interests,

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,570
and we assume that Facebook
is collecting that data.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,280
But Facebook has much
more data on most people

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,900
than they realize.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,970
Facebook can take all
the data that you submit

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,370
and combine it with
data from other users

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,700
and outside information to
construct a profile of you.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,870
Facebook uses nearly
100 different data points

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,580
to classify your
interests and activities.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,560
This would include basic stuff
like your age and gender,

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,590
but also more
complicated information

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,450
like whether you
own a motorcycle

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,910
or you recently went on
vacation or whether you’re

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,200
a gadget geek.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,180
Researchers have found
that by using signals

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,310
such as your likes
and interactions,

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,620
Facebook could tell if
you were in a relationship

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,720
or going through a breakup.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,540
Facebook doesn’t just 
know who you are.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,550
It also knows
where you are.

23
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,250
If you have location tracking
turned on, Facebook

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,620
collects an enormous
amount of location data

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,310
about where you’re going, 
where you came from,

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,740
where you live,
where you work,

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,970
what restaurants and
businesses you tend to go to.

28
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,970
And they use this information
to target ads at you.

29
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,430
And location data could
reveal other people who

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,414
live in your house,
even if you’re not

31
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,663
connected to them
on Facebook.

32
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,710
Now obviously,
Facebook knows what

33
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,944
its users buy when they
click on ads from Facebook.

34
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:31,470
But what most
people don’t realize

35
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,010
is that they have
ways of tracking

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,830
your offline 
purchases as well.

37
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,780
For many years, Facebook 
has had partnerships

38
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,790
with data brokers that
collected information

39
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,350
about people’s purchases.

40
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,560
So for example, if you buy a
burrito with your credit card,

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,531
Facebook could know 
about that transaction,

42
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,720
match it with a credit card
that you’ve added

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,535
to Facebook or 
Facebook Messenger,

44
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,695
and start showing you ads
for indigestion medicine.

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,400
One of the most controversial
parts of Facebook data collection

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,820
is a feature called
“People You May Know.”

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,020
And this is where Facebook
uses many different signals

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,070
of what it knows about you
to determine who

49
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,140
else you might be connected to.

50
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,740
And this is not always things
that you share with Facebook.

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,760
It might be contacts
in your phone.

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,240
It might be people who have
been in the same room as you.

53
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,150
Facebook was using location
data to recommend friends.

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,620
So it might have
been recommending

55
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,540
people who share
a doctor with you

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,395
or work in the same building.

57
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,750
Facebook can also be
used to compile data

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,570
about your political activity
like protests or marches you go to.

59
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,070
In one case in 2016,
the A.C.L.U. found

60
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,320
that 500 police organizations
had signed up

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,570
for a service called
Geofeedia, which scraped

62
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,050
data from social networks
like Facebook, Twitter

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,150
and Instagram to help
officers look for users who

64
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,910
might be in a specific location

65
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,840
or attending a specific protest.

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,670
For example, Geofeedia
claimed it helped

67
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,320
the Baltimore Police Department
monitor and respond

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,050
to the protests after
the death of Freddie Gray.

69
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,490
Facebook doesn’t just know
who you are, where you are

70
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,020
and what you buy.

71
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,330
It also can be used to figure
out what kinds of things

72
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,900
you might do in the future.

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,240
To predict life outcomes,

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,590
like whether you will be
addicted to substances,

75
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,030
whether you will switch
political parties,

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,050
whether you’re physically healthy
or physically unhealthy.

77
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,900
These are all part of the
information that advertisers

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:00:00,000
love to know because it helps
them better target users.
