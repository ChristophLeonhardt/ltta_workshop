if somebody were to ask me what foods
should I focus on buying organically I
would recommend focusing on ones where
there is no skin actually on the fruit
so a strawberry a blueberry raspberry
foods that you're eating as they are if
you're talking about things like oranges
or avocados or pineapples where the skin
not only is it not edible but it's also
very tough those are ones where if you
are unable to buy everything organically
then you can rest more assured that if
you buy those fruits in a conventional
sense you're not getting as many
pesticides you're not getting as many
pesticides with an orange or a pineapple
or an avocado because of the thick skin
which acts as a sort of barrier
