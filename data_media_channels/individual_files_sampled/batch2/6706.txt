Taylor Swift just released the music video for her song look what you made me do and it's garnering its fair share of controversy not just in the normal you know musician's circles but also in the larger discussion in one instance of domestic violence but let's first take a look at some stills from that video it is first starts in a graveyard and there's a lot of little images nested this one's Nils she Oberg that is the alias that she used when writing a song for Rihanna and Calvin Harris it was at the center of the reason that she and Calvin broke up and so that's in there she is laying the basis for all the in justices done to her next to her in this bed of jewels later is one dollar bill that it symbolizes the one dollar that she won in the civil case against the DJ who touched her butt and sued her for millions and millions of dollars but instead she won the case against him in the counter suit for $1 then it gets a little there's a little violent imagery SH there's a line that says the gun was mine you you said the gun was mine saying essentially someone framed her for something she did do but there's fire coming out of her fingers moving on following the dust-up with Kanye and Kim a lot of Kanye and Kim fans called Taylor a snake so she is surrounded by snakes who are serving her tea tea which is a metaphor for gossip ladies later on this is stream KO which she Rob's the vault of violently with a baseball bat and since she's been called the cat lady she's surrounded by people wearing those people who are now not wearing cat masks were at one point wearing cap cap masks this she's talking how she was kind of vilified in the for being a money-grubbing maniac by some when she wrote an open letter to Apple telling them to pay artists instead of not pay artists during the 3-month trial period ahead of the Apple music launch there she's mad she doesn't like that she's pointing out baseball bad at you late this is todrick Hall friend of pop trigger he was in the video is uh wearing an I heart Taylor Swift shirt which was wearing by Tom Hiddleston her ex-boyfriend this kind of setting up all the reasons that she has been victimized in the past and she continues you'll see another image her on top of all the images of Taylor Swift it's a mountain of Taylor Swift's you'll see from a different angle her looking down at other incarnations of Taylor in the past from the guitar wielding country music sweet star who cried a lot to various other like the red album era though you want to say red wedding the red one this is almost like a red wedding of herself because she's killing all the old Taylor Swift's yep and so it's fascinating imagery it's in some ways got more symbolism than Game of Thrones the pearls are a reference to her being criticized for liking pearls too much so she's both going after her opponents in the media and the music industry but also saying she's done with being that I think the timid selfish used to be in some portions of her career so it's very interesting but since she's saying look what you made me do that's also leading to calls for saying that this video is encouraging domestic violence because that's what a lot of abusers say look what you made me do right we have a tweet we can draw up real quick from Justyna Ireland her her exact words are look what you made me do is the exact phrase my dad entered every time he would knock the shit out of me just not a good look okay now the song is not about domestic violence it has to do with going after her enemies in fact if you read the whole song which I did I'm such a nerd I didn't listen to the song I read the song hey it sounds like Arya Stark is singing okay I literally said like almost everything you could put into Arya Stark like I'm going after my enemies I'm gonna get you one by one I've got you on a list I'm like okay so I'm curious what you guys think because so the people who are saying look and this happened to me the domestic violence and this is what they say and is just anecdotal some people who take care of domestic violence victims say this is the the most common phrase that they hear right I've got my sauce out of but what do you think so I don't love the title of the song I think she could have gone in a different direction and I hate that phrase and it's funny because even before I knew that she was getting criticism for promoting supposedly promoting domestic violence when I heard the title of song I'm like mmm that's like something someone would say you know right before or after they're about to abuse someone so I didn't I didn't like the title with that said based on the imagery that you showed us Brett I don't feel like the imagery promotes violence you know maybe her doing the gun gesture with her hand can-can you know make that argument but that was really the only thing I saw what what annoys me more than anything about this whole situation and the music video is this isn't anything new okay this is usually what young pop stars do when they first have a squeaky-clean like I'm a really good girl like image and then all of a sudden they grew up just a little bit and they're like I'm so bad and edgy I'm so bad look at how bad I am well I'm gonna get you like that it's so played out I know Taylor I know you're very edgy you're very upset you're gonna come after your enemies blah blah blah level I'm just it's just boring that's that's more than anything that's what I get out of it oh fasting I didn't see that coming I have a totally different opinion but Brett I think Taylor is such a fascinating figure she has done so many things incredibly well the open adults Apple the open letter to Apple open Apple is an old button on the Apple keyboard that doesn't exist anymore but the open letter to Apple according to time saved Apple music she called them out because they said there's gonna be a free 30-day trial or 3-month trial for folks who sign up for Apple music and Taylor wrote an open letter saying so you're gonna pay everybody right you're gonna pay all the artists for that three-month trial because according to my research you're not gonna pay them and money and so through that there was able to be a dialogue where small artists who are on Apple music would get paid albeit a reduced rate for their music that is listened to on Apple so she has done a lot of things and she's been a very wily businesswoman I like I like that she went after the guy who you know decided to sue her after he grabbed her but and then you know complain that he lost his job as a result of that I'm glad I love the way that she you know handled that situation so I'm not saying she's all bad I just she's just annoying sometimes she does her standard popstar BS and it gets under my skin so look look in terms of Taylor let me quickly just go through that I care more about the larger issue look she's definitely savvy marketing person and so she's coming out with this video she Sue's the guy before this video comes out hey look I'm standing up for other women so now this video comes like come on I've got some street cred right with Kanye they have that beef back and forth where Kanye did play the tape of her giving permission to talk about him in the song cuz she knows that's gonna drain and generate more controversy but then Katya puts in about how he might sleep with her which they didn't agree to roll but all it does is get her more and more hype in marketing and that's how the music industry works and I'm with you Anna reminds me of the McGregor Mayweather fight yeah super annoyed by all that pre fight like oh we hate each other we're gonna say this about your bitch now you're a bitch and all this stuff and after the fight they hug and they're like oh that's good sportsmanship partly and partly they were just faking it to get more money from you earlier pretending to be angry at each other with God knows you know yeah so so much of this is fake it's so annoying having said that I think the more interesting part is the people who went through domestic violence getting quote-unquote triggered by that this is where people would go oh yeah you're soft what think they went through domestic violence they're not soft and so for them their reaction is perfectly normal and understandable on the other hand I don't think that there's anything wrong with the song so I'm not sure how to resolve that so she's not talking about domestic violence she doesn't mean to trigger people who have had a bad experience with that and we're holding her to a double standard cuz dr. Dre has a song about look at what you made me do almost exactly the same thing from the chronic album right you went and turned me back into the old me anyhow he went back in what was gangster and he has a lot more of that song than a finger with fire coming no I know but I mean look first of all rappers like dr. Dre have been criticized for their lyrics and for promoting violence and the way that they treat women it's not like they've been treated with kid gloves you know there's so-and-so while the lyrics are fine it's also it's weird because the song is about you know getting revenge on people who have wronged her like getting revenge how you know what I'm saying like that when you're using baseball bats and you're doing like gun gestures with your hand that does trigger people so I get it I get the people yeah I hear you but first of all I had no problem with the bad no prom of the various she had like a knife that she was wielding somewhere that in a different video yeah and she also blew people up in a different bad blood has tons of explosions it looks like a Michael Bay film but when Joe Pesci uses a bat in Goodfellas or a phone or whatever he's meeting with people with we don't go always sending the wrong message because that's so amazed and he's supposed to and it's a cool gangster movie or etc but dr. Dre does get the criticism you're right about that and now Taylor gets the criticism so right yeah look if you pretend like you're gonna be a bad girl then you're gonna get criticism for being a bad girl it just I comes along with the territory this yeah this was such a well thought out video with so many images in it and we went through them all and it's fantastic to watch and really like intellectually engaging to unpack that said the premise of look what you made me do is one where you're giving up responsibility and pinning it on someone else and that's a weak position because if it's your decision you need to come at it from a different reason it's like I'm out for justice that there are lines in this that's like I got mine and now you'll get yours which is more of a like if you did something wrong something Bad's gonna happen to you but it she has another line later where she says all play the actress in your bad dreams or something like that and that is more like she's moving toward the role of the villain more than she's actually going to do things that that make her a villain so it I think it's more complicated than that but I do think on its face look what you made me do is a weak rhetorical position for anyone who's making a large statement every one of you has made excellent points yes I now have a roy bring it okay not guilty yeah so all the it's fake it's rhetorically bad it does we do feel bad for the people that it affects negatively but a thousand pieces of entertainment and this is entertainment have talked about revenge and getting justice and I could see Ana Kasparian make a video about what now I know I think the difference there is that's who I am and I've been that person from day one right I didn't start showing up with like my like ruffle II white dress and like blonde hair like I'm a good girl I'm such a good girl and then all of a sudden I show up and I'm like I'm bad I'm gonna get you all like you know what I'm saying like it just comes off as so incredibly fake like just being genuine and authentic she's been in this since she was just a kid I know Anna right since you were a baby since I was 20 she's eight or something sixteen but you know it's possible no you're definitely right about the fakeness but it is also possibly she got pissed at having constantly being attacked than me because she's a well-known celebrity and that we feel her pain on so and nonetheless these are great great points yeah but you might have not heard me earlier I rule if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership tea white tea network.com sighs joy
