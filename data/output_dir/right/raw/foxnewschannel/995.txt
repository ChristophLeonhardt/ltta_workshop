1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,671
BEFORE WE CAN CALL THE TIGHT

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,241
DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR GOVERNOR.

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:07,541
DANA?

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,543
>> Sandra: THANKS, JONATHAN.

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,612
FOR MORE, I'M JOINED BY CHRIS

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,014
STIREWALT AND EDITOR OF HALF

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:14,615
TIME REPORT.

8
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,550
CHRIS, WHILE JONATHAN WAS

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,851
TALKING, SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,353
CAME TO THE PODIUM.

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,488
THEY HAD THE POLICY LUNCH, THE

12
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,690
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,091
SEPARATELY.

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,193
WHEN CHUCK SCHUMER CAME OUT, HE

15
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,428
TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND

16
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:30,030
THEN HE IMMEDIATELY PIVOTED TO

17
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,431
HEALTHCARE.

18
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,632
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

19
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,567
HOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE

20
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,968
APPROACHING THESE MID-TERMS?

21
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,336
>> THERE'S BEEN DISAGREEMENT

22
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,205
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, BETWEEN

23
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,073
BRANCHES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

24
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,575
AND WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AND

25
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,144
MOST USEFUL FOCUS FOR DEMOCRATS

26
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,113
IS IN 2018.

27
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,315
CHUCK SCHUMER IS NOT AMBIGUOUS

28
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,116
ON THE QUESTION.

29
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,784
HE BELIEVES AND IS SUPPORTING

30
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,921
WITH A LOT OF POLLING DATA THAT

31
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,022
HEALTHCARE WORKS FOR DEMOCRATS.

32
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:58,425
WHO HAD BEEN A NEGATIVE FOR THEM

33
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,261
UNDER OBAMA NOW IN THE REGIME OF

34
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,963
SORT OF HOBBLED OBAMACARE WITH

35
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,032
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAVING

36
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,267
GUTTED MUCH OF OBAMACARE, BUT

37
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,302
STILL LEFT THE CONSTRUCT THERE,

38
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,070
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A REAL

39
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,305
OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH REPUBLICANS

40
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,539
ON HEALTH INSURANCE, ON

41
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,775
HEALTHCARE AND SCHUMER WANTS TO

42
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,477
DISCIPLINE HIS PARTY THAT THEY

43
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,779
FOCUS ON THAT.

44
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,948
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WORKS.

45
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:21,715
>> Sandra: MIGHT BE BE ONE OF

46
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,883
THE ONLY ISSUES.

47
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,651
I WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT JONATHAN

48
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,053
HUNT WAS TALKING ABOUT.

49
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,554
YOU HAVE THIS RACE IN NEVADA AND

50
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,489
ALSO IN NORTH DAKOTA.

51
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,990
YOU HAVE A RACE SETTLED.

52
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,726
THAT WILL BE A BIG ONE AS WELL.

53
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,094
>> NORTH DAKOTA, WE'RE WAITING

54
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,763
FOR THE MAIN EVENT.

55
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,233
WE HAVE TWO -- BECAUSE IT'S A

56
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,168
SPARSELY POPULATED STATE, NORTH

57
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,470
DAKOTA'S CONGRESSMAN, KEVIN

58
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,405
CRAMER IS ELECTED AT LARGE.

59
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,207
THIS IS A RARE CIRCUMSTANCE

60
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,408
WHERE YOU'LL HAVE SOMEBODY

61
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,343
RUNNING FOR SENATE WHO HAS

62
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,746
ALREADY BEEN ELECTED BY THE

63
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,480
VOTERS.

64
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,382
HEIDI HEITKAMP, A FRESHMAN THAT

65
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,651
WON THE FAVOR OF PRESIDENT

66
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:57,951
TRUMP.

67
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,653
SHE'S A DEMOCRAT BUT HE

68
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,088
OBVIOUSLY LIKES HER.

69
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,422
SHARING THE HAND, TELLS HER

70
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,824
SHE'S DOING A GOOD JOB.

71
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,726
SHE'S BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO HIM.

72
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,195
THIS IS FRUSTRATING FOR CRAMER

73
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,064
THAT WANTS A MORE CLEAR RED

74
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,266
VERSUS BLUE LINE HERE BUT TRUMP

75
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,935
HAS MUDDIED IT FOR HIM.

76
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,270
>> Sandra: TELL ME ABOUT

77
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,637
VIRGINIA.

78
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,705
THEY VOTED IN 2017 IN THE

79
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,173
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION.

80
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,175
THE DEMOCRATS HAD TREMENDOUS

81
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:22,509
TURNOUT.

82
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,979
CAN THEY PULL THAT OFF AGAIN IN

83
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,280
2018?

84
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,282
WILL YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION OF

85
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,082
THAT TONIGHT?

86
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,717
>> WE'LL SEE SOME SIGNS.

87
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,553
IN VIRGINIA, YOU HAVE TWO OR

88
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,421
THREE HOUSE RACES WHERE IT'S

89
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,389
COMPETITIVE IN VIRGINIA.

90
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,723
THE SENATE RACE IS NOT

91
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,324
COMPETITIVE.

92
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,393
THEY DON'T HAVE A GUBERNATORIAL

93
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,894
CONTEST THIS YEAR.

94
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,031
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

95
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,632
THE HOUSE DISTRICTS.

96
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,501
HOW DO THE DEMOCRATS SORT

97
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,402
THEMSELVES OUT AND REMEMBER PART

98
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,838
OF THE SECRET NOR DEMOCRATS IN

99
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,040
VIRGINIA, THEIR GREAT

100
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,975
PERFORMANCE WAS THE FACT THAT

101
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,145
LIBERAL VOTERS LINED UP BEHIND

102
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:03,116
MODERATES LIKE GOVERNOR RALPH

103
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:03,450
NORTHUN.

104
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,686
WILL WE VERY DIVISION,

105
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,086
AGREEMENT?

106
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,155
IT'S NOT JUST HOW ROBUST THEY

107
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:08,655
ARE.

108
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,890
IT'S HOW MUCH IN AGREEMENT THEY

109
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,190
ARE.

110
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,425
>> Sandra: FINALLY, TAKE ME TO

111
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:11,892
SOUTH CAROLINA.

112
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,595
WE'RE WATCHING A COUPLE RACES

113
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:14,928
THERE.

114
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,197
REPRESENTATIVE MARK SANFORD, THE

115
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,799
INCUMBENT, TRYING TO BEAT BACK

116
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,702
HIS PRIMARY CHALLENGE ON THE

117
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,502
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

118
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,872
REPUBLICAN HENRY McMASTER HOPING

119
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,708
TO GET TRUMP SUPPORT.

120
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,476
>> IF McMASTER IS NOT FINE, THAT

121
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,510
WOULD BE A SHOCKER.

122
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,746
HE IS THE SOUL OF THE STATE'S

123
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,014
POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT

124
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,349
PREDATES NIKKI HALEY, THE

125
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,550
REVOLUTION THAT SHE BROUGHT TO

126
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,250
THE STATE.

127
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,019
HE'S OF THE OLD GUARD, BUT HE

128
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,554
ALSO HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE

129
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:40,921
PRESIDENT.

130
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,723
HE OUGHT TO BE FINE.

131
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,758
SANFORD IS IN A DIFFICULT SPOT.

132
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,127
HE'S CARVED OUT A GOOD SECOND

133
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,495
CAREER FOR HIMSELF AS A

134
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:48,895
CONGRESSMAN.

135
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,897
A ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE, DO A GOOD

136
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,533
JOB KIND OF CONGRESSMAN, LOW

137
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,668
PROFILE AFTER THE SCANDAL AND

138
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,302
ALL THAT STUFF.

139
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,205
NOW HE FACES AN OPPONENT THAT IS

140
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,773
TOTALLY WILLING TO GO THERE.

141
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,508
SHE'S WILLING TO GO AFTER HIM ON

142
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,809
HIS SCANDAL, SHE'S WILLING TO

143
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,144
CALL HIM OUT FOR THE TIMES THAT

144
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,479
HE'S BEEN CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT

145
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,814
TRUMP AND SHE'S HOPING THAT IN

146
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,717
THAT DISTRICT TRUMP AFFINITY

147
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,319
WILL SORT OF GO BEYOND THE

148
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,921
ATTACHMENT THAT THESE VOTERS

149
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,824
HAVE FOR A CONGRESSMAN THAT

150
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,892
SERVED HIM WELL.

151
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,726
>> Sandra: ARE YOU GOING TO STAY

152
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:21,394
UP LATE?

153
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,596
>> HECK YEAH.

154
00:04:22,596 --> 00:00:00,000
SHANNON BREAM AND I WILL BE
