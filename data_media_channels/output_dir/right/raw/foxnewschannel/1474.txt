00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:18,956

12
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,160
THEY’RE MAKING THEIR WAY BACK

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,129
FROM THE FAR NORTHEAST CORNER

14
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,899
DOWN TO AN EASTERN COASTAL CITY

15
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,401
ON A VERY SLOW TRAIN RIDE.

16
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:32,470
NORTH KOREA DOES IN FACT CLAIM

17
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,008
THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE

18
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,409
DISMANTLEMENT OF THE SITE.

THOSE ON THE GROUND SAID IT WAS

23
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,287
SPECTACULAR A FORCEFUL BLAST.

00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,735
KIM JONG-UN, THIS CAME A FEW

29
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,303
HOURS BEFORE THE CANCELLATION

30
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:08,440

MONTH.

34
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,245
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BUYER’S

35
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,581
REMORSE ON THE PART OF THE

36
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,449
REGIME, TRACE.

00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,799
WE UNDERSTAND THE SOUTH KOREAN

46
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,435
PRESIDENT WAS IN A SPECIAL

47
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,537
SESSION WITH HIS NATIONAL

48
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:40,272
SECURITY STAFF.

49
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:44,777
THEY’RE URGING DIRECT TALKS AND

50
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:46,378
SAYING DENUCLEARIZATION CANNOT

THIS CHANGE OF HEART, MAYBE NOT

56
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,090
GOTTEN ANY WARNING.

57
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,725
HE SAID HE WAS QUITE PERPLEXED

58
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:02,595
AND MAYBE REGRETTING THE WHOLE

59
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:02,895
THING.

60
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:05,498
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SPOKEN ABOUT

61
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:07,066
SPEAKING WITH SOUTH KOREA AND

62
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,036
JAPAN ABOUT MILITARY READINESS

63
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:10,902
FOR ANY NEW TROUBLE.

64
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,739
THAT’S GOT TO BE A BLOW TO THE

65
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,340
SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.

66
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,509

FINDING A DIPLOMATIC RESOLUTION

68
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,579
TO THIS CRISIS.

69
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,446
IT WAS SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT

THIS WHITE HOUSE SUMMIT

74
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:29,255
CANCELLATION SEEMS TO STAND FROM

00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,524
A STATEMENT ISSUED EARLIER

76
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:33,193

MEETING IN A MEETING ROOM.

80
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,570
SO FAR AT LEAST AS YOU NOTE, WE

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,472
HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING BACK

82
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:46,806
FROM NORTH KOREA AND WHETHER

83
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:48,708
THEY WILL RESPOND AND MAYBE

AGREE WITH THE UNITED STATES TO

85
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:52,012
RESPOND THE CORRECT WAY.

86
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,613
