>>DONALD TRUMP CLAIMS HE'D LIKE
TO PUSH FORWARD WITH A
BIPARTISAN EFFORT ON AN
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND RECENTLY
CNN HOSTED A PANEL TO DISCUSS
THIS SO-CALLED LEGISLATION, AND
JOHN PHILLIPS, A CONSERVATIVE
COMMENTATOR AND COLUMNIST, HAD
AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON
WHAT TRUMP SHOULD DO MOVING
FORWARD ON THIS LEGISLATION.
TAKE A LOOK.
>>I THINK IT'S ALTRUISTIC FOR
HIM TO START OUT WANTING TO GET
A BIPARTISAN BILL THROUGH BUT HE
SHOULD HAVE A PLAN B READY TO GO
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S LIKELY TO
FALL APART ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
>>WHY?
>>I SUSPECT DEMOCRATS WILL GO
INTO THIS BEING BOTH GREEDY AND
DIFFICULT, GREEDY BECAUSE TRUMP
WILL BE LEFT HOLDING THE PRICE
TAG SO THEY WILL ASK FOR THE
MOON, AND DIFFICULT BECAUSE ONCE
YOU'VE BEEN PART OF THE
RESISTANCE IT'S HARD TO GO FROM
SAYING THE GUY SHOULD BE
IMPEACHED TO SAYING THE BRIDGES
ARE IRRESISTIBLE.
SO I SUSPECT
HE WILL NEED MORE REPUBLICAN
VOTES THAN HE THINKS HE IS, AND
I WOULD DO THAT BY SPENDING THE
MONEY IN RED STATES, AND WHEN I
SPEND MONEY AND BLUE STATES I
WOULD MAKE SURE TO TARGET THAT
MONEY IN DISTRICTS WHERE
VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS ARE
RUNNING FOR REELECTION.
>>WOW, THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY,
BLATANTLY POLITICAL.
I'M NOT
SAYING THAT IT'S NOT MAY BE A
SMART POLITICAL STRATEGY BUT
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ALSO A LOT
OF BLUE STATES THAT NEED THAT
WORK ON THEIR BRIDGES AND ROADS.
>>OKAY.
>>IF YOU NOTICE IN ONE OF THE
28 CORNERS THAT CNN HAS WAS A
GUY WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN SHAKING
HIS HEAD LIKE, WHOA, WHAT THE
HELL WAS THAT SUGGESTION?
THAT
THE REPUBLICANS ARE JUST.
THESE
ARE NOT NORMAL TIMES, IF OBAMA
HAD GONE OUT AND SAID I'M JUST
GOING TO GIVE BLACKS EVERYTHING
AND WHITES WHO VOTED AGAINST ME
I WON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING,
HEADS WOULD'VE EXPLODED.
AS THEY
SHOULD BE.
IF HE SAID I ONLY
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED
FOR ME, NOT THE PEOPLE WHO
DIDN'T. A CLASSIC LINE
PRESIDENTS SAY IS I'M GOING TO
REPRESENT EVERYBODY.
TRUMP AND
THESE CONSERVATIVES, THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IT, THEY DON'T CARE.
IF
YOUR BRIDGE COLLAPSES IN A BLUE
STATE, THEY DON'T CARE.
THEY
DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, THEY'VE
NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU.
>>LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THE
MORAL AND ETHICAL COMPONENT TO
THIS BECAUSE REMEMBER, THIS
ISN'T TAXPAYER MONEY THAT'S BEEN
CONTRIBUTED TO FEDERAL COFFERS
BY REPUBLICANS OR PEOPLE IN RED
STATES, THIS IS MONEY THAT'S
BEEN CONTRIBUTED BY PEOPLE OF
ALL POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES, ALL
POLITICAL LEANINGS.
THIS IS OUR
HARD EARNED MONEY THAT GOES TO
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SPENT ON THINGS
THAT BENEFIT US AS A COUNTRY AND
BENEFIT OUR LIVES REGARDLESS OF
WHAT OUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION
IS. AND, LOOK, WHEN I TALK ABOUT
THIS, PEOPLE IN RED STATES GET
FIRED UP AND ANGRY, BUT THE
NUMBERS PROVE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO
SAY -- PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN STATES
LIKE CALIFORNIA OR PLACES LIKE
NEW YORK CITY, ALL OF THE AREAS
OF THE COUNTRY THAT THE RED
STATES HATE, THEY CONTRIBUTE A
LOT MORE WHEN IT COMES TO
TAXPAYER MONEY.
AND A LOT OF
THAT TAXPAYER MONEY ACTUALLY
GETS ALLOCATED TO RED STATES IN
THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.
I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO SIT
HERE AND SAY I WANT MY TAXPAYER
MONEY TO GO TO ME AND MY PEOPLE
AND MY POLITICAL AFFILIATION.
NO.
I WANT TAXPAYER MONEY TO GO
TOWARD IMPROVING THE LIVES OF
ALL AMERICANS.
SO TO SIT THERE
AND SAY I WANT THIS POLITICAL
STRATEGY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT
WILL GO AHEAD AND BENEFIT THE
SAME PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR TRUMP,
WHO WILL THEN TURN AROUND AND GO
FOR TRUMP AGAIN FOR REELECTION,
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HE'S
SAYING THERE, IT'S UPSETTING.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE ARE SO FAR
REMOVED FROM ETHICS AT THIS
POINT OR MORALS AT THIS POINT,
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND
TO IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
STRATEGY SHOULD BE USED BY
GOODHEARTED PEOPLE WHEN IT'S NOT
A FAIR PLAYING FIELD ANYMORE.
>>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS, IN
MY OPINION, WE HAVE DISCUSSED
BEFORE, WHAT THEY VIEW TO BE US
VERSUS THEM.
A LOT OF
CONSERVATIVES HAVE A LIMITED
SCOPE OF US, AND THEY ARE
ACTUALLY VERY GOOD TO THE PEOPLE
IN THAT CIRCLE OF WHAT THEY
CONSIDER US.
THEIR COMMUNITY,
THEIR CHURCH, THEIR FAMILY, THEY
ARE WONDERFUL TO THOSE FOLKS.
SO
THEY AREN'T BAD PEOPLE IN THAT
SENSE.
BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS THE
OTHERS.
IT USED TO BE ON RACIAL
GROUNDS, UNFORTUNATELY FOR A LOT
OF PEOPLE IT STILL IS, AND IT
USED TO BE PEOPLE WHO GOT
DIVORCED, THAT'S AGAINST THE
BIBLE, WE SHUN THEM, THEY ARE NO
LONGER PART OF US.
THEN
EVERYBODY GOT DIVORCED, THAT WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE, THEN THEY SORT OF
PICKING ON GAYS, AND ON AND ON
IT GOES.
SO FOR THEM, WHY DID
THE MAJORITY OF TEXAS
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS VOTE
AGAINST RELIEF FOR SUPER STORM
SANDY THAT HIT THE NORTHEAST?
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK YOU ARE
PART OF THEM.
THEY THINK YOU ARE
THE OTHERS.
AND THEY HAVE NO
EMPATHY FOR YOU.
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOU AT ALL.
IF YOU WERE IN
THEIR CHURCH, THEIR COMMUNITY,
THEY WOULD CARE A LOT, IN FACT
THOSE SAME TEXAS REPUBLICANS,
WHEN HURRICANE HARVEY HIT
HOUSTON, ALL VOTED FOR RELIEF
MONEY.
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT
PRINCIPLE.
IF IT'S THEIR PEOPLE,
THEY CARE.
IF IT'S NOT THEIR
PEOPLE, THEY DON'T -- I KNOW IT
DOESN'T COMPUTE FOR
PROGRESSIVES, HOW COULD THEY NOT
CARE ABOUT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS?
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS, WE ARE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.
NO, TO THEM
THEY AREN'T IN IT TOGETHER WITH
YOU.
IF YOU LIVE IN CONNECTICUT
OR NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA YOU
ARE THEM, AND THEY WILL CUT YOUR
MONEY EVEN THOUGH IT'S MAINLY
YOUR MONEY BEING DOLED OUT, THEY
WILL TAKE IT FOR THEMSELVES AND
GIVE YOU NOTHING AND THINK THEY
ARE GOOD PEOPLE.
WHAT, I GOT IT
FOR MY COMMUNITY?
I ROBBED YOU
TO GET IT BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOU, YOU ARE FROM CONNECTICUT.
WHEREAS PROGRESSIVES HAVE AN
EXPANSIVE VISION OF US.
IT
INCLUDES ALL THE RACES, GENDERS,
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES ALABAMA.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
HUMAN
BEINGS, AMERICANS, LIVE IN
ALABAMA AND WE CARE ABOUT THEM.
SO WHEN THINGS BEFALL THEM, WHEN
THEIR BRIDGES FALL AND THEY GET
HIT BY A HURRICANE, WE WANT TO
HELP THEM BECAUSE WE VIEW THEM
AS PART OF US.
>>IF THE LIBERAL STRATEGIST OR
COMMENTATOR WAS ON THAT PANEL
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
BUT SAID THE SAME THING AND THE
TABLES ARE FLIPPED AND IT WOULD
BENEFIT BLUE STATES, I WOULD BE
SO EMBARRASSED.
I WOULD BE SO
EMBARRASSED BY THAT.
BECAUSE YOU
ARE PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES.
ARE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A WHOLE
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS
FALLING APART, AND WHEN YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT BRIDGES AND ROADS
-- THINK ABOUT CALIFORNIA, FOR
INSTANCE.
CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES, WE HAVE
EARTHQUAKES, YOU HAVE OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT ARE
NOW DEALING WITH EXTREME WEATHER
CONDITIONS THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED
IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR
INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITHSTAND
EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS,
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING
MONEY AWAY FROM CERTAIN PARTS OF
THE COUNTRY, FINALLY GET INTO
OTHER PARTS FOR POLITICAL
STRATEGY, YOU ARE MESSING WITH
PEOPLE'S LIVES.
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE FAILS IN
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
THAT YOU'VE ADVOCATED FOR A CUT
IN FUNDING SO YOU CAN FUNNEL
THAT MONEY INTO OTHER STATES?
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE, IT'S IMMORAL,
IT'S INHUMAN.
I KNOW JOHN
PHILLIPS PERSONALLY.
PERSONALLY,
HE'S NOT A BAD PERSON, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?
BUT TO HEAR
THIS KIND OF COMMENTARY, IT'S
JUST -- IT MAKES ME LOSE HOPE
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE ARE NOT HAVING
A FAIR DEBATE HERE.
WE ARE NOT
DEBATING IDEAS THAT WOULD
ACTUALLY BENEFIT AMERICANS, WE
ARE DEBATING IDEAS THAT BENEFIT
ONE POLITICAL PARTY INSTEAD OF
AMERICANS AS A WHOLE.
>>BUT THAT GOES TO MY POINT, I
DON'T KNOW JOHN PHILLIPS, BUT MY
GUESS IS HE WAS PERFECTLY NICE
TO YOU BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT
YOU WERE PART OF US.
YOU WERE
HAVING A CORDIAL CONVERSATION
AND RELATIONSHIP AND HE'S LIKE,
OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO PUNCH THIS
PERSON IN THE FACE, SHE'S IN MY
CIRCLE, RIGHT?
BUT IF YOU ARE
OUTSIDE MY CIRCLE, AND I WILL
CALL YOU AN OTHER, I DON'T CARE.
AND HE'S WRONG.
DEMOCRATS WON'T
DO A DEAL WITH TRUMP BECAUSE
THEY ARE PART OF THE RESISTANCE?
HAVE YOU MET THE DEMOCRATS?
THOSE CORPORATE DEMOCRATS CAN'T
WAIT TO STRIKE A DEAL.
12 OF
THEM JUST COSPONSORED A BILL TO
TO DEREGULATE THE BANKS.
SO YES,
YOU WILL HAVE BIPARTISAN
AGREEMENT THE MINUTE YOU'RE
GOING TO HELP ALL THEIR DONORS.
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM
HERE IS, THE INFRA-STRUCTURE
BILL, SOME PORTIONS OF IT MIGHT
ACTUALLY HELP THEM IN BEINGS AND
NOT CORPORATE DONORS.
BUT BY THE
WAY DON'T BET ON IT, TRUMP'S
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IS MAINLY
MEANT TO PRIVATIZE ALL OF OUR
ROADS AND BRIDGES, ETC., SO YOU
PAY TOLLS AND TAXES ON THEM FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
