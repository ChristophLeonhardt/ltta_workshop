1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
listen I voted for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 party a lot of</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,000
times in my life and I know the feeling

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,650
it feels good when you walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,859
booth you feel kind of you know pure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,889
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-satisfied satisfied and</font>

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,300
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was in the booth</font>

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,280
pleasuring myself you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,070
like yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> voting for those</font>

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,420
other two I'm voting for dr. Jill Stein

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,890
because it's the right thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,670
it feels good but sometimes sometimes

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,590
you have to take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> medicine sometimes</font>

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to sacrifice sometimes you</font>

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,660
don't get to have your way sometimes

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,390
it's not all about you you should vote

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,129
your conscience I understand why if you

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,719
want to vote for a third party we need

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,059
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than two parties in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this country</font>

19
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,399
Canada has<font color="#E5E5E5"> five political parties right</font>

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,809
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think they need five</font>

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,910
parties to represent the broad spectrum

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,250
of political thought amongst 34 million

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,879
people we have 320 million people to

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,590
parties doesn't cut it we need three

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,750
four or five parties I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,969
toward a system like that we can't get

27
00:00:59,969 --> 00:00:00,000
