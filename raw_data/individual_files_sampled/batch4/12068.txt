even more accusers have come forward now to say that they were molested and assaulted by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a tearful interview given to CNN former media beauty queen the First Amendment told reporters quote I was sitting around minding my own business protecting people's god-given right to express their opinions when suddenly mrs. Clinton began manhandling me and roughing me up I seriously thought she was going to tear me to pieces this didn't happen just one time but over and over and now that I've come forward I have to tell you I fear for my life unquote the curvaceous blonde amendment went on to say quote I felt so ashamed about the way mrs. Clinton treated me that I didn't come forward right away but I think now that she's running for the highest office in the land I have to speak she was out of control and kept muttering something about how citizens united allowed people to broadcast a documentary criticizing her and she was going to make sure that never happened again and then she just kept mulling me unquote that accusation came just days after the Second Amendment came forward to the New York Times a former newspaper miss second accused mrs. Clinton of violently attacking her in public if she just wanted to rape me repeatedly miss second said I might have kept it to myself but I really think she's trying to kill me the way I understand it she wants rich powerful people like herself to be protected by guns but she wants to keep guns away from ordinary citizens because she's afraid they might protect me from people like her unquote mrs. Clinton has repeatedly denied the allegations of misconduct saying quote this is just a vast right-wing conspiracy like that whole thing about Bill having affairs and committing rape and me persecuting his accusers it's an old story and it's been covered and covered in it's time to move on I have nothing but respect for amendments in fact some of my best friends or amendments I'm telling the truth no really I am this isn't like all those other times really this is the truth this time no really unquote even as mrs. Clinton was making her denials however another accuser was coming forward in an emotional interview with Huffington Post the rule of law told reporters that mrs. Clinton had quote ruined my life unquote I used to be beautiful miss rule law said all the guys at the Justice Department and the FBI were crazy about me but now they've all turned against me to protect mrs. Clinton she abused me she raped me she sodomized me now look at me I'm a mess the interview ended with Miss rule of law sobbing helplessly while other accusers including the Fifth Amendment and the perjury laws have come forward to say mrs. Clinton abused them as well many journalists say their stories won't get much coverage New York Times editor blithering prevarication the third told meet the press stories about the Constitution are all well and good but here at the Times we're mostly just into tits and ass trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show hooray the clave endless weekend is over although I think for some time now the Cleveland's weekend is just going to extend every day even when I'm here it's like a Clavin last weekend it's even it's even raining in LA I mean in LA this is like you know when it rains in LA it's like you know water fall from magic place and sky we don't see this yeah normally we would sacrifice a virgin to make it stop but this is LA so you can't find one so the press the press the poor media is being picked on the media are being picked on since that's a plural they are being picked on they're being yelled at people think they're corrupt just because they're corrupt people think they're dishonest just because they're dishonest what is going on the New York Times ran this story at least is on the front page of my app I don't know if it's on the front page of the dead tree edition criticism of the news media takes on a more sinister tone this is getting day and here it starts it says it sure does get exhausting working for the global corporate media conspiracy har-har-har that's the lead the hours are horrible you never know what the puppet masters are going to order up next and there's no extra combat pay when at this point there clearly should be I probably shouldn't joke and yes Twitter that's what I'm doing the anger being directed at the news media has become dangerous enough that some news organizations are providing security for staff members covering Trump rallies someone's going to get hurt has become a common refrain in American newsrooms too bad it is too bad I mean that is that is a very very sad thing just for a bunch of lying corrupt people being run by corporate interests I mean I mean why would anybody turn to a bunch of lying corrupt journalists being run by corporate interests completely biased on one side of the political spectrum and call them completely biased corrupt news media you know Jersey here is from sharyl Attkisson who I always loved because she was one of the best investment broadcast investigative reporters in the country she was with CB she ran lots and lots of stories about bad things in the George W Bush administration Obama came in and her stories started to get killed so she was running stories about Benghazi about the fast and furious gun running stuff and they just would kill him they'd go up the line and suddenly middle management would kill her stories and so she had to quit and now she's operating on on her own as an independent I've heard her speak I didn't consider her particularly conservative she was not informed on conservative issues as far as I was concerned she just doesn't like powerful people and she wants to expose them which is what journalists are supposed to do instead of what they are doing here's shallow Ã¥kesson the following accounts come from human sources Freedom of Information Act documents and WikiLeaks email here is a list a partial list because I'm not gonna read the whole thing of the collusion between the mainstream media and our friends on the left the Democrat Party the State Department considered AP reporters Matt Lee and Bradley clapper friendlies and planned to place Hillary Clinton email stories with them and dictate the timing of their release that's the Associated Press mark am binder from the Atlantic asked a Hillary Clinton aide for advanced text of a speech the aide dictated conditions including one you and your own voice have to describe Hillary's words as muscular to which am binder agreed okay they told how to describe Hillary and binder formally worked for ABC CBS and National Journal CNBC anchor John Harwood who moderated a presidential debate between Trump and Clinton appears to have offered helpful thoughts and analyses to the Clinton campaign the Clinton campaign emailed that CNN politics producer Dan merica and Clinton were basically courting each other in an email Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile then a CNN contributor said she obtained an advanced presidential debate question and passed it on to the Hillary campaign brian Stelter at the new york times was now at CNN and we're going to come back to him he was helpful in publishing the media matters narrative a source tool Daily Caller Media Matters is the hit of the anti left the left wing hit organization New York Times reporter mark Leibovich gave Hillary Clinton the opportune to approve or veto her quotes he later explained that was because he agreed to make the original interview on the record and required her approval to use selected pieces of it staffers at Media Matters say they knew they could dump stuff to Ben Smith formerly of Politico now editor in chief at BuzzFeed according to Daily Caller Ben Smith this is a quote Ben Smith will take stories and write what you want him to write and finally Democratic National Committee officials discussed placing a story with the Washington Post greg sargent to put a positive spin on some bad news for Hillary Clinton gee and this annoys people on the right I know I can't understand it just be just because would be you know I want to start today with Ken Boone okay Ken bone Kim bone Kim dry bone okay ken bone you will remember is the guy who stood up and asked a question at the debate here is at the debate we have one more question from Ken bone about energy policy Ken what steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally-friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers Trumpton absolutely I think it's such a great question okay so something about the sweater the glasses the mustache the comb-over just he just looked like kind of this fuzzy sweet nice little guy which I'm sure he is right so Jimmy Kimmel becomes a star Jimmy Kimmel has more here he is with Kim joining us now from st. Louis on our big disco Scalia well I'm doing well and I'm very grateful for you to you for spending time with us tonight do you have any idea of how adorable you are first I want to say that's a definitive yes yes okay good so when I saw you last night I was immediately emailing our producers on the show to try to get you when did you find out that you'd suddenly become famous we weren't allowed to have our phones or any electronic devices with us so when I turned my phone back on when I got back to my car at about 10:15 central and I had a few thousand missed messages I started to think that maybe today was gonna be a long day did you know your fans are now calling themselves boneheads that's fantastic I've been calling my family that for years all right cute little story right little fuzzy guy gets up asks a question that he's talking about the environment and energy and stuff like this so it's like an actual question as opposed to who said what to whom and who's grabbing who by the what you know so everybody just went like they were all these funny Twitter's going you know the world can only be saved by the fuzzy red sweater of Ken bone and bones not a lot to take the sweater off whenever he appears to be on those red sweater okay then they start to look and he has a reddit account and he says at one point that the Trayvon Martin shooting was justified but George Zimmerman didn't seem like a very nice person that was not exactly the way he put it then press now starts to investigate this guy okay they start to investigate Ken bone and this the reason I'm bringing this up is because this is deeply deeply offensive and they find out on reddit he said he looked at Jennifer Lawrence's nude pictures let me tell you something there are two kinds of people didn't look at Jennifer Lawrence's nude pictures homosexuals and Liars those are the two okay because we all looked at Jennifer law not some not some not everybody but your husband all of us looked at Jennifer Lawrence's nude pictures and they were great they were terrific so he says he watches porn and he's happy he got a vasectomy because now he doesn't have to wear condom with his wife by the way you know the guy sleeping with you know by the way what happens if you say that porn should be censored what does the left say about you then then the left says oh who you're a Puritan you're a Christian you know horrible Nazi and then if you look at porn it's suddenly oh now we can expose you because you thought Trayvon Martin when he was slamming George Zimmerman's head against the curbstone deserved a bullet in the face you know I mean come on this is this is the guy isn't you're not allowed to have an opinion and what they say what they say is well now he found out what it's like to be famous that's not true what he found out is what it's like to be famous when you have an opinion that is not sanctioned by our Nazi press and the you know they're complaining about the fact that Trump's followers have swastikas and CNN and our friend John Nolte has his Twitter handle is CNN is Hitler which i think is hilarious but the thing is it's fascist to do this to an ordinary guy and don't tell me they did it to Joe the Plumber you know they did it to and they didn't do it to cindy sheehan remember Cindy she in the anti-war press protester who had lost who had lost a son overseas and Maureen Dowd said oh well she had absolute moral authority because she lost a son overseas and then when she started protesting the war and Obama was president she vanished she was on the front page and yeah they always have these excuses well it's summer we had nothing else to report so we're reporting on Cindy Sheen's protests they always have excuses for why they're biased to the left but they never need excuses for why they're biased to the right because they never are and the thing is let's go back for a minute to Joe the Plumber remember what happened to Joe the Plumber he got forward he came up to Obama and said how come I'm getting taxed more and Obama said I'm taxing people people over 250,000 dollars make over well let's watch it here it is my attitude is if the economy is good for folks from the bottom up it's gonna be good for everybody if you've got a plumbing business you're gonna be better off if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can't afford to hire you and right now everybody is so pinched that business is bad for everybody and and I think when you spread the wealth around so the exposed Obama for being a socialist which Obama is and so they investigated Joe the Plumber the guy's a he asked the question he stepped up and asked the question they do not do this to you if you're on the left it does not happen and the other thing about that I just want to reiterate because Hillary Clinton said the exact same thing at the debates over 250,000 I'm gonna tax you because that's where the money is let's let's play that clip haven't we got that I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know will have their taxes raised because I think we've got to go where the money is and the money is with people who've taken advantage of every single break in the tax code and yes when I was a senator I did vote to close corporate loopholes I voted to close I think one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars it's called the Buffett Rule yes Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary I want to have a surcharge on incomes above 5 million we have to make up for lost times because I want to invest in you ok here's the worst thing the president never does they never question the premises of the left they never question the premise of the left let's just think about this for a minute what she just said first I know this is this is an unpopular I have to say goodbye to Facebook because you know I wouldn't have to say goodbye if you would subscribe if you would subscribe you could come over the daily wire and watch the whole thing you cheap people come on subscribe and come over you
