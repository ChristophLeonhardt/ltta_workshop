00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,560
Welcome to Pandora. This planet featured
in the James Cameron film “Avatar”,

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,959
has been brought to life in a new section 
at Disney's Animal Kingdom

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,060
Across this beautiful bridge, which is 
all sort of hand-built

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,470
out of all this exotic 
Navi tribal material.

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,790
And as we make this transition, the 
habitat changes again.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,539
There are different kinds of plants
growing down here.

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,799
It takes that film's world of floating 
mountains and lush vegetation

8
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,739
and brings it to tactile life
for park visitors.

9
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,959
It's made up of many parts, but its 
sum leaves an overwhelming impression.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,769
We’re here up in the canyon below the
waterfalls looking out at

11
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:53,129
the floating mountains, 
which are over this way

12
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,709
suspended overhead, over the entire land.

13
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,679
The attention to detail is noticeable with
hand-carved rocks

14
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,050
and various species of plants invented 
for the world.

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,507
There's also a drum circle with 
instruments visitors can play.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,610
It becomes really really spectacular 
at night because all around us are

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,579
bioluminescent plants that illuminate, 
and not only do they illuminate,

18
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,929
but they're integrated to each other 
so that pulses and waves of light

19
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:28,069
can go through the entire land.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,710
We hope that people take away from 
our world of Pandora

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,630
the same underlying message they 
can take away from the film “Avatar”.

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,390
Which is our obligation to act 
with care and respect

23
00:01:45,390 --> 00:00:00,000
for the world of nature all around us.
