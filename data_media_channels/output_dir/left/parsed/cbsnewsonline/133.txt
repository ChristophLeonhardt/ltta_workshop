CHIANG RAI, TAKEN BY AMBULANCE.
NINE OTHER MEMBERS ARE IN THE
CAVE.
MORE RAIN IS IN THE FORECAST.
THIS IS THE START OF THE RAINY
SEASON IN THAILAND.
RESCUE CREWS SAY IT MAY TAKE UP
TO FOUR MORE DAYS TO GET
EVERYBODY OUT.
BEN TRACY IS IN CHIANG RAI,
JOINING US FROM THE HOSPITAL
WHERE THE BOYS WERE TAKEN.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR
CONDITION?
>> Reporter: THEY ARRIVED LATE
LAST NIGHT.
FOUR PEOPLE RESCUED.
ONE INTERESTING THING, WE ARE
READING ONE OF THE PEOPLE
RESCUED WOULD BE THE 25-YEAR-OLD
COACH, THREE RESCUED AND THE
COACH.
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD FOR DAYS NOW
THAT HE WAS IN PERHAPS THE WORST
SHAPE OF ANYONE INSIDE.
THAT'S BECAUSE EARLY ON IN THIS
ORDEAL, APPARENTLY HE GAVE THE
BOYS ALL THE FOOD AND WATER THAT
HE HAD ON HIM WHEN THEY FIRST
WENT INTO THE CAVE, BEFORE THEY
WERE FOUND BY THE RESCUERS.
SO HE APPARENTLY HAD BEEN
SUFFERING FROM MALNUTRITION AND
WAS NOT IN GOOD SHAPE.
SO THAT APPEARS THAT HE IS ONE
OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAS COME OUT.
IN TERMS OF THEIR CONDITION, THE
BOYS AND THE COACH WILL BE
EVALUATED AT THIS HOSPITAL FOR
THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE DAYS.
THIS IS ALSO WHERE THE YOUNG
BOYS WILL BE REUNITED WITH THEIR
FAMILIES BECAUSE WHEN THEY CAME
OUT OF THE CAVE, THERE WAS VERY
LITTLE TIME FROM THE MINUTE THEY
WALKED OUT OF THE CAVE, TO WHEN
THEY GOT OUT OF THOSE
HELICOPTERS WAS LESS THAN TWO
MINUTES.
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO SPEND MUCH TIME WITH
THEM.
THAT'LL HAPPEN AT THE HOSPITAL.
BROOK?
>> BEN, THE SECOND ATTEMPT IS
SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING OR
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT?
>> Reporter: SO THE OPERATION
BEGINS AGAIN THIS MORNING.
THEY WILL GO IN, TRY TO BRING
OUT ANOTHER GROUP OF BOYS FROM
THE CAVE.
THE REASON THERE IS A BIT OF LAG
IN THE TIME ON THIS OPERATION,
THEY TOLD US LAST NIGHT IT WOULD
BE ABOUT TEN TO 20 HOURS BEFORE
WE MIGHT SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF
BOYS EMERGE FROM THE CAVE.
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEY
BASICALLY HAVE TO GO BACK INTO
THIS CAPE AND REPLACE ALL THE
OXYGEN TANKS ALONG THE
EVACUATION ROUTE.
THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS IS AS
THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE CAVE,
THERE ARE CANISTERS
STRATEGICALLY PLACED, SO THEY
CAN REPLACE THEIR OXYGEN SO
THERE IS AMPLE OXYGEN IF THEY
HAVE TO STAY IN THERE FOR LONGER
TIME.
THEY HAD TO GO REPLACE THOSE,
THEN GET THE DIVERS ON THE LONG
YOUR HONOREE THAT TAKES ABOUT
SIX HOURS TO WHERE THE BOYS ARE.
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME TIME
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO
TO GET THEM OUT, AND THEN BEGIN
THE LONG JOURNEY BACK.
THIS IS WHY OFFICIALS HERE HAVE
SAID THIS MAY TAKE PLACE OVER
THE COURSE OF TWO TO FOUR DAYS.
IT'S A VERY LONG AND
LABOR-INTENSIVE PROCESS.
>> AND, BEN, IT LOOKS PRETTY
SUNNY THERE IN CHIANG RAI.
THIS IS THE START OF THE MONSOON
SEASON.
THE WEATHER REPORT ISN'T GREAT
BUT HOW HAS THE WEATHER BEFORE
SO FAR THE SUN HAS BEEN UP?
>> Reporter: SO IT'S JUST KIND
OF CLOUDY.
YOU LOOK IN THE DISTANCE AND YOU
SEE SOME CLOUDS THAT LOOK LIKE
WE MAY HAVE RAIN TODAY.
IT'S RARE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR
TO HAVE A DAY WHERE YOU DON'T
HAVE RAIN.
THEY DID GET LUCKY FOR ABOUT
THREE DAYS IN A ROW.
IT WAS ABNORMALLY DRY HERE,
WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE TAKEN
THIS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO
TRY TO GET THESE BOYS OUT OF THE
CAVE, BUT AS YOU SAY, THOSE
MONSOON RAINS ARE BACK.
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS WE'VE HAD
SEVERAL DOWNPOURS.
WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ISF
SUSTAINED MONSOON RAIN, THOSE
WOULD LIKELY FLOOD THE CAVE
AGAIN AND IF YOU FLOOD THE CAVE
AGAIN YOU CUT OFF THE RESCUERS'
ACCESS TO THESE BOYS.
THEY COULD BE STRANDED AND THE
VERY SMALL PIECE OF REAL ESTATE
THEY'RE CURRENTLY ON COULD GET
SMALLER AS THOSE FLOODWATERS
RISE, SO THEY FEEL THIS IS A
RACE AGAINST TIME AND THE
WEATHER ASK THEY'RE HOPING TODAY
THEY WILL HAVE AT LEAST FOUR
MORE OUT, WHICH WOULD MEAN THEY
HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE
PEOPLE WHO WERE STRANDED THERE
IN THE CAVE FREE.
BROOK?
>> AND BEST YOU CAN DESCRIBE
THAT REAL ESTATE, IT'S A LONG
WAY, IT'S NOT WET THE WHOLE WAY
DOWN WITH THIS LEVEL OF WATER.
THERE COULD BE MORE WATER
POURING IN THAT WOULD MAKE THE
DIVE HARDER.
HOW DO WE -- HOW SHOULD WE
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT SPACE LOOK?
>> Reporter: YEAH, SO WHAT WE'RE
TOLD IS THEY FOUND THIS DRY,
KIND OF ELEVATED PIECE OF LAND
WHERE THEY HAD BEEN HUDDLED FOR
16 DAYS NOW ESSENTIALLY.
ONCE THEY BEGIN THE JOURNEY OUT
OF THE CAVE, OUR UNDERSTANDING
IS THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE
FLOODED AND IT'S USUALLY THOSE
NARROW PASSAGE WAYS.
IMAGINE IF YOU'RE WALKING IN A
CAVE OR GOING ON A HIKE AND YOU
GO UP A STEEP INCLINE AND A
DECLINE, NOW IMAGINE IN THAT'S
INSIDE A CAVE WHERE YOU HAVE
ROCK ABOVE YOU AND FILL IT ALL
UP WITH WATER, THAT IS BASICALLY
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SWIM
THROUGH TO GET OUT OF THIS CAVE.
BUT WE ARE TOLD THAT ONCE THEY
GET TO A CERTAIN POINT IT'S
PRETTY MUCH DRY LAND FROM THERE
AND THEY CAN WALK MUCH OF THE
WAY AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY
HAVE PUMPED SO MUCH WATER OUT OF
THIS CAVE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.
UPWARDS OF 35 MILLION GALLONS OF
WATER.
SO CERTAINLY THOSE EFFORTS HAVE
PAID OFF.
THAT'S PART OF WHY WE ALSO SAW
YESTERDAY THIS FIRST RESCUE
OPERATION WENT MUCH QUICKER THAN
THEY TOLD US IT WOULD.
WE SAW THE FIRST TWO BOYS COME
OUT IN LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS.
THEY'RE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND
HOPING TO REPEAT THAT AGAIN
TODAY, BUT OBVIOUSLY A LOT CAN
STILL GO WRONG SO THERE IS A LOT
TO FOCUS ON.
>> BEN TRACY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'LL BE WATCHING YOUR REPORTS
IN HOURS AHEAD CBS MONDAY
MORNING.
THANK YOU, BEN.
>> I WANT TO BRING IN DAVE
SEARS, HE JOINS US NOW BY PHONE,
FROM WASHINGTON, A FORMER NAVY
SEAL.
WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THE SITUATION
IS THERE, AND WHAT THE CAVE IS
LIKE, WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST
CONCERNS, THE BIGGEST THREATS IN
YOUR HEAD?
>> Reporter: REALLY, IT'S GOING
TO BE BEATING THE RAINS.
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT
UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE
CONDITIONS YOU CAN AND I BELIEVE
THE REASON THEY'RE ABLE TO MOVE
THESE KIDS OUT IS BECAUSE A LOT
OF THE JOURNEY TREKKED THROUGH
THE CAVE IS ABOVE WATER AND THEY
DON'T HAVE TO DIVE THE WHOLE
THING, SO THEY'RE EITHER WADING
THEM AND FLOATING THEM AND
THEY'RE ABLE TO WALK LARGE
PORTIONS IF THAT CAVE GETS
FLOODED UP AGAIN WITH THE RAINS,
THEN YOU'RE TALKING TOTAL DIVE
TO GET THEM OUT, WHICH IS JUST
ALMOST UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THE
KIDS.
IT TOOK SIX HOURS FOR
EXPERIENCED DIVERS TO KNOCK IT
OUT.
>> PRETTY CONSIDERABLE BREAK
BETWEEN THE LAST RESCUES, WHICH
WERE COMPLETED NOW, WHAT,
14 HOURS AGO.
TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE CREWS
WOULD BE DOING IN THESE
INTERVENING HOURS?
OBVIOUSLY THEY WANT TO DO THIS
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.
WHY DO THEY NEED THIS TIME?
>> THEY NEED THIS TIME TO
REPLENISH THE OXYGEN OR
COMPRESSED AIR TANKS OR WHATEVER
THEY HAPPEN TO BE USING TO GET
AIR UNDER WATER AND IN THE CAVE.
SO IMAGINE, THIS IS OVER 2 1/2
MILES OF CAVE THEY HAVE TO GO
THROUGH AND THERE ARE CERTAIN
PORTIONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO DIVE
DOWN SO THEY'RE GOING TO NEED
THAT SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN OR
SUPPLEMENTAL AIR AND THEY'VE
UTILIZED THAT.
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE RESCUERS
COMING IN, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE
TANKS COMING IN, AIR CUBIC FOOT
TANKS.
THEY HAVE TO NOT ONLY BRING IN
THEIR OWN IN ORDER TO DIVE, BUT
THEY HAVE TO CARRY IN SPARES SO
THEY CAN HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL
OXYGEN FOR THE KIDS THAT ARE
COMING OUT.
SO THEY HAVE TO REDO THAT ENTIRE
2 1/2 MILES OF CAVE SYSTEM WITH
ALL THESE SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN
PLACE.
SO THAT'S ALL BEEN UTAH LIESED
TO GET FOUR OUT.
THEY'LL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE
ANOTHER BREAK TO REPLENISH THAT
STOCK AGAIN.
-- UTILIZED TO GET FOUR OUT.
THEY'LL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE
ANOTHER BREAK TO GET THEM OUT.
>> WE'VE SEEN THE BOYS 11 TO 16
AND THEY AREN'T IN GREAT
PHYSICAL CONDITION AND MANY OR
MOST OF THEM CANNOT SWIM OR SWIM
WELL.
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS VERY
TREACHEROUS DIVE, GRANTED WITH
THE SUPPORT OF TWO EXPERT
DIVERS, BUT IF YOU ARE ONE OF
THOSE EXPERT DIVERS TRYING TO
HELP THESE VERY NOVICE DIVERS,
SWIMMERS THROUGH THIS, WHAT ARE
YOUR MAIN CONCERNS?
WHAT DO YOU TRY TO DO TO HELP
THAT SITUATION?
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT WHAT SEEMS
LIKE A VERY CHALLENGING FIRST
DIVE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER
PUT ON A SCUBA MASK?
>> YOUR BIGGEST FIRST CONCERN IS
YOU HAVE CONSTANT AIR, RIHT?
THAT'S THE LARGEST ONE WE WANT
TO WORRY ABOUT.
SO THAT'S MITIGATED SOMEWHAT BY
THIS FULL FACE MASK THEY'RE
GOING TO WEAR AND THEY CAN'T
ESSENTIALLY -- IT'S VERY
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF
OR BE INADVERTENTLY HIT OR A
MISTAKE COMES AGAINST SOMETHING
THAT COMES OUT LIKE A NORMAL
MOUTH PIECE SOMETHING MIGHT.
THAT FACE MASK WILL KEEP THEM
AIR.
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ON
THEM AS AIR.
THE SWIMMING PART YOU COULD USE
DIFFERENT PIECES AND LIFE
JACKETS AND INFLATE AND DEFLATE
AND HELP PUSH THE KIDS ALONG OR
LET THEM WALK ON THE BOTTOM.
YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS MAKING
SURE THEY HAVE AIR THE ENTIRE
TIME AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
YOU'RE READY FOR THE CONTINGENCY
IF THEY USE IT, IF THEY -- AIR
SUPPLY HOSE GETS CUT ON A ROCK
YOU'RE RED TO REACT TO THAT.
YOU ONLY HAVE LESS THAN A MINUTE
WITHOUT AIR FOR MOST OF THESE
KIDS IS GOING TO PUT THEM
UNCONSCIOUS.
SO YOU HAVE TO REACT QUICKLY,
BUT CALMLY AND MOVE THEM THROUGH
THE CAVE SYSTEM.
>> OKAY.
FORMER NAVY SEAL, DAVE SEARS,
JOINING US, THANK YOU, DAVE.
BBC REPORTER JONATHAN HEAD HAS
BEEN FOLLOWING THE RESCUE AND
THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES SOLVED IN
THE MISSION.
>> Reporter: IT BEGAN WITH MORE
DIVERS AND AIR TANKS GOING IN
AND ALL OTHER NONESSENTIAL
VEHICLES BEING SENT OUT.
A DARING AND COMPLEX RESCUE WAS
UNDERWAY.
THE GOVERNOR WHO COMMANDS THE
OPERATION DESCRIBED IT AS D-DAY.
CONDITIONS WILL NEVER BE BETTER,
HE SAID.
AFTER THAT DRAMATIC DISCOVERY ON
MONDAY, THE BOYS HAVE BEEN FED
AND TREATED BY AN ARMY MEDIC ON
THE ROCK SHELF WHERE THEY'D BEEN
FORCED TO RETREAT BY RISING
WATER.
THEY WERE JUDGED FIT ENOUGH TO
MAKE THE JOURNEY, THOUGH NONE
HAS EVER DIVED BEFORE.
IT INVOLVES TWO DIVERS SWIMMING
WITH EACH CHILD WHO IS TETHERED
TO THE CHILD IN FRONT AND FOLLOW
A GUIDE ROPE TO HELP WITH
DIFFICULT RAIN AND POOR
VISIBILITY.
THE NARROWEST PART OF THE ROUTE
IS LESS THAN 40 CENTIMETERS
WIDE.
THE BOYS ARE HELPED THROUGH BY
THE DIVER IN FRONT BEFORE
RESTING ON A ROCKY OUT CROP AND
CONTINUING.
AS THE LIGHT OUTSIDE FADED, THE
SIGHT OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND THE
SOUND OF HELICOPTERS TOLD US AT
LEAST SOME OF THEM WERE OUT.
THEY WERE THEN FLOWN TO THE CITY
OF CHIANG RAI.
>> THIS IS WHAT ALL OF THOSE
HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE.
WE SAW TWO AMBULANCES GO INTO
THIS HOSPITAL EARLIER.
THAT'S ANOTHER.
THE BOYS ARE COMING OUT.
>> Reporter: THEN THE GOVERNOR
MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
AFTER 16 DAYS OF WAITING, TODAY
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE FACES OF
THE WILD BOARS, HE SAID, TO
CHEERING JOURNALISTS REFERRING
TO THE ANYMORE MAKE THAT OF THE
BOYS FOOTBALL TEAM.
THE FOUR WHO WERE BROUGHT OUT
TODAY WERE DESCRIBED BY ONE
RESCUER AS DOING REMARKABLY
WELL.
THEY HOPED TO GET THE REMAINING
NINE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
>> OKAY.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE ON
THE SITUATION FROM THAILAND
RESCUE EFFORTS STILL UNDERWAY.
FOR NOW A SHORT BREAK.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
>>> 600 MILES ON FOOT THROUGH TO
THE SOUTH POLE ITSELF.
WE ARE GOING TO SURVIVE ONLY ON
RENEWABLE ENERGY.
IT'S AN ACT OF TAKING THE
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CALL TO
ACTION IN RELATION TO CLIMATE,
IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
I'M TAKING A FEARFUL BATTERING
TODAY FOR ALL SIDES.
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH PAIN
THAT MAN IS IN.
>> ALL IT TAKES IS THAT ONE
DEGREE TOO FAR AND YOU CAN DIE.
>> IF WE COULD SURVIVE OUT THERE
ONLY ON RENEWABLE IN THE HOSTILE
PLACE, PEOPLE CAN MAKE A
DIFFERENCE.
>> RESCUE DIVERS IN THAILAND ARE
GETTING BACK IN THE WATER.
IT'S MONDAY MORNING ALREADY IN
THAILAND AND THEY'RE HOPING TO
RESCUE MORE MEMBERS OF THAT THAI
SOCCER TEAM STUCK IN A CAVE FOR
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.
ALREADY FOUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN
RESCUED.
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT MISSION
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
WE WANT TO DISCUSS IT BRENT WHO
JOINS US FROM GASTONIA, NORTH
CAROLINA, THE PRESIDENT OF SINK
OR SWIM SCUBA.
EACH OF THESE YOUNG MEN IS BEING
ASSISTED BY TWO DIVERS AS THEY
GO THROUGH THIS VERY NARROW CAVE
AND I'VE BEEN CURIOUS WHETHER
THIS IS KIND OF AN ESTABLISHED
RESCUE TECHNIQUE OR SOUNDS LIKE
AD HOC RESCUE MISSION THE
RESCUERS CAME UP WITH.
>> I BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE AN AD
HOC TECHNIQUE.
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD SET
A PRECEDENT.
ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED
BEFORE THEY WOULD NEED A
TECHNIQUE.
>> WHAT ARE THE MAIN CONCERNS
AND ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
DEAL WITH TO GET THROUGH IT
SAFELY?
>> Caller: AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
THE CONDITIONS ARE VERY
DIFFICULT.
THEY'RE STRONG CURRENTS, LIMITED
VISIBILITY, AS WELL AS KIDS WHO
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DIVE SO THAT
WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CONCERNS IS EVEN IN GREAT
CONDITIONS THESE CHILDREN DON'T
KNOW HOW TO DIVE AND SOME OF
THEM DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM AND
YOU'RE TAKING THEM DEEP INTO
THESE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE
DIFFICULT FOR A KIND OF DIVERER
THAT HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL THE
PROPER TRAINING.
>>> I SUSPECT THE ANSWER IS
GOING TO BE BOTH, BUT HOW MUCH
WOULD YOU BE CONCERND THEY
CAN'T SWIM THERE AND HOW MUCH
WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED THEY'RE
PUTTING A REGULATOR OVER THEIR
FACE, DIVING, ANY OF THAT?
>> I THINK BOTH.
THERE IS JUST NOTHING EASY ABOUT
THIS AT ALL.
WITH PLENTY OF TIME I THINK IT
WOULD BE A GOOD BIT EASIER TO DO
BUT STILL THE CONDITIONS ARE
JUST DIFFICULT AND THE KIDS JUST
HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WHATSOEVER.
>> LOTS OF FOLKS MAYBE WOULD
HAVE DONE A PLEASURE DIVE OFF A
BOAT IN HAWAII, OR CANCUN OR
SOMETHING, BUT FEW OF US HAVE
BEEN THROUGH A NARROW CAVE DIVE
SITUATION LIKE THIS.
EXPLAIN FOR EVEN THOSE OF US WHO
MAYBE HAVE SCUBA DOVE, WHAT THE
PARTICULAR CHALLENGES ARE?
>> MOST DIVERS ARE CALLED
OPEN-WATER DIVERS.
THEY CAN MAKE A DIRECT DESCENT
TO THE SURFACE AT ANY TIME.
FOR THE CAVE CONDITIONS YOU
CAN'T NECESSARILY COME UP.
YOU CAN'T RAISE YOUR HEAD UP AND
START OVER.
YOU'RE IN THE -- YOU'RE IN THE
CAVE UNTIL YOU'RE RUBBING YOUR
STOMACH AND BUMPING WHATEVER
ELSE.
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE KIDS
CAN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TANKS ON
THEIR BACK.
THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TANKS OFF,
PUSHING THEM AHEAD, OR THEIR
RESCUERS ARE DOING THAT FOR
THEM.
>> ONE OF THE DIVERS IS CARRYING
THE TANK.
>> RIGHT AND THAT JUST SOUNDS
DIFFICULT BECAUSE EVERYTHING
JUST HAS TO GO PERFECTLY RIGHT
FOR THESE KIDS TO COME OUT SAFE
IF ARE THIS.
>> LUCKILY WE'RE ALREADY 4 FOR
4, SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS, BUT WE
UNDERSTAND THERE COULD BE RAIN
TODAY.
HOW MUCH COULD RAIN BE A FACTOR?
IT COULD INCREASE THE RAIN
LEVEL, BUT IN TERMS OF
VISIBILITY, IS RAIN A CONCERN?
>> IT IS.
IN ADDITION TO BEING MORE WATER
THERE, THERE IS GOING TO BE
CURRENT.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE DIVING IN A
CONVEYOR BELT WHERE YOU'RE --
WHERE THE FLOW IS CONSTANTLY
MOVING AT YOU AND YOU HAVE TO
CONTEND WITH FIGHTING THIS FLOW
OR THIS CURRENT TO GET THROUGH
IT.
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN AND EXTRA
RAIN AND FLOW WILL STIR THE
VISIBILITY UP.
IF THEY HAVE ANY VISIBILITY AT
ALL IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
BE BETTER FOR ANY STORM RAIN
COMING IN.
>> ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR NOVICE
DIVERS IS THEY JUST GET NERVOUS
UNDER WATER, THEY BREATHE MORE
HEAVILY AND GO THROUGH THEIR
OXYGEN TANK MORE QUICKLY.
WE KNOW THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT
HOW MUCH OXYGEN THEY CAN GET IN
THIS VERY LONG RUN.
THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
GETTING THE TANKS IN THERE.
WOULD THIS BE A BIG CONCERN FOR
YOU HOW THESE INEXPERIENCED
DIVERS COULD CHEW THROUGH THEIR
TANKS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AN EXPERIENCED DIVER HAS A
PRETTY GOOD IDEA HOW MUCH OXYGEN
AND HOW LONG HIS AIR WILL LAST.
THESE KIDS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
FAST THE AIR WILL LAST AND HOW
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM.
IT'S A DIFFICULT SCENARIO AND
IT'S A LONG WAY BACK FROM THE
SURFACE.
A NORMAL DIVER THEY CAN RAISE
THEIR HEAD, TAKE THEIR REGULATOR
OUT OF THEIR MOUTH AND CALM
DOWN.
THIS ISN'T A POSSIBILITY FOR
THESE KIDS RIGHT NOW.
>> AND WHAT'S THE TALK YOU GIVE
TO SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN UNDER
WATER BEFORE AND IS DOING IT FOR
FIRST TIME AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
GIVE THEM BOTH ADVICE AND
CONFIDENCE.
I'M SURE YOU'VE GIVEN THAT TALK.
WHT IS THAT TALK?
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE OF
SCUBA DIVING IS TO NEVER HOLD
YOUR BREATH AND I TELL PEOPLE
HOWEVER OLD YOU ARE, IF YOU'RE
30 YEARS OLD TO TEN YEARS OLD,
YOU HAVE 15 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
THAT SAYS I CAN'T BREATHE UNDER
WATER AND NOW YOU'VE MET ME FOR
A DAY, A WEEK, A MONTH AND I'M
SAYING AS SOON AS YOU PUT YOUR
HEAD UNDER WATER, THE MOST
DANGEROUS THING YOU CAN DO IS
HOLD YOUR BREATH.
THE BIGGEST PART OF SCUBA DIVING
THAT INJURIES PEOPLE IS PANIC.
AS LONG AS YOU STAY CALM UNDER
WATER YOU CAN USUALLY SORT
THROUGH MOST PROBLEMS.
IF YOU PANIC YOU NO LONGER THINK
RATIONALLY AND THAT'S GOING TO
CAUSE PROBLEMS.
>> THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THE
OXYGEN CHAMBER IS DOWN TO 15%,
THE NORMAL AIR IS 21%, DOCTORS
SAY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
COMPROMISE D IS THINKING.
THAT SAID, THEY'RE 4 FOR 4.
AS YOU HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT
THIS AND HEARING ABOUT THIS,
WHAT HAS STRUCK YOU ABOUT THE
MISSION, ABOUT THE CHALLENGE AND
THE WAY THEY'RE GOING THROUGH
THIS?
>> I THINK THEY'RE SETTING NEW
GROUND BY DOING THIS.
I THINK THEY'RE IN A BIT OF A
RACE AGAINST TIME, OR AT LEAST A
RACE AGAINST THE WEATHER, BUT
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD IN MY
OPINION, THEY HAVE GOT FOUR OUT,
NOW THEY NEED TO HURRY AND GET
THE REST OUT.
I'VE ALSO SEEN THEY TOOK THE
NIGHT OFF TO REFILL AIR TANKS
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW GOOD
THEIR SUPPORT IS THEY DO HAVE TO
TAKE THE TIME OFF, IF THEY CAN'T
IMMEDIATELY TURN OVER TANKS AND
KEEP GOING WITH THIS.
>> OKAY.
BRENT CLEVENGER, PRESIDENT OF
SINK OR SWIM SCUBA, JOINING US
BY PHONE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHTS.
>> YES, SIR, THANK YOU.
>>> WE'RE GOING DATE TO BE
COVERING
THIS ALL EVENING.
WE UNDERSTAND THIS SECOND GROUP
OF DIVERS IS ABOUT TO GO OR HAS
GO RECENTLY INTO THE CAVE.
WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH THE
DETAILS AS WE GET THEM.
YOU'RE WATCHING CBSN, ALWAYS ON.
>>> AT THIS HOUR, DIVERS ARE
PREPARING THE SECOND PHASE OF
THEIR RESCUE IN THAILAND.
THOSE RESCUERS DIVERS REMOVED
FOUR PEOPLE SUCCESSFULLY FROM
THE CAVE.
THE MISSION WAS PUT ON HOLD
THOUGH FOR THE LAST HALF A DAY
BECAUSE OF LOW OXYGEN LEVELS IN
THE DIVERS' TANKS, OR NOT ENOUGH
OXYGEN TANKS ALONG THE CAVE
ROUTE.
THE TEAM OF DIVERS HAS TO GO
THROUGH MILES OF TUNNELS JUST TO
REACH THE BOYS.
MUCH OF IT UNDER WATER AND OF
COURSE BRING THEM BACK.
MEG OLIVER SPOKE TO OFFICIALS
ABOUT THE DANGEROUS JOURNEY.
>> Reporter: IN THAILAND,
RESCUERS ARE GEARING UP FOR THE
NEXT PHASE OF THEIR EFFORT TO
FREE A YOUTH SOCCER TEAM TRAPPED
IN A FLOODED MOUNTAIN CAVE.
ON SUNDAY, DIVERS OF COURSE OR
THE ON 4 OF THE 12 BOYS BACK TO
SURFACE, A 2 1/2 MILE JOURNEY
THROUGH A SERIES OF DARK AND
FLOODED TUNNELS.
>> YOU CAN'T MAKE A HORROR MOVIE
THAT WOULD COMPARE AND I'VE BEEN
INVOLVED IN CAVE RESCUE FOR
30 YEARS AND I CANNOT EVEN THINK
OF ONE THAT WAS THIS
COMPLICATED.
>> Reporter: AFTER THE FOUR
EMERGED FROM THE CAVE THEY WERE
RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL IN
AMBULANCES.
OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF THE
OPERATION SAID THEY'RE HOPING TO
BRING ANOTHER GROUP OF BOYS OUT
BY MONDAY OR TUESDAY.
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS, IS THAT
FIRST PHASE WAS SUCCESSFUL.
THEY'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
SHOW IT WORKS.
IT'S STILL DANGEROUS, BUT MUCH
BETTER ODDS FOR THE REMAININGúKF
THOSE INITIAL ONES.
>> BEFORE THEY ATTEMPT ANOTHER
RESCUE, THE DIVE TEAMS HAVE TO
REFILL THEIR OXYGEN TANKS AND
REPLENISH THE SUPPLIES ALONG THE
ROUTE INSIDE THE CAVE.
>> Reporter: AFTER PUMPING OUT
WATER FOR DAYS, EXPERTS SAY THE
WINDOW TO RESCUE THE BOYS IS
CLOSING AND IT IS NOW OR NEVER.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EVERYONE
COULD BE RESCUED WITHIN
48 HOURS.
BROOK?
>> MEG OLIVER, THANKS.
JOINING ME ON THE PHONE IS OUR
CHIEF METEOROLOGIST AT WFOR, AND
CRAIG, MIAMI IS A PLACE THAT
KNOWS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF FLASH
FLOODING.
WE SEE THE SITUATION NOW IN
THAILAND WHERE HEAVY RAIN COULD
RAPIDLY CHANGE THE CONDITIONS
THERE.
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT
LOOKS LIKE WHEN THESE HEAVY
RAINS AND FLASH FLOODS HIT?
>> Caller: THE SITUATION IS
SIMILAR IN THE ASPECT THAT
FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY SOUTH
FLORIDA, HAS A RAINY SEASON.
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND
THE SOUTHWEST U.S. IS CALLED A
MONSOON SEASON WHERE THE SUMMER
RAINS COME IN.
WE SEE THAT TYPICALLY COLORADO
THROUGH ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO,
ESPECIALLY THE LOWER ATTITUDE,
SUCH AS THAILAND WHERE THEY GET
A RAINY SEASON AND A DRY SEASON
AND THEIR RAINY SEASON,
SIMILARLY LASTS ALMOST AS LONG
AS MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN U.S.'S
RAINY SEASON, TYPICALLY FROM MAY
OR JUNE THROUGH OCTOBER AND
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S
GOING TO RAIN EVERY SINGLE DAY,
BUT THE CHANCES OF IT RAINING ON
A DAY ARE GREATER THAN IT NOT
RAINING ON A DAY.
WHEN THEY HAVE THESE WINDOWS
LIKE NOW IN THAILAND THEY'VE GOT
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND THE
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS IS
I'M SURE YOU'VE DISCUSSED IT, AS
WE'VE BEEN GOING HERE, IS WATER
LEVELS, THESE CAVES WHICH WERE
FORMED BY WATER FLOWING, THE
WATER IS GOING TO COME UP AND 2
1/2 MILES IN OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY
LONG JOURNEY, EVEN IN DRY
CONDITIONS.
IT'S ESPECIALLY CRITICAL HERE.
I THINK THEY'RE WISE IN NOT
WAITING UNTIL THE END OF RAINY
SEASON BECAUSE THAT WAS SUCH A
RIDICULOUSLY LONG TIME INTO
OCTOBER.
>> AND WE'RE TOWARD THE
BEGINNING OF THE RAINY SEASON A
FEW WEEKS IN ANY WAY, AND IS IT
KIND OF LIKE A CURVE, IN OTHER
WORDS WOULD IT GET A BIT WORSE
OR NOT NECESSARILY?
>> SO IT KIND OF DEPENDS.
TYPICALLY IN RAINY SEASON, THE
BEGINNING OF RAINY SEASON IT'S A
LITTLE BIT WETTER SIMPLY BECAUSE
THE ATMOSPHERE IS STILL COOLER
HIGHER UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE,
WHICH RESULTS IN WHAT WE CALL
INSTABILITY,O USUALLY THE
BEGINNING OR FIRST COUPLE WEEKS
OR MONTHS OF RAINY SEASON ARE
MORE PROLIFIC.
RAIN PRODUCTION IS QUITE A BIT
HIGHER AND THE ATMOSPHERE WARMS
AND BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MORE
STABLE.
IT TAPERS OFF A BIT.
YOU STILL GET THE OCCASIONAL
SHOWERS IN THE RAINY SEASON OR
MONSOONAL PATTERN BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE THE REALLY HEAVY DOWNPOURS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE IN THE SOUTHWEST
U.S. WHERE THE MONSOON SEASON,
WHICH COMES ON STRONG THERE,
MOISTURE FROM THE GULF MAKES IT
UP THROUGH THE RIO GRANDE AND
SPECIFIC MOISTURE COMES IN AND
IS DRAWN IN FROM THE WARMTH OF
THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND YOU GET
THESE VERY HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS
AND FLASH FLOODING THERE AND OF
COURSE IN THE SOUTHWEST U.S.,
YOU HAVE VALLEYS, LITTLE VALLEYS
OR WATERS OF WATER WILL
LITERALLY TEAR DOWN THROUGH A
VALLEY AND HIGH HIKE ER --
HIKERS AND
CAMPERS HAVE TO BE AWARE OF
THAT.
>> IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD,
ARE THERE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
AREAS DURING THE PART OF THE
CALENDAR, AND WHAT WAS OR WASN'T
DONE IN THIS CASE IN THAILAND?
>> Caller: MOST MODERN
CIVILIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES HAVE
SOME TYPE OF WARNIN SYSTEM AND
I THINK IT'S A TWO-SIDED
QUESTION BECAUSE ONE IS THAT THE
WARNINGS GO OUT, BUT DO PEOPLE
GET THE WARNING OR HEED THE
WARNING?
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CONSIDER
IF I WAS GOING CAVING IF IT
RAINING -- OR SPELUNKING, IN
EVEN THINKING THE CAVE WOULD BE
CUT OFF OR FILLED WITH WATER.
>> WHAT ARE ELSE ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT THE WEATHER
CONDITIONS, THE CONDITIONS THE
DIVERS AND KIDS ARE IN FROM A
WEATHER PERSPECTIVE?
>> Reporter: I THINK THE CONCERN
WOULD BE IF THE RAINS COME IT
AGAIN AND WHEN THEY COME AGAIN
IS THERE IS GOING TO BE CURRENT
AND OF COURSE ANY TIME ANYBODY
THAT DOES ANY SCUBA DIVING KNOWS
HOW JUST -- HOW INCREDIBLY
STRONG EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF
CURRENT CAN BE, QUICKLY EXHAUSTS
YOU, SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE A
CONSIDERATION GOING THROUGH THE
CAVE AND IT'S JUST A WAKE-UP
CALL IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO IS
AN AVID OUT DOORS MAN, ANYWHERE
IN THE COUNTRY OF THE WORLD AND
YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE
THERE ARE HEAVY RAINS AND THINGS
LIKE THAT, THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE
TO BE AWARE OF.
I'VE HEARD OF CASES WHERE KIDS
GO UP STORM DRAINS RATHER LARGE
STORM DRAINS AND THEN A FLASH
FLOOD OR A WALL OF WATER WILL
COME THROUGH AND UNFORTUNATELY
IN THAT CASE THERE IS A LOSS OF
LIFE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND IT HAPPENS ALL OVER ALL THE
TIME.
CRAIG SETZER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
INSIGHTS TONIGHT.
>> Caller: THANK YOU.
>>> MUCH MORE IN OUR COVERAGE IN
THE SITUATION IN THAILAND.
RESCUE EFFORTS STILL UNDERWAY.
FOR NOW A SHORT BREAK.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
>>> WE ARE FOLLOWING THE LATEST
OUT OF THAILAND WHERE EIGHT BOYS
AND THEIR SOCCER COACH ARE STILL
WAITING FOR RESCUE FROM A
FLOODED CAVE.
FOUR OF THEIR TEAMMATES HAVE
BEEN RESCUED, AND INTERNATIONAL
TEAM OF SKILLED DIVERS BROUGHT
THEM THROUGH SAFETY THROUGH
NARROW, SUBMERGED PASSAGE WAYS.
NICK BEAK HAS THE LATEST.
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE MAIN
HOSPITAL IN THE CHIANG RAI
REASON AND THE DOCTORS AND
NURSES WERE READY AND THEY WERE
WAITING FOR THEIR PATIENTS TO
ARRIVE.
WE SAW AN AMBULANCE RACE THROUGH
STRAIGHT TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE.
A SHORT TIME LATER ANOTHER
AMBULANCE, AS WELL.
WE ALSO HEARD TWO HELICOPTERS
OVERHEAD AND TWO OTHER BOYS WERE
BROUGHT TO THE DOCTORS AND
NURSES WHO WERE NOW TREATING
THEM VIA ANOTHER ENTRANCE AT
THIS PARTICULAR PLACE.
NOW WE KNOW MEDICAL TEAMS HAD
BEEN ASSESSING THEM FOR THE PAST
WEEK OR SO.
THERE WAS A DOCTOR IN THE CAVE
FROM THE MOMENT THEY WERE
DISCOVERED BY THOSE AMATEUR
BRITISH DIVERS AT THE START OF
LAST WEEK.
THEY DECIDED THE BOYS WERE
STRONG ENOUGH TO TRY AND EMBARK
ON SOME SORT OF RESCUE ATTEMPT
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE.
WE BELIEVE, ACCORDING TO PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE
PLANNING AND THE EXECUTION OF
THIS RESCUE ATTEMPT, THEY
BELIEVE THE BOYS ARE DOING WELL
CONSIDERING WHAT THEY'VE BEEN
THROUGH.
BECUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE
ROUTE THEY HAVE TO TAKE,
11 HOURS IN TOTAL FOR THE MOST
EXPERIENCED DIVERS IN THE WORLD
TO TRY AND NEGOTIATE THEIR WAY
THROUGH SOME EXTREMELY NARROW
PASSAGEWAYS.
THE HOPE HERE IN THAILAND IS
TOMORROW MORE OF THEIR FELLOW
FOOTBALL TEAM WILL BE BROUGHT
OUT ALIVE AND WELL AND IF THAT
IS THE CASE, PEOPLE HERE WILL BE
REJOICING.
>> EARLIER I SPOKE WITH ED
SORENSON, SAFETY OFFICER AT THE
NATIONAL THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
ABOUT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES
AHEAD FACING THE RESCUERS.
>> Caller: THERE IS ALSO
OBSTACLES FACING ANY KIND OF
RESCUE OPERATION LIKE THIS.
THEY'VE GOT THE PERFECT STORM
FOR EVERYTHING YOU COULD THROW
AT THIS.
JUST BEING IN AN OVERHEAD IS
INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL FOR MOST
PEOPLE IN A WATER-FILLED
ENVIRONMENT.
THE WATER IN ITSELF IS A SERIOUS
THREAT FOR THESE -- IN THIS
PARTICULAR INSTANCE BECAUSE THEY
DON'T SWIM, WHICH MEANS THEY
HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TIME IN BEING
SUBMERGED IN THE WATER.
THE HIGH FLOW OF FLOODWATERS,
THE ZERO VISIBILITY, THE NOT
BEING ON CUBA.
THERE IS JUST EVERYTHING YOU
COULD POSSIBLY THROW AT THESE
KIDS IS HERE.
>> SO WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT A TEAM
OF SOME 90 DIVERS THAT ARE
ASSISTING IN THIS EFFORT AND A
LOT OF THEM NOT BEING THAI
DIVERS, WHAT LAYER OF COMPLEXITY
DOES THAT AD WHEN YOU HAVE
SOMETHING AS BASIC AS FOR
INSTANCE COMMUNICATIONS POSSIBLY
BEING A FACTOR HERE?
>> Caller: ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS
IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IF THEY
DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY THAT SPEAKS
WHATEVER LANGUAGE PER THE
INTERNATIONAL TEAM, BUT THEN
COMMUNICATION IN THE WATER IS
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE
TEACH IN CAVE DIVING IS THERE IS
NO TALKING SO EVERYTHING HAS TO
BE DONE USUALLY BY HAND SIGNALS
BUT IN 0 VISIBILITY, IT HAS TO
BE TOUCH CONTACT.
COMMUNICATIONS IS A REALLY
STRESSFUL FACTOR.
>> AND YOU KNOW, THE NOTION THAT
KEEPING CALM IS SUCH A CRITICAL
ELEMENT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
SWIMMING, WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT
BEING IN THAT KIND OF
ENVIRONMENT, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
USING SCUBA APPARATUS, CAN YOU
GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW CRITICAL
THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS
IN FACT A SAFE PASSAGE FOR THESE
BOYS AS THEY HEAD OUT.
THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A SENSE
OF CALM.
>> Caller: THAT'S ONE OF THE
BIGGEST ISSUES WITH A LOT OF
DIVERS IN CAVE TRAINING IS BEING
ABLE TO HANDLE STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS, EVEN THOUGH THEY
KNOW IT'S A DRILL AND THESE
KIDS, IT'S NOT A DRILL, THAT
HESE STRESSES MAY RISE E
AND ADVANTAGE TURNS TO PANIC,
WHICH IS USUALLY FATAL.
SO THAT'S WHY IN CAVE DIVING YOU
CAN'T EVEN START YOUR VERY FIRST
INJURY-LEVEL CAVERN UNTIL YOU'RE
18 YEARS OF AGE.
>> BECAUSE THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
OF STRESS IT CAN INVOLVE.
WE SAW HEAVY RAINFALL COMING
DOWN SHORTLY AFTER THE CREWS
WENT ON BREAK.
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO
AFFECT THE CONDITIONS AND GIVE
US A SENSE IF YOU CAN, ED, I
KNOW YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT THERE.
WHAT IS THAT CAVE ENVIRONMENT
LIKE WHERE YOU ARE TALKIN ABOUT
AN AREA THERE THAT HAS BEEN
FLOODED WITH WATER AND
VISIBILITY IS OBVIOUSLY AN
ISSUE?
>> Caller: AND ON A SYSTEM LIKE
THAT, IT'S -- A LOT OF TIMES
IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN IT'S WET
JUST TO NAVIGATE IN THE DRY CAVE
PORTIONS AND THEN NOW YOU'VE GOT
A COMPLETELY WATER-FILLED CAVE
SO YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT TO TOUCH,
GRAB, WALK IN SOME CASES,
BECAUSE OF THE ZERO-VISIBILITY
WATERS.
SO IT'S A DAUNTING TASK FOR
THESE KIDS AND JUST THE FACT
THEY'VE GOTTEN SO MANY OF THEM
OUT SO FAR IS NOTHING SHORT OF A
MIRACLE AGAINST ALL ODDS.
>> AND TIME IS SOMETHING THAT IS
A DIFFICULT THING FOR PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND WHY IT TAKES SO LONG
TO GET THE PROPER SORT OF
PREPARATION IN PLACE AHEAD OF
ONE OF THESE EXTRACASION
PROCESSES WHERE YOU --
EXTRICATION WHERE YOU ARE GOING
WITH YOUR PEOPLE AND A LOT OF
FOLKS WONDER WHERE DOES IT TAKE
SO LONG TO PREPARE FOR THAT?
>> Caller: A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S NOT
JUST A TUBE, A TUNNEL TO GO
THROUGH, IT'S FALLING DOWN
BOLDERS, CLIFFS, RESTRICTIONS --
BOULDERS, CLIFFS, THERE IS
PROBABLY LOOSE ROCKS, HAZARDS
BEYOND HAZARDS AND WHEN YOU'RE
IN ZERO VISIBILITY YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW THAT LINE.
IF YOU LET GO OF THAT LINE YOU
MAY NEVER GO OUT AND IF YOU'RE
IN A VERY, VERY SMALL
RESTRICTION, IT'S STRESSFUL BUT
IT'S NOT LIFE-THREATENING.
BUT YOU GET INTO A BIGGER
PORTION, THAT LINE MAY BE INCHES
FROM YOU AND YOU'LL -- IT MAY AS
WELL BE A MILE AWAY.
SO THAT LINE IS YOUR LIFE LINE.
>> AND IN SOME OF THESE IMAGES
THAT WE'RE SEEING, YOU GET A
SENSE OF JUST HOW CONFINED A
SPACE IS AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE
GOING TO NEED THESE AIR TANKS.
HOW DOES THAT PHYSICALLY WORK,
TRYING TO GET THROUGH SOME OF
THESE NARROW CREVICES WHEN
YOU'VE -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE
RELYING ON THESE AIR THANKS TO
ALLOW YOU TO BREATHE AND YOU'VE
GOT THESE BOYS AS YOU'VE POINTED
OUT MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN
THE WATER.
WHAT IS THAT LIKE?
>> Caller: THAT IS -- CAVE
DIVING IS AN EXTREME SPORT.
IT HAS A LOT OF INHERENT RISKS,
BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO WHAT WE
CALL GEAR MANIPULATION, OR
DOUBLE BOTTLE-UP RESTRICTIONS,
NORMALLY DIVERS HAVE TWO TANKS,
NOT ONE.
WHEN YOU GET TO A GEAR
RESTRICTION, THAT'S EXPERIENCED
CAVE DIVING.
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHEN
YOU SAY MANIPULATION?
>> THAT MEANS REMOVAL OF GEAR.
MOST CAVE DIVERS ARE NEVER
TAUGHT TO REMOVE THEIR GEAR.
SO TO DO THESE KIND OF
RESTRICTIONS, GEAR-OFF
RESTRICTIONS, THAT'S AN
ADVANCED, ADVANCED FORM OF CAVE
DIVING AND I DON'T LET PEOPLE
TAKE MY ADVANCED CAVE DIVING
COURSE WHERE WE DO GEAR
MANIPULATION AND BOTTLE-OFF
REALLY TIGHT RESTRICTIONS UNTIL
THEY HAVE AT LEAST 100, MINIMUM
SAFE CAVE DIVES.
SO THAT'S AFTER ALL OF THEIR
TRAINING.
>> SO THE FACT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
RESORTING TO THIS TELLS YOU
WHAT?
>> IT TELLS ME THEY HAVE NO
CHOICE.
SO THAT'S WHAT -- THAT'S WHY I
WAS SAYING IT'S A MIRACLE
THEY'VE GOTTEN THIS MANY OUT
ALREADY AGAINST UNSURMOUNTABLE
ODDS.
>> AND AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH
THESE IMAGES, IT IS JUST SO
COMPELLING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
MUST BE GOING THROUGH THE MINDS
OF THE BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN
TRAPPED THERE FOR MORE THAN TWO
WEEKS, BUT THEN THOSE NOW
ENTRUSTED WITH SAVING THEM AND
THE PRESSURE THEY'RE UNDER AND
WHAT THAT PHYSICALLY REQUIRES TO
MAINTAIN A SENSE OF MENTAL FOCUS
TO TRY TO GO ABOUT THIS MISSION?
>> Caller: WELL, THIS WOULD
BE -- THIS WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLY
STRESSFUL FOR AN EXPERIENCED
CAVE DIVER THAT'S DONE A -- AN
ADVANCED TYPE OF GEAR
MANIPULATION, OR REMOVABLE
CLASS, LET ALONE SOMEBODY THAT
IS NOT AN EXPERIENCED SCUBA
DIVER, OR NOT SCUBA CERTIFIED AT
ALL AND THESE BOYS, AS FAR AS I
UNDERSTAND IT, DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO SWIM.
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM
YOU MOST LIKELY HAVEN'T BEEN
SUBMERGED FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME
WHATSOEVER.
SO IT'S -- IT REALLY IS
MIRACULOUS THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN
THIS MANY OUT SO FAR.
>> JUST REMARKABLE TO THINK OF
THESE EFFORTS UNDERWAY.
ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND THIS.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
HAVE A NICE DAY.
>>> WE'LL HAVE THE REST OF THE
DAY'S NEWS AFTER A QUICK BREAK.
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
CBS NEWS ALWAYS ON.
>>> WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW
DEVELOPMENTS OUT OF THAILAND
WHERE AT THIS HOUR, RESCUERS
DIVERS ARE STARTING THE NEXT
PHASE OF THEIR RESCUE MISSION IN
THEIR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THOSE 15
MEMBERS OF A THAI YOUTH SOCCER
TEAM FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS
HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN A CAVE.
FOUR MEMBERS WERE REMOVED ABOUT
A HALF A DAY AGO AND DIVERS ARE
STARTING WHAT COULD BE -- IN THE
LAST INSTANCE, ABOUT AN
EIGHT-HOUR MISSION ROUND TRIP TO
GET FOUR MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM.
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND
WE ARE JOINED BY A FORMER NAVY
SEAL, JAKE, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
IF YOU WERE GETTING IN THE WATER
THIS MORNING WHAT WOULD BE YOUR
BIGGEST CONCERN?
>> Reporter: AT THAT POINT YOU
REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
YOU'RE JUST FOCUSED ON THE TASK
ORDER AT HAND.
BASICALLY YOU'VE REHEARSED THIS.
THEY'VE GOT IT DOWN TO TEN
MINUTES ON THE FIRST RUN FROM
THE REHEARSAL SO YOU'RE
BASICALLY GOING THREW YOUR
CHECKLIST OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE
GOT TO DO IN THE MISSION AND
YOU'VE PRACTICED FOR
CONTINGENCIES BUT YOU'RE REALLY
NOT THINKING ABOUT CONCERNS SO
MUCH.
IT'S MORE SO ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE
GOT TO DO TO ACHIEVE THE
MISSION.
>> AND GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT
THAT CHECKLIST LOOKS LIKE.
>> SO FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING
TO START WITH, EVERYBODY HAS
THEIR JOB.
I'M SURE THEY'VE WALKED THROUGH
IT A NUMBER OF TIMES RIGHT
BEFORE THEY ALL GO INTO THE CAVE
THEY'VE PROBABLY WALKED THROUGH
IT AGAIN, HEY, I'M STANDING
HERE, THIS IS MY JOB, AND THE
GUY IN CHARGE IS GOING TO MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
THERE IS PROBABLY SOME
MID--LEVEL LEADERS THAT ARE IN
CHARGE OF THE SPACE -- MID-LEVEL
LEADERS IN CHARGE OF THE SPACES,
I.E., THE PLACE WHERE THE SOCCER
TEAM IS GETTING OUT OF THE WATER
AND WALKING.
THEY PUT A BUNCH OF LAYERS OF
REDUNDANCY TO MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY IS CAPABLE OF DOING
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND
LIMIT TO THE RISK TO THE SOCCER
PLAYERS AND THE RESCUE TEAM.
>> DID YOU EVER PRACTICE FOR
RESCUING NOVICE DIVERS?
>> I NEVER TRAINED FOR IT BUT WE
TRAIN FOR RESCUING DOWNED PILOTS
BEHIND ENEMY LINES.
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
DEAL.
MOST OF THE TIME THE PILOTS
DON'T GET SHOT DOWN NEAR THE
LINE, THEY GET SHOT DOWN WILL BE
BEHIND IT AND IT'S JUST ONE OF
THOSE THINGS.
THE DIFFERENCE IS THOUGH AS A
FORMER NAVY SEAL AND WE'VE GOT
U.S. NAVY SEALS ON THE GROUND
THERE NOW, THEY'RE SOME OF THE
WORLD'S BEST AT THINKING AND
OVER COMING ADVERSITY.
SO I DON'T CARE WHAT THE MISSION
IS, THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY
TO WIN.
YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THE WORLD'S
BEST CAVE RESCUE DIVER THERE IS
AND THAI SEALS THERE.
AND YOU'VE GOT ELON MUSK ON THE
GROUND, SOME OF HIS CREW.
YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THE SMARTEST
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, AND YOU
DEFINITELY HAVE THE MOST CAPABLE
PEOPLE.
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE TRYING
TO BUILD A SPACE SHUTTLE,
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO
WIN.
>> I LOVE THE SHOUT OUT.
WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE KIDS 11
TO 16-YEAR-OLD KIDS IN NOT AT
THE RIRIVE HEALTH IN THIS CAVE.
NOT A TRAINED U.S. AIR FORCE
PILOT WHO YOU POTENTIAL LOW
POTENTIALLY RESCUING.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR
SKILL SET IS.
>> IS IT HELPS THEY'RE KIDS
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT SMALLER.
AT THIS POINT, THEY'VE MADE AN
ASSESSMENT OF EVERY PERSON'S
KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKE UP.
THEY'RE PROBABLY GIVEN SOME
SEDATIVES BEFORE THEY PULL THEM
THROUGH, THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN THE
NERVOUS KID FIRST TO GET THEM
OUT OF THE SITUATION AND CALM
EVERYBODY ELSE DOWN, AND THE
YOUNG AND LITTLE, RULES IT OUT,
BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING ALONG
AND PUSHING THEM DOWN THE ROAD.
IT'S A GODSEND THEY'RE LITTLE
PEOPLE.
>> IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT, WOULD YOU BRING
THE STRONGEST KIDS FIRST TO MAKE
SURE THE TECHNIQUE WORKS, THE
WEAKEST KIDS BECAUSE YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT HOW LONG THEY CAN
BE IN THE CAVE IN?
HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO BRING
THEM OUT?
>> THEY PROBABLY TOOK THE TWO
STRONG KIDS IN THAT FIRST WAVE.
THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE DOING
THEM IN TWOS AND ONCE THEY GOT
THOSE FIRST TWO THROUGH, THEY
WENT TO THE NEXT TWO THAT WERE
PROBABLY THE WEAKEST.
THE THING YOU'VE GOT TO
UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS THEY DIDN'T
KNOW THE OUTCOME.
THEY PROBABLY PASSED THEM OUT TO
SOMEBODY ELSE.
THEY HAD AN ORDER THAT
DETERMINED THERE WAS A DOCTOR
AND TWO NAVY SEALS, YOU KNOW ONE
THING WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT IS
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING OF
PEOPLE.
YOU'VE GOTTEN WHO TO SHOOT IN A
BAD SITUATION, SO THEY KNEW WHO
WAS GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM,
KIDS, AND THEY PROBABLY PLAN
TODAY THAT WAY SO THEY COULD GET
THEM OUT RIGHT BEHIND THE TWO
SUCCESSFUL KIDS.
>> WE'VE BELIEVED -- AND I MEAN
EVERYONE HAS SAID THIS IS AN
INCREDIBLE MISSION AND YOU SEE
THEM SUCCEED SO WELL YESTERDAY
AND QUICKER THAN THEY
ANTICIPATED.
DOES THIS STILL STRIKE YOU AS AN
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS MISSION
WHEN YOU SEE THOSE FOUR YOUNG
PEOPLE COME OUT?
I THINK THIS MAY BE DOABLE?
>> BROOK, LET'S BE HONEST.
WE CAN'T COUNT OUR CHICKENS
BEFORE THEY HATCH, RIGHT?
I MEAN WE'VE ALREADY LOST ONE
VERY EXPERIENCED THAI NAVY SEAL.
SO TO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO
GET THESE NEXT EIGHT PEOPLE OUT
UNSCATHED, WITHOUT ANY MORE
FATALITIES, I'M GOING TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU, MAN.
IT'S A STRETCH.
IT'S STILL JUST AS DANGEROUS AS
CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST.
IT MAY BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN
CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST.
AT LEAST YOU'RE JUST WORRIED
ABOUT FALLING.
THERE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
BREATHING, FALLING, GETTING
LOST, A WHOLE BUNCH OF FACTORS.
>> I'M CURIOUS HOW MUCH
EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE DEALING IN
THESE NARROW CAVE SITUATIONS AND
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?
>> IT'S INTERESTING.
A COUPLE YEARS BACK, I WAS DOWN
IN MEXICO, THOSE UNDER WATER
CAVERNS, AND I WAS FREE DIVING A
HOLE BASICALLY IN A CAVE WHERE I
WAS STAYING.
I WAS DOWN ABOUT 20 FEET WITH NO
AIR AND IT GOT REAL TIGHT AND I
HAD TO TURN AROUND AND WE ALL
HAVE THIS LITTLE SPIDEY SENSE
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT
CAN GET YOU KILLED AND MY SPIDEY
SENSE WENT TO 100 AND I MANAGED
TO OUT OF THE LITTLE TIGHT SPACE
BUT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH BEING
UNDERGROUND IN TIGHT SPACES AND
IT'S NEVER A NICE THING.
>> HOW MUCH DOES THE RAIN
CONCERN YOU IN THAT CONTEXT?
>> I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST WITH
YOU, THAT'S WHAT GOT THEM IN
TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO
AT THIS POINT, IT'S JUST ONE OF
THE HAZARDS OF THE JOB.
>> THANK YOU, JAKE, REALLY
INSIGHTFUL STUFF FROM A FORMER
NAVY SEAL.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT.
>> APPRECIATE IT, BROOK.
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.
>>> WHEN WE RETURN, MY COLLEAGUE
WILL HAVE THE REST OF THE DAY'S
NEWS.
