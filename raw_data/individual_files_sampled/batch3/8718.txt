STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. NOWHERE DOES POLITICS SHAPE OUR CULTURE THAN AT A UNIVERSITY. I HAVE KERA O'BRYAN PRESIDENT OF THE HARVARD CLUB. LET'S START WITH CASEY. I WAS BOO'D BY MY CLASSMATES WHEN RECEIVING MY DIPLOMA AROUND CAMPUS I WAS KNOWN AS THE CONSERVATIVE AND ALLIACEOUS HAD A TRUMP/PENCE STICKER ON HI HAT. STEVE: YOU WERE BOO'D. KERA HAVE YOU HAD THAT EXPERIENCE? I HAVE HAD SEVERAL THAT'S SIMILAR TO THAT. MY CLASSMATES ARE ACCEPTING BUT THE TEACHING ASSISTANTS HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK. IN MY AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY CLASS I HAD AN ASSISTANT THAT ASKED IF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE BETTER OR WORSE OFF IF HILLARY CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT AND IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT HE WASN'T ASKING FUR OUR OPINION AND THE ONLY ONE TO SAY OUR COUNTRY WOULDN'T BE BETTER OFF. HE CAME BACK AND SAID HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THIS AND THAT AND OFFERED SEVERAL OTHER SCENARIOS. I TOLD HIM, YES. HE REPRIMANDED ME AND TOLD ME I SHOULD RECONSIDER MY VIEWS. YOU ARE AT HARVARD. YOU ARE TOLD YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE AN OPINION. IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH THE REPUBLICAN CLUB WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CHANGE THIS? WELL, WE HOST A VARIETY OF FREE SPEECH EVENTS AND HAD A FORUM DISCUSSION OF POLICIES. THE HARVARD REPUBLICAN CLUB ARE WHAT CONSIDER TO BE MY FIRST HOME ON CAMPUS. IT'S A BROADER GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAN YOU EXPECT. THERE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU CAN FIND CONSENSUS ON. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON IS AN INITIATIVE I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF AS WELL. STEVE: KASSY I READ AN ARTICLE YOU WROTE ABOUT A WOMAN'S MARCH. IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING. CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? UNLIKE KIERA I HAD A HARD TIME WITH PROFESSORS. I DECIDED TO GO TO AN EVENT HELD ON CAMPUS. IT WAS THE FOUNDERS OF THE WOMAN'S MARCH. THEY CAME TO SPEAK ON CAMPUS AND I WANTED TO GO ASK QUESTIONS. THAT'S WHAT CONSERVATIVES DO. I WENT TO GO IN THE EVENT AND THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF STUDENTS THERE AND I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTIONS. I WAS TOLD WE COULDN'T WRITE A QUESTION AND WE HAD TO WRITE THEM ON NOTE CARDI THEM ON NOTE CARDS. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO COME TO CAMPUS AND DISCUSS WITH STUDENTS AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. STEVE: WHAT DID HAPPEN? WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY ANSWERED A FEW QUESTIONS FROM STUDENTS. ACTUALLY, ONE OF THEM CALLED ME OUT BECAUSE I WAS TWEETING ABOUT IT AND SHE WAS UPSET THAT I SAID NOT A LOT OF STUDENTS WERE THERE. IT WAS A ROOM FOR 1,000 STUDENTS AND I SAID MAYBE TO 100 STUDENTS WERE THERE. THEY DIDN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS AND THEY SHARED IDEAS AND DIDN'T LET OTHERS CHALLENGE THEM. THESE ARE COMMUNITY ACTIVIST. THEY SHOULD BE USED TO INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY JUST USED THIS PLATFORM TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS. STEVE: I THINK YOUR STORIES ARE SO TYPICAL OF WHAT'S GOING ON. I BELIEVE IN KIERA CASE THE TEACHERS AND IN YOUR CASE THE STUDENTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT GIVES ME OPTIMISM IS YOU ARE BOTH THERE. IT'S TERRIBLE TO SAY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS BRAVE. IT REALLY IS. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS REALLY BRAVE. YOU STAND-UP FOR WHAT YOU THINK. THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT'S THEIR INTOLERANCE THAT'S DOING THAT.
