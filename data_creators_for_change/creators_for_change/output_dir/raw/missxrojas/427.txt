00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hope you're doing well</font>

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,850
it's a horrible rainy day<font color="#E5E5E5"> in London for</font>

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,920
like the third day in a row but you know

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,569
that won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from talking about</font>

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">books I'm reading quite a lot at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,389
moment but the ones I want to talk about

7
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">with three particular titles the first</font>

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,469
one being the collected stories of video

9
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,150
Davis which I did mention in an earlier

10
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,859
video I love the way Lydia Davis right

11
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,600
but I think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> like working your way</font>

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,490
through a big collection like this means

13
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,250
in a way you get too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much apart dip in</font>

14
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,689
and out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I feel like she's trying</font>

15
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,430
bit too hard and some of her collections

16
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,660
and I think how words are much more

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,429
valuable if Yuri destroy a little bit at

18
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,230
a time she is a terrific writer and I

19
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,540
think she's quite underrated so if

20
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,290
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for something new</font>

21
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,000
especially short stories and especially

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,850
female authors and especially anything

23
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,410
then go for the collected stories of

24
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,850
Lydia Davis next I want to talk about

25
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,379
book they haven't actually finished yet

26
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,420
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of irked me in a way and</font>

27
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,460
I'm also enjoying weirdly I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

28
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would it was one of those books I kind</font>

29
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,890
of pulled off the shelf because the

30
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,539
cover looks silly the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> next earlier</font>

31
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,100
I thought was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be supremely</font>

32
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,989
trashy and terribly written<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten things</font>

33
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,520
we did and probably shouldn't have by

34
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,710
Sarah malinao ski I think is how you say

35
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,140
premise as many a 16 year old stream

36
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,879
having a beach house to herself and

37
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">being able to hang</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there for a year</font>

38
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,970
without parents without supervision with

39
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,470
your boyfriend around with your friends

40
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,600
around like great fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say this like 60</font>

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,070
pages from the end the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done</font>

42
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,720
so far pretty tame I think there are

43
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,250
lots of books are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being pushed as kind</font>

44
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,530
of risque and daring when really they're

45
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">not and they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of not doing as</font>

46
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,350
much as they could do we'll see the

47
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,509
characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them like our rebellious</font>

48
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,030
huge air quotes and come on anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

49
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,170
things they shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done they had</font>

50
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,119
a beach house to themselves for a year

51
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">30-6 think they did that they publish</font>

52
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,320
and have if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so catchy title</font>

53
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,970
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would read that book otherwise</font>

54
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,460
it's a fun pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well written book so</font>

55
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know check it out but I'm kind of</font>

56
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,950
like annoyed by a lot of teen fiction at

57
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,509
the moment I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainly it's the girls</font>

58
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,939
and teen fiction that just suddenly have

59
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,619
just really got on my nerves I don't

60
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,030
find most of them interesting I find

61
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,710
them really shallow and I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

62
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">on my blog saying well why do you just</font>

63
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,829
like move away from teen fiction in

64
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,540
general no because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gucci and</font>

65
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,130
fiction out there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

66
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,479
great books and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

67
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">great books and I don't understand why</font>

68
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going through this phase went</font>

69
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,799
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> every book I pick up is this</font>

70
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,990
really shallow female protagonist

71
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,909
narrator figure and every page of book

72
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,008
is about like some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring romance</font>

73
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,239
like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even like an interesting</font>

74
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship it's like it's just</font>

75
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,840
repetitive I feel like it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

76
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot better</font>

77
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,030
this'll like<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose in a roundabout way</font>

78
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,830
brings me to my last book and I know

79
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's gonna be people out there</font>

80
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,830
who like give some bias you're only

81
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,150
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this because she's a</font>

82
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,920
secret sibling no it's a really good

83
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,810
book the name of the star by maureen

84
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,700
johnson<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't read every single one</font>

85
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,260
of Maureen's books I've read most of

86
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,970
them this book is a completely different

87
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,319
kind of book from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones that</font>

88
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,670
she's been writing about an<font color="#E5E5E5"> American</font>

89
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">girl called Rory who comes to a British</font>

90
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,730
boarding school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the sudden</font>

91
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,500
these murders start to happen that

92
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,239
exactly imitate the famous Jack the

93
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,310
Ripper murders when they go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

94
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,830
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CCTV footage something is</font>

95
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,079
afoot that's all I will say the great

96
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about Rory the main characters</font>

97
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,110
actually pretty self-assured is not like

98
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,849
arrogant or annoying it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

99
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and entertaining to see her picking up</font>

100
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,120
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of peculiarities of</font>

101
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,099
secondary school life in Britain<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

102
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just little things like confusion</font>

103
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,459
at the UK timetable you get with this

104
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,170
ridiculous jumble of different subjects

105
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,670
every day in double periods and half

106
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,079
periods and things like that I think

107
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,549
Lauren's really taking care to recreate

108
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,230
the secondary school experience but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

109
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time when you read boarding school</font>

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,959
books<font color="#CCCCCC"> there can be little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lien a</font>

112
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,170
really interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting and you</font>

113
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,430
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go then you wonder why</font>

114
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,510
your parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't send you to boarding</font>

115
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,709
school but they are quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a unique</font>

116
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,209
experience but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the</font>

117
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,130
boarding school in London necessarily so

118
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,630
that she's around the area of

119
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,069
Whitechapel with the Jack the Ripper

120
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,329
murders I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes a boarding</font>

121
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,829
school work I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes the whole</font>

122
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,500
world more accessible I hate the word

123
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,329
accessible I found the plot to be really

124
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,620
clever and interesting it played the

125
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas of CCTV and celebrity against one</font>

126
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
another in many ways it really explores

127
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,849
the kind of kinetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> London in the sense</font>

128
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,620
that we feel like someone is watching us

129
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,840
at all times<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what extent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do we rely</font>

130
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">on what we can see in front</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us the</font>

131
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,810
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of visual bias that we place upon</font>

132
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,099
everything another thing I thought was

133
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,359
really well executed was the way in

134
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people kind of really seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

grasp<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto these kind of spectacles of</font>

murders and things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

137
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,599
get really obsessed with them the

138
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,519
murders become the sensational event and

139
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,470
everyone flocks to see them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> river</font>

140
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,900
mania orbit all like people making

141
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,030
t-shirts and mugs and things like that

142
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,489
of this really gross horrible event it's

143
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,130
not like it's a book that's like trying

144
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,840
too hard to play with those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas are</font>

145
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,519
explored really well within the story

146
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,069
and because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn to the story it's</font>
