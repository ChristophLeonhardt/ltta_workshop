hey welcome to the first ever Declassified live Declassified live i've been looking so forward to doing this with you guys now i you saw we had a couple of difficulties i was uh checking my phone making sure we were live but a lot to talk about today we want your comments we want your ideas we want your questions i'm gonna keep checking my phone just to make sure with our producers that there are no glitches mr. galaxy man is still here we love it so i you know something interesting happened last night i wanted to start the show by talking about there's this socialist candidate alexandria Acacio cortez hey marcin walter wits I think I said that right hello from Poland and this is so this Alexandria Acacio Cortez won her primary in New York's 14 congressional district no story came out in the Daily Mail and I some other outlets that she didn't infection calls herself this girl from the Bronx well she's not in fact this girl from the Bronx turned out he grew up in Yorktown Heights in Westchester County very nice County one of the wealthiest counties in the US now I they had put up a picture of her childhood home in various media outlets it was all over the web let's check the photo put out a tweet well this is where she this is um you know where she grew up she didn't grew up in the Bronx and she went to Brown University I was mistaken about that it will email Peace Initiative Lee said she went to brown turns out she went to Boston University oh my god you would have thought I kicked a puppy on a live stream that's all the left focus on that one little error by the way I corrected in a tweet about oh I don't know she tweeted back at me and all the bots went crazy and all the far left radical blue texts went crazy and they started you know telling me how horrible I was how amazing socialism is let me just say this I expect a 28 year old socialist bartender to fail in Congress about as badly as a 46 year old socialist community organizer bailed in the White House so I've got people from Poland I know Joseph we will not stop supporting Israel Israel's a great ally sorry man I wish I could help you out there but nope it's just not gonna happen so well you know we've got that going on we've got a lot happening over in the House of Representatives did you just share a committee the Intel committee really really upset I mean really upset in many ways with FBI director Christopher ray and of course that be the Attorney General rod Rose instead finds theme though uh and you know here's the problem right you've got guys like Rosen Stein you've got guys like and I'm gonna move my browser around here I can chat with you guys while still while still beating the Topix oh the day isn't that excited and so we've got those problems there and now we have a leftist president a leftist landslide win in Mexico and you have to believe that's got a lot to do with the rise of right-wing populism here in the United States be hey good evening from Australia thank you for watching though also guys were trying this format the reason I'm doing the show early 7:30 a.m. is that the 7:30 a.m. is because it's morning drive here on the east coast of the United States we're gonna see how this works if you're already at work or if you're on YouTube in the car you're in a carpool whatever it may be we want to see how this format works even if you can engage you engage at a red light want to see how this works if this time doesn't work for people we're gonna move back over and and try something in the afternoon but I'm really hoping the morning works I think it's a really cool way to start the day Rumph is a legend Morrison says I couldn't agree more and I think this is a really good way to start the day because I typically on my other show off-the-cuff Declassified which I'm no longer doing I'm gonna do the live show instead I was doing really deep analysis for you but I was doing the analysis late I was analyzing a story that had broken the night before earlier that morning by the time we were able to get the entire show recorded get the content edited and get it out to you it was already hours and hours and hours late and so uh greetings from Finland thank you for watching from Finland South Wales you guys are awesome you guys are absolutely awesome intranasal audience I love it I love it and I'm flattered thank you very much for tuning in but I want to try to stick with the morning format but again it's all going to be dictated on what you want to see what you want to hear the entire thing is quite honestly gonna be driven by you the audience because you're why do this right you're who matters so anyway I've got this leftist landslide in Mexico we've got this terrible terrible situation going on here in the United States with regards to our DOJ right we've got Christopher Rey we've got frozen Stein they're fighting with with they're fighting with our Congress people like Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz and I'm and I'm bouncing around here Brian to see what topics you want to talk about or topics you might want to talk you go down let's see Australia don't forget Australia I said Australia twice Eli Australia was the first to log on internationally I've got a lot from Australia right now UK to support the rebel team you guys are awesome and bvy ups Trump is loved by most people who hate their government you know the Ronald Reagan had a famous quote the nine most terrifying words in the English language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help and he was right government doesn't do anything efficiently that's actually a great way a segue back to where I started the show which was we were talking about this socialist who won in New York's 14th congressional district Alexandria Acacio Cortes well I'm shocked by the amount of support of socialist gets here in the United States I expect it because that New York City district Israel it's far left it's like Nancy Pelosi district I grew up in Queens this district in which this girl won covers the northern part of Queens the east part of the Bronx very different area than it used to be it's predominantly English as a second language last I checked up there 90% of the district English as a second language it is 9:42 p.m. in Brisbane Australia thanks Tom thanks for sticking in and watching it's a and so I don't understood anybody could support socialism I understand why she won her Democratic primary because of the makeup of that district but there are a lot of heady and electoral arguments against socialists there are some outstanding arguments in favor of the free market in favor of capitalism I live by him but to me it's much simpler and me it's much simpler have you ever walked into a Department of Motor Vehicles have you ever seen the dysfunction behind the counter that's government that's government and I don't understand how anybody who has ever walked into a Department of Motor Vehicle a Department of Motor Vehicle him say that they want the people responsible for that the people responsible for Baltimore Detroit and Chicago who run the country I don't understand this I don't understand this Vicki says hello from Northwestern Ontario let's talk about Tommy Robinson not a lot of new news the I believe and I've believed from day one that Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner he's being politically persecuted for daring to out Muslim rape gangs and he should be free and what would we don't want to we could spend every show talking about that but but my feelings are gonna be the same he should be freed with the government of the UK is doing is disgraceful they're putting to political correctness before public safety it's a terrible terrible thing and Tommy should be set free no ifs ands or buts about it and the judge should be ashamed of himself Don's healing says good morning John good morning to you let's see what we got here I live in a 95 percent white city in Canada where over 80% white just don't go to Toronto well I think it's it's not about white or black and I don't look at white or black or Hispanic it's not about race it's about productivity but people that want to contribute to society I have neighbors of all races I live in a nice neighborhood they're all successful people they enjoy their lives they're good hardworking Americans great families I don't care what these races I care about somebody being productive being a provider a a contributor or a leech a taker that's how I look at society race couldn't be further from my Frank Odom says he's going to the DMV in Maryland today god help me Frank I have my sympathy have my sympathy no I will never Argyll says thanks that for saying Asian grooming gangs now he's a Muslim paedophile rate let's call this what it is I worked child sex crime cases when I was in law enforcement and I will never never sanitize that narrative you have nothing to worry about what disgusts me is when I slandered Tommy is when they slanted Tommy is a race yeah it's terrible evil bastards it's absolutely terrible we all know it's not about ray that Tommy Robinson isn't me and persecuted for any other reason then he dared defy the politically correct narrative in the UK which is Muslim migrants who rape kids and women don't exist that doesn't exist the Muslims in the UK are all these wonderful productive members of society how dare you ever say they're doing the terrible things they are in fact doing let's say Tommy Robinson scares the establishment because of his humility groups I I tend to agree look I think everybody everybody who challenges the political correct status quo scares and if you go to my Twitter feed at John Cardillo you'll see what I'm talking about I simply made one little mistake last night they immediately corrected I said that this socialist candidate Alexandria Cascio Cortez went to Brown University instead of Boston University because the Daily Mail story indicated Brown she corrected me I said opus I stand corrected Boston University which look really good 5060 thousand dollar-a-year school there I literally just checked I had 2.6 million million mentions on Twitter the overwhelming majority of them attacks from the far left forgetting that one little detail wrong these people are unhinged but it has nothing to do with me getting Brown University and in Boston University erroneously mixed up no this has to do with I attacked a far left sacred cow a 28 year old socialist latina I debunked her false campaign narrative that she grew up in the Bronx when she in fact grew up in a very nice suburb Yorktown Heights that she went to an expensive university in Boston and that she is not your typical kid from the hood that's why I'm being attacked the hill even wrote a piece the hill wrote a hit piece on me last night think she shredded me one little mistake and it's very ironic that the fake news mainstream media it's shredding me for one little mistake that I immediately corrected I love it well they gave me three million Twitter impress god bless them even when they think I lose I win not too worried about but the unhinge left thanks uh I don't know what this means dolly daydream if we understand everything go watch Joe mess opposed panel Q the plan to save the plan means but I'll have to check it out I want to save the planet we all do let's see your Canadian Forces bases are also FEMA camps Canada they are ready for you well Canada doesn't have a female maybe they do I don't know I don't drive into those conspiracy did sorry let's see what else you guys got for him throw me throw me something and Shapiro supports no civil liberties I wouldn't go that look I know Ben has done his never Trump thing and he can be he can be you know a bit frustrating at times but I will say this about man Shapiro guys always been nice to me i I know been through the industry I don't know well but we have mutual friends I'd know him through the end he's always very cordial when I rent to him an event so but I think he's fundamentally wrong on Trump I think look I think all the never Trump errs are fundamentally wrong on Trump I uh Herr Schlick to wrote a great piece our own Kerch elector up on Town Hall calm about never Trump errs and there's also an outstanding piece in the American Spectator in fact if you go to my Twitter at John Cardillo I put both of those pieces up this morning and both of them thoroughly and very successfully explain why the never Trump movement is failed irrelevant and really needs to just go away unhinged weirdos like Bill Kristol just need to go away I did not hear what anybody said on Bill Maher guessing you think that Bank I'm missing here Bernie Ben Shapiro I I didn't hear it I don't watch that one not might think I have no confidence in appealing on issue so I attacked her background no I didn't attack her background did not attack her background well she won by so many votes talking about Alexandria Acacio Cortes I don't play a music is a supporter of hers I'll engage number why did attack her background I clarified her background claims to have grown up in the Bronx he didn't he grew up in Yorktown Heights in Westchester County a very wealthy county he makes it seem as if she's this underprivileged girl she went to a university that's 50 to 60 thousand dollars yearly that's then attacking her background that's being in media and pointing out the truth he won because her district obviously wants a socialist like her she's an anomaly in the rest of the country and I think it's very very bad for America I think our policies are being soundly debunked that's why there's going to be a red wave not a blue wave in November and quite frankly vote for who you want wanna vote for a socialist that has no chance of doing anything in Congress and never getting on a committee and never getting a bill passed be my guest throw your vote away in fact I want you to I want the Democrats to show America that they really are radical socialist haters I would love nothing more than for the Democrats to prove that narrative to the rest of America uh Shapiro said on mayor that he sports impeachment of Miller finds anything well that's what been a night this is I think Muller's investigation is a witch-hunt and a sham the most tainted unimportant impartial and impartial improper investigation I've seen in 25 years I know my boyish good looks betrayed that but twenty five years in working alongside or analyzing lon and yep dolly daydream red wave coming from America dark to light I agree I think it is a red way the president's winning winning winning winning winning I don't see how Democrats in any way shape or form and and ever of the Democrats will ever pick up anything with this platform I mean when the cornerstone of your platform is Maxine Waters saying attack Trump supporters and you've got people like Peter Fonda calling for a Trump Scott kid Barron to be put in a cage with a pedophile and the children of ice agents to be terrified at school and terrorized at school I think the left is is really in its death road quite frankly and I don't understand why anybody would listen it I mean remember if you want to make a small donation there's button up there if you want to make small donation your question bounces up to the top and you get preferential treatment and a special mention and hell for in the same town together I'll bite let's see you try those eyebrows get their own vote do you know I think Trudeau's eyebrows should get their own postal code those were glorious they're absolutely glorious not only anything about you know what is eyebrows what is wrong with an unapologetic supportive finding the truth nothing exactly that's what I did I hope you're talking about my trying to expose where a socialist Alexandria Acacio Cortez look I will never a grew up I will never support socialism in this thing I will never support socialism in this nation never never never never never never never never never never now I'm not being rude check on my phone and you wanna make sure my producers nope looks good put a make sure they're telling me we don't have any glitches I want to bring guys oh it's seamless show we want to look amazing free uh ben shapiro said he whatever the truth is he would accept it the problem with that that's her evil bastard is I don't believe Muller is about the truth I believe Muller is about scripting a narrative it is not the job of a prosecutor to generate an opinion paper a report that's not mother's job his job is to prosecute like trey Gowdy said if you've got something presented to a grand jury if you've got an indictment prosecute but Muller's job is to not opine as to what do you think might have happened it's the prosecutor not prosecute and I don't believe Muller has any intention of being impartial I think Muller this is a political witch-hunt from start to finish I believe President Trump was 100 100 percent right when he said that all right lever said lie them freedom for Humanity we're talking about socialism come on guys come on guys give me some more good topics Rosenstein going down IG report I hope so I hope so dolly I don't know if that's mr. galaxy man 57 too bad about you Canadian people dumb useless not needed on the world don'twe I'm not Canadian we can it kind of a beautiful country and the people in Canada are awesome they've got a moron running the country right now but well my favourite cities are Vancouver Toronto and Calgary beautiful cities some of the nicest people I've ever met and living here in South Florida lot of Canadians come here on vacation I've got a lot of Canadian friends couple of neighbors on the block where I live not far from the studio are Canadian they they're here six seven months a year South Florida great great people great people my old neighbors in Miami Canadian they put the time between Vancouver and Miami bill very very close friends they moved out five years ago so I got to disagree with you there you know look Ben Shapiro has has been an ever Trumper from day one I read with Ben is a lot on Ben Shapiro here I disagree with Ben below he's an American he's entitled his opinion I think he's wrong I think he's his narrative is falling flat but he does have influence with Millennials college-age students and with them he's overwhelmingly conservative on the issues of the First Amendment the Second Amendment though I think he does a lot of good where we part ways is on his disdain of Trump but but beyond that I gotta give credit where do they've been and I can disagree vehemently on what he does from but I think he's also done a lot of good with regards to promoting the First Amendment especially on college campuses and so I don't have to agree with you on any issue but love ben shapiro hate bench beer the guy's been out there's been a warrior but on the frontlines let's say evil bastard i believe that too but the bottom line is mother we will either present real evidence or he will not i guess is that he won't i'm basked him for that when it's over problem is he still has subpoena power and grand jury power and that's the problem and when a prosecutor do more than lambaste the prosecutor that presents bad evidence you got to do a lot more a lot more it doesn't that they're breaking the law they're playing with authority they're in their own way obstructing justice i think we yeah i think it's got to be much more than lambaste in him I think penalties need to be a little more severe than that faith in Hope Islam has infiltrated every country's government and now threatening to unleash jihad if they don't go along with the opening of borders and letting the silent invasion continue well that's why we're trying to close us that's why President Trump won and down why are people so obsessed with Marx with his ideas how many dead BBY UPA I'm saying uh well mega Dutchess up some of you I don't know I don't know why people subscribe to Marxism and socialism I think they think it's cool and the same morons away Che Guevara t-shirts forgetting that he was a communist murdering rapist I don't know I don't know and Muller is a problem because uranium one I think Muller the problem long before that Muller had a has a history he and Andrew Weissman is number two of being admonished by judges playing fast and loose with exculpatory evidence getting a little cozy with mobsters where they're running as confidential informants and somebody goes lol this guy is not Canadian no not there it is I thought well you know you seem like this morning I've gotten the American flag behind me give it away there tough guy but I thought that that again at the top of the most of it poked nearly got arrested but I don't like the Pope nearly got arrested what I would suggest you do is not read conspiracy theory website Pope is a foreign head of state in addition to being I'm not a fan of this poll by thing he's a far less socialist that being said in addition to being the spiritual leader of the Catholic Church and a leader of world's Catholics Vatican City is a sovereign nation state so the Pope is also a sovereign head of state no the Pope wasn't almost a rat I blame Rage Against the Machine you mean the band from the 90s okay happy Independence Day to Canada you just reminded me of that thank you reminding me happy Independence Day Canada hours is coming up of course days let's see let's see what we got going after Western Western Christian country's values and all that you can't arrest a pope for that but crime so uh yeah I don't like this Pope I don't subscribe to this Pope I grew up Catholic twelve years of Catholic school I think he acts more like a far left head of state and he does a spiritual leader of a global religious movement but that all being said can't arrest a guy in for an opinion so could not wear Harry as Truman's socks well let me just put it this way i think harry s truman socks are probably a little more masculine I would have to say that pain peddler the u.s. is becoming the last bastion for freedom of speech I want to move there from Australia you know there's a really prolific writer you're probably seen him out there in the media Nick Adams and he's an Australian who came to the United States he's written several books on it he's an advisor now to the president's reelect Nick is a good good friend of mine and I would encourage I'll bring Nick on when they able to be having guests on the show and I would bring Nick on one day in a split screen with me and he'll answer your questions as well and you've got to hear Nick's Horror Story coming to the United States legally especially when he got not an Australian and from Australia not an Australian but a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement person or State Department person at the Embassy found that he was conservative and made his life even more difficult Austin and his family a lot of money oops sorry not Independence Day Confederation day my apologies Canada somebody said happy Independence Day Sorry Sorry Sorry I stand corrected I stand corrected greetings from Israel well thank you very much Wow got people from all over the globe all over the globe this is awesome what do I think about Trudeau sneaking around in the individual states to try and outmaneuver Trump I saw that but Trudeau couldn't outmaneuver a Prius driven by a 97 year old woman so I'm really not too worried about Trudeau maneuvering Trump I won't worry about that too much let's see we have to keep the u.s. out of the hands of Democrats for at least one full generation that means at least 20 years oh I would add a zero to that let's keep it out of the hands of Democrats for 200 years at another zero mm keep adding zeroes you're bad and zero we don't ever want the Democrats to have the you it's uh you know it the Democrats want to do is I always say today's Democratic Party is not the Democratic Party of 20-30 years ago look people say to me well you know Ronald Reagan was able to get along with Tip O'Neill and Democrats like Daniel Patrick Moynihan buzz because they were patriotic Democrats who love their nation they might have fundamentally disagreed on social programs and other issues but more in the Moynihan's the bone eels loved america they bled red right red white and blue today's democratic party doesn't the Tom Perez's and the Keith Ellison's Muslim Somali Muslims were electing in Minnesota and socialists from New York they hate this country they hate this country Riko coin report watching from Paris France awesome awesome so we have Australia Israel France New Zealand UK Canada the United States what did I miss if I missed you please tell me thank you bvy you be you're right I you think socialism was a good idea until I started to pay taxes and grew up there's an old saying if a 20 you're not a liberal you don't have a heart and if at 40 you're not a conservative you don't have a brain Rudo fits into his mom's pantyhose better than I guess you mean Harry Truman socks I said New Zealand greetings from North Korea is that you kim jeong-hoon uh yeah yeah I don't think Trudeau could yeah I think Trudeau not a stretch that he might have tried on these once maybe his mom's pantyhose maybe I don't know I don't have any evidence to that dad that effect but hmm any comment Rico coin report ass any comment on Obama's whereabouts and post world leader meeting work yeah Obama's out there try and undermine Trump Obama's former attorney general somebody called his wingman Eric Holder I don't know if you know this he's out there every day he's the lawyer behind this whole gerrymandering thing this team to have Democrats the estate redistricting and their congressional districts redistricting but that Democrats have more power that's all I recorder in 20 years White's will be nearing a minority and facing an ascendant Hispanic Democratic voting bloc all migration has to be stopped well I know those are the numbers but I've dug you know I don't think that's the case either but again it's not white black Hispanic Asian that's nothing to do with it it's producers and non producers producers tend to be conservative non producers tend not to be I heard that Hillary Clinton never worked on the official State Department email server and her official email was almost unused I don't know I mean it reports to that effect but I'm sure she said many many emails from her official State Department email as well but it doesn't matter excuse me if she said one classified email from a non State Department non-secure server that's illegal most of these let's see who this is gee Fox and we've got a lot of people watching and commenting I really want to thank you most of these social progressives don't even have children I've known a lot I've known a lot that changed to conservatives once they have children of their own yeah kids are expensive but to realize you got to keep were your own money you start to realize you got to keep more of your own money the enforcer Simon ball says Europe in 50 years will be a muslim continent look at London now the English being wiped out that cares me more than what's happening in the unit here's me a lot more what did Bill Clinton do in 1993 with the World Trade Center was bombed I gotta give Bill Clinton credit for one thing he gave law enforcement whatever they needed I was a new york city cop at that time he gave law enforcement whatever they needed jacob del rahman the blind sheikh we caught him very very quickly in a matter of weeks mm-hmm local law enforcement FBI CIA I don't excuse me ATF every federal agency involved had all the resources all the money they needed credit where do bill quit and when I worked there also gave the NYPD 30 million dollars for new equipment and so I will say this it's agree with a lot of things Bill Clinton did the guy was tough on crime he was a horrid core right winger on crime hard core right winger on evil bastard says we have to call out the left when they try to strawman the argument we're talking about legal immigrants we're not we're talking about illegals agreed very very important distinction very very important distinction let's see what else we got here the DNC plans to infiltrate conservative groups to trigger violence I've been doing that they've been doing that and this DNC and that was from Euro 0 anak zero that this DNC has really been doing this for years they started doing it under Obama the the far left faction of the DNC it really was the birth of an Tifa and those groups right they've been trying to create unrest in conservative organizations for years now well Bill Clinton well you know you want people saying our videos that Bill Clinton know exactly where Benoit was it I I know what you're referring to you got to really watch these videos again not the ones that are taking him on these conspiracy theory websites but up to YouTube with very selective ah they could have bombed and killed bin Laden there were a lot of reasons at the time they didn't go to have but here's the problem you can't look at it and say well have they done that he would have 9/11 never would have happened there are a lot of people responsible for 9/11 uh you know palade Sheikh Mohammed uh a whole bunch a whole bunch we're responsible for it wasn't one guy those plans were in motion for years and years and years one guy was taken out or plenty to take his place to carry out the attack then we had killed him earlier sure hmm but Petrina Shadowcat says lol Janus was that not an epoch Supreme Court decision taking money from and wind out of the Union cells was absolutely epic epic and I think it's it's uh the first step to long-needed union-busting here in the US you know unions were important entities turn of the century terrible working conditions people needed to be able to have a union have a collective group to say we're not going to work like this in this meat factory getting our arms cut off well now you have OSHA and all kinds of government inspectors the FDA I mean they're limitless and people have cell phone cameras and they can take pictures of bad working conditions so unions want to exist for collective bargaining but it's uh you know I don't think that they're uh I don't think they're um needed beyond that do I think Stephen Harper will meet with Trump he's meeting with Bolton uh well here's the thing it all depends on the meeting with Bolton goes meeting with the president United States it really be reserved for those who want to work with the United States but want to try to achieve a goal and so I would assume that John Bolton and president Trump or and have a long meeting after that and when they do they're gonna make a decision on whether or not Trump should me with Harper hmm people need to start boycott boycotting extremist actor films and make Hollywood sit up and listen Mike sim says well they are I don't really saw the numbers on the Peter Fonda movie the opening weekend this movie was marketed by Sony classics not some arthouse $29,000 at $15 a ticket it means like 1500 people saw the movie so Americans Americans are reacting as an ex-cop do you believe the video on the wieder laptop move vet cops to tears now I know that's a story from that fake website true pundit I have old partners in the computer crimes unit don't listen to anything true pundit publishes too many embellishments no people were not moved to tears story with the wiener laptop is the NYPD had the laptop on the cat case with the kids they realized there were classified emails the NYPD said ok we shouldn't be in possession of these they went to the FBI the FBI and the NYPD together went to a federal judge asked the federal judge to order the NYPD to give the laptop to the FBI standard operating procedure to preserve the chain of custody the NYPD handing it to the FBI taints the NYPD's investigate NYPD having it heats the FBI's investigation but when a federal judge says I reviewed everything and these are the parameters under which we're going to transfer the laptop then the chain of custody is preserved its preserved there were no don't believe that true pundit story the NYPD he's four into fights with the FBI none of that happened none of that happen the FBI and NYPD cooperated on that it became a federal case after the state had the evidence for their case people are putting up false information four clicks any thoughts on Andrew Shearer well not so much let's see if there's anything new on all that and my machine is of course freezing my machine is there we know not not really yet I like to see politicians evolve and I'm cautiously watching what's happening in Canada because as Canada is one of our I would argue our closest ally in the world I want to see Canada but more effective conservative leadership but I I I just look I like sure his positions I love them will he have real power that's my question I would love to see a Shearer in place of a Trudeau I would love to see a conservative who is more in sync with the President of the United States but love that every conservative would and I can understand why Canadians are frustrated but I just uh I'm optimistic for Canada I want to get to the point where I'm very optimistic for Canada but you need to vote Canadians really need to get out there and go what's the nobel peace prize worth when that nominee the 22 year old charity chairman in New York was arrested in pedophilia well I agree he gray I totally totally agree but that's today's left that is today's unfortunately they a 10 - somebody said Shearer is a globalist show like Trudeau yeah but he's better than what you got better than what you got you know I don't I wish you guys could have a true conservative but I just don't know if your political class up there in Canada that's cultivated enough that's my concern so I'm ready to take anybody better than Trudeau on my northern border let's say you got a lot coming in right now uh sure it's a globose like you know providing about the Australian I'm still waiting for Trudeau grope in case I don't know anything that um let's go back there was one I liked here that's like Bruce Jenner winning an espy after murdering somebody when the real winner was Lauryn Hill why would Lauren Hill win an espy play sports now I'm very very very very good but going back to that 22 year old arrested for pedophilia you know it seems like deviant behavior is very permissive within leftist ideology doesn't it it sure seems that way it seems like the left is is more interested in I don't know trying to show how diverse and open-minded they can be above being oh I don't know on top of public safety hearing about children or the safety of children but we see it there was another story where a bar is being sued because a transgender couldn't go into the bathroom lady's room they were asked for ID and asked to leave this photo of this guy he looks like a guy with earrings and lipstick I don't know I have a nine-year-old 10 year old niece and now I don't want that guy in the ladies room with her and my sister-in-law or if my niece goes in alone I don't want that grown man in there and I've got to go in there no I don't want that there are plenty of times when a dad is with his daughter and she's 10 11 years old and she needs to go in the ladies room and she wants to go alone you don't want a grown man walking in there with your little girl a grown man in lipstick I'm sorry I'm sorry flame me call me too traditional no I don't buy into it ah Oh Ezra brought up the case of Trudeau groping a young female journalist I did not see that I did not see that case alright great I'm gonna dig into it today there's been I I typically break things down here at the rebel is be in there us corresponding Ezra has Canada well in hand he's a genius with regard to Canadian politics I tend to stick to the US I want to bring you the deep analysis from the US so I did not be that I will check that out today but as the US correspondent I a new dick to what's going on down here and believe me we've got our hands full with Rosenstein and Muller and Ray in the DOJ and Congress is war and everything everything but we'll definitely check that out after the show thank you very much for break I'll check out as a report on that as well d-day is an Ohio guy loved that state it's I love that state I love the Midwest in general what does the future look like for Anthony Weiner pretty miserable in federal prison for a couple of years as a convicted sex offender I don't think he recovers when he comes out yeah I think he's political and any power he had politically is done my bigger concern is why hasn't Huma Abedin also been that's my bigger concealer he's entire team get a pass let's see what else we got here yeah dolly daydream said it's all done in normalize pedophilia I think it's just on a normalized deviant behavior in general deviant behavior in general Oh Jade a you're 33 and this whole left and right talk has had you confused for years why it's a really really interesting point y5w confuse i'd love pygmy here and tell me why because that is a great great point and somebody sharp said in Portland Oregon proud boys kick some Antipa but yeah they did what was really disturbing is that if you notice what happened there the proud boys and other conservative groups had permits to march and Tifa didn't and Tifa attacked them and the portland police stood down until and Tifa started getting their asses kicked very sad day for law enforcement sad day for America i reco coin keeps asking what I think about Australian refugee Brandon O'Connell III don't know this story I got a dig into it sorry I got a dig into it the enforcer Simon balls can the UK borrow Trump but haven't changed in charge for a couple of years I wish you guys would I wish you guys would let's see Moon dogle genderless demons reading propaganda to children that's the teeth want and I'm not even half joking yeah they did they really really they really really did do that they try to like I said normalize the deviant and they're trying to do it too little kid six seven years because I'm bad DB that's things of that nature it's pretty pretty tragic pretty terrible stuff if you let's see JB I wish all cops are like Andy Griffith now was on patrol and then a gun and robbery unit in the South Bronx in the mid the late 90s early early early and the Griffith wouldn'ta lasted five minutes hang wouldn'ta lasted five minutes do I think Jordan Peterson could be hired by the Trump administration is it legal or possible you're right but the right filings it's legal he's not running for president do I think you should be hired by the administration no I think Jordan Peterson should stay right where he is he does great work right where he is and if you work inside the White House if you work for the administration you're very limited on what you can say and I think Jordan Peterson value comes from his ability to speak his mind so no I wouldn't want to see a great mind who's really making an impact like that limited by a White House job wouldn't make whole hell of a lot of sense to me uh let's see what else we got here hey they said Andy Griffith not Barney Fife okay neither one of them would have lasted on the street up there especially with the bullets in Barney's pocket well Trump if DOJ or FBI go after soil for what Jonathan Bryan asked me that then one guy Couture's broke any laws donating to radical causes is legal you know so uh I don't I don't like weaponizing law enforcement against political ideology that's what we fight motive a libertarian who is Q nobody stop that's a false phony conspiracy theory this whole Q and on thing it's simply ludicrous myself and other people that actually worked on the inside of this world laugh at it we have a good laugh at it and not believe in it there is no 5b hindi 978 D chess with Muller and Rosenstein and sessions and Trump meeting in the White House doesn't exist doesn't exist none of that exists things are what they are sessions the terribly terribly weak Attorney General Rosenstein runs DOJ a lot of hostility to Trump the deck is stacked the game is rigged Trump needs to fire people and appoint a second special counsel forget that whole queuing on thing it's ludicrous what do I think about the V for Vendetta guy and all the Illuminati stuff I mean Guy Fawkes I don't believe in conspiracy theory well not in the Illuminati that's all nuts and this stuff you know there's some symbols your The Da Vinci Code but I well dolly it's nice that you've learned everything from cue but you're learning bad information you're not getting accurate information I could sit here and tell you that I have a super secret government agent and put my friend and put a black sheet over my friend and tell you that's the guy and I can't show his face and spew your conspiracy theories and if you believe them you do that your apparel and your apparel just because somebody claims to be claims to be something doesn't mean they're that thing and I'm telling you this whole q and on phenomenon is a conspiracy theory lunacy thing no there's nobody inside the government goods now yeah there's no you don't believe conspiracy you're free to believe what you want I'm trying to tell you as a guy who comes on air every day who has deep contacts in DC they laugh the people actually in the know laugh at this q and on thing they laugh at it hey maybe it gets and they think it's tragic that so many people are following and listening to it getting bad information and these conspiracy theorists that but with the q and on stuff and also the crazy stuff they're telling you what you want to hear to give you hope but you hang on their every word but not giving you good information you wouldn't want your doctor if you were dying of congestive heart failure and you couldn't breathe you wouldn't want your doctor to come in and say well it's a mild case of bronchitis don't worry about it take these go home when you need open-heart surgery thank you I mean that's not what you'd want your doctor to do and that's what these conspiracy theories do they tell you what you want to hear so you keep clicking and hang on their every word and I'm telling you guys don't buy it don't buy it Laurin southern what do I think of Trump's current relationship with Trudeau look I think Trump knows he's got Trudeau beat he also knows Canada is a very important ally we share NORAD ah we have a lot of crossover business a lot of Canadians on property here in the US a lot of Americans vacation a Canada we share a multi thousand mile border though I think Trump knows they got to jab each other a little bit but he also needs to Benny to eventually get along whether it's you know or a treat or anybody else what about Q's pics of the inside of Air Force One so what the what you know how many reporters have been on Air Force One over the years how many guests have been on Air Force one over the years I have photos of the inside of Air Force One many many people do I did not doesn't mean anything doesn't mean anything um the pragmatist my dad is a 35 plus year naval intelligence officer he says queuing on is nonsense he's right hi dolly I don't I don't listen to Q you're asking me things he says I don't even pay attention to that nonsense all right pragmatist dad is right hey ROC says I love John Cardillo thank you I love you guys as well somebody else what happened to Gavin nothing Gavin is doing great Gavin's a good buddy of mine he's over at conservative review right now and he's still a great friend of the rebel we plan on you know we do some crossover stuff and he's a buddy so he's over there he's doing some great work and there you go how do I say this MVM and the LIRR John I heard you talk about the follies of the Broward sheriff and school board in the wake of Marjory Stoneman Douglas have you heard any more about something being done about them yeah so what's happening now great question is uh the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is looking into sheriff Scott Israel there couldn't they're gonna submit a report to the governor there's also a commission it's seven to ten other sheriff's who are investigating Israel what I'm being told at a Tallahassee by members of our state Senate is that when they submit that report to the governor that reports gonna find a lot of wrongdoing on the part of Scott Israel the sheriff of Broward County at that point the procedure in Florida is the governor will suspend him and the state Senate will move will vote to remove to impeach him and it looks like Scott Israel will be removed from office at least that's what I'm being told right now but we're waiting for that Florida Department of Law Enforcement report could be out any day it was expected an early to mid July so it can come literally literally at any day I do I believe from John nine one nine the intake of heavy metals into the human body is linked to Alzheimer's I am NOT a doctor I have no I politically-incorrect says what effect oh I think tariffs will have I think they're gonna have an amazing effect his Donald Trump is using tariffs as leverage for foreign policy global security policy and economic policy and I think it didn't the day we win we win let's see I went into queue and on research team to do my own research and saw for myself that it's all a con job yeah I don't even want to talk about it it's just not it's so silly to anybody that's have worked on the inside and I come and do a speech of the free Tommy demo on Saturday the 14th of July it's in the UK unfortunately I could not get to the UK on Saturday the 14th I would love to help Tommy Eddie good guy but I'm pretty swamped here with live shows and uh but wouldn't have the time to get over there and do that how do we as rebels use this information safely to serve our cause without being victims of the left harassment from Joshua Sperling well judge for what information do you mean I think get out there on social media post and tweet it but make sure that is not coming from anonymous sources make sure it's not coming from what appears to be conspiracy theory people you know pushing conspiracy detector well Tommy Robinson be said for yeah sure hope so there's a lot of backlash there's a lot of backlash I certainly hope so he should be he never should have been imprisoned in the first place parable for iron Wolverine Donald Trump has the potential to be one of the greatest presidents ever I agree I think Trump love him or hate him I've always been a big supporter is doing more he's doing more has done more and what are we in eighteen months in office has done more than 17 18 months then many other presidents combined in terms of proactivity Trump doesn't love Q Valley uh let's see mm-hmm yeah look a lot on Tommy Robinson I I really I wish I mean I think it's a travesty and I think that is sheer political persecution I truly truly do I think it's Tommy Robinson were going after Christians and I think if Tommy Robinson were doing many other things I don't I I don't think Tommy Robinson would be in jail when Tommy Robinson went after Jews if he went after Christians if he went after your whites Tommy Robinson would be a free man being celebrated Don how do I think tariffs will affect Canada I love Canada but Rodos an idiot I think that the tariffs won't I think the tariffs creating a Canada back off let's face it look at our two collected GDPs Canada TV us the trading partner and a in a national defense partner a lot more than the US needs Canada Trudeau is being obstinate but he's going to start facing a lot of political pressure from your MPs very very soon I believe I believe gone 919 asked me do I think uh they we should run military drills along the border to show a strong present load down the cartel human trafficking absolutely I also think we need to do it to show the Mexican military that were no longer going to deal with their corrupt incursions on a u.s. territory to help the cartels smuggle drugs so yes I do I absolutely do the Ovilus behind John Cardillo tells some people that I'm a page shell the obelisk yeah that's like just a kind of Washington Monument you're reading into this a little too much I just thought where is it over there I just thought it was kind of cool I just thought it was kind of cool no it is not an Illuminati symbol and MD said I hope Scott and the legislature have the guts to move on that involved they will I've already been told by people very close to the governor in the state legislature they once cut is real gone even Democrats want Scott is real gone kryptonite the report is going to be damning I believe he'll be removed from office he should resign first as firing him really damages his ability to get a job down the road Dayton worshipping worshippers have obelisks close by I can assure you I am NOT a Satan work it's just a little decorative piece of stone I'll read too much into it uh yeah the amount of his videos people don't watch him god bless do I think Trump could do something about Trudeau now hey Rach I know I wouldn't want to hurt Oh is a duly elected a leader of a nation and trumpet the duly elected leader of his nation in Canada as a friend and you the Canadian people have to do something back not at the Trump we need to eliminate the gangs that have plagued the streets for years never gonna happen you're never gonna eradicate crime never it's uh there's no panacea there's no zero-tolerance crime has always has been
