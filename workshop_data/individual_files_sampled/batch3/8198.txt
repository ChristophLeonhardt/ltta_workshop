Martha: AT THIS HOUR PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING HIS WAY BACK TO WASHINGTON AFTER VISITING WITH SURVIVORS OF THE SANTA FE TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING. TOUGH DUTY IN A PLACE THAT IS STILL MORNING. NOTICEABLY ABSENT WAS HIS WIFE MELANIA TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN RECUPERATING AT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT WHEN SHE HAS BEEN OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE IT HAS SPARKED SOME RUMORS. THE RESPONSE THAT SHE GAVE THIS WEEK. I SEE THE MEDIA IS WORKING OVERTIME SPECULATING WHERE I AM AND WHAT I AM DOING PAID REST ASSURED I AM AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH MY FAMILY FEELING GREAT AND WORKING HARD ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MY NEXT GUEST ARGUES THAT WE SHOULD BE RALLYING BEHIND THE FIRST LADY TO SUPPORT HER ANTI-BULLYING INITIATIVE WRITING THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE A SHAME, BUT ALSO HURTFUL TO STUDENTS EVERYWHERE OF PARTISANSHIP THWARTS THE FIRST LADY'S ADMIRABLE EFFORT TO REJECT BULLYING AND TO CHOOSE THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR. HERE NOW ELAINE BENNETT, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE BEST FRIEND FOUNDATION, A NONPROFIT ON THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING OF ADOLESCENCE, AS WE ALL KNOW IS AT THE CORE OF SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. SHE GETS A HARD TIME FROM SOME CORNERS, MELANIA TRUMP, AND DEFINITELY GAVE OUT A WONDERFUL SPEECH STARTING THIS ORGANIZATION THAT SHE IS DOING CALLED BE BEST, WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE LISTEN TO HER? IT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS AFFECTING OUR CHILDREN NATIONWIDE. WE AT THE BEST FRIEND FOUNDATION SEE THIS ISSUE OF BULLYING AS A SERIOUS ONE. AND ONE THAT IS LEADING INTO INCREASED YOUTH VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS, AND WE THINK THE CURRENT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. ALSO HAVE A BASIS IN EARLY ON BULLYING. AND THE FACT THAT PEERS ARE TREATING EACH OTHER BADLY. Martha: WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THESE CASES AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE SHOOTER IN PARKLAND, TO AS THE STORY CAME OUT TO THAT HE WAS SPURRED BY THE GIRL THAT HE LIKED. AND I KNOW THIS AS A PARENT, IT IS SO MAGNIFIED IN THE AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ON YOUR PHONE IS JUST HAPPIER THAN HARRY, HAVING A GREAT TIME, THEY HAVE A PERFECT BOYFRIEND, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE. AND THAT PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THESE SITUATIONS. IT DOESN'T IT? THAT IS RIGHT, ADOLESCENCE IS A TOUGH TIME, ADOLESCENCE TYPICALLY GET THEIR SENSE OF SELF, WHO THEY ARE FROM HOW THEY ARE TREATED AT SCHOOL. WHAT THEY ARE THOUGHT OF AT SCHOOL. HOW OTHERS LOOK AT THEM. THEY CAN HAVE A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY, AND GO TO SCHOOL AND BE TREATED BADLY, OR BE TOLD THAT THEY ARE DUMB, OR THEY ARE A JERK OR A NERD, AND THAT GOES TO THEIR HEARTS, THAT GOES TO THEIR PSYCHE. AND IN SOME CASES, IT CAN CREATE INTENSE RAGE. THAT CAN EVEN LEAD, IT CAN LEAD TO DESTRUCTION, IT CAN LEAD TO VIOLENCE. Martha: KNOW THAT YOU RUN A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE GETTING TO SEE THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS ACROSS THE BOARD. I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT AND OF THE FIRST LADY WHO SAY THAT TO BULLYING AND SOCIAL MEDIA BULLYING WHEN THEY LOOK AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING, THAT THEY THINK THAT THERE IS SOME IRONY IN THAT AND THAT THAT DIMINISHES HER MESSAGE. IT DOES NOT DIMINISH HER MESSAGE, HER MESSAGE IS HER MESSAGE, SHE IS TAKING ON A TOUGH TOPIC. IN THE PAST, OTHER FIRST LADIES HAVE HAD INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN EMBRACED FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, AND WE IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOUGH TOPIC. AND WE SALUTE MELANIA TRUMP. FOR THE FACT THAT SHE HAS OCCURRED SHOULD TO TAKE IT ON. SHE IS A MOTHER, AND SHE HAS BEEN CYBER BULLIED, HER SON HAS BEEN CYBER BULLIED. SHE KNOWS HOW PAINFUL THAT CAN BE, AND SHE IS TRYING TO START A PROGRAM THAT I THINK HAS A GREAT MISSION. WHICH IS TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO BE THE BEST. BE BEST, WE HAVE THE BEST FRIENDS PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON, WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED STOP THE SILENCE, PREVENT THE VIOLENCE. WE HAVE SEEN CHANGES. AND OUR STUDENTS ARE TELLING US THAT IN THEIR EVALUATIONS.
