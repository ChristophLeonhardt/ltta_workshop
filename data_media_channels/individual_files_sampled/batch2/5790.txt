we will impeach him but he's doing a great job doesn't matter remember that line he's doing a great job that doesn't matter will it beat you it is a hell of a place in Washington good morning and welcome to am joy wealth been quite a week in our dystopian national reality show and next we could actually get even worse for Donald Trump Bob Woodward's tea spilling book fear officially drops on Tuesday meeting more damning excerpts flooding the media he obsessively consumes an ongoing witch-hunt for the anonymous New York Times op-ed writer which has administration officials throwing each other under every a passing bus and of course the return of trumps biggest nemesis the popular charismatic 44th President of the United States Barack Obama to the campaign trail just in time for the midterms we'll have more on Bob Woodward and the White House meltdown later in the show but perhaps the most consequential thing happening right now for all Americans especially if you're a woman an immigrant a person of color or someone who believes the president should not be above the law is the battle for over Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Republicans are confident they have the votes to confirm him despite serious questions raised by Democrats in the Senate hearings this week but my first guest says that he knew Brett Kavanaugh during his years as a Republican operative and in an op-ed for NBC News think out yesterday he writes I want to tell any senator who cares about our democracy vote no joining me now the author of that off that david brock founder of media matters and chairman of the pack american bridge 21st century david thanks so much for being here good to be with you joy all right let's start out I want to play you a little bit of the opening statement from Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings take a listen a good judge must be an umpire a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy as Justice Kennedy explained in Texas versus Johnson one of his greatest opinions judges do not make decisions to reach a preferred result judges make decisions because the law in the Constitution as we see them compel the result well you write in your op-ed for NBC News think Brett actually that that's not true but Brett actually makes a cameo appearance in your memoir of your time in the GOP blinded by the write you write I describe him at a party full of zealous Young Conservatives gathered to watch President Bill Clinton's 1998 State of the Union address just weeks after the story of his affair with a White House intern it broken when the TV camera panned to Hillary Clinton I saw Brett at a tie at that time a key lieutenant of Ken Starr the Independent Counsel investigating various Linton scandals mouth the word rhymes with which tell me about Brett Kavanaugh how did you know him and what was he like as I say I was I was part of a a small close circle of young ambitious conservatives who were being groomed for future jobs in government and politics and media and Brett Kavanaugh was part of that group and that's how I knew him I knew him professionally because at the time I was a conservative myself he was working for the star investigation I was working on a conservative magazine we were both part of an anti Clinton movement and I also knew him socially as I described in in that anecdote there what we're all watching the State of the Union and he does mount that word so when I saw just that clip you just saw I mean I was watching just like everybody else was and he described himself as neutral arbiter and stressing his independence and saying he's an umpire I know he's no umpire he's straight out of right field and tell me about some of the other people who are in that circle is you write about a group of people a lot of whom are pretty well known in the media who was among the circle that Cavanaugh traveled in sure so many of them quite prominent today Alex azar is the current Health and Human Services Secretary he was working in the star investigation at the time Barbara Comstock was a an investigator on the House committee really zealously going after the Clintons she's currently a member of Congress from Virginia there are media personalities like Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham from Fox everyone knows Matt Drudge this was the circle and the point here I think is that I knew Brett as a partisan here his representation of himself now in black robes it's just it's just not who he is I know who he was and he was just like we were engaged in partisan politics partisan war he is in his bones a Republican operative and I think there are a couple things that I point out in this piece that I think show him to be really unfit for this office one is his role as the kind of the point man for leaking when he was in the Starr investigation leaking information to the press now that's something that a prosecutor doesn't typically do it's kind of a pourraient behavior for a prosecutor but they were engaged in a partisan political move against the Clintons in that investigation so they were strategically leaking he played a role there you know the Vince Foster investigation Vince Foster committed suicide he was the White House lawyer was a friend of Hillary Clinton's that investigation was closed by the first Special Counsel when Ken Starr took over at Brett Kavanaugh as urging they reopened that case they spent a year and a half and millions of dollars terrorizing the foster family for not to conclude again that he had committed suicide and and wasted all that time and money on a political smear campaign and then the third thing is the Paul Jones case now I played a role originally in bringing Paul Jones to light when I was a conservative journalist so I was really in the thick of that case and there were a group of front lawyers for Paula Jones but then there were a group of lawyers behind the scenes and we called them the elves they were doing the real work and those elves were conservative Federalist Society lawyers just like Brett was and I wasn't a lawyer but I was an honorary member of the Federalist Society and I was involved in all this and there was a conduit of information going from the paula jones lawsuit folks as they were gathering information and identifying witnesses to the star investigation through George Conway who happens to be Kellyanne Conway's and to Brett Kavanaugh and in that way the Starr investigation was tipped off to the information from the Paula Jones case and they use that to set a perjury crap for Bill Clinton and I will say that George Conway has responded to that allegation that you made that they were trying to funnel information from the Jones lawsuit into the Starr investigation he ride he rides brought rock as a fabulous and what he says here as far as it involves me is false in the 90s I barely knew Kavanagh and I never spoke to him again I never spoke to him when he was working for Starr let alone about the Jones case your response to that well you know joy I've been I've been speaking out and writing about my experiences in the conservative movement for a number of years now when I think that I had relevant information as I think I do now and nobody successfully challenged anything I've ever said George Conway concedes in that tweet that he knew Brett Kavanaugh I had multiple conversations Brett with George Conway about exactly what he was doing about his attempt to manipulate the Starr investigation with the information he had from the Paul Jones case and so I know what I know he has a set of alternative facts and lastly unto you David Brock you say here that any senator who cares about the country should vote no on Cavanaugh is that simply because you believe him to be partisan or is there something more damning about him that you believe makes him unfit to sit on the Supreme Court well what I think it is my piece is not about his views one can have a debate about what his views are my key my piece is about his behavior and it's about his character and I think on that basis behaving as a political partisan wallet prosecutor while he's supposed to be a dispassionate arbiter of facts acting as a partisan warrior the same with the Jones case so I think it's a pattern I think it shows really poor behavior for what you would want in a Supreme Court justice and that's why I say vote no and you believe he lied when he claimed that he is just a neutral collar of balls and strikes as a judge yes he's completely misrepresenting himself and as you know as the hearings ended there was some exposure of other things that he lied about some of the documents came out from the Bush years you know we don't have millions of documents but some of the emails that did come out show he lied in his first confirmation hearing so yeah there's a pattern there too I'm out of time with you but I have to really quickly ask you if you had all this information why not come forward so you can have the opportunity to testify during those hearings well you know when when Brett was first nominated I it occurred to me that obviously I had had this friendship with him it really wasn't joy till I saw him up there testifying as the neutral arbiter as the umpire as independent that I got I got upset about it and I remembered and it all came back to me about who he actually was and that's why I decided to be public this week all right well I thank you for your time David Brock appreciate it thank you thank you I want to bring in my panel now MSNBC political analyst or Leena Maxwell Ellie missed all editor of above the law calm in Washington Post columnist EJ Dione I'm gonna just go around the panel and get all of your reactions EJ you're at a disadvantage you're not at the table of us so let me start with you first your reaction to David Brock's claims about Brett Kavanaugh well I think it's indisputable that he was a partisan Republican operative and that he is an ideologue these aren't and these aren't disputable facts at all and I think that you see how hypocritical this whole process is when you think back to Merrick garland yes we should think back to the blockade of Merrick garland if this were just about thoughtful people calling balls and strikes the Republicans would have confirmed Merrick garland whom Cavanaugh himself went out of his way to say was a really good and honorable judge no they want an ideological majority on the Supreme Court why because they want to use the court as the last line of defense if progressives ever take power again and you're seeing a period of conservative judicial activism they went after liberal judicial activism for years on the right conservative judicial action activism that has among other things gutted the Voting Rights Act gotten it really weakens our campaign finance laws has have undercut regulation that's the kind of Court they want Kavanaugh wouldn't be there if he weren't a conservative ideologue and Senator Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski really have to think hard about that before they cast their votes you know it occurs to me Zerlina that a lot of this is bit of a scale of a sham people get up and they say I just call balls and strike it all have a script starry decisis they dress saying that over and over and over again I believe in precedent no one's being honest about their actual views and this kind of background you know that he was in what David Brock does describes as a cold cynical and ambitious set of hard right operatives being groomed by GOP elders for much bigger roles in politics government and media Queen Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson that is what is being seated on this court absolutely and you know just a day after Serena Williams smashing the US Open I would say that umpires are not neutral arbitrary points and just calling balls and strikes I think that premise is actually ridiculous they actually are impacting the outcome so in this particular context though he's now on record as lying twice and his confirmation hearings he pretended to not know what the Federalist Society is yeah and he acted like he had never heard what cazza was fencing Torrez a three minutes yeah as a law firm when all of us know what that law firm is is because it was the president's personal attorney and so I think its credibility on a number of different fronts is completely obliterated by his performance which the bar was so low all he really needed to go do was be reasonable in these hearings and he couldn't even do that and I think what Democrats showed this week is that they actually are willing to fight for the rights that will be lost if he is confirmed by releasing the appropriate documents and as you said to expose the Sham that is this hearing in the first place but it's not just the hearing innocence Ellie you know I almost feel that it's very hard to have faith in the idea of the Supreme Court if it is just a super version of the house right if it is just a ultra partisan Republicans versus Democrats body and Republicans have shown this week that they're willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that they alone get to seat those justices and that they can have a ZJ DeLand describe a far-right court even as the country is trending in the other direction this is what the Conservatives this is their plan the fellow of society which claims to love institutions is actually actively trying to drag the Supreme Court as an institution down into the muck with Congress look everything that Brock has set and by the way kudos to David Rock for putting his name on it because that's how truth comes out so thanks for that but everything that Brock has been saying everything that we've been saying are great reasons not to confirm Cavanaugh Cavanaugh should be impeached from the DC Circuit because he lied twice to Congress in his testimony in 2004 and 2006 we cannot have a judge not beyond the Supreme Court judge we should not have drudges judges that have issues with their truthfulness credibility and candor when when talking to Congress the Feller Society argument against him lying was that well he didn't he might have lied it wasn't legally perjury you know he wasn't precise he's it too much to ask that a Supreme Court justice it's precise in his testimony in front of Congress I don't think so he's lied about he's lied about his involvement of things he has been involved in the spying issue and he claims to not know that they were stolen documents even though the emails say spying in the in the top there is more and I just want to go through really quickly there he is he has been on email change and has been shown that he's been on email chains where racist jokes have been bandied about he said nothing he took no stand he was silent on that again the ideology aside he refuses to answer questions about tortures he refuses to answer questions about trumps whether or not Trump can be indicted these are these are offenses okay and there and again from a confirmation perspective his stance on abortion is enough to I think not confirm them but from a judicial institution perspective how can we have a person on a DC Circuit who cannot tell the truth in front of Congress if he can't be impeach from the DC Circuit the next thing that needs to happen is that people try to disbar him from his position in in DC and after we get through all that we can have a vote on hoth and we are out of time but EJ the sad the sort of sad reality is that none of that will happen because Republicans are determined I mean Donald Trump has put all sorts of people and he's put you know blog there's all sorts of people and they're confirming them all there's been one who's gone down because of overt racism and that's it I mean Republicans are just gonna give Trump whatever judges he wants right well that's where Murkowski and Collins are so important I mean they were willing to buck their party on in defending Obamacare and that was very important they do not seem willing on something incredibly consequential for two decades as Kelly Inc for decades as Kellyanne Conway said this is something they really have to sit back on because they claim to be for open bipartisan processes and what we've seen with their parties handling of documents and the like there's nothing bipartisan about these hearings and we should remember I believe that Cavanaugh used to prepare people to walk this this gauntlet and tell them what to do which is don't tell anybody the truth about your beliefs you train people to do it and he seems to well neat it's close to getting away we'll see what happens next week there will be a vote we'll see jay-z Lena and Egypt we back with us le miss Tom thank you very much really appreciate you being here what next Dec enough next the White House described as crazy
