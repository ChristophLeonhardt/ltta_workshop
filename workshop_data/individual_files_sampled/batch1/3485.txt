we never had a doubt and Donald Trump never had a doubt that he was going to win from the time I met him in 2011 has had exactly the same politics the same stuff he heard from Trump you saw on the campaign trail hi I'm Joshua Greene I'm the author of the new book devil's bargain Steve Bannon Donald Trump and the storming of the presidency Bannon is a fascinating character he kind of came out of nowhere he's from a Navy family in Richmond Virginia he served in the Navy he kind of basically talked his way into Harvard Business School and a job at Goldman Sachs after Goldman Sachs he started his own boutique investment bank Bannen and company and he was trying to broker a sale I think of Castle Rock Entertainment which owned the rights to Seinfeld he's trying to broker a sale between Westinghouse and Ted Turner and when Turner got to the table it turned out he was a little short of cash and rather than let the deal fall apart van and his partners agreed to take residuals and five television shows including Seinfeld in exchange for their cash fee at the time signed feels like an exec N'Dour third season wasn't a big deal van was going to run to the litter as we all know it became a hit and he has since made I think about two two and a half million dollars vannin had actually spent about a year in the mid 2000 in Hong Kong is the CEO of this bizarre video game company the company didn't actually make video games what it did was try to profit from something called gold mining where you have players go into these games win gold and special armor and prizes and then go sell it to gamers in the real world so they can kind of cheat and skip ahead a couple of levels this is a serious business it was actually backed by Goldman Sachs but it crashed and went bankrupt the cause the gamers themselves who weren't cheating became enraged basically that these other people were doing they put so much pressure on the gaming companies the gamers organized themselves on these like world of warcraft message boards they put so much pressure on the video game companies but they decided to basically ban gold farming which killed bannon's the business but it awakened him to the power of what he called ruthless white males who spend all their time online and five years later when Fannin wound up at Breitbart he resolved to try and attract those people over to Breitbart because he thought they could be rad a lot radicalized and kind of populist nationalist way in the way that Bannon did that the bridge between the angry abuse of gamers and Breitbart and Pepe was mildly innopolis who Bannon discovered on hired to be Breitbart stack editor from the time I met him in 2011 has had exactly the same politics the same stuff you heard from Trump he's on a campaign trail what he was looking for was a vessel because nobody in Republican Washington believed in these kinds of ideas the whole trend in the Republican Party was toward liberalized the immigration laws passing comprehensive immigration reform he was against it very big into the idea of populism and Palin did emerge from the 2008 election is kind of the populist Tea Party champion so originally Palin went to Bannon and said hey you're a filmmaker you're a conservative guy would you shoot some commercials for me some kind of videos and Bannen as he is prone to do got whipped into a frenzy went up spending about a million dollars of his own money to produce this elaborate Palin documentary called the undefeated which he thought was going to be Palin's vehicle to run for the president in fact the first time I ever traveled with ban and Palin was to Pella Iowa to debut that film everybody in the national media was there Andrew Breitbart was there Sarah Palin was there because we all thought that this was the wink wink launch of the Sarah Palin for president campaign in 2012 but when that thing kind of crashed on the launch pad been and moved on to other people and eventually wound up the Trump you
