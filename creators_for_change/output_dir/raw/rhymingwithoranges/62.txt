00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,750
controversy let's have a chat about this

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,460
and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it says about YouTube as a</font>

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,490
medium shall we let's go on my blog came

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,639
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the red</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hot dead tree press last</font>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,949
week and basically kind of ironically

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,320
actually broke the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet everybody</font>

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,270
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit crazy had an</font>

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,039
existential crisis and was like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,570
god what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this say about the world</font>

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,580
as a whole that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zoe is on the front</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> page</font>

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,949
of magazine and there's a whole magazine

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,340
dedicated to people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> do makeup</font>

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,880
tutorials well I have mixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> feelings</font>

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,670
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but I surprisingly I think</font>

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,980
that it's overwhelmingly positive oh my

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,780
vlog seems to be positioning itself as

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,140
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Smash Hitz but for vlogging if</font>

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,480
you remember what Smash Hitz is first of

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">all you're old and you should probably</font>

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop watching YouTube now and get back</font>

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,690
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> secondly you will see the</font>

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,820
similarities like they're basically the

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,680
same thing come on now I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,350
world lost its in two very distinct

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,339
forms when my blog revealed itself to us

28
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,650
first of all it was those of us who are

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,530
content creators and I for<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I'm kind</font>

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,990
of sick of the fact that mainstream and

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,630
traditional and that includes dead tree

32
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,600
media they kind of have this perception

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,030
of people who vlog as a very specific

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,479
cooker cookie cutter person they will do

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,159
challenge videos prank videos like blogs

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,509
about how many brushes they use for

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,280
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup and what's beautiful about</font>

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,140
YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's amazing about YouTube is</font>

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,390
that there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who have millions</font>

40
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and millions of subscribers and views</font>

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,400
who just unboxings and there's videos of

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,770
people teaching you how to learn like

43
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,200
Japanese and there's videos of people

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,710
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about politics and social issues</font>

45
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey and when I saw this it wasn't so</font>

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,880
much anger and resentment it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,549
the fact I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh like forgotten like</font>

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,390
this is it's lazy it's pretty lazy and

49
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,630
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perpetuate the</font>

50
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,100
idea that everybody who put something on

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is the kind of creative</font>

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on this front page and a vlogger</font>

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,360
is a particular type of person who makes

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,150
this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of come to</font>

55
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,299
and we're not if you're a vlogger then

56
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,310
you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of things it's</font>

57
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,900
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you're a writer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

58
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,319
write Shakespeare you might write fifty

59
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,939
shades of<font color="#E5E5E5"> grey like there is a huge</font>

60
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">fiction with the kind of content that we</font>

61
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
end up creating then mainstream media

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,590
kind of started freaking out and they

63
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,459
were like oh my god so ella was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font>

64
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,590
Great British Bake Off she made it into

65
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,790
my living room and now she's on the

66
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,709
front page of a magazine everybody panic

67
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,620
panic and it's like bro chill your kids

68
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,409
obsessed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this girl she's really</font>

69
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:46,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">really popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she's</font>

70
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,280
on Great British Bake Off that's the

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,709
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they all bought her book and</font>

72
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,090
that's the reason she's being put on the

73
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">front page of not actually just this</font>

74
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,989
magazine but loads and loads of

75
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,239
magazines she's huge what's also

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,040
particularly amazing about on my blog is

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,420
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time that</font>

78
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,540
traditional media has been shaped<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

79
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,530
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it is even made in the</font>

80
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,920
past it was gatekeepers so like the

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,099
publishers and the TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> producers who</font>

82
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,209
decided you are going to be popular

83
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,769
people are going to care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your love</font>

84
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,970
life I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take photos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

85
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">bomb in a thong and we were kind of</font>

86
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,650
convinced by tabloid press and by news

87
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,010
coverage and by the glossy magazines

88
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,949
that this was stuff that we should care

89
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,769
about and we bought it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that</font>

90
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,599
we cared about this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

91
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,159
these media outlets thought that we

92
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,449
should care about what's happened

93
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,709
without my blog is that the mainstream

94
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,120
media has kind of gotten done to the

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,349
fact that loads and loads of people love

96
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people loads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people like these</font>

97
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,590
creators it's not like what they used to

98
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,470
do is like they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide all</font>

99
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,180
you should all care about Peter Andre

100
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,819
sex life we decided before mainstream

101
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,669
media did that we liked these guys and

102
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:12,609
yeah they're all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same management</font>

103
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,229
company they're all with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gleam futures</font>

104
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,500
and they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> have very similar cookie</font>

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,380
cutter low growl content like fine

106
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,169
whatever we're all not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

107
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,900
like John Oliver or<font color="#E5E5E5"> PBS idea Channel but</font>

108
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,700
in the past

109
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,400
would have seen mainstream media say you

110
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,250
should care about Peter Andre and his

111
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,210
abs and his sex life here<font color="#E5E5E5"> consume a</font>

112
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,980
reality TV show about him consume

113
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,170
magazines that have him his his face on

114
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,630
them and this is the complete opposite

115
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,520
this is audience is deciding what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,460
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the traditional</font>

117
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,200
gatekeepers being like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh god we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

118
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,730
make something about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and I</font>

119
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,520
feel that that shows the amount of power

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,730
that we now have as consumers what we

121
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,880
like is trackable and then the media

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,640
companies have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be reactive to what</font>

123
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,770
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about us based on our consumer</font>

124
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,420
habits rather than them deciding that

125
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Katie Price's boobs are particularly</font>

126
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,630
interesting there is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

127
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,000
thing that is negative about on my vlog

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,820
that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch on based on an</font>

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,740
article<font color="#E5E5E5"> in The Independent by my good</font>

130
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,350
fellow<font color="#CCCCCC"> maya lamented the fact that these</font>

131
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,650
guys being the face of UK and global

132
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,920
youtubing and none of them are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

133
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,780
color none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

134
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,130
minority backgrounds um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

135
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,110
sucks a little bit because the

136
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,270
mainstream media has picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on these</font>

137
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys and that's because glean futures</font>

138
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
are a particularly good management

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,630
company more than anything right but

140
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,130
they picked up on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and these</font>

popular but then those of our like<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid</font>

143
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially in the UK those of our really</font>

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,600
really popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> bloggers who are from</font>

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,420
like black Asian and minority ethnic

146
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,550
backgrounds have kind of been ignored

147
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,060
from the mainstream media focus on

148
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,700
YouTube as a creative industry you very

149
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">rarely see stuff about ksi that could be</font>

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,850
because he's a particularly

151
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,130
controversial figure you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rarely see</font>

152
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,470
stuff about people like Sully breaks

153
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,070
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> patricia bright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess Jamal</font>

154
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,950
Edwards from<font color="#CCCCCC"> SB TV has kind of like had</font>

155
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,800
his moment in the spotlight but these

156
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,300
people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of end up getting glossed</font>

157
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,400
over in favor of these white and

158
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,950
