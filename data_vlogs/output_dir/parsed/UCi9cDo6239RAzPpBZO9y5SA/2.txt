what is it that ends?
a little of your own medicine
Do not come and look for me
what do you see I'm not going to answer you
now they are things in life
know that everything has its end
do not come to cry me, that's why
today I have given my phone
not to call you
not to call you
not to call you
today i left my phone
not to call you
not to call you
to forget you
a missed call, easy to forget
you can keep on, keep on giving me
you can follow, keep lying to me
I will not continue, keep believing you
I want to be calm, let me breathe
I upload a picture once you look at it
but so you will suffer...
for your lies
today i left my phone
not to call you
not to call you
not to call you
today i left my phone
not to call you
not to call you
to forget you
Only when it rains are you looking for me
only with the cold you get scared
You know your strength is asking for forgiveness
you know that deep down I'm right
today i left my phone
not to call you
not to call you
not to call you
today i left my phone
not to call you
not to call you
only to forget you
