are there any Senators in the chamber wishing to vote or wishing to change their vote if not on this vote the yeas are 81 the nays are 18 three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative the motion is agreed to cloture having been invoked the motion to refer fail Falls mr. president senator from Maryland Thank You mr. president first let me tell you how pleased I am the people Maryland that we are now in the process of ending this government shutdown the government shutdown does not benefit anyone certainly doesn't benefit the federal workers who live in Maryland and the federal workers around the nation they the uncertainty that that shutdown brings those that are exempted or asked to work without knowing when they would get a paycheck those that are on furlough don't know whether it'll ever get a paycheck or not it's not in the interests of our federal workforce it's certainly not in the interests of federal contractors who depend upon contracts that have been put on suspension it's not in the interests of the public who depend upon governmental services and it ends up costing taxpayers more money so mr. mr. president I'm pleased to see that we're on path to end this is a shutdown to get government back up and a path forward I also am pleased that we've at least accelerated by two weeks the deadline for getting a budget done many of us have expressed major concern about continuing to operate under a continuing resolution that makes no sense we heard from the Department of Defense that they cannot keep our country safe or in continuing resolutions we know that agencies when they're trying to plan their mission cannot operate on continuing resolutions for the public continuing resolutions state that we're going to operate on last year's budget it doesn't reflect this year's or it doesn't reflect this year's priorities and that's what we should be doing every year so in this case the Republicans controlled the House the Senate and the White House we would think that a budget could have been done by October 1 which is when the fiscal year began October 1 of last year we're now approaching four months under the FY 18 budget and we still don't have a budget so one of the parts that I am pleased about as we move forward we've had real I think positive discussions that by the February the 8th day it's realistic to expect that we're going to be able to enact budget numbers so that the Appropriations Committee can recommend to the full chamber and we can pass appropriation bills our Crom the bus or an omnibus that will allow our agencies to have full year appropriations or I should say the remainder of this year's appropriations and I certainly hope that will include FY 19 that would certainly be the best and that it will be balanced balanced between the needs of the department of defense and the non-defense agencies we have critical functions that require to have a full year of appropriations for including our National Defense Department defense our state department the Department of Health and the work that's done in National Institutes of Health the food safety and the Federal Drug Administration the ability of the Social Security Administration to deliver checks to our seniors and to take care of our health care needs all that requires that we have the predictability of a budget so I'm pleased that we were able during this debate I wasn't pleased we had a shutdown but I'm pleased that during this debate we had great discussions among Democrats and Republicans that we are committed to bringing out a budget by February the 8th so that we can again that type of predictability to the people of this country that was one of the principal frustrations that many of us didn't want to go for another continuing resolution without knowing how we're going to deal with the budget there are some special needs that we've had a particular attention to that we really also need to get done by no later than February of the 8th one of that is the opioid funding OPM funding clearly it's in our national interest to recognize that we have a national crisis every community in the country is suffering from the opioid crisis and we need to make sure that we give the wherewithal for the federal government to be a strong partner in dealing with this crisis many of my colleagues have talked about disaster relief we certainly need to give a help to the communities of Texas and Florida the the puerto rico the wildfires of West we we know that we've got to get that done now we can't wait another month let us make sure that by no later than February the 8th we've also dealt with that issue I'm pleased in the legislation that we're considering now that we will deal with the Children's Health Insurance Program I wish it was permanent rather than putting another deadline on the the program we should try to make this permanent it's been bipartisan success program in all of our states and the children's health insurance program needs a further attention for permanency however the legislation that we're in process of passing does not deal with community health centers that we know that most of our children parents that you are using the chip program are going to be using health centers we need to extend and the programs for our health centers there are a lot of extenders out there mr. president we need to act on one just to mention one the one that I've been interested in and have authored legislation that deals with the therapy caps therapy caps mean that those who have the most serious needs for therapy services those suffering from stroke those type of injuries are not able to get the full services or at least threatened not able to get the full services because of a therapy cat we've extended it ever since we put it into law it should never been put into law the caps but we also need to pay attention to it in this in this budget debate and that also needs to be dealt with by February the 8th my colleagues we brought up serious of pension issues that affect workers in this country that needs to be addressed so there's reason to say that I'm pleased that the government's back up or will be back up shortly but we really need to negotiate and not operate under continuing resolutions I think the amount of spotlight that's been put on this issues we have a much better chance to get to these budget issues resolved through appropriations or akram the bus or an omnibus rather than another continuing resolution and then mr. mr. president it there is the issue of the dreamers that I have talked about numerous times on the floor of the United States Senate the dreamer issue is urgent it's urgent many dreamers lives have already been affected and their lives have been changed as a result of President Trump's announcement last September putting a six-month time limit on when the dreamers would be subject to deportation that deadline occurs early March but in the meantime those that are up for a renewal status there's been uncertainty as to whether they will be able to continue to reside here in America that they'll be able to continue to have a driver's license or work they feel like they have and they do have a date on the fact that they're of their their body is saying that they expire on a particular date that anxiety needs to end it should never have been started under President Trump Sadek in September but we need to respond to that in an urgent way so I was very pleased that we have a commitment from the majority leader that by no later than February the 8th if we have not passed the bipartisan daca protection dreamer protection bill that we will have that bill on the floor of the United States Senate in a manner in which the majority of that the Senate can speak and I'm very confident that the compromise that had been negotiated was with Senator Graham and Senator Durbin we will be able to pass that bill that would protect the dreamers yes it does what it does is it allows the dreamer status to maintain them puts them in a pay way so they can have permanent citizenship here in the United States and they know that their future is America after all it's the only country that most know so that is certainly a very encouraging sign I was also very pleased to hear and the negotiations that took place that that legislation would also provide the protection for those that are here in temporary protective status president Trump in some of the cases has extended dates and said this is the last extension that could expire within the next 18 months in some cases he's deferred making that decision for some countries what we know about those in temporary protective status they're very similar to the dreamers that many know no country but the United States is their home and it's important that we protect their status here in the United States and provide them a pathway for permanency and citizenship here in the United States they are part of America and they are part of our economy in the mean time mr. president I would hope that there would be consensus here and support from the White House that the enforcement procedures that are being used against the immigrant community is mindful of the efforts being made here to provide them a permanent status and that the a mess this is the first 19
