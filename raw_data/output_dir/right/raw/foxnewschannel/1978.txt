00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:05,158
BUT FIRST, WHEN #MeToo BECOMES

2
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:06,092
HE TOO.

3
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,261
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:09,662
ANGLE.

5
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:12,532
JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER THE

6
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,266
NEW YORKER BROKE ITS STORY

7
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,135

ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC

9
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:18,371
SCHNEIDERMAN WITH ABUSING FOUR

10
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:19,939
WOMEN, HE RESIGNED HIS OFFICE.

11
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,909
NOW ISN'T IT RICH THAT HE SET

12
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:25,578
HIMSELF UP AS THE HERO OF THE

13
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:27,680
#MeToo MOVEMENT BY USING HIS

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,284
OFFICE TO SUE HARVEY WEINSTEIN?

15
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:32,952
>> WOMEN WERE COERCED INTO

MISCONDUCT, SOMETIMES THEY WERE

18
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:37,957
TARGETS THEMSELVES.

19
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:41,161
IF THEY REFUSED THEY WERE

20
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,562
THREATENED.

21
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:43,430
THEY KNEW HOW PERVASIVE IT WAS

22
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,131
AND NOT ONLY DID THEY FAIL TO

23
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,499
STOP IT, THEY ENABLED IT AND

24
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:47,767
COVERED IT UP.

25
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,502
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING AS

26
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,604
DESPICABLE AS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

27
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:52,539
HERE.

28
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,307
>> Laura: I GUESS IT TAKES ONE

29
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:55,575
TO NO ONE.

30
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:56,209
SCHNEIDERMAN WAS ALSO THE

00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:57,644
DARLING OF THE ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA

32
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:01,014
AND FELLOW DEMS FOR CHALLENGING

33
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:03,383
DONALD TRUMP'S NEARLY EVERY MOVE

DONALD TRUMP'S NEARLY EVERY MOV

35
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,150
MOVE.

00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,530
IT WENT ON AND ON.

42
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,500
IF SCHNEIDERMAN QUICKLY BECAME A

43
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,402
CHAMPION OF THE LEFT RESISTANCE,

44
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:23,470
A KIND OF SUPERHERO, WHICH WAS

45
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,306
HOW COMEDIAN AND FAN GIRL

46
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,274
SAMANTHA BEE ATTEMPTED TO FRAME

47
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:29,275

00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:32,946
OF HER SHOW.

49
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:38,952
>> OH, MY GOD, .

50
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,887
>> SCHNEIDERMAN, SCHNEIDERMAN.

51
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,288
>> YOU WERE GOING TO SAVE US.

52
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,190
>> WE ARE GOING TO DO IT BUT

53
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,159
THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF PEOPLE

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,727
OTHER THAN STATE

55
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:48,328
ATTORNEY GENERAL GETTING

56
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:48,795
ENGAGED.

57
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:49,562
>> Laura: DEPENDS ON WHAT

58
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:52,799
GETTING ENGAGED MEANS.

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,969
NEXT TIME, SAMANTHA, BUT BE

60
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:56,336
CAREFUL.

61
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:57,604
THAT'S SO BAD.

62
00:01:57,604 --> 00:01:59,305
DID WE REALLY WRITE THAT?

63
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:00,607
NEXT TIME DO A BETTER JOB

64
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:05,378
CHOOSING YOUR SUPERHEROES.

65
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:07,247
I'VE GOT TO SAY, HE DID LIKE TO

00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:08,146
DRESS UP APPARENTLY, SO MAYBE

67
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:10,717
THIS SUPERHERO THING DOES WORK.

68
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,951
WHILE HE TRIES TO EXPLAIN AWAY

69
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,254
THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM THIS

70
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:16,289
WAY, HE SAID IN THE PRIVACY OF

71
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:16,956
INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS I'VE

72
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:19,959
ENGAGED IN ROLE-PLAYING AND

73
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:20,627
OTHER CONSENSUAL ACTIVITY.

74
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:23,763
I HAVE NOT ASSAULTED ANYONE.

75
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:27,934
SUPERMAN DIDN'T BEAT THE HELL

76
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:30,136
