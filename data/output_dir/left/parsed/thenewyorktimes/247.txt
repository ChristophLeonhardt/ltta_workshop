The snow monkeys of
Japan live further north
than any other
nonhuman primate.
And one troop has become
downright famous
because they’re the only
monkeys in the world
to spend hours in the winter
soaking in hot springs.
Only recently, scientists
have started investigating
the behavior of the macaques.
But before we get to that,
here’s a brief history
of how a group of macaques
developed the hot tub habit
in the first place.
Macaques live all over Japan.
But this group’s
home is near Nagano,
where the winter temperatures
are often below freezing,
but the landscape is sprinkled
with natural hot springs.
But it wasn’t until 1963,
so the story goes, that a monkey
first joined human visitors
in a hotel bathing pool.
Of course, one macaque in the pool
soon became many macaques,
which upset the humans.
The solution: build a park
and hot spring bathing pools
just for the monkeys.
Happy monkeys, happy humans.
The macaques soon
became an attraction,
drawing more attention
and more visitors
to the mountains of Nagano.
Back to the present.
Researchers are now
focusing on why the monkeys bathe.
Probably to stay warm,
but that’s just an assumption.
Since cold causes stress,
increasing levels of hormones
called glucocorticoids,
scientists tested levels of
these hormones in the monkeys.
They didn’t draw blood
or collect saliva.
They collected and tested feces.
And since the monkeys
are so used to human tourists,
they paid no attention
to the researchers.
As suspected, stress levels
were lower during periods
when the macaques were bathing.
Interestingly, the
higher-ranking females
had more access to the pool
and more time bathing.
Takeshita herself found a kind of
nonscientific inspiration
in the monkey bathing.
Many times after coming
back from the field
I would go
to hot springs.
They also show
how a small group of animals
can develop a unique behavior,
their own kind of culture,
passed down from
generation to generation.
I wonder what they think
about while they soak.
