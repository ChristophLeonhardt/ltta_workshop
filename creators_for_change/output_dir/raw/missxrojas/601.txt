00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,490
bard catalog which is but it expected to

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,260

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was eight pounds and of what it is</font>

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,369

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,200

paying me 50 thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> pounds whatever to</font>

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,170

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">incredible but it's just lovely and it</font>

18

written it kind of had them moments that

30
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,740
reminded me a little bit of Curious

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,900
Incident of the dog in the night-time

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,460
slightly but his writing stars kind of

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,310
slightly different as well but it was a

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,640
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-written book and very</font>

73
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,500
the fact that John Barrowman said a

they're gonna kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of get rid of her to</font>

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
be honest because I don't want to kill

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,940
her I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> her to become this</font>

86
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,890
really kind of like power woman who

87
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,370
doesn't need the doctor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't want</font>

88
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,850
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall out of love with her and</font>

89
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,500
hard to fall in love with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him as well</font>

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,010
like this they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely my</font>

91
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,600
favorite pairing they're fantastic

92
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,880
people often ask me oh why you not a

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,500
massive the fan I thought you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

94
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,298
been bit more my fam but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rose is</font>

95
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,950
such a fantastic character she's got so

96
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,879
much

97
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,879
humanity and disco and yeah she just

98
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,090
brilliant I love her<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much and so I'm</font>

99
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,159
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that she's back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

100
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,650
actually I was looking at the spoils of

101
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,680
you looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my friends page on the</font>

102
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,319
and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like linking to this BBC</font>

103
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,050
website and I victim and I look like

104
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,199
what I'm just completely gasping oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

105
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,620
it's so cool and they're already have

106
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,300
I'm also quite a fear that the writers

107
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,479
strike America doesn't extend to the UK

108
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,449
as in the same way that it like doesn't

109
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,419
America and because it means that there

110
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,669
will be no doing I think then<font color="#CCCCCC"> EPS is</font>

111
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,919
probably already been written but it's

112
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,750
good because it means us like no delight

113
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,449
in them in our stemming effect exciting

114
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,199
and I was like I don't know shooting

115
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">from boxing's tomorrow and I'm a citizen</font>

116
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,659
out anyway but kelly brook it was like

117
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,940

how amazing is that and she's I'm sure

123
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,870
she's gonna do fantastically I think

124
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,729
she's one of the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> dancers in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

125
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,650
