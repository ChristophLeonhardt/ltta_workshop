AND STAY SAFE OUT THERE. WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING, THANK YOU. AND OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION APPARENTLY FALLS YOU TO THE BAR. JOHNNY McKAY MADE HEADLINES YESTERDAY AFTER SOMEONE TORCHED HIS TRUCK BECAUSE HE DARED TO HAVE A PRO-TRUMP STICKER ON IT. JOHNNY, FIRST OF ALL, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. IS THIS LIKE A NORMAL OCCURRENCE FOR TOP SUPPORTERS IN WASHINGTON STATES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY LIBERAL STATE, WHAT GIVES HERE? WASHINGTON IS ACTUALLY MORE PRO-TRUMP THAN JUST ACROSS THE RIVER IN PORTLAND, SO IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. Laura: SELECTED THE STICKER LOOK LIKE? I HAD TWO STICKERS. THEY BOTH WERE TRUMP 2,020. ONE SAID MAKE LIBERALS CRY AGAIN AND THE OTHER ONE SAID IT, KEEP AMERICA GREAT. Laura: MAKE LIBERALS CRY AGAIN IS REALLY FUNNY, AND YOU HAVE TO GET ME ONE ALTHOUGH I THINK I WILL PUT IT ON MY OLDER CAR. SO YOU CAME OUT OF THE BAR, AND YOU LEFT THE CAR THERE BECAUSE YOU STAYED THERE LATE, AND THEN YOU CAME OUT THE NEXT MORNING, WHAT HAPPENED? MY WIFE WAS AT WORK AND I WAS HOME BORED SO I WENT TO THE BAR TO HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS AND PLAY SOME POOL. I WAS ONLY THERE FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, I HAD FOUR BEERS AND PLAYED A COUPLE GAMES OF POOL AND LEFT AT 10:30 P.M. I TOOK AN UBER HOME BECAUSE I WAS FEELING IT AND WHEN I LEFT IN THE MORNING, IT WAS GONE. IT WAS COMPLETELY TORCHED. THE THING THEY DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY THE LADY WHO INITIALLY CALLED 911 TOLD THE BAR OWNER, IT SAID ON THE FRONT DOOR, F YOU TRUMP COME ON IT. BUT THE SCORCH BURNT THE OTHER PART OFF AND ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS THE TRUMP PART. Laura: I'M SURE IT WASN'T, WE LOVE TRUMP, LET US BRING YOUR TRUNK. TRUCK. I'M REALLY SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU. YOU CAN'T PUT A BUMPER STICKER ON YOUR CAR. CONFUSE THEM NEXT TIME AND HAVE LIKE, AMERICA GREAT AND THEN LIKE, VISUALIZE WORLD PEACE OR QUESTION AUTHORITY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIBERAL GREENPEACE STUFF AND TRUMP STUFF
