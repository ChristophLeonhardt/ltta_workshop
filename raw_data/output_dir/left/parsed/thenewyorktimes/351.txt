Amazon has revealed
the 20 locations
in the running for
its next headquarters.
238 bids came in from across
North America
in hopes that “HQ2” could create jobs
and boost their local economy.
The fight to be Amazon’s
next home was fierce
and some places made
very impassioned pitches.
“Alexa, where is the most
interesting company in the world
going to locate?”
“Obviously, Washington, D.C.”
A city in Georgia offered
to change its name.
“Greetings, Amazon
and Mr. Jeff Bezos.
Welcome to Amazon, Georgia.”
New York City lit up the
Empire State Building
in orange lights.
Calgary, Alberta, said
they would fight a bear
for the headquarters.
And Tucson, Arizona, sent a 20-foot cactus
to Seattle on a flatbed truck.
Many cities, including
Newark, Chicago and Los Angeles,
offered tax-related perks.
Others vowed to invest
in public transportation
to reduce traffic.
Amazon promises to bring as
many as 50,000 high-paying jobs
to the winning city over
the next 10 to 15 years.
The company said 
they’ll announce
their decision later this year.
