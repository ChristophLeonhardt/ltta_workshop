it's summertime and you know what that means and neither do i but this is the season when left dislike to go outside to do fun summer stuff like going to the beach and rioting but not so fast it's dangerous out there in the real world especially if you're a leftist and don't know anything about the real world so let's run through some left-wing safety tips to keep this summer injury free when playing outdoors in July and August leftist should avoid going out in the Sun because of the evil oil companies who killed all those lovely blue people from Avatar and thus ruined our chances to get free energy from a magic tree the Sun has ceased being the yellow circle with a smiley face it used to be when you were a child ever since Donald Trump pulled out of the climate parrot the Paris climate Accord the Sun has become a seething ball of white hot plasma setting off something like a gazillion hydrogen bomb level explosions every second so you don't want to be caught going out in that good lord you'd be killed over and over instead this summer left us should go out at night when the Sun disappears for some reason and your solar-powered houses won't be working anyway so you won't be able to watch all the great fantasy shows on TV like Game of Thrones and CNN but while you're on the beach soaking up those healthful moon rays you want to avoid going near anything that might look like sand or water or the beach you see global warming or global cooling or climate change or whatever crap you believe in it's causing the sea levels to rise at a rate of approximately eight inches every 100 years so if you go out to the beach at night and fall asleep because it's night when you're usually asleep because your solar-powered house isn't working there's a danger you might not wake up before the water rises to the place where you used to be 700 years ago by the way here's a fun tip if you do fall asleep for seven hundred years at the beach and drown because of rising sea levels you might want to keep an eye out for the bodies of your favorite left the celebrities floating by since many of them have houses on the shore despite their fears about rising sea levels almost as if their fears were just ways of pretending to be virtuous and had no application to the real world we're left us never go finally left us if you're planning your usual this summer to the South of France or the Hamptons remember to walk since cars pollute the environment no I'm kidding you can't get any of your summer places by walking so go ahead and take cars and planes just don't use any oil or gas because they killed the avatar people have a great summer leftist we look forward to seeing you again and actually I can't think of a time when we look forward to seeing you

listening to the mainstream media this Russia thing I have to show you this chart that our friends of the media Research Council put out this is research center so I always say that media research center this is TVs Trump Russian obsession right they have covered broadcast evening coverage of select news to copy topics from July 9th to the 18th the Trump Russia probe a hundred and fourteen minutes the health care bill 42 if it's the news in other words is getting under under 50% as much the actual news Isis defeat in Mosul 13 minutes the stock market hitting a record high zilch nothing killing Isis leader in Afghanistan bupkis also nothing the Jane Sanders probe of course we're not covering that I mean that's actually doesn't even exist this is Bernie Sanders in the bank fraud probe nothing and this is a big one the Veteran Affairs Secretary yes actually been doing what the you know Barack Obama pretended he was gonna do he's been throwing people out he's been saying you didn't do a good job you know how hard that is you know rarely people in government get fired that are held responsible that's why that's what government works the way it does but they are on the Russian probe so now they've got this thing he's in the at the g20 meet he's at the g20 meeting right in Hamburg and he's had his meeting with Putin and now he had a second conversation with Putin Putin was sitting with Melania at this big dinner table places packed and Trump went over to walk over there and they talked about he says they talked about adoption who knows what they talked about this is something that happens all the time at these meetings and they're just yelling and screaming about it and it's all he didn't have his translator there he only had two strands like who cares I mean this is like I cannot believe they're doing but I wanted to know was what were Melania and Putin talking about before he got there luckily we had our cameras on the scene so we recorded in this plane and back to you we going to take Washington they're plotting against us Melania and and Putin anyway you know I have to talk about this first before I get on to Trump I'm Trump this guy he is the most entertaining president ever I cannot understand why people are not enjoying this you know when I thought he was gonna be a bad guy I thought there was a chance of his being a really bad guy doing bad things I thought well it's not so funny if he's a bad guy but as long as he's not he's not bad he's so entertaining but I have to before I say that I just have to talk for a minute about John McCain who was diagnosed with a very aggressive brain cancer you know I know it's typical to say oh he's in for a battle and all this stuff this this kills just about everybody I mean the survival survival rates are in the one single digits and he's 80 so you know this is you know this is a bad bad thing for him the thing about these situations I've had a real problems with John McCain all throughout his political career and I've always gone after him and made fun of them and all this stuff but of course this lifts the situation above politics and it's a really good indication that you have let politics drive you insane that politics has triumphed over your humanity if when one of your opponents even even a guy on the other side when he's facing the end when he's facing the the great darkness the big sleep that you can't stop for a minute and say look that this was a human being like me John McCain a hero a patriot a guy who was captured by the Vietnamese they offered to let him go they offered to let him go because he was an officer and because he had influential people back home they thought it would be good pressed he wouldn't go without his men he wouldn't leave without his men and he suffered torture they did that to me by the time they said we offered to let you I would have been like in another country I don't know what happened at Clayton I mean I mean think about that in real terms not in television terms these guys were gonna beat him they did they beat him relentlessly obviously his arms were never the same as his arms that were broken so much and you know the guy was a hero a tough guy a patriot he stood for what he stood for and I want to just play a little bit you know let me play first one of the things I want to talk about today before we get to Nolte is is the fact that Donald Trump went off on everybody yesterday I mean just my wife said is this man ever hinged it's just completely unleashed and he went off on the Senators about the healthcare thing but one of the things he was doing is he went off on he went off in the he was talking to the Senators he gathered all the Republican senators to do you know gin them up to say get back to work and at one point as he always does he kind of went a little too far he was talking to I'm just trying to remember which which senator he was talking to one of the senators from Nevada who who had voted no and had been against this and he really got sitting right next to him and he really gave it to him so let can we play that that is let me find that cut it is geez what is it oh it's it's I think it's number one let's try it I don't think we should leave town unless we have a health insurance plan unless we can give our people great healthcare because we're close we're very close the other night I was very surprised when I heard a couple of my friends my friends they really were and are they might not be very much longer but that's something I think I have to get him back that's right well no you didn't go out there this was the one we were worried about you are there but you're gonna be you're gonna do it look he wants to remain a senator doesn't he okay and I think the people of your state which I know very well I think they're going to appreciate what you hopefully will do any senator who votes against starting debate he's really telling America that you're fine with Obamacare but being fine with Obamacare isn't an option for another reason because it's gone oh okay so that was Dean Heller sitting accident trying to take it in good part Trump always goes too far he's got that New York way of talking he always pushes these guys and of course the press is be always a bully he's mean he's nasty he's rotten blah - bah bah bah I want to go back because we're talking about John McCain I want to just play John McCain when the health care discussions were going on the health care summit they called it was going on with Barack Obama and the Obama was lying to the public and he was making all these deals and McCain said to him in the most polite most a decent civilized way that said to him on camera you know take out these deals let's have it the same you know the same for everybody and this is cut number nine and here was I just want to remind you of what Obama's response to that was remove all the special deals for a special interests and favorite view and treat all Americans the same under provisions of the law so that they will know that geography does not dictate what kind of health care they would receive Thank You mr. president look let me just make this point John because we're not campaigning the election is over so you know people keep saying what a graceful guy Obama Welman was a thug you know he did the same thing same kinds of things that Trump did he did it he had a classier voice he dressed better you know he knew how to behave in company more than Trump did but he he was not a graceful guy that was the way he treated his opponent after the election here's the way McCain treated him during the election while they're fighting for it he's out a you know a town hall kind of thing and this is slightly off lady comes over and says this to McCain and listen to McCain's response I can't trust Obama I have read about him and he's not he's not he's a he's an Arab he is not no no ma'am no ma'am he's a he's a he's a decent family man citizen that I just happened to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that's what it's all about he's not alright so that was McCain and that was some of the reason that people kind of went for Trump they were tired of having a guy like Obama who would rip conservatives and Republicans every chance he got while our people like Mitt Romney and John McCain were we're always saying you know oh no he's a decent guy Obama's a decent guy I just disagree with him and you know this this is something that frustrated people they frayed frustrated people because the news media was pounding on their head all the time if crap they've frustrated people because they were getting disrespect from the elites even disrespect from the conservative elites and it frustrated people with McCain but it did speak into the fact that he was a decent guy living by a standard that had passed all of us by a standard of decency and honor and and friendliness even under fire under political fire that has gone and I think you know many people many conservatives just felt look these days are gone we're gonna lose because they're hammering us so badly and and when McCain lost the election they say well he didn't really know how to fight you know McCain fought his corner I like I said I and will continue to fight until he is gone but he he was an honorable guy and just disagreeing with somebody does not make him it less than an honorable guy and I'm really sorry for him and his family Megan McCain put out a statement very touching talking about her love for him you know if your if your daughter speaks like that from the heart about you at the end you have been a lot of successful life that's a lot more important than anything else he's done all right we're gonna oh yeah we're not we're gonna stay with you till we have till we have known think what it was she was so nice we're so generous you know this you should subscribe just to thank us for being generous here are some things that I should not be allowed to do I should not be allowed to sit in decent company with you know polite adults I shouldn't be allowed to express my opinions anywhere where people

way you look we can save you I do have to before nobody comes on I you know I want to bring him on as quickly as possible but I have to talk a little bit about what Trump did yesterday because it was it was just prime entertaining Trump I just you know ben shapiro was always talking about good trump bad from and the thing is it's all one Trump you know that's good he's completely he brings the Senators in and he slaps them around and the only thing about this was the only thing about this whole session was he should have been doing this all along you know he said this is cut number four when he says this he starts to tell people what's good about the plan that they just rejected listen to what he says the Democrats are always selling their plan but they don't do that anymore they don't talk about Obamacare anymore because they can't because it's failed they know it so they're selling their plan and we never sell our plan if we're weak on anything it's on letting people know how good it was no that's true but it's his job that is exactly his job you want you know you want charisma superstorm Mitch McConnell to go I mean oh my god playing yeah you know it's Trump's job this is what this is a whole job of the president now I have maintained that we hammer and hammer Trump without ever thinking that he can learn anything but if you watch him he does learn stuff maybe maybe it is finally occurring to him that this is exactly what he's supposed to do it is he has accomplished a lot he really has the regulation rollback the judge appointment the writing of our foreign policy with Israel and I think some of this degree with Russia hahaha you know so they he's actually made our foreign policy saying again he's done a lot of really good stuff but this is the prime job of the president is getting the legislators into line and he really goes after them like he goes after them and he goes after Obamacare itself please cut number two this is what he should have been saying all along Obamacare was a big lie you can keep your doctor lie you can keep your planned lie was a lie directly from the president you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan 28 times he said it 28 times and it was a lie and he knew it was and now it's hurting this country irreparably premiums are so high that 6.5 million Americans chose to pay a fine to the IRS instead of buying insurance the famous mandate we will pay not to take the insurance people don't understand that they don't even understand what it is or what it represents if Obamacare is not repealed in 2018 over 1,300 counties in the United States will have only one insurer forty counties will have absolutely no coverage in the exchange and that number will grow rapidly and I think those numbers are extremely conservative I think they're very low this is what he should have been doing all along this is what he should have been doing every single day he should have been going on all the TV shows he should have been making this speech he's good at it you know I'm not picking on the guy I understand that he's a Novus you know it's an amazing thing to have a novice as as president but that's the situation we have he is he is a guy who learns how to do things this is what he's got to learn how to do and now it's very late I don't know this is gonna work then he holds their feet to the fire which i think is absolutely great this is cut number three I've been here just six months I'm ready to act I have pen in hand to believe me I'm sitting in that office I have pen in and you never had that before you know for seven years you had an easy route will repeal will replace and he's never gonna sign it but I'm signing it so it's a little bit different but I'm ready to act for seven years you promised the American people that you would repeal Obamacare people are hurting inaction is not an option see if he had been doing this all this time again I'm not picking on him this is what I want him to learn how to do and I think he can he's good at it he's good at slapping people around he's good at presenting things to the public in a way they can understand he should he should have been doing this for months and we would have this thing passed and they would be talking about amendments because remember what they're voting on is not to discuss it they're voting on not even to amend it so they haven't even got the courage to do that I mean this is an incredible thing the thing the only thing I want to add and then we'll get to nolte the only thing I want to add is while he's doing this because what makes him so good at it when he finally gets around to doing it is that he's unleashed you know he just goes after people and he you know he really that he can't curb himself and so meanwhile he's giving an interview to the New York Times and he goes off on on Jeff Sessions it really it's this really is kind of the bad side of a guy who has no he just has no bridle on this is cut number five sessions gets the job right after he gets the job introduces himself who's that a mistake well section should have never accused himself and if he wanted if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and I wouldn't pick somebody else zero so Jeff Sessions takes the job gets into the job refuses themselves I then have that which which frankly I think it's very unfair to the president how do you take a job and then recuse yourself if he would have refused himself before the job I would have said thanks Jeff but I can't you know I'm not going to thank you it's extremely unfair and that's a mild word to the president no I want to remind you that Obama's a Obama's Attorney General remind me his name I always forget his name the first Attorney General General under Obama what's that yes I don't know why I always forget his name but anyway he came out and said he was such a Eric Holder geez he was such a corrupt hack and he came out and said I am the president's wingman he's my boy I'm the president's wingman so Trump is not saying anything that is untoward it is just he's saying it's the wrong people New York Times are not is they're not his friends and it makes him seem like you know that they're getting to him it makes it seem like this Russian thing is getting to him he should learn these are things that look he's good I don't think he's ever gonna learn to keep his mouth shut I do not say I think that is part of his personality I think it is as as we see today it has it's good side and it's bad side but I think that he can learn he can learn to harness this talent he has for slapping people around it for explaining things to get these the GOP into line because the GOP virtually doesn't exist at this point it doesn't stand for anything it doesn't mean anything it doesn't believe anything and they can't come together the way the Democrats always do let us bring on the naltar Nader can you hear me no I can hear you now I got you okay all right thank you and John's good to see it I'm good man thanks driving me out it's good to see you they say your is that your house Cherie yeah I'm in my house I am yeah it looks really nice geez I have to say yeah thank you you put those pictures on Twitter and I've never you know I've never forgiven you for leaving La and going back to the country that you love but but I have to say when I see those pictures I know why you did it it is beautiful out there yes it is it's perfect out here yeah very very happy we missed the people in LA but we don't miss that one story ghetto even a little bit I don't blame it all right so I know I know how that you unlike Donald Trump you're very restrained in your opinions and you always you know try to speak in the mode a measured tone tell me what your reaction was to this health care thing well I I think two reactions the first is towards these nevertrump idiots who try to blame Trump in some way for for failing I mean the Republican Party the oh so precious establishment Republican Party has been promising us for going on seven years that they were going to repeal this for seven years they took our money in these fundraising efforts for seven years they got us out to vote in historic numbers this is a promise that those that those 300 men and women have made probably collectively ten thousand times over the last seven years that they were going to repeal this this is a promise that they made in what we now know we're completely phony votes to repeal it knowing that the that when he was president obama would veto it these people are garbage they're just scumbags they're liars they conned us they grifted us and they will never see another penny from me and that's a campaign I'm gonna start on Twitter is to get people to stop sending money to the GOP I must get twenty fundraisers fundraising letters a week from these idiots now I'm gonna send them back now and tell them not a penny I'm gonna waste all their postage to send them nothing but so you've fund the law you repeal Obamacare and you reform taxes because they have got it they got the whole government it could do anything they want within the reconciliation process and these cowardly grifters refused to do it and that is not Donald Trump's fault that is their fault they told us they would do it for seven years thousands and thousands of times they're bigger and Liars in Barack Obama you know I while I agree with you that that is their fault I do think that Trump and and like you know I've certainly come far until two in first of all I enjoy Trump joy the hell out of Trump he's the most entertaining president ever and and I have come a long way toward respecting him and I seen where he's going why the people who love him love him but it is his job that kicked these people into line I mean he's good at doing that and he only does it now and I know Mitch McConnell told him to back off but you know he's guy he has got to herd these cats because that is the president's job to some degree I'm not blamed that's not blaming him it's just saying this is a skill he has got to learn don't you think yeah listen I I'm not saying in any way that Trump maybe couldn't have done something better because I keep hearing like you do it's it's heard these alternate these alternate attacks on him way gets involved in something he's hurting it the best thing he can do is stay out of it because he's so toxic when he's really not so I don't know I mean diet but I think it's two different arguments could trump up doing something different maybe but it has nothing to do with the fact that the that should have passed the repeal should have passed both houses of Congress even if Trump was promising to veto it hmm these liars made this promise to us thousands and thousands of times they stole our money they made us go to the polls for absolutely no reason whatsoever and they've done nothing and this is totally and completely on them so one of the things that you and I definitely agree on is that Trump's war against the media is one of the things that has needed to be fought for a long time that I think right I think that some of our some of the people over at National Review and I love them all but I think some of the things they do not understand is what the effect has been on people to just be disrespected by every network by every Hollywood star by every you know professor who gets quoted as an expert for eight years while Obama kind of played the music to go along with the words and and I think that Trump Unleashed has been great how do you feel the war against the media is going who's winning well I don't think there's any question that Trump is waiting I I think that the the three biggest propaganda outlets in the country are CNN The Washington Post in The New York Times and The Washington Post I don't know how they're doing that they're a bit of a laughingstock now hmm the New York Times is definitely a laughingstock and and even though we're told time and again that the Trump is a boon for journalism right now the the New York Times is engaging in massive layoffs and CNN is an ax ratings death spiral right now in the Col Wallace and I think we can all agree that Nicole Wallace would make the perfect poster child for making hate of virtues it's just horrible she's beating she's got more viewers than the entire CNN lineup me Nicole frickin Wallace so they're their ratings are in the tank and CNN it's just a huge joke no I don't think anybody takes anything they do seriously so I don't think there's any question that the polls show it I mean 57% of the American people I saw today believe that believe the media is being too hard on Trump and the media was jubilant when their approval rating went from I think twenty percent to twenty twenty four percent lately I mean they're they're less popular than congress and it isn't so much that trump's been doing it not to take anything away from him but the media's been doing it to themselves i call it death by by suicide through asphyxia masturbation they've completely murdered themselves at all Trump is doing he's not taking any of their crap and he's just pointing out pointing at them and laughing them and he's brilliant at the politics of ridicule the politics of ridicule or what or how george w bush beat Al Gore and John Kerry ultimately was politics to ridicule the alpha-male always wins and and believe it or not Barack Obama was able to alpha-male John McCain and Mitt Romney and that's what's happening here Trump is the ultimate alpha male and he is just be deviling these news outlets international jokes and I think that the the ratings show that I think MSNBC is doing well because everyone from all the left is to watch CNN are running to MSNBC so because they can't count on seeing it seen it lies to them too much it's very hard to be lied to and get your hopes up that James Comey is gonna is gonna tell the whole world the Trump lied about Comey telling him that he wasn't under investigation and then they get let down I just think that even leftists are being are tired of being lied to by CNN so I'm gonna set is MSNBC is doing well and good for them they're openly left-wing they deserve to do well I have no problem with that and not only that they I agree with you I think that their openness about who they are is is absolutely decisive and how you judge them and I think they also see because they see that Fox is having problems they brought on Hugh Hewitt I think they're talking to other conservatives I think they're going to you know look for a little balance which is since we do need a press it would be nice to have a it would be kind of a dream of mine that we would have an actual fair journalistic establishment do you think there's any chance that these guys are gonna wake up and say oh maybe Trump has a point no no no no if that was gonna happen it would have happened it would probably would have happened years and years ago I've been watching the media very closely especially since the rise of new media and what when new media came along in force which was really after the whole rather gate fiasco and you could see that there was this group of online people who were fact-checking the media in doing it very closely and doing it very well at that point I thought to myself well now the media is gonna have to shape up because they're being policed and what I've seen is just they've just gotten worse worse and worse and worse and worse more to the left more open about their biases more dishonest more lies more fake news there's been more scandals over the last 10 years and I think in the entire history of at least the 20th century of media so no they're never going to get better they're just gonna keep throwing it at the wall and hoping something sticks which means we have to build a media that actually goes out and not doesn't just give opinions but actually goes out and covers the news in the finale and that's happening I remember giving a speech to a group of people after Obama beat Romney it was a group of conservatives and they were all just desolate and I remember saying at the speech that people need to feel good because the media landscape is changing and there were there were news organizations and I'm gonna get some of the names wrong but I think I remember the Washington free beacon I just come online and a bunch of other news outlets that just come online along with Breitbart and and I told them I said this is a very good thing I said the landscape has changed dramatically in the last year and it wasn't enough to affect the 2012 election but it's gonna be enough to affect the 2016 election because because our side is not just throwing rocks anymore we're not only good at journalism we're very good at muddying the waters just as effectively as the media muddied the waters to protect Barack Obama and try and drag Hillary Clinton over the finish line we're very good at that tactical aspect of it which some people call what about ISM but I just call sticking to the precedents that the media said holding the media to the precedents because they're the ones who set the rules and if this was okay under Obama I'm sorry but it's gonna have to be okay now because losing like a gentleman when your country is at stake is no virtue I well I certainly agree with that I mean we have and the thing about what about ISM is it was named that because the Soviet Union would torture in jail and execute people and when the America would complain they would say well what about the fact you held slaves and that's actually not a good point it is a good point to say if you have a double standard then we can never win we did have a disagreement about this thing where they shut down the Julius Caesar which I thought where Trump was a sat it was Julius Caesar and he got assassinated which I thought was reprehensible that they put it on but I thought it was bad tactics that they shut it down and and you disagreed with me on that give me give me the other side of it yeah I think that you have we're in a war period and in a war you can do two things you can fight for your principles and lose or you can fight the enemy and we need to get these people to sue for peace and the only way to get them to sue for peace is to make them feel the pain of their own behavior and I don't care about the motives of the people who jumped on that stage where I care about is that the left got a taste of their own medicine right in the very heart of their own of their own by their own battle lines I mean Central Park in Manhattan for crying out loud and we need to be doing more of that now I'm totally opposed to violence I am totally opposed to any sort of law breaking unless it's what this was which I believe was civil disobedience where the individuals have committed these act were willing to go to prison or whatever the the effect was and I don't think what they did was any different from one well from what Martin Luther King did Martin Luther King was disrupted everybody thinks Martin Luther King was so sort of Saint you know the the sort of simple version of a saint he wasn't he picked Edmund Pettus Bridge if I'm if I'm remembering the name of it correctly because it was named after a slave holder he put his thumb in the eye of the bad guys Democrats in the south every day of the week and that's that's how he won and we need to be doing the same thing until the left feels the pain of their own behavior they're not gonna sue for peace and we cannot sit around and allow ourselves to be treated like second-class citizens by allowing this to happen to us is we allow our stupid principles to make again to allow it to get worse and worse and worse we did not win World War two fighting for our principles we won World War two Bobby's civilians we won World War two with a very vehement league terrible racist campaign against the Japanese which even by 1940 standards was racist you can't fight for your principles you have to fight the enemy and doing to the enemy what they do to us as long as it doesn't involve violence his his is to me a righteous see to me the problem with the this is a strategy we're just talking about if this I'm just talking about as a strategy is since we're not actually in a war that is we're not trying to do what you do in a war which is kill as many of the Opposition as you can until they sue for peace because they simply can't go forward we're actually in a in a very pitched political battle where I think the stakes are enormous lehigh I think the stakes are the country this is where you and I agree this is why we have so many areas of agreement I think the stakes are much much higher than the anti-trump errs really understand but but the way you win a political war is you convince those people who can be convinced we know the left is never going to be convinced and I think that when we shut when we actually when we fight the way they fight that's one thing but when we fight for the things they fight for like shutting down free speech I think we're making a strategic mistake because we can't convince those people who can be convinced by shutting down free speech because they're gonna look at us and say well you just have to choose whether I want to go see Shakespeare in the park or whether I want to you know have been Shapiro shut up you know that's all they're choosing between you know instead I think we should actually make them choose between free speech everybody gets to talk and between these people who silence been and who silence anybody who comes to their campuses because because we're not in an actual shooting war thank God yet AHA because we're not we have to convince people and we it's in order to convince people even though we can fight tough we have to fight for the things we actually believe in and one of those things is free speech well I agreed with that until about last year because I think we've tried it that great and things are getting worse not only are things getting worse I'd only use the so-called resistance becoming even more belligerent too dangerous but you have the infrastructure that used to police this stuff mainly the mainstream media and even the Democratic Party siding with the bad guys so it's it's we've tried it we've tried it that way we've tried it my way I won't just say your way we've tried it my way for what decade now five years now we've tried reason we've tried saying to them listen you're you know this is about free speech we've tried appealing to their better nature it is getting worse and it time that we do more than just scratch our chins and puffs on our pipes we have to protect the free speech of individuals like Ben but also you know just people that want to go to a Donald Trump rail not you know someone like Ben nothing against Tim he's a very brave guy yeah but but he you know when his free speech is heard it's a good thing for him in a way because he gets a tremendous amount of attention to it the cause gets a tremendous amount of attention so he can't lose either way and that's because he's very smart he's handling this at a very smart way but what about just the everyday guy though or the everyday girl who wants to watch Trump speak they can't do that anymore in certain areas where they were they want to see Ann Coulter speaker they want us to use speaker Ben speak I'm not worried about that Shapiro's free speech I'm not worried about Ann Coulter Donald Trump's free speech I'm worried about the free speech of the everyday American who gets a bike chain across the face and if politeness and editorials worked I think they would have already and I think actually right now the left along with the media they're taking advantage of our weakness which is why it's getting worse up you know that the thing is I mean I'm totally against fighting back against the guy who puts a bike chain in your face but I'm fighting back to get that to let that person speak and let that person do what they want to do I'm not fighting back to shut them down listen I gotta go it's always great to see you I wish you were here I'm gonna I'm gonna continue to bother you there as often as I can I'll talk

stuff I like I've been talking about politically incorrect masterpieces I just have to mention this a Toronto guy there's a there was a place in a Toronto Park okay a community park they had a steep slope and people falling down and hurting themselves so the city said well we've got to build stairs you know on the SPRO so they gave in a an estimate for how much it was going to cost $65,000 or two a hundred and fifty thousand dollars that was how much they were gonna charge the government was gonna charge to buy stairs so a guy goes out and he gets a couple of homeless people to help him he builds them for five hundred and fifty dollars okay they were estimating sixty-five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand she gets it in for five hundred and fifty dollars what do you think the government said they said oh we're gonna have to tear this down this doesn't mean we forget the graph so I want to end you know there's all this stuff on the left about cultural appropriation and I believe the cultural appropriation is one of the greatest things about the West come on over add your brilliant cultural stuff leave your bad cultural stuff behind leave behind your drug lords leave behind your tyrants leave all that stuff behind bring the food bring the music bring the ideas we love it and okay so some of the greatest as you know I love the great American music of the 30s and 40s and 50s and so much of that was white people and black people kind of getting together and learning from each other black people learning from America from white American music white people learning from black American music and it made some of the greatest songs ever Louie Jordan was a genius he was in he was called the king of the jukeboxes for about 20 years he was just a big sensation nowadays nobody listens to him but his stuff is great and I wanted to end and go into the clave and last weekend with this because these are the great words of advice to the government you
