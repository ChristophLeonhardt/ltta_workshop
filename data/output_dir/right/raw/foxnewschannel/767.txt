THE PRESIDENT'S GOT LONG

15
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:23,250
COATTAILS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

16
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,518
IT WAS HIS TWEET THAT HELPED

17
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:26,153
KNOCK OFF A SITTING U.S.

18
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:29,223
CONGRESSMAN IN A PRIMARY

19
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:29,623
ELECTION.

20
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:32,692
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COMBAT THE

21
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:33,694
VICE-PRESIDENT AND THE

22
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:34,795
PRESIDENT, AIR FORCE ONE MAKES

23
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:36,931
AN AWFUL LOT OF NOISE WHEN IT

24
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,265
COMES TO TOWN.

25
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:39,366
STUMPING FOR YOUR OPPONENT?

26
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,435
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS VERY

27
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:42,236
POPULAR IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND I

28
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,938
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT

29
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:46,140
A REFERENDUM ON HIM.

30
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,441
SOUTH CAROLINA SUPPORTS THE

31
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:47,841
PRESIDENT.

32
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,009
I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.

33
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,311
BUT THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON

34
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,713
GOVERNOR McMASTER AND HIS FAILED

35
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:53,147
LEADERSHIP.

36
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,548
HE'S BEEN PARTNERED TO A

37
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:55,749
CRIMINAL FOR 30 YEARS IN RICHARD

38
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,518
QUINN, WHO IS A CHIEF

39
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:58,152
CONSULTANT.

40
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:00,087
WE'RE READY FOR A CHANGE HERE.

41
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:01,322
WE'RE READY FOR SOMEONE WITH

42
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:02,890
COMPETENCE WHO IS GOING TO

43
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,791
REPRESENT THE TAXPAYER AND

44
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:04,825
THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING.

45
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:06,927
LELAND: I'VE HEARD THAT

46
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:09,430
ACCUSATION BEFORE AND IN ONE OF

47
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,198
YOUR SOUND BITES AND A LOT OF

48
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:12,766
YOUR INTERVIEWS YOU SAY PEOPLE

49
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:14,168
ARE TIRED OF THE CORRUPTION.

50
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:15,402
THAT'S A PRETTY SERIOUS CHARGE.

51
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:16,603
ARE YOU ACTUALLY SAYING THE

52
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:17,972
GOVERNOR HIMSELF IS CORRUPT?

53
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,374
AND IF SO, WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU

54
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:20,674
HAVE?

55
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,209
>> I'M SAYING THAT A LOT OF

56
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,877
PEOPLE THAT SURROUND THEMSELVES

57
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,380
WITH THE GOVERNOR ARE CORRUPT.

58
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,148
WE'VE HAD FOUR LEGISLATORS SINCE

59
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:30,184
2014 INDICTED WHO HAVE RESIGNED

60
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:31,151
IN DISGRACE.

61
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,187
THREE OF THE FOUR SHARE THE

62
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:35,556
EXACT SAME CHIEF POLITICAL

63
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:37,958
CONSULTANT AS THE GOVERNOR, AND

64
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,026
WE HAVE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

65
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:40,361
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

66
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,329
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

67
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:42,696
HAPPEN.

68
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:44,598
SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE NEW BLOOD.

69
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:47,801
WE NEED A BUSINESSMAN, A

70
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:48,736
IN THERE AND CHANGE SOUTH

71
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,270
CAROLINA FOR THE BETTER.

72
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,505
LELAND: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF

73
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:52,873
THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

74
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,808
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

75
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:56,443
ONE THING THAT AFFECTS SOUTH

76
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:58,278
CAROLINA, PERHAPS

77
00:01:58,278 --> 00:01:59,213
DISPROPORTIONATELY IS TARIFFS

78
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:01,949
AND THE RECIPROCAL TARIFFS BEING

79
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:02,983
PLACED BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT

80
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:03,550
TRUMP'S POLICIES.

81
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,985
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO

82
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:07,021
STAND UP TO THE PRESIDENT AND

83
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:08,555
SAY, THE TARIFFS MIGHT BE GOOD

84
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:11,125
FOR HIM, BUT THEY'RE NOT GOOD

85
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,292
FOR SOUTH CAROLINA?

86
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,628
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S DONE

87
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:18,065
AN AMAZING JOB WITH TAX REFORM,

88
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:19,800
WITH GETTING A SUPREME COURT

89
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,236
JUSTICE, WITH WINNING THE COLD

90
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:23,637
WAR IN KOREA.

91
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,240
ONE AREA I WOULD DISAGREE WITH

92
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,076
THE PRESIDENT ON IS TARIFFS AND

93
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:30,177
GOVERNOR McMASTER HAS DISAGREED

94
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:32,413
WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT

95
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:32,746
ISSUE.

96
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:34,681
AND WE HAVE SO MUCH INDUSTRY.

97
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:39,953
I WITH AS IN SOMERVILLE AND THEY

98
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,522
IMPORT STEEL BECAUSE THE

99
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:42,923
AMERICAN STEEL INDUSTRY IS NOT

100
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:45,259
UP TO CODE AND NOT UP TO PAR AND

101
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,226
TARIFFS HURT PEOPLE IN SOUTH

102
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:46,593
CAROLINA.

103
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:47,861
LELAND: AS YOU NOTED, GOVERNOR

104
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,130

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,365
FRIEND TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S.

106
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:52,599
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING THERE

107
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,501
TO STUMP FOR HIM, WASN'T ENOUGH

108
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:56,403
TO CHANGE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

109
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:56,737
MIND.

110
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:57,905
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY TO

111
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:58,972
PROTECT PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA

00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:00,307
FROM THE TARIFFS YOU JUST SAID

113
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:02,543

114
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:04,711

115
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:06,814
TO WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

116
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,382
COME JANUARY, WHEN I'M GOVERNOR,

00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,524
COMPARED TO GOVERNOR McMASTER,

123
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:19,460
I'M THE BUSINESSMAN, HE'S THE

00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,096
CAREER POLITICIAN, THIS IS HIS

125
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,730

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,968
GOING TO TAKE TO THE PRESIDENT

129
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,937

THEN LISTEN TO YOU?

134
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,278

00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:44,885
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND THAT'S

140
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:46,220
WHAT LEADERS DO.

141
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,855
