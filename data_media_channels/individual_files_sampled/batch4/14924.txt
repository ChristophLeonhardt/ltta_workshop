can I um Mark Latham and I'm back here on the streets of Fairfield outside the centerlink office this is where and how your taxes are being spent as people file in and out sorting out their welfare arrangements now you might remember when we were here six months ago we did a street talk looking at English language skills in Fairfield in Western Sydney we found out we found out shocking outcomes where if people can't speak to each other how can we have a multicultural community how can I get to know each other how can people build trust and cooperation here's what we saw on the streets of fair very well now after that video two very important things happen muscular leaders of the local Assyrian community said how dare you Mark Latham come here without permission and talk to people well I say to them it's a free country I've got free speech and I'm back here again to find out what's going on and how your taxes are being spent the second thing is a very recent debate 40 minutes spent in the New South Wales Parliament denouncing me for findings realistic findings that 90% of people here aren't speaking English the national language these members of parliament there were four labour three liberal having a go at me shooting down mark Latham's outsiders so I've come back here today to put these members of parliament to the test maybe things have improved on the streets of Fairfield and they've done some kind of job to improve English language skills that's what we're gonna try and find out here today talking to people in front of the center link office now the debate was led by the local member guides and Gauri and another one denounced him he was jihad Dib that's not every day of the week that you're denounced by someone called jihad but let's put his proposition to the test let's find out what people are saying or not saying in English here in fair film just to ask you about the English language skills in Fairfield do you think the English language skills in okay thank you thank you okay thank you my which language skills in Fairfield do you think they're very good very good Chinese yeah I mean how many people do you think speak English here in Fairfield no thank you very much thanks for time many people here speaking English Assyrian or Arabic okay oh thanks fee time geez language skills here in Fairfield do you speak English well you know my gang which is Arabic Arabic I can watch yeah oh where did you come from I'm coming in Syria Syria before we're 32 you exactly okay thank you language skills here in Fairfield not English language skills here in or do you think English language skills here in Fairfield are very good he's very good and and do you think we can have multiculturalism if people can't speak to each other in English okay okay thanks okay thank you have a good day Cheers good eye them I can ask you about English language skills here in Fairfield do you think people speak English up to a good standard you have a good day no I'm good is our multiculturalism do you think it can work without speaking English okay thanks bye good on you good I might ask you about english language english from you okay think and do you think we can have successful multiculturalism if people can't speak to each other in the national language of English that's a tough one look I mean cuz each each suburb I think is segregated to different cultures so I mean in saying that it's sort of it sort of depends if you come out from you know you're you know we're from Fairfield around the area then it possibly could be a challenge for you but if you new in the area it sort of works well for you sort of just become adapted to but you've said the suburbs are segregated from each other wouldn't it work better if we all mix together got to know each other spoke the language built trust and cooperation across these boundaries no that's I do believe that for sure but like you know that's just something that happens like Cabramatta segregated to the Asians and this is most multicultural innocence you know a lot of Middle Eastern people so it's a bit of a how can we have a successful multiculturalism do you think if people can't speak to each other in the national language of English I was thinking that we want to support people with the welfare but maybe after 12 months if you haven't made the attempt to learn English you shouldn't get the support from centre league do you think that's a fair proposition very much and what do you think is the job that guy Zhang Gary is doing for Fairfield okay well thanks very much for talking to us you have a great day well the evidence here is very clear English language skills haven't improved in Fairfield these members of parliament are totally delusional people who don't even know who guy Zangara is he's doing no job for his local communities typical of the labour employees who take the votes of these ethnic groups knowing they're living in enclaves knowing they've got high unemployment knowing they can't speak English but he won't upset them by saying look you've got to learn the national language but there was one ray of hope the lady who agreed with me in saying after 12 months of welfare support a decent period people should be expected to pass a basic English test if I can't speak English after 12 months then cut off the welfare what you would find with that policy of course is that people would get off their backsides earn English and we'd have a chance a chance of having proper integration instead of ethnic enclaves in places like Fairfield so we're here reporting the truth they're not going to hold us out they're not going to intimidate or bully me I want to find the facts and report them directly to you from the streets I'm Mark Latham
