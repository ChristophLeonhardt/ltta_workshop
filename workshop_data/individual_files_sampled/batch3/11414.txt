a significant day for Syria is the last Islamic States stronghold in the country the city of Abu Kemal is liberated that's according to government forces we'll show you just a moment here pictures from the vicinity of the city where Syrian and Iraq bat militias joined forces to surround a pool Kemal which is situated very close to the border between those two countries horses from four countries participated in the joint operation to liberate the city which saw heavy clashes over a number of days in that area artis Daniel Hawkins has more on the significance of this victory boo Kemal was the last major settlement on the border with Iraq a key strategic point as well to prevent the flow of fighters and arms across the Iraqi Syrian border why is it significant as we mentioned earlier it's one of the last strongholds of ISIL in the region one of the last of the self-proclaimed Caliphate now just two years ago isil-controlled more than half of the territory in Syria now they're located in just a few desert areas controlling some villages and some other isolated posts in Iraq and in Syria as well what may exist developments so significant well the operation was carried out by an our amalgamation of different forces the russian air force had been conducting operations in the region for several days before very heavy fighting going on let's take a look at some of the footage from there before we go on that was the operation in the skies on the ground of course the Syrian Arab army would it's a Shiite militia allies and Hezbollah a little bit of dancing from the West from the south we've had the Iraqi popular mobilization units the militias allied to the Baghdad government they'd crossed the border to help their Syrian allies retake that very key area as well now this information is coming from local sources from local commanders local media was still waiting on an official statement from Damascus and from the Russian Foreign Ministry we'll try and get that as the day goes on many are asking what comes next now as in northern parts of Syria this latest development brings to a head many groups with very different interests the Syrian army allied militias there to the west of the Euphrates the SDF to Syrian democratic forces they're backed by Washington a coalition of Kurdish Arab militias they're pushing in from the north and from the east they're very key area with the oil fields located there it's unclear how Washington's position will pan out as well with support for the SDF so there's a lot of negotiation compromise reconciliation to happen once ISIL is fully eradicated from Syria and we'll see how that pans out over coming weeks and months we've got reaction from experts on what the latest development does mean for Syria that's a huge knockdown of territory and yeah I would say it looks like it's almost washed up for ISIL doesn't mean they can't commit acts of terrorism but it doesn't mean they control territory anymore I think one thing that Syria has in its favor is that the eastern part of Syria has a lot of Syria's oil such as it is and so getting full control of eastern Syria a deprives ISIL of a lot of the revenues I think that that region in that country will remain unstable for the foreseeable future Islamic state is one of many militant groups in that country and given that I think that the civil war will continue so I do think that Assad's power the Syrian government's power is expanding throughout the country but I don't expect him to have all of the country under wraps because there still remain you know tens of thousands of people prepared to fight against the Syrian Arab army and its militia
