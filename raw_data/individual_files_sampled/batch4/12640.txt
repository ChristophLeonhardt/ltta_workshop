it's all culture conservatives are finally winning the culture this brings us to Yeezy Kanye West so Kanye West has been tweeting these great things that it sounds like he's a conservative Republican he starts adding he just tweets decentralized okay all right yeah I agree we should decentralize we should have more local government more local control Denny tweets you don't have to agree with Trump but the mob can't make me not love him we are both dragon energy he is my brother I love everyone I don't agree with everything anyone does that's what makes us individuals and we have the right to independent thought so at this point I am I'm actually just a Kanye West fan I don't really like his music that much but I've become a Kanye West fan so at this point now the media are saying he's insane they say oh he's crazy oh he's this he's that then he tweets out a picture of him wearing the mega happy because he's just playing around right he's just like giving you a little hint so yeah I like Trump personally is ladies were in that Maggi head and the media go crazy and they say they're actually reporting that Kanye West is mentally ill that is how they're because they're so in their own silo they're so in their own little bubble they don't realize that half the country voted for Donald Trump but they don't know any of those people they don't know anyone who voted for Donald Trump so the only thing that this could mean is the Kanye West has lost his mind kim kardashian to her credit credit tweeted out and said you can't mental health as a serious issue and you shouldn't be bandying around these smears and allegations so carelessly my husband isn't crazy basically or he's no crazier than he ever was he's no crazier than he used to be this has been building for a few days Kanye West tweeted out a video of Scott Adams the Dilbert guy who's he's not a right wing or a left winger but he's he likes Trump and he kind of understands Trump so Kanye West's tweets out not just a video of Scott Adams but a video of him watching Scott Adams and this is really important because it's it's involving you in his real it's involving you in his participation in something conservative it's not just a random tweet and you'd say oh he didn't do that it's bringing you right into his living room right onto his computer and this was really shocking I mean this is so good he's it's all started when he said that he likes the way Candace Owens thinks friend of the show red pill black Candice Owens
