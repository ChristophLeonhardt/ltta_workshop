1
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:09,632
>> Martha: WE ARE BACK LIVE ON

2
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,734
THE BORDER IN YUMA, ARIZONA.

3
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:14,703
MORE ON THE REALITY OF THIS, THE

4
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:16,739
AGING FENCE, THAT MANY SAY

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,374
DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,108
TRANSFORMED INTO A FULL-FLEDGED

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,945
BORDER WALL.

8
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:24,914
SO YOU ARE ABOUT TO VISIT THE

9
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:26,549
WALL, THIS IS THE WALL THAT THE

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,550
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PROMISING.

11
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:28,918
AT THE 2-MILE STRETCH BUT IT

12
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:30,152
WILL GIVE EVERYONE A SENSE OF

13
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:32,755
WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE.

14
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,056
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

15
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:35,558
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT

16
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,328
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WALL.

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,130
IT'S NOT WILLY-NILLY.

18
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,098
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

19
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:45,267
DETERMINING WHERE THE SMUGGLING

20
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:48,771
ROUTES ARE, AND THAT'S WHERE WE

21
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:50,139
ARE BUILDING THE WALL.

22
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,241
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENT

23
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:53,576
TALKED ABOUT DRUGS COMING ACROSS

24
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:53,976
THE BORDER.

25
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:57,046
IT SAID TO BE WORSE THAN CRACK

26
00:00:57,047 --> 00:01:06,288
COCAINE, AND, HOW DOES IT GET I

27
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:06,555
IN.

28
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:09,291
HOW ARE THESE KILO BRICKS OF

29
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:09,925
FENTANYL FINDING THEIR WAY

30
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,794
ACROSS THE BORDER?

31
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:20,803
>> >> WE HAVE ABOUT 7,000 PEOPLE

32
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:24,940
ACROSS ITS BORDER, AND WE HAVE

33
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:26,342
PEOPLE TO INSPECT AND ENSURE

34
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:28,277
THEY ARE NOT BRINGING CONTRABAND

35
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:33,749
WITH THEM.

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,856
AND, TO MAKE A SEIZURE, THE

37
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:41,523
INVESTIGATOR CAN TAKE ACTION

38
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:42,391
AGAINST THAT.

39
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:48,764
>> AND HOW THEY BRING THINGS

40
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,234
ACROSS THE BORDER, AND WE KNOW

41
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:55,537
WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING.

42
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:58,140
NOT ONLY LOOKING AT HOW WE GET

43
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,408
THESE PATHWAYS, BUT HOW IT'S

44
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,543
FUNDED AND HOW THEY SEND THEIR

45
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:01,977
PROCEEDS BACK.

46
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,780
ALL OF THAT IS PART OF THE ISIS

47
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:12,121
MISSION.

48
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:18,160
AND WE HAD AT MINISTERIAL THAT

49
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,395
WE CALLED FOR IN JULY IN

50
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:21,397
GUATEMALA, TO GET ALL OF THE

51
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:23,299
COUNTRIES TO WORK ON A REGIONAL

52
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,666
APPROACH.

53
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:27,002
THIS TCO THREAT IS REAL, AND

54
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:30,539
PART OF OUR PROMISE FOR SECURIT

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,341
SECURITY.

56
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,109
>> SO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

57
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,878
SAYING THEY WANTED TO BANISH

58
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,147
EYES, SAYING YOU GUYS WERE

59
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:40,516
BRUTAL, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT

60
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:40,816
THAT?

61
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,084
>> I SAY THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND

62
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,519
THERE ARE 20,000 PUBLIC SERVANTS

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,154
OUT THERE GETTING UP EACH AND

64
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:46,088
EVERY DAY TO PROTECT THIS

65
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:49,525
COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO AT

66
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:49,825
I.C.E.

67
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:50,492
WE INVESTIGATE TRANSNATIONAL

68
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,128
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS, TAKE

69
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,732
DOWN THE DARK WEB ORGANIZATIONS,

70
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,234
AND WE WORK WITH CDP TO TAKE THE

71
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:00,436
DETAINEES THAT THEY HAVE AND

72
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:01,537
TAKE THEM THROUGH THE DUE

73
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:03,138
PROCESS TO BE REMOVED.

74
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,940
THAT'S WHAT THE FOLKS AT I.C.E.

75
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:05,908
DO AND IT'S A NECESSARY ELEMENT

76
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,877
OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT ADDS TO

77
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:10,145
THE OVERALL SAFETY AND SECURITY

78
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,214
OF THE COUNTRY.

79
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,817
>> CYBER CRIMES, THAT'S WHAT

80
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,318
THEY FIGHT.

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,986
PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES.

82
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:20,289
HELPING STATE ORGANIZATIONS WITH

83
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,523
INVESTIGATIONS, THAT'S WHAT

84
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:22,124
I.C.E. DOES.

85
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,158
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE AND DANGEROUS

86
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,528
FOR ANYONE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY.

87
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:27,730
>> ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK

88
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,934
ABOUT WAS THE QUESTION THAT CAME

89
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,736
UP ON FOX THIS MORNING ABOUT HOW

90
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:35,104
UNITED EVERYONE IS IN THE

91
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:37,373
OPERATIONS THAT YOU GUYS ARE

92
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:38,874
DOING, AND THAT THE

93
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,342
ADMINISTRATION AT THE

94
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:40,976
WHITE HOUSE.

95
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,078
THE SUGGESTION ONCE RAISED BY

96
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,279
BRANDON JUDD AT THE UNION, HE

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,748
SPEAKS FOR THE UNION OF THE

98
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,182
BORDER PATROL AND HE SUGGESTED

99
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:51,286
THAT BACK IN 2016 WHEN A LOT OF

100
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:51,820
THEM WERE ENDORSING

101
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,956
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR OFFICE, YOU

102
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,758
ASKED THEM TO WITHDRAW THAT

103
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,158
ENDORSEMENT.

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,161
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT,

105
00:03:59,162 --> 00:03:59,595
COMMISSIONER?

106
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:00,229
>> IT'S NOT TRUE.

107
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,731
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR UNIONS

108
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:05,534
TO ADVANCE THE BORDER PATROLS TO

109
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:06,301
PROTECTING OUR BORDER.

110
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:08,504
WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE ON THE

111
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:09,905
BORDER IS ADVANCING FOR SECURITY

112
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,140
PRIORITIES FOR THE

113
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:11,807
ADMINISTRATION, AND WE ARE

114
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,108
BUILDING THE WALL.

115
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,176
WE ARE ADDING AGENTS AND PUTTING

116
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:19,681
TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE.

117
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:24,219
>> SO YOU NEVER ASKED ANYONE TO

118
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,355
CHANGE YOUR ENDORSEMENT OF

119
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:29,792
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

120
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:36,031
>> THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

121
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:41,136
>> I WOULD BE SURPRISED TO HEAR

122
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:41,870
ANYONE SUGGEST THAT HE IS NOT

123
00:04:41,871 --> 00:00:00,000
FULLY AND ON THE AGENDA.
