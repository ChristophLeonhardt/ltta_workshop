- Let's play a little game.
Who do you think is
more of a real man,
Harry Styles or Vin Diesel?
LeBron James or Bruno Mars?
What about Hugh Jackman
singing and dancing in Les Mis,
versus Hugh Jackman
as Wolverine?
(upbeat music)
Now while you may have your
own personal preferences,
if you answered Vin,
LeBron, or Wolverine,
most people wouldn't give
you much of an argument.
So, does that mean Harry, Bruno,
and singing and dancing
Hugh aren't real men?
Well no, the problem
is the question
doesn't actually make sense,
and yet society keeps
asking what's a real man?
A lot, like 49 million
plus Google results a lot.
And that's probably because
from the very beginning,
meaning like the
moment we're born,
society encourages us
to think that real men
have a finite set of traits.
What are those traits?
Well, there are so many
articles and listicles out there
trying to tell everyone
what real men do or don't do
that I recruited a few
good men to go through
some of our favorites.
Fellows.
- All right, so a lot of
these fall into the line
of the classic manly
man stereotypes
like real men don't cry,
real men eat red meat, and
real men drive stick-shifts.
And apparently only real
men appreciate Gladiator.
- And then, there are the
people who list out generically
positive traits that a real
man is supposed to have
like a real man is cool,
calm, and collected.
A real man has courage.
A real man is physically
strong and can defend himself.
And confusingly, real men
are not lovers or fighters,
they're both simultaneously.
- Lastly, real men are defined
by how they treat women.
Like a real man never
leads a woman on,
and real men have enough
willpower to keep it
in their pants.
Of course, other people
say that real men hook up
with as many women as
possible, so that seems odd.
- Okay, you got that?
All you have to do to
be a real man is follow
an impossibly long list
of contradictory advice.
But if you take a look, there
are some reoccurring themes
you may notice.
Gentlemen.
- Well, a lot of times
they're just trying
to get you to buy stuff.
That's why you see things
like real men eat steak
or real men drive stick-shift.
They're basically saying
if you're a vegetarian
with an automatic, you clearly
don't produce testosterone
and have brought
shame to your family.
- Another group is
trying to convince you
that a vague series of
traits that could belong
to a person of any gender,
like being courageous,
being physically strong,
or being a leader are
somehow masculine traits
rather than gender neutral.
Also, if you're a man who
doesn't possess these traits,
you should feel ashamed.
- This last group, by focusing
on a man's relationship
to a woman, is implicitly
saying that gay and bisexual men
aren't real men.
This is called
heteronormativity,
and these definitions imply
that if you like
kissing other men,
then you just can't be a real
man which is just (bleep).
- Also, what's not
said in these articles
is that the real man myth
essentially discourages
traditionally feminine traits.
I mean, when's the last
time you heard one of these?
- Real men cry at movies,
because real men know
emotional expression
is normal and healthy.
- Real men take care of
children because real men
know how to be
gentle and nurturing.
- Real men focus on the
arts because real men
respect their own desire
for quiet introspection.
Woo, make that painting!
- And our obsession with
the rigid masculinity,
which teaches boys to suppress
their emotions, actually kills.
A 2016 study found that
men who try to conform
to traditional standards of
masculinity are more likely
to deal with depression and
less likely to seek help.
As a result, men are almost
four times more likely to die
from suicide than women.
The real man myth also
feeds into rape culture,
transphobia, and homophobia,
meaning it's not
good for any of us.
- Hey, you know what will
make you a real man, bro?
- Off the top of my head, and
I'm just spit balling here,
sexually objectifying women
and revolving your identity
around how much
sex you're having,
who you're having it with.
- You know it bro.
- Yeah, schmoody.
- Yeah, get it.
- Look, here's the truth.
- Guys who aren't big
and bulky, real men.
- Guys who like
other guys, real men.
- Trans guys, we're real men.
- At the end of the
day, none of the traits
we listed here are
inherent to men,
or women for that matter.
They're merely traits that
some men happen to have,
but some don't, and that's okay.
There are so many
ways to be a man,
and none of them are wrong,
unless you're just
a complete (bleep).
Thanks for watching and
special thanks to our guests
Banari Poulton, Tiq Milan,
and Evan Hoyt Thompson.
Last week in our trans
tropes episode we flubbed
one of our definitions and
we wanted to clear it up.
So cisgender is someone
whose gender identity
matches the one they
were assigned at birth.
Thanks to everyone
who caught this error
and gave us a heads up.
We'll see you next time
right here on Decoded.
