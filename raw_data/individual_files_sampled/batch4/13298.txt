Jason thank you for being here thank you so very much for having me on the show I appreciate so you are you're the new voice for Liberty in America host of the Jason Stapleton program does this at any point break down so it's easy to say I think everybody would basically agree with what you've said until one looks around this frequently very awful political scene in the world and sees some terrible country aggressing against another country or brutalizing its own people or dropping chemical bombs on its own people or whatever and we think well we could go in there and stop those tyrants and those brutal dictators from doing that is there a moral obligation to help when we can in a humanitarian way even if it's not a as a matter of self-defense yeah that's that's a really good question I think that my personal opinion is that there is a moral obligation to help but the that is the individuals responsibility to do so what a libertarian would believe is that okay if we are going to people one of the things I believe about the military is is that the middle that military guys are kind of unique because what they are essentially saying is I will give up my freedom I will give up my Liberty when you sign a military contract you are basically agreeing to go and do whatever the government says you are selling yourself to the government for a period of time and what I have always believed about that is that is a noble virtue to say I'm willing to do that I will turn over my Liberty and I will go so that when the time arises when lit when American liberty and freedom is threatened I will go and I will fight I will go and I will fight so that you don't have to I think that's admirable what I believe our responsibility as American citizens are is to ensure that we never ask them to do that unless it is absolutely necessary to protect American liberty not American interest those are two different things the government will always find an interest where it wants to exert its exert its authority what we're talking about or ISM is a Liberty and if American Liberty isn't threatened then we have no responsibility have no right to send others who have raised their hand to volunteer to go and fight and die for someone else and now get I'm sorry I'm going to say just on the flip side the to your question more specifically about the moral obligation we have if you really believe this is something this is a clip this is something I have I've said to Mark Levin that I have said to to to John McCain and Lindsey Graham I said listen if you want to go fight you believe we need to go over there if you believe that we need to fight that we have a moral obligation to be there then I will pay for your plane ticket and I will buy you a rifle and you can go over there because that's if you really believe that we have a moral obligation then stand up and go I know that if I really believe that my liberty was threatened in my children risked living under the heel of tyrannies boots I would stand up and go fight and so if I'm not there it means I don't think it's important enough to put my own life on the line then I'm not going to ask somebody else to do it for me
