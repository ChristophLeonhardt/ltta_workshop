00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys so I'm taking a break out with</font>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,970
painting to make this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">painted my roommates</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ana's room but</font>

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,569
she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually here she's in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> New</font>

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,000
York because<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's you know super cheeky</font>

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and everything but what I wanted to talk</font>

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,480
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today was dance routines because I</font>

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,590
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you but when I was</font>

9
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,150
little when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in primary school my</font>

10
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,830
friends used to make up really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

11
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,630
dance routines perhaps really cool as an

12
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,070
exaggeration I mean they were possible

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">but to us it seemed great and then when</font>

14
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,189
I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to secondary school we had to</font>

15
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,630
school birthday and every year<font color="#E5E5E5"> on school</font>

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,680
back there you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a dance</font>

17
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,660
and your form would show it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then get</font>

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,279
ranked on certain number of points and

19
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">then of course no songs I Democrat in</font>

20
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,880
there Soulja Boy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thriller which I've</font>

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,410
set dance routines that people learn and

22
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,730
everyone kind of knows the same what's

23
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,200
not about making up your own ones it's

24
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,879
about copying someone else's in both

25
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases there's a sense of engaging with</font>

26
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,120
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone else is creating</font>

27
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
a kind of strange community aspect where

28
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,149
the person you're engaging with doesn't

29
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,469
necessarily know you're engaging with

30
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,700
them they've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> created this thing</font>

31
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,200
with song this dance routine whatever

32
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and people are</font>

33
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,199
responding to it and engaging with it in

34
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,850
a certain way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's really cool</font>

35
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,289
and I was wondering whether people still

36
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,820
do dance routines like<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's little</font>

37
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,140
kids in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the playground still make up</font>

38
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,579
routines those of you with children of

39
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,690
your own or with little sisters or

40
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,340
brothers or who work with children like

41
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,600
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know two people still do the</font>

42
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,099
dance routines is that sort of still

43
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,570
thing I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to wonder if it</font>

44
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,490
isn't still thing like how much the lack

45
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,409
of music television people watch these

46
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,600
days like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> has that affected into it</font>

47
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
the fact that people watch music videos

48
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,540
on their computer rather than

49
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,549
necessarily like having MTV running

50
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,080
constantly in the background has that

51
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,880
meant the music video is less the site

52
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,439
of attention rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just something</font>

53
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,210
that you stream in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the background or or</font>

54
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,040
your watch once or twice and appreciate

55
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,869
rather than watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same video over</font>

56
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,640
and over and<font color="#CCCCCC"> over again in the same way</font>

57
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,750
that you used to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of played</font>

58
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,310
every one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a music</font>

59
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,750
channel a dance routine I really

60
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,100
appreciate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually the full</font>

61
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,659
series of One Tree Hill when I watch one

62
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,100
tree hill when I was much younger all

63
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,479
the girls get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and start dancing this</font>

64
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,860
dance routine to the spice girls song

65
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,299
wanna be my friend Philly and I actually

66
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,590
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn at some</font>

67
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,090
point and we never did learn it I'll put

68
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,409
a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a video in which you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can watch</font>

69
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,820
them doing that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the description bar</font>

70
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,259
below even most<font color="#E5E5E5"> those times when you're</font>

71
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,610
with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and you do something</font>

72
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,229
created together rather than doing your

73
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,939
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative thing together a strange</font>

74
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,290
the central I know but I supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

75
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">differences sitting around and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

76
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,140
your projects but being each other

77
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,090
company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having that social aspect</font>

78
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,740
that you would necessarily have or just

79
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,299
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same creative project</font>

80
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,979
together and presenting it but still

81
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,270
engaging with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that already</font>

82
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,250
exists maybe I'm overthinking it

83
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,780
I don't know white hands of surrender

84
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,830
let me know your thoughts and dance

85
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,910
routines in the comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me know</font>

86
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,290
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your favorite dance routine was a</font>

87
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,090
pre-existing one or whether you came up

88
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,590
with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a particular song</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every know</font>

89
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,850
the last time you did a dance routine

90
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,800
and if you feel you know you want to

91
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">start up doing the dance routine again</font>

92
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,220
you get a song<font color="#E5E5E5"> from like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gft be a</font>

93
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,020
music program or an artist<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>
