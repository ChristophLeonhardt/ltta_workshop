child goddess, the Royal Kumari.

3
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:32,619
Nepali people worship Kumari and believe she
is a reincarnation of the Hindu goddess Durga.

00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,619
Selected as a child, she lives a secluded
life in the Kumari Ghar, and her feet cannot

00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,619
touch the ground.

00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:59,211
Once the current Kumari reaches puberty, a
new goddess is chosen through a series of

00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,211
secret rituals.

00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,211

it a form of child abuse.

00:01:01,211 --> 00:00:00,000
But in 2008, Nepal’s Supreme Court upheld
Kumari worship due to its cultural significance.
