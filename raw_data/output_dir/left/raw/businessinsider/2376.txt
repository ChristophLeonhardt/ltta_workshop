welcome back this is you ask we answer

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,730
where once a week we take your questions

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Twitter from our site from comments</font>

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,590
from your emails and answer them to the

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,840
best of our ability on camera today

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,490
we'll start off the show with a bunch

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,590
from Gordon a regular reader Gordon's

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,689
first question is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to Apple</font>

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,820
when Steve Jobs leaves that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">question we've kind of you know covered</font>

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,660
this several times especially much

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,760
earlier this year when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on medical</font>

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,070
leave and we kind of saw what happened

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,020
to Apple when Steve Jobs leave and the

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,730
answer is not much at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least in the short</font>

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,469
term Tim Cook<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose apples chief</font>

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,600
operating officer ran the company very

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">well while Steve was out you know</font>

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,469
obviously we don't know what what

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">influenced Steve had on some of the</font>

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,129
products that Apple announced this year

22
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,559
while he was out like the 27-inch iMac

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,629
and the new iPhone<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we get a feeling</font>

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,100
that Apple you know could could do

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,600
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well in the short term without</font>

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a different</font>

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">story because steve you know is the kind</font>

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,470
of the brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a lot of the stuff</font>

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">apple does no doubt the iphone would</font>

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,250
have been much different without<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve's</font>

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,619
input no doubt the apple tablet if it

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,509
exists if it's really going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

33
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,100
year would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a different product</font>

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,900
without Steve's input<font color="#E5E5E5"> than with it so</font>

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,509
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> term without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve Jobs</font>

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,369
Apple will probably not be the same

37
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,040
company it is today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> short term you</font>

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,869
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have enough talented engineers</font>

39
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,210
and executives to make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> work next</font>

40
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">question from Gordon well some new</font>

41
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,560
company arise and marginalized and out

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,740
google google a great question again you

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,880
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something a lot of</font>

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies try to niche away at little</font>

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,020
pockets of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the search market and then</font>

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,970
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also companies like Microsoft it</font>

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,220
that try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make these big new things</font>

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,930
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> being that they think will take a</font>

49
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,579
lot of share in a short period of time

50
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,159
it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to out Google</font>

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,159
Google because Google has a huge scale

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,380
advantage they see a lot more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,210
search market than anyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

54
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,890
can make tweaks more effectively than

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,020
other players and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just remember the</font>

56
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,729
search market in general is much larger

57
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,220
now than it was SE 5-10 years ago if

58
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,319
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get 15</font>

59
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,879
I have ten percent of the search market

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,890
that's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more individual people to</font>

61
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,840
convert than it was five or ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,079
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for the short and medium term it</font>

63
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,340
seems that google is in really good

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,170
position<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is what happens</font>

65
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">with Bing and Yahoo once they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> converge</font>

66
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">in and start sharing technology but it's</font>

67
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,280
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see anyone taking meaningful</font>

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,840
share from google at least what we've

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,569
seen so far remember cool they didn't

70
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,090
take anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from google well AOL ever</font>

71
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,730
be relevant again or a powerhouse this

72
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,249
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Gordon we'll see that's that's</font>

73
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,599
one of the questions we're going to be

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the answers to over the next</font>

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,439
year or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a well of course trying to</font>

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,329
radically reconstruct himself into a

77
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,010
sort of Time Inc for the 21st century

78
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,620
under tim armstrong who used to be a

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,169
sales director at<font color="#E5E5E5"> google you know we saw</font>

80
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,879
this week<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their newest plans are</font>

81
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,849
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an automated robotic newsroom</font>

82
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,620
where thousands of freelancers around

83
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,079
the country get assignments for news

84
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,389
stories we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that works you know</font>

85
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,829
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if that the quality is there</font>

86
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">if the stories are interesting enough if</font>

87
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,849
the AOL can handle all the editing and

88
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,590
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they can make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that business</font>

89
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,659
profitable remember a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> aol's</font>

90
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,189
profits still come from their dial-up

91
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,979
business which is shrinking so you know

92
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tim Armstrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for either make AOL into a</font>

93
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,629
massive online publishing beast or it

94
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:30,269
could be a total<font color="#E5E5E5"> flop we'll see last</font>

95
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,370
question from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gordon is windows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 going</font>

96
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,290
to bring Microsoft Intel and Dell back

97
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,099
to their past glory or is it over will

98
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">be hard for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to return</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to past glory</font>

99
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,989
because each of them has has changed

100
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,400
kind of a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> composition of</font>

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,409
their business especially some of the

102
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,540
hardware guys well at least dell which

103
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,729
is moving a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from the from</font>

104
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">the desktop computers windows 7 the big</font>

105
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,769
question here is whether companies are

106
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade because they did not</font>

107
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">upgrade to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> windows vista from XP at</font>

108
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,259
least not nearly as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft</font>

109
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,389
was hoping so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not if you know</font>

110
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,799
obviously consumers are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font>

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and buy new computers and they're going</font>

112
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,120
to ship with windows 7 pre-installed but

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,409
our big company is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to order</font>

114
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,739
thousands and tens of thousands of

windows seven licenses probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

116
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,060
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else what else they can do they</font>

117
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,409
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace their computers at some</font>

118
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,089
point and at some point XP is not going

119
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,019
to work

120
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,000
probably not the glory days as the past

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,479
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see any trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,810

webos and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pixie have disappointed me</font>

124
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,090
at least so far you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot of the</font>

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,620

127
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for palm right now is</font>

128
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,909
distribution and developers palm right

129
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,680
now is only on sprint it's the

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,759
third-largest US carrier it's shrinking

131
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,710
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best place to be the only</font>

132
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,199

133
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,090
they can sell their products at verizon

134
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,310
and AT&T which are the biggest as well

135
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,590
as in some foreign countries maybe palm

136
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,419
can make it on their own the other

137
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,860
problem developers of course there's

138
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,930
only you know a tiny handful of Palm

139
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,139
webOS apps compared to the iphone yeah

140
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,479
you could say that quality is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> vs</font>

141
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">iphone but i don't see that either so</font>

142
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,560
what palm needs are it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

143
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">chicken and egg problem they need more</font>

144
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,650
developers and they need more buyers of

145
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,569
their phones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know with more</font>

146
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,189
apps for more buyers with more buyers

147
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,129
for more apps palms best hope of course

148
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,020
is to be bought out by someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell</font>

149
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,389
or nokia<font color="#CCCCCC"> or research in motion or</font>

150
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">microsoft whether that's going to happen</font>

151
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,060
we'll see probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for palm</font>

152
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,930
today but in a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they don't</font>

153
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,180
radically grow their market share and

154
