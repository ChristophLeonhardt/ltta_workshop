TO BRETT KAVANAUGH, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HATS EVER SWORN IN A FORMER CLERK TO TAKE HIS SEAT. A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT WHICH REMINDS US THAT FREEDOM IS A TRADITION PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. IT IS UP TO REDEDICATE OURSELVES TO THE TRADITIONS AND WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDERS. AND IT IS UP TO US TO RENEW THE BONDS OF LOVE, LOYALTY, AND AFFECTION THAT LINK US ALL TOGETHER AS ONE GREAT AMERICAN FAMILY. BRIAN: WE'RE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AS A COUNTRY. STEVE: THANK GOODNESS DID. IT DO THE TRICK? LET'S BRING IN SEAN SEAN SPICER FORMER PRESS SECRETARY AND SPOKESMAN FOR AMERICA FIRST ACTION. SEAN, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PRESIDENT, HIS COMMENTS LAST NIGHT AND THEN BEFORE HE GOT TO THAT THOUGH, HE DID APOLOGIZE TO BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY FOR WHAT HE WENT THROUGH IN THAT VERY BRUISING CONFIRMATION HEARING. WELL, I THINK FOR EVERY CONSERVATIVE, FOR EVERY REPUBLICAN THAT WONDERED WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT ELECTION WAS GOING TO MAKE OR WONDERED HOW TRUMP WOULD GOVERN, LAST NIGHT YOU SAW THE 69TH JUDICIAL NOMINATION UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE SECOND SUPREME COURT, THE 26TH CIRCUIT. AND DOZENS OF APPEAL COURSE THIS PRESIDENT'S LEGACY WILL GO DOWN AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS RESHAPED THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO STRICT CONSTRUCTAL LIST. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE WIN FOR THIS PRESIDENT. IT HAS GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS HEADED INTO A KEY MIDTERM ELECTION. AINSLEY: WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT STICKING BY HIM? YOU HAD JUSTICE KAVANAUGH LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY AND SAYING THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNWAVERING SUPPORT. LOOK, ANXIOUSLY. I KNOW YOU HAD CHARLIE ON A LITTLE WHILE AGO TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THIS ELECTIONS. AMERICA FIRST HAS BEEN OUT THERE WITH OVER $20 MILLION IN ADS. THIS IS GOING TO BE TIGHT. WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND KAVANAUGH DID WAS GALVANIZED REPUBLICANS. THERE WAS A MASSIVE ENTHUSIASM GAP FAVORING DEMOCRATS 30 DAYS OUT. THIS HAS MADE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE OF A REPUBLICAN SENATE AND A REPUBLICAN HOUSE VERSUS ONE CONTROLLED BY CHUCK SCHUMER AND NANCY PELOSI. THIS HAS TIGHTENED THE GAP. REPUBLICANS ARE NOW OUT THERE. NOT AS MUCH. WE HAVE GOT CLOSE RACES IN PLACES LIKE INDIANA, FLORIDA, MISSOURI, MONTANA. WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE. BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT FIGHT MEANS AND THE NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE WITH WEEKS LEFT. BRIAN: A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO CNN PUT OUT A POLL AND THE 36%. OTHER AT 45%. IT'S NOW AT 41% WITH THIS APPROVAL AT 52%. SO IT'S GONE UP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. NOW THE GENERIC POLL FROM DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WHEN ASKED WHO DO YOU WANT IN OFFICE IN YOUR STATE, IN YOUR DISTRICT IS NOW JUST A 7 POINT GAP. WHAT ARE THE REPUBLICANS UP AGAINST RIGHT NOW? WELL, AGAIN, I THINK IN A MIDTERM ELECTION YOU HAVE TO LOOK STATE BY STATE. DISTRICT BY DISTRICT. IN THE SENATE I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF CLOSE RACES BUT I THINK WE ARE POISED TO PICK UP A BUNCH OF SEATS. YOU LOOK AT HEITKAMP IN NORTH DAKOTA. NO QUESTION KEVIN CRAMER IS POISED TO BE THE NEXT SENATOR FROM THERE. SENATOR RICK SCOTT EXCUSE ME GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB IN FLORIDA AGAINST BILL NELSON. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A REPUBLICAN PICKUP. MARSHA BLACKBURN HAS SURGED AHEAD IN TENNESSEE. IN THE SENATE WE ARE LOOKING GOOD. MITCH MCCONNELL'S NOMINATION SOLIDIFIED THAT IN THE HOUSE I HAVE GOT TO BE HONEST, IT'S CLOSE. REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE DISTRICT BY DISTRICT. WE ARE LOOKING AT CONTINUING TO PUT MONEY INTO THESE KEY DISTRICTS TO PUT THEM OVER THE TOP. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE. I THINK THAT THIS LAST FEW WEEKS HAS REALLY HELPED GALVANIZE THE ENTHUSIASM AMONG KEY IN KEY DISTRICTS AS WE HEAD INTO. THIS. STEVE: RIGHT. ONE REALLY INTERESTING POINT THAT'S NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE KEY WITNESSES ON THE HOUSE SIDE A LOT IN THE IOWA, MINNESOTA. WISCONSIN. PLACES THAT HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE PRESIDENT'S RENEGATION OF NAFTA. NOW THE U.S.-MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT, THOSE POLICIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE WHETHER IT'S DAIRY FARMERS, AUTO WORKERS. PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF TRADE AND FAIR TRADE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID IS GOING TO HELP HIM. THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT A LOT OF THOSE KEY MIDWEST RACES WHETHER THEY ARE AGRICULTURE BASED OR MANUFACTURING BASED. THE PRESIDENT'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THOSE FRONTS IN PARTICULAR ARE GOING TO BENEFIT THEM HEADING INTO THE KEY. BRIAN: DON'T BE SURPRISED IF NORTH CAROLINA, THE FLOODS. PEOPLE HAVE HISTORIC LOSSES HOW THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO REACT THERE GETTING THEM FUNDS. NOW WITH A HURRICANE ABOUT TO HIT FLORIDA, WHICH IS IN THE BALANCE FOR GOVERNORSHIP AS WELL AS THE SENATE SEAT, PERFORMANCE MATTER THERE ON BOTH COUNTS. YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT AND CARE FOR ITS PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY. AND SO WHILE WE PRAY FOR THESE FOLKS AS THEY HEAD INTO THESE KEY MOMENTS. BOTH THE VICTIMS OF THE RECENT STORMS AND THE ONES THAT ARE ABOUT TO HIT. HOW THEY PERFORM AT BOTH A STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WILL BE IMPORTANT. STEVE: SURE. JANICE IS GOING TO GIVE US
