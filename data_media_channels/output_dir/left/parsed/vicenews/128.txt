right I feel so awkward and weird
I really like that I feel like I always
gravitate towards kind of like whiny
very reverb out sort of washy vocal like
that's a coolness to that song feel like
I'm back in a movie driving somewhere
cool
what is it
I'm a big fan of auto-tune auto-tune is
like so emotional like it makes
sound so like powerful to me and
emotional and it really bothers me when
people like don't like thinks that it's
like a valid or artistic tool when I
listen to the song I just feel like I'm
lost in the world of the song it makes
me feel like I'm escaping and I like the
combination of the more real
instrumentation mixed with the auto-tune
I need to go with a waste I'm a strong
boy I could never stand with a wheeze
huh no pass alone I say go don't worry
about me I got my guys in the place yeah
I'd really like UK rap he sounds great
the beats great his flow is really good
it makes me wanna dance

there's gonna be like one of those songs
that like girls sing to other girls

screaming it girls feeling themselves
being like that guy yeah that
