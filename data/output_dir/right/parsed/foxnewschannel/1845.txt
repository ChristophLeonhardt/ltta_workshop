SIMPSON DID NOT RESPOND TO FOX'S
QUESTION ON THE SOURCE.
MAR HARTHANK YOU.
REPRESENTATIVE PETER KING WHO
SITS ON THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMISSION.
AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
TONIGHT.
VERY STRONG PIECE BY KIM,
SUGGESTING THAT POTENTIALLY AN
OUTFIT IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, DO
YOU THINK THAT IS THE CASE?
>> WE HAVE REASON THAT THERE
COULD HAVE BEEN AN FBI SPY IN
THE CAMPAIGN AND SOMEONE
AFFILIATED WITH THE FBI AND
DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE
ARE TRYING TO PIN DOWN AND MAKE
SURE IT IS THE CASE.
IF IT IS, IT RAISES SERIOUS
QUESTIONS.
THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE
INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN THE FIRST
PLACE AND WHY THE FISA WAS
GIVEN.
WHO ROLE WAS IT.
IF HE WAS AN FBI OPERATIVE.
AND WAS HE PUT THERE BY THE FBI?
YOU HAVE A FBI SPYING ON THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND THERE
ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THIS.
THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.
AND IF THERE WAS A REAL
JUSTIFICATION AND MAYBE YOU
CONSIDER IT.
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE IS IT NO
CONSIDERATION IN THE BEGINNING.
INVESTIGATION AND NEVER MIND
HAVING A SPY IN THE CAMPAIGN.
>> Martha: DEVIN NUNEZ AND TREY
GOWDY WERE BROUGHT OVER TO LOOK
AT THE DOCUMENTS AND THEY WERE
NOT GIVEN THE DOCUMENTS TO LOOK
AT THEMSELVES.
AND THEY WERE BRIEFED ON THE
DOCUMENTS AND ADDED TO THE
NOTION, CONGRESSMAN, THEY ARE SO
CLOSE TO THE VEST WITH ALL OF
THE INFORMATION AND EVEN WITH
THE CONGRESSIONAL JOBS IT IS TO
HAVE OVERSIGHT OF JUDARY AND
INTELLIGENCE?
>> YEAH, YOU ARE RIGHT.
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO HOLD IT
BACK.
AND THE FBI HAS LEAKED THINGS TO
THE MEDIA AND THAT ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT GETTING IT OUT.
NO, IT IS TITLE TO THE
INVESTIGATION AND VITAL TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED AND ANDREW McCABE.
AND THE INVESTIGATION AND PEOPLE
RESIGNING AND PEOPLE MAY BE
INDICTED AND THEY WERE RUNNING
THE INVESTIGATION AND ADD THE
ELEMENT TO IT.
AND IT IS AMAZING PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS TARGETED HERE AND
INVESTIGATED AND SO MUCH WENT
WRONG IN THE OTHER FBI END AND
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE STONE WALLING
US.
AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ADD.
THE PRESIDENT CAN ORDER THEM TO
RE
R
RELEASE THIS.
IF THEY CAN'T FIND A REASONABLE
SOLUTION THE PRESIDENT CAN.
>> Martha: YOU HAVE AN
INDICATION HE WOULD LIKE TO DO
THAT AND IF NOT, WHY NOT?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
GETTING CLOSER TO THAT.
AND THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE THE
PRESIDENT IN THE LAST WEEK OR
SO.
THE FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
DID THAT GIVING THE INFORMATION
WOULD COST SOMEONE'S LIFE AT
RISK.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THE PRESIDENT IS STARTING TO
REALIZE THEY ARE PUTTING ONE
OVER ON HIM.
>> Martha: WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
GLENN SIMPSON TESTIFIED IN FRONT
OF THE COMMITTEE, THE REASON
THEY BELIEVED CHRISTOPHER
STEELE'S DOSSIER THEY HAD AN
INTERNAL SOURCE IN THE CAMPAIGN
THAT COROBRATED THIS.
AND LOOK AT THE UNMASKINGS AND
THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS.
IT FEELS LIKE IT IS POSSIBLE
THEY HAD SOMEBODY WHO WAS INSIDE
AND CONFIRMING SOME OF THIS FOR
THEM.
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE AND THEY
FEEL THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE
RUSSIAN COLLUSION INVESTIGATION,
WHY WOULD NOT THEY BE WILLING TO
SAY THIS IS THE EVIDENCE AND
MAKE SURE WE GOT THIS
INFORMATION THIS WAY?
>> THEY CAN TURN IT AROUND ON US
COMPLETELY IF THEY CAN SHOW THAT
THIS PERSON WAS SIGNIFICANT.
AND IT IS ALL UNRAVELLING IN
FRONT OF THEM AND DOING ALL THEY
CAN TO COVER THEMSELVES.
