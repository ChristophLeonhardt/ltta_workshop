on to speech codes to make sure college

is a safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> place where people can hear</font>

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,330
new ideas without ever hearing any new

ideas students have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,590
how to have free and open discussions

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,509
without discussing things and a free and

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,490
open way in this manner<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can educate</font>

our young to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> truth without</font>

anyone like the truth for instance one

University journalism school says we

should stop using the word terrorism

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,020
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it might imply that an act of</font>

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,570

also advises student students to avoid

quote gendering a non gender activity

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,579
for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a real example</font>

they should not refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their parents</font>

as mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> and father because that</font>

00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,070
suggests one of them impregnated the

have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> children turned into idiots</font>

63
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,969
at Smith College the student newspaper

64
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,280
decided it should no longer use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,560
crazy because it privileged people who

didn't happen to think that their

67
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,980
breakfast cereal formed the face that

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,810
was secretly laughing at them every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they turned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away to drink their orange</font>

juice which it obviously was doing the

71
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,879
newspaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff agreed it would no</font>

72
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,040
longer use crazy or any other word or

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
phrase that would represent the world as

<font color="#E5E5E5">it actually is from now on the newspaper</font>

75
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,549
staff decided it will only use phrasing

76
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,620
intended to deceive their audience into

77
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,239
believing the editors personal political

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,939
opinions represent reality after making

<font color="#E5E5E5">this decision the staff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was immediately</font>

108
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,209
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so a guy wrote a piece a</font>

109
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,009
few days ago a guy named George Freeman

110
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,639
in geopolitical futures<font color="#CCCCCC"> com it was</font>

111
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,560
called not much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as new in this election</font>

112
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,989
and he says as usual each candidate and

113
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,519
their partisans are predicting total

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,349
catastrophe of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> wins there are</font>

115
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,970
also claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there has never been an</font>

116
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,040
election like this in history as is

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,079
normally the case the candidate of the

118
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,120
party out of power is claiming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,829
United States has reached a catastrophic

120
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,659
point because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current government</font>

121
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,699
the other candidate is saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

122
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,440
country is not collapsing but that it

123
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,969
will collapse<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the opposition's</font>

124
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,529
candidate is elected this is pretty

125
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,430
normal stuff

126
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,410
including the belief by much of the

127
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">public that there has never been such an</font>

128
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,580
election before but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is wrong there</font>

129
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,430
have been others with much more at stake

130
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point I am making is that the</font>

131
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,340
impression that there has never been an

132
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,930
election like this one is common in

133
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,389
every election cycle and charges that

134
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,919
one of the candidates is a criminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,660
the other is psychotic have been

136
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,000
standard fare in American elections my

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,530
standard is whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lectin either</font>

138
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,300
candidate will cause a civil war short

139
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,710
of that it is safe to conclude that the

140
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,449
Republic will survive either of them and

141
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,340
the one elected whoever it is might

142
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,259
surprise us now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's a</font>

143
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,340
really interesting take and it's

144
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,229
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> my take through most of history</font>

145
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,810
most of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life I sit and think you know</font>

146
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that before we'll get through it</font>

147
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,410
and i think and i definitely think we'll

148
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,940
get through this i don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

149
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end necessarily of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Republic I do</font>

150
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,340
think however that it is true that these

151
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,169
two people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a criminal and a</font>

152
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,729
psychotic I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

153
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">two worst people that I've ever seen I</font>

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
mean I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a lot of elections and</font>

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,599
I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen two people like this who</font>

156
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:27,960
are truly damaged individuals and it

157
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,610
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about the country and the</font>

158
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,020
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the country that they're the</font>

159
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,490
nominees and it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

160
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,930
process it says something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about us that</font>

161
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we would nominate them but there was a</font>

162
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,830
piece in The New York Times yesterday I

163
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">think just saying that nine percent of</font>

164
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,270
the people had had it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

165
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,740
voice in this nine percent of the people

166
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,599
had nominated these people people maybe

167
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,699
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes down to it really</font>

168
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:48,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes down to the fact that somehow</font>

169
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,330
we've developed this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> where so</font>

170
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,880
few people are participating<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

171
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,680
know it's funny conservatives are fond

172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,849
of pointing out that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

173
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be democracy it's supposed</font>

174
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,520
to be a republic there's supposed to be

175
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,340
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> checkpoints</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between the people</font>

176
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,979
and power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that logic fell apart</font>

177
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,330
almost immediately you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that fell</font>

178
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">apart really when the founding fathers</font>

179
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,949
passed as they started to pass from the

180
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,110
scene Andrew Jackson was elected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

181
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,389
Andrew Jackson you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know John Quincy</font>

182
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,000
Adams looked at that was a or Samuel I'm

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,060
sorry were the John Adams son looked at

184
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,639
that and said this is insane this guy is

185
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,199
allowed you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a terrible</font>

186
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,849
thing to elevate this guy and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

187
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have compared him to Donald Trump</font>

188
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,570
which I find absurd because Andrew

189
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,300
Jackson was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact a guy who basically</font>

190
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,990
won the Indian Wars at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Battle of</font>

191
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,540
shubh end and fought off the British of

192
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,890
course in the Battle of New Orleans and

193
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,530
so he had actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplished a lot of</font>

194
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,090
heroic stuff and the people there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

195
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,830
reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people to elevate and the</font>

196
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,570
point that they did these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

197
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,480
nuts these two people I gotta say that I

198
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,620
the stuff that happened over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weekend</font>

199
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,500
and that is still going on is frankly

200
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,510
appalling you know so this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

201
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">with Trump is still reverberating the</font>

202
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,320
media now think they've got him you know

203
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,060
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been all this all these moments</font>

204
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,530
in the Trump campaign when the media

205
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,540
said this is it he called the judge a

206
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,100
Mexican we've got him you know is that

207
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,020
he made<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a reporter for being</font>

208
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,790
handy yet we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got him now</font>

209
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,260
and he keeps you know he keeps slipping

210
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,880
away he's like the guy in the cartoon

211
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,950
you know with one leap the Dirk was free

212
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,350
you know I truck this bit like that he

213
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,810
keeps getting out of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these coils</font>

214
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,270
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time see he's not dealing with</font>

215
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,650
nine percent of the people he's now

216
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,150
dealing with everybody and people are

217
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting to pay attention and what he</font>

218
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,590
did was pretty bad now he's blaming the

219
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,840
preso he have Trump comes out and he

220
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,910

them is the first trunk up the biggest

222
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem we have is we have a very</font>

dishonest media we have a media that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

224
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,290
so dishonest that no matter what makes

horrible story the New York<font color="#CCCCCC"> Times very</font>

245
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,720
dishonest but it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be out of business</font>

246
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,339
soon I

247

<font color="#CCCCCC">all right fat check true the New York</font>

248
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,930
Times has become a terrible newspaper

249
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,550
when I call in the former newspaper I'm

250
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,810
not kidding they used to be a great

251
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,610
paper I mean conservatives always

252
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,720
complained about the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> york times</font>

253
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,970
whenever they did a real study you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

254
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,199
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old days we're talking about</font>

255
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sixties and seventies you know</font>

256
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:02,170
whenever they did a real study of their

257
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,360
bias they came out pretty fairly this is

258
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,430
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> they op-ed page this is the front</font>

259
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,040
page now Trump is absolutely right they

260
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,500
score I mean it's almost comic it's like

261
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,709
a it's like a broadsheet that some lefty

262
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,839
is handing out anti-trump so that's one

263
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:17,829
thing he said that was true and the

264
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,149
other one was this he was talking about

265
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,970
Bernie Sanders conceding to Hillary

266
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,220
Clinton he made this comment if he would

267
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have just not done anything just go home</font>

268
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,240
go to sleep relax he would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

269
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,850
hero but he made a deal with the devil

270
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,110
she's the devil he made a deal with the

271
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact check true that's all but here's</font>

272
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,779
the thing I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only do they hate</font>

273
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,689
Trump but they also cover for Hillary

274
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,540
Clinton I mean only all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coverage</font>

275
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,040
this stuff is getting put but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart</font>

276
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,889
up about how much coverage but this is

277
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,170
how much coverage Patricia Smith speech

278
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,480
got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> her son who died at Benghazi</font>

279
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,680
versus how much coverage you know Kaiser

280
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,290
con got for his son who died in Iraq and

281
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,089
it's obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference I mean this</font>

282
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">is these this media is incredibly</font>

283
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,970
dishonest and but but the problem is

284
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,029
just because the media is are dishonest

285
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,819
doesn't mean the Trump is not a skunk I

286
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,740
mean this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible thing to say</font>

287
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing that he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said you know let</font>

288
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">me read to you a little bit of Bret</font>

it means you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know beating Hillary</font>

294
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,939
Clinton is basically to condemn yourself

and the Republican Party to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Perdition</font>

297
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,800
argument he says there's an old saying

will impeach her they'll get rid of her

324
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,250
and and the press will actually turn on

we have about race that the first black

president had to be a saint even if he

329
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,900
was a scandal-ridden you know demagogue

330
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,370
he had to be a saint because he was

331
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,600

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,090
goes on to say but to say there are no

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,680
permanent victories or defeats in

340
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,570

them will always be tainted by

347
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,530
association and he goes on to talk about

348
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,990
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what it meant when Trump</font>

349
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,740
in that obvious tick he obviously

350
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't stop himself when after mrs.</font>

351
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,600
Khan for not saying anything in see he

352
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,130
was suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt very obviously</font>

353
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,260
that because she was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Muslim she was</font>

354
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,720
being silenced and that that ugly little

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,700
thing he did where he said you know a

356
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,980
lot of people have said this is just me

357
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,350
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'd like I've like a list I'd</font>

358
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,990
like a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> names you know and and so</font>

359
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,470
the you

360
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,180
do get polluted I mean we've talked

361
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,700
about this a lot that one of the reasons

362
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,770
I was so desperate for Trump not to be

363
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,100
nominated is because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the MSM</font>

364
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,880
says we are he is what Democrats always

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,150
say we are he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a blundering you know</font>

366
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,360
kind of bigoted you know demagogue he is

367
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,190
that guy that they always<font color="#E5E5E5"> said if they</font>

368
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,660
said mitt romney was and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep saying</font>

369
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,220
well yeah you said the same thing about

370
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,560
Mitt Romney right but the even in the

371
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,330
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the boy who cries wolf the wolf</font>

372
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,430
does show up and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem with</font>

373
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,380
Donald Trump you know take a look for a

374
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,390
minute this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens to people</font>

375
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,970
when they attach themselves to a human

376
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">being instead of principle okay</font>

377
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,020
especially if it's a bad human being

378
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,300
like Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike Pence vice</font>

379
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,520
presidential candidate gives a he has a

380
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,140
campaign event and a military mom stands

381
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,820
up to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she asks a question</font>

382
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:14,930
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mr.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pence's time and time</font>

383
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,790
again Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> has disrespected our</font>

384
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,860
nation's armed forces and veterans and

385
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,200
is disrespect for mr. Khan and his

386
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">family's dismissive</font>

387
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,280
okay how do you talk see here's this

388
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,560
woman got up at a public event a

389
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,210
campaign event and she asked a question

390
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,890
she asked it in a civilized way she had

391
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,150
she's obviously not a trump supporter

392
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,190
she's a military mom and now these guide

393
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,190
her like she's a villain in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pantomime</font>

394
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,160
you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you get that's what</font>

395
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,690
it looks like to be corrupted by

396
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,400
following a person instead of a

397
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle and listen to pence respond</font>

398
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,110
with genuine decency well I thank you

399
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,310

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,130
freedom looks like and that's a freedom

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:20,100
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> line okay let me just say first I</font>

403

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,810
country and your families let me say I

405
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,160
know this has been much in the news of

406
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,150
late in the last few days but as I said

407
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,730
last night as Donald Trump said with

408
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,120
Saturday night captain Kahn is an

409
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,460
American<font color="#CCCCCC"> hero and we honor him and</font>

410
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,650
honored his family as we do all the

411
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,310
things

412
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,069
we can stop it there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he basically</font>

413
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:51,709
comes around he talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the heroic</font>

414
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,149
death of<font color="#E5E5E5"> captain camera shot apparently</font>

415
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">was genuinely heroic chasing people away</font>

416
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">from a car a cab before it blew up</font>

417
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,889
what's so sad about this I mean you see

418
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">pence bringing people back to their</font>

419
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,459
better selves you know reminding them

420
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,170
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this course this is what</font>

421
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,430
freedom looks like it looks like people

422
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking questions that are uncomfortable</font>

423
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't have to boo them down we want</font>

424
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shout them down he's perfectly</font>

425
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,670
capable of answering the question for

426
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,559
himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes on to talk about Trump's</font>

427
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,149
dedication to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> military and do the</font>

428
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,069
vice presidential<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that he does but</font>

429
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:20,689
what's really disturbing about this is

430
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,610
this used to be normal discourse this

431
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,350
used to be what we expected what they

432
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,999
used to be I'm talking about four years

433
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,189
ago this used to be what we expected of

434
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:29,990
our politicians is it phony as a

435
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,639
hypocritical who cares this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

436
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,230
civilized people behave with one another

437
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,019
you know part of hypocrisy<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what do</font>

438
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,670
they call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tribute that vice pays</font>

439
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,410
to virtue you know it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

440
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,720
that you do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you showing people</font>

441
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,910
how we are supposed to behave and that's

442
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">what Pence is doing and good on in but</font>

443

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,960
she had any reason to believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

473
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,150
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> classified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upset he said a</font>

474
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,490
reasonable person in her position should

475
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,590
have known they were classified even if

476
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,090
they weren't marked well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

477
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving out the fact that these emails</font>

478
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,380
were coming from hundreds of State

479

Department employees these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time</font>

480
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
tenured State Department professionals

work for different<font color="#CCCCCC"> administrations this</font>

482
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,550
isn't you know these these folks are not

483
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,650
partisan they were the one sending her

484
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,620
the emails she he in his mind but he had

485
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,160
no real that position though because

486
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,600
they had no other outlet to communicate

487
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,370
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her so you can't really put the</font>

488
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,200
blame on State Department professionals

489
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,820
if the leader of their organization is

490
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,010
staying email us<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this address this is</font>

all the only option you have well

492
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,070
classified information is sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a</font>

493
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,080
completely separate system so it was

494
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,730
their decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send oh yeah i know</font>

495

497
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,600
though she was forcing everybody that

498
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,790
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate with her to move</font>

499
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,800
out of the classified<font color="#E5E5E5"> realm where you</font>

500
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,110
send classified information and then put

true you do just don't send classified

505
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,530
information over the unclassified system

506
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,000
and they know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font>

507
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,550

512
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,450
were just civil service workers you know

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,020
piece called why can't Hillary stop

529
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,350
lying in the Atlantic

540
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,440
would win why Kenny<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here's Ron</font>

541
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,150
Fournier wondering the same thing about

542
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,850
Hillary Clinton she did violate policy

543
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,960
we know that she did expose us secrets

544
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,390
on a rogue sir Ron White as we know it

545
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,340
another way wait wait why did she lie

546
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,470
when she knew she was lying and she knew

547
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everybody knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that she was like</font>

548
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,640
why didn't she just brush it off and say

549
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,059
I made mistakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm terribly sorry I've</font>

550
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,400
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> chasing by the FBI director I</font>

551
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,190
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> break any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laws but sometimes I</font>

552
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,600
have to hold myself to a higher standard

553
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,280
I won't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same a second why can't</font>

554
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,110
you say that her own supporters are

555
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,510
asking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I don't know that's</font>

556
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a mystery now for what has been 18</font>

557
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:11,900
months that I think she'd put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

558
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,460
selection away a long time ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> as she</font>

559
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">had come clean on email now all she's</font>

560
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,419
got to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially after last week</font>

561
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,370
look she had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great convention a very</font>

562
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,429
aspirational message and nicely tucking

563
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:25,220
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argument that Trump is not fit to</font>

564
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,409
be President argument that I really

565
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:28,940
agree with that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats a lot</font>

566
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,929
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> independence even a lot of</font>

567
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,030
Republicans agree with that he would be

568
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,460
a bad man to be President so all she's

569
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,130
got to do now is get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of her own way</font>

570
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">why why why underscore what the one</font>

571
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,020
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's holding her back from</font>

572
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,700
being president which is how dishonest

573
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,740
she's been about the scandal it's

574
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,830
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who she is she can't do</font>

575
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,780
it any more than Trumpkin stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

576
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,610
these are two pathological people and

577
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">despite what the fellow was saying that</font>

578
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">they we've had these people and there's</font>

579
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">always one who's being called a criminal</font>

580
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,490
and one who's being called a psychotic

581
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,919
these before actually pathologically

582
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,960
criminal and pathologically social you

583
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a sociopath I mean they really are</font>

584
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,559
these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Republic but I will say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

586
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,340
i will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to my fellow</font>

587
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,809
conservatives and to my fellow

588
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:14,330
Republicans you know all these years all

589
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,950
these years people have been saying to

590
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,760
me they lie the mainstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> media lies</font>

591

don't we lie back why they fight why

595
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,520
don't we fight back and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

596
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,010
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are the good guys you can't</font>

597
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,740
beat the bad guys by lying you the bad

598
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,390
guys lie because that's their the bad

599
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,400
guys you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to win with the</font>

truth we have to win with the truth

601
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,300
because it's all we've got it's all we

602
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,070

does but it always comes back and it

606
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,290
does occasionally win and when it wins

607
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,270
you can have like when Reagan one you

608
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,760
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like 25 good years just by</font>

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,320
turning the ship in that direction it

610
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,900
took them a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took several</font>

611
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,820
presidencies to turn the ship back

612
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">around in this destructive direction all</font>

623
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,420
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the culture some more you</font>

624
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,650
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

625
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,660
culture because I feel that that's where

626
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,340
the I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Hillary Clinton gonna</font>

627
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,600
win at this point that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it</font>

628
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,460
looks or poles are really good I don't

629
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,870
see how Trump comes back from this I

630
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,040
could be wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> predicting</font>

631
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,480
anything I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the way</font>

632
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,310
it looks right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

633
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,810
fight is in the culture and actually

634
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,250
that's true whether Hillary winds are

635
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,020
not because even if Trump wins the fight

636
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,730
for conservatism by which I mean freedom

637
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,120
by which I mean freedom in small

638
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,040
government limited government to let the

639
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,290
individual be free is going to take

640
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,850
place in the culture so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

641
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the thing one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

642
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">conservatives do is they're always</font>

643
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,070
condemning movies that people love

644
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,900
because they have bad things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in them and</font>

645
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,430
they sell bad values and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

646
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,110
yesterday about Bonnie and Clyde a movie

647
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,120
that romanticizes violence and takes

648
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,280
these two hideous murderous thugs and

649
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,660
turns them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful romantic</font>

650
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,220
characters and what do you do how do you

651
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,860
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a work of art that is a work</font>

652
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,260
of art that is a beautiful movie that

653
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,390
does certain bad things and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

654
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,090
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that in my</font>

655
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,980
journey to becoming a Christian one of

656
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,180
the things that turned me away from

657
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">atheism was reading the Marquis de saw</font>

658
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,640
this hideous pornographic sadistic

659
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,940
philosopher of genius who

660
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,490
who put forward and a an argument for

661
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,740
atheism that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought was the only</font>

662
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,630
argument for atheism I've ever heard

663
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually held together now somebody</font>

664
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,930
on the comments section of the podcast

665
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,350
was attacking me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for saying he says I</font>

666
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">used this one crazy dude as the</font>

667
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,970
spokesman<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all atheists ideals and I</font>

668
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,430
didn't do that at all it was in a course

669
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,640
of reading a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> atheist philosophers</font>

670
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,350
and picking them apart because their

671
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,820
theories didn't hold together that I

672
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,950
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon sod and realized oh yeah this</font>

673
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,410
guy holds together and he's evil yet

674
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,570
home and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this atheistic</font>

675
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,030
philosophy journeys into evil if you

676
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,910
follow it logically by the way when

677
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,770
people put<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments saying that I say</font>

678
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,330
stupid somebody said you say keep saying

679
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,280
stupid things and then he says something

680
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I didn't actually say I just think</font>

681
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
me you know you're hearing stupid things

682
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,080
and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different different</font>

683
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,490
problem so that but that experience

684
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,710
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I outlined in my memoir the great</font>

685
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,670
good thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience gives me has</font>

686
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,890
given me a lot of patience with great

687
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,130
works that seem evil to us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

688
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,080
why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't condemn things and call for</font>

689
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,580
censorship and all this stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

690
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,010
fine feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great</font>

691
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,810
work of art even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's a good work of</font>

692
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,150
art there is a path to truth in it but

693
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are responsible for finding it</font>

694
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,540
because the artist may be a jackass

695
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,640
talent is blind you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the artist may</font>

696
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,970
be evil and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> desaad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an evil guy so</font>

697
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know so I was thinking about this</font>

698
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,960
idea of violence and I love violence

699
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,730
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> i write violence stories I mean</font>

700
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,930
I'm the thriller writer i write stories

701
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,510
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> with tough guys and and bad women</font>

702
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,130
who do terrible things to one another

703
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,630
and they're exciting and all this stuff

704
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's how to react to violence as a</font>

705
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,610
metaphor because we see this you know

706
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,310
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i worked in the tough guy</font>

707
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,690
genre i still work kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the tough</font>

708
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,360
guy genre and and it started the tough

709
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,160
guy genre that started with like Sam

710
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,680
Spade Dashiell Hammett's detective Sam

711
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,960
Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Raymond

712
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
Chandler's great novels about Philip

713
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,460
Marlowe was really an attempt to rebuild

714
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,250
the moral logic of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> West after World</font>

715
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">War one after World War</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one it seemed</font>

716
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,840
like what was this culture about that

717
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,520
would just wipe out a generation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of men</font>

718
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,890
over nothing

719
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,570
you know and Christianity came into

720
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,000
disrepute at that point and the entire

721
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,740
ideas of the West<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cayman and that's when</font>

722
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,500
the left really started its destructive

723
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,300
rise because they were filling in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

724
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,120
gap you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was this continent in</font>

725
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,880
ruins this generation laid waste for

726
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,010
nothing and so some of these writers

727
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,550
were trying to rebuild a moral framework

728
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,930
which the left had had through

729
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,970
Christianity and which was now gone and

730
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,010
Sam Spade was an existentialist who

731
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,110
brought justice because it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

732
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,210
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do but Raymond Chandler</font>

733
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,800
was different Raymond Chandler had

734
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,690
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> himself the ideal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the night</font>

735
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,790
the chivalrous idea of the night that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

736
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,950
contained within himself even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

737
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,500
corrupt Los Angeles in which he<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

738
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was the idea of the tough guy</font>

739
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,560
but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> all ideas become more</font>

740
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,820
themselves over time the tough guy

741
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,820
ultimately became a really violent

742
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,820
justice<font color="#E5E5E5"> Springer in the form of this is</font>

743
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,920
the stuff I like Mickey Spillane who

744
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,110
wrote the famous Mike Hammer novels

745
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,030
which were among the biggest best

746
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,290
sellers of their time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at one</font>

747
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">point he had seven novels on the</font>

748
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,210
bestseller list and his hero was Mike

749
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,820
Hammer and his first novel<font color="#E5E5E5"> was I the</font>

750
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,460
jury and it's a brilliant brilliant

751
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">tough-guy novel but extremely violent</font>

752
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike Hammer is not like a gentleman</font>

753
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,530
like Philip Marlowe he's not even a

754
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,590
thinking man like Sam Spade he is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

755
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,590
brute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he comes in and he questions a</font>

756
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,760
guy and if the guy doesn't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

757
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,620
answer he done answer he grabs him by

758
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,050
the crotch and he doesn't like send he

759
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,180
doesn't send you know people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prison</font>

760
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,040
he just blows them away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know this</font>

761
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,870
character we know him we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> him in</font>

762
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,180
death wish what you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman's love</font>

763
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,910
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Thelma and Louise and that</font>

764
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,590
violence you think about Thelma and

765
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,850
Louise if you ever go back and watch

766
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,340
that they kill a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapist in that movie</font>

767
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,710
who's already put his hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> up he's</font>

768
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,300
unarmed he's put his hands up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

769
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,430
blow him away and women cheer women

770
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,200
cheer well are they really cheering for

771
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,700
that with a cheer for that happened in

772
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,230
real life some of them would probably

773
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,630
but not but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them not a lot of</font>

774
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">them I think most civilized people would</font>

775
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,540
say now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy puts his hand up you</font>

776
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,950
gotta arrest him you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring him in</font>

777
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,930
so the violence becomes a metaphor and

778
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,190
what does it become a metaphor becomes a

779
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,930
metaphor for justice it becomes a

780
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,220
metaphor for morale

781
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,020
and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point above the Mike</font>

782
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,360
Hammer stories he has a lot of stories

783
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,640
where he acts as the judge jury and

784
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,200
executioner so the titles were things

785
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,650
like I the jury vengeance is mine my gun

786
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,539
is quick those were the titles of them

787
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,179
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about the fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no he was</font>

788
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,010
not going to live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world as if</font>

789
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,080
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> no moral order he was going to</font>

790
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,539
bring moral order to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world that he</font>

791
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:22,730
lived<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the postwar world that he lived</font>

792
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,470
in and now his post World War 2 by that

793
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,990
by that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Rand was a big fan of</font>

794
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,049
Mike Hammer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Mickey Spillane and in</font>

795
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:32,480
one of her cruelest acts I think she

796
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,850
published a comparison of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> paragraph of</font>

797
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,340
Mickey Spillane who was despised that

798
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,890
the left hated Mickey Spillane that the

799
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,140
Intelligencia they aided him and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

800
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,150
published a paragraph of his next to

801
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,669
their famous their favorite writer who

802
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:53,480
who had this very florid style and they

803
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,950
both were describing New York in the

804
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">rain and she just posted the two of them</font>

805
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,309
together and spelling was obviously the

806
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,870
better writer he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the</font>

807
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,640
better writer so I the jury take a look

808
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it it's a violent tough mean story</font>

809
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,340
but it uses violence as a metaphor and a

810
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,840
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people do that is a</font>

811
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,880
lot of argument in the newspapers in the

812
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,409
press about are we supporting

813
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:15,320
vigilantism no we're supporting morality

814
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,000
and in the violence in the story is a

815
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,860
metaphor and they have to read it that

816
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,539
way in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand what the guy</font>

817
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,309
is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if we don't</font>

818
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:24,470

up<font color="#E5E5E5"> always as what I call grandpa smukke</font>

820
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,220
