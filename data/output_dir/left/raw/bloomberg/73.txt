1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:09,080
when it debuted, the 4G wireless we have today allowed people for the first time  to hit the road

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
and explore unknown places with only a smartphone for directions.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,580
When 5G arrives, it could enable driverless
cars to take us there as well.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,280
5G stands for fifth-generation mobile networks
or wireless systems.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,890
It’s insanely fast and can accommodate a
lot more connected devices.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,910
But the reason it's being called revolutionary
is because 5G will allow connected devices

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,010
to speak to each other, as well as people.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,390
Ian King: Right now, we're living in a world
where, really, it's a one-way experience.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,340
That’s Bloomberg Tech Reporter Ian King

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,704
The network talks to your phone,
you look at your phone and access data, then

11
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:42,860
you send something back to the network.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,950
What we're being told about 5G is that, really,
for the first time, we're going to see machines

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,220
communicating with each other over mobile
networks in a meaningful way.

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,680
5G could end up being 100 times faster than
what we have now with speeds that could reach

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,690
10 gigabits per second.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,850
In plain English, that means downloading a
full-length HD movie in seconds.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,760
5G will also increase total bandwidth, which
we will need in order to accommodate the growing

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,990
“internet of things”.

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,280
We’re talking about internet-connected refrigerators,
thermostats, dog collars, but...5G will enable

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
so many more.

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,990
things like your utility network
factories, where machines just sat there,

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,640
not connected at all.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,420
Suddenly, they're all going to be connected…

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,840
Other things like cars, like utility poles,
like The light poles on the street, like traffic

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
lights.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,000
But perhaps the biggest advance will be a
huge reduction in communication lag time,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
known as latency.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,070
A network of driverless cars will need the
speed of 5G to ping each other multiple times

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,270
per second to avoid collisions.

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,440
Near-instantaneous data transfers could allow
doctors to perform surgery remotely with a

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,870
robotic scalpel.

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,310
So how will it work?

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,090
First, you need to improve "network density"

34
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,049
and that's just a fancy word for
saying you put more towers out there.

35
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,860
What we're being told is that's not actually
the case with 5G. // what we're talking about

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,860
here is a different way to send the information,
a broader spectrum of airwaves that we're

37
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
going to use.”

38
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,299
The idea is 5G will not only use the existing
mobile spectrum but also tap into higher frequencies,

39
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,060
called millimeter waves.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,258
Millimeter waves can carry more data, but
only travel short distances.

41
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,590
This may mean you’ll see a lot more of these
so called base stations around town.

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,499
And the new towers may have as many as 100
antennae ports, compared to about a dozen

43
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,650
on 4G cell towers.

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,650
When will we get 5G?

45
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,930
Providers in the U.S. are expected to spend
$275 billion over seven years to upgrade.

46
00:02:26,930 --> 00:00:00,000
Expect to see the first 5G service pop up
in big cities sometime in 2019.
