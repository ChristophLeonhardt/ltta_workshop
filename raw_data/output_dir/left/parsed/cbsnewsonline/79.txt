JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA WHERE 
AUTHORITIES ARE PROVIDING AN 
UPDATE FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S 
DEADLY SHOOTING AT A VIDEO GAME 
TOURNAMENT. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AGAIN 
THE MEDIA FOR STAYING ENGAGED 
WITH US AND ASSISTING IN 
PROVIDING THIS TIMELY 
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS INCIDENT 
YESTERDAY. 
AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY, JUST TO 
PROVIDE A QUICK RECAP, THERE 
WAS A MADDEN '19 TOURNAMENT AT 
CHICAGO PIZZA AND JACKSONVILLE 
LANDING. 
ABOUT 1:34 WE BEGAN TO RECEIVE 
911 CALLS STATING WE HAD PEOPLE 
SHOT INSIDE THE CHICAGO PIZZA. 
ROUGHLY TWO MINUTES LATER 
OFFICERS WERE ON THE SCENE 
INSIDE THE LANDING. 
SHORTLY THERE AFTER BUSINESSES 
WENT ON LOCK DOWN AND JFRD 
PERSONNEL ASSISTED WITH 
VICTIMS. 
JAKSONVILLE SHERIFFS OFFICE 
BOMB SQUAD AND SWAT TEAMS 
ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND 
CONDUCTED A A DETAILED SWEEP OF 
THE LANDING TO BE SURE IT WAS 
SAFE AND SECURE FROM OTHER 
THREATS. 
ONCE THAT WAS CLEARED OUR 
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS BEGAN. 
SO I WANT TO CLARIFY YESTERDAY, 
SOMETHING FROM YESTERDAY, OUR 
VICTIM COUNT NOW THAT WE HAVE 
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY 
THOSE TRANSPORTED BY RESCUE AND 
THOSE WHO SELF TRANSPORTED FOR 
THE MEDICAL TREATMENT. 
WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 13 VICTIMS 
OF WHICH 12 WERE SHOT. 
TWO VICTIMS WERE FOUND DECEASED 
AT THE SCENE. 
TEN WERE TREATED AT LOCAL 
HOSPITALS FOR GUN SHOT WOUNDS 
AND ONE WAS TREATED FOR NONGUN 
SHOT RELATED INJURY. 
THE SUSPECT ALSO SHOT AND 
KILLED HIMSELF AT THE SCENE AS 
WE MENTIONED AND HE IS NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE COUNT 
BECAUSE HE IS NOT A VICTIM. 
HE IS A SUSPECT IN THE CASE. 
AN OFFICIAL LIST OF THE VICTIMS 
FROM THE INCIDENT WILL BE 
RELEASED AFTER THE BRIEFING 
TODAY. 
WE ARE THANKFUL TO REPORT THAT 
ALL THE OTHER SHOOTING VICTIMS 
ARE EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM 
THEIR INJURIES. 
I WANT TO CREDIT THE GREAT WORK 
BY JFRD, PARAMEDICS, HOSPITAL 
STAFF FOR THE OUTSTANDING WORK 
IN TREATING THE VICTIMS. 
AS BAD AS THIS IS, IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. 
THE INVESTIGATION HAS CONTINUED 
AROUND THE CLOCK SINCE 
YESTERDAY. 
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE FROM 
INSIDE THE RESTAURANT CLEARLY 
SHOWS THIS IS A SINGLE SHOOTER 
INCIDENT AND THAT THE SUSPECT 
TOOK HIS OWN LIFE AFTER 
SHOOTING THE VICTIMS. 
THE SUSPECT CARRIED TWO HAND 
GUNS AND EXTRA AMMUNITION INTO 
THE ESTABLISHMENT WITH HIM. 
HOWEVER AT THIS POINT, WE 
BELIEVE HE ONLY FIRED ONE HAND 
GUN DURING THE INCIDENT. 
THE SUSPECT CLEARLY TARGETED 
OTHER GAMERS WHO WERE IN THE 
BACK ROOM OF A CHICAGO PIZZA 
PARTICIPATING IN THE GAME 
TOURNAMENT. 
THE SUSPECT WALKED PAST PATRONS 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUSINESS 
AND FOCUSED ATTENTION ON THE 
GAMERS. 
THIS IS A VERY INTENSE AND 
ACTIVE INVESTIGATION EVEN AT 
THIS POINT. 
THE MOTIVE IN THIS CASE STILL 
REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION. 
WE HAVE DETECTIVES IN BALTIMORE 
WORKING WITH FEDERAL PARTNERS 
AND LOOKING INTO THE BACKGROUND 
AGAIN OF THE SUSPECT. 
WE HAVE LOCATED AND SEARCHED 
THE SUSPECT'S VEHICLE AS WE 
MENTIONED YESTERDAY. 
NOW HIS HOTEL ROOM IN 
JACKSONVILLE. 
WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH 
THE DETAILS OF THE RESULTS OF 
THE SEARCHES. 
WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE OUR 
PROCESSING OF THE CRIME SCENE 
PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF 
BUSINESS TOMORROW BUT AGAIN WE 
CONTINUE TO ASK ANYONE WHO HAS 
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CASE 
OR WITNESSED ANYTHING AT THE 
LANDING YESTERDAY TO GIVE US A 
CALL AT 630-0500 SO WE CAN SET 
UP AN INTERVIEW FOR YOU WITH 
ONE OF THE INVESTIGATORS 
ASSIGNED TO THE CASE. 
ANY INFORMATION AT ALL, ANY 
CELL PHONE VIDEO, ANY PICTURES, 
ANYTHING PEOPLE OBTAINED 
YESTERDAY, WE ARE ASKING AGAIN 
THAT THEY SHARE THAT WITH US. 
630-0500. 
E-MAIL JSO CRIMETIPS OR WORK 
THROUGH CRIME STOPPERS AT 866-
845-TIPS. 
I CONTINUE TO BE THANKFUL FOR

VICTIMS. 
I WANT TO THANK SHERIFF AND MY

HAVE BEEN FULLY COOPERATIVE 
WITH THE FBI SO FAR. 
THEY HAVE PROVIDED ACCESS TO 
ALL THE RECORDS WE HAVE 
REQUESTED AND HAVE BEEN 
UNDERSTANDING IN THE NEED FOR 
INFORMATION TO ENSURE SAFETY OF 
OTHERS. 
THIS HAS BEEN VITAL TO 
ADVANCING OVER ALL

FBI WILL PROVIDE IN ON OTHER 
UPDATES O THE ALL WILL BE 
PROVIDED THROUGH JACKSONVILLE 
SHERIFFS OFFICE. 
THE FBI TEAMS IN JACKSONVILLE

MARYLAND, IN BALTIMORE. 
BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION AT 
THIS POINT HE LEGALLY PURCHASED 
THE FIREARMS FROM A LICENSED 
DEALER AND DIDN'T VIOLATE ANY 
LAWS DOING THAT. 
>> DID THE SHOOTER BACK OUT AND 
GET HIS GUNS OR DID HE HAVE

WE'LL BE ABLE TO DIG INTO THAT. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US IF ONE OF 
THE GUNS HAD A LASER SIGHT? 
>> ONE DID HAVE AN AFTER MARKET

ALONE AND SPECIFICALLY SOUGHT 
GAMERS WITH A 45 CALIBER HAND 
GUN AND 9-MILLIMETER HE HAD 
BOUGHT JUST THIS MONTH. 
THEY ALSO CONFIRMED WHAT WE 
THOUGHT WE SAW IN THE VIDEO, A 
LASER SIGHT ON ONE OF THE 
VICTIMS IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE

HE DID HAVE AN AFTER MARKET 
LASER SIGHT AUTHORITIES TELL US 
IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE.
