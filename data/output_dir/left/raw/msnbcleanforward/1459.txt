00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,371
DO WE NEED 4 MILLION PEOPLE TO HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE?

00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,806
HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCE? >> NO, AND A LOT OF THOSE ARE

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,675
>> NO, AND A LOT OF THOSE ARE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS.

12
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,109
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS. THAT’S A VERY FAIR CONVERSATION

13
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,311
THAT’S A VERY FAIR CONVERSATION ABOUT WHO HAS SECURITY

14
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:21,711
ABOUT WHO HAS SECURITY CLEARANCES.

EXPERIENCE WHO YOU WANT TO HAVE AVOIDING THE STOVE TYPE EFFECT

AVOIDING THE STOVE TYPE EFFECT WE SAW IN THE RUN-UP TO 9/11.

20
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,289
WE SAW IN THE RUN-UP TO 9/11. WHERE WE WEREN’T GETTING

21
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,190
WHERE WE WEREN’T GETTING DISSENTING VIEWS.

22
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,291
DISSENTING VIEWS. WHERE WE WEREN’T HAVING PEOPLE

23
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,826
WHERE WE WEREN’T HAVING PEOPLE SAY HEY, I DID THIS FOR A WHILE,

24
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,928
SAY HEY, I DID THIS FOR A WHILE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU’RE HEARING

25
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,228
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU’RE HEARING THAT?

26
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,964
THAT? >> IT’S HARDLY LIKE JOHN BRENNAN

27
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:41,898
>> IT’S HARDLY LIKE JOHN BRENNAN IS GOING TO GET CALLED OVER BY

00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:43,400
THE WHITE HOUSE TO DISCUSS NATIONAL SECURITY.

30
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,534
NATIONAL SECURITY. I MEAN, THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

31
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,969
I MEAN, THEY HATE EACH OTHER. >> NO, BUT WHAT HE DOES, HE

32
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,237
>> NO, BUT WHAT HE DOES, HE PROVIDES A CHECK ON THE PEOPLE

33
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,672
PROVIDES A CHECK ON THE PEOPLE DOING THAT JOB AND THOSE

00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,640
DOING THAT JOB AND THOSE PROFESSIONALS TALK TO EACH

00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,940
PROFESSIONALS TALK TO EACH OTHER.

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,409
OTHER. I GO AND TALK TO PEOPLE WHO DO

00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,643
I GO AND TALK TO PEOPLE WHO DO MY OLD JOB AT THE WHITE HOUSE

MY OLD JOB AT THE WHITE HOUSE ALL THE TIME AND WE COMPARE

00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:56,947
ALL THE TIME AND WE COMPARE NOTES AND WE DO IT WITHOUT PARTY

40
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:03,954
NOTES AND WE DO IT WITHOUT PARTY AFFILIATION.

41
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,656
AFFILIATION. WHERE YOU DON’T GO AFTER PEOPLE

42
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,160
WHERE YOU DON’T GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO HAVE RISK THREAD LIVE S INS

43
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:15,098
WHO HAVE RISK THREAD LIVE S INS SERVICE OF THIS COUNTRY.

44
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,668
SERVICE OF THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN WHAT IF BARACK OBAMA HAD

45
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:18,869
I MEAN WHAT IF BARACK OBAMA HAD EVOKED THE CLEARANCES OF

46
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,870
EVOKED THE CLEARANCES OF EVERYBODY WHO LED US INTO THE

47
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,504
EVERYBODY WHO LED US INTO THE IRAQ WAR.

48
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,972
IRAQ WAR. WOULD HAVE THAT BEEN A SMART

49
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,273
WOULD HAVE THAT BEEN A SMART THING OR A BAD THING?

50
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,010
THING OR A BAD THING? IN A WAY TO ENACT SOME

51
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,144
IN A WAY TO ENACT SOME RETRIBUTION ON PEOPLE.

52
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,779
RETRIBUTION ON PEOPLE. WHAT YOU WANT IS THOSE PEOPLE

53
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,447
WHAT YOU WANT IS THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE SAYING NO, HERE’S WHY

54
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,882
OUT THERE SAYING NO, HERE’S WHY WE DID IT.

55
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,352
WE DID IT. YOU MIGHT THINK IT WAS WRONG.

56
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,954
YOU MIGHT THINK IT WAS WRONG. THAT DEBATE IS HEALTHY.

57
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,689
THAT DEBATE IS HEALTHY. HE’S SQUELCHING IT AGAIN AND

58
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,356
HE’S SQUELCHING IT AGAIN AND IT’S WRONG.

59
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,658
IT’S WRONG. >> THE DEBATE IS HEALTHY AND

60
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,293
>> THE DEBATE IS HEALTHY AND THERE’S AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE

61
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,694
THERE’S AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE MAYBE WE NEED TO REVISIT WHO

62
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,262
MAYBE WE NEED TO REVISIT WHO GETS SECURITY CLEARANCE AND WHY.

63
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,363
GETS SECURITY CLEARANCE AND WHY. BUT THE WHITE HOUSE DIDN’T GIVE

64
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,465
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE DIDN’T GIVE ANY OF THOSE REASONS.

65
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:48,766
ANY OF THOSE REASONS. RIGHT?

66
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,702
RIGHT? THIS IS ABOUT A POLITICAL GRUDGE

67
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:53,304
THIS IS ABOUT A POLITICAL GRUDGE THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF UNDERMINES

68
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:54,739
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF UNDERMINES SARAH SANDERS.

69
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,574
SARAH SANDERS. IT’S REMINISCENT OF WHEN THE

70
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,075
IT’S REMINISCENT OF WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAT DOWN WITH LESTER

71
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:01,011
PRESIDENT SAT DOWN WITH LESTER HOLT AND SAID OH, HERE’S WHY I

72
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,880
HOLT AND SAID OH, HERE’S WHY I FIRED COMEY, UNDERMINING HIS

73
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,515
FIRED COMEY, UNDERMINING HIS WHOLE COMS TEAM.

74
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,950
WHOLE COMS TEAM. >> WHEN DONALD TRUMP DOES

75
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,618
>> WHEN DONALD TRUMP DOES SOMETHING THAT THERE IS A

76
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,686
SOMETHING THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE ARGUMENT FOR, THAT

77
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,621
REASONABLE ARGUMENT FOR, THAT WHEN A FORMER INTELLIGENCE

78
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,690
WHEN A FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL HAS CROSSED THE LINE

79
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,893
OFFICIAL HAS CROSSED THE LINE FROM GIVING ANALYSIS TO GIVEN

80
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:16,994
FROM GIVING ANALYSIS TO GIVEN COMMENTARY THAT THEY SHOULDN’T

81
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,329
COMMENTARY THAT THEY SHOULDN’T HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE

82
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,132
HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE ANYMORE, BUT HE’S TURNED INTO A

83
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,734
ANYMORE, BUT HE’S TURNED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT THAT IS

84
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,102
FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT THAT IS INFRINGING ON FREE SPEECH.

85
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:25,036
INFRINGING ON FREE SPEECH. THE WAY HE’S GONE ABOUT THIS IS

86
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,740
THE WAY HE’S GONE ABOUT THIS IS CLASSIC DONALD TRUMP.

87
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,975
CLASSIC DONALD TRUMP. HE’S DOING IT EXACTLY FOR THE

88
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,111
HE’S DOING IT EXACTLY FOR THE WRONG REASONS.

89
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,213
WRONG REASONS. >> HE’S GOING TO TAKE THE

90
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,248
>> HE’S GOING TO TAKE THE SECURITY CLEARANCE AWAY WHICH

91
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:41,319
SECURITY CLEARANCE AWAY WHICH OBVIOUSLY PLAYS TO THOSE GUY’S

92
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,254
OBVIOUSLY PLAYS TO THOSE GUY’S DEBATES.

93
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,656
DEBATES. THE PRESIDENT IS LYING TOO.

94
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,691
THE PRESIDENT IS LYING TOO. ELI, HOW PROBLEMATIC IS IT THAT

95
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:50,127
ELI, HOW PROBLEMATIC IS IT THAT THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY ADMITTED

96
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,162
THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY ADMITTED THAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

97
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,431
THAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WAS THE MOTIVATION?

98
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,366
WAS THE MOTIVATION? >> I DON’T KNOW HOW PROBLEMATIC

99
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,267
>> I DON’T KNOW HOW PROBLEMATIC IT IS POLITICALLY BECAUSE

100
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,836
IT IS POLITICALLY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO HARDENED IN

101
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,740
EVERYTHING IS SO HARDENED IN TERMS OF PARTISANSHIP AND HE’S

102
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,974
TERMS OF PARTISANSHIP AND HE’S BEEN TELLING PEOPLE COMEY AND

103
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,642
BEEN TELLING PEOPLE COMEY AND ALL ARE ALL TO GET HIM FOR A

104
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:05,843
ALL ARE ALL TO GET HIM FOR A LONG TIME.

105
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:07,178
LONG TIME. BRENNAN’S BEEN A VOCAL CRITIC

106
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,747
BRENNAN’S BEEN A VOCAL CRITIC WHICH IS WHY HIS CLEARANCE WAS

107
00:03:09,758 --> 00:03:10,081
WHICH IS WHY HIS CLEARANCE WAS REVOKED.

108
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,182
REVOKED. THE PRESIDENT, AS YOU POINTED

109
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,784
THE PRESIDENT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS IS A DISTRACTION.

110
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,486
OUT, THIS IS A DISTRACTION. HE WOULD HAVE SAID, I WOULD HAVE

111
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,154
HE WOULD HAVE SAID, I WOULD HAVE DONE IT LAST WEEK BUT I WAS TOO

112
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:16,554
DONE IT LAST WEEK BUT I WAS TOO BUSY.

113
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,689
BUSY. HE WAS AT BEDMINSTER GOLFING AND

114
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,592
HE WAS AT BEDMINSTER GOLFING AND HANGING OUT WITH BIKERS LAST

115
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:20,892
HANGING OUT WITH BIKERS LAST WEEK.

116
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,794
WEEK. IT’S A SHORT-TERM, KNEE-JERK

117
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:25,397
IT’S A SHORT-TERM, KNEE-JERK EFFORT TO CHANGE THE NEWS CYCLE.

118
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,566
EFFORT TO CHANGE THE NEWS CYCLE. I HATE TO -- I KNOW IT SOUNDS

119
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,100
I HATE TO -- I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF TIMES WE TALK WITH

120
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,801
LIKE A LOT OF TIMES WE TALK WITH THIS PRESIDENT.

121
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,771
THIS PRESIDENT. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT A CHILD.

122
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,205
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT A CHILD. BUT SO MUCH OF THESE BEHAVIORS

123
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:35,607
BUT SO MUCH OF THESE BEHAVIORS COMING OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE

124
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,109
COMING OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE ARE DRIVEN BY THE PRESIDENT’S

125
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,478
ARE DRIVEN BY THE PRESIDENT’S NEED TO SORT OF SELF-SOOTHE.

126
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:42,381
NEED TO SORT OF SELF-SOOTHE. PEOPLE AROUND HIM SELF-SOOTHING.

127
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:43,815
PEOPLE AROUND HIM SELF-SOOTHING. NDAs THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A

128
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,884
NDAs THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

129
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,886
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS REALLY

130
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:48,987
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS REALLY DON’T HAVE ANY TEETH.

131
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:53,692
DON’T HAVE ANY TEETH. THEY’RE JUST THE PRESIDENT.

132
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:54,826
THEY’RE JUST THE PRESIDENT. MANY OF THEM DON’T EVEN HAVE

133
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:55,527
MANY OF THEM DON’T EVEN HAVE THEM ANYMORE.

134
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:56,728
THEM ANYMORE. IT’S A MEASURE TO MAKE THE

135
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,263
IT’S A MEASURE TO MAKE THE PRESIDENT WHO CAN’T STOP THE

136
00:03:58,307 --> 00:03:59,231
PRESIDENT WHO CAN’T STOP THE MUELLER PROBE FEEL BETTER, TO

137
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,732
MUELLER PROBE FEEL BETTER, TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND TO SAY

138
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,235
CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND TO SAY LOOK, I DID SOMETHING, TAKE

139
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:03,535
LOOK, I DID SOMETHING, TAKE THAT.

140
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,537
THAT. AND IT’S NOT GOING TO CHANGE

141
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,572
AND IT’S NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHAT JOHN BRENNAN SAYS ABOUT HIM

142
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:08,040
WHAT JOHN BRENNAN SAYS ABOUT HIM ON TV.

143
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,675
ON TV. IF ANYTHING, IT’S GIVEN BRENNAN

144
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:11,410
IF ANYTHING, IT’S GIVEN BRENNAN AN EVEN LARGER PLATFORM.

145
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,145
AN EVEN LARGER PLATFORM. >> THE NOTION OF SELF-SOOTHING

146
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:14,346
>> THE NOTION OF SELF-SOOTHING PRETTY MUCH GROSSES ME OUT.

147
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:18,517
PRETTY MUCH GROSSES ME OUT. I WANT TO SHARE PART OF WHAT

148
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:19,151
I WANT TO SHARE PART OF WHAT "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

149
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:19,651
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" EDITORIAL QUOTE IS.

150
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:20,685
EDITORIAL QUOTE IS. THE MORE EFFECTIVE AND

151
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,053
THE MORE EFFECTIVE AND POLITICALLY HEALTHY WAY TO FIGHT

152
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,023
POLITICALLY HEALTHY WAY TO FIGHT BACK WOULD BE FOR MR. TRUMP TO

153
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,057
BACK WOULD BE FOR MR. TRUMP TO DECLASSIFY ALL THE DOCUMENTS

154
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,258
DECLASSIFY ALL THE DOCUMENTS UNDER SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS

155
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,460
UNDER SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION.

156
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,028
ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION. ABSENT THE FULL STORY THAT WOULD

00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,832
ABSENT THE FULL STORY THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE MISSING CONTEXT,

158
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,634
PROVIDE THE MISSING CONTEXT, REVOKING MR. BRENNAN’S SECURITY

159
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,336
REVOKING MR. BRENNAN’S SECURITY CLEARANCE LOOKS PETTY WITHOUT

160
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:38,671
CLEARANCE LOOKS PETTY WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING USEFUL.

161
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:42,308
ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING USEFUL. IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CLAIM

162
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:44,477
IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CLAIM THAT BRENNAN WAS ABUSING HIS

163
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,945
THAT BRENNAN WAS ABUSING HIS POWER, WHY NOT REVEAL THE

POWER, WHY NOT REVEAL THE DOCUMENTS THAT CAN PROVE IT?

165
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,218
DOCUMENTS THAT CAN PROVE IT? THE POINT IS WE HAVE A SPECIAL

166
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,786
THE POINT IS WE HAVE A SPECIAL COUNSEL WHO’S LOOKING AT THIS

167
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:55,187
COUNSEL WHO’S LOOKING AT THIS AND WE SHOULD LET HIM DO HIS

168

AN EFFORT TO REVEAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION,

ABOUT AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION, IS IN NO WAY THE CONCLUSION YOU

IS IN NO WAY THE CONCLUSION YOU SHOULD REACH, BECAUSE THIS GUY’S

177
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,868
SHOULD REACH, BECAUSE THIS GUY’S DOING SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE

178
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:09,702
DOING SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE AGAINST JOHN BRENNAN.

179
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:12,905
AGAINST JOHN BRENNAN. I MEAN, LOOK IT, I MEAN, MY GOD,

FROM NORTH KOREA TO PUTTING KIDS IN CAGES TO THE OMAROSA TAPES.

188
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,719
IN CAGES TO THE OMAROSA TAPES. I’M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN

189
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,120
I’M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE COULDN’T PROVE

190
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,689
THE WHITE HOUSE COULDN’T PROVE OR WOULDN’T TELL US THAT HE

191
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:31,024
OR WOULDN’T TELL US THAT HE DIDN’T USE THE "N" WORD ON TAPE.

192
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,792
DIDN’T USE THE "N" WORD ON TAPE. WHAT WAS THAT, TWO DAYS AGO?

193
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,027
WHAT WAS THAT, TWO DAYS AGO? AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

194
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,494
AND HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

195
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:40,833
SOMETHING ELSE. I JUST THINK IT IS TIME TO FOCUS

196
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:42,268
I JUST THINK IT IS TIME TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON,

197
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,636
ON WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON, WHICH IS YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT

198
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,605
WHICH IS YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT CASTING ABOUT IN A RECKLESS AND

199
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,140
CASTING ABOUT IN A RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE WAY AND ADULTS

200
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,775
IRRESPONSIBLE WAY AND ADULTS LIKE JOHN BRENNAN ARE DOING

201
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,511
LIKE JOHN BRENNAN ARE DOING SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL, SPEAKING

202
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:51,945
SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL, SPEAKING UP.

203
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,079

00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,347
WHEN THEIR WHOLE TRAINING HAS BEEN KEEP THEIR HEADS DOWN.

205
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,048
BEEN KEEP THEIR HEADS DOWN. BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT’S

206
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,283
BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT’S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY.

207
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,851
HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. >> TAKE ME INSIDE THE MIND OF

208
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,852
>> TAKE ME INSIDE THE MIND OF THE AMERICAN VOTER.

209
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:01,388
THE AMERICAN VOTER. YOU SPEAK TO THEM EVERY DAY.

210
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,056
YOU SPEAK TO THEM EVERY DAY. IF THE ECONOMY CHUGS ALONG AND

211
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,524
IF THE ECONOMY CHUGS ALONG AND JOBS ARE BETTER, WHY DON’T

212
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:07,260
JOBS ARE BETTER, WHY DON’T PEOPLE CARE ABOUT ALL OF THESE

213
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,827
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT ALL OF THESE DISASTROUS THINGS?

214
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:08,928
DISASTROUS THINGS? >> THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS

215
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,363
>> THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING WHICH IS PEOPLE ARE

216
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,298
SOMETHING WHICH IS PEOPLE ARE REALLY BUSY AND IT’S HARDER TO

PAY FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE AND GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND

219
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,136
GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND IT’S EASY TO SHRUG YOUR

00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:17,237
IT’S EASY TO SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS AND SAY I CAN’T PAY

221

SHOULDERS AND SAY I CAN’T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AND HE

CRAP. I DO THINK THOSE OF US IN THIS

I DO THINK THOSE OF US IN THIS BUSINESS HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED.

I’M NOT A LAWYER BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE GENERAL STANDARDS THAT

THERE ARE GENERAL STANDARDS THAT SHOULD BE UPHELD.
