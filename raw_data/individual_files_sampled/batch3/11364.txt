Italy has launched a website targeting fake news the move comes ahead of marches general election if someone wants to report a fake all they have to do is click on a special link online the surface will allow users to identify fake news online a team's been set up to analyze the authenticity of anything flagged up by using special software the Italian interior minister has been heaping praise on this new hi-tech system though some experts are slightly more skeptical it's an entirely transparent and legitimate public service tool aimed at protecting citizens from unfounded news there is not even the slightest intention to enter the political debate you cannot create a borough of people checking news because everything that we are talking about it's it's an opinion at the end you can check the origin of the news but you will never have a real independent Bureau to tell us what is true what is fake so I think we should try to fix the old media system - - - to have an independent media system and then we can talk about seconds or not
