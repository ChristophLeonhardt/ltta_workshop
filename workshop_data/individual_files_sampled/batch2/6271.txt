so there's a prankster going around Washington and he keeps emailing Republicans to get them to him admit embarrassing things and he did it again and it worked again this time he he emailed the guys at Breitbart so one of them was editor-in-chief Alex Marlowe and he sent an email to him he had a bunch of exchanges with him here let me read your beginning of it so he Mia emails Emma says reading online about how I'll be bringing forth my wrath on Ivanka and Jared he's pretending to be Steve Bennett and he says I'd been doing this great nation a service if I did okay so there's a decent chance you should have picked up on the fact that it's not actually your boss but okay whatever look these pranks are sometimes hard to pick up that's not the important thing the important thing is not to go haha to these guys but to find out what it is that they're actually thinking so he's gonna respond to him and and you're gonna get a better sense of it so Allen Marlow responds i spooked him today did five stories on globalist takeover positioning you as only hope to stop it see there we have confirmation in fact they are definitely going after Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and so they are targeting important parts of the Trump administration because sometimes they'll admit it and sometimes they'll be cute and be like oh no golly gee Steve Bannon and Breitbart would never do that I don't know where that leak came from well now we have a pretty good sense of it Marlo goes on to say you need to own that just have surrogates do the dirty work Boyle Rahimi Tony have been waiting for this in other words we want to own the story but don't put your finger prints on it so we can go out and pretend that it's not you he's not running the website you don't need to pretend anymore but this is Breitbart 101 don't worry let the surrogates do the dirty work and then we'll pretend it wasn't you the gig is up man everybody knows it's you alright so again the email prankster pretending to be Steve ban and sends a email about a story about how Ivanka Trump is gonna get pushed out of the White House or at least that Bannon wants to do that and he says oh this was a fun read referring to that Daily Mail article he goes on to say oh and then Marlow emails him back and says some apparently horrible gossip about Ivanka and Jared Trump CNN the rest did not print what that gossip was and rightfully so because it's unsubstantiated I'm no fan of Jared Kushner or Ivanka Trump I think that they're part of a terrible administration and I don't think they've helped very much in that terrible administration but you don't need unsubstantiated rumors about their personal lives for that but Marlowe says that and then the fake banner responds haha lovely stuff so do you think you'll have them packed and shipping out before Christmas Marlowe responds let me see what I can do hard to know giving your description of them as evil I don't know what motivates them if they are semi-normal then yes they're out by the end of the year so here are the other things that we learn apparently Bannon internally - Breitbart team has described Ivanka Trump that's the president's daughter and Jared Kushner as evil and they think that they're going to be able to push them out of the White House my guess is given that they're family they're probably mistaken and given that Kushner and Ivanka just pushed Bannon out of the White House not the other way around they're probably mistaken but now we could put to bed any idea that Breitbart is not looking to undermine the Trump administration I know what they claim they say no no we're trying to help Trump by getting rid of his advisers we don't agree with so that they'll wind up in a better place well by doing character assassinations and then political assassinations of his top advisers I'm not sure Trump would think that that was helping him let alone going after and trying to eliminate again all politically eliminate his daughter and his son-in-law I'm pretty positive Trump wouldn't view that as being helpful to and of course they had already said as soon as Bannon left the White House it's time for war and Joel Pollock who also had exchanges with the guy doing the prank had tweeted publicly before hashtag war and and in his exchanges with this guy said no one can figure out what Ivanka and Kushner want to do but it was also happy to try to help to push them out so now you know if you didn't before Breitbart when they say they're going to war does mean with huge portions of the Trump administration in ways that Trump will not agree with so we've got an internal civil war on the right wing and we know it today a little bit more thoroughly than we knew it yesterday so enjoy grab some popcorn and let him go to war on each other for the rest of us that's not such a bad thing TYT membership gets you commercial free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network comm slash join
