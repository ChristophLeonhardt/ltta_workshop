DONALD TRUMP ASKED FOR A LOT
OF MONEY AND HE GOT A LOT OF
MONEY.
THE US MILITARY BUDGET BACK A
DEFENSE POLICY BILL PUMPING
$700 BILLION 
INTO 
THE MILITARY.
HERE IS A BREAKDOWN.
SO THEY SHORTCHANGED HIM 28
BILLION.
BUT WHAT IS THAT WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE A PARADE YET.
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE NEXT YEAR'S
REQUEST.
WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THIS, THESE
BILLS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.
THEY ARE VERY CONTENTIOUS MOST
OF THE TIME.
AND I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE
OF THING THAT MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS DON'T LIKE VOTING
AGAINST BECAUSE IT CAN BE
USED AGAINST YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL.
THIS MONEY IS NECESSARY TO KEEP
THE MILITARY GOING.
WHAT IS NOT NECESSARY IS THE
SECOND PART OF THE NUMBER,
ALL THOSE MISSIONS.
IN THIS ARGUMENT THAT
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING IT ABOUT
HEALTHCARE, THEY ARE SAYING THAT
SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE IS THE
WRONG WAY FOR AMERICA TO GO.
THIS IS UNCHECKED SINGLE-PAYER
$700 BILLION EXPENDITURES.
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
WE CAN PAY FOR OUR MILITARY AND
DEFENSE IN A SINGLE-PAYER
KIND OF WAY.
WE CAN DO IT FOR HEALTHCARE.
IF THE RIGHT TO DEFEND YOUR
COUNTRY IS A RIGHT THAT WE
ARE ALL BORN WITH, SO IS THE
RIGHT TO REMAIN HEALTHY
THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE.
THERE BOTH TO KEEP US ALIVE.
BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF WASTE IN THE MILITARY
AND IT WAS SOMETHING TRUMP
CRITICIZING HE WAS CAMPAIGNING.
HE CLAIMED HE WAS GOING TO STOP
IT, BUT HE IS ONLY ADDING
TO THAT WASTE.
OF COURSE HE WANTS TO DO THAT
MILITARY PARADE WHICH WOULD
TAKE TAXPAYER MONEY.
THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF WASTE.
ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE IN
CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT
HIMSELF KEEP MAKING ARGUMENTS
AGAINST UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE TOPIC
OF SOCIAL SECURITY COMES UP.
HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T SPEND AN
ADDITIONAL $700 BILLION ON THE
MILITARY WHICH IS INCREDIBLY
WASTEFUL.
WHY DO I THINK IT'S WASTEFUL?
A
LOT OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT
MANY GOES TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
WHEN IN REALITY WE DON'T NEED TO
PAY THESE EXORBITANT FEES TO
THESE CONTRACTORS TO GET THINGS
DONE IN THE PENTAGON.
JUST LAST DECEMBER, THE
WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHED AN
INCREDIBLE PIECE REGARDING THE
PENTAGON AND HOW THEY TRIED TO
COVER UP A STUDY THAT SHOWED
$125 BILLION IN WASTE.
THIS STUDY, GO BACK AND READ IT.
THE STUDY IS DONE AND THE
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT COULD'VE
SAVED IT BY LOOKING AT THE
RESULTS AND DOING SOMETHING TO
CUT THE WASTE AND BUREAUCRACY.
THERE'S HONESTLY MONEY GOING TO
THINGS THAT WE DON'T NEED
IN THE MILITARY ANYMORE.
INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THE
PENTAGON REALIZED IF THIS
BECOMES PUBLIC THEN CONGRESS IS
MUCH LESS LIKELY TO INCREASE
FUNDING TO THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT.
LET'S JUST BURY IT AND PRETEND
LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST.
IN THAT SAME PIECE, TRUMP IS
QUOTED AS SAYING HE'S GOING TO
STOP IT.
HE IS SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
HE GETS TO OFFICE AND WHAT IS
THE CALL FOR?
ANYWAY IT IS JUST
FRUSTRATING.
WE PAY TAXES SO OUR GOVERNMENT
CAN TAKE CARE OF US.
WE GOT INTO THE DETAILS OF THE
IRAN DEAL YESTERDAY.
THAT IS 
ALL BEING DONE ON
PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY WANT
MORE MONEY FOR THESE PRIVATE
CONTRACTORS AND THAT IS IT.
WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL
SECURITY, OR YOUR HEALTH
INSURANCE OR COVERAGE.
WHO CARES ABOUT AFFORDABLE
HOUSING AND MAKING SURE THE
PEOPLE IN OUR LIVING ON THE
STREET.
WE HAVE TO FROM THE MILITARY
BECAUSE THESE PRIVATE
CONTRACTORS HAVE TO MAKE MONEY.
THAT IS WHERE TAXPAYER MONEY
GOES TO.
ADDITIONALLY I WOULD ADD IF
YOU ARE NOT ñ IF YOU ARE TAKING
700 BILLION FROM THE AMERICAN
TAXPAYERS FOR THE MILITARY ñ I
SHOULD SAY IF THERE IS
SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE,
THERE IS GOING TO BE WASTE.
THERE IS WASTE EVERYWHERE IN
GOVERNMENT.
BUT IT IS STILL BETTER.
BUT THE VA, THERE IS NO TALK
ABOUT THE VA HERE.
THIS IS A BLANKET BILL, IT IS
UNFETTERED AND UNTOUCHED BY
AMENDMENTS.
AMENDMENTS THEY COULD'VE TALKED
ABOUT NORTH KOREA.
THERE IS NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT
THE BAN ON TRANSGENDER IN
THE MILITARY.
THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IS
GOING TO GET THIS AND TALK
ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING
TO GO.
BUT THERE IS NO TALK ABOUT THE
VA.
THAT TO ME IS ONE THING THAT IS
BLARING.
THIS IS WHAT STICKS OUT TO ME
ñ NICK MULVANEY MONTHS AGO ñ
WHEN IT WENT DOWN TO THE MEALS
ON WHEELS IT WAS ONE OF THE
HEADLINES.
HE WAS READY TO CUT IT BECAUSE
NO ONE REALLY NEEDS THAT.
THERE WAS ONE LINE HE SAID WHERE
HE SAID I CAN'T FORCE A
CONSTRUCTION WORKER IN OHIO THAT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS
SINGLE MOTHERS ENTITLEMENTS OR
HER CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, I
CAN'T MAKE HIM PAY TAXES TO GO
TO HER.
BUT I CAN MAKE EVERYONE WHO IS
DISAGREEING WITH THESE WARS TO
BUILD MORE WAR MACHINES OR BUILD
MORE COMPANIES.
WHAT IF I RAISE MY HAND AND SAID
I DON'T WANT TO FUND YOUR WARS
ANYMORE?
I DON'T HAVE THAT SAY
ANYMORE.
BUT THAT OHIO WORKER HAS ALL THE
RIGHT TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, EFF
THE MOTHER IN KANSAS.
BY THE WAY
THIS IS A PERFECT ILLUSTRATION
WHERE WHILE THE GOVERNMENT TAKES
OUR TAXPAYER MONEY AND USES IT
TOWARD THIS TYPE OF WASTE, TO
MAKE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WEALTHY
THEY DISTRACT US BY ATTACKING
THAT MOTHER LIVING IN POVERTY.
THEY DISTRACT US BY TALKING
ABOUT THE "OTHERS."
AND THE WALL AND THE MEXICANS.
THEY DISTRACT US ñ
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A TOPIC OF
DISCUSSION AMONGST MOST
AMERICANS?
HELL NO.
BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF
THAT REALLY GOES ON THAT
AMERICANS SHOULD BE OUTRAGED
ABOUT.
