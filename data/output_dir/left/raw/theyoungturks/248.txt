135
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,530
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> countless times where his dad</font>

they clearly did tax fraud according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

141
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
this so that's illegal<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's said I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

in Manhattan

169
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,330
it turns out he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> been minimizing how</font>

170
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,860
much money his dad had made<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two</font>

171
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,660
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it turns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out his dad</font>

172
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,460
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a billion dollars didn't</font>

173
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,550
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 million</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a billion</font>

174
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

175
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,710
one he wanted to say I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the billionaire</font>

176
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm the one who became the billionaire</font>

177
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,330
not my dad<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you're such a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible guy</font>

178
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,789
man anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's had a dad who's been</font>

179
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,039
decent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them knows what a scumbag this</font>

180
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,740
Donald Trump guy is okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the second</font>

181
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,030
reason is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't want to</font>

182
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">say how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money he had because they</font>

183
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,479
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna evade taxes exactly so let's</font>

184
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,889
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I think the details</font>

185
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the findings here are important and</font>

186
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,570
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to be aware of as many of</font>

229
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,380
look I

230
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,020
that there is an ideological divide when

231
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,050
it comes to estate taxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I happen</font>

232
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,270
to fall on the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after a</font>

233
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,040
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of money that you get</font>

234
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,540
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parents after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they pass away</font>

235
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should pay taxes on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

236
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">being double taxed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's new</font>

237

income for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't earn that</font>

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
money it's money<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your parents</font>

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,530
earned but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's worse when it comes to</font>

240
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,440
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump's did because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trumps</font>

241
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,930
didn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> create their wealth out of</font>

242
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">thin air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like again Fred Trump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did work</font>

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,360
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he also received a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of money</font>

244
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,880
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> government subsidies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for affordable</font>

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,900
housing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taxpayers</font>

246
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,550
essentially helped him build<font color="#E5E5E5"> his wealth</font>

247
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he didn't want to pay the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taxpayers</font>

248
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">back after he passed so let me give you</font>

249
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,240
the details<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the late 1940s</font>

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fred Trump obtained roughly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty six</font>

251
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,290
million dollars in<font color="#CCCCCC"> federal loans to</font>

252
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,030
build two of his largest developments

253
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Beach Haven</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apartments near Coney Island</font>

254
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,070
Brooklyn<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Shore Haven apartments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

255
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,060
few miles<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

256
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,580
so again that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one case where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

257
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,440
received<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty six million dollars</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">government subsidies in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop</font>

259
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">these properties and by the way he</font>

260
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,470
profited from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

261
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">conservative and you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh man I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

262
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,470
want the government to leave me alone

263
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,700
