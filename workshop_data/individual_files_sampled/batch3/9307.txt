BEST HAVE ATTESTED, HE HAS BEEN AN EXEMPLARY PUBLIC SERVANT, JUDGE, TEACHER, COACH, HUSBAND, AND FATHER. MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH. Laura: THAT WAS SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS DELIVERING A CRUSHING BLOW TO DEMOCRATS HOPING FOR A LAST-MINUTE DEFECTION. DURING HER NEARLY ONE HOUR LONG SPEECH, SHE ECHOED MANY OF THE SENTIMENTS OFFERED ON THE SENATE FLOOR DAY AFTER DAY BY OUR NEXT SENTIMENTS OFFERED ON THE SENATE FLOOR DAY AFTER DAY BY OUR NEXT GUEST. WE’RE HAPPY TO BE TO BE JOINED EXCLUSIVELY BY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL. WHEN DID YOU KNOW YOU HAD THE VOTES? WHEN THE ROLL WAS CALLED. Laura: REALLY? YEAH, THEY WERE ALL VERY GUARDED ABOUT MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE SITUATIONS, WHEN YOU GO INTO A VOTE, NOT REALLY KNOWING FOR SURE. THAT YOU HAD THEM. Laura: YOU USUALLY CALL CLOE TOUR, YOU CLOTURE UNLESS YOU Laura: YOU USUALLY CALL CLOE TOUR, YOU CLOTURE UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE VOTES. WE HAD TO MOVE ON THIS, THIS WAS NOT GOING TO GET BETTER. I DECIDED A WEEK AGO WE WERE GOING TO VOTE ON FRIDAY. WE WATCHED WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THEY WERE TRYING TO DESTROY THIS GOOD MAN WITH RUMORS AND THE REST OF THE STUFF. WE NEED TO HAVE THE VOTE IN ORDER TO BRING TO IT A CONCLUSION. Laura: WHY DIDN’T SENATOR MURKOWSKI GO ALONG? YOU HAVE FLIEK AND COLLINS WITH THE LONG SPEECH TODAY, AND FLAKE, SHE IMPRESSED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH HER PASSION AND DEDICATION, ADVISE AND CONSENT. WHAT HAPPENED TO MURKOWSKI? I’D RATHER CELEBRATE THE VICTORY. AND I THINK THERE’S PLENTY OF CREDIT TO GO AROUND. PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR MAKING GREAT CHOICES. CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY FOR DOING A HECK OF A GOOD JOB DEALING WITH THE OUTBURSTS IN THE COMMITTEE, HECK OF A GOOD JOB DEALING WITH THE OUTBURSTS IN THE COMMITTEE, OF THE MEMBERS, DEALING WITH OF THE MEMBERS, DEALING WITH I MEAN WE’VE BEEN UNDER ASSAULT, I MEAN WE’VE BEEN UNDER ASSAULT, LAURA. OUR HOMES HAVE BEEN THEY’VE COME TO OUR HOMES. Laura: YOURS WAS TODAY. NOT JUST ME, IT’S EVERYBODY. WE’VE SORT OF BEEN UNDER ASSAULT. EVERYBODY DECIDED TO STAND UP TO THE MOB. THESE PEOPLE. THEY’RE NOT BEING INTIMIDATED BY I COULDN’T BE PROUDER OF MY MEMBERS FOR REFUSING TO ROLL OVER UNDER ALL OF THIS INTENSE PRESSURE, ALL OF THESE LIES. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA. Laura: THE SENATE IS UNDER SIEGE, PROTESTERS AREN’T LETTING UP, EVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING TONIGHT. IS THIS THE NEW NORMAL? I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING, THIS IS SENATOR MANCHIN, AFTER THE COLLINS SPEECH TODAY. AND AFTER HE SAID HE WOULD VOTE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. LET’S WATCH. LOOK AT US! LOOK AT US! SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME, SHAME! Laura: A LOT OF MY RADIO CALLERS TODAY, SAID IS THIS THE WAY IT’S GOING TO BE? IS THERE GOING TO BE ANY CHANGES TO BUILDING ACCESS? YOU DON’T WANT TO BECOMECA KOON BUT ANYING COCOON BUT ANY CHANGES HOW YOU LET PEOPLE INTO THE BUILDING? I THINK SECURITY WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. THE MOB WAS NOT ABLE TO INTIM DATE THE SENATE. WE STOOD UP TO THE MOB, WE DID THE RIGHT THING FOR A GOOD MAN, FILL A LIFETIME POSITION ON THE THE RIGHT THING FOR A GOOD MAN, FILL A LIFETIME POSITION ON THE SUPREME COURT. LOT TO CELEBRATE. I COULDN’T OF PROUDER OF ALL OF MY MEMBERS. SENATOR COLLINS, YOU HAD PART OF HER SPEECH IN THE ENTRY. Laura: THE DEMOCRATS RAISED ALMOST $2 MILLION ON A GO FUND ME PAGE FOR AN UNDETERMINED CANDIDATE AND SUSAN COLLINS IS APPARENTLY SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINING SUSAN RICE ENTERTAINING A CHALLENGE AGAINST SENATOR COLLINS IN 2020. SENATOR COLLINS WILL BE WELL FUNDED, I CAN ASSURE YOU. THERE’S A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM ON OUR SIDE, TOO. YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED, RISING ENTHUSIASM AMONG REPUBLICAN VOTERS. I THINK OUR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE JUST AS FIRED-UP AS THEIRS. EVERYBODY IS GOING TO REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID TO BRETT KAVANAUGH. Laura: IS THIS THE SHOT IN THE ARM THAT THE REPUBLICANS NEEDED? ABSOLUTE I, ABSOLUTELY. IT IS, IT’S WAKEUP CALL TO WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO HOLD THE SENATE. THE SENATE IS IN THE PERSONNEL BUSINESS. I LOVE THE HOUSE BUT THE SENATE IS IN THE PERSONNEL BUSINESS. YOU WANT JUDGES CONFIRMED, CABINET MEMBERS CONFIRMED, BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS CONFIRMED, WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE SENATE. SO THE PRESIDENT’S NOMINATIONS CAN ACTUALLY BE CONFIRMED AND TAKE THE JOBS. Laura: DO YOU INTEND TO USE THIS ISSUE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS AND WHAT THIS ISSUE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? ABSOLUTELY. I’M GOING TO REMIND EVERYBODY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SENATE, TWO SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS, 26 CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES, RECORD TWO SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS, 26 CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES, RECORD FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS. THESE ARE LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS WITH CONSERVATIVE MEN AND WOMEN THESE ARE LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS WITH CONSERVATIVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THE JOB OF JUDGE IS WHO BELIEVE THE JOB OF JUDGE IS TO INTERPRET THE LAW. AS IT’S WRITTEN. Laura: WHAT ABOUT REPERCUSSIONS FOR WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS PROCESS? I WAS HERE FOR JUDGE BOURQUE. I WAS YOUNG SPEECH WRITER IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. I WAS HERE FOR JUSTICE THOMAS. BUT I THINK THIS RIVALLED BOTH OF THOSE. I DO, TOO. Laura: LINDSAY GRAHAM WAS ON LAST NIGHT AND TALKED ABOUT THE Laura: LINDSAY GRAHAM WAS ON LAST NIGHT AND TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR REPERCUSSIONS AGAINST THE WRONG DOERS, LET’S WATCH. I BELIEVE DIANNE FEINSTEIN DIDN’T LEAK IT BUT I DON’T KNOW ABOUT HER STAFF. HER STAFF RECOMMENDED TO MS. KATZ, ACTIVIST LEFTIST LAWYER, RECOMMENDED TO FORD. Laura: WHY NOT SECURE THE E-MAILS AND TEXTS WE’RE GOING AFTER THEM. HERE’S WHAT I’M GOING TO DO. ANYBODY WHO DID THIS, IS GOING TO PAY A PRICE. Laura: WILL THEY PAY A PRICE I THINK IT WILL BE VET INVESTIGATED. BUT INVESTIGATED. BUT IT DIDN’T WORK. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE, THESE TACTICS DIDN’T WORK. Laura: PEOPLE NEED TO PAY, YOU DON’T WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. WE’RE PREPARED TO GO THROUGH IT AGAIN, THEY AREN’T GOING TO INTIMIDATE US AND TELL US HOW TO VOTE. THEY HELPED US WIN THIS VOTE. THEIR TACTICS ACTUALLY HELPED US UNIFY OUR PEOPLE AND WIN THIS VOTE. THEY’RE GOING TO HELP US WIN A MONTH FROM NOW ON NOVEMBER 6, TOO. Laura: DO YOU THINK YOU’LL PICK UP SENATE SEATS? I HOPE SO. THIS UNDERSCORES HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. WE HAVE A CLOSE MARGIN. VERY CLOSE MARGIN. I’D LIKE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA REPUBLICAN SENATORS. Laura: LET’S TALK ABOUT THE MEDIA’S ROLE IN ALL OF THIS, AMPLIFYING CHARGES. WE HAD ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO PLAY FROM SUSAN COLLINS WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE RAPE ROOMS AND PLAY FROM SUSAN COLLINS WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE RAPE ROOMS AND THESE WORDS THAT WERE BEING THROWN AROUND AGAINST THIS ESTEEMED JUDGE. LET’S WATCH. THE ALLEGATIONS THAT WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER JUDGE KAVANAUGH DRUGGED MULTIPLE GIRLS AND USED THEIR WEAKENED STATE TO FACILITATE GANG RAPE. THIS OUTLANDISH ALLEGATION, WAS PUT FORTH WITHOUT ANY CREDIBLE SUPPORTING EVIDENCE AND SIMPLY PARROTED PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF OTHERS. Laura: INCLUDING THE MEDIA, CELEBRITY PORN LAWYER. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN THAT SORT OF THING WAS NOT PUT ON THE AIR. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN THAT SORT OF THING WAS NOT PUT ON THE AIR. PEOPLE DIDN’T JUST PEDDLE NONSENSE WITH NO CORROBORATION. THAT EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM. A LOT OF SENATE DEMOCRATS WOULD MAINSTREAM THAT STUFF RIGHT INTO A LOT OF SENATE DEMOCRATS WOULD MAINSTREAM THAT STUFF RIGHT INTO THEIR DISCUSSIONS. AND TRY TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT IT SOMEHOW HAPPENED. NO CORROBORATION AT ALL. JUST RUMORS. ALL OVER THE PLACE. Laura: SENATOR MURKLEY FROM OREGON WAS UPSET, AND SAID THIS. CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE CHAIR OF OREGON WAS UPSET, AND SAID THIS. CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE, AND MITCH McCONNELL, THE MAJORITY LEADER. THEY SAID THERE’S NO CONTEMPORANEOUS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE WOMEN WHO CAME FORWARD. THAT IS NOT TRUE. Laura: WELL, WHAT ARE WE MISSING HERE, SENATOR? I DON’T KNOW WHAT HE’S TALKING ABOUT. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE ANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. MAYBE HE’S ON A DIFFERENT PLANET, NOT SURE. Laura: RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THIS LAST, YOU KNOW, COUPLE OF WEEKS AND YOU HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE RUN OF CONFIRMING CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES, DISTRICT JUDGES. BUT THIS EXPERIENCE, LESSONS LEARNED FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE SENATE, MAYBE THE PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD. WELL, WE HAVE REAFFIRMED IN THIS COUNTRY YOU’RE PRESUMED INNOCENT, THE PRESUMPTION IS IN FAVOR OF INNOCENCE. WE ALSO RELEARNED THAT YOU CAN’T YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW MOBS TO INTIM DATE YOU. AND I THINK A GOOD LESSON FOR US EXCITED ABOUT THE NOVEMBER US, UNIFIED THE CONFERENCE, MADE ELECTION, WAS GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE STOOD UP TO AND THEY DIDN’T GET AWAY WITH IT. THEY DID NOT WIN. THAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. Laura: HOW RADICAL HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF TODAY BECOME? PRETTY WILD BUNCH. PRETTY CLEAR THEY WERE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING, SAY ANYTHING, TO TRY AND WIN. NO BOUNDARIES. Laura: YOU STILL HAVE CLOSE FRIENDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AFTER THIS OR EMOTIONS RAW? I THINK WE’LL GET PAST IT IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS. BUT IT WAS A TOUGH PERIOD. A TOUGH PERIOD. I HOPE THEY LEARNED A LESSON. THAT YOU CAN DO THIS KIND OF THING BUT IT DOESN’T NECESSARILY
