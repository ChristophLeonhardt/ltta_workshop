welcome to Kaliningrad the Russian and
clave squeezed in between Lithuania
Poland and the Baltic Sea I'm in a
stadium based and built on the Allianz
Arena in Munich
it was 635 thousand screaming fans for
the four games that are being played
here and one of them is of course a
much-anticipated match between England
and Belgium for what else is going on
around this place
well I'm Peter Schmeichel and I'm here
to find out
I'm about to meet one of the FIFA
ambassadors for Kaliningrad she is a
five-time Olympic gold medalist and a 19
time world champion in synchronized
swimming
her name is Natalia ischenko and she has
asked me to meet him in a very unique
place so you asked me to meet you here
tell me about this place
this is caronian fleet the unique place
in Kaliningrad and the in whole of the
world here we have some dunes I remember
me a World Cup in Rio de Janeiro and we
have here along the beaches like a
Copacabana but this is also one of
UNESCO World Heritage Sites
yes it's very special and in Kaliningrad
we have one in Russia Beach that have a
blue flag ionesco
do you know where I'm from yeah I'm from
over there we can swim yeah you probably
could just obviously that's part of your
training swimming and you can hold your
breath for three and a half minutes
underwater yeah yeah
yes you can
it's a so cold weather now
Peter I prepared for you the unique
experience and we can we can try to
horse ride a unique experience is also a
unique challenge
I just realized and I have never done
that before for more than a minute maybe
there's always the first and this fella
here is Dima and we are the best of
friends are we
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing
you know this is the longest I've ever
been on a horse
you are very very right this is the only
way to see it
that's Kaliningrad famous Cathedral and
it's beautiful and normally articularly
time to show you everything but if you
get here you can do that for yourself
because actress part of this guy over
here he's flowing glass in the street
and I decided for this city I'm gonna do
stuff that I've never done before
okay I got a little bit of an idea
I think I'll challenge myself to
something a little bit more difficult
that's the best I could do
but when jewelleries making this
principle and one of the things he's
made is that and Kalinin god
there's a shipping city
and that's what I'm gonna do next
as you might well know Russia is a
massive country in terms of land 11 time
zones from east to west it's just
unbelievable
Kaliningrad is right on the Baltic Sea
and I'm taking advantage of being here
so today I've decided to go fishing I
absolutely love fishing and I'm here in
the Baltic Sea
I've got Kaliningrad in the back and
we're aiming straight for Denmark it's
gonna take us two or three days to get
there so we're probably not doing that
but what we are doing and we are trying
to catch my lunch and hopefully because
I'm starving it's going to be a salmon
this size
it's not very big
but that's oh it's like sometimes with a
thing you know
oh come on
Hey look at that that's about the right
size
that's for lunch
now
you
