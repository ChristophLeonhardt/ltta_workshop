00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:08,572
>> WELCOME.

2
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:09,773
IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION

3
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:11,441
TO THE NEWS RECENTLY, MANY OF

4
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:12,742
THE BIG STORIES REVOLVE AROUND

5
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:13,977
QUESTIONS OF RACE.

6
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:14,811
INCREASINGLY IN THIS COUNTRY

7
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,980
RACE IS THE HEADLINE.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,717
JUST THIS WEEK ROSEANNE BARR AND

9
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:22,886
HER SHOW CANCELED ON ABC AFTER

10
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:25,689
TWEETING AN ATTACK ON VALERIE

11
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,390
JARRETT THAT MANY DESCRIBED AS

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:27,724
RACIST.

13
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:29,326
STARBUCKS, THE COFFEE RETAILER,

14
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:32,429
CLOSED MORE THAN 8,000 RETAIL

15
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,464
STORES IN ORDER TO EDUCATE WHITE

16
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:37,534
EMPLOYEES ABOUT THEIR

17
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:38,268
UNCONSCIOUS RACISM.

18
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:41,771
MEANWHILE A BAR IN PORTLAND,

19
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,773
HOSTED A REPARATION HOUR, WHERE

20
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:56,353
NONWHITE PATRONS BANK FOR FREE.

21
00:00:59,155 --> 00:00:59,289
NONWHITE PATRONS BANK FOR FREE.

22
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:08,632
>> THE GENTRIFIERS OF TODAY ARE

23
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:09,566
SAYING, OH, THERE'S SO MANY

24
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,935
OLIVE GARDENS I CAN GO TO, SO I

25
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,336
NEED TO GO BACK TO THE CITY, GET

26
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:15,238
MY LIFE IN THE CITY, BUT I NEED

27
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:18,308
MY HOT YOGA STUDIO, MY POTTERY

28
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:19,576
STUDIO, MY STUFF REPRESENTED.

29
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:21,411
IF YOU INTRUDE ON THAT, I WILL

30
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:22,379
THEN CALL THE POLICE.

31
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:29,219
>> MORE AND MORE IT FEELS LIKE

32
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,054
RACIAL DIVISION IS THE SUBTEXT

33
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,555
OF VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IN THIS

34
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:36,293
COUNTRY, EVEN TOPICS THAT SEEM

35
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:37,761
UNRELATED TO ETHNICITY SUDDENLY

36
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:38,795
ARE RACIALLY FRAUGHT.

37
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:40,397
THE EFFECT IS A DEEPLY ANGRY AND

38
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:42,098
DIVIDED NATION, BUT ALSO YOU MAY

39
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:44,334
HAVE NOTICED A TERRIFIED ONE.

40
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:47,103
MANY AMERICANS ARE SCARED TO SAY

41
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,271
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

42
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:50,640
ONE FALSE WORD AND YOU COULD BE

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,575
DENOUNCED ON TWITTER AND LOSE

44
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:53,209
YOUR LIVELIHOOD.

45
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:53,910
IT HAPPENS.

46
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,614
WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME.

47
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,649
BEST IS TO SMILE AND NOD AND

48
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,051
HOPE THE WITCH-HUNT PASSES.

49
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,753
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO LIVE THIS

50
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:04,154
WAY?

51
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:05,355
HOW DID WE GET HERE IN THE FIRST

52
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:05,655
PLACE?

53
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:08,758
JOINING US A LAWYER WHO SERVES

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,961
ON THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL

55
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:13,029
RIGHTS, WRITTEN A NEW THRILLER,

56
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,597
CALLED "SECOND STRIKE," WHICH I

57
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:16,666
CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND IS

58
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,067
EXCELLENT.

59
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,969
PETER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

60
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,036
>> THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE

61
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:20,670
GOING ON.

62
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,908
EVEN AS THE COUNTRY BECOMES MUCH

63
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,476
MORE DIVERSE, SOMETHING WE WERE

64
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:28,078
PROMISED WOULD MAKE THE COUNTRY

65
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,746
MORE HARMONIOUS, THE COUNTRY

66
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:30,747
SEEMS MORE ON EDGE ABOUT

67
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,148
QUESTIONS OF RACE.

68
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:35,285
WHAT'S GOING ON?

69
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,754
>> SEVERAL THINGS ARE GOING ON,

70
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,155
BUT THE OVERRIDING THING IS A

71
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:42,092
POLITICAL NARRATIVE TO ENHANCE

72
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:43,693
AN ARGUMENT OR ONE PARTICULAR

73
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:47,597
SIDE, AND HAS ITS GENESIS IN TWO

74
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,098
THINGS.

75
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:51,668
FIRST IS THE POLITICAL

76
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,336
ELECTED CHIEFLY, AND SO WE HAVE

77
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:55,238
A LOT OF THIS DIVISION ON THE

78
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:58,308
BASIS OF RACE BECAUSE THERE ARE

79
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,109
NO POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS ANYMORE.

80
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,877
IF YOU LISTEN VERY CLOSELY, YOU

81
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:04,381
DON'T HEAR ANY WORKABLE POLICY

82
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,715
PRESCRIPTIONS, OR VERY FEW

83
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:06,716
WORKABLE POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS,

84
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:10,053
BUT WHAT YOU HEAR A LOT OF IT IS

85
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:11,154
IDENTITY POLITICS.

86
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:14,391
IN 17 YEARS, WE HAVEN'T HAD MORE

87
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,292
LUCID CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE

88
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,727
OR IDENTITY.

89
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,196
THEY'VE GOTTEN INCREASINGLY

90
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:24,267
SOPHOMORIC, OPAQUE, DRIVEN BY AN

91
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,136
AHISTORICAL NARRATIVE THAT HAS

92
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:27,003
LITTLE BEARING THAT TRULY

93
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:27,937
HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

94
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:28,405
AMERICA.

95
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:31,041
LOOK, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

96
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,076
THAT IN MY LIFETIME MATTERS OF

97
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:35,445
RACE AND DISCRIMINATION HAS

98
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,447
GOTTEN DEMONSTRABLY BETTER, IN

99
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:38,748
WAYS THAT WE COULD NEVER HAVE

100
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:39,115
IMAGINED.

101
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,884
IF YOU LOOK AT THE INTERACTION

102
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,385
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS

103
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:44,687
RACES TODAY THEY'VE NEVER BEEN

104
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:45,021
BETTER.

105
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:45,855
INDIVIDUALS OF RACES.

106
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,390
WHEN YOU COME TO THE INTERACTION

107
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,225
BETWEEN GROUPS, IT'S BECOME

108
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,161
HOSTILE AND TOXIC, AND IT'S A

109
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,229
FUNCTION OF TRYING TO GET

110
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:54,931
CERTAIN GROUPS TO HAVE AN

111
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:56,099
ALLEGIANCE TO A CERTAIN MOVEMENT

112
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,600
OR CERTAIN PARTY FOR POLITICAL

113
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,868
IMPERATIVE.

114
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:01,104
>> MAY I STEP IN THERE AND BACK

115
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,505
UP FOR A SECOND TO ADDRESS

116
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:03,940
SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID THAT I

117
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,674
NEVER THOUGHT OF.

118
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:06,709
THE CONVERSATION IS INCREASINGLY

119
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,178
GENERAL AND LESS SPECIFIC.

120
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:09,746
SO WHEREAS 30 YEARS AGO PEOPLE

121
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:12,382
MIGHT SAY, IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE

122
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,584
ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN STANDARD ICED

123
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,219
TESTING, WE NEED TO PUT MORE

124
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:17,320
MONEY INTO HEAD START, FOR

125
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,654
EXAMPLE.

126
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:19,889
NOW THE CONVERSATION IS THIS

127
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,159
GROUP IS BAD, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN

128
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,395
BAD, IT WILL NEVER GET BETTER.

129
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:26,262
WHY ARE WE HEARING FEWER

130
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:27,831
SOLUTIONS THAN WE USED TO HEAR?

131
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:29,899
>> WELL, I THINK FOR A COUPLE OF

132
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:30,233
REASONS.

133
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,569
ONE AGAIN IS THAT POLITICAL

134
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,070
IMPERATIVE, BECAUSE SOLUTIONS GO

135
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,505
AGAINST HAVING A POLITICAL

136
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:35,872
ADVANTAGE.

137
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:37,607
I THINK IT'S ALSO BECAUSE

138
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:41,277
THERE'S A TENDENCY ON THE PART

139
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:44,380
OF SOME TO SHUT DOWN OTHERS, TO

140
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,683
CAST OTHERS AS THE OTHER.

141
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:48,885
AGAIN, THAT'S FOR POLITICAL

142
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:49,285
IMPERATIVE.

143
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:49,652
>> RIGHT.

144
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:51,221
>> BUT YOU'RE AFRAID TO SAY

145
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,922
THINGS THAT ARE DEMONSTRABLY

146
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:53,223
TRUE.

147
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:54,624
TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE, A

148
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:56,326
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE HAD A

149
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,527
HEARING AT THE U.S. COMMISSION

150
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:02,999
ON CIVIL RIGHTS, ALL-DAY

151
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:03,833
HEARING, EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD

152
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,168
WAS THERE, THE USUAL GROUPS WERE

153
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:05,468
THERE.

154
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:08,238
IT WAS A HEARING ON HATE CRIMES

155
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:09,506
BECAUSE OF THE SPIKE IN HATE

156
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:10,740
CRIMES SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN

157
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,107
ELECTED.

158
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,642
BUT FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS.

159
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:14,043
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

160
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:15,378
DATA, AND WHEN I ASKED QUESTIONS

161
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:17,580
OF THIS, AFTER EVERYONE MADE

162
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,415
THESE GRAND PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT

163
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:20,984
HOW HORRIBLE AND HORRIFIC THE

164
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:23,019
SPIKE IN HATE CRIMES IS, WE HAD

165
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,021
NO HARD EVIDENCE OF SUCH SPIKE.

166
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,956
THE BEST DATA ON THIS COMES FROM

167
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:29,459
THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE

168
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:29,859
STATISTICS.

169
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,161
WHAT IT'S SHOWN FOR THE LAST 30

170
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:33,730
YEARS, THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE IN

171
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,631
HATE CRIMES.

172
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:36,199
THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE IN ALL

173
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,267
MANNER OF DISCRIMINATION FOR

174
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,902
MORE THAN 30 YEARS.

175
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:41,171
YET WE HAVE GREATER SENSITIVITY,

176
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,505
HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY, AND YOU

177
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,140
HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THIS, WHY

178
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,441
THIS IS THE CASE.

179
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:48,545
I THINK TO SOME EXTENT IT'S

180
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:51,347
BECAUSE IT HELPS THE AGENDA OF

181
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,682
CERTAIN GROUPS OF CERTAIN

182
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:54,817
PARTIES, CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.

183
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,586
>> SO YOU KEEP HEARING THAT WE

184
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:57,820
NEED TO HAVE AN HONEST

185
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,055
CONVERSATION ON RACE.

186
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:00,456
I'M ALWAYS FOR CONVERSATIONS,

187
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:03,560
PARTICULARLY FOR HONEST ONES.

188
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,595
I WONDER AFTER ALL THESE

189
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:06,763
CONVERSATIONS IF THE COUNTRY IS

190
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:08,264
BECOMING MORE DIVIDED.

191
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:09,265
MAYBE THAT'S EVIDENCE IT'S NOT

192
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:09,699
WORKING.

193
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,367
DO WE NEED TO TALK LESS ABOUT

194
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,936
RACE OR MORE ABOUT RACE?

195
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:13,903
DOES THE CONVERSATION IDEA HOLD

196
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:14,671
UP TO SCRUTINY?

197
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,139
>> TWO THINGS.

198
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,974
TUCKER, I DISAGREE WE'RE HAVING

199
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:18,408
CONVERSATIONS.

200
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:21,644
WE ALWAYS HEAR WE NEED TO HAVE A

201
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:23,213
CONVERSATION, BUT WHAT WE GET IS

202
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,281
ALWAYS HARANGUES, COMING FROM

203
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,017
ONE SIDE, AND MOST DECENT PEOPLE

204
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,419
DUCK THEIR HEADS AND WATCH FOR

205
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:30,186
INCOMING FIRE.

206
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:32,121
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT IN

207
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:32,488
CROSSFIRE.

208
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,157
YOU KNOW IF YOU GO TO COLLEGES,

209
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,992
LAW SCHOOLS, ALMOST ANY

210
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:37,293
INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING,

211
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:42,465
FRANKLY K-12, THERE ARE ONLY

212
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:43,233
CERTAIN ACCEPTABLE OPINIONS THEY

213
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,168
CAN HAVE, AND STUDENTS ARE

214
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,402
PUNISHED FOR THIS, AND THEY KNOW

215
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:49,339
HOW TO REACT IN THE CONTEXT OF A

216
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,274
CLASSROOM DEBATE OSTENSIBLY ON

217
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:51,574
RACE.

218
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:52,375
THERE'S ONLY ONE ACCEPTABLE

219
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,477
OPINION, AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

220
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:55,545
TO OFFER OTHER OPINIONS.

221
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,046
THAT DOESN'T FURTHER THE

222
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:57,480
CONVERSATION.

223
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,014
ONE OTHER POINT --

224
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:58,548
>> NO.

225
00:06:58,548 --> 00:06:59,849
IT DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY.

226
00:06:59,849 --> 00:00:00,000
I CAN SEE WHY THEY TRY TO SHUT
