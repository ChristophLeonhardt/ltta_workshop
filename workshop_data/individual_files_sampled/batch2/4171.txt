back with our braking coverage of an unprecedented decision from the new york times publishing this anonymous firecracker op-ed from a current senior official in the trump administration MSNBC's Rachel Maddow was calling in earlier to our programming our braking coverage to say this is now tonight a pivotal point in the Trump presidency I just feel like somebody is trying to pull the fire alarm and I'm not sure that we know as a country how we are supposed to respond when an alarm like this is sounded that's why today feels like the start of something and there are the are the end of something that feels like a pivot point because this is somebody inside the White House signaling to the outside world that there's a very very serious problem a very serious problem an alarm bell that many people have obviously been talking about and not just Trump critics his fellow Republican party members senator bob Corker had this to say about the op-ed this is just moments ago I didn't think that anything was relayed in that op-ed that was new I mean I think this is what all of us have understood to be the situation from day one so again it's not very it didn't reveal much to me I understand this is the case I am joined by another man who probably understands the case former RNC chair Michael Steele let's start rapid-fire like a deposition sure number one have you ever seen an op-ed like this and when you've been in this town no no number two do you believe it to be true yes number three do you think the New York Times is right to publish it yes and finally number four do you think this person was right to do it yes on all those counts and what I find so stunning and it's nice the way you into that with corkers comment oh we all knew this yeah we've known this for a while this is how it is so if you see a neighbor's house on fire should you not go and alert the neighbor that their house is on fire if you if you have someone in your family who's ill should you not you know be concerned about how that illness is progressing this idea that you know that there is a problem and that in when you are in a position as one of the co-equal branches of government to do something about it within the party structure itself or without the party outside the party structure I just find it stunning that you you will have people say yeah we've known us all the time so what does it say about you're concerned about where the country is going and how we're going to get to whatever that place is so yeah I think finally someone inside the administration said this is enough and I think what the precipitous moment was was John McCain's funeral I think we cants funeral lit a fire in a way that is now maybe given some impetus given a voice to some of these folks yes this is anonymous but this is a voice from a very secure location well you're you're you're doing something very important you're talking about the R word the remedy the remedy and dozens of Congress look at something like this or look at the very serious reported problems in the Woodward book and today these are problems of national security of military of the nature of our economy do we hold hearings do we get people under oath do we work on a remedy or not and that was the actually same word that our colleague Rachel Maddow was bearing down and I want you to listen this for your response also again just really moments ago when she called it I think that the curiosity about who this is is the rifle province of the White House I think that what the rest of us should be thinking about is what the what the constitutional remedy is to the kind of crisis that this anonymous author is alerting us to I've never seen anything like this I've never read about anything like this in US history and she's absolutely right so what is the remedy so but here's the Paula here's the politics of this the remedy is hearings now it's one thing if that's those hearings in investigation or concerns are elicited and expressed by Republicans it's something different if we're Democrats win the house this fall and next year they do it because it's somehow will be less legitimate if they do it it somehow will be less authentic if they do it because it's stuck in this quagmire of politics Republicans who are the governing majority of this country if they take the bull by the horn and they lead on this and they on the heels of McCain's words from the grave if you will on the heels of this op-ed take to heart the the warnings that are being placed out there and begin to inquire publicly about what is really going inside the White House it will have a profoundly important impact on how we go forward the other remedy which we were discussing at the top of the hour as some of our guests were debating how to do this and the propriety even of this piece which is I admit and then we've recovered controversial right is the public resignation and we haven't seen that in the same way with Trump our staff was looking at this with LBJ for example at a very unpopular war there was a health education and welfare secretary John Gardner he resigned saying couldn't support Vietnam he privately told the president he wouldn't even support him for re-election right that was a person run stood up we the Nixon Watergate example is often brought up but that was about criminality right that the Vietnam example is important because it relates to people who say even if Donald Trump didn't commit a crime in office which is under investigation there are something so immoral and this essay calls him a moral that you stand up and publicly resign do you think that should be done more no I I think there's a big difference between the LBJ analogy and in here LBJ that was about a war it's about a singular decision a singular act a singular moment in time this is about something beyond policy this is about the the way the president is governing how the president's governing and so here these folks are in a dilemma trying to decide and I thought about this because it made no sense you did I had the natural inclinations get the hell out of Dodge this is crazy I can't do crazy town anymore right you have your passport on you I do yeah Ben look yeah I'm ready I'm there I'm gone right no in the old days of watching everyone carry around their Constitution right now people just keep the passport let's hit the pass go back but but Michael keep it together this is a serious progress but but but here's the rub that thinking now is shifted to I got to stay here to hold hold on to this desk and hold on to these walls to keep this thing together because this is about something bigger that a single policy so we've talked about the remedy we've talked about the proper reaction and we've talked about the person and persons implicated in this piece that are putting up what is this historic alarm bell the other big question hanging over this is where's the New York Times which Donald Trump was just attacking by name where do they to the decision they made and so would be interesting to talk to someone from from that experience and guess what we're gonna do that right now that you stay right here with me this is how you know it's breaking real-time coverage because Michael Steele's bobbin and Weavin stay with me New York Times explained the decision to publish the piece and I want to read this to you they said they're taking this rare step to publish the essay by a senior official whose job would literally be jeopardized by its disclosure and as I mentioned the former executive editor of that very paper how old range joins me now how thank you for jumping on the phone I'm breaking coverage Michael Steele still with me the question to you simply off the top have you ever seen anything like this are you confident that New York Times has the real deal as senior official and do you agree with the decision I've never seen anything like this in the history of the time based on my 25 years inside the institution and my personal knowledge of the men who made this decision I'm confident the time that's done the right thing it all hinges on the senior official designation I don't think James Bennett or his publisher a cheese sauce murder would have gambled on that and I'm I believe that in their place I would have made the same decision and let me elaborate on that a little bit this is unprecedented on the part of the times but we are at a time that calls for leading journalistic institutions to step into the picture and figure out new approaches to deal with what is frankly a time of crisis we have now land ask you when you say new approaches in your view given your knowledge of the paper in Washington do you think it's possible that this highly controversial move could be more effective than the traditional resignation yeah I think it will have a higher impact we can't read the mind of the person behind this but I think another resignation would have just been another serious person leaving a deist unknowns single administration now here is why I think this is in keeping with the highest traditions of public service that's always been the times guiding light this op ed is doing what a supine Congress and a Republican Party leadership is failing to do this action is is necessary at a time when the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader manifestly won't do their jobs so I you know I'm proud of the times today and I have all confidence that that James Bennet and the others who were involved in this decision if any it it's his department I'm sure he was the key decision-maker along with the publisher AG's point I'm gonna ask you Howell and then and then Michael as well The Times is very rigorous in every word and sentence that goes in as you know so they made the big decision to do this and then they made the editing decision to run the piece the piece also carries very provocative language asserting that there were discussions inside the government about the very unlikely potential of using the 25th amendment of the Constitution to try to forcibly remove Donald Trump from office I wonder what you think about how The Times decides to include that and for context I want to mention reporting that said that according to two sources with knowledge of a certain conversation Steve and who worked for the president at one time told Trump the risk to his presidency was not impeachment but the 25th amendment and that reportedly when Bannen mentioned that Trump said quote what's that how do you read the the resurgence of the 25th amendment within this provocative piece verse howl and then and then the Chairman I think it's the I think it's the appropriate conversation to have and the piece would have had a gap in it had it not brought that up because the 25th amendment is the business that ought to be on the table before the Congress and within the cabinet and my guess is that someone high up in that in those circles not the Congress but the but the administration is author and and that person identity will come out and the nation will be able to judge whether I'm right that the Times has done fulfilled its mission for public service at a time of national crisis Thank You Howell Michael your thought yeah I think Hall is right about The Times approach to this whole thing of The Times knows who this is so they have the complete picture it's not is going to be a surprise to them when the name comes out right so they know and going forward tells you just how serious they believe this is and how serious they believe this person is to do this with respect to the 25th amendment piece that's been a discussion that's floated back for over a year now I'm curious as to the timing of when that how if that discussion sort of amped up a bit in recent months in light of other events that have been going on in the White House if that's now something that's being revisited among cabinet members because clearly this person has access to that may in fact be a cabinet member themselves we don't know but I'm curious about the timing of that particular part of that of that narrative whether or not this is something that's old and there's a reference back to in this op-ed or if it's something that's more recent that is currently under consideration and discussion by some members right hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
