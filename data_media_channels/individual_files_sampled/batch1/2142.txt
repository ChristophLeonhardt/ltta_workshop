saying the phrase I love you is a major milestone in every romantic relationship but who says it first actually stepping up and saying it can be scary because according to psychologists art Markman at the University of Texas at Austin the fear of not being reciprocated is terrifying enough to make you hold back so who in heterosexual relationships usually says I love you first Jessa Burgess Psychology Today dove into the scientific literature to find out according to a study from Penn State University at Harrisburg it's men who are more likely to say I love you first in fact some men start confessing those three words within just a few weeks after dating but why are men in such a hurry the researchers have a couple of theories first they suspect that women instinctively need more time to assess their partner's value as a mate and second men could be using it as means to an end another study led by the University of Michigan supports the second theory the study revealed that a man tends to say I love you before he's had sex with his partner for the first time the researchers think it contributes to gaining a partner's trust which might expedite the relationship to the next level but this is also a risky gamble because women can pick up on this strategy according to the study in fact the researchers reported that women were happier when their partner said I love you after having sex for the first time but sex isn't everything according to University of Texas professor art Markman men often say I love you first because they think the man should always take the lead in the same way that men are traditionally expected to ask the woman on the first date and propose marriage so if you're going to say it make sure you mean it
