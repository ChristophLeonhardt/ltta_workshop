first this big news Russia hitting back kicking out sixty diplomats from the United States this is days of course after the Trump administration did what many said had been too long a time coming expelling sixty Russians as punishment for Russia taking that blatant move of allegedly poisoning a former spy of theirs on Western soil in the UK this news comes as Muller is asking questions about the Trump campaign specific Russia contacts at the GOP convention in 2016 and why the GOP suddenly strangely softened its stance against Russia it is a question indicted Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort has faced before there's been some controversy about something in the Republican party platform that essentially changed the Republican Party's views when it comes to Ukraine how much influence did you have on changing that language sir I had know everybody on the platform committee had said it came from the Trump campaign if not you who know it actually did not come to the Trump foreign campaign uh that was the public denial then but the new focus is on mana fort not just from a journalistic line of questioning but people with subpoena power and it comes of course as he's in a different story the White House scrambling to try to push back against these credible New York Times reports the Trump recently the recently ousted lawyer John Dowd was dangling the idea of pardons - yes Paul Manafort as well as Michael Flint I want to be clear Dowd is denying this story vociferously this week Muller not likely to just take him at his word though and we know mother is not afraid to get tough with lawyers he fought famously to force yes Paul mana forts lawyer to testify before a grand jury and one it wasn't just aggressive it was almost unheard of it's unusual for the government to subpoena somebody's lawyer period I mean if you've watched one episode of Perry Mason you know the hell we had this you know how where this is right when lawyers and their clients talk to each other those communications are protected by attorney-client privilege trying to force an attorney to testify about something related to his or her client that is very unusual unusual but Muller pulled it off he won that battle in court making Manta Ford's lawyer testify now Muller has more questions for mana Ford's lawyers as well as now Donald Trump's most recently departed lawyer I want to turn now to Bill Kristol editor at large for The Weekly Standard Margaret Carlson a column for The Daily Beast and a very special guest Michael Conway an attorney who served as counsel the House Judiciary Committee during Richard Nixon's impeachment and Michael in a moment I'm gonna ask you about a whole nother piece of this story and whether the abuse of pardons itself can be grounds for impeachment before we go there bill kristol your view of all of this breaking news I just ran through and the heat on the lawyers I think the bullet probe moves ahead he's I don't know a lot more than people realize and probably knows a lot more than people realize it may be closer to doing some dramatic things than people realize I think Donald Trump may realize however that things are getting hotter for him and I continue to think that the prospect of an attempt to fire or limit somehow Muller's investigation and/or the prospect of pardons remains very real I think Trump thinks that's just wanted to do it for all along and I've got to think he's he's thinking the moment is close and the idea that it's Flynn Margaret is very important because this was the fight before all this got started before there was a Bob Muller Special Counsel probe there were credible reports of Donald Trump trying to do what a pardon might do now before there ever was a need for one which has stopped the probe into Flynn and James Comey testified on this under oath he's off the general Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy I understood him to be saying that what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn's account of his conversations with the Russians I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct I took it as a very disturbing thing very concerning Margaret how does that testimony connect to this new report well it's Trump has always felt very protective towards Michael Flynn and he said in his conversation with Comey that he was a good guy and didn't couldn't Comey see his way clear to to let him go in that presser we we see of walking to the helicopter on the South Lawn he he says then I am NOT talking about a Michael Flynn pardon yet they yet I think is the the word to concentrate on he's always wanted to do it and I think his bill says I think he's closer to feeling the hot breath of Muller on his neck than we know and is more likely to now that doubt is gone to put into operation getting rid of Muller and to use that massive broad pardon power now that's very evocative does that make Muller sort of a wolf it's not like I was I don't know you choose you choose the animal well Michael will tell you analogies are powerful and storytelling as well as in case law and I turn to you Michael for something you flagged that I think is going to interest a lot of people whether Donald Trump and John Dowd realized it or not everyone knows of course obstruction was this key part of the impeachment of Richard Nixon but maybe Trump and out don't know that congressional investigators at the time specifically looked at the abuse of yes the pardon and clemency power and whether it was an effort to silence potential witnesses sound familiar but we don't know if Donald Trump directed John Dowd to do any of that or if he offered anything exchange for pardons to be clear but let's show you exactly what happened in that Nixon era first article one of the House Judiciary impeachment articles stating that Nixon was trying to cause defendants to quote expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony so right there that is an impeachment article that is a type of legal history looking at the very issue of the abuse of pardons in that way and that's not all the House Judiciary report expands on the issue saying not only did Nixon let others discuss pardons but he personally discussed potential clemency for a watergate co-conspirator Michael as I mentioned you were in the middle of this do you see any of this potentially applying if there was a misuse of pardon power today oh absolutely it's a complete parallel with what President Nixon did in that case the burglar you referred to as Howard hunt and Howard hunt one in clemency and Chuck Colson who was a member of the White House staff went to Howard hunts lawyer he didn't talk to Howard Hahn directly and held out the dangled I think is the best way to describe it the concept of clemency Howard hunt then pled guilty and wanted to be out of prison by Christmas of that year and Colson talked to President Nixon about it President Nixon and one of the White House tapes acknowledges that he thought well you know maybe there are family circumstances and so forth that that could lead to clemency and it wasn't just Howard hunt in order to get favorable testimony from a couple of other aides including John Mitchell and Jeb Magruder he told his staff to go out and hold out the prospect of a potential commutation which would be receiving the key their doors lie that today is if you watch Judge Napolitano or the president's allies they're gonna they're gonna say hey this is a lawful power it's a constitutional power your point is that even if Nixon did have that power I don't think that's up for debate the abuse of it was a potential ingredient of impeachment do I have that right absolutely I mean the pardon would still be effective if a pardon Flynn Flynn's pardon at least from federal crimes obviously as you well know not from state crash or it could still be prosecuted there there but yes it's an abuse of his power to do this if it's for a corrupt purpose the krupp purpose is not just protecting president Trump himself but protecting his campaign protecting his associates protecting his family members Bill Kristol what do you think of this theory and do you think it's known in the White House I think it may be known but I think they may we'll see what they what they think I mean look these keeps testing I mean do you Trump you and I have discussed this before all right I think you and I are in a minority but I think we're right in understanding Trump which is of course he's an adolescent do you find being in the minority it's the best of all things are you into who's right then great thankfully absolutely so here's the I mean everyone says he's you know he's volatile Idina lit whatever the last person he see someone in TV gives him a job oh this is true but at the end of the day directionally Trump has a few things he cares about and he moves towards those goals and whether they're policy goals that he cares about terrorists and so forth or in this case impeding and stopping and blunting and removing if possible this whole investigation then he makes fits and starts and as he did with other policy issues the Iran deal he wants to get rid of it he gets to talk to head of it for three or four four five months so that he gets moves further on to getting rid of it and finally he's going to and so forth and I think that's very much what's been happening in this case he keeps testing the waters he goes forward he pulls back a little and he's gotten pretty far if you get where we are now and without and you know without much in the way of checks from Republicans but let me key to me the Republicans on the hill I stepped up in any authoritative way and said mr. president this you cannot do and absent that I've just got to think he keeps on moving forward let me link that for Margaret with news today that Andy McCabe who was the only deputy FBI director ever fired in American history and obviously the only one fired after a false set of attacks posted online by the President on Twitter he's launched a defense a defense fund you can see it there him and his family and his dog and he's an FBI veteran and and there they say in the first eight year estimates are up over a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars which doesn't necessary mean anything in either way because people in politics I'm sure can draw from all sorts of corners of sources but Margaret it does speak to what's going on in America right now which is someone who served their country for these twenty years and rose to number two at one point he was acting FBI director was fired after a haranguing political rant from the president you know literally days before his pension would kick in on and I when I say these things people think oh is it my being unfair this is just what it was on secret evidence that still has not been revealed or disclosed and so I wonder if to Bill's point Margaret that's the kind of thing that is Trump tests and says oh look I can fire the FBI director deputy director and muse about pardons II yeah I'm getting hit a little bit but but nothing really bad is happening to him by the Republicans well Trump also has laid some groundwork here I mean I think in Andrew McCabe evokes tremendous sympathy because of how Trump laid it out that you know his wife's a loser and he's going to be fired for cause on the eve of his retirement where he would get his pension you know that just evokes sympathy but only up from about maybe half of the country the other half of the country has been convinced by Trump and his allies in the Congress that the FBI is a corrupt institution but filled with people from the deep state and you know from lawyers like Joe to Genova that fabricated evidence and framed the president so there are these two tracks going along and Trump gauges which one is more important to him and which one has more heft at any one time and then he pushes a little bit further I mean he's floated firing Muller a couple of times and he floated firing Andy McCabe and then he did it right so buckle up whether or not you can feel the wolf breathing on your neck as you put it Margaret hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
