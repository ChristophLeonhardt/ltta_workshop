OF THAT REGIME. ISN’T IT IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT

181
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:42,906
ISN’T IT IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT WHAT DID OUR INTELLIGENCE

182

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. IF IT IS TRUE THAT U.S.

SAUDIS WERE TRYING TO TRACK HIM DOWN AND TRYING TO KIDNAP HIM,

199
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:12,736
DOWN AND TRYING TO KIDNAP HIM, WHY ON EARTH DID THEY ALLOW HIM

200
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,639
WHY ON EARTH DID THEY ALLOW HIM TO GO TO A SAUDI CONSULATE OR TO

201
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,708
TO GO TO A SAUDI CONSULATE OR TO GO TO TURKEY WHERE HE WAS LIKELY

202
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:20,244
GO TO TURKEY WHERE HE WAS LIKELY TO GO TO A SAUDI CONSULATE?

203
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:21,045
TO GO TO A SAUDI CONSULATE? HE FLED SAUDI ARABIA TO COME TO

204
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:21,712
HE FLED SAUDI ARABIA TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES.

205

00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:32,055
PROFILE CRITIC OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

210
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,124
GOVERNMENT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY EASY FOR

230
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:21,105
THAT LAST NIGHT. WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLY

231
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:22,173
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLY IMPOSING SANCTIONS ON SAUDI

232
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,808
IMPOSING SANCTIONS ON SAUDI ARABIA OR AT LEAST BLOCKING THE

233
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:27,678
ARABIA OR AT LEAST BLOCKING THE ARMS DEAL, HIS RESPONSE WAS VERY

234
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:27,978
ARMS DEAL, HIS RESPONSE WAS VERY BLUNT.

235
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,413
BLUNT. HE DEFAULTED TO THE ECONOMIC

236
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:30,915
HE DEFAULTED TO THE ECONOMIC POSITIONS THAT SAUDI ARABIA BUYS

237
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,550
POSITIONS THAT SAUDI ARABIA BUYS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF

238
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,518
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS AND TRA TRANSLATES INTO

239
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:35,987
WEAPONS AND TRA TRANSLATES INTO JOBS AND A BOOST INTO THE

240
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,686
JOBS AND A BOOST INTO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.

241
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:37,788
AMERICAN ECONOMY. THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING

242
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,789
THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS ASKED

243
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,725
LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGH

244
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,926
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGH RISK ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT BY

245
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:43,561
RISK ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT BY THE SAUDIS ON SOMEBODY THAT WAS

246
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:44,328

LIVING HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

248
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:47,499
STATES. SO I THINK IT KIND OF PUTS INTO

249
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,033
SO I THINK IT KIND OF PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW THE WHITE HOUSE,

250
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,434
PERSPECTIVE HOW THE WHITE HOUSE, HOW OTHERS VIEW THE SAUDI

251
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:51,703
HOW OTHERS VIEW THE SAUDI RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED

252
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:52,103
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES.

253
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:53,504
STATES. IT’S NOT JUST ECONOMIC.

254
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:56,807
IT’S NOT JUST ECONOMIC. WE KNOW THERE’S A LONG STANDING

255
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,742
WE KNOW THERE’S A LONG STANDING INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY

259
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,414

260
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:03,848
RATTLE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP.

261
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,850
RELATIONSHIP. SOME PEOPLE SAY IF THE U.S.

262
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:07,051
SOME PEOPLE SAY IF THE U.S. DIDN’T CRITICIZE SAUDI ARABIA

263
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,287
DIDN’T CRITICIZE SAUDI ARABIA AFTER 9/11 AND DIDN’T PUT A LOT

264
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:12,223
AFTER 9/11 AND DIDN’T PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE SAUDIS THEN,

265
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:15,160
OF PRESSURE ON THE SAUDIS THEN, WE ARE ENTER ING A WHOLE NEW

266
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:17,129
