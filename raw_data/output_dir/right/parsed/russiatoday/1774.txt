jawohl they starved us they harassed us
they moved around in our blood as you
see these tunnels are massive
they make apps his work on them as well
as civilians they wouldn't feed those
who refuse to work and you can see how
big they are and how much they have in
there it's like a city beneath a city
we would be taken to the spot where the
fighting would be and they would give us
a Mac 15 minutes before it started they
showed us how to act and whom to shoot
the guy he told us what to do would then
disappear after that it all depended on
luck before the fighting they used to
tell us about jihad these martyrs of
jihad and about heroic death on the
battlefield but other times they treated
us like dogs
