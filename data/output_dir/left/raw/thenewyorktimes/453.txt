00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,670
President Trump has fired 
F.B.I. director James Comey

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,874
over his handling of the investigation 
into Hillary Clinton’s emails.</font>

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,744
Comey was also looking into 
whether Trump campaign associates

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:15,248
cooperated with Russia
to undermine the 2016 election.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,718
Over the last year, Comey’s efforts
have led to strong pushback

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,489
from Trump over everything
from Clinton emails to Russia ties.

7
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,295
In July 2016, 
Comey issued a bombshell:

8
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,765
“We are expressing to Justice 
our view

9
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,134
that no charges are appropriate 
in this case.”

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,970
Trump wasn’t happy.
He took to Twitter.

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,952
Comey decided to broach 
the Clinton saga again, in October,

12
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,288
when he said there might
be new evidence in emails

13
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,526
forwarded by a top Clinton aide
to her husband, Anthony Weiner.

14
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,394
At the time,
Trump applauded the move.

15
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:07,834
“And it took guts for Director Comey
to make the move that he made,

16
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,804
in light of the kind
of opposition he had,

17
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:15,108
where they’re trying to protect her
from criminal prosecution.”

18
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,545
But Trump then used it
as a rationale for firing Comey.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,483
Trump had long been
dogged by rumors

20
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,553
that members of his campaign
had ties to Russia.

21
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:31,191
“I own nothing in Russia.
I have no loans in Russia.

22
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,960
I don’t have any deals in Russia.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,795
Russia is fake news.

24
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,431
Russia — this is fake news
put out by the media.”

25
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,534
In March 2017,
Comey made it official.

26
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:46,372
“That includes investigating
the nature of any links between

27
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,877
individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government.”

28
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,749
In March, the president
issued a surprising tweet,

29
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,652
saying Obama had wiretapped
Trump Tower.

30
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,556
Comey refuted that:

31
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,526
“With respect to the
president’s tweets

32
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,395
about alleged wiretapping directed
at him by the prior administration,

33
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,099
I have no information
that supports those tweets,

34
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,502
and we have looked carefully
inside the F.B.I.”

35
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,570
Trump then tried to walk it back:

36
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,205
“And don't forget,
when I say ‘wiretapped,’

37
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,206
those words were in quotes.”

38
00:02:20,473 --> 00:00:00,000
Less than two months later,
Comey was out.
