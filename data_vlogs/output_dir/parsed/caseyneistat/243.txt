flying it - it's wrong so it's late
right now it's 9 o'clock on a Wednesday
I'm headed to Los Angeles
Jesse's camera with me this video that
I've been talking about this big holiday

of prep work for that video and that's
the purpose of this trip
Los Angeles I say to the hotel last
night Jesse stated his apartment I'm
gonna go meet him now and today we're
doing some research and preparation for
the holiday movie you can't imagine how
excited I am about this whole thing
Jessie why you got all this Samsung's
like yeah I just showed up
Samsung is kind of like sponsoring our
holiday I just went for a run I don't
normally look like this can i film in
your apartment absolutely we're in
Jesse's apartment in Venice we're gonna
leave here now it's we have to go do our
some training for the video is that fair
I need some training for this this is
her time we should do it as pretty
I hate keeping secrets in these videos
but I don't want to sort of let the cat
out of the bag as to exactly what the
holiday video is because there's too
many things that could go wrong and then
you would be upset at at me and Jesse a
little bit but mostly at me but we're
going to Long Beach right now and we're
going to learn how to do something that
sort of has something to do with what
the holiday video is I sound like a jerk
when I won't to say what it is they know
is gonna be epic
we just want to make sure you stick
around
are you looking for Casey oh hey I'm so
sorry

your name bill bill bill that's Jesse
just left a message what are you doing
yeah well I got my stuff here your I'm
ready to fly let me uh
I mean I gotta go over and check out
I never got in the water which is
tremendously disappointing but the
purpose of coming here was to learn how
to handle a kite and I did learn that
even though I didn't get wet he did
pretty good actually I feel like I did
pretty good
I don't think of today as a failure I
think I did learn a lot and that was the
purpose of that this is Andy here before

production meetings this is sort of it
for the prep for the holiday video shoot

for the shoot and Jessie seeing a photo
of what the costuming looks like he
probably needed

going to the Grove now to see the see
Samson's VR installation there and then
Jesse and I still have some more I guess
we could do it on the airplane on Sunday

think all the prep that we could do is
done this is the night before our for
DVR experience our video is
unapologetically a Christmas video but
and it sort of involves a sleigh Santa's
sleigh but not this one you get dizzy at
any point in time just close your eyes
has anybody thrown up yet all right
again with the hints for what we're
doing this is a virtual of virtual
experience where you get to be Santa
Anas sleigh right and this is sort of
practice for what our movie is is that
given too much away it might be
I'll see you next week on location for a
movie here I'm in New York

what's on Sunday when we yeah that's
almost a I've got one more sort of
formal like proper production meeting
