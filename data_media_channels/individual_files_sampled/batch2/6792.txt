a number of Fox News reporters are leaving the network and they are stating that they're uncomfortable with the direction that Fox News has gone in now Fox News has clearly been in favor of conservatives they have been a propaganda tool by conservatives for quite some time now however the pro Trump propaganda is rubbing some of the reporters the wrong way so Conner Powell is one of the reporters who has stepped away from the network stepping down from the network Fox News foreign correspondent has stepped down this week after nine years of reporting for the network so here's a photo of Conner Powell and he hasn't publicly stated this but sources who are close to him revealed that he is stepping down well here's what he publicly said those of you who have spoken to me in recent months you will understand why I'm leaving Fox News Channel a little bit of a cryptic message sources close to him have told the press that he has actually stepped away because he's uncomfortable with the pro-trump propaganda of the network lots of reporters are very unhappy with directions of Fox News Channel right now fewer news shows more opinion shows less resources for reporters to report yeah look I got huge mixed feelings about this bless his heart for leaving that's great and it's a principled position but who are we kidding Fox News was 100% on the Republican side during the bush years during the Obama years during the last nine years during all the years fewer reporters more opinion hosts that's the whole business model of Fox News in fact I remember when they first came out in 1990s and the other networks complained they don't even have any foreign bureaus they don't have any bureaus cuz they're in the opinion business I actually don't complain about that that's fine that's their prerogative and they want to be conservative that's their prerogative my mind that they lie about it and so he's in a sense these pretty little lies about how they just turned into a propaganda machine is what bothers me more Ralph Peters look I appreciate the things that he's saying yes Trump and how Trump has betrayed the country and I think he's right about that but Ralph Peters didn't mind when Fox News was doing propaganda for the neo cons and starting more Wars Ralph Peters was on board for that propaganda as a so-called military analyst for Fox News so there's a lot of johnny-come-lately here and saying that they are emphasizing Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson Laura Ingraham yeah but let's keep it real those are the guys who make that money those are the guys who bring in all the viewers I mean did you think that your reporting was doing that so I again I'm not trying to hate on the guy I think that it's it's still an act of courage when not a lot of other people are showing that courage and I appreciate anyone who's honest about a criticism of the Trump administration and of the media it just bothers me that when people pretend that this is a new phenomenon Fox News has been doing this for a long time here I'll give me one last example and did you know that Fox News hired george w bush's cousin to be their election expert to decide who's gonna win who's gonna lose on the in the 2000 election and that he called election before any of the other networks did when it was clearly a tie everyone know now acknowledges it was a statistical kind none of the network's should have called that election under any circumstance but they knew that but they rigged it so they Bush's cousin was gonna call the election and when they when Fox News did it all the other lemmings in the media went along thinking that Fox News is a real news organization they didn't know the Bush's cousin had called the election and they all said oh okay they called it we got to call it too and then they called it and then that led to a situation where Bush became president even though he actually never even won Florida he didn't win the popular war he didn't win the electoral vote when the later they counted the votes in Florida it turns out Gore had won but we never found out because Fox News had rigged this system so if you want to protest against them now great but if you want to tell me that they were doing news all along that's just not remotely true they invented fake news two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos you
