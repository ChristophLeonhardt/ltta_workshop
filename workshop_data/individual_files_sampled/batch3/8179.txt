SHANNON. Shannon: AT THE STATE TO PARTNER, THANK YOU. IF THERE ARE REPORTS MAKE THAT GINA HASPEL IS TRAVELING TO TURKEY AMID AN INTERNATIONAL OUTCRY AFTER SAUDI ARABIA'S EXPEDITION ABOUT THE DEATH OF JOURNALIST KHASHOGGI AND THE TURKISH PRESIDENT SAYS HIS INVESTIGATION WILL REVEAL THE NAKED TRUTH, POSSIBLY A DIFFERENT TRUTH. TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN MEETS WITH THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE AS HE CONTINUES TO DENY ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE KILLING. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE IS NOT SATISFIED BY WHAT HE HAS HEARD FROM THE SAUDIS SO FAR. I'M GOING TO KNOW VERY SHORTLY. HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE IN TURKEY RIGHT NOW AND A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA AND I WILL KNOW VERY SOON. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HEARD. Shannon: JOINING ME NOW, FORMER CIA STATION CHIEF, DANIEL HOFFMAN, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LET'S START WITH TURKEY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE CIA DIRECTOR IS IN ROUTE, IF NOT ALREADY THERE. HE SAID HE'S GOING TO PUBLICLY LAY OUT WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND IN THEIR INVESTIGATION SO FAR. SO HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT SHE IS THERE AS WELL? I THINK IT WAS A GREAT MOVE FOR HER TO TRAVEL TO TURKEY BECAUSE THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SAY TOMORROW IS BASED ON THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HIS SERVICE, HIS INTELLIGENCE AND SERVICES COLLECTED. THE TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE OF THE CONSULATE, HUMAN SURVEILLANCE IS REALLY THE BASIS, THE EVIDENCE ON WHICH THE WHOLE CASE RELIES AND I THINK THE DIRECTOR WILL BE THERE TOMORROW HERSELF FIRSTHAND TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE AND TO ENGAGE WITH SENIOR TURKISH OFFICIALS. Shannon: "THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS THIS, THE CHIEF CONCERN FOR WASHINGTON IS THAT THE TURKISH PRESIDENT WILL REVEALED DETAILS ABOUT THE KILLINGS THAT IMPLICATE CROWN PRINCE THE CROWN A KEY ALL PRINCE THE CROWN A KEY ALY PRINCE THE CROWN A KEY ALF PRINCE THE CROWN A KEY ALR PRINCE THE CROWN A KEY ALT PRINCE THE CROWN A KEY ALE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THEY ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT, BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID REPEATEDLY WE ARE SENDING OUR TOP PEOPLE OVER THERE, WE KNOW THAT SECRETARY WHEN NGUYEN IS OVER THERE NOW. HE SAYS WE WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION, WHO GAVE THE ORDER TO SEND THESE 15 SALARIES ON THE GULFSTREAM TO ESSENTIALLY MURDER KHASHOGGI? AND WERE THOSE ORDERS CARRIED OUT AS THEY WERE INTENDED? WAS THE GUY WHO GAVE THE ORDER THE CROWN PRINCE MIKE AND IF IT WAS THAT IS GOING TO HAVE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS. TOMORROW BEGINS THE SAUDI INVESTORS CONFERENCE AND NOBODY IS SHOWING UP EXCEPT THE RUSSIANS AND THE PAKISTANIS. THAT REALLY DOESN'T AUGUR WELL FOR THE PRINCESS SIGNATURE SALT DOME OF POLICY, DESIGNED TO DIVERSIFY THE SAUDI ECONOMY. IF THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE SAUDIS ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. Shannon: BRET BAIER THIS WE CAN TALK WITH THE SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER AND HERE WAS HIS EXPLANATION ABOUT THIS MISSION. THIS WAS AN OPERATION WHERE INDIVIDUALS ENDED UP EXCEEDING THE AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THEY HAD. THEY MADE THE MISTAKE WHEN THEY KILLED HIM IN THE CONSULATE AND THEY TRY TO COVER UP FOR IT. Shannon: HE DID GO ON TO REFER TO IT AS A CRIMINAL ACT. HE SAID PEOPLE WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. WILL THERE BE DEFINITIVE ENOUGH FINDINGS TO TELL US WHETHER OR NOT THE CROWN PRINCE WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN GIVING ORDERS? AGAIN, I THINK THAT'S THE PENULTIMATE QUESTION. I WOULD BE HESITANT TO OFFER A GUESS ABOUT WHETHER I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO PROVE THAT OR NOT, BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ALREADY KNOWS A WHOLE LOT. AND RIGHT NOW THE TURKS ARE OUT FRONT SAYING WHAT THEY'VE GOT WITH THE EVIDENCE, WE WILL HEAR MORE TOMORROW. BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SECRETARY POMPEO FLEW TO RIYADH AND PRESSED THE SAUDIS I THINK PARTLY WAS BECAUSE WE KIND OF KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING WITH SOME TRANSPARENCY. WE KNOW THAT AT THE BEGINNING THEY HAD SAID THAT KHASHOGGI SIMPLY WALKED OUT OF THE CONSULATE, WHICH WASN'T TRUE. AND THEN THIS ODD DESCRIPTION OF A BRAWL WHICH ELECTED WITH ONE GUY AGAINST 15. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF TRUTH TO GET TO HEAR. Shannon: I WANT TO QUICKLY ASK YOU BEFORE WE GO ABOUT RUSSIA, THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO PULL OUT OF THE INF TREATY. HE SAYS WE ARE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR NUKES UNTIL THEY COME TO THEIR SENSES, WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP DOING IT SO NOBODY CAN CHALLENGE US. THIS IS A GOOD BIT OF KREMLIN THEATER GOING BACK TO 2007, VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID THE INF TREATY WASN'T VERY GOOD FOR RUSSIA. HE NEEDS INTERMEDIATE RANGE NUCLEAR FORCES TO DEAL WITH EUROPE AND TO DEAL WITH CHINA AS WELL. HE'S GOT THE SS 25. ABSOLUTELY VIOLATED THIS TREATY BUT HE'S TRYING TO PORTRAY IT AS IF THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONE NOT ADHERING TO THE TREATY. RUSSIA LIKES TO SAY THAT WE ARE COMMITTED, THAT RUSSIA IS COMMITTED TO A MULTIPOLAR WORLD IN THE UNITED STATES WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. NOTHING CAN BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE AMBASSADOR BOLTON GO OUT AND GIVE ONE OF HIS PRESS CONFERENCES FROM MOSCOW WHERE HE HOLDS THE RUSSIANS ACCOUNTABLE.
