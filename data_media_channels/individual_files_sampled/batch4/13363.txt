professor so you haven't I'm still not sure where you're coming down in this election cycle I'm not voting for either candidate because neither one of them meets my standard for basic human beings to be even breathing air sometimes but mostly just to be holding office the obviously I want them to live but but the idea here is that you know my view is that neither candidate meets a basic standard well do you a do view this as a lesser of two evils election as some people like Mark Levin have claims do you see this more as we're screwed either way we go so there's no reason to participate on the presidential level how do you come down on this well my preference would be to leave the office vacant for four years and hopes of better things that way it's exchanged especially that's not one of the options that we have I think it's going to be dangerous but not really bad if he really becomes president all the questions where is the danger greatest and when more importantly the most long-lasting and I think that even though Donald Trump has no coherent a vision that looks that promising does have a color hearing they and it's a rule which she can by determining who's on the next Supreme Court for the next 50 years law in America can be undermined the first and second amendments we can write off if she's allowed to put them a draw on that court and so wrong athlete whether it's Clinton love jump long after they leave office the people they put on the Supreme Court will be a legacy for the next generation and perhaps to the end of constitutional law in this country and on that basis I would vote against Hillary Clinton yeah and then that's a logic I definitely hear my counter logic just to not vote at all has basically been what I fear is that Donald Trump is doing a great job of perverting conservatism and we're watching as many so-called conservative thought leaders have been shifting the very definition of conservatism to meet Trump so suddenly a bunch of people who used to be pro free trade for example are embracing the protectionism of Donald Trump a bunch of people who wanted an entitlement reform are now pretending that it's okay that he wants to expand entitlements and so the only hope for country which the true small government movement is being quashed in order to gain the temporary gain of having him prevent Hillary Clinton from the White House I suspect that those positions will be as temporary as the Trump administration and so I don't I don't think that the ideas are going to go away I mean Jimmy Carter follow policies that upholds conservatives but that didn't prevent Ronald Reagan can be elected after him
