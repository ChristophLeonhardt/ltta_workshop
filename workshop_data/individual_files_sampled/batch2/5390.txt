let me bring in now of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gilliam he's also the Democratic nominee for governor in the state mayor thank you for coming back on the show especially on a morning that I'm sure is incredibly busy for you we just heard from Kerry Sanders that some 24,000 people have remained in Panama City Panama City Beach talk to me about who's left in Tallahassee at this point on what you guys are doing to respond to this well how we thank you again for having me as you know the city of Tallahassee is a little more inland and so we've been a place where evacuees from some of the coastal area have come we've got six shelters in our community open and available not only for those folks but for the folks right here in our own community folks in mobile homes modular units folks who live in homes that are threatened by trees the big threat that we've got in our area is one that we've not seen a storm like this in over a century in our area my city unlike many is covered by about 50% tree cover that's significant those trees will come down we will have major disruption and what we're concerned about right now is making sure that everybody is safe and are taking the proper precautions to keep themselves out of harm's way so mayor you make the point that Tallahassee has not seen a storm like this and I think like a century you obviously haven't led the response to a storm like this either the Tampa Bay Times is writing about your leadership today saying that it's a reminder that that you the city's mayor is a figurehead with no real management powers like his colleagues on the City Council how can people trust that you are able to handle a massive emergency like this well our community is now well trained for the past three and a half years actually the entire time I served as mayor we've actually had to deal with storms we had Hermine followed by and now we're dealing with Michael I will tell you I've been here at the Emergency Operations Center since the beginning of this storm event cancelling all of my campaign related events to be back here to do my job but ensure that we're making the proper preparations we've met with neighborhood leaders we've met with faith leaders we've called in over 600 assets and our electric utility system over a 100 of them are right here on the ground ready to respond after the storm what we want people to do right now was to ensure that they're safe but beyond that I want them to know that their government is prepared but we want them to be prepared for the potential for a long recovery again this is a massive storm its impact will be significant and they can rest assured that we're going to do our jobs we need people in their own homes to do their part are you satisfied with how Governor Scott has been handling this response so far well I tell you we've had an open line of communication I hope that that continues throughout not just the snow preparation but also the recovery I think that's what our citizens expect from us for us to come together doing these times I'm certainly going to do my part to ensure that we keep the governor updated with what we need from the state so that SS can be coordinated and we're going to hope that they continue to lead by example and assist local governments with what we need earlier this morning governor Scott was asked about the individual political campaigns Florida obviously the epicenter not just of this storm but also of the political midterm push as we are now just four weeks away he said it's up to the individual campaigns here on whatever they're gonna pull ads keep ads on the airwaves your Republican opponent opponent Ron de Santos is actually taking his campaign and putting it into rescue and recovery efforts I think he's out there trying to trying to help some folks what do you make of that well actually my opponent has decided to leave all of his Nagar negative advertising up all the way across the Panhandle including right here where we are preparing our citizens for a category 4 hurricane impact those news alerts are obviously on commercial break being intermittently interrupted by negative campaign ads that are untrue and I think that's unfortunate we can't recall a time where candidates for statewide office have not pulled down negative ads during hurricane season you got a whole region of our state where folks are fleeing for their lives anticipating what is a life-threatening event impact in this state I again would encourage my opponent to just subside with the politics we'll have plenty enough room beyond this storm to compete between our ideas what we need now is for the state to come together to reduce our partisanship and to focus on this important storm impacting our state mayor quickly before I let you go your ride and that is a life-threatening storm bearing down on your state here if you end up governor and something like this were to happen you will need federal help you'll need emergency response resources from the federal government and you and President Trump have a pretty bad relationship right now how are you two supposed to work together if in fact this were to happen again and you were leading the state yeah well first of all the governor's job is to do what is in the best interest of the people of the state of Florida the president came on the eve of this storm impacting our state and decided that he wanted to attack me as a sitting mayor who sits right now in the eye of the storm and the pathway and the trajectory of its impact what I encouraged is that the governor and the Prevnar but the president took the high road that the candidate for governor take the high road that what we need from them is leadership not not partisanship the president we want to commander in chief do you see how to work with the president if he's prepared to work with us okay I mean I again I've I've said it along the you know along the trail and obviously I'll say it today I am absolutely prepared to work with the president for the benefit of the people of our state I think that's what you have to do but what we can't do is subside into partisanship and division and unfortunately the president has chosen that tack I think he still has time to recover himself especially as we go into this storm event we're gonna need the assistance of the federal government as our communities begin to repair itself from it may oranger dillmouth Tallahassee Florida mayor thanks for coming on the show appreciate it thank you for checking out our
