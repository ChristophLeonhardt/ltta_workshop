GRIFF: THE DOJ, IG REPORT
REVEALING BIAS.
THIS TIME AGAINST TRUMP
VOTERS.
ABBY: UNIDENTIFIED BUREAU
SUPPORTERS SAY TRUMP
SUPPORTERS ARE ALL POOR TO
MIDDLE CLASS, UNEDUCATED
LAZY, POS THINK HE WILL
MAGICALLY GRANT THEM JOBS
FOR DOING NOTHING.
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T WATCH
THE DEBATES.
AREN'T FULLY EDUCATED ON HIS
POLICIES AND STUPIDLY
WRAPPED UP IN HIS UNMERITED
ENTHUSIASM.
PETE: JOINING US NOW TO
REACT IS FORMER CEO OF
GODFATHER'S PIZZA AND 2012
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
HERMAN CAIN.
MR. KAINE, THANK YOU FOR
BEING HERE THIS MORNING.
>> GOOD MORNING.
PETE: HOW DO YOU REACT TO
THE REVELATION THAT TOP
LEVEL FBI AGENTS CLASSIFIED
NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT BUT
HIS SUPPORTERS THAT WAY.
HOW COULD THEY HAVE BEEN
FAIR IN THE PROCESS?
>> THIS IS AN INSULT BELOW
THE BELT; I HAVE BEEN POOR
BEFORE I WAS POOR.
I KNOW WHAT POOR LOOKS LIKE.
AND SO DID MY DAD.
MY DAD WASN'T AROUND TO VOTE
FOR DONALD TRUMP.
BUT HE WOULD HAVE BECAUSE MY
DAD BELIEVED IN LESS TAXES,
LESS GOVERNMENT.
AND MORE INDIVIDUAL
RESPONSIBILITY.
MY DAD WORKED THREE JOBS
WHEN HE HAD TO.
I DON'T CONSIDER THAT LAZY.
AND WE EVENTUALLY WENT FROM
POOR TO POOR TO WHERE WE
WEREN'T SO POOR.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY
ARE TALKING ABOUT.
ALLOW ME TO MAKE ONE OTHER
POINT.
I'M SURE THAT MOST OF THE
PEOPLE IN THE FBI ARE GOOD,
DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A FEW
BAD APPLES LIKE THE ONES WHO
MAKE THESE KIND OF
STATEMENTS.
I BELIEVE SOMEONE WITH THIS
INSULTING OUGHT TUESDAY SEES
THE WORLD ONLY THROUGH THE
NARROW LENS OF WHAT THEY
CAPTURE IN LIBERAL NEW YORK,
LIBERAL D.C. AND LIBERAL
HOLLYWOOD.
IT DOESN'T REPRESENT THE
LENS OF THE MEDIA FOR
REGULAR PEOPLE.
SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE
LIVING IN A BUBBLE THAT THEY
NEED TO GET OUT OF.
GRIFF: HER MAN, THERE WERE
FIVE AGENTS OUT OF THE IG
REPORT REFERRED FOR
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.
THERE IS CLEARLY A CULTURE
OF PER VASK BIAS EXISTING AT
THE HEADQUARTERS.
I ASK YOU THIS QUESTION.
DO YOU DRAW NOW INTO
QUESTION THE BIAS IN THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
RUDY GIULIANI SAID IT BEST.
THE BASIS FOR GETTING THE
AUTHORITY, THE FISA ORDER IN
ORDER TO START THAT WAS
FLAWED IN ITSELF.
IF THE BASIS IS FLAWED AND
BIASED.
THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE
ABLE GOAT IT SO, YES, IT
DOES BRING INTO QUESTION THE
VALIDITY OF THIS WITCH-HUNT
CALLED THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION.
ABBY: YOU KNOW, GOING BACK
TO THAT TEXT EXCHANGE,
CALLING TRUMP SUPPORTERS
STUPID AND LAZY.
IT REMINDS ME OF HILLARY
CLINTON ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL REFERRING TO SOME OF
THE SUPPORTERS AS A BASKET
OF DEPLORABLES.
WE ALL REMEMBER THAT MOMENT.
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU HAVE FOR
PEOPLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND,
MAYBE, THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS?
YOU ARE ONE YOURSELF.
MANY OF THEM YOU ARE FRIENDS
WITH.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
HOW BETTER DESCRIBE WHO THEY
ARE?
>> DEPLORABLES UNITE.
THAT'S MY MESSAGE TO THEM.
HERE'S WHO THOSE TRUMP
SUPPORTERS ARE.
I GIVE A LOT OF SPEECHES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY I SPOKE
TO A GROUP IN FLORIDA,
JACKSONVILLE JUST YESTERDAY.
HAVE YOU TWO LENSES OUT
THERE, ABBY.
ONE IS THAT VERY NARROW LENS
THAT PREVENTS AMERICA AS
DECIDED AND ALL THE NEGATIVE
STUFF THAT GOES ON.
THEN YOU HAVE THAT WIDE LENS
OF THE PERSONAL PEOPLE WHO
SUE THEM THROUGH THEIR DAILY
LIVES.
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP.
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SUPPORT HIM AND SUPPORT SOME
OF THE REPUBLICANS, MOST OF
THEM IN NOVEMBER.
THAT'S THE AMERICA THAT MOST
OF US SEE.
