leftist frequently accuse us right-wingers of not believing in science you rotten conservatives with your silly fantastical God they say you don't understand that a simple series of natural laws that came out of nowhere not only caused a universe without cause but created a mind that could understand that universe even though it's randomness renders it incomprehensible because this is only one of an infinite number of imaginary universes we made up to explain all this away you backward conservative troglodytes they say you think a formless blob of cells and a woman's womb is a separate person when it hasn't even come through the magic vagina yet we're special humanity dust is sprinkled on it and it suddenly develops the right not to be torn to pieces you Trump loving jackasses they continue you don't even accept the absolute fact that our computer models can predict the future of a climate far too complex for your right wing computers and so we know with absolute certainty that the whole world is going to die seven years ago if you don't give us all the money in power well thanks for your input left wingers and just to show how open-minded we are let's take a look at some more left-wing science here for instance is a wonderful blog called The Selfish activist where body-centered therapist tada kazumi tries to teach what he calls white bodied people how to be allies to other bodied people and if bodied centered therapy is not an example of left-wing science I don't know what is right now in his UMI's blog there's a post entitled why white people can't dance the scientific kazumi says quote any up these quotes are real colonization and westernization have profoundly impacted the way we move our bodies just think about even this little fact most non-european people didn't wear pants before colonization there were they wore robes and skirts no matter the gender we also generally didn't sit on chairs we squatted or sat on the ground many of our cultures didn't glorify tight muscular abs we didn't march like rigid European soldiers did we walked using a slight skating motion from side to side and a subtle ripple up the spine unquote now I know you'd think kazumi would be grateful that white people came along and taught these flabby cheerless rippling skirt wearing savages some sense but no he goes on to say quote I understand now that whiteness is an energetic imbalance caused by a loss of spinal fluid 'ti and awareness of the lower body emotional energy becomes concentrated in the upper body particularly gathering in the mind the white body is in freeze it is ungrounded and cannot feel the earth we see this pained energy of whiteness play out in our society through violence towards sexuality emotional vulnerability and ecology amongst other things unquote so you see left-wingers the truth is writing like this makes me love your left-wing science the new norm macdonald comedy special is also pretty funny trigger warning i'm andrew Clavin and this is the andrew Clavin show we notice a new copy roll over as if it isn't it's a wonder all right its mailbag day and yeah look we got all of those matters I mean this is the wreckage of a studio all by myself we're still building this thing a little Mysore coming it's kinda like Cinderella the mice in the birds are building our studio squirrels are coming and we get a lot of rats but that's okay as long they don't we don't have to pay them as much and we look at these to be it's done probably by mid-july they're telling me now and so for all this time I'm just sitting here in the wreckage pretending and I but I do have the lamps from the motel 6 from a commute so that's my favorite part every time I see this I think like why am i broadcasting from like the no-tell motel it's

because it's so minimalist that's what it is alrighty alright so some of you may have noticed there was a minor you know election a special election in Georgia here is how CNN was reporting the Georgia sixth District vote just a few days ago about June 10th Democrat John Asaf has a seven percentage point edge over Republican karen handel among likely voters in a closely watched special election for a Georgia House II to note a new poll released Friday shows Asaf leads handle 51 percent to 44 percent among likely voters in an Atlanta journal-constitution poll is one of two polls have had him 7 percent ahead the poll shows also of his picking off 13 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of independents in a district that's historically has been reliably red Newt Gingrich and more recently new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price represented it but handle the Republican candidate is drawing virtually no Democratic support here that is what they said the results we're going to be here are the real results we're going to win so much we're going to win at every level we're going to win economically we're going to win with the economy we're going to win with military we're going to win with healthcare and for our veterans we're going to win with every single facet to be my oh my what a wonderful day we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning yeah you say please please it's too much winning we can't take it anymore I feel pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty and gay we have to keep winning we have to win I love it I love that this is what this is a special these were special election to replace guys who had gone into the Trump administration in Georgia Tom Price obviously became the Health and Human Secretary uh Human Services guy and so they had to replace him and they just poured all this money all the Democrats Hollywood California was throwing money at this thing it was the most expensive turned out to be the most expensive race for Congress by like a hundred percent it was like twice as expensive as the last one they were just trying to show that they were trying to show that people hated Trump so much and their hatred of Trump that they've been touting through their media the Democrats have been touting through their mainstream media was just had just destroyed Trump support when this was a place where Trump narrowly won see that was the big thing even though Republican Congressmen have won this place by 20% Newt Gingrich you know and and Tom Price wanted by double-digits Trump only won by one point five percent under two percent and so they thought well this is our chances are chance they went in here is CNN reporting the results all right I don't want to drink you know Democrat tears but they just taste so good I can't help it I can't help it Oh Lord you know I mean this is the thing I mean it just goes it's the same thing over and over and over again they're now been I think four of these special elections they have lost every one of them every one before took place was going to be a referendum on Donald Trump and then afterwards well it didn't mean anything it doesn't show anything you know this is not you know we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves and think this is predictive of 2018 2018 is too far away for anything to be predictive of it one way or the other this is not something this is the midterm elections we don't know what those are going to be like but was this a referendum on Donald Trump you know before we talked about it and before we listen to the experts and before we listen to you know the pundits and all the people talking about what it means let's listen to the voters okay because here is karen handel during her victory speech King Trump who showed up and gave her support on Twitter as well and a special thanks to the President of the United States but let's not forget our equally great vice-president my pen if she hadn't interrupted them to go on to Mike Pence they'd have been charged chanting till today you know they'd have chanted all night Trump Trump Trump and all the reporters on the ground said when they talked to the voters the voter said the hell yes this is about Donald Trump you can't come into our district and start pouring all this money in from outside Hollywood Rosie O'Donnell Jane Fonda this from variety Jane Fonda Jessica Lange Sean Daniel Connie Britton Sam Waterson and Kyra Sedgwick are among those who have donated to Democrat John ah scoffs campaign and I'm sure each and every one of them knows the issues in Georgia really really well no they don't they don't know the issues of America they just know this the way they look in the mirror and how you know wonderful they are for supporting for supporting their left-wing causes Alyssa Milano actually traveled there she's the lady from who is who's the boss I think she was in she actually traveled there and visited voters and all this stuff so Hollywood was all in the media was all in the reactions before we talked about what we think it means the reactions from these left some of them were utterly amazing my fame favorite is from feminists Jill Phillip Povich I guess her name is pronounced she has written a book I can't remember the title of it but she has written a book which apparently claims that the female orgasm is a right that women have a right to an orgasm which should be guaranteed by the government I heard that and I I had I have to admit that I thought to myself well back in the day I have a guaranteed you an orgasm for free but that's such an awful disgusting low thing to say that I would never say that out loud Jill philippic Kovach tweets at what point is this not a failure of democrats but toxic vindictive voters willing to collect hateful bigots it's the voters fault they lost it's the voters it's the deplorable Zitz the deplorable small I know it's more convenient to blame the party for just not convincing people what kind of people vote for candidates like Handel and Trump if this is the way they think they hate you so much that they think it's your fault their candidates lose ah it's it's what I'm telling you they make it so much fun they make it so much fun to beat the mitts it's wonderful you know but but I think really really the guys who have to take a look at themselves are the media the news media I mean this Russia if you had to look back over the first months of the Trump presidency you know I don't have the figures in front of me but it just seems as a guy who follows the news what was the story covered most if you just had a percentage of what story what story what story covered most it's the Trump collusion with Russia it's got to be it has got to be they have pipe this by and by the way I won't make a prediction but it wouldn't surprise me if in the next day or two or even today there's some kind of leak from new leak from the intelligence community new blockbuster things I'm new a tremendous revelation about Trump and Russia that's going to come out that'll Peter away but I'll take this off the front pages because that's the whole point of this stuff is to take you know only you have negative news about Trump but this is rebuke to the media it is a rebuke rebuke to a media that has told this false nonsense story I mean this is a story you know you keep hearing them you know like how do we know that Trump didn't collude with Russia you know for all I know the trunk shot a man in Reno just to watch them die but there's no evidence there is no evidence there never was any evidence it was always a fantasy and they keep playing this fantasy and this is Georgia saying kiss our grits we are not buying into that fantasy it really is a failure of Hollywood a failure of the Democrats and a failure of the mainstream media and we will talk about this more but we're going to and we're going to get to the mailbag but I got to say first I got to say goodbye to Facebook
