1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,950
This is a new airbase
in the Sahara desert.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,260
It’s home to secret drone
operations by the C.I.A.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,390
That’s what American
and Nigerien officials

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,650
have told The Times.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,070
This is that same location
just seven months earlier.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,470
We’re going to show you
two things: How the base grew

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,780
out of a small
commercial airstrip

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,940
and what’s important
about this location.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,030
This image from
January 2018 shows

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,824
a simple airstrip
surrounded by sand.

11
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,490
Here’s what it looked
like to land there

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,730
in a civilian plane

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,060
in August.

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,400
This is the civilian area.
Just eight days later,

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,270
we see that construction
on the drone base has begun.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,750
That construction
moves fast.

17
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,750
A month later,
we see new structures

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,890
and security walls.

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,960
We also see what appear to be
several new defensive positions

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,170
beyond the compound’s walls.

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,770
By September, we see
the base has more capacity.

22
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,500
There’s a second
and bigger taxiway.

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,470
And that taxiway connects
to a new clamshell tent —

24
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,570
probably an aircraft shelter.

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,940
The layout and dimensions
are similar to those

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,100
at known drone bases.

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,350
So where is this,
and why does it matter?

28
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,590
The base is just outside
a town in northeastern Niger.

29
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,790
But here’s a twist:

30
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,820
The U.S. military is
building its own drone base

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,130
just 350 miles away.

32
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,680
It will be there to target
extremists in the region.

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,070
The C.I.A. won’t comment
on why it needs its own base.

34
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,480
It could be
because it’s closer

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,180
to southern Libya, which sees
a lot of extremist activity.

36
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,030
But it could also
reflect how the C.I.A.

37
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,070
is expanding its 
drone operations

38
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,780
under President Trump.

39
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,810
This would run counter
to an Obama-era policy,

40
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,870
one that sought to put the
military, not the C.I.A.,

41
00:01:40,870 --> 00:00:00,000
in charge of drone attacks.
