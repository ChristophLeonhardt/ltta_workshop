alright guys welcome to the classified live a lot to go over today a whole bunch a ton a ton a ton now listen I know that a million people are going to be asking me well I'll say this when we have some more people watching but I really want to talk about this manna fort & Cowan situation very very interesting stuff now I know what's going to happen the chats going to blow up with a million people telling me they want to talk about the illegal alien being held in the murder of Mali Tibbets I know I get it so do i we're gonna do that one tomorrow because there's more hey john zealand how are you there's more information coming in on that case all right we got some details last night we're gonna learn some more details today but really got to go over all the problems with mana 14 Trump's I'm not ignoring the fact that there's an illegal alien being held in the murder of Mali Tibbets in Iowa very important to me I'm going to be getting more information on that later today so I want to do that story with you tomorrow good morning the Spota and hangman John Ruth great see you so yeah we got to talk about this this mount afford and Cohen non together everybody today all the left yeah oh my god Donald Trump is done Donald Trump is done give me a break first of all Matt affords trial means nothing means nothing for Donald Trump means absolutely nothing Paul Manafort was jammed up on old financial crimes going back to 2006 they have nothing to do with Russia collusion and if you look at it in the final analysis Muller couldn't even make more than 50% of his case there were 18 charges the jury hung on 10 of them there was a mistrial on 10 and he was convicted on eight old tax evasion and bank fraud charges going back to the mid 2000s 10 years 10 years a decade before he was ever involved with the Trump campaign there's nothing there with Manta fort now look maybe Manta fort will peel maybe you'll get a pardon I doubt it I doubt it because the evidence seemed pretty clear-cut the government put on all those witnesses but I will tell you this it does not bode well for Robert Muller it does not bode well for the special counsel that he couldn't even make more than 50% of his case in the mana for trial 18 counts only convictions on eight of them now Cohen is a little bit more problematic but not for the reasons you think metaphor it really is a PR nightmare for the president all right Cohen is a PR nightmare for the president but I don't believe a legal and political one and here's why number one I believe Cohen had the worst legal representation and Lanny Davis I mean that was some of the worst lawyer in I've ever seen running cut a plea Ron and cut a plea but not only that Michael Cohen Michael Cohen made it did something that lawyers do every day he engaged in a settlement for his client now we're gonna get very deep today into how I think there's a fix and in the Department of Justice you guys know I tell you every single day I don't believe in conspiracy theories I analyze through the lens of facts not through the lens of emotion not through the lens of partisanship all right but this looks really really dirty let's start with Michael Cohen and Lanny Davis Lanny Davis is out there gloating in the media that his client pled guilty and is facing three to five years in prison and substantial fines and it seems no lawyer does that no lawyer gloats like that and Lanny Davis is gloating the Clinton fixer about now being able to take down Trump and having info for the special counsel it's really unusual but here's the big one here's the really big one are you listening here's the real big one mr. low-key great SIA all right the big one is this Michael Cohen pled guilty to paying stormy Daniels and not disclosing it to the Federal Election Commission thereby breaking campaign finance laws because the payment to stormy Daniels benefited Donald Trump's candidacy and potentially influenced the election however the Department of Justice ignored that Hillary Clinton's law firm Perkins koey paid fusion GPS to conduct work that would influence the outcome of the election and didn't report it to the Federal Election Commission so the Department of Justice literally told America that there is one standard of justice for Hillary Clinton and one for everyone else and mind you it was one payment to stormy Daniels via Michael Cohen Perkins koey sent multiple payments far in excess of one hundred and thirty thousand dollars I believe knowing how this these investigations work and how expensive they are to fusion GPS on behalf of Hillary Clinton crickets from the Department of Justice there's even more there's even more though is even more the payment the stormy Daniels was passive help for the campaign in other words here's stormy here's the money you want don't say anything anybody and hopefully there won't be a scandal it wasn't money spent to directly hurt Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton funneled money through her law firm Perkins koey to hide from the Federal Election Commission to pay fusion GPS to directly hurt Donald Trump and the people around him yet the Department of Justice does absolutely nothing but it gets even worse much much worse do you remember Imran awan the IT guy on the WR Thurmond Schultz scandal you know I'm talking about the Pakistani guy that I believed was under the thumb of the Pakistani ISI one of the most brutal enemy intelligence services in the world well get this get this this story dropped yesterday Imran Owen was found guilty all right a federal bank fraud lying on loan applications to inflate his worth an identical charge to one that Paul Manafort was convicted on an identical charge to one on which Michael Cohen pled guilty Imran Wan got no jail time this was yesterday he got no jail time in fact the Department of Justice didn't ask for jail time Michael Cohen his face at three and a half to five years Paul man afford so far facing about 80 years I tell you every day don't believe in conspiracy theories don't spread craziness but as a former law enforcement guy with a lot of experience in this stuff this all looks incredibly filthy this is incredibly filthy and corrupt Hillary did exactly through Perkins koey what Trump did through Michael Cohen exactly and the Department of Justice turned a blind eye Imran Awan did exactly what Michael Cohen is accused of doing pled guilty to exactly what Paul Manafort was convicted for the Department of Justice asked for no jail time in the Awan case a guy who stole confidential information from about a dozen members of Congress who breached the servers who stole computer equipment there is something filthy here lanny davis a years long Clinton fixer is is Michael Cohen's attorney rushes him into a plea and is gloating is giddy that his client is facing three and a half to five years in jail for something that's done every day in law a settlement but it even gets worse the Obama administration I have it right here ain't the Obama administration was found to have was found to have violated 375 dollars worth of campaign finance reporting laws in 2008 crickets nothing nothing this is filthy the fix I believe is in I believe the fix was in you're watching you are watching unfold before your eyes what I believe was the insurance policy Peter struck and Lisa Paige went to talk about in Andy's Andrew McCabe's office Jeff sessions is useless and I if one more person if one more person comes on this chat stream and says to me Hewitt on trust the plan operation slow Walker I'm gonna call you a moron okay you got duped this cue and on nonsense it never saw all this come and did it Jeff sessions is compromised ineffective and the worst Attorney General in US history there is no plan okay there is no operation slow Walker the deep state is taking out Trump guilt by association on things they're ignoring on the Hillary Clinton and Democrat side that they have ignored on the establishment Republican side they are going after this president with a vengeance you are watching a soft coup d'etat take place before your eyes and a bunch of morons out there still believe short on trust the planned operation slow Walker it's ridiculous you're being duped that whole queue thing was a disinfo campaign by the other side to shut you up that's all it was that's all it was but there is a silver lining in this cloud I think yesterday was a wake-up call for Trump now Trump withstands all this because at the end of the day you don't really have legal exposure if your lawyer screws up and breaks the law Matta for it doesn't touch Trump doesn't touch Trump he's a guy who worked for Trump for a few months ten years after he committed these really benign white-collar rich-guy crimes most Americans don't care if one rich guide the frauds another rich guy and the frauds the federal government but one rich guy the frauds are really rich bank and then doesn't pay taxes to the federal government ten years ago most Americans don't care about that all right and let me read you a list of names now brian Stelter over on CNN tweeted out yesterday claiming that Americans won't care about felons and the president's inner circle seems insulting those Americans so I tweeted back at brian Stelter web hubbell mark rich jim mcdougal Susan mcdougal Stephen Smith those were all very close friends of Bill Clinton who all got jammed up on felonies yet despite that and these were like before his inner inner inner circle despite that in the 1996 election after all those scandals if they're all those people close to Clinton we're all kinds of jammed up despite that Bill Clinton blew Bob Dole out of the water 379 electoral votes to Clinton 159 to Bob Dole Americans don't care about high-level financial crimes this Michael Cohen thing oh it's gonna turn his Trump gonna tarnish rep now it's not look at the end of the day Michael Cohen Michael Cohen was weak Michael Cohen was a really terrible lawyer apparently what a horrible attorney I mean just nuts and lanny davis doesn't appear gave them great representation now a lot of things are going to happen now Trump realizes the fix is in I don't think God himself could make Trump sit down with robert muller at this point Trump would be insane Trump would be insane now Gus Pulido this is a dumb comment with all due respect they want you divided trust sessions trust kill trust sessions for what doing nothing while everyone around the president gets indicted I mean it's just stupid at this point it's a waste of time to put it on the chat it really is it really is it just makes people dumber so Trump like I said God himself couldn't make Trump speak to Muller I believe that Donald Trump right now is saying whoa well they really are trying to take me out here this is a soft COO they want to end my presidency and he's getting real I think you realize that sessions is useless and I think he realizes that he did nothing wrong a guy who's done something wrong doesn't tell the White House Counsel like we talked about yesterday to go sit down with the special accounts of 30 hours a guy who didn't do anything wrong when they raided his personal lawyer's office doesn't go in two years long court battles claiming executive privilege and attorney-client privilege on everything with his name on it Trump didn't do that he didn't do that so all we have is a loose admission or allocution by Michael Cohen that says yeah I coordinated the payment with candidate Trump he directed me to do it at the end of the day when you cut through all the histrionics when you cut through all the the drama on the left and the wishful thinking so what today starting now really on East Coast clients are going to be directing their attorneys to make settlement payments they're going to be cooperating on how that payment is made maybe they're sending the money in advance maybe they're saying use my abc123 LLC don't do it personally or legal all perfectly legal you see this is what people are misunderstanding nobody is saying that the payment the stormy Daniels in and of itself was illegal it's a bribe this is where everybody's being confused they're saying that it benefited the campaign was in essence a campaign donation by Michael Cohen who the Trump campaign understand that they're not even alleging that it was Trump's money used that was used they're saying that Michael Cohen used his money gave her a hundred and thirty grand it benefited the campaign it was thereby a donation to the campaign and it exceeded the twenty seven hundred dollar per cycle limit that's it that is literally all the guys being charged with now if you listen to the left you would think he was being charged with he was being charged with you know bribery and corruption and he was laundering drug money for Trump from the Sinaloa cartel no no all he's being charged with is a violation of the twenty seven hundred dollar max and not reporting any of it to the FEC which many lawyers say he didn't have to in that Lanny Davis completely dropped the ball here because he was more interested in taking down Trump then he was defending his client that's it that's it mr. white to burr says Millennials don't care about this I don't care what Millennials care about this is important and I beg to differ many Millennials do because I've been interfacing with them on Twitter last night at all day today all day today so I have to beg to differ you're dead wrong not every millennial wants to talk about the same over and over again Facebook banning Twitter banning free speech free speech we do it every day it's over done it's over done this is critically important stuff we're talking about a soft coup on the presidency of the United States of America now Donald Trump will not face any criminal charges despite the wishful thinking of the Washington Post in The New York Times and CNN and MSNBC not gonna happen Donald Trump is gonna take a PR hit for this he is it's gonna take a big PR hit for this what Cohen said in court looks really bad again it looks really bad at the end of the day legally and politically it's a big mess mess that's what it is because there is nothing illegal there is nothing remotely illegal about a client saying to a lawyer settle this out for me settle it out for me and furthermore if Donald Trump had said to Michael Cohen hey Mike I want you to settle this I want you to pay it let's keep this off the books with the FEC let's keep this off the books with the IRS it was Michael Cohen's job as the lawyer the Turner was crying and say Donald can't do that that's illegal I'd violate my law license can't do it go get another lawyer if you want that done but you just notified me of a crime you're about to commit Cohen didn't do that Cohen's like yep Kendu no worries telling his client who isn't a lawyer no nothing wrong with that everything's okay sorry Cohen is the guy who effed up here so all of those who want to take Trump down called Cohen's the guy who screwed up he was the attorney was his job to say the way you want to do this is improper but I don't believe Trump told him to do it that way I believe Cohen trying to strengthen his relationship with Trump because everything I've seen leads me to believe that Michael Cohen is not a particularly smart guy I think it's kind of a functional moron quite honestly I think he's a moron so either he was too stupid to realize that what he was doing was illegal or he decided to do something and cut you know cut corners and skirt around the law to like impress his client but screwing him any way you slice it Cohen was the lawyer it was on him to say this is legal this isn't this I can do this I can but didn't do that he didn't do that if my lawyer tomorrow goes out and does something about if I have a civil lawsuit and my lawyer because that him breaks the law on my behalf and I'm 2,000 miles away in a meeting his Trump was a few thousand miles away campaigning I don't know what my lawyers doing I'm not criminally liable because my lawyer who's supposed to tell me what's legal went out there and violated a statute he'll I rely on him to tell me if statutory violation he doesn't rely on me so the end of the day politically and legally Trump should be fine should be absolutely fine but it underscores the bigger issue that I spoke about earlier in the show and I spoke about much earlier in the show Hillary Clinton's team did exactly the same thing Obama's team did exactly the same thing in Rana Hwan did exactly the same thing with regards to the bank fraud the inflation of value charges lying on loan applications exactly the same thing none were either prosecuted or even jail time recommended how do you not look at this and say there's a fix in how how do I don't care which side of the aisle you're on the Constitution is at stake now Jimmy B here says Lanny Davis's Cohen's lawyer that's all I need to know that this whole thing is shady mmm-hmm look it certainly looks that way certainly looks that way the former head of the FEC was on Mark Levin show and he said this isn't even illegal it's not even a campaign finance violation I've spoken to former prosecutors defense attorneys FBI agents I know they're all shaking their heads they're like 130,000 dollars that's something you pay a fine for what they are going after going on is something you pay a little fine for this is ridiculous ridiculous hangman John Ruth asks me John do you think the tables will turn after this crap and go after all the people I mentioned this morning no I don't I think Trump is getting terrible advice from people around him telling him become you can't intervene it's gonna look worse Jeff Sessions is the worst the most ineffective weakest most pathetic Attorney General in the history of the United States and what I just said before we froze is Jeff Sessions is the worst the weakest most pathetic most ineffective Attorney General in the history of the United States he never should have been appointed his ass should be kicked out the door this morning kicked out the door this morning for refusing to go after Hillary Clinton and her people for the same crime for allowing one of his assistant US attorneys to recommend no jail time on em Ron Owen it is an epic epic disgrace a disgrace Jeff Sessions is an embarrassment he's a stain on the Department of Justice a weak little man who never should have accepted this gigantic job he was never cut out for it he's not the guy he is not the guy now what runt needs to do is realize that as the president United States he has tremendous constitutional authority over law enforcement Donald Trump should be appointing a second special counsel now like as we sit here now he should be appointing a second special counsel he should announce that that's gonna be somebody very close to him very very close to him and he should announce they're gonna look into every crime potentially committed by Hillary Clinton and every member of her team every single one and then he should sit with an army of lawyers and figure out how to void every immunity deal that was given to the members of Hillary's team because unless he does that unless he threatens to bring them all down they're going to keep coming they're not gonna stop coming for him he's getting terrible advice I don't know if it's from White House Counsel Don McGann I don't know if it's from general Kelly I don't know if it's from Rudy Giuliani I don't know if it's from Jay Sekulow I suspect it's not the latter two but he is getting very very bad advice from somewhere maybe it's jarred enough anka I don't know but somebody is telling Trump to take off his gloves lay down and not punch back he's absorbing punch after punch after punch he's got to start punching back if he doesn't start punching back he's done his presidency is over it's over because they're not gonna stop coming next they're gonna come for his family they're gonna keep coming until they put so much pressure on him he's gonna say enough I'm out I resign that's what they want Muller will not stop he will not stop what Trump should do is pardon everybody he should pardon Cohen he should pardon mana for it just a thumb it in their eye and appoint a second special counsel and then a third appoint a second and look in the team Hillary and appoint a third to look into Muller Bruce or Peter Strock James call me Andrew McCabe scare the hell out of them oh my god if somebody says what about the 45,000 sealed indictments again my head's good there are not 40,000 sealed indictments the morons telling you that don't even know what they're looking at not even going to say anything about it not even going to say anything about it please those those are cases around the country they've got nothing to do with Hillary & Company nothing talked about it yesterday many of those things aren't even indictments they're their witness statements their statements from under cover of federal agents undercover cops the people that are talking about that don't understand how to read the federal docket they don't understand it those things aren't even indictments most of them now people are asking about Steve banning and Steve banning is he's getting himself back in the game but you know Bannon really screwed up he screwed up we're talking about Michael Wolff guy he screwed up and salting the president his family so I don't know if Bannon will ever be led back in the inner circle I don't know if he will and you know back to what I was saying though George Watts asks do I think Jeff Sessions is the leftist show No I think Jeff Sessions is an old deep stater and when Jeff Sessions got there he wasn't Michael Horrigan Judicial Watch never said there were 40,000 sealed indictments never said that they talked about a much smaller amount Judicial Watch has never once said tom Fitton has never said there are 40,000 sealed indictments in fact Judicial Watch calls out Jeff Sessions DOJ and FBI daily so with all due respect you're very wrong about that very wrong about that mm-hmm we have no frontal says there's a rather pessimistic view on things yeah things are pessimistic right now let's face it they're coming for Trump the other side had big wins yesterday Trump better get tough now those winds are Pemper arey those aren't knockout punches their jabs on the chin they sting Trump was stung yesterday he wasn't hurt but he better start punching back better start punching back it's time to start nuking the other side start Newcombe this is now at a point where it's we're approaching a point of no return we're approaching the tipping point in a very very big way in a very very big way and to reiterate hangman genres nailed that Trump is surrounded by too many old-school deep State people yeah he is he is Jeff Sessions the lead among them general Kelley good man honorable man but believes in the status quo believes that Herald Brad Dourif as me Howard these wins for the left Trump's former campaign manager and his personal attorney are guilty on 16 combined counts and his former attorney Michael Cohen said in court that Trump conspired to break the law it's not true it'll be beaten but if we are not honest about yesterday being a win for the left we're lying to ourselves we're lying around lying to you I don't paint rosy pictures right I do do this through the lens lens of strength Julian PE says it's amazing how deeply the rot can get in so few years I have 42 years in law enforcement it's embarrassing to see law enforcement go this low on a federal level yeah man isn't it 42 years thanks for your service yeah it's terrible I couldn't agree more it's disgusting brother really really disgusting disgusting now what Trump needs to do what he needs to do it start cleaning house in addition appointing special councils and all that clearly clearly there's a problem around him clearly again he's got bill shine in the White House the former number two at Fox News and I suspect that all last night and beginning again at about 4:30 5:00 this morning shine in the comms team Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the rest of the crew Hogan Gidley and everybody else they were huddled up figuring out the messaging to push back on this and I suspect it'll be effective it's gonna involve a lot of mana for it's a great guy and it was a witch hunt and Michael Cohen is a rat who is lying and what Trump should really do is say yeah I told Michael Cohen to pay her absolutely I didn't told him break the law yeah we discussed the payment it's on tape yes I told them to settle it out to make it go away it was cheaper than a lawsuit I absolutely 100% did all that absolutely did all that it appears that Mike was a moron who did it in an illegal fashion I don't know anything about that he's my lawyer I relied on him to be to do it legally that's what I hope to see Donald Trump knew that would be the intelligent thing to do hell yeah hell yeah I told him to do it Gale says Trump's gonna be doing a Fox News interview this morning yeah yeah it's gonna be a friendly interview and it dill shines old stomping ground and those are all his people and so I suspect I suspect he's gonna basically say yeah I discussed this with him and you know I didn't tell him to do anything illegal I mean if I were advising him on strategic comms and I do that for candidates and I'm pretty damn good at it actually like the candidates I've worked with in the past donut scandals only get in front of it leave them nowhere to go yeah did you discuss this with Michael Cohen absolutely numerous times oh did you tell him to make the payment uh-huh two or three times actually did you coordinate with him about 100 percent absolutely did you know he was breaking the law absolutely not he's my lawyer don't you assume if you're talking to your lawyer and you discuss the settlement payment they're gonna do it in a legally compliant manner man was that I hire the wrong lawyer this guy was an idiot he went broke the law I've been in business 45 years this man from Donald Trump I've had I can't remember how many settlements have been how many deals directing my lawyers to make payments never once had this problem my lawyers always did their job in that illegally this moron decided to do this in a way that got him all jammed up that's his problem not mine and the story only get in front of it blame it on the lawyer it's a pretty simple strategy actually it's a pretty simple strategy hey my buddy Jared chambers is on what's up brother yeah so Jared says this is perfect advice but who keeps telling Trump to reject this kind of advice about dealing with Muller it's a lone area of repeated missteps Jared man that is the question right you and I we we discussed this offline we've talked about it on Twitter publicly that is the question I love that you put who capital WH o and one quick sidenote everybody you see right here Jared chambers check them out on Twitter reason being don't only rely on verified accounts there is a wealth a wealth of really good content out there with people that are coming up in this game as political analysts Jared's one of those people strongly suggest you guys find him on Twitter and I forget his Twitter hand it's like at what is it Jared at something CEO right ping it in there and I'll shout it out mm-hmm Gail scuse me Gail Katherine says but wasn't it Cohen's tapes that started this and why would Cowan tape Trump well that's the question right and yeah the tape started it but I don't hear anything illegal on that tape let me let me say one thing I love my country can't you tell I'm a constitutionalist I'm a law-and-order guy if I thought Trump was breaking the law Jared chambers his uh Twitter handle is at sea like charlie number four CEO but really good political analysis coming at a Jarrett lately don't only look to the verified accounts trust me on this so uh you know on that tape I'm alone word a guy right I believe in law and order I believe in doing things right I hear a lawyer and a client having a conversation I've had those conversations with my attorneys over the years business matters I had a weird guy come out of the woodwork and yeah until you guys funny serving on my radio show I called the guy a wannabe cop and he sued me for laia for slander and defamation he was a private eye I called him I want to be calm he sued me for a slander and defamation and we did what was called an anti slap motion he was in California we did an anti slap motion in LA which basically means that if I could prove that I was telling the truth or I could prove that what I said wasn't defamatory and slanderous he would have to pay my legal fees and pay me well get this the day before I said it The Moron was arrested by the FBI for impersonating an FBI agent all right now I had a hundred conversations what hundred dozen conversations with attorneys about that could they have been taped sure I mean I have you know in this business you get into these dumb lawsuits but talking to your attorney about scenarios talking to your attorneys about scenarios I don't illegal it's not illegal and that's you know that's a really sad consequence of all this mmm they're trying to criminalize normal legal commonplace lawyer-client interactions that's very dangerous they're trying to criminalize settlements deals I mean this is bizarre stuff this is like we're through the looking-glass bizarre stuff really bizarre all right a lawyer settling for his client but going back to what I said earlier in the show because about a hundred more people around now what's really really dirty and all of this what's filthy in all of this I'll go back through it Michael Cohen pleads guilty to campaign finance law violations he paid stormy Daniels the allegation is the payment the stormy Daniels shut her up thereby benefiting the Trump campaign and thereby potentially influencing the election in doing so the government is saying Michael Cohen made one hundred and thirty thousand dollar donation to the Trump campaign a that would be illegal because the limit for a donation per cycle the primary than the general is twenty seven hundred purse of fifty four hundred total so he exceeded that in addition the donation was not reported to the Federal Election Commission all right Michael Cohen pleads guilty however Perkins koey Hillary Clinton's law firm pays fusion gps to influence the election on behalf of Hillary by digging dirt on Trump we know what else happened the FISA warrant all the other crazy hurricane of filth all right they've hit a lot more than 130 grand I suspect because I've seen some of what fusion GPS charges they don't report it as a donation at the Clinton campaign and of course it exceeds the twenty $700 per cycle limit Michael Cohen is prosecuted and pleads guilty Perkins Co he gets a walk DOJ closes their eyes turns their backs puts their hands over their ears and mouth alright think the fix might be in but wait there's more the Obama campaign the Obama campaign was fined for campaign finance violations totaling three hundred and seventy five thousand dollars in two thousand eight mmm nobody went to jail nobody went to jail but wait it gets worse there's more hmm for those of you who aren't watching earlier remember debbie Wasserman Schultz's IT staff or umrah no on the guy the Pakistani guy who stole all that information breached data systems with members of Congress hmm bet no voice I'm fired up Imran Oh on yesterday after being found guilty on bank fraud charges lying on loan applications exactly the same charge for which manna fort was found guilty by a jury and on which Michael Cohen pled guilty Matt afford face eighty years in jail Michael Cohen three to five years the Department of Justice asked for no jail time for Imran Owen and the judge granted it and do you know why the judge granted it because she said Trump's statements about Imran Awan more than potentially defaming and might have influenced people are you effing kidding me how are Americans not to think the fix is in Hilary's team Democrat IT staffers walk they walk for the identical actions and crimes people would on Trump or going to prison for years and the prosecution's keep going now again now again if you think Jeff Sessions is anything other than this like this actually serves a purpose it hydrates me I don't know here plan a tool if you mean Jeff Sessions is anything other than a tool Deadwood that's just sessions all right that's Jeff Sessions because where the hell was he when his assistant US attorney was giving him Rana wanna walk where was he to stop this nonsense trust sessions trust the plan give me a proper Asian slow Walker that's morons out there please Jesus Mary and Joseph I got to do it again cuz I liked it Jeff Sessions is a tool he's got about as much personality and he's about as useful as I really like doing that that's a lot of fun oh look I popped the key off my keyboard I got so excited this is really cool I'm about to do a whole show and he throwing tools around calling Jeff Sessions a tool but you but you get the point you get the point all right look you can see this is annoying me you can see this is annoying me but again but again I think this all stings Trump I don't think this hurts drop because just to recap for people that weren't watching earlier no Jimmy B that wasn't in any kit was the G K but it's fine I popped it back in I look Trump has no exposure here with manna fort old twelve-year-old crimes had nothing to do with the campaign or collusion he was convicted on stuff that went down ten years before the election ten years before he served a few months on the campaign and with Cohen we've been talking about it he was a lawyer nothing Trump did was illegal so very very bad PR day for Trump very bad but in the end I don't think legally or politically devastating all right let's read some comments here Ouroboros no another good account I'm gonna start I'm going to start giving special mention to some of the accounts who stand out to me with really good commentary or questions like I did with my buddy Jared chambers and and I've noticed that Ouroboros null here has made some really interesting comments posited some really good questions over the last week so I'm gonna start you know giving special mention to these people I think too many of you rely only on verified accounts don't I one that I started in this world years back I didn't have a verified account I had 200 Twitter followers and luckily people were hearing me and listening to me and I was able to grow my brand that way and got a radio show and so I want to start helping people out and given people the same push same boost that people gave to me so like I did for my buddy Jared chambers ouroboros Mel here another good one a lot of good comments lately says legal experts a split half say this is a campaign payment in kind other half saying not if the NDA was paid with personal funds which is why Cohen's guilty plea was clearly coerced see yes it's very confusing and and one thing is for certain lanny davis my opinion did not give michael cohen robust legal representation robust legal representation it appears he rushed him into court to take this plea cuz lanny davis was like salivating to take down trusts like Scrooge McDuck on a pile of gold coins but yeah I'm gonna take down Donald Trump and get my gold I mean a crazy little leprechaun in that movie I mean what was this it's all really weird it's all really weird dark and a-list bada says I've turned into Billy Mays but wait there's more poor Billy Mays he died guy partied too hard all right Julian P says what the money Trump has why would he have to donate there at forty hundred thirty thousand he could've easily funded his own campaign larger than that calling a duck a pigeon doesn't make it a pigeon exactly look I think Cohen has done a lot of business with Trump and Cohen was trying to say to Trump I'll pay it just I'll bill you down the road so I'm trying to say they're making much ado about nothing it's much ado about nothing let's see Nick at night says how do I know the difference from a verified and not a verified account and if and if you recommend one can you list it well on Twitter a verified account is the blue checkmark an unverified count doesn't but there is a tremendous wealth of content really good content analysis on these non verified accounts I'm gonna start pushing them out you know yes James Avery sessions should be thrown out of trumps toolbox I drop it one more time just a Jeff Sessions sake alright cool done did it I might do that every day let's see what else do we got here what else as Trump gonna mention poor Molly again on Fox News Nigel said I'm gonna be talking all about the mountain life easy for me to say the Molly Tibbets case tomorrow all right I wanted to get more information on I'm gonna get a little more today as you know an illegal alien a guy named Christian or Christian Rivera's being held in our disappearance he's here illegally gonna absolutely talk about it but this Muller a Cohen news is big and it's settled Molly Tibbets little more info is gonna trickle out today so better to bring ya better to bring you the more accurate information alright let's see let's see what else we got here Trin oculus says why is Davis representing mana 40 was a Clinton guy Davis is not representing mana for it he was representing Michael Cohen not Paul Manafort sessions got a G job because he was banned from Keebler Elf tree because he played with the cookies too much hangman John Ruth yeah man he does look like the Keebler Elf you know what also fascinates me about Jeff Sessions I want you to think about this for a second you see Jeff Sessions everybody goes oh he's an old guy oh he's an old man poor old guy leave Jeff Sessions alone he's a poor old guy Jeff Sessions is one year younger than Donald Trump you believe that session 71 Donald Trump seventy two sessions looks like his dad one year younger yeah Tommy Tommy Vercetti I'm gonna try to help you out here man my mother-in-law is a liberal and hates Trump I don't want her to win Trump that's pretty good Trump can't go down we're gonna do all we can to help you fight back against your liberal mother-in-law we're gonna do all we can mm-hmm Eric Dondero I Molly Tibbets was a liberal she held a sign up on Twitter don't date white boys number one I don't believe that cuz her boyfriend was the whitest kid in the world number two I couldn't care less that is kind of ridiculous I couldn't care less this poor girl got murdered by a savage a twenty year old kid I don't care if she held a sign up saying screw every conservative I couldn't care less poor kid is a victim who probably died a savage horrible death comments like that serve no purpose man come on you're better than that you're a smart guy mm-hmm Gale Cobb conference says why a session though he's happy now to worry on his face but he's part of the deep state I don't think he cares I think he checked out I think he checked out Harry Bo Roberts I agree with you my friend if Trump does not get them they're gonna finish him he has to finish them yes he does tommy vercetti do I like dr. Michael Savage haven't listened to him in years I like when he goes off on his rants but I honestly haven't listened to him in years and it's not that against him I don't listen to everybody I don't said anybody really you want to know why I do this show for an hour every day I prep it then I do a three-hour live television show on a cable network man by the time I'm done after researching and getting breaking news and and bringing the tea all day the last thing I want to do is listen to radio or watch news on TV i watch things like Deadliest Catch and forged in fire and stuff that has nothing to do with any of this so yeah so I don't really know what Michael Savage and a lot of these people have been up to you today but I don't I don't really watch news and I get it on Twitter in real time if I need it mm-hmm do I think you'll be revealed as a hero in a trump rally one day no I think Q is going to be revealed as a fake that's a moronic fake who do a lot of people tommy vercetti heard from a time traveller the trumple have a heart attack exactly yeah yeah I know all these times they accuse a time traveler and that other weird guy bill Mitchell's a time traveler oh my god these people oh my god so ridiculous let's see Sophie Krabs says Deadliest Catch I love Deadliest Catch what's wrong with Deadliest Catch very upset though I think they should boot the northwestern off the show Edgar Hansen on the northwestern accused of molesting a 16 year old girl mm-hmm so gonna have problems with that next season I suspect yep an LG HTN donated five bucks one day after they find the killer is it that straightforward sometimes I just question how fast they found out who the killer was if you mean Molly Tibbets wasn't fast kids been missing for five weeks it was an investigation involving local police State Police FBI investigators from the region wasn't a fast apprehension wasn't a fast apprehension at all 79th husband says where is the Russia collusion pure BS it is pure BS George Ellis said Nick at night says George Ellis at squeezing people such as Cohen gets people to flip compose and so on yeah but gotta have something to flip on I mean it's gonna be very difficult for the government to squeeze a lawyer on their client that is going to set a chilling chilling chilling horrible precedent a precedent the United States of America don't need don't need look in the Molly Tibbets case that I'll be getting more into tomorrow I think the police did an outstanding job maybe talking about the male Tippit's case and that a watch case in Colorado the terrible case where the guy apparently murdered his wife and two young daughters I think in each of those cases the police are doing an exceptional investigative job exceptional Chris Jake you and on is not for real q and on is fake and anybody who believes that is being duped and I'll say it over and over again absolutely fake nonsense hmm let's see let's see poor Elon Musk feel bad for a moment following them I think a lot of what he lamas does is theatrical been working for him this is a good comment Adam Troy s-says Muller did nothing different than the typical low-paying auditor from the IRS exactly twenty five million dollars from Muller to do what a non-law enforcement IRS accountant could have done undying a non-law enforcement accountant could have done so ridiculous so ridiculous yeah I mean well guys if you believe in QED you're gonna be let down there's a lot lot coming out on that Zach said I need your opinion on something two teenagers assisted an elderly man and pushed them over with no context in video and the boys addresses were posted online do I agree with it back buddy I'm not going to comment on it cuz I don't know the case mm-hmm I don't know the case I didn't see the video I don't know the case I don't know anything about it so I'm gonna stick off that one my friend let's see let's see yeah I think the investigators did a great great job hmm 79 Tasman says the corrupt justice system is run by the Democrat puppets is a two-tier justice system in this country and yesterday was proof of it I could not agree more tell you everyday I don't buy into conspiracy nonsense but yesterday sure made it seem like there is a two-tier system of justice in the United States of America it sure as hell did it sure as hell did it is very very disturbing it is very very very disturbing I am I'm really upset about it I got to be honest with you never thought I would see a time when our country would be in such crisis really didn't never thought I'd see a time where where our criminal justice system would be so overtly biased and compromised where you know we we we would say it sort of tongue-in-cheek but half meaning it I would say it here on the show on my other shows there are three standards of justice I it we said right one for the elite well let me start at the bottom one for us one for the elite and one for the Clintons yesterday we saw it at work yesterday we saw it at work in Rhonda Wan hung out with Wasserman Schultz and the elites he walks no charges Michael Cohen and Trump a guy mana for it they're charged for exactly the same crimes that do in jail time Hillary hasn't even been touched and LG HTN donation thanks brother how do we get sessions out of office president needs to ask for his resignation or firearm it's very simple very very simple and it's exactly what should happen exactly what should happen and hold your comments on Molly Tibbits for tomorrow really going to go in deep on that case and on the Watts case in Colorado really going to do it now there is a Tom Kha that's a really good question who to replace sessions that's the problem right that's the problem right now you wouldn't get a replacement through Supreme Court confirmation number one and number two who would you pick who would you pick Trump's got to pick somebody from outside DOJ somebody very loyal to him somebody loyal to the country not loyal to the deep state that's what he's got do so Tomcat you pose the problem poopsie the end Walker I think I just answered your question as well why is in Trump asked for sessions resignation who's he gonna replace him with it's gonna be a fight it's gonna be a battle you also gotta remember sessions within the Senate for a long time Trump has to get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court last thing he wants to do now is piss off buddies obsessions in the US Senate by firing we know sessions is useless so let's at least get Kavanaugh confirmed get through the midterms then clean house it's frustrating I know I want it done today but I also understand that we also got to be smart here we also got to be smart Gabriel Swift says Jim Jordan tippy bear I don't know Jim Jordans a lawyer Tibbie mayor says trey Gowdy new who gaudy is all bark and no bite Gaudi is total deep state Michelle a Chiquita says Larry Clayman wants I know Larry Larry's a friend listen Larry one second special counsel Larry will never be nominated to be Attorney General of the United States nor second special counsel but I really like Larry great guy really good guy really smart lawyer but he'll be on the outside rudy guiliani possibly possibly John Zeeland says Muller's team of 17 angry Dems are making the taxpayer milking the taxpayers for every cent they can by throwing crap at the wall and seeing what sticks yeah yeah they are there bill now if you look at it was what it was monthly all right newbee grunt 11 bills about 25 million Newby grunt 11 says the floor at AG Pam Bondi she's my pic unbiased I'm down here in Florida Pam and I have some very close mutual friends I'm a Pam fan I'd like to see that if not as AG a second Special Counsel but my vote Pam Bondi for attorney general of the u.s. called me all over it outer boroughs Nels is the besties dearie he heard from me was when he said mmm POTUS should restructure the inspector general's office out of DOJ indirectly reporting to him yeah look and this is why you can't miss get yourself right so make the an independent presidential appointment lateral to the Attorney General cabinet-level okay like a director of Homeland Security Secretary of Homeland Security type thing secretary of inspections secretary of internal inspections they handle all government corruption and then they work with the IGS the offices of Professional Responsibility the inspections divisions of the various federal agencies because currently the way the IG is set up under neo J what a lot of people don't know is the BOPE of what they do about 80% of what the IG does is investigating claims of abuse and corruption against federal prison guards they're really not equipped to do these high-level investigations and so there's a lot people don't know I'm gonna do a show on that a lot of the misconceptions about federal agencies and we'll be talking about I'm Rossa later in the week as well I want to see what insanity she has coming guys this hour flew by love you love being with you every morning gonna be back with you tomorrow morning 7:30 a.m. Eastern tuning we had a really nice turnout today I'd love
