PRESIDENT SAID THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM WITH WHAT HE CALLED THE EROSION COLLUSION HOAX. MARTHA? Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JOINING ME NOW IS MARK PENN. FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU HEARD FROM ADAM SCHIFF. DEMOCRATS CLEARLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A MAJOR ISSUE HERE WITH RUSSIA. BUT YOU FEEL, BASED ON WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR, THAT THESE ARE WHAT YOU CALL IN YOUR PIECE FRUITS OF A POISONOUS TREE. EXPLAIN. WELL, LOOK, I SPENT A YEAR FIGHTING KEN STARR AND I THINK ANY REASONABLE PERSON LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED HERE SAYS THIS INVESTIGATION HAD NO FOUNDATION AND WHATEVER FOUNDATION IT HAD WAS NOT ONLY WRONG BUT CORRUPT. I THINK CHRISTOPHER STEELE WAS PART OF THE FBI WHEN HE LEAKED, LIED, AND THEN WAS FIRED. PAGE AND STRZOK ARE CLEARLY BIASED. THE HEAD OF THE FBI WAS CLEARLY BIASED. THE HEAD OF THE CIA APPEARED TO BE DOING ILLEGAL LEAKS AS WELL. THIS WHOLE THING WAS CORRUPT. THERE IS A DOCTRINE CALLED THE FRUITS OF THE POISONOUS TREE, THAT SAYS WHEN INVESTIGATIONS GET STARTED LIKE, THIS WHEN SEARCHES AND SEIZURES ARE DONE ON THIS BASIS, THEY SHOULD BE THROWN OUT. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO STOP THIS THING BECAUSE, OTHERWISE, WE ARE GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD WASTE ANOTHER YEAR HERE. Martha: SO, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MANY POINTS TO WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE ORIGINS OF THIS, IF THEY DON'T SEE IT IN THE CARTER PAGE CATEGORY. THEY SEE IT IN THE DISCUSSION THAT PAPADOPOULOS HAD YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S A TENUOUS LIMB TO HANG THIS FRUIT ON, SO TO SPEAK? LOOK, DEVIN NUNES SAYS THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. IS HE NOW LOOKING AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THAT SUGGESTS WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS THAT ONE OF HILLARY'S AIDES, WHO I KNOW WELL, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION THIS. PASSED THIS ONTO THE STATE DEPARTMENT FROM AN AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMAT WHO HELPED FUND THE 25-MILLION-DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. WHO IS REPORTING A CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD ABOUT A CONVERSATION THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAD WHO PROFESSOR WHO THEN HAD IT SUPPOSED WHETHER I RUSSIAN AGENTS WHICH SHOWED NO COLLUSION IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOW, WHAT NONSENSE IS IT TO START THE WORLD'S MOST SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATION WITH AWFUL THE RESOURCES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY ON THE BASIS OF ITS LUDICROUS. Martha: SO YOU CLEARLY THINK IT'S VALID AND IT'S THE UNDERPINNING OF THIS QUESTION, BRET BAIER ASKED THIS LAST NIGHT TO JAMES COMEY. YOU KNOW, WERE YOU INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHO WAS FUNDING THIS RESEARCH, THIS OPPO RESEARCH? HE SAID NOT REALLY. DID THAT STRIKE YOU AS ODD, MARK? WELL, CONSIDERING IN A PREVIOUS INTERVIEW HE SAID THAT HE, I THOUGHT HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT IT WAS FUNDED BY THE DNC AND HILLARY. IMPLYING WHEN HE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION, THAT HE KNEW IT. I THINK WHEN HE GOT TO THE BRET BAIER INTERVIEW HE WAS GIVING REALLY DUCKING THE QUESTIONS AND GIVING HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS PAID FOR TO THIS DAY. THAT JUST WAS NOT TRUE. IF IT WAS TRUE. HOW KEY HAVE USED THIS INFORMATION TO LAUNCH THIS INVESTIGATION IT'S PREPOSTEROUS. HERE IS HE OUT MAKING MILLION DOLLARS OF DOLLARS OFF A BOOK. OFF A FEW MEETINGS. I MET WITH THE CLINTONS 400 TIMES. I NEVER WROTE A BOOK LIKE THIS. IT'S LUDICROUS AND PROFITEERING. WHO KNOWS THE VALIDITY OF THESE STORIES. Martha: HAVE YOU INTERESTING TACTIC THAT THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD INITIATE. AND THAT IS TO SAY THAT THIS INVESTIGATION IS TAINTED AND TO TAKE THAT TO COURT. YEAH. I THINK THEY ARE ON PURE DEFENSE AND THEY NEED SOME OFFENSE. AND THEY CAN'T FIRE MUELLER, NEARLY 70% OF THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT SAY DON'T FIRE THEM. BUT THEY DO BELIEVE THERE WAS BIAS. I THINK THEY SHOULD GO PROVE SAY THERE IS BIAS. THIS INVESTIGATION HAS TO BE THROWN OUT U AND THEY SHOULD
