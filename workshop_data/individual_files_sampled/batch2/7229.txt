a group of Republicans in Colorado is facing quite a bit of controversy and criticism following a tweet that clearly stated that they despise poor people now this is the Alamosa County GOP and on their Twitter account this appeared over the weekend out of self-respect B Republican Democrats love poor people because they think that poor people will vote Democrat Republicans hate poor people because they think the dignity of man is above being poor so under the logic and reasoning of whoever that person was and they haven't identified who it was you become poor because you have no dignity poor people have no dignity well they got so much backlash that they decided to issue an apology an apology and that apology essentially said that no look this person has offered to resign and we have accepted this person's resignation but they weren't referring to poor people the regrettable post was made with the intention of condemning poverty not persons affected by poverty and was not meant to insult anyone let's go back to the original tweet okay it said and I'm quoting it Republicans hate poor people because they think dignity of man is above being poor okay yeah so look I think that this just reinforced what we already knew about not all the Republicans in the country but a sizable portion they don't respect you if you're poor they think less of you because you're poor they think you have no dignity if you are struggling to provide for your family and put food on the table and guess what that is the majority of us if you look at the statistics the vast majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck so let's go to those numbers currently the richest 1% hold about 38% of all privately held wealth in the US while the bottom 90% helped 73% of all debt the richest 1% in the u.s. now own more wealth than the bottom 90% 78% of Americans who work full-time these are full-time employee boys are living paycheck to paycheck 71% of them are in debt and 56% of us can barely save $100 per month these are full-time employees these are not people who lack dignity these are not people who are sitting around twiddling their thumbs these are people who are working hard day in day out oftentimes with two jobs three jobs and they still can't put food on the table for their kids because wages have been stagnant since the 1970s so when a person is born poor I guess they lacked dignity because you start out in a certain socio-economic class and there's nothing you could do about it and they're your chance of climbing out of that hole are much much much lower than a rich person being born in ice economic class so at least acknowledging that fact would be helpful I mean I'm getting past the he hates poor people I'm glad at least some Republican admitted it and they admitted in their policies I know but but our media you know you think because they from time to time point out the absurdity of Donald Trump and their and I'll get battle Twitter battle with Donald Trump they're you know doing their job no they they take the Republicans seriously and they go oh well they pass a tax plan and they think it's tax reform and I saw one anchor asks hey the corporate tax loopholes you were supposed to get rid of him did you ever get rid of any of them and a Republican was like uh-uh uh-uh and he couldn't name a single one one anchor did the rest of them say no this is done for on behalf of the rich who are the donors the donors literally said you will give us this otherwise we will stop funding you know they don't mention it they mention it as like all the Republicans think this is gonna help the economy no they don't no they don't they did it in Kansas it devastated the economy of Kansas they've been doing it for decades here it devastated our economy and our wages and that's why we're in the hole that we're in now the Republicans aren't honest actors they don't actually think it's gonna help there me there for the rich and they hate the poor but they wants this guy at least says it and the anchors won't report it that's all of em we're having a policy debate we did supply-side economics for 4050 years we've got giant deficits we've got wages that have been stagnating since 1978 but oh I can't tell Ike we're having a policy debate maybe it'll trickle down any second now it's not a policy debate they actually don't like you they don't they don't they have deep disdain toward you and and I say you because again I mean the vast majority of us fall under this category we not we might not be living out on the streets but a lot of us are struggling a lot of us are one medical emergency away from complete and utter bankruptcy and they have the audacity to sit there and pretend as though you know the vast majority of Americans are in this economic situation because we lack dignity because we lack dignity these homeboys bought their homes for like ten thousand dollars went to school for free shut the door behind them and then they have the audacity to turn around and accuse us of not having dignity and like I'm fed up with it I'm fed up with it okay I mean you look at the numbers average college graduate has $30,000 in student loan debt one-fifth of college graduates have over a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt home prices continue to rise three times faster than the rate of inflation three times faster than the rate of inflation homes are too expensive we're drowning in student loan debt okay and they have the audacity to accuse us of not having dignity those who have no dignity are the ones who shut the door behind them after taking advantage of all the great opportunities in this country those are the ones with no dignity so that's 78% number people living paycheck to paycheck about four-fifths of the country will get will be bankrupted by $750 bill that they didn't expect if that's not all of us I mean that forfeits of the country right and they think you deserved it you deserved it oh we don't have single-payer health care so you're all on your own and you have a medical emergency and it bankrupts your family ha ha deserved it your mom got cancer I don't care you deserved it you're born for I don't care you deserved it because rich people earn it they have dignity they're they deserve all the money now wait didn't you fix the rules so that rich people can privately financed the elections and donate the politicians and then get them to write the laws on their behalf that's why our wages of flat line since 1978 no we deserved it and you deserve the misery that you read like I'll give you a racial example but you can give it it doesn't have to be racial at all african-americans in this country on average if they're born to a two-parent family have a net wealth a family that they are born into as a net wealth of $16,000 same family that's white two-parent family born into net wealth of a hundred and sixty thousand dollars you think that doesn't make a difference your starting point you think it doesn't make a difference of course it makes a difference but guys it isn't about white or black in this case it's all of us like we said four fifths of the country in this case not about white privilege it's about rich privilege and this guy gets born rich and then goes huh you poor people I hate you because you didn't have the dignity that I have that's how they view
