which was thanks for being with us what is fan pulse so fan pulse is basically the best way to follow sports with your friends it's kind of like you said it's being at the sports bar with all your buddies all the time so the idea is that you check into a game you tell everyone you're watching this game and instantly you're able to cheer with your friends trash out with your friends that are watching the same game now how are you working with say Facebook or Twitter so today we're basically integrate with those guys so what we do is you can find your friends from Facebook and Twitter and bring them into fan pulse just so you can also do that same thing with your iPhone address book and then once you do that when you check in the games of your shell we can actually publish your status back out to Facebook and to Twitter so all your friends know in addition to the friends that you're chatting with on fan pulse now do your user demographic do they use one more than the other um you know our early theories say that there's a lot of facebook usage within our early users twitter is great but it tends to be this i think a lot of people that like to comment into the cloud whereas facebook will update their status to tell their friends what's going on right so we're seeing a you know bigger overlap with facebook although we think there's still a lot of usage with Twitter know how our sports fan is engaging with each other around sports you know when we started this business we actually felt like there's a bit of a cry for help from sports fans and in talking to their friends when they weren't in the same place he would send five SMS messages to each other from a bar and get five back not realizing it that's always going to happen there's no reply all on text messages wait people send emails with the hope that their friends are also watching the game but then they often don't get responses so something to be both watching the game and checking their email at the same time so we really think that imposes a way to solve that by broadcasting what you're doing around sports you got your friends engage with you when it's appropriate for them to engage with you so you can chat you can catch up on what's been going on in the game do all those things on fan pulse so now our people in the US talking with fans in say England for the premier Premier League or how is it working is it becoming like that global of a platform is definitely has that capability today actually though we're seeing a lot of people that you know reckon him at 5am in the states to watch english premier league matches and chat about on fan pulse and they're finding buddies that they didn't know what we're mourning exactly because you can't really get up out of your bed go next door in bed you're watching the game or on your couch but we're seeing you know a lot of communication within community so in the UK people are talking about Premier League using fan pulse no are you doing anything with the Olympics or upcoming sporting events like how do you prepare for those into a march madness is probably going to be huge for you guys absolutely and where we excel is really in connecting friends letting them talk about the sports so with the Olympics right now we don't have any data all we're doing is letting people check into the Olympics and talk to their friends that are also watching and we've seen actually a lot of interaction between East Coast and West Coast people so if you only East closures are saying oh my god that was amazing you know something downhill ski ski event and people in West Coast like oh I haven't seen it yet but I'm going to watch it tonight and upcoming from my real early a little bit of spoiler alert on the Olympics but that NBC's fault not ours yeah with March Madness it's funny you feel like this bracket you spent all this time prepping but from the day you submit it until the end of the tournament there is no interaction with your bracket other than checking your score but there's tons a conversation that happens and so we're going to let people check into games and cheer for the teams and March Madness is great because you have a horse but the horse that you've picked at the same time you cheer against teams if you're gonna win your bracket if you know Kentucky losing the finals that's great and you can talk to your friends during the final so it's still relevant for you whereas your bracket sitting on some sports site somewhere isn't that relevant for you anymore now what are you guys doing for world cup assuming you probably already have something up and running because the qualifiers in one not sure absolutely so we're covering english premier league now we don't we haven't turn on qualifier support yet but we will be doing that shortly but definitely for the world cup left full stats real-time data and let people check in so it'd be pretty cool if you can you know check in and follow it with all your friends that are cheering for the US but also if you have friends abroad you can talk to them we are we can increase some cool features to see who's pulling for what countries at what time so we plan to do a lot around the world cup so you are a app at the App Store give me a little bit of background on the submission and approval process that you have to go through for Apple sure so this was our first time kind of going through the process i would say on the whole we were pleasantly surprised it was very very quick in getting you know from submission to being interviewed to give him feedback the challenges that we had were really that there was no visibility into that what we learned after the fact a little bit later the processes they do a legal review of marketing review a technical review of content review and that feedback comes in parts so it'd be really one more helpful for us to get all that feedback in three days part 1 of feedback in one day and then part two a feedback after we submit again and fix those errors or issues rather that Apple has so it was a it was good in the end we got approved where we're lodge we had an update that was submitted and sent through with two days so that's been great but a little more visibility would always be helpful now do you think they treat bigger guys like a skype or facebook different than say smaller developers um you know what's interesting I've heard that there are people called bread advocates within Apple but I think those tend to be more for brands like the gap and target that have big ad campaigns targeted with their apps and they tend to get longer lead times anyways I don't know that we got treated differently that I got facebook or skype would be you know there's been some public falling out over the facebook app as well meaning the guy at Facebook was not very happy with the applicable process great and so that being said I don't know if it's that different although i will say that would be nice to have some more visibility at a point of contact when you have questions when you're saying hey it's been three days why is my app being reviewed yet i haven't you have no where to reach out to and that's that's a bit of a challenge at least some guidance it'll take us four days to get your average review even that would be more helpful than nothing now do you guys have plans for a facebook app or for blackberry or what other platforms are you looking at sure so we definitely look at fab pulse as a multi-platform service for sports fans so in right now in the process of rolling out our desktop website we should also have a mobile component to it so we optimized for an Android or Blackberry or iPhone browser so we'll be on all the mobile platforms dissolves on the web and you know a facebook tab is definitely it's interesting we're not focus on it today but it's definitely area are going to keep our eyes on now where do you thought Sal I've had you know the cool by the ipad is our app works on an already fan falls where you can turn it on and it works we think it's a really powerful product because it's going to be on your coffee table when you're watching the game so obviously once it launches and it's in consumers hands going to roll out some features are going to help kind of optimized fan polls for the iPad
