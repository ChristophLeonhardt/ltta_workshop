so what this medical guide is claiming is that your sex it's not just gender your sex your biological sex is assigned to you by the doctor after you are born that is what weird that's what we're being told now by like your your actual sex is something that your doctor decides randomly arbitrarily just yep that one's a girl could it be that it could have been a boy could have been a dragon could have been a could've been the tooth fairy but now we've decided to make it a girl and anyway it goes on from there talking about front holds and so forth now two quick things number one I don't want to get overly graphic here but front hole is not even an anatomically correct description of the body part that you have renamed that's all I'll say number two you really see the corseting of the culture here that I am forced to sit here in front of mixed company and talk about front holes like that's not I would prefer not to talk about these it this should be and we are all all of us we are way too comfortable having these kinds of conversations with each other where we're using words like front hole and we're talking about you know these sorts of things and that's what the culture is done because when you've got it's kind of like the choice that we have is we can ignore this kind of stuff and we cannon let that we can let this insanity happen we're body parts are being renamed in order to in order to indulge the the fantasies of mentally disordered individuals we could just let that happen and say fine and not acknowledge it or we can engage with it and address it and and oppose it but in doing so we're forced to have these kinds of conversations and I think that that latter option is the correct option we have to engage we have to we can't just allow this this insanity to occur but it it means necessarily that we all kind of end up down in the muck and we're all affected by the corseting of the culture
