This shell here has probably
about a dozen baby oysters
on it but they're much smaller
than my little pinky nail here.
You can see one at the top of
 
my fingernail.
After several weeks they're
much easier to see.
At that point we're ready to
plant them on to sanctuary
reefs, where they
continue to grow and thrive and
provide ecological benefits.
What we do here,
what we do on this land
is going to affect the water
in our river and in the Potomac
and in the Chesapeake Bay.
This is a little catch
basin, a little spring
development that we harnessed
enough water to fill a two-inch
pipe that goes by gravity
down to the first
pasture in this field now.
And that supplies them with
their water.
 
These are the practices
that farmers need
help with financially and with
technical assistance
to put these in.
And the proposed Trump budget
is going to do away with that.
