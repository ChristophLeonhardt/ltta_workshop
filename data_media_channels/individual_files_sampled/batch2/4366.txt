Brett Kavanaugh finally speaks today for the first time since Brett Cavanaugh has been facing an accusation of sexual assault we heard from Brett Kavanaugh in his own words and he said I will be there but here is what he did not say I demand an FBI investigation I demand an FBI investigation so that I can clear my name he didn't say that in his letter to Chuck Grassley to the chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee today Brett Cavanaugh in writing accepted the invitation to appear before the committee on Monday and he said I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible so that I can clear my name and he could have also said I continue to want an FBI investigation as soon as possible so that I can clear my name but with that letter Brett Kavanaugh made it very very clear that he personally does not want an FBI investigation because he had an opportunity to say it right there and he didn't until we heard from him directly in his own words we could only surmise that he did not want an FBI investigation but now we know and we know that professor Christine blossom Ford does still want an FBI investigation and we also know that dr. Ford will not be there Monday because in a letter from dr. Ford's attorney Deborah Katz to Chuck Grassley sent hours before Brett Cavanaugh's letter was sent she said she wishes to testify provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety a hearing on Monday is not possible and the committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event Deborah Katz canceled her appearance on Rachael's show tonight citing quote active efforts to reach agreement with the committee and so the negotiations are under way and Chuck Grassley threatened 10:00 a.m. deadline tomorrow for dr. Ford's decision about whether she would testify on Monday is no longer a deadline the truth is there are no deadlines in this story none there are no time restrictions the hearing does not have to be next week it does not have to be this month as every member of the Republican Senate proved when they deliberately kept a Supreme Court seat vacant for over a year NBC News is reporting tonight that the negotiations are considering the possibility of Thursday as a potential hearing date but that is not yet settled NBC News is also reporting that dr. Ford does not want Brett Kavanaugh in the room when she testifies and dr. Ford is asking that Brett Kavanaugh testify first and dr. Ford would like other witnesses to testify including the man she says was an eyewitness and participant in the attack on her Marc judge who might have to be subpoenaed because he has told the committee in writing through his attorney that he never witnessed or participated in anything like the assault dr. Ford describes and he does not want to be questioned by anyone about that the Republicans apparently are discussing the possibility of hiring an outside counsel to ask the questions in the committee dr. Ford does not want the committee to hire an outside counsel for the Republicans to ask the questions instead of the Senators and that means that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee seem to realize just how bad they will look as a group of 11 men questioning a woman about a delicate subject some of them must realize just how bad the Republicans looked in that same committee when they attacked the Nita Hill and it bothers me because because she appears to believe everything that she said and I myself don't want to call her a liar but it's an old traveler I have seen witnesses just like that who believe every word they say and every word is absolutely wrong and we've proven it wrong and they still believe that man who didn't want to call Anita Hill a liar is a liar himself tonight said he didn't want to call Anita Hill a liar and then he called her a liar you want to describe a need a hill right there as you heard him describe her as some kind of hysterical pathological liar a liar who still thinks it's true even after we proved to her that what she's saying is not true orrin hatch never ever ever proved Anita Hill wrong never and now Orrin Hatch is lying to his voters in Utah Utah who have kept him in the United States Senate for way too long and he's lying to the country when he says we don't have time for an FBI investigation and when he tells the lie that there is no reason for the FBI to investigate this new information I want you to order an FBI investigation I want an investigation by real appropriate non Senate staffers I want some people who aren't affiliated with the Senate to look into this matter because I think that's the only way we even have the slightest chance any way of getting to the bottom of them that's why I was struck with Rachel's generosity and calling what Orrin Hatch is saying now an argument what Orrin Hatch is saying now is a lie and the person who proves Orrin Hatch is lying now is orrin hatch then because back then Orrin Hatch didn't want Senate staffers to do the investigation no no not Senate staffers he says he wanted real appropriate non Senate staffers and you're gonna find out why that's a very good idea to have real appropriate non Senate staffers do the investigation just a moment from now because we found out today and last night what the Republican Senate staffers and the Judiciary Committee are trying to do and what they're trying to do to dr. Ford orrin hatch is still on that committee and Republicans are terrified tonight right sell that Orrin Hatch will be allowed to ask questions of a woman accuser in the Senate Judiciary Committee once again they are terrified of how that will look and they should be but dr. Ford and her lawyers seem to want America to see the Republican Judiciary Committee for what it is a group of close minded men who have already made up their minds and it is not just the Senators it is the Republican staff of the Judiciary Committee and Brett Kavanaugh is letter to chuck Grassley today he noted that he has been interviewed this week by the Republican staff of the Judiciary Committee the Democratic staff of the committee did not participate in those interviews and last night the Judiciary Committee's Republican chief council for nominations tweeted this unfazed and determined will confirm judge Cavanaugh and he followed that tweet with this one I personally questioned judge Cavanaugh under penalty of felony and five years of imprisonment if he lies I'm still waiting to hear back from the accusers attorneys who can't find time between TV appearances to get back to me that's Mike Davis Mike Davis is a poisonously prejudiced staffer who is determined to confirm judge Cavanaugh and he has not heard one word from dr. Ford and he doesn't have to because he knows the job that Chuck Grassley has given him is to make sure judge Kavanagh is confirmed and we know about these tweets because our first guest tonight former Senate staffer Adam Jensen found them and brought them to public attention whereupon the tweets were deleted because they are outrageous but Mike Davis is still determined and Chuck Grassley is still determined an Aaron hatch is still determined and every Republican man who is a member of the Judiciary Committee is still determined to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and they are willing all of them to tell any lie to do it every single one of them every single Republican member of the committee and every Republican member of the Senate has collectively joined in the big lie that there is no role for the FBI in this investigate every one of them has joined in the big line that this nomination must be voted on quickly and so dr. Ford knows that if she walks into the Judiciary Committee hearing she will be walking into a room where more than half of the Senators are determined to disregard every word that she says and Mike Davis and all those Republican staffers will be sitting behind the Senators in that hearing room with exactly the same determination those staffers all take the same oath of office as those senators it is an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic and it is an oath to faithfully discharge the duties of the office Mike Davis has violated his oath of office Mike Davis would be fired for publicly saying that he is determined to confirm judge Kavanaugh before he has heard accusations against judge Kavanaugh if if Mike Davis was employed by a senator who still took his oath seriously if chuck Grassley took his oath of office seriously he would have fired Mike Davis already but chuck grassley 'he's lying knows no bounds now he has crossed a line with that and I didn't think that about Chuck Grassley or Orrin Hatch when I was working with them on the Senate Finance Committee and when I was the Democratic staff in the 1990s and I never dreamed there would come a day where I would prove either of those men were outright liars just by playing video of what they said about exactly the same thing in the past the proof that chuck Grassley is lying now about the FBI investigation is what chuck Grassley said in support of the FBI investigation of Anita Hill same thing with Orrin Hatch I showed you that video last night of both of them dr. Ford knows she's going into a rigged hearing with a majority of the Senators who have already made up their minds about her testimony before hearing a word of it and she doesn't want those senators to be allowed to hire an outside counsel to save them from doing their own dirty work on mission reports indicate Republicans are looking for a woman lawyer to hire to do that for there isn't a single woman member of the Senate Judiciary Committee not one and now those men on the Republican side of the Judiciary Committee want to hire a woman as an outside counsel to sit there beside chant the chairman Grassley and save all of those men from humiliating themselves as most of them surely will if dr. Ford can come to an agreement with chuck Grassley about when and how to conduct a hearing that is more fair than staffers like Mike Davis and senators like Chuck Grassley and orrin hatch have proven themselves capable of delivering thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
