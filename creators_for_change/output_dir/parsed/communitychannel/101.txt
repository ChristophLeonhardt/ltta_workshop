hi so I don't like bragging look how
awesome I love but I think I'm a pretty
great babysitter Natalie the old man who
added me on Facebook
Peter file wants me to send him a photo
make sure you send a good one
you know one look I'll go the only thing
I'm bad at is when it comes to this
Natalie there's a monster in my room
what what the foam I got it got it here
we are so fucked
oh my god you were so fucked cuz
seriously that shit's scary I mean I
can't do this Natalie there's a monster
in my room
alright let's fuck this bitch stop
alright sits in here okay wait you what
the fuck take up high Rebecca Rebecca
now all done you go to bed now
part of me is always worried that this
might happen I don't know who you killed
cuz the monsters still there hello hello
is that me oh my what the fuck are you
doing in here have you been here the
whole time
yeah I've been here the whole time I saw
you doing that thing
Oh boosters
doosh doosh wait you don't like touched
kids or anything - you touch them I'm
not a monster
well I am kind of a monster but you know
what I mean you can help me out of it
see I'd love to know how you guys think
I should handle this straight a play
along with them or be shy tells them
that they've imagined it because I feel
really bad telling a kid that they've
imagined it my own I think kids
genuinely just make things up nobody
just wants attention
look at me yes no I do apologize I'm
sorry work got really hectic
apparently I found out the hard way if
you spend all day on YouTube watching
fan montages of Dawson's Creek no work
gets done so what anyway so I apologize
but I have a video up next week let me
know how you think I should deal with
the monster situation and I will see you
guys in a week
bye I got 99 problems and Abby's 10th
one a star B star baby I'm on this beast
up yours okay it's porno music / comment
time and innuendo thanks very much I
mentioned this on my Facebook page but I
got a really awful rash and I think you
can sort of see it forming here from
that mask so I'm glad the performance
was worth it in the end and Sofia or if
you watch The Walking Dead Sofia
yes I fear that might be true and well
dude I can't say I agree with you
because if this reminds you of the film
amento then this must remind you of
Titanic but hey I will accept everything
as a compliment
especially the fact that you think I
have a vagina
