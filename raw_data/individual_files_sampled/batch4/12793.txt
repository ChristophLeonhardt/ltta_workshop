people are extremely concerned these days with the issue of bullying so let's let's talk about that let's talk about bullying and and and the problems associated with it I think if we're serious about ridding the world of bullying then we need to finally look at the biggest bullies in America and those would be LGBT activists they are the biggest bullies in America in in the latest act of viciousness and Benj fulness LGBT activists shut down an adoption agency and this isn't even the first adoption agency they've gone after and shut down this is just the latest in a series because you really know that your cause is right and just and true if you're going after adoption agencies right that's a that's a it's a great indication that you're on the right side of things when that's what you're doing adoption agencies bakeries yes these are the great villains that that the LGBT folks are taking down so we should we should applaud themselves that Pat yourselves on the back your real heroes anyway Catholic Charities of Buffalo is just another adoption agency which was made to discontinue its adoption services because if you can believe it Catholic Charities of Buffalo is Catholic they're also in Buffalo so I don't know if but it's the Catholic part of that that was very upsetting to the LGBT mob because the organization would not send children into households with same-sex parents because Catholic Charities abides by Catholic teaching Catholic teaching is that homosexual relationships are disordered and further children should have a mother and a father that's not just Catholic teaching that is the belief of anyone who any Christian who takes the Bible seriously so for that reason it was forced to close down or to close down its adoption facilities anyway now here's the thing the organization's original adoption policy was not only morally correct but also scientifically and logically correct although that's kind of beside the point the fact that they're right about it is it almost doesn't doesn't matter when we look at this situation but I still think we should stipulate that studies have shown children fare better in traditional mother-father families children and same-sex parented households another study showed have higher rates of depression suicide and abuse but this is this should not be a surprise to anyone this is self-evident you shouldn't need a study to tell you you shouldn't need to research you shouldn't need to read a book and say well let me let me do some research to find out if if kids should have a mother and father I need to do I need to do some more I need to do some more research into that no any any rational person should realize this because every child in history has had a mother and father every child who has ever existed or will ever exist or ten ever exist has had biologically a mother and father no child can come into existence without one now this would seem very strongly to indicate that every child should have a mother and father the fact that every child does biologically would seem to suggest that nature intends for every child to have a mother and father in the same way we can say that every person should have two arms and we can arrive at that conclusion based on the fact that every person who has ever existed has had two arms unless something went wrong if somebody is born with only one arm or no arms then we know that there's been a deformity or a mutation or a disease we know something went wrong and we know something went wrong because we know that people should have to of and we know that people should have to Orange because that's how people are that's that's that's part of what it means that that's part of the human physical identity is to have two arms if you don't have two arms then something went wrong right same thing with with the fact that kids have two parents that's every every person in principle that's every person has two parents biologically every person has two parents if a child is raised without their parents or with only one parent well then that means something went wrong there was there was a things didn't go according to plan somewhere along the line if a person ends up without both of their biological parents if something is in principle essential natural and necessary to the human identity then logically we must say that it is how things ought to be and ought to be maintained it is in other words again natural that is what's most natural and if you're an adoption agency of course you're going to look to put kids into the most natural and ideal circumstances possible this this should be non-controversial obviously if you've got it you've got a child needs to be adopted you're gonna look for a mother and father for the child but as I said the rightness of Catholic Charities position here is beside the point the real point is that they have a constitutional right to operate according to the teachings of the church whose name is plastered in huge letters on the building they have every right to operate that way they are the ones who have a right claim they have a claim to rights here the right to operate according to their faith what what claim do the LGBT activist have the ones who are shutting down an adoption agency on what basis do they do they wage that campaign it seems like there can only be two ways to justify it the first one is they could claim and they have claim that they're forcing these adoption agencies to let gays adopt kids or else shut down because they're worried about the kids and what they say is well if the kids aren't if gay couples aren't able to adopt then kids will be left unadopted but that's clearly ridiculous just because a particular child isn't adopted by homosexuals doesn't mean that he won't be adopted by anyone this is the false choice that you hear the gay activists make all the time they say well what so you're saying it's better for a child to be left languishing in the adoption agency than to be adopted by a gay couple that's not the choice there's a third option the third option is that they're adopted by a heterosexual couple and there's a line 50 miles long of heterosexual couples waiting to adopt so by no means can you argue that the lack of gay adoption will necessitate that children will be left abandoned in the system because there are many heterosexual families mother-father natural families that are waiting to adopt and that can adopt and so if a child is not adopted by a gay couple he is still could very likely be adopted by a heterosexual couple this this by the way is that you hear the same kind of argument when it comes to adoption you hear the same kind of argument from pro aborts where they will say well if you're so against abortion then why then why aren't people lining up around the block to adopt kids they are you nincompoops that's exactly what they're doing there are tons and touch thousands of pro-life families that are desperately want to adopt and have been wading through the system trying to adopt and waiting to adopt so that argument is just not true and besides which if you were really concerned about kids being it you know about about kids getting adopted um then then clearly it makes no sense to shut down adoption agencies even if a small minority of children have been left in the system because they weren't adopted by a gay family which isn't happening but even if it were many many many more will now be left in the system because you're shutting down adoption agencies so if this was really about the kids you wouldn't be doing that the LGBT activists if they really cared about the kids which they don't but if they did they would say well look Catholic Charities I disagree with their policy it's very mean it hurts my feelings however obviously they should be able to stay open and do what they do because they're doing a wonderful thing and they're making sure the kids get adopted and so let's leave them alone that's that's how they if LGBT activist if they if they gave a damn about kids or about anyone other than themselves they would that's how they would approach these situations they would make their case they would make their argument they make it passionately and then when they're told by the by the other party concerned that listen I hear your argument don't agree with it these are my convictions this is my organization this is how I'm running it so I'm not gonna do what you want me to do at that point the other photographers if they cared about kids they would say okay all right well then we'll you know we'll find an adoption agency that will adopt that will let gay couples adopt so this isn't about children no it's it's about the homosexuals themselves as always everything on the left it's always just about any time I left this is arguing but all their causes everything it's all about them it's about their own advantage their own priorities their own benefit their own gain that's always what it's about now you notice when you go over to the other side of the spectrum and I'll be the last person to issue a blanket defense of all conservatives or to claim that they're all you know virtuous and selfless and everything like that because that's certainly not the case but on the conservative side of the spectrum some of the movements are traditionally associated with conservatism like the pro-life movement these are selfless movements like a pro-life woman does not gain anything materially from being pro-life she doesn't stand to gain anything from that's not that's not a selfish position it's an inherently selfless position because she's arguing on behalf of children and not only that but she doesn't it means if she gets her way and abortion is made illegal and then she gets pregnant that option won't be open to her either so that's a sacrifice she's willing to make but you notice on the left there are no sacrifices they never make any it's it's it's never about anyone else it's never any sacrifices being made it's always me me me me me this is what I want but what they will try to do and what the other 50 activists here have also done on top of saying oh we care about the kids they don't but they all say well it's about rights this is a art this is a fight for rights what what right was being violated if a gay couple is told that they can't adopt what right was violated the right to adopt that right doesn't exist children aren't commodities that you're entitled to possess you don't have a right to a child in an adoption agency that's a human being it's not a thing you can own what kind of person what kind of person walks into a an adoption agency and says I have a right to one of these one of these are mine I have a right to them what kind of what kind of arrogance is that I mean it's disgusting to to to I don't know how else to put it they're not things they're people and you don't have a right to them the only children you have a right to if we want to put it that way are your own children so if you conceive or give birth to a child you have a right to that child as in that is your child and no one has a right to take them from you unless the law has to step in because you are victimizing your child in some horrible way or if you do actually adopt the Giants that do actually adopt their child well that's their child in every sense of the word that is their child and no one has a right to take that child from them but the children who are not adopted who are in adoption agencies and you you know you're going and you walk into an adoption agency none of those children are yours yet so you don't have a right to them you have no legal claim over them whatsoever Sedgwick there are many rules governing who can adopt if we have a right to adopt then that means that any old person should be able to stroll into an orphanage and adopt whatever kid they want with no qualifications but that's not how it works and that's not how it should work talk to any talk to any any any couple that's been through the adoption process they'll tell you there are tons of Hoops that you have to you have to jump through probably too many hoops but we all I think we all agree that there should be some coops I mean there should be some qualifications and so it's got nothing to do with right it's got nothing to do with the kids it's just about being bullies and this is just another in a long long line of examples of the gay left scorching the earth wrecking lives in an effort to impose its ideology on everyone Jack Phillips is another of course example you want a victory against them in the Supreme Court but they haven't relented they're still going after him they're still trying to destroy his livelihood and they'll continue the assault for another five years ten years twenty years until they get their way and we're seeing this repeated across the country with other bakers and photographers and people in the wedding industry and so forth they're all being it's being demanded of all of them that they bow before the LGBT altar or they go out of business those are the choices they're being given speaking of bowing before the altar just this week Brown University pulled down a study which indicated that teenagers become trans to imitate their peers the reason why this study was conducted is because if you look around and you see there's this massive uptick in people identifying as trans which doesn't make any sense if if transgenderism is an actual natural biological phenomenon there's no reason why there should be more of it now just because it's in the news so it really seems like you know kids are seeing how this gender fluidity stuff is in the news and it's in the media it's in Hollywood and so they're looking and their friends are doing it too and so they're looking at that and they're saying well I guess I'm transgender also they're it's because of peer pressure and because of you know because of it's a trend basically well a study was which was conducted which went some credence to that view but the LGBT mob reacted with outrage at this study and they demanded that its contents be suppressed they simply will not allow any discussion of the social and biological facts related to the trans thing they will tolerate only a complete and unthinking acceptance of their dogmas and that's what makes them bullies by the way keep this in mind keep it in mind how the LGBT folks suppress a scientific study because they didn't like the conclusion not because they had any problem with the methodology not because they could scientifically disprove it but they just didn't like the conclusion so they they insisted that be suppressed remember this the next time the left demands that you produce a study to prove some self-evident point that you've made well if you have trouble locating studies like that this is why because they won't tolerate studies that contradict them they'll punish anyone who conducts them and they'll throw them out so and then they demand that we produce studies to prove our points after they've thrown out all those studies and they've you know burn them in the bonfire and they threatened any researchers who might try to repeat the sin the same thing happened with with the DSM the Diagnostic and Statistical mystic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders LGBT activist insisted that transgenderism which up until a few years ago was considered a mental disorder they insisted that it be removed from the DSM again not because there have been any scientific breakthrough not because it had been proven that oh actually a man with a penis can be a woman no that never happened they just didn't like it being in there because it offended them and it wasn't ideologically convenient and so for those ideological and political reasons they demanded that it be removed and they got their way as usual but now they'll actually try to use that to prove their case so if you say transgenderism as a mental disorder which it is they'll say oh yeah well it's not in the DSM yeah it's not at the DSM because you had it removed you demanded they take it out you you kicked and scream and stomped your feet until it was taken out that's why it's not in there as you well know now I could cite a thousand other examples but there's no need the point is plain enough LGBT activists are the worst bullies in America by far it's not close they believe that their goal is manifestly good and so they can resort to whatever means are necessary to achieve it and that that means ruining lives tearing down businesses leaving children without families well as far as they're concerned that is a price worth paying not even really a price more like a perk because they enjoy it I mean they were celebrating when an adoption agency was closed down they were celebrating it they loved it because they because that's how bullies are they just want to get their way and that's how that they get their kicks that way um and what is this good goal anyway this this good that they're working towards well they'll say that they seek equality but that can't be it because they already have equality homosexuals have all the same rights as heterosexuals in fact they have rights that heterosexuals don't have for instance I can't it's if someone refuses to make me a cake I can't go to the Human Rights Commission and complain about it and have anything done they'll just laugh me out of the room but if you're a homosexual you actually have a right supposedly in some states in many states you have a right to cake that's all right I don't have in fact the one and only inequality that was left between homosexuals and heterosexuals the inequality was the rule prohibiting active homosexuals from donating blood due to the fact that homosexuals have a much much much much much higher probability of contracting HIV then a heterosexual non drug user the rates of HIV in the gay community are much much much higher than they are in the among heterosexuals and so for that reason logically if in the name of safety gay people were we're not able to give blood but even that is now under attack and those rules are being repealed everywhere the LGBT lobby will risk giving HIV to hospital patients if it means they get their way they will shut down adoption agencies they will risk giving HIV they will they will tear down businesses ruin lives take people's livelihoods from them that's what they'll do you and that's nothing to do with equality so if equality isn't to aim then what is the name tolerance they would they want tolerance homosexuality is not only tolerated but celebrated there's not gonna be any parades marching down the streets celebrating my sexual proclivities no that's that's only what homosexuals have so they have much more than tolerance they have in many quarters something much closer to worship which is what they demand so what is the point it's not tolerance not equality well the point is just vengeance spite imposing their will expressing their hatred getting their way power they are bullies and that's all the gay rights fight in America is anymore because they have all the rights and so now anytime someone says they're fighting for gay rights that's not what they're fighting for they're fighting to impose themselves now that's all it is thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you you
