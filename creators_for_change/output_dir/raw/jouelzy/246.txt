have links for everything down below my

81
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,400
stuff is Bruce Jenner who was in a four

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
car accident this past weekend and yes

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,760
he has been in the news because

84
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,489
apparently he is transitioning from male

85
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,910
to female um let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this</font>

86
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,260
cracks in it first because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

87
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,970
crazy a woman to lose her life they're

88
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,830
saying it was looking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's bruce</font>

89
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,030
jenner's fault because he was on his

90
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,440
phone during the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font>

91
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,780
think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just crazy for this to be</font>

92
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,850
happening in the midst of him being in

93
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the media already for very controversial</font>

94
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,290
topic now with regards to the whole

95
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,230
trans situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've made a point to not</font>

96
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,720
talk about trans issues at all on my

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,220
channel because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like I'm at</font>

98
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,209
the point where I could have a

99
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,010
productive conversation around the issue

100
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,110
and I don't naturally feel like the

101
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,330
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really at a point where the</font>

102
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,430
questions that I have can really be

103
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,410
asked right now and they're be the sort

104
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">of discussion that I want there to be</font>

105
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,850
around you know trans specifically with

106
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,970
regards to black women in this community

107
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,970
way deeper than we<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get trying</font>

108
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,860
to keep that same refrain what regarding

109
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,660
that Bruce Jenner situation even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

110
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">my hesitation with it is more sort of do</font>

111
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,019
with his dealings with Kris Jenner and

112
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,790
the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he does come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a very</font>

113
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,940
media crazy and media obsessed family

114
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,120
and he himself you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though the</font>

115
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,859
Kardashians might have one up to man

116
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:17,850
being media crazy Bruce Jenner has

117
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,470
always been a very mainstay in media to

118
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,670
the point where people are accusing him

119
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,360
of being a sellout and so yeah I just

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">have kind of a pause with this</font>

121
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,260
transitioning to a woman thing and like

122
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,030
yeah him and chris our divorce but like

123
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,550
really and what's her role in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

124
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,200
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how is she trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to flip this</font>

125
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,090
for some media coin because i feel i

126
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,410
just recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> i posted an article on my</font>

127
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook page totally unaware of the</font>

128
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,330
larger issue that was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did not</font>

129
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a measles out</font>

130
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,140
when it comes say hi my mother is here

131
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,180
she should come say hi come<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

132
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting ready to talk about</font>

133
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,260
anti-vaxxers we were back cited as kids

134
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,910
all of you were well there's this thing

135
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with those a measles outbreak</font>

136
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,600
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Disney World and I did not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

137
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,830
this and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted an article about how</font>

138
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,750
anti-vaxxers impact those who are too

139
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,610
young or immune diseases that don't

140
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,190
allow them to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> vaccinated and I did</font>

141
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">not realize that it was that big of an</font>

142
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,310
issue but people are not back sending

143
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,480
their children because they feel like it

144
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,670
leads to autism think it's the MMR

145
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,410
vaccination that they believe weeds to

146
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,580
autism and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what's really</font>

147
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,350
happening is that autism spectrum

148
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,770
disorder did not enter into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the American</font>

149
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,470
context until the 1940s so it's very new

150
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,000
disease yeah 1943 really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm-hmm get</font>

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,160
white so easy for people to fall into

152
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,420
this fallacy of a belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

153
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,000
vaccination<font color="#E5E5E5"> will cause autism but this</font>

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,970
vaccination has been around before

155
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,360
autism was even understood in the

156
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,800
American context and so I just I it's

157

<font color="#E5E5E5">just it's not it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

158
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,210
it's a very slippery slope and it's a

159
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,740
hard conversation have a people<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

160
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,980
people will regurgitate things that

161
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,810
sound really good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when she scratched</font>

162
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,340
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the surface don't really hold much</font>

163
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">facts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a hard time try to get</font>

164
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,040
them to understand why this is in

165
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,410
well that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people were trying to</font>

166
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,830
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a move by the CDC or</font>

167
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government to keep us back a sheep</font>

168
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lead us to the slaughter why</font>

169
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,650
would you continue to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the doctor</font>

170
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,640
at all why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take</font>

171
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,710
over-the-counter medicine you know it's

172
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same breath that people are saying</font>

173
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,620
oh if the government try to control us

174
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,450
people are also trying to attribute this

175
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,820
to big pharma companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

176
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,960
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">pharmaceutical companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes so much</font>

178
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,910
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over-the-counter drugs and</font>

179
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,310
they do over prescription drugs this is

180
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,990
why most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your allergy medications</font>

181
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,390
like zyrtec or claritin have become over

182
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the counter because they become</font>

183
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,480
accessible to more people they can

184
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,860
charge you a higher rate and are not

185
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,240
subsidized by the government benefit

186
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,820
large pharmaceutical companies for us to

187
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,770
vaccinate and so I really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think</font>

188
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,420
it's funny that people will accuse big

189
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,530
pharma companies are pushing their

190
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,110
vaccinations on us when you know on the

191
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,640
flipside somebody can say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

192
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,590
all a conspiracy theory to just get

193
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,390
everybody confused and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

194
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,340
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so many people aren't</font>

195
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,950
pushing away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> these vaccinations and</font>

196
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,690
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> having this art outbreaks and</font>

197
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,430
nobody can decide what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real causes</font>

198
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,920
of them are and at the end the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day we</font>

199
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,020
also have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be medicated for them who's</font>

200
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,540
winning<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this discussion the</font>

201
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,760
pharmaceutical companies um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

202
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,780
just really want to courage people

203
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,430
overall and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speculation discussion</font>

204
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions learn how to</font>

205
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,690
properly question your doctor to get

206
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,160
honest answers and I think that's where

207
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,810
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have the problem with</font>

208
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,060
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> having doctors that do not have good</font>

209
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,160
bed seismic bedside manner if somebody

210
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,140

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rebuff to his recent interview</font>

233

with billboard that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

234

<font color="#E5E5E5">including myself took issue with because</font>

235
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,710
look a lot of opinions that kind of

236
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,059
erred on the side of respectability

237
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,169
politics and he took the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bet and went to</font>

238

240
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,390
about Kendrick and his new song because

241
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,830
I do appreciate him calling on his own

242
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,200
hypocrisy and really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talking</font>

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,960
about his own<font color="#E5E5E5"> internal struggle with</font>

244
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,290
having a public voice and being able to

245
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,750
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things in a public forum but</font>

246
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,400
still feeling a certain way about what's

247
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,810
going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his own community and trying</font>

248
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out where he lies with all of</font>

249
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,830
that I love the cover art a title is

250
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,450
based off of wallace Beery men's book

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,930
sooner hopefully fingers crossed it's so

258
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,320
much work he apologized but overall I

259
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">really just you know regardless of</font>

260
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,650
Kendrick Lamar's previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> billboard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font>

261
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,580
interview I never really held that

262
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,560
against him so much because I have you

263
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,630
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of these people who</font>

264
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,630
usually enjoy listening to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ident I</font>

265
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,400
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to always agree</font>

266
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,180
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their opinion but I also definitely</font>

267
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,280
appreciate his humility and I appreciate

268
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel like his association with</font>

269
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,480
flying lotus is rubbing off with him

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,210
because even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though this song was</font>

271
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,610
produced by I think boy one day

272
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,190
I just enjoy the overall kind of I'm

273
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,839
getting a lot more flying lotus by

274
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,200
between I which won the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grammy and that</font>

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
black of the berry and he actually is on

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,519
flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis his last album with the</font>

277
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,370
song catch them if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can I believe as</font>

278
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,110
a title song I don't know the video is

279
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,079
dope though<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely check out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

280
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,760
video I'll link it down below which is

281
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,529
super cute video watch I listen to the

282
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,209
song on YouTube and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font>

283
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,560
into a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times really kind of get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

284
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,450
gist of the lyrics cuz it's heavy and I

285
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,610
would it was most amusing is that I kind

286
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,320
of ended down the rabbit hole because

287
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,060
there was someone who commented and I

288
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,680
had never heard anything before the

289
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,360
third pew and he had a check next was

290
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">name so i click on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his profile because</font>

291
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,480
that means he's legit in the name of

292
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">youtube um but you know in cooking his</font>

293
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,060
profile it was like really interesting

294
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,279
to discover someone who's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

295
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,810
blatantly talk about black racial issues

296
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,480
to a post-race audience and like be

297
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,550
accepted for it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's super</font>

298
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,750
cute that he can make race very

299
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,860
palatable all because<font color="#CCCCCC"> dispense with</font>

300
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,430
tyler oakley like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like looking</font>

301
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,450
through his stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think oh this is</font>

302
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,519
really cool and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then it also</font>

303
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,260
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of makes me sad well sad but not</font>

304
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,880
sad it's like a really weird ization

305
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,610
when you realize how engaging kind of

306
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,570
the white or the non-black teenage

307
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,519
youngster teenage young adult audience

308
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,220
is in contrast to black women<font color="#CCCCCC"> i promise</font>

309

312
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,519
I'm more understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and less</font>

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,310
frustrated when<font color="#E5E5E5"> brands or companies or</font>

314
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,560
potential opportunities tell me that

315
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,350
they are unsure about working in this

316
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">sector because black women are really</font>

317

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not that easy to work with and</font>

it's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the examples are clear when</font>

319
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,589
I look at kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> my lateral peers</font>

320
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,529
who have similar content but are able to

321
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,670
engage a racially at a racially

322
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,910
different kind of audience and age group

323
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,650
and their engagement rates are like

324
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,440
super duper high like between gay men

325
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,740
and young adults way more engaging than

326
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,120
whoever is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the obby just learned</font>

327

black culture and she can't seem to

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,000
catch a hit and she uncle couldn't catch

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,100

whatever happened according to Iggy what

364
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,390

366
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,060

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,500

<font color="#CCCCCC">like the news is being very unethical</font>

when he talks and I guess you know but

402
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,040
so much of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be editing technically</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">he used thank you for agreeing with me</font>

407
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,329
backbone for me and I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

408
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:29,329
that

409
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:35,120
yes don't think she she doesn't choose

410
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,459
she just always aim to miss the mark on

411
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,130
when to set someone straight and when to

412
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,019
actually be upset at somewhere she just

413
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,820
gets angry at all the wrong people and

414
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,100
just she's constantly shifting blame and

415
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,990
then nothing ever gets resolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> Portia</font>

416
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,910
is still dumb as doorknobs and I think

417
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,170
I'm at the point where I might have to

418
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,899
stop watching Real Housewives of Atlanta

419
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,610
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like it's</font>

420
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,550
portraying the message that I want I

421
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,870
feel like it's erring on the side of

422
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,649
where it really is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for Porsha</font>

423
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:10,850
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so much kind of broto around</font>

424
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,640
having fake tits nice teeth and a cute

425
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,519
leave but no substance beneath that and

426
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,630
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are really kind of</font>

427
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,820
feeding into the storyline and feeding

428
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,140
it to this image<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's presenting as</font>

429
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,380
something desirable it's it's it's

430
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,029
slightly different it's offensive it is

431
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,980
it's some jager I guess you guys thought
