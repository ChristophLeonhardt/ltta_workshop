this is our second day here in Israel today I'm at the Roman ruins of the city of Caesarea but for the most of the day we spent it in the city of Ariel no Ariel is a 40 year old city in Israel it has about twenty thousand people another fifteen thousand students attended their University and the city of Ariel is a victim of fake news you see Arielle is one of the so-called settlements that are so persecuted and maligned by the United Nations but if you actually go to Ariel you'll see that it's just what we would call a regular bedroom community you see the left changes the meanings of words to delegitimize places like Ariel and say that Jews can't build their homes there and because of fake news being spread about cities like Ariel Ariel itself has become the most boycotted city in the most boycotted country in the entire world the factories that exist in the industrial park outside of Ariel have become targets of the BDS movement and as an unintended consequence of the BDS movement those factories are moving to other areas in Israel and as a result thousands of Palestinians are losing their jobs towns and cities like Ariel provide jobs and much-needed services to the Palestinian communities around it and yet places like Ariel are much maligned by the United Nations becoming targets of United Nations motions because the United Nations says that there are places that Jews cannot build their homes and places that Jews cannot live while the United Nations has no problem with unfettered unmitigated mass Muslim migration to the Western world for the rebel media I'm Shiela gunnery it's day 2 of our coverage here in Israel to see all of our reports from on the ground here go to rebel Israel calm you
