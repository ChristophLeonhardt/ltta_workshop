00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:13,223
ARAB NATIONS TO ALLOW FOR

5
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:15,225
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.

6
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:16,993
A FREEDOM FOR WHICH HE DIED

7
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:17,394
FIGHTING.

8
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:18,661
LAST NIGHT THE NEWSPAPER

9
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,163
RELEASED AN UPON COLUMN THAT HE

10
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:21,664
WROTE BEFORE HE WENT MISSING.

11
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,066
IN IT, KHAISHOGGI SAID PART OF

12
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,934
THE PROBLEM IS ARAB NATIONS

13
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,002
DON'T FACE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT

14
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:27,904
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN THEY

15
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,707
DO THINGS LIKE LOCK UP CRITICS

16
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,908
OR TAKE OVER NEWSPAPERS.

17
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,943
THOSE ACTIONS HE WROTE NO LONGER

18
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:36,346
CARRY THE CONSEQUENCE OF A

19
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:37,781
BACKLASH OF THE INTERNATIONAL

20
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,215
COMMUNITY.

21
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:40,683
INSTEAD, THESE ACTIONS MAY

22
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,852
TRIGGER CONDEMNATION FOLLOWED BY

23
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:43,186
SILENCE.

24
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:45,555
AS A RESULT, ARAB GOVERNMENTS

25
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,857
HAVE BEEN GIVEN FREE REIGN TO

26
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,059
CONTINUE SILENCING THE MEDIA AT

00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,226
AN INCREASING RATE.

THANKS FOR COMING.

DECISION TO POST.

43
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:19,522
>> WELL, IT WAS BOTH HARD AND

44
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:20,390
EASY, SHEPARD.

45
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,526
HARD, AS YOU SAY, IT MEANT

46
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:24,861
ADMITTING TO OURSELVES THAT

47
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:27,964
JAMAL WAS UNLIKELY TO COME BACK

48
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:29,599
AND HELP US EDIT IT.

49
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,234
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T

50
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:32,569
WANTED TO ADMIT.

51
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,370
EASY IN THE SENSE THAT IT WAS

52
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:36,106
SUCH AN AMAZING STATEMENT OF

53
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:37,774
WHAT HE BELIEVED IN, WHAT HE HAD

54
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:41,044
BEEN FIGHTING FOR MOST OF HIS

55
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:44,747
LIFE, WHY HE WENT INTO EXILE AND

56
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:47,016
APPARENTLY IF WHAT WE'RE HEARING

57
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,385
IS TRUE, THE VALUES OF WHAT HE

58
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:50,053
GAVE HIS LIFE FOR.

59
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:50,787
>> Shepard: KHAISHOGGI WAS

60
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:53,156
CRITICAL OF THE SAUDI KING AND

61
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:55,024
THE CROWN PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN

62
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:57,527
ACCUSED OF SENDING THE HIT SQUAD

63
00:01:57,528 --> 00:02:00,697
TO TURKISH CONSULATE.

64
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:04,134
AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS FOR THE

65
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,870
WHAT THE CROWN PRINCE WAS

66
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,272
ADVOCATING, THE REFORMS.

67
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:09,973
>> YES.

68
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,841
IT'S UNFATHOMABLE THAT THIS

69
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:15,612
CRIME WAS TAKING PLACE AND WHY A

70
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:17,914
LOT OF US HERE AT THE POST HAD A

71
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:19,315
HARD TIME BELIEVING THIS WAS

72
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:19,682
TRUE.

73
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:23,353
JAMAL WAS A PATRIOT.

74
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:25,288
HE BELIEVES THE MIDDLE EAST

75
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,190
NEEDED A BRIGHTER FUTURE.

76
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,925
HE NEEDED THE REFORMS TO

77
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:29,292
SUCCEED.

78
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,727
HE SAW HIMSELF AS A CONSTRUCTIVE

79
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,061
CRITIC THAT WAS SAYING IF YOU

80
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:34,030
WANT TO OPEN UP THE KINGDOM, IF

81
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:36,799
YOU WANT TO BE MORE THAN JUST AN

82
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,603
OIL PETRO STATE, YOU HAVE TO

83
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:42,805
RELY ON THE VIBRANCY OF YOUR OWN

84
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:43,139
PEOPLE.

85
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,277
TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO

86
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,345
LET THEM SPEAK, EXCHANGE

87
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:49,712
OPINIONS.

88
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:50,747
THE KINGDOM WOULD BE STRONGER IF

89
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,148
YOU ALLOWED THAT.

90
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,751
THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT HE WAS

91
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:55,151
DELIVERING.

92
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:56,886
IT'S WHY WE TRANSLATED THERE

93
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,922
PIECE INTO ARABIC AND SOME OF

94
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:00,056
HIS OTHER PIECES.

95
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,624
HE WANTED THIS MESSAGE TO HIS

96
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,092
OWN PEOPLE AND THE REGION.

97
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:05,328
HE VERY MUCH SAW IT AS IN THE

98
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,596
INTEREST OF HIS COUNTRY.

99
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:12,802
>> Shepard: SELF-IMPOSED EXILE

100
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,037
LAST YEAR.

101
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,305
EXPLAIN WHY AND HOW HE CAME TO

102
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:15,905
THE POST.

103
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:18,708
>> HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIS

104
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,042
COUNTRY.

105
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:24,581
HE HAD BEEN A JOURNALIST THERE

106
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,648
FOR MANY YEARS.

107
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,450
SAUDI ARABIA HAS NEVER BEEN A

108
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:27,817
DEMOCRACY.

109
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,786
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SOME

110
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:30,220
RESTRICTIONS.

111
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,023
BUT IN 2016, HE BEGAN TO SEE --

112
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,025
AND 2017 WHEN THE CROWN PRINCE

113
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:38,294
WAS TIGHTENING HIS GRIP, I THINK

114
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:39,529
JAMAL BEGAN TO SEE IT WAS

115
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,931
DIFFERENT THAN IT HAD BEEN

116
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:42,298
BEFORE.

117
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,733
THERE WAS EVEN THE LIMITED SPACE

118
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:47,203
THAT HAD EXISTED IN THE PAST WAS

119
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,371
GOING AWAY.

120
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:51,007
HE SAID, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

121
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:52,709
MY COUNTRY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

122
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,943
MY COUNTRYMEN THAT CAN'T SPEAK

123
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:54,911
UP AT ALL.

124
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:57,247
THEY'RE IN PRISON OR MUZZLED

125
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:57,647
OTHER WAYS.

126
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:01,918
SO I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK

127
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,185
UP.

128
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,186
HE WENT INTO EXILE.

129
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:05,021
HE KNEW HE WAS TAKING RISKS.

130
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:06,689
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK HE COULD

131
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,058
HAVE IMAGINED ANYTHING LIKE THIS

132
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,829
ANYMORE THAN THE REST OF US

133
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,196
COULD.

134
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:15,698
BECAUSE PEOPLE AT HOME WERE LESS

135
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,668
AND LESS ABLE TO EXPRESS

136
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,768
OPINIONS.

137

00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,840
THIS COLUMN THAT WAS RELEASED

139
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,308
LAST NIGHT THAT THE ARAB WORLD

140
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,744
IS FACING ITS OWN VERSION OF AN

141
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,647
IRON CURTAIN IMPOSED NOT BY

142
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:33,449
EXTERNAL FACTORS BUT THROUGH

143
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,786
DOMESTIC FORCES FOR POWER.

DURING THE COLD WAR, RADIO FREE

145
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:39,589
EUROPE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,090
IN FOSTER AND SUSTAINING THE

00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,525
HOPE AND FREEDOM.

148
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:43,726
ARABS NEED SOMETHING SIMILAR.

149
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,161
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT HE TALKED

150
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:46,062
ABOUT OFTEN?

151
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:48,898
IS THIS PART OF HIS MESSAGE?

152
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:49,899
>> HE DID.

153
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,702
YOU KNOW, IN 2011 WHEN THERE WAS

154
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:55,405
THE BRIEF ARAB SPRING, I THINK

155
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:58,541
HE SAW LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

156
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,709
ARABS ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN

157
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,209
ANYBODY ELSE.

158
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,878
THEY WANT THE DIGNITY OF

159
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,714
FREEDOM, THEY WANT TO EXPRESS

160
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,114
THEMSELVES.

161
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:07,517
UNTIL THEN, THERE'S THIS MIX OF

162
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:10,753
OH, THE ARAB DON'T WANT

163
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:11,154
DEMOCRACY.

164
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:15,958
OF COURSE, EVERYBODY WANTS THAT

165
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,292
DIGNITY.

166
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:18,328
WHEN THE ARAB STRING COLLAPSED,

167
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,996
HE BEGAN TO THINK ESPECIALLY

168
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,597
LAST YEAR, TALKED TO US AND

169
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:24,534
