mr. president thank you very much for inviting us here for giving this opportunity having spent years now traveling to and fro Syria reporting for theatres an honor to finally meet you but mr. president since time is short first question you latest victories in Goethe in Yarmouk they have drastically changed the situation on the ground in Syria how much nearer the end of this war are we now in your estimation first of all you're most welcome to Syria with every move forward in the battlefield with every victory with every label liberated area we are moving closer closer to the end of the conflict and always said without external interference it won't take more than a year to settle the situation in Syria but at the same time with every move forward for the Syrian army and for the political process and for the whole situation forward in the positive meaning towards the most ability our enemies and our opponents mainly the West led by the United States and their puppets in Europe and in our region with the mercenaries in Syria they try to make it further either by supporting more terrorism bringing more terrorists coming to Syria or by hindering the political process so our challenge is how can we make this gap to close this gap between their plans and our plans and I think we are succeeding in that regard but at the same time is difficult for anyone to tell you when but it is getting closer that's self-evident well you latest military victories they have objectively speaking spectacular the speed at which rebel defenses of that have withstood for years and collapsed are you planning on retaking all of Syria by force we're talking about it live the border with Israel as the f control territory the the war is the worst a choice I think every Syrian agree upon this fact but sometimes you only have this choice especially when you talk about factions like al-qaeda like Isis like al-nusra and the like-minded factions actually most of them have the same ideology you actually slam the harem and so on they're not ready for in a dialogue they don't have any political plan they only have this dart ideological plan is to be like any al-qaeda controlled area anywhere in in this world so the only option to deal with those factions is force at the same time in other areas we succeeded by implementing reconciliations especially when the community in those different areas made pressure on those militants to leave those area so I think the best choice is to make reconciliation this is our plan but when it doesn't work the only metric to resort to is the force well with regards to reconciliation how wise is it to send all of these veteran jihadists with their small arms to Italy by now tens of thousands of tens of thousands of gone have gone to Italy they have consolidated they have built defenses eventually as you say you you'll have to fight them on the other hand are you perhaps planning on building an area that is outside of government control you or if they will go to liberate every area so it's impossible for us to to intentional leave any area on the Syrian soil outside our control as government this is natural and as you know Italy was captured by the terrorists in 2015 with this Turkey support it was it was mainly captured by Al Muslim and some other supportive factions without the reconciliations before that time but every conciliation happened after that time after 2015 it was I think May 2015 every faction wanted to leave the city or the village they chose to go to Italy this is very good indication that they have the same ideology because they choose to go to al-nusra area they didn't choose to go to any other area so we did insane people to Italy they wanted to go to Italy because they have the same incubator they have the same atmosphere way of thinking and so on this one part the other part which is military aspect of the off of your question the plan of the terrorists and their masters was to distract the Syrian army by scattering the different units all over the Syrian soil which is not good for any army our plan was to put them in one area to area three areas if we let's say if you have two or three or four frontiers better than having tens and maybe more than 100 frontier at the center so militarily it is better they chose it but it's better for us from the military point of view on the other hand talking about similar mindsets it'll be predominantly the rebels they overwhelmingly are Sunni Sunni myself I have a long distant relative who King to Syria to fight against you to resist you because he was told that you were targeting you were killing Sunnis and that is what many people in Italy believe why is it that so many people in all these different countries in America and Russia these Sunnis these Muslims they believe that you were oppressing because the first narrative when it started in turn internationally maybe in the West of course and within Syria when in some mainstream media's in our region and in the West their plan was to create this rift within the society that will make things easier for them when you have such a civil war kind of civil war between sects or ethnicities and it failed now they keep using the same narrative at least to encourage some fanatics in different places in the world to come and defend their brothers in this area code that's how would they imagine they imagined that there is conflict between sects so because of their narrow-minded way of thinking some may be oh they're ignorant they came here just to support her father's now if I'm going to tell you this is right or wrong your audience doesn't know if it doesn't know me they they they don't have any idea maybe about my credibility I'll tell you you know see there very well it's better to go and see the reality on the ground now if there's such a narrative let's say in reality sex skinning and other saved Syria should be divided now according to sectarian line you should come to this area under our control and see one color or a few colors of the Syrian society you should go to the other area where you have the terrorists we should have different colors and the reality is not like this now in Damascus in Aleppo in Homs in every area under the Syrian the Syrian government control you will see every spectrum of the Syrian society with no exceptions so that this reality will debunk this narrative I mean yeah how could they live with each other while the government is killing them according the sectarian basis it doesn't work fair enough but with regards to negotiations and reconciliation talks have there have been efforts to start talks to achieve a result in Geneva in Astana there has been limited success but it is been it hasn't been oh that great now let's be honest you're winning you're winning on the ground your forces are advancing the rebels are in retreat why would you negotiate with them now that they're losing in the very beginning we said whenever we can save Syrian blood we have to go forward and deal with this in it with any initiative any kind of initiative even if they have bad will some people some some initiatives have have bad will but in spite of that we dealt with and the reality now if you go around Syria the reality the results that repairs being embodied by the reconciliations is a proof of what I'm saying without this policy without this intention of saving blood negotiating talking to people we couldn't have reached these reconciliations this is one thing the other thing not everyone for the government have the same base some of them have ideological background some of them for financial background some of them they made mistake the very beginning they were forced to go in that direction and they couldn't with the dough so you have to open the doors and you have to distinguish between different kind of people and the most important than this the majority of the people who were against the government against the government apparently in the different liberated area actually in danger in their heart they are with the government they could tell the difference between having government and having chaos well with regards to talks and you know retaking areas by force let's take for example SDF control territories in the resort there have been clashes there between troops who were loyal to you and V SDF itself the United States partners and the United States brought to bear force to stop troops loyal to you from taking territories this has happened that I tank as well how are you going to deal with the United States presence military presence in Syria after the liberation of Aleppo and later days or and before that humph and now Damascus actually the United States is losing his cards the main card was unlawful that was called moderate but when the scandal started leaking that they are not moderate they are al Qaeda that was supposed to be fought by United States they look for another card this card with the SDF now because when as it seems as you just mentioned we are moving forward in the different areas to defeat the terrorists the only problem left in Syria at the SDF we're going to deal with it by two option the first one we started now opening doors for negotiations but the majority of them are Syrians and supposedly they like their country they don't like to be puppet to any foreigners that what we suppose so we have the same basis we all don't trust the Americans for decades not because of the war but they only say thing and they do the opposite detail daily lies so we have one option is to live with each other a Syrian like forever this will first option if not we're going to resort to liberating by force to liberating both areas by force we don't have any other options would American or without Americans we don't have any other option so this is our land it's our right and it's our duty to deliver and the American should leave somehow they're going to leave they came to Iraq with no legal basis and look what happened to them they have to learn the lesson Iraq is no exception in Syria is no exception people will not accept foreigners in this region anymore with regards to retaking territory it seems inexplicably whenever you eliminate one threat say be it Goethe another threat seems to materialize and this has happened repeatedly now we have the Israeli Energy Minister who is threatening that his country could quote liquidate you and your government are you afraid are you afraid and how do you take that threat since we were born I'm talking about my generation and most of the generations and now in this area we lived under the threat of the Israeli aggression this is something in our unconscious feeling so to say that you're afraid while living with the same threat for the case this is nonsense Israeli has been assassinating killing occupying for decades now for more than seven indicates in in this region but usually they do all this without threatening now why do they treat one in this way this is panic this is kind of hysterical feeling because they are losing the dear ones the dear ones are Muslim and Isis that's why is right now is panicking recently and we understand their their feeling well Israel Israel is now seemingly striking across Syria airstrikes at will they're boasting publicly on camera again and again that your defenses they're powerless to stop them that they can do in Syria whatever they want is that true is there anything you can do to stop Israel carrying out its airstrikes in Syria yeah actually the first target of the mercenaries in Syria was the defense before attacking any other military base it was the air defense and you would be surprised at that time why do they attack the air defense their defense will not deal with the peaceful demonstrators they say over the moderate forces and it cannot deal with extremists anyway it's another thing is to defend the country they said the other proof that this rail was in direct link with those terrorists in in in Syria so they attacked those bases and they destroyed big part of our air defenses now in spite of that of our position let's say our air defense is much stronger than before thanks to the Russian support and the recent attacks by the Israeli and by the American and British and French proved that we are in bitter situation now the only option my answer to your question is to improve our air defense this is the only thing that we can do and we are doing that well Israel says that it's strikes are so far that they aren't targeted against you the president of the government that they're targeted at Iran there to keep a rare Iran which is your ally week in in Syria it's it's it's strange but Iran being here they are your allies it's no secret they have helped but then being here now puts you at threat would you ever consider asking around to leave the most important fact regarding this issue that we don't have Iranian troops we never had and you cannot hide it and we were not ashamed to say that we have like where we invited the Russians we could have invited the Iranians we have Iranian officers who work with the Syrian army as a help but they don't have the troops and the starkest fact about their lives about this issue the Iranian issue that the recent attack few weeks ago they said that they attacked Iranian bases and camps and they said allegedly and actually we had tens of Syrians martyrs and wounded soldiers not a single Iranian so how could they say that we have it so it's it's a lie we always hear that we have Iranians officers but they were with our army we don't have troops Oh changing subject now with regard to chemical attacks there are now regular alleged chemical attacks happening in Syria you government and your allies have said that you had nothing to do with this your allies have backed your claims saying denying you know any responsibility saying they have no knowledge of you carrying these carrying out these attacks the question is in who is interest is it to gas opposition to you that the most part of the answer in whose interest that the question is it in our interest why and do I know because the timing of this elect alleged strike was after the victory of the Syrian troops in gota let alone the fact that we don't have chemical weapons anyway and let the other fact that we're not going to use it against our people because the battle in Syria was about winning the heart of the civilians they said the main battle and we want it so how can you use chemical weapons against civilians that you want them to be supportive to you this is for a second if you want to use it let's support that you have it you want to use it do you use it after you finish the battle or before or during it's not logical second if you go to that area it was very cramped area by armies by factions and by civilians we never use such armaments or weapons in that area are going to harm everyone something that didn't happen and if you go to that area and yes the civilian there was no chemical attack by anyone even the Western journalists who went there after the Goethe was liberated they said we are the people they said we need we didn't see any chemical attack so it was an art if it was just pretext in order to attack Syria well it may have been a pretext but we have we now have proof that you know even mere rumors on Twitter a few videos of confusing videos of showing allegedly the aftermath of an attack is enough to justify for the United States its allies launching cruise missiles at Syria what if conveniently there's another attack alleged attack could there be a lot more missiles aimed at Syria of course it could because when the United States trampled over the international law on daily basis sometimes in different areas for different reasons any country in the world could have such an attack what the legal days of this attack were delicate lays out their aircraft with their alliance the so-called anti-terrorist alliance that support the terrorists actually what the legal basis of that alliance nothing what the illegal date of the attack in Yemen in Afghanistan on the border with Pakistan etc there's no legal base so as long as you don't have international law that could be obeyed by United States and its puppets in the West there's no guarantee that it won't happen that happen few weeks ago and that happened last year in in April 2017 and that could happen any time exactly I agree with you but the response Trump promised was going to be extreme and severe according to his words early on the response that we saw the strike that we saw after the latest alleged chemical attack was it seemed to be much more symbolic much smaller in scope and that was inexplicably again a delay when Trump promised the attack and when it came why was there a delay did it have something perhaps to do with the Russians it has two aspects as we as we saw it the first one they told the story they told the lie and the public opinion around the world and in the West didn't buy their story but they couldn't with a draw so they had to do something even on smaller scale the second issue related to the Russian position position that as you know that Russia announced publicly that they're going to destroy the bases that is going to be used to launch missiles and our information we don't have evidence we only have information and those informations are credible informations that they were thinking about comprehensive attack all over Syria and that's why the threat push the West to make it once much smaller scale well with regards to the United States relation towards you president Trump has called you quote animal Assad do you have a nickname for the US president yeah this is not my language so I cannot use similar language this is his language it represents him I think there's a very known principle that what you see is what you are so you wanted to present what he is anyway it didn't move anything and it's this kind of language shouldn't move anything in for for for anyone the only thing that moves you is what people that you trust people who are level-headed people who are thoughtful people who are moral ethical that what should move anything inside you whether positive or negative somebody like Trump will move nothing for me well regards the United States presence here and this is this an interesting thing you know I came up with the thought up of a while ago there are now in Syria forces from five nuclear powers five nuclear powers directly engaged in military operations in Syria beat boots on the ground or air strikes and some of those countries are in different sides how Syrian is this civil war still the word civil civil war has been used widely in the beginning of the conflict in Syria even by our friends and by by our allies by mistakes without understanding in the content of this meaning Syrian a Syrian civil war means there are sectarian lines based on either ethnicities or sex or religion or maybe political opinion or political currents let's say something with something we don't have in Syria a reality in the area controlled by the government which is not the majority of Syria you have all these diversity all these diversity so the word civil war is not correct what we have actually from the very beginning mercenaries Syrians and foreigners being paid by the West in order to topple the government this is the reality of the me reality the very stark reality everything else is just masks to cover the real intentions talking about political differences moderates a peaceful administration we don't have civil war in Syria if we have two laws of for seven years we should have been divided by now you cannot have one country United country United Society if not geographically because now the United States puppets and director of it without that we should have it divided socially go by ourselves do a different spectrum of the scene aside and you can answer that question in the same way emissary now but with with regards to a potential escalation okay there are proxy forces from all these five nuclear powers as well as their own forces engaged in Syria but you is the president again must have information how close have we come during the Civil War during this war to an escalation between these nuclear powers in reality we were close to have direct conflict between the Russian forces and the American forces and fortunately it was it has been avoided not by the wisdom of the American leadership by the wisdom of the Russian leadership because it's not in the interest of anyone anyone in this world and first of all the Syrian to have this conflict we need the Russian support but we need at the same time to avoid the American foolishness in order to be able to destroy stabilize our country and just briefly one last question the closer we get to the end is the danger of an escalation in your estimation is the decreasing or is it on the other hand increasing as I said the very beginning the more we get close to the end the more they want to make it further what does it mean the more stability you have the more escalation we'll have the more reconciliation you have in one area the more killing and destruction and and trying to do to capture more areas by the terrorists will have that's why within the reconciliation when we start to do conciliations in many area the other factions in the same area tried to destroy it because they have two orders from the outside not to go toward any reconciliation of course these you have the orders with a pocket of money so you know what you say is correct but the more escalation we have the more determined will be to solve the problem because you don't have any other choice other you have country or you don't have country it's the president thank you very much for your insights and thank you very much for welcoming me welcoming us here and giving us so much of your time we wish you all the best the Syrian people who the best and a swift conclusion to this to this awful conflict thank you very much mr. president thank you thank you for coming to see it again you
