rate in just minutes alrighty so the world waits aghast as we find out more about the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh of course president films pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court and he was considered the establishment pick let us recall I had serious questions about judge Brett Kavanaugh on policy grounds but there seemed to be no real question about him on character grounds this is a Catholic father of multiple girls this is a guy who had been very active in his community this is somebody who coached his girls bath ball team and now there's an accuser who has come forward her name is Christine Ford and she has come forward and she suggests that back when Brett Kavanaugh was 17 years old and she was 15 years old at an unspecified party an unspecified date at an unspecified location he lay on top of her tried to rip off her bathing suit covered her head her hand her mouth with his hand in an attempt to stifle her screams and then somehow she escaped and that's the accusation and they're a bunch of things to be noted about this accusation first of all he was 17 at the time and she was 15 according to her this is why it's good to go to juvenile court when stuff like this happens because for a lot of juvenile crimes these the record time this sort of thing would be sealed right I mean we wouldn't we have a general presumption with regard to teenagers that teenagers are to be granted a little bit more leeway now listen I'm not somebody who actually likes that argument a whole heck of a lot depending on the nature and severity of the crime I think there are a lot of cases in which teens ought to be tried as adults we talk about rape or murder but in this particular case the FBI was told about this and they can't even check it out because there is no alleged crime that has taken place like they don't even know what alleged crime would rise to the federal level as I mentioned yesterday and they have no facts to go on here and she has no facts that she has provided that would actually allow for a specific investigation of what exactly happened over here and what's even worse her lawyers are now basically attempting to prevent her from from saying anything of interest about it her own lawyer said that it's not important for her to provide corroboration for her story her lawyer basically said her name is Deborah Katz she says basically that that this woman has no obligation to probably provide any evidence that these accusations are even true she can just throw it out there and we're all supposed to believe it without any further corroboration has your client spoken to any of those other guys or that girl who could help corroborate her story she's not and why not is it time to do that that's that's not her job to do that if this is going to be investigated it should be done by investigators okay well what exactly is that supposed to mean the FBI can't investigate she hasn't given any corroborating details who's supposed to investigate this and the left is using the FBI as though they're the super secret police the FBI is a law enforcement body tasked with the enforcement of federal law they are not the great master detectives it's not like there's a regular detective and then there's Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes is the FBI that's not how this thing works it's not we don't have enough evidence to actually show something happen but the FBI they will ferret out the truth it's funny how the left has come to rely on the FBI this way as opposed to you know actually holding hearings on this issue so yesterday Senator Chuck Grassley invited the the alleged victim Christine Blasi Ford invited her to speak in front of the Senate committee and supposedly she accepted according to CNN the Republican leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday he would convene remarkable new public hearings in a week's time after sexual assault allegations emerged against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both Cavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of physical and sexual assault Christine Blasi Ford will testify before the panel setting up a blockbuster event that could decide Cavanaugh's fate the announcement made under pressure from lawmakers to fully examine the new claims will delay what had been a glide path toward confirmation for president Trump's nominee the political stakes for the White House and members of Congress are enormous as the me2 movement galvanizes women ahead of key congressional elections in November now make no mistake the only thing left wants out of this is withdrawn Kavanagh nomination in the hopes that somehow for some desperate reason Democrats will take the Senate in November and by the time Trump can nominate somebody else and go through the process it will be a Democratic Senate that can reject the nominee that's the actual plan here it has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh it has nothing to do with the seriousness of the charges the Democrats are not treating the charges seriously Dianne Feinstein who originally received these receive these in July she did nothing for eight weeks for eight weeks she did nothing nothing she didn't tell her Senate Democratic colleagues she'd until the rest of the Senate shouldn't ask any questions of Cavanaugh in writing or in person she never phone call with Cavanaugh she didn't talk to the lady presumably right all that happened is that she received this letter she sat on it and then just before the confirmation she decided to release it in a last-ditch attempt to hold off the hearings as long as possible so that this would stretch beyond the next election cycle that's all that is happening right here and how do we know that because now it is obvious that the Democrats are simply using delay tactics so there's ten Democrats the Judiciary Committee Democrats put out a statement yesterday and they said this with only a few hours notice and over the objections of ranking member Feinstein Judiciary Committee Republicans scheduled a staff level phone call with Brett Kavanaugh concerning allegations sexually assaulted a young woman in view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations a staff only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate this isn't how things should be done and is in complete violation of how this committee has worked in the past the FBI has the resources and know-how to conduct an objective independent evaluation of these sensitive allegations with appropriately trained investigators this isn't just about an interview it's about analyzing information and gathering the facts that's what the FBI does and that's why they're in charge of the background review process except that the FBI has already kicked this to the White House they said we have no basis for investigation here what the hell are you talking about so Democrats are throwing this to the FBI so that they can avoid actually going forward with hearing that might clear this up their entire goal is to smear Brett Kavanaugh whether this woman is telling the truth or not that is not relevant to the Democrats the Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee are obviously engaged in political brinksmanship here this has nothing to do with guilt or innocence it has nothing to do it the truth of the charges is one of the most scurrilous political tacks I've ever seen whether she's telling the truth or not because Democrats don't actually want to get at the truth that's what's obvious from this procedural maneuvering they're not doing this because they want to know what actually happened they're not doing this because they think Brett Kavanaugh ought to be kicked off because they believe the charges they're doing this because they want a delay so that they can stop whoever Trump nominates that's all this is this isn't about Cavanaugh versus Christine Blasi Ford this is about roe v wade this is about Democrats want to uphold what they believe to be a left majority on the Supreme Court now the irony is that Cavanaugh probably wouldn't vote to overturn roe v wade in the first place but that doesn't actually matter for Democrats it is important they stop whatever this nomination is the Democrats continue they say if that review is closed we call on the FBI to reopen it and properly investigate this new important information like based on what again based on what if you're the FBI how do you possibly look at charges that are so unspecific we don't know date we don't know time we don't know location we don't know in maybe year or I mean I guess that the the accusation is summer of 1982 summer of 1982 in an unspecified place what does the FBI supposed to do with that use a time machine this isn't and this isn't Minority Report hey Tom Cruise's in the back room with a bunch of weird goo people to figure out what's gonna happen in the future and prevent future crime that's not how this works but of course the Democrats know that this is all a cynical ploy III do love how Democrats are playing all of this they say that she is absolutely believable what makes her absolutely believable that it's useful my Barbara Boxer who is just an idiot former senator from the state of California she was on MSNBC she was the stupidest woman in the United States Senate she's no longer there now it's Feinstein and Kamala Harris Feinstein is smart Kamala Harris is not Barbara Boxer says we should believe this woman why should you believe this woman well because we should believe this woman but why you ask well because we should there's Barbara Boxer explaining this woman is to be believed Ana issue is one of the most incredible people I know in this world she has a heart of gold and she's sharp she knows after sitting with that woman you can believe Ana issue and you can believe dr. Ford this was attempted rape and this is a woman who exhibits dr. Ford courage but the classic signs of post-traumatic stress what in the world yeah again where's the evidence that is true well the evidence is that she wants it to be true and we've seen this on both sides of the aisle right we've seen that there are folks on the right who are like oh well I don't believe the Roy Moore allegations why don't you believe multiple women something like eight women who testified he used to hit on fourteen-year-old girls what because I don't believe them but why well because in this particular case I don't know who to believe right I don't know who to believe I think there are holes in her story that need to be filled I think that the the Democrats are playing politics with this but Democrats are all fired sure that this woman's allegations are real why well because it's politically convenient here's Chuck Schumer I think the allegations of Professor Ford are extremely credible yeah she took a lie-detector test she talked to this to her therapist they were having family counseling in part because of what happened to her five years ago and told all the details and third to come out and say something like this puts you and your family through incredible scrutiny people throw brick bats at you and everything else she do it on a whim I don't think she did it for political reasons so she has a great deal of credibility okay this is this argument that a woman has a great deal of credibility because she has a lot to lose coming forward who has more to lose christine Blasi for tor Judd Brett Kavanaugh who's not only going to lose his career but also a spot in the Supreme Court if we're gonna talk about people who have something to lose and who are risking a lot here it's Kavanaugh not Christine Blasi Ford who's being held up as a heroine for all of this now I'm not saying emotionally it's not difficult for her to come forward and again I'm gonna say it for the 1,000 time it's quite possible she's telling the truth but I don't know and you don't know and nobody knows because the only people in that room even allegedly well Brett Kavanaugh and Mark charge both of whom deny and this woman Brett Kavanaugh by the way says he wasn't even at a party he says he wasn't even at that party and the left says well how does he know which party she's talking about unless he knows the party well maybe he wasn't at a party it's pretty blanket claim I should be easy to debunk if the Democrats think they can debunk it so why can't they to bunk it because they don't feel they needed a bunk it this is all politics and I'll talk in a minute about about the lie detector side of this well what Chuck Schumer has to say right there because it's just asinine but first let's talk about the possibility of natural disaster so you're watching tropical depression Florence bad or the East Coast people who are holed up in their houses maybe have no place to go and you hope that everybody is stocked up you hope that everybody is able to take care of their family well you should be one of those people when there is some sort of disaster no power refrigeration failing stores closed this is when it would be good to have some emergency food on hand I trust my Patriots apply for dependable food storage and you should as well every person in your household should have at least a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply this week they're offering a special price of only 75 bucks for a food kit that contains ninety two servings of breakfasts lunches and dinners call eight eight eight eight oh three 14 13 or go to my special website prepare with been calm the food lasts up to 25 years in storage only 75 bucks that includes a rugged tote order now 888 803 1413 or prepare with been calm again that's eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or prepare with been calm go check it out right now you should be prepared in case of emergency your family should be prepared the government tells you you ought to be prepared so you should go check it out right now and make sure that you are in case god forbid you're gonna need to use it eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen prepare with been calm again 75 bucks for ninety two servings of breakfast lunch and dinners check it out right now prepare with been calm so you heard Chuck Schumer there say that this woman took a lie-detector test who cares why detectives are inadmissible in court they do not actually prove whether someone is lying or not according to LiveScience a polygraph is not a lie detector and it never was a polygraph detects physiological expressions associated with lying in some people such as a racing heart and sweaty fingers the determination of truth versus falsehood is a subjective interpretation by the polygraph examiner so when people say that there's a they took a polygraph that doesn't mean anything it legitimately means nothing it's not even admissible in court and you know this is now proof that she's absolutely telling the truth by the way she could be telling you the truth about what she thinks she believes people people actually over time people have memories of events that are not necessarily the most accurate but you start to believe that that was your memory of the event because memories change over time I'm not even accusing this woman of bad faith all I'm saying is that if there's no corroborate of evidence there is no way to suggest that she is more believable than Brett Kavanaugh so president Trump responds to these accusations here's what President Trump has to say judge Kavanagh is one of the finest people that I've ever known he's an outstanding judge respected by everybody never had even a little blemish on his record the FBI has I think gone through a process six times with him over the years where he went to higher and higher positions he is somebody very special okay this is just it is cynical garbage and how can you tell that it's cynical garbage the way the Democrats are playing this again not the accusation the way the Democrats are playing it how can you tell it's cynical garbage listen to Donna Brazile donna brazile was the head of the DNC briefly before it turned out that she was feeding tube eight questions allegedly to Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders and then she was ousted well she's still a respected figure in democratic circles for some odd reason but here's Donna Brazile explain that this in a nutshell is why democrats are doing this democrats are doing this as a delay tactic they are obvious about it they are not hiding the ball here is donna Brazile explaining does that sound right to you about a one-in-three chance of winning son absolutely look at the beginning of this cycle we we thought that the Republicans would taste 60 seats in the Senate but Democrats are doing well in states that Donald Trump won in 2016 Jill Manchin is doing very well so yes we we're confident not overconfident but confident that we can run the tables in the Senate that's what this is about delay it until they run the table in the Senate then they have a majority then they can reject Brett Kavanaugh or anyone else Trump nominates and keep the Supreme Court seat open until after 2020 claiming that Trump is under FBI investigation which he is not and therefore that President Trump has no ability to appoint a Supreme Court justice now listen the Republicans know what's going on here right Mitch McConnell knows what's going on here so the Senate Majority Leader he says listen it's it's obvious what's happening here Democrats waited until the eleventh hour to dump this allegation specifically an attempt to scuttle Cavanaugh this is not about getting to the truth in any real way yet chose to keep secret until the 11th hour neither she nor any of her Democratic colleagues chose to raise this allegation during the committee staffs bipartisan background calls with a nominee all of this is true what what he is saying and it is absurd the lengths to which left is going on this when I say it's absurd I mean legitimately absurd so now they have people like Louis Julia louis-dreyfus signing letters in support of the accuser what the hell does the veep star have to do with anything the answer is nothing the answer is nothing she signed a letter signed by 200 women from this woman's high school who say quote we believe dr. Blasi Ford and are grateful that she came forward to tell her story so the hell what my gardener signed a letter in favor of Judge Brett Kavanaugh oh my pool guy signed a letter in favor of Judge Brent Cavanaugh and what in the world does Julia Julia Louie Dreyfus have to do with any of this was she presents the party nope did she know Brett Kavanaugh nope she once went to a high school that this woman also at one point attended Wow whoo I went to Walter Reed junior middle school okay if I went to Walter Reed and somebody else went to Walter Reed well that means that if I sign a letter having to do with that person even if they graduated 20 years before I went there that means I have additional credibility on what they did in a bedroom that I haven't heard of 20 years but 36 years beforehand maybe before I was born I should do that I should I went to Harvard Law School any time anything happens that is scandalous about a Harvard Law alum and it happened before I was born in heav'nly 1955 I should sign a letter saying I don't believe this man as an alum of their law school this is the length to which left is going and it's it's so absurd that it may it actually undercuts this woman it hurts the me2 movement the media movement was all about the believability and credibility of women the idea was if a woman says something we should initially give it credibility and then we should go examine the evidence to try and confirm the story but we shouldn't dismiss her story out of hand as many people are sometimes want to do that was the case of the meaty movement instead Democrats by cynically using an accusation that has no corroborating evidence to this point none okay the first time this was ever reported to anyone who is not her husband in 2002 was 2012 30 years after the event instead of actually holding all of our accusations and accusers to the same standard of evidence now the Democrats are cynically playing politics it is obvious that they just want to believe what they want to believe here the best example that I can spot is from Anna Marie Cox who was on MSNBC last night again the fact that anyone takes Anna Marie Cox seriously is beyond me but she was on MSNBC last night on Laurens horizontals show and she explains it doesn't matter whether Cavanaugh is guilty or innocent the only thing that matters is whether in the hearings he's nice to the woman III I legitimately cannot make up what she's about to say here's what she says a parallel here is that we need to judge Brett Kavanaugh not just on what he may or may not have done but how he treats a woman's pain and that is something I'm gonna paying attention to on Monday now I'll give you a spoiler alert I don't think Brett Kavanaugh takes women's pain very seriously and I know that because of the decisions he's made as a judge but I think that for have that unfold on national television live and will be quite instruction instructive I don't flip people off on this show but you have no idea how tempted I am to throw up a double burden at that one I mean that is just disgusting that's disgusting so if a woman accuses me like Ben Shapiro the woman accuses me of rape and I say she's totally full of crap this is made up for political purposes then Anna Marie Cox's question is going to be do I treat her pain with respect I'm falsely alleged to have committed rape or a ten did rape and I'm supposed to treat that woman's accusations with her pain with respect that's how you gonna judge it and you're going to prejudge how I treat that woman based on the facts that I have ruled in the past in ways you don't like on judicial cases and then you have the gall to say this isn't a political maneuver is it a political hit job again they're undermining this woman when this first came out I said this woman is not uncredible I said it yesterday on the show and now the way the Democrats are treating this woman makes me think she is less credible just because of the way Democrats are treating her things they're treating her as a political football that statement for an Anna Marie Cox is just morally abysmal morally disreputable disgusting repulsive repugnant I'm going through the full thesaurus here Hey I lose capacity for speech and how disgusting it is to suggest that if you are falsely accused of a crime your activity in feeling the pain of the person falsely accusing you in your view is really the main consideration here not your guilt or innocence doesn't matter if the person is lying about you or got it wrong the only thing that matters is how nice you are about it when you deny it my god my god these people and she has no shame have these people no sense of decency or shame just unbelievably absurd unbelievably absurd okay in just a second I'm gonna get to some more response by Democrats to all this plus we'll take a look at the polls and president Trump says that he is going to declassify a lot of the Russia gate materials who will get to all of that and the Emmy so we have a lot coming up still on the show but first I want to talk to you about talk to you about boosting your energy level and boosting your cognition we live in a

down so matthew dowd is the supposed conservative analyst on ABC political news he's on their sunday shows a lot and matthew dowd tweeted out this regarding the Brett Kavanaugh accusations and this is why you wonder why the meanto movement is breaking down what the left has a tendency to do but the left has a tendency to do is take issues where we are unified and then pick cases where there is not enough evidence for unity to be to be merited and then claim that lack of unity on this particular case demonstrates lack of unity on the underlying issue here's what I mean the left will say shooting police shooting black people in racist fashion is bad and people on the right go that's of course of course and then the left will say Michael Brown was a gentle giant who's shot in cold blood in the back by a white police officer and the rail go well that's not true that's not none of those things are true and the left will say you don't take that crime seriously enough if you took that crime seriously enough you would believe what I have to say and this just shows that the underlying issue you don't care about you don't care about racist shootings doesn't matter that you thought that it was a racist shooting when Walter Scott was shot in the back in South Carolina doesn't matter that you think the falando Casteel shooting was a bad shoot doesn't matter that you can name off the top of your head five six police shootings of people that are racially suspect at best if you don't agree with me on this fringe case where the evidence is not on my side it demonstrates you don't have any care about the underlying issue hey that's the way the left likes to play these things and they're doing the same thing with regard to the meat see movement folks on the right are not in favor of sexual assault god forbid that's insane that's insane hey I'm the most sexually pure person that I have ever heard of in secular culture in the religious community okay I'm pretty common but in the non-religious community I'm a dude who has had sex with one woman ever and it's my wife and it was after we were married and I was 24 and got married so I'm pretty good about this stuff I believe that rapists should be castrated or killed I think rape is a worse crime than murder in many cases I think sexual abuse is the worst thing you can do to a human being basically and the implication is if I have questions about this woman's account because there's not enough evidence to verify it that this means I don't care about sexual assault that's how the me2 movement falls apart that's how you take an issue where 90% of Americans agree and turn it into an issue or 55 percent of Americans agree and the left likes to do this the left wants to do this I don't know only it's just the left by the way I think that on the right there's a tendency to do this with regard to the American flag for example I think most Americans are not in favor of kneeling for the American flag President Trump by injecting himself into the American flag kneeling situation he may be technically right but he's also allowing a polarization around a specific issue that's not good for the country the left does this on far less of an evidentiary basis than Trump does about kneeling for the flag the left picks cases like this Christine Ford case where all we're saying is can we see some more evidence and they say well if you don't just believe the woman it's because you don't care about sexual assault if you don't just see and believe here and believe and that means you don't care enough about women Matthew Dowd plays this game he says it was despicable and outrageous what happened to Anita Hill more than 25 years ago and a sexual predator was given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court by the way never been proved that Clarence Thomas is a sexual predator I mentioned yesterday there are a lot of holes in a Nita Hills story there are a lot of holes in the time at the time and Anita Hills story she originally wanted to be anonymous before she came forward once she came forward there are a bunch of problems with her story including the witnesses she talked to including the fact that she called Clarence Thomas many many times over many years after the supposed incidents Matthew Dowd doesn't care he just labels Clarence Thomas a sexual predator he said let's hope history doesn't repeat itself in 2018 this is the supposed conservative a day ABC and then he continues and he says I don't know if the allegations against Kavanagh are true but keep in mind every high-profile men accused of sexual abuse denies it and has released a list of women saying they're a good guy and each one turned out to be an abuser so let me get this straight if you don't deny it and you don't provide a list of character witnesses you're guilty if you do deny it and you provide a list of character witnesses you're guilty this is the Monty Python which test if we throw her in the water and she's heavier than a duck and she floats and she must be a witch right that this is it how can you have any semblance of justice under these conditions how can you have any semblance of sanity or certitude or decency under these conditions and then matthew dowd continually says enough with the he-said she-said storyline if this is he-said she-said then let's believe the she in these scenarios why why like really white without any corroborate of evidence i just are women inherently more believable i don't like i don't i don't understand the logic here I thought the basis of feminism is that men and women are to be treated exactly the same way if that's the case then why should we believe the woman over the man if he denies and she says it happened and there's no corroborate of evidence well I need I'm more than willing to believe her story if she can even provide any corroborating evidence but you're providing none and then saying we should just believe the story she then he says this is one of their favorite things she has nothing to gain and everything to lose really she has nothing to gain what's that book deal gonna be like at the end of this story what's the TV deal gonna be like at the end of this story Anita Hill had everything to gain Anita Hill is a famous human she had an HBO full-on movie made about her and Clarence Thomas because supposedly he once said something about a pubic hair on a coca can hey this is it again this woman may be telling the truth for the 1,000 and first time during this program she may be telling the truth but it is not true to suggest that she has nothing to gain and everything to lose Matthew dad says for 250 years we have believed that he in these scenarios enough is enough really I didn't always believe that he in these scenarios like I think that Bill Clinton probably rape ellonija Broderick I'm not believing that he in these scenarios I think that Roy Moore was preying on girls I got I I think that Donald Trump has abused women like I where is he getting this and the answer he's getting this from nowhere he's just looking for any sort of slim read to hang his hat on here this is gross stuff and again all of this has to do with electoral politics right now Republicans are having a tough time in the in polls the election polls show right now the Democrats have the upper hand in Arizona and Tennessee in the Senate races Kyrsten Sinema who is a real radical in Arizona now has a slight lead over martha mcsalley in the latest CNN poll it shows that she is beating her by seven points 50% to 43% in Tennessee there's a candidate named Phil Bredesen who is the former governor and he holds a five-point edge over Marsha Blackburn 50% to 45 percent among likely voters there yeah some of this has to do with the President of the United States and the fact is that bob Corker would still be running in Tennessee if Donald Trump hadn't basically destroyed him and in Arizona President Trump has made himself unpopular by attacking John McCain and such so martha mcsalley is paying a polling price but if arizona goes blue and tennessee goes blue that is a bad indicator that's a bad indicator right now the chances that the Democrats take the Senate are not horrendous they're about the same as the chances that Donald Trump was going to win the presidency in 2016 according to 538 in just a second I'm gonna discuss some of those statistics and give you the latest breakdown on the Senate and why Democrats are so eager to vote plus we'll talk about President Trump revealing some new FISA documents and stormy Daniels describing the president's junk life hack dudes if you don't want people who aren't your wife describing your junk you probably shouldn't show your junk to people who aren't your wife really it's it's a life hack the description I will say it made me laugh I mean I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie about this and sure it's its era of Yom Kippur sure it's the night before the night of Yom Kippur but if I can't get in a little bit of dirty-minded frippery before the holiday then you're under estimating maybe we'll get to that in just one second but first let's talk about saving money

podcast in the nation so the reason the Democrats trying to hold off on Kavanagh as I've been saying this entire time is because they're hoping they win the Senate according to 538 many of the individual race forecast in the 538 Senate model which launched on Wednesday look pretty optimistic for Democrats the model shows Manchin in strong position to retain his seat in West Virginia it has Democrats as slight favorites to win GOP seats in Nevada and Arizona it thinks Democratic incumbents like Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp could close well down the stretch it even gives bethe O'Rourke a credible shot in Texas although Cruz remains the favorite in that race right now 538 House forecast is there is a four and five chance Democrats win control of Congress a one in five chance that Republicans keep control of Congress and when you take a look at their Senate forecast their Senate forecast basically say that there is a two in three shot that Republicans maintain the Senate but there's a one in three shot that Republican the Republicans lose the Senate but 538 says the Senate model basically suggests Republicans have between a two and three and a seven in ten chance to hold the Senate depending on which version of their model they're looking at that's because the Senate map is really really bad for Democrats it's about as unfavorable a map as any party has faced in the Senate ever Democrats have 26 seats up for election in November Republicans have just 9/10 of those 26 seats are in states Trump won in 2016 including five states where he won overwhelmingly so Democrats could win the popular vote for the US House by eight to nine percentage points and they still would not win the Senate instead they need about an 11-point advantage in the House popular vote before they become favorites to claim the Senate but it's possible that Republicans could lose the Senate and Democrats know this and this is why they are attempting to push this this vote off on Kavanagh as long as humanly possible so the Tailwind could be strong enough to carry them also they're 11 seats that each party has at least a 10 percent chance of winning Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Mississippi Montana and North Dakota Nevada Tennessee Texas and West Virginia Democrats need eight of those eleven to take the Senate so Democrats you know have a have a micro path in a macro path as 5:38 says and it is worth noting that Democrats are highly motivated right now if Republicans do not turn out to vote they could lose the Senate and then Trump has a Democratic Congress the last two years of his first term which is a disaster for president he's gonna be fighting investigations at every possible turn impeachment hearings will probably be held things will get very ugly very quickly consents the Democrats are really mobilized in the way the consents this is from people like Charles Blow who has a piece titled not to range determined the piece spoiler alert is actually kind of deranged it says they told us that we suffered from trumped arrangement syndrome this of course is in the New York Times an emotional and illogical obsession with opposing and unseating Donald Trump they saw our principled stand against corruption and criminality against immorality and hatred has borne of hyper partisanship and the bruises of defeat they were unable to see that our objection to Trump was an aiklen League particular phenomenon that transcended party tribalism and went to the core of who we are as people and as a country for us it was clear this man was wholly unacceptable as a matter of character and through patriotism demanded that we say so without equivalent out equivocation and unrelentingly and this is the feeling that you get I mean I live in California which means that you see a lot of folks in California who feel this way democratic turnout is gonna be very high Republicans cannot be sanguine Republicans have to turn out to vote doesn't matter whether you like Trump or not the only thing that matters at this point is ensuring Republicans keep the Senate if you do not want emma-crats to hold the Supreme Court at 8:00 and then wait until Justice Anthony Kennedy is replaced in 2021 by Justice Elizabeth Warren right you gotta be very worried about this if you are a Republican or a conservative in any way meanwhile President Trump is moving forward with declassification of documents related to the FISA warrant on Carter page according to Politico and I've been waiting the furthest for a long time I keep saying why doesn't Trump just release the documents if in fact the FBI was wrongly surveilling Carter page if in fact our nation's law enforcement bodies were targeting the Trump campaign Trump has the ability to declassify all this and he should and he should if he's got the goods let's see the goods well it appears the Trump is now moving toward the revelation of those goods which I think adds some credibility to his accusations here's what Trump say here's what Politico says about all of this president from moved on Monday to immediately release a tranche a former FBI director James Comey 'he's text messages and Declassified 20 pages of a surveillance application the targeted former campaign adviser Carter page Trump's latest offensive against a Russia investigation that has ensnared associates and has consumed his attention for much of his presidency the breadth of the order came as a surprise and landed him in a full court White House effort to shore up the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh Trump demanded the FBI produced twenty pages of the surveillance application which Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested would help show anti-trump bias at the highest levels of the FBI we're not gonna be able to actually analyze how bad the Carter page FISA warrant is until we actually see it but the fact that Trump wants to reveal more of it not less of it is an indicator that at least he thinks that something nefarious was going on Devin Nunez who's been really pushing this at the house Government Oversight Committee he says that a shocking number of people have bought the conspiracy theories and the real conspiracy here is that the FBI was basically targeting team Trump but you are you are slowly starting to see this collapse in on them even though the mainstream media is not covering this because they seem so focused on drinking the Russian kool-aid on terms of what's who's getting indicted by the special counsel and instead focus on look was there any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia which the answer is no so okay so if will suits in the documents and there's another case where I'm gonna do the unpopular thing and say I'm gonna wait to see the actual documents before I jump to the FBI was targeting Trump but the fact that Trump wants to release more now less is an indicator that at least he thinks he has some of the goods on the so-called deep state targeting him well in just a second we're gonna talk about stormy Daniels at long last and her accusations in her new book because she's a feminist here Owen let me tell you she is she is just a hero for the ages we'll talk about that in just one second so here is stormy Daniels has a new book coming out because you have to read a book by a porn star I mean come on this is a woman who has forged her way using nothing but grit and her genitals toward the toward the head of American public life is a woman who was featured on Saturday Night Live telling President Trump to step down because she had consensual sex with him a couple of times I mean just amazing stuff from stormy generals so the new book is called full disclosure and it's now been obtained by the UK Guardian which is the source of choice for all left winners and basically the Guardian acts as sort of a conduit for a lot of left mu0 their prerogative it's a left-wing newspaper in it Daniel's describes her mounting disbelief has Trump began to win primary contests in 2016 for the Republican presidential nomination former castmates whom she had not heard from in years but who had heard her story about sleeping with Trump in 2006 would call her up to marvel at the news as Trump kept winning Daniels right she began to think she might be in danger and this is where she starts telling her stories again about how she was threatened in 2011 by somebody associated with Trump and all the rest of this again providing little to no evidence that this ever happened she did take a one hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment from Team Trump to shut up about it and then of course she's getting a book deal so that'll be lucrative for her she continued to answer Trump's many phone calls over the next year after she had an affair with him back in 2006 in hopes that he would make good on his promise to put her on his reality television show The Apprentice Daniel writes Trump even suggested that a cheat could be arranged to allow her to survive through more episodes of the show quote we'll figure out a way to get you the challenges beforehand she quotes him as saying and we can devise your technique he was gonna have me cheat and it was a hundred percent his idea ooh ooh clearly he is the nefarious character here not you the porn star who had sex with a married man and then took a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to shut up about it and had sex with him in the hopes that you'd get on TV clearly the only bad character here is Trump now listen this is not me defending Trump I think Trump with regard to women is dirt I think he's terrible with regards the way he's treated women over the course of his life but stormy Daniels is not a nun hey stormy Daniels is not the paragon of female virtue she's not even the paragon of honesty come on and this is ridiculous Trump has denied any I love this she says whenever she saw Trump on television four years after where Daniels writes an internal monologue would play out I had sex with that I'd say to myself yeah because but you did like I write this was you you're not a victim lady I mean you decided you were gonna have sex with a married man because you don't care about sex that much and because you thought that would be worthwhile to get on the apprentice and then there's the part of the book that everybody cares deeply about this is her first sexual encounter with Donald Trump Trump's bodyguard invites Daniels to dinner which turns out to be an invitation to Trump's penthouse she writes in a description of alleged events that Daniels has clothes previously but which in the book are printed with new and lurid detail she describes Trump's genitals his penis has quote smaller than average but not freakishly small I'm so glad we're doing this Daniels writes he knows he has an unusual penis it has a huge mushroom head like a toadstool all right and she says I lay there a know that I was getting bleeped by a guy with Yeti pubes and a bleep like a mushroom character in Mario Kart it may have been the least impressive sex I'd ever had but clearly he didn't share that opinion yeah so now it's just she's trolling for Trump to respond to all of this and you know I wouldn't be surprised if Trump does respond to all this he just has to decide whether he looks more like Yoshi or or baby luigi down there like I just I don't understand I legitimately like this is this is where we are and I look forward to the point when we can be asked about all this on stage we don't have two presidents in my lifetime who've had their penises described in national publications right pot we now know what what what Bill Clinton's penis looked like according to Paula Jones but we now know what Donald Trump's penis looks like according to stormy Daniels and all I can say all I can say is that it might be worthwhile for a guys to keep it in their pants how about we start with that life hack keep your junk in your pants if you don't want people describing that junk publicly I do love though that storming Daniels is playing this is though she was some sort of victim she went there and she says you know Donald promised me that I'd be on the apprentice and Trump was probably like right the apprentice that's what I call my little guy I want to put you on the apprentice it's also salacious and gross but this is our politics this is the game we have chosen this is the politics we have chosen this is the business we have chosen ah good times good times okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate and things I hate will be combined with deconstructing the culture today so things I like on a much more serious note tonight is Yom Kippur so after all of that hilarity I'm gonna have to do a bit of atonement this evening and tomorrow and I'm gonna go from actually the most ridiculous stuff to the most serious stuff that ever happened there's a book that I read over Rosh Hashanah which is history of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and how I switch gears on this one is beyond me but the book is called the resistance by Israel Guttman who is the the head of the yad vashem museum dedicated to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising at least part of it and the book is sort of a comprehensive look at what happened during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 one of the great kind of heroic Jewish stories of all time the Nazis had shipped off the Warsaw Ghetto was in and of itself an enormous human rights violation basically four hundred thousand Jews were shipped into an area one mile square they were they were put nine into a room they were allotted 143 calories a person by the Nazis the Nazis basically wanted to starve them to death and then when the final solution was decided upon they started shipping all of these folks to Auschwitz after the first shipment to Auschwitz a group of Jews knowing they're gonna die anyway formed a resistance with pretty much no arms and they proceeded to hold off the Germans for weeks on end all the way from April 1919 and 43 into mid-may they held off the German army it's a pretty amazing story you can check it out Israel Gutman's the resistance there's also a pretty good movie that was made about this called uprising with about with I think Hank Azaria and Donald Sutherland and leelee sobieski I think the internet legally sobieski the the actress she's quite good it's it's a good movie so check that out as well it's real Guttman's resistance okay time for some things that I hate so one of the things that's very difficult about the Internet is that so many memes go around you're never sure what's real or not so there's a meme that was going around of Anderson Cooper standing in really deep water while his producer stood above him with a camera and we were supposed to believe that Anderson Cooper was sort of faking it that the the it was from Hurricane Ike in 2008 I believe and the implication was the Anderson Cooper was faking the footage that the water wasn't really all that deep and this followed on the heels of a lot of video from the current hurricane where you'd see like a weather person standing in front trying to brace against the wind then two dudes walking in the background like there was no big deal happening well the problem is that if you're gonna actually make those sorts of accusations you probably should back them up Anderson Cooper rightly is ticked off about this he says that entire segments was about how there are ditches underwater and that you can be walking along and not spot the ditch and go plunging right into the ditch here's Anderson Cooper explaining now over the weekend however the son of the president Donny jr. tweeted out this picture of me and waist-high water my camera crew a few feet away on higher ground in only a little bit of water Donny jr. was claiming it showed me in Florence faking the depths of flood waters in order to somehow harm his father and I quote from his tweet stop lying to try to make at real Donald Trump look bad he wrote now look I don't expect the president's son to ever admit he was wrong or one of the president's former advisors or frankly anyone else who's retweeted these pictures but I at least thought that they and you should know the truth okay and he's not wrong to be upset about that I will say that nowhere in that tweet from Donald Trump jr. does he actually accused Cooper of doing this during the current hurricane but the level vagary in the tweet is not a great thing and people should be careful about what they tweet you know we all make mistakes on Twitter cuz everything moves too fast here it's sort of retweet what comes across your page but if you're gonna make those sorts of accusations you ought to be clearer about it okay so meanwhile the Emmys happened last night and I'm not sure that anybody actually watched the Emmys I'm not sure what the ratings were like I can't imagine they were great but it was typical Hollywood leftist culture and as I've said many times what we have right now in America is a cultural divide that is reflecting itself in politics the left has taken the commanding heights and culture and the right responds by taking the commanding heights and politics they say you guys want to come for our guns you call us better clingers you call us to pleura bowls you call us all sorts of names and you know what we're gonna do we're gonna protect ourselves by ensuring that our politicians don't agree with you well that was underscored last night by just more politicking from the Emmys stage because they can't just give awards to people on the basis of non politics they have to talk politics naturally last-man-standing was cancelled by ABC and then picked up by Fox right which is great that's right and Roseanne was cancelled by herself but picked up by white nationalists all you know I heard Roseanne is actually moving to Israel Wow I mean damn how messed up is your life when you have to go to the Middle East just to get peace of mind okay now that that last joke is particularly stupid because Israel is actually a pretty good place to live in Israel how many of these folks in Hollywood have said that they want to pick up and move to Canada just because Trump had was elected in the first place that's a that's a really dumb point also ripping on Roseanne is sort of like your chief rip you know that she's picked up by white nationalists meanwhile half the people in the audience are engaged in sins various and sundry is a little bit absurd but that wasn't the extent of it the red carpet was replete with people in Hollywood virtue signaling for the SJW crowd I am wearing Nike to applaud them for supporting Colin Kaepernick and his protest against racial injustice and police brutality these are not dark times these are awakening times and we all have to wake up you can say something to Colin right now what would it be Thank You Colin thank you for all that you do thank you for being brave thank you for being courageous thank you for taking Anita thank you for making millions of dollars from a massive multinational corporation that uses cheap labor from abroad just that people can posture on red carpets well done Hollywood well done Hollywood can't imagine why anybody wouldn't trust you with the future of the country and the left doesn't understand that when they they insult the rest of the country culturally the country responds by putting people in power who they think will protect them from Hollywood you want to know what makes people in the middle of the country feel threatened the idea that folks on the Emmy stage will one day be in the halls of power again governing them that's what scares people in the middle of the country and and rightly so okay final thing that I hate this is so Thandie Newton was also at the Emmys and she had to drop this line it is very important to virtue signal about feminism and atheism at the same time from the stage so Santana Newton won an award for Westworld she was quite good in Westworld she's a terrific actress but here's what she had to say after winning Tandy I don't even believe in God but I'm gonna thank her tonight oh well I don't even believe in the Emmys but I'm going to laugh at them right now because like why do we possibly care what Thandie Newton thinks about God well the sort of disparaging remark that God is only God if if God is a woman and when we did this with ariana grande who did a song the same way and it was God as a woman but God was apparently a very highly sexualized woman performing for the pleasure of men's that was weird but again this sort of cultural sneering is is not going to be to Hollywood's benefit and I think that they haven't paid the price for it yet but they will at some point in the future speaking of which Sir Paul McCartney has a new song ripping president Trump as well his new song talks about how terrible President Trump is the song is called despite repeated warnings and it contains this jab against President Trump can we do what can I do a spoon so I think the Beatles are the most overrated band in history but this is much worse than the Beatles okay Paul McCartney on his own is much worse than the Beatles it's just a bad song and also this kind of blunderbuss approach this man is bound to lose his ship and his crew self-righteousness from people who can't read music is always weird to me like that just the musical self-righteousness of these folks again there are lots of reasons to criticize president Trump but our cultural better is informing us why President Trump ought not be trusted on politics when all assumed problem McCartney knows about music somewhat but I'm not going to assume he knows much about politics just because he writes songs like that I'm not sure from that song he knows much about music because the song sucks okay well we will be back here not tomorrow because tomorrow is Yom Kippur we will be back here on Thursday with all of the latest I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Sonia Villarreal
