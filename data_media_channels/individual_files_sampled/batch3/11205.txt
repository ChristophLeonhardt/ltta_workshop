previously on the great American pilgrimage well why can't we get a barge and put this RV on the barge and take it right out in the middle of Boston Harbor is that crazy ah what I brought a jet you saying I have to bring a barge to it's a pretty big ass yeah be funny if we dressed up as pilgrims yeah I would love for you to take Max Keiser the inner drop me off in the past hey everybody I'm Stephen Baldwin gosh you look fantastic Hollywood guy usual suspects my favorite movie proud American first of all I'm just as George Washington Shore and RV enthusiast uncle Steve this is my buddy max famous financial guru and well he's a little bit different last but not least my larger-than-life convenient an aspiring star Rio with all the drama happening in our great country I'm hitting the road to have some fun I mean everyday Americans wallet what's America our ancestors suffered the most let's see how things got so crazy I was naked completely naked my finger I'll hopefully start to bridge the gap this is the great American pilgrimage yo yo yo yo yo dude they're gonna be that fast okay for the pilgrimage teamwork you know we got it what do the whole Boston Harbor thing right I do believe there is a teapot here waiting us max well it's the final stretch of the pilgrimage and our heroes have set their sights on having a Boston Tea Party of their own max has narrowly escaped being left in the past and steven has kept alive his unrealistic expectations of a barge this is the most important part of from pilgrimage must have and with no word back from the masternode Stephen does his best to convince producers why the pilgrimage needs a barge and with the day winding down our heroes pull off to get some rest and clear their heads before the final day of the pilgrimage Stephen has decided to visit our producer at 2:00 a.m. what are you doing here hey buddy what about my barge what the barge curved the RV for the Boston Tea Party Toberman cheats the arch no question how am I gonna get him barged in twelve hours I don't know but we talked about it I told you I have to have it we need time for the money for a bar absolutely for tomorrow morning no way to have your own Boston Tea Party at the end of the pilgrimage without putting the RV on a barge into Boston Harbor has happened it's the great American pilgrims figure it out after a good night's sleep the pilgrimage heads back toward Boston and the pressure is on to find a last-minute barge for cheap so what we're trying to do is put a 31-foot RV a mobile home on top of a barge and ship it out to sea from the Boston Harbor right to a zip line zip line we may need paramedics that Bay or an ambulance boat just in case for our stunt that's probably a good idea I'm on it right now we're trying to shoot it today any any kind of help you can get it to help secure that that would be great all right thank you yes and just so just so I can explain to you we're looking to just put a 31-foot RZ okay all right and then these are probiotics buddy these are good for your tummy tell me if you don't find those to be delicious looks like everything's going great for the final day of the pilgrimage hey Robin yeah the sooner the better invite to join us I'm having her I'm sorry I'm having a hard time I'm having a hard time hearing you one second I'm just gonna adjust my my speaker one sec and then how much would it be on top of that so $20,000 all in all right sounds good you gotta figure it out oh we're right on top of this I've got a question what the ladies did the barge was gonna cost $15,000 at least but we're making progress sure yeah Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart with a solid plan in place and no means to pay for it our heroes finally arrived at the shipyard to get their barge with precision driving needed and to clear our producers of any liability it makes sense to put Steven behind the wheel my freakin idea who's behind me these guys watching me I'm out usually we'll open this thing when she's level are going down yeah yeah on a tight side yeah so how many you just explain to me exactly what's happening so basically you know we got this big mechanical ramp that drops down on the barge depending on what the tide is right now the tides a little high so we've got this kind of a situation where the ramp perfect world we wait for the right time she'd be level drive right on no problem off we go so just be Franklin is it gonna happen I don't know we'll see it can do some damage to the undercarriage we won't be able to drive it anymore after that the worst case scenario yeah you might damage something enough to get it towed off we're gonna give it our best shot as Steven looks on awaiting the fate of his Tea Party he is reminded of the early days on the pilgrimage and the obstacles he's had to overcome since then back when we started in Venice California Steven never imagined the challenges that would have come along the way what do you think I mean the word that came to mind for me was pilgrimage exactly the great American pilgrimage as me God yeah road trip this is our worst nightmare I might be late for my own pilgrimage that's gonna be brilliant okay you got they like it get them for tops seat belt first words my daughter Haley Baldwin ever spoke seatbelt ironic if they could be your last all right we got to find the dude dear drop sometimes he had to get his hands dirty when problems came up along the way tough job sandwich you know I'm looking at the forty six pounders sometimes uncomfortable conversations needed to be had you google me I'm perceived as a Trump loving right-wing Christian Christian kids you can see here we are having to take the back entrance like the Beatles were things like that even alec baldwin doesn't have this kind of VIP knife for a screwdriver knife or screwdriver quickly knife or a screwdriver all the doors along the way didn't open so easily hey and no matter where they went one topic stirred things up along the way 45 right okay you called 345 cause it's a plate this president wonderful they obviously have to wonder why was your welfare or why did you why did you / - exactly I'm sick come on get a good one we need a walk first of all off do we need one know that we need a wall how do you close this thing citrus beggarman it slowly starts going on it gives us great good there's lots more in here this st. the baptism I was thinking of back at the shipyard the barge workers believe they've figured out a solution to loading the RV I you know like I said I'm skeptical of it you know we'll just take it nice and slow and you see it's not gonna work we'll pull them back off thank you they decided to build a ramp out of scraps of wood laying around the dock but they're running out so there's just something there's no area to do this right now we're scrounging us from some guy over here yes Stephen is insistent on this run the risk of bottoming the vehicle we can't do that so there's just there's no way we could do this right now run the risk of bottoming the check out we can't do that with the Tea Party now in jeopardy Jared heads to give Stephen the bad news this guy he doesn't think this is a good idea he doesn't think he's scrambling to try to find the right type of wood to do this till somebody shuts me down I'm gonna keep the faith see that's not gonna work I'm not back in those two tires up under that skin we're another problem one of these boards breaks yeah the other question is gonna be that hook while the workers scrambled to come up with a plan to load the are beyond safely they decide to compromise the safety of the barge by taking down the railings yeah see they could pull these right on the rack yeah praise God bro hey man guys thank you so much how thick is this that's pretty heavy dude that'll work just fine i ground to something i think you're honest today Stephen learned how to load a barge in high tide but that's not the only thing that Stevens learned over the course of this pilgrimage red charger was a cop and this is just a normal piece he's a most popular pizza Tatanka io take my attack cake okay Tatanka pumpkin there were things he didn't know and things he really didn't know hello just means God in Arabic just like Allah is not the God of the Christian Bible if you could read the Quran it's all the same prophets I mean we've got Abraham and hasn't the same God everybody yeah even the same stories just with some details changed you know I bet you were a lot more similar than we realized along the way he was introduced to some different perspectives in order for us to accomplish economic development business development order for us to accomplish government reform in order for us to get the work force and the skill set the answer lies within education in lies within investing in our youth the the small politicians like ourselves keep it in effect you know exactly that's really matter and we have to constantly educate ourselves and kind of open ourselves up you try to save the world you can't save the world the world is a very large place where you can save your family hey you can save your community by being a good example yeah that's well it's everywhere my goal is that coming here today I think that I got to do a whole lot more listening than talking yeah I understand that perception of much better now than I did before I came in here I saw some big bro as producers put their faith and liability into Stephen to not destroy the RV think I got this Johnny he gives one last attempt to make his Boston Tea Party dream a reality big hot cars under there yeah good they saying good yeah huh I can't believe he did it our heroes are finally ready to ship off to have their Boston Tea Party you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna wipe his tush because he tends to give a little moist because that's normal yeah what would you like No down down and as ryo continues to listen to Steven Steven thinks back to all the people he's taken a moment to listen to along the way I think America to me is home family freedom is the freedom to pursue whatever makes you happy means freedom that means you can do whatever you want to do or be whatever you want to be I always tell my sons you're not gonna get anything my standing around and waiting for somebody to give it to you it's like a big star like either one of those tough so that's what he means to me though my wish come true is a star and my slave as well American Dream it's so to me subjective and honestly my parents they worked there for me and you know they gave me an education and to them I suppose that their dream I decided with my wife to leave France for the dream we have to come to United States with key kids we have no choice we need to make work my happy day was this joint I talked this past fall and I put on the garbage I trade with an American passport America is our freedom and our rights you know we should have the right to protest Thanks that we do not agree with we should have the right to live our lives and do the things that we like as long as we're not hurting other people or hurting their chances of success America to me is the idea of hope idea of hope but the actuality of America the reality is that we're a country that was developed on genocide America represents and this is my perspective and I don't want to offend anybody but it represents somebody who is a perpetrator who raped somebody really on and did it again did it again and everybody thinks it's okay America to me there's the most eclectic subculture in the world this collection of people's white black brown habla espanol in Osseo not rob a ligament HT me thing what the hell is it that's America I'm first-generation Americans so for me I feel like the opportunity is still there I think I can still pay my own way life will still be fairly the same for me regardless what's going on with political atmosphere you know things like that but overall I think I'm optimistic still America I feel is still you know blended opportunity but you know things are changing I think that we're definitely at a place right now where things are a little bit crazy but I would say that we just have to everybody just needs to be on the same page otherwise it's just gonna it's gonna keep going downhill from here are we gonna change as the demographic as a whole in this country but sometimes it doesn't seem that way it seems like we're going in Reverse sometimes I come across a lot of people that really fell on hard times we've been talking hard times I think people forgetting how to love and how to help their fellow man you know that's gonna cause a divide because you're not gonna understand each other as much you know and once you as an understanding your fellow man it can develop hate I think most people's fear is just come from lack of understanding of each other make the effort to learn more about each other than everybody has been subjugated and used to whether to be a benefit a certain class in America we have to rectify those issues and give some type of Solace so that we can grow from a situation but let's learn how to forgive and let's find a way so that our children and their children and their children have it better than what we have today everybody's on their own journey all I can do is plant seeds and hope that a beautiful flower grows well Stephen may not be everybody's cup of tea but neither is Max either way our heroes have made their dream a reality how did we pay for this barge let's just say the checks in the mail that's all happening baby it's all going down on the pilgrimage my man max to Michael Jackson tip them over the side no that's not good right reowww it's been quite a journey he's very careful okay but please yeah back to the tip for the proponents of perpetual pilgrimage well max as usual everything went perfect and according to plan and yet it all worked out didn't it Ron personal private pilgrims tea party right here you want to do a George Washington you wanted this barge go out and do it I've never been so creatively stifled in reality it's it's really quite something as our heroes celebrate their pilgrimage revolution Steven hums not the American National Anthem but Rule Britannia I can't believe we made it all the way to the Boston Harbor actually we're in Buzzards Bay as our heroes sail off into the sunset the great American pilgrimage has finally come to an end after traveling across the nation and speaking with everyday Americans Stephen and Max feel confident that this pilgrimage has started the conversation that will hopefully bring us together is this the end of our story or just the first chapter where will the pilgrimage take our heroes from here is there anybody out there can you even hear me next time on the great American pilgrimage now let's go make some other observations of the great American pilgrimage this is where the magic happened people in the finale of the great American pilgrimage you know there's an old expression max whenever a basketball player would make a great shot they said they'd shout out money but now I'm gonna give a little shout out right now it's gonna be like this digital cash little cash oh my puppy victory you know someday this pilgrimage is gonna end Rio is the prince of the pilgrimage really yep mr. Prince any salute
