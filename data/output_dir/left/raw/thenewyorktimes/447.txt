1
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:28,795
This is my home.
It might be a little small

2
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,230
but I love it.

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,934
This is the stuff I put in it.
My memories. 

4
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:41,641
I've been here all my life and
this is the only town I know.

5
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,045
I love Cairo and I'm not
giving up on Cairo.

6
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:49,849
But if they just, just tear 
down these buildings

7
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,520
without doing anything
there won't be a Cairo.

8
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,408
They're shellshocked.
It's trauma, it's trauma.

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,678
They are experiencing that
stress because their parents

10
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,547
are stressed so they feel that. 

11
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,048
They're uncertain.

12
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,183
They don't know where they're
going to go, they don't know

13
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,150
what they're going to do.

14
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,320
They're looking at possibly
saying goodbye to teachers and

15
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,389
people that they've known their
whole lives not knowing whether

16
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,024
or not they're going to come
back in the fall.

17
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,470
Dear Ben Carson, 
my name is Robert Williams.

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,573
I am currently living in the 
housing development.

19
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,975
I've been living there my whole
life.

20
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:52,645
At times I hate living
in the projects but I'm always

21
00:01:52,645 --> 00:00:00,000
going to love where I came from.
