1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
“He’s a quintessential kiss-up,
kick-down sort of guy.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,550
I’ve never seen anybody 
quite like Secretary Bolton ...

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,290
in terms of the way that he 
abuses his power and authority

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,840
with little people.”

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,190
“John, you have my confidence

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,319
and that of the president.”

7
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:34,160
“Confronting and triumphing

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,990
in the global war
on terror remains

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,960
a central priority of
the Bush administration,

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,290
and to win this war requires 
long-term cooperation

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,836
with all like-minded nations.”

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,310
“You said that if they 
removed 10 stories

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,300
from the 38-story
U.N. headquarters,

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,240
quote, ‘It wouldn’t
make a bit of difference.’

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,320
End of quote.”

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,690
“Is it fair to say that you
really don’t respect

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,490
or believe in the institution
of the United Nations?”

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,099
“No, I think it’s
very inaccurate.”

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,666
“You’re a Republican?”

20
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,883
“Yes, sir.

21
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:14,570
I described as
a loyal Republican.”

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,770
“That always worried
me about you.

23
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,940
I want you to know that.”

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,620
“Colin Powell’s chief of staff, 
Col. Lawrence Wilkerson,

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,920
testified before the committee

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,540
that Mr. Bolton
would make, quote,

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,970
‘an abysmal ambassador because
of his management flaws.’

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,080
When was the last time that
102 diplomats have imposed —

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,900
opposed the appointment
of a new ambassador? ...

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,030
Mr. President, please.

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,680
Find a better candidate

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,180
to send to the
United Nations.”

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,650
“John was unfairly denied
the up or down vote

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,400
that he deserves.”

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,210
“John Bolton is the 
right guy at the right time

36
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,230
with a worldview
that I think

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:00:00,000
will reinforce the 
president’s instincts … ”
