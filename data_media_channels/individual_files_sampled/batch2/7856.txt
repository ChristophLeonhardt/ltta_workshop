A MINNESOTA LAWMAKER REFUSED TO MEET WITH A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL DEMOCRATS FROM HER DISTRICT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO HER STORY SHE WAS AFRAID IT WOULD END UP WITH A SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIM. THIS IS A STRANGE TALE THAT WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE BEGINNING. SHE IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM MINNESOTA STATE LEGISLATURE. THE HIGH SCHOOL ASKED TO MEET WITH HER ONE-ON-ONE IN HER LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. THIS IS HOW SHE REPLIED. AND THE DEMOCRATIC GROUP WAS LIKE ISN'T IT OUR JOB TO MEET AND DISCOURSE BACK AND FORTH AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BOTH SIDES DAX SHE TWEETS BACK AT THEM SAYING THIS. THEY COME BACK AND SAY IS THAT YOUR DUTY TO MEET WITH CONSTITUENTS TO WHICH SHE REPLIES THIS. AND THIS IS BEFORE ALL THE WEIRD I DON'T WANT TO BE ROY MOORE THING. THIS IS AN ODD STORY. FROM TIME TO TIME WE COVER REPUBLICANS AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT ARE JUST CUCKOO FOR COCOA PUFFS. SHE APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THEM AS YOU WILL SEE LATER. BUT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DO TAKE MEETINGS WITH CONSTITUENTS, BUT ALL OF OUR VOLUNTEERS ARE IN STATE. AND SOMETIMES THEY EVEN CHANGE THEIR MINDS. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SEE DEMOCRACY, IT IS A WONDERFUL THING TO BEHOLD. SHE DOES IT REPRESENT ALL REPUBLICANS. IF IT IS A HIGH SCHOOL GROUP, YOU SHOULD BE MEETING WITH THEM. ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT WAS JUST THIS I DON'T THINK WE WOULD'VE DONE THE STORY. BUT THEY ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, YOU SHOULD MEET WITH THEM BUT IT IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE OPTICS. BUT SHE REFUSED TO GO ONE-ON-ONE WITH THEM. SHE GOT INVITED TO A VOLUNTEER EVENT AND SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO MEET WITH YOU. AND THEN THINK PROGRESS GOT THEIR HANDS ON A PRIVATE FACEBOOK POST SHE MADE SAYING THIS. WHY DOES SHE TAKE IT THERE? YOU REMEMBER MICHELLE BACHMANN USED TO HIDE IN THE BUSHES AT THE LGBT EVENTS TO TRY TO SURPRISE LESBIANS. LIKE SHE WOULD JUMP OUT OF THE BUSHES AND BE LIKE I CAUGHT YOU. AND THEY WOULD SAY IT IS AN LGBT EVENT, YOU DON'T CATCH US WITH ANYTHING. SO WEIRD. UNDER HER LOGIC YOU COULD NEVER MEET WITH ANYONE ALONE AND DEMAND CAN'T, A WOMAN CAN'T. IF SHE SAID I DON'T WANT TO JOKE AROUND ANYMORE ABOUT SEX AT WORK ANYMORE USED TO BE ABLE TO BUT WE CAN'T, YOU WOULD SAY I HEAR YOU. BUT IF YOU ARE OUT OF NOWHERE ARE LIKE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS Ã± ROY MOORE WAS ACCUSED OF RIPPING ONE GIRLS CLOTHES OFF AND TRY TO FORCE HER HEAD DOWN TO HIS GENITALS. YOU WEREN'T PLANNING TO DO THAT WITH A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WERE YOU? JUST SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE THERE. AND ALSO IN ADDITION TO BLOCKING THE LEADER OF THIS GROUP ON FACEBOOK IT WAS INCIDENTALLY A 17-YEAR-OLD KID, THAT LEADER OF THE GROUP WHOSE NAME IS JACK BALLOU WAS REALLY CONFUSED BY ALL OF THIS. AND THAT IS WHAT GETS ME MAYBE SHE IS A REPUBLICAN OUT IN A STATE REPRESENTATIVE SOMEWHERE IN MINNESOTA, SHE IS KIND OF ADOPTING THIS TRUMP LET'S TWEETS COLLOQUIALLY. INSTEAD OF SAD SHE CUTS AND PASTE THIS EMOJI WHICH INVOLVES A JAPANESE CHARACTER. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE THAT. AND THEN TO INVOKE ROY MOORE WHICH IS THE FLAVOR OF THE DAY, MAYBE SHE IS A LITTLE BEHIND AND HASN'T REALLY MET IT. IT IS JUST THE STRANGE KNEE-JERK REACTION COMMUNICATION OVER SOCIAL MEDIA THAT IS VERY STRANGE TO ME. SHE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO HERSELF ANY FAVORS BY COMPARING HERSELF TO ROY MOORE, NOT A SAVVY POLITICAL MOVE AT A BARE MINIMUM.
