00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:09,369
.

2
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,804
>>> NOW, I'M ALL FOR GETTING

3
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:11,805
PEOPLE WITH BUSINESS EXPERIENCE

4
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:12,405
INTO GOVERNMENT.

5
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:13,740
THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE TO

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,574
POSITIONS THAT AFFECT POLICY

7
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:17,410
TOWARDS THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,345
YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT

9
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:19,446
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:20,580
BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,616
WANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN

12
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:23,850
BUSINESS-NEEDED SERVICING

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,618
GOVERNMENT, THEY'RE REPRESENTING

14
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:25,418
THE ALL AMERICAN BUSINESS.

15
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:26,219
NOT JUST THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

16
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,156
THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE DRAIN

17
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,157
THE SWAMP AGENDA.

18
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:32,926
SO WITH THE HELP OF THE

19
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:33,660
ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE, WE

COMMERCE SECRETARY AND HIS

22
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,698
CURRENT BUSINESS INTERESTS.

23
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:45,005
WHAT WE FOUND WILL SHOCK YOU.

40
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,511
>> Reporter:  PRESIDENT TRUMP

41
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:54,614
AGGRESSIVE TRADE POLICIES ON THE

42
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:58,285
KEY PLANKS OF THE PRO WORK OF

43
00:00:58,285 --> 00:00:58,718
POPULIST WORK.

44
00:00:58,718 --> 00:00:59,486
RECENTLY THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE

45
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:01,755
GOOD ON HIS PROMISES BY MAKING

46
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:02,522
TARIFFS ON THE STEEL.

47
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:07,027
AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE TRUMP'S

48
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:10,063
WHO IT TURNS OUT IS NO STRANGER

49
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:11,231
TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY.

50
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,465
ROSS EARNED A LARGE PORTION OF

51
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,367
HIS WEALTH WHEN INCREDIBLY

52
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,969
TIMELY INVESTMENTS IN STRUGGLING

53
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,271
STEEL COMPANIES IN THE EARLY

54
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,206
2,000s.

55
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:21,508
HE MANAGED TO BUY ONE COMPANY

56
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:23,810
JUST A WEEK BEFORE GEORGE W.

57
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,345
BUSH IMPOSED HIS OWN TARIFFS,

58
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:26,346
DRAMATICALLY RAISING THE VALUE

59
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:28,548
OF THE COMPANY.

60
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:29,316
ROSS'S STEEL INVESTMENTS BECAME

61
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:32,152
SO VALUABLE THAT LESS THAN THREE

62
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:34,120
YEARS AFTER THE BUSH TARIFFS

63
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,059
ROSS SOLD THEM FOR $4.5 BILLION

64
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,227
SENDING A $3 MILLION PERSONAL

65
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,929
INVESTMENT BY ROSS INTO A

66
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:43,763
$250 MILLION PROFIT AND ALSO

67
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:44,998
EARNING HIM A SEAT ON THE BOARD

68
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:46,766
WHICH WOULD BECOME THE WORLD'S

69
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:47,801
LARGEST STEEL PRODUCER.

70
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:49,636
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, RIGHT?

71
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:50,637
JUST A SMART BUSINESSMAN WHO

72
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:53,373
MADE A LOT OF MONEY AND NOW

73
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,541
PUTTING HIS EXPERTISE TO WORK IN

74
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,709
GOVERNMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF

75
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:56,376
ALL OF US.

76
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,211
BUT IS IT, THOUGH?

77
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,179
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STEEL TARIFFS

78
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,047
INCLUDEDED A NUMBER OF

79
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:02,148
EXCEPTIONS, WHICH MEANS BIG

80
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:02,849
BUSINESS FOR COMPANIES THAT

81
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:08,354
BRING STEEL FROM THOSE COUNTRIES

82
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:10,824
TO THE UNITED STATES.

83
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:12,359
NAUTICAL BOAT HOLDINGS IS ONE OF

84
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:12,659
THEM.

85
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,896
WHEN IT WAS STARTED IN 2013,

86
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:19,199
INVESTORS SPENT MONEY ON SHIPS

87
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,833
FROM CHINA.

88
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,868
THEY BEGAN SHIPPING PRODUCTS IN

89
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:25,472
2015 AND SINCE MAY 2016, 458 OUT

90
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:28,642
OF THAT 735 SHIPMENTS TO THE

91
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:30,443
UNITED STATES, THAT 62% HAVE

92
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:31,745
INCLUDED STEEL FROM SOUTH KOREA.

93
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,513
ONE OF THE COUNTRIES WITH AN

94
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:40,553
EXCEPTION FROM STEEL TARIFFS.

95
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:41,254
THE FATE OF THAT EXEMPTION IS

96
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:47,460
NOW IN THE HANDS OF WILBUR ROSS.

97
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,229
GUESS BRINGING STEEL HERE AND

98
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,231
WHO REMAINS AN OWNER.

99
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,666
IT'S KIND OF UNBELIEVABLE EVEN

100
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,167
FOR REGULAR VIEWERS OF SWAMP

101
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:58,071
BUT THE ANSWER IS, WILBUR ROSS.

102
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,506
HE'S NEGOTIATING OVER SOUTH

103
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:03,009
KOREAN STEEL IMPORT WHILE MAKING

104
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,743
MONEY FROM IMPORTING SOUTH

105
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:05,045
KOREAN STEEL.

106
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:07,847
BUT NOT ONLY IS ROSS STILL AN

107
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:09,082
OWNER OF NAUTICAL BOAT HOLDING,

108
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:12,385
HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE

109
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:13,720
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IS LISTED AS

110
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,790
A DIRECTOR OF NAUTICAL BOLT

111
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,124
SHIPPING.

112
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:20,193
A BUSINESS ASSOCIATED, EVEN

113
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:22,128
THOUGH SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE

114
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,964
RESIGNED FROM THE COMPANY IN

115
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:25,265
2017.

116
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:28,968
AND NAUTICAL BAULT IS NOT THE

117
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:29,669
ONLY COMPANY HE'S INVESTED IN

118
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,037
WITH MASSIVE CONFLICTS OF

119
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,339
INTEREST.

120
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,175
NAVIGATOR HOLDINGS IS A GAS

121
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,209
SHIPPING FIRM WITH A NUMBER OF

122
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:37,711
CLIENTS INCLUDING A MAJOR OIL

123

COMPANY IN TURKEY WHICH HAS

124
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,815
RECENTLY BEEN CONSIDERED FOR

125
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:42,916
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.

126
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:47,320
ROSS BOUGHT A 19% STAKE AND

127
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,822
INCREASED IT TO 39% IN 2018.

128
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,890
HE ALSO SERVED AS A COMPANY

129
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,193
DIRECTOR BETWEEN 2012 AND 2014.

130
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:55,028
IN NOVEMBER 2017, EIGHT MONTHS

131
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,663
AFTER JOINING THE TRUMP

132
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:57,664
ADMINISTRATION, ROSS ANNOUNCED

133
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,733
THAT HE WOULD DIVEST FROM

134
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:00,367
NAVIGATOR HOLDINGS.

135
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,469
BUT AS OF TODAY, THERE IS NO

136
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,570
EVIDENCE HE'S KEPT THAT PROMISE.

137
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,506
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE END OF

138
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:07,540
IT.

139
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,776
ROSS'S PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM WL

140
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,811
ROSS AND COMPANY ALSO CO-FOUNDED

141
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:14,414

142
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:14,914

143
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,916
THE TRANSPORTATION RECOVERY

144
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,218

145
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,753
THAT ONE SPECIALIZES IN THE

146
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:20,387
IMPORTING OF AUTO PARTS.

147
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:22,155
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT AFFECT

148
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,523
WILBUR ROSS'S HANDLING OF

149
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:25,692
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROPOSED

150
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:26,793
TARIFFS ON AUTO IMPORTS?

151
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:29,028
BUT, WATED, THERE'S MORE.

152
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:32,665
ACCORDING TO SEC FILINGS IN

153
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:35,535
2014, ROSS'S FIRM OWNS 32% OF

00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:36,269
ANOTHER COMPANY CALLED DIAMOND

155
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:36,636
SHIPPING.

156
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:37,771
ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST

157
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:39,773
OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF TANKERS.

158
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,674
ROSS EVEN SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF

159
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:44,511
THE COMPANY UNTIL JOINING THE

160
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:45,078
COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.

161
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,846
LIKE NAVIGATOR HOLDINGS, ROSS

162
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:48,681
PROMISED TO DIVEST FROM DIAMOND

163
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:49,616
SHIPPING IN NOVEMBER 2017.

164
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:52,285
BUT, AGAIN, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

165
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:52,886
HE ACTUALLY DID.

166
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:55,889
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF

167
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,090
DIAMOND SHIPPING, IN OTHER

168
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,295
WORDS, WILBUR ROSS'S CLIENTS.

169
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:02,962
IT'S QUITE THE MOTLEY CRUE.

170
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:05,131
THERE'S TWO OF THE LARGEST

171
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:09,469
ENERGY COMPANIES IN RUSSIA.

172
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:10,370

00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:16,643
ANOTHER CLIENT IS PETRO CHINA.

176
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,211
THE CHINESE STATE-OWNED OIL AND

177
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,480
GAS COMPANY.

178
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,116
THE BRUTAL COMMUNIST

179
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,317
DICTATORSHIP IN BEIJING MAY BE

180
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:27,620
PLANNING WORLD DOMINATION, BUT

181
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,956
LET'S NOT LET THAT STOP

182
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,658
AMERICANS DOING BUSINESS OF THEM

183
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:34,594
WHILE IN OFFICE.

184
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,597
TALK ABOUT GLOBALISM, WAIT, HE'S

185
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:38,031
NOT DONE.

186
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:40,900
THERE'S ANOTHER REAL CHARMER ON

187
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,335
THE DIAMOND SHIPPING CLIENT

188
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,970
