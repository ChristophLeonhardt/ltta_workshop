1
00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:04,493
GROUND ZERO, MEXICO BEACH.

2
00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:07,129
YESTERDAY THIS WAS SOMEONE'S

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:07,430
HOUSE.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,999
NOW FOLLOWING THIS DESTRUCTIVE

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,767
POWER OF HURRICANE MICHAEL IS AN

6
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:13,135
EMPTY SLAP FOUNDATION.

7
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:15,337
LOOKING AROUND MEXICO BEACH,

8
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:16,839
FRANKLY I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,441
OF HOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED

10
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:20,276
DOWN TO THE FOUNDATION OR RIPPED

11
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,477
OFF OF THEIR FOUNDATION THAT

12
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:22,378
BRINGS UP A POINT.

13
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:24,680
THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF THIS

14
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:25,714
HURRICANE LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT

15
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:27,483
WE USUALLY SEE WITH A TORNADO.

16
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:30,786
A TORNADO IS VERY FOCUSED IN ITS

17
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:31,153
INTENSITY.

18
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,689
THE AMOUNT OF GROUND IT COVERS.

19
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,157
WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THIS

20
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:36,559
HURRICANE IS THE DESTRUCTION,

21
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,727
JUST STRETCHES FOR MILES AND

22
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:39,028
MILES.

23
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,297
THE DESTRUCTION IS PLAIN TO SEE

24
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:42,398
HERE IN MEXICO BEACH.

25
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,133
WHAT IS UNKNOWN RIGHT NOW IS THE

26
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:44,667
HUMAN TOLL.

27
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,203
THE MAYOR HERE TELLS ME THAT

28
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:49,705
SOME 280 PEOPLE PLUS ELECTED TO

29
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,307
RIDE OUT THE STORM IN THEIR

30
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:51,707
HOMES.

31
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:52,908
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO WAY TO

32
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,343
COMMUNICATE WITH THESE PEOPLE.

33
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,011
THERE'S NO WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR

34
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:56,345
THEM.

35
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:57,880
SEARCH AND RESCUE IS UNDERWAY.

36
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,615
THE OTHER BIG JOB IS CLEARING

37
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:01,083
THE ROADS TO MAKE THAT SEARCH

38
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,117
AND RESCUE POSSIBLE.

39
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:03,719
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

40
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,754
DEBRIS IN THE ROADWAY.

41
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:07,423
AGAIN, VERY, VERY POWERFUL STORM

42
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:08,524
THAT CAME ASHORE.

43
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,559
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

44
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,127
NOTICED DRIVING IN WITH THE

45
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:13,496
HURRICANE, YOU SEE THE GROUND

46
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:15,297
GETS SOFT AND TREES GET TIPPED

47
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:16,599
OVER BECAUSE THE ROOTS CAN'T

48
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,766
HOLD THEM UP ANYMORE.

49
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,504
WHAT WE SAW DRIVING IN HERE IS

50
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:24,273
MILES AND MILES OF TREES SNAPPED

51
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:25,808
OFF AT THE TRUNK.

52
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:27,810
A POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF HOW

53
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,812
MUCH FORCE THIS HURRICANE

54
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:30,646
BROUGHT ASHORE.

55
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,481
>> THE OTHER BIG SITE ARE THE

56
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,717
POWER LINES DOWN IN THE ROADWAY.

57
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:36,685
THIS IS ALL OVER THIS SECTION OF

58
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:37,152
THE PANHANDLE.

59
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:38,754
WE DROVE IN ON I-10.

60
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:41,557
WE SAW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

61
00:01:41,558 --> 00:01:43,125
POWER TRUCKS THAT WERE STAGING.

62
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:44,827
THEY HAD COME IN FROM OUT OF

63
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:45,127
STATE.

64
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,529
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO GET

65
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,330
THE POWER LINING BACK UP AND

66
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,666
WORKING AND GET POWER RESTORED.

67
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:51,734
IT UNFORTUNATE.

68
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,636
AS YOU HEARD FROM THE LEADERS,

69
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:55,504
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

70
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:55,971
PATIENT, SHEP.

71
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,973
>> Shepard: VERY QUICKLY.

72
00:01:57,974 --> 00:02:00,409
I-10 HAS BEEN CLOSED ABOUT 80

73
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,877
MILES OF IT SO THEY CAN CLEAR

74
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:02,745
OUT DEBRIS.

75
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:06,382
DO WE KNOW IF IT'S REOPENED?

76
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:08,117
>> IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE

77
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:08,617
MAKING PROGRESS.

78
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,519
I SAW IT IN THE EARLY MORNING

79
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,754
HOURS WHEN THE IT WAS CLOSED AND

80
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:14,223
WE HAD TO COME OVER THROUGH THE

81
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:14,857
LOCAL ROADS.

82
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,759
I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

83
00:02:16,760 --> 00:00:00,000
GO BACK.
