1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,660
THE REPUBLICANS PASSED THEIR
TAX BILL, AND NOW IT LEAVES A

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,860
GIANT HOLE IN THE DEFICIT, ABOUT
$1.5 TRILLION.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,860
THEY SAID THEY

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,010
CARED ABOUT BALANCING THE
BUDGET, THEY PROVED THAT WAS

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,270
NOTHING BUT A LIE, THEY DON'T
MIND PUTTING TRILLIONS OF

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,859
DOLLARS OF DEBT ONTO THE COUNTRY
AS LONG AS IT GOES TO THE RICH

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:24,370
DONORS AND THEIR CORPORATE
DONORS, THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,369
BUT THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT
TRICKLE-DOWN, DON'T WORRY, THEY

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,910
MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN MILLIONS, BUT
MAYBE SOME OF IT WILL TRICKLE

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,000
DOWN ON YOUR HEAD.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,249
IT TURNS OUT
A WOMAN WROTE IN ON TWITTER

12
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:39,679
SAYING IT DID, AND PAUL RYAN
WANTED TO CELEBRATE IT.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,679
OKAY,

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,530
FAIR IS FAIR, LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT THE FACTS ARE.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,530
RYAN SAYS IN

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,249
A TWEET THAT IS NOT DELETED, AS
YOU WILL SEE WHY --

17
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:59,499
WOW.

18
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:07,729
COSTCO MEMBERSHIP,
APPARENTLY 60 BUCKS,

19
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:09,020
CONGRATULATIONS.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,570
THAT'S NOT
$1.50 PER HOUR, OR EVEN PER DAY,

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,799
THAT'S AN EXTRA $1.50 PER WEEK.

22
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,140
THANK YOU, PAUL RYAN, YOU ARE SO

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,000
GENEROUS.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,100
BUT EVEN NANCY PELOSI
WOKE UP TO RESPOND 

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,890
TO THIS, SHE

26
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,200
SAID --

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,409
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

28
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,939
LOOK AT NANCY PELOSI FIGHTING

29
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,159
BACK.

30
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,289
GLAD TO SEE THE BATTLE IS
JOINED.

31
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,859
I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK

32
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:03,840
THAT YES, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
TAX BILL PASSED THE KOCH

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,169
BROTHERS SENT $500,000 TO A PAUL
RYAN PAC, JOB WELL DONE, WAY TO

34
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,708
DELIVER FOR US.

35
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,030
THAT BILL HAS
BILLIONS -- NOT MILLIONS,

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,730
BILLIONS -- OF DOLLARS OF
SAVINGS FOR THE KOCH FAMILY

37
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,051
ALONE, LET ALONE THE BILLIONS IT
SAVES THE WALTON FAMILY, LET

38
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:26,990
ALONE THE TRILLIONS IT SAVES
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.

39
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,040
BUT

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,420
YOU GET $1.50 A WEEK.

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,180
AND HE
SENT THAT OUT LIKE HEY, WE TOLD

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,630
YOU WE WOULD DELIVER FOR YOU.

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,340
SO
$1.50 A WEEK FOR YOU, HOW MUCH

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,739
FOR THE TOP 1%?

45
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:40,739
FORBES REPORTS
--

46
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:50,330
DO YOU EVEN MAKE $51,000?

47
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,099
I
KNOW A LOT OF YOU DON'T. $51,000

48
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,410
EXTRA IN TAX INDUCTIONS FOR THE
TOP 1%.

49
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,930
BUT YOU GET $1.50 A

50
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,879
WEEK, SHOULDN'T YOU CELEBRATE?

51
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:12,560
KEITH ELLISON WROTE --

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,329
SO YOU GET $1.50 A WEEK,
WELLS FARGO GETS $3.4 BILLION IN

53
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,379
TAX BREAKS.

54
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,900
IT'S FOR THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN.

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,870
AND OTHERS WROTE THIS

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,310
TOO, THEY POINTED OUT THAT PAUL
RYAN -- I THINK JON FAVREAU

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,519
DID, FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR
BARACK OBAMA -- PAUL RYAN

58
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,849
PROBABLY THOUGHT, WHAT?

59
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,250
HE
GENUINELY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW

60
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,390
INSULTING THAT IS.

61
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,370
WHAT, I GAVE
YOU THE CRUMBS?

62
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,370
WHAT DID YOU

63
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,640
THINK I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU?

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,780
OF COURSE THE BILLIONS OF

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,860
DOLLARS WERE GOING TO GO TO MY
DONORS.

66
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,140
I GAVE YOU CRUMBS AND

67
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,260
YOU ARE STILL COMPLAINING?

68
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,840
AS I
BELIEVE SOMEONE ELSE POINTED

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,209
OUT, FOR $1.50 A WEEK YOU CAN'T
EVEN BUY CAKE, SO THEY ARE EVEN

70
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:06,140
WORSE THAN MARIE ANTOINETTE.

71
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,930
AND
FINALLY, THE PERSON MOST JUMPING

72
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,810
INTO THE FRAY IN THIS CASE WAS
RANDY BRYCE, UNDERSTANDABLY SO,

73
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,800
BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING AGAINST
PAUL RYAN IN THAT SEAT.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
PAUL

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,890
RYAN IS THINKING ABOUT RETIRING,
A LITTLE SCARED OF THE

76
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,860
COMPETITION AND WHICH WAY THIS
ELECTION MIGHT GO.

77
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,020
HIS OPPONENT

78
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,830
IS RANDY BRYCE, WHO'S ALSO BY
THE WAY A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT, AND

79
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:49,850
HE TWEETED OUT THIS --

80
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,950
AND WE'LL PUT THOSE LINKS DOWN
BELOW IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX AS

81
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,280
WELL, RANDY BRYCE, AN IRONWORKER
KNOWN AS IRON STACHE, AND PAUL

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,830
RYAN IS NOT COMING FOR HIM AS IT
TURNS OUT, HE'S COMING FOR PAUL

83
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,010
RYAN.

84
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,040
SO PAUL RYAN BETTER SAVE
UP ALL THE KOCH BROTHERS MONEY,

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,470
HE'S GOING TO NEED IT BECAUSE HE
MIGHT BE IN FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

86
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,820
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HIS
CONSTITUENTS ARE UP TO, THE

87
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,280
STATE OF AFFAIRS IN HIS DISTRICT
OR ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND

88
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,380
HE THINK YOU SHOULD CELEBRATE
THEIR CRUMBS.

89
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,540
I DON'T THINK

90
00:05:22,540 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE WILL BE IN MUCH OF A
CELEBRATORY MOOD IN NOVEMBER.
