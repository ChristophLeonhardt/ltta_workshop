katar has welcomed a ruling by the UN's top court that orders the UAE to reunite families separated by its Brocade but will the UAE government comply with the order and what impacts will this have on the Gulf crisis this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully battable it's the first ruling by the UN's top court on the golf crisis the International Court of Justice has ordered the United Arab Emirates to immediately allow kateri UAE mixed families who were separated by the blockade on Qatar to reunite in June 2017 Saudi Arabia Bahrain Egypt nua II imposed a land sea and air blockade accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism a charge Doha strongly rejects Qatar filed a case at the ICJ arguing the UAE had violated an International Convention on racism when it expelled thousands of kateri citizens during the first weeks of the crisis Monday's ruling was preliminary the final decision on the case is not expected for months while bringing our guests in just a moment but first this report from Nev Walker at The Hague Qatar's legal battle with the United Arab Emirates has dealt a defining blow the International Court of Justice says the measures taken by the UAE after the blockade of Qatar amount to racial discrimination according to Qatar the UAE has failed to respect its obligations the ICJ's ordered the UAE immediately to allow Qatari families expelled from the country to be reunited students to finish their studies and those countries affected access to Emirati courts and tribunals the orders of the ICJ president is compulsory the Court reaffirmed that it is orders on provisional measures under article 41 of the statute have binding effect and thus create international legal obligations for any party to whom the provisional measure is our address last June the UAE Saudi Arabia Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a land sea and air blockade accusing Qatar of funding extremism accusations it denies Qatar says its citizens were either illegally expelled or denied access to the UAE separating families and denying people access to health care education their properties and assets of course the UAE is only one of the four countries to have imposed a blockade on Qatar but it's the only one out of the four to be brought here before the International Court of Justice why because it's the only country out of the four that signed up to the International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination but Bahrain Egypt and Saudi Arabia will be watching this case closely and drawing their own conclusions this is a statement that there is a likelihood of discrimination so one would think that the other states in the region would say that means something again likely that this is a violation in earlier hearings the UAE denied any policy of expulsion saying its measures were designed to have the least possible impact on ordinary citizens it said its argument was with the Qatari government not the kateri people but the UAE must comply with the court or face further legal action Qatar could go to the UN Security Council and demand an enforcement order this is one of a string of legal challenges mounted by Qatar to try and end the blockade a ruling the country will welcome but whether it will help end the blockade now in its 14th month is less certain Nev Barker al Jazeera The Hague the UAE issued a statement after the court ruling saying contrary to Qatar's false allegations thousands of calories continue to reside in and visit the UAE Qatar visitors may enter the UAE with prior entry permission issued through the telephone hotline we urge Qatar to constructively engage on the requests made by the UAE and other countries for kata to comply with its international obligations now we'd like to point out that we did reach out to officials and analysts in the UAE for comment on this story but they've all declined to come on the program so let's bring in our guests joining us here in Doha Abdul Aziz Al Horder Ector of the diplomatic Institute at the cautery Ministry of Foreign Affairs on skype from the Croatian city of Dubrovnik Toby Cadman an international human rights lawyer and in London Hasan Ashraf visiting fellow at the Center for conflict security and terrorism at Nottingham University gentlemen welcome to you all thank you so much for being on the program today Toby Cadman in Croatia I'd like to start with you because you're an expert of the International Court of Justice and I'd like to clarify for our viewers what this ruling by the ICJ a preliminary ruling means because we're getting a different spin on it from the official news agency in the UAE at least which party does this provisional ruling favor thank you well certainly the favor the ruling is in favor of the state of Qatar that's clear there there have been a number of statements coming out from the UAE that it's not a decision it's it's an order well I mean that that's a that's a question of semantics to be to be honest the the decision that has been issued by the International Court of Justice is a ruling in favor of Qatar following their request for provisional measures and as is quite clear from the decision and I would direct your listeners to read the decision rather than any statement coming out of the UAE is very clear that it accepts jurisdiction it accepts that the matter is being complained of forwarded and forwarded in the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and it's ironic to say the least that the UAE be acting Qatar to respect international law which UAE has shown through its own actions that it had complete disregard for Toby a provisional victory for Qatar but it's not the end of the case it's certainly not the end of the case is the very beginning of the case but it's an important first ruling that upholds the position the state of Qatar has taken that this is a matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and that the acts complained of are capable of being considered violations of the international convention so there's a two very important rulings that the International Court of Justice has made and it's also important to note that the International Court of Justice disregarded the closing remarks by the UAE when the UAE tried to argue that despite the statement June of last year from their own foreign ministry that there wasn't any action that has been taken and the inter-school justice did not accept that so the position that the UAE has put forward has been disregarded of course proceedings before the International Court of Justice are very long right and very complex and involving matters of international law and and and and facts so this is likely to go on for some time but it's an important first ruling certainly okay Abdul Aziz Al hor here in Doha as Toby says they're very important to point out that this order does not constitute a final ruling on the case and it could be months if not years before a final decision on the case brought by Qatar is made so why is cotta welcoming this initial ruling even though it's not the final decision actually I agree with our colleague this is a very first step in the in a long time maybe the marathon ik1 but for from our perspective it shows how the political behavior of Qatar is it shows the professionalism and it shows the proper approach that Qatar is taking in the crisis or the existing crisis and struggle with the blockading country it shows when Qatar has said to the whole world that our people have been victimized our people have been discriminated against we were really right about this that really our Qatari people have been discriminated discriminated against not only in UAE but as you know Abdul Aziz and who knew Abdul Aziz I'm sorry to interrupt you the UAE until today insists that it has not it has done nothing wrong that you know these violations committed are not real because Qatari citizens still live and work in the UAE and are still being allowed into the UAE it's I mean they have been saying this and they are saying this and they would be saying this in the future as well you can see this after the the decisions and still they are repeating the same story again but Qatar was able to prove that they the Qatar their Qatari people have been discriminated against by showing evidence of this not by talking about it it's it's really that we are living in this country we have relatives we have friends we have colleagues we have professional people all of these people have been discriminated against especially students and relative and families okay let me bring in Afzal Ashraf in London now what's your reading of this ruling do you think it's a victory for Qatar well I think it might be a victory for Qatar but it's an even bigger victory for the international system I think that what we're seeing here is one party using the the the the concept that right is might and the other party is using the concept that might is right so what we have is a number of states who are allied against Qatar whatever the dispute between them I'm not going to comment on it but the point is that they are using political economic and other leverage to force a change of behavior of what Qatar has done is use international legal systems to enforce their rights right I want to ask you about a point you just made there that it's very interesting I think do you think by going the legal route Qatar is complicating a political resolution of the crisis I think that it could do it very much depends on how people react to it but the point I think that is inherent in this ruling is that you mustn't mix politics with people it's the next worse things to mixing politics and religion so what it appears are certainly the reading of the court is that whatever the political issue and they've stilted discuss that okay it is wrong to make individual citizens pay for the price of a political conflict and I think that's a significant underlying point Toby Cadman in Dubrovnik my next question to you is is the ruling by by the ICJ enforceable if the UAE decides that it doesn't want to implement what is advised by the court what happens then what are the ramifications well I think the first point to to reemphasize is that and I don't quite like the way your your guess London put it and here we have a situation where the UAE has has tried to use bullying tactics to to prevent any any kind of actually being taken and to prevent the the international community from really scrutinizing the illegality of the blockade and what and the consequences of the rocket something's important to look at that and of course the ICJ is is a judicial body which is fully independent and impartial and is immune from from a side pressure now in terms of whether they will follow the ruling I've very much doubt that they will do anything to implement the ruling as their statement that they've issued clearly indicates that they consider it to be wrong and they do not consider anything they do to the subject to external scrutiny and this is one of the biggest problems with with UAE and the other blockading states is is that's the default position in terms of enforcing it yes of course it can be in for how to commit UN Security Council of justice itself doesn't doesn't have power of enforcement is that what you're saying well yes I mean if you have the one of the most important Rowling's the Internet Court of Justice has as it has ever issued which which relates to the the Worman slip now that wall still stands despite the finding that it is illegal so it is it is a difficulty in in international law in ensuring that there is an enforceability mechanism but what you have to understand is that not only the UN Security Council but through other through other mechanisms of the United Nations the the question really has to be it does the United Arab Emirates wish to establish itself as a pariah state because that's where it's heading it is it has tried to to get the international community to support it in creating the state of Qatar as a vassal state under the authority of Saudi Arabia UAE Bahrain and to a lesser extent Egypt and that has failed now they are up against actual legal reasoning from a credible body which has dismissed the arguments that it has made in defense and and said that is in breach of international law as we heard from the state of the UAE they they're calling for the state of Qatar respecting international law again right that's what they're going to have to face yeah it seems such we're just going round and round in this crisis let's just remind our viewers of how it all unfolded on May 23rd 2017 the cata news agency was hot false statements attributed to the country's leader were posted on its website and broadcast by Saudi and Emirati media the hacking came three days after US President Donald Trump met Arab leaders at the Riyadh summit on June 5th Saudi Arabia the UAE Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar imposing a land sea and air blockade they accuse Doha supporting terrorism an allegation Qatar has strongly denied now the blockading countries ordered thousands of kateri residents to leave their countries and demanded that their own citizens living in Qatar return home then they sent Qatar a list of 13 demands that included curbing relations with Iran closing a Turkish military base and shutting down the al Jazeera media network Abdul Aziz Al hor what do you respond to those who say that Qatar is undermining any possible political or diplomatic settlements to this crisis by going the legal route actually in fact Katara from day one respected the Kuwait as a mediator in the case they asked for these implicating countries to come around the table and express all their concerns on the table with one condition only to come to the table without the pre-conditions Without Really imposing anything that will affect the sovereignty and independence e of the guitar that was the only principle that was not negotiable D sovereignty and the indepence dependency of the country and the still today is calling for the to come to the negotiation table and tomorrow they will continue to call for this actually they have shown by evidence to the ICJ that we have called for a negotiation and to come to the negotiation table but all of these attempts have been rejected we responded positively to the kuwaiti a mediator we responded positively to all to everybody who try to negate to mediate the with the blockade in countries but all what we hear at all what we receive is a total rejection and an escalation that have been based on a very fake and trouble news ok so you're saying that Qatar had really no choice now then to go to the International Court of Justice laughs exactly absol of sharp what impact do you see this ruling having on the battle for influence in Western capitals we seen the Emir of Qatar in London on Tuesday he's traveled to Washington as well and so have the blockading countries have been you know waging a battle of influence really in Western capitals what impacts do you see this ruling having on the position of Western countries in this crisis well I think that certainly the Qatar is one if you like a a goal in the battle of influence it's very much in the lead on this particular issue and this particular issue relates of course as we worry discuss to the human rights of people affected in this dispute it doesn't address the wider dispute at this stage that is probably going to be downstream and I think that what I would hope that all the parties involved in this dispute take time out and think very carefully about their strategies right the battle of influence can work both ways what they should do is look at the history of interstate politics and conflict resolution before the First World War and how alliances and this is what we're talking about in this case is alliances both regional as well as international who are having influence on the parties involved and how that can very rapidly fall apart and cause major problems but far bigger than the conflict that we're dealing with right now so it you know if they can in any way come together and try to resolve their problems through mediation we've heard about the possibility of mediating through Kuwait in other countries that is going to be much more sustainable and a much more effective solution than lobbying international powers for influence because they will respond to their own interests occasionally the local and speaking of mediation you mentioned Kuwaiti mediation there and we've also heard the possibility of u.s. mediation there's been talk of a summit at Camp David possibly in September between Donald Trump and leaders of these countries in this region do you see this decision having an impact on that can this summit still take place in the current context well I hope so I I think it should do and and one point that I hope I Toby is wrong about m'p he's wrong I'm not saying he is is that I think my reading of some of the statements the UA he has made to Reuters is that they're claiming that they're complying with the the resolution of the International Court of Justice so they they say they're complying according to their national regulations so they have a face-saving way out of this I don't think that anybody should start creating if you like embarrassing situations for other parties in this what I think this ruling could do is show that if people can sit down and talk about rights as opposed to politics then you are likely to get a better solution and I would say say that regional solutions are probably more sustainable right than international solutions because in the u.s. with the best will in the world will be approaching this from its national interest let's hear from Toby those may not coincide with other people's interests let's allow Toby to respond and Toby I also want to ask you about you know you talked about the possibility of the case being referred to the International rather to the UN Security Council if you know it wasn't resolved at the level of the International Court of Justice if that were to happen who stands to benefit from the case going all the way to the UN Security Council well first of all to respond I also hope I'm wrong I don't think I am but I do hope I am wrong and that the UAE see it sees this so actually all sides see this as an opportunity of course everybody wants to see a political solution to this rather than protracted litigation the difficulty is Carter has tried that and it's failed they have attempted to to mediate a problem as the guest from London said from with the with the Kuwaiti assistance but that wasn't successful and so cut that was forced to initiate litigation because that was the only way to resolve this issue or see if it goes to the UN Security Council we don't know which way that's going to go we don't know what level of sports what they're gonna get yeah hopeful is that you know goes the Security Council as as sort of the last-ditch attempt to ensure compliance hopefully the way you will comply with a decision and things will change all right let's give the last word to Abdul Aziz Al hor here in Doha how do you see Qatar placed today in terms of the international community and where do you see this crisis going do you think it can be resolved in the next few months I hope it can be resolved we resolved we resolved a previous one we sat on the table we really discussed the concern why it doesn't happen this time so I do have the hope that it will be resolved but I mean - for this to be resolved there is only one way for resolving it it's a dialogue a dialogue and dialogue this is the only way to do it I agree with our colleagues that Qatar has been left with no choice but going to the international law legal system to claim the rice for its own people of protecting their their really their their people and making sure that they receive a proper and and just dealing with with the will K in these countries okay we'll leave it there thank you very much gentlemen for a very interesting conversation Abdul Aziz Al
