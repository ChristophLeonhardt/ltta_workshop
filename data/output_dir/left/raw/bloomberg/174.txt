1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,771
ATLANTA.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,538
DAVID WESTIN IS WITH BILL

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,608
CLINTON.

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,910
DAVID: I WANT TO SPEND A MINUTE

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,746
ON ORLANDO.

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,648
I WILL BE PERSONAL WITH THIS.

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,551
WHEN I WAS RUNNING ABC NEWS, YOU

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,653
DID A LIVE PROGRAM WITH YOUR

9
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,823
WIFE AFTER COLUMBINE.

10
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,692
I REMEMBER HOW EMOTIONAL THAT

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,228
WAS.

12
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,095
YOU HAVE BEEN IN THAT JOB WHEN

13
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,763
THERE HAS BEEN TRAGEDY, HUGE

14
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:31,898
TRAGEDY.

15
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,935
WHAT CAN WE DO TO AVOID THIS?

16
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:43,109
PRESIDENT CLINTON: WE NEED MORE

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:51,050
HELP WITH INTELLIGENCE WORK WITH

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,485
FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW

19
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,053
ENFORCEMENT WITH PEOPLE MIGHT BE

20
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,622
LONE WOLVES.

21
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,025
LIKE THE PEOPLE IN SAN

22
00:00:59,025 --> 00:00:59,859
BERNARDINO, THEY WERE CONVERTED

23
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,628
OVER THE INTERNET.

24
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,164
TODAY WE STILL DON'T KNOW ALL OF

25
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:09,802
WHAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY LEARN

26
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:10,536
ABOUT THE MAN WHO KILLED ALL

27
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,739
THOSE PEOPLE IN ORLANDO.

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,775
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF CRAZY

29
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:19,112
THEORIES FLOATING AROUND.

30
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:19,946
IT DOES SEEM CLEAR THAT SOME

31
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:24,651
PEOPLE WERE IN TOUCH WITH HIM,

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,519
PERHAPS EVEN IN HIS OWN FAMILY,

33
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,588
NEW HE WAS GOING TO BE DOING

34
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,157
SOMETHING.

35
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:41,500
WE'VE GOT TO GET BETTER AT THAT.

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,438
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

37
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,411
IT'S ALSO TRUE IN OTHER AREAS.

38
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,145
THERE ARE CLEAR SIGNS OF

39
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,247
SUICIDES.

40
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:58,451
THIS IS SOMETHING NEW.

41
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,252
YOU CAN GO DOWN TO YOUR STORE

42
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,120
AND GET AN AR-15 AND WIPE OUT A

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,657
BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

44
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,425
WE NEED TIGHTER SECURITY ON

45
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:09,662
THAT.

46
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,098
THE OTHER THING THAT HILLARY

47
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:16,469
SAID IN HER SPEECH ARE ACCURATE

48
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,303
TO THE OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO TO

49
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,708
TIGHTEN OUR AND -- DEFENSES AT

50
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,777
HOME.

51
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:29,349
I KEPT THINKING OVER AND OVER

52
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,353
THE MORE I HEAR ABOUT THIS, I

53
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,354
WAS GLAD TO HEAR THE FBI

54
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,990
DIRECTOR SAY HE WAS ASKING

55
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,791
HIMSELF IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE

56
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,328
HE SHOULD OF DONE?

57
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,162
THAT'S WHAT EVERY AMERICAN

58
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,331
SHOULD ASK.

59
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,165
WE'VE GOT TO BE ON A HIGHER

60
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,301
ALERT.

61
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,168
WE CAN'T IGNORE SOMEONE YOU

62
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:54,340
THINK YOU -- IS RANTING AND

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,142
RAVING.

64
00:02:56,142 --> 00:03:00,380
DAVID: YESTERDAY THE TWO

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,018
CANDIDATES SAID TWO THINGS.

66
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,852
WE SHOULD EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM

67
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,652
MUSLIM COUNTRIES FROM COMING

68
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,554
HERE.

69
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,723
SOME OF THEM HAVE THIS IDEOLOGY.

70
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,591
IF WE HAD MORE PEOPLE WITH GUNS

71
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,526
AND THAT NIGHT CLUB, THERE WOULD

72
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,427
NOT HAVE BEEN THIS TRAGEDY.

73
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,397
PRESIDENT CLINTON: DID YOU SEE

74
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,201
HOW DARK IT WAS?

75
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,101
I THINK IT'S LIKELY MORE PEOPLE

76
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:22,802
WOULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

77
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:28,942
ALL I KNOW IS THIS: WE HAD A 10

78
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,744
YEAR BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS.

79
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,347
THAT HAS PASSED WHEN I WAS

80
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,214
PRESIDENT AND I SIGNED IT AND WE

81
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:39,318
PUT OUR OR IT.

82
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,853
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOST THEIR

83
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,658
JOBS BECAUSE THEY VOTED FOR THAT

84
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,426
, IT WAS A COMPREHENSIVE

85
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,329
BACKGROUND CHECK LAW.

86
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,864
WE HAD A 33 YEAR LOW IN THE GUN

87
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:57,370
DEATH RATE AND A 46 LOW BY GUN

88
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,605
HOMICIDES.

89
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:06,712
IT WORKED PRETTY WELL.

90
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:12,351
WHEN IT WAS ALLOWED TO EXPIRE,

91
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,186
FOR A WHILE WE DIDN'T SEEM TO

92
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,955
HAVE AN UPTICK IN CRIME.

93
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,755
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED

94
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,392
WITH THESE BIG WEAPONS AT SANDY

95
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:24,630
HOOK AND AURORA, COLORADO AND

96
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,036
MOST RECENTLY IN ORLANDO AND SAN

97
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,772
BERNARDINO, IT'S CLEAR THAT IF

98
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,643
YOU ARE FIRING A LOT OF

99
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,111
AMMUNITION IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF

100
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,180
TIME, WITH A WEAPON THAT IS

101
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,185
DESIGNED ONLY TO KILL, IF THE

102
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,020
GUY JUST HAD A PISTOL IN THAT

103
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,458
NIGHT CLUB, I DON'T THINK HE

104
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,593
COULD'VE KILLED 49 PEOPLE.

105
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,764
THAT'S MY RESPONSE.

106
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,731
DAVID: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CGI

107
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,834
AMERICAN INITIATIVE.

108
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,038
I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC.

109
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:05,838
THERE IS ONE INITIATIVE THAT

110
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,606
CAME OUT OF THE MEETINGS LAST

111
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,574
YEAR HERE.

112
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,842
I AM FROM MICHIGAN.

113
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,577
I WAS JUST BACK TO DETROIT

114
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,147
VISITING.

115
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,049
TAKE US THROUGH THAT INITIATIVE.

116
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,950
HOW DID IT WORK?

117
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,254
PRESIDENT CLINTON: DETROIT WAS

118
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,257
COMING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY.

119
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,360
THERE WAS A VIGOROUS NEW MAYOR.

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,329
HE REALLY WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE

121
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,198
MOVE DOWNTOWN IN A HURRY.

122
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:36,202
WHEN HE BECAME MAYOR, HE WAS IN

123
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:40,740
CONTROL OF 50% OF THE LAND MASS

124
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,675
IN DOWNTOWN DETROIT.

125
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,509
SOME OF THE PROPERTY NEEDED TO

126
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,279
BE CLEARED BECAUSE THEY COULD

127
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,449
USE MORE GREEN SPACE.

128
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,884
IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE ANYBODY

129
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:52,652
WOULD COME BACK TO LIVE THERE.

130
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,621
THERE WERE 10,000 STRUCTURALLY

131
00:05:55,621 --> 00:06:02,028
SOUND CAPITAL STRUCTURES --

132
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,862
HABITABLE STRUCTURES.

133
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,764
PEOPLE WANTED TO HELP DETROIT

134
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,898
COME BACK.

135
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,900
THEY ALL NEEDED REPAIRS.

136
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,071
THE BANKS HAD THE VALUE OF THE

137
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:17,143
HOME BASED ONLY ON THE

138
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:17,610
STRUCTURE.

139
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,210
SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE

140
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,514
MAGNIFICENT.

141
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:25,885
THEY WERE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE

142
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,689
OTHER HOUSES WERE FAKE IT.

143
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,523
THE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO MOVE

144
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,892
DOWNTOWN AFFORD TO BUY THE HOME

145
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,395
AND REPAIR IT.

146
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:40,633
THEY NEEDED MORE MORTGAGE HELP

147
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,434
THAN WHAT A BANK COULD LEGALLY

148
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:46,038
GIVE THEM ON A FIRST MORTGAGE.

149
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,041
THE MAYOR TALKED ABOUT IT.

150
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,010
I HAVE A REAL INTEREST IN

151
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:57,583
DETROIT AND WANTED TO HELP.

152
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,351
I HAVE A REAL INTEREST IN

153
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,254
DETROIT AND WANTED TO HELP.

154
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,391
SOME WERE FROM OUT OF TOWN.

155
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,158
THEY JUST PUT THEIR HEADS

156
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,259
TOGETHER FOR THREE DAYS AND THEY

157
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,161
CAME UP WITH THE SITE VIA OF HOW

158
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:10,329
A SECOND MORTGAGE COULD BE

159
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,299
ISSUED THAT WOULD ENABLE THE

160
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,334
HOMEOWNER TO MAKE THE HOME

161
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:20,006
HABITABLE AND THE REPAYMENT

162
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:20,806
COULD BE STRUCTURED IN A WAY

163
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:21,540
THAT WOULD NOT CRIPPLE THEM

164
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,742
FINANCIALLY.

165
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:27,013
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

166
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:27,780
IT PUT 1000 PEOPLE MORE IN

167
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,581
HOMES.

168
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,983
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING

169
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:31,784
THAT WILL HAVE APPLICATIONS IN

170
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,620
OTHER DISTRESSED AREAS IN THE

171
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,855
UNITED STATES.

172
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,791
I HOPE SO.

173
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,961
DAVID: WHAT WAS IT THAT HAD

174
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,164
FAILED?

175
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:45,998
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

176
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:51,537
WITHOUT THE CGI AMERICA.

177
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,371
WELL-MEANING PEOPLE COULD NOT

178
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,005
HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER.

179
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,106
WHAT WAS THE FAILURE IN THAT?

180
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:59,478
PRESIDENT CLINTON: IT'S NOT SO

181
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,849
MUCH THE FAILURE.

182
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:04,717
IT'S DIFFICULT IN A COMPLEX

183
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:09,355
SOCIETY TO SET UP A SYSTEM THAT

184
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,056
LOOKS AT EVERY POTENTIAL

185
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,657
PROBLEM.

186
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,392
IF WE HAD NOT HAD THE FINANCIAL

187
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,930
CRASH, THESE BANKS THAT THERE

188
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,731
WAS ENOUGH SLACK FROM REGULATORS

189
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:22,702
TO DO SOMETHING THEY CLEARLY

190
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,836
SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE.

191
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,706
NOW THEY COULD DO IT.

192
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,774
WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO CLOSE A

193
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,844
GAP IN THE FABRIC OF OUR HOUSING

194
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,113
MARKET.

195
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:34,980
THAT IS REALLY WHAT I WAS TRYING

196
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,116
TO DO WHEN I STARTED MY

197
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,186
FOUNDATION 15 YEARS AGO.

198
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,020
I WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

199
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,091
SOLVE PROBLEMS AT LOWER COST

200
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:45,858
THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE

201
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,225
SOLVED.

202
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,061
I SAW THIS A LOT.

203
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,130
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF

204
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,898
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSING LAW

205
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:54,200
AND CHANGING LIVES.

206
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,704
THERE IS A GREAT VILLA OF

207
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,505
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPROPRIATING

208
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,273
MONEY AND CHANGING LIVES.

209
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,375
I THINK THE MORE COMPLEX AND

210
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,279
INTERDEPENDENT ARE SOCIETY GETS,

211
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,881
THE MORE PREMIUM WE PUT ON

212
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,682
PEOPLE WHO CAN ANSWER THE HOW

213
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,484
QUESTION.

214
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:16,589
WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE

215
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,860
EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE.

216
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,428
IF THEY WANT TO GET A JOB DONE,

217
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,364
IF THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT

218
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,900
THE POLITICS ARE AND THEY'RE

219
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,569
JUST TRYING TO GET A JOB DONE,

220
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,805
YOU FIND A WAY TO DO IT FASTER

221
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,141
AND AT LOWER COST.

222
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,742
DAVID: YOU HAVE A BODY OF WORK

223
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,109
NOW.

224
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,111
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED OVER THOSE

225
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,214
YEARS?

226
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,049
WHAT CAN BE ADDRESSED AND SOLVED

227
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,518
BY THIS SORT OF COOPERATIVE

228
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,420
EFFORT?

229
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,287
WHICH DON'T FIT SO WELL?

230
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,391
RESIDENT BUTTON: -- PRESIDENT

231
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,460
CLINTON: LET'S START WITH THE

232
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,362
SECOND CATEGORY.

233
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,433
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT

234
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,770
REQUIRE A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF

235
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,538
INVESTMENT FROM THE PRIVATE

236
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,641
SECTOR OR GOVERNMENT.

237
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,609
WITHOUT THAT, YOU CAN'T DO IT

238
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,844
YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO.

239
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,814
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

240
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,783
YOU ARE FROM FLINT.

241
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,720
FLINT IS NOT THE ONLY CITY IN

242
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,289
THE COUNTRY WHERE CHILDREN HAVE

243
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,156
ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR

244
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,926
BLOOD.

245
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,328
WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD TO

246
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,963
HELP FLINT.

247
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,000
IT WOULD TAKE A NATIONAL

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,036
COMMITMENT TO SERIOUS

249
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,938
INFRASTRUCTURE TO TAKE OUT ALL

250
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,140
THE RUSTY PIPES IN AMERICA AND

251
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,941
GIVE THE KIDS A HEALTHY FUTURE.

252
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:47,112
IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD

253
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:47,880
INVESTMENT AND CREATE A LOT OF

254
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,117
JOBS.

255
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:52,985
THERE WOULD STILL BE PROBLEMS IN

256
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,553
PARTICULAR PLACES.

257
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,323
THAT'S A THRESHOLD THING.

258
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,593
WE CAN NOW BECAUSE SOLAR AND

259
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,397
WIND POWER ARE CHEAP THAN THEY

260
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,166
WERE -- CHEAPER THAN THEY WERE,

261
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,202
WE CAN PUT TOGETHER A COALITION

262
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,305
TO ACCELERATE THE INCOME

263
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,208
BENEFITS IN THE CLIMATE AND FITS

264
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:20,679
OF SOLAR AND WIND POWER --

265
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,380
BENEFITS OF SOLAR AND WIND

266
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,748
POWER.

267
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,051
IF, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WANT TO

268
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,487
HELP THE POOREST AMERICANS

269
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:35,528
LIVING ON INDIAN LAND WITHOUT

270
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,362
CASINOS, A LOT OF THEM COULD BE

271
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,264
MAKING A FORTUNE OUT OF THIS.

272
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:38,998
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE

273
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,068
TRANSMISSION LINES TO CARRY THE

274
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:43,836
POWER TO ANY PLACE THAT CAN

275
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,270
RECEIVE IT.

276
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,741
THOSE ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN'T

277
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,542
DO.

278
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,342
THE THINGS YOU CAN DO INVOLVE

279
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,111
GETTING PEOPLE TO RETHINK WHAT

280
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,246
THEY ARE DOING.

281
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:58,350
YOU CAN SEE IF THEY CAN BE

282
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,619
FAITHFUL TO THEIR

283
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,387
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THEIR

284
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,757
ASSETS AND DO IT IN A WAY WITH

285
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,759
MORE SOCIAL BENEFIT.

286
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,627
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

287
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,997
THIS IS ONE QUICK ONE.

288
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:12,865
I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION FIVE

289
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,902
YEARS AGO WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

290
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:27,245
THE AFL-CIO.

291
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:31,117
LABOR IS UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

292
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,019
I THINK HE SHOULD CONSIDER

293
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,088
TAKING YOUR WELL-FUNDED PENSION

294
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,091
FUND AND INVESTING MONEY IN THE

295
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,127
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS,

296
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,963
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR -- ENERGY

297
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,396
RETROFITS.

298
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:49,201
THAT WOULD A LOT OF UNION

299
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,002
WORKERS TO WORK IN THE PRIVATE

300
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,705
SECTOR.

301
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,539
IT WOULD HELP THE PENSION FUND

302
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,374
IT.

303
00:12:55,374 --> 00:13:02,314
HE JUST CHEWED ON IT AND GOT ME

304
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,450
IN TOUCH WITH SOME PEOPLE.

305
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,487
WE GOT $10 BILLION IN

306
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,655
COMMITMENTS.

307
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,559
NOW THE COMMITMENT IS $14

308
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,995
BILLION.

309
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,863
THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED.

310
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,734
SOME OF IT HAS BEEN SPENT AND

311
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,536
100,000 JOBS A BEEN CREATED

312
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,772
DOING THESE BUILDING RETROFIT

313
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,141
PROJECTS.

314
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,909
IT CREATED A LOT OF JOBS.

315
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,211
IT'S DONE A WORLD OF GOOD.

316
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:36,715
THE PENSION FUNDS HAVE BEEN

317
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,284
RETURNED.

318
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,487
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING I DO.

319
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,421
HOW CAN YOU DO SOMETHING

320
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,391
DIFFERENTLY?

321
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,527
COCA-COLA IS ONE OF THE HOSTS OF

322
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,596
THIS CGI AMERICA.

323
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,566
THEY JOINED WITH PEPSICO.

324
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,603
DAVID: HOW ABOUT THAT?

325
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:04,376
PRESIDENT CLINTON: THEY AGREED

326
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,512
TO CHANGE WHAT THEY WERE PUTTING

327
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,814
IN THE DRINKS GOING TO CHILDREN

328
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,951
IN OUR SCHOOLS.

329
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,921
WITH VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS, THEY

330
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,158
REDUCED THE CALORIES GOING TO

331
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,527
KIDS IN SCHOOL BY 90%.

332
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,394
THAT'S THE STUFF I TRY TO GET

333
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,163
PEOPLE TO DO.

334
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:29,535
DAVID: GIVEN THAT TRACK RECORD,

335
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,302
LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT YOU

336
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,471
EXPECT AND HOPE WILL HAPPEN NEXT

337
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,305
NOVEMBER, WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR

338
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,140
INITIATIVE IF YOUR WIFE IS

339
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,275
PRESIDENT?

340
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,546
PRESIDENT CLINTON: I WANT TO SAY

341
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,916
WHAT SHE DID.

342
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,683
IF SHE WINS, WE WILL HAVE TO

343
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,250
THINK ABOUT IT.

344
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,688
THERE ARE CLEARLY THINGS THAT

345
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,558
ARE DIFFERENT.

346
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,127
I JUST TRY TO GET PARTNERS

347
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:55,961
TOGETHER AND MAKE SOMETHING GOOD

348
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,930
HAPPEN.

349
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,732
THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO

350
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,067
INVOLVE MORE PEOPLE FROM THE

351
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,002
PRIVATE SECTOR AND A LOT OF HIS

352
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:04,937
DECISION-MAKING.

353
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,174
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO AVOID

354
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,145
ACTUAL POTENTIAL CONFLICTS.

355
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,013
DAVID: DONALD TRUMP HAS RAISED

356
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,048
THAT.

357
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,151
IT GETS DICIER.

358
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,221
PRESIDENT CLINTON: WE WILL THINK

359
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,057
VERY CLEARLY ABOUT IT AND WE

360
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:30,061
WILL DO THE RIGHT THING.

361
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:30,796
WE WILL EXPLAIN IT TO THE

362
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,563
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

363
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,431
I WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

364
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:37,703
I DON'T BELIEVE IN CHICKENS --

365
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,470
COUNTING YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE

366
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,939
THEY HATCH.

367
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,706
WE WILL SEE HOW THE ELECTION

368
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,574
UNFOLDS.

369
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:47,813
THERE WILL CLEARLY BE SOME

370
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:48,547
CHANGES AND WHAT THE CLINTON

371
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,448
FOUNDATION DOESN'T HOW WE DO IT.

372
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,716
WE WILL HAVE TO CROSS THAT

373
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,019
BRIDGE WHEN WE COME TO IT.

374
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:54,920
DAVID: YOU SERVED AS PRESIDENT

375
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,822
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

376
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,691
THERE WAS SOME HEATED RHETORIC

377
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,926
BACK-AND-FORTH AND UP AND DOWN.

378
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,494
WHAT WE SEE IN THIS ELECTION

379
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,632
STRIKES ME OF HAVING A LEVEL OF

380
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,468
PERSONAL ATTACK.

381
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,269
IT'S NOT UNIQUELY ON THE

382
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,303
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

383
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,137
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CANDIDATES

384
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:16,408
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AS WELL.

385
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,209
IS THIS A PERMANENT CHANGE IN

386
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,211
THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN THIS

387
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,182
COUNTRY?

388
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,585
PRESIDENT CLINTON: I DON'T KNOW.

389
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,654
IT'S EASIER TO SAY THINGS THAT

390
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,557
DON'T MAKE A LICK OF SENSE NOW.

391
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,660
SO MANY OF OUR PEOPLE ARE SILENT

392
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,695
IN THEIR INFORMATION.

393
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:46,238
I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, WE

394
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,675
ARE LESS SEXIST, RACIST, AND

395
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,912
HOME -- HOMOPHOBIC THAN WE USED

396
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,813
TO BE.

397
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,883
OUR BIGOTRY IS WE DON'T WANT TO

398
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,953
BE AROUND 70 DISAGREES WITH US.

399
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,488
-- SOMEONE WHO DISAGREES WITH

400
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:08,358
US.

401
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,529
IF YOU'RE IN THAT SILO, YOU

402
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,329
BELIEVE ANYTHING YOUR PREJUDICE

403
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,762
WILL ALLOW.

404
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,432
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US.

405
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:17,169
ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE THESE

406
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:17,970
EVENTS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE HERE

407
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,505
COME FROM THERE HE POLITICAL

408
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:21,006
PERSPECTIVES.

409
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,407
THEY MAKE A LIVING DIFFERENT

410
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,444
WAYS.

411
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,646
THEY FIND IT STIMULATING TO BE

412
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,649
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT.

413
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,185
THEY FIND THAT WHAT WE KNOW IS

414
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,722
DIVERSE GROUPS MAKE BETTER

415
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,827
DECISIONS THAN LOAN GENIUSES.

416
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,097
MUCH LESS A GROUP OF TOTALLY

417
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,299
LIKE THINKING PEOPLE.

418
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,133
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE

419
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,703
TO THAT.

420
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,504
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

421
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,171
BREAK OUT OF OUR SILOS.

422
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,706
FUNDAMENTALLY, PEOPLE ARE

423
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,107
DECENT.

424
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,144
A LOT OF THESE CAMPAIGNS HAVE

425
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,145
GOTTEN HARSHER AND HARSHER

426
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,281
BECAUSE OF THE LONG DRAG AFTER

427
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,249
THE CRASH.

428
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,352
IN MANY PLACES, THERE IS A

429
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,821
COMBINATION OF STAGNANT INCOMES

430
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:13,091
AND DISRUPTIVE THREATS TO

431
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,593
IDENTITY.

432
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,664
EUROPE HAS THE BIGGEST REFUGEE

433
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,566
CRISIS SINCE WORLD WAR II.

434
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,770
YOU HAD A CONTEST AND AUSTRIA.

435
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,638
IT'S A CLOSE CONTEST.

436
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,709
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

437
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,743
THINK THEY CAN MAKE THEIR

438
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,945
TOMORROW'S -- CAN'T MAKE THEIR

439
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:34,746
TOMORROW'S BETTER.

440
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,783
THEY FEEL CONSCIOUSLY OR

441
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,953
SUBCONSCIOUSLY THAT THE WORLD

442
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,621
DISRESPECTS OR DISREGARDS THEM

443
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,125
OR DOESN'T SEE THEM.

444
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,761
THEY ARE LESS OFFENDED IF

445
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,196
SOMEBODY ELSE IS IN THE

446
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,633
TREATMENT.

447
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,467
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO BE A LOT

448
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,268
MORE SENSITIVE.

449
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,205
WE NEED TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO

450
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:00,972
WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS ARE GOING

451
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:03,342
THROUGH.

452
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,312
I THINK IF WE DID THAT, WE WOULD

453
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,015
CHANGE THE CULTURE BACK TO WHERE

454
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:14,887
OUR POLITICS IS MORE HUMANE.

455
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,654
DAVID: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

456
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,857
GROWING THE ECONOMY.

457
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,691
IT STRIKES ME THAT ONE OF THE

458
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,526
THINGS INJECTED THIS TIME IS

459
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,428
QUESTIONING THE QUALIFICATIONS

460
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,630
TO SERVE.

461
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,000
IT'S ONE THING TO DISAGREE, IT'S

462
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,768
ONE THING TO SAY I WOULD BE

463
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,772
BETTER, IT'S DIFFERENT TO SAY

464
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,673
YOU SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED FOR

465
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,476
THE OFFICE.

466
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,076
WHAT SHOULD BE THE

467
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:38,877
QUALIFICATIONS WE ARE LOOKING

468
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:39,177
FOR?

469
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:47,119
PRESIDENT CLINTON: THAT'S A

470
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,188
DECISION THE VOTERS MAKE EVERY

471
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:56,661
ELECTION.

472
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,396
I WAS WELL-SUITED TO BE

473
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,830
PRESIDENT WHEN I WAS ELECTED

474
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,166
BECAUSE I WAS A GOVERNOR AND MY

475
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,903
STATE HAD A FAST-GROWING ECONOMY

476
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,206
AND A BIG IMPROVEMENT IN THE

477
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,040
THINGS AMERICA NEEDED TO IMPROVE

478
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:17,048
ON.

479
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:17,883
BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT PEOPLE WERE

480
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,351
UP AGAINST.

481
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:27,692
AT A MINIMUM, YOU WANT SOMEBODY

482
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,095
WHO BELIEVES THAT WE ARE NOT

483
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:35,734
JUST A PLACE WHERE --, WE ARE AN

484
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,904
IDEA.

485
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,704
WE ARE BORN TO WELCOME PEOPLE

486
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,907
FROM EVERY PLACE WHO LOVE

487
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,774
FREEDOM AND BELIEVE IN THE RULE

488
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,545
OF LAW AND RESPECT OTHER

489
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:51,649
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.

490
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:52,517
SOMEONE WITH A PROVEN RECORD OF

491
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,919
BEING ABLE TO DO THAT.

492
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,756
WE DO HAVE OTHER RULES THAT

493
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:03,194
DEVELOP OVER TIME.

494
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:08,433
THE VOTERS DECIDE THAT.

495
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,237
THEY DECIDE WHO IS QUALIFIED.

496
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:17,242
I THINK MY JOB IS TO SUPPORT ONE

497
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:21,279
PARTICULAR CANDIDATE WHO I THINK

498
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,714
IS THE MOST QUALIFIED PERSON IN

499
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,448
AMERICA TO SERVE AT THIS

500
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,417
PARTICULAR TIME.

501
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,921
WE NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS

502
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,524
HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN ADD SOME

503
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:37,262
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CAN MAKE

504
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,765
PROSPERITY MORE WIDELY SHARED TO

505
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,701
REDUCE INEQUALITY AND INCREASE

506
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,171
UPWARD MOBILITY.

507
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,741
THEY CAN BREAK POLITICAL

508
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,876
GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON.

509
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:55,981
OUR ECONOMIC FATE IS TIED UP

510
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,815
WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF

511
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,083
THE WORLD.

512
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,820
IN THE LAST ECONOMIC REPORT

513
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,424
THERE WAS A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS.

514
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:12,264
MORE THAN $.61 OF A DOLLAR ON

515
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,367
CORPORATE DOLLARS WENT TO WAGES.

516
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,303
A PIECE OF BAD NEWS WAS IN SPITE

517
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:23,074
OF HIRING, GROWTH HAD DROPPED

518
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:26,344
BACK DUE ENTIRELY TO WHAT'S

519
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:30,748
HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD.

520
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:34,185
BRAZIL, CHINA SLOWING DOWN,

521
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:37,656
SOUTHEAST ASIA, ALL OF THESE

522
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:42,293
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON.

523
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:43,762
IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB RIGHT NOW.

524
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,399
IT'S A DOABLE ONE.

525
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,300
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

526
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,203
WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

527
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:57,042
DAVID: -- 

528
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,946
MARK: WE ARE INTERRUPTING OUR

529
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,415
CONVERSATION WITH BILL CLINTON.

530
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,350
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SET TO SPEAK

531
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,986
ON TERRORISM.

532
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:08,653
HE IS AT THE TREASURY

533
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,722
DEPARTMENT.

534
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,489
WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS

535
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,726
STORY TODAY.

536
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,560
GIVEN THE EVENTS IN ORLANDO AND

537
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,363
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT OUTSIDE

538
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,366
PARIS, A MAN WHO HAD ALLEGIANCE

539
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,770
TO ISLAMIC STATE WAS RESPONSIBLE

540
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,471
FOR THE DEATH OF A POLICE

541
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,472
OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE.

542
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,808
WHAT CAN THE PRESIDENT SAY TODAY

543
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,510
THAT WILL ALLAY PEOPLE'S FEARS?

544
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,113
ANGELA: HE IS MEETING WITH HIS

545
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,047
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

546
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:36,848
THIS MEETING WAS PREVIOUSLY

547
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,617
SCHEDULED.

548
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,719
THE TENOR OF THE MEETING HAS

549
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,954
TAKEN A DIFFERENT TONE.

550
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:43,755
WHAT WE EXPECT TO HEAR THE

551
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,491
PRESIDENT SAY IS HE IS DOING

552
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,393
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO BE AWARE

553
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,864
AND TRACKING A POTENTIAL ATTACK,

554
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:53,598
LONE WOLVES LIKE WE SAW IN

555
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:53,965
ORLANDO.

556
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,969
HE WILL CALL FOR HIS GUN CONTROL

557
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:02,841
TO BE IN -- ENACTED.

558
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,608
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME

559
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,810
MEASURES AS PART OF HIS LEGACY.

560
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,280
HE IS NOT GIVING UP ON WAYS TO

561
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,653
MAKE SOME OF THOSE CHANGES.

562
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:16,488
MARK: YOU TALK ABOUT THE LONE

563
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:21,393
WOLF ATTACKS, CONGRESS HAS SAID

564
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,294
THIS IS THE THING THAT GIVES

565
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,597
THEM PAUSE, THE THING THAT KEEPS

566
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,665
THEM AWAKE AND NIGHT.

567
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,936
IF ONE HAS NOT PLEDGED

568
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:31,803
ALLEGIANCE, THEY MAY BECOME SELF

569
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,504
RADICALIZED.

570
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,608
ARE THERE STEPS THAT CAN BE

571
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,610
TAKEN TO PREVENT OR IDENTIFY

572
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,181
THIS PROBLEM #ANGELA: THAT'S

573
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:43,915
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

574
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:44,482
TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

575
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:49,187
HE HAS ADVISERS HE IS MEETING

576
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:53,658
WITH.

577
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,928
>> IS EVERYBODY ALL SET?

578
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:00,198
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I JUST MET WITH

579
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,102
MY SECURITY TEAM.

580
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,138
OUR MEETING WAS PLANNED BEFORE

581
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,875
THE TERRIBLE ATTACK IN ORLANDO.

582
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:17,983
THAT TRAGEDY, THE AWFUL LOSS OF

583
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,817
LIFE, SHAPED MUCH OF OUR WORK

584
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:19,351
TODAY.

585
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,153
IN ALL OF OUR EFFORTS, FOREMOST

586
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:28,460
IN OUR MINDS IS THE LOSS AND THE

587
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,494
GRIEF OF THE PEOPLE OF ORLANDO

588
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:36,167
PEOPLE -- ORLANDO.

589
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,536
FAMILIES OF SEEING LOVED ONES

590
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:44,209
HARMED, THE FRIENDS OF OURS WHO

591
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:49,080
ARE LESBIAN AND GAY AND BISEXUAL

592
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,814
AND TRANSGENDER WHO WERE

593
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,782
TARGETED.

594
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,718
I WANT TO REMIND THEM THAT THEY

595
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,054
ARE NOT ALONE.

596
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:56,855
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR

597
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:01,092
ALLIES AND FRIENDS ALL OVER THE

598
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:05,497
WORLD STAND WITH YOU.

599
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,331
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT YOU AND

600
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:06,898
PRAYING FOR YOU.

601
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:13,705
AS DIRECTOR KOMI HAS SAID -- FBI

602
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:18,143
DIRECTOR KOMI HAS SAID, WE HAVE

603
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:23,214
NO INTELLIGENCE THAT A FOREIGN

604
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,215
GROUP DIRECTED IT.

605
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,085
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SHOOTER

606
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,320
TOOK IN INFORMATION OVER THE

607
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,355
INTERNET.

608
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:34,392
HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN

609
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,428
ANGRY, DISTURBED, UNSTABLE YOUNG

610
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:39,431
MAN WHO BECAME RADICALIZED.

611
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,734
TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE CALLED ON

612
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,703
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO

613
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:53,110
ATTACK INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

614
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,913
THOSE POSTINGS ARE PERVASIVE.

615
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,816
THEY ARE MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE

616
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:01,286
THAN WE WANT.

617
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,121
THIS INDIVIDUAL APPEARS TO HAVE

618
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,091
ABSORBED SOME OF THAT.

619
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,361
THE SHOOTER IN ORLANDO PLEDGED

620
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:13,231
ALLEGIANCE TO ISIL.

621
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:18,102
THESE LONE ACTORS ARE VERY HARD

622
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,406
TO DETECT AND VERY HARD TO

623
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,674
PREVENT.

624
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:30,448
ACROSS OUR GOVERNMENT, WE ARE

625
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,418
DOING EVERYTHING IN HER POWER TO

626
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,620
STOP THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS.

627
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,157
WE WORK TO SUCCEED 100% OF THE

628
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:39,557
TIME.

629
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,493
AN ATTACKER ONLY HAS TO SUCCEED

630
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,695
ONCE.

631
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,731
OUR PERSONNEL AND OUR

632
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,565

OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE

634
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,770
PREVENTED MANY ATTACKS AND SAVED

635
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,205
MANY LIVES.

636
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,940
WE CAN NEVER THANK THEM ENOUGH.

637
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,078
WE ARE ALL SOBERED BY THE FACT

638
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,779
THAT DESPITE THE EXTRAORDINARY

639
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:06,084
HARD WORK, SOMETHING LIKE

640
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,118
ORLANDO CAN OCCUR.

641
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,289
THE DEI DIRECTOR IN -- UPDATED

I WANT TO THANK TREASURY FOR

CUT OFF THE MONEY THAT FUNDS

650
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,016
ISIS.

651
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,716
I WANT TO REITERATE OUR

652
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,183
OBJECTIVE.

653
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:44,789
OUR MISSION IS TO DESTROY ISIS.

654
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,827
WE'VE SEEN THE DIFFICULT FIGHT.

655
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,728
WE ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT

656
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,896
PROGRESS.

657
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:56,200
I HAVE AUTHORIZED STEPS TO

00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,935
RATCHET UP OUR FIGHT AGAINST

659
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,036
ISIS.

660
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:04,476
SPECIAL FORCES ARE IN SYRIA.

661
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,310
ADDITIONAL ADVISERS ARE WORKING

662
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,279
WITH THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES.

663
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,016
ADDITIONAL ASSETS HAVE BEEN

664
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,754
PROVIDED.

665
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,455
OUR AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO LAUNCH

666
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:23,528
FROM THE USS HARRY TRUMAN NOW IN

667
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,128
THE MEDITERRANEAN.

668
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:25,764
OUR B-52 BOMBERS ARE HITTING

669
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,900
ISIL WITH PRECISION STRIKES.

670
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,868
TARGETS ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AND

671
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:34,205
HIT EVEN MORE QUICKLY.

672
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:34,939
13,000 AIRSTRIKES OF BEEN

673
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,041
CARRIED OUT SO FAR.

674
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,379
WE ARE FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS.

675
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,246
ISIL IS UNDER MORE PRESSURE THAN

676
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:43,148
EVER BEFORE.

677
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,916
THEY LOSE KEY LEADERS.

678
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:49,020
THIS INCLUDES THE SENIOR

679
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,956
MILITARY LEADER IN MOZ OH.

680
00:29:51,956 --> 00:30:05,536
-- MOZ OH.

681
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:10,108
SO FAR, WE'VE TAKEN OUT 120 TOP

682
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,576
ISIL LEADERS AND COMMANDERS.

683
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,411
OUR MESSAGE IS CLEAR.

684
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,480
IF YOU TARGET AMERICA, YOU WILL

685
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,648
NOT BE SAFE.

686
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,583
YOU WILL NEVER BE SAFE.

687
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,419
ISIL CONTINUES TO LOSE GROUND IN

688
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,620
IRAQ.

689
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,657
IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS, LOCAL

690
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,326
FORCES HAVE LIBERATED A WESTERN

691
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,830
TOWN AND PUSHED UP THE EUPHRATES

692
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,698
RIVER VALLEY.

693
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,969
THEY HAVE BREAK IN THE SIEGE.

694
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:42,540
-- BROKEN THE SIEGE.

695
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,408
THEY HAVE SURROUNDED FALLUJA AND

STARTED TO MOVE INTO THE CITY.

697
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,179
THEY PUSH UP THE TIGRIS RIVER

698
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,247
VALLEY.

699
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,048
THEY ARE PREPARING TO TIGHTEN

700
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,085
THE NOOSE IN MOZ OH.

701
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,721
THEY HAVE LOST HALF OF THE

702
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:00,224
TERRITORY IT ONCE CONTROLLED AND

703
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:02,994
IT WILL LOSE MORE.

704
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:03,828
ISIS LOSES GROUND IN SYRIA AS

705
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:12,736
WELL.

706
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:15,673
THE NEWS IS TIGHTENING AROUND

707
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,877
THEM AS WELL.

708
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,746
OUR COALITION IS ON OFFENSE.

709
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,649
IT HAS BEEN A FULL YEAR SINCE

710
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:34,225
THEY HAVE AS THEY CONTINUE TO

711
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,962
LOSE TERRITORY, IT LOSES THE

712
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:42,566
MONEY THAT IS ITS LIFEBLOOD.

713
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:45,203
WE BELIEVE WE HAVE CUT THE

714
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,139
REVENUE BY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

715
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:48,539
PER MONTH.

716
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:54,479
WE HAVE DESTROYED THE STORAGE

717
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,179
SITES WHERE THEY KEEP THEIR

718
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:55,546
CASH.

719
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,582
THANKS TO THE GREAT WORK OF MANY

720
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,853
OTHERS HERE TODAY AND WORKING

721
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,553
WITH NATIONS AND FINANCIAL

722
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:03,421
INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD,

723
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,622
THEY ARE CUT OFF FROM THE

724
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,359
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

725
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,193
CUTTING OFF THEIR MONEY MAY NOT

726
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,995
BE AS DRAMATIC, IT IS CRITICALLY

727
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:14,332
IMPORTANT AREA THEIR CASH

728
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,200
RESERVES ARE DOWN.

729
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,370
THEY HAVE HAD TO CUT SALARIES.

730
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,271
THEY ARE RELATING TO MORE

731
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,474
EXTORTION.

732
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,243
SOME OF THE LEADERS HAVE BEEN

733
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,714
CAUGHT STEALING CASH AND GOLD.

734
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:30,481
THEIR TRUE NATURE HAS BEEN

735
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,316
REVEALED.

736
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:36,621
THESE ARE NOT RELIGIOUS LEADERS.

737
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:41,059
THEY ARE THUGS AND THIEVES.

738
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:41,859
I WANT TO MENTION THAT IT IS

739
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,660
CRITICAL FOR OUR FRIENDS IN THE

740
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,332
SENATE TO CONFIRM I NOMINEE FOR

741
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:49,767
UNDERSECRETARY OF TERRORISM AND

742
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:50,601
FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE.

743
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,437
ADAM HAS SERVED IN BOTH

744
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:55,974
ADMINISTRATIONS.

745
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,077
EVERYONE AGREES HE IS QUALIFIED.

746
00:32:59,077 --> 00:32:59,911
HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON THESE

747
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:05,316
KINDS OF ISSUES FOR YEARS.

748
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,184
IT'S NOW BEEN IT MORE THAN A

749
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,885
YEAR SINCE I NOMINATED HIM.

750
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,154
HE STILL HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN A

751
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,289
VOTE.

752
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,257
THERE IS NO GOOD REASON FOR IT.

753
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,461
IT IS INEXCUSABLE.

754
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,395
IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE TO DO

755
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,229
ITS JOB AND PUT OUR NATIONAL

756
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:23,701
SECURITY FIRST AND HAVE A VOTE.

757
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,502
HE CAN HELP KEEP OUR COUNTRY

758
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,705
SAFE.

759
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,609
ICICLES RANKS ARE -- THEIR RANKS

760
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:35,747
ARE SHRINKING AS WELL.

761
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,380
MORALE IS SINKING.

762
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,918
AS ONE DEFECTOR SAID, THEY ARE

763
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:41,686
NOT BRINGING ISLAM TO THE WORLD

764
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,654
AND PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT.

765
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,289
THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS

766
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,525
INCLUDING FROM AMERICA HAS

767
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,760
PLUMMETED.

768
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,596
OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SAYS

769
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,897
THE RANKS HAS BEEN LOSE TO THE

770
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:57,735
LOWEST LEVELS IN MORE THAN 2.5

771
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:02,473
YEARS.

772
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,108
WE ARE ADDRESSING THE LARGER

773
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:04,842
FORCES THAT HAVE ALLOWED THE

774
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,812
TERRORIST TO GRAIN -- GAIN

775
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,147
TRACTION.

776
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:14,018
THIS MEANS HELPING IRAQIS

777
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,253
STABILIZE COMMUNITIES AND

778
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,356
PROMOTE SO THE ISIL CANNOT

779
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,389
RETURN.

780
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,926
THIS MEANS OUR CONTINUED SUPPORT

781
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,463
FOR THE FRAGILE END OF

782
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,966
HOSTILITIES IN SYRIA.

783
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,568
THIS HAS NOT STOPPED ALL OR EVEN

784
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,638
MOST OF THE HARDSHIP ON THE

785
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:38,141
SYRIAN PEOPLE.

786
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:39,911
THE ASSIGNED REGIME HAS BEEN THE

787
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:45,983
PRINCIPAL CULPRIT.

788
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,487
ISIL AND ITS AFFILIATE IN SYRIA

789
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:55,293
CONTINUES TO TERRORIZE SYRIANS.

790
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,395
AS FRAGILE AND INCOMPLETE AS IT

791
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,195
IS, IT HAS SAVED LIVES AND IT

792
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:02,199
HAS ALLOWED THE DELIVERY OF SOME

793
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,201
LIFE-SAVING AID TO SYRIANS WHO

794
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,336
ARE IN DESPERATE NEED.

795
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:10,141
WE WILL CONTINUE TO AND THE

796
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,410
CIVIL WAR AND RESULT IN A

797
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,583
TRANSITION AWAY FROM A SOD.

798
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,854
ISIL IS LOSING GROUND IN LIBYA.

799
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:23,688
FORCES OF THE UNITY GOVERNMENT

800
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,858
ARE GOING AFTER ISIL IN A

801
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:27,692
STRONGHOLD.

802
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,495
IT WILL RESIST THE NEW LIBYAN

803
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:33,564
GOVERNMENT AS IT WORKS TO SECURE

804
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,001
ITS COUNTRY.

805
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:42,740
LASTLY, HERE AT HOME, IF WE

806
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,441
REALLY WANT TO HELP LAW

807
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,208
ENFORCEMENT PROTECT AMERICANS

808
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:49,714
FROM HOME-GROWN EXTREMISTS, THE

809
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,716
KIND OF TRAGEDIES THAT OCCURRED

810
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,152
AT SAN BERNARDINO AND NOW HAVE

811
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:59,256
OCCURRED IN ORLANDO, THERE IS A

812
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:05,596
MEANINGFUL WAY TO DO THAT.

813
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,597
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR

814
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,565
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KILL

815
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,201
AMERICANS TO GET THEIR HANDS ON

816
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:10,968
WEAPONS OF WAR THAT LET THEM

817
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,539
KILL DOZENS OF INNOCENTS.

818
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,576
HE CANNOT PREVENT EVERY TRAGEDY.

819
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,712
WE KNOW THAT.

820
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,748
CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND

821
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,417
AMENDMENT, THERE ARE STEPS THAT

822
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,719
COULD REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND

823
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,624
COULD REDUCE THE LEGALITY OF

824
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,926
SOMEBODY WHO INTENDS TO DO OTHER

825
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:36,861
PEOPLE HARM.

826
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:44,769
WE SHOULD GIVE ATF THE RESOURCES

827
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,971
PEOPLE WITH POSSIBLE TIES TO

828
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,240
TERRORISM WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED ON

829
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,074
THE PLANE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED

830
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:55,546
TO BUY A GUN.

831
00:36:55,546 --> 00:37:02,153
I'M TALKING ABOUT BEING TOUGH ON

832
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:02,620
TERRORISM.

833
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:12,763
ACTUALLY BE TOUGH.

834
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:16,567
MAKE IT HARDER TO GET WEAPONS

835
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,067
THAT KILL US.

836
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:20,438
OTHERWISE, JUST  DESPITE

837
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:25,242
EXTRAORDINARY EFORTS BY

838
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:29,847
LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE MILITARY,

839
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,581
AND ALL THE SACRIFICES THAT

840
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,750
PEOPLE MAKE, THESE EVENTS WILL

841
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,186
KEEP ON HAPPENING.

842
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,188
THE WEAPONS ARE ONLY GOING TO

843
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:41,892
 GET MORE POWERFUL.

844
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:51,368
LET ME MAKE A FINAL POINT.

845
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:52,102
FOR A WHILE NOW, THE MAIN

846
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,404
CONTRIBUTION FROM PEOPLE ON THE

847
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,906
OTHER SIDE OF THE I'LL IS TO

848
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:59,010
CRITICIZE THE ADMINISTRATION AND

849
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,311
ME FOR NOT USING THE PHRASE,

850
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:05,149
"RADICAL ISLAM," THAT IS THE

851
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,351
KEY, THEY TELL US.

852
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,152
WE CANNOT BEAT THEM UNLESS WE

853
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:12,089
CALL THEM RADICAL ISLAMIST.

854
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:17,928
WHEN EXACTLY -- WHAT EXACTLY

855
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,762
WOULD USING THIS LABEL

856
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,232
ACCOMPLISH OR CHANGE?

857
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,235
WOULD IT MAKE THEM LESS

858
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,972
COMMITTED TO TRYING TO KILL

859
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,874
AMERICANS?

860
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,142
WOULD IT BRING IN MORE ALLIES?

861
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:35,346
IS THERE A MILITARY STRATEGY

862
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:39,383
SERVED BY THIS?

863
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:44,422
THE ANSWER IS NONE OF THE ABOVE.

864
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:49,794
CALLING A THREAT BY DIFFERENT

865
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:54,898
NAME DOES NOT MAKE IT GO AWAY.

866
00:38:54,898 --> 00:39:01,005
THIS IS A POLITICAL DISTRACTION.

867
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,839
SINCE BEFORE I WAS PRESIDENT, I

868
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:11,348
HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HOW -- I

869
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:15,619
HAVE CALLED ON MUSLIMS AROUND

870
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,421
THE WORLD TO REJECT THIS

871
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,523
INTERPRETATION OF ONE OF THE

872
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,727
WORLD'S GREAT RELIGIONS.

873
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:27,932
IT HAS NOT BEEN A MOMENT IN MY

874
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,834
7.5 YEARS AS PRESIDENT WHERE WE

875
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:31,635
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PURSUE A

876
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,337
STRATEGY BECAUSE WE DID NOT USE

877
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:46,183
A LABEL, "RADICAL ISLAM."

878
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,219
NOT ONCE HAS AN ADVISOR SAID, IF

879
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,153
WE USE THAT PHRASE, WE WILL TURN

880
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,087
THIS ALL AROUND.

881
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:53,958
NOT ONCE.

882
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:59,029
IF SOMEONE SERIOUSLY THINKS THAT

883
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,097
WE DO NOT KNOW WHO WE ARE

884
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:05,603
FIGHTING, IF THERE'S ANYONE OUT

885
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,870
THERE WHO THINKS WE ARE CONFUSED

886
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:16,380
ABOUT WHO OUR ENEMIES ARE, THAT

887
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,181
WOULD COME AS A SURPRISE TO THE

888
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,949
THOUSANDS OF TERRORISTS WE HAVE

889
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,185
TAKEN OFF THE BATTLEFIELD.

890
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,053
IF THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THOSE

891
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,322
OF US UP HERE AND THE THOUSANDS

892
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:31,061
OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

893
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,896
WORLD THAT ARE WORKING TO DEFEAT

894
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:41,238
ISIL ARE NOT TAKING THE FIGHT

895
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,107
SERIOUSLY, THAT WOULD COME AS A

896
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:43,907
SURPRISE TO THOSE WHO HAVE SPENT

897
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:44,642
THE LAST 7.5 YEARS DISMANTLING

898
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,376
THEM, INCLUDING THE MEN AND

899
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,678
WOMEN IN UNIFORM WHO PUT THEIR

900
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,648
LIFE AT RISK AND THE SPECIAL

901
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,449
FORCES THAT ARE NOW ON THE

902
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,718
GROUND IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.

903
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:59,590
THEY KNOW FULL WELL WHO THE

904
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,627
ENEMY IS.

905
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,461
SO DO THE INTELLIGENCE AND LAW

906
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:05,930
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO SPEND

907
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,398
COUNTLESS HOURS DISRUPTING PLOTS

908
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:11,969
AND PROTECTING ALL AMERICANS.

909
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:18,676
INCLUDING POLITICIANS WHO TWEET

910
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:23,247
AND APPEAR ON CABLE NEWS SHOWS.

911
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,081
THEY KNOW WHO THE NATURE OF THE

912
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:28,018
ENEMY IS.

913
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,921
THERE IS NO MAGIC TO THE PHRASE,

914
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:36,660
"RADICAL ISLAM," IT IS A

915
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,762
POLITICAL TALKING POINT, NOT A

916
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,196
STRATEGY.

917
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,733
THE REASON I AM CAREFUL ABOUT

918
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,667
THE WAY I DESCRIBED THIS THREAT

919
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,338
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL

920
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,172
CORRECTNESS AND EVERYTHING TO DO

921
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,674
WITH ACTUALLY DEFEATING

922
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,175
EXTREMISM.

923
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,212
GROUPS LIKE ISIL AND AL QAEDA

924
00:41:55,212 --> 00:42:01,785
WANT TO MAKE THIS A WAR

925
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,855
BETWEEN AMERICA AND ISLAM WERE

926
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,691
ISLAM AND THE WEST.

927
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,928
THEY WANT TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE

928
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:17,468
THE TRUE LEADERS OF OVER A

929
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,270
BILLION MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD

930
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:23,941
WHO REJECT THE CRAZY NOTIONS.

931
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,943
THEY WANT US TO VALIDATE THEM BY

932
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:30,881
SAYING THAT THEY SPEAK FOR THOSE

933
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,618
BILLION PLUS PEOPLE.

934
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,352
THAT IS THEIR PROPAGANDA,

935
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,922
HEALTHY RECRUIT.

936
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:41,125
IF WE FALL INTO THE TRAP OF

937
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,494
PAINTING ALL MUSLIMS WITH A

938
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,063
BROAD BRUSH AND IMPLY THAT WE

939
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,033
ARE AT WAR WITH AN ENTIRE

940
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,969
RELIGION, THEN WE ARE DOING THE

941
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:57,875
TERRORIST WORK FOR THEM.

942
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,609
UP UNTIL THIS POINT, THIS

943
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,745
ARGUMENT ABOUT LABELS HAS MOSTLY

944
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,349
TO SPEND RHETORIC.

945
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,083
SADLY, WE HAVE ALL BECOME

946
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,719
ACCUSTOMED TO THAT KIND OF

947
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,689
PARTISANSHIP, EVEN WHEN IT

948
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:15,526
INVOLVES THE FIGHT AGAINST THESE

949
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:22,098
EXTREMIST GROUPS.

950
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:27,771
THAT KIND OF YAPPING HAS NOT

951
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,040
INVENTED FOLKS ACROSS GOVERNMENT

952
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,742
FROM DOING THEIR JOBS.

953
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,778
FROM SACRIFICING WORKING REALLY

954
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,781
HARD TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN

955
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:43,353
PEOPLE ARE WE ARE NOW SEEING HOW

956
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:45,222
DANGEROUS THIS MINDSET AND

957
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:45,823
THINKING CAN BE.

958
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,557
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE WHERE

959
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:51,028
THIS RHETORIC AND LOOSE TALK AND

960
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,096
SLOPPINESS ABOUT WHO EXACTLY WE

961
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:57,267
ARE FIGHTING, WHERE THIS CAN

962
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:02,006
LEAD US.

963
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,808
WE NOW HAVE PROPOSALS FROM THE

964
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,609
PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE

965
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:06,310
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

966
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,279
STATES TO BAR ALL MUSLIMS FROM

967
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:12,683
EMIGRATING TO AMERICA.

968
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,118
WE HEAR LANGUAGE THAT SINGLES

969
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:19,723
OUT IMMIGRANTS AND SUGGESTS

970
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,458
ANTI-RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES ARE

971
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:26,629
COMPLICIT IN VIOLENCE.

972
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:32,202
WHERE DOES THIS STOP?

973
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,138
DEAR LANDO KILLER, ONE OF THE

974
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:40,411
SAN BERNARDINO KILLERS, THE FT.

975
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,179
HOOD KILLER, THEY WERE ALL U.S.

976
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,381
CITIZENS.

977
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:48,986
ARE WE GOING TO TREAT ALL MUSLIM

978
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,321
AMERICANS DIFFERENTLY?

979
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:59,596
ARE WE GOING TO SUBJECT THEM TO

980
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,130
SURVEILLANCE?

981
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:00,898
ARE WE GOING TO DISCRIMINATE

982
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,833
THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH?

983
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,667
WE HAVE HEARD THE SUGGESTIONS

984
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,070
DURING THE COURSE OF THE

985
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:10,807
CAMPAIGN TO REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS

986
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:17,914
ACTUALLY AGREE WITH US?

987
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:23,487
THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE WANT.

988
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,187
IT DOES NOT REFLECT OUR

989
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:26,323
DEMOCRATIC IDEALS.

990
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,592
IT WILL NOT MAKE US MORE SAFE.

991
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,360
IT WILL MAKE US LESS SAFE,

992
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,796
FEELING THE NOTION THAT THE WEST

993
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:38,769
HATES MUSLIMS, MAKING YOUNG

994
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:39,503
MUSLIMS IN THIS COUNTRY AND

995
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,571
AROUND THE WORLD FEEL LIKE NO

996
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:44,541
MATTER WHAT THEY DO, THEY ARE

997
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,845
GOING TO BE UNDER SUSPICION AND

998
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:53,183
ATTACK.

999
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,219
IT MAKES MUSLIM AMERICANS FEEL

1000
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:55,986
LIKE THEIR GOVERNMENT IS THE

1001
00:45:55,986 --> 00:46:03,226
TRAIN THEM -- BETRAYING THEM.

1002
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:04,094
IT BETRAYS THE VERY VALUES THAT

1003
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:10,033
AMERICA STANDS FOR.

1004
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:10,901
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH MOMENTS IN

1005
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:11,935
OUR HISTORY BEFORE WHEN WE ACTED

1006
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,037
OUT OF FEAR, AND WE CAME TO

1007
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:21,878
REGRET IT.

1008
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:25,215
WE HAVE SEEN OUR GOVERNMENT

1009
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:29,720
MISTREAT OUR FELLOW CITIZENS.

1010
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,658
IT HAS BEEN A SHAMEFUL PART OF

1011
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,193
OUR HISTORY.

1012
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,096
THIS IS A COUNTRY FOUNDED ON

1013
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,665
BASIC FREEDOMS, INCLUDING

1014
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,300
FREEDOM OF RELIGION.

1015
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,172
WE DO NOT HAVE RELIGIOUS TESTS

1016
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,041
HERE.

1017
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:51,875
OUR FOUNDERS, OUR CONSTITUTION,

1018
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,043
OUR BILL OF RIGHTS ARE CLEAR

1019
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,280
ABOUT THAT.

1020
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,018
IF WE EVER ABANDON THOSE VALUES,

1021
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:04,254
WE WOULD NOT ONLY MAKE IT A LOT

1022
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,088
EASIER TO RADICALIZE PEOPLE HERE

1023
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,457
AND AROUND THE WORLD, BUT WE

1024
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,260
WOULD HAVE THE TRADE THE VERY

1025
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,562
THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT,

1026
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:16,967
THE PLURALISM AND OPENNESS, RULE

1027
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,202
OF LAW, CIVIL LIBERTIES, THE

1028
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:21,405
VERY THINGS THAT MAKE THIS

1029
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:25,208
COUNTRY GREAT AND MAKE US

1030
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:25,709
EXCEPTIONAL.

1031
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:33,082
THEN, THE TERRORIST WOULD HAVE

1032
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:33,483
WON.

1033
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:37,654
I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.

1034
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,958
TWO WEEKS AGO, I WAS AT THE

1035
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:41,825
COMMENCEMENT CEREMONY AT THE AIR

1036
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,695
FORCE ACADEMY.

1037
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,631
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE

1038
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,632
INSPIRING TO SEE THESE YOUNG

1039
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,500
PEOPLE STEPPING UP, DEDICATED TO

1040
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,738
SERVE AND PROTECT THIS COUNTRY.

1041
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,239
PART OF WHAT WAS INSPIRING WAS

1042
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,341
THE INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY OF

1043
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:04,314
THESE CADETS.

1044
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:08,552
WE SAW CADETS APPLAUDING

1045
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,756
CLASSMATES WHO ARE OPENLY GAY.

1046
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:16,093
WE SAW CADETS APPLAUDING

1047
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:16,927
CLASSMATES WHO WERE IMMIGRANTS

1048
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,230
AND LOVED THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH

1049
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,031
THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED TO BE

1050
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:25,168
PART OF OUR ARMED FORCES.

1051
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,002
WE SAW CADETS AND FAMILIES OF

1052
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:27,637
ALL RELIGIONS APPLIED CADETS WHO

1053
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:31,541
ARE PROUD PATRIOTIC MUSLIM

1054
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,679
AMERICANS, SERVING THEIR COUNTRY

1055
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,480
IN UNIFORM, READY TO PUT THEIR

1056
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,314
LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT YOU

1057
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,915
AND ME.

1058
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:44,688
WE SAW MILL CADETS APPLAUDING

1059
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:45,489
FEMALE CLASSMATES WHO CAN NOW

1060
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:49,826
SERVE IN COMBAT POSITIONS.

1061
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:53,130
THAT IS THE AMERICAN MILITARY.

1062
00:48:53,130 --> 00:49:00,003
THAT IS AMERICA.

1063
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,204
ONE NATION.

1064
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,707
THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT ISIL

1065
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,476
IS TRYING TO DESTROY.

1066
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,212
WE SHOULD NOT HELP THEM DO IT.

1067
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:16,086
I DIVERSITY AND RESPECT -- OUR

1068
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:16,853

EVERYBODY FAIRLY, THAT WE ARE

1073
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,200
NOT JUDGING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS

1074
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,570
OF WHAT FAITH THEY ARE, OR RACE,

1075
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:39,209
OR ETHNICITY, OR SEXUAL

1076
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,513
ORIENTATION.

1077
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,382
THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY

1078
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,818
GREAT.

1079
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,887

00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,159

1082
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,030
ISIL.

1083
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,864
THAT IS WHAT WILL PRESERVE OUR

1084
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,099
VALUES AND IDEALS THAT DEFINE US

1085
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:08,337
AS AMERICANS.

1086
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:09,406
THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO

1087
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,676
DEFEND THIS NATION AND HOW WE
