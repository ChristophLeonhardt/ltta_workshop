so we cover the elections tonight and it was a historic night Alexandria Kosair Cortes taking down Joe Crowley the fourth most powerful Democrat in the House we were discussing it just a little while ago as we did this live that it was among the four or five most stunning upsets in in our lifetime and and Michael and I have covered a lot of politics between us and and just a gigantic earthquake of a victory for progressives Alexandria will be the youngest female ever elected to Congress she was among the first batch of Justice Democrat candidates so she basically was part of the people who began that movement she was on the show earlier and said that just Democrats and brand new Congress convinced her to run she didn't have that idea in the first place I told you they were good at picking candidates so we stayed true and and we brought that gigantic historic victory at home Alexandria was an amazing candidate she worked for a year and a half straight knocking on doors and we thought that might make a difference and it turns out it did for all of you who helped and there's a lot in our audience who did thank you you made that happen Ben Jealous governor of Maryland I'm sorry the Democratic nominee I don't wanna get too ahead of myself and he will be running against the popular Republican Hogan in in Maryland but it was a huge contest between the Bernie Sanders progressive wing which Ben Jealous is a part of and more establishment wing there and Ben Jealous won convincingly so another big big win for progressives overall just Democratic candidates went three and six but boy the two that won was uncontested and and had already locked it up in that internal struggle between in the primaries which happens a lot when you see on contessa it's sometimes because there was never race but sometimes because people drop down because the person was doing so well but but two of those victories were enormous as big as any race in the prime Aries so it was a wonderful spectacular night for progressives many other victories for our revolution and working families party and so many and move on and democracy for America so many other groups that were involved in these primaries it's a giant win for the progressive movement tonight and one that was unexpected by pretty much everyone else but but you guys saw it from day one you saw Andrea's campaign on The Young Turks from day one and to say we've interviewed er the most is the greatest understatement you could make you think we probably laughed a filled-in in how many times we interviewed her and presented her to you guys and we believed from day one and I think a lot of you did as well and then finally Wolfpack decided they were gonna go after people who defeated their legislation to get money out of politics in Maryland and support the ones who were their champions and they spent a very good amount of money doing that and they won and Antonio Hayes is a champion of the people and to get money out of politics and he will now be a state senator there and we believe that that can be the decisive vote in Maryland to put that state on the board and the next time a Democratic establishment lobbyist whispers in the ear of a candidate they should remember what happened tonight as Wolfpack retired yet another incumbent and now the movement to get money out of politics has become stronger so another giant progressive victory tonight almost as good as we could have hoped and imagined for with Ben Jealous one of the pillars of Bernie Sanders campaigns moving on to the general election and one of the most stunning upset victories literally of our lifetimes with Alexandria crosshair Cortez beating Joe Crowley so for all you progressives out there you will write the belief
