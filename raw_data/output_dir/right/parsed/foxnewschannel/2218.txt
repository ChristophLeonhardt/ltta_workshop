WHAT YOU SEE A QUESTION MARK >>
THAT HE HAS LIVED IN D.C. TOO
LONG.
>> Martha: CONGRESSMAN
JENKINS, YOU WERE A DEMOCRAT,
AND THEN YOU WERE A REPUBLICAN
AND THEN A DEMOCRAT AGAIN, AND
THEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO YOU
BECAME A REPUBLICAN AGAIN, SO
HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE COME TONIGHT AND THE
OTHER REPUBLICANS IN
WEST VIRGINIA THAT IF THERE IS A
BLUE WAVE, NOVEMBER AND THE TIDE
TURNS AGAIN THAT YOU WILL NOT
FLIP AGAIN?
>> I AM A PROUD REPUBLICAN AND A
PROUD WEST VIRGINIAN.
I PUT MY WEST VIRGINIA VALUES
FIRST.
BARACK OBAMA DEVASTATED OUR
STATE AND OUR COUNTRY PRAYED HE
PUT LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF COAL
MINERS OUT OF WORK.
LOOK AT THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
THAT SUPPORTS ABORTION ON
DEMAND, GUN GRABBERS LIMITING
THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
THE WEST VIRGINIA STORY IS THAT
WE ARE A PROUD RED STATE.
LOOK IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY
DONALD TRUMP WON WEST VIRGINIA
BY 77 POINTS.
HE WON THE GENERAL OF 44 POINTS.
DONALD TRUMP WAS A DEMOCRAT.
RONALD REAGAN WAS A DEMOCRAT.
IT IS A PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THEIR
VALUES AND PUT THEIR VALUES
FIRST RATHER THAN THEIR PARTY
REGISTRATION.
I SIMPLY COULD NOT BE A PART OF
A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT WAS SO
WRONG FOR WEST VIRGINIA, SO
WRONG FOR WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE
BELIEVE.
I WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR OUR
STATE.
I WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR OUR
VALUES.
SO STANDING UP WITH THIS
PRESIDENT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE,
THAT IS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL
ALWAYS DO.
>> Martha: WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO THE CHARGE THAT YOU ARE TOO
SIMILAR AND JUST ANOTHER JOE
MANCHIN WITH A LITTLE LESS
EXPERIENCE?
>> I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO
FACE JOE MANCHIN IN THE NOVEMBER
PRIMARY.
I VOTED TO CUT THE TAXES AND PUT
MORE MONEY IN PEOPLE’S POCKETS.
JOE MANCHIN VOTED "NO."
I VOTED TO DEFUND PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, JOE MANCHIN VOTED TO
FUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
I VOTED TO REDUCE THE
REGULATIONS BRINGING THE
WEST VIRGINIA JOBS BACK.
JOE MANCHIN IS ON THE
CHUCK SCHUMER TEAM.
HE IS SITTING THERE WITH
ELIZABETH WARREN,
BERNIE SANDERS, HE HAS A 70%,
80% VOTING RECORD WITH THEM.
I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO
TAKE ON JOE MANCHIN THIS
NOVEMBER AND REPLACE HIM AND
BRING A MUCH-NEEDED REPUBLICAN
VOTE TO THE UNITED STATES
SENATE.
>> Bret: MR. MORRISEY, YOU ARE
RUNNING AS AN INSURGENT
REPUBLICAN, A POLITICAL
OUTSIDER.
BUT YOU WORKED ON CAPITOL HILL.
AND AS A BIG-MONEY LOBBYIST IN
D.C., SO HOW ARE YOU NOT A
CREATURE OF THE SWAMP?
>> I THINK IT IS VERY CLEAR OF
ALL OF THE CANDIDATES ON THE
STAGE, I AM ACTUALLY THE ONLY
ONE WITH A CONSERVATIVE RECORD
OF RESULTS.
AND WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE HERE ON
THE STAGE EITHER ABANDON THE
STATE OR THEY WERE ON THE
BARACK OBAMA TEAM, I WAS
LITERALLY BY MYSELF SUING
BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE HE
THREATENED OUR WAY OF LIFE HERE
IN WEST VIRGINIA.
HE CAME AFTER OUR COAL JOBS.
I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO STAND UP.
I FOUGHT AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.
WE TOOK HIM ALL THE WAY UP TO
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AND BEAT
HIM 5-4, THAT WAS NOT AN EASY
THING TO DO.
WE BUILT A 27 STATE COALITION TO
DO THAT.
WE WENT AFTER OBAMA’S ILLEGAL
AMNESTY.
THESE GUYS WERE IN ACTIVE IN ALL
OF THESE FIGHTS WHEN
WEST VIRGINIA NEEDED A PROVEN
CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER TO CHANGE
THE ABORTION LAWS IN OUR STATE.
NEITHER OF THESE GUYS WERE
AROUND.
THEY WOULD NOT WEIGH IN AT THE
TIME.
I STOOD UP AND NOW WE HAVE A
PAIN CAPABLE LAW PROTECTING THE
UNBORN.
THAT IS WHY WEST VIRGINIA FOR
LIFE HAS ENDORSED MY CANDIDACY.
THAT IS WHY THE CONSERVATIVES
HAVE GOTTEN BEHIND ME.
THEY KNOW THAT WE HAVE A STRONG
CONSERVATIVE RECORD.
AND WE HAVE GONE AFTER
WASHINGTON A LOT HARDER THAN
THESE GUYS EVER COULD.
YOU HAVE TO PUT LARGE
CONSERVATIVE COALITION TOGETHER,
THAT IS WHAT HOW YOU HAVE DONE.
THESE COALITIONS WOULD LOOK LIKE
HILLARY AND NANCY PELOSI AND
THAT IS NOT THE CHANGE THAT WE
NEED.
>> Bret: THANK YOU,
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL.
>> Martha: THE OPIOID ACADEMIC
HAS HIT THE COUNTRY HARD,
NOWHERE ORDER THEN
WEST VIRGINIA.
HERE IS RICK LEVENTHAL.
>> POLICE.
>> IT IS HARD TO FIND ANYONE WHO
HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED IN SOME WAY
BY THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.
KILLING MORE AMERICANS IN CAR
CRASHES AND GUNS.
>> IN 2016 THE GOVERNMENT
STATISTICS SHOW -- HE DIED FROM
DRUG OVERDOSES.
MORE THAN 42,000 OF THEM FROM
OPIOIDS.
BY COMPARISON 37,000 DIED IN CAR
CRASHES, 38,000 IN GUNSHOTS.
WEST VIRGINIA IS AN UNFORTUNATE
LEADER IN THE OPIOID CRISIS WITH
THE HIGHEST DRUG OVERDOSE RATE
IN THE NATION.
52 DEATHS FOR EVERY 100,000
RESIDENTS.
LEADING THE NEXT EIGHT BY 20%,
DOUBLING THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
LAST DECEMBER THE GOVERNOR
CALLED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR
LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TRYING TO
HELP TACKLE THE EPIDEMIC.
LAST YEAR WAS THE STATES WORST
WITH NEARLY 1,000 DYING FROM
OPIOID ODs, THE 84 LIVES LOST
IN 2016.
PART OF A STEADY RISE OF
FATALITIES AND WEST VIRGINIA
SINCE THE START OF THE CENTURY.
ONE REASON FOR WEST VIRGINIA’S
ISSUES IS THE EASY AVAILABILITY
OF THE PILLS.
BETWEEN 2007-2012, SHIPPING
HYDROCODONE AND OXYCODONE PILLS
INTO THE STATE WHICH ECONOMISTS
ESTIMATE COST WEST VIRGINIA
NEARLY $1 BILLION IN LOST
PRODUCTIVITY AND RESOURCES TO
ADDRESS THE ISSUE.
>> Martha: CONGRESSMAN
JENKINS, REPRESENTING
WEST VIRGINIA FOR 24 YEARS,
SMALL TOWNS BOTH IN YOUR
DISTRICT HAVE BEEN FLOODED WITH
ENOUGH HYDROCODONE AND OXYCODONE
TO SUPPLY THOUSANDS OF PILLS TO
EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD.
SO WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT
YOU DESERVE A PROMOTION WHEN THE
DISTRICT THAT YOU REPRESENT IS
GROUND ZERO FOR THE OPIOID
CRISIS?
>> WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A REAL
DIFFERENCE.
WE ARE SEEING PROGRESS.
WE HAVE HERE TWO LADIES THAT
CALLED ME FIVE YEARS AGO, SARAH
AND RHONDA, TWO NURSES THAT SAW
THE PRECIOUS NEWBORN BABIES THAT
HAVE BEEN DRUG EXPOSED DURING
PREGNANCY AND THROUGH THE LABOR
OF LOVE, RHONDA, SARAH, ME AND
SOME OTHERS STARTED LILLY’S
PLACE, A FACILITY THAT MELANIA
TRUMP VISITED GIVING EVERY CHILD
A START IN LIFE.
AND I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THE
FLOOD OF OPIOIDS, PATRICK
MORRISEY AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
CARDINAL HEALTH, NOT OUR STATE
TO BIRD, IT IS THE PUSHER OF ALL
OF THESE PILLS.
HE AND HIS FAMILY LOBBYING FIRM
HAVE MADE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
IN HIS 18 YEARS AS A D.C.
LOBBYIST AND HILL STAFFORD.
THEY HAVE FLOODED OUR STATE WITH
THESE PAIN PILLS THAT HAVE
DEVASTATED PEOPLE IN
WEST VIRGINIA.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE
PROBLEM IS, IT IS THE PILL
PUSHERS AND PATRICK MORRISEY IS
REPRESENTING THOSE PEOPLE FOR
YEARS AND MADE MILLIONS.
>> Bret: OUR FIRST BELL OF THE
EVENING, BUT MR. MORRISEY.
>> THERE HE GOES YET AGAIN, DID
YOUR MOM EVER TELL YOU THAT WE
SHOULD WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH
SOAP WITH THOSE LIES?
I’LL TELL YOU WHAT, OBVIOUSLY
NOT ONLY PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DID
NOT WORK ON THOSE ISSUES IN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR, BUT NO ONE HAS
DONE MORE TO GO AFTER THE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC, SUING, GOING AFTER
$78 MILLION IN DAMAGES FROM THE
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES,
RECENTLY WE WENT AFTER THE DEA,
BECAUSE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
AGENCY HAD BEEN BLANKETING THE
STATE, RUBBER-STAMPING THE
APPLICATIONS COMING IN, FLOODING
WEST VIRGINIA WITH PILLS.
WE WENT AFTER IT AND ARE PUTTING
AN END TO THAT.
EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS, AND
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE GOING AFTER
TREATMENT AS WELL.
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS
PEOPLE’S NEEDS IN THEIR HEADS
AND THEIR HEARTS.
I WILL CONCLUDE ON THIS NOTE,
ALL OF US INCLUDING ME AND MY
FAMILY, WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES WITH
ADDICTION.
THERE IS NO ONE HERE TONIGHT
THAT HAS NOT FELT IT.
AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE EVAN
JENKINS TO KEEP THE POLITICAL
DIALOGUE TO SAY THAT THINGS ARE
NOT TRUE TO HIDE HIS DEEP
LIBERAL BACKGROUND IS VERY SAD.
>> Bret: MR. MORRISEY I
UNDERSTAND, BUT AS
ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU DID SEE
WITH THE MAJOR PILL DISTRIBUTOR,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOUR WIFE
WAS LOBBYING FOR THAT PILL
DISTRIBUTOR PERIOD IS THAT NOT A
CONFLICT OF INTEREST?
>> WE HAVE HANDLED EVERYTHING
EXACTLY RIGHT, I THINK MOST
PEOPLE IN THE STATE WOULD SAY
THAT WE HAVE A MORE EFFECTIVE
TAKING ON THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC
THAN ANYONE.
I NOTE WHEN I GOT INTO OFFICE
THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE
FIGHTING UNIT IN THE STATE.
WE HAVE TURNED THINGS AROUND HER
TO THE OTHER POINT, YOU CITED
IT, THE STATISTICS FROM
2007-2012, LOOK, JOE MANCHIN WAS
ON THE WATCH AS GOVERNOR.
HE WAS SLEEPING AT THE SWITCH
WHEN PILLS WERE FLOODING INTO
OUR STATE AND IT TOOK ME AND THE
AG OFFICE TO GO AFTER THAT
AGGRESSIVELY.
>> WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE,
CARDINAL HEALTH PAID FOR HIS
PARTY.
THEY WERE SO HAPPY THAT PATRICK
MORRISEY HAD WON THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL, THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD
A FRIEND.
RETURNING THE MONEY.
>> HE HAS A PAIN PILL PLEDGE.
HE HAS A PAIN PILL PLEDGE, HE
HAS TAKEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS THAT HE WILL NOT RETURN.
SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
HYPOCRISY.
I WISH YOU WOULD STOP.
>> Martha: LET’S GET TO
MR. BLANKENSHIP IN HERE, YOU
TALK TOUGH ON OPIOIDS.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS WHAT
THEY SAID.
>> Martha: I WILL ASK YOU THE
QUESTION.
IN FACT, YOU WANT TO DRUG TEST
EVERYONE FROM LAWMAKERS TO
TEACHERS, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ISSUE?
DO YOU HAVE EMPATHY FOR ADDICTS?
>> I DO NOT THINK EMPATHY WILL
FIX THE PROBLEM.
IF WE STOP THE DRUG ABUSE WE DO
NOT NEED TO HAVE EMPATHY.
WHEN WE SAY THAT PATRICK SAID HE
IS THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE UP
HERE.
I ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT NEITHER
WOULD BE UP HERE WITHOUT ME. ME.
BOTH OF THEM ARE MISLEADING.
PATRICK MORRISEY CAME TO
WEST VIRGINIA IN 2012.
HE’S BEEN HERE SIX YEARS.
DRUG ABUSE DEATHS HAVE GONE UP
63% AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE ON
THE RISE.
THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
ENDORSEMENTS.
MOST OF PATRICK MORRISEY’S
ENDORSEMENTS ARE THE SAME THAT
JOE MANCHIN HAD.
CONSERVATIVES DON’T GO OUT AND
TAKE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND
