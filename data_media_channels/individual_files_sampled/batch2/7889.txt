young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcasts of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio canada is currently suffering from its own issues with right-wing populism Doug Ford the brother of troubled former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has been elected premier of Canada's most populous province mr. Ford center-right Progressive Conservatives wrested control of Ontario from the Liberal Party for the first time since 2003 the Conservatives took 41% of the vote winning 76 of 124 votes of the province according to local media so a couple of interesting things there in Canadian politics things can change quickly that liberal party that had been in control for some time no longer qualifies as a party because of how poorly they did and it was pointed out that the Progressive Conservatives did well but not as well in the popular vote as it ended up being reflected in the number of seats they got which is an experience we can relay so how are you really for that year that's sort of the way it works out a lot of time now let's focus though on Doug Ford mr. Ford's only political experience is a single term on Toronto City Council and his role as an advisor and unofficial spokesman for his brother Rob who you probably remember while Maher confessed the crack cocaine use in public intoxication he later died in 2016 from a rare form of cancer and I want to give you a lot of American voters aren't gonna be that familiar both with Canadian politics as I am not and also with this individual so let's talk about Doug Ford he called his followers the Ford nation and his campaign materials and signs largely emitted any mention of the Progressive Conservative Party in favor of the family brand he once challenged a heckler at a council meeting to meet him on the floor while repeatedly shouting bring it on big guy his campaign canceled the traditional bus for journalists and carefully controlled access to Ford during public events by the way Ford has used this at the term fake news many times he loves that in addition to many of the other slogans that a Donald came up with that we export our best goods our best our best goods and Bad's let's talk a bit about policy mr. Ford is vowed to eliminate Ontario's federally mandated tax on carbon emissions and cut gasoline prices a move that could increase such emissions both of those are gonna make it harder for Trudeau and Canada to continue their battle against that climate change he's also he says that he's going to drastically improve healthcare access in that region he's also at the same time cutting taxes doesn't explain where he's gonna get the money to improve the health care he's also shutting down tons of hospitals and schools and so it seems to be a pattern through all of his policies that he makes these gigantic promises he doesn't use the word strongly but you can sort of hear it in the background without ever explaining how he's gonna do it or how he's gonna pay for it so welcome to the club Canada so what's a dumber campaign promise $1 beer for everyone which is platform or the wall just embrace debate what do you guys think I prefer the $1 beer yeah that's gonna work out yeah but who runs on $1 beer when your brother died and passed away had addiction issues I am shocked that Trump has not already picked this up as his 20/20 campaign issue he's a very pro business though so I mean he doesn't he's gonna look out for the the companies that make the beer he's not gonna well in this particular case what's actually going on is there are minimum price restrictions on certain types of goods I'm assuming to cut down on consumption of it in the same way that raising the price of like a big gulp is intended to stop you from drinking as much of it they theoretically could sell it on you know for almost nothing because there's nothing in it except for sugar but the government's are artificially increasing the price to lower consumption so Ford is kind of like Trump lite I mean he's basically one of his other campaign promises is that Canada is open for business notwithstanding the fact that we are now in a trade war with Canada but under his platform that's what he's saying so all the corporate tax cuts the dialing back of certain environmental protections basically this is just an echo of what the Trump administration is doing it's just happening north and one of the reasons that I think he had the support that he had in the last election is a similar why Trump had the support here which is that in general there are economic problems throughout the world many of them have actually been exported by us some I still believe that we're living in the wake of the financial crisis 10 years ago and that's a continuing problem and people just want to vote for whoever is not there and if the the the people there were more liberal if the people there were more progressive if the people there were more write-in in politics in in their in their various governments administrations they just want to vote for whoever wasn't there you're right and that's what's happening now that's what happened with Trump and that's what's happening throughout the world yeah so no me and I were actually discussing this off air earlier and I think that you're absolutely right about that because you are seeing this rejection of traditional politicians or establishment politicians throughout the world and and it doesn't matter whether they support a populist on the right or the left they just want someone who's extremely different radically different and I think that the more exploitative exploitative politicians are just taking advantage of that you know they see that there's frustration economic frustration a lot of heartache a lot of people who are angry and they capitalize off that anger and you're seeing it throughout the world and I think that the one remedy to that is of course better politicians who actually represent their constituents but but also more importantly better coverage news coverage media journalism people who actually focus on the issues that matter and so the economic issues that really speak to most people throughout the world are the very issues that get ignored how's the housing crisis in America not a sexy topic people don't want to talk about it they don't care and when I say people I'm talking about the people in power people in media who oftentimes are members of the elite who can't afford housing homelessness is through the roof right now and no one really talks about it and so those are the issues that really unify everyone regardless of political identity or affiliation and I really want us to do a better job in talking about those issues you're absolutely right that this is an international issue because you see you know what's happening with marine lepen szura is she narrowly avoided leading france so you see rodrigo duterte in the philippines there are right leaders populist leaders that are getting to the forefront and gaining power but I think that this Canadian issue is specifically aligned with what happened in the United States because Trudeau ran as a progressive but is actually doing a lot of things especially on the environment that are way more regressive than he actually campaigned on similar to a little bit what happened with President Obama who campaigned way more progressive Lee than he actually legislated and then look Donald Trump a right-wing populist came to the forefront and now we're seeing that with Ford a little bit too easy ways for the young turks want us hit the
