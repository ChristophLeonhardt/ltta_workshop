I'm told from time to time by friends on the left and enemies on the right that there's no evidence that the Russians interfered with our elections which is hilarious Mike Pompeo the Trump's CIA chief says oh absolutely and they're looking to do it again in 2018 but now we have direct evidence and then from time to time people say hey you know what you don't know that WikiLeaks got the the DNC emails are the Podesta emails from the Russians well now we do know now look I want to be very clear I don't care who they got it from I think WikiLeaks has every right to publish those emails I think those emails were instructive and and help the American people understand what was going on in one side unfortunately though it was targeted to only one side I would like to know information on both the Democratic and Republican parties but that was not what the rush is intended they wanted to support the right wing in this country that would help them with their priorities especially Donald Trump but let's give you the details here it turns out that two Dutch media companies have uncovered something very interesting coming out of the intelligence agencies of that country so Dutch spies alerted their American counterparts this is really important as early as 2014 about Russian hacking in the State Department and White House computers and subsequent Russian hacking of the Democratic Party in the 2016 election according to a series of reports in Dutch media now that goes to show you that this is not sour just sour grapes from the Democrats now the Democrats have sour grapes have the 2016 election absolutely no question about it and you can have a range of opinions on how much they've hyped up the Russian connection but in terms of when it was happening was happening all the way back in 2014 when most people thought the idea of Donald Trump winning the presidency was not just comical it was nearly impossible so it wasn't a pro-hillary thing it wasn't an anti-trump thing back in 2014 the dutch intelligence had simply monitored the russians and found out what they were doing now why they couldn't talk about it earlier we'll get to in a sec but I want to continue here from alternate the joint investigation by Volks rant newspaper in new vestroia the NewsHour Eckert affairs television program describe how Dutch intelligence experts access the Russian hackers computers and cameras in hallways at a university in Moscow that's really interesting so the Russians are the only ones who could hack and obviously we know that that by the way they're Americans hack into other countries systems as well so let's not pretend that we're innocent here and the Chinese do it etc but in this case the Dutch or spying in on the Russians to see what spying they were doing not only they get into their computers is the amazing part they found out that they were in a in a university building near Red Square and they tapped into the cameras so they literally saw them doing the hacking of the State Department in the Democrats Wow I mean if you thought there was no evidence before it's clearly evidence now it's on tape so the Dutch spies watched a team of Russian hackers infiltrate the State Department the White House and the Democratic Party to pilfer emails and electronic documents including 2016 campaign emails later published by WikiLeaks I want to be clear about a couple of things now it's possible that WikiLeaks got the information from somewhere else it's possible that someone else also had the information but now we know that the Russia's definitely had it now whether they pass it on the WikiLeaks is a different question but I think that it's fairly irrelevant question one because the point is that they steal it or did they not steal it and apparently they did and now we literally have them on tape the second is I don't really care that they pass it on to WikiLeaks I don't think that's what's swung the election nor do I think that that's access to information whether it's the some of the information that Chelsea Manning revealed Snowden revealed or the Pentagon Papers Daniel Ellsberg revealed back in the day I think that overall helps the American people decide I don't think that's the thing that you could undo an election over I think that's preposterous okay but did the Russians do it well they most certainly did so why didn't the Dutch authorities warn us earlier well they did they were among the different allies that came to and said watch out we know the Russians are tapping in to your computers including at the White House so why didn't the Obama administration act because as usual with Democrats they were scared Joe Biden said just last week they were afraid of what Steve Banta would say oh Jesus Christ okay the cowardice of the Democrats sometimes is unparalleled now the reason why we in the public have not heard about this before is because likely the hacking of the Dutch into the Russians was ongoing and now that they've found out all that they can and probably that operation was concluded perhaps the Russians caught them spying in now it could be made public is my best guess as to why we're hearing about it now so let me give you more information in the summer of 2015 Dutch intelligence services we're the first alert their American counterparts about the cyber intrusion of the Democratic National Committee by cozy bear a hacking group believed to be tied to the Russian government by the way also another discredit to the Democratic Party I mean you know back in 2015 because of Dutch intelligence that they were hacking into all the computers yet they were later able to hack into Podesta's emails anyway for God's sake take some precautions and finally over the course of a few months they saw how the Russians penetrated several US institutions looting the State Department the White House and the DNC on all these occasions the Dutch alerted the u.s. intelligence services according to their program news our in in that country so if you thought before that there was no evidence that the Russians had hacked into us well I don't know the Dutch intelligence is ever gonna make the videotapes public I don't know why Judge intelligence would have been lying him out of this entire time - first privately - the American government and now publicly but it appears that they literally have the Russians doing it on tape that's pretty good evidence now what you make of that and what conclusions you draw from that is a different situation and does that mean that the Russians were working with Trump to the best of our knowledge there's no tape of the Russians then calling trumping going okay we got it what would you like us to do with it so that is not part of this story but the Russia's hack in to these systems yes the Phin ative Lee yes you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a
