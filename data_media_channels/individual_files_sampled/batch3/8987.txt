ONGOING AND THEY'LL RESUME AGAIN THIS MORNING. Julie: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Bill: THERE IS A LOT OF REACTION TO THIS. I WANT TO BRING IN DAVID BOSSIE. FORMER DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR THE TRUMP TEAM AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN THE PRESIDENT MADE THE OFFHANDED COMMENT DURING THE IRAN NUCLEAR DECISION YESTERDAY WHEN HE BROKE THE NEWS THAT POMPEO WAS BACK IN NORTH KOREA. AND MY FEELING WAS IF HE DOES NOT COME HOME WITH THESE AMERICANS, THAT IS A WIDE OPEN QUESTION MARK AT THAT POINT. BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TELLS US THAT THE SUMMIT PLAN WITH KIM IS STILL ON TRACK AND THIS IS A MISSION THAT WAS SET IN MOTION SOME TIME AGO AND AT THE MOMENT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WHATEVER COMES AFTER THAT WE'LL SEE AND WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT. BUT THIS IS A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT. IT IS AWESOME NEWS FOR THESE THREE AMERICANS. AND IT SHOWS US THAT THE TRACK AND THE PATH IS STILL SET, DAVID. THAT'S MY OBSERVATION. ONE OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS MUST BE THAT PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH WORKS. THAT'S WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS DEVELOPING AS HIS FOREIGN WITH IRAN YESTERDAY, WHETHER IT'S DEALING WITH UPCOMING SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA. THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE DECIDED IT SEEMS WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IT SEEMS THEIR LEADERSHIP HAS DECIDED TO THROUGH THIS GOODWILL GESTURE TO SAY WE'RE READY TRULY TO SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE PENINSULA. IF WE DO THAT, IF THIS PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT, IT IS A TREMENDOUS VICTORY NOT JUST FOR THE UNITED STATES BUT FOR THE WORLD. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON. WORKING NIGHT AND DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AS AMERICANS ARE PROTECTED AT HOME AND ABROAD. I THINK THIS JUST PROVES THAT HE IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY AND DOESN'T LET ALL THE OTHER STUFF BOTHER HIM. AN AMAZING THING TO SEE AND WATCH. Bill: SOME OF THE POINTS ARE VALID. THE PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF JAMES MATTIS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. I THINK KIM LISTENS TO THAT PRESSURE. WHAT WAS HIS CALCULATION? GOING TO CHANGE THIS KINGDOM THAT IS SO SEALED FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD? THAT'S THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION, BILL. WHAT HAS CHANGED IN KIM'S MIND THAT HAS MADE HIM ALLOWED HIM TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO GO TO SOUTH KOREA, TO VISIT NOW REGULARLY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA TO TALK TO OUR PRESIDENT AND TO MEET NOW A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE KNOW OF NOW SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO. IT IS A WONDERFUL THING FOR AMERICA TO WAKE UP TODAY AND SEE THESE THREE HOSTAGES. TWO OF THEM DIDN'T HAVE A SHAM TRIAL, ONE HAD A SHAM TRIAL. I WANT TO NOT FORGET OTTO WARMBIER. IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER OTTO AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT THIS REGIME HAS BEEN LIKE IN THE PAST. THEIR GOODWILL GESTURE TODAY IS VERY IMPORTANT. Bill: HIS PARENTS ARE NOT LETTING HIS STORY DRIFT TO THE SIDE. AND NO ONE SHOULD. Bill: IT'S A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THE BRUTALITY THAT SO MANY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO INSIDE NORTH KOREA FOR SO LONG. THIS PRESIDENT REMEMBERS THAT. JUST AS REAGAN DID WHEN HE WENT TO MEET WITH GORBACHEV. YOU DON'T FORGET WHAT THE SOVIETS HAVE DONE FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS. IT IS A BIG STEP WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. Bill: I WILL NOT FORGET THAT MOMENT THAT KIM WENT WALKING DOWN THAT SIDEWALK ALONG THE DMZ. THIS IS A YOUNG PERSON FILLED WITH PERSONALITY. AND A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. SO NOW FINAL QUESTION, DAVID. THE SUMMIT HAPPENS FOR DECADES WE THOUGHT TRUST AND VERIFY, TRUST BUT VERIFY. THIS IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE U.S. MAKING SURE THEY STICK TO THEIR WORD AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ACTION. IF THAT PATTERN CONTINUES WE CAN HAVE SUCCESS HERE. IF IT DOESN'T IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION. LAST ANSWER ON THAT. YOU LOOK AT THIS PRESIDENT IF YOU'RE KIM JONG-UN. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS PRESIDENT. HE MAKES PROMISES AND HE KEEPS THEM. SO WHATEVER HE DECIDES TO DO DURING THIS SUMMIT, HE IS GOING TO LIVE UP TO HIS END. THE UNITED STATES WILL LIVE UP TO OUR END. BUT HE IS GOING TO MAKE THE DEMANDS, I THINK, THAT ARE WELL THOUGHT OF AND DEVELOPED, WHICH IS THE DENUCLEARIZATION AND GET RID OF THAT MISSILE PROGRAM. GET RID OF THE DANGEROUS NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT ARE THERE. IF WE COME AWAY WITH THAT, THIS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER A HUGE VICTORY FOR THIS COUNTRY. Bill: THERE WILL BE A SUMMIT BUT NOT A RESOLUTION FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AFTER THAT. I WANT TO CAUTION THE AUDIENCE.
