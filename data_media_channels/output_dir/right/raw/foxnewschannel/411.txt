DUBIOUS TAX SCHEMES AND

LOOKING INTO THE CLAIMS AND THEY

22
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:42,952

PAYING MILLIONS IN DOLLARS.

34
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,915
THE ARTICLE IS EXHAUSTIVE.

35
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,850
SO LET'S LOOK AT SEVERAL OF THE

36
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:15,351
KEY FINDINGS.

37
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,487
FIRST, THAT THE PRESIDENT'S

38
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:18,955
FATHER, THE NEW YORK CITY REAL

39
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:23,793
ESTATE MOGUL FRED TRUMP USED A

00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:27,130
SHAM COMPANY TO FUNNEL TAX-FREE

41
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:27,897
MONEY TO HIS CHILDREN.

42
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:30,133
THE TIMES REPORTS THAT TRUMP

43
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:31,334
MANIPULATED THE VALUE OF THEIR

44
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:32,869
APARTMENT BUILDING CLAIMING THEY

45
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,971
WERE WORTH MILLIONS LESS THAN

46
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:35,472
FAIR VALUE.

47
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:37,574
SO THEY PAID A FRACTION OF THE

48
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,476
TAXES DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT.

49
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:41,911

TRUMP'S OFT REPEATED CLAIM THAT

00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:48,351
HE'S A SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE.

53
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:50,019
>> IT'S NOT BEEN EASY FOR ME.

54
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,621
I STARTED IN BROOKLYN.

55
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,156
ME FATHER GAVE ME A SMALL LOAN

56
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:53,990
OF A MILLION DOLLARS.

57
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:57,260
I CAME TO MANHATTAN AND I HAD TO

58
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,195
PAY HIM BACK AND PAY HIM BACK

59
00:01:59,196 --> 00:01:59,963
WITH INTEREST.

60
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,531
>> Shepard: THE TIMES REPORTS

61
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,532
THAT SMALL MILLION DOLLAR LOAN

62
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,701
FROM HIS DAD WAS MORE THAN $60

63
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:05,034
MILLION.

64
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,036
WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION,

65
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,471
THE PAPER FOUND PRESIDENT TRUMP

66
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:10,673

ADDITIONALLY, "THE NEW YORK

71
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:18,815
WAS BUT A TODDLER, HE WAS

72
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:21,251
ALREADY MAKING $200,000 A YEAR.

73
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:22,586
IT REVEALS THAT PRESIDENT

74
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:24,454
TRUMP'S FATHER CAME TO THE

75
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,323
RESCUE SEVERAL TIMES TO SAVE HIS

76
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,691
SON'S FAILING BUSINESSES.

77
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:29,559

POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL LOANS TO

79
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,829
KEEP THEM AFLOAT.

80
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,432
IN ONE EXAMPLE, THE TIMES

81
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,834
REPORTS THAT THE ELDER TRUMP

82
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:41,304
SENT A TRUSTED BOOKKEEPER TO BUY

83
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:42,539
$3.5 MILLION IN CHIPS IN HIS

84
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,175
SON'S CASINOS WHEN IT WAS GOING

85
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:47,377
UNDER OR DEFAULTING ON A LOAN

86
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,713
PAYMENT IN 1990 AND NEVER PLAYED

87
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:50,680
THE CHIPS.

88
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,015
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CALLING THE

HIT PIECE AND HERE'S WHAT THE

91
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:58,121
WHITE HOUSE HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT

92
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:58,622
TODAY.

93
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,590
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS

INACCURATE ABOUT THAT STORY, IF

ACTUALLY INACCURATE ABOUT IT?

97
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,330
>> TOTALLY FALSE ATTACK BASED ON

00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,266
AN OLD RECYCLED NEWS STORY.

99
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,201

100
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,470

EVASION ARE 100% FALSE AND

105
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:21,245
HIGHLY DEFAMATORY.

HOW DID THIS START?

122
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,256
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IT STARTED

123
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:08,059
WITH A COUPLE DOCUMENTS ON A

124
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,161

>> MY COLLEAGUE, SUE CRAIG WENT

126
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:14,766
TO HER DESK.

127
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:15,733
THERE WAS AN ENVELOPE.

128
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,035
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PAGES

129
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:21,038
FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 1995 TAX

130
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:21,372
RETURN.

131
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,573
WE REPORTED ON THOSE DOCUMENTS

132
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:27,078
IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION.

133
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,614
BUT IT WAS INFORMATION THAT WAS

134
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,416
KIND OF STUNNING TO US THAT

135
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,617
WITHIN THOSE DOCUMENTS, WHICH

136
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:35,853
WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT IN 1995

137
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,290
SHOWED THAT HE HAD LOST OVER

138
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,525
$900 MILLION.

139
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,126
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT

140
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:43,728
MADE US REALIZE.

141
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,796
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

142
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:48,066
THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW

143
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,535

OF US DECIDING, LET'S DIG

148
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:00,478
DEEPER.

YEARS OLD AND MOVING FORWARD HAD

HE DIDN'T PAY HIM TO BE LIKE ON

HIS PAYROLL, BUT HE PAID HIM TO

188
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,801
DISCOVERED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD

189
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,836
HIRED LAWYERS TO REWRITE A

190
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,139
PORTION OF HIS WILL IN A WAY

191
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,075
THAT FRED TRUMP PERCEIVED COULD

192
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:39,544
PUT HIS ENTIRE EMPIRE AT RISK.

193
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:41,913
IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN DONALD TRUMP

194
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:44,516
SO MUCH CONTROL OVER THE EMPIRE

195
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,317
THAT FRED TRUMP BELIEVED IT

196
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:48,320
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO USE

197
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,090
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD BUILT FOR

198
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,325
70 YEARS TO BAIL OUT TRUMP'S OWN

199
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:54,660
FAILING BUSINESSES.

200
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,928
AT THAT POINT IN TIME, DONALD

201
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:58,097
TRUMP WAS IN BIG TROUBLE IN THE

202
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:00,266
CASINO INDUSTRY.

203
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,701
>> Shepard: THE TOTALITY OF THE

204
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,036
REPORT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, DONALD

205
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:06,539
TRUMP CITIZEN, WAS NOT AT ALL A

206
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,140
GREAT BUSINESS MAN, THAT HE

207
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,542
SQUANDERED MANY MILLIONS AND

208
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,277
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.

209
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,279
THAT HIS FATHER BAILED HIM OUT

210
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,381
AND THE NECESSARY TAXES WERE

211
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,716
NEVER PAID BECAUSE THEY FIDDLED

212
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:18,984
WITH THE NUMBERS.

213
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,520
>> AT ONE POINT, DONALD TRUMP

214
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,989
OWED HIS DAD $15 MILLION.

215
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,157
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

216
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,626
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS?

217
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,696
IF FRED TRUMP HAD SET, OKAY,

218
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,932
THAT DEBT IS FORGIVEN, DONALD

219
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:35,100
TRUMP WOULD HAVE OWED INCOME

220
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,102
TAXES ON CANCELLED DEBT.

221
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,939
INSTEAD, THEY FOUND THIS OTHER

222
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,073
MANEUVER, INVOLVED ONE OF

223
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:43,175
TRUMP'S BUILDINGS, TRUMP PALACE.

224
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:46,111
WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY EXCHANGED

225
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:48,180
THE DEBT THAT DONALD TRUMP OWED

226
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:50,316
HIS FATHER AND INSTEAD DONALD

227
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,051
TRUMP GAVE HIS DAD A PORTION OF

228
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:54,486
THE BUILDING, A FEW YEARS LATER,

229
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,222
FRED TRUMP SOLD THE PORTION BACK

230
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:59,425
TO DONALD, BUT THIS TIME FOR

231
00:07:59,426 --> 00:07:59,758
$10,000.

232
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,528
IT'S EFFECTIVELY A $15 MILLION

233
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,397
GIFT IS WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO

234
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,800
WHEN YOU DID THE MATH.

235
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,402
>> Shepard: A GIFT WHICH NOBODY

236
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:11,103
PAID TAXES.

237
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:12,605
>> NOBODY PAID TAXES AND

238
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:13,506
UNREPORTED.

239
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:16,575
THIS PATTERN OVER AND OVER AGAIN

240
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,310
WHEN DONALD TRUMP GOT HIMSELF IN

241
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,679
TROUBLE OR WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS

242
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,114
TAKING ON SOME BIG NEW PROJECT.

243
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,216
WE CAN SEE IN THE TAX RETURNS

244
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,652
AND THE BANKING RECORDS THAT WE

245
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,020
OBTAINED THAT FRED TRUMP'S

246
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,690
FINANCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE

247
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:33,159
SIGNIFICANTLY AS THIS KIND OF

248
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,196
SAFETY NET UNDERNEATH TRUMP.

249
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:39,499
>> Shepard: HOW DID THE TIMES

250
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,467
FIND THIS AND THE IRS NEVER

251
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:41,867
FLAGGED IT?

252
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,337
>> I THINK IN PART IT HAS TO DO

253
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:47,173
WITH THE WAY THE IRS LOOKS AT

254
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:47,740
TAX RETURNS.

255
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,208
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR

256
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:49,509
YEAR.

257
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,310
THEY'RE LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR

258
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,211
YEAR'S TRANSACTIONS.

259
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,913
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS A

260
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:56,883
MUCH BROADER PERIOD OF TIME.

261
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,019
WE ALSO WERE RECOGNIZING IN THE

262
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,822
REPORTING THAT WE'RE DOING AND

263
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,824
THE SOURCES WE'RE TALKING TO,

264
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,492
THE TRUMPS WERE PLAYING A LONG

265
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:06,792
GAME.

266
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:09,362
THEY HAD A WELL-THOUGHT OUT

267
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,598
STRATEGY OF HOW TO AVOID OR IN

268
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,701
SOME CASES EVADE HOW MUCH

269
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,571
AMOUNTS OF GIFT AND INHERITANCE

270
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:18,871
TAXES.

271
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,641
WHEN THE IRS WOULD LOOK AT IT,

272
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,743
THEY WOULD SAY YOU OWE US A

273
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:24,677
COUPLE MILLION MORE.

274
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:29,182
THE TRUMPS WOULD SAY GREAT,

275
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:29,715
THAT'S FINE.

276
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:30,783
BY PAYING A FULL MILLION MORE

277
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,618
HERE AND THERE, THEY GOT AWAY

278
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:35,822
WITH NOT PAYING HUNDREDS OF

279
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:40,159
MILLIONS ON THE REAL ESTATE

280
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,161
ASSETS THAT FRED TRUMP WAS

281
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:42,895
TRANSFERRING TO HIS KIDS.

282
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,063
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT SAYS

283
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:47,100
THIS IS AN OLD TIRED BORING

284
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,400
STORY.

285
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,201
HIS LAWYERS SAY THERE'S NOTHING

286
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:48,868
TO IT.

287
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:54,374
IT'S A HIT PIECE BY THE "FAILING

288
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,675
"NEW YORK TIMES."

289
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:58,578
>> SO YOU CAN SEARCH EVERY STORY

290
00:09:58,579 --> 00:09:59,779
EVER WRITTEN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP

291
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,180
AND EVERY BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT

292
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:03,683
DONALD TRUMP AND EVERY TV

293
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,151
INTERVIEW DONE BY DONALD TRUMP.

294
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,520
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ANY MENTION

295
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:09,222
ANYWHERE IN ANY OF THOSE THINGS

296
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:11,925
OF A LITTLE COMPANY CALLED ALL

297
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:12,825
COUNTY BUILDING SUPPLY AND

298
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:13,226
MAINTENANCE.

299
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:16,262
THIS IS THE COMPANY THAT THE

300
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,631
TRUMPS SET UP FOR THE PURPOSE OF

301
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,934
SYPHONING CASH OUT OF FRED

302
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:23,002
TRUMP'S EMPIRE WITHOUT PAYING

303
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,504
GIFT OR ESTATE TAXES.

304
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,372
SO THIS IS NOT ANNALD STORY.

305
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:29,976
THIS IS A VERY NEW STORY.

306
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,778
>> Shepard: AND THE REACTION

307
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,581
FROM THOSE IN NEW YORK STATE

308
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,583
HAVE SUGGESTED AN INVESTIGATION

309
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:37,817
MAY BEGIN.

310
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:39,352
GOT ANY NEW TAX DOCUMENTS?

311
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:42,655
THE WHOLE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR

312
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:45,425
THEM.

313
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,060
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THIS STORY

314
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:50,263
TAUGHT ME AT LEAST, THE END

315
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:53,967
OF -- IN THE REPORTING FOR THE

316
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:58,505
STORY, WE PUT OUR HANDS ON ABOUT

317
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:00,740
200 TAX RETURNS FROM INSIDE THE

318
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,675
TRUMP FAMILY EMPIRE.

319
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,310
THERE'S MORE TAX RETURNS TO BE

320
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:04,878
GOTTEN.

321
00:11:04,879 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'LL BE LOOKING.
