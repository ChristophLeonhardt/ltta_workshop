I'm murdered.

Savannah Bowens is a black trans woman living

crisis.

25

Since 2015, at least 85 trans women have been
murdered across the country -- most of them

black trans women and gender non-conforming

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,140
The way cops are investigating these crimes...could
be delaying justice.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,780
Transgender people are more likely to face
violence and discrimination than the average

U.S. resident.

39
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,869
One of the reasons they’re often at risk
is their IDs - a simple document that many

40
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,160
might take for granted.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,420
When the gender marker on state-issued ID
doesn’t match the outward appearance of

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,220
a transgender person, it opens up a world
of harassment, and sometimes violence.

You know this could be the best job ever.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,090
And then now all of a sudden they see my gender
marker and now they're treating me differently.

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,810
They can be afraid to show their IDs while
driving, at a bar, or to vote, for fear of

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,800
someone finding out that they’re transgender.

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,740
Savannah: The scary part is for me, being
stopped by the police.

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,150
You just never know who's stopping you.

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,400

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,520

Singing: “You are everything to me.”

55

According to a 2015 survey of transgender
people, nearly a third of people with mismatched

56

IDs reported being harassed, denied services
or attacked.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,980
They can also lose access to medical care,
become homeless, or be forced into sex work.

58
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,900
Savannah: A lot of times our trans women they're
resorting to things such as prostitution because

59
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:36,210
society has made it so hard.

60
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:43,470
Every girl may not be as feminine or look
passable as we love to say in our community.

61
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,690
What do you do when you're hungry?

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,440
What do you do when your rent is due and your
lights are about to be cut off, but you can't

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,970
get work because you don't fit into the norm.

64
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,970
Because your friends?

65
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,150
They're in the same situation as you and your
family wants nothing to do with you.

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,670
So you walk the streets in unsafe environments
just so that you can feed yourself.

67
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,459
The discrimination trans people face in life
can continue after they die.

68
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,629
In Jacksonville, during murder investigations,
the police often identified victims by names

69
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,608
they no longer used, instead of their preferred
names.

70
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,899
In the trans community -- whether this happens
in life or death -- it’s called deadnaming.

71
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,789
The police have also systematically denied
the victim’s identities by incorrectly describing

72
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:28,789
their gender.

73
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:32,669
Savannah: If they were known as a woman and
that's who they lived their life as, they're

74
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,240
refusing to do that.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,589
In addition to the disrespect - deadnaming
can slow down a murder investigation in its

76
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,199
most critical hours.

77
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,050
Savannah: You don't get to choose what gender
I am.

78
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,820
Those people that knew me in the streets or
wherever, they knew me as a woman.

79
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,830
So you're saying, oh a man.

80
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,199
You're misnaming me and giving my biological
name, how do you expect to solve a case, if

81
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,199
nobody knows that.

82
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,270
What if I was murdered in a hotel and people
saw a woman go in and then you're saying a

83
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,469
man, that's not what they saw.

84
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,319
That's not that's not who they are.

85
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,499
This is part of a national pattern.

86
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:13,289
ProPublica contacted all law enforcement agencies
in locations where trans people have been

87
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,809
killed since 2015, and found that 87 percent
of victims were deadnamed or misgendered by

88
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:20,930
authorities.

89
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,370
Many police departments cite an internal policy
to go with the name and sex listed on a victim’s

90
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,370
state ID.

91
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,490
Savannah: I need my gender marker to reflect
what it is.

92
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,940
So that I can be respected.

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,839
I feel like it's a prison.

94
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,569
It’s a prison and I have a release date.

95
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,659
But I have no keys to get out of my cell.

96
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,819
Savannah has recently started the process
of legally changing the gender marker on her

97
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:47,819
ID.

98
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,789
But turns out, switching that tiny “M”
or “F” can be incredibly hard.

99
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,649
There are no federal policies to address gender
marker changes on documents like driver’s

100
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,649
licenses.

101
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,810
So it’s left up to the states.

102
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,590
Some are generally more trans-friendly than
others.

103
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,309
While others require a court order, an amended
birth certificate, or proof of surgery.

104
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:14,819
Trystlynn Barber: The laws are so convoluted
across the United States, state to state.

105
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,429
And it does not make any sense.

106
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:19,569
Supposed to be united right?

107
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,129
Trystlynn Barber lives in Georgia and has
been in the process of changing her ID.

108
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,210
But it’s not been easy.

109
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,900
Georgia law requires proof of gender reassignment
surgery, which is a high barrier for most

110
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
people.

111
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,249
Trystlynn: The cost of gender reassignment
surgery at the low end that I've seen in research

112
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,999
in the United States is 15,000 dollars.

113
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,460
The problem is getting health coverage to
cover something like that.

114
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:54,780
To be hit with a solid wall of not being able
to move forward is heartbreaking.

115
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,589
It can destroy people.

116
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,729
But she later remembered a crucial detail.

117
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,279
Trystlynn: I wasn't born here.

118
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,650
I was born in New York.

119
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,719
The State of New York, with a less restrictive
policy, required only a doctor's note stating

120
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,990
she was transitioning.

121
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,719
They sent her a corrected birth certificate
within a month - which she’s used to update

122
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
most of her documents.

123
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,219
Trystlynn: There it is.

124
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,210
That's a certified copy grey seal.

125
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,729
With my name.

126
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,089
My changed name and my correct sex.

127
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,270
And I was half way back from the mailbox.

128
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,270
When I open this up.

129
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,259
I had other mail in my hands, everything else
fell from my hands I fell to my knees.

130
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,140
I started crying, in the middle of the grass
right out here.

131
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,700
I’m sorry.

132
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,540
After thinking that I was not going to be
able to ever get it done.

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,700
Was the most amazing feeling.

134
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,979
As for Savannah...she’s working with a lawyer
in Jacksonville to get her ID changed.

136
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,249
Savannah: When that day comes for me when

137
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:35,259
my gender marker is changed, it will be like
the missing piece to my puzzle.

138
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,698
It's that important.

139
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:41,348
She hopes it will keep her a little bit safer...but
knows this problem is bigger than a letter

140
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,400
on her ID.

141
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,550
After we saw her, another trans woman was
murdered in Florida, this time a few hours

142
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,720
south of Jacksonville.

143
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,080
The Sheriff's Office described the victim
as a man “wearing a wig” and “dressed

144
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,879
as a female.”

145
00:08:56,879 --> 00:00:00,000
Another case of deadnaming… and a murder
that’s yet to be solved.
