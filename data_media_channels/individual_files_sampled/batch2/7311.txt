mallory hagan joins us hey Mallory how you doing hey NRA are you great you're running in Alabama's third District for United States Congress I am Alabama's deeply read their district three US Congress love it you're a former Miss America from 2013 I am yeah so Malorie there's a stereotype of Miss America's of yoona get asked awkward question and then you could give an awkward answer etc generally not you particularly obviously so you are not like that you are very much engaged and have been throughout and and hence this run so but but I wanted to just dive into that a little bit more what made you get into politics so much that you're actually running for Congress well I think Miss America was really my first toe dip into politics the Miss America Organization requires that every young woman have a platform so from the time I was a teenager when I started competing and I was an advocate for arts education all the way until I won Miss America which was 11 years later I've been an advocate in my community for something but having been Miss America and using that year to be a champion for child sexual abuse prevention for working with organizations like prevent child abuse America and safe horizon and the National Children's Alliance I realized that I could be a part of a team that really created change and so during my years Miss America I lobbied Capitol Hill for federal funding for our 2014 budget for our child advocacy centers and that's what our kids go and they're victims of crime and since then I've known that my voice really counts and then it matters and so I've continued that type of work over the last five years with this last year I know you guys covered it a little bit Miss America Organization found itself in turmoil and I very publicly stood up to say I'm Haskell who was the CEO and the board of directors and I think that really pushed a group of people in my hometown in Lee County I'm from Auburn Alabama or eagle and in my home town of Auburn in Opelika they pushed me to run for office and looking at the numbers there are four women under 40 in Congress and so ultimately I said yes it's been the best decision that I've ever made and I feel really good about it yet so talk to us about the experience a little bit why is it the best decision and you know what have you picked up from the a process and and what you've gone through well it's been the best decision because first and foremost it's made me fall in love with my state all over again Alabama is a beautiful place it's diverse from a geographic standpoint its diverse from people and just being able to interact with people all up and down Alabama's third district and get to know the hard-working people that live here and how much they desire to see change is really just what's wonderful but it's also been great because doug jones really started a wave here in alabama you know there really wasn't a democratic party at all until doug jones election back in december and since then we have seen democratic parties engage in every county and we've seen college students get involved and i just really feel like this is a time for alabama to to really shine in the national spotlight and i think we have a chance to do that here in the third district so mallory i saw a quote from you that I thought was powerful along the lines what you're just discussing unfortunately alabama is bottom 5 in education in health care government transparency and quality of life and it's been ruled by Republicans for a decade after decade so is there any recognition in in Alabama these days like hey maybe this isn't working for someone else yeah I think that there is and specifically in the third district we've had congressman Mike Rogers here for 16 years and before that he was a part of our state legislature and so a lot of people feel as though he's a do-nothing congressman and they're ready to see change and they're ready to have a representative who's willing to listen who's not afraid of town halls who's not afraid to debate which we have seen across the country in this election cycle so there are plenty of people on both sides of the aisle who are ready for change who are actively seeking change and I think that that's that's really important in this midterm yeah I just wonder you know there's often a discussion about how red state voters vote against their own interests and in and they need health care more than others and they need to improve education etc they ranked near the bottom Alabama Mississippi etc and almost all the rankings but it seems like in my lifetime yeah but pro-choice pro-life and we're done with it let's just live in misery because of these cultural issues our young people getting past that it at this point is there any real sea change or unfortunately are the cultural issues still dominant there I think that the cultural issues are always gonna be here and there's something that we're gonna have to overcome but people are very concerned about their health care we have rural hospitals closing all across our districts we just had one close in our congressman's essentially his hometown and so people are having to drive 30 45 minutes to receive medical assistance in the case of an emergency and that hits home you know people are really concerned about their ability to access health care and young people are getting involved we have 11 college campuses throughout our district we've got two HBCUs Tuskegee University and Talladega college along with Auburn University and our young people are eager to see change and I think that we've seen that throughout this year with the kids from parkland and March for our lives and I'm just really excited to see young people understand that voting really does matter their voice does matter their vote matters and they've they've been really engaged in our campaign and I'm very grateful for it so Mike Rogers is he his own man an independent thinker or does he vote with Donald Trump almost every time Mike Rogers pretty pretty solidly votes at Donald Trump and has even said in the past if that's his goal unfortunately congressman Rogers likes to talk about things like space force meanwhile like I said we have hospitals closing Alabama has the highest infant mortality rate across the country it's worse than Sri Lanka like we are worse than third-world countries and our congressman is touting spaceforce and it just came out recently that he's next in line to potentially become the Secretary of the Air Force so I'm not even sure if he wants this job to be quite honest so so yeah yeah Malorie I think you've got a solution for him he doesn't want the job you'll take it I tell you what I announced on February 6 and I haven't stopped running since then and for the longest time he was very dismissive of me he said I'm just a 29 year old girl I'm just a former Miss America I need him to be on television etc etc and I think I've proven all of those things wrong and the next thing to prove wrong is as him on November 6th well I remember a similar argument made against just the 28 year old telegenic girl in New York her name was right across the cortex that that didn't prove to be persuasive to the voters okay so let's talk about where I think the harder the corruption is which is in the campaign donations so you are not taking any corporate money so that's a excellent sign that your uncorrupted how about Mike Rogers does he take a lot of corporate PAC money and big donor money of course so I'm proud to be endorsed by n Citizens United over 90% of my campaign contributions come from people over 60% of Mike Rogers campaign contributions come from corporate PACs and much of that is defense money and a lot of people may not realize that he sits on the Armed Services Committee so his campaign directly benefits from the decisions that he makes while sitting on that committee and that is just a microcosm of what's wrong with our government as a whole and so I think that this election cycle not only for me and not only for us here in Alabama but across the country it's really important for people to be looking at their representatives where does their money come from who are they beholdin to you know Mike Rogers will not appear in public he will not host a town hall and when he does it's at two o'clock on a Tuesday and it's ticketed and so that tells me he doesn't know who he works for that tells me he doesn't respect his constituents enough to answer their questions or to hear their concerns he doesn't see them as valid people in this process and that's just wrong so I'm proud to be endorsed by n Citizens United and I really hope that people will be paying attention to that during this election yeah and so we're almost out of town but I want people to understand the circle of corruption so he sits on the Armed Services Committee he gets more money from defense contractors he votes for war after war than if he goes and becomes US the head of the Air Force in in essence there he'll get to authorize even more Wars and more spending on defense contractors and my guess having never served yeah never served right and and then once he retires I can almost guarantee you that he will get a job with a defense contractor and and close the circle completely of corruption which doesn't help the state of Alabama or that district at all but it helps Mike Rogers a lot and it helps defense contractors a lot so Hagan for house.com is a website and as you just heard Mallory's running uncorrupted so small dollar donations make a big big difference and so do volunteers so Hagan for house comm make sure you check it out mallory hagan thank you so much for joining us really appreciate it thank
