would like to see we're going on a date
but we're not we're gonna shopping date
kind of yeah we're going car shopping so
we're gonna go we need a second vehicle
like desperately especially with my
parents move you know and us moving and
stuff and Nick commuting like we
definitely need another car commutes 200
kilometres a day yeah so we need another
car so we're going car shopping that's
two farmers a day would be 120 miles a
day
oh if you're American
Kengo so yeah we will show you what
we're looking at but we're trying to be
really smart about our car shopping
hey we're driving in
any little - it's a sports car it's just
my car I'm gonna switch it back to and
light or a test diving it yep I don't
know first of all this seats so
uncomfortable like I'm not used to it at
all try adjusting that poor you know and
change oh it's just a spurt of rock and
you just bucket seats yeah
no fan but that's game I'm not the one
driving in an hour
we're just testing on everything yeah
looks yeah moonroof sunroof something up
there that's plus sunroof
this disease how does it open that's odd
all right let's see me
yeah getting this Marquart I know you're
gonna make piles your nail happens but
it was affordable
he's got a good gas mileage and it's got
some cool little things inside it yeah I
actually like driving it so
and it's got a cool Bluetooth thing for
your phone you can sync it up there's
got a microphone by the mirror and so
the phone will ring and you can just
answer it and talk so that's good as in
if I'm a sleepy I can call big easy
guitar
especially in the winter when his pitch
black hole try he's like this so big he
can ever be a special house and drive
for hours in the winter so you agree to
this house so then we went to the brick
and we could have recorded but we were
literally in there for six minutes and
bought an entire full leather couch sack
yeah one piece of furniture I look
around look around she's like I can't
have time we gotta go and this is like
let's buy this because it was
unbelievable its own what the deal was
yeah it was like this $5,000 real
leather sofa and electric reclining
chairs okay
yeah with electric sliding chairs
so it was Oh tears like the foot thing
right so it was pretty cool it was a
really great mission and like that real
nice leather like not that cold
the only thing was one of the chairs
didn't do actual thing it wasn't like
but $2,500 for each piece it was it was
reduced down to $79
yeah and we have a credit there for
almost a hundred dollars so that's
almost four thousand dollars raised easy
so I could pass it up I was like yeah
we're getting this because whenever it's
clearance to like that's it that's all
they have so if you don't get it they
only have a few miles you miss out like
that's it right so yeah we're
spur-of-the-moment buyers
and then we regret buyers to lose buy it
bring it home they like why would we
applaud this yeah we do that yeah you
marry with the last couch that we bought
I don't think we've logged yet you're
bringing it back just like what color is
this isn't the cause why don't we buy
this I hate it so much everything we
buys like that yeah no dude you regret
it right away yes I I do fireworks all
the time this is so big oh we never get
the dimensions I brought all that stuff
to make sure we remember I get too
excited
