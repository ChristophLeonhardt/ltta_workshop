my dad came up to me and said son it's okay you flunk your exams you already got arrested one of the most important things that you need to realize is when you get nervous you try to cover your white logins and that's why you would see a lot of speakers sometimes fold their hands bring their hands in front of them and that's a sign of nervousness great speakers keep their body open so there is no barrier between you and me raise your hand if you have an emotional model let me see put them all together you get mama and something that when you're starting out you got to be very conscious about it keep your body open it's step number two have your palms open do this exercise with me take a look at your palms turn them around take a look at the inside of your palms again what side relaxes your eye if you really concentrate when you look at the inside of your palm your eye relaxes and a lot of great speakers they open their palms towards the audience showing a more openness and that allows the audience to connect with the speaker better as opposed to showing the back of your hand ladies and gentleman today I'm a dreamer I'm a speaker and I learned the unfailing quality of unconditional love from my wife number three get comfortable with the stage when you're comfortable on the stage that you're speaking on your body is free to move about you know use body language but if you're not comfortable with that stage and if you feel foreign on that stage what happens is your body language starts to constrict and you start to cover your body up and when the Sun sees a mother cry here's a shame that's a life-changing moment she looked at me and said son I want you to be a better man whatever you do don't touch the podium as soon as you do that you're gonna be leaning on it you're going to be shaking that podium and you will be doing all sorts of things on the podium so what you do is you keep a comfortable distance between you and the podium you can keep your notes on it but you can use your hands to gesture don't rest your hands on the podium so keep a distance and you can gesture use body language as you want from a little distance from body
