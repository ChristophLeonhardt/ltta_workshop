EFFORT BACK HOME SOMETIMES

48
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:25,136
INVOLVES POLITICS.

49
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:25,770
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'RE NOT

50
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,504
IMPRESSED WITH THE PRESIDENT'S

51
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,306

54
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:35,079
THAT THIS JOINT STATEMENT IS SO

55
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,048
IMPRECISE.

56
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,149
WITH THE UNITED STATES HAS

00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,883
GAINED IS OF A VAGUE AND

58
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,586
UNVERIFIABLE AT BEST.

59
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:44,422
WHAT NORTH KOREA HAS GAINED

60
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:45,457
HOWEVER IS TANGIBLE AND LASTING.

61
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,459
>> I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

62
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:48,860
THIS IS THE WEAKEST STATEMENT I

HAVE EVER SEEN COME OUT OF ANY

64
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:54,232
ENGAGEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA.

65
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:56,034
>> Harris: A VERY SOUR THERE.

66
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,335
A CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS JOINS

68
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:01,806
US FROM SINGAPORE.

69
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,374
>> IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT

70
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,576
RIGHT HERE AT THE TOP THAT THE

71
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:06,377
DEMOCRATS BACK TO SOME OTHER

72
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:09,013
DEALS WITH NORTH KOREA THAT

73
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:09,781
MIGHT'VE LOOKED WRONG ON THE

74
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,816
SURFACE BUT EVENTUALLY FELL

75
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:12,517
APART WHEN NORTH KOREA DECIDED

76
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:15,420
TO CHEAT ON AT THE PRESIDENT

77
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,088
INSISTING THAT HE IS GOING TO

78
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:19,524
HOLD SANCTIONS AND OTHER ACTIONS

79
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,859
OVER KIM JONG UN'S HEAD TO MAKE

80
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:23,061
SURE THAT HE DOES COMPLY WITH

81
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,829
THE SPIRIT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

82
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,798
SOME SEEM SOME CRITICISM, WE'VE

83
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,066
ALSO SEEN SOME SKEPTICISM OF

84
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,635
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN SINGAPORE

85
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:31,736
BUT FROM U.K. FOREIGN MINISTER

86
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,204
BORIS JOHNSON JUST A SHORT TIME

87
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:34,939
AGO, A STATEMENT OF PRAISE.

88
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,841
JOHNSON SAYING THIS IS AN

89
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:37,475
IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS THE

90
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,043
STABILITY OF THE REGION VITAL TO

91
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,746
GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH.

92
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,047
TO SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE SEEM TO

93
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,015
APPRECIATE WITH THE PRESIDENT

94
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:44,282
DID.

95
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:45,083
THE PRESIDENT POINTING OUT THAT

96
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,018
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, IT'S

97
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,521
A VERY GENERAL DOCUMENT, THE

98
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:50,388
PRESIDENT SAID HE DIDN'T REALLY

99
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,990
HAVE ENOUGH TIME DURING THE

100
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,858
SUMMIT ITSELF TO GET INTO A LOT

101
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:54,292
OF SPECIFICS.

102
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,660
IF THOSE DETAILS ARE TO BE

103
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,729
WORKED OUT IN THE WEEKS AND

104
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,564
MONTHS AHEAD BY A TEAM LED BY

105
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,231
THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE

106
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,699
POMPEO AND HE'LL HAVE HIS FIRST

107
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,034
MEETINGS WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,869
DELEGATION SOMETIME WITHIN THE

109
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:05,637
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

110
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:06,838
THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING SOME

111
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,840
BLOWBACK FROM A MEMBER OF HIS

112
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,109
OWN PARTY ON THE MILITARY FRONT.

113
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,077
LINDSEY GRAHAM CRITICAL OF THE

114
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:15,613
PRESIDENT STATED DESIRE TO ONE

115
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,782
DAY, NOT NECESSARILY NOW REMOVE

116
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,483
U.S. TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA.

117
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:21,452
LISTEN HERE.

118
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,187
>> I WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS

119
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,589
OUTCOME I WANT TO BRING OUR

120
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:25,423
SOLDIERS BACK HOME.

121
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,792
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000

122
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,460
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA.

123
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,629
AND I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING

124
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:32,130
THEM BACK HOME.

125
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,765
THAT'S NOT PART OF THE EQUATION

126
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:34,132
RIGHT NOW.

127
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,133
AT SOME POINT, I HOPE IT WILL BE

128
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:39,037
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

129
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,572
BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED AT THE TOP

130
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,240
OF THIS AT THE PRESIDENT DOES

131
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,142
WANT TO END THESE JOINT U.S.

132
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,144
SOUTH KOREAN MILITARY EXERCISES

133
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,979
SAYING THAT THEY'RE VERY

134
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,480
PROVOCATIVE AND THAT THEY WERE

135
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,115
EXPENSIVE AS WELL.

136
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,651
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT IF

137
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,852
HE CAN GET NORTH KOREA TO

138
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,321
DENUCLEARIZE, IF HE CAN BRING

139
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,324
NORTH KOREA INTO THE LIGHT IN

140
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,059
THE PRESIDENT HAD A VERY

141
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,594
INTERESTING VIDEO THAT HE PLAYED

142
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:03,094
FOR KIM JONG UN.

143
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,964
HE HAD THAT PRODUCED WHERE IT

144
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:06,864
SHOWED NORTH KOREA COMING INTO

145
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,666
THE LIGHT AND THEN A QUESTION OF

146
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,401
WHAT IS THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER

147
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:10,835
GOING TO DO?

148
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:11,569
BUT IF THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES

149
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:12,337
THAT HE CAN DO ALL OF THAT,

150
00:04:12,337 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE MAY NOT BE A NEED FOR AS
