KOREA NEGOTIATIONS HARD LAST NIGHT IN NASHVILLE. WE HEARD A LOT FROM HIM ON THIS. YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MAKING THE POINT ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND BRINGING THEM TO THE TABLE AND MAKING SURE THAT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG-UN SEEMS TO BE ON A GOOD FOOTING. WHICH IT APPEARS TO BE RIGHT NOW. THE WHITE HOUSE NOT SAYING THAT THE SUMMIT IS BACK ON JUST YET. I IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF THAT WILL RIDE ON THE OUTCOME OF MEETINGS BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO AND KIM YONG CHOL OF NORTH KOREA EITHER LATER TODAY OR EARLY TOMORROW MORNING IN NEW YORK. THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY SOUNDING A NOTE OF OPTIMISM ABOUT THE IDEA IT COULD STILL BE ON JUNE 12th. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS ON THE WAY TO A RALLY IN NASHVILLE SAID THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER SAID WE WERE OPEN TO THE MEETING AT THAT TIME AND WE EXPECT IT TO TAKE PLACE BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE'LL BE PREPARED IF IT TAKES PLACE ON JUNE 12th, WE'LL CERTAINLY BE PREPARED IF IT TAKES PLACE AT A LATER DATE AND BE PREPARED FOR THAT AS WELL. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TWO TEAMS IN THE EAST ASIA REGION. ONE LED BY JOE HAGEN IS IN SINGAPORE TO SET UP LOGISTICS FOR A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN, ANOTHER IS AT THE DMZ TO WORK WITH NORTH KOREA ON WHAT THE SUMMIT CAN ACHIEVE. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE A LOT IS PREARRANGED. NASHVILLE POLITICAL RALLY FOR MARSHA BLACKBURN THE PRESIDENT HAD PRAISE FOR JOHN BOLTON WHO GOT NORTH KOREA ALL WORKED UP WHEN HE SAID DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA WOULD LIKELY FOLLOW THE LIBYAN MODEL. President Trump: WHERE IS JOHN BOLTON? THE GREAT JOHN BOLTON. THEY THINK HE IS SO NASTY AND TOUGH THAT I HAVE TO HOLD HIM BACK, OKAY? THAT'S PRETTY GREAT. HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. YOU BETTER GET SOME REST. WE HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD NEGOTIATIONS COMING. YOU BETTER GET REST. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT BOLTON GETS UP EVERY DAY AT LEAST 4:30 AND INTO WORK VERY EARLY. THE PRESIDENT HAS WALKED BACK THE IDEA OF THE LIBYAN MODEL FOR NORTH KOREAN DENUCLEARIZATION SAYING THAT GADHAFI NEVER GOT ANY SECURITY OR POLITICAL GUARANTEES FROM THE UNITED STATES. THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE IS PREPARED TO GIVE KIM JONG-UN PERSONAL, POLITICAL AND SECURITY GUARANTEES IF HE GOES AHEAD WITH DENUCLEARIZATION. WE'LL FIND OUT SOON WHERE ALL THIS GOES. Sandra: A LOT OF QUESTIONS. MEANWHILE IN THE WIDE RANGING RALLY SPEECH LAST NIGHT BY THE PRESIDENT HE LAID OUT A STRATEGY FOR THE MID-TERMS. WHAT DID WE HEAR ON THAT? THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTING LAST NIGHT THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH OVER THE LAST 16 MONTHS WILL BE AT RISK IF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER ONE OR BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AFTER NOVEMBER. TAX CUTS, JOB CREATION, REGULATORY REFORM, NATIONAL SECURITY. THE PRESIDENT ALSO INDICATING LAST NIGHT THAT HE PLANS TO POUND NANCY PELOSI FROM NOW UNTIL NOVEMBER WITH HER CRITICISM OF THE PRESIDENT CALLING MS-13 GANG MEMBERS ANIMALS. LISTEN TO HOW HE WOUND UP THE CROWD LAST NIGHT. President Trump: MS-13 LOVER NANCY PELOSI. LOVES MS-13, CAN YOU IMAGINE? REMEMBER I SAID THEY'RE ANIMALS AND SHE SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT. THEY'RE NOT HUMAN. AND THIS IS WHY WE CALL THE BLOOD-THIRSTY MS-13 GANG MEMBERS EXACTLY THE NAME THAT I USED LAST WEEK. WHAT WAS THE NAME? ANIMALS. THE PRESIDENT GETTING AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION LAST NIGHT LIKE HE USED TO SAY WHO IS GOING THE PAY FOR THE WALL AND THEY WOULD SHOUT BACK MEXICO. THERE ARE A LOT OF MEETINGS WITH KIMS COMING UP. POTENTIAL SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN, MIKE POMPEO'S MEETING WITH KIM YONG CHOL AND KIM KARDASHIAN HAS A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY AND STOP BY AND SAY HELLO TO THE PRESIDENT. SHE IS ADVOCATING FOR A PARDON FOR A GREAT GRANDMOTHER OF HERS WHO HAS BEEN IN JAIL SINCE 1996
