well you got to feel bad for Denzel Washington for not playing the blame game for not embracing the usual tropes of social justice for not being politically correct Washington will no doubt continue to receive considerable blowback from the liberal elites thanks to him daring to speak honestly about some of the real reasons behind the epidemic of black on black crime which is to say the crime problem doesn't stem from the way blacks are treated in the prison system but rather the crux of the matter pertains to the dearth of strong family units in the black community joining me now with more on this refreshing blast of political incorrect honesty by a member of the Hollywood elite no less is our us-based rebel Kristen Tate welcome once again to rebel roundup Kristen thank you so much for having me always a pleasure now Kristen these statistics don't lie in the black community fatherlessness is a major problem as you said your commentary that we just saw more than 70 percent of black children grow up in a single-parent home that's a fact and believe me I don't say this with any degree of relish whatsoever but why is it so verboten to simply state this truth why can't we speak honestly about one of the true root causes of black crime because the last in this country is addicted to victimhood and these Democrats who control the inner cities tell all their constituents that they are victims because it's easier to play the victim card than to take responsibility for the problems in your own community I think Democrats have terribly failed the black community by failing to put in place policies that actually lift up these communities lift up families encouraged to parent households but instead you know they've gotten them dependent on government handouts and they've continued to encourage people to play the victim card and gotten large percentages of inner-cities comfortable Romanian poverty it's really a tragedy and I think people like Denzel Washington so brave and it's that kind of honesty that will really help black Americans because before you can fix problems plaguing these communities you need to identify the actual cause of the problems hey that was an excerpt from my weekly show rebel roundup in which we highlight the best stories of the week with your favorite rebels if you want to see the full show please sign up to become a Premium Member you
