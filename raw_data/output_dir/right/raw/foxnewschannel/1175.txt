1
00:00:00,448 --> 00:00:02,917
BUT FIRST, BILL CLINTON AND A

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,485
PARTY IN DENIAL.

3
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:07,354
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:11,125
ANGLE.

5
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,327
20 YEARS LATER, BILL CLINTON AND

6
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:14,261
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY REFUSED TO

7
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:17,031
LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE PAST.

8
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,867
EVEN WHEN CONFRONTED WITH

9
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:20,835
REALITY, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM

10
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:23,270
PROCESSING THE TRUTH.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,439
DURING AN INTERVIEW TO PUSH HIS

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,142
NEW THRILLER THAT HE COWROTE

13
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:30,311
WITH JAMES PATTERSON COME UP

14
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,011
WARMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON

15
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,348
WAS ASKED THIS BY NBC ANCHOR

16
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,317
CRAIG NELKIN.

17
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:38,352
>> IN 2018, WITH EVERYTHING

18
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:40,020
THAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,455
#MeToo MOVEMENT, HOW WOULD YOU

20
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:44,925
HAVE APPROACHED THE ACCUSATIONS

21
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:45,326
DIFFERENTLY?

22
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:46,727
>> I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE AN

23
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:47,795
ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

24
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,197
THE FACTS INSTEAD OF THE

25
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:50,898
IMAGINED EFFECTS.

26
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,333
IF THE FACTS WHERE THE SAME

27
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,200
TODAY, I WOULDN'T.

28
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,569
A LOT OF THE FACTS HAVE BEEN

29
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:56,637
CONVENIENTLY OMITTED TO MAKE THE

30
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:59,106
STORY WORK.

31
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:01,308
>> Laura: WHICH FACTS ARE

32
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:02,276
THOSE?

33
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:02,776
MAYBE THIS FACT?

34
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:09,416
>> I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL

35
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:15,356
RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN.

36
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:16,891
>> Laura: THIS CAME TO LIGHT

37
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,727
IN A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE

38
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:22,263
BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY PAULA JONES.

39
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:29,670
>>   THAT'S AN UTTERLY FALSE

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,037
STATEMENT.

41
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:34,041
IS THAT CORRECT?

42
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,744
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE MEANING OF

43
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:39,313
THE WORD "IS" IS.

44
00:01:39,313 --> 00:01:43,651
>> Laura: "IS" IS IT STILL

45
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,119
RIDICULOUS THAT HE SAID IT?

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:45,886
YES, IT IS.

47
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,488
EVERY TIME I HEAR THAT, I STILL

48
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:50,257
CAN'T BELIEVE HE SAID THAT.

49
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:50,891
THE PRESIDENT EVENTUALLY

50
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,293
ADMITTED TO THE RELATIONSHIP

51
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,994
WITH LINSKY AND CALLED IT WRONG

52
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,930
AND A RECENT VANITY

53
00:01:58,732 --> 00:01:58,866
VANITY

54
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,837
-- CONSTITUTED A GROSS ABUSE OF

55
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,005
POWER FOR THE MOST POWERFUL MAN

56
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:06,373
ON THE PLANET.

57
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:08,642
27 YEARS MY SENIOR WITH ENOUGH

58
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:09,910
LIFE EXPERIENCE TO KNOW BETTER.

59
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,912
HE WAS, AT THE TIME, IN THE

60
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:12,780
PINNACLE OF HIS CAREER, WHILE I

61
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,449
WAS IN MY FIRST JOB OUT OF

62
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,483
COLLEGE.

63
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,251
WHEN CLINTON WAS CONFRONTED WITH

64
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:22,623
ALL OF THIS, HE GOT VERY, VERY

65
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:23,023
DEFENSIVE.

66
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,825
>> ASKED IF YOU EVER APOLOGIZE,

67
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:27,261
SAID HE HAD.

68
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,330
>> I APPLIES TO EVERYBODY IN THE

69
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,697
WORLD.

70
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:31,465
>> YOU DID NOT APOLOGIZE TO HER.

71
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:34,868
>> I DID NOT TALK TO HER.

72
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:37,605
I -- I DO NOT -- I NEVER TALKED

73
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:40,107
TO HER.

74
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:41,408
I DO SAY PUBLICLY ON MORE THAN

75
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:44,578
ONE OCCASION, WE ALWAYS SEE IT.

76
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,716
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

77
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,484
>> Laura: CONTINUED TO PRESS

78
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:52,486
THE PRESIDENT ABOUT A PRIVATE

79
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,854
APOLOGY CAUSING HIS COAUTHOR

80
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:54,622
JAMES PATTERSON TO RUSH IN LIKE

81
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,890
ALEX CROSS.

82
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,892
>> THIS THING, IT'S 20 YEARS

83
00:02:58,892 --> 00:02:59,159
AGO.

84
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,662
COME ON.

85
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:03,097
TALK ABOUT JFK.

86
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:04,198
LET'S TALK ABOUT LBJ.

87
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:07,268
STOP ALREADY.

88
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,235
>> Laura: STOP ALREADY?

89
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,203
IS THAT THE NAME OF ONE OF HIS

90
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,505
NEW BOOKS?

91
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,873
IS SOME OF HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S

92
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,041
CRIMES TAKE PLACE 20 YEARS AGO,

93
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:14,608
DID THEY NOT?

94
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,510
TO BE FORGIVE AND FORGET ALL

95
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,545
THOSE EGREGIOUS ASSAULTS AGAINST

96
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:22,049
WOMEN AS WELL?

97
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:22,683
BILL CLINTON RED-FACED AND

98
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:25,486
INDIGNANT REFUSED TO GIVE AN

99
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:26,887
INCH.

100
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:30,090
>> DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT

101
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,358
PRESIDENT KENNEDY -- DO YOU

102
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:31,992
BELIEVE PRESIDENT JOHNSON

103
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:36,330
SHOULD'VE RESIGNED?

104
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,698
I PROMISED TO DO A GOOD JOB

105
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,300
SINCE THEN WITH MY LIFE AND MY

106
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,600
WORK.

107
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,703
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

108
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:44,638
>> Laura: I LIKE HOW HE TRIED

109
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:45,773
TO TURN THE TABLES ON THE

110
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:46,473
REPORTER.

111
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:47,641
BILL, HE'S THE REPORTER.

112
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,342
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE

113
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:50,611
QUESTION TO RECONCILE WITH HIS

114
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,011
PUBLIC PATH.

115
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,513
YOU DO.

116
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:55,649
EVEN CLINTON'S OWN PARTY AT THIS

117
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,719
POINT, HE JUST WANTS HIM TO GO

118
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,153
AWAY.

119
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:00,754
THIS IS THE RUINED PATH OF THE

120
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:03,490
PARTY CONFRONTING ITS PATHETIC

121
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,692
RESIDENT.

122
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,093
BECAUSE, LIKE CLINTON, THE

123
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:06,960
DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO LEARN THE

124
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,463
LESSONS OF THE PAST.

125
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:13,801
DESPITE THE PREVIOUS EMBRACE OF

126
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:15,302
SEXUAL CREDITORS FROM WEINSTEIN

127
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:19,273
TO SPACEY, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

128
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:20,874
ARRESTED A #MeToo MOVEMENT AND

129
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:22,076
POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THEY

130
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:22,843
HOPE WILL DELIVER FEMALE VOTERS

131
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:24,611
TO THE POLLS IN NOVEMBER.

132
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,115
BUT BILL CLINTON REMAINS A

133
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,717
BOTHERSOME OBSTACLE, IF THEY ARE

134
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:30,417
ASSUMING THE MORAL HIGH GROUND

135
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:35,289
ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

136
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,958
FOUND 80% OF DEMOCRAT VOTERS

137
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:38,692
CONSIDER SEXUAL HARASSMENT A TOP

138
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,194
ISSUE FOR THEM.

139
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:41,628
BUT ONLY 38% OF REPUBLICANS FEEL

140
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,330
THE SAME WAY.

141
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,799
THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THIS

142
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,836
IS THEIR NEW WEDGE ISSUE.

143
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:51,505
OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON, COME

144
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:53,273
ON, LET'S REMEMBER, THEY WERE

145
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:53,941
ALL ABOUT DIVIDING AMERICANS

146
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:56,276
USING RACE, GENDER, TO DRIVE

147
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,546
PEOPLE TO THE POLLS.

148
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,314
AMAZINGLY, DEMOCRATS HAVE

149
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,349
EMBRACED THAT APPROACH TODAY.

150
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,319
AND WHILE OBAMA DISPARAGE

151
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,053
WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS AS

152
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:09,857
BITTER PEOPLE CLING TO THEIR

153
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:13,260
GUNS AND RELIGION,

154
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,994
HILLARY CLINTON DARED INSANITY

155
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,864
FOR DARING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

156
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,266
BEYOND THE IMPEACHMENT AND

157
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:22,102
SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR, BILL CLINTON

158
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:22,736
COULD ACTUALLY TEACH THE

159
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,704
DEMOCRATS A LOT.

160
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:25,472
OF COURSE, HE WAS A COMMITTED

161
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,641
GLOBALIST ON ISSUES LIKE CHINA

162
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,876
GETTING INTO THE WTO AND NAFTA,

163
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:32,446
HE WAS ALSO A SOUTHERN DEMOCRAT,

164
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:33,347
AND HE DID UNDERSTAND THAT

165
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:34,648
BLUE-COLLAR SENSIBILITY.

166
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,017
THE WORKING PEOPLE.

167
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,019
AND REMEMBER WHEN CLINTON

168
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:39,887
DECLARED THIS IN HIS REELECTION

169
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:42,856
YEAR STATE OF THE UNION?

170
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,259
>> WE KNOW AND WE HAVE WORK TO

171
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,860
GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A

172
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,494
SMALLER, LESS BUREAUCRATIC

173
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,496
GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON.

174
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,698
AND WE HAVE TO GIVE THE AMERICAN

175
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:53,033
PEOPLE ONES THAT LIVE WITHIN ITS

176
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,868
MEANS.

177
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,870
THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS

178
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,171
OVER.

179
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,473
>> Laura: CLINTON OVERSAW

180
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:02,676
WELFARE REFORM, COLLABORATED

181
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:03,310
WITH REPUBLICANS TO PASS A

182
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,146
BALANCED BUDGET, AND HE SIGNED

183
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,681
THAT THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE

184
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:08,682
ACT -- A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET

185
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:09,283
THAT.

186
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,051
THIS WAS AFTER THE '94

187
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:11,819
SHELLACKING THE DEMOCRATS HAD IN

188
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,821
THAT MIDTERM ELECTION CYCLE.

189
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,756
CLINTON IS LIKE, WELL, I HAVE TO

190
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,291
WORK WITH THE REPUBLICANS NOW.

191
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,692
THAT MADE SENSE.

192
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,394
EVEN DURING HIS LIFE'S CAMPAIGN,

193
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,896
HE REPORTEDLY CONFRONTED HER

194
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,065
STAFF ABOUT THEIR SEEMING

195
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:26,099
DISINTEREST IN WORKING-CLASS

196
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:26,834
AMERICANS, AND HE REPORTEDLY

197
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,336
URGED THEM TO REACH OUT TO THOSE

198
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:32,005
VOTERS WHO WERE FEELING IGNORED.

199
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:35,075
HIS ADVICE WAS DISMISSED.

200
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,944
LED BY ROBBIE MOO, HILLARY'S

201
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,946
CAMPAIGN DECIDED TO DOUBLE DOWN

202
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,482
ON TARGETING YOUNG, LATINO, AND

203
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:42,182
BLACK VOTERS IN THEIR EFFORT

204
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,817
TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY.

205
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,287
THAT WORKED OUT WELL.

206
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,555
LIKE BILL CLINTON'S FAILURE TO

207
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,625
READ THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES, AND

208
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,228
APPRECIATE THE LESSONS OF THE

209
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:54,895
PAST, DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO

210
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:58,031
ACKNOWLEDGE AND RESPECT THE

211
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:58,732
VOTERS THAT TRUMP HAS BROUGHT

212
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:01,835
INTO THE FOLD.

213
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:03,170
SHOULD THIS CONTINUE, CLINTON

214
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,673
AND JAMES PATTERSON MAY WANT TO

215
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,408
RECONSIDER, LIKE, A NEW TITLE,

216
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,843
MAY BE, FOR THEIR BOOK WHEN IT

217
00:07:09,843 --> 00:00:00,000
PREMIERES IN PAPERBACK?
