00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:26,726
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WARN DEVASTATING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

13
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,095
DEVASTATING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND HERE’S WHY.

14
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,664
AND HERE’S WHY. METHANE MAKES UP ON THE 9% OF

15
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:34,501
METHANE MAKES UP ON THE 9% OF GREENHOUSE GASES BUT IT’S 25%

16
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,435
GREENHOUSE GASES BUT IT’S 25% MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CARBON

17
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,204
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CARBON DIOXIDE IN TRAPPING HEAT IN THE

18
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:37,604
DIOXIDE IN TRAPPING HEAT IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

19
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:38,872

00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:04,898
>> THE MAIN RULE THAT’S IN PLACE IS A 2016 RULE PUT IN PLACE BY

36
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,534
IS A 2016 RULE PUT IN PLACE BY THE EPA WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES

37
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,037
THE EPA WHICH REQUIRES COMPANIES TO HAVE A PRETTY RIGOROUS

38
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,972
TO HAVE A PRETTY RIGOROUS SCHEDULE FOR MONITORING AND

39
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,341
SCHEDULE FOR MONITORING AND INSPECTING LEAKS OF METHANE FROM

40
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,243
INSPECTING LEAKS OF METHANE FROM OIL AND GAS DRILLING WELLS.

41
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,213
OIL AND GAS DRILLING WELLS. THAT SOUNDS KIND OF WONKY, BUT

42
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,648
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF WONKY, BUT OIL AND GAS DRILLING WELLS ARE

43
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:22,750
OIL AND GAS DRILLING WELLS ARE ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF LEAKS

44
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:25,019
ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF LEAKS OF METHANE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE

45
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:29,823
OF METHANE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND, AS YOU SAID, METHANE IS --

46
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,959
AND, AS YOU SAID, METHANE IS -- IT IS SORT OF LIKE A SUPER

47
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:33,260
IT IS SORT OF LIKE A SUPER GREENHOUSE GAS SO EVEN JUST

48
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,796
GREENHOUSE GAS SO EVEN JUST LEAKS OF IT ACTUALLY ARE

49
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,231
LEAKS OF IT ACTUALLY ARE EXTREMELY POTENT IN TRAPPING

50
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:37,965
EXTREMELY POTENT IN TRAPPING GREENHOUSE GASES.

51
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,900
GREENHOUSE GASES. SO OIL AND GAS COMPANIES WERE

52
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:42,069
SO OIL AND GAS COMPANIES WERE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS

53
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:42,469
VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS REGULATION.

54
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,238
REGULATION. THEY SAID IT REQUIRED, YOU KNOW,

55
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:47,741
THEY SAID IT REQUIRED, YOU KNOW, IN SOME CASES SIX-MONTH

56
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:48,142
IN SOME CASES SIX-MONTH INSPECTIONS.

57
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,244
INSPECTIONS. IN SOME CASES, YOU KNOW, WHEN

58
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:53,681
IN SOME CASES, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY FOUND LEAKS, THEY WERE

59
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:57,218
THEY FOUND LEAKS, THEY WERE REQUIRED -- YOU HAD A GREAT

60
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,285
REQUIRED -- YOU HAD A GREAT INTERVIEW THERE WITH THE

61
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:00,154
INTERVIEW THERE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN ENERGY

62
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:04,392
PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN ENERGY ALLIANCE, A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT

63
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:05,092
ALLIANCE, A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT GAS AND OIL COMPANIES.

64
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:08,496
GAS AND OIL COMPANIES. THE OBAMA ERA EPA METHANE RULE

65
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,231
THE OBAMA ERA EPA METHANE RULE WAS THE DEFINITION OF RED TAPE,

66
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,166
WAS THE DEFINITION OF RED TAPE, A RECORDKEEPING NIGHTMARE THAT

67
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,168
A RECORDKEEPING NIGHTMARE THAT WAS TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

68
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:14,969
WAS TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE IN THE FIELD.

69
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,306
EXECUTE IN THE FIELD. I MEAN, IS IT TECHNICALLY

70
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:18,706
I MEAN, IS IT TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE?

71
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:20,508
IMPOSSIBLE? I DON’T KNOW IF THIS IS THE KIND

72
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,510
I DON’T KNOW IF THIS IS THE KIND OF MAYBE A TOUGH QUESTION, BUT

73
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:27,415
OF MAYBE A TOUGH QUESTION, BUT AS A PERCENTAGE OF PROFITS, WAS

74
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,816
AS A PERCENTAGE OF PROFITS, WAS IT THAT BURDENSOME?

75
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:33,688
IT THAT BURDENSOME? >> WELL, THE OIL COMPANY SAID IT

76
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:35,590
>> WELL, THE OIL COMPANY SAID IT COULD HAVE COST SEVERAL HUNDRED

77
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,425
COULD HAVE COST SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVERALL, TO THE

78
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,794
MILLION DOLLARS OVERALL, TO THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW,

79
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,429
INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, PAYING PEOPLE TO GO OUT IN THE

80
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,331
PAYING PEOPLE TO GO OUT IN THE FIELDS, THE TIME IT TAKES TO DO

81
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:45,433
FIELDS, THE TIME IT TAKES TO DO THE INSPECTION, KEEPING TRACK.

82
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,102
THE INSPECTION, KEEPING TRACK. YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF A CUT FROM

83
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:50,204
YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF A CUT FROM THE ENTIRE OIL INDUSTRY’S BOTTOM

84
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:52,440
THE ENTIRE OIL INDUSTRY’S BOTTOM LINE, IT’S NOT A LOT.

85
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,509
LINE, IT’S NOT A LOT. IT’S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

86
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,311
IT’S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

87
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:59,247
OF MONEY. AGAIN, COMPARISON OF OVERALL

88
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:00,815
AGAIN, COMPARISON OF OVERALL PROFITS, IT’S NOT HUGE.

89
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:02,617
PROFITS, IT’S NOT HUGE. THE OIL AND GAS COMPANIES DID

90
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:06,955
THE OIL AND GAS COMPANIES DID SAY THAT THIS WAS -- IT WAS --

91
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:09,624
SAY THAT THIS WAS -- IT WAS -- IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO

92
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:09,958
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE.

93
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,526
EXECUTE. WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

94
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:14,763
WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID AND WHAT ENVIRONMENT LISTS

95
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:17,532
SAID AND WHAT ENVIRONMENT LISTS SAY IS, LOOK, THIS IS A MATTER

96
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,533
SAY IS, LOOK, THIS IS A MATTER OF KEEPING TRACK OF THESE LEAKS,

97
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:20,568
OF KEEPING TRACK OF THESE LEAKS, YOU KNOW, THE LONGER YOU GO, IF

98
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,671
YOU KNOW, THE LONGER YOU GO, IF YOU DON’T DETECT A LEAK, THAT’S

99
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:24,072
YOU DON’T DETECT A LEAK, THAT’S EXACTLY HOW THE METHANE IS GOING

100
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,740
EXACTLY HOW THE METHANE IS GOING TO GET INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

101
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:28,577
TO GET INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. WHAT THIS PROPOSES TO DO IS

102
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:30,579
WHAT THIS PROPOSES TO DO IS LOOSEN THAT MONITORING SCHEDULE

103
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,748
LOOSEN THAT MONITORING SCHEDULE FROM EVERY SIX MONTHS, IN SOME

104
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:37,953
FROM EVERY SIX MONTHS, IN SOME CASES TO AS LONG AS EVERY TWO

105
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:38,253
CASES TO AS LONG AS EVERY TWO YEARS.

106
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:38,987
YEARS. SO, OPPONENTS OF THIS ARE SAYING

107
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:39,921
SO, OPPONENTS OF THIS ARE SAYING IF YOU DO AN INSPECTION AND

108
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,757
IF YOU DO AN INSPECTION AND THERE’S A LEAK THE NEXT DAY,

109
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,158
THERE’S A LEAK THE NEXT DAY, THEY COULD HAPPEN AT ANYTIME,

110
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,693
THEY COULD HAPPEN AT ANYTIME, YOU COULD HAVE UP TO TWO YEARS

111
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:47,296
YOU COULD HAVE UP TO TWO YEARS WITH A LEAK OF THIS POTENT

112
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:48,897
WITH A LEAK OF THIS POTENT PLANET WARMING GAS, YOU KNOW,

113
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,766
PLANET WARMING GAS, YOU KNOW, SEEPING OUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

114
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,302
SEEPING OUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS IS, THIS REALLY IS SEEN,

115
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:55,738
THIS IS, THIS REALLY IS SEEN, YOU KNOW, ON ONE HAND, IT’S

116
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:57,706
YOU KNOW, ON ONE HAND, IT’S ABOUT MONITORING AND DETECTION.

117
00:03:57,741 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT MONITORING AND DETECTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS A
