these in in the real ocean like right
here usually just at a zoo
that is awesome
what do you think it's doing there pops
what I mean you're the expert on the
manatees so my personal opinion is it's
a male and a female and they are in love
big old buoyant bubbles we think it is
pretty cool it will not quit raining man

crazy and now we have to do what we hate
doing the most packing packing packing
in our room our room right now is at
half power I'm not even kidding these
lights look at this to top it off not
only is the weather crazy and the lights
literally the room is that
power there's no internet we have no
internet right now which is scary
because I need to upload this video you
okay how many sneezes an hour are you
doing you were over the sneeze limit
what yeah that's why I wanna travel home
in bright blue underwear dude this place
is off the hook right now it's like
something out of a horror movie
okay so we came here with a lot of
suitcases most of them or dude most of
our suitcases were already closed to
overweight and now a lot of our clothes
are still wet we need to figure out how
to drive dry knob this thing it's
amazing it does both washes in dress can
hop in if you want to dry up what's the
odds of power even running this thing
right now
really all right guys probably the worst
night to lose power at a resort guys we
are disco night baby
luckily Kane brought about 500 go sticks
yeah ready oh oh that's a flashlight oh
you're probably so happy right now

the lamps the power is on the night we
have to pack our room we have stuff
