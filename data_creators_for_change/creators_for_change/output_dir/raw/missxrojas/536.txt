sent off to the harry potter alliance

00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,850
yesterday I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a completely great idea</font>

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,000
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you make a video you</font>

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,220
say your name<font color="#E5E5E5"> your age where you're from</font>

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,050
take a candle you take some sweet of

10
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,329
like you say I like to kind of hope for

11
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,850
a wonder and then you stay silent your

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,519
candle lit for like 10 seconds of 15

13
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,559
seconds or something and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> video is</font>

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,310
important that you make people<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,120
this catastrophic event I mean that

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,650
genocide killed the run to genocide

44
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,140
killed in nearly a million and they were

45
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,720
genocides with the other related

46
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">conflicts that killed hundreds of</font>

47
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,860
thousands we're all human for God's sake

48
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,379
it's important that people whose wealth

51
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of the Sudan to bet myanmar Iraq</font>

general Lebanon so many places these are

54
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,200
countries that I think do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we care that's what Amnesty</font>

in the paper the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other week about people</font>

people who write to them I mean what is

65
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,019
talk about if you want to take part of

66
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,760
but all the details over here I don't

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,140
know I've kind of just been thinking a

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,530
lot about our place<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world it's</font>

69
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,049
dramatic and tragic it will stems I

70
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,290
guess from my am English literature

71
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,470
exams that are coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've got to</font>

72
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,840
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big paper on the First World War</font>

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
and other literature from that and I've

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,480
been kind of building up like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,769
document of it all and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

76
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,629
these things that just make you make you

77
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,510
think I'm not a huge fan of all poetry

78
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,609
it all gets thrown at you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much when</font>

79
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in primary school at least here</font>

80
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,819
because it's you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> great board</font>

81
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,150
World War two you you feel overwhelmed

82
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get tired of it you get bored of it</font>

83
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,829
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it sounds awful but you do with</font>

84
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,340
then I read a poem Sassoon's aftermath

85
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,549
and it just it jacked me and I'm reading

86
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,709
letters that people wrote to their sons

87
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,769
or their fiance's they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> Britain</font>

88
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,590
who's kind of tone of superiority I find

89
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,239
really tiring when I read her literature

90
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just have to read one letter from</font>

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,530
letters from a jet lost generation that

92
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,829
she writes to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiance who dies it's</font>

93
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,238
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's overwhelming and it's why</font>

94
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">I love literature speaking of which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

anyone else if you like dystopian future

104
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,070
kind of things it's really intelligent

some very interesting issues explored

111
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,610
basically it's a world where the there's

112
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,680
been a war between the pro-life and

113
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,330
pro-choice and they've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

114
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,690
this bill of life that says that you

115

of you know the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> premise and three</font>

120
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,310
kids escape from this and it's just

121

<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing even I got to the end and I was</font>

other things as well all this I'm not

125
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,070
studying that i've also been doing led

126
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,370
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think you know about you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm sure so we've heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the attacks</font>

of impossible to comprehend from someone

<font color="#CCCCCC">remnants of it I just hope that it stops</font>

136
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,960
there but perhaps that's under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the naive</font>

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,370
so there was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else I want to</font>

138
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,110
talk about which was the raising of

tuition fees and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been suggested</font>

140
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,730
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I might leave that for</font>

141
