keith one of your backers is lionsgate obviously huge offline presence in media what has their perspective brought to your business I think so we started partnering with them in June of 07 I think one of the reasons behind that was we wanted to learn more about what the studio perspective was and I think they've really been at the forefront there a number of their partnerships and trying to expand distribution so they're partners with epics in the channel epics which essentially opened up online before it opened up on cable and so you could stream movies they're partners with fearnet which is a very large presence I think their attitude is you know we own content let's figure out the ways to exploit it and they're doing that you know through those partnerships throughout San through YouTube so it's been great to see someone who's wants to experiment in the space and test new distribution platforms as soon as they have what is the overall perspective of online video from studios and networks I think generally they're very scared about it as you know they probably should be they existed in this closed system for a long time which increasingly has gotten more open originally had three networks we were talking other day about how the nightly news used to have a 30 share and now the Super Bowl barely gets a 30 share and so their world has changed so dramatically and that fragmentation has created new opportunities to distribute content which excites them but unfortunately each of those new avenues seems to be less profitable than the avenues they had before and I think they're looking at this is saying we can now distribute our garbage everywhere but for free right it's a little concern by it so does TV have a place on the web like what is the perfect marriage of this I'm not absolutely thing hulu is demonstrated that kind of content will certainly play well and we got a partnership with who and people come to our site and enjoy that content I think the question is in short form in particular will what works on television work on the internet and it doesn't seem to be the case at all historically it's it's not been the case the exciting part for us is actually what happens in the next few years as convergence happens and you know is there a real difference between TV distribution and web distribution over time is there if you're looking at one screen and that screen is your television and you can seamlessly go back and forth our is break com have the potential to be a cable channel that migrates into doing more long-form type content and are the existing networks going to have the opportunity to do short form but profitable interstitials potentially all right you guys last year bought HBO labs was their experimental online video presents who's that seen as a big failure in the industry or I mean I certainly it's been remarkable for us that we were motivated to do the deal because we were having a great success in our original content efforts and in particular on the branded content side we'd seen a tremendous uptake from our advertisers and the products we were offering their I think what HBO saw was they were having great success creating compelling content but HBO is not a sales company they don't even have a sales force it's under their charter they're not allowed to sell ads and they wanted to see that content get more widely distributed and monetized and so we're in LA we were a perfect partner for it you bought it outright yeah we bought it outright although they still have legacy rights some of the content creator Corey's it up and the other the shows are you looking for similar content or acquisitions now we're always keeping our eyes open for anything that seems to be like fitting for either our audience segments which is young guys or can expand our either content we create in the video segment or the distribution we have so we're actively looking we've got a team that is out there and it's been tough to find deals just everyone's expectations are too high so prime time is now not you know eight to ten it's now noon to what everybody's on their lunch break how are you guys capitalizing on that and what does that mean from networks and studios I think you know our approach has always been I think one of the reasons we've been successful across our sites as we you know we stick to schedules and we stick to frequent content updates and I think the way we capitalize out is that if you capitalize on that is if you're our average person and we know you're going to come to us at specific hours we need to make sure there's refresh content on there as much as possible during that time frame increasingly what's interesting is on the advertiser side we're starting more and more to target day parts in advertising I think one of those exciting developments in the advertising front will be seeing how that happens so you'll start seeing chilis ads for example around lunchtime something that already happens effectively on television but we haven't really seen yet too much on the internet I think we're going to start seeing a lot more that's but from a content and an advertising standpoint we're trying to migrate to that model as well in certain cases now on content for the the legacy or incumbent studios and networks are any of them doing anything forward-thinking or experimental online I think they've all had their bits and pieces where they've tried stuff and I think Fox still has a studio internally that is about it is devoted to testing and piloting concepts I think the individual show runners on the networks are increasingly building it into their shows I think the guys who run how i met your mother seem to be doing it really effectively it's a show on CBS and they frequently build in web concepts properties and jokes into the show and then build up existing web presences for those already so they'll mention something on the show and then be a fully dedicated website to it that will already be SEO optimized so I think the networks and studios themselves have come in and out of the space a couple times over the last few years I think more and more the creator's themselves are actually finding ways they can innovate in the space as well so what is the partnership or collaboration between these two worlds offline and online look the next couple years it's just sort of going to be a trial and error to see what happens or is it going to combine into one are your your predictions yeah and the two year time frame I think what happens is the networks and the studios continue to source content and ideas from the internet because it's a testing ground I don't know if they're going to make their own and test it there but certainly they're going to look for stuff that is working and leverage that to make books TV shows movies potentially and that's sort of what they've been doing very slowly over the last few years i think that pace is accelerating things can catch the zeitgeist very quickly and then translate into other platforms i think in a longer time horizon what you're seeing is the budgets that guys like us have for creating content and monetizing our properties continue to go up and up a few years ago if we spent twenty-five dollars on a video it would be a huge budget for us and now we spent thousands of dollars for a one-minute video which is not too different than digital cable and as our monetization and distribution capabilities continue to improve I think you'll see us looking for ways we can expand on our own properties and us searching the web to capitalize so the next few years is definitely an incumbent advantage by those players but I think in longer time frame we're all basically going to be equals from from an exploitation standpoint great Thank You key thank you
