HISTORIC 12-DAY TRIP TO ASIA.

IT WAS THE LONGEST VISIT TO THE 

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REGION BY AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT 

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,191
IN MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A 

47
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:02,424
CENTURY.

48
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:03,625
EVERYWHERE WE WENT, OUR FOREIGN 

49
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,960

AND THIS GREAT RESPECT SHOWED 

55
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:21,143
VERY WELL OUR COUNTRY IS FURTHER

56
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:23,411
EVIDENCE THAT AMERICA'S RENEWED 

57
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,779
CONFIDENCE IN STANDING IN THE 

58
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,548
WORLD HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER 

59
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,284
THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW.

60
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:31,053
WHEN WE ARE CONFIDENT IN 

61
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,621
OURSELVES, OUR STRENGTH, OUR 

62
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:35,123
FLAG, OUR HISTORY, OUR VALUES, 

63
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:37,593
OTHER NATIONS ARE CONFIDENT IN 

64
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:37,926
US.

65
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:40,128
AND WHEN WE TREAT OUR CITIZENS 

66
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:43,165
WITH THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE, 

67
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:43,965
OTHER COUNTRIES TREAT AMERICA 

68
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:47,202
WITH THE RESPECT THAT OUR 

69
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:49,605
COUNTRY SO RICHLY DESERVES.

70
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:52,340
DURING OUR TRAVELS, THIS IS 

71
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,644
EXACTLY WHAT THE WORLD SAW.

72
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:59,447
A STRONG, PROUD, AND CONFIDENT 

73
00:00:59,447 --> 00:00:59,848
AMERICA.

74
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:01,683
TODAY, I WANT TO UPDATE THE 

75
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:03,485
AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE 

76
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:04,919
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF THIS TRIP 

77
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:07,189
AND THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TO 

78
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,124
ADVANCE AMERICAN SECURITY AND 

79
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:10,592
PROSPERITY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

80
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,994
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE, OUR 

81
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:16,064
COUNTRY WAS FACED WITH A SERIES 

82
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,699
OF GROWING DANGERS.

83
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:20,101
THESE THREATS INCLUDED ROGUE 

84
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:22,871
REGIMES PURSUING DEADLY WEAPONS,

85
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,374
FOREIGN POWERS CHALLENGING 

86
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,841
AMERICA'S INFLUENCE, THE SPREAD 

87
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:29,344
OF THE MURDEROUS TERROR GROUP 

88
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,380
ISIS, AND YEARS OF UNFAIR TRADE 

89
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,115
PRACTICES THAT HAD DANGEROUSLY 

90
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,117
DEPLETED OUR MANUFACTURING BASE 

91
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:38,153
AND WIPED OUT MILLIONS AND 

92
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:41,657
MILLIONS OF MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS.

93
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,425
THE CHALLENGES WERE INHERITED, 

94
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:45,960
AND THESE PRODUCTS REALLY SHOWED

95
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,764
WHAT PREVIOUS MISTAKES WERE MADE

96
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:51,633
OVER MANY YEARS AND EVEN DECADES

97
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,635
BY OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS.

98
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:56,004
SOME OF THESE MISTAKES WERE BORN

99
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,639
OF DIFFERENCE AND NEGLECT.

100
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:00,976
OTHERS FROM NAIVE THINKING AND 

101
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:01,576
MISGUIDED JUDGMENT.

102
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:04,279
IN SOME CASES, THE NEGATIVE 

103
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:06,214
INFLUENCE OF PARTISAN POLITICS 

104
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:09,116
AND SPECIAL INTERESTS WAS TO 

105
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:09,618
BLAME.

106
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:11,753
BUT THE ONE COMMON THREAD BEHIND

107
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:15,457
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS WAS A 

108
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:17,259
FAILURE TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE 

109
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,495
THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN 

110
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:23,065
PEOPLE AND AMERICAN WORKERS.

111
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,367
UPON MY INAUGURATION, I PLEDGED 

112
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,436
THAT WE WOULD REBUILD AMERICA, 

113
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:29,371
RESTORE ITS ECONOMIC STRENGTH, 

114
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,106
AND DEFEND ITS NATIONAL 

115
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:31,373
SECURITY.

116
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,742
WITH THIS GOAL IN MIND, I VOWED 

117
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:36,111
THAT WE WOULD REAFFIRM OLD 

118
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:37,579
ALLIANCES AND FORM NEW 

119
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,215
FRIENDSHIPS IN PURSUIT OF SHARED

120
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:40,415
GOALS.

121
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:43,952
ABOVE ALL, I SWORE THAT IN EVERY

122
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,420
DECISION WITH EVERY ACTION, I 

123
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,722
WOULD PUT THE BEST INTERESTS OF 

124
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:50,792
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST.

125
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:53,128
OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS, 

126
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,563
TRAVELING ACROSS THE GLOBE AND 

127
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:57,466
MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS, THAT

128
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:00,369
IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE DONE.

129
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:01,937
EARLIER THIS YEAR, IN SAUDI 

130
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:03,505
ARABIA, I SPOKE TO THE LEADERS 

131
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:06,541
OF MORE THAN 50 ERIC AND MUSLIM 

132
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,310
NATIONS ABOUT OUR STRATEGY TO 

133
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,478
DEFEAT TERRORISTS BY STRIPPING 

134
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:12,580
THEM OF FINANCING, TERRITORY, 

135
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,516
AND IDEALOGICAL SUPPORT.

136
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:17,252
AND I URGED THE LEADERS TO DRIVE

137
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,721
OUT THE TERRORISTS AND 

138
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,790
EXTREMISTS FROM THEIR SOCIETIES.

139
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,292
SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE DEALT 

140
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:28,129
ISIS ONE CRUSHING DEFEAT AFTER 

141
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,831
ANOTHER.

142
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,134
IN ISRAEL I REAFFIRMED THE 

143
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:32,968
UNBREAKABLE BOND BETWEEN AMERICA

144
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,502
AND THE JEWISH STATE, AND I MET 

145
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:37,673
WITH LEADERS OF THE PALESTINIAN 

146
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:39,207
AUTHORITY AND INITIATED AN 

147
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,176
EFFORT TO FACILITATE LASTING 

148
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,877
PEACE BETWEEN THE ISRAELIS AND 

149
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,013
THE PALESTINIANS.

150
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,549
IN BRUSSELS, I URGED OUR NATO 

151
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,651
ALLIES TO DO MORE TO STRENGTHEN 

152
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:51,420
OUR CRUCIAL ALLIANCE AND SET THE

153
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,189
STAGE FOR SIGNIFICANT INCREASES 

154
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,958
IN MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS.

155
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,061
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

156
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:03,465
ARE POURING IN BECAUSE OF THAT 

157
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:04,066
INITIATIVE.

158
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,234
NATO, BELIEVE ME, IS VERY HAPPY 

159
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:08,870
WITH DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT I 

160
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,137
DID.

161
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:11,539
IN WARSAW, I DECLARED TO THE 

162
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:14,175
WORLD AMERICA'S RESOLVE TO 

163
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:16,010
PRESERVE AND PROTECT WESTERN 

164
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,911
CIVILIZATION AND THE VALUES WE 

165
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,415
HOLD SO DEAR.

166
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:23,952
IN ROME, SICILY, HAMBURG, AND 

167
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:24,953
PARIS, I STRENGTHENED OUR 

168
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:26,621
FRIENDSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIES TO 

169
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,456
PROMOTE OUR SHARED INTERESTS OF 

170
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,926
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY.

171
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,460
IN SEPTEMBER AT THE UNITED 

172
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,629
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW 

173
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,364
YORK, I URGED THAT THE NATIONS 

174
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:40,235
OF THE WORLD JOIN IN CONFRONTING

175
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,569
ROGUE REGIMES THAT THREATEN 

176
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,305
HUMANITY AND LAID OUT A MODEL 

177
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,207
FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 

178
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,411
GROUNDED IN RESPECT FOR 

179
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,378
SOVEREIGNTY AND THE 

180
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:52,748
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH 

181
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:52,914
IT.

182
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,850
ON EACH TRIP, I HAVE WORKED TO 

183
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,851
ADVANCE AMERICAN INTERESTS AND 

184
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:57,819
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD.

185
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,387
AND TO EACH OF THESE PLACES I 

186
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:02,290
HAVE CARRIED OUR VISION FOR A 

187
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,926
BETTER, A VISION FOR SOMETHING 

188
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:07,195
STRONGER, AND SOVEREIGN, SO 

189
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,930
IMPORTANT.

190
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,331
SOVEREIGN.

191
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,932
AND INDEPENDENT NATIONS ROOTED 

192
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,734
IN THEIR HISTORIES, CONFIDENT IN

193
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,036
THEIR DESTINIES, AND COOPERATING

194
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:17,539
TOGETHER TO ADVANCE THEIR 

195
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,174
SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND THE 

196
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:21,443
NOBLE CAUSE OF PEACE.

197
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:23,511
IT WAS THIS SAME VISION THAT I 

198
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,881
CARRIED TO ASIA TWO WEEKS AGO.

199
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,548
AND IT WAS THIS SAME COMMITMENT 

200
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,851
TO YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 

201
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,953
THAT WAS ALWAYS AT THE FOREFRONT

202
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:34,990
OF MY MIND AND MY THINKING.

203
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,259
OUR TRIP WAS DEFINED BY THREE 

204
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,662
CORE GOALS.

205
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:41,863
FIRST, TO UNITE THE WORLD 

206
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,032
AGAINST THE NUCLEAR MENACE POSED

207
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,768
BY THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME, A 

208
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,436
THREAT THAT HAS INCREASED 

209
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,839
STEADILY THROUGH MANY 

210
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,875
ADMINISTRATIONS AND NOW REQUIRES

211
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,943
URGENT ACTION.

212
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:57,612
SECOND, TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S 

213
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:58,747
ALLIANCES AND ECONOMIC 

214
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:01,850
PARTNERSHIPS IN A FREE AND OPEN 

215
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,718
INDO-PACIFIC MADE UP OF THRIVING

216
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,153
INDEPENDENT NATIONS RESPECTFUL 

217
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:08,256
OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEIR OWN

218
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:12,461
CITIZENS AND SAFE FROM FOREIGN 

219
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:14,196
DOMINATION AND ECONOMIC 

220
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:14,463
SERVITUDE.

221
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:16,731
AND THIRD, TO FINALLY, AFTER 

222
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:22,671
MANY YEARS, INSIST ON FAIR AND 

223
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,705
RECIPROCAL TRADE.

224
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:27,108
FAIR AND RECIPROCAL TRADE.

225
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:27,742
SO IMPORTANT.

226
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:31,046
THESE TWO WORDS, FAIRNESS AND 

227
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,814
RECIPROCITY, ARE AN OPEN 

228
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:34,282
INVITATION TO EVERY COUNTRY THAT

229
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:36,685
SEEKS TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE 

230
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:37,018
UNITED STATES.

231
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,120
AND THEY ARE A FIRM WARNING TO 

232
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,389
EVERY COUNTRY THAT CHEATS, 

233
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,192
BREAKS THE RULES, AND ENGAGES IN

234
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,293
ECONOMIC AGGRESSION LIKE THEY 

235
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:48,062
HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST, 

236
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:50,632
ESPECIALLY IN THE RECENT PAST.

237
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:55,537
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ALMOST AN 

238
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,972
$800 BILLION A YEAR TRADE 

239
00:06:57,972 --> 00:06:58,773
DEFICIT WITH OTHER NATIONS.

240
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:01,176
UNACCEPTABLE.

241
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,245
WE ARE GOING TO START WHITTLING 

242
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:07,048
THAT DOWN AND AS FAST AS 

243
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:07,315
POSSIBLE.

244
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:10,752
WITH THESE GOALS, IT WAS MY 

245
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:13,421
PROFOUND HONOR TO TRAVEL ON THIS

246
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:15,090
JOURNEY AS YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

247
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,158
I EXPLAINED TO ALL OF THE WORLD 

248
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,694
LEADERS AND ACROSS ASIA HOW WELL

249
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:22,631
THE UNITED STATES IS DOING.

250
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:26,101
ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN OVER 3%

251
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,368
THE LAST TWO QUARTERS.

252
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:30,539
AND IT'S GOING HIGHER.

253
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,440
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT ITS LOWEST 

254
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,342
LEVEL IN 17 YEARS.

255
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,444
THE STOCK MARKET HAS GAINED 

256
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:39,347
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN VALUE 

257
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:41,616
SINCE MY ELECTION AND HAS 

258
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:43,618
REACHED RECORD HIGHS.

259
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:46,487
WE ARE MASSIVELY INCREASING OUR 

260
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,990
MILITARY BUDGET TO HISTORIC 

261
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,424
LEVELS.

262
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:51,025
THE HOUSE HAS JUST PASSED A 

263
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,962
NEARLY $700 BILLION DEFENSE 

264
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:55,530
PACKAGE, AND IT COULD NOT COME 

265
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,601
AT A BETTER TIME FOR OUR NATION.

266
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,704
ONCE AGAIN, OUR COUNTRY IS 

267
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,473
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE.

I WANT TO THANK EVERY CITIZEN OF

00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:15,183

CAN THRIVE, FLOURISH, AND 

665
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:19,393

THIS IS A FUTURE WHERE THIS 

669
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,202
VISION, THIS DREAM, IS ONLY 

670
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:30,638
POSSIBLE IF AMERICA IS STRONG, 

671
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:32,640

MR. PRESIDENT?

691
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:06,273
DO YOU BELIEVE -- 

692
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:07,908
>> YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT LEAVING

695
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:13,713
MOORE, THAT EMBATTLED REPUBLICAN

696
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:15,048
SENATE CANDIDATE IN ALABAMA 

697
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:17,384
FACED WITH ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL

698
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:18,385
MISCONDUCT, DATING TEENAGERS 

699
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,287
WHEN HE WAS IN HIS 30s.

700
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,788
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR HIM ON 

701
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:22,789
CAPITOL HILL HAS COLLAPSED.

702
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:23,991
RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT NOT 

703
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:26,293
WANTING TO WEIGH IN ON THAT.

704
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:27,094
WHAT PRESIDENT DID DO IS GIVE A 

705
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:29,363
REPORT ON HIS 13-DAY VISIT TO 

706
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:30,764
ASIA, SAYING THE WORLD SAW A 

707
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:32,766
STRONG, PROUD, AND CONFIDENT 

708
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,834
AMERICA ON THAT TRIP.

709
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,203
HE LAID OUT THE THREE GOALS THAT

710
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,938
HE HAD IN A COUNTRY BY COUNTRY 

711
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,339
REPORT, UNITING THE WORLD 

712
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,874
AGAINST NORTH KOREA, 

713
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:41,608
STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC 

714
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,711
ALLIANCES, AND GETTING FAIR AND 

715
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:44,311
RECIPROCAL TRADE.

716
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:46,013
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 

717
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:48,882
GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANCHOR MARTHA 

718
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:49,316
RADDATZ.

719
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:50,617
REMARKABLE IN A COUPLE WAYS.

720
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,753
NUMBER ONE, A REAL BROADSIDE 

721
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:54,555
AGAINST HIS PREDECESSORS SAYING 

722
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:56,790
ALL OF HIS PREDECESSORS HAD MADE

723
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,959
MISTAKES, NAIVE THINKING, 

724
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,827
MISGUIDED JUDGMENT, NEGLECT.

725
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:02,196
A FAILURE TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE

726
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:03,163
AMERICAN INTERESTS.

727
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,197
THE PRESIDENT ALSO LAID OUT 

728
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:07,034
THOSE GOALS, NOT A LOT OF 

729
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,869
CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL 

730
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:10,203
STEPS TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS.

731
00:24:10,203 --> 00:24:12,473
>> YEAH, A LOT OF TOUGH WORDS 

732
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:12,906
THERE, GEORGE.

733
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,875
AND THE TRIP HAD A LOT OF 

734
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:15,108
DAZZLE.

735
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,277
HE SAID HE WAS WORKING ON 

736
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:17,644
RELATIONSHIPS.

737
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:19,613
WE CAN ALL RECALL THAT HE HAD 

738
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:21,115
KIND WORDS ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN.

739
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:23,684
HE HAD KIND WORDS ABOUT CHINA, 

740
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:26,053
BUT THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING 

741
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:26,654
SUBSTANTIAL DONE.

742
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,155
SO WE HEARD A LOT OF TOUGH 

743
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:28,388
WORDS.

744
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:29,856
WE HEARD ABOUT THIS CONFIDENCE, 

745
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:31,559
BUT IT MADE ME THINK OF THE 

746
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,160
LATEST ABC/"WASHINGTON POST" 

747
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,496
POLL, 60% OF THOSE POLLS DO NOT 

748
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:38,932
TRUST DONALD TRUMP TO ACT 

749
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:41,101
RESPONSIBLY WITH NORTH KOREA.

750
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,236
53% SAY AMERICAN LEADERSHIP HAS 

751
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:44,704
GOTTEN WEAKER UNDER PRESIDENT 

752
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:45,239
TRUMP.

753
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,641
AND WE STILL HAVE THAT LOOMING 

754
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:50,144
PROBLEM OF NORTH KOREA.

755
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:51,445
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED THAT 

756
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:51,845
PROBLEM.

757
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:53,513
IF WE DON'T ALREADY, WE WILL 

758
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:55,649
HAVE A NORTH KOREA CAPABLE OF 

759
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:58,953
PUTTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON ON AN 

760
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:00,521
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 

761
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:02,156
MISSILE, BUT THAT REMAINS A HUGE

762
00:25:02,156 --> 00:25:03,791
PROBLEM AND A HUGE THREAT THAT 

763
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:07,127
IS YET TO BE VOSOLVED.

764
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:08,929
>> ALTHOUGH THE RHETORIC ON 

765
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,631
NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN 

766
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:11,165
TONED DOWN.

767
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:13,000
>> AND NORTH KOREA HASN'T 

768
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,167
LAUNCHED A MISSILE OR HAD TESTS 

769
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:16,003
IN WELL OVER A MONTH.

770
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:17,237
THAT'S SOMETHING EVERYONE IS 

771
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:19,340
LOOKING AT.

772
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,041
THEY'RE NOT SURE WHY THEY THAT 

773
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,309
HAPPENED, BUT THE PRESIDENT ON 

774
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,044
THIS TRIP DID TONE DOWN HIS 

775
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,579
RHETORIC EXCEPT FOR THE ONE 

776
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:30,584
TWEET WHERE HE CALLED JIM 

777
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,786
JONG-UN SHORT AND FAT.

778
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:34,622
>> I WANT TO GO TO MARY BRUCE ON

779
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:34,955
CAPITOL HILL.

780
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:36,590
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT.

781
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,624
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE PRESIDENT 

782
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:39,193
TALK ABOUT ROY MOORE THERE, EVEN

783
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,527
THOUGH HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO 

784
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:42,328
ADDRESS THIS WHEN HE GOT BACK IN

785
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:42,863
THE UNITED STATES.

786
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:44,164
PERHAPS WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM ON 

787
00:25:44,164 --> 00:25:44,564
ANOTHER FRONT.

788
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:46,667
AS I SAID, AS THE PRESIDENT IS 

789
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,736
REFUSING TO SPEAK OUT RIGHT NOW,

790
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:50,471
REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL HAVE

791
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:52,072
COMPLETELY ABANDONED ROY MOORE.

792
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:53,940
>> YEAH, GEORGE, AND IT'S PRETTY

793
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,975
REMARKABLE TO THINK RIGHT NOW, 

794
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:58,345
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE THE 

795
00:25:58,345 --> 00:25:59,113
PRESIDENT STANDS EXACTLY.

796
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:01,181
IN HIS ABSENCE, WE HAVE SEEN A 

797
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:02,449
WAVE OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS 

798
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:03,817
COMING OUT, NOW SAYING THEY 

799
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,051
BELIEVE THAT ROY MOORE SHOULD 

800
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:06,620
DROP OUT OF THE RACE, THAT THE 

801
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,021
ALLEGATIONS IN AND OF THEMSELVES

802
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:09,089
ARE DISQUALIFYING.

803
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:10,991
BUT DOES THE PRESIDENT AGREE 

804
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:11,258
WITH THEM?

805
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:12,893
THAT STILL REMAINS TO BE THE BIG

806
00:26:12,893 --> 00:26:13,160
QUESTION.

807
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,928
AND IT'S WORTH A REMINDER THAT 

808
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:15,895
THE PRESIDENT TAKING A POSITION 

809
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:17,464
ON THIS, IF HE DOES AGREE WITH 

810
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:19,499
REPUBLICAN LEADERS, IS NOT 

811
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:20,500
WITHOUT RISK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW 

812
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,268
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ROY MOORE 

813
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:22,902
IS GOING ANYWHERE.

814
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:24,137
HE HAS BEEN DEFIANT.

815
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:25,406
WOULD HE AGREE?

816
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:26,740
WOULD HE COMPLY WITH THE 

817
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,874
PRESIDENT WERE HE TO CALL FOR 

818
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:28,942
HIM TO DROP OUT?

819
00:26:28,942 --> 00:26:30,677
JUST A SHORT WILE AGO, GEORGE, 

820
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:33,947
ROY MOORE TWEETED AND I QUOTE, 

821
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:34,347
WE WILL NOT QUIT.

822
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:36,450
>> YEAH, ROY MOORE SAY HE'S 

823
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,584
STAYING IN NO MATTER WHAT.

824
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:40,220
THE ELECTION IS SET FOR DECEMBER

825
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,654
12th.

826
00:26:40,654 --> 00:26:42,355
SOME NEW POLLS COMING OUT 

827
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:45,625
SHOWING FOR THE FIRST TIME 

828
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,660
PERHAPS THE DEMOCRAT DOUG JONES 

829
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,293
IS LEADING.

830
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:48,528
