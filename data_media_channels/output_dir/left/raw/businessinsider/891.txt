try to keep situations as calm as

understand how to approach someone such

that they're not creating more tension

than an already<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I also think that</font>

there has to be a recognition among law

important many of the incidents we've

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,930
seen over the last few years the police

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,000
officers are encountering people who are

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,460
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of mental</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> health issue</font>

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,379
police officers and police departments

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,799
have to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better grip on how to</font>

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,680
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> those situations now that being</font>

said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're probably after in police</font>

26
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,210
departments to do too much I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font>

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,950
has to be some collaboration between

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,740
police departments and mental health

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,049
professionals to figure out better ways

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,290
to respond to incidents where people are

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,700
in crisis the other thing I would

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">mention is accountability it's one thing</font>

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know have these incidents on tape</font>

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,600
and to have evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bad things are</font>

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,579
happening between police and community

36
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,040
members it's another thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,590
hold those officers accountable and as

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,990
we've seen a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the frustration and</font>

39
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,810
tension has more to do with the response

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,060
of the judicial<font color="#CCCCCC"> system than it does</font>

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,820
would be the actual incident officers

42
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,100
are not being held accountable in the

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,530
same way that civilians are but there

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,710
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be real consequences and</font>

45
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,860
criminal prosecution is appropriate then

46
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,049
that should be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

47
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,538
police officers have to have to face

48
00:02:08,538 --> 00:00:00,000
just like anyone else
