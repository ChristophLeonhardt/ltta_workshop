00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:15,180
>> Sean: SO AS YOU KNOW BY NOW,

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,116
ROSEANNE BARR TWEETED OUT SOME

3
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:18,918
INAPPROPRIATE OVER-THE-LINE

4
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,754
REMARKS ABOUT VALORIE JARRETT.

5
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:25,457
IN RESPONSE, WE NOW THAT ABC

6
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:26,358
CANCELLED THE REBOOT OF

7
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:27,660
"ROSEANNE."

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,597
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO RESPOND TO

9
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,300
ROSEANNE BARR'S TWEET AND THE

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,768
DOUBLE STANDARD IN THIS COUNTRY

11
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,703
WHERE CONSERVATIVES ARE HELD

12
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,438
ACCOUNTABLE WHILE THOSE ON THE

13
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:42,942
LEFT NEVER SEEM TO FACE

14
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,544
CONSEQUENCES FOR RACISM, BIGOTRY

15
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:47,012
OR SEXISM.

16
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:50,249
THAT'S TONIGHT'S IMPORTANT MINI

17
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:50,649
MONOLOGUE.

18
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,451
WE KNOW THIS WEEK ROSEANNE BARR

19
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,486
RIGHTLY APOLOGIZED FOR HER

20
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:58,624
TERRIBLE COMMENTS ABOUT VALORIE

21
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:58,958
JARRETT.

22
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,225
SHE SAID NOBODY SHOULD DEFEND

23
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:01,694
HER IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED.

24
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,228
SHE WAS RIGHT TO APOLOGIZE.

25
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:04,596
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE HAVE

26
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,198
TO LOOK AT THIS MOMENT AND DO

27
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:07,833
BETTER AS A COUNTRY.

28
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,669
WE HAVE TO RESPECT ALL RACES,

29
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:13,172
ALL CREEDS, ALL BACKGROUND.

30
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,641
ROSEANNE IS A PUBLIC FIGURE AND

31
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,775
HER COMMENTS HURT INNOCENT

32
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,078
PEOPLE AND SHE'S FACING

33
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:19,511
CONSEQUENCES.

34
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,780
SHE CAN SAY IT ON HER OWN TIME

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,416
BUT ABC HAS THEIR OWN DECISION

36
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:24,750
MAKING.

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,651
WE SHOULD FEEL BAD.

38
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,785
A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE LOST

39
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:27,353
THEIR JOBS.

40
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,321
THEY HAVE FAMILIES, MORTGAGES,

41
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,323
RENT PAYMENTS, CAR PAYMENTS AND

42
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:32,291
OTHER EXPENSES.

43
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,692
COLLEGE KIDS TO WORRY ABOUT.

44
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:36,195
OF COURSE, ROSEANNE IS NOT THE

45
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,763
FIRST PUBLIC FIGURE TO MAKE

46
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,198
OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS AND SHE

47
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,300
ADMITS THAT SHE'S BEEN HELD

48
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,168
RIGHTLY ACCOUNTABLE.

49
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,473
SO MANY DESPICABLE COMMENTS AND

50
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,142
ACTIONS ON THE LEFT GO

51
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,744
UNNOTICED, A HUGE DOUBLE

52
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,078
STANDARD.

53
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,714
MANY GET A FREE PASS, INCLUDING

54
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:59,051
A FORMER WRITER THAT IS ON

55
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,285
ROSEANNE'S SHOW.

56
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:00,886
WANDA SYKES.

57
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,222
REMEMBER SHE ANNOUNCED SHE WAS

58
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:06,525
QUITTING THE SHOW TO PROTEST

59
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:07,626
ROSEANNE'S TWEET?

60
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:10,929
SYKES HAS HAD RACIAL TWEETS

61
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:11,864
INCLUDING THIS ONE.

62
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:13,832
WHITE PEOPLE DON'T STEAL

63
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,200
WALLETS, THEY STEAL COUNTRIES.

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,102
SHE NEVER HAD ANY CAREER-ENDING

65
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:19,004
BACKLASH FROM THAT TWEET.

66
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:21,040
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER ABC EMPLOYEE?

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,775
JIMMY KIMMEL.

68
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,443
HE WAS ON COMEDY CENTRAL.

69
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,612
HE DRESSED UP IN BLACK FACE.

70
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,713
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

71
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,615
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY OUT THERE IN

SOMETIME AT NIGHT KARL MALONE

77
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,158
WILL LOOK UP IN THE SKY AND SAY,

78
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,861
WHAT THE HELL GOING ON UP THERE?

79
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:47,199

00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,170
PHONE HOME LIKE ET?

81
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,604
KARL MALONE NEVER SEEN NO FLYING

82
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:53,439
SAUCER HIT THE SHELF.

83
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,377
IF HE DO, THAT WILL BE A SPEAKY

84
00:02:58,377 --> 00:02:58,677
TIME.

85
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,547
>> Sean: ABC'S CEO, BOB IGER

86
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:05,050
PUTS JIMMY KIMMEL ON NIGHT AFTER

87
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,818
NIGHT.

88
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,787
WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT HIS SEXIST

89
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:09,555
SKITS THAT HE DID.

90
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,355
MIGHT REMEMBER THIS.

91
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,557
>> HELLO.

92
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:12,925
WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD.

93
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,359
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SEX

94
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:14,626
ME?

95
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:15,294
>> NO.

96
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:17,963
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SEX?

97
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:19,531

PLEASE?

99
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,233
I'M BEGGING YOU.

100
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,703
I THINK YOU WOULD ENJOY IT.

101
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,939
HIS UNIT IS RELATIVELY SMALL.

102
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,973
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

103
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:31,744
>> GIVES YOU THIS INADEQUACY

104
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,578
THING.

105
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,581
>> OH, MY GOD!

106
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:38,317

00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,820
GUESS WHAT IS IN MY PANTS.

>> GO.

111
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:48,093
>> YOU SHOULD USE TWO HANDS.

112
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,728
TWO HANDS.

113
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:52,664
>> Sean: NO ONE AT ABC, BOB IGER

114
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:57,936
OR DISNEY IS OUTRAGED BY THAT?

115
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:01,140
OF COURSE, YOU HAVE JOY BEHAR.

116
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,143
SHE ATTACKED MIKE PENCE.

117
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:04,443
WHY?

118
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:05,878
BECAUSE OF HIS CHRISTIAN FAITH.

119
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,813
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

120
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,114
>> SHE SAID THAT JESUS TELLS

121
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,449
MIKE PENCE THINGS TO SAY.

122
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:11,784
>> WHEN WAS SHE AROUND MIKE

123
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,786
PENCE THOUGH?

124
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,320
>> OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS AROUND HIM.

125
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,089
WHEN YOU HAVE A MIKE PENCE THAT

126
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,957
PUTS THIS RELIGIOUS VENEER ON

127
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:22,161
THINGS AND CALLS PEOPLE VALUES

128
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,147

00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,532
VOTERS, WE'RE IN A DANGEROUS

131
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:26,899
SITUATION.

132
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,200
I'M CATHOLIC.

133
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,235
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT MY VICE

134
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,905
PRESIDENT SPEAKING IN TONGUES.

135
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,407
>> LIKE HE SAID BEFORE IT'S ONE

136
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,943
THING TO TALK TO JESUS.

137
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,778
IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN JESUS

138
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,879
TALKS TO YOU.

139
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,047
>> EXACTLY.

140
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,782
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

141
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,551
>> THAT'S MENTAL ILLNESS IF I'M

142
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,252
NOT CORRECT.

143
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,254
HEARING VOICES.

144
00:04:49,254 --> 00:04:52,658
>> MY QUESTION IS CAN HE TALK TO

145
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:58,797
MARY MAGDALINE IF SHE'S IN THE

146
00:04:58,797 --> 00:04:59,097
ROOM.

147
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,867
>> Sean: BEHAR STILL WORKS FOR

148
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:02,234
ABC.

149
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,269
SHE WAS FORCED TO APOLOGIZE.

150
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:08,407
AND NEXT UP, KEITH OBERMAN IS

151
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:08,841
BACK.

152
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,845
TRUMP HATING.

153
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,583
BOB REHIRED HIM.

154
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,651
HE TWEETED TELL YOUR RACIST

FATHER TO GET THE BLEEP OUT OF

00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:24,890
OUR SOCIETY.

158
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,126
HE TARGETED JOE ARPAIO SAYING

159
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:31,163
"YOU AND POTUS CAN GO BLEEP

160
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,965
YOURSELVES, YOU RACIST NAZI

161
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:33,298
BLEEP."

162
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,634
YEAH, IGER JUST HIRED HIM TO GO

163
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,301
BACK TO ESPN.

164
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:37,102
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

165
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,239
NOW WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO NBC

JOY REED CAME UNDER FIRE FOR

00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,350
OUTRAGEOUS BLOG POSTS.

172
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,551
SHE CLAIMS WITHOUT PROOF THAT

173
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,853
THE INTERNET HAD BEEN HACKED A

174
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,221
AND THE FIRESTORM GOES AWAY.

177
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:00,959
EXPLANATION.

178

THE SAME AL SHARPTON.

182
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,070
YOU MAY REMEMBER HE SAID ALL OF

183
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,071
THESE THINGS.

184
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,873

00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,042
YOU'RE A PUNK [BLEEP].

LET'S LOOK AT SOMEONE ELSE'S

238
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:41,553
LONG BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE.

239
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,687
THEY HIT THIS PICTURE.

240
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:46,425

00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,729
FARRAKHAN WITH BARACK OBAMA.

243
00:08:50,729 --> 00:09:03,775
GIVENING FARRAKHAN'S RACIST AND

244
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:06,678

00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,681
>> THEY CALL ME HITLER.

250
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:10,749
HITLER WAS A GOOD NAME.

251
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,385
HE WAS A GREAT MAN.

252
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:18,457
THE SATANIC JEWS, THEY CONTROL

253
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,358
EVERYTHING AND MOSTLY EVERYBODY.

254
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,395
>> BECAUSE YOU SEE WHITE PEOPLE

255
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:28,867
DESERVE TO DIE.

256
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,103
AND THEY KNOW, SO THEY THINK

257
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:36,408
IT'S US COMING TO DO.

258
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:40,979
KAW CAUTION MEANS WEAK BLOODED

259
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:44,082
STALE FACE.

260
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:45,784
>> Sean: SO DOES THE MAINSTREAM

262
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:49,221
THAT PERSON OR WERE THE AMERICAN

263
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,388
PEOPLE BEING DECEIVED?

264
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:51,590
THEY HIT THE TWO PEOPLE THERE

265
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,190
TOGETHER.

266
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,260
IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE SCREEN.

267
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,130
AND REVEREND WRIGHT, THE PASTOR

268
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,698

269
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:00,899
LET ME BE CLEAR.

270
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,437
I WILL NEVER EVER CALL FOR ANY

271
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,638
BOYCOTTS OR ANYBODY TO BE FIRED

272
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:11,009
OR SHOW TO BE CANCELLED.

273
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,978
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO TURN THE

274
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:13,278
DIAL.

275
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,682
BUT LET ME POINT OUT A BLATANT

276
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:18,850
LEFT WING STANDARD.

277
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,485
WHO SUMMED IT UP BEST, SARAH

278
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,353
SANDERS WHEN SHE SAID THIS.

279
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:22,754
TAKE A LOOK.

280
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,489
>> THE PRESIDENT'S POINTING TO

281
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,525
THE HYPOCRISY IN THE MEDIA

282
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,326
SAYING THE MOST HORRIBLE THINGS

283
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,861
ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT AND NOBODY

284
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:30,462
ADDRESSES IT.

285
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:40,772
WHERE WAS BOB IGER'S APOLOGY FOR

286
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,175
JOY BEYER CALLING CHRISTIANITY A

287
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:43,875
MENTAL ILLNESS?

288
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,077
WHERE WAS THE APOLOGY FOR KATHY

00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,246
GRIFFIN GOING ON A PROFANE RANT

290
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:50,749
ON "THE VIEW" AFTER A PHOTO

291
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,284
SHOWED HER HOLDING PRESIDENT

292
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,386
TRUMP'S DECAPITATED HEAD?

293
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:58,256
WHERE WAS THE APOLOGY FOR BOB

294
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:02,194

OLBERMAN AND CALLING THE

296
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,098
PRESIDENT A NAZI AND EXPANDING

297
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,600
THAT ATTACK AGAINST THE

298
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,602
PRESIDENT'S FAMILY?

299
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,270
NOBODY HAVE DEFENDING HER

300
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,637
COMMENTS.

301
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:14,472
THEY'RE INAPPROPRIATE BUT THAT'S

302
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:15,574
THE POINT HE WAS MAKING.

303
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,374
>> Sean: WELL-SAID, SARAH

304
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:16,708
SANDERS.

305
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,977
I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

306
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:19,344
MONOLOGUE.

307
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,478
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.

308
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,314
IT'S TIME FOR ALL AMERICANS,

309
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,115
REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICAL

310
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,984
AFFILIATION, YEAH, WE ALL NEED

311
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,285

312
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:29,487
WE ALL NEED TO HOLD HOURSELVES,

313
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,522
OUR FRIENDS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

314
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:31,523
WORDS AND ACTIONS.

315
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,758
WE NEED TO BE 1 NATION, ONE

316
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:34,092
PEOPLE.

317
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,194
THIS COUNTRY WILL SUCCEED OR

318
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:36,995
FAIL TOGETHER.

319
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,897
IF WE'RE ATTACKED, IT'S ALL OF

320
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:39,965
US ATTACKED.

321
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,200
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE UNITED

322
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,968
STATES OF AMERICA.

323
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,570
REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED,

324
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,373
COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN.

325
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,810

00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:54,212

328
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,580
WE CAN ALL DO SO MUCH BETTER.

329
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,748
WE HAVE TO BE THE UNITED STATES

330
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:57,382
OF AMERICA.

331
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,684
SHOULD BE EVERYBODY'S GOAL.

332
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,785
TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND

333
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,954
SACRIFICE FOR ALL OF US TO HAVE

334
00:12:02,954 --> 00:00:00,000
LIBERTY AND FREEDOM AND WE OWE
