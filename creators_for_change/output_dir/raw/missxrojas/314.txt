00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so there's no Rosie answers</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,240
today because I wanted to talk instead

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,740
about something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been on</font>

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,270
my mind for the past few days since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,099
heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and since I got really</font>

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,719
angry when I first heard about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,429
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from which I graduated</font>

8
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,230
this summer the University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Exeter has</font>

9
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,299
its annual safer sex book and this is

10
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">about every single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year where people go</font>

11
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,750
along in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the underwear and the underwear</font>

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,550
is kind of themed to a specific theme

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,859
things like circus and fantasy and that

14
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,449
sort stuff it's a big event I think it's

15
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,710
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest student events in the</font>

16
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,300
UK and it raises a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money for</font>

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">world aids day AIDS awareness AIDS</font>

18
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,410
prevention and also just safer sex

19
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,239
awareness this year however the people

20
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,649
in charge of the event have chosen

21
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,890
tribal as their theme which just I can't

22
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,260
believe was even an option now I loved a

23
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,910
lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

24
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,129
some times when any time you raise a

25
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,450
concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what people were doing</font>

26
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,820
such as blackface some people blacking

27
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,289
up for parties which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

28
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,390
people did with surprising and

29
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,090
terrifying frequency and that it was

30
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">just banter and that I should chill out</font>

31
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,960
and that you know political correctness

32
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone mad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick Russell Howard a</font>

33
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,469
little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has happened again</font>

34
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,730
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger scale they have been</font>

35
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,349
students who are really unhappy with the

36
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,270
theme and are saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a racist</font>

37
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,909
theme and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately you get</font>

38
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,799
larger groups of students thinking that

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,570
racial discussions are a popularity

40
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,030
contest and contingent on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

41
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">people like a Facebook page saying oh</font>

42
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,960
well you just think you're stupid like

43
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,670
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is common sense that this is not a</font>

44
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,710
racist theme we are not racist the

45
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,850
hardest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I've experienced when</font>

46
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,530
talking to people about race is this

47
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,600
immediate defensiveness this idea that

48
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because you're</font>

49
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,200
in your head and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't mean to hurt</font>

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,150
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so everything's fine and</font>

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,560
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else will see it that way that</font>

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,150
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a very nice mental place to</font>

53
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,430
come from but I fully accept that a lot

54
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that I do nowadays without</font>

things that future generations are going

57
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,380
to be in shock that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even do and that</font>

58
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,670
we could even think certain ways and

59
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we could even do certain things so</font>

60
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,970
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that my actions and my</font>

thoughts and my words are in any way in

62
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,439
real criticism is some kind of universe

63

time spanning post-racial post

<font color="#CCCCCC">just completely denying that context you</font>

67
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,939
as well it's a massive issue because the

University of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Exeter is a predominantly</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to feel extremely unhappy about the</font>

racial comments that there

<font color="#E5E5E5">with me for a second let's go back to</font>

77
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,629
18th century enlightenment Europe at

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that time of see people were exploring</font>

79
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,750
around the world and there was this big

move to classify everything when I

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,799
studied<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reminded me of that</font>

language that was used to classify

88
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,750
people as well as animals phone that it

89
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,220
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project of homogeneity it was</font>

90
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,260
lumping people together and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

91

was similarly violent or similarly

uncivilized blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term</font>

98
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,230
tribal itself reminds me a lot of the

99
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,359
way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa</font>

100
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,010
people talk about Africa as there is a

country in<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself and have no care for</font>

102
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,209
the specific countries within it and the

103
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,859
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is a very diverse continent</font>

104
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,269
with lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely different</font>

105
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,250
cultures within it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of because</font>

106
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,450
people don't take the time to think

107
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,609
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just use these stereotypes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">comes in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot with waste theory and I</font>

111
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:26,900
do recommend reading up on the

112
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,549
panopticon and then also reading on

113
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:30,620
fucose<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing spots as well because</font>

114
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,419

they call it in race theory it's not

119
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,560
like Bentham<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Foucault as well picks</font>

120
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,900
up from saying and disciplining the body

121
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,910
without touching the body that sense of

122
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,340
sight and how powerful site is in

123
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,079
disciplining people and ordering people

124
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">and making them function in certain ways</font>

125
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,400
that work to promote this dominant

126
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,930
ideology it's not just a fact of how

127
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people from whatever background the</font>

128
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:00,739
university's accepting or not accepting

129
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,930
or not taking into<font color="#CCCCCC"> account etc etc etc</font>

130
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,120
it's also the fact that tribal whatever

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,349
that supposed to mean has become

132
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,910
something spectacular has become

133
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,250
something weirdly fetishized as well and

134
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,410
also has fit into this very marketable

135
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,449
stereotype that we see in television and

136
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">film and literature and Halloween</font>

137
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,589
costumes a way of talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

138
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,108
people that actively fetishizes and

139
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,719
homogenizes multiple cultures that plays

140
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,090
back into this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whiteness is no</font>

141
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,190
motive and tribal and everything

142
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,500
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that term is other and</font>

143
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,510
it's just so frustrating that people

144
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,340
don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but further than that that</font>

145
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,590
people being dismissed by it and I just

146
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,320
I can't understand what group of people

147
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,419
would think that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an okay thing</font>

148
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,220
to do anyway so basically I've just been

149
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,930
really disappointed about that and it's

150
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,000
got to me because I feel a little

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,070
powerless in the situation and it just

152
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,870
reminds me of how I felt on certain

153
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,250
occasions when I was at University and

154
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same sort of thing would happen and</font>

155
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,699
you're just like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't get it</font>

156
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:57,350
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand why you think this is</font>

157
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,690
