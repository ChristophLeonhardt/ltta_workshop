but I would like to give out for the first time ever on this show you know we're almost near award season now we had the Emmys over the weekend and a month or two we'll get into the film awards I want to give out the not a very serious personal word at the first annual not a very serious person Award for her performance in the fake Brett Kavanaugh allegations that would go to Hawaii Democrat Senator mazie Hirono Maisie come accept your award guess who's perpetuating all of these kinds of actions it's the man in this country and I just want to say to the men in this country just shut up and step up do the right thing for a change okay I'm a little upset by this you know mazie Hirono setting women back hundreds of years where would you like a fainting couch man would you but the man I hate the man and it's all the men's fault it's okay it's okay you're there there there there it's okay step up and do it change for once she says by the way so first of all now all men are assailants or rapists or whatever according to this frivolous woman but then then she says men should step up and and do something good for once for once as though men have never done anything before I would like to point out not not to I I don't really believe in this sort of sexual conflict that mazie Hirono is is bringing up but just to answer her point we know that men have stepped up and done great things before we know this even in recent history the evidence for that is that if American men had not stepped up and acted courageously and done the right thing then mazie Hirono and all of the other American women would be speaking German right now if they were even allowed to speak you know every every great war you know all of the defense of our country running the government starting there there were a lot of I think men have done okay I think they've done okay over time amazing hero knows men men wah-wah-wah-wah all of the arguments by the way that have ever been made all the sexist chauvinistic arguments or that you know women are more prone to be emotional and paint with a broad brush and you know that that's why they can't be in public life and then mazie Hirono just goes that I hate all the men where where where and then but then that actually isn't even the least serious thing she's she's done all day she goes on and someone asks her okay you're saying that these allegations of Brett Kavanaugh against Brett Kavanaugh are are fair they're real we should believe them what could Brett Kavanaugh do to prove them wrong and to exculpate himself here's what she says about men stepping up what if anything could judge Kavanaugh say in this hearing that would convince you that he didn't do what he's accused of he is saying that he didn't do it what else can he say so I set that aside and I look at what dr. Ford is saying and we've all said she makes a very credible claim so nothing you can do nothing what could Kavanaugh do to exculpate himself well he nothing nothing he can't say anything I don't believe anything he said even though he has an unimpeachable career in the public eyes been a judge for 12 years but yeah okay I don't believe anything he said but then a woman who refuses to testify to speak to anybody on the record no witnesses the only witnesses that she can even muster up say it never happened calls it absolutely nuts that's the woman that we have to believe
