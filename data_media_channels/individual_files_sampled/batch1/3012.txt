my name is Garrett fileman I'm a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and my claim to fame is that I was one of the first academically trained economists to take an interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology so as we look into the future and in the you know reward of new bitcoins is reduced from the current 12 and a half down to about six point two five new bitcoins every ten minutes and which will occur around July 2020 every four years that reward gets cut in half eventually get to a point where the nominal number of new bitcoins you were earning for mining Bitcoin becomes quite small now if the price of Bitcoin continues to climb above a hundred thousand per Bitcoin then you know mining a tiny fraction of Bitcoin still is quite lucrative but ultimately the number of new bitcoins come into existence through mining will be cut to zero we'll hit the 21 million limit and the only direct financial incentive left my Bitcoin will be transaction fees and there's an open question as to whether or not the transaction fees will provide a sufficient financial incentive to maintain the kind of computing power the Bitcoin enjoys today which is essential to its security if the you know computational power applied to the Bitcoin network is reduced sufficiently it makes it arguably easier to mount a 51% attack to disrupt the network and so there could be some issues down the road if you know the rewards are not sufficient however there could be reasons for people to want to subsidize the cost of mining if bitcoin continues to be a valuable asset because simply they own a lot of bitcoins so they're willing to lose money on mining to maintain this your network
