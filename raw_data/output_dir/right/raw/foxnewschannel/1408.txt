00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:20,584
HE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN WARNING

10
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:22,953
OF INCOMING GAS ATTACKS AND

11
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,455
STAYING WITH WOUNDED SOLDIERS

12
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:25,489
UNTIL HELP ARRIVED.

13
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:28,592

I WAS VERY -- THEY ASKED ME IF I

21
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:41,005

00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,373
I'M LIKE YES YES YES I WANT TO

00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:43,207
DO THIS STORY.

24
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,575
FIRST OF ALL I LOVE ANIMALS AND

25
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:51,182
A WAR HERO IS EVEN MORE BETTER

26
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,183
AS WE WOULD SAY.

27
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,718
TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE AIMING

28
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:59,790

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,157
SCULPTING.

30
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:02,092

00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:03,527
PHOTOGRAPHS.

33
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,096
I ALSO WANTED TO CAPTURE THAT

34
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:06,931
BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT, THAT COURAGE.

35
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:13,504
YOU KNOW, HIS ABILITY, HIS

36
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:14,805
BRAVERY, HIS ABILITY TO HELP THE

37
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:16,674
TROOPS AT BOTH THE BATTLEFIELD

38
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:17,608
AND AT HOME.

39
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,577
>> SITTING NEXT TO YOU IS THE

40
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:20,377
WAX VERSION OF THIS.

41
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:21,712
TELL US ABOUT THE WORK THAT WENT

42
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,848
INTO GETTING INTO THE FINAL

43
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:24,181
PRODUCT.

44
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,016
>> THERE ARE MANY STAGES IN THE

45
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,550
CASTING PROCESS.

46
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,852
ONCE WE HAVE A MOLD FROM THE

47
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:29,353
ORIGINAL CLAY, THEN WE POUR A

48
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:30,421
WAX INTO THAT MOLD.

49
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,522
AND THEN THERE'S MANY STEPS TILL

50
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:34,191
YOU GET TO THE BRONZE, WHICH IS

51
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,960
AT THE VETERANS PARK.

52
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,761
THIS IS THE WAX.

53
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:39,830
WE MADE IT SPECIALLY TO SHOW

54
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,097
YOU.

55
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,832
ARTHEL: YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS

56
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,534
BEAUTIFUL JUST IN WAX FORM.

57
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,336
AND YOU MAKE IT SEEM SO EASY,

58
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:48,305
BUT I MEAN, LIKE HOW MANY HOURS,

59
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:49,039
WEEKS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

60
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,673
WORK GOES INTO THIS

61
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:51,342
>> IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS TO DO

62
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:52,209
ALL THE PROPER RESEARCH AND THEN

63
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:55,412
TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE PHYSICAL

64
00:01:55,412 --> 00:01:56,947
CHARACTERISTICS AND THEN TRY TO,

65
00:01:56,947 --> 00:02:00,017
YOU KNOW, BRING THE SOUL OF THAT

66
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,752
ANIMAL SOMEHOW INTO THAT WORK,

67
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:04,288
AND THEN WHEN IT'S ALL DONE,

68
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:06,257
HOPEFULLY YOU CAN TAKE A DEEP

69
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:09,592
BREATH AND HOPEFULLY FOR

70
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:10,895
GENERATIONS TO COME, HONOR AND

71
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,631
JUSTICE TO OUR MILITARY, HUMAN

72
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:14,665
AND ANIMAL KIND.

73
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:18,469
>> ABSOLUTELY.

74
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:20,437
WHAT EMOTION DOS YOU HOPE TO

75
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:22,172
EVOKE -- WHAT EMOTIONS DO YOU

76
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:23,507
HOPE TO EVOKE FROM PEOPLE WHEN

77
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,175
THEY VISIT THE SCULPTURE?

78
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:27,211
>>I WANT THEM TO FEEL PRIDE,

79
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:27,611
INSPIRATION.

80
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,879
I WANT THEM TO FEEL THAT BOY IF

81
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,314
A DOG COULD DO THAT, I THINK I

82
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:32,249
COULD DO THAT THING THAT I NEED

83
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:33,517
TO DO.

84
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:34,618
AND I THINK I WANT US TO TREAT

85
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:38,756
OUR ANIMALS WELL, RESPECT THEM.

86
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,557
OUR WAR ANIMALS OF ALL DIFFERENT

87
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:40,858
KINDS.

88
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:43,093
YOU KNOW, OUR HORSES, OUR MULES,

89
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:45,496
OUR DONKEYS, OUR PIGEONS, ALL

90
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:46,430
THESE ANIMALS SERVED.

91
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,332
SO I WANT TO HONOR THEIR DEEDS

92
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:49,800
AND THEIR SACRIFICES.

93
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,169
ARTHEL: THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST

94
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,938
MILITARY DOG THAT YOU HAVE

95
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:54,438
MEMORIALIZED.

96
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:56,340
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE EXAMPLES

97
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,640

98
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,909

YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST A SMALL

104
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:10,654
VERSION.

105
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:11,889
OF COURSE IT IS IN LIFE SIZE.

106
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,557
ARTHEL: SURE.

107
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:15,359
>> AND THEN THIS PIECE IS SMOKY.

108
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,396
THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE 4 POUND

109
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:20,331
YORKSHIRE TERRIER WHO WAS

110
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,100
RESCUED FROM A FOXHOLE IN NEW

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,435
GUINEA WHO WAS THEN TRAINED TO

112
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:26,503
DO 200 TRICKS TO CHEER UP THE

113
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:26,837
TROOPS.

114
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,272
SHE'S OFTEN CALLED THE FIRST

00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:32,142
THERAPY DOG ON RECORD.

116
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,210
AND ACTUALLY CHARLES MAYO WAS

117
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,678
THE ONE WHO SAID I THINK THAT'S

118
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:36,914
A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE ON THE

119
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:38,048
GROUNDS WHEN HER OWNER WAS IN

120
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,183
THE HOSPITAL AND THEY CHEERED UP

121
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,050
THE TROOPS.

122
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,585
AND THAT'S WHO SHE IS.

00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:50,194
SIZED BECAUSE YOU HAVE HER

126
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,395
INSIDE OF A HELMET.

127
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:55,232
>> YES, THEY DID EVERYTHING IN A

128
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:55,899
HELMET.

129
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,034
ARTHEL: I KNOW YOU SAID YOU DO

130
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,802

THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE.

135
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:07,778
YOU KNOW, BUT HOW DID YOU START

136
00:04:07,778 --> 00:04:08,379
ON THIS JOURNEY?

137
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,415
>> WELL, I STARTED BECAUSE I

138
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:13,117
ALWAYS LOVE DOGS AND I USED TO

139
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,084
SHOW THEM.

140
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,619
AND I MET A DOCTOR WHO SAW MY

141
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:16,853
WORK AND SAID SUSAN YOU HAVE TO

142
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:17,654
APPLY FOR THIS COMMISSION AND

143
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,856
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE BECAUSE

144
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,858
THEN I GOT TO REALLY MEET PEOPLE

145
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,559
IN THE MILITARY AND UNDERSTAND

146
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,762
MORE ABOUT THEIR SACRIFICE AND

147
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:26,430
IT LED TO MANY MONUMENTS.

148
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:36,740
I DID ONE OF THE LATE DOG WHO

149
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:45,849
SERVED AND SACRIFICED FOR US.

150
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,719
ARTHEL: HIS MILITARY COMPANION

151
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,388
WAS ROBERT J. CONROY, AN ARMY

152
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:51,755

00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:56,794
TO DO THIS, THIS HONOR.

157
00:04:56,794 --> 00:05:04,234
SO WE CAPTURED HIM IN A

158
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,804
SALUTE -- SALUTE BECAUSE HE WAS

159
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,072
SMUGGLED ABOARD A SHIP WHEN THE

160
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:09,606
COMMANDER FOUND HIM OUT, HE DID

161
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:10,941
A TRIP THAT CONROY TAUGHT HIM,

162
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:16,280
HE RAISED HIS PAW AND HE DID A

163
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,613
SALUTE.

164
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,148
ONCE HE DID THAT, HE WAS IN.

00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,450
HE WAS ON 17 BATTLEFIELDS.

166
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,517
AS YOU SAID HE DID SO MUCH.

167
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:24,922
I WANTED TO CAPTURE HIM IN THAT
