00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
I've had quite a few comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,780
past year saying that when I do my

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,759
videos in front of this background it's

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,130
a bit more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sterile environment in</font>

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,769
the sense that it's not as natural as

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,480
when I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do videos carrying the</font>

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,890
camera about so keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in mind</font>

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,480
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just going behind my desk</font>

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,609
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about ownership</font>

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,260
it could be said that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,939
possessions you have the more success

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,580
we've been and<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind me here is a huge</font>

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,710
collection although I'm sure lots of up

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,810
who have got a much bigger collection of

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,540
music are used to love buying CDs

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,370
because I still love the<font color="#E5E5E5"> artwork and the</font>

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,230
packaging great example here of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,760
favorite band fear factory with their

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,760
album archetype used to unfold a nice

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,290
thing that was really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool but</font>

21
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,250
next to my music dvds<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to like</font>

22
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,829
sharing DVDs with my friends of things

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,570
that gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleasure so if there was a</font>

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,730
movie I saw that I really liked like

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,039
donnie darko which is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my all-time</font>

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,949
favorite movies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to like owning it</font>

27
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,359
so I could then give it to my friends

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,070
and let them have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same experience</font>

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,809
that idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course it takes up</font>

30
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,729
space it costs lots of money and then

31
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,320
blu-ray came out so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean I</font>

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,060
have to start buying everything again

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,040
and finally down here I've got books

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,799
some of which I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not read but a</font>

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,450
great example of a book is one I bought

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,280
a primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> school by Matthew Thomas</font>

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,340
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and after and it was about</font>

38
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,920
exploding sheep I actually never got

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,600
around to reading it still here his

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,759
ownership beneficial music now you have

41
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,570
spotify which for 999 a month I get

42
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,820
access to unlimited content in terms of

43
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,560
movies and that you have love films or I

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,869
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the u.s. you have netflix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

45
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,000
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to own physical copies of</font>

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,250
things anymore you pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usage of</font>

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,079
enjoying the music enjoying the movies

48
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,630
without having to store it physically in

49
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,600
your house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with books you know a lot</font>

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these I don't read anymore or will</font>

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">never read so surely I should take them</font>

52
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,140
to a charity shop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want to</font>

53
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,060
read a book I can either get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,130
or if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it in physical format I</font>

55
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,439
could get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a library it doesn't</font>

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,210
end here though let's go upstairs shirts

57
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,780
more shirts and more t-shirts

58
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,180
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> t-shirts that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't worn it in</font>

59
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,940
so long<font color="#E5E5E5"> then coming over here hoodies I</font>

60
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't worn for ages just shirts I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wear this shirt and this another shirt I</font>

63
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,420

64
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,790
that I've still got it here I own this

65
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,260
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't get rid of it because</font>

66
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,900
I always feel what if I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it one day</font>

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,270
what if it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in use and i even have</font>

68
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,640
drawers of complete random stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,739
don't use anymore look cool watch i got

70
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,690
from turkey many years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've missed</font>

71
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,380
this but yeah lots of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally</font>

72
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,959
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about of my car our</font>

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,780
Flopsy you're gonna be short sight in

74
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,830
one eye and so finding my car one of the

75
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,750
greatest forms of ownership but with

76
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,459
having a car there are so many problems

77
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,769
you have to find a parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> space it</font>

78
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,660
means you can get fined or you have to

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,750
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for parking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be involved in</font>

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,989
road accidents as congestion pollution

81
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,390
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something breaks you have to fix it</font>

82
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,030
loads of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems and I guess</font>

83
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,829
whenever a product is first released

84
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,750
it's usually for its utility what it's

85
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,380
used for but then due to society and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

86
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,390
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's evolved it's now about once and</font>

87
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,190
not so much needs so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to have</font>

88
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,350
cars that look amazing people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

89
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,540
drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> around fast in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their cars when we</font>

90
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,000
talk about ownership and businesses that

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,790
create these products like music CDs<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

92
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,010
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> model for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any company willing</font>

93
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,170
to make profit is to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

94
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,350
everyone buys as much as they can so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,150
business model<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the car industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

96
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,329
that everyone on this planet should own

97
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,299
a car but I mean yeah everyone on this

98
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,950
planet should have the right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

99
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,140
to travel faster than foot but should

100
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,000
everyone really own a car I mean do we

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,260
have the infrastructure to deal with

102
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,150
that I mean if you go to like an airport

103
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,430
and you see all the car parks where

104
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,690
people have left<font color="#E5E5E5"> their cars while they</font>

105
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,660
go on vacation it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

106
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,730
ridiculous there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently over 500</font>

107
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,890
million cars in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world is it really</font>

108
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,168
possible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to own a car but</font>

109
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,970
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to allow everyone to have</font>

110
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,409
access to the utility of transport like

111
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,710
with music I have a program

112
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,270
like Spotify it means I don't have to

113
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,160
store the CDs I don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,289
buy them that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the access is at</font>

115
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,750
my fingertips that's technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for</font>

116
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,430
good but with cars we have automated

117
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,319
transport and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not being</font>

118
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,060
used yet is because it would put a lot

119
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,710
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business the people</font>

120
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacture cars the service</font>

121
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,180
industry I mean if your car can tell you

122
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oil needs changing surely the</font>

123
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,039
car is able to change the oil itself but

124
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,539
allowing everyone to have access for

125
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,660
everything you may say well surely that

126
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,970
is even more inefficient surely that

127
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,770
will use more resources let's say you

128
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,930
wanted to travel somewhere so you dial

129
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,699
up for a car to pick you up so this

130
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,139
automated car takes you to where you

131
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to go and picks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the next person</font>

132
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,729
and so on less cars would be needed on

133
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the road therefore there be less</font>

134
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,099
pollution less congestion<font color="#E5E5E5"> 93% I think</font>

135
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,870
it's a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all road</font>

136
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,849
accidents happen due to human error you

137
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,620
would eradicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer an</font>

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,300
issue have been too young to drive or

139
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,310
maybe being elderly or even being drunk

140
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,520
these people are catered for and are

141
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,830
taken in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quickest and most effective</font>

142
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,620
way I mean today we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

143
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,389
money in the world to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

144
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,400
everyone in society the things they<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

145
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> progress in the right</font>

146
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,330
direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we do have the resources</font>

147
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,960
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that makes me think</font>

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
where are we going wrong surely the

149
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,729
ownership could become a thing of the

150
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,979
past I just know the moment i get rid of

151
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,500
those books i get rid of the cds and the

152
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,389
dvds and the clothes that I don't wear

153
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,430
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to feel a hell of a lot</font>

154
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,949
better I need a good clear out but with
