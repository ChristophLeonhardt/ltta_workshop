lot about them and he's gonna protect them from Democrats now later in this clip I am going to explain how Donald Trump has put those programs in jeopardy single handily done that but before I get to it I want to provide some evidence of what Trump has said on the record about these very programs take a look but there's no administration probably and even you folks have generally acknowledges that has done more work when you look at tax cuts if you look at the health care programs that we're passing and all of the things we've done we're saving Social Security the Democrats will destroy Social Security we're saving Medicare that Democrats want to destroy Medicare you look at what they're doing they're going to destroy Medicare and we will save it we will keep it going we're making it stronger we're making Social Security stronger we're making our whole country stronger clown pathological liar he says now all of you would know this in reality no they don't you've done nothing to help Social Security we're gonna get into that in a second but who thinks that the Democrats are trying to destroy Social Security and what do you base that on like if you base it on some saying that for example when Obama offered up a grand bargain to the Republicans and it would have cut Social Security a little bit now that's a thing that was real and we criticized them vociferously at the time etc but generally speaking Democrats try to protect Social Security and Medicare and Republicans talked non-stop about what they call entitlement reform which means cutting Social Security and Medicare but in this guy use like everybody knows I'm protecting it by doing what and if Democrats are trying to destroy it by doing what under your watch what did they do to try to destroy so scare it doesn't matter I'm just gonna make it a make up stuff non-stop non-stop does it not matter to Trump in in providing evidence but it doesn't matter to his base you know the RNC had this poll that honestly put them in a bit of a panic because Trump's base believes everything that he says and so even though all the evidence indicates that Democrats are going to take over the house Trump keeps saying no there's no blue wait there's a red wave don't worry there's a red wave and so the voters are like oh okay yeah there's gonna be a red wave we're not gonna go vote everything's fine this is yeah that's a really interesting poll the Republicans did the poll and they're trying to get Trump to stop saying things that aren't true about how the Republicans are gonna win the election because it they're polling shows their own voters are like I'm not going out to vote because we got this thing on lockdown yeah it's crumbs talking about a red wave right and so they're like no stop saying that that isn't true the Democrats are up by nine points in a generic poll across the country in these congressional seats we're gonna get killed out there that's a red wedding not a red way exactly and a years ago we got this is a red way if they're like oh yeah I mean just today he said in another interview the Democrats know that their mother investigation has been discredited they acknowledge it they know they say it no they don't they've never said that you just made that up yeah it's like if this person was in your real life you'd pull your hair out like if he was your boss you'd quit if he was you know in your family you'd banish him but we can't banish him he's the president yeah yeah so now getting back to Social Security and Medicare if you look at the numbers you'll see that look these programs were already suffering because of a lack of revenue that we're bringing in tax cuts corporate tax loopholes you get the picture but the situation has gotten a lot worse under Trump because he has further cut taxes for the wealthy so the old-age and survivors fund which is part of Social Security will begin paying out more than it takes in in fiscal year 2022 from there the funds 2.8 trillion dollar reserves will be gone by 2034 now how Trump is you know exacerbated the problem okay so and that's based on the the tax cuts so by the way this isn't just based on us it's based on what Steve minuchin has said as well so Treasury secretary Steve minuchin argues or acknowledges that monthly checks to tens of millions of Americans will have to be slashed 21 percent in 2012 30 4 unless something is done when Trump took office the insolvency date was 2035 so cutting the taxes has only sped up the process of making the fund insolvent and by the way all of us are still getting taxed for Social Security all of us so keep in mind that if we keep going at this rate we're not gonna see that money that we've paid into this program and it's devastating so the report from minuchin and the other trustees blames a series of steps that have reduced money coming in the tax cut law lower lower than expected wage increases this is a report that minuchin is involved in and they're acknowledging that the tax cuts have hurt this program and more importantly that the wages have not increased the way that they had expected and also Trump's killing of daca which has allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants to live and work here legally so daca recipients were paying into the system now many of them are being deported and so as a result like that also contributes not as it also contributes to a lack of revenue but not to the same extent as tax cuts have yeah so the Medicare solvency has also been shrunk a it was said to be solvent as late as 2029 but since Trump is got gone into office it is now said to be insolvent in 2026 that's three years earlier than it would have and the two major factors by far are the two that animation mentioned tax cuts for the rich has depleted our revenue for the federal government and and low-wage so people are taxed less in general if they make less and so that leads to less revenue for the government less money for Social Security and Medicare so now look there's two different proposals for how to fix that generally speaking this has got more details but one side says let's just cut Social Security or Medicare now and that'll help their solvency I don't see how that solves anything so wait instead of cutting it 20 years from now let's cut it today that doesn't solve it that does the exact opposite that's the Republican plan the Democratic plan or the progressive plan is no you know you payroll taxes are capped at I think it's around one hundred and twenty thousand dollars why don't why are we capping it why don't we just let everybody pay the same percentage no matter what their income is it's a regressive tax the middle class and the and the poor pay a higher percentage of their income then the rich - it makes no sense so if you actually make that even you solve the problem entirely so that would be the right thing to do but instead of course Donald Trump as usual has gone in the exact opposite direction while claiming that he fixed it yeah it's scary it's scary because right now you know especially under Trump's administration nothing's gonna be done to solve this problem but even when Democrats are in charge I feel like they're unwilling to do anything because it's unpopular it's unpopular to raise taxes it's unpopular especially among the wealthy and the elite to get rid of that cap on payroll taxes well it looks - to be fair earlier and for most of my life as I was covering politics it was relatively unpopular to raise taxes these days it actually is no longer unpopular because we've cut them to the bone and we've cut them predominantly for the rich in corporations so it now pulls actually relatively well to raise taxes on the rich and what the payroll tax increase would do is hey you guys if you're making less than $120,000 you're still gonna pay the same exact thing it's not gonna raise your taxes by a cent it's only raises taxes on people making over $120,000 my guess is given that Social Security polls at 84% Medicare polls at 77% but that would be an enormously popular tax increase in that particular case but the reason Democrats don't do it is because that would affect their donors or all making above one hundred and twenty thousand dollars so that's why Obama also over there offered to cut Social Security preemptively yeah yeah let's not forget that yeah so look unlike the other folks that you see all across media we try our best to be fair so we call it up Obama when he wanted to cut Social Security and we're calling out Trump when he makes these preposterous claims about how he helps Social Security when he did no such thing and in fact he did the opposite on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to t whitey at our new
