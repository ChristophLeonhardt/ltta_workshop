this is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder by administration other nerve agents it is now clear that mr. scrapple and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent other type developed by Russia this was attempted murder in the most cruel and public way if Russia is behind us this is a brazen act of war the government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei can we just stop Russia today broadcasting its propaganda we need to continue seeking a robust dialogue with Russia rather than simply cutting off contact and letting the tensions and divisions get worse and potentially even more dangerous they got into a midnight tonight to clear up the matter Russia used radiological substances in its barbaric assault on mr. Lipton yanker there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of mr. skipper and his daughter and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury including Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey the United Kingdom will now expel 23 Russian diplomats who have been identified as undeclared intelligence officers welcome to you're going underground special on a historic day for London Moscow relations in the wake of the atrocity in Wiltshire in the southwest of England in a moment we'll hear from the chair of politics society and political journalism at the University of Sheffield professor Pierce Robinson but now I'm joined by broadcaster and former Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament Leben OPIC Nemec let's just start with there what you thought of Gerais Amaze performance in the burst view hours in Parliament it was let's use the going word today robust she made it absolutely clear that she's pointing the finger of blame for the incident in Salisbury at Russia and not just at Russia but at the Russian state she left no doubt at all that she's made her judgment a point when we still haven't had any legal investigation no formal inquiry but quite clearly the Prime Minister and her advisors have decided this is the time to take on Putin directly and try to provoke some kind of either a justification a confession or a denial the national security state getting more efficient than when the atrocity happened in Mayfair in central London because Jeremy Corbyn from him and his spokespeople they still seem to be expressing some doubts over WMD use yes well there's a big schism going on in British politics now on the one side you've got the government and some Labour MPs saying well Russia's to blame take our tea off air let's get the sanctions going and then you've got a more cautious Jeremy Corbyn whose spokesperson previously said and I think Corbin's back this up well this is a time to build our relationship with Russia rather than simply to condemn Russia as guilty for this crime that we can assume it was a crime I think that that's undisputable but to simply say we know enough now to take the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the Russian embassy as a proportionate response is is more than Corbin would have done and I think many other people who would also be concerned that we're compromising the rule of law and the concept of innocent until proven guilty in the interests of political expedience obviously it's the security services that are doing the talking and at least RT this channel hasn't been mentioned even by that Labour MP we heard from who's been on this show I should say who's been previously calling for us to be bad probably not helped them by cuts austerity cuts in our diplomatic services well there's the debate about whether Britain is adequately equipped in diplomatic terms and the suggestion has been particularly from people like Corbin that those cuts are causing harm because it's compromising the ability to have the very kind of dialogue that could prevent these kinds of escalating tensions and first place but then there's another kind of austerity going on the chemical biological radiological and nuclear or CB RN regiment which was previously commissioned to deal with exactly this kind of situation has been cut back that's in my view a very valid criticism may know we're really talking about there let me just stop there for a second we're now joined from the German capital Berlin where with the chair of politics society political journalism at the University of Sheffield professor piers Robinson PS or we can hear me okay you don't I mean what did you think of MPs slamming Jeremy Corbyn for appeasement on this whole Russia debacle well III think caution and looking for the evidence and trying to establish the truth behind what happened and the truth behind this novel schockner evasion is absolutely essential at this point in time and you know just going back in into recent history we've been here before where British government has made very bold certain claims of course in a run-up to the Iraq war with respect to weapons of mass destruction and as we know now after years of inquiries and research into it we know that information and intelligence was manipulated and distorted and was used to present her Iraq as a much greater threat than it actually was so we've been here before where statements bold statements have been made of certainty about banned weapons is that absolutely reasonable and sensible but just that time doesn't mean that we can never believe a British government again when it's told by the security services of this country that that a country a state has murdered people on our soil surely we know the lessons from Iraq tell us that information can get distorted especially in the realm of high politics and when there are high stakes and there is no reason not to least entertain a possibility that that is something which is occurring here so in this situation what we need to do okay is not simply to accept what we're being told and believe what we're being told as we did in a run-up to the Iraq war and we all know how that ended up we need to actually start questioning scrutinizing and drilling down in order to test the claims which are being made that's the job of Parliament that's the job of citizens in a democracy it's not something to believe what you're being told is to question your government then bids very bottom of ages is it's particularly liable to groupthink now yes I think your analysis is absolutely right here I remember being pariah for opposing the war in Iraq for having the audacity to agree with my then leader in the Lib Dems Charles Kennedy who said that this war was being conducted on a false prospect practice of course what we now know is that was completely true it's interesting how you and Charles Kennedy and Jeremy Corbyn know more than the security services of this country and and as it turned out a rogue taxi driver in Iraq from information exactly the right question the security services probably did know the truth and they probably did advise over then well in my opinion I'm expressing my opinion and my view they did advise Tony Blair actually I would challenge that and I think that retrospectively we can see that the security services were more cautious than the politicians but where it goes wrong is when there's a political expedience at stake there was clearly that going on under Tony Blair when he decided to support America with the in my view unjustified incursion into Iraq and it's quite possible we're seeing history repeating itself now with the finger of accusation being pointed towards Russia without any substantive evidence being shared with the public okay well I mean Pierce do you accept this claim from Russia that under the OPCW treaty they should have actually given a 10-day deadline not a 24-hour one and and why is this Navi chalk not listed in OPCW perhaps because it's too complicated a chemical weapon oh I think that's the million dollar question is why does the OPCW not have another truck listed why are these questions I mean his report from Robin black which was written in 2016 which is very recently which states that there's no independent confirmation the structures are the properties of this Nava choc nerve agent and given that I mean the OPCW should know these things it should be a listed it should be a scheduled compound and if that's not the case then we really have to start asking the questions as to exactly what is this what where it comes from the actual process through which it has come to be understood as an actual nerve agent which is being used because that throws up all sorts of questions what the OPCW says and what robin black said and this is a time to ask the questions we've been here not to go on about iraq but we've been here we're in informants defectors have passed information to the intelligence services and then that has been seized upon and it's been used to exaggerate in that case the threat from Iraq especially yeah obviously Britain is concurrently still there in a war in in Iraq what about Syria because this story in Wiltshire is moved Syria off the front pages something apparently is still going on in guchi I mean the Russians are saying that it's is the UK linked Islamists of gucchy that he have the chemical weapons linked by al-nusrah obviously to the government here in government funding I I think it is extremely important for everyone Parliament and the British public to start to understand what is going on at the moment in a broader geopolitical context and you're absolutely right to highlight the issue of Syria here the West at this point in time appears to be facing strategic failure in Syria in terms of the military operations and the attempts to overthrow the Assad regime and what we're beginning to see in the city indications coming out of the areas which this Syrian Arab army have moved into for example fines of chlorine which have been held by the rebel groups now of course we've had this constant political charge but it's constant charge being leveled at and Russian government and the Assad regime for the use of banned weapons in a Syrian conflict but we know that the rebels have been using them as well arguably some might say we argue we don't know about the weapons there and we don't know about the weapons in wiltshire would you go so far I said no would you go so far as saying that Mohammed bin Salman is visit here in London I mean this this sounds crazy to ask but he's on his way to Washington and this is part all this side of things are part of a war with Iran and of course Russia would be dragged into any kind of configuration of that kind well if you want to look at Western policy from policy over the last 16 17 years and this was confirmed by the Chilcott report there's been a series of attempts to change regimes to engage in overt and covert operations Iran was listed in the Chilkoot report Iran was and Syria were mentioned in conversations between George Bush and Tony Blair were now discussing when to hit various countries and I think if we sort of step back a little bit and look at the broad contours of the last 17 years we can see Western military operations and regime change operations pointing towards or ultimately the end goal from according to some people being Iran and yes we might well be seeing this as part of a broader attempt to try to corner to try and pressure Russia in the context of the West either trying to persist with its military strategy of hope of what they want to do perhaps end up with Iran and this is all part of that broader drive it's a propaganda drive to enable further conflict and further military engagement possibly ending in Iran and and this is extremely dangerous territory to be in this is this is you know running us down the road towards a potential confrontation with Russia in the Middle East and this is something again that politicians in Parliament and British public's should be thinking about when we are focusing upon the events and Solsbury we should also be thinking about how despite be relating to a broader drive to demonize Russia and possibly take us to a point of military confrontation certainly in Syria with Russia and this is none of us is to be taken lightly this is a time for calm serious deliberation calm heads and I have to admit I'm not hearing much of that from what I was hearing in the Commons today well Lambert the Ministry of Defense is telling this program - it's referring us to the Chilkoot inquiry as regards any of allegations like this you were nodding while professor PS Robertson was speaking there you can't seriously compare what is happening in the sleepy Salisbury town with all of this massive geopolitical gameplay but that's exactly forget exactly how piers has rightly described it and the elements in why this is so dangerous let's get back to two core facts here no one has yet shared any conclusive evidence to connect the Russian state with the Salisbury attack it was an attack that's a really central page I think she doesn't use the attack because of a because of NATO I got to tell you the Prime Minister says there is no alternative conclusion other than that the russian state was culpable for the attempted murder and for threatening the lives of other UK so so there is no other alternative reason they don't use the word attack is because of the connotations for nato but that's unambiguous and as you have rightly pointed out there's no doubt what the prime minister is saying here's a second fact and piers is rightly pointed out that for that second bag right now professor piers Robertson thank you after the break we'll be joined in this special episode of going underground by the chairman of Britain's oldest conservative think-tank the Bo group Ben Harris Quinny welcome back I'm still here with broadcaster let me go pick in this special episode of going underground reacting to UK Prime Minister Troy's amazed decision to give 23 Russian diplomats a week to get out of the country we're also joined by Ben Harris Quinny he's the chairman of the UK's oldest conservative think-tank the bow group welcome back to you and welcome to you Ben you think Drazen May is done nearly enough to address this atrocity in southwestern England well it's nothing I I think that we didn't expect it's the usual procedural by-the-numbers approach and I think in the last week what we've what we've seen is some very interesting foreign policy developments as the result of non-traditional approaches I'm talking about Trump career diplomat well what I would have done I think is presented more information to the public and invited the Russians as Theresa May did to to comment on that and then if the response was unsatisfactory I think I would have separated this issue from what we've seen in the past on Russia Syria Crimea stuff that really had nothing to do with Britain and made the point that this is different because a British police officer has been injured and approached in that way and then take perhaps harsher measures if Russia wasn't forthcoming with an answer or you think I know I interrupted you with it the fact that - it was back to your politics but it's relevant to this it's the problem here that Theresa May has issued an ultimatum which if it's ignored she really hasn't got a stick to hit Russia with in other words she has now created for herself a problem which Russia can simply ride out and further undermine to his amazing abilities a strong leader well I don't think it's a problem for Theresa May but I also don't think it will see any shift in the position which is really what we're talking about you know Donald Trump's approach was very unusual we had all of the commentators saying that this is extremely dangerous we're gonna have World War 3 and actually it's all of Korea so yes and so this sort of cedral we're going we're not going to attend the World Cup we're going to send home 23 diplomats that it's not gonna make any difference to either arguably the world shop would make it we're not we're not we're not boycotting the World Cup as a football team we're not sending ministers I mean who cares if there's a minister at the World Cup I'm sure the rice I don't think anyone in Britain caffeine is laughable yeah but should England be there would that make a big no III think England the football team should be there because the World Cup has nothing to do with what's what's going on with with this poisoning that the World Cup is a football tournament that's you're respecting the old bow group history of South Africa they're a bit there some words they would well yeah I believe people in Britain I'd certainly realize the importance of this atrocity yes but I don't I don't think that this should be allowed to overlap into sports but the the procedural response that Theresa May is engaged in as you say is not going to shift Russian policy I think and I think but I think there's a bit more important point it's it's not going to shift the declining relations between the UK and Russia that's this is my issue and I've made this point already on the program that the evidence is shaky there may be evidence but I haven't seen it the public hasn't seen it we've been told that amber rod and that the Prime Minister have seen it and we haven't seen the evidence either I think the British public should have been availed of the information that the UK government is apparently acting on I don't think there's any national stage national security considerations as she said also about the outcome of the Litvinenko public inquiry these are far too secret for the British public to comprehend like a flea I would completely disagree with that I think if you're gonna if you're good well I I think when you're talking about the use of nerd nerve agents by a foreign government those sorts of excuses for not revealing why the UK government is taking the action it is taking leads to suspicion because agreeing writers and mi5 is just next door and obviously they're not with a pretty an interview here up what do you think about though they have evidence that they can tell us this is exactly the point Ben's making exactly the point that has to be made and it has to be made repeatedly because it's being ignored by the government we as citizens how in a free country I thought have the right to expect the government to justify this tremendously provocative measure against Russia well then isn't saying that matters you're saying why now believe you now believe the security services I'm saying on the balance of the evidence that this was of course a Russian spy that was that was targeted the nerve agent was extremely complex there are only a few number of states that could produce such a thing one of 16 states right but but you know you've got to consider also the the motive so I think there is certainly there is certainly evidence that would point one towards Russia but clearly the UK government is saying and we have all this evidence that you can't possibly see well I think this waited and you didn't support the Iraq war you could see through that how come you agree were to resume when she says there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian stage was was culpable well I don't agree that there is no other conclusion I agree that the the evidence has to be laid bare my point is that if the all of the evidence does indeed point to Russian intervention then serious measures need to be taken so this is where I would differ from a Jeremy Corbyn saying well you know we should really be moving towards war or anything like that I think and I'm not really wants no no one's calling for war what call calling the cyber warfare actually the threat of a cyber attack which is pretty dangerous because I reckon Russians know quite a lot about that too they want to escalate it that's a very good way of doing it but what Corbin seems to be saying is let's just hold off he's saying a little bit like you've said that so we need to be careful here get the evidence out which is what we're both saying and then act accordingly whereas what to his amaze done is he's he's jump the gun she said the finger of blame is pointing at Russia and now we have to act which means that she's excluded two or three diplomatic steps it simply serves to worsen our relationship well I think the diplomatic steps are the problem jeremy corbyn's past record indicates that you know he is a peacenik by any estimation it's joy whereas whereas Lavra yes whereas whereas I'm a realist I'm not a neoliberal interventionist I don't believe we should be traipsing across the world getting involved in conflicts where we have no business but when it comes to the injury the serious injury of the British Sisters and I think we do have business I think what is we do have visits to find out who it is and resume says we know who it is yes I think I would come back on Lambert's point though that you know we should wait and wait and wait I think the fact that there has been serious injuries through a British citizen and also that there is genuine feeling in the British public at large that something should be done about this present some urgency I'm just saying that the the methods that Teresa may are using are old and tired and point to that deferential age where we the public were told that the state has all the information and they can possibly be told 19th century stuff but okay if you're is some fan of the Donald Trump new realpolitik you're not seriously saying oh yeah be really tough on the outside on Russia and threaten Russia militarily which is what Donald Trump arguably appeared to do before this amazing breakthrough with relations between the west and North Korea indeed fire and fury the title of this this book was based upon Trump's threats to North Korea but the president repeatedly denies any allegation right but he doesn't deny saying we will bring fire and fury which of course the the much of the establishment media dismissed and Lampoon at the time but has now led to and some some quite significant results in terms of threatening war and bellicose statements yesterday the Russian embassy released a statement saying that threats shouldn't be made against a state with nuclear arms now the United Kingdom at that time hadn't made any threats relating to conflict I don't think now I think that's an escalation especially when you look at diplomatic language which is very controlled and very nuanced in terms of what it is say I've call this hostile action the 23 diplomats they have but I think the progression to talk about nuclear armaments is a furtherance of aggression and but but I think the problem with all of this is that everything leading up to it has been to coin an American phrase a nothing burger all of the stuff about Russian agents you know I'm supposedly a Russian agent Nigel Ferrari is a Russian agent Donald Trump is a Russian agent I mean it must've been a very interesting year at the KGB that year where they recruited us all but I'll give you almost media in the United States appears to believe with it that is the case right and III think it's the old adage of a boy who cried wolf that all of this stuff that has gone in the past has come to nothing has been a load of nonsense by febrile establishment that wanted to use it as an excuse for their defeat and brexit or the the defeat of Hillary Clinton that's that's really interesting to me because it seems to me that there is motive on the side of the British government to try to look tough right you're saying brexit talks many people feel oh embroiled lots of other problems won't list them all in domestic policy here's a chance for Teresa made to start looking strong and yet as you've said a minute or two ago she's done this really fast where I would disagree with you is perhaps that there isn't an urgency in my view to be the judge and jury now there was an urgency to get the medical treatment for the victims but in any court case it can take months or years why do we have to do this so quickly when now as options already pointed out this has led to an escalated response from the Russians because I think national security issues by their very nature require an urgent response we don't know if there are other potential nerve agents out there we don't know if other British cities Lambeth oranges as Gerry Corwin appears to be saying we are actually still sure it is the Russians that's just finally go to the UN Security Council what do you make of I don't know what do you think that'll be an imaginative Avenue pursued by the British government but to resume very quick to say she's gonna calling you yeah I don't think it's imaginative at all and to go back to your point about Theresa May looking tough talking tough well this doesn't appear to me to be looking tough or talking to of this is a procedural response it's not going to move the the Russian state position at all and when Donald Trump has set the bar at fire and fury I think the dismissal of 23 diplomats is not going to do anything to move the dial and we have to I mean the the Westminster bubble is a point often made about what goes on here and and the the the deaf ear to the rest of the country I think if you walked into a pub and asked most people you know he's dismissing 23 diplomats a tough response I don't think it is I think that the the the the procedural language used and the the approach that Theresa May is taking is unimaginative and won't look tough and the irony in this situation in my view is that if she has to back down which simply means doing nothing more because if she doesn't escalate it it'll look like she's frozen the winner could be Jeremy Corbyn for having taken a more statesman like approach for urging caution and then being able to turn around to the country to say I told you so but of course Jeremy Corbyn is getting lambasted by everyone in the mainstream media in the president his Parliament I and others who voted against the Iraq war it was a slow burn but ultimately those who opposed the war ended up smelling of roses Lembit Ben thank you also thanks to professor Pierce Robinson for this special episode of going underground that tip of the show we'll see you on Saturday till then keep in touch by social media we'll see you on tape Patrick's Day
