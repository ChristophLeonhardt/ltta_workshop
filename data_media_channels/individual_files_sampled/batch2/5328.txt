the president is doubling down on his immigration ideology which is perhaps best summed up by the president's recent comments that were dealing with an infestation of criminals so this afternoon at the White House there he showcased families whose children have been killed allegedly by illegal immigrants before we show you some of the president's comments we should note that there is evidence from both government statistics and several prominent studies that claim and show that immigration both legal and illegal does not somehow increase crime rates and that the violent crime rate is actually lower among immigrant populations both legal and illegal than it is among citizens born in the United States so with that said here's the president this afternoon meeting with family members of people who were killed allegedly by illegal immigrants these are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones the word permanently being the word that you have to think about permanently they're not separated for a day or two days these are permanently separated we want people in our country based on merit not based on a draw where other countries put their absolute worst in a bin and they start drawing people I always hear that oh no the populations safer than the people that live in the country you've heard that fellas right we've heard that I hear so much and I say is that possible the answer is is not true you hear it's like they're better people than what we have then our citizens it's not true so the president referenced a few statistics to try to back up his argument two of them have been fact check before one was false the other lacked context and we could not find a reputable source for a third claim having to do with the number of Americans that he claimed allegedly were killed by illegal immigrants but folks in the typical metro area here's what we can tell you the immigrant population has gone up by more than 100 percent between 1980 and 2016 yet violent crime has gone down 36 percent over that same period assaults down 13% robberies down 42% murders down 40% all of this is according to journalists who have studied FBI and census data and then there's the incarceration rate among native-born Americans which is nearly double then of the illegal immigrants and five times legal immigrants also according to a 2018 study from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meet the press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
