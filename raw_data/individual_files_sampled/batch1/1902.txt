Hashim this what is happening now in Iran is it a power struggle between the reformists and the Conservatives or the hardliners or is it a new phenomenon in the country well no as a matter of fact our people have disappeared from the streets I mean those that we're raising rightful economic demands and the ones who were taking part in protests you know against President rouhani's austerity plan now there have remained a very few or rioters but just today tens of thousands of people in different cities took out to the streets to show their support for the government and for the establishment oh this is one of the very few cases and rare cases where different camps from even the green movement supporters to the reformists and to the you know principal ists that you just called conservatives of their standing all together they are standing behind the government and establishment stressing that people are entitled to the to shout their fruits at you know economic flaws and faults but they are all standing against riots because people who took part in the demonstrations against riots today they were demanding action by the government against the rioters who have caused several you know businesses shops of to shut down especially in those very few cities that have witnessed riots I'll come back to you later to talk in detail about the situation mr. Whalley position is of the view that this is losing momentum across the country you know as you know this demonstration started with the economic motivation and of course it was you know demanding specific matters from the government the focus was on the decision made by the government about the budget about the you know increasing taxes and other issues now what we see that in the last 48 hours it's obvious that the government government has followed different strategies to deal with the situation and to me is very clear that the establishment the political establishment the regime as a whole has has in a way or other directed the government to act accordingly to respond to the concerns of the people who are on the street it was obvious that the president rouhani two days ago had met the the member of the Parliament and he asked them that his government is considering review the budget and submitted to the Parliament and basically taking different measures to reduce the pressure on people's to me this is a very governmental tactic to convince the people that the government is sincere to take into consideration their demands but the question is how long the government will accept die and act okay mister Hashem can we say that what triggered the protests in Trahan was basically the general discontent over corruption and unemployment well you know when the protests started they started because of some financial banks private banks actually and some financial institutions went bankrupt and people were angry at these private or you know institutions the government promised help that it has taken some time for them to bring help to these poor people this is started in measure then economic you know austerity protests started in some twenty thirty cities but very soon after some people were manipulated by social media platforms admittedly funded and run from the best they emptied the streets they disappeared from the streets and now we see these protests in seven eight cities the same thing is true with regard to Tehran we have not seen a united protest in Tehran except for fifty students who are appeared in the streets for two days on you know Saturday and Sunday in front of Tehran University they were confronted by two hundred are opposing our university protesters who were condemning the first group of protesters and we have not seen any major protest ever since then some nights as you can see groups of twenty thirty people in you know central Tehran or northern Tehran walking together but there is not much activity and because there is no single leadership you know and this riot basically if you just allow me to explain about the numbers may be in the next question you know also to talk about the protests in Iran is Twitter policy he is founder and president of the National Iranian American Council mister passive I mean there's been all those theories about who are these people on the streets are they a silent majority is it this a new phenomena in Iran or are they people who have been manipulated by the clerical establishment to take advantage of the situation Iran well what the first thing we can say is that clearly this is a different segment of society than what we saw in 2009 this appears to be a segment that is not as involved politically not as experienced politically and have not been at the center of Iran's political developments for the last 20 years it is also a poorer segment of society that is much more negatively affected by the dire economic situation particularly some of the measures that have been proposed in this new budget such as cuts to cash handouts as well as increase in fuel prices but we also have to acknowledge that this discontent in society not just with the economic situation but with the social situation with the political situation is quite deep and very very widespread so even if the numbers are much smaller there's also clearly people who are not out there in the streets but nevertheless very sympathetic perhaps not to the methodology of the protest but with the grievances of the protest mrs. Wherry mr. Posse says this is although the numbers are not huge compared to a 2000 number this is quite significant it could be a stirring into something quite new in Iran we've seen the slogans people upset about the situation in the country can we say that hello honey President rouhani has failed to deliver on the promises he made during the campaign as you know President rouhani on the first of term of his presidency his focus was the nuclear deal and he promised of course he promised the Iranian that you know the political situation will be changed and and he promised that this cannot be done without fixing the foreign policy issue as a whole including the nuclear deal and I think based on that he was elected in the first time so as he as then the deal was signed and in summer 2015 the hope was this deal will bring you know a new support to the economic situation in Iran and assuming that the money there will be moving of sanction there will be Iran will be open up for foreign investments the political situation and the the will will affect the economic situation assuming that was also there will be a change on the economic dynamic in Iran and you know with Trump came in comes to power I'm you know unfortunately things has changed President Trump he was not happy with the deal he was not happy with of Iranian foreign policy and he started with demonizing Iran again and we went back to the time where Republicans right Bush the father and the son were in power so basically that time is coming back with during Trump and he was start his writing he started to criticize Iran and focusing on the nuclear day itself as a reason to help okay I think that was an important issue to see these kinds of demonstrations mr.ho sure sure I would like to go back to the proposed budget for 2018 which many believe was the main trigger of the protests it suggests slashing some of the social welfare programs but at the same time it expands the budget for all the allocations for the military establishment particularly the Revolutionary Guard and for some of the clerical establishments in Iran do you think that this budget will be shelved and a new one will be presented to answer some of the concerns of the people you know efficient should be paid to the fact that before 2005 or six the Americans tried the lots of way in order to topple the Islamic Republic including riots and colorful revolutions but since 2009 or a they came to realize that they cannot do that but they can use riots and protests in order to lay pressure on Tehran to justify sanctions to pressure Tehran to give up its components of power that include its missile industry nuclear industries and its regional clouds they are looking at these riots the same way you know when they started their work for about the government's austerity plans for the next year but very soon of the social media platforms run from abroad they started manipulating people and provoking them to you know practice of harsh you know actions to do harsh actions and you know to sabotage to raid military bases to they even teach them how to make Molotov cocktails and and that means war and terrorism so they've been encouraging them to go for riots why because Donald Trump's a Donald Trump is going to make a number of decisions in coming weeks in the next two weeks he is to decertify or recertify the nuclear deal with Iran and he also is to make a decision about further suspension of the sanctions and he it was an analysis before but now after what the spokesperson of the White House said and many other officials in Washington it has come under the spotlight that they mean to use these riots in order to justify re-imposition of a part of the sanctions and ratifying new sanctions to keep the run under pressure in order to force Tehran to give up a part of his original role okay that's why basically they are trying with the help of Saudi Arabia and Israel they're trying since so both people to continue the riot until Saturday okay since you've been mentioning the foreign intervention which has been reiterated by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and many officials mr. Posse to stay with this particular point if Trump continues tweeting about the unrest in Iran is there any concern that this could backfire in a sense that it will just feel the government narrative that this is something done by people manipulated by the enemies of Iran I think that you know what Trump is doing is not helpful I don't think he's trying to help the protesters who do have legitimate grievances rather he's just trying to fan the flames and try to help create more instability at the same time I don't think people in Iran are listening to Donald Trump Donald Trump is not a respected person whether you are sympathetic to the government of Iran or opposed to it Donald Trump is not viewed as your friend mindful of the very anti Iranian and policies that he's pursued that have been very antagonistic towards the Iranian people as a whole including for instance the Muslim ban that has been affecting Iranians more than any other nationalities we should not forget that when Isis struck Tehran and killed 17 people Donald Trump condemned Iran and blamed it on Iran this is probably the first and only time the United States has given Isis a pass all of these different steps have created a situation in which the people of Iran are not viewing Donald Trump as a friend but then that also means that it makes it more difficult for the Iranian government to try to paint the protestors as simply people that are being inspired or following Donald Trump mm-hmm mister is aware the protesters also have been very critical of the Iranian intervention in regional affairs particularly places like Yemen Syria and Lebanon saying enough is enough we don't care about Syria we care about our own cells the protests are they likely to put more pressure on the Iranian government to further in intervener those bases I think what's important about the slogan is the fact that the government establishment of Iran has failed to convince its own people that if his foreign policy was going on the right direction that slogan does confirm that you know the media what was broadcasting through the media in Iran what's being said by the officials what's been publicized that Iran is presence in Syria or in Iraq or Eman is in favor of Iran is a protecting Iran in reality was not really convinced to the Iranians Iranians say on those was saying on those demonstration that we need you to take care of us so basically all of the was being said was not real because not being convincing to the to the vehicle the second point I think in that context we have to ancient that again the establishment did not consult the people on its foreign policy it basically it did it based on its own view and the interest of the establishment and their and the regime itself and assuming that this represent the Iranians our interest and I think this demonstration would not affect the decision of Iranian government where to go after this the only thing I assumed will have impact is that the the the gap about you know the gap between the government the regime and the people will be wider and wider when it comes to the foreign policy and the Iranian behavior in the region mr. hoshi sham are we likely to see the government hate some of those concerns voiced by the people particular when it comes to the regional involvement or do you believe this is something which is vital for Iran's national security and therefore there's absolutely no compromise on this you know let me add one more point when we were talking about Donald Trump himself and upfront policy my colleague was right Donald Trump has proved to be an enemy of hearing in the nation he has called the nation has a terrorist nation and no one cares for Donald Trump here but when we are talking about behind the scene of decision makings they have even done a lots of things in order to provoke these riots just thought yesterday they declared that they are viewing and studying different ways in order to promote and to bring more social networks and platforms to Iran in order to connect these riots and to have them continue why they intend to intensify clashes and they intend to escalate that tensions are so far Iranian officials of the government and the IRGC especially they have shown a self restraint and they do not mean to clamp down on these riots despite the fact that they have been harming public and private properties but the United States intends to escalate the tensions to force Iranian IRGC and law enforcement and others of you know or clash with these protesters with these rioters not protesters protests protests and that just a few days ago now we are just only witnessing riots and damaging of properties in order to justify the CAC sir sanctions that they are ratified a couple of months ago and you know against the IRGC that's the plan they are pursuing and that's why they insist so much that they want these riots continue in the next week after Iranians millions of Iranians are to get out on Friday especially in Tehran to show their support again for the establishment and against these riots now they want these riots to continue in the next week okay exactly for the supporters because IRGC has warned that it would enter the scene in the next week if these riots do not come to an end and this takes us to the next question mister Posse what are the options for the Iranian government will it continue to clamp down all the protesters or do you think because of the growing general sentiment among the international community that enough is enough we might see some compromises in the near future well if there's a compromise I don't think it's gonna be as a result of what the international community says it's gonna be based on other calculations I think there's a realization in the rouhani government that there is a lot of legitimate grievances on behalf of the protesters and that some changes are needed to be made to this budgets because the difficulty that the rouhani government has had is to fulfill the expectations that it itself helped to set when it came to what the economic prospects for the country would be in a post jcpoa in a post nuclear deal environment it has not been able to meet those it's not entirely its own fault a lot of it is as a result of the Trump administration creating so much political uncertainty about the future of the nuclear deal which is then caused a lot of financial institutions to refuse to finance investments in Iran when investments are not being made in Iran jobs are not being created Iran's economy is moving in the right direction on paper with more than 4% growth but that's mainly because of oil sales cells don't create jobs investments do and it's been very difficult for the rouhani government to attract the investments as a result of what's happening with a nuclear deal the rouhani government is gonna have a couple of days to be able to make some changes to the budget and and try to meet the protesters otherwise as has been suggested the IRGC is likely going to step in and then we will see a much more brutal crackdown against the protesters and the potential repeat acute ality that we saw in 2009 unfortunately we'll have to leave it there but thank you very much indeed say it most of a wholesome herbs away lee and twitter
