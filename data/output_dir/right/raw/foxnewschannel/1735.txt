1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:02,387
SCHUMER SENDING SINCERE WISHES

2
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:03,655
FOR HER SPEEDY RECOVERY.

3
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:08,760
WE ALL SEND THOSE HERE AS WELL.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,629
>> WE BELIEVE HAMAS BEARS THE

5
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:11,997
RESPONSIBILITY.

6
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:15,434
THIS IS A PROPAGANDA ATTEMPT.

7
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:16,702
A GRUESOME PROPAGANDA ATTEMPT.

8
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:18,337
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS

9
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:20,405
SPENT WEEKS TRYING TO HANDLE

10
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:21,340
THIS WITHOUT VIOLENCE.

11
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,008
>> Bill: THIS SITUATION IS VERY

12
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:23,475
TENDER TODAY.

13
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:24,643
THE WHITE HOUSE LAYING THE

14
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:26,511
BLAME FOR THE DEATHS OF 60

15
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,614
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA AT THE

16
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:29,781
FEET OF HAMAS.

17
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,183
MEANWHILE TURKEY, ONE OF

18
00:00:31,183 --> 00:00:32,150
AMERICA'S ALLIES RECALLING ALL

19
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,756
THEIR ENVOYS AND U.S. AND

20
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:38,090
ISRAEL.

21
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,057
DANNY DANON WITH ME NOW.

22
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,293
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

23
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:43,996
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

24
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:45,764
NORMALIZING THIS SITUATION

25
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:46,064
TODAY?

26
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:46,932
GAZA?

27
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:52,571
>> IT'S UP TO HAMAS.

28
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:54,673
IT IS BY THE HAMAS ORGANIZATION.

29
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:55,641
THEY ARE USING CIVILIANS AND

30
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:58,210
SENDING THEM TO THE FENCE AND

31
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:58,877
TARGETING ISRAELI CIVILIANS.

32
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:00,879
OUR INTEREST IS NOT TO SEE ANY

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,180
CASUALTIES BUT THEY HAVE THE

34
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,548
INTEREST TO SEE MORE CASUALTIES.

35
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:06,018
IN ONE HOUR WE'LL HAVE A

36
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:06,852
SECURITY COUNCIL EMERGENCY

37
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:08,020
SESSION IN THE U.N. SPEAKING

38
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,021
ABOUT THE CASUALTIES.

39
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:10,355
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT

40
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:10,956
TO DO.

41
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:13,091
INSTEAD OF US SPEAKING ABOUT

42
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:15,127
THE GREAT MOVE OF THE EMBASSY

43
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:16,395
THEY WANTED EVERYBODY TO SPEAK

44
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,730
ABOUT THE CASUALTIES AND USING

45
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,198
THOSE CHILDREN, INNOCENT PEOPLE

46
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:22,100
AS HUMAN SHIELDS IN ORDER TO

47
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,435
CREATE RIOTS.

48
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:26,471
>> Bill: I WANT TO COME BACK TO

49
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:27,205
THE EMBASSY.

50
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:28,674
IT'S A PROBLEM FOR HAMAS BUT A

51
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,242
PROBLEM FOR ISRAEL, TOO.

52
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:32,344
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU GET TO THE

53
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:35,080
POINT WHERE YOU CAN NORMALIZE

54
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,348
THIS BORDER YET AGAIN?

55
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,684
>> WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF

56
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:39,084
ESCALATION.

57
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:41,486
WHEN SOMEBODY IS APPROACHING

58
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:48,960
THE FENCE WITH EXPLOSIVES AND

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,463
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WE HAVE TO

60
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:51,963
PROTECT OURSELVES.

61
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:55,767
WHETHER THEY TRY TO BREAK THE

62
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:56,068
FENCE.

63
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:57,869
IF THEY BREAK THE FENCE THEY

64
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,337
WILL STORM THE COMMUNITIES.

65
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:01,440
>> Bill: YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT

66
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,907
THAT.

67
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:03,775
THOSE LIVING IN GAZA LOOK INTO

68
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:09,080
ISRAEL AND DON'T SEE ISRAEL,

69
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,614
THEY SEE PALESTINE.

70
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,383
AT WHAT POINT CAN YOU GET TO

71
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,985
THE NEXT DAY WHERE THE OTHER

72
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,054
SIDE WOULD ARGUE THE WHOLE

73
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,489
EMBASSY MOVE GIVES THEM REASON

74
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:18,890
TO RIOT IN THE MANNER THAT THEY

75
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,058
HAVE?

76
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,960
>> IT'S AN EXCUSE, BILL.

77
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,829
THEY WILL FIND A REASON FOR

78
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,296
VIOLENCE.

79
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,631
THEY WILL FIND A REASON FOR

80
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,032
ESCALATION.

81
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:29,668
I WANT TO REMIND YOU IN 2005 WE

82
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:32,938
PULLED OUT OF GAZA COMPLETELY.

83
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:35,774
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY JEWISH

84
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:37,275
COMMUNITIES, WE TOOK OFF.

85
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:38,877
THE PEOPLE OF GAZA ARE BEING

86
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:40,145
HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS.

87
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:42,280
I FEEL BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF

88
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,748
GAZA.

89
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,317
ON FRIDAY THEY SET ON FIRE THE

90
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:47,185
CHECKPOINT WHERE WE BRING AID

91
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:47,652
INTO GAZA.

92
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:49,988
NOW WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BRING

93
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:51,757
THE HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT.

94
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:55,327
I THINK THE INTERNATIONAL

95
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:56,394
COMMUNITY SHOULD CONDEMN HAMAS

96
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:58,363
TODAY AND NOT ISRAEL.

97
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,866
>> Bill: PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN.

98
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:04,336
WHAT DID THAT MEAN TO YOU FOR

99
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:07,305
THE U.S. GOING TO JERUSALEM.

100
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,642
>> HISTORIC DAY FOR US.

101
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:11,576
WE THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR

102
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:14,379
THE BOLD TO MOVE THE EMBASSY TO

103
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:14,746
JERUSALEM.

104
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:16,014
THE JEWISH CAPITAL FOR MORE

105
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:17,449
THAN 3,000 YEARS AND FINALLY

106
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,317
THE U.S. TOOK THE LEADERSHIP.

107
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:22,687
OTHER COUNTRIES WILL FOLLOW THE

108
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:23,188
U.S.

109
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,356
TOMORROW GUATEMALA WILL OPEN

110
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:25,524
THEIR EMBASSY AND MANY OTHER

111
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,259
COUNTRIES WILL COME AFTER THE

112
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:27,626
U.S.

113
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:29,494
TO US IT IS HISTORY.

114
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,896
A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY YESTERDAY

115
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,731
IN JERUSALEM.

116
00:03:32,731 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Bill: GUATEMALA AND PARAGUAY
