HE SAYS IT WOULD INFEST THE U.S.

10
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:17,458
WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WOULD

11
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,293
VOTE AGAINST REPUBLICANS.

12
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:20,261

TONIGHT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

23
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,478
GETTING AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE

24
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:38,479
MEASURES THROUGH.

25
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,113
OFFICIALLY THE WHITE HOUSE

26
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:39,814
SUPPORTS BOTH OF THEM BUT THE

27
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:43,351
COMPROMISE BILL IS THE ONE THEY

28
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,085
WOULD MORE LIKELY LIKE TO SEE

29
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:44,886

FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED ON THE

34
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,061
BORDER.

35
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,595
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NEED ALL

36
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:55,863
HIS DEALMAKING SKILLS TO PULL

37
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:57,865
THIS ONE OFF, LEVERAGING THE

38
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:58,666
HORRIBLY UNPOPULAR IDEA OF

39
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,269
SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR

40
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,236

BE DETAINED TOGETHER.

50
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:21,923
>> THE PRESIDENT IS BLAMING

51
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:24,225
DEMOCRATS BUT IT WAS HIS

52
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:24,892
ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO

53
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:27,395
INVOKE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY

54
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:28,663

58
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,602
PROFOUNDLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON

59
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:35,003
THE NATION.

>> THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING

68
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:53,755
CONGRESS TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE

69
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:57,058

THEY DO NOTHING FOR US.

125
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,714
THEY COULD STOP IT.

126
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:30,485
THEY HAVE VERY, VERY STRONG

127
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:30,918
