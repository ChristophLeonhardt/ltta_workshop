1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,770
Poland is changing.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,760
Every year the country celebrates its national
Independence Day in the capital, Warsaw.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,040
There are parades and speeches
But in 2017, Poland’s Independence Day made

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,660
worldwide news because of these signs:

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,429
60,000 people showed up for a march led by
Nationalist and white-supremacist groups.

6
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,500
That’s because they have reason to celebrate,
too.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,460
Poland’s right-wing political party, PiS,
is in power.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,010
After winning the Presidency and a majority
in Parliament, they've ignored the constitution,

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,630
Taken over the courts, purged the military,
and cracked down on the media.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,820
PiS is bringing authoritarianism back to Poland
and

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,969
openly rebelling against the European Union.

12
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:50,370
It’s a shocking turn for a country that,
just a few years ago was hailed as one of

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,989
Europe’s most promising young democracies.

14
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,530
So, how did this happen?

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,820
And can it be stopped?

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:14,000
It was an old story to the Polish population
- conquest, subjugation, enslavement.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,790
it had happened before in Poland’s troubled
history but never with such inhumanity

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,130
Poland had a traumatic 20th century.

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,240
It was invaded twice during World War Two.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,590
First by the Germans and then by the Soviets...
...who re-established the country after the

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,010
war, but as a communist state under their
control.

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,220
In fact, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin directly
contributed to a draft of Poland's constitution,

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,840
which was formalized in 1952.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,229
These are his handwritten notes.

25
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,159
For the next several decades, Poland developed
very little while it was cut off from the

26
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,200
rest of the world.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,060
It became one of several Soviet-backed, communist
countries in Central and Eastern Europe that

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,110
made up the Soviet bloc.

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,579
That started to change in the 1980s.

30
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,820
Polish unions started organizing huge strikes
against the communist government.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:17,490
The movement came to be called Solidarity
and it grabbed the attention of

32
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,040
the world.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,910
In 1989, the communist government caved to
the pressure and agreed to let non-communist

34
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,580
parties run in the elections.

35
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,150
Solidarity and democratic candidates went
on to win the majority of parliament and the

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,150
presidency.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,800
They established the Republic of Poland and
became the first country in Europe to topple

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
communism.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,980
The rest of the Soviet bloc soon followed.

40
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,260
This posed a challenge for Western Europe.

41
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:55,080
We cannot aim at anything less than the union
of Europe as a whole and we look with confidence

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,340
for the day that union is achieved

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,900
Since the end of World War Two, the continent’s
democracies had been growing closer; signing

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,200
free trade deals that became the precursor
to today’s European Union.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,200
At first, the trade deals just covered coal
and steel, but as they grew to include agriculture,

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,320
energy, and other markets, more countries
joined-- making Europe more economically and

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,410
politically integrated than it had ever been
before.

48
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,840
As the former Soviet bloc countries started
establishing democracies of their own; Western

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,510
Europe needed to find a way to include them.

50
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,050
So in 1993, the established EU countries came
up with a strict checklist for admitting new

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,480
members.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,000
New member-states needed to have a free market
economy, respect human rights and the rule

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
of law.

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,260
Meaning courts had to be independent and impartial--
so everyone could get a fair trial.

55
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,840
These EU rules helped bring former-communist
countries in while also keeping them from

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,660
sliding back into authoritarianism.

57
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,250
They were designed to keep the peace in Europe.

58
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,900
Poland joined the EU in 2004 and because of
Solidarity's success it became one of the

59
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,250
most promising new member.

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,250
Poland was given more money than any other
EU country which it used to build highways,

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,250
schools, hospitals, and modern infrastructure.

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,250
The country’s economy grew more than any
other ex-communist country.

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,080
Each year after it joined, Poland received
millions of Euros to help fund highways, schools,

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,100
hospitals, and modern infrastructure.

65
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,380
By 2014, Poland became one of the EU’s strongest
and most resilient members.

66
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,280
It even avoided the recession in 2009 that
crippled economies worldwide.

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,290
Polling showed 72% of Poles were satisfied
with EU membership.

68
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,430
More than any other member state.

69
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,430
Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski:
“Ladies & Gentleman, 10 years ago we joined

70
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,430
the European Union.

71
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,430
We did not become part of the EU on a whim.

72
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,430
We became part of the union because we put
in tremendous efforts to build a democracy

73
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,430
and a free market economy; two pillars of
a united Europe.”

74
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,430
And Poland’s charismatic, pro-EU Prime minister,
Donald Tusk, was chosen to become president

75
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,160
of the EU’s European Council.

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,820
But in his absence, leaders with a very different
vision for Poland's future rose to power.

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,380
In 2015 PiS, Poland’s right-wing party,
shocked the world and won an absolute majority

78
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,950
in the parliament.

79
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,340
Since 2001, PiS had been led by former-Solidarity
leaders Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who felt

80
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,230
that Poland’s center-left parties had become
elitist and corrupt.

81
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,440
It appealed to Poland’s conservative population
in rural areas.

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,460
PiS only earned 38% of the vote in 2015, on
par with the previous election results, but

83
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,320
after Tusk left for the EU, his coalition
of center-left parties fell apart, making

84
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,250
room for the right-wing party to take over.h

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,270
According to PiS, after decades of Soviet
control, Poland was now being controlled by

86
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,780
the EU.

87
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,500
So when it came into power, it pledged to
take back Poland’s independence … legally

88
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,400
or illegally.

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,550
The party already controlled BOTH HOUSE OF
Parliament and the Presidency, so it initiated

90
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,730
a hostile takeover of the judicial branch.

91
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,620
First it packed this Constitutional court
with loyal judges and then forced out more

92
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,480
than a third of the judges in this other court.

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,300
Both acts were illegal under the Polish constitution,
but the PiS-majority parliament and Presidency

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,770
signed them into law anyway.

95
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,110
The party also fired over 11,000 civil-service
workers and at least 280 military officers,

96
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,110
calling them ex-communists.

97
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,110
It cracked down on the media.

98
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,860
It started leveling fines on news organizations
when it didn’t like their coverage.

99
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,840
Meanwhile, it’s been using Polish nationalism
to justify these moves.

100
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,380
Remember this 2017 controversial march?

101
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,280
A PiS politician called it “a beautiful
site”

102
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,540
While the party cracked down on protests against
their authoritarian moves.

103
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,460
As PiS tightened its grip on Poland, the EU
issued several warnings to stop it from breaking

104
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
its rules….

105
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,750
But PiS ignored them.

106
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:32,340
“It is with a heavy heart that we have decided
to initiate Article 7.1”, “But the facts

107
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,730
leave us with no choice.”

108
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:40,151
In December 2017, the EU invoked Article 7--
its nuclear option-- for the first time in

109
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,060
its history.

110
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,920
It allows the EU to strip a member of its
voting rights if it feels it is breaking the

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,500
criteria it established in 1993.

112
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,100
// a significant number of laws have been
adopted… which put at serious risk the independence

113
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,450
of the judiciary and separation of powers,
in Poland//.

114
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,900
According to the EU, the PiS purging of the
courts violates the country’s commitment

115
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
to respecting the rule of law.

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,430
The problem for the EU is that Article 7 is
not going to work.

117
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,130
The punishment requires a unanimous vote by
all EU countries -- and there is one country

118
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,740
that has sworn to protect Poland...

119
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,930
Hungary, another former Soviet bloc country,
has taken a turn towards authoritarianism

120
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,060
under President Viktor Orban.

121
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,900
And he vowed to veto any punishment against
Poland.

122
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
So PiS continues to systematically strip…
on Poland while still receiving huge sums

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
of money from the EU.

124
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
It’s proving that a member country can stay
in the EU, reap its economic benefits, while

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
ignoring its rules on rule of law.

126
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,880
PiS is proving that it's possible to reap
the economic benefits of EU membership while

127
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,540
flouting the rule of law.

128
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,040
And that has sparked an existential crisis
for the EU...

129
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,440
The rules that were written to prevent authoritarianism
from ever re-appearing in Europe, aren’t

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,650
being followed, and there’s not much it
can do about it.

131
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,770
The EU could try cutting off Poland’s funding
but it’s unclear how that would work.

132
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,590
So for now, the EU remains in a crisis.

133
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,760
For decades it’s tried to keep Europe democratic.

134
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,790
But Poland, once the EU’s most promising
new addition, is

135
00:07:53,790 --> 00:00:00,000
Is now threatening to unravel the whole thing.
