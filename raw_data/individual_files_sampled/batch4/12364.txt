there's this title axe title 10 family planning program which was established to send government funds to family planning agencies but not to fund abortion but it goes to Planned Parenthood because they pretend they have other family planning roles instead of abortion which is very dubious assertion but they say they do and they say well this money doesn't go to fund our abortions but of course money is fungible right you it doesn't matter if you give it to me here I can use it there I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna spend that money there how do you know which dollar it is that's going into this stuff so Trump is saying we're gonna cut this back and of course this is I think this is a tremendous thing and he goes out and he starts to rip on the Democrats at this speech before Planned Parenthood he's celebrating the fact which is true that this is a very anti-abortion a pro-life administration and he goes after the Democrats on abortion listen to what he says it's cut number three Democrats in the Senate are doing everything within their power to block it although some are actually on our side but they are working overtime to block it so the story is 18 midterms we need Republicans and that will happen on this issue like so many other issues the Democratic Party is far outside the American mainstream far outside the United States is one of only seven countries in the world to allow elective abortions after 20 weeks when unborn babies can truly feel the pain yet Democratic senators like John tester Heidi Heitkamp Claire McCaskill debbie Stabenow all voted against the 20-week bill and in favor of late term abortion see we're talking about this is so brilliant because that all the press does is try to make people feel that that's not a manger but what he's saying is not mainstream and he's turning it on his head the thing is we can see what leftism turns people into at 18 weeks at 18 weeks with them you know with those what do they call ultrasound things you can see a baby in the womb smiling you can see it clapping you can see it's sucking its thumb okay 20 weeks he's right 20 weeks a baby feels the pain when you murder it when he when he was fascinated so you know what kind of person supports that
