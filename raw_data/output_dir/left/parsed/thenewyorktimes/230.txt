This is the story of
the tiny rove beetle —
a little-studied insect that
mimics ants and termites
to live in and prey on
their colonies undetected —
and a boy, Joe Parker, who
turned a childhood passion
into a scientific
quest to understand
the extraordinary evolutionary
journey of these beetles.
Parker discovered the world
of insects and the rove beetle
at a very young age.
“I have been really
interested in insects
since I was a small child.
All of the rest of
the world fell away,
and it was just me and insects.”
The beetles — beautiful
under a microscope —
are common in Wales,
where he grew up.
But it’s the way
some species have
evolved that made Parker commit
his life’s work to the insects.
Here’s how it went.
Ancestral rove beetles
entered colonies
to prey on ants or termites
using their chemical gland
for defense.
The approach was classic —
enter, attack, escape.
But over time,
some beetle species
evolved a sneakier approach.
They began to live
in the colonies,
masquerading as
termites or ants.
“If you can get your foot in
the door of an ant colony,
there are no other predators.
It’s climatically controlled.
It’s full of
resources, so you can
feed on the ant brood and
food that the ants have harvested
to your heart’s content.”
What allowed the beetles
to survive in the ant
colonies were major evolutionary
changes in body and behavior.
The defensive gland at
the end of the abdomen
evolved to produce chemicals
that made the beetles smell
like colony members.
Instead of harming the
ants, they tricked them.
In some cases, the ants were
even drawn to the smell.
And their bodies
were transformed.
Legs and antennae grew longer.
Their abdomen slimmed.
The result — they came
to resemble the ants.
Even more surprising
is that this
wasn’t a single event passed
on from one ancestral line.
It happened many times.
Over millions of years, at
least 12 separate lineages
of rove beetles
have independently
gone through the
same transformation,
from a free-roaming
solitary beetle
to a social insect living
with ants or termites.
The big question is what
genetic changes caused
these transformations,
and this is the part
that really excites Parker.
“There’s clearly
something special
about these beetles compared
to almost all other forms
of animal life that
kind of poises them,
predisposes them evolutionarily
to be able to do this.”
He now has his sights set
on mapping and comparing
the genes of many
rove beetle species.
The research could
provide some deep insights
into the nature of evolution —
the process that has made
both beetles and humans who
we are today.
And it all started with
a childhood passion.
