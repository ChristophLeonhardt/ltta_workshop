against Brett Kavanaugh and of course the accuser is Christine Blasi Ford the smear tactics from the right have begun and they have begun aggressively they are relentless and it also includes quite a bit of funding and I'll give you some examples of how it's all going down so first there is the judicial Christ's work this is a group of conservatives who aggressively fight to have pro corporate conservative Supreme Court judges nominated and so they have decided to put one point five million dollars behind a television ad blitz that features a person who has been friends with Kavanagh for thirty five years okay so that's the beginning of it all so the judicial crisis network has already pledged to spend five million dollars back in Kavanagh so their first ad was released immediately they released it last night Monday night and we have it for you just so you get a sense of the tactics they're planning on using take a look friends with Brett Kavanaugh for 35 years never thought about doing a TV commercial I'm not involved in politics I'm a teacher I'm a coach I believe that we need to have bright curious open-minded thoughtful empathetic people who are judges and I trust that Brett is that person he's dedicated to his work he's dedicated to his family he said the highest integrity as a person and I believe that he would be a great Supreme Court justice so that add features a teacher who claims to have known him for 35 years the tactic is hey look at all these people who can vouch for him vouch for his character because you know people who have been accused of rape you know everyone has to dislike them throughout their entire lives it's impossible for that person to have a group of people in their personal lives that like them and fact them while they could also in their you know in private do things like attempted rape so I think the substance of that is pretty weak a lot of people like to OJ to that didn't mean he didn't do it he's a very likable guy outside of murdering two people so but I think the more important part of this is that's fascinating so five million dollars are gonna if they have announced other they're gonna spend one and a half they've already put into TV ads where's the money coming from is it concerned citizens who are genuinely pro-life and they care about that and they think Cavanaugh is prologue is it genuine citizens who think no I I know I don't know anything about Cavanaugh being against Roe vs. Wade because that's the official Republican stance right I just think he's such a wonderful principal jurist that I am looking forward to to having him confirm another Supreme course I'm gonna give five bucks ten bucks twenty seven bucks to make sure I run these ads to new no no the funny thing is it has nothing to do with the hot-button topics that you're seeing now the ad is funded by very wealthy people and corporations because Cavanaugh is massively Pro big business so they need his vote in there not for Roe versus Wade not for anything else they needed to make sure that they he advances advances a pro corporate agenda so those donors are like oh it's accused of attempted rape whatever role in the five million dollars let's get this guy in the court is so you could rule against our employees all day long that's what's being played here you think five million dollars materializes out of nowhere for this no there's people who think I'm gonna make a buck off of Cavanaugh being on the Supreme Court yeah absolutely any and he is a pro corporate judge his past rulings and decisions prove that and the fact that they were able you know this this organization the judicial crisis network was able to get this funding secured so quickly tells you something there are people who are worried about their bottom line at the end of the day rape doesn't matter attempted rape doesn't matter his character doesn't matter the rulings that he might have in regard to social issues or women's health doesn't matter it doesn't matter and by the way the judicial crisis network is just one organization that includes people that are now attacking Ford and her allegations there's also Dennis Prager and he wrote an op-ed for the National Review that was disgusting and so I'm gonna give you a few of the excerpts Prager who once called the idea of college rape culture a gargantuan lie argues at his piece for National Review that the allegations against Cavanaugh should be ignored because they tell us nothing about Brett Kavanaugh since the age of 17 so there's two Everett parts that one is the general the rape culture being a gargantuan lie I you know I I don't know what he means by that but I know what he encourages by that he encourages people the guy it's not a big deal just don't worry you don't spend too much time on it so when victims asked for more protections from universities don't sweat it it's all a lie it's all a lie so that's a terrible thing to spread the second part of it is him saying look this happened when he was 17 doesn't tell us anything about him being 53 then actually I find to be the least offensive of all the defenses of Cavanaugh but hold he's gonna get to really really offensive in a second um I disagree with you I think attempted rape at any age says something about a person right no I'm gonna see a dozen I'm saying of all their defenses of Cavanagh that's the least offensive do you see what I'm saying because there's low bar yeah I hear you it's a low bar but look we've had this discussion before so if if he was accused of this a year ago when he was 52 well it's a no-brainer everybody knows that he's responsible for it if he was accused when he was as we talked about on Friday show I believe 12 well that's the difference situation when he was 12 so I think that their best defense is well 17 is closer to 12 than it is to 52 I don't it doesn't mean that I believe in that defense but the other day those are way way worse because there are they're saying like out what happened to her is not that big a deal and that preggers about to make those arguments the judicial crisis Network spokespersons about to make those arguments on CNN I think those are horrific arguments they should go nowhere near them which only leaves them this or she's just made it up entirely I think that's their otherwise they got nothing so in this National Review piece he also writes this is another example keep in mind like this is what he's focusing on here this is another example of the moral chaos sewn by secularism and the left okay let's stop for a second by the way Dave Rubin you should feel really proud of yourself for working for this guy that's the problem secularism is the problem the chaos owned by secularism is the problem you don't think that it's problematic that someone who might be the net a new Supreme Court justice in the highest court in the country might have carried out attempted rape you don't think that that's the problem you think that secularism is the problem I mean but get a load of that inverted logic where they live in the upside down so he's like if the people were more religious they would realize that charges of attempted rape are no big deal he's arguing that craigers arguing that that is the moral position the immoral secular left position is attempted rape is a big deal okay look you make your own decision on which one you think is moral and which one is not moral but the way that they turn things on their head is amazing somehow he's made it sort of the moral position is supporting attempted rape okay but look look keep going keep going I'm telling you it's it gets really really really bad in any society rooted in judeo-christian values it is understood that people should be morally assessed based on how they behave over the course of their lifetime early behavior being the least important period in making such an assessment okay so I have a billion things to say about this first of all I got to go back to the whole secular is it so you don't believe in sex ism do you believe in the Constitution so do you think that we should be forced to believe a religion like what does that even mean guys like the what drives me crazy about the right wing is that they respect guys like Prager because it's such a low bar it like most of the people in the party are total morons like Donald Trump in george w bush so when somebody with a pulse shows up they're like dennis prager oh my god he's got a university where he teaches how bad the secular left is but think about how irrationally is on every front to Anna's point there you don't believe in secularism so you think what church and station become mine that religion should rule us but Prager you're Jewish I Got News for you your religion isn't going to win and I've got further news for you because apparently even though you've got a whole University you've named after yourself let's just note how obnoxious that is and the other guy who did that was Donald Trump anyway historically which you've apparently never studied when Christians or any religion rule over Jews and other minorities it doesn't end well when they say I'm going to use my religion to rule and by the way you're in a minority religion have you studied any history you know how that ends oh yeah I got a great idea let's make sure that though we don't do secularism we combine church and state because I'm one of the dumbest guys alive okay so let's get to the second part of that excerpt that is insane so look I don't I don't care if he did this at 17 for me it doesn't matter because guess what normal people don't do at the age of 17 attempted rape right so it's one thing if hey when I was 17 I decided to drink and get behind the wheel and I got caught in a DUI like if that was an allegation against Brett Kavanaugh I'd be like okay come on like we've all made a mistake let's move on this is attempted rape okay yeah this is different from any other youthful indiscretion that people could be accused of so look and DUI obviously is very serious and and that's why it's an important and interesting conversation etc and and that's why we said in the beginning if you're gonna go back to high school it's got to be a high bar it doesn't get much higher than attempted rape and in in terms of some of the attacks against Kavanagh they're all pointing to how he used to admit to drinking a lot in high school look for people who are looking to corroborate professor Ford's story that he was stumbling drunk that is relevant for people looking to say he was a bad guy in high school for over drinking that is not relevant I want to be clear because they're gonna set up straw man arguments we don't care that he drank too much we care about what he did on that day when he drank too much and and allegedly did the attempted rape that's what we care about not about the drinking so but for God's sake let's get to his mom and his wife and what he thinks so he tries to make it seem like you know getting groped is not that big of a deal that you know people and his personal life had to deal with it and they handled it just fine my mother was groped by a physician she told my father about it my father told the physician that if you were to do that again he would break his hands and then he talks about his wife let me get to this because this gives you even more detail into his way of thinking he says when my wife was a waitress in her mid teens the manager of her restaurant grabbed her breasts and squeeze them on numerous occasions she told him to buzz off figured out how to avoid being in places where they were alone and continued going about her job that's empowerment no it's not no it's not so you think the right approach for my god your mom and your wife is when men grab their breasts there should be no consequences there should be no legal consequences that's not sexual assault that the most the consequences should be hey I told them to buzz off know that the onus is on the woman right because if your if your manager or higher up in the company that you're working for gropes you and makes you uncomfortable tell him to buzz off and then the onus is on you to avoid contact with him the onus is on you to make sure you're not in a room alone with him that's the what part of that is empowered as a clown and he'd noticed he said his wife was in their mid-teens which so she was what 14 15 16 years old and this guy's constantly sexually assaulting her at work he puts that as a if example of come up what's the big deal everybody played was my wife's press when she was a teenager everybody played with my mom's breasts what's the big deal man they just brushed it off but even if you don't think that's a big deal and there's something really weird and off about you if you don't think that's a big deal but remember that those things often lead to the guy not buzzing off but being encouraged that no cops were called and that there were no real consequences and leading to much more serious things he reminds me of the Roy Moore story where he kept hitting on a teenager who was a waitress at a restaurant he used to frequent and then one day he tricked her into getting in the car according to the allegations and this started ripping her clothes off or forcing her head down onto his lap oh well there goes your buzz off strategy dennis prager what a brilliant thing that was hey dennis prager if somebody comes and punches you in the face why don't you just tell them to buzz off what's the big deal man up Dennis man up what if oh god these days when everybody wants to go to the police and actually press charges on assault or attempted rape on the good old days we just spit on it right I remember those days our coach was tell us you get hurt just spit on it right now I don't want anybody punching tennis Praeger I don't want anybody doing anything physical but these guys they're abhorrent I knew that they would go to the bottom of the barrel and immediately they're like what's I mean he's basically saying so he pinned her down tried to rip off her bathing suit held her mouth closed down while his friend turned up the volume so they couldn't hear her screams what's the big deal why don't you just tell them to buzz off that's who Ted is fragrance any right winger who looks up to dennis prager I feel sick to my stomach for you because they're so embarrassing that's the intellectual of the right-wing pathetic so uh finally another part of his op-ed I guess touches on what he thinks if these allegations are true even if true what happened to her was clearly wrong but it tells us nothing about Brett Kavanaugh since the age of 17 but for the record I don't believe her story it the whole setup is who cares if it's true at the very very end he says by the way of course I don't believe her sir why on what basis do you not believe her story so for example we explained in the beginning we don't know more evidence came out and then we explained hey listen she talked to our therapist the therapist wrote down the notes in 2012-2013 that's a good reason to believe her there's least some evidence it's hard to know what happened on that day we're trying to have a reasonable assessment of the facts scenario his reasonable assisted a believer but so what if it happen so what if he tried to rape a 15 year old what's the big deal wow that is quite intellectual of you so there's one final component to this story and you know I'm sure that there are more smears happening as we speak as we do this video but there was an individual who appeared on CNN her name is Carrie Severino and she's with the judicial crisis Network the same you know group that we talked about earlier and she had an interesting way of describing the allegations take a look her allegations cover a whole range of conduct from from boorishness and and to ruff horseplay to actual attempted rape and so obviously if you go to if you go to go to rape yes that's it that is it that is a really serious allegation it's gonna I don't think anywhere in there she's saying this is boorish horseplay at all in her life I think that's at all she's certainly implying that it's attempted rape but I think you have to look at if there's there's a 35 years of memory that we're trying to play with here and I'm saying that the just the behavior she described could be a Terp it could describe a whole range of things I don't hurt I know her perception of it was what it was one way I'm just saying I think I think we have to get all of the facts that said Judge Cavanaugh says this didn't happen at all so under any interpretation he says no that I was not in a party like that this didn't happen Wow Carrie you really need to work on your spin you know skills because you were really struggling there weren't you yeah well because they have to have a woman go out and say it so they're like hey hair you drew the short straw go out and defend attempted rape well how are we gonna do that well look you're gonna have the range of options so that you don't seem like the worst person on earth you don't seem like your dennis prager but in there you're gonna inject talking points and we're gonna test them out remembered your district rice network as we explained earlier funded by these huge and it's all secret corporate and and and really rich donors who want Cavanaugh on the court for their own financial purposes and so they're like hey listen you're paid to do this for us so describe the attempted rape as quote rough horseplay and what they do is they send out somebody to do that first and then if it works and people like it then they repeat it and then it becomes a talking point oh it's just rough horseplay it was just rough horseplay and you'll see it over and over and over again that was them testing it up I Got News for you that test didn't work so it is you could tell from the reaction of the anchor at the time who's kind of taken aback by it the reaction online our reaction any decent person's reaction you could have left it at hey it's so hard to know what happened on that day thirty five years ago no you had to inject that talking point and when you characterized attempted rape and covering a woman's mouth while trying to rip her clothes off is rough horseplay well it harkens back to well that's not torture that's just you know enhanced interrogation and those aren't detention centers what were they calling them family residences or something along those lines so no it's not rough horseplay and and it's sick that you're being paid to say that to see if you guys can get people to believe that it wasn't what it actually was well apparently according to the allegations in America you can pay anyone to say anything doesn't matter thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a
