the French news agency AFP has found itself being targeted on Twitter for publishing Swedish environmental research with suggests having one less child could reduce people's carbon footprint it generated a ream of sarcastic angry tweets in response well the news agency distance itself from the research pointing out that it was simply reporting the information of others people in Paris shared their thoughts with us about the study I don't think we should stop having children just for the sake of the environment I think it's a rather moronic thing to say I've find this idea shocking personal choice I will not allow anyone to come and tell me mister you have three kids that's too much you should have just one or none at all to save the planet as beyond the pale you can't just tell people hey stop making babies that's enough those who said that must have smoked weed or something it's not normal what about our freedom what kind of country can imagine its future a green future with no kids I mean we might as well all stop breathing and make a green planet once again but then there would be no more human beings of course this is shocking because I do think that definitely the French love their children they like children and in no way will you be convincing them that they have to reduce their carbon footprint or be more environmentally friendly that means having less kids I think that's the worst argument that you can you can expose if you want to defend the environment today why is the AFP not talking about pollution in France by major French corporations those are real issues if you want to reduce pollution in France today French people are concerned by the environment but telling them all of a sudden that the solution of one of the ideas could be having less children or comparing major countries which are polluting with just French families having kids is I would really say preposterous this makes no sense and I today should be quite a shame of what it did you
