we have a special guest he is running in Wisconsin's first District to unseat Paul Ryan the Speaker of the House it's Randy Bryce known as the iron stats Randy how are you good how are you doing I'm good oh it's good to see you all right fantastic now I talked with you a couple weeks ago on my the Jimmy Dore show it was I made me feel a lot better about you I didn't know anything about you until I talked to you and everywhere and so you're a real progressive do you view supported Bernie Sanders in the primary correct in 2016 absolutely he the union I belong to the ironworkers they came out and supported Hillary before the primary and he called me up I was actually on a construction site working on a Northwestern Mutual Tower downtown Milwaukee and he invited me to speak at his rally and I didn't hesitate to I said yes absolutely I would I'd love to and I thought you know here's a presidential candidate calling a construction worker on a job site at his lunch break and not only that but he asked if they were if there were any picket lines around where he could you know actually go walk a picket line so when I get a presidential candidate not only inviting me to to go and and say a few words that his his rally but also somebody that's interested in walking on a picket line you better believe I'm gonna get behind somebody like that and help support him okay yeah I mean that and so Bernie's also returned the favor correct he's endorsed you he has and and we had an amazing rally this past Saturday he came in to Racine thousands of people showed up we packed it there were two overflow rooms both of those were filled it was an amazing amount of energy and then we grab a bite to eat afterwards invited some local activists a couple blocks away so it's yeah we both been we both been in touched so now is Paul Ryan is he nervous as your campaign making him nervous is that kind of energy is there any signs that he's nervous oh they think swings at us every week on a weekly basis they come after us and everybody else is raised but like for the last decade I've tried to help them at least get him started when they wanted to run against Paul Ryan he hasn't had a serious challenger since he's been in its be going on 20 years congressman mark Pocan has called their campaign the first serious challenge he's ever had to face so when they came out swinging I mean within first two weeks after we launch our video and it's been pretty constant since then it shows that they are scared they have every reason to be concerned so now when I talked to you last time you confirm to me that you are strongly for a lot of progressive positions for instance you're for Medicare for all correct correct and you're for a $15 minimum wage right and freak state college correct correct okay so those would be big issues and those are hard for most Democrats to answer those questions right so want to talk about access to health care or access to education which is not the same thing as what you're supporting so right you know you're probably gonna have to fight against your own party to get those things done right so are you propose a lot of people have told us a lot of Democrats have said that they're for those things Barack Obama famously saying he was gonna help unions and he was gonna put on a comfortable shoe and he was phased he wouldn't pass a bill that didn't have a public option and he let us down on all those things so how can we tell something to the audience of progressives so they can believe that you're gonna actually do what you say you're gonna do well these are things that we I was just informed earlier today the d-triple-c came out and they're advising candidates not to not to be so much in favor of Medicare for all and I was asked if that's going to change my opinion and my answer is no that's part of the reason I mean we said where we we stood very early on in our campaign and when it comes to things like not taking any money from Wall Street not taking any money from the fossil fuel industry support of Medicare for all is something that I'm gonna stand up for strong and it's because of standing up strong that I feel that that we are being so successful I mean our fundraising numbers have been phenomenal and that's as a result you know last year or last quarter 74 percent of every contribution that came in was under two hundred dollars and that's 1.2 million dollars a lot of money coming in and small increments and and that's the same thing that's something else I see in common with senator Sanders campaign that I took from him is to tell people where you stand from early on and and don't fall back from that I think that's that we're missing too much in politics these days or people that are saying one thing then when they go to DC they do something else and I'm not a career politician this is all I know is you know I've been here for the past 20 years while Paul Ryan's been getting to know the lobbyists billionaires and special interests in DC I've been back here struggling with my neighbors and my neighbors are the ones that are gonna send me there and we're gonna find some other line of work for Paul Ryan to get into all right well you know we we support that effort certainly now you had you do have an opponent in the primary Cathy Meyers now correct me if I'm wrong did she didn't support Bernie in the primary rights it was she a Hillary person in the primary I believe she ran as a to be a Hillary delegate right okay but would you consider her progressive also all right do you see progressive to me absolutely she she has said that you won't debate her is that true that's absolutely false we've stated several times that when it when we see the names you know who's gonna be on the ballot where we're willing to debate everybody that's on that that's gonna be on the ballot we look forward to something like this well okay yeah okay I mean I think a good Democrat to progressives debating would be fantastic Souter but the thing is right now is that we don't even know for sure what the what the lines are gonna be like we're waiting to see - part of the reason is you know somebody else gonna get in we got in early to try to build up as much momentum as we can but we don't know what the if the lines are gonna change with the the court coming before the Supreme Court as well okay so so you know progressives I'm in touch with the progressive community and which is why I wanted to get you one because a lot of them were suspect of you and I'm like well Bernie's endorsing him and he endorsed Bernie and he's for these things why are you still suspect of him progressives that's what I'm saying to them and they say back to me that you are when you announce that a lot of corporate Democrats immediately backed you people like David Brock for instance so sure Blue Peter Dow joy and read near a Tandon even tweeted support for you now is that just because they want to get rid of Paul Ryan because there's certainly a allergic to progressive policies right no I I I think I've communicated with Nero I've you know I've seen her on on a late night show and I sent a message you know I think I thought you did well I'm as far as handling subjects but I've never talked to David Brock I know sure blue put some of our stories out I see that as people just wanted to get behind us to to get rid of Paul Ryan because for our campaign to work and to go after somebody like Paul Ryan I don't see this as you know like haven't necessarily burning people Hillary people it's all Randy people and and we're coming together that was that was the vision I had is let's let's do this like we're driving a car we keep I our eyes on the road in front of us look back the rearview mirror every once in a while but let's stay focused on the road that's that's gonna take us to victory Randy Bryce the iron stashed running to unseat Paul Ryan in the first district in
