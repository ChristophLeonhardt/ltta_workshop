IT WAS ONLY THERE TO SPY FOR
POLITICAL REASONS AND TO HELP
CRICKET HILLARY WHEN THAT, JUST
LIKE THEY DID TO BERNIE SANDERS,
WHO GOT DUPED.
CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGS FROM
ARIZONA IS ONE OF THE HOUSE
REPUBLICANS CALLING FOR A SECOND
SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE
THE FBI AND DOJ POSSIBLE
MISCONDUCT.
HE JOINS US NOW LIVE.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
TONIGHT.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
>> Shannon: YOU PUT TOGETHER A
LENGTHY REVOLUTION WHICH I HAVE
READ AND FOLKS CAN FIND IT
ONLINE, I THINK THEY WOULD FIND
IT INTERESTING TO GO THROUGH THE
FACTS YOU OUTLINED TO NOT ONLY
THE HILLARY CLINTON
INVESTIGATION BUT YOU MENTION
URANIUM ONE, THE CLINTON
FOUNDATION, HOW WILL THOSE
THINGS WERE ALL HANDLED.
AN INVESTIGATION TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE FISA
WARRANT.
WRAP IT ALL UP BY SAYING IT
WARRANTS A SECOND SPECIAL
COUNSEL.
ARE YOU GOING TO GET ONE?
>> I HOPE WE WILL.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED FOR ONE.
BESIDES HIM, WE HAVE BEEN ASKING
FOR TEN MONTHS.
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIAL
COMMITTEE, TREY GOWDY.
TWO MEMBERS OF OUR LEADERSHIP,
THE MAJORITY LEADER, KEVIN
McCARTHY, STEVE SCALISE, THE
MAJORITY WHIP.
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE GETTING ON
THIS AND IT HAS TAKEN TEN
MONTHS.
SOME OF US GOT ON A LITTLE EARLY
BUT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT
THIS UNRAVELS, IT'S LIKE IT
CHINESE GRIP TORTURE.
YOU FEEL IT AND WE ARE SEEING
SOMETHING NEW ALMOST EVERY WEEK
INCLUDING NOW THE SPYING AND
THAT TYPE OF THING.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T TRUST
US ANYMORE.
MOST PEOPLE NOW BELIEVE IT WAS
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, AS I HAVE
FELT FROM THE BEGINNING.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL APPOINTED.
>> Shannon: THIS THURSDAY WE
ARE TOLD THERE'S GOING TO BE A
MEETING THAT WILL INVOLVE SEVEN
DIFFERENT PLAYERS.
CHAIRMAN NUNES AND GERMAN GOT IT
WILL BE INVOLVED WE UNDERSTAND
ALONG WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE
DOJ.
AND OTHERS WHO WILL GET TOGETHER
AND LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION
WITH RESPECT TO THE SOURCE FOR
THIS INDIVIDUAL OR THIS
INFORMANT.
HERE IS WHAT SENATE MINORITY
LEADER DEMOCRAT CHUCK SCHUMER
HAD TO SAY TODAY ABOUT THOSE
KINDS OF MEETINGS.
>> A MAN LIKE DEVIN NUNES, WHO I
HEAR PRIVATELY FOR MY REPUBLICAN
COLLEAGUES, THEY THINK HE'S OFF
THE DEEP END AND HE'S GOING TO
GET HOLD OF THIS?
AND WE THINK THAT'S FOR FAIR
UNBIASED OVERSIGHT?
GIVE ME A BREAK.
IF SUCH A MEETING OCCURS, AND I
DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD, BUT IF
IT OCCURS, IT MUST BE BIPARTISAN
IT OCCURS, IT MUST BE BIPARTISA
BIPARTISAN.
>> Shannon: WOULD YOU BE FOR
DEMOCRATS ATTENDING THAT MEETING
ON THURSDAY?
>> I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED
ABOUT DEMOCRATS GETTING IN THERE
TO BEGIN WITH.
FIRST OF ALL DEVON HAS TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME
WITH.
THEY HAVE TOLD US TIME AND TIME
AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING AND THEN IT TURNS OUT
THEY WILL JUST SAY IT CONTAINS
THIS CORE CONTAINS THAT, OR THEY
GIVE US SOMETHING HEAVILY
REDACTED THAT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.
SO I THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATS
ARE IN THE DEEP END ON THIS ONE,
NOT DEVIN NUNES.
AND IF DEVIN FINDS THAT THERE
SOMETHING WARRANTED I HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL BE
INVOLVED AND BEGIN ON THE SAME
INFORMATION.
THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY GOING
TO MAKE IT?
THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST.
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THEY
WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT
THE REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY
ABOUT CHAIRMAN NUNES.
PLENTY OF LEAKS AROUND
WASHINGTON.
CONGRESSMAN SAYS THIS TODAY.
WHEN THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORIES
FALL APART THEY HAVE NO PLACE
ELSE TO TURN.
THIS HAS BEEN THE MAJORITY'S GO
TO MOVE.
THIS RESOLUTION SHOWS A PROFOUND
MISUNDERSTANDING OF OUR CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM.
YOU ARE A LAWYER.
IS THIS A PROFOUND
MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM?
>> I JUST HEARD HIM SAY
YESTERDAY THAT MR. MUELLER IS A
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
THAT INDICATES THAT HE DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
MR. MUELLER IS NOT A SPECIAL
PROSECUTOR.
HE IS A SPECIAL COUNSEL.
HE IS APPOINTED AND HE'S GIVEN
SOME AUTHORITY.
IT'S LIMITED IN SCOPE.
THEY WILL TELL US WHAT'S IN THE
SCOPE.
THEY HAVE REDACTED THAT.
BUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE TODAY AS
THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE AND
INSTEAD WE ARE NOT YOUR SPECIAL
COUNSEL, WE ARE EMPLOYEES OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND GIVE
US SPECIAL PROSECUTOR STATUS,
AND WHY IS THAT?
IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO
BE LIMITED IN SCOPE TO WHAT THEY
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE, AND THAT IS
WAS THEIR LESSON COLLUSION TO
INFLUENCE THE ELECTION.
THEY ARE WAY BEYOND THAT AND HE
KNOWS THAT.
>> Shannon: A FEDERAL JUDGE
NOW HAS THAT SCOPE MEMO ON
REDACTED.
WE WILL WATCH AND SEE IF YOU AS
