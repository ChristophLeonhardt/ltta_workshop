00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,879
hey everybody its Jake Tapper from CNN's
State of the Union in fact-checked

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,299
Oregon this week we're gonna take a look
at comments made by President Trump and

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,110
Attorney General Jeff Sessions when
describing the program known as daca

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,500
which stands for deferred action on
childhood arrivals

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,439
it's an Obama era program that
temporarily proffered protections for

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,150
undocumented immigrants who were brought
to the United States when they were

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,480
children as you know Trump in sessions
this week announced that they were

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,340
rescinding the program take a listen to
how they described it let's start with

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,719
attorney general sessions the daca
program was implemented in 2012 and

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,100
essentially provided a legal status for
recipients for a renewable two-year term

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,590
worker authorization and other benefits
including participation in the Social

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,520
Security program to 800,000 mostly adult
illegal aliens and President Trump made

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,780
a similar point when talking during a
meeting on tax reform I have a great

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,900
heart for the folks we're talking about
a great love for them and people think

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,460
in terms of children but they're really
young adults so is that true what

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,580
President Trump and attorney general
sessions are saying how they're

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,320
describing recipients of daca is it true
that the recipients are as Trump said

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,320
really young adults or a session said
quote 800,000 mostly adult illegal

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,520
aliens yes that is true the individuals
in question who benefit from DAC a daca

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,869
deferred action on childhood arrivals
are mostly adults and they are

21
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,299
undocumented immigrants but in their
descriptions both the president and the

22
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,820
Attorney General are leaving out a very
important bit of context which is that

23
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,740
these individuals were brought to the
United States when they were children

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,020
through no fault of their own daca which
is now in its fifth year is open to

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,450
those who are at least 15 years old and
no more than 31 years old as of June

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,580
15th 2012 to be eligible for daca
individuals had to prove that they were

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,710
under the age of 16 when they arrived in
the United States

28
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,740
and that they had been living in the
u.s. continuously since June 15 2007 a

29
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,390
professor at UC San Diego Tom Wong
oversaw a national survey last month of

30
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,760
more than 3,000 daca holders and he
found that although 98% of them are

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,120
currently adults over the age of 18
most of them fifty-four percent were

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,270
under the age of seven when they arrived
in the United States in fact the average

33
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:47,090
age of a daca recipient when coming to
the United States was six and a half so

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,940
here's the bottom line the comments by
President Trump and attorney general

35
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,680
sessions when describing the recipients
of daca are technically true they are

36
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,360
mostly adults but they leave out such an
important part of the context of who

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,130
these individuals are that they were
brought here as children that we are

38
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,140
judging those statements to be
misleading a reminder to all you

39
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,190
politicians out there you are perfectly
entitled to your own opinions not to

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,220
your own facts
