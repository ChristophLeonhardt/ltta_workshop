/ ben go check it out let them know that we sent you okay so Hillary will never ever ever go away ever okay so there's a new article in Politico today about how Hillary may want to run for president for a third time now I think that folks on the right are a little bit you saying what about this thing they figure okay Trump beat her last time he'll beat her again this time and let's face it Hillary's a garbage candidate you should say smoking garbage sheet of a candidate the reason that President Trump is president is yes because he has a certain skillset right this kind of skillset that makes him dangerous to people like you but president Trump's skillset is not the actual reason that he is president alone it is because Hillary Clinton is the worst candidate in the history of American politics how do I know this because she lost to Donald Trump in a race for the presidency and she won by two and a half million votes in the popular vote still so all the folks who are being sanguine what's really funny is you see folks on the right and they say things like well silly Hillary didn't even visit Wisconsin didn't even visit Michigan the implication being that if she had visited Wisconsin or Michigan she would have won which is to suggest that maybe that option was really really really razor thin close now it is true that President Trump will now have a very good economic record to run on it is also true that a lot of folks just didn't show up to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Donald Trump won fewer votes in Wisconsin in 2016 than Mitt Romney won in 2012 Romney lost the state by something like eight points Hillary lost the state of Wisconsin no one likes Hillary Clinton but because no one likes her a lot of people thought that she was gonna run away with it and just didn't show up to vote for her there was no enthusiasm it's like okay I'm not gonna ruin my day New York Times says there's a 99 percent shot she's gonna be President anyway why am I gonna bother if she were to come back I'm not quite as sanguine as everybody else that it ends in a radical defeat for her I think Democrats show up in large numbers in a sort of revenge play I think that's it that's a significant possibility that said would Trump prefer her to some of the other candidates who are out there no question I mean he's she she's a person he knows how to handle she's got more baggage than any national airline that you care to speak of and she is truly truly awful at what she does still she won't go away because the minute she goes away she can't make money on her other lucrative side gigs if you look at the donations to the Clinton Foundation incredibly donations to the Clinton Foundation dropped precipitously as soon as she was no longer running for president because that's how things work in Clinton land if she is not relevant to the national political discourse the money train dries up so a bunch of folks on the Democratic side are trying to basically say to her stick around but trying to go away so Michael avenatti my favorite of the 20 20 Democratic presidential contenders and I'm rude I'm openly rooting for Michael avenatti yeah I've made this absolutely clear I root for entertainment value right if the outcomes gonna be what the outcomes gonna be I'm not god I can't control the outcome I can tell you how I think you should go vote but if I'm rooting for a candidate make it Michael avenatti guys need Democrats just like an avenatti Trump race would just be the great the first question in debate would be which one of you slept with stormy Daniels more times like that would be an actual question in a presidential debate and I'm all for it I mean were there man let's embrace embrace the hurricane embrace the suck like let's just do this thing Michael avenatti here's what he had to say about Hillary Clinton and this article in Politico he says if I was running I could see certain circumstances in which she could be helpful from a rally perspective in certain locations on a limited basis to say like stay away Hillary stay far far away says I think there's still a lot of people that support her and for that reason she could certainly play a positive role in some capacity in Swansea 20 this is like the question in a job interview where they ask you to name your worst quality and you're desperately trying to think of your worst quality and name so saying like name a good thing about Hillary Clinton he's like maybe she'd be good at like standing there sometimes so that is pretty great but that is not dissuading anybody in the Hillary Clinton camp from thinking that maybe she's so so Philippe reigns who is just a jerk so Philippe brands has been known for years legitimately two decades as Hillary's fixer and he's a nasty guy and he attacks his opponents with aplomb and alacrity here is what he says about Hillary Clinton he says chalking the loss up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification nope it is not she is a giant fail she lost to Barack Obama a nobody an absolute nobody in 2008 with the entire media behind her at the beginning of that race and then she nearly lost to Bernie Sanders a septuagenarian crazy loon bag socialist who was tossed out of a calm you in the 70s were being too useless she almost lost to that guy in primaries and then she lost to a real estate developer whose main claim to fame is saying you're fired on national television and running a Miss USA stick like that that's that's legitimately who she lost to so I don't think it's an oversimplification to say that she is the worst candidate you could possibly imagine like if you were creating a bad candidate in a lab that cans it would look exactly like Hillary Clinton but rain says she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most and it was an absolute fight to the death he's and then he was asked will Hillary run he says the likelihood is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it's not zero so everywhere Democrats you can hear the shrieks of Democrats through the walls here in fact are leftist here's hot or cold tumblr is overflowing because even Democrats understand that Hillary Clinton running for president is a bad bad idea the problem is the Democrats have actually set up the narrative for her to run this is the part that's really fascinating is that the Democrats are now trying to run again their war on women playbook from 2012 and they're doing it in a more intense way now now Hillary would be a very bad fit for that playbook except that Democrats are out of their minds so she'd be a bad fit for the war on women playbook because she legitimately fought a war on every woman that her husband harassed abused slept with I she she literally did that for a solid 15 to 20 years of her career but because she is woman we must hear her roar and you can see that the radical feminists are out enforced they think that this is their time when I say radical feminists I mean radical feminists the best radical feminist piece of the day comes courtesy of Tory truesight over at Slate comm the repository for much of American stupidity is the actual title of the piece the rage of all women okay there's a quote from the piece this isn't me being homophobic there's a quote from a piece man-hating Dyke is the worst thing you can call a lesbian but in the me to era it's time to reclaim it okay what do you mean Tori truesight well she will tell you in the wake of the Cavanagh hearings a dyke friend in her 20s posted that real talk she doesn't like men I hit the like button superfast feeling secretive and sort of guilty about it she'd come through the same radical queer and trans circles I came up in and in that clique I felt relieved to acknowledge an obvious truth most men treat women like something less than human whether accidentally or on purpose and that means it's hard to like them men are bad men are evil solid political argument I can see that you're aiming for political victory here by immediately alienating half the population I had recently been scanning the men coming into my workplace wondering about their histories of sexual assault yeah it's a normal thing to do that's a real normal thing to do send you how often have you done that at the office you just walk in you're like I wonder who here has raped someone okay so I stand corrected seniya says she does this every day in any case this woman says is he a rapist what about him where does he fall on the creep scale it was an old impulse that had returned in force as the nation debated just how many of their husbands brothers and Sons were perpetrators given that one in three American women experienced sexual violence in their lifetimes okay again that is a very very vague definition of sexual violence if you're suggesting that one in three women in America is raped over the course of her life that is just not if that is not a true statistic that is just a false statistic she's Republicans insisted that men were the ones who should be afraid while women were counted the everyday heroine ways we reroute our lives to avoid assault my woke male co-workers made me two jokes as if the whole thing were a funny spectacle it was enough to make me want to stop talking to men entirely I have a feeling that the feeling was mutual yet still inside my head then not all men chorus roared what about the dads of two who liked all my angry tweet or the guy who showed up at the hospital with too much food when my spouse was in labor or my friends who our trans men that's where it gets really confusing when you actually of a woman who said she's a man I'm supposed to hate her for being a man or I supposed to like her for being a woman this is when things get really baffling for folks on left patriarchy runs so deep that I defend hypothetical men's feelings right away even to myself I am a married lesbian as far away from needing male approval as a woman can get and I still feel it the slow poisonous drip of cultural conditioning that tells me to prioritize men actually that cultural conditioning says you might want to treat human beings like you know individual human beings because they're human beings just my imagination that thing that could break us out of American fascism your imagination is not going to break anybody out of anything I mean it's not gonna break you out of the asylum lady she says it's trapped in an old feminists loop because I've been trained the worst thing I can is a man-hating Dyke but it's time to confront the latent homophobia in that insult is not late in homophobia it's an actual just homophobic against kotha latent about that and she says in our fear that anger makes us seem too gay because anger not fear is precisely the emotion that's needed these days beware the person who says that anger is the proper response to your life the people who say that anger is the proper response to the generalized situation in your life that person is not giving you good advice my friend Andrew Clavin has a great phrase he says anger is the devil's cocaine I think that is basically correct I think that if you are looking at your life and you don't have a specific instance of injustice to point to you just have a generalized outrage about the world you're going to fail in life a great way to fail in life is to sink yourself into a generalized feeling that you will never be able to succeed especially in a free country it's one thing to say that in a dictatorship but this is the freest country in world history hey I mean this lady is writing a piece about how much she hates men in the pages of a national newspaper basically and probably being championed for it by a bunch of folks on the Left the radical feminist movement is in full swing and this is why Hillary Clinton could still come back because it would be easy for Hillary to say the real reason I lost was radical sexism and then try and drive out single women to the polls and high numbers to take revenge against Donald Trump I'm gonna get more into this in just one second but first let's talk about a sponsor who's been in the news recently 23andme so elizabeth warren recently took a DNA test it was really good that she did because it revealed that she is whiter than the backside of this piece of paper and she's incredibly incredibly white I mean she makes Marky Mark look like MC Hammer like that Elizabeth Warren is an incredibly white person and she knows that because she took a DNA test showing that she's one 1,020 fourth white well if you are interested in actually checking out your own ancestry ancestry and finding out whether you in fact are less white than Elizabeth Warren the way that Lindsey Graham is doing right now check out 23andme it's a DNA testing service can offer insights into your ancestry health wellness and traits it gives you a bitter taste report versus sweet and salty reports they can tell you how DNA plays a role in determining food preference sweeped reports they can tell you if you are more likely to be an especially deep sleeper they give you a saturated fat and weight report telling you based on your genetics how your weight might be affected by saturated fats in your diet order your 23andme health and ancestry service kit at 23andme comm slash capiro that's the number 23andme calm slash apparel everybody's doing it it's the hot new thing make sure that you like Elizabeth Warren know your ancestry 23andme calm slash appear oh don't be caught up short when you claim Native American ancestry but have no evidence to prove it go to 23andme comm slash Shapiro and check it out right now honestly they're having a great week over 23andme like really this is it great week to advertise so the the anger that has broken out on the radical feminist left is good for Hillary Clinton obviously it's also good for folks like Kamala Harris on the intersectionality scale radical feminists are trying to push women up that scale right now there's a philosophy that I've talked about a lot on the show on the left that says that we can prioritize people's viewpoints based on their genetics based on their ancestry based on their ethnicity based on their class so basically here's how this hierarchy goes of views that we should respect it goes it goes like this LGBTQ person black person Hispanic person woman Asian person Jewish person white person that's how it goes that's the hierarchy and women are somewhere in the middle as I mentioned right they're kind of behind Hispanic but ahead of Asia right that's where women are so what radical feminists are trying to do is elevate women in the hierarchy of victimhood higher up the ladder and that way folks like Hillary Clinton have a better shot at being elected by claiming victimhood this is why it's because women aren't high enough on the intersectionality scale that you saw Elizabeth Warren trying to claim Native American ancestry because she was saying it's not enough for me to be a woman in Democratic primary I also have to claim membership in a historically victimized group and also a Native American that of course fell apart for her what so if you can't if you can't beat the intersectionality course he joined the intersectionality course radical feminists are trying to elevate women as victims in American society and so this this woman it's late as crazy as she sounds the story truesight who says that she wants to be a one that she basically wants to be part of the she woman man haters Club like the reverse of the of the gang from from alfalfa you know she when she says this this is not actually that far out of the realm of the mainstream in certain democratic circles I love this here's another example Carolyn hacks is an advice columnist over at the Washington Post and there's a letter here's the letter dear Carolyn I have a daughter and some other moms have daughters and I have started getting together at a local playground at a set time each week recently a mom of a boy brought her son to the playground at the same time we were there I asked her nicely I thought if she would mind leaving because we had wanted it to be a girl's only time she refused and seemed too angry at me if she comes back is there a better way I can approach the approach her this has been such a sweet time for moms and daughters and having a boy there is naturally going to change things we live in a world where boys get everything and girls are left with crumbs and I wouldn't think this mom would realize that but she seems to think her son is entitled to crash this girl's only time I know I can't legally keep her from a public park but can I appeal to her better nature and then the response was shooing off the mom and her boy it was terrible but I have to admit that I actually have a little bit of sympathy for the mom not in the sense that you should show off the boys but boys do change the dynamic when girls are playing I have a son I have a daughter they play very very differently when boys go to a girl's only group of changes the dynamic boys are different than girls radical feminists want to have it both ways boys and girls are exactly the same but girls are different from boys and therefore should be separated off from boys when they want to be separated off from boys I think that we should recognize some truths boys and girls are different also we live in a free country and because we live in a free country people should be able to rise and fall on their own merit without claiming victimization at the hands of the free society in world history okay so is Hillary Clinton gonna run again I highly doubt it I don't think she's going to but maybe she will who the hell knows okay meanwhile President Trump he did a rally last night and his rallies are usually highly entertaining his nickname Azula and you know his rallies are basically stand-up comedy routines the president doesn't rally like President Obama would go out and make a stump speech the president goes out there and he just riffs for an hour and it's usually very entertaining it a lot of folks have been to president Trump's rallies they say it's a lot of fun obviously the crowd is there to have a good time it really is kind of half a political rally and half a comedy routine because Trump is a highly entertaining human well sometimes that has upsides and sometimes that has downsides because like all comedians when President Trump gets a riffin sometimes the riff is good and sometimes he is just going to put his foot so far down his mouth that it comes out his colon and out his rear end and back around again sometimes he creates an or or burrows of human physicality so here is the good sometimes you see President Trump do stuff like this like this is kind of funny so president Trump there's a woman in the crowd and she shouts I love you and here as president Trump's response wise guys the Democrats have turned I love you too who said who said that it's finally a woman you know I get it from the men all the time so far every guy that said I love you they're just not my type I finally heard it from a woman thank you I think about this funny stuff that's funny stuff and there he will break that down all it's cuz he's sexist and it's because he's funny okay that's a funny thing to say that's a funny thing to say the problem is because the president is actually a performer you know Donald Trump is a performer he spends his entire life being a performer as someone who performs on stage I know what it's like you played to the crowd the crowd that's in front of you responds with cheers and they respond with boos and respond with laughter and you're constantly trying to keep them hooked and president Trump even said this when he was just candidate Trump he would say that he'd go to a rally and if he was on his stump speech and his 3/4 of the way through a speech and people looked bored he would just start saying build the wall because he got people all jazzed up but he actually says that he performs like a performer well the problem is that when you perform like a performer the president doesn't actually have a fully functional brain to mouth filter like that filter is is pretty shoddy hey whatever starts here ends up here and it doesn't matter what started there is one of the Pres one of the good things about the presidents why he's authentic well people like authenticity and politics the reason he's authentic feeling is because he's authentic in the same way that my four and a half year old is authentic she thinks it it comes out that's the way it is like there's no pretense that's good in politics because it's honest right you get the feeling that he's honest even what like even the stuff that Trump says that it's dishonest feels honest because he actually believes it at the time people say that Trump is just going out there and he's lying he's prevaricated Donald Trump believes everything that Donald Trump says that doesn't mean every Donald Trump says is right or factual but it is authentic so that's the good side of Trump the problem is sometimes the thoughts that go through the head should not come out the mouth and that happened yesterday twice actually so he was talking about Greg Ginn fourth who is the Montana congressman and and I guess chin fort was at this rally and the president decides you know it'd be a great idea to praise that time that congressman jian fort body-slammed reporter so if you all recall back to the 2016 campaign there is a situation in which a reporter confronts a dredge in for his like two nights before the election and june 4 cup man and he went full Macho Man Randy Savage on him right he went full Undertaker he like grabbed him by the neck and he slammed him to the ground and this is caught on tape and then he had to plead guilty to a misdemeanor president Trump thinks you know what I'm in front of a crowd I've done WWE before let's talk about this thing you know this is an issue that really needs to be out on the table two years later let's do this so here's President Trump and the only reason I'm smiling is because this is the world we have chosen this is the business we have chosen as Hyman Roth says okay we're here we can't go back I'm only smiling because I'm smiling like that guy in the Survivor Jeff never seen the survivor Jeff the Tom line where is it where it's a bunch of women who are standing in the foreground and they don't know a piece of news and the guy the background knows the piece of news and all the women start getting very upset they start crying and the man in the background just starts smiling broadly that's me about politics right now I know all this is going to happen and if you've been watching you know all this is going to happen so all of the tears in the suffering like that's just because you didn't know it was gonna happen but if you've been watching you know what was going to happen what were the chances that Trump wasn't going to mention G in 40 bodies body slamming a reporter if Greg Jian Forte's in front of him what were the chances zero percent negative 100% I'm just shocked that Trump hasn't flown in G and 4k is an actual rally mascot does that mean that it's a smart move no it turns out it's an unbelievably dumb move and I'll discuss in a second what Trump said and why it was an incredibly dumb move and why entertaining the crowd in front of you is not always the smartest thing when there are cameras present in the room actually speaking to the crowd in front of you you are speaking to everyone who can see you on the TV but we'll talk about that in just a second first let's talk about your second Amendment rights when the founders crafted the Constitution the very first thing they did was to make sacred rights the in sacred the rights of the individual to share their ideas the second thing they did was say you need a right to bear arms to protect that first right Bravo Company manufacturing believes the same thing BCM was started in a garage by marine vets more than two decades ago to build a professional-grade product that meets combat standards BCM believes the same level of protection should be provided to every American regardless of whether they're a private citizen or a professional BCM is not a sporting arms company they design engineer manufactured life-saving equipment they assume that each rifle leaving their shop will actually be used in a life-or-death situation by a responsible citizen law enforcement officer or a soldier overseas because that's what the Second Amendment is for is to protect you it's not so you can go hunting or target shooting means it's really to protect your life and protect your Liberty each components of a BCM rifle is hand assembled and tested by Americans so a life-saving standard BCM feels a moral responsibility to provide tools that are not going to fail you in a life-saving situation and that's why they also work with leading instructors of marksmanship from top levels of America's Special Ops forces who can teach the skills necessary to defend yourselves to learn more about Bravo company manufacturing head on over to Bravo Company MFG icon these are spectacular dudes I know some of them where you can discover more about their products special offers upcoming news that is Bravo Company MFG calm and go check them out also at youtube.com slash Bravo company USA can learn more about them and the awesome people who make their products again that's Bravo Company MFG dot-com go check them out right now all right so the President of the United States speaking in Missoula I've given enough lead up to this clip here is the president just fresh off his messaging about how the Democrats are engaged in mob politics and violent rhetoric talking about how it's a good thing they do Republican congressman body-slamming reporter yep this is real mm-hmm wait and we endorse Greg very early but I had heard that he body slammed a reporter and he was way up and I said this was like the day of the election or just before and I said oh this is terrible he's going to lose the election then I said well wait minute I know Montana pretty well I think it might help him and it did now he's a great guy tough cookie here's why that's bad so you're trying to make the argument well it's weird me that I have to explain why it's bad when the president of the United States has it's good for people to bodyslam reporters like but I guess that's where we are right now guys you're not supposed to bodyslam anybody in public it'll run private it turns out like violence not good in civilized society bad bad honest to god I punish my two-and-a-half-year-old for pushing his sister okay I would not allow two congressmen for picking up another human and body slamming him by the neck and when you say that like the here it's almost two parts of stupidity what Trump said here so part one is I thought you know I thought it was bad when you bodyslam the gun then I thought well maybe it'll help okay first of all you are now removing the moral component from you shouldn't bodyslam people and then second of all you are saying that your own people the folks who support you are the kinds of people who are enthusiastic about the treatment of by violence of your political opponents in the middle of a giant campaign in which you are tweeting hashtag jobs not mobs why why God why and then the president doubled down on this he challenged Joe Biden and he again makes a reference to June 4 it says not a mistake it's not like it just slipped out now he knows that the crowd cheered for it so because the crowd cheered for it the president has to double down on it very very important that the president makes clear absolutely clear that it has no problem body slamming reporters here he is again sleepy Joe Biden sleepy Joe remember he challenged me to a fight and that was fine and when I said he wouldn't last long he'd be down faster than Greg would take him down he'd be down sofa okay so now the president is saying yeah let's do the fight so it was idiotic when Joe Biden challenged Trump to a fight and now Trump's like yeah let's fight first of all I will admit would I actually like to see a 2020 debate that is just fisticuffs between two eighty year old men you bet your ass I'd love it I would love every second of it they would just get up there they have their walkers they have the tennis balls on the bottom and they just Club each other it would just be great I mean that's it and by the way probably be more articulate than an actual debate between Joe Biden and President ROM like they're actually more political contents than just smacking each other with Walker's than them actually talking politics but is it good that the president again references Jen 40 no it is not it is not because this is immoral behavior okay like I can let for the for the millionth time on this program I can like a lot of President Trump's policy I can a lot of like a lot of what President Trump does I can be inclined to support him in 2020 and I can also think hmm this is stupid and also immoral these things can coexist two things can be true at once because this is reality and the world works that way now President Trump does benefit from the fact that the media are completely insane so instead of the media simply saying you know he's talking about mob politics and Democrats being violent then he goes and he says stuff like this and it's really hypocritical and gross and he shouldn't say that sort of stuff instead of them doing that the direction they go is you know what this is just like the Saudi Arabian government that just took a guy in the Istanbul consulate killed him chopped up his body and then liquefied it when he says that Greg Forte should be body slam that's probably it fits that type of attitude that led the Saudis to believe that they could murder a journalist I'm not making this up this is what members of the media say now because the members of the media are insane and respond so let's say Trump says something that is 100% stupid and then the members of the Democratic Party and the media come back and say something that is four hundred percent stupid folks on the right go see Trump trigger dumb Trump friggin him it's me Trump is really good at triggering them well I don't think it's actual genius I always a tribute to stupidity what I cannot attribute to malice and I think that what we are watching President Trump just saying stuff and then the media being unable to hold themselves back and saying stupid things in response so do I think that this is President Trump manipulating the media into being crazy no I think they're crazy and he drives them crazy and he's good at poking them but they have a unique capacity to pull his chestnuts out of the fire he'll say something and then the media overreaction is so insane there you go I guess I can't side with those people so here is CNN CNN hosts drawing a comparison in a link between President Trump praising Greg Jian Forte and the murder of Jamal khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian government you know stupid you have to be to make this link the Saudi Arabian government has been murdering people since you know their entire existence they've been murdering dissidents and journalists for literally decades but it was only Trump we're just gonna ignore all of his own Trump came around this is the part that's so annoying about the media yes Trump says bad things guess what the world was also a ruff bad place before President Trump was born and before he was president the world didn't start spinning the moment that President Trump was elected Harrison and host though trying to attribute the spike in treatment of bad journalists in places like Saudi Arabia to Trump as the Trump is dictator of Saudi Arabia at that rally last night we'll play it for you the president praised the body slamming I need a guy who can do a body slamming like that so why does it matter well you might think that assaulting a journalist in any circumstance is bad but remember this happens three weeks after the apparent murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the president we should note acknowledge that it certainly looks like this columnist is dead at the same time he refuses to condemn the Saudi regime for this apparent attack okay so if you think that President Trump is okay with the murder of a journalist because he says something stupid about Greg Ginn forté no and if you think that President Trump is suddenly driving press members around the world to be killed because he said like the Russian government needed a cue from us hey I don't remember this sort of talk about President Obama when journalists were being killed all around the world under his watch and journalists were legitimately being killed around the world under his watch but because he didn't say this kind of public stuff there was no linkage well there's still no linkage but Trump says dumb things which is the obvious you know answer to to all of this the worst example of this came courtesy Joaquin Castro one of the Castro brothers who it wants i guess who lien wants to run for president joaquin is just the other role he's the other one and nobody cares about that much and he was on CNN and he suggested that president Trump's administration had literally greenlit the murder of jamal khashoggi by the saudi arabian government and then he was kind of using gin for teh comments as evidence of this to have that clip let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with US intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list to the Crown Prince to NBS in Saudi Arabia and that the Prince then may have acted on that and one of the people that he took action against as Miss Turkish oh gee that didn't happen that's not a thing Jared Kushner did not send a hit list to the Saudi Arabian government and tell him to go murder journalists there's no evidence of this and I like how Joaquin Castro says there's a rumor going around there's a rumor going around that Joaquin Castro dismembers babies and eats them in his backyard I don't have to provide any evidence for this rumor it's just a rumor I heard it around this is why Trump will continue to win so long as people do not treat him with the proper level of objectivity and by the way objectivity does not mean moral censure when he says bad stuff it means that if you respond like a dumbass to his dumbass comments then double dumbass on you right in the words of Star Trek 4 so in a second and we are going to get

the media continue to wildly overreact and blame President Trump for the murder of a Saudi journalist I would like to make one note about this particular topic okay when it comes to the murder of this Saudi journalist couple of things one the people who are most loudly criticizing President Trump for his treatment of the Saudi government are people who are absolutely in the pocket of the Iranians it's members of the the former Obama administration who want the Middle East to be controlled by an Iranian hegemon spreading its power from Afghanistan in the East to Lebanon in the West and South to Yemen it is Obama characters who are saying that Saudi Arabia has to be cut off by the United States now should there be a serious consequences to an allies murder of a journalist of course there should be but I'm not gonna take at face value the complaints from Turkey in actual despotism that has arrested a hundred and fifty thousand dissidents in the last two-and-a-half years I'm not going to take at face value their complaints about human rights and I'm not going to take at face value complaints about human rights from a bunch of people who propped up and gave billions of dollars to the worst Human Rights violator and dictatorship on planet Earth outside of North Korea I'm not going to do that so two things can be true ones don't murder journalists and there should be consequences and also that doesn't mean that we have an that we in the United States have an interest in undermining an alliance with the Saudi Arabians on behalf of the Iranians the way that the Obama administration wanted to do okay you know what I can't handle say more let's just do some mail back let's just do mail back okay fine you know what too much too much of this all right mailbag time Joe says hey Ben who do you think is the favorite to win the Democratic nomination in addition who are some people you think Trump would beat handily in an election who are some people you think he would struggle to beat thanks and love the show okay so in the category of people he would be handily Cory Booker he would mess up Cory Booker right Farda kiss would go down harder than a journalist at the hands of Greg Ginn Forte's the president would say cory booker is mechanical and awful he is awful at his job he is he posed as a moderate and he actually is a radical leftist and he like hillary clinton he's actually like a bad version of a robot he's not even like a good like t1000 from terminator he's like the early version that spaz down a lot and kind of broke down on the battlefield he's he's more like gizmo from some of those old series he's he's not you kit you can see every gear turning for Cory Booker a man who is very bad at jobs her Trump would finish him because Booker is the most inauthentic candidate since Hillary Clinton just terrible candidate I think that Trump would also whomp somebody like Eric Garcetti the LA mayor who pretends to be cool but is actually just a dork so I think Trump would would destroy him pretty quickly um I think that the most dangerous candidate for him would have been Elizabeth Warren if she didn't implode because like frankly I thought she was a lot smarter politically than she is and I was shocked to watch her set herself on fire sending smoke signals to the rest of the world that she didn't know what she was doing and she just sat there and set her TP on fire and I didn't understand why she would do that but she's kind of taken herself out of the smart candidate circle I would say right now of the top Democratic contenders the most dangerous is still Biden because it's hard to destroy a guy who's been in the public eye that long you know when one of the benefits that Trump has is that everybody has an opinion on him which means that nothing that you say about him changes anybody's mind if you say that Donald Trump is bad with women everybody goes right we know yep okay and if you say Donald Trump says things sometimes that are really bad in a moria like well yep we've been here we know and if you say that Donald Trump shot a man on Fifth Avenue we'd all be like well kind of probably okay right like it really is right that was the truest thing Trump ever set the in high name recognition and a history of skeletons in your closet means that it's very difficult to actually destroy somebody politically if they've dealt with the skeletons in their closet and they're obvious about it so Joe Biden has been out there for a long time there's not a lot out there that isn't known about Joe Biden that makes him dangerous also he does have blue-collar appeal in a lot of the states that Trump won places like Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that is sort of Biden territory democratically speaking so Biden would be a dangerous candidate so when Trump says he wants Biden I don't think that's right Kamala Harris I have yet to see so Kamala she is much better at this routine than Cory Booker is she also happens to be somebody her downside is that she has this kind of absolutely clean clean as the driven snow image in a lot of the public mind that she's just a prosecutor a hard-nosed prosecutor asking the tough questions I think when people start digging in to clean characters and politics don't stay clean for long and president Trump is a master of throwing dirt on people's homes he's just great at it so I think he would fare ok against Kamala Harris okay let's see Oh fair says hello Hebrew hammer Shapiro I loved your election special on Fox News will you ever have a permanent show on Fox hashtag Shapiro 57 84 which is 2024 in the Hebrew calendar you know I don't know maybe you know I really enjoyed doing the election special and it was a lot of fun and it's great to be able to do it right before the election we'll see what you know what what comes we will we will find out we'll find out Joel says as the saying goes a way to a man's heart is through his stomach what food does your wife make that falls under this axiom any foods that signal events Wow dude okay so I have to be honest about this my wife has cooked me three meals in the last 10 years that is because my wife wait for it is a doctor that means that she's incredibly busy and she has not actually cooked meals very often at all early in our marriage the way to my heart was through boiling ravioli like it was literally that I just go to the store pick up some prepackaged ravioli and man I miss when I was younger my metabolism was great he's out down like three bags that somebody like legitimately like 35 ravioli in a setting it was pretty spectacular can't do that anymore but whoever said that a man's the way to a man's heart is through his stomach no that's true of like motherly love when it comes to your wife the way to a man's heart is not through his stomach Jordan says hey Ben do you think our prisons should be made public it seems to me having a profit incentive to imprison people is bad and I can't see how the free market helps us in this area well the problem is that every government program also has an incentive to grow name a government program that has shrunk over time every government program that is subsidized by tax dollars ends up growing over time so the government also has an interest in growing the government has an interest in growing the number of people who work for it the number of prisons that are built there is legitimately not one area of American public life that has shrunk over time so if your problem is that the private businesses have an incentive to build new prisons I'm still confused as to how those private businesses are leveraging us to change our criminal laws to imprison more people I don't think that the problem with the prison system is a private public system as much as is an issue of oversight there's not very good oversight of our prison systems and our criminal laws in some cases our too harsh and in some cases are seriously not harsh enough I mean in state of California I think the average time served for a rape is something like five and a half years which is just nuts Shelby says and what do you do when you have a termite problem as an American Jew it's difficult not to feel threatened by the growing anti-semitism coming from the extreme liberal left this is of course a reference to Louis Farrakhan calling for the extermination of Jews and saying that that he's not an anti-semite he's an anti termite which is weird because every time I try to fumigate my house for termites what they do is they then proceeded to build half the inventions in human history create the basic morality of the West and create the only successful stay in the Middle East every time I tried to fumigate the termites that's what happens is it's an astonishing thing he hasn't been banned from Twitter of course because he's Lewis Farrakhan and Democrats love him according to Shelby my own my very own senator Kirsten Gillibrand who's supposed to represent one of the most Jewish areas in the world is being cheered onstage by openly anti-semitic figures like Linda Sarsour where do you see this ending the answer is no we're good because I mean let's look at history it never ends all that well for the Jews the difference is this time number one America I do believe is a different country I do believe that an America steeped in judeo-christian values that believes in the the biblical truth of the of the Jewish mission and the Christian mission is very friendly to Jews and has historically been so and there is a State of Israel and the State of Israel does have the capacity to defend itself and that changes the very nature of the history in which we live Charles says dear Ben white a large city seems to always vote Democrat in more rural areas Republican the answer is because in rural areas you tend to be a lot more self-reliant and there's a lot less conflict with the people you live around if you have a big part of space if you have a big piece of land your neighbor and can bother you that much so you don't feel the necessity to regulate your neighbor all that much because there are no externalities to what your neighbor is doing when you live in a city externalities are everywhere you when you live in a city the guy next door is playing his music too loud it bothers you and that means that you need a regulation about how much noise is allowed in a particular residential building if the guy next door decides to keep a messy apartment and the smell is emanating there from our problem you need regulations if the streets are not clean and we all share the same streets well then that requires regulation too and all this requires tax dollars spillover effects in highly populated areas are more significant this is the reason why cities tend to be more highly regulated and more top-down now does that mean that's how they should be run economically speaking no doesn't mean that's how they should be run in terms of regulatory policy no but that's the reason why you get a lot of people together in a very small area it does generally drive people toward the idea that we have to heavily lock down how we live in a way that you wouldn't if you were out in the middle of nowhere where you're not bothering anybody and nobody's bothering you Reid says hey Ben much like you I was viciously bullied in middle school in high school I feel like a stronger person for it but I also avoid thinking about those times have you been able to forgive the bullies from your youth if yes how so well I think forgiveness requires in Judaism forgiveness requires somebody to ask for forgiveness I think one of the guys who did this ask for forgiveness and one point even it wasn't actually one of the guys it was one of the guys who was there and didn't do anything he has for forgiveness then I had no problem giving if somebody came and asked for forgiveness now I think I would do it just because we were all kids we were young and people act like idiots when they're young they act terribly when they're young but I don't think you have to forgive to move beyond as long as you're not spending your entire life focusing on how you were wrong and letting it eat your brain then you can just move on with your life and sure when I see those guys is there a pang of like God that guy was just the worst absolutely but is that something that I spend an awful lot of time thinking about no and do I think that it made me stronger yeah I do I think that when you go through adversity and you come out the other side determined to succeed I think that does make you stronger Daniel says who is a better composer Chopin or list a good question I will say that I prefer show him but I am fond of both of them although I have to say that they're to me both our composers of showier pieces I prefer what would be termed more serious music folks like Brahms let's see Stephen says dear Ben I'm a college student and looking for advice on how or where to find court case rulings on topics in general without digging through endless opinion articles what other resources does your team use to find objective opinion on topics in regard to laws or government policies please help me be less like Skylar Durden and more like the Benjamin Shapiro show facts of her feelings Stephen Skylar turd and of course a reference to Stephen Crowder's character Skylar Durden who does this debate show that I was just on a little bit earlier this week when I'm looking for objective law I tend to look directly at the court rulings this is one of the benefits to being a lawyer I can actually read court rulings and I can read the law and I can understand it so that obviously is very helpful also there are some sites that are pretty good about trying to sum up these things without too much opinion injected SCOTUS blog is pretty famous for being fairly good about this sort of stuff oh yes is a good resource on this sort of thing they'll kind of give you the ruling they can't the controversy the ruling and the extension of the ruling so there are a number of sites that are not partisan in this way I don't see Stephens as hey Ben would you support a congressional term limits what would be the limit of so I so I have to admit I'm split on congressional term limits on the one hand I think that people should be able to elect whomever they want and if people continue to elect the same Congress people because they're lazy that's on you that's your fault right I think that freedom for voters is something that I am in favor of on the other hand because congressmen have basically been using government resources not only to enrich themselves but also to enshrine their own capacity to stay in Congress the idea of term limits has some appeal one of the great advantages to being in Congress is you can use office stationery to send out misses that are basically campaign literature and even if you're not openly campaigning when you send out a missive to your entire population saying here's something great I did for you it's obviously a piece of campaign literature you just guys it as a piece of information that you're trying to give folks so yeah I'm split on it I think I could probably fall either way on all this let's see John says good morning given that Democrats have moved in are still moving further and further to the left in 2020 what do you think will be the most significant or most ridiculous change to the official Democratic Party Party platform from 2016 I would not be surprised if the Democratic Party platform in 2016 embrace embraces full-on nationalized health care I would also not be surprised if they embrace the idea of gender neutrality meaning that it would be that they're in favor of anti-discrimination laws that prevent any sort of difference in outcome between men and women and even reflect the idea that legislation should allow you to self register in terms of gender like that that would not be a great surprise I think that's probably not 2020 I think by 2024 that's probably in the platform Derek says hey man I teach in the ROTC Department of a major university and our program receives constant opposition from the school to the point where our cadets can't wear uniforms to class without harassment and can't use dummy rifles in training how do you recommend we approach the school to solve this problem and allow our future army leaders the training Nate is serve Thanks well here's the way I would deal with it and is the last question the way that I would deal with this is I would actually go to my Congress person and I would threaten them with Solomon amendment so the Solomon amendment says that if you defund ROTC then you lose your federal funding extending that to the allowance of ROTC to do what it needs to do on college campuses seems to me perfectly rational if you're gonna try and crack down on ROTC for political reasons why are you taking federal funding from the federal government that is defending those ROTC folks are gonna be in the military defending the rights of people to be idiots on college campuses all over the world sorry I'm gonna do one more because this one seems very sincere Jesse says dear Ben I was hoping you could help me because I feel like I'm being a bad conservative in the news in popular culture it's become well-documented that conservatives love to denigrate women marry women and make them subservience men so far one and a half years into my marriage however my wife hasn't worked as she's pursuing a master's degree and I'm the primary earner her school schedule often keeps her too busy to help around the house so I cook about 90% of all the meals make sure lunch is ready for both of us meal plan etc she does tend to clean more than I do but I attribute that more to her having a more strict definition of cleanliness than I do I love my wife and I'm very proud of her for the work she's doing but sometimes I worry am i being a bad conservative for loving my wife and making sacrifices to the overall benefit of our marriage Jesse Jesse I feel you man I just said earlier on the program my wife hadn't cooked a meal in like 10 years okay I spend more time with our kids right now than my wife does that'll change when she takes time off or if she works part time after she graduates but I've been there I feel you dude and no it doesn't make you a bad conservative obviously I understand the letter is sarcastic it doesn't make a bad conservative to be kind to your wife and anybody but this does raise a good issue about marriage things you know the reason that marriages fail is because you have unrealistic expectations of the other party the lower your expectations are of your spouse the bedroom your marriage will be that doesn't mean that you can't have reasonable expectations that your spouse treats you well it doesn't mean that you should allow your spouse to treat you badly or anything like that but presumably you married them because you don't think that they will what I mean is that if you have an expectation that all housework is gonna be split 50/50 not gonna happen if you have an expectation all child care is gonna be split 50/50 not going to happen if you have an expectation that your wife is going to take care of things or your husband is going to take care of things you are setting yourself up for failure the first rule in marriage is do it yourself and then if your spouse does something for you it's a nice thing and you can appreciate it but you shouldn't expectations are a killer of relationships this is true in politics also by the way expectations kill politics if you expect that politics is going to solve all of your problems you're going to be disappointed in life and in politics if you expect that the circumstances surrounding you're gonna solve all of your personal problems you're destined to failure and if you expect that getting married is gonna solve all your problems because your wife is gonna butter your bagel every morning then you're destined to fail like before I got married I actually said to my parents I hate buttering my bagel like I hate it I hate now I'll be honest I miss bagels like I've been on a low-carb diet for a long time bagels are spectacular but I hate it when I was a kid I hated buttering my bagel and I always said to my sisters when I get married I have only one requirement and my wife butter by bagel for me my wife has never buttered a single bagel ever has never happened you know what it's fine I don't care and if she ever did it I'd be so happy I can whenever she cooks a meal I'm the happiest person not because like she's a great cook though she is a very good cook she cooks Moroccan it's terrific but because when when you're when you treat everything that your spouse gives you as a gift you order likely to be a happier person and if you feel like your spouse has done it out of fulfillment of an expectation true of God as well by the way true and religion people think that God is a gumball machine if I pray hard enough and if I act well enough God will be nice to me God has no requirement to be nice to you that is not God's job your job is to do your duty and then your job is to acknowledge that God is in control of the world there's a religious person this is why whenever people say and listen I feel the emotional appeal if something bad happened to me in my life and therefore I blame God for it I feel the emotional appeal that particularly an absolutely tragic situation something happens to a child you live through the Holocaust and stuff like that but expectations of God are unfair to God and unfair to you because that's not the way the world works and then when God gives you a gift you can be grateful for it gratitude is the gratitude is the number one ingredient in happiness okay time for a couple of things I like and then a couple of things that I hate so things that I like so I was on Elvis kick this week is you know last week I actually visited Graceland Senya is very pleased honey is a huge Elvis fan and we brought her back a mug from Graceland as well as a cup from Graceland we're cheap that way and Elvis so we've been doing a little bit of Elvis this week I have to say I didn't realize because I hadn't listened to a lot of Elvis that Elvis actually could sing because when you actually just do pop culture stuff with Elvis it's always like Elvis impersonators in Vegas who it's just not great stuff little bit of gum but bad Elvis late Elvis fat Elvis and that's not best Elvis or you have the Jailhouse Rock version of Elvis which is a lot of energy but not necessarily tremendous vocal skills he's a very good ballot ballad singer I think his best stuff is actually ballad singer is actual pretty soulful so here is what I think is his best song can't help falling in love which was from blue Hawaii I believe was originally recorded for this and it's it's quite a beautiful song one of the funny things about a lot of Elvis songs he always never wrote any of his own stuff didn't write a single I think he wrote two of his own songs his entire career but half of his great songs are actually old foreign songs translated into English with different lyrics so it's now or never is solo mio just slowed down and this was this song can't help falling in love was actually an old French ballad that was updated and then given English lyrics what's the what's the other famous Elvis song I mean they're many but there's a very famous Elvis ballad tenderer Love Me Tender Thank You Love Me Tender is actually an old civil southern civil war ballad that was updated and given new lyrics so it kind of kind of interesting stuff anyway here is Elvis singing can't help falling in love my kids love this song which is the right it's a great song all of whom yeah it's great so also his gospel stuff is really good go listen his gospel stuff he grew up singing gospel and he's very into gospel music this is kind of what Elvis was really kind of a fusion musician he did gospel he did R&B and he did country and he sort of merged all those three into one form I'd be coming to appreciate ur of Elvis since I visited Graceland and that's why I'm gonna do my hair like Mathis Glover so other things that I like so this is really spectacular nikki Haley my spirit animal sadly to depart from the Trump administration I still lament the the movement of my spirit animal on from here she did the Al Smith dinner and she dropped a great line on Elizabeth Warren it's just this is great stuff so here is my beloved spirit animal nikki Haley last year you went with Paul Ryan who's a boy scout and that's fine below boring so this year you wanted to spice things up again right I get it you wanted an Indian woman but Elizabeth Warren failed her DNA test good joke see Republicans can tell jokes and this is good and Nikki Nikki Haley's great okay time for a couple of things that I hate if you feel like everybody is taking crazy pills that's because they are so I'm about to play for you the worst ad in political history are you ready for this thing this thing is hot garbage so this is an ad that is currently making its way across the FM waves in Arkansas it is targeted at black voters and it is from a GOP super PAC a GOP associated super PACs not actually run by the GOP and it's not run by congressman French he'll the ad is run on behalf of congressman French hill from this kind of unnamed group the ad starts off bad but if you wait for it it gets worse it's so bad it's great so here is the ad for a congressman French show from black Americans for the President's agenda whoo boy what will happen to our husbands our fathers or our sons when a white girl lies on them girl white Democrats will be lynching black folk again turnout always told my son don't be messing around with that if you get caught she will cry rape I'm voting to keep congressman French here and the Republicans because we have to protect our men and boys we can't afford to let white Democrats take us back to bed old days of race verdicts life sentences and lynches when a white girl screams rape well that well okay yeah so there's that moving on Steve Schmidt what do you say my goodness okay wellin so French Oh to his credit and to his necessity came out said that's a bad ad I have nothing to do with that ad I certainly hope not because whoever did have to do with that ad obviously fell the stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down they also fell from the racist tree and then hit every branch on the way down followed by falling from the sexist tree and then hitting every branch on the way down solid stuff there we've seen some pretty spectacular ads in this last election campaign I mean we had the guy who's doing cocaine Mitch which was just amazing this tops cocaine Mitch I think these are better ad than cocaine much cocaine Mitch elbow that will stick a little bit longer because it actually is a great name for cocaine much okay oh yeah J yeah that's the same ad where he he did describe cocaine Mitch being married to a China person which was pretty great um okay other things that I hate so I think we can all acknowledge that that is not a good ad however MSNBC cannot acknowledge what is a good guest so Steve Schmidt former Republican counsel iary to the McCain campaign who's made a living for the past eight years nine years ten years off of basically going on MSNBC and ripping into other Republicans he says that the Republican Party is treating immigrants like slaves at an auction which makes perfect sense if you know nothing about immigration slavery or auctions so here is a here's Steve Schmidt doing this routine when they reach the border and they see a uniform with an American flag and they are no longer safe but that baby is ripped away and put into an internment camp no this is a moral outrage that harkens to the worst excesses in the history of the country to the separation of families at the slave auction blocks yes to the separation of Native American families I love everybody nodding along like this is an intelligent thing to say and Rosie O'Donnell I'm old enough to remember when the media thought that Kanye West was crazy and then they brought Rosie O'Donnell on MSNBC and said that Rosie O'Donnell was totally with it Rosie O'Donnell is a crazy person Rosie O'Donnell is a legit insane person and just to prove that here's Rosie O'Donnell saying in that same segment as she nods there sagely comparing an actual 9th 9th Circuit Court of Appeals policy about separation of families at the border specifically designed to prevent the detention of children in jails instead the children were supposed to be given over to guardians outside jails right that's a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion implemented under the Obama ministration and then extended under the Trump administration Rosie O'Donnell sitting there knotting sagely when that is compared to a slave auction which is deeply insulting to black folks it really is here is Rosie O'Donnell then saying that she wants to send the military to the White House after Trump do you even constitution bro people were like Marshall Law what's wrong with you you're a lunatic he wants to send the military to the border so I would have send the military to the White House to get here so much humouring ah the laughter ah the revelry ha ha ha she wants to send the military to the White House to get him my god what like man such good joking such good comedian Inc from Rosie O'Donnell uh uh my heart I can't take it anymore ok well we'll be back here on Monday with all the latest news can it get more absurd from here I would have said no did we not live in a parallel universe but in this universe in this universe not only can it it most certainly will and we'll be back on Monday to discuss the fact that King Kong has overtaken the entire White House and is now ripping out the west wing and replacing it with a Polly Pocket set we back here on Monday to discuss that news i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya
