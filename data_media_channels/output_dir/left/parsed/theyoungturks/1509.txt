HARVEY WEINSTEIN MADE
HIS PERP WALK INTO THE
COURTHOUSE TO POST A
MILLION-DOLLAR BAIL WHICH HE
ESSENTIALLY JUST DROPPED ON THE
TABLE AND WALKED OUT.
HARVEY
WEINSTEIN IS A CONSEQUENCE OF
THIS MORNING ACTIVITIES WILL BE
FITTED WITH A GPS DEVICE BECAUSE
HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH RAPE
AND HE CANNOT LEAVE THE AREA OF
NEW YORK OR CONNECTICUT.
HERE IS HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED,
THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE BY
THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.
THE CHARGES HERE TODAY ARE A
RESULT OF MONTHS OF
INVESTIGATION AND THAT
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS
DEFENDANT USED HIS POSITION,
MONEY, AND POWER TO THE WERE
YOUNG WOMEN INTO SITUATIONS WHEN
HE WAS ABLE TO VIOLATE THEM
SEXUALLY.
OUR INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND
WE HAVE ENCOURAGED OTHER
SURVIVORS TO COME FORWARD.
THAT LITTLE REACTION THAT HE
HAD WHEN HE HEARD VIOLATE
THEM SEXUALLY, IT WAS THIS WEIRD
LITTLE DISMISSIVE, WHEN YOU
MAKE OF THAT MOMENT?
I THINK HE WAS JUST HAVING A
FLASHBACK THE POTTED PLANTS.
THEY GOT ME.
HIS LAWYER MADE SOME
STATEMENTS, WHICH WE PULLED
VIDEO OF.
HERE IS HIS LAWYER
BENJAMIN BRAFFMEN.
HIS FIRST
STATEMENT WAS ABOUT HINTING AT
WHETHER THE JURY WILL
BELIEVE THIS AND WHETHER THEY
CAN FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF
JURY IN HIS MIND AT ALL.
TAKE A LOOK.
MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE
LONG OVERDUE QUITE FRANKLY
HAVING BEEN MADE ABOUT EVENTS
THAT ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE
OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.
THEY
WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE
AT THE TIME.
THESE EVENTS
OCCURRED AND I ANTICIPATE THAT
THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MADE THESE
ALLEGATIONS WHEN SUBJECTED TO
CROSS-EXAMINATION IN THE EVENTS
WE EVEN GET THAT FAR, THAT
THE CHARGES WILL NOT
BE BELIEVED BY 12
PEOPLE, ASSUMING WE GET 12
FAIR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CONSUMED
BY THE MOVEMENT THAT SEEMS TO
HAVE OVERTAKEN THIS CASE.
SO THE MOVEMENT THAT SEEMS TO
HAVE OVERTAKEN THIS CASE.
ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT
HIM AS BEETLEJUICE,
BEETLEJUICE, BEETLEJUICE.
I HOPE HE DISAPPEARS.
WHAT IS IT WITH THE OLD-SCHOOL
NEW YORK GUYS AND THE HAIR?
TRUMPS DOCTOR, WEINSTEIN'S
LAWYER.
ANYWAY, SOME POTENTIAL
BAD NEWS HERE.
I READ A FAIRLY
PERSUASIVE ARTICLE
ON LAW AND CRIME ABOUT
HOW HE MIGHT GET AWAY.
OF
COURSE THERE IS 1 MILLION THINGS
THAT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW
AND THEN BUT OUR JOB IS TO
ANALYZE RIGHT?
FIRST OF ALL, LET'S ALSO NOTE A
TERRIBLE THING THAT THE LAWYER
SAID.
HE SAID HARVEY WEINSTEIN
DIDN'T INVENTS THE CASTING COUCH
DOTS IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC
OPINION, THAT IS ABOUT A BADDEST
THING YOU CAN SAY.
WHAT'S THE
BIG, EVERYBODY WAS RAPING WOMEN
WHO ARE COMING IN.
BUT IN THE
ACTUAL COURT, THAT MIGHT NOT BE
AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS TO US, SO HE
IS GOING TO SAY SINCE IT WAS
SUCH AN INDUSTRY-STANDARD THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP FOR A
JOB, IT MIGHT'VE BEEN THAT THE
WOMEN ASSUMED THAT THEY WERE
PART OF THAT PROCESS HENCE IT
WAS NOT ONLY AGAINST THEIR WILL,
THAT IN HOLLYWOOD, YOU MUST
SLEEPER A JOB AND THEY ARE
CHOOSING TO DO THAT.
THAT IS
GOING TO BE PART OF HIS CASE.
IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO PROVE
WHAT WAS IN PEOPLE'S HEADS.
A
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS
CASE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, THEY
COULD NOT CHARGE HARVEY
WEINSTEIN WITH LOWER CRIMES.
THEY HAD TO CHARGE THEM WITH
FIRST-DEGREE RAPE AND
FIRST-DEGREE SEXUAL ASSAULT
BECAUSE THE LOWER CRIMES,
ESPECIALLY FOR THE 2004 CASE ARE
TOO OLD BUT THE GOOD NEWS IN NEW
YORK IS THAT THERE IS NO STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS ON RAPE IN THE
1STâˆž.
THE BAD NEWS IS YOU HAVE
TO PROVE THE HIGHEST CHARGE
POSSIBLE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE
OF THE CASES THEY SAY THE WOMAN
FELL INTIMIDATED AND THREATENS,
BUT IN NEW YORK LAW, IN ORDER TO
PROVE FIRST-DEGREE AND THIS IS
WHERE IT GETS TRICKY AND THAT'S
WHAT THE LAWYERS WILL GO TO WORK
ON THE JURY, A THREAT OF
ACTUAL FORCE, WAS FORCED
THREATENED, WAS FORCE USED?
AND THERE'S EVEN ANOTHER
LOOPHOLE, AND ONE OF THESE
CHARGES IS SAYS SEX, WHICH IS
INTERPRETED IN OLDER CASE LAW AS
INTERCOURSE AND NOT NECESSARILY
ORAL SEX AND THE 2004 CASE WAS
ORAL SEX SO HE HAS A STREAM TEAM
BECAUSE HE HAS ALL OF THE MONEY
IN THE WORLD, THIS IS ONE OF THE
TOP LAWYERS THERE IS IN THIS
FIELD AND HE IS GOING TO UNLEASH
THEM SO DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF AT THE END, HE IS NOT
CONVICTED.
I THINK HE MAKES A POINT
THOUGH, I'M NOT TRYING TO EXCUSE
HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S BEHAVIOR BUT
I THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL
SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND I THINK THAT
HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS ONE OF THE
SYMPTOMS OF AN ISSUE THAT WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT BILL COSBY AND
ALL OF THE MEN WHO ARE NOW GOING
DOWN WHO ARE NO LONGER OF VALUE
TO HOLLYWOOD ANYMORE BUT WHILE
THEY WERE IN THEIR HEYDAY IN ALL
OF THIS STUFF WAS GOING ON THEY
WERE BEING ENABLED, A LOT OF
PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW
THEY KNEW THAT THESE GUYS WERE
DOING THIS AND NO ONE SAID
ANYTHING AND I THINK THAT WE
REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE
DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS NOT JUST
HARVEY WEINSTEIN, BUT THERE IS A
COLLECTION OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE
THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS ACCEPTABLE
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WATCH
IT HAPPEN.
THIS BIG SPORTS
AGENT, VERY BIG-TIME, I WAS
SITTING AT DINNER WITH MY
FRIENDS HE WALKED BY ME WITHOUT
KNOWING ME AND RAN HIS HANDS
THROUGH MY HAIR AND I WENT OFF
ON HIM BUT WHAT MADE ME SO ANGRY
WAS THAT I WAS SITTING WITH TWO
MEN, ONE WHO WORK AT NIKE AND
ONE WHO WAS A SPORTS AGENT AND
THEY LEFT IT OFF, THEY DIDN'T
THINK THAT THAT WAS INVASIVE,
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
DISRESPECTFUL, THEY TOLD ME TO
JUST SIMMER DOWN AND I AM LIKE
A LETTER STRANGE MEN WALK
AROUND AND CARESS YOUR HAIR.
YOU WOULD GET UP AND PROBABLY
TRY TO FIGHT HIM.
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY
TIME THAT HAPPENED.
IT WAS JUST WEIRD.
I WAS
LISTENING TO QUINN AND PALTROW
TALK ABOUT HOW BRAD PITT I WILL
KILL YOU BUT THEN HE WENT ON TO
DO AND GLORIOUS PASTORS WITH
THEM AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM IS
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU SLEPT
SOMEBODY ON THE WRIST AND SAY
THAT IS NOT OKAY BUT THEY ARE
STILL IN BUSINESS, THEY ARE
STILL MAKING MONEY AND IT IS
STILL NOT OKAY.
I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER
THINGS HEARS POWER AND
PRIVILEGE.
HERE HE IS, AS YOU
SAY HAS HIGH-POWERED ATTORNEYS,
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE ABLE TO
ADVOCATE FOR HIM AND NOW HE GETS
OFF, HE IS ABLE TO POST THAT
MILLION DOLLAR BILL, NOT MANY
PEOPLE CAN DO THAT.
HUMANS
RIGHTS WATCH, THERE WAS SOME
RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE AND THEY
EXAMINED LIKE SIX COUNTRIES IN
70 TO 80% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
ARRESTED ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY SO
THEY ARE SITTING IN JAIL AND IN
CALIFORNIA ALONE, NEARLY 60% OF
PRISONERS IN THE COUNTY JAILS
HAVE NOT BEEN SENTENCED BUT THEY
ARE SERVING BECAUSE THEY CAN
POST BAIL SO THAT IS THE OTHER
PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AS WELL,
IS THE POWER AND THE PRIVILEGE
AND WHO HE IS.
WE WERE TALKING
BEFORE WE CAME ON ABOUT HOW HE
WAS IN FIRST CLASS,
MELVIN, GREAT POINT.
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING WHEN I
SAW THE MILLION DOLLAR CASH ALE.
HE FINDS THAT IN BETWEEN HIS
COUCH, RIGHT?
WHAT IS THE POINT OF BAILED AND?
THE POINT IS UNFORTUNATELY TO
KEEP POOR PEOPLE IN JAIL AND SO
THERE ARE NOW SOME DISTRICT
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE OVERTURNING
THAT LIKE LARRY KRASNER IN
PHILADELPHIA, WE'RE NOT DOING
CASH SPELL ANYMORE BECAUSE RICH
PEOPLE AND EVEN MIDDLE-CLASS
PEOPLE CAN PAY AND POOR PEOPLE
CAN'T. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE
SEVERITY OF THE CRIME AS IT IS
ON YOUR INCOME LEVEL SO CASH
BAIL IS JUST A WAY TO PUT FOUR
PEOPLE IN PRISON DOTS WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW THAT THEY DID A LOT
OF TIMES IT IS MINOR INFRACTIONS
OR MARIJUANA CHARGES.
MEANWHILE
A GUY WHO APPEARS TO BE AS
SERIAL RAPIST, ALLEGEDLY, WHAT'S
RUN FREE AS HE COULD BE BECAUSE
IT'S $1 MILLION THAT HE HAS
EASILY.
BUT THAT THEN LED ME TO
THINKING LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN
THIS CASE AND IT IS GOING TO BE
TOUGH BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE BIT
OLDER AND HE HAS GREAT ATTORNEYS
AND ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF THE
CASES, WHETHER THE JUDGE WILL
ALLOW THE OTHER INSTANCES OF
WHEN WOMEN CAME FORWARD AND
TALKED ABOUT WHAT HARVEY
WEINSTEIN DID AND SO FROM TIME
TO TIME I TELL YOU GUYS THAT I
USED TO BE A REPUBLICAN AND THE
ONLY PART THAT IS LEFT THAT IS
STILL CONSERVATIVE IS THE LEGAL
PART, SO IT DRIVES ME CRAZY WHEN
YOU CANNOT INTRODUCE EVIDENCE OF
THEIR PATTERN IN COURT.
IT
PREVENTS JUSTICE.
IT IS NOT THAT
YOU CAN'T EVER DO IT,
BUT IT IS TOUGH STANDARDS FOR
WHEN YOU CAN DO AND I KNOW WHY.
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE JUDGING
THEM BASED ON OTHER STUFF,
YOU WANT THEM JUDGING IT ON THIS
CRIME BUT IF THAT GUY HAS A
PATTERN OF DOING IT 50
TIMES, IS THAT RELEVANT TO
WHETHER HE DID IN THIS CASE?
OF COURSE IT'S RELEVANT.
IF
THEY NEVER HEAR THAT, HERE IS A
WAY BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING
OFF.
IF THEY DO HERE HE MIGHT BE
IN TROUBLE THE MATTER HOW GOOD
HIS LAWYERS ARE.
I WOULD
SAY HIS LAWYER IS GOING EVEN
FURTHER THAN THAT, HE IS SETTING
UP THE ARGUMENT THAT EVEN IF
THEY DON'T ADMIT THAT KIND OF
EVIDENCE, AS THAT VIDEO WE SAID
PROVES, HE IS SETTING UP, THERE
IS NO ONE IN AMERICA WHO HAS
BEEN INSULATED FROM THE BIAS, IS
WHAT HE IS GOING TO ARGUE, THE
BIAS TOWARD MY CLIENTS OF THESE
RIDICULOUS, SPURIOUS CHARGES
THAT DO NOT MEAN ANYTHING AND HE
IS GOING, HE IS MOVING TO
DISMISS IMMEDIATELY ACCORDING TO
HIM, BUT HE IS SETTING UP THAT
WE CANNOT EVEN 512 PEOPLE WHO
ARE GOING TO COME IN WITH FRESH
EARS, EVEN IF WE DON'T LET THAT
EVIDENCE IN.
IT IS SUPER FRUSTRATING AND HE
IS ALSO KINDA SETTING IT UP
AS TO HOW UNFAIR IT IS TO HIS
CLIENT.
WASN'T IT BLOOMBERG WHO SAID
HE WOULDN'T SPEAK ILL OF HARVEY
BECAUSE HE IS A NEW YORKER.
THAT'S THE THING?
I HAVE TO SUPPORT EVERYONE IN
LOS ANGELES?
ALL THEY DO IS SPEAK ILL OF
NEW YORKERS.
HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN NEW
YORK?
BUT TO SAY THAT HE IS NOT
GOING TO GET TREATED FAIRLY IN
NEW YORK, THAT IS THE OPINION OF
A VERY SUCCESSFUL, RICH, WHITE
MAN IN NEW YORK IT WAS LIKE, I
CAN'T THROW HARVEY UNDER THE BUS
FOR THE RAPE THAT HE DID DO
BECAUSE HE IS A NEW YORKER.
IN THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THE
JURY CANNOT JUDGE THE CASE
FAIRLY IF THEY HAVE EVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, I ALSO
DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT ALL.
THEY ARE GOING TO SPEND MONTHS
IN THERE AND THEY ARE GOING
TO HEAR ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SO
IF WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY
COULD BE UNBIASED, THEN LET'S
NOT HAVE JURY TRIALS.
AND IS IT UNFAIR, THIS IS ALL
UNFAIR TO HARVEY.
YOU HAVE DONE
THIS AND DOZENS OF WOMEN HAVE
ACCUSED YOU OF THIS.
YOU HAVE
GOTTEN OFF SCOT-FREE FOR YEARS
WITH OSCARS IN YOUR POCKET IN A
CITY WHERE EVERYBODY KNEW, BRAD
PITT KNEW YOU WERE DOING THIS.
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN
FAIR TO YOU FOR THE LAST 20
YEARS.
YOU HAVE WHAT IS IT LIKE 80
WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD AND
THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES
WHO HAVE COME FORWARD.
IMAGINE THE COURAGE AND THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT COME
FORWARD OR DISCLOSED.
THAT IS THE OTHER THING AND
STILL THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO
BE ENOUGH, AND STILL THIS MAN IS
ABLE TO WALK THE STREETS
BECAUSE HE HAS ACCESS.
HE IS SMILING IN THIS
PICTURE.
LAST THING ON IT IS, IF THEY
GET THEM, THEY GOT THEM, GREAT.
WONDERFUL.
IF THEY DON'T GET
HIM, THEIR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS
IN MANHATTAN WHO ARE ALSO
LOOKING INTO THIS AND I WOULD
SAY KEEP GOING, BROTHERS AND
SISTERS AND ONES IN LA, THEY
SHOULD LOOK INTO IT TO BECAUSE
YOU JUST KEEP TRYING HIM AND
TELL AT LEAST YOU BANKRUPT THEM.
BY THE WAY, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
DOUBLE JEOPARDY IN THIS COUNTRY
AND RIGHTFULLY SO, IT IS IN THE
U.S. CONSTITUTION, YOU CAN'T
KEEP TRYING HIM IN THE SAME
VENUE FOR THE SAME CRIME, I AM
NOT SUGGESTING THAT.
THERE ARE 80 CASES HERE, YOU
ARE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF
VICTIMS UNFORTUNATELY.
