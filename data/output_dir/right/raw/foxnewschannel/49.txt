HIM BY HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND, KAREN

00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:17,655
MONAHAN.

10
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:19,023
KAREN MONAHAN IS A LIBERAL, SHE

11
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:20,958
IS A DEMOCRAT, BUT SHE HAS ALSO

12
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,226
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE POOR

13
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:22,960
TREATMENT SHE HAS RECEIVED FROM

14
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:25,963
FELLOW DEMOCRATS SHE WAS BOLD

15
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,065
ENOUGH TO GO PUBLIC WITH HER

16
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:28,499
ALLEGATIONS.

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
HAS ANYTHING CHANGED IN THE

18
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,569
WEEKS SINCE SHE SAID THAT?

19
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,537

>> THANK YOU, TUCKER.

23
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:39,577

24
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:40,844
>> Tucker: KAREN, YOU SAID

FORWARD WITH YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST

27
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:47,818
KEITH ELLISON, THAT YOU WERE IN

28
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:48,986
EFFECT BLACKLISTED BY FELLOW

29
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:49,653
DEMOCRATS APPEARED CAN YOU

30
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,421
DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEANT WHEN YOU

31
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:52,122
SAID THAT?

32
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:55,693
>> I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

33
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:58,229
SOCIAL MEDIA, IF YOU SEE SOME OF

34
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,865
THE LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN

35
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:04,568
WRITTEN, THAT BASICALLY SAY THEY

36
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,604
DON'T BELIEVE ME.

37
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:09,206
THE FOLKS WHO HAVE SIGNED ON, IT

38
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:13,510
IS PRETTY APPARENT THERE HAS

39
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,979
BEEN A LOT OF

40
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,713
BULLYING, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

41
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:18,782
OF HARASSMENT.

42
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:19,750
ISOLATION.

43
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,919
BY MANY FOLKS THAT I STOOD

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,053
SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH, SUPPORTING

45
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:26,490
THEM IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS, WALKING

46
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:32,162
WITH THEM IN VARIOUS PROTESTS,

47
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:33,964
WORKED TOGETHER ON DIFFERENT

48
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:37,835
ISSUES AROUND SOCIAL JUSTICE.

49
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:40,404
>> Tucker: THAT IS NOT THE

50
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:41,739
RECEPTION THAT PEOPLE WHO SAY

51
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,473
THEY ARE SURVIVORS OF ABUSE

52
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,875
EXPECT THEY ARE GOING TO GET

53
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,343
FROM THE LEFT, FROM DEMOCRATS.

54
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,245
WERE YOU SURPRISED BY IT?

55
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:50,914
>> NO.

56
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:55,886
I WATCHED THE #MeToo MOVEMENT,

57
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:58,589
I'VE WATCHED BOTH SIDES,

58
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,259
BASICALLY TAKE WOMEN'S PAIN AND

59
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,196
USE IT AS A TOOL FOR POLITICS.

60
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:07,231
AND ONCE IT CAME TO ONE SIDE OR

61
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,136
TO THE OTHER, YOU WOULD SEE THE

62
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:14,071
SAME PEOPLE START PUSHING AWAY

63
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,373
FROM IT AND SAYING STUFF LIKE,

64
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:19,410
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUE

65
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,544
ISSUES.

66
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,012
THIS IS A REAL ISSUE.

67
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,347
>> Tucker: AND HER PARTNER, DO

68
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:24,114
YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATIC

69
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:26,784
ORGANIZATION IN MINNESOTA

70
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:27,918
INVESTIGATED THIS IN A

71
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,385
LEGITIMATE WAY?

72
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:30,421
THESE CLAIMS?

73
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:32,623
>> NO, IT WASN'T LEGITIMATE AT

74
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:32,890
ALL.

75
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:37,394
ANY OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF IT WOULD

76
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:38,729
REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION.

77
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,330
THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL

78
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,764
COMMITTEE KICKED IT TO THE DFL

79
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,032
PARTY IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA,

80
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:45,269
WHO HIRED THEIR LAWYER TO

81
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,303
INVESTIGATE THEIR CANDIDATE FOR

82
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:47,071
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

83
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:50,040
NOT JUST THEIR CANDIDATE,

84
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,743
TUCKER, FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL,

85
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,578
BUT ACROSS THE LEFT, FOR THE

86
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,213
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, A LEADER OF

87
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:57,681
THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT, NOT

88
00:02:57,682 --> 00:02:58,816
JUST IN MINNESOTA, BUT

89
00:02:58,817 --> 00:02:59,216
NATIONALLY.

90
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:02,286
THE VICE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC

91
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:03,020
NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS WHO THEY

92
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,421
WERE INVESTIGATING, AND THEY

93
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:06,423
HIRED THEIR OWN LAWYER, NOT AN

94
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,091
OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT LAWYER,

95
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,159
THEIR OWN LAWYER, AND A LAW

96
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,529
FIRM THAT RAISED OVER HALF A

97
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,764
MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEMOCRATIC

98
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:15,132
CANDIDATES IN OVER $50,000

99
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,835
PER KEITH ELLISON HIMSELF.

100
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:18,435
>> Tucker: THAT IS NOT

101
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:18,836
LEGITIMATE.

102
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:21,372
KAREN, YOU HAVE SAID, ALLEGEDLY,

103
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:22,973
THERE IS A VIDEO THAT SHOWS YOU

104
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:23,774
BEING DRAGGED OFF THE BED BY

105
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,442
KEITH ELLISON, HIM SWEARING AT

106
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:26,610
YOU.

107
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:27,644
IT DOES THAT DO EXIST?

108
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:30,347
>> YES.

109
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,014
>> Tucker: WILL THE PUBLIC

110
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,984
HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IT?

111
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:35,152
>> OF THE PUBLIC WILL NOT HAVE A

112
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:37,654
CHANCE TO SEE IT.

113
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:40,224
THAT IS MY PAIN, AND FOR

114
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:40,858
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, FOR

115
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,862
EVERYONE TO LOOK AT AND BOGGLE

116
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,730
OVER, SOMETHING THAT VERY

117
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,165
TRAUMATIZING FOR ME,

118
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:48,966
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

119
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,700
I WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO

120
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:50,801
SEE IT.

121
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:57,040
IF AND WHEN I DECIDE TO SHOW IT

122
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,544
TO SOMEBODY, IT WILL BE IN MY

123
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:00,844
TIME.

124
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,946
THIS IS A PROCESS.

125
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:05,048
AND JUST TO FIND THE COURAGE TO

126
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,750
COME OUT AND BREAK MY SILENCE,

127
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:09,820
AS I SAID, KNOWING THE BACKLASH

128
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,222
THAT I WOULD GET AN KNOWING THAT

129
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,558
THIS IS A JOURNEY THAT I WOULD

130
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:18,061
WALK PRETTY MUCH ON MY OWN, IT

131
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:19,763
TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

132
00:04:19,764 --> 00:04:20,097
COURAGE.

133
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,765
AND I HAVE TO FACE THE SAME

134
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,967
FEARS THAT SO MANY OTHERS WHO

135
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,970
HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED FACED WHEN

136
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,338
THEY DECIDED TO EITHER SHARE

137
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,441
THEIR STORY OR NOT SHARE THEIR

138
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:30,741
STORY.

139
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:33,877
IT IS ALSO THE SAME KIND OF FEAR

140
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:38,549
THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

141
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,983
KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATION, HAVE

142
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:43,086
KNOWN ABOUT IT LONG BEFORE I

143
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:46,089
EVER SHARED -- WENT PUBLIC WITH

144
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,959
IT -- WHY THEY SIT SILENT.

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,062
OR THEY ARE AFRAID TO SHOW

146
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:52,529
PUBLIC SUPPORT.

147
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,165
MANY HAVE BEEN BULLIED AND

148
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:55,933
INTIMIDATED, IF THEY DID COME

149
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,535
OUT AND SHOW ANY KIND OF PUBLIC

150
00:04:58,536 --> 00:04:59,403
SUPPORT, AND I GRAPPLED WITH

151
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:02,039
THAT SAME FEAR.

152
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,642
THE FEAR OF ISOLATION, THE FEAR

153
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,978
OF BEING RE-VICTIMIZED.

154
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:08,946
>> Tucker: THAT IS NOT WHAT

155
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:10,447
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL,

156
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,448
ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

157
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,749
MAKING YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

158
00:05:12,750 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING A
