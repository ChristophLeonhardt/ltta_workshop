1
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:08,936
>> Harris: FOX NEWS ALERT,

2
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:09,637
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:10,304
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS IS ON

4
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:10,838
CAPITOL HILL TODAY.

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,539
HERE'S THERE FOR A CLOSED-DOOR

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,941
INTERVIEW BEFORE A WHITE HOUSE

7
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:14,241
PANEL.

8
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:15,342
THIS COMES NEARLY ONE YEAR AFTER

9
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:20,915
HE BECAME VERY FUSED PERSON TO

10
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,950
PLEAD GUILTY TO THE MUELLER

11
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:23,851
PROBE.

12
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:25,052
PUBLICANS ARE HOPING HE CAN

13
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,353
BOLSTER THEIR CASE REGARDING

14
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:28,956
POETICAL BIAS IN THE RUN-UP TO

15
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:29,723
THE TRUMP-RUSH INVESTIGATION.

16
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:31,392
DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING TO PRESS

17
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:33,360
HIM ON HIS MEDICATIONS WITH THE

18
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,929
FORMER FOREIGN PROFESSOR WHO

19
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:43,037
TOLD PAPADOPOULOS IN 2016 THAT

20
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:43,570
RUSSIANS HAD DRIVEN

21
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:44,038
HILLARY CLINTON.

22
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,705
THE FORM OF THOUSANDS OF TAX

23
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:45,039
EMAILS.

24
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,739
PAPADOPOULOS HAS RECENTLY BEEN

25
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,207
APPLYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT HE

26
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,376
WAS SET UP.

27
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:51,712
HERE'S MARK MEADOWS ON WHAT HE'S

28
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:53,147
HOPING TO LEARN TODAY.

29
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:54,381
>> OBVIOUSLY, GEORGE

30
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:55,983
PAPADOPOULOS WAS THE REASON WHY

31
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:56,684
THIS WHOLE RUSH INVESTIGATION

32
00:00:56,685 --> 00:01:00,354
WAS OPENED.

33
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:01,722
IT WAS A PREDICATE FOR THE

34
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:02,056
AFFAIR.

35
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:05,559
HOPEFULLY WE WILL LEARN TODAY

36
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,927
EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID, WHAT WAS

37
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:07,294
NOT SAID.

38
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:10,831
I THINK WHAT WE WILL FIND IS

39
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:13,300
THAT THIS WAS NOT SOMEONE WHO

40
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:13,968
WAS COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA.

41
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,172
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

42
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,006
>> Jason: THE QUESTIONING WILL

43
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:23,377
BE OF BLOOD ON THE SIDE BY

44
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:23,944
RATCLIFF OUT OF TEXAS.

45
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:25,079
THERE WILL BE OTHERS IN THE ROOM

46
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,347
AS WELL.

47
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:27,648
THIS IS A BETTER SETTING TO DO

48
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:28,749
THIS, BECAUSE YOU CAN GO FOR ONE

49
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,552
HOUR EACH SIDE.

50
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,886
UNLIKE THE 5 MINUTES TO GET IN

51
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:34,088
THE PUBLIC PREVIEW GO ONE HOUR.

52
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,590
THE DEMOCRATS, WHEN OUR THIRD

53
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,191
REPUBLICANS, VICE VERSA.

54
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,592
YOU CAN CONTINUE AS LONG AS YOU

55
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:38,892
WANT.

56
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:39,526
THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES THESE

57
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:41,495
THINGS GO FOR EIGHT OR NINE

58
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:41,795
HOURS.

59
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:44,031
ALL THE PROCEDURAL YOURSELF THAT

60
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:44,365
HAPPENS.

61
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:47,234
THE TIMELINE IS ONE OF THE KEY

62
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,202
THINGS, HERE.

63
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:52,706
OFFICIALS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT

64
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:53,974
THIS STARTED AT THIS DATE IN

65
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:54,842
JULY, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

66
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:56,744
SUGGESTS THAT IS WRONG.

67
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:57,244
REALLY WRONG.

68
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:58,779
THE QUESTIONING WILL BE, IN

69
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,247
PART, BUT WHAT DID HE SAY AND

70
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:00,981
NOT SAY.

71
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,149
IT'S NOT TRYING TO REHASH

72
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,450
WHETHER OR NOT HE LIED TO

73
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,519
FEDERAL OFFICIALS, WHICH HE

74
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,186
EVIDENTLY DID AND HAS DONE

75
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:09,323
SOMETIME BEFORE.

76
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:09,990
WHAT WAS THE TIMELINE LIKE?

77
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:16,130
WHY ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT

78
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:17,598
WERE ENGAGING WITH HIM TO

79
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,567
POTENTIALLY SET HIM UP AND THEN

80
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:21,769
JUSTIFY THIS FISA APPLICATION?

81
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,870
>> Melissa: WHY DOES IT MATTER

82
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:25,205
IF IT'S EARLIER?

83
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:26,540
>> Jason: THIS IS CUTE WITH

84
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,274
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S LOOKING

85
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:28,342
AT.

86
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:31,011
HE DOES THIS REPORT AND SAYS "I

87
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:33,047
FIND NO IMPETUS TO AFFECT WHAT

88
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,782
THEY DID, BASED ON BIAS."

89
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:36,717
BUT WHAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IS, DID

90
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,987
THE SAME FBI OFFICIALS USE TIME?

91
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,388
DID THEY USE RESOURCES?

92
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:42,156
DID THEY SPEND MONEY?

93
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,124
DID THEY PAY INFORMANTS?

94
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,160
WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

95
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:47,361
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT

96
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:49,963
THEY WERE TARGETING A POLITICAL

97
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:51,365
CAMPAIGN AND DONALD TRUMP, AS

98
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,167
OPPOSED TO FOLLOWING THE LEADS

99
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,535
BASED ON INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAY

100
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,904
HAVE, YOU KNOW, ENCOMPASS THIS

101
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:57,337
PERSON OR NOT.

102
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:00,140
THAT'S WHY THE TIMELINE --

103
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:02,709
BECAUSE PETER STRZOK, IN

104
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,377
PARTICULAR, STARTED SPENDING

105
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:04,545
TIME IN MAKING RESOURCES AND

106
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,547
SENDING THESE TEXT MESSAGES THAT

107
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:07,915
THEY CAN COMPARE THE TIMELINES.

108
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,549
>> Melissa: BEFORE ANY WHY

109
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,983
DIDN'T HE THINK I'M IS WHAT

110
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,585
YOU'RE SAYING.

111
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:12,853
BEFORE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS, THEY

112
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:13,554
WERE ALREADY --

113
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,155
>> Jason: BEFORE THEY HAD

114
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:15,889
EVIDENCE, WHERE THE ALLOCATING

115
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,458
RESOURCES TO TRY AND DO THIS?

116
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,560
IS THE QUESTION.

117
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:20,327
SPEAKER IT'S INTERESTING,

118
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,495
BECAUSE A LOOK AT BEST AND

119
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:22,062
THINK, WHAT WOULD SOME

120
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:24,798
OPERATIVES ON HILLARY CLINTON'S

121
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,068
CAMPAIGNS, WHAT HAS     WHERE TA

122
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:28,302
CAMPAIGNS, WHAT HAS     WHERE TE

123
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:28,602
DONE?

124
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:29,870
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

125
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:30,604
IN THIS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

126
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,573
TO WANT TO MAKE YOUR BOSS HAPPY.

127
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:35,375
WHO WANTED TO LIVE OR SOMETHING,

128
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:36,577
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH BOTH SIDES.

129
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:38,545
THEY REACHED INTO INTERNATIONAL

130
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,814
FILTH IN ORDER TO GET OPPOSITION

131
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:44,451
RESEARCH ON THEIR OPPONENTS.

132
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:46,787
WAS GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS GOADED

133
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:50,357
INTO BREAKING THE LAW, OR WAS HE

134
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:54,528
SOMEHOW -- I DON'T KNOW -- GIVEN

135
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:55,729
LIQUOR AND GIVEN THIS

136
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,430
INFORMATION SO HE WOULD SPILL

137
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:59,133
WHAT HE KNEW IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY

138
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:00,134
THIS?

139
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:01,535
TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE

140
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,736
ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE FBI?

141
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:03,971
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THINGS

142
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:05,472
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

143
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:08,775
SO MANY QUESTIONS ON BOTH SIDES.

144
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,511
HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

145
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:13,347
ABLE TO INVESTIGATE PEOPLE, AND

146
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:14,414
WHAT MEANS THEY ARE WILLING TO

147
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:17,084
USE AND ARE CAPABLE OF USING TO

148
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:17,750
EXTRACT INFORMATION WITHOUT

149
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:21,155
SOMEONE'S KNOWLEDGE.

150
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,723
THAT LEADS TO GROSS ABUSES OF

151
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:25,759
POWER, REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN

152
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,059
POWER.

153
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,161
>> Harris: ADRIENNE?

154
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,562
>> Adrienne: I THINK GEORGE

155
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:29,763
PAPADOPOULOS IS TRYING TO GET A

156
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:30,764
BOOK DEAL RIGHT NOW.

157
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:32,933
HE MIGHT BE TRYING TO GET A

158
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:33,967
TELEVISION DEAL.

159
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,269
>> Harris: OH, BOY.

160
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,003
>> Adrienne: I THINK HE ENJOYS

161
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:40,807
THE LIMELIGHT.

162
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:42,342
HE'S BEEN USING HIS TWITTER FEED

163
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:43,744
RECENTLY TO PEDDLE SOME

164
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:44,578
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

165
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:45,412
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TODAY HE

166
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,281
WILL BE TRYING TO SAY THIS IS

167
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:48,815
LIKE A DEEP STATE CONSPIRACY

168
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:49,149
THEORY.

169
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,017
I DON'T KNOW...

170
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:53,554
IT TO ME HIGHLIGHTS THE

171
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:54,755
IMPORTANCE OF WHY WE HAVE THIS

172
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:55,189
INVESTIGATION.

173
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,658
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

174
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,392
HAPPENED.

175
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,594
>> Jason: YOU THINK THE

176
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,195
MUELLER INVESTIGATION --

177
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,596
>> Melissa: USE PAID BY THE

178
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:04,097
RUSSIAN SOMEHOW, THOUGH?

179
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:05,933
>> Adrienne: I DON'T KNOW.

180
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,034
>> THEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

181
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,569
POLLUTION.

182
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,670
MANY OF PEOPLE BEING PAID BY

183
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,370
FOREIGN ENTITIES IN ORDER TO

184
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:12,172
AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE

185
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:12,539
CAMPAIGN.

186
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,941
HAVE WE SEEN THAT YET?

187
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:14,575
>> Adrienne: NO.

188
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:17,144
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN --

189
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:19,146
>> IS NOT THE POINT OF THE

190
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:19,580
INVESTIGATION?

191
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:20,914
>> Adrienne: YOU GET PEOPLE

192
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:21,648
BIKE GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS WERE

193
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:22,316
MORE THAN HAPPY TO TESTIFY

194
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:27,754
BECAUSE THEY ENTER THE     TILLM

195
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:27,788
BECAUSE THEY ENTER THE     TILLK

196
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,355
BECAUSE THEY ENTER THE     TILLE

197
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,122
ENJOYED THE LIMELIGHT.

198
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:30,757
>> Jason: THAT'S UNFAIR.

199
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:31,592
HE WAS CALLED FOR THE CONGRESS

200
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:33,927
THE FIRST TIME, AND YOU SAY IT'S

201
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:35,729
BECAUSE HE LIKES THE LIMELIGHT?

202
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,730
IT >> Adrienne: LOOK AT HIS

203
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,798
TWITTER FEED.

204
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:38,865
HE HAS CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

205
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:39,933
>> Jason: YOU HAVE TOO MUCH

206
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,335
TIME ON YOUR HANDS IF YOU'RE

207
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:43,170
WATCHING HIS TWITTER FEED.

208
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:44,338
>> Adrienne: I'M READING ABOUT

209
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:44,738
IT.

210
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,173
>> Jason: I THINK IT'S UNFAIR

211
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:47,574
SOMEBODY TO TRY AND CAST

212
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:48,275
DISPERSION UPON THE PRAYED I

213
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:48,976
DON'T THINK HE ASKED FOR THIS.

214
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:50,410
I DON'T THINK HIS LIFE IS BETTER

215
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,079
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN THROWN INTO

216
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,214
THIS PREDICAMENT THAT HE HAS.

217
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:55,415
I DO THINK HE HAS SOMETHING HE

218
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,450
WANTS TO SHARE.

219
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,317
THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE OUT

220
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:59,386
THERE, THE HIGHEST ECHELONS OF

221
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,622
THE FBI WERE ACTING

222
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:02,756
INAPPROPRIATELY.

223
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:03,624
THAT'S WHY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

224
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,424
DOESN'T WRITE WHAT HE HAS

225
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:04,758
WRITTEN.

226
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,294
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED

227
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:08,395
WITH THE FISA VISAS AND THE

228
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:10,897
OTHER ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE,

229
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:11,898
THAT NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN.

230
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:12,766
>> Harris: ONE THING WE DO

231
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,268
WANT TO SAY, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

232
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:17,437
WONDERING, PAPADOPOULOS HAS LIED

233
00:06:17,438 --> 00:00:00,000
TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS.
