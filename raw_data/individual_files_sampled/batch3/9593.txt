Greg: KANYE WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WONDER IF THEY TRY TO SCARE HIM INTO NOT WEARING HIS HAT. THEY TRIED TO SCARE MEET TO NOT WEAR THIS HAT, MY OWN FRIENDS. HIS HAT, IT GIVES ME POWER IN A WAY. I LOVE HILLARY. I LOVE EVERYONE. BUT THE CAMPAIGN "I'M WITH HER," DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL, AS A GUY, IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL I DIDN'T SEE MY DAD IN. WHEN I PUT THIS HAT ON, IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN. SUPERMAN IS MY FAVORITE SUPERHERO. Greg: WHEN THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, AMERICA DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. IF HE DON'T LOOK GOOD, WE DON'T LOOK GOOD. THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT. HE HAS TO BE THE FRESHEST, FLY ASKED, BEST. WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR CORE RE-EMPOWER. WE HAVE TO BRING JOBS INTO AMERICA AND WE ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN POSITION TO HAVE TO DO THINGS TO END UP IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. President Trump: THAT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. Greg: ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS TODAY. ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS TODAY. WE JUST HAVE TODAY. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE HERO'S JOURNEY. TRUMP IS ON HIS HERO'S JOURNEY RIGHT AND HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE A CRAZY LIKE KANYE WEST, HAVE SUPPORT. BEST BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT. Greg: JUST ANOTHER DAY IN TRUMP WORLD. THIS IS A NEW FRONTIER FULL OF INCREDIBLE ALLIES AND SURREAL SURPRISES. AFTER BEING TOLD IT WAS GOING TO BE THE APOCALYPSE, WE HAVE A BOOMING ECONOMY AND RIDICULOUSLY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, NEW JUSTICE, NO UGLY WARS, PROGRESS, TRADE, PEACE IN KOREA AND YOU HAVE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MALE POP STAR GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO DISCUSS BIG ISSUES AND GETTING WHAT SEEMS TO BE A REAL CONCESSION. HE WOULD THINK HE WOULD RECEIVE MEDIA ACCLAIM FOR TRYING. YOU WOULD BE WRONG. THAT WAS BONKERS. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET A THOUGHTFUL PLAY-BY-PLAY AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS, YOU'RE NOT. THAT WAS AN ASSAULT ON OUR WHITE HOUSE. THAT WAS CRAZY. THAT WAS BONKERS. Greg: SUCH RIDICULE BY THOSE WHO WOULD NEVER THINK OF TAKING SUCH RISKS. THEY CALLED IT BONKERS AND CRAZY. DOG WHISTLES MEANT TO BRING UP CONNIE'S MENTAL STATE. SORRY, IF YOU USE MENTAL ILLNESS IS A DISQUALIFYING FACTOR TO EXPRESS AN OPINION, YOU WOULD HAVE NO GUESTS ON YOUR NETWORK. AFTER TODAY, EXPECT A PILE ON. "SNL" WILL DO A SKIT THAT WILL BE MUCH LESS ENTERTAINING THAN THE REAL THING AND THE MEAN GIRLS AT CNN WILL CALL HIM NAMES, LIKE THEY DID LAST NIGHT. HE IS AN ATTENTION WHORE LIKE THE PRESIDENT. HE'S THE MODEL SPOKESMAN. HE'S THE TOKEN Greg: OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. Greg: WHEN YOU ARE ON TV GIVING A HOT TAKE, HOLD OFF ON THE ACCUSATIONS OF ATTENTION SEEKING. WEST CAN HANDLE IT. THE WITH THE RISK HE IS TAKING L THE WITH THE RISK HE IS TAKING F THE WITH THE RISK HE IS TAKING S HIM ABOVE AND BEYOND THE GROUPTHINK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE DOES THIS. I LOVE THIS GUY. LET ME GIVE THIS GUY A HUG. I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. President Trump: THAT'S REALLY NICE. JIM, KANYE, I APPRECIATE IT. LET'S GO HAVE SOME LUNCH. Greg: JESSE, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. THERE IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY VERY POWERFUL I FOUND IT TO BE VERY POWERFUL. I DON'T KNOW. Jesse: WAS A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT. THINK ABOUT THE RAW TALENT IN THAT ROOM. JIM BROWN, ONE OF THE GREATEST RUNNING BACKS EVER, KANYE WEST, ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED ARTISTS OF ALL TIME. AND DONALD TRUMP, TALENTED POLITICIAN AND BUSINESSMAN. SITTING TOGETHER AND IT WAS A SPECIAL MOMENT. HE PLAYED A REALLY IMPORTANT SOUND BITE. KANYE SAID BECAUSE CHINA HAS STOLEN ALL OF OUR FACTORY JOBS FROM THE INNER CITIES AND FROM THE CORE OF AMERICA, IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE YOUNG BLACK AMERICANS ARE NOW TAKING RISKS AND DOING ILLEGAL THINGS TO FEED THEIR FAMILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS ANYMORE AND THEY ARE GETTING PUT IN JAIL. IF YOU CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND IF YOU CAN GET BLACK AMERICA BUY INTO THE "AMERICA FIRST" AGENDA, MADE IN AMERICA, TRADE AGENDA, THE ENERGY AGENDA, IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THIS COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER OF ALL STRIPES AND FIGHTING FOR A NATIONALISTIC, PATRIOTIC ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR THE COUNTRY. THE MEDIA IS ALREADY FRAMING IT AS NEGATIVE, SAYING THAT IT WAS AN ANGRY RANT. WHEN TAYLOR SWIFT WHEN TAYLOR SWIFT KATY PERRY, THEY DO THOSE THINGS, THEY'RE CALLED EXPRESSIONS, SOULFUL EXPRESSIONS, PASSIONATE. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE MEDIA IS TRYING TO TRICK YOUR MIND AND I THOUGHT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO WATCH THE RAW FOOTAGE. IT WAS MORE THAN YOU PLAYED. IT WAS EYE-OPENING. Greg: JUAN, THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE ADMIRED WITCHES HE WENT IN THERE AND HE COMPLEMENTED DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPED DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEI DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEN DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEW DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEA DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPET DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEH DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEE DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEB DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEL DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEE DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPES DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPEW DONALD TRUMP AND THEN HE SLIPPES IMPORTANT, THAT THEY HAD TO STOP STOP AND FRISK IN CHICAGO BECAUSE IT'S DESTRUCTIVE. THE LOOK ON TRUMP'S FACE WAS LIKE, OKAY. YOU CAN LAUGH. YOU CAN LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM BUT I BELIEVE HE GOT A CONFESSION OUT OF TRUMP. Juan: I WAS GOING TO ASK, WHAT CONCESSION? DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO BACK OFF OF STOP AND FRISK? Greg: TRUMP HAS GOTTEN SO MUCH OUT OF THIS. I THINK THERE'S A GENUINE AFFECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN THAT HE WILL PROBABLY GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT, IN EXCHANGE FOR SOMETHING ELSE. Juan: I DIDN'T SEE ANY MAJOR CONCESSION ON THE TABLE BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE SUBSTANCE. INSTEAD, I SEE A CELEBRITY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND I THINK THE OVAL OFFICE SHOULD BE TREATED WITH SOME RESPECT AND THE IDEA THAT HE GOES IN THERE AND HE'S USING SUCH AWFUL LANGUAGE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY COOL. Jesse: WAS BILL CLINTON RESPECTFUL OF THE OFFICE? Juan: HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THIS GUY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WOULD THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY. TO THE CONTRARY. THIS IS TRUMP I THINK SPEAKING TO HIS WHITE BACKERS AND SAYING I'M NOT A RACIST. Jedidiah: COME ON. Juan: KANYE WEST IS HERE WITH ME SO ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT ME CALLING PEOPLE DOGS AND COMING FROM S-HOLE COUNTRIES, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. Greg: IF A WHITE PERSON IS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A BLACK LEADER, YOUR ANSWER IS TO Juan: THIS BEHAVIOR BY TRUMP DIDN'T START YESTERDAY. HE HAD BLACK PEOPLE COMING IN, LIKE JIM BROWN, STEVE HARVEY. AND KANYE WEST. AT TRUMP TOWER. WHAT CAME OUT OF IT? ZERO. THIS IS THE POINT. Greg: IT'S CALLED PROGRESS. Juan: PROGRESS IN TERMS OF TRUMP SAYING FORGET ALL THE THINGS I'VE DONE. I HAVE A BLACK FRIEND, KANYE WEST. Jedidiah: IF KANYE WANTED TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND TALKED TO TRUMP, HE WOULD BE LABELED RACIST. IF KANYE WANTS TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND TALK TO TRUMP, HE'S LABELED RACIST. YOU HAVE TO GIVE KANYE CREDIT. I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH HIM THEN SOMETIMES I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING BUT HE GOES IN AND SPEAKS HIS MIND AND KANYE WEST KNOWS HE'S GOING TO BE ABUSED BY EVERYBODY IN HOLLYWOOD AND EVERYONE IN HIS BUBBLE, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE FUN OF HIM AND BERATE HIM AND HE DOESN'T CARE AND FRANKLY THAT IS INSPIRATIONAL. WE SHOULD BE TELLING EVERYBODY IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE AND YOU CAN PUT POLICY ON THE TABLE, STOP AND FRISK OR WHATEVER. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT STOP AND FRISK. IT'S AN ACCOMPLISHED ACCOMPLISHMENT. Juan: WHEN YOU HAVE THIS GUY SAYING LET'S DO AWAY WITH THE 13TH AMENDMENT WHICH ENDED SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU THINK I THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG. Greg: THERE WERE SEVEN SUBSTANCE ON THAT. IS HE SOMEONE SOMEONE WILLING TO SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS B SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS C SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS U SACRIFICE HIS COOL CREDENTIALS E HE BELIEVES IN IT. IN THE MESSAGE IS NOT A SINGLE NEGATIVE MESSAGE. Dana: WHEN YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE THE FREEDOMS AND THE FINANCIAL SECURITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A RISK AND DO WHAT YOU WANT, YOU CAN BE A LEADER IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I ALSO THINK EVERYONE NEEDS TO SLEEP ON IT. WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE. JUAN FEELS PASSIONATELY AND I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY DO. THEN GO BACK YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS AT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE IN FLORIDA. HE LOVES THE POLICE. HE SUPPORTS THE POLICE. HE SAYS THE ONLY ADMINISTRATION THAT'S BEHIND YOU, THAT HYPERBOLE BUT PART OF IT IS TRUSTING THE POLICE TO DO SOMETHING. KANYE WEST SAYS I DON'T LIKE STOP AND FRISK. MAYBE THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE HAS THE POWER OF CONVENING, BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TWO SIDES TALK. STOP AND FRISK ISN'T GOING TO STOP BECAUSE POLICE THINK IT'S EFFECTIVE. UNLESS THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE YOU GO TO COURT. Greg: I MENTION THREE WEEKS AGO THAT COLIN KAEPERNICK SHOULD GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND MEET WITH TRUMP, AND THAT WAS THE OTHER THING THE KANYE WEST SAID. HIS GOAL IS TO BRING KAEPERNICK AND TRUMP TOGETHER, CONVENING. Dana: THIS WHITE HOUSE IS VERY TELEVISION SAVVY. SOMETIMES THEY SET UP SHOTS THEY DO NOT WORK FOR THEM. THIS ONE IS INTERESTING. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BEHIND THE DESK. USUALLY WHEN HE HAS A MEETING WITH SOMEBODY IN THE OVAL OFFICE, HE IS WITH A WORLD LEADER OR SOMEONE, NIKKI HALEY, THEY WERE IN THE CHAIRS. THE PRESIDENT KNEW. HE DIDN'T ELEVATE KANYE WEST TO THAT LEVEL. I'M GOING TO SIT BEHIND THE DESK AND WERE GOING TO HAVE A MEETING AT THE SHOP, THE WAY IT'S SET UP, THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE SHOT, YOU CAN SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP A LITTLE BIT. THE PROFILE OF KANYE WEST AND ALL OF THE MEDIA. IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH WITH THE SOUND OFF, AS I DID, WHEN I WAS GETTING HAIR AND MAKEUP DON DONE. I THOUGHT IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, NOT IN A BAD WAY. IT WAS DIFFERENT. WE ARE IN A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. YOU CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS LIKE THE ONES THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU CONVENE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT. WE ARE NOT AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS FOR CERTAIN THINGS. WHEN YOU HAVE PEACE AND PROSPERITY, YOU CAN DEAL WITH THESE THINGS. Greg: MIGHT I QUOTE SCOTT ADAMS? HE SAID WE DON'T HAVE A MONEY
