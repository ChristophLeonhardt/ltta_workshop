it's close to midnight in the
israeli-occupied Golan Heights just a
few hundred yards from the increasingly
dangerous Syrian border a team of
Israeli soldiers is preparing for a
special operation it's potentially
dangerous and it's the first time
they've invited journalists to witness
anything like it
love your father upset you Delilah sugar
will go up
for Lester
we put a lot
don't speed I don't know below me
I do Tel Aviv
like seriously color machine is smaller
severely cosmic evolution is a machete
we wait as the vehicles drive towards
the border into darkness five minutes
later some news over the radio
forgive me mashallah mashallah
he bought a siave Britain versus a arena
it's gonna be interesting
before long the unit returns the first
part of their mission is a success only
the mission probably isn't what you
think
rather than fighting their enemies the
Israelis are rescuing them
the soldiers are bringing three wounded
Syrian fighters into Israeli territory
for urgent medical care
that's it
my gosh my name
what we're seeing here is really quite
astounding a group of Israeli soldiers
training fighters from Syria
you couldn't have imagined it happening
two years ago but it just goes to show
how unpredictable the Middle East has
become and how much this region is
changing about a mile away in Syria an
al-qaeda affiliate known as jamaat al
nusra has seized a swath of land and
Syria's army is trying to take it back
this footage is from a bloody battle
earlier in the day most likely where the
three rescued Syrians were wounded
earlier in the day we drove to a nearby
lookout point in a closed military zone
to get closer to the fighting we've come
up to the Golan Heights in area that's
controlled by Israel it's been
controlled by Israel since 1967 and this
is a tank left over from that period
when they fought a war with Syria for
control of this area since then this has
been the quietest border in Israel
they've only had to deal with conflict
pretty much on the Lebanese side and
with Gaza that's starting to change with
the civil war in Syria raging for the
last two years this has suddenly become
Israel's hottest border
it's easy to hear and see the
not-too-distant sound of shelling on
this day al-nusra forces are fighting
the Syrian army for control of the main
road to Damascus
you can really see things quite clearly
inside Syria from this close-up you can
see the streets you can see all of the
detail of the buildings with binoculars
you can even see the fighters but as is
the case with Syria's deeply complicated
civil war itself it's hard to make out
who the fighters are and what exactly
they're fighting before for now they've
largely left Israel alone
and Israel has tried on the surface to
appear neutral but there are new signs
that Israel is siding with the rebels
United Nations observers recently
reported witnessing IDF soldiers
allowing what appeared to be two
unwanted rebel fighters into Israeli
territory still the IDF maintains that
it's only interaction with rebels is in
humanitarian missions like this no yells
okay
so we've got the three casualties in
there it looks like the guy on the
ground is in a lot of pain
the other two seem more or less okay but
they just might be out of it
but this right here this is the fallout
from the most violent war in the world
today
hi okay lo la mouche Evaline is not easy
to end of trouble la Tasha even racial
awful Aziz Allah attention of a
cobalamin got7 Oh God
Megan honey look at the end of the
school
according to arrest I'm attorney in this
facility coordinating with come on
Shelley on yes captain
all this - about them oh you must attend
oh yeah sure Oh
they bring the wounded fighters to a
nearby hospital it can't be overstated
what an unusual relationship this is for
everyone involved
Israelis treating fighters who in some
cases are bent on Israel's destruction
but since the start of Syria's Civil War
about a thousand three hundred Syrians
have quietly received medical treatment
inside Israel what's the prognosis for
these guys are they gonna survive so
they'll be okay maybe the guy with six
legs we have a long-term treatment but
we'll be okay what we're seeing is a
high level of coordination from the
Israeli military directed towards
helping these fighters from inside Syria
the question I'm asking myself is do
they have a deal with one particular
faction fighting on the other side of
the border and if they do what is Israel
getting in exchange so far we've seen
according to Israel's own statistics
that 90% of the people that they're
treating have been men so I'm gonna leap
to the conclusion that most of them have
been fighters I think Israel sees this
as being in its overall interests but I
want to know more specifics Debra Thomas
Hauk anymore I think I saw a in the most
honest way animation Jabbar Thomas Vanek
