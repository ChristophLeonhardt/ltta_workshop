this is why no government bureaucracy can create anything good why no big Hollywood studio and it's cookie cutter meddling can create anything good no it's the madmen the rebels there's one in a million people that can see something that no one else sees that will risk what no one else will risk and have the dedication to make something that truly captivates well despite his quirks and many flaws Tom Cruise is a madman and once again delivers on the mission impossible franchise giving us one of the best action movies in decades I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and it must be said that Mission Impossible Fallout and the other mission apostle movies could only be made if Tom Cruise didn't own the rights to the story and beat one of the producers to make the decisions for the film and this allows him to make the movies he wants to make and get the movie insurance necessary for the project that no other producer would have signed off on because no studio would let a now 56 year old actor do what he did in this movie anyway let's get into Mission Impossible fall out as a viewer I give this movie a 5 out of 5 this really is the unkillable franchise and all credit to Tom Cruise for not letting paramount just cash in on the popularity and cut corners now from start to finish this movie is action-packed funny exciting it has tension and most importantly has a heartbeat that lets you feel and be connected these characters so you care about them in these extraordinary circumstances there is something that every viewer watching this movie will enjoy so let's start with one of my favorites and before we get to the incredible stunts and heartbeat of this movie let's get into the action my bread and butter there is simply one of the best fight scenes ever put to film in this movie the action scene with Henry Cavill Tom Cruise and lien yang which takes place in that white bathroom is absolutely heart-pounding its mission impossible at its best it's textbook in its specificity and care for the characters going on it's not just two meatheads punching each other everything is planned out and written out it tells its own story there's an inciting incident there is a loss of hope there is a gradual build and each character shows their unique personalities in their fighting skills you see them moving waver in their own fight it's absolutely amazing to watch now as a critic I'm gonna give this movie a 5 out of 5 boom now story in any action movie is what turns an action movie from good to great and specifically in the story the motivation in fallout is so well done every character's motivation is not just to be good to be good or to be bad to be bad no no let's take the two main players for instance the two sides of the same coin Ethan Hunt and Solomon Lane both men want world peace they just have two completely different courses of action to get to the same goal and both make some sense and that's why it's so fun to watch now this stunt and this is actually important I don't even know where to begin here first off Tom Cruise is a warrior of stylistic purity in these films would you be willing to train days weeks for this one shot that takes two seconds on screen like for example in the last Mission Impossible movie Tom Cruise training with military divers for weeks and months so he could literally hold his breath for six minutes straight to get the underwater shots that is crazy or him spending a year to do the helicopter scenes where he actually learned how to fly the helicopter to do all the stunts going through the maneuvers planning the drop scene all of that took a year of preparation to finally shoot and they actually dropped him from that helicopter onto that piece of cargo and bounced off which is a 40-foot drop while hanging from a helicopter it's just crazy to watch and the halo jump scene in the movie was absolutely unbelievably there were over a hundred different sky dives to get the shots they needed they trained in the world's largest wind tunnel to be able to do this choreography in the air finally have these actors worked for months and months and months Tom actually jumped out the plane they could only shoot for three minutes at a time each day at night to get the right lighting to pull off this shot so when you see it it's actually happening my favorite thing in this movie was a small one this just shows the kind of dedication that you have to be willing to give to get movies and shots like these and that is this in the movie where Tom Cruise runs in the buildings and jumps across these two buildings in London smashing us the wall and climbing up well he breaks his ankle in this scene they did the whole scene in one shot running jumping falling climbing breaks his ankle on the wall you can see it snapped in the video and he actually climbs up and finishes the shot so he can run past camera and then goes immediately to the hospital that's dedication and that it's a movie start as crazy as I know he is and all the things that he does that disagree with hats off to you man hats off to you and in a world of Studios cutting corners and using CGI because it's cheaper or easier whatever there is something about you being in the audience watching real people in the real places doing these real things that absolutely captivate you now for my favourite values I'll give it a four out of five yes the stunts and action are great but what makes this movie not just fun but excellent are the values shown on screen specifically Ethan Hunt he is a hero because he will sacrifice himself for anyone who is innocent he would do the same thing to save one innocent human being that he would do for a million its sacrificial its patriotic its heroic anyway I know I've been heaping praise in this movie but I really hope you go see us in theatres I hope more people are allowed in to have creative reigns and freedom of these films and projects we don't get the same cookie cutter movies from studios that are like okay we want to do this because this worked and we want you to do this or whatever no I want the madmen the crazy creative types to make unbelievable films again and to get them in the theaters I've been tazed this is pure Hollywood all right so if you enjoyed that video please consider becoming a premium member to the rebel that way you have first access to pure Hollywood
