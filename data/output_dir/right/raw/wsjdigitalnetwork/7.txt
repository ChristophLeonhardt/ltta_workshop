1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
- It's a cool bike, right?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,713
Let's steal it.

3
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:05,518
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,140
So even though this isn't my bike,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,080
I can legally and easily take it

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,790
or any of the other 249 just like it

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,240
roaming around San Francisco.

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,490
It's part of a system called Uber Bike,

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,660
and it's Uber for bikes.

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,920
Bike-sharing used to be
only in ultra-yuppie places

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,420
like Brooklyn and San Francisco,

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,880
but it'll likely hit
most major U.S. cities

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,713
before too long.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,440
There are really two different kinds

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,620
of bike-sharing these days.

16
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,160
This one's pretty straightforward.

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,060
Companies just set up racks
full of bikes all over a city.

18
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,100
But these big racks won't fit everywhere,

19
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,680
so sometimes you have to walk 10 minutes

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,700
just to get a bike.

21
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,150
The more interesting
bike-sharing is dockless.

22
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,450
It's even simpler, you
ride until you're done,

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,600
leave the bike wherever, the end.

24
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,620
You use an app to locate
and unlock the bike,

25
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,160
then pay for time or get
an unlimited membership.

26
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,380
The Bay area is kind of an
impossible city to get around.

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,250
You get to choose between public transit,

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,350
which is probably broken,

29
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,380
and traffic, which is probably horrible.

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,050
Biking's usually the fastest way anywhere,

31
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,760
but have you seen the hills?

32
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,700
This bike's made by a company called JUMP

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,450
which is working with Uber
on a pilot in San Francisco.

34
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,460
It's actually electric,
and with this motor

35
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,690
making every pedal way more powerful,

36
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,090
it's a really easy ride.

37
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,360
It's really great for
riding a couple of miles

38
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,880
to the train station or popping
over to the grocery store.

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,900
I've found it turns a 30-minute
walk into a 12-minute ride,

40
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,930
and I'm only paying $2 a half hour.

41
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,230
Uber Bikes actually requires
you to lock the bike

42
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,440
to a pole or tree or
something when you're done,

43
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,930
using a U-lock like this one.

44
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,710
As long as you've put this in,

45
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,210
the bike thinks it's locked

46
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,760
and you're not paying any more.

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,990
But if you stash it somewhere

48
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,640
like in your garage or in this bush,

49
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,280
it'll be right there where you left it.

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,180
This definitely violates the
Terms of Service, by the way.

51
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,680
The downside of no bike stations

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,200
is that it's harder to find
a bike when you need it.

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,360
I've walked up to bikes that
turned out to be out of service

54
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,890
for charging or maintenance
or already reserved

55
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,210
and I've reserved bikes that
I then just couldn't find

56
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,510
on the street anywhere.

57
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,630
I've seen a few broken
bikes around San Francisco,

58
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,940
just totally stripped for parts,

59
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,529
and some other cities are
having even worse problems.

60
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,750
There's a lot for Uber

61
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,810
and all these other bike-sharing
companies to figure out

62
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,190
if they want to keep these
bikes charged and available.

63
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,250
Still, it's a pretty great ride,

64
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,240
fast, easy, and usually
ridiculously convenient

65
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,010
and, even though the pedals
are doing most of the work,

66
00:02:25,010 --> 00:00:00,000
I still get to feel like I'm exercising.
