all right hope you all had a great weekend now here's a story that that seems too hilarious to be true but but it is true Elizabeth Warren has released actually released DNA test results to prove that she is Native American and here's the report from The Daily Beast it says senator Elizabeth Warren has taken the extraordinary step of releasing DNA test results that provide strong evidence quote unquote that she has Native American ancestry the possible Democratic presidential contender from 2020 has been repeatedly mocked by Donald Trump and other Republicans of her ancestral claims one of trumps sick jokes is to call Warren Pocahontas I actually think that's maybe one of his best joke I think it's his by far his best best nickname anyway so let's get to the meat of this the analysis of Warren's DNA was reportedly done by Carlos Bustamante a Stanford University professor and shows that she had a Native American in her family wait wait for this okay wait for this get ready she had a Native American in her family tree dating back six to ten generations ago not six to ten years ago six to ten Jen not even six to ten decades ago six to ten generations ago that's the and she's actually released this as I mean has this woman lost her mind that that's a serious question I mean is she is she I know she's getting up there an age I'm just wondering if there's some kind of senility setting in or something because all she's done here is confirm that her Native American claims were erroneous this is no this is what her this is what her opponents should be releasing no we have information that a that native of the Elizabeth Warren's Native American ancestral claims you know you know date back ten generations that's what that's what her her opponents should be saying this not not her she's just having one Native American in your family tree sometime in the timeframe of 180 to three hundred years ago okay that's what ten generations I think a generation like 30 years I think is what so if we're talking you know up to 10 generate that's three honey we could be talk about 300 years ago she had one Native American and her family 300 years ago and she thinks that that confirms her Native American heritage it does not Elizabeth Warren you are I'm afraid to say you are as white bread as ever unfortunately even more actually than a lot of people I'm white bread but but I mean like I bet I could go back if I if I were to date to go look at my family tree probably I wouldn't have to go back even six ten generations to find a minority which is and that's that's the thing here what you see here is how identity politics defeats itself because if the left accepts this which which it appears they are which is pretty funny in and of itself but if you if you go on Twitter and and you you read the thread under where Elizabeth Warren and now it makes this announcement about her Native American ancestry and you read what her followers her supporters are saying they're all celebrating it they're say yeah you you you really showed them Liz so they're accepting well the problem is if you accept this then that means that pretty much everyone in America is a minority I mean almost everybody is a minority by that definition which is the end of identity politics because the whole point of identity politics is to set up this dynamic where you've got the persecuted minorities and then the evil white people and that's the dynamic of identity politics but if if you can escape the evil white people camp simply by showing that somewhere in the distant past in your in your bloodline there was a minority and ethnic minority if that's enough to get you out of the then there's not gonna be anyone left there are gonna be no evil white people left because now we're all minorities apparently it's just it's pretty incredible but I'm sure we'll continue to follow this breaking news story as it develops in the meantime two other things I wanted to talk about first of all over the weekend the media launched what I think is is one of the most dishonest attacks of President Trump that we've yet seen which I know is saying quite a lot what Trump was at a rally in Ohio and he began at this rally he he went off on this thing about about ulysses s grant because grant is a native of Ohio so he was complimenting General Grant which is a perfectly fine thing to do he said that the general was quote incredible and he pointed out how grant beat Robert Ely which Trump said is is especially impressive because Lee himself was a great general he was saying I forget the exact quote but Trump said that you know Lee was beating everybody Lincoln was scared of him couldn't figure out and then Grant comes in and kicks his butt you know so this is all in the context of trying to trying to pump up ulysses s grant but the media had all it need needed right there as soon as I think the media they were they they started licking their chops as soon as they as soon as they heard Trump start talking about civil war generals they were ready they were ready to copy and paste and do what they had to do because that was going to give them all the material that they needed all they needed well it didn't matter the context all they needed was for Trump to say something vaguely positive about a confederate about about a about a you know prominent Confederate figure that's all they needed and so they took that they they isolated the part where Trump called robert e lee great and they took that and they accused him of praising robert e lee without without mentioning that it was within the context of praising grant and so if you went online on saturday you would this is what you would have seen all over the place and if you were watching CNN this is what you Oh Trump Trump was at a rally and he just started praising robert e lee in fact NBC blatantly lied about what he said they went beyond they they took him out of context they did that also but they went beyond simply taking him out of context and they they just lied about it they said that they sent out a tweet reporting that Trump called Lee incredible when in fact Trump called grant incredible he never used that word for General Lee NBC did issue a correction we should say but they issued it two days later in the meantime which there's no reason why it should have taken two days all you had to do was actually watch the clip in question and you would have seen what he actually said so are we to believe that NBC it took NBC two days to actually watch the clip that they reported on and in the meantime in in between those those two days they along with the rest of the leftist media allowed this false narrative to seep in and fester and then they came back when and corrected it when everyone had already moved on and the narrative had metastasized in the subconscious of many people and then at that point they issued their little correction this is the game that they always play now this tactic by the media was dishonest and absurd obviously and the worst part is that they completely divorced Trump's content comments about Lee from the overall context they lied about it but even aside from that context what we also have here on display yet again is this this this idea that I mean I mean even if let's say that Trump was in Virginia doing a rally and and so he complimented robert e lee not even within the context of complimenting General Grant well so what who why would it even matter if he had done that I mean this idea is so silly that you this idea that you must not ever say anything positive about historical figures who we have decided our villains it is a silly childish dim-witted way of looking at history and it makes any serious study of history any insightful or useful analysis of history impossible if that's the way you're looking at it you know I got into this argument on Twitter on Saturday it was a travel day for me I was on planes all day so I didn't have anything better to do but argue about the civil war on Twitter so that's what I was doing and when this controversy was going on I pointed out that well first of all troubles taking out of context but but secondly I said Lee was a great general so so who cares it's true what he said Lee was a great general and a lot of people responded to that by saying well how could how could you say how dare you say that Lee supported slavery he fought for slavery he was pro-slavery fought for slavery how could you call him a great general now this shows not only historical ignorant but an attitude about history that makes it as I said impossible to actually analyze historical events and have a conversation about history first of all the question of robert e lee's feelings about slavery and his relationship to slavery has nothing to do with the question about whether or not he was a great general those are two completely different questions they are not related to the first question it's simply untrue and this is where the historical ignorance comes in it is untrue to say it is it is not true to say that that Lee was some big proponent of slavery and that he went to war to protect slavery that's not true Lee did not own slaves personally his feelings about slavery were not enlightened by by modern standards but by the standards of the time they were relatively moderate his stance on slavery was relatively moderate even liberal by the standards of the time Lee also would certainly have qualified as a he would if you were to take Robert Ely and put him into modern-day society and and put all of his views and everything again divorced from context in modern day society he would definitely qualify as a as a terrible racist but but so would Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln explicitly opposed equality of the races and he said so that he said that he does not in in any way support the social political or political equality of the black and white races ulysses s grant also would qualify the races his wife owned slaves grant himself for a time owned a slave but the bigger point here is that so you see they're making this point all the time that you you have to analyze the views and opinions of historical figures within the context of the time and what you certainly can't do is select individual historical figures and hold them to a modern standard but not anyone else from that time period you know we can't do that you can't take Abraham Lincoln and say well he was a great president great man yeah he was an avowed racist but but yet you know we got to see that within the context of the time we can't do that with Lincoln if we're not going to do with robert e lee so we have to decide are we going to see historical figures within the context of the time or not and if not then we have to treat everybody in history in the same way which means that everybody in history we have to see that we have to write them all off as just a bunch of racists and bigots and everything because ever because if you go back 200 years or 150 years and then go back to any point in history after you know before that everybody was bigoted talk to one you know into one degree or another so clearly we have to see things within the context of the time but the bigger point here is that Lee's opinions on racial issues had nothing to do with his decision to fight for the Confederacy Lee was not even in favor of secession he opposed secession now whatever reason the southern politicians had for seceding and slavery was a significant part of their reasons for sure but for Lee and for most Confederate officers and and and just soldiers the problem was different and for Lee you know he knew that if he fought for the Union he would be marching against his own home his own community his own family his own sons you know he would be fighting against them he would be taking up arms against his family and his home and his country and when I say country we have to understand again for the third time understanding things within the historical context if we do that then we then we then we realize that back in those days especially in the south when when you talked about your country you were talking about your state that's what you considered your country to be most people especially in the south they didn't feel this allegiance and this I did they didn't really identify themselves with the country as a whole they identified themselves with their communities and their states and that's that's the way the country was originally set up that we are a union of different states but each but you know you cared first and foremost about your community and your state because that's your wholeness where you live that's where your family is and especially back then without modern technology without the internet and phone and all that kind of stuff you really you could how could you identify with the entire Chi didn't really mean anything to you the entire country you know you had no you had really no concept of the whole country you had no I should say you had no real direct connection with it or to it but you did to to your land and your home and your family and so that's just the way people saw it back then so that was the that was the the decision he had to make he could march against his kids country his family his home or he could fight for the Confederacy and defend his family and his home and his country against those who were invading it and he chose the latter and that was by far and away his primary personal motivation it was not because he wanted to go and defend slavery it just it was that's just not the case in terms of his generalship there's no doubt that he was a great general he was always out manned outgunned lacking in basic resources like food and clothing and shoes he was facing an opponent with superior numbers superior technology superior resources and yet Lee won battle after battle after battle against enormous odds and that makes him a great general no matter how you feel about him personally I actually think that Trump gave too much credit to General Grant yeah grant beat Lee but but grant also faced Lee at a point when Lee was even more depleted and this was after the failure at Gettysburg so the writing was already on the wall at that point and Lee knew it after he failed in Gettysburg and had to retreat it was I mean it was pretty much over at that point and this was also after Lee had had lost Stonewall Jackson so grant was facing an already out manned and outgunned opponent at a point when that opponent was was even more weakened and he won which good for him but I'm not sure that I just I don't see why that's considered some sort of incredible accomplishment we only see it as an accomplishment because up to that point Lee had just been spanking every single Union General thrown his way and so that was kind of where the bar was was was set if you went up against General Lee it was kind of expected that he would just spank you but he didn't with with Grant so we consider at this huge achievement but I still think you have to consider what Lee was up against but wherever you fall on the question of who is the better jet better general it is silly to suggest that have some sort of moral duty to immediately side with grant on that question of who was the better of general because you just can't do history that way history it doesn't work like that that's like if I insisted that the only great musicians in history have been the ones who were had personally great character and were you know had had an integrity and all of that but if I insist on studying music that way and viewing musicians through that lens I'm gonna have to bypass like almost all of the great musicians of the last 200 years so you just can't do that also when it comes to analyzing the character of anyone including historical figures we can't look at them as cartoons as caricatures I think the truth is when you study history you'll see that there have been relatively few straightforward villains in history okay that is there there are relatively few people who are just plain evil with no shades of gray nothing just straightforward evil and that's it I think there are very few historical figures who fit that mold there are some obviously Hitler falls into that category Nero Caligula Stalin Pol Pot Attila the Hun but and there's a reason why we remember all those names because these were just down to their core evil people who were you know but that's unusual most historical figures are complex layered multifaceted there are shades and black shades of white they may have fought on the wrong side of an issue yet been personally heroic they may have fought on the right side yet been personally de botched all kinds of different combinations and what makes history so fascinating is precisely this dynamic because it reveals the hidden complexities of our past and of enough past of you know historical figures of the past that's what that's what makes it interesting to study history yet it seems we're just too dumb to ignorant too childish to study history in this way anymore which means that we cannot study it at all so if we're gonna look at the cent that at the Civil War and we're gonna say well everyone who fought for the south are all a bunch of scumbags evil terrible nothing good can be said about them if that's the kind of attitude that we bring to a historical analysis of something as complex and complicated as the Civil War then it's just we're not going to be able to learn anything about history we're going to be children who know nothing about history and that's the kind of country that we're living in now all right one other thing I wanted to talk about stepping aside from anything politically political or related to politics for a moment on Facebook over the weekend I shared a story that has been getting some attention after going viral and I'll just give you the brief synopsis of this story as the story goes an elderly man cancer survivor tragically disfigured from a life-saving surgery which which left him without a nose without with an empty eye socket so he's you know so he's been tragically disfigured and this man sat down to eat at a convenience store and was asked by the owner of the store to cover up so that he didn't upset her other customers and he left the store obviously very upset himself and he went home and he talked to his daughter about it his daughter then put this story out on Facebook giving the store owners named her business and a picture of her and then post went viral and the woman the daughter immediately started a GoFundMe account of course and began sharing that all over Facebook as well interestingly the GoFundMe account doesn't actually say what the money is being raised for I guess you would think well maybe this the money is to is for reconstructive surgery for the father which will be a great cause but the GoFundMe account doesn't say that does doesn't say what the money is going towards doesn't even say who's gonna get the money it's just this woman started to GoFundMe account and it's already raised like seventy thousand dollars or something like that in a couple of days meanwhile the owner of the store is getting blasted by everyone across the country and you could imagine she's getting a ton of hate mail probably a significant amount of death threats as well I don't know if that's the case or not we haven't really heard much from her which is part of the point here but that's the way these things always go anyone who's familiar with Internet outrage you know that there's always death threats involved so I would say it's almost a hundred percent certain that she's gotten death threats which would be concerning because her not here not only her name but her picture was put out there as well now the owner of the store did try to defend herself apparently she left a comment on the original post by the daughter saying that she the the store owner didn't mean to upset the man who hurt his feelings she said that he comes in every day and eats you know at the store and according to her it was driving customers away and so she says that finally after however many days of this she pulled the man aside privately and talked to him about it and she insists that she handled it the best way that she knows how now but obviously that did nothing to quell any of the outrage that's coming her way now here's the thing I obviously feel very bad for this man it's a terrible thing that he's going through and I won't defend the store owners behavior I think that she did the wrong thing we're really only getting one side of the story but based on what we know I'd say that she did the wrong thing I there's really no scenario where it would be appropriate to say that to a cancer survivor but I don't want to spend time analyzing the particular zuv this story what I do want to say is this we really need to stop turning personal grievances into fodder for public consumption I'm really uncomfortable with that I'm really uncomfortable with the way that people will now take it personal slight or insulted a suffered or someone that they loved suffered and then they put it out there for the entire world stirring up a mob and trying to get revenge that way I think it's even if there really was a slight or an insult even if something bad really did happen even if the person being singled out really did do something wrong the point is I just whatever happened to handling personal disputes privately whatever happened to personal disputes is like nothing is personal anymore everything is you have a problem with someone in your community just put it out there for everyone so that people that are a thousand miles away can chime in people have no idea about the situation don't know anyone involved don't know anything about the context don't know anything at all about the situation and yet they can come in and and and and their outrage can be heard as well I why does the whole world need to know about why does the whole world need to know about this situation between a woman her father and the owned owner of a rest stop convenience store I think the Internet has given everyone the ability to use public outrage as a weapon not only as a weapon but to monetize public outrage as well now we all have that ability and and I'm really uncomfortable uncomfortable with it for a number of reasons number one it's dangerous you know again even if you suffered even if you really have a legitimate grievance which I think that certainly this man does even though he's not the one who put this on Facebook his daughter did he is a legitimate grievance even if you have a legitimate grievance even if someone really did do something wrong which I think this owner did it it's if this it's a dangerous game to play when you put someone's name out there you put their face out there and you send the mob after them you you have no control over what happens next and I'm tell you something if you send the mob after somebody with their picture and their name attached even if they did something wrong again and then something happens to that person which you haven't which could happen but if that were to occur it would be partly your fault not just partly actually would be I mean it would be pretty much a hundred percent your fault it's just it is very dangerous and I think that um maybe if you've never been the target of overwhelming Internet outrage maybe you just don't understand what it's like okay if you've never been in a situation where you're getting death threats from all over the country left and right all you know and or people are showing up at your business or your house and threatening if you've never been that situation maybe you don't understand what it's like but it's a very terrifying thing and when you're in that situation you know that you're I mean your life's in jeopardy it only takes one crazy person who's really upset to show up and do something terrible so it's a dangerous game number two what good can really come of it what what's the point what does it accomplish where is there's there's like no sense of proportion anymore where's the proportionality of this so this woman did a really rude thing it's a terrible thing so that means what we got to destroy your life destroy your business put her life in jeopardy like that really that that we immediately jump to that and this is what you see with the with this example we're not given any indication at all that the daughter attempted to reach out to the owner herself privately first so she jumped right to I'm going to the public I'm getting the amount the mob whipped up I'm gonna have to go fund me account ready to go she went right to that she didn't even try anything else so it's a dangerous game it can't really accomplish anything positive yeah you can make some money off of it you could destroy the person's life in business but I don't really consider that a positive outcome and so there's those two props it's also it's just not it's not human you know it's like we've we've lost the ability to live personal lives and deal with things on a personal level we've lost that ability and I say this this is just one example you know we see this all the time I can tell you that every day or at least I'll say multiple times a week I get emails from people asking me to share something that they wrote on Facebook about an injustice that they supposedly suffered at the hands of a business owner or a school faculty member or community member or whatever I mean I get this all the time because because of course people like to air their grievances publicly but that doesn't mean that's going to go viral so sometimes you need that added accelerant and so people will come to me hoping that I'll be the accelerant of course I never do it but but it just shows that this this attitude that we have that we have a problem with someone personally what we're gonna do you know we're not gonna try to settle it with them we're not gonna go talk to them we're just gonna go right to the mob and look for revenge and maybe a little bit of cash as well on top of it and I really don't like that I don't think it's the right approach now there are look there are there are circumstances where maybe that is appropriate so if you if you're being persecuted in some way by some much more powerful institution especially a government institution then I think to get people involved to come to your aid I think could that could be the right approach I don't I still don't think it should be your first step but eventually maybe you do that maybe maybe and this is where the Internet can come in handy because it levels the playing field a little bit but a gripe that you have with the owner of a rest stop down the street okay that is not a more powerful person who you're being persecuted by that's just another normal person it was you know and I think so much so much of the time that's what it ends up being it's not that people are going up against a more powerful figure more powerful institution it's more just they're looking to settle a score with some other average person that they know and I think we need to be very careful about that and we need to think about potentially maybe trying to live our lives personally and privately a little bit and solving our problems that way at least trying to do that before we jump immediately to whipping up the mob we'll leave it there have a great day everyone talk to you tomorrow Godspeed you
