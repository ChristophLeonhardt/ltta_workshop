straight to the Indian capital whether Prime Minister that Narendra Modi and russia's President Vladimir Putin have signed a contract for the delivery of the s400 air defense systems with New Delhi ultimately defying threats of possible sanctions from Washington let's cross live to the Indian capital now RT is Akash down of joining us here on the program ie go to one aspect of the meeting that was not only evident but also remarked upon several times by both leaders was their mutual respect and close friendship and what other highlights of the meeting have we also heard about well Rory in fact Vladimir Putin and his Indian counterpart indeed right now right here and they're expected expected to pass right behind me well any minute now they're following their program but right now everything they're doing is sort of on a light note on the lighter side of things and if I may say so because they've arrived here after signing a batch of documents and they're well if I were to list you all areas of cooperation and all aspects that Russia and India have discussed today well really it would take too much of your and my time really but the biggest thing is the India is India purchasing the s400 anti-missile defense system it's not just it's not just a buying about buying Russian weapons and India expanding its defensive capabilities it's India giving a political statement it's India making a very bold geopolitical move because obviously it's not just regional rivals who may be on edge right now because of the acquisition it's also the United States because Washington has a problem every time anybody looks to buy and were indeed buys Russian weapons for example last time when China did that both the same anti-missile defense system and some fighter jets to go with it they were slammed with sanctions Washington imposed sanctions on them which well caused fury in Beijing now India is doing the same and it's doing in defiance of the of the previous warnings it has already heard from Washington the Pentagon one of the generals has said that the option of sanctions is indeed on the table and that well if India follows through with the purchase then it'll be up to the US president to decide whether or not to impose penalties so now they've done it and so it is interestingly it's Russia and China excuse me of course Russia and India doing business but really it's fair to say that the ball is now in America's court all right artoo you gotta turn off their live in New Delhi thank you you
