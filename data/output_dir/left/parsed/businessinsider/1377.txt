I've seen every conceivable way of
smuggling drugs in the United States one
case where somebody had heroin hidden in
false buttocks on their body that
actually exploded and killed the person
carrying those hiding drugs inside these
gas tanks so that the customs people
have to kind of open with a blowtorch
more recently we've seen some incredible
things like cartels using big catapults
to simply throw drugs over to board a
large catapult just put the drugs there
and boom over the border fence and then
somebody picks it up on the other side I
haven't seen a case of them using drones
but nothing is impossible
