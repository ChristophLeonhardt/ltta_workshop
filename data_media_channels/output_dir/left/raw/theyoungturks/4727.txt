1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,570
EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY
DEVOS IS UP TO HER OLD TRICKS.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,390
LET'S BE FAIR, LET'S FIND OUT,
WE WILL GO TO AN ARTICLE IN THE

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,420
HILL, SHE HAS APPOINTED SOMEONE
NEW INTO THE DEPARTMENT, LET'S

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,920
FIND OUT WHO IT IS --

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,089
>>HOLD, HOLD, HOLD -- LET'S FILL
IN THE REST OF THE SENTENCE.

6
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,529
THIS IS TO HELP STUDENTS WITH
THEIR LOANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE ON

7
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:32,529
THE SIDE OF THE EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT.

8
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:33,529
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO

9
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,710
BE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,590
YOU AND
YOUR KIDS AND YOUR LOANS.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,590
SO

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,690
NOW, WHAT MIGHT BE A REASONABLE
AND TO THAT SENTENCE?

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,690
FOUND

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,400
SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXPERT IN
HELPING STUDENTS WITH THEIR

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,470
LOANS, AND WHO HAS FOUGHT FOR
STUDENTS FOR LOWER LOANS, FOR

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,470
EXAMPLE.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,470
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE
SENSE?

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,470
IF YOU ARE ON THE SIDE OF

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,900
THE STUDENTS THAT WOULD MAKE
SENSE.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,470
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,090
REST OF THE SENTENCE IS --

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,369
>>OH WELL.

23
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:15,460
SO, FOX, MEET
HENHOUSE.

24
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,380
THE GUY WHOSE JOB IT

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,950
WAS TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT ON
STUDENTS AND THEIR LOANS IS NOW

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,729
BEING PUT IN CHARGE OF STUDENT
LOANS FROM THE GOVERNMENT SIDE.

27
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,149
GEE, I WONDER WHAT HE'S GOING TO
DO.

28
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,149
I CAN'T QUITE TELL.

29
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,149
THIS IS

30
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,070
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN
WE SAY TRUMP DIDN'T DRAIN THE

31
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,899
SWAMP, HE REBUILT THE SWAMP.

32
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,799
HE
IS THE SWAMP MONSTER.

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,799
HE CLAIMED

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,709
HE WAS AGAINST CORRUPTION, THEN
HE BRINGS IN HIS CRONIES AND

35
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,389
SAYS GO AHEAD, ROB THE PLACE
BLIND.

36
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,389
WHEN ASKED WHAT

37
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:51,009
EXPERIENCE HE HAS IN HELPING
STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO HELPING

38
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:55,369
HIMSELF GET RICH OFF OF
STUDENTS, THEY BRAGGED THAT HE

39
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:56,369
HAD --

40
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,270
>>THAT MAKES SENSE, SINCE HE
WAS THE CEO OF A PRIVATE STUDENT

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,649
LOAN COMPANY.

42
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:05,700
THEY FURTHER
EXPLAIN IN THE HILL --

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:22,820
>>IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT BY
DEFINITION HE'S A BAD GUY, MAYBE

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,060
THE REFINANCE LOANS, IN LOVELY
WAYS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO

45
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,060
INVESTIGATE.

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,820
I WOULD BE
SURPRISED, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.

47
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,000
SO I'M NOT JUDGING HIS COMPANY,
I'M JUST SAYING IF YOU PICKED AN

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,670
ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS THAT WOULD
MAKE MORE SENSE WHEN YOU TALK

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,330
ABOUT RUNNING THE FEDERAL
STUDENT AID.

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,330
MAY BE SOMEONE WHO

51
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,500
WORKED AT THE AID DEPARTMENT IN
THE UNIVERSITY.

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
BUT THEY DON'T

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,570
BELIEVE IN THAT, THEY BELIEVE IN
MAXIMIZING PROFITS OFF OF US, SO

54
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,700
THEY FIND A CEO AND PUT HIM IN
CHARGE WHO HAS MAXIMIZED PROFITS

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,860
OFF OF US.

56
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,500
THE HILL POINTS OUT
SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS FUNNY,

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
AND TELLING --

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,230
>>-- THE CREDENTIAL ABOUT HOW
HE WAS CEO OF THAT COMPANY --

59
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:13,260
>>THE ONLY VAGUE REFERENCE WAS
THE ONE I QUOTED YOU, WHERE IN

60
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,770
THE MIDDLE OF A LONG SENTENCE
THEY SAID HE HAS CEO-LEVEL

61
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,770
SKILL.

62
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,640
WITHOUT EXPANDING WHO HE
IS.

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,010
THE REASON HE HAS THAT SKILL

64
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,650
IS BECAUSE HE WAS THE CEO OF THE
GUYS ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S A

65
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,480
REVOLVING DOOR, SO WILL YOUR
STUDENT LOANS GET ANY BETTER?

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,140
GIVEN WHO WAS APPOINTED TO THAT
POSITION, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY.

67
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,900
AGAIN, ONE LAST TIME, IT'S NOT
TO SAY HE'S A BAD GUY, BUT THE

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,240
MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK FOR
YOUR LOANS, THE RICHER HIS

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,460
COMPANY GOT.

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,520
SO NOW WHEN THEY
PUT HIM IN CHARGE, DO YOU THINK

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,370
HE WILL WANT TO LOWER YOUR
LOANS, OR INCREASE YOUR LOANS?

72
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:05,560
JUST DO THE MATH 

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:00:00,000
ON IT, SEE
WHERE YOU COME OUT.
