I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today and what he did is an incredible offer he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people I think that's an incredible offer Donald Trump shocked even his harshest critics with his submission to Vladimir Putin this week likely included my next guest and joining me now for your moment of maxeen congresswoman Maxine Waters of California and congresswoman thank you so much for being here I really appreciate it welcome so were you I think much of the country was surprised to actually see Donald Trump in action with Vladimir Putin and how submissive he was in public what did you make of what what happened in Helsinki well I'm not surprised at all as a matter of fact I have for months I've been trying to tell the American public and everybody else that this president is dangerous that he's in bad with Putin someone said he wants to be like him whatever he will never never condemn him because of the relationship that they have this didn't just start this started a long time before he was ever elected don't forget this president can I borrow money in the United States from any bank this president is looking at Russia for his new money financial playground he and all of his allies that I have told you or the Kremlin clan I have been involved with Russia when you name them and you think about them why is it man afford Flynn Wilbur Ross Carter Paige popodokolos all of his allies have connections with Russia the Kremlin and the oligarchs this has been going on because this is their new money playground that they want to develop and the centerpiece of this is lifting the sanctions I would wish people would focus on the sanctions I think that's the agreement that Putin had with this president in order to help get elected this president I believe has promised him that once he was elected he would get those sanctions lifted and you're gonna watch he's gonna continue to try because Putin is saying to him when is it going to happen so he has a private meeting with him we know what they talked about I think I know what they talked about they talked about lifting the sanctions they talked about the upcoming elections they talked about all of the things that they could not talk about in an email on the phone he had to go and meet with him in private so that he could talk about what he's going to do to follow through with what I believe is his commitment to get those sanctions lifted don't forget when Tilson was there Tillison was there to help get the sanctions lifted he just couldn't put up with this president he found this president to be so outrageous that he ended up leaving but he came to be a part of helping to get these sanctions lifted it's worth trillions of dollars everybody will make some money if he can get this done right now Putin's hands are tied he cannot get the equipment or the supplies that he needs to do the work because our allies are cooperating with us so I'm not surprised about what happened in Helsinki I'm not surprised about the private meet I'm not surprised about this president standing up for Putin as a matter of fact I think he is Putin's Apprentice he's been under his tutelage for a long time now and he intends to get it done and the American people are sitting idly by and the Republican Party should be ashamed that they're allowing this to happen they have no guts they have no courage they're not standing up for America I dare them to talk about how patriotic they are given or what they allowing this president to do now they're all going to send out press releases saying we don't want you to invite Putin well he's going to invite him unless the Congress of the United States and the Republicans really takes some serious action how many of the Republicans are saying I won't come to the White House I'm going to be outside demonstrating how many of them saying don't invite me to any dinner you better not have a state dinner how many are saying that they're just saying you shouldn't and we don't want you to do it but I want to tell you if they don't take strong action to keep him from bringing him here he's going to bring him here and that will be another's another straw and his hat that he can point to and say see mr. Putin I'm moving this forward what we talked about what we are going to do I'm going to get this done and forget about what he did with North Korea that's just a an effort to say that I'm doing this with both countries and that's just an effort to say that see I'm trying to create peace and relationships in different ways but the fact of the matter is his focus is on Russia and lifting those sanctions and you're going to see him continue to try because he has an agreement that he cannot get out of when people want to know what does Putin have on the president of the United States is this agreement where the president promised he was going to get the sanctions lifted and Putin is gonna hold him to it let me and you know you mentioned Carter Paige congresswoman and here is the the FISA warrant which was released in unprecedented fashion by the FBI we have it this morning and the folks are reading through it what do you think that this the release of this document does to the credibility of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunez well you know first of all they've got to understand that he was put under surveillance because of the actions that he was taken not only they cause suspicion but I think it was deemed that he basically was going to be used to spy he's not considered to be very smart not considered to be a very you know capable of not resisting whether the Russians and so I think that Nunez and all of them are looking very silly I think that they should be ashamed that they would in any way undermine FBI and the FBI's work to try to protect this country from our enemy which this president says he's not our enemy he's just a competitor he keeps going on like that but the fact of the matter is that noonas and any others who have tried to undermine them to say that somehow they were unfair somehow they were using their power to interfere with the life of this man who already had been identified basically as someone who was in the grips of Russia cars and Maxine Waters never want to mince words thank you very much for spending some time with us on this Sunday morning thank you well you certainly welcome keep your eye on the sanctions all right what do we definitely we'll do that thank you very much and coming welcome thank you and Carter page coming up defends himself against allegations that you just heard from the congresswoman that and others including this this five application that he may have been a Russian agent hey thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there for more am joy and the rest of MSNBC and click on any of the videos right here to watch the latest interviews and highlights and you can get more videos from MSNBC for free every day with our newsletters just visit msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up now
