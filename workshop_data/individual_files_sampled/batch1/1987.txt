Sunderland is a place which demonstrates only two clearly all the contradictions of brexit and the mess the UK is currently in this region is one of the poorest parts of Northern Europe unhappy it voted to leave the European Union to try something else takes it he's run this business for nearly half a century selling parts of the region's manufacturing industry cities what's known as a hard brick sitter he shrugs off worries that leaving the European Union might endanger his business he wants the UK out completely and is fed up that the government he supports can't get the job done I won't Peter stand no I won't no police a standoff for England standoff for the wrong people and you said again push around and they're just no they're just the doughnut they're not doing it do you think they're frightened what is it you think I don't see do or law or they see all the right things and then when it comes to doing her to kind out the fallen down they don't know it just up the road nissan employs 7,000 people with tens of thousands more in the supply chain if the UK abandons European trade agreements all those jobs could be at risk steve is the union representative of the workers its position is that if brexit happens it must be a soft one allowing the UK to trade freely with Europe otherwise the Union fears disaster looms it would be absolute devastation and I also think to conclude on that it would take decades to recover also so there's anything to replace those jobs if they were to go this morning time no there isn't the government talks all the time about brexit enabling a global Britain free to trade where it likes this company does that already it makes tanks for water treatment plants and has plans to expand for the company boss brexit as a source of enormous instability and he wishes it would just go away I'm a strong supporter of the UK in general however I think the the unknown is the thing that were frightened of most and I don't think the government doing the best it could to give us the information and communication on the next steps and what's likely to happen on an exit from the EU in microcosm this region tells the story of how a brexit has won the refere but seem not to know what to do with their victory to mend this divided country as things stand there is no constituency in this country which is happy with the way brexit is being conducted not the hardliners who want to leave the European Union completely not the remain us who want to stay in and not those people in the middle happy to accept some sort of in out fudge but the one thing they would all agree on is that there seems to be an almost total lack of political leadership a sense of where on earth the country is going next it's worth recalling that the points of brexit was to allow the UK greater control of its destiny yet as of now nobody has any idea if brexit will happen whether it might improve all the things places like Sunderland lost or whether it will make a bad situation even worse Lawrence Lee al-jazeera Sunderland
