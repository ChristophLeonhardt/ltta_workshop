now why is the left so angry at christina hoff sommers or jordan peterson or Yaron Brook and sargon of akkad why why are they so angry at these people well because all of these people violate the tenets of intersectionality intersectionality is the philosophy it's identity politics it's the philosophy that says your identity as a person is your group identity you're not an individual you are a group identity so you're a black eye you are not a person with individual viewpoints but if you're a black guy your viewpoint should be of left because otherwise you're not truly black if you're a Jewish person you must be of the left because as we all know Jews about Democrat and that means that if you're Jewish and you're not of the Democratic Left then you must not be a good representative of Judaism you must not be a good Jew and therefore we rip away your intersectional identity ok leave the foolishness of this obvious is pretty obvious and pretty astonishing but unfortunately it has infused the entire left it really has infused a large portion of the left identity politics predominating over meaningful discourse over meaningful discourse and it's not just these idiotic students these Antipa members attempting to shut down debate on college campuses the most obvious example happened actually last night so my good friend Bethany Mandel who used to write over at commentary magazine she writes for the Federalists on occasion and Bethany does a podcast as well so Bethany had one of the worst childhood experiences ever right so Bethany grew up dirt poor in a trailer park she heard her mom died she had to pull the plug on her mom when she was 16 her dad committed suicide when he was when she was 19 her dad was a drug addict apparently and all of this is to say that Bethany's life story is not exactly a bed of roses she converted to Judaism she married my friend Seth they have a bunch of kids really wonderful people she wrote a piece for the New York Times over the weekend I mean came out Monday in which she talked about her experiences and why she owns a gun and the reason she says she owns a gun is because when she was growing up she was living with her mom her dad had already taken off and somebody legitimately they were living I guess an apartment on the second storey some robber putting a ladder to her window and attempted to climb it in her window I when she was a kid and her mom walked in with a gun that she had with a with a rifle that she had and pointed it at the window said to Bethany move aside or you're gonna get brains honey basically and when the guy showed up at the top of the window she said to him you better run or I'm gonna shoot you and that was the end of that and so Bethany said as I got a lot of Bethany got a lot of death threats in the last election cycle she was not Pro Trump and so she bought a gun in the aftermath of that well Shannon Watts is a is a gun control warrior Shannon watts is a radical gun control advocate and and she decided to attack Bethany for being white she said that Bethany suffered from white privilege so do we have some of those tweets this is 14 so Shannon watts attacked Bethany Mandel and and what she said was this New York Times paired this op-ed by a white woman based on her anecdotes for fear and paranoia instead of actual gun safety data with a photo of a woman of color how dare the New York Times suggests that women of color and women who are white might have common interests when it comes to having a gun we never mind that there's an actual picture of a woman shopping for a gun right there who's a woman of color apparently according to Shannon Watts that person doesn't exist but then she says that Beth alt Bethany is a white woman full of fear and paranoia not that she had a personal experience is somebody trying to break into her house or not that she received death threats Bethany is just a typical white woman and if she really were not white and she would understand the threat that guns pose and then it gets even worse right she actually tweeted out a bunch of nastiness about Bethany she suggested that Bethany was actually a racist right Shannon Watts actually suggested that Bethany was a racist from wanting to protect herself from neo-nazis which is just all class and again all this comes down to is that intersectional politics
