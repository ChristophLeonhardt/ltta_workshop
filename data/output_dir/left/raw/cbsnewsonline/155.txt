>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,522
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF 

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,823
FACTS PUT OUT THERE, BUT 

10
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,526
HOPEFULLY WE CAN CLARIFY SOME 

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:26,893
THINGS TODAY. 

12
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,027
I JUST WANTED TO START BY 

13
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,462
THANKING THE SHERIFFS OF THE 

14
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:29,829
UNITED STATES. 

15
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,930
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEAKING 

16
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,700

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,301

00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:37,904
PARTNERSHIP AT DHS AND ALL THEY 

21
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,305

22
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,206
SO I THANK THEM. 

23
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,342
SO I WANT TO PROVIDE YOU AN 

24
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,309
UPDATE ON THE ILLEGAL 

25
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,310
IMMIGRATION CRISIS ON OUR 

26
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,716
SOUTHERN BORDER AND THE EFFECTS 

27
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,884
THE EFFORTS THE ADMINISTRATION 

28
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,018
IS TAKING TO STOP THIS CRISIS 

29
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,854
AND STOP THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL 

30
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,455
DRUGS, CONTRABAND AND CRIME 

31
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,756
COMING ACROSS THE BORDER. 

32
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,324
LET'S START WITH A FEW NUMBERS 

33
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:58,657
AND FACTS. 

34
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,826
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS WE 

35
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,162
HAVE SEEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 

36
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:06,232
ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER EXCEED 

37
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,134
50,000 PEOPLE EACH MONTH, 

38
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:08,767
MULTIPLES OVER EACH MONTH LAST 

39
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:09,535
YEAR OF SINCE THIS TIME LAST 

40
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:15,208
YEAR THERE HAS BEEN A325% 

41
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,210
INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN 

42
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,445
CHILDREN AND A 435% INCREASE IN 

43
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:20,679
FAMILY UNITS ENTERING THE 

44
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:21,381
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 

45
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,350
OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS THERE 

46
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,220
HAS BEEN A 1,700% INCREASE IN 

47
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,822
ASYLUM CLAIMS RESULTING IN 

48
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,624
ASYLUM BACKLOG TODAY IN OUR 

49
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,892
COUNTRY OF 600,000 CASES. 

50
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,828
SINCE 2013 THE UNITED STATES 

51
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,530
HAS ADMITTED MORE THAN HALF A 

52
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,932
MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 

53
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,034
MINORS AND FAMILY UNITS FROM 

54
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,235
CENTRAL AMERICA, MOST OF WHOM 

55
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,469
TODAY ARE AT LARGE IN THE 

56
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,237
UNITED STATES. 

57
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,340
AT THE SAME TIME LARGE CRIMINAL 

58
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,610
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS MS-13 

59
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,745
HAVE VIOLATED OUR BORDERS AND 

60
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,579
GAINED A DEADLY FOOTHOLD WITHIN 

61
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,481
THE UNITED STATES. 

62
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,117
THIS ENTIRE CRISIS JUST TO BE 

63
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,752
CLEAR IS NOT NEW. 

64
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,020
IT'S BEEN OCCURRING AND 

65
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,356
EXPANDED OVER MANY DECADES, BUT 

66
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,325
CURRENTLY IT IS THE EXCLUSIVE 

67
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,026
PRODUCT OF LOOPHOLES IN OUR 

68
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,860
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAWS THAT 

69
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,529
PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 

70
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,731
MINORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS FROM 

71
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,466
BEING DETAINED AND REMOVED TO 

72
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,634
THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. 

73
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,636
IN OTHER WORDS, THESE LOOPHOLES 

74
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:22,942
CREATE A FUNCTIONALLY OPEN 

75
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,243
BORDER. 

76
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,110
APPREHENSION WITHOUT DETENTION 

77
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,612
AND REMOVAL IS NOT BORDER 

78
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:25,945
SECURITY. 

79
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,313
WE HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED ON 

80
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,048
CONGRESS TO CLOSE THESE 

81
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:29,348
LOOPHOLES. 

82
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,117
I MYSELF HAVE MET WITH AS MANY 

83
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,252
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO 

84
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,419
MEET WITH ME. 

85
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,487
I TESTIFIED SEVEN TIMES. 

86
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,822
I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE MYSELF 

87
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,123
AVAILABLE TO ASK THEY WORK WITH 

88
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,159
US TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. 

89
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,160
YET THE VOICES MOST LOUDLY 

90
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,894
CRITICIZING THE FORCE. 

91
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,364
OF OUR CURRENT LAWS ARE THOSE 

92
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,665
WHOSE POLICIES CREATED THIS 

93
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,033
CRISIS AND WHOSE POLICIES 

94
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,700
PERPETRATE IT. 

95
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,603
IN PARTICULAR, WE NEED TO 

96
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,738
REFORM THREE MAJOR LOOPHOLES. 

97
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,240
LET ME QUICKLY WALK YOU THROUGH 

98
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,440
THEM. 

99
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,478
FIRST WE NEED TO AMEND THE 2008 

100
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,578
TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PREVENTION 

101
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,047
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OR TVPR 

102
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,317
WHICH IS MUCH EASIER TO SAY. 

103
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,418
THIS LAW ENCOURAGES FAMILIES TO 

104
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,719
PUT CHILDREN IN THE HANDS OF 

105
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,655
SMUGGLERS TO BRING THEM ALONE 

106
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,657
ON THIS DANGEROUS TREK 

107
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,424
NORTHWARD AND MAKE NO MISTAKE. 

108
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:14,460
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. 

109
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,028
THIS TREK IS DANGEROUS AND 

110
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:16,696
DEADLY. 

111
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,932
SECOND, WE NEED TO REFORM OUR 

112
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,467
ASYLUM LAWS TO END THE SYSTEMIC 

113
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,304
ABUSE OF OUR ASYLUM SYSTEM AND 

114
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,305
STOP FRAUD. 

115
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,439
RIGHT NOW OUR ASYLUM SYSTEM 

116
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,575
GAMES TO ASSIST ASYLUM SEEKERS 

117
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:30,409
WHO LEGITIMATELY NEED IT. 

118
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:32,445
WE ARE A COUNTRY OF COMPASSION. 

119
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,380
WE ARE A COUNTRY OF HEART. 

120
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,049
WE MUST FIX THE SYSTEM SO THAT 

121
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,151
THOSE WHO TRULY NEED ASYLUM 

122
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,319
CAN, IN FACT, RECEIVE IT. 

123
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,625
THIRD, WE NEED TO AMEND THE 

124
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,759
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RECENT 

125
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,328
EXPANSIONS WHICH WOULD ALLOW 

126
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,929
FOR FAMILY DETENTION DURING THE 

127
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,130
REMOVAL PROCESS AND WE NEED 

128
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,231
CONGRESS TO FULLY FUND OUR 

129
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,501
ABILITY TO HOLD FAMILIES 

130
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,170
TOGETHER THROUGH THE 

131
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,870
IMMIGRATION PROCESS. 

132
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,704
UNTIL THESE LOOPHOLES ARE 

133
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,139
CLOSED BY CONGRESS IT IS NOT 

134
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,942
POSSIBLE AS A MATTER OF LAW TO 

135
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,444
DETAIN AND REMOVE WHOLE FAMILY 

136
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,645
UNITS WHO ARRIVE ILLEGALLY IN 

137
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,579
THE UNITED STATES. 

138
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,549
CONGRESS AND THE COURTS CREATED 

139
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,884
THIS PROBLEM AND CONGRESS ALONE 

140
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,885
CAN FIX IT. 

141
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,354
UNTIL THEN WE WILL ENFORCE 

142
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,255
EVERY LAW WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS 

143
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,224
TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND 

144
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,059
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. 

145
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:20,927
THOSE WHO CRITICIZE THE 

146
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,863
ENFORCEMENT OF OUR LAWS HAVE 

147
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,798
OFFERED ONLY ONE 

148
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,333
COUNTERMEASURE, OPEN BORDERS. 

149
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,634
THE QUICK RELEASE OF ALL 

150
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:29,936
ILLEGAL ALIEN FAMILIES AND THE 

151
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,738
DECISION NOT TO ENFORCE OUR 

152
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:32,938
LAWS. 

153
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:36,342
THIS POLICY WOULD BE 

154
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:36,642
DISASTROUS. 

155
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:37,543
ITS PRIME BENEFICIARIES WOULD 

156
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,945
BE THE SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS 

157
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,246
THEMSELVES AND THE PRIME 

158
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,047
VICTIMS WOULD BE THE CHILDREN 

159
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,350
WHO WOULD BE PLUNGED INTO THE 

160
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,252
SMUGGLING MACHINES AND GET GANG 

161
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,887
RECRUITMENT ON THE TRIP NORTH. 

162
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,655
THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION 

163
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,458
ABOUT WHAT D HS IS AND IS NOT 

164
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,327
DOING AS IT RELATES TO FAMILIES 

165
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,762
AT THE BORDER AND I WANT TO 

166
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,695
CORRECT THE RECORD. 

167
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:57,963
HERE ARE THE FACTS. 

168
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:58,664
FIRST THIS ADMINISTRATION DID 

169
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:00,032
NOT CREATE A POLICY OF 

170
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,668
SEPARATING FAMILIES AT THE 

171
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:02,901
BORDER. 

172
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:03,836
WE HAVE A STATUTORY 

173
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,238
RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE TAKE 

174
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,440
SERIOUSLY TO PROTECT ALIEN 

175
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,642
CHILDREN FROM HUMAN SMUGGLING, 

176
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,044
TRAFFICKING AND OTHER CRIMINAL 

177
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,780
ACTIONS WHILE ENFORCING OUR 

178
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,180
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 

179
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,351
WE HAVE A LONG EXISTING POLICY, 

180
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,452
MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE 

181
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,953
FOLLOWED THAT OUTLINE WHEN WE 

182
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,955
MAY TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT 

183
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:23,356
CHILDREN. 

184
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,123
WE WILL SEPARATE THOSE WHO 

185
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,759
CLAIM TO BE A PARENT AND CHILD 

186
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,263
IF WE CANNOT DETERMINE A 

187
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,230
FAMILIAR OR CUSTODIAL 

188
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,864
RELATIONSHIP EXISTS. 

189
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,833
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE'S NO 

190
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,802
DOCUMENTATION TO CONFIRM THE 

191
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,435
CLAIMED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN 

192
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,403
ADULT AND A CHILD. 

193
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,639
WE DO SO IF THE PARENT IS A 

194
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,441
NATIONAL SECURITY, PUBLIC OR 

195
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,642
SAFETY RISK INCLUDING WHEN 

196
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,743
THERE ARE CRIMINAL CHARGES AT 

197
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,545
ISSUE AND IT MAY NOT BE 

198
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,879
APPROPRIATE TO MAINTAIN THE 

199
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,413
FAMILY IN DETENTION TOGETHER. 

200
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,683
WE ALSO SEPARATE A PARENT AND 

201
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,718
CHILD IF THE ADULT IS SUSPECTED 

202
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,886
OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. 

203
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,887
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE 

204
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,089
MINORS HAVE BEEN USED AND 

205
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,460
TRAFFICKED BY UNRELATED ADULTS 

206
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,293
IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID DETENTION 

207
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:02,995
AND I STOP HERE TO SAY IN THE 

208
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,699
LAST FIVE MONTHS WE HAVE A 314% 

209
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,701
INCREASE IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN 

210
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,070
ARRIVING AT THE BORDER 

211
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,272
FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING TO BE A 

212
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,273
FAMILY UNIT. 

213
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,575
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OF CONCERN. 

214
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,611
SEPARATION CAN OCCUR WHEN THE 

215
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,413
PARENT IS CHARGED WITH HUMAN 

216
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:20,713
SMUGGLING. 

217
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,480
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE 

218
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,283
úW 

219
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,585
APPROPRIATE SECURE DETENTION 

220
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,152
FACILITY SEPARATE FROM THE 

221
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:26,819
CHILD. 

222
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:32,325
WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THAT WE NO 

223
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,526
LONGER EXEMPT ENTIRE CLASSES OF 

224
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,628
PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW. 

225
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,630
EVERYONE IS SUBJECT TO 

226
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:37,963
PROSECUTION. 

227
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,131
WHEN DHS REFERS A CASE AGAINST 

228
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,400
A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN FOR 

229
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,535
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, THE 

230
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,736
PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN WILL 

231
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,906
BE PLACED INTO THE U.S. MARSHAL 

232
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,541
SERVICE CUSTODY FOR PRETRIAL 

233
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,542
DETERMINATION PURSUANT TO AN 

234
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,410
ORDER BY A FEDERAL JUDGE AND 

235
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,912
ANY ACCOMPANIED CHILD WILL BE 

236
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,646
TRANSFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT 

237
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,648
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 

238
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,751
AND WILL BE RECLASSIFIED AS AN 

239
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,119
UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILD. 

240
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:04,257
THAT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 

241
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,126
TVPRA, A LAW THAT WAS PASSED BY 

242
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,494
CONGRESS AND A FOLLOWING COURT 

243
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,328
ORDER, NEITHER WHICH ARE 

244
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,530
ACTIONS THE TRUMP 

245
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,463
ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN. 

246
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,164
LET'S BE CLEAR. 

247
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,599
IF AN AMERICAN WERE TO COMMIT A 

248
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,599
CRIME ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED 

249
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,002
STATES, THEY WOULD GO TO JAIL 

250
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,236
AND THEY WOULD BE SEPARATED 

251
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:17,936
FROM THEIR FAMILY. 

252
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:21,240
THIS IS NOT A CONTROVERSIAL 

253
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,807
IDEA. 

254
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,743
SECOND, CHILDREN IN DHS AND HHS 

255
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,344
CUSTODY ARE BEING WELL TAKEN 

256
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:25,611
CARE OF. 

257
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,113

00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,918
MEALS, MEDICAL CARE AND 

261
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,619
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES TO THESE 

262
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,020
CHILDREN. 

263
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,024
THEY ARE PROVIDED TEMPORARY 

264
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,425
SHELTER AND HHS WORKS HARD TO 

265
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,694
FIND A PARENT, RELATIVE OR 

266
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,429
FOSTER HOME TO CARE FOR THESE 

267
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:43,696
CHILDREN. 

268
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,430
PARENTS CAN STILL COMMUNICATE 

269
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,431
WITH THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH 

270
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,198
PHONE CALLS AND VIDEO 

271
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,233
CONFERENCING. 

272
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,535
AND A PARENT WHO IS RELEASED 

273
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,804
<font color="#00FFFF">ROM CUSTODY CAN BE A SPONSOR </font>

274
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,040
AND ASK HHS TO RELEASE THE 

275
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,841
CHILD BACK INTO THEIR CARE. 

276
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,443
FURTHER, THESE MINORS CAN STILL 

277
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,912
APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND OTHER 

278
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,846
PROTECTIONS UNDER U.S. 

279
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,950
IMMIGRATION LAW IF ELIGIBLE. 

280
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,184
WE TAKE ALLEGATIONS OF 

281
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,185
MISTREATMENT SERIOUSLY AND I 

282
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,021
WANT TO STRESS THIS POINT. 

283
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,090
WE INVESTIGATE, WE HOLD THOSE 

284
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,893
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN AND IF IT 

285
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,260
SHOULD OCCUR. 

286
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,328
WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST 

287
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,897
DETENTION STANDARDS IN THE 

288
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,164
COUNTRY. 

289
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,764
CLAIMING THESE CHILDREN AND 

290
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,901
THEIR PARENTS ARE TREATED 

291
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,703
INHUMANELY IS NOT TRUE AND 

292
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,570
COMPLETELY DISRESPECTS THE HARD 

293
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,172
WORKING MEN AND WOMEN AT THE 

294
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,540
OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. 

295
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,577
THIRD, PARENTS WHO ENTERED 

296
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,679
ILLEGALLY ARE BY DEFINITION 

297
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,181
CRIMINALS. 

298
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,515
ILLEGAL ENTRY IS A CRIME AS 

299
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:38,549
DETERMINED BY CONGRESS. 

300
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,686
BY ENTERING OUR COUNTRY 

301
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,587
ILLEGALLY, OFTEN IN DANGEROUS 

302
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:43,188
CIRCUMSTANCES, ILLEGAL 

303
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,825
IMMIGRANTS HAVE PUT THEIR 

304
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,394
CHILDREN AT RISK. 

305
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,695
FOURTH, CVP AND I.C.E. 

306
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,529
OFFICERS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED 

307
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,799
TO CARE FOR MINORS IN THEIR 

308
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,066
CUSTODY. 

309
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,599
DHS AND HHS TREATS ALL 

310
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,502
INDIVIDUALS IN ITS CUSTODY WITH 

311
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,403
DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND 

312
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:01,607
COMPLIES WITH ALL LAWS AND 

313
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:01,840
POLICY. 

314
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,113
THIS REINFORCES AND REIRRITATE  

315
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,016
RE-- REITERATES THE BEST 

316
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,017
INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN TO 

317
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:12,618
INCLUDE STANDARDS FOR THE 

318
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,919
TRANSPORT AND TREATMENT OF 

319
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,022
MINORS IN DHS AND HHS CUSTODY. 

320
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,492
ADDITIONALLY, ALL U.S. BORDER 

321
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,029
PATROL PERSONNEL ON THE 

322
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,097
SOUTHWEST BORDER ARE BILING 

323
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:29,201
WARM, EVERY LAST ONE OF -- 

324
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,037
BILINGUAL, EVERY LAST ONE OF 

325
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:31,237
THEM. 

326
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,671
THEY ARE TO PROVIDE DETAINEES 

327
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,806
WITH WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION IN 

328
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,308
BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH THAT 

329
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,575
LAYS OUT THE PROCESS AND 

330
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,279
APPROPRIATE PHONE NUMBERS TO 

331
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,613
CONTACT. 

332
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,983
FINALLY, DHS IS NOT SEPARATING 

333
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,084
FAMILIES LEGITIMATELY SEEKING 

334
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,019
ASYLUM AT PORTS OF ENTRY. 

335
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,789
IF AN ADULT ENTERS AT A PORT OF 

336
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,691
ENTRY AND CLAIMS ASYLUM, THEY 

337
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,093
WILL NOT FACE PROSECUTION FOR 

338
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,094
ILLEGAL ENTRY. 

339
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,295
THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME 

340
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,264
BY COMING TO THE PORT OF ENTRY. 

341
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,901
AS I MENTIONED, DHS DOES HAVE 

342
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,702
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 

343
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,470
MINORS AND IN THAT CASE AS WELL 

344
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,771
WE WILL ONLY SEPARATE THE 

345
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,506
FAMILY IF WE CANNOT DETERMINE 

346
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,740
THERE IS A FAMILIAR 

347
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,975
RELATIONSHIP, IF THE CHILD MAY 

348
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,744
BE AT RISK WITH THE PARENT OR 

349
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,012
LEGAL GUARDIAN OR IF THE PARENT 

350
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:20,652
OR LEGAL GUARDIAN IS REFERRED 

351
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,788
FOR PROSECUTION. WE HAVE A DUTY 

352
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,123
TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

353
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,891
HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. 

354
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,194
DHS IS NO LONGER IGNORING THE 

355
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:28,627
LAW. 

356
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,294
WE ARE ENFORCING THE LAWS AS 

357
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:30,729
THEY EXIST ON THE BOOKS. 

358
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:31,997
AS LONG AS ILLEGAL ENTRY 

359
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,599
REMAINS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, DHS 

360
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,801
WILL NOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY. 

361
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,403
DHS WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE 

362
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,271
LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS AS WE 

363
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,174
ARE SWORN TO DO. 

364
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,909
AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY, SURELY 

365
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,711
IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE 

366
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,112
UNRAVELING OF DEMOCRACY WHEN 

367
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:52,718
THE BODY WHO MAKES THE LAWS 

368
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,386
INSTEAD OF CHANGING THEM TELLS 

369
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,122
THE ENFORCEMENT BODY NOT TO 

370
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:56,989
ENFORCE THE LAW. 

371
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,324
I ASK CONGRESS TO ACT THIS WEEK 

372
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,192
SO THAT WE CAN SECURE OUR 

373
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,995
BORDERS AND UPHOLD OUR 

374
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,462
HUMANITARIAN IDEAS. 

375
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,530
THESE TWO MISSIONS SHOULD NOT 

376
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,031
BE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER. 

377
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,634
IF WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES, WE 

378
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,702
CAN ACCOMPLISH BOTH. 

379
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,905
BEFORE I TAKE QUESTIONS, I JUST 

380
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,006
WANT TO ASK IN YOUR REPORTING 

381
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,608
PLEASE CONSIDER THE MEN AND 

382
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,010
WOMEN OF DHS WHO ARE DEDICATED 

383
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,911
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND 

384
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,814
WHO OFTEN PUT THEIR LIVES AT 

385
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,281
RISK. 

386
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,015
LET'S REMEMBER THEIR SACRIFICE 

387
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,283
AND COMMITMENT TO THIS COUNTRY. 

388
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,287
WITH THAT I'LL TAKE SOME 

389
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:28,821
QUESTIONS. 

390
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,021
YES. 

391
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,888
>> Reporter:  SECRETARY, IF YOU 

392
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:31,624
COULD, WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT 

393
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,826
THERE, DHS IS NO LONGER 

394
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,259
IGNORING THE LAW. 

395
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:34,927
YOU'RE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO 

396
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:35,894
CHANGE THE LAW. 

397
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:36,128
>> YES. 

398
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,930
>> Reporter:  THAT IS THE BIG 

399
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,263
MESSAGE HERE. 

400
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:39,131
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE 

401
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,701
DEMOCRATIC SIDE SAY THAT YOU'RE 

402
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,769
USING CHILDREN AS A LEVER TO 

403
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,204
TRY TO GET THEM TO TAKE 

404
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:45,637
LEGISLATIVE ACTION. 

405
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,306
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? 

406
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,507
>> I SAY THAT'S A VERY COWARDLY 

407
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:49,774
RESPONSE. 

408
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:52,711
IT'S CLEARLY WITHIN THEIR  

409
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,346
POWER TO MAKE THE LAWS AND 

410
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,448
CHANGE THE LAWS. 

411
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:55,981
THEY SHOULD DO SO. 

412
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,316
>>Reporter:  HAVE YOU SEEN THE 

413
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,184
PHOTOS OF CHILDREN IN CAGES? 

414
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:04,490
HAVE YOU HEARD THE AUDIO CLIP 

415
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,157
OF THESE CHILDREN WAILING THAT 

416
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:05,857
JUST CAME OUT TODAY? 

417
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:06,925
>> I HAVE NOT SEEN SOMETHING 

418
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,495
THAT CAME OUT TODAY, BUT I HAVE 

419
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,729
BEEN TO DETENTION CENTERS AND 

420
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,031
AGAIN I WOULD REFERENCE YOU TO 

421
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,499
OUR STANDARDS AND THE CARE 

422
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,166
PROVIDED NOT JUST BY THE 

423
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,000
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

424
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,235
BUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 

425
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,837
AND HUMAN SERVICES WHEN THEY 

426
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,137
GET TO HHS. 

427
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,738
>> Reporter:  IS THAT THE IMAGE 

428
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,407
OF THIS COUNTRY THAT YOU WANT 

429
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,374
OUT THERE, CHILDREN -- 

430
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,843
>> THE IMAGE THAT I WANT OF 

431
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,910
THIS COUNTRY IS AN IMMIGRATION 

432
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,112
SYSTEM THAT SECURES OUR BORDERS 

433
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,847
AND UPHOLDS OUR HUMANITARIAN 

434
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:29,081
IDEALS. 

435
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,916
CONGRESS NEEDS TO FIX IT. 

436
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,016
YES. 

437
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,320
>> Reporter:  I'D LIKE TO GIVE 

438
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,421
YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO 

439
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,389
LAURA BUSH IN AN OP ED. 

440
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,757
SHE SAID THIS IS CRUEL. 

441
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,925
SHE SUPPORTS AN APPLICATION OF 

442
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,428
THE LAW EVEN THOUGH THE FIRST 

443
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,629
FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP HAS 

444
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,331
SAID WE SHOULD BE A NATION OF 

445
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:45,531
LAWS. 

446
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,865
WE SHOULD DO SO WITH HEART. 

447
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,267
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT 

448
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,034
TO TELL THEM? 

449
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,168
DO YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE 

450
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:50,835
MISUNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION 

451
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,371
OR DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S ANY 

452
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,939
COMPONENT OF THIS POLICY WHICH 

453
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,441
AS YOU'VE OUTLINED OTHER 

454
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,308
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE DONE, BUT 

455
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,211
YOU'RE USING IN A WAY THAT IS 

456
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,346
MORE INTENSE AND CREATES THE 

457
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,749
SEPARATION ISSUE? 

458
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,719
>> WHAT MY RESPONSE WOULD BE IS 

459
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,753
CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS 

460
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,687
MATTER IS IMPORTANT. 

461
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,724
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE 

462
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,859
THAT HAS RESULTED AFTER YEARS 

463
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,228
AND YEARS OF CONGRESS NOT 

464
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,462
TAKING ACTION. 

465
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,131
SO I WOULD THANK THEM BOTH FOR 

466
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,799
THEIR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. 

467
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,567
I SHARE THEIR CONCERNS, BUT 

468
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,236
CONGRESS IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS 

469
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:24,737
TO FIX THIS. 

470
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,005
>> Reporter:  THE POLICY IS NOT 

471
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,806
BY YOUR DEFINITION IN ANY WAY 

472
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,574
CRUEL? 

473
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,243
>> IT'S NOT A POLICY. 

474
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,445
OUR POLICY AT DHS IS TO DO WHAT 

475
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,448
WE'RE SWORN TO DO, WHICH IS TO 

476
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,883
ENFORCE THE LAW. 

477
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:37,983
YES. 

478
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,620
>> Reporter:  FOLLOWING UP ON 

479
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,422
MAJOR'S QUESTION THERE FORMER 

480
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:49,628
FIRST LADY MAJOR BUSH COMPARED 

481
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,062
THIS TO JAPANESE INTERMENT 

482
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:52,397
DURING WORLD WAR II. 

483
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,233
DO YOU BELIEVE THE EFFECT OF 

484
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,834
THE LAW OF SEPARATING CHILDREN 

485
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,203
FROM FAMILIES IS MORAL, IS 

486
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:58,703
ETHICAL, IS AMERICAN? 

487
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,406
>> WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT WE 

488
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,507
SHOULD EXERCISE OUR DEMOCRATIC 

489
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,508
RIGHTS AS AMERICANS AND FIX THE 

490
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:04,043
PROBLEM. 

491
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:04,609
IT'S A PROBLEM. 

492
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:05,711
LET'S FIX IT. 

493
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:05,811
YES. 

494
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,248
>> Reporter:  HOW IS THIS NOT 

495
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:09,581
CHILD ABUSE? 

496
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:12,051
>> BE MORE SPECIFIC, PLEASE, 

497
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:12,551
ENFORCING THE LAW? 

498
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,253
>> Reporter:  THE IMAGES 

499
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:16,822
CECILIA WAS TALKING ABOUT AND 

500
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,958
THE SOUNDS WE'VE SEEN FROM 

501
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,726
THESE BIG BOX STORES. 

502
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,327
WHEN YOU SEE THIS, HOW IS THIS 

503
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,028
NOT SPECIFICALLY CHILD ABUSE 

504
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,130
FOR THESE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO 

505
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,232
ARE INDEED BEING SEPARATED FROM 

506
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:27,699
THEIR PARENTS? 

507
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,435
>> SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON A 

508
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,969
COUPLE OTHER THINGS. 

509
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,905
THE VAST MAJORITY, VAST, VAST 

510
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,640
MAJORITY OF CHILDREN WHO ARE IN 

511
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,644
THE CARE OF HHS RIGHT NOW, 

512
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,446
10,000 OF THE 12,000, WERE SENT 

513
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,514
HERE ALONE BY THEIR PARENTS. 

514
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,151
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE 

515
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:46,451
SEPARATED. 

516
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,453
SO SOMEHOW WE'VE CONFLATED 

517
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,421
EVERYTHING, BUT THERE'S TWO 

518
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:49,821
SEPARATE ISSUES. 

519
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,056
10,000 OF THOSE CURRENTLY IN 

520
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,659
CUSTODY WERE SENT BY THEIR 

521
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,462
PARENTS WITH STRANGERS TO 

522
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,229
UNDERTAKE A COMPLETELY 

523
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,431
DANGEROUS AND DEADLY TRAVEL 

524
00:14:59,431 --> 00:14:59,664
ALONE. 

525
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:00,933
WE NOW CARE FOR THEM. 

526
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,034
WE HAVE HIGH STANDARDS. 

527
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,435
WE GIVE THEM MEALS. 

528
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,736
WE GIVE THEM EDUCATION. 

529
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,471
WE GIVE THEM MEDICAL CARE. 

530
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,173
THERE IS VIDEOS. 

531
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:08,507
THERE'S TVs. 

532
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,542
I VISITED THE DETENTION CENTERS 

533
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:10,775
MYSELF. 

534
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,744
THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER TO THAT 

535
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:13,044
QUESTION. 

536
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:13,244
YES. 

537
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,646
>> Reporter:  IF I COULD FOLLOW 

538
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:16,048
UP, FOR THE HUNDREDS NOT 

539
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,649
INCLUDED, YOU SAID 10,000, BUT 

540
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,151
FOR THE HUNDREDS WE HAVE SEEN, 

541
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,754
PERHAPS UP TO 2,000, ARE THERE 

542
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,055
ANY EXAMPLES OF CHILD ABUSE YOU 

543
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,356
BELIEVE AND HOW COULD THIS NOT 

544
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,457
BE CHILD ABUSE FOR THE PEOPLE 

545
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,559
WHO ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR 

546
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,561
PARENTS, NOT THE ONES WHO ARE 

547
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,196
SENT HERE WITH THEIR PARENTS' 

548
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,765
BLESSING WITH THE SMUGGLER, THE 

549
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,966
PEOPLE TAKEN FROM THEIR 

550
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:34,233
PARENTS? 

551
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,035
>> UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT IN ANY 

552
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:40,605
POSITION TO DEAL WITH HEARSAY 

553
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:40,872
STORIES. 

554
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,441
IF SOMEONE HAS A SPECIFIC 

555
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,844
ALLEGATION, AS I ALWAYS DO WHEN 

556
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,446
I TESTIFY, I ASK THEY PROVIDE 

557
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:47,979
THAT INFORMATION TO THE 

558
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:48,747

SECURITY. 

560
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:49,814
WE WILL LOOK INTO IT. 

561
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,550
OF COURSE, WE DO NOT WANT ANY 

562
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,052
SITUATION WHERE A CHILD IS NOT 

563
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,586
COMPLETELY ADEQUATELY TAKEN 

564
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:54,987
CARE OF. 

565
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,187
YES. 

566
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,155
>> Reporter:  A COUPLE 

567
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,556
QUESTIONS OF ONE, WHY IS THE 

568
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,757
GOVERNMENT ONLY RELEASING 

569
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,359
IMAGES OF THE BOYS WHO ARE 

570
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:00,659
BEING HELD? 

571
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,360
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS? 

572
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,295
WHERE ARE THE YOUNG TODDLERS? 

573
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:05,564
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

574
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,865
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE 

575
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:07,298
PARTICULAR IMAGES. 

576
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,567
>> Reporter:  DO YOU KNOW WHERE 

577
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,535
THE GIRLS ARE? 

578
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,770
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE YOUNG úTO 

579
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,772
>> WE HAVE CHILDREN IN DHS CARE 

580
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,441
BOTH, BUT AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF 

581
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,609
THE CHILDREN AFTER 72 HOURS ARE 

582
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,443
TRANSFERRED TO HHS. 

583
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:21,046
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT PICTURES 

584
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,947
YOU'RE REFERENCING, BUT I'D 

585
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,782
HAVE TO REFER YOU TO HHS. 

586
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,850
>> Reporter:  WE'VE SEEN THE 

587
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,652
BOYS, BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY 

588
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,654
OF THE GIRLS AND YOUNG TODDLERS 

589
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,122
AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE WELL 

590
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:30,556
CARED FOR. 

591
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,857
HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT CLAIM IF 

592
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,492
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? 

593
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,760
>> IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T KNOW 

594
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,761
WHERE THEY ARE. 

595
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,664
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ú 

596
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:38,997
SERVICES. 

597
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,766
WE TRANSFER THEM AFTER 72 

598
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,133
HOURS. 

599
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,871
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PICTURES 

600
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,371
YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT. 

601
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,372
>> Reporter:  THEY'VE BEEN 

602
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,540
RELEASED ALL OVER. 

603
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,278
>> FROM DHS OR HHS? 

604
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,746
>> Reporter:  SOMETHING YOUR 

605
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:55,781
DEPARTMENT DID AIRED THROUGHOUT 

606
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,648
NATIONAL TELEVISION THROUGHOUT 

607
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,550
THE DAY, THE KIDS HELD IN CAGES 

608
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,552
AND WE'VE ONLY SEEN THE BOYS. 

609
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,454
>> I WILL LOOK INTO THAT. 

610
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,488
I'M NOT AWARE THERE'S ANOTHER 

611
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:03,755
PICTURE. 

612
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:04,756
>> Reporter:  LET ME JUST 

613
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:05,723
FOLLOW UP BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE 

614
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,159
TO INSIST THIS IS SOMETHING 

615
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,327
THAT CONGRESS CAN CHANGE. 

616
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:08,560
>> YES. 

617
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,361
>> Reporter:  THIS IS SOMETHING 

618
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,762
THAT WAS ENACTED AFTER THE 

619
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,865
ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED THE 

620
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,865
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. 

621
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:15,367
THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE HE 

622
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:15,934
ANNOUNCED IT. 

623
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,769
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE. 

624
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,104
THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, THE 

625
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,973
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE BUSH 

626
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,474
ADMINISTRATION ALL SEPARATED 

627
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:24,742
FAMILIES AT THE -- THEY 

628
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:25,175
ABSOLUTELY DID. 

629
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,479
THEIR RATE WAS LESS THAN OURS, 

630
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,880
BUT THEY ABSOLUTELY DID DO 

631
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,982
THIS. 

632
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,618
THIS IS NOT NEW. 

633
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,319
>> Reporter:  THEY SEPARATED 

634
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,554
MINORS, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT 

635
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,889
THAT, BUT SEPARATING KIDS AT 

636
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,890
THIS RATE FROM THEIR PARENTS IS 

637
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,458
SOMETHING NEW AND SPECIFIC TO 

638
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,059
THIS ADMINISTRATION ONCE THE 

639
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,294
ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED ZERO 

640
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:42,694
TOLERANCE POLICY. 

641
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,562
WHY DOESN'T THE PRESIDENT PICK 

642
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,898
UP THE PHONE AND CHANGE THE 

643
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,131
POLICY? 

644
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:46,731
HE SAID HE HATES IT. 

645
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,466
>> I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

646
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,968
IS TRYING TO DO IS FIND A LONG 

647
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:50,569
TERM FIX. 

648
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,671
WHY DON'T WE HAVE CONGRESS 

649
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,973
CHANGE THE LAWS. 

650
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:55,140
NO. 

651
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,875
CONGRESS COULD FIX THIS 

652
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,041
TOMORROW. 

653
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,077
YES. 

654
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,881
I THINK YOU WERE NEXT. 

655
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:03,582
>> Reporter:  PRESIDENT TRUMP 

656
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,083
HAS HAD A LOT TO SAY THE LAST 

657
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,019
FEW DAYS ABOUT IMMIGRATION, BUT 

658
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,686
HE'S OFFERED NO COMPASSION TO 

659
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,588
THE FAMILIES THAT ARE SEPARATED 

660
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:09,988
AT THE BORDER. 

661
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,790
DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS AND WHY 

662
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,592
WON'T HE SIMPLY PAUSE YOUR 

663
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,794
DEPARTMENT'S ENFORCEMENT OF 

664
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,528
THIS ADMINISTRATION POLICY 

665
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,396
UNTIL CONGRESS REACHES THAT 

666
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,765
LONG TERM FIX SO THAT THESE 

667
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,999
FAMILIES CAN BE REUNITED? 

668
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,201
>> HE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO 

669
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,502
WORK WITH CONGRESS SINCE HE'S 

670
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,836
BEEN IN OFFICE. 

671
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,371
HE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE 

672
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,273
WILL ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE 

673
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,009
UNITED STATES AS LONG AS THIS 

674
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:31,677
ADMINISTRATION IS HERE. 

675
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,879
AS PART OF THAT, HE HAS 

676
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,680
CONTINUALLY REACHED OUT TO 

677
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,281
CONGRESS TO FIX THIS AND I 

678
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:36,981
THINK WHAT YOU'VE SEEN HIM DO 

679
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:39,384
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IS THAT, 

680
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,986
IS CONTINUE TO TELL CONGRESS 

681
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,453
PLEASE WORK WITH US. 

682
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:43,621
THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN. 

683
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,290
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT 

684
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,793
FROM THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW ARE 

685
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,395
THE SMUGGLERS, THE TRAFFICKERS, 

686
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,431
THOSE WHO ARE PEDDLING DRUGS 

687
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,098
AND TERRORISTS. 

688
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,434
SO LET'S FIX THE SYSTEM. 

689
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:55,634
YES. 

690
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,501
>> Reporter:  THAT DIDN'T 

691
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:57,736
ANSWER THE QUESTION, MA'AM. 

692
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,870
DOES HE FEEL ANY COMPASSION FOR 

693
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,906
THE FAMILIES THAT ARE BEING 

694
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,206
SEPARATED? 

695
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,708
HE HAS TALKED ABOUT THE PARENTS 

696
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,608
BEING POSSIBLE CRIMINALS. 

697
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,577
HE HAS BLAMED IT ON DEMOCRATS. 

698
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,912
HE'S OFFERED NO WORDS OF 

699
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:07,212
COMPASSION. 

700
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,480
>> I THINK HE HAS SAID IN 

701
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,416
TWEETS THAT HE WOULD LIKE 

702
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,619
CONGRESS TO ACT TO END THE 

703
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,421
UNDERLYING LAWS THAT REQUIRE 

704
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:16,989
THE SEPARATION. 

705
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,189
YES. 

706
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,290
>> Reporter:  MADAM SECRETARY, 

707
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,692
IT SEEMED LIKE A COUPLE DAYS 

708
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:26,298
AGO BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND YOUR 

709
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,299
DEFEATS THE MAIN POSTURE POINT 

710
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,000
WAS TO SAY THIS IS NOT THE 

711
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,902
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY, BUT IT 

712
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,070
SEEMS LIKE TODAY THE MESSAGE IS 

713
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,305
A LITTLE DIFFERENT AS TO SAY 

714
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,806
THIS IS OUR POLICY, BUT IT'S 

715
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,208
OUR POLICY BECAUSE EITHER WE 

716
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,409
BELIEVE IT'S A DETERRENT OR WE 

717
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,510
DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THE 

718
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,679
RESOURCES TO MOVE FAMILIES 

719
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:41,946
ENTIRELY. 

720
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,116
I'M JUST WONDERING, I WANT TO 

721
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,119
MAKE SURE WE GET IT REPORTED 

722
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,352
RIGHT. 

723
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,520
WHICH OF THOSE IS THE MOST 

724
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,022
PRECISE WAY TO DESCRIBE HOW THE 

725
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,423
ADMINISTRATION FEELS AND GIVEN 

726
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,425
THE BLOWBACK BY A NUMBER OF 

727
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:53,992
REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS 

728
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,594
DEMOCRATS ARE YOU CONSIDERING 

729
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,729
RETHINKING THIS BASED ON 

730
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,531
FEEDBACK OR IS THIS THE 

731
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,133
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY GOING 

732
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,434
FORWARD, PERIOD, PARAGRAPH? 

733
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,102
>> THE LAWS PROHIBIT US FROM 

734
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,904
DETAINING FAMILIES WHILE THEY 

735
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,340
GO THROUGH PROSECUTION FOR 

736
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,107
ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE BORDER 

737
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,309
AND WHILE THEY GO THROUGH 

738
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,244
PROSECUTIONS FOR IMMIGRATION 

739
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:12,577
PROCEEDINGS. 

740

925
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:27,959
THIS TIME. 

926
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,793
>> Reporter:  THERE'S A REPORT 

927
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,593
THAT THE UNITED STATES AND 

928
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,997
SOUTH KOREA HAVE AGREED TO 

929
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,099
SUSPEND JOINT MILITARY DRILLS 

930
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:34,665
IN AUGUST. 

931
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:35,533
IS THAT REAL? 

932
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,101
>> I'M SORRY, THE LAST PART OF 

933
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:37,601
THE QUESTION? 

934
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:39,671
>> Reporter:  THAT THEY AGREED 

935
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,140
TO SUSPEND JOINT MILITARY 

936

DRILLS IN AUGUST. 

937
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,009
ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS? 

938
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:48,013
>> THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE 

939
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,347
ONGOING AT THIS POINT. 

940
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,016
AS LONG AS THE NORTH KOREANS 

941
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,318
CONTINUE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH, 

942
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:58,223
AS WE SAW IN SINGAPORE, THEN WE 

943
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,325
EXPECT THOSE THINGS TO BE ON 

944
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:00,558
PAUSE. 

945
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,794
>> Reporter:  SARAH, HAS THE 

946
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,428
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED THE FAMILY 

947
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,529
SEPARATION POLICY WITH THE 

948
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,431
FIRST LADY IN LIGHT OF HER 

949
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,332
STATEMENT YESTERDAY AND DOES HE 

950
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,000
HAVE ANY PLANS TO COME OUT AND 

951
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,301
ADDRESS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 

952
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,170
MAYBE TAKE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT 

953
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,571
HOW HIS ADMINISTRATION'S 

954
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,438
ENFORCING THE POLICY? 

955
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:16,207
>> THE PRESIDENT DID TAKE A 

956
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,308
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS, AS I'M 

957
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:19,811
SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE ON 

958
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,012
FRIDAY, IN WHICH WHAT HE 

959
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,113
ACTUALLY SAID VERY CLOSELY 

960
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,882
MIRRORED WHAT THE FIRST LADY 

961
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,082
SAID. 

962
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,884
HE SAID HE HATES SEEING THIS. 

963
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,218
HE'S CALLED ON CONGRESS, NOT 

964
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,352
JUST FRIDAY, BUT FOR MONTHS 

965
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:30,021
HE'S CALLED ON DEMOCRATS IN 

966
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,456
CONGRESS TO WORK WITH HIM. 

967
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,090
LET'S FIX THIS PROBLEM. 

968
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,025
THE PRESIDENT ISN'T TRYING TO 

969
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,727
KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. 

970
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,728
HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO WORK 

971
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,829
WITH CONGRESS TO GET REAL 

972
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,231
SOLUTIONS AND TO FIX THE 

973
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:40,932
PROBLEM. 

974
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,066
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

975
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,034
JEFF, I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTION 

976
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,936
SINCE YOU AND YOUR NETWORK 

977
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,870
FALSELY ACCUSED ME OF NOT 

978
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,971
WANTING TO BE HERE. 

979
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,339
SO I'LL BE GLAD TO PASS THAT 

980
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:49,274
QUESTION ON TO YOU NOW. 

981
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,241
>> Reporter:  WHY DID YOU 

982
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,444
DECIDE TO HAVE SECRETARY 

983
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,845
NIELSEN ANSWER QUESTIONS 

984
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:54,746
INSTEAD OF YOU? 

985
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,247
>> I'M HERE ANSWERING QUESTIONS 

986
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,818
AS WELL, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 

987
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,020
IMPORTANT FOR THE SECRETARY IN 

988
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,121
ONE OF THE PRIMARY -- AND ONE 

989
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,823
OF THE PRIMARY EXPERTS ON THE 

990
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,224
PROCESS AND THE THINGS GOING ON 

991
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,726
TO COME OUT AND HAVE THE CHANCE 

992
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,027
TO SPEAK TO YOU AND FOR YOU 

993
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,628
GUYS TO BE ABLE TO ASK 

994
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,330
QUESTIONS DIRECTLY OF HER AND 

995
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,231
THE LEADERS IN THIS 

996
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,967
ADMINISTRATION, BUT I'M 

997
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,168
STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU. 

998
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:17,368
JOHN. 

999
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,938
>> Reporter:  I HAVE A REAL 

1000
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,139
QUESTION. 

1001
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,141
WOULD THE PRESIDENT SIGN A BILL 

1002
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,343
THAT DID NOT INCLUDE BORDER 

1003
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,545
FUNDING IF IT DID INDEED CLOSE 

1004
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,580
THIS LOOPHOLE THAT SECRETARY 

1005
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
NIELSEN TALKED ABOUT? 

1006
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,616
WOULD HE SIGN THAT SPECIFIC 

1007
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,752
BILL OR DOES HE REQUIRE AN 

1008
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,955
ENTIRE BILL WITH THAT $25 

1009
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:37,222
BILLION? 

1010
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,456
>> WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT WHAT WE 

1011
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,625
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON A NUMBER 

1012
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,960
OF DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, THERE 

1013
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,961
ARE CURRENTLY TWO BILLS THAT 

1014
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,495
ARE IN PROCESS IN THE HOUSE. 

1015
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,431
THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTS BOTH OF 

1016
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,266
THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION 

1017
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,568
THAT WE HAVE VOICED SUPPORT FOR 

1018
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,369
THE DETAILS IN THOSE. 

1019
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,904
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T JUST WANT 

1020
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,641
TO SEE A BAND AID PUT ON THIS. 

1021
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,677
HE WANTS US TO ACTUALLY FIX OUR 

1022
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,110
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. 

1023
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,613
HE'S TIRED OF ADMINISTRATIONS 

1024
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,847
CLAIMING THEY WANT TO HELP THE 

1025
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,782
SYSTEM AND KICKING THE CAN DOWN 

1026
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:05,049
THE ROAD. 

1027
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,451
ISM WANTS TO ACTUALLY FIX THE 

1028
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,352
PROBLEMS -- HE WANTS TO 

1029
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,454
ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEMS AND 

1030
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,054
SECURE OUR BORDER. 

1031
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:14,659
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WE CAN 

1032
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:14,992
TINKER WITH. 

1033
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:16,461
WE'VE LAID OUT WHAT WE WANT TO 

1034
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,361
SEE IN LEGISLATION. 

1035
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:18,663
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO FIX THE 

1036
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:18,963
SYSTEM. 

1037
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,164
WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. 

1038
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:22,167
WE HOPE CONGRESS WILL DO THEIR 

1039
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:22,400
PARTS. 

1040
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,802
DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT TO STOP 

1041
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,736
PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES AND 

1042
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,004
ACTUALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND 

1043
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,738
GET REAL ABOUT SOLVING THE 

1044
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:28,005
PROBLEM. 

1045
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:28,205
JOHN. 

1046
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,340
>> Reporter:  ON THE IG REPORT 

1047
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,508
AND THE HEARINGS IN CONGRESS 

1048
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:34,245
WITH MR. HOROWITZ AND DIRECTOR 

1049
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,046
WRAY, THE PRESIDENT TWEETED 

1050
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,047
SEVERAL TIMES TODAY AND 

1051
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,381
YESTERDAY THAT THE MUELLER 

1052
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,284
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES TO BE A 

1053
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,253
"WITCH HUNT," AND HE SAID 

1054
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,454
FRIDAY AFTER REVIEWING THE IG 

1055
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:45,390
REPORT IT SHOWS THERE IS NO 

1056
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,890
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. 

1057
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,159
HIS OWN FBI DIRECTOR TODAY SAID 

1058
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,194
THAT MUELLER IS NOT ON A WITCH 

1059
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:51,462
HUNT AND THAT THE REPORT 

1060
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:52,730
DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIAL 

1061
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,565
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. 

1062
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,767
HOW IS THERE THAT DISCONNECT 

1063
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,269
THERE BETWEEN WHAT THE 

1064
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:58,937
PRESIDENT BELIEVES ANOTHER 

1065
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,972
BRANCH OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IS 

1066
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:01,205
DOING? 

1067
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,473
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

1068
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:02,706
CLEAR. 

1069
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:04,242
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY INVOLVED 

1070
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,777
IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND HE'S LAID 

1071
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,345
OUT A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT 

1072
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,946
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AND HE 

1073
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:13,184
STRONGLY FEELS THIS IS A WIND  

1074
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:13,951
-- WHICH HUNT. 

1075
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:16,688
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID THE IG 

1076
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,256
REPORT CLEARLY CALLS INTO 

1077
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,757
QUESTION THE CREDIBILITY OF 

1078
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:24,963
JAMES COMEY AND OTHER SENIOR 

1079
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,097
FBI INVESTIGATORS INVOLVED IN 

1080
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:26,530
THE INVESTIGATION. 

1081
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,098
>>> THE GOVERNOR OF 

1082
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,433
MASSACHUSETTS WHO IS A 

1083
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,267
REPUBLICAN TODAY REVERSED 

1084
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,135
COURSE AND ORDERED THE NATIONAL 

1085
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:32,537
GUARD NOT TO SEND ASSETS OR 

1086
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,506
PERSONNEL TO THE SOUTHWEST 

1087
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,075
BORDER BECAUSE HE SAID ACTIONS 

1088
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,276
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE 

1089
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,677
RESULTING IN THE INHUMANE 

1090
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,678
TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. 

1091
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,780
WOULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT AND 

1092
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,849
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OTHER IMPACT 

1093
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,985
ON BORDER OPERATIONS FROM THIS 

1094
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:47,385
WHOLE SITUATION? 

1095
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,953
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIS COMMENT 

1096
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,088
SPECIFICALLY, BUT I WOULD TELL 

1097
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,990
HIM THAT HE SHOULD CALL EVERY 

1098
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,457
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, 

1099
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,691
PARTICULARLY THOSE IN HIS OWN 

1100
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,860
STATE, AND ASK THEM TO FIX THE 

1101
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,060
LAWS. 

1102
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,395
THERE'S ONLY ONE BODY HERE THAT 

1103
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,397
GETS TO CREATE LEGISLATION AND 

1104
00:29:59,397 --> 00:29:59,764
IT'S CONGRESS. 

1105
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,666
OUR JOB IS TO ENFORCE IT AND WE 

1106
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,268
WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONGRESS FIX 

1107
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:03,434
IT. 

1108
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,869
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

1109
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,837
REPEATEDLY CALLED ON THEM TO 

1110
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,206
WORK WITH HIM TO DO JUST THAT. 

1111
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:08,439
DEBRA? 

1112
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,974
>> Reporter:  WHAT WAS THE 

1113
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,876
PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO LAURA 

1114
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,577
BUSH'S PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON 

1115
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:13,978
POST? 

1116
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,345
>> I'M SORRY? 

1117
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,713
WHAT WAS THE LAST PART OF YOUR 

1118
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:15,980
QUESTION? 

1119
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,981
>> Reporter:  WHAT WAS THE 

1120
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,282
PRESIDENT'S REACTION TO LAURA 

1121
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:19,984
BUSH'S PIECE IN THE WASHINGTON 

1122
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,184
POST? 

1123
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:21,286
>> I DIDN'T SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH 

1124
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,887
HIM ABOUT THAT, BUT I'M HAPPY 

1125
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,590
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND 

1126
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,091
ECHO WHAT SECRETARY NIELSEN 

1127
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:27,291
SAID. 

1128
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,726
LOOK, WE SHERYL THE CONCERN. 

1129
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,094
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID -- 

1130
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,028
SHARE THE CONCERN. 

1131
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,196
THE PRESIDET HIMSELF SAID THAT 

1132
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:33,965
HE DOESN'T LIKE THIS PROCESS, 

1133
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,600
BUT ONCE AGAIN IT'S CONGRESS' 

1134
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,968
JOB TO CHANGE THE LAW. 

1135
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,403
WE'RE CALLING ON THEM TO DO 

1136
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,737
EXACTLY THAT AND FRANKLY, THIS 

1137
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,873
LAW WAS ACTUALLY SIGNED INTO 

1138
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,474
EFFECT IN 2008 UNDER HER 

1139
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,176
HUSBAND'S LEADERSHIP, NOT UNDER 

1140
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:45,643
THIS ADMINISTRATION. 

1141
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:46,978
WE'RE NOT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE 

1142
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,246
FOR CREATING THIS PROBLEM. 

1143
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,581
WE'VE INHERITED IT, BUT WE'RE 

1144
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:51,582
ACTUALLY THE FIRST 

1145
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:52,249
ADMINISTRATION STEPPING UP AND 

1146
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,518
TRYING TO FIX IT. 

1147
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:53,718
JOHN. 

1148
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,820
>> Reporter:  THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1149
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,156
I HAVE HERE IN MY HANDS FIGURES 

1150
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,493
FROM THE GERMAN MINISTRY OF THE 

1151
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,131
INTERIOR UNDER MINISTER 

1152
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,766
SEEHOFER WHICH SAYS CRIME HAS 

1153
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,434
GONE DOWN 5.1% IN GERMANY. 

1154
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:11,903
IN FACT, IT'S THE LOWEST REPORT 

1155
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,072
IN A QUARTER CENTURY IN 

1156
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,006
GERMANY. 

1157
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:19,911
VIOLENT CRIME IS DOWN 2.4%, 

1158
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,481
BURGLARY DOWN 23% AND THEFT 

1159
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:23,814
DOWN 11.8%. 

1160
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:26,684
WHERE DID THE PRESIDENT GET THE 

1161
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,787
STATEMENT THAT CRIME WAS WAY UP 

1162
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:34,092
IN GERMANY UNDER THE MERKEL 

1163
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:34,525
PLAN FOR REFUGEES? 

1164
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,995
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THE REPORT 

1165
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,964
YOU'RE REFERENCING, BUT I'LL BE 

1166
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,867
HAPPY TO CHECK INTO IT AND 

1167
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:44,335
CIRCLE BACK. 

1168
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:44,535
JOHN. 

1169
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,603
>> Reporter:  I READ THE FIRST 

1170
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,671
LADY'S STATEMENT THAT WAS PUT 

1171
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:52,577
OUT AND SHE SEEMS VERY TROUBLED 

1172
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,778
BY THIS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. 

1173
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,414
IS THERE ANY SORT OF DAYLIGHT 

1174
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,715
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE 

1175
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,550
FIRST LADY ON THIS ISSUE? 

1176
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,419
>> I THINK WE'VE MADE IT 

1177
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,221
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE 

1178
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,722
DAYLIGHT EXISTS BETWEEN 

1179
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,823
DEMOCRATS AND CONGRESS AND 

1180
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,726
THEIR ABILITY TO CHANGE THIS 

1181
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:08,926
LAW. 

1182
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,362
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID THAT 

1183
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:15,099
HE DOESN'T -- HE HATES THESE 

1184
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:15,400
IMAGES. 

1185
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,300
HE HATES THIS PROCESS AND 

1186
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,136
THAT'S WHY HE'S ASKED FOR IT TO 

1187
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:18,436
BE FIXED. 

1188
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,937
I FEEL LIKE WE KEEP IGNORING 

1189
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:21,439
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1190
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,408
ISN'T THE ONE THAT CREATES THE 

1191
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,308
LAW, BUT IT'S CONGRESS' JOB TO 

1192
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,110
CREATE THE LAW AND THE 

1193
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,312
PRESIDENT'S ALREADY LAID OUT 

1194
00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:30,114
AND GLADLY STATED A NUMBER OF 

1195
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,916
TIMES PUBLICLY THAT HE WOULD 

1196
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,017
SIGN LEGISLATION THAT FIXES 

1197
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,452
THESE LOOPHOLES AND FIXES OUR 

1198
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,553
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. 

1199
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,123
I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE 

1200
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,425
BEGGING AND BANGING DOWN THE 

1201
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,592
DOORS OF CONGRESS AND ASKING 

1202
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,028
THEM TO JOIN WITH THE PRESIDENT 

1203
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,297
INSTEAD OF FIGHTING HIM, 

1204
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,131
INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY 

1205
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:47,531
CRITICIZING HIM. 

1206
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:49,333
WHY AREN'T THEY OFFERING 

1207
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:49,967
SOLUTIONS? 

1208
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,103
YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE NANCY 

1209
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,004
PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER WHO 

1210
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,438
COME OUT AND COMPLAIN AND 

1211
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:54,672
ATTACK. 

1212
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:55,840
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO 

1213
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,474
MESSAGE. 

1214
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,341
THEY HAVE NO SOLUTIONS. 

1215
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:58,543
WE'VE LAID OUT A SOLUTION AND 

1216
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,677
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM WORK WITH 

1217
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,879
US TO PUT IT IN PLACE. 

1218
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,847
STEVE. 

1219
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,650
>> Reporter:  ALSO CRITICAL OF 

1220
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,451
THIS PARTICULAR POLICY BESIDES 

1221
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,952
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MENTIONED 

1222
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,454
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE ARE A 

1223
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,756
NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS AND ALSO 

1224
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,925
SOME VERY PROMINENT MEMBERS OF 

1225
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,161
SOME OF THE PRESIDENT'S BASE, 

1226
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:17,661
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. 

1227
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,363
DO YOU KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT 

1228
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:22,533
HAS HEARD FROM THOSE MEMBERS OF 

1229
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,735
HIS BASE, EVANGELICALS IN 

1230
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:25,670
PARTICULAR, HAD DISCUSSIONS 

1231
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,872
WITH THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS 

1232
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:28,305
PARTICULAR POLICY? 

1233
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:29,974
CAN YOU SORT OF FILL US IN ON 

1234
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,142
DISCUSSIONS THE PRESIDENT MAY 

1235
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,476
HAVE HAD IN THAT REGARD? 

1236
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:36,647
>> I THINK ANY EVANGELICAL OR 

1237
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,449
ANY CHURCH, FOR THAT MATTER, 

1238
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,418
THAT FEELS STRONGLY, THEY úSHOU 

1239
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:42,954
HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THESE 

1240
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:43,287
INDIVIDUALS. 

1241
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,455
I THINK THAT'S THEIR CALLING. 

1242
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,356
THAT'S THE MISSION OF THE 

1243
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,657
CHURCH AND THEY SHOULD 

1244
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,458
CERTAINLY FULFILL THAT. 

1245
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,960
IF THEY WANT TO FIX THE 

1246
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,660
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, THEN THEY 

1247
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,962
SHOULD CALL THEIR MEMBERS OF 

1248
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,163
CONGRESS AND ASK THEM TO JOIN 

1249
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,700
WITH US TO DO THAT. 

1250
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:55,933
STEVE.

CONFUSION ABOUT THIS SPACE

FORCE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1254
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,340
ANNOUNCED TODAY. 

1255
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,908
DID HE ACTUALLY SIGN ANYTHING? 

1256
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:06,377
DOES HE BELIEVE THAT THIS CAN 

1257
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,547
BE DONE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF 

1258
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:10,947
CONGRESS? 

1259
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:12,550
THE AIR FORCE APPEARS OPPOSED 

1260
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,849
TO IT. 

1261
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,585

1262
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,853
COMING FROM BESIDES THE 

1263
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:16,152
PRESIDENT? 

1264
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:18,054
>> THE PRESIDENT ASKED THE 

1265

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO START 

1266

OF IT. 

1269
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,493
WE'LL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT 

1270

OF DEFENSE AND THE OTHER 

1271
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:27,398
RELEVANT PARTIES TO PUT IT INTO

1275
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,071
ADMINISTRATION IS, AS IT SAYS, 

1276
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,672
NOT USING THE CHILDREN AS PAWNS 

1277
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,574
IN THIS SITUATION, THEN WHY NOT 

1278
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,043
JUST HAVE CONGRESS PASS 

1279
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,545
LEGISLATION THAT NARROWLY DEALS 

1280
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,212
WITH THIS SEPARATION ISSUE AND 

1281
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,647
SIGN IT AND THEN DEAL WITH THE

THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. 

1288
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:50,987
WE DON'T WANT TO JUST TINKER 

1289
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:51,255
WITH IT. 

1290
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,090
THE PRESIDENT IS TIRED OF 

1291
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,158
WATCHING PEOPLE KICK IT DOWN 

1292
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,359
THE ROAD AND NOT TAKE 

1293
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,460
RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT FIX THE 

1294
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,462
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. 

1295
00:34:58,462 --> 00:34:59,664
>> Reporter:  I GET THE 

1296
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:00,765
FEELING, SARAH, YOU WOULD LIKE 

1297
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,568
TO SEE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS 

1298
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,668
CHANGED ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION 

1299
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:05,769
SYSTEM, BUT WE'RE DEALING  WITH 

1300
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,238
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION RIGHT 

1301
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:07,438
NOW. 

1302
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,873
>> WE'RE DEALING  WITH A NUMBER 

1303
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:09,273
OF SITUATIONS. 

1304
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,374
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. 

1305
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,577
WE HAVE PEOPLE FLOODING OVER 

1306
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:12,910
THE BORDERS. 

1307
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,978
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT WANTS 

1308
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,680
PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY 

1309
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,281
BUT LEGALLY AND THROUGH THE 

1310
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:17,648
RIGHT PROCESS. 

1311
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,716
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING. 

1312
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,551
WE WANT TO SECURE THE BORDER. 

1313
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,452
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 

1314
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,054
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE 

1315
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,155
PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM 

1316
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,356
THEIR FAMILIES DUE TO THE 

1317
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,591
ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT HAVE COME 

1318
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,759
ACROSS THIS BORDER AND MURDERED 

1319
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,761
AND KILLED AMERICAN CITIZENS. 

1320
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,096
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVER THAT 

1321
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:32,396
SEPARATION? 

1322
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,897
WE WANT TO FIX THE WHOLE THING. 

1323
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:35,266
WE DON'T WANT TO JUST TINKER 

1324
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,233
WITH ONE PART OF IT. 

1325
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:37,435
THIS IS A BROKEN SYSTEM AND 

1326
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,469
WE'VE GOT TO QUIT IGNORING IT. 

1327
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:40,638
JUST IGNORING THE RULE DOESN'T 

1328
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,373
FIX IT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS 

1329
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:42,973
ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY 

1330
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:43,940
TRYING TO DO. 

1331
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,078
I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE LAST 

1332
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:47,344
QUESTION. 

1333
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:48,112
>> Reporter:  THE SECRETARY 

1334
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,480
POMPEO CAME OUT TODAY AND HE 

1335
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,385
SAID THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR 

1336
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,353
DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE KOREAN 

1337
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,188
PENINSULA THAT THE UNITED 

1338
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,357

1339
00:35:59,357 --> 00:35:59,957
ARMISTICE AGREEMENT CURRENTLY 

1340
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:00,257
IN PLACE. 

1341
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:00,791
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT THE 

1342
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,559
PRESIDENT DID MAKE THIS 

1343
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,627
COMMITMENT TO KIM JONG UN? 

1344
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:06,096
AND WHAT EXACTLY DOES UPDATING 

1345
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:06,764
THE ARMISTICE MEAN? 

1346
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,000
DOES IT PUT THE FUTURE OF U.S. 

1347
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,968
FORCES ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA 

1348
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,570
IN QUESTION AND JUST ANY MORE 

1349
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,738
INFORMATION YOU COULD UPDATE US 

1350
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,305
ON IN THAT REGARD. 

1351
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:16,674
>> WE'RE FINALIZING THE DETAILS 

1352
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,576
OF WHAT THE PROCESS WOULD LOOK 

1353
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,110
LIKE, CERTAINLY WOULD CONFIRM 

1354
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,878
SECRETARY POMPEO'S COMMENTS AND 

1355
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,480
WOULD REFER YOU TO THE STATE

THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 

1360
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,588
