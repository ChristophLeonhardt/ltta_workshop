00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,604
NOW REPORTING, DAVID MUIR.

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:05,672
>>> GOOD MORNING AND WE'RE 

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,540
COMING ON THE AIR AT THIS HOUR 

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,140
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,742
MEETDING WITH HIS CABINET AT THE

6
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,110
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW OVER THE 

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,278
GROWING CRISIS IN SYRIA.

8
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,679
THE PRESIDENT DISCUSSING HOW TO 

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,014
RESPOND TO THE SUSPECTED 

10
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,315
CHEMICAL ATTACK BLAMED FOR 

11
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:19,252
KILLING DOZENS OF CIVILIANS IN 

12
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,387
DOUMA, NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OF 

13
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:21,821
DEMASCUS.

14
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,123
IT IS BELIEVED THE ATTACK WAS 

15
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:26,358
CARRIED OUT BE THE SYRIAN 

16
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,127
REGIME, AND IN RECENT TWEETS, 

17
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:31,231
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING ASSAD AN

18
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,167
ANIMAL, AND BLAMING PUTIN FOR 

19
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,836
BACKING ASSAD, AND SAYING THERE 

20
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,072
WILL BE A, QUOTE, BIG PRICE.

21
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,906
LET'S GET TO MARTHA RADDATZ LIVE

22
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:41,441
IN WASHINGTON.

23
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,309
THE LAST TIME, ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

24
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,577
WE KNOW IT WAS JUST THREE DAYS 

25
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,345
BEFORE THE U.S. STRUCK AFTER 

26
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,514
FIRST EVIDENCE OF CHEMICAL 

27
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:50,016
WARFARE BACK THEN.

28
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,650
WHAT KIND OF PROOF ARE THEY 

29
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,853
LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW AND WHAT 

30
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:54,787
ACTION COULD COME?

31
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:55,955
>> Reporter: WHAT THEY DID THE 

32
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,958
LAST TIME THEY STRUCK, LAST 

33
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,692
YEAR, THEY HAD SATELLITE IMAGERY

34
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,927
AND THEY KNEW WHAT KIND OF 

35
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:01,861
AIRCRAFT DROPPED THOSE BOMBS 

36
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,530
THAT CONTAINED CHEMICALS.

37
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,497
THIS TIME, THEY WILL LOOK AND 

38
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,032
SEE IF THEY HAVE THE SAME KIND 

39
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,467
OF EVIDENCE.

40
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,901
THEY WILL TRY FOR TISSUE 

41
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,369
SAMPLES.

42
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,704
THEY WILL TRY FOR SOIL SAMPLES, 

43
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,339
BUT THOSE WILL BE VERY, VERY 

44
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:19,178
HARD TO GET BECAUSE THIS IS THE 

45
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:20,813
ASSAD REGIME AND THEY WILL BE 

46
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:21,447
LOOKING OUT FOR THAT, AND THEY 

47
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,982
WILL WANT TO BURY THAT EVIDENCE.

48
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,017
>> RELEASING THAT FLIGHT PATH, 

49
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:25,884
AND LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA AT

50
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:26,251
THE WHITE HOUSE.

51
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,153
THE PRESIDENT CREATING HIS OWN 

52
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:30,689
RED LINE A YEAR AGO, A NEW ONE.

53
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:31,090
>> Reporter: YEAH.

54
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,459
HE SAID HE WAS MOVED, DAVID, BY 

55
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,594
SEEING THOSE HORRIBLE FOE TES IN

56
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:39,932
SYRIA THE LAST TIME AROUND.

57
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:40,566
MOVED DEEPLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL

58
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:45,304
AND BEWE SAW THE TOMAHAWK 

59
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:45,571
MISSILES.

60
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,507
>> LET'S LISTEN.

61
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,507
>> BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

62
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:52,378
IT WAS AN ATROCIOUS ATTACK.

63
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,747
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

64
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,017
YOU DON'T SEE THINGS LIKE THAT 

65
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,419
AS BAD AS THE NEWS AROUND THE 

66
00:01:59,419 --> 00:01:59,686
WORLD.

67
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,088
YOU JUST DON'T SEE THOSE IMAGES.

68
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,190
WE ARE STUDYING THAT SITUATION 

69
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,590
EXTREMELY CLOSELY.

70
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,727
WE ARE MEETING WITH OUR MILITARY

71
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,829
AND EVERYBODY ELSE, AND WE'LL BE

72
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,364
MAKING SOME MAJOR DECISIONS TO 

73
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:19,239
EVERY THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS.

74
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,039
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED.

75
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,076
WHEN A THING LIKE THAT CAN 

76
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,045
HAPPEN, THIS IS ABOUT HUMANITY.

77
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,513
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMANITY, 

78
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,248
AND IT CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO 

79
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,484
HAPPEN.

80
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,686
SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT 

81
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,622
BARBARIC ACT AND STUDYING WHAT'S

82
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,121
GOING ON.

83
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,456
WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE IN 

84
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:37,657
THERE.

85
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,892
AS YOU KNOW, IT HAS BEEN 

86
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:40,192
SURROUNDED.

87
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,761
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET PEOPLE IN 

88
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,329
BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAS IT BEEN 

89
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,700
HIT, IT'S BEEN SURROUNDED.

90
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,335
AND IF THEY ARE INNOCENT, WHY 

91
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,004
AREN'T THEY ALLOWING OTHER 

92
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,605
PEOPLE TO GO AND IMPROVE?

93
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,639
THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY DIDN'T 

94
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,576
MAKE THE ATTACK.

95
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,446
SO IF IT'S RUSSIA, IF IT'S 

96
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,849
SYRIA, IF IT'S IRAN, IF IT'S ALL

97
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,084
OF THEM TOGETHER, WE'LL FIGURE 

98
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,554
IT OUT, AND WE'LL KNOW THE 

99
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:09,087
ANSWERS QUITE SOON.

100
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,691
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT VERY, 

101
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,294
VERY STRONGLY AND VERY 

102
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:14,561
SERIOUSLY.

103
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,929
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PROVIDE AN 

104
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:21,267
UPDATE ON TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.

105
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,770
WE HAVE A SITUATION WITH CHINA 

106
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,237
WHERE WE HAVE AFTER VERY GOOD 

107
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,607
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AND I 

108
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,574
THINK WE'LL MAINTAIN THAT 

109
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,977
RELATIONSHIP.

110
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:31,544
I'M VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH 

111
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,845
PRESIDENT XI.

112
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:33,680
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 

113
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,315
PRESIDENT XI, AND AS YOU KNOW, I

114
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,985
SPENT TWO DAYS IN CHINA.

115
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,653
THE PRESIDENT SPENT TWO DAYS 

116
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,824
WITH US IN MAR-A-LAGO IN 

117
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,426
FLORIDA, AND THEY WERE FOUR 

118
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:46,726
GREAT DAYS.

119
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,530
WITH THAT BEING SAID, CHINA HAS 

120
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,164
BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 

121
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,433
UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS.

122
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,702
REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, SINCE

123
00:03:55,702 --> 00:04:01,140
THE START OF THE WORLD TRADE 

124
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,376
ORGANIZATION, AND THEY HAVE 

125
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,043
REALLY DONE A NUMBER ON THIS 

126
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,612
COUNTRY.

127
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:07,814
AND I DON'T BLAME CHINA.

128
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,816
I BLAME THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR 

129
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,049
COUNTRY.

130
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,784
I BLAME PRESIDENTS.

131
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,721
I BLAME REPRESENTATIVES, I BLAME

132
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,021
NEGOTIATORS.

133
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,154
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO 

134
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,055
WHAT THEY DID.

135
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,192
WE DIDN'T DO IT.

136
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:19,791
THEY DID.

137
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,661
AND IT'S THE MOST LOPSIDED SET 

138
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:28,034
OF TRADE RULES, REGULATIONS THAT

139
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:28,835
ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN.

140
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,603
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE 

141
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,772
MANY OF THE HORRIBLE DEALS.

142
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,540
WE'RE RENEGOTIATING AND WE'LL 

143
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,141
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

144
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,809
WE'RE STRONGLY RENEGOTIATING 

145
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,009
NAFTA.

146
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,278
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN 

147
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:39,912
UNION, THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS 

148
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,315
TRADE BARRIERS.

149
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,017
WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE BAD DEALS 

150
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:45,350
W

151
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,819
WITH EVERYONE.

152
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,089
WE'RE CLOSE TO FINISHING A DEAL 

153
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:50,656
WITH SOUTH KOREA.

154
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:52,858
THAT WAS GOING TO GIVE US 

155
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:53,359
200,000 JOBS.

156
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,361
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

157
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,998
THAT GAVE THEM 200,000 JOBS AND 

158
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,767
WE LOST JOBS.

159
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:02,601
THAT WAS A HORRIBLE DEAL AND 

160
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,770
IT'S BEING RENEGOTIATED.

161
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,603
AND WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LONG 

162
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,072
WAY TO GO.

163
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,974
WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS 

164
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,741
PROGRESS.

165
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,809
WE ARE FAIRLY CLOSE ON NAFTA, 

166
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,846
AND IF WE DON'T MAKE THE RIGHT 

167
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,214
DEAL, WE'LL TERMINATE NAFTA AND 

168
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,515
MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL AFTER THAT.

169
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,884
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A DEAL 

170
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:22,955
ON NAFTA, AND AS I SAID, THE 

171
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,791
NORTH KOREA -- SOUTH KOREA 

172
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,727
SITUATION WHICH COMPLICATES IT.

173
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,563
THE DEAL WE HAVE WITH SOUTH 

174
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,197
KOREA, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE 

175
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:31,664
A VERY FAIR DEAL.

176
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,931
WE WANT A FAIR DEAL AND WE DON'T

177
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,301
HAVE FAIR DEALS.

178
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,937
NORTH KOREA BY THE WAY, AS YOU 

179
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,072
HAVE PROBABLY SEEN, WE HAVE BEEN

180
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:40,706
IN TOUCH WITH NORTH KOREA.

181
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:45,077
WE'LL BE MEETING WITH THEM SOME 

182
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:52,118
TIME IN MAY OR EARLY JUNE, AND I

183
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,852
THINK THERE WILL BE GREAT 

184
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,754
RESPECT PAID BY BOTH PARTIES AND

185
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,089
HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO 

186
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:57,856
MAKE A DEAL ON THE DE-NUKING OF 

187
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:00,993
NORTH KOREA.

188
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,595
THEY HAVE SAID SO.

189
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,597
WE HAVE SAID SO.

190
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,831
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A 

191
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:06,966
RELATIONSHIP THAT'S MUCH 

192
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,835
DIFFERENT THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR 

193
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,836
MANY, MANY YEARS.

194
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,536
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY 

195
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,637
OTHER PRESIDENTS AND THEY 

196
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,272
DECIDED THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

197
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,107
THEY COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT 

198
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,809
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER 

199
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,579
IF IT WERE DONE FIVE YEARS AGO, 

200
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,213
TEN YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO.

201
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,114
A LOT EASIER THAN NOW, BUT WE 

202
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:28,387
HAVE A MEETING THAT IS BEING SET

203
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,388
UP WITH NORTH KOREA, SO THAT 

204
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,158
WILL BE VERY EXCITING, I THINK 

205
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:32,492
FOR THE WORLD.

206
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,259
I THINK IT WILL BE AN EXCITING 

207
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:34,693
THING FOR THE WORLD.

208
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:35,928
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT 

209
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,296
OPIOID TODAY.

210
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:42,602
OPIOID DESTRUCTION AND DRUG 

211
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:42,902
DESTRUCTION.

212
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,469
AS YOU KNOW, WE STRENGTHENED UP 

213
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,771
OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

214
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,474
LAST YEAR, WE HAD RECORD LOW 

215
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,575
NUMBERS AND THEY HAVE GONE UP, 

216
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,077
AND THE ECONOMY, PEOPLE ARE 

217
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,478
TRYING TO COME INTO OUR GOOD 

218
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,348
ECONOMY, BUT WE'RE PUTTING THE 

219
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,015
NATIONAL GUARD AND MILITARY AT 

220
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,050
THE BORDER.

221
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,256
WE'RE

222
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,691
I.C.E. HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB.

223
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,627
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT 

224
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:07,894
SITUATION.

225
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,996
WE NEED A WALL.

226
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,630
WHETHER YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN OR 

227
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,232
DEMOCRAT, WE NEED A WALL.

228
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,900
IT WILL STOP YOUR DRUG FLOW, IT 

229
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,802
WILL NOT THE HELL OUT OF THE 

230
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,570
DRUG FLOW.

231
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,238
IT WILL STOP A LOT OF PEOPLE WE 

232
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,240
DON'T WANT IN THIS COUNTRY FROM 

233
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,542
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.

234
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,077
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE PUTTING THE 

235
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:29,549
MILITARY AND THE NATIONAL GUARD 

236
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,418
AND WE DON'T HAVE STRONG 

237
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:32,651
BORDERS.

238
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,353
WE HAVE STRONG BORDERS NOW AND 

239
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,388
THEY'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER.

240
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,122
WITH THAT, THE CABINET MEETING 

241
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:37,723
WILL BEGIN.

242
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,058
WE'LL BE DISCUSSING A LOT OF 

243
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:41,093
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF WHAT'S 

244
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:41,427
GOING ON.

245
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,362
THE COUNTRY IS DOING VERY WELL.

246
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,464
WE'VE CREATED 3 MILLION JOBS 

247
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,366
SINCE THE ELECTION.

248
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:52,338
WE HAVE 700,000 JOBS IN THE LAST

249
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,674
NUMBER OF MONTHS.

250
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,842
THE NUMBERS ARE STARTING TO COME

251
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:00,746
OUT FROM COMPANIES, 

252
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,079
CORPORATIONS.

253
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,481
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL.

254
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,250
OUR COUNTRY IS ON VERY SOLID 

255
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,483
FOOTING.

256
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,119
WHEN WE DO A DEAL WITH CHINA 

257
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,121
WHICH PROBABLY WE WILL.

258
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,223
IF WE DON'T, THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY

259
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,125
PRETTY HIGH TAXES TO DO BUSINESS

260
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:13,558
WITH OUR COUNTRY.

261
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:14,894
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

262
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,197
BUT IF WE DO A DEAL WITH CHINA, 

263
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,300
IF DURING THE COURSE OF THE 

264
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,035
NEGOTIATION THEY WANT TO HIT THE

265
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,105
FARMERS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT 

266
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,573
HITS ME, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT'S 

267
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,374
NICE.

268
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,677
BUT I TELL YOU OUR FARMERS ARE 

269
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,979
GREAT PATRIOTS.

270
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,681
THESE ARE GREAT PATRIOTS.

271
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,383
THEY UNDERSTAND WE'RE DOING THIS

272
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:37,750
FOR THE COUNTRY.

273
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,150
IN THE END THEY'RE GOING TO BE 

274
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,820
MUCH STRONGER THAN THEY ARE.

275
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,855
DON'T FORGET, FARMERS HAVE BEEN 

276
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,058
TRENDING DOWNWARD OVER AN 8-YEAR

277
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:46,292
PERIOD.

278
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,326
THEIR NUMBERS HAVE TRENDED 

279
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,428
DOWNWARD, IN SOME CASES 

280
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:49,761
SIGNIFICANTLY.

281
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,363
SO BETWEEN NAFTA AND CHINA AND 

282
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,866
ALL OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING, 

283
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,435
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM MUCH 

284
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,337
BETTER THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN.

285
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,906
BUT DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME, 

286
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:03,642
SONNY PERDUE, YOU UNDERSTAND 

287
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:04,377
EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.

288
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,845
THERE WILL BE A LITTLE WORK TO 

289
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,145
BE DONE.

290
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,714
BUT THE FARMERS WILL BE BETTER 

291
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,349
OFF THAN THEY EVER WERE.

292
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,985
WILL TAKE A WHIL WHILE TO GET 

293
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,619
THERE, BUT -- IT COULD BE VERY 

294
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,487
QUICK ACTUALLY.

295
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,690
IT'S NOT NICE WHEN THEY HIT THE 

296
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,924
FARMERS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE 

297
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:19,992
THEY THINK THAT HITS ME.

298
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,694
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE 

299
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,829
DOING VERY WELL ON TRADE AND 

300
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,497
TRADE DEALS.

301
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,631
I THINK DEALS WILL BE MADE.

302
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,333
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 

303
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,734
DEALS WITH A LOT OF COUNTRIES 

304
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,071
THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF US.

305
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,639
WE WILL BE REPORTING BACK TO 

306
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,140
EVERYBODY AND WE'LL START OUR 

307
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,876
CABINET MEETING.

308
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,111
THANK YOU ALL, MEETING THE 

309
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:39,412
PRESS.

310
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,381
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

311
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:42,815
THANK YOU.

312
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,450
>> WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 

313
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,152
DECISION ON ALL OF THAT, IN 

314
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,153
PARTICULAR SYRIA, WE'LL BE 

315
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,855
MAKING THAT DECISION VERY 

316
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,389
QUICKLY.

317
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,391
PROBABLY BY THE END OF TODAY.

318
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:58,164
WE CANNOT ALLOW ATROCITIES LIKE 

319
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:58,664
THAT.

320
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,164
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ].

321
00:09:59,164 --> 00:09:59,965
>> YOU MAY.

322
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:03,102
IF HE DOES, IT'S GOING TO BE 

323
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,837
VERY TOUGH.

324
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,606
>> EVERYBODY IS GOING TO PAY A 

325
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:07,806
PRICE.

326
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:08,841
HE WILL.

327
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,976
EVERYBODY WILL.

328
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:11,577
EXCUSE ME?

329
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,445
>> U.S. MILITARY ACTION, IS IT 

330
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,380
OFF THE TABLE?

331
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,615
>> NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE.

332
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:20,152
NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE.

333
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:20,652
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ].

334
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,887
>> WELL, THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE 

335
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,188
NOT.

336
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,557
BUT TO ME, THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A

337
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:24,757
DOUBT.

338
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,358
THE GENERALS WILL FIGURE IT OUT 

339
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:29,194
PROBABLY OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

340
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:29,628
THANK YOU EVERYBODY.

341
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:34,767
THANK YOU.

342
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,501
THANK YOU.

343
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,535
NO, NOT AT ALL.

344
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,671
THE MARKET IS UP TODAY VERY 

345
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,004
SUBSTANTIALLY.

346
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:39,872
NOT AT ALL.

347
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,140
DON'T FORGET, OUR COUNTRY IS 

348
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,941
GOING TO BE MUCH STRONGER WHEN 

349
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:43,608
THIS IS ALL FINISHED.

350
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,311
SO YOU UNDERSTAND.

351
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,712
THESE TRADE DEALS ARE HORRIBLE.

352
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,580
OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE MUCH 

353
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,317
STRONGER WHEN THIS IS FINISHED.

354
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:51,517
OKAY?

355
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,619
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

356
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,219
THANK YOU.

357
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,154
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE 

358
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,755
HOUSE TALKING ABOUT TRADE, 

359
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,090
TALKING ABOUT BORDERS.

360
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,792
BUT IT WAS SYRIA THAT THE WORLD 

361
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,793
IS WATCHING HIM.

362
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,995
HE TALKED ABOUT THE CHEMICAL 

363
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,962
ATTACK SAYING IT WAS AN 

364
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,131
ATROCIOUS ATTACK, IT WAS 

365
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:05,598
HORRIBLE.

366
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,400
YOU DON'T SEE THESE IMAGES GOING

367
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,702
ON TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT 

368
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,503
HUMANITY.

369
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,037
MOMENTS AGO HE WAS ASKED IF 

370
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,239
MILITARY ACTION WAS OFF THE 

371
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:13,806
TABLE.

372
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,974
HE SAID NOTHING IS OFF THE 

373
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:15,241
TABLE.

374
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,010
OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT ASKING IF 

375
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,012
PUTIN WAS BEHIND IT.

376
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,313
HE SAID HE COULD BE.

377
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,250
IF SO, HE WOULD BE PUN FISHED.

378
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,318
>> HARD TO BELIEVE MARTHA 

379
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,653
RADDATZ WE WERE ON THE AIR AFTER

380
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,954
THE PRESIDENT SAID ON THE STAGE 

381
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,889
IN OHIO WE ARE COMING OUT OF 

382
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,825
SYRIA VERY SOON, LET THE OTHER 

383
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,592
PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF IT NOW.

384
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,561
IT APPEARS THE PRESIDENT BEING 

385
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,429
FORCED INTO REACTING AND TAKING 

386
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,097
CARE OF A SITUATION THAT WE 

387
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,366
WITNESSED IN SYRIA OVER THE 

388
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:40,699
WEEKEND.

389
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,434
HE SAID THE DECISION COULD COME 

390
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,703
AS EARLY AS THE END OF TODAY. 

391
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,506
>> AND DAVID, HE SEEMED TO HAVE 

392
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,275
NO DOUBT IT WAS A CHEMICAL 

393
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:49,608
ATTACK.

394
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,010
HE SAID NO DOUBT TO ME.

395
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,778
NOT MUCH OF A DOUBT AT ALL.

396
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,680
OF COURSE, HE TWEETED OVER THE 

397
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,881
WEEKEND THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A

398
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,183
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

399
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,117
HE SAID HE WILL LEAVE IT TO HIS 

400
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:00,319
GENERALS TO DETERMINE THAT.

401
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,753
OF COURSE, DAVID, WHEN WE WERE 

402
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,121
TALKING A WEEK AGO, HE WAS 

403
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:03,923
TALKING ABOUT PULLING OUT 

404
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,991
BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESS MADE 

405
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,393
AGAINST ISIS.

406
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,961
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT 

407
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,228
SITUATION.

408
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,330
BUT HE IS GETTING SOME CRITICISM

409
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,232
FOR SAYING THAT LAST WEEK.

410
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,533
SAYING THAT POSSIBLY THAT'S WHAT

411
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,601
BROUGHT THIS ON.

412
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,036
>> MARTHA, THANK YOU.

413
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,839
I'M GOING TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR

414
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,009
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON 

415
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:24,810
WATCH THAT.

416
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,113
IF IT'S RUSSIA, IF IT'S SYRIA, 

417
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,415
IRAN, IF THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER ON

418
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:31,082
THIS, WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. 

419
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,551
>> HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT OUT IN A

420
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,285
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME?

421
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,320
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS TO ASSESS 

422
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,055
WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN A 

423
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,157
CHEMICAL ATTACK TAKES THE OPCW, 

424
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:40,025
THE ORGANIZATION FOR THE PRE 

425
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,127
DENGS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

426
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:45,530
THEY NEED TO SEND IN EXPERTS AND

427
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,766
TAKE SAMPLES AND ASSESS IT.

428
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,735
AS MARTHA SAID, THE ATTACK THAT 

429
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,570
TOOK PLACE 12 MONTHS AGO, IT WAS

430
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,505
EASIER TO GET THOSE SAMPLES.

431
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:55,374
YOU GO ACROSS THE BORDER QUICKLY

432
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,943
AND GET IT TESTED.

433
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,610
ULTIMATELY, THAT IS WHAT 

434
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,546
HAPPENED AND THE BLAME WAS LAID 

435
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,781
FARMLY AT THE FOOT OF THE 

436
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,916
PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.

437
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,918
THIS TIME YOU'RE IN AN ENCLAVE 

438
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,687
SURROUNDED BY THE SYRIAN REGIME 

439
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,490
FORCES AND RUSSIANS.

440
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,491
THEY SAID THEY'VE SENT IN A TEAM

441
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,959
OF EXPERTS AND SAID THERE'S NO 

442
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,627
EVIDENCE OF CHEMICAL ATTACK.

443
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,229
WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO MEDIA 

444
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,497
ACTIVISTS ON THE GROUND TELLING 

445
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:24,904
ABC NEWS THAT THAT ISN'T TRUE.

446
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,705
EVEN IF YOU HAD TAKEN SAMPLES, 

447
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:28,406
YOU COULDN'T ASSESS IT AT THAT 

448
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:28,707
POINT.

449
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,876
THE QUESTION REMAINS, IF THE 

450
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,877
PRESIDENT WANTS TO ACT, HE'LL 

451
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,547
HAVE TO DO IT WITHOUT NATIONAL 

452
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:35,881
AUTHORIZATION.

453
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,117
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

454
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,651
>> IAN, AS HE POINTS OUT, U.S. 

455
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,585
INTELLIGENCE LOOKING FOR PROOF 

456
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:41,586
OF A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

457
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,255
THE RUSSIANS A SHORT TIME AGO 

458
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,457
SAYING THEY HAVE BEEN IN AND 

459
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,859
FOUND NO EVIDENCE.

460
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,026
NOT TERRIBLY SURPRISING COMING 

461
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:51,797
FROM THE RUSSIANS AT THIS HOUR.

462
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,431
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING ACTION --

463
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,068
DECISION ON ANY ACTION AFTER THE

464
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,769
VIDEO THAT PLAYED OUT ALL OVER 

465
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,806
THE WORLD COULD COME WITHIN 24 

466
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,807
TO 48 HOURS FROM THE WHITE 

467
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,007
HOUSE.

468
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,710
