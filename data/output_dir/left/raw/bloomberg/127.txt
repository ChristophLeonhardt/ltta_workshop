1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,630
The perfect sports car should combine sexy good looks with nimble steering, aggressive

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,350
power, and a high-quality cabin.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,559
It will be expensive -- but not so pricy that
it’s out of reach for everyone.

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,520
Porsche, Mercedes and Jaguar have three of
the top sports cars on offer today– but

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,340
which one is the best for you?

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,360
Let’s get the numbers out of the way. All
three cars have impressive stats.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,060
the Porsche’s come is just slightly behind the Benz and
Jag, but each is a thrill to drive in its own way.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,360
This is the 2017 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:47,640
The engine in this is 420 horse power six cylinder boxer engine mounted in the rear. This is Porsche's famous engine.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Its difficult to describe the feeling when you get behind the wheel.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
This is where that mystical Porsche X factor comes in.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,720
The rear-wheel drive on 20-inch Carrera S
wheels and Porsche Torque Vectoring grip the

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,440
road better than any other model in our group.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,520
The AMG GT S is faster and more fun to drive
than any other Mercedes – it feels like a rocket ship

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,200
This car has a lot to offer. It has that amazing V8 engine, it has the horse power, it has the torque.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,480
Of course, if you’re not careful, the rear-wheel-drive
AMG will fishtail forward with a mind of its own.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,680
That said, it’s amazing in a straight line.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,920
This is the two-door coupe Jaguar debuted
in 2015 as a way to get back in the game,

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,320
and the company did it with flying colors

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,840
The handling is great, I mean this car is so perfectly balanced. Its really a treat to drive,

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,160
especially on windy roads.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,360
The torque that you feel when you drive it
is the most impressive of the group.

23
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,860
But it’s not as connected to the road as
the 911, nor as smooth as the AMG.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,520
It is tight when it comes to steering and
braking.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,960
The 911 is imminently recognizable, yet after
all these years it still impresses.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,880
The front end is flirtatious, the rear is
muscley, and the headlights are friendly.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,340
This is Mercedes’ bad-boy halo car, meant
to recall the glorious gullwing SL

28
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,700
that Mercedes made in the 1960s.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,800
The idea is that its sexy allure will attract
young new fans to the brand.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,880
This is the car you want to get to make a really loud statement.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,960
The Jag is all muscles and roar, punched up
at the seams like a football player.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,260
If you like kind of a hunky mass of metal
and gears under your foot, this one is the car for you.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,700
Porsche was the first sporting brand to introduce
the PDK paddle-shift technology –

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,080
which is quicker and better for city driving than
the manual.

35
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,780
There is also a back seat in this option,
something the other two don’t have.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,660
Now,  I don't know if you'd put anybody in that back seat except maybe your dog

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,880
Or someone you don't like, but it is back there. You can use it in a pinch.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,640
Inside I loved how the Mercedes looks. It has crazy octopus like round dials all the way

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
Through the center and the dash. And everything felt thick and rich.

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
There is plenty to see inside the Jaguar.

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,200
Lots of loud blue stitching, performance seats,
and even a handle for the front passenger

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,360
to hold on to for dear life.

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,160
This is the least well-done of our three when
it comes to interior quality and design,

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
But its still pretty great.

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,160
The bottom line; You can’t go wrong with
any of these incredible machines.

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,800
But if you want the whole package at the best
value, the 911 is the clear winner.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,440
Sure, it’s not as aggressive-looking as
the AMG, and it has less power than the Jag.

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,349
But its incredible connection to the ground,
its cozy perfect German handling, it's superior

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,920
suspension, and it's minimal but quality interior
mean the 911 Carrera S Cabriolet

50
00:04:02,120 --> 00:00:00,000
more than stands its ground.
