will there be a primary challenger for New York's Governor Cuomo we don't know for sure yet but we are getting some interesting insight into the possibility and this is coming from our two IT politics reporter nahi constitu got to spend a day with bill de blasio of New York City and he had something interesting to say about it let's listen I think there will be a Democratic primary I've always thought to be a Democratic primary and I think it will be spirited because there's a lot of issues that have to be discussed it's early yeah it's early still in the sky I'm just saying I don't think this is over I think inevitably there will be a progressive challenge because of what's going on in the country what's going on the party and what's going on in this state and I think a lot of people want to ask some tough questions and want there to be that debate I believe there will be a debate over the future of the party in the state and I don't think the fact that it's been quiet up to now means that's all there is to it so that wound up being huge news in New York and great work by number yukikaze is actually the first reporter we hired when we did the investigative reporter fundraising powered by our audience and so New York Post has not picked it up talked about it many other outlets have and in fact Andrew Cuomo was asked about Ana press conference and he already had to react to it and he what they asked them now look all of a sudden de Blasio for the first time is saying that you likely will get a primary challenger how do you feel about that and you think that that perhaps the Blasio is behind Cynthia Nixon considering a run she's an actress and a progressive activist and has recently spoken out against Cuomo we'll get to that in a second and Cuomo responded I think it was probably either the mayor of New York or Vladimir Putin and then chuckled according to the New York Times so hmm okay nice little Putin reference there but but look no michi asked we got an answer and pita and de Blasio does not hide the fact that that they that they don't agree and so it appears that he's looking forward to a primary challenger for Cuomo and by the way no me keys whole interview with him is going to be up in a series form on youtube.com slash tyt politics yeah you know a little bit more of it yes okay so they're gonna widen it a little bit about the the state of the party and the sorts of candidates that they might begin nominating in the next go-around the next presidential election you'll see that in this clip I think progressives are ascendant in the Democratic Party I fundamentally believe the Democratic Party will nominate a progressive for president the energy is all with the progressive side of the party the the folks who are running the folks who are volunteering the people who are signing up to vote it's all coming from one place the notion of the party as the amorphous thing that was allowed to be for so long that's dying quickly and I think that's very very healthy but I think everyone is going to be held to that standard so anyone who thinks they can run in 2020 as a moderate or they can avoid definition is sorely mistaken so I think that's relevant for New York he's not just saying that in a vacuum he's saying all the energies on the progressive side wink wink somebody might want to run as a progressive against warm Oh but also very relevant at the national level and I think his assessment of that is exactly right I don't think you know some might say that it's self-serving because he's on the progressive side but I don't think so and I think he has correctly assessed as we're all energies I resilient ardor congressional candidate they actually have a lot of Obama volunteers and a lot of Bernie volunteers and though Obama volunteers won't do anything because they are saying they're gonna wait to see if he has a better chance of winning whereas the Bernie volunteers are already in the streets I like where do we go where do we go what doors are we knocking on who do we call so that's you know how you can improve his chances by doing something I know but that was so what named me when they see things like energy that is part of what they mean by that and it's real people are energized they want to go tell other people about it they want to volunteer their one to grassroots efforts and so and eventually vote those guys are more energized to show up in primaries and in the 2020 elections so I think de Blasio is exactly right there by the way though that portion of the interview in its entirety will be in a link down below on in YouTube in the description box and comment section on Facebook and then the whole series will be on TYT politics but one more video for you guys if you don't remember Cynthia Nixon talking about Cuomo and and why now they're asking about Nixon in in their press conference with Cuomo here's what she had to say about it back then you know I think there are people who would like me to run and I think for a variety of reasons but I think the number one is education and Governor Cuomo likes to say that you know we spend more per pupil than any other state and that is actually true but the only reason that is true is because we spend so much on the kids in our wealthiest districts and so that evens out and not only made parents all across New York State yeah and there she said people have encouraged me to run now based on noemi's partly based on noemi's reporting a speculation going all the way to the governor that de Blasio is one of the people encouraging her they are friends they are allies I don't think that necessarily proves the case but there are a lot of people who would like Andrew Cuomo primary by a progressive so de Blasio is not alone in that if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart
