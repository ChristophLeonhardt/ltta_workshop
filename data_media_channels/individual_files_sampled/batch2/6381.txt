new polls out including Gallup one of the most respected polling organizations out Trump is sinking and he's sinking fast and this was done over the weekend so the full impact of Trump not calling out Nazis for two days is not even in this poll some of it is because it was done like I said on Sunday and Trump had still not called out the the right way not the right wing overall but the white supremacist the Klan the Nazis etc and then today in a press conference he doubled down saying there's very good people on that side and both sides are to blame okay so that's not even in this poll and I told you he's going into the 20s and it's for some groups for he's already in the 20s so this is a appetizer for things to come but right now his approval rating down this is down a 34 percent it's the lowest it's ever been this approvals a 61% the 34 percent is an unmitigated disaster if you don't we've gotten used to Donald Trump being in the 30s a president being in the 30s is terrible that means he is deeply grossly unpopular the only reason he won is because he ran against the only other person who was more unpopular than him in American history of all presidential candidates since we've ever done polling so they that they you mistake or I think a lot of people in media mistake that for so people must like Donald Trump no they don't 34% means only one third of the country two-thirds is either slightly undecided or totally against them so Trump's approval rating among Republicans even slipping 79% still ridiculously high but slipping it used to be in the 90s now hit most importantly approval rating among independents there is in the 20s 29% and it's never gonna get better he's gonna bottom out he's gonna go to mid 20s for the whole country and for independence he can go down to the low 20s maybe even the teens it it's he's already in a world of trouble now even among Republicans for the ones that are holding they're not holding that strongly so percentage of Republicans who this is a different poll by the way now go to the USA Today percentage of Republicans who strongly approve his approval rating in that polls 83% that's healthy among Republicans among Republicans but even in that poll percentage of Republicans who strongly approve had dropped by double digits to 59 percent from 73 percent in February you can still say oh my god Republicans 59% of Republicans still strongly approve the present but there are low information voters and I'm gonna show that to you because they asked them the part that I love is not the polls it's actually the focus group that they did in this case but even the strong approval dropping dropping dropping how can you strongly approve of this okay so they asked Trump supported Wayne grade they talked to 25 Trump supporters now you want the bad news out of the 25 who voted for Trump all 25 would still vote for Trump again this was done before Charlottesville so a little grain of salt on that but still okay but they asked Wayne gray did he meet your expectations and he's like I don't know he says I don't know what I expected I just didn't want Hillary in there ding-ding-ding-ding-ding we have a winner that's the whole election that sentence right there was the entirety of the election and people make it seem like oh no but people like Trump they don't like Trump some do obviously I'm gonna give you some quotes here but most people think I didn't want the establishment I hate the establishment Hillary Clinton was the perfect example of the establishment when you say that people on TV crying cuz they love Hillary but I'm not saying that the voters aren't you idiot she lost she lost because of that we didn't make her lose the people didn't like her they don't like you that's what you don't want to hear your if you're on TV making a gazillion dollars they don't like you you're part of the establishment so that's why they lied to you all day okay Daniel Cohen as to why he's very frustrated now this is also a really bad sign not for Trump but the Republicans overall he said killing Obamacare was a key component of the Republican platform and I believe all the Republican senators campaigned on that very issue the inability to move forward is embarrassing and disgusting so Trump is done so much damage to the Republican Party he walked in there now he's blaming Mitch McConnell for it now all's voters are angry because they're authoritarian so they're like we believe in the your leader the dear leader tells us it's not his incompetent ass it's the Republicans in Congress now I hate the Republicans in Congress wait for the shellacking in 2018 an absolute crushing in 2020 because he's no one could have undermined congressional leaders on the Republican side better than Trump has so here's Joann Museo she says everyone's having a hissy fit because a politician is a president she's still supporting Trump cut-and-dried he's not a politician and doesn't fit in your a little clique here so they're trying to cause a ruckus for him so she's holding strong let's go to Barney Carter he says I was very disappointing the way he ripped up Jeff Sessions who was basically the first one to sign up so that's now having an effect they look they're like look man Jeff Sessions we know he's been on our side forever Jeff Sessions ain't nobody's moderate yet liberal or progressive he's maybe the most conservative senator he was on the Republican side and he's criticizing Jeff Sessions these voters are going wait now this doesn't make sense I know Jeff's a my guy right and these these voters are all super conservative right but he's they're beginning to realize hey maybe this schmuck doesn't have a plan maybe he just lashes out at everybody because it's all about him maybe he's not really fighting for conservative causes he's only fighting for Donald Trump yeah it's really weird because during his campaign he was very detailed about his policy ideas and how he would achieve them it's weird that he's not actually succeeding in any of that yeah yeah and and by the way others that I'm not quoting here but if you read the USA Today piece you can see are also saying wait like we thought it was a why isn't he managing his way out of us the reason they were saying deals that's right here is yo maker right he bragged about how he was gonna make great deals and he wrote the art of the deal and he's a great business person so they're not kind of beginning to shake their heads going wait where are the deals hey where are all these great things that he promised this so Dwayne gray said we'll still support some still on his side when they ask her about all the crazy and stupid things he says gray says he comes out looking like a damn fool 60% of the time that's guy who still says he boat for him and against Hillary Clinton okay nobody he's like but I know he looks like a damn fool more than half the time but finally we get to my favorite Pat jollof I've been telling you guys on the show all this time about a woman I was calling a Kansas mom like an average voter she's right wing you know she's God fearing Christian she's always voted Republican and and you know you might not like her opinions on a lot of things including LGBT rights at least she's not a monster she's not a monster okay she's not a bad person she doesn't go to KKK rallies she's disgusted by that etc right well we found her she's not in Kansas as it turns out she's in Indiana and her name is Pat jollof and she's in this focus group one of the things she says is his words once again are some of his worst enemies so Pat's beginning to realize this guy might be a dumbass okay so she says by the way about Sean Spicer oh he was a sweetheart I'm telling you this is the mom I was talking about and but about scrum uchi says oh I didn't like him he was too he was too crass you see what I'm saying she's she's a decent person she just has some old ways of thinking she's a conservative but she looks at and she thought oh I don't like Hillary right and Donald says he's on our side and she looks a scrim Lucchese ague all that cursing I don't like it I was nice I wish I could be a fly on the wall as she assuming that she did read Ryan Liz's New Yorker piece with his exchange with Scarab Moochie he doesn't like that that doesn't like that and then she said about Trump and and this is this gets to the heart of it he comes across as a bully a tyrant somebody who always has to have his way ding-ding-ding-ding-ding we have a winner I told you was gonna lose those Kansas moms and he's right in the middle of losing them so I like the anecdotal stuff a nice little snide remark there but it's anecdotally of course it is of course and also one other thing that I want to point out but the polls are poles the poles are not anecdotal but keep in mind that poles rely on self-reporting and I think one of the problems with the poles prior to the election taking place was that some people will not admit to pollsters you know what they really think about Trump and so people claimed that they weren't gonna vote for him and then they ended up voting for him and so I don't want to overestimate this poll I want but it's a series of polls and every poll has entrapping so look guys Ana's of course right you can't think just a single anecdotes or a couple of anecdotes and like Mitt Romney should say well a lot of people come to my speeches so I'm I guess I'm gonna win that's not how it works but the polling absolutely positively indicates he's dropping and by the way it's easy to say oh well the poll said he wasn't gonna win no but there there was a clear error in those heat they were pulling likely voters and he brought in people who are not likely voters the same reason Bernie Sanders outperformed the polls in the primaries so there is an actual explanation for that and and and so the trajectory of the polls is absolutely clear and and I think that the anecdotes look maybes confirmation bias on my site but they certainly confirm what I've been telling you for the last six months I told you this was gonna happen I told you these were the thoughts they were gonna have and here they are that's the thoughts they have he hasn't even lost them yet despite all this it would still vote against Hillary Clinton and by the way we were right about that we've told you they don't like the establishment and so the only thing that Democrats can do to lose to a guy like this again is to make the same mistake and to put up someone that is an establishment figure that they view to be as part of the elites and then they go well I don't know what they expect from Trump and he's a bully and a tyrant and what he says doesn't make sense but no way I'm voting for the elite now Trump is of course also part of the elite but that's the tricky used and that's the only reason he won and right now even those voters are going oh boy I don't know what we're gonna do with this guy qit membership gets you commercial free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that get all the network shows and support independent media TYT Network dot-com
