whereas the statistics you refer to and I've seen them it's Jews who are on the receiving end and it is Muslims who are on the delivering end I mean there's no surprise here if you import people from the most anti-semitic culture and most anti-semitic countries in the world don't be surprised if they bring their age-old prejudices with them I've seen studies by Pew Research which is a pretty liberal think tank interviewing people from places like Lebanon Turkey Jordan around Syria those are the most handsome many people in the world the most reactionary in terms of how to treat women how to treat gays out of treat minorities it's no surprise you bring in 30 40 50 thousand Syrians they're gonna bring that ancient Syrian anti-semitism and I'm not sure where this Imam Ayman al qussair are.we is from but if we don't tell these people it's not okay to be anti-semitic they're gonna bring that with them well it's interesting that you say ancient Syrian anti-semitism because if I'm not mistaken historically the blood libel which racked medieval Europe that accused Jews in Europe and during the medieval era that they were took the blood of Christians to make their Passover matzos that was actually originated from Syria and it was an import into Europe at the time well but the fact is that bigotry or racism of any kind should not be tolerated at all whether it's against Jews or Muslims or Christians or anybody so but when we import you know people who have that sort of bigotry that's ingrained in their culture without proper vetting you're just asking for a lot of trouble yeah that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
