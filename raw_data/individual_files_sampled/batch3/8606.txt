TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL UNDER FIRE TONIGHT. Mike: PRIMETIME ED HENRY LEADING US OFF THE NIGHT GREAT TO SEE YOU. DEMOCRATS ARE BACK IN THE FBI AS THEY PUSH BACK ON THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS NO RUSSIA COLLUSION. LISTEN TO THIS. THE EVIDENCE I'VE SEEN, THERE WERE VERY GOOD REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTACTS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD. YOU NOT TO BE A LAWYER AND DON'T HAVE TO BE AT THE ACCESS I HAVE. EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN IT WOULD'VE BEEN NEGLIGENT FOR THE FBI NOT TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY IN THE MIDST OF INFORMATION IT WAS RECEIVING. Mike: FOR VIEWPOINTS FROM INSIDE THE G.O.P. SIDE OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WE ARE JOINED NOW BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN CHRIS STEWART FROM UTAH. CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. Mike: YOUR REACTION TO LATEST ATTACKS ON THE COMMITTEE THERE? I GUESS I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE IS IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION FOR HEAVEN SAKES, SHOW IT TO US BECAUSE YOU MUST BE THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE WORLD BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE DOES. PLEASE SHARE IT WITH US. IN THE SECOND THING IS, ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE THIS THING ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THEY ARE TRYING TO WEAKEN OR DESTROY THE FBI. WE ARE TRYING TO DO QUITE THE OPPOSITE. WHAT COUNTRY WOULD WE LIVE IN IF WE ALLOWED LAW ENFORCEMENT UNFETTERED POWER AND SAID GO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND DON'T TELL US AND HIDE IT FROM US AND WE ARE NEVER GOING TO ASK YOU AND WE ARE NEVER GOING TO PROVIDE ANY OVERSIGHT. I THINK IT'S NOT A PROPOSITION TO THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. WE WANT TRANSPARENCY. WE WANT THEM TO BE ACCOUNTABLE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER ORGANIZATION IS. WHY IN THE WORLD WITH EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE EXCEPT FOR THE FBI. I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD FIND IT OFFENSIVE. Mike: YOU IN A REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE ARE ALSO UNDER ATTACK FROM ADAM SCHIFF. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THE PRESIDENTS RESPOND AND CHAIRMAN NUNES, JORDAN AND GALLEON OTHERS IS BRING IT ON. WE DON'T CARE. WHATEVER IS IN THE SERVICE OF THE PRESIDENT WE ARE WILLING TO DO. THIS IS A DRAMATIC AND NEW AND DESTRUCTIVE LOW I THINK FOR THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES A SICKLY TO IGNORE THE WARNINGS OF THE FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LIVES. Mike: YOUR RESPONSE? IT'S JUST SILLY. IT'S DAILY FOR HIM AND FRANKLY IT'S ONLY FOUR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FBI. IT LETS REVIEW THIS. REPUBLICAN MEMO THAT CAME OUT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN WE WERE TOLD AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS WILL JEOPARDIZE AMERICAN LIVES, IT WILL JEOPARDIZE NATIONAL SECURITY AND THEY HAVE NOT EVEN SEEN IT. THEY WERE MAKING THAT CLAIM THEY HAD NOT SEEN OUR MEMO. WE RELEASE THE MEMO. I WOULD CHALLENGE ANYONE TO SHOW ME ANYTHING IN THERE. WHAT IT DID WAS IT EMBARRASSED THE FBI AND THE LEADERSHIP. THEY'RE MAKING THE SAME CLAIM NOW. LAST WEEK WE HEARD YOU WERE GOING TO DANGER AMERICAN LIVES AND NATIONAL SECURITY BUT THEN THEY LEAKED IT, OR SOMEONE DID. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SHOWN IT TO THE COMMITTEE. THEY WILL SHOW IT AND SHARE IT WITH THE PRESS AND WITH THEIR FAVORITE REPORTERS, BUT THEY WON'T SHARE IT WITH THE CONGRESS. AND FOR HIM TO SAY THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO ENDANGER NATIONAL SECURITY IS SILLINESS. WE ARE THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE. WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST SENSITIVE INFORMATION IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE PROTECT THAT INFORMATION OR AT LEAST THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED. BUT TOO OFTEN WE SEE LEAKS. BUT I PROMISE YOU IT'S NOT FROM OUR SIDE, THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR. Mike: OTHER PROMINENT DEMOCRATS ARE TAKING ISSUE WITH THE PRESIDENT SUMMONING TOP DOJ, FBI OFFICIALS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. HERE'S CHUCK SCHUMER. THE PRESIDENTS BEHAVIOR IS THE KIND OF GROSSLY AUTOCRATIC BEHAVIOR WE WOULD EXPECT IN A BANANA REPUBLIC, NOT A MATURE DEMOCRACY. Mike: WAS IT APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH THEM TODAY? OF COURSE IT WAS. THEY ARE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE. HE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE. THEY WORK FOR HIM. AND HE'S JUST SIMPLY SAYING WHY ARE YOU SHARING THIS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? AND TO MR. SCHUMER'S POINT. HERE'S MY DEFINITION OF A BANANA REPUBLIC. WHEN YOU HAVE ANY AGENCY UP BUT PARTICULARLY A MILITARY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT IS ABOVE THE PEOPLE AND REFUSES TO ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE. THAT IS A BANANA REPUBLIC. THERE IS THE OPPOSITE OF A BANANA REPUBLIC. A GOVERNMENT THAT ANSWERS TO THE PEOPLE WHEN THE CONGRESS REQUEST INFORMATION, THEY PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION, THEY DON'T STONEWALL, THEY DON'T HIDE, THEY DON'T LIE, THEY DON'T DECEIVE. THAT'S THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT WE ARE HOPING TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE HERE. Mike: THERE SO MANY PROBES GOING ON RELATED TO VARIOUS ISSUES. WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS DOING RIGHT NOW? THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO US, THIS LAST PIECE. FOUND OUT THAT HILLARY CLINTON PAID FOR THE DOSSIER. FOUND OUT SEVERAL THINGS ALONG THE WAY BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO US AND WE WANT THIS INFORMATION AND FOR THEM TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAD TO THREATEN IMPEACHMENT EVEN MORE CONTEMPT AND I THINK THOSE TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO US AND WE SHOULD USE THEM. WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS JUST SAY THEY MADE IT HARD, I GUESS WE WILL JUST QUIT, I GUESS WE WILL JUST GIVE UP. WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH. Mike: DO YOU WORRY, BRIEFLY, DO YOU WEAR THAT IN THEM OUT OF THE PER FINDINGS IN ANY OF THESE PROBES THAT A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION WON'T BUY WITH THE CONCLUSIONS ARE? NO DOUBT. IT DOES WORRY ME. WE LIVE IN VERY DIVISIVE TIMES, NO QUESTION. SOME PEOPLE SAY THE SUN RISES IN THE EAST AND THEY SAY NOT IN MY WORLD IT DOESN'T. EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE YOU STILL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL THE TRUTH. WE STILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND IF THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE ARE NOT IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE I CAN'T AFFECT THAT BUT WHAT I CAN EFFECT IS TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPEN, WE ARE GOING TO SHARE IT WITH YOU AND
