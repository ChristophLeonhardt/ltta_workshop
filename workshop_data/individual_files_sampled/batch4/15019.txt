well you will recall our long-form interview with who I would accurately call the rock star of Canadian academia we spoke a great length with our friend professor Jordan Peterson over the Christmas break but what do rock stars do will they go on tour and I am delighted to report the Jordan Peterson is going on a world tour North America Europe even Australia and joining us now to talk about it is the man himself professor Peterson great to see you again Happy New Year Happy New Year Ezra well I'm excited for you you've got your new book out twelve rules and you're going on tour like any like anyone would do the book is called twelve rules for life an antidote to chaos you actually kick it off next week in London I've got three events in London tour already sold out I'm really excited that you're popular around the world I guess that's the nature of the internet isn't it I guess it is it's it's it's unfathomable really I don't really know what to make of it but I'm trying to stay on top of it and and to to manage my way through it properly I mean it's ridiculously exciting it's crazily exciting and and a crazy opportunity and a crazy privilege and so but it's so crazy as they're like you know I talked to a group from LA last night they want to help me put a more extensive tour starting in March and you know I I talked to them about the idea of going on the road and doing my extending my biblical series lectures and going through Exodus because I already went through Genesis and they were like they were all over that he thought that was a really great idea I thought Jesus what what the hell's going on you know like how in the world can it be that there can be a market for a tour for a series of psychological lectures on Exodus and all of a sudden that's of valid business idea it's well I think it shows supply and demand that there is a very small supply of the kind of straight talk you give and a very large demand because the supply is not being provided by traditional intellectual sources that's my theory we've just seen what traditional intellectual sources look like in the case of Lindsay Shepard at Wilfrid Laurier University oh yeah that was that was exciting you know what you know it's really interesting that that that scandal properly stated has attracted attention all over the world people all over know about that it's really it's it's had an international impact I was talking to a Dutch journalist the other day who had been following it quite assiduously and he said that the the Dutch that he knew were were jaw dropped in amazement by what had happened at Wilfrid Laurier and also the revelation I would say that that's more or less par for the course for for much of the Canadian and and American university scene because that that is the case it wasn't like this was an anomaly of some sort but you know I should say there's a group of professors that Wilfred Laurier who are standing up against this you know and organizing themselves so yeah the the people people are starting to to put their foot down let's say and to state pretty forthrightly that they've had enough and I think we're gonna see more of that in the upcoming in the upcoming year I sure hope so and you know James de Morel out launched his lawsuit last night against Google and I went through the documents about 160 pages long and I tell you man that thing will make your hair stand on end yeah I know that you were one of the first people who were able they interview them after that hey let me go through some of the dates and by the way folks you can not only see all the tour dates at Jordan B Peterson calm and we'll have a link to that below but you can click on the event venues your events in London for example or at a gorgeous place and there's so many beautiful facilities in London England be a manual Center it's it's very historical it's a huge venue I think it almost holds a thousand people or so yeah I think it holds a thousand yeah well that I'm also speaking at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles and the Orpheum is just gorgeous beyond belief so yeah that's that's well what I don't know what to say is right this whole thing let me ask you because I have some questions I remember in here in your hometown of Toronto you were scheduled to have a free-speech panel and the panel was D platformed that's the phrase the left uses not to debate someone but to ban them you are at some very premium venues in the UK in Holland in New York in Los Angeles in San Francisco even in Toronto I see you're going to Ottawa I'm just listening these folks by the way go to Jordan beam Peterson Dalek Caan / events you could see them all you're going to my home province Grand Prairie Calgary Edmonton Winnipeg I'm glad to see it Vancouver it's it really is a world tour you even go to Australia here's my question professor how will you or your sponsors in these local towns resist the pressure to have your events cancelled and I know that sounds like a shocking or troublemaking question it's not because it's already happened to you it's happened to me too all right you feel like you have good tenure in these venues oh yeah I think so I mean certainly I'm not concerned at all about the events in law in London or in Amsterdam I'm going to talk to the Dutch they're having a national conversation about Dutch identity and immigration and I'm gonna kick that off and so they have a venue there that seats about 2,000 people and from what I've been able to understand it will be very well documented by the Dutch Press and very well attended by the Dutch political class and so that's a really hair-raising event I would say because I think it's very serious and so it's time for a various very serious discussion about the identity of the West and so I'm going to pose what I see to be the relevant questions but I'm not really concerned about being D platformed like I think that the the tide of effective leftist opposition to what I'm doing has has risen to its maximal point and is about to recede because it just hasn't worked like they'd applied for us let's say with that free speech panel but we were only going to talk to 300 people right that was the original plan and then we rescheduled it and I think we had it was somewhere between a thousand and fifteen hundred people which made it if if not the biggest free speech event Canada certainly one of the top two or three and so the what's my experience is being and knock on wood that's for sure that the opposition that I've received so far has done nothing but increase the effectiveness of what I've been saying and so that's also being kind well that's surreal like who would ever expect that that's not happening you and I have talked about this before and you've made the case that whenever the censorship comes at backfires there's truth there if you can get the platform back again and that's why you're on the Internet and that's why you're a global force is because so far Google YouTube hasn't shut you down you mentioned James d'amour god forbid professor and I don't mean to call bad luck but God forbid YouTube would say we've had it with this Peterson fellow well then you've been be platformed in a massive way yeah well it's harder I thought it's got hard to do that to me though because I'm backed up on places like Vimeo and other places and so if I'm shut down in one place that's not going to work very well and YouTube did shut me down for a day you know and there was a lot of noise made about that and enough so that they turned my channel back on in a hurry and you know I don't run out say so what a lot of what YouTube's doing to conservative commentators like Dave Rubin is D monetizing their like Rubin just had a conversation with ben shapiro and it was demonetised they've demonetized Rubin like mad even though Reubens like he's pretty damn mainstream yeah it's very radical yeah yeah he's a moderate god you know in any in any under any reasonable circumstances Rubin would be why he started clearly in the left you know and I think he moved to the center or something like that but I don't run ads on my videos and so I can't be affected by D monetization well they can sit they can still block you they can suppress your D aphek we've we've lived through all that let me get back to your tour I'm just so excited about I mean I and love so many of the cities on there I just want to call attention to Grand Prairie I I've been to Grand Prairie of course I'm an Alberta boy I mean you've got cities like New York and Toronto and London Grand Prairie is a smaller Center is I'm just curious was there a person who invited you is there like no I went to crying I'm a graduate of Grand Prairie Regional call that's why okay now I know yeah my parents still live up there that's a good reason I was just curious what to jury there that's I I'm very affectionate to Grand Prairie it's it's just one of these things is not like the other lovely Little Theater and was it was the architect was Douglas Cardinal it's really masterpiece the theater and I thought I said it gives me an excuse to go up there because I haven't been up there in February you know when it's only 40 below that's right well I see you're going to San Francisco twice once on February first and then once again on February 17th that's a beautiful city with nice weather it's also the heart of leftism the tides foundation is there so many left-wing extreme extremist groups that's very close to Berkeley do you have a particular like that is one of the most lip left-wing cities in America I'm not even going to say liberal anymore San Francisco is hard left do you have a particular message you're going to bring to San Francisco it's also the tech capital Silicon Valley is nearby what are you going to say in San Francisco well I'm gonna outline I mean I'm gonna talk a fair bit about my book but of course my book talks about well I would say issues of character and culture it's not a particularly political book it's more of a philosophical book or and or a psychological book since I am a psychologist well I want to talk about the danger of identity politics for sure I mean Google at Google is a classic example of this because they've been so willing to play the identity politics game that they're getting slap they're getting slapped hard from the left and the right now right because the leftists are after them for not being diverse enough right and the Conservatives are after them for voice for fostering diversity so to speak in a manner that appears not only to be not only matter that appears to be not only prejudicial but perhaps downright illegal and you know I don't feel sorry for them at all because they shouldn't started playing identity politics and identity politics is a very dangerous thing I mean you see this part manifesting itself now in the rise of the identitarian right and the hard right guys are saying well look if we're gonna play races the thing to be if we're gonna play the racial card then I'll play my damn racial card but don't expect me to lose right and you know that's that's it's understandable especially given that the rules of the identity politics game have already been laid down and clearly by the left let me point out but it's a very bad game I mean we did that we already did that in the 20th century on both ends of the distribution and it was absolutely disastrous absolutely disastrous oh right will people be able to get books at all these events will there be a lot of booyah yeah yeah yeah you'll be signing books will you I will to the best to the best of my ability any people that can take quite a while as well I may presides some of them but I'd like to Adam I like to meet with people but well but you don't have had them how much possible yeah yeah now who are some of these events I can imagine that's different and different so I'm just curious I mean I think it's amazing you're going on tour I'm thrilled that I see the first two events are already sold out in a thousand seat theater I'm glad you're confident that that these venues will stay firm against protests I hope you're right tell me you mentioned one of them was a Dutch debate about that's identity who are some of the other hosts or MCS are you are you under the care of certain promoters or impresarios or other professors they give me an example for example you come and you're doing an event in Vancouver on February 15th yeah the Frederick wood theatre is that just on your own or is there's no that's the vent there's there's a there's a club there a free speech club that was started at UBC and they're hosting me well it's a combination some of them are some of them are set up by penguin UK so that's the first thing and then Polish obviously yep that's right that's right yeah and that was the thrill to be listed with penguin UK I mean god that's my favourite publisher of all time in Finn who I was just blown away by the fact that that occurred who's I see her at the Ziegler hall in the Edmonton on February 11th who's your host there well was invited down there by some of the people who operate one of the theaters it wasn't side there hall it was or Zeidler hall it was another one I can't remember slightly bigger but it wasn't available so it was it was some of the theater people themselves that invited me down there it's a real mix you know sometimes it's students and sometimes it's it's professional groups and and sometimes it's my book publisher and I booked I booked the Orpheum in Los Angeles myself because I was going down there for another reason which I could talk to you about at some point I'm going back down there just likely on September 30th to talk to Jill Rogan again and we have a special guest but I'm not gonna say anything about that at the moment but I'll let that be known soon enough it'll be something that will definitely interest you so it's a whole variety of different people and and that's good and I'm not thrilled to hear this I mean I you have an enormous global platform on the Internet and thank God it has not been blocked yet but I am absolutely sure that if people spend ninety minutes at an event and in person and take a book that you will change things and I've said this to you before on the show and I say it to people I meet in my travels and I'm not traveling as much as I used to you are the number one name that people refer to in terms of changing their outlook in the world and even changing the trajectory of their life and we talked about this in December and I wake you up yes I know you you know that was your reaction last time I'm just saying I'm just giving you a report I'm not I'm not buttering you up if that didn't happen I wouldn't say it I'm and I and I see that and I'm and I'm hopeful and you're more optimistic than me which is sort of funny because I I see the darkness of the censorship and I see the marginalization the D platforming and so far you've been able to lean into the hurricane and not be pushed back and I hope there's no I don't think I'm a dog I don't think I'm optimistic I think I'm a believer in the indomitable nature of the human spirit and I think we can handle this without degeneration into chaos I hope so yeah I hope so too well listen we've always been fans of yours and I'm delighted to invite I mean I see that you're still making adjustments to your schedule although it's it's filling up quickly I think professor that will send an email we have a great number of thousands of Canadians who admire you in fact we've emailed them before about your book we gave them a sneak preview we've even invited people to help with your research scholarship I remember when the government cut you guys yeah it was extraordinary hello we're super fans and I'd like to send this video out to our people and we'll have a link to the Jordan B Peterson dot-com events page so people can just go straight to your page and click it looks like things are filling up pretty quickly I it looks like an exhausting trip though I mean flying to Australia I've done that that's 20 hours in the air I hope you're gonna take some time to sort of recoup I mean this this really is my how virtual my help elf has improved a lot like I was really quite ill over the last year and especially last December but I'm much better than I was and if as long as my health is in order I can handle this so well well we'll see of course no I don't want to get too ahead of myself but and I'm looking forward to it like I'm very happy to go out and talk to people and and all of this is great I mean it's exciting and I feel ridiculously privileged to be able to have these opportunities and although I'm afraid of some of them I'm afraid of them of the Holland event the Amsterdam event in or in in this week that's I believe how you pronounce it because you know talking about European identity in the future of immigration that's you know that's touching hot coals with a bare hand but nonetheless it's a conversation that has to be had and it's one that adults should have we should have a real conversation about what the hell we're up to and why and I want to look here elders you last time I was in the hall and I met with here at builders who speaks very bluntly about these issues and he has a full-time security detail larger even that than I have observed the Prime Minister of Canada because he is under death threat so it is an extremely serious subject over there I wonder if he himself will attend or if that's just too risk you for him listen professor we've kept you very long here but it's great to hear you're on tour I'm thrilled I feel like freedom and intellectual debate is about to take a great leap forward I encourage all our viewers to get a copy of your book let's put it on the screen just one last time it's called 12 rules for life an antidote to chaos and there's a foreword by Norman Doidge who's a very thoughtful man as well I'm pleased to see you out there yeah yeah yeah it was good at Norman he went through the book too and told me where I was cutting corners and where I need to sharpen up my arguments so I had lots of smart people doing that so that was really good of him yeah that's great well this and we're big fans and we'll we'll send an email out to our people letting them know where these events are and directing them to your website great to see you again professor you'll be an audience it's just one last thing there'll be an audio book released at the same time too and I just bring that up because lots of people are used to listening to me and so you know that might be a format that they that they prefer so I recorded that recorded that December so all good I did that in your own voice that's great yeah a lot of people do that when they ride the subway or drive or even throw in an anthem that's great well you're you're you're ticking all the boxes you're using all the different media and it's a real grassroots phenomenon and I wish you great success and maybe when you're in one of your more exotic places if you have a moment so that you're not sleeping or working we can catch up with you and you can let us know how some of these more dramatic places have received you I'd like now maybe we could talk after I come back from let's see well it might be interesting to talk after I come back from Europe things play themselves out yeah all right we'll stay safe and and make sure you you use you keep your health I mean that's an it's a punishing schedule you set for yourself there's only one professor Peterson so you got to take care good luck out there thanks Ezra Thanks
