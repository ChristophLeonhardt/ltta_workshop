>> Martha: MASSACHUSETTS
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN SEEMING
TO REVEL IN DEMOCRATS' END GOAL
AND THE NOMINATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
WATCH THIS.
>> 
>> Martha: IC.
SO THAT HIS WAR AND FINALLY
ADMITTING THAT SHE WILL TAKE A
HARD LOOK AT RUNNING FOR THE
WHITE HOUSE IN 2020, WHICH SHE
HAS PUSHED BACK ON.
JOINING ME NOW IS HURT
CHALLENGER, GEOFF DIEHL.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US THIS
EVENING, SIR.
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO WHAT
SHE SAID?
THAT WAS QUITE INTERESTING.
>> ELIZABETH WARREN HAS BEEN
ACTING LIKE NO BETTER THAN THOSE
OBSTRUCTIONIST ACTIVISTS THAT
WERE IN THE SENATE ELEVATOR.
SHE WAS IN A BEFORE BRETT
KAVANAUGH'S NAME WAS PULLED OUT
OF THE HOUSE, SHE'S BEEN
INFLATING THE VIDEO TO TRY
TO MAKE HIM LOOK BAD, FUND
RAISED OFF THE VICTIM'S
STORY, UNCORROBORATED STORY.
NOW SHE HAS USED THIS ASSAULT ON
DUE PROCESS TO MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHE WANTS TO
RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE GONE FOR
OVER A YEAR IN MASSACHUSETTS,
BUT SHE HAS NEVER BEEN FOCUSED
ON MASSACHUSETTS, SHE IS USING
THIS WHOLE SENATE CONFIRMATION
PROCESS AS A WAY TO TRY TO
INTRODUCE HERSELF TO THE NATION
AS OF THE NEXT CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT IN 2020.
>> Martha: LET ME ASK YOU
THIS.
I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID
THERE.
SHE ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT THIS
WOMAN, AS SHE PUTS IT, WHEN SHE
REFERS TO DR. CHRISTINE FORD,
HAS GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY,
POLITICALLY, SHE SAYS, TO
DEMOCRATS, IT OPENS A DOOR AND
NOW WE HAVE THIS ABILITY TO USE
THIS TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL.
HERE'S WHAT KEVIN McCARTHY
SAID THAT GOT HIM IN A LOT OF
HOT WATER DURING THE BENGHAZI
DAYS.
WATCH THIS.
>> EVERYBODY THOUGHT
HILLARY CLINTON WAS UNBEATABLE,
RIGHT?
BUT WE PUT TOGETHER A BENGHAZI
SPECIAL COMMITTEE, A SELECT
COMMITTEE, WHAT ARE HER NUMBERS
TODAY?
HER NUMBERS ARE DROPPING.
WHY?
BECAUSE SHE IS ON TRUSTABLE.
NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ANY OF
THAT HAD HAPPENED --
>> I AGREE.
>> Martha: HE SAID WE USED THE
BENGHAZI COMMITTEE TO ACHIEVE A
GOAL.
SHE SAID THE SAME THING.
WHEN HE SAID, DEMOCRATS WERE UP
IN ARMS AT HOW HE COULD BE
SO COLD AND CALCULATING.
HOW COME THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING
TO WHAT SHE SAID, IF THEY DON'T
LIKE THESE SITUATIONS TO BE USED
POLITICALLY?
>> THE FACT IS ELIZABETH WARREN
IS USING THIS.
THERE IS NO PRESUMPTION OF
INNOCENCE FOR HER IN THE CASE OF
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR HER TO TRY
TO MAKE POLITICAL BONUS POINTS
FOR HERSELF IN AN EFFORT TO GET
TO THE FAR PROGRESSIVE LEFT-WING
NOMINATION FOR 2020.
SHE IS, AGAIN, IGNORING
MASSACHUSETTS IN THE PROCESS.
SHE HAS NEVER BEEN WORKING FOR
OUR STATE, SHE CLEARLY DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT WORKING FOR OUR STATE
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS IF SHE
RUNS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
SHE IS AN OPPORTUNIST OF THE
HIGHEST DEGREE.
>> Martha: YOU GOT A TOUGH
BATTLE ON YOUR HANDS.
YOU ARE DOWN ABOUT 26 POINTS IN
THE MOST RECENT POLL.
HOW DO YOU HOPE TO CLOSE THAT
GAP IN 36 DAYS?
>> THE SAME POLLING COMPANY HAD
ME NECK AND NECK WITH MY TRIGGER
PRIMARY OPPONENTS.
I WANT MARK TO: MICHAEL AND FRED
SCOTT BROWN AT 30 POINTS AGAINST
HIM WHEN HE FIRST RAN AGAINST
MARTHA COAKLEY IN 2010.
SAME POLLING COMPANY.
NO SURPRISE.
WE HAVE NUMBERS THAT SHOW WE ARE
LEADING WITH ELIZABETH WARREN
