00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so apologies about the wet</font>

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">hair and I generally just shoveled</font>

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,980
appearance I just got<font color="#CCCCCC"> back from work and</font>

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,180
I ran through the rain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,639
was just just blurry blurry right in

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,260
through my face for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past five years</font>

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,670
I've watched a small independent

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,440
bookshop in richmond and sorry called

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,330
the lion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> unicorn i started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that job</font>

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,039
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was 16 but i had done a week of</font>

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,600
work experience during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the harry potter</font>

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,850
release week when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was 15 as of monday</font>

13
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">i no longer work there I just started a</font>

14
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,630
new job<font color="#E5E5E5"> in retail and I've been having a</font>

15
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,310
lot of thoughts about how valuable that

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,650
experience has been and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how</font>

17
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,210
important it is to start something<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

18
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,549
even if it's not necessarily the<font color="#E5E5E5"> job you</font>

19
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,899
want to do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

20
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,370
you're young and you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a steady job</font>

21
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,989
it's somewhere that is very familiar

22
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if you've had other jobs on top of</font>

23
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,110
it for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked at the wimbledon</font>

24
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,149
tennis have done hospitality work and

25
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,829
I've done work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> university and other</font>

26
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,510
sorts of jobs everywhere all over the

27
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,160
place but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always had that book selling</font>

28
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,289
job as a constant as something that was

29
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,210
very reliable I think you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,590
stage they<font color="#E5E5E5"> when if you do have the</font>

31
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,149
opportunity to move on to a new job it

32
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,280
is good to do that just for new types of

33
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,050
energy and new types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people and while</font>

34
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,520
it's a bit of a cliche to say new

35
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,649
challenges it's about allowing yourself

36
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,049
to not be the number one person like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

37
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,549
said in that transition from second

38
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,290
disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> University in the same way</font>

39
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,670
when you move from a comfortable job

40
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,229
just something different you're not

41
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,670
going to be number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are gonna</font>

42
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot of learning and that's</font>

43
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,850
kind of a good thing so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

44
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,439
had other jobs apart for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bookselling</font>

45
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">one and most of those jobs have been</font>

46
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,439
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term an event that I've had</font>

47
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,850
to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the job ray quickly and</font>

48
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,470
meet people and five ways of connecting

49
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,970
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in a very very short amount</font>

50
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,680
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wimbledon was probably the most</font>

51
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,210
extreme example of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it was a</font>

52
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,729
limited two weeks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was so teamwork</font>

53
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,590
reliant I was working on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar and it</font>

54
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,420
was just so dependent on just making

55
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,740
those connections and feeling

56
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,119
comfortable with other people but then

57
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,590
also finding out all the technical stuff

58
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,390
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular bar and that</font>

59
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,610
particular clientele that sort of thing

60
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,890
with particular products and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

61
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,229
an extreme version of any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new</font>

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,390
job experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> sansa gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

63
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,799
tips I thought I'd give some like dog

64
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,630
tips I am by no means an expert on this

65
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just offering my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insight and so</font>

66
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,899
the fasting things I was there going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

67
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">be the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of technically obvious ones</font>

68
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,229
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on time make sure your</font>

69
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,790
appearance is up to scratch to whatever

70
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,409
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of uniform rules they have then</font>

71
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,149
also in terms of rules especially if you

72
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,409
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just starting there's lots of</font>

73
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who've been there for slightly</font>

74
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer time don't push those kinds of</font>

75
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,970
rules you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away with</font>

76
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">bringing your phone with you into the</font>

00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">work environment or</font>

78
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,270
seeing in the work environment and

79
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,890
either way especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the start the</font>

80
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,420
biting buyers rules shows that you are

81
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,280
really serious like your job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if</font>

82
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,450
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that you do consider</font>

83
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,430
just kind of a placeholder job then you

84
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,900
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put the effort in and</font>

87
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are sections where it's good to</font>

take risks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then some things that are</font>

89
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">just good to stick to the rules</font>

90
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,010
especially when you're starting out also

91
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,390
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say as soon as possible get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Tupperware I get clean fill get whatever</font>

93

you need that will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

94
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,250
your own food at home and bring it into

95
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,709
work as delicious as local cafes are or

96
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,480
is cheap and cheerful as your local

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast-food places you will save so much</font>

98
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:46,930
money just by making your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own food</font>

99
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's also kind of a good way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

100
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,930
bring yourself and get yourself into a

101
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,549
good routine of allowing yourself enough

102
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,620
time to make yourself food meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

103
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,049
you're up early enough or or prepared

104
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,239
enough in every way<font color="#E5E5E5"> before going into a</font>

107
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,280
the one that makes such a big impression

108
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,410
especially when you're just starting I

109
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,180
now keep repeating that phrase is when

110
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,920
for example is you who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting new</font>

111
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,780
if someone starts bitching about someone

112
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,250
else who's employed either whether

113
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,569
someone in your group of people who

114
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,790
starting new or whether an existing

115
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,590
employee<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't join in some people</font>

116
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,180
express their nervousness or discomfort

117
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,310
through judgmental comments these are

118
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,989
ties can be very nasty it's also the

119
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">same for conversations with people</font>

120
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,690
who've been now for a really really long

121
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,459
time whether those conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

122
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,750
about people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who've been there for a</font>

123
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,430
really long time or people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

124
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,170
starting you the most important thing

125
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">when you're starting something years to</font>

126
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,709
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in with a positive outlook my friend</font>

127
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,389
Haley and I are really obsessed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

128
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,150
idea of positivity I think it can be

129
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,970
hugely hugely monumentally life-changing

130
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,069
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really save your day that's not</font>

131
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,690
to say you never allowed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative</font>

132
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,579
or down or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lie</font>

133
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,290
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're feeling however I</font>

134
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,180
think that bringing positive

135
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,639
conversations for example and stuffing

136
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,349
away from those that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

137
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,359
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can have a huge impact on how</font>

138
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,519
you view yourself and other people view

139
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,250
and just being a happy person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

140
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,840
your work environment is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive one</font>

141
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,310
or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part of your work</font>

142
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,049
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're involved in is a</font>

143
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive one then the place where you're</font>

144
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,440
spending say eight hours every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day is</font>

145
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,660
going to be a more positive environment

146
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,980
and all of that requires a certain

147
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,930
amount of bravery I mean don't be afraid

148
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,000
to say they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never said anything to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

149
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">personally or actually really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like them</font>

150
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,630
or I didn't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with them</font>

151
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,230
just

152
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,880
