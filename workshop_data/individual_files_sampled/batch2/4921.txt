are you Michael Cohen might flip look I did nothing wrong you have to understand this stuff would have come out a long time ago I did nothing friends it's really nice news breaking just in the last hour from ABC news that Michael Colin has participated in hours of interviews with Robert Miller's team over the last month from that report quote the special counsels questioning of Cohen one of the president's closest associates over the past decade has focused primarily on all aspects of Trump's dealings with Russia including financial and business dealings and the investigation into alleged collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign in its surrogates to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News investigators were also interested in knowing the sources say whether Trump or any of his associates discussed the possibility of a pardon with Cohen joining the conversation is former US attorney and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Harry Lippmann Harry what do you make of the fact that now that Michael Cohen is availing himself to the Muller probe to the Southern District of New York that there is basically an open floodgate of all of Donald Trump's business dealings and all and anything that Michael Kohn may have witnessed on the campaign when it comes to intersections or efforts to coordinate with Russia right I mean it's very significant although I wouldn't say surprising there had been some speculation maybe Muller isn't interested in talking to Cohen but he obviously has this wealth of information on Russia also on the financial side where ABC also reports that he's cooperating with the New York Attorney General it's pretty huge he and and also as with manna Fort Mahler is has holds all the cards right now he's made no promises about whether he'll give him any credit for cooperating same as with manna Ford and both men have to just give it all up and hope for the best and in Cohen's case that is really a wealth of things in in Russia he's in the steel dossier he's in the attempt to form a Trump Tower in Moscow and then also dating back 10 more years on the financial side and it would seem that by this is the first I've seen that Muller's team is interested in talking to Michael Cohen about pardons that seems to me that maybe they're looking at Michael Cohen as the potential witness and the obstruction of justice investigation as well is that the right read on that I think and more generally they endorsed the proposition that holding out the hope of a pardon or dangling a pardon is a potential obstruction of justice that's a theory that applies to multiple witnesses start starting with steel and moving up moving forward including mana Ford so if that if they've endorsed that theory it's going to get a lot of play probably in the report they come to sori what do you make of this ABC news report that it you know it's important when you read this to go back to trump tells and we know from donald trump that the original raid on Cohen's offices was perhaps the gravest injustice that he's perceived so far he called it an attack on the nation the day that his lawyer and fixers offices and homes were raided look they they've they have got to be sweating over there right now twelve hours is a long time it's a lot of testimony I was thinking about the Prague meeting that Cohn denied actually having but which there's some reason to think that he actually might have had I'm it certainly possible to kind of evade passport stamping right but look you know what's fascinating to me is I think the president is being undone by his own lack of loyalty to Michael Kohn and the question of pardoning him is now completely beside the point Cohen is on Teen America on this stuff and if you had just given him some cheesy White House job and made him happy but instead he is he has turned he's not being pressured anymore I don't think he he is ready to cooperate he is going for it and that's got to be terrifying to the White House yeah that's an interesting point at least he he has now availed himself through media reports and through an attorney this has been reported to try to help bring down the president if he has participated in a conspiracy with Russia to affect the election and if you believe the ABC reporting on the pardon to help them make their obstruction of justice case well I agree with Nick that a man who is rejected like Michael Cohen is far more dangerous than one who feels like he still has something to gain from this situation he sold nothing left to gain from Donald Trump and just the totality of the terrible treatment that Trump had heaped upon him and also just why couldn't Donald Trump pay his legal bills yeah why couldn't he as a Trump employee in Trump Inc employee pay the legal bills well let me push back on you though because isn't Bob Muller showing that he's the great equalizer I mean Manafort was willing to stay loyal I mean here's the deal if you know if you have any evidence about Trump committing crimes Moeller is coming for you whether you're loyal or not well I'm not even as interested in Michael Cohen as I am Michael Flynn and his sentencing date was set for December 18th and some are speculating that that is signaling that his period of cooperation is over and the Moller investigation has elicited the information that they need from Michael Flynn what did Michael Flynn do and what went down that he observed during the transition and during those I think 23 days he was a national let me back in on that Harriet let me spread Harry back again real quick on this question I mean it would seem two questions for you one is Muller simply trading up he's now got Cohen a metaphor and he's done with Flynn is that why he's ready for sentencing and pick up the the thread on this question Elise and I are talking about I mean it seems like whether you're loyal or not if you have evidence if you have testimony that Muller wants he's gonna get it yeah he is gonna get it but not it's not simply the disloyalty though that's that's really been vivid but but Cohen is going to be sentenced December 12th he has serious charges hanging over him on on Flynn it does indicate that he's had he's done with them it's a little perplexing because usually you would keep him around if he might need to testify but in all of these we're finding with manna fort Co and etc Muller has belt-and-suspenders everything remember we have the testimony from weiselberger and pecker on on what cohen has to say in general you have a really comprehensive and duplicative investigation by Muller so he I think he thinks he can let Flynn go hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
