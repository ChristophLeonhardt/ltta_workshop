1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
“Toga Toga Toga!”

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,040
Let’s be honest.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,920
Aren’t fraternities overrated?

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
“TOGA!

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
TOGA!”

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,240
"Toga! Toga! Toga!"

7
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,400
So, let’s take a look at the fraternities
that really fit the word “frats.”

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,640
We’ll leave out the explicitly ethnic, religious,
and academic fraternities, and we’ll try

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,200
to remember that every fraternity at every
college is different.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,039
Still, you know the stereotype.

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,250
It’s the type of place that chants “Nerds!

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,960
Nerds!

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,320
Nerds!”...like, a lot cooler than that.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
“Nerds!

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
Nerds!

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Nerds!

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,280
Nerds!”

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,800
“Where are they?”

19
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,300
“I think they’re talking about us.”

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,160
Even when we just look at the goofy, party
side of frats, there are real negatives.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,120
Studies have shown that frats correlate with
increased binge drinking and an average .25

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,530
drop in GPA.

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,469
It’s only once you look into the long history
of fraternities that you understand why Greek

24
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,220
life became a part of college life.

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,440
And why it’s unlikely to go away anytime
soon.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,300
Here’s Benjamin Franklin opening a Masonic
lodge.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,880
Fraternal organizations in the United States,
like the Freemasons, are actually key to understanding

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,600
college fraternities.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,750
You know that eye on his apron kinda looks
like a mystical belly button?

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,700
Early fraternity histories point to Phi Beta
Kappa as the first fraternity, founded at

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,630
William & Mary in Virginia.

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,280
It was an honor society, and early fraternities
were similarly academic.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,060
By 1825, three purely social fraternities
at Union College in Schenectady formed.

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,649
The college system had begun.

35
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,720
The next year, a man named William Morgan
was murdered.

36
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,160
Morgan died mysteriously after threatening
to expose Masonic secrets.

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,690
This led to an entire political party — the
anti-Masonic party — revolting against the

38
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,510
Masons in America.

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,720
It’s less about the mysterious murder than
the climate.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,970
Secret societies were a big deal, and people
were kind of afraid of them.

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,600
That included adult fraternities like the
Masons, but also secret societies in colleges.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,180
Colleges preferred open celebrations of school,
like this bucolic, only slightly violent,

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,920
class day from the 1850s.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,980
This 1900s issue of a Sigma Nu journal shows
consequences of anti-fraternity sentiment:

45
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,950
Laws that banned fraternities or forced them
to operate in secret.

46
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,800
Even successful fraternities had to find strategies
to fight this.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Delta Upsilon started as an anti-secret fraternity
– a frat without secret rituals, for this

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
reason.

49
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,140
It seemed like frats were on the way out.

50
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,540
So what changed?

51
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:24,520
This chart and this flagpole are equally important
to understand how frats took over schools.

52
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,500
Look at that jump from 63,000 students in
1870 to 600,000 in 1920.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,540
It’s massive.

54
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,520
This jump in enrollment created a lot of problems
— and fraternities helped colleges solve

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,770
them.

56
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,740
Like that kid on the flagpole.

57
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,020
College “flag rush” - where freshmen and
sophomores battled over a flag -

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,060
was popular for everybody, not just frat kids.

59
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,080
Look at those ripped clothes.

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Students were injured and even killed during
the scramble.

61
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,350
The point is, college students are idiotic.

62
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,410
Full stop.

63
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,180
And colleges started to see Greek life as
a tool to maintain order.

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,260
First, fraternities provided housing for that
rapidly swelling student population.

65
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,380
Fraternities also provided infrastructure
for disciplining a horde of students.

66
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,060
“Well well well.”

67
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,320
You see scenes like these and wonder why Deans
keep fraternities around.

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,410
But the administration actually brought them
back.

69
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,720
As former frat members aged into leadership
roles, they realized that fraternities gave

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,070
them somebody to yell at.

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,640
“Greg, what is the worst fraternity on this
campus?”

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,320
Fraternities are distributed discipline.

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,050
Deans could yell at Greek leaders, who could
yell at upperclassmen, who could yell at underclassmen,

74
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,350
instead of having to discipline that giant
section of the bar chart all by themselves.

75
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,680
And the big reason for keeping frats around?

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,980
Administrators realized that frats led to
money after college.

77
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,580
Alumni donations from fraternity and sorority
members are higher than from other students.

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,100
Students loved the university through their
fraternities — and the university had a

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,520
lot of reasons to stay chained to them.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,030
That same paper that showed that fraternities increase
binge drinking?

81
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,730
It also showed that they increase alumni income
because of the networking opportunities.

82
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:43,930
That’s without even mentioning the lifelong
friendships that Greek members form.

83
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,700
But the downsides of fraternities can be a
lot worse than what we see in the movies.

84
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,150
It’s easy to marvel at 100 year old hazing,
but as Caitlin Flanagan wrote in The Atlantic,

85
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,950
all that binge drinking and hazing can have
life-threatening consequences.

86
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,290
She notes disproportionate injuries in fraternity
housing, high alcohol use, and alleged sexual

87
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,140
assault, along with a lasting legacy of racial
discrimination.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,900
Whether fraternities are overrated depends
how you view them and how you view college

89
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
students.

90
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,681
We’re all asking the same questions as those
administrators in the 1800s.

91
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,510
And we have to figure out if their solutions
are still the right ones today.

92
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,240
How you view students, and maybe even all
people, changes your answer.

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,320
Do frats help control the problems in college
life?

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,220
Or do they create them?

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,560
You might have noticed that we used the word
fraternities a lot more than sororities, and

96
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:02,840
part of that is historical — for much of
their duration, sororities were actually called women’s

97
00:07:02,840 --> 00:00:00,000
fraternities.
