so as of now there is an online petition with about 61 thousand signatures and all of that is to remove a statue of former NFL player Ray Lewis after he knelt at an NFL game he is a former Baltimore Raven so here's what's happening the petition on train on change.org was started by Erik Mon neo dis of hides he wrote to kneel during the national anthem is disrespectful regardless of what you are protesting I will not stand for that kind of disrespect towards our country especially from a legend such as Ray Lewis but the plot sort of thickens because Ray Lewis says hey I was kneeling but I wasn't protesting this is what he said he said on inside the NFL that he went down on both knees to simply honor God in the midst of chaos Lewis told 105.7 I'm not in the protesting business so he's saying that he was praying he wasn't protesting that's what was going down and the plot thickens even further because according to the Baltimore Sun extra security has been added near the Lewis statue to prevent and if anything happening to it what the hell what is going all the hell is happening so this is gonna come off as an incredibly aggressive but it must be said for the military members that are offended by someone simply kneeling during the national anthem it's like do you call liberal snowflakes I'm just asking right because like do we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the military every year so no one ever offends you or hurts your feelings and why does it hurt your feeling when someone is practicing their First Amendment right in literally the mildest way imaginable they don't like it when you know people take to the streets to protest they don't like it when someone's peacefully protesting you know kneeling during the National and like let's just can we move on it's a form of expression that's protected by the Constitution now obviously this guy who has this petition is a you know private citizen it's not the government taking action against Ray Lewis by the way Ray Lewis really you were praying I mean sure yes I believe that Ray Lewis would say I was praying like knowledge of ray Lew as a media figure yes he absolutely I was actually praying like he gets really very intense he kill a guy like knock gilliguy but maybe kill a guy destruction of justice planned around two murders like that's the thing about real guilty to an obstruction of justice charge in a case involving two murders he said I'm sorry and he found the Lord like I believe like that is Ray Lewis like I found God do you believe that he was praying or was it an excuse to kind of like I believe that Ray Lewis was praying yes but it's not important whether I believe it or not to get I think to your point like yeah but like I believe Ray Lewis was like I was just there to fix everything cuz I'm Ray Lewis Hey as someone who watches football and follows a game and sees Ray Lewis on the sidelines and doing is like media appearances but I just like how crazy like part mobius strip parts part MC Escher painting this is all turned into where it's like it's like things just Pro there's the initial protestors and people protesting the protester but in my protesting but I'm not protesting people who are kneeling I'm rather kneeling to protest people who are upset about protesting the most ridiculous okay and and it's come on isn't it kind of interesting that they're fighting to have a statue taken down because they didn't like what I won practicing their First Amendment right I don't doubt that that is exactly they're just as as aware of how ironic that is and they're using that your government is sending soldiers to pre-emptive Wars and risking their lives okay u.s. soldiers US military members are dying and so private contractors can get rich that is offensive okay you want to sign a petition sign that petition you care about our soldiers that's what you should care about right instead you're twiddling your thumbs and getting petitions out there over Ray Lewis kneeling during an NFL game get your priorities straight okay I get it it offends you and if it offends you that's fine but you getting offended is not something that's protected by the Constitution okay but one thing that you should do and be concerned is the fact that our leaders both Democrats and Republicans is not an ideological thing continuously support war efforts that put our soldiers in harm's way and they sell you this BS about spreading democracy but they don't care about democracy they escalate wars in other countries simply because private contractors stand to make millions of dollars okay that is offensive that's what infuriates me I actually care about our soldiers I want to do something to ensure that we're not risking their lives so others can make money off of them but hey you know what we're distracted by the NFL so let's focus on that yeah I watched I watched football with someone who just like has canceled their football subscription and they were at a like a vent where the football was on it wasn't like they came to like get around this boycott like they came because they wanted to be there but football was on and it was like I believe that this person is angry at football players because this person loves America what I can't wrap my mind around is how you can't just go read you know they're one of the original kneelers the guy who knelt with Colin Kaepernick you can't just go read his column in The New York Times where he says exactly why he didn't he learned he shouldn't be sitting instead he talked to a green beret and said what's the most respectful way I can you know essentially present myself at half-mast the way we put the flag itself at half-mast when there's a national tragedy because I think there's a national tragedy that needs to have some kind of attention brought to it and he lays out the entire reason and how he consulted with people and didn't want to be offensive so at that point and this was said on SportsCenter by Scott Van Pelt like if you're mad at that if you're mad at the Cowboys who knelt before the national anthem and this is Scott Van Pelt saying you just want to be mad and that's it and if if you can look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourself it's not I'm not mad about something else then we can have the next part of the conversation but as more time passes as we have a longer dialogue as we see cert like the president re escalate this thing that was almost a non-issue again yeah and seeing that too from Ray Lewis as well because he wasn't participating in either side but yet he becomes a news story because he's sort of pussyfooting around where he wants to land on this issue and I think you make an excellent point Brent that we need to remember why players started kneeling in the first place and how this began not the distraction that Donald Trump has turned it out to be on Twitter and I think more and more we move away from that and this is an example of that of Ray Lewis saying oh I wasn't I wasn't protesting I'm not in the protesting business I was praying let's then shut the up don't go don't do anything pray you can pray any other time in the game that you want but during the national anthem a lot of NFL players are making a stand so either kneel with them or don't don't no one asks you to pray then and I just what by the way we got to go to break but I really want to get this one last point out just the intellectual dishonesty by people on the right when it comes to this issue right the same people who claim that they are in favor of free speech they will fight for free speech are the same people in their little YouTube shows that talk about oh we can't have politics in football wouldn't it no no politics in football Oh what happened I thought that you were you know an advocate for free speech apparently you don't like this particular type of speech so you're gonna go ahead and condemn it because you don't want politics and entertainment right and then also people like Tommy Loren I hate bringing her up she does things for attention it's clear but think about the dishonesty of someone like Tommy Lauren who's been so critical of these players what did she say when she was on the view and supported reproductive rights I believe in the Constitution I'm a constitutionalist oh really you're a constitutionalist then why don't you value the First Amendment which is exactly what these players are exercising when they kneel during the national anthem yeah but you don't like that type of speech so Constitution doesn't matter when it comes to something that questions your ideology or questions your values so it's just it's frustrating and it just shows you the hypocrisy on that issue and by the way when it comes to free speech I'm gonna go ahead and say that we've been incredibly consistent okay Ann Coulter wants to go speak at Berkeley do you boo at ben shapiro do you boo any person who wants to go speak at berkeley as long as you're not inciting violence which is not protected by the First Amendment do you I will support you even if I disagree with your ideology but they will never turn around and be consistent when it comes to someone on the left or someone with a different ideology practicing their First Amendment right to IT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded
