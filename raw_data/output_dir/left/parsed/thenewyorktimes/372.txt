“These are African
wild dogs in Botswana.
Sneezing.
They don't have allergies,
they didn't sniff pepper.
That's how they vote — sort of.
The group is trying to decide
whether to go on a hunt,
and the sneezers are
saying, 'I'm in.'
Scientists studied the wild
dogs because they're intrigued
at how animals make
group decisions.
All sorts of animals
face this problem.
Meerkats getting on the
move, gorillas, some monkeys.
Even honeybees signal when
they're ready to move — with sounds.
These audible votes let the
group know if it has a quorum.
That's what scientists call
the minimum number needed
for the group to act.
Animals use all sorts of sounds,
but no other creatures were
known to use sneezing
for this purpose.
Scientists were amazed.”
“It's an unbelievable observation
of actually connecting
the sneezes to their departure.”
“First, the dogs all mill around,
and sometimes they go off on a hunt.
Sometimes they lie down
and go back to sleep.
Researchers found the best way
to predict what will happen was
the number of sneezes.
One qualification —
no one knows whether the
activity is voluntary,
like a real vote, or
if it just happens.”
“Oh!”
“Bless you.”
“I'm sorry.
Like a sneeze.”
