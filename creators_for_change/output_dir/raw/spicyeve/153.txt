00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,550
Alright, so! Hey Youtube World - it's me,
Evelyn. I cut my hair off. There's nothing

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,610
there. There's -- LENGTH CHECK! - there's
nothing there. And I will show you how I did

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,440
it. Not as a tutorial, but just FYI. Because
if you come out looking like an ostrich, that's

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,570
not my fault!. Don't email me, don't tweet
me, don't snapchat me, don't nothing. Okay?

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,240
Here's Evelyn from the past to give you a
warning yet again in case you didn't get it

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,140
the first time.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,789
Evelyn From The Past: If you come out bald
head, lookin' like an ostrich, that's not

8
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:32,659
my fault.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,670
The first thing I did was I combed out my
hair. So you can grab a moisturizer, a leave-in

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,359
conditioner, and your favorite detangling
tool.

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,199
Coily, kinky, nappy hair, whatever you want
to call it. It's like shrubbery. It's like

12
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:49,420
horticulture - what is it called?!! - Where
you trim the bushes? Like an art form? Something.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,729
You want it to be like that, so you have to
comb out your hair so that you can see everything

14
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,539
and you know where to cut.

15
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:01,129
And here is Evelyn From The Past again to
tell you how to part your hair...maybe...if

16
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,540
you want to give this a try. But don't take
my word for it I'm serious.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,140
Evelyn From The Past: Okay, the first thing
I'm going to do since I'm going for a tapered

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,320
look because I don't want to look like an
ostrich. I'm going to section off the top.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,320
The way you section off the top is you make
a horse shoe shape. Or, a "U". Right here

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:32,190
where my hairline kind of dips backs is where
I started the part as you can see. But hopefully

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,160
you can.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:44,160
*sings* I have decided to follow Jesus. No
turning back, no turning back.

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,800
After that first cut. After that first snip,
there's no turning back, YouTube. You've made

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,800
it a choice to be baldhead somewhat.

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,930

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,260
So in the beginning I parted my hair in one
like, sumo wrestler type bun, but here I'm

27
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:30,569
going to actually part my hair a second time.

28
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:37,569
And cut that one, as you can see, a little
bit longer than this section.

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,939

30
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:48,939
And then after that, all that's left is to
trim the top!

31
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:56,299
[montage of hair cutting clips]

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Ta-da! I'm going to go to the barber and get
the back shaved down a little bit. 

33
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Just a little more edgy, I just need a little more edge. 

34
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,673
This was my hair before... and this is my hair now.

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,160
Do I look grown? Got these glasses just for effect. Am I grown now?!! 

36
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,900
So in the comments below, let me know if you had any New Year's Resolutions that relate to your appearance and altering it in some way. 

37
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,609
And have you done it yet? If not, you need to get on it. We have less than 100 days left I think in 2014. Get on it! And git 'er done.

38
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:49,109
See you on the internet somewhere, bye!!!! 

39
00:03:49,609 --> 00:00:00,000
