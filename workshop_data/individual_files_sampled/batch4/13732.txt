CNN is now what they've invented a new class of firearms they're warning Americans about the dangers of full semi-automatic weapons watch this is what an ar-15 sounds like General Mark Hertling served in the US Army for 37 years so he knows what the ar-15 which used to be a weapon of war can do and he has strong feelings about the semi-automatic assault style rifle which is the precursor to a weapon currently used by the military the m4 now those are single shots if I wanted to fire this on full semi-automatic all I do is keep firing now I won't probably hit the target when I do this when we look at the target later on but I'm gonna fire about soive shots okay I don't even know where to begin with this you guys a says this is what an ar-15 sounds like and then do you know what it sounds like it sounds like a gun that's what it said I was shocked my jaw hit the floor is the way you're telling me that gun sounds like a gun IKEA's I thought it was gonna sound like a cuckoo clock or something Wow so it sounds like a gun and then he fires it right he fires it slowly that has one may fire a gun he's as a boom boom boom okay they said okay now I'm gonna go full semi-auto and full semi-auto is a contradiction in terms there are guns that are fully automatic that's when you pull the trigger once and a gazillion bullets come out and then there are guns which are semi-automatic where you pull the trigger once and one bullet comes out and you can hold it down as long as you want it's just gonna be one bullet that comes out so what CNN is obviously trying to do very dishonestly is conflate the two things that's why they always say it's military-style weapons this is not what they use in the military I assure you of that so he but then he says okay now I'm gonna go full semi-auto but it's not like he clicked anything on the gun he just pulled the trigger faster he didn't even pull it that fast he just started saying now I'm going full I got warm my finger up here don't you this is a federal weapon this is an assault weapon right here's my index finger bang bang bang bang bang totally totally disingenuous
