00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,256
EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS OR

IMPROPER CONSIDERATIONS ACTUALLY

IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION

00:00:23,194 --> 00:00:24,795
UNDER REVIEW.

6
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,331
THE REPORT DOES IDENTIFY ERRORS

7
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,101
OF JUDGMENT VIOLATIONS OF OR

8
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:31,802
EVEN DISREGARD FOR POLICY AND IT

9
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:34,405
DECISIONS THAT THE VERY LEAST,

10
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,407
WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT,

11
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,208
WERE NOT THE BEST CHOICES.

12
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,411
WE WILL ADHERE TO THE

13
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,580
APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,216
PROCESS, AND ONCE THAT PROCESS

15
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:46,517
IS COMPLETE WE WON'T HESITATE TO

16
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,018
HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR

17
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:50,788
THEIR ACTIONS.

18
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:52,790
>> Bret: AT THE FBI DIRECTOR

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,191
CHRIS WRAY REACTING TO THE

20
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:58,229
REPORT FROM THE DOJ.

21
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,198
568 PAGES, AND IN IT, JIM COMEY

22
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:02,399
TAKES IT ON THE CHIN.

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,869
ALONG WITH SOME OTHERS IN THERE.

24
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,937
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL,

25
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,641
CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR FOR

26
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:11,375
"THE WASHINGTON TIMES," CHARLES

LANE, OPENING WRITER FOR

CHIEF OF "THE WASHINGTON

FREE BEACON."

32
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:19,416
CHARLIE, WHAT DO YOU TAKE FROM

33
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,685
THIS REPORT, YOUR REACTION TO IT

34
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,053
AND WHERE WE ARE GOING?

35
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:24,822
>> Charles: I THINK THE MOST

36
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:27,324
INTERESTING THING IS, TOP LINE,

37
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,493
YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING THERE IS

38
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:31,762
NO EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS IN

39
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,932
THE WHOLE PROCESS, WHICH IS

40
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,067
STRANGE CREDULITY TO THINK ABOUT

41
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:37,835
THAT.

42
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,604
AB THERE IS NO SMOKING GUN WHERE

43
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:41,338
JAMES COMEY SAID BLATANTLY, I

44
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:43,707
WANT TO RAKE THIS THING SO THAT

45
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:45,442
HILLARY CLINTON WINS AND

46
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:47,011
DONALD TRUMP LOSES.

47
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,580
BUT ALL THROUGHOUT -- THIS WHOLE

48
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,215
REPORT SHOWS AT RAMPANT

49
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,884
POLITICAL BIAS, ALL UP AND DOWN

50
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,619
THE SYSTEM.

51
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,121
WHETHER IT'S PETER STRZOK AND

52
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,924
HIS STAR-CROSSED LEVER, OR

53
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:01,559
LORETTA LYNCH AND HER DECISION

54
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,459
TO PUNT ON THE ENTIRE THING

55
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,364
AFTER THE MEETING ON THE TARMAC

56
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,632
WITH BILL CLINTON, AND THE WHOLE

57
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:11,302
THING TO JAMES COMEY, OR ALL THE

58
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:15,005
OTHER CHARACTERS THAT CLEARLY

59
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,007
HAD AN UNMISTAKABLE BIAS HERE.

60
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,442
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU STOP AND

61
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:21,478
CONSIDER THE FINAL DECISION THAT

62
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,280
THEY MADE WHEN JAMES COMEY COMES

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,049
OUT AND GIVES THIS WITHERING

64
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,451
INDICTMENT, AND SAYS, BUT WE ARE

65
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,886
NOT GOING TO INDICT HER.

66
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,521
>> Bret: SPEAKING OF LORENZO

67
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:34,491
LYNCH, I TALKED TO HER AND SPOKE

68
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:38,395
TO HER ABOUT THE EMAIL CASE.

69
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:40,364
WHO IS THE ULTIMATE DECIDER AT

70
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:41,098
THE DOJ?

71
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:43,701
>> IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE MATTER

72
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,168
COMES TOGETHER.

73
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,636
ESSENTIALLY IT WILL BE REVIEWED

74
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:47,037
BY THOSE CAREER INDEPENDENT

75
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:47,838
AGENCY LAWYERS THAT I MENTIONED

76
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,039
AND THEY WILL MAKE A

77
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,075
COMMENDATION AS TO WHAT THEY

78
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:51,842
HAVE DISCOVERED AND WHAT THEY

79
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:52,643
RECOMMENDED.

80
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:54,511
>> Bret: BUT THE UP OR DOWN,

81
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,047
YES OR NO, GOING FORWARD OR NOT,

82
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:57,648
IS THAT YOU?

83
00:02:57,648 --> 00:03:04,455
>> IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY FIND.

84
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:05,856
>> IT WASN'T HER.

85
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,192
>> I THINK SHE COMES OFF NOT TOO

86
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,928
HOT IN THIS REPORT BECAUSE HER

87
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,029
INABILITY TO SORT OF RESOLVE ONE

88
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:13,998
OR THE OTHER, AND I EITHER GOING

89
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:16,233
TO RECUSE BECAUSE I MET WITH

90
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:16,967
BILL CLINTON ON THE TARMAC, OR

91
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,637
AM I GOING TO STAY IN AND TAKE

92
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,037
THE HEAT?

93
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:21,739
SHE NEVER CAME TO REST ON THAT

94
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,540
POINT WHICH CREATED THE OPENING

95
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,380
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMY

96
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,413
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMT

97
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:29,446
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMO

98
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:29,480
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMC

99
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,513
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMM

100
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:29,580
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COME

101
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,613
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMA

102
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:29,647
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMO

103
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:29,680
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COMG

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,582
FOR JANE CALL           JIM COM,

105
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,217
WHICH OF COURSE THE AJI CLAIMS

106
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:34,818
IS TOTAL VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE.

107
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:36,153
MY TAKE ON THIS REPORT IS, IT

108
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:37,288
SHOWS THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT

109
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:39,490
OF THIS IN IT FOR EVERYONE.

110
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,993
I KNOW HILLARY AND TRUMP ARE

111
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:45,996
LOOKING AT THIS VINDICATION,

112
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,998
CLAIMING THAT IT SHOWS CLEARLY

113
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:48,999
THAT JIM COMEY INTERVENED IN

114
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,768
THIS THING IMPROPERLY AND THAT

115
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:54,038
HURT HILLARY'S CHANCES FOR THE

116
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:54,405
ELECTION.

117
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,607
I THINK IT IS JUST STANDARD

118
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:58,242
OPERATING PROCEDURE, YOU DON'T

119
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,777
COMMENT ON AN ONGOING

120
00:03:59,777 --> 00:04:01,845
INVESTIGATION IF YOU ARE THE

121
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,248
FLATFOOT DOING THE INVESTIGATION

122
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:05,316
FLATFOOT DOING THE INVESTIGATIO

123
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:05,749
INVESTIGATION.

124
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,017
COMEY THOUGHT IT WAS HIS

125
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:07,851
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO SOMEHOW

126
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,621
USURP THOUGHT, AND THAT'S NOT MY

127
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,890
WORD BUT THIS IG'S WORD, USE

128
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,624
HER.

129
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:14,792
HE DID IT WITHOUT DISCUSSING

130
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:17,161
WITH HIS SUPERIORS AND THAT'S

131
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,161
PRETTY HEAVY STUFF.

132
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,997
>> Bret: THE REVELATION OF

133
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,231
THIS OTHER TEXT BETWEEN LISA

134
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:21,865
PAGE AND PETER STRZOK, THE

135
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:24,735
SECOND PART OF IT THAT COMES OUT

136
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:29,907
JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, NO, NO

137
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,208
HE WON'T.

138
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,010
REFERRING TO TRUMP BEING

139
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,377
PRESIDENT.

140
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:37,214
WE WILL STOP IT, STRZOK RESPONSE

141
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:38,015
TO PAIGE.

142
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,750
THAT IS DONE BEFORE THE DECISION

143
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,686
TO A SLOW WALK THE INVESTIGATION

144
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:45,823
INTO ANTHONY WEINER'S -- OF THE

145
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,424
EMAILS ON HIS COMPUTER.

146
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,760
AND THE IG SAYS, THAT'S A PLACE

147
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,895
WHERE THE POLITICAL VIRUS COULD

148
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:52,830
HAVE INFECTED THIS ENTIRE THING.

149
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,698
>> AND IT WAS ALSO DONE RIGHT

150
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,234
AROUND THE TIME THAT WE KNOW

151
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:58,402
THAT THE OTHER INVESTIGATION,

152
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:00,104
CROSS FIRE HURRICANE, WAS BEING

153
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,406
OPENED INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

154
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,108
AND STRZOK WAS INVOLVED IN BOTH

155
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:06,577
OF THEM.

156
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:09,013
AT 558 PAGES, IT'S LIKE THE WAR

157
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:11,448
AND PEACE OF JUDGMENT.

158
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:13,684
EVERYONE, FROM HILLARY CLINTON

159
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:15,252
WHO STARTED THIS WITH THE EMAILS

160
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:19,656
ON A CLASSIFIED SERVER TO EMAILS

161
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,525
BETWEEN STRZOK AND PAGE,

162
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,494
INCLUDING JAMES COMEY, INCLUDING

163
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:25,062
ANDREW McCABE, INCLUDING SOME

164
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:26,363
HALF-DOZEN OFFICIALS THAT HAVE

165
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:28,565
BEEN REASSIGNED OR RETIRED SENSE

166
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:31,301
OF SCANDAL HAS DEVELOPED, THEY

167
00:05:31,301 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL EXERCISED GREAT MISJUDGMENT.
