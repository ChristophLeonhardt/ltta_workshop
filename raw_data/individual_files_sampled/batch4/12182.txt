your resume that much better ok we begin today with a controversy of the day the President of the United States just inviting the Philadelphia Eagles so here is sort of backstory the Philadelphia Eagles win the Super Bowl in shocking fashion over the New England Patriots and then a bunch of the players say they don't want to come to the White House now I have said for a long time I know there's been an issue since Trump became president and there are a lot of sports teams where people don't want to show up whenever they're invited to the White House when I've said for a long times I think White House invitations to sports teams are stupid I don't like the ceremonial aspect of the White House all that much I think that it's mats of monarchism I don't like the idea of some King like figure who sits around and gives out magical awards to people as though he is the great leader of the United States as opposed to a constitutional official elected to do a particular job so I'm not a big fan of sports teams visiting the White House in the first place but it's been the thing since Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump invites the Philadelphia Eagles to show up and a bunch of them decide you know what not a big fan of President Trump don't want to show up now this is not the first time this has happened I remember Tim Thomas who was on the NHL Stanley Cup winning Boston Bruins back during the Obama administration decided that he didn't want to go to the White House and left made a huge deal out of it how could he do such a thing and I was on Tim Thomas's side if I don't feel like showing up to the White House to receive an award from Jimmy Carter or something I'm not going to show up to the White House to receive an award from Jimmy Carter or Barack Obama then I don't see a problem with that well a lot of the Eagles were not fans of President Trump which is not particularly shocking given the political breakdown of the NFL most of the players in the NFL vote Democrat most of the players in the NFL are not big fans of President Trump so apparently a bunch of them didn't want to show up there you know dozens and dozens of NFL players on the Philadelphia Eagles and that list had been whittled down to about 10 who actually wanted to show up and there was a report that it was all the way down to like three and a mascot so that was embarrassing for the president so the president then canceled but the president didn't just canceled the event the president then put out a statement about canceling the event and here is what he said he said quote the Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their fo team to be celebrated tomorrow they disagree with their president because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem hand down heart in honor of the great men and women of our military and the paper of our country the Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better these fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony one that will honor a great country pay tribute to the heroes you fight to protect it and loudly and proudly play the national anthem I will be there at 3 p.m. the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Corps is to celebrate America okay so they're a bunch of things that are wrong with this statement so first of all I love the the self-centeredness of the statement is really quite astonishing they disagree with their president because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem I love the speaking of himself and third-person that because Donald Trump is their president he also tweeted out about this as well and here's what President Trump tweeted same sort of message the Philadelphia Eagles football team was invited to the White House unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we cancel the event staying in the locker room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling sorry okay well here's the problem nobody on the Eagles mules for the national anthem no one on the Philadelphia Eagles that entire season knelt for the national anthem there's one player who didn't preseason he was cut no one on the Philadelphia Eagles actually note for the national anthem or attempt to dishonor the national anthem yeah but the President of the United States is attempting to jump on this culture war again this kneeling from the national anthem routine again and again because he thinks he's gonna get a political win out of it when in effect all that happened here is that a bunch of eagles didn't want to show up and president Trump decided to respond essentially by slandering the Philadelphia Eagles this is one of the drawbacks of having President Trump be who he is characterized listen I said yesterday on Fox News and I stand by this president Trump in terms of governments has governed more conservatively than any president of my lifetime for his first 500 days the president of the United States has given us all sorts of wins if you are a conservative he's given us justice Gore said she's turned out to be a great justice he has given us a bunch of appellate court a court appointees who have been just terrific he's given us regulatory reform he's given us tax cuts he's given us a move the embassy to Jerusalem he's given us a lot of wins has the President of the United States but one area where the president continues to befuddle is his approach to these issues now I know that there are a lot of folks in the Trump base will be angry at me for saying that the president is blowing a ton issues like this they think that every time the president mentions the national anthem it's a big win for him but here's the problem if you actually like the national anthem if you like the idea of unifying American symbols what you can't do is slander people with regard to how they approach the national anthem by telling lies about them for your own personal grant Iseman if you really do respect the national anthem then you can't say people aren't standing who our standing you can't do that just out of a fit of personal pique it's worthless not only is it worthless it's counterproductive and it shows that the president isn't really all that upset about the national anthem stuff he's more upset about the fact that the Eagles wouldn't visit the White House and come and see him and pay homage to him that's a big problem for me if you truly care about the symbolism of unifying American symbols like the American flag or the national anthem you shouldn't be using them as wedge issues now I objected when NFL players did it I object to NFL players kneeling I think it's stupid that so many on the left are fine with NFL players kneeling for the national anthem I think that is a cultural totem to which we all should pay a certain amount of respect but the president is doing no better when he decides that he's going to take players out of context unfortunately this actually ended up being an issue on Fox News so Fox News they actually did a segment last night talking about all of this and the producers cut a bunch of pictures so Shannon Brumos was doing the segment's and a bunch of people who were producing decided they would put a bunch of pictures of the Philadelphia Eagles kneeling there's only one problem all the pictures of the man kneeling are them praying it's not actually for the national anthem so here's what it looked like on fox news new tonight the president announcing the philadelphia eagles will not be visiting the White House tomorrow to celebrate their Super Bowl victory due to the national anthem controversy the Eagles who won Super Bowl 52 apparently wanted to send a smaller group of players a handful did not plan to attend but it appears the president said no thanks now the president says he's still gonna host a different okay so in any case you can see actually when you watch this thing and don't just hear it you can actually see that Fox is flashing a bunch of pictures of people kneeling for the national anthem that of course is not true and Fox had to retract that today which is what they should do they got it wrong they acknowledged that they got it wrong that was wrong to slander these players saying that they knelt before the national anthem all of this drove Zach Ertz he's a player on the Philadelphia Eagles to tweet out about it he tweeted quote this can't be serious praying before games with my teammates well before the anthem is being used for your propaganda just said I feel like you guys should have to be better than this and of course I think exactly correctly the Fox News apologized for all of this Torrey Smith who's a wide receiver on the Philadelphia Eagles also came out and bashed President Trump he responded by saying so many lies shaking my head here are some facts now many people were going to go no one refused to go simply because Trump insists folks stand for the anthem the president continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti-military and then Philadelphia's mayor Jim Kenney issued a statement he said the Eagles call the birthplace of our democracy home so it's no surprise that this team embodies everything that makes our country and our city great their athletic accomplishments on the field led to a historic victory this year fans all across the country rally behind them because we like to root for the underdog and we feel joy when we see the underdogs finally win I'm equally proud of the Eagles activism off the field these are players who stand up for the causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community they represent the diversity of our nation a nation in which we are free to express our opinions disinviting them from the White House only proves that our presidents is not a true patriot but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing the parties which no one wants to attend City Hall is always open for celebration the Philadelphia Eagles then issued their own statement they said it has been incredibly thrilling to celebrate our first Super Bowl championship watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration we're truly grateful for the support we've received and we're looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season so what should President Trump have done here you should just swallowed hard and have the players who want to come you should said listen I wish that more people were gonna come to the people's house to experience the glory of our democracy and come see the White House in person which is a really cool experience no matter who the president says I wish more of them are doing that I feel bad that so many people feel polarized by our politics and my invitation stands they're free to come whenever they want to come it would have been fine it would have been fine but the president reacted in thin-skinned fashion and it made him look foolish he shouldn't have done this and he certainly shouldn't have lied about the members of the Philadelphia Eagles kneeling for all of this now in other news I will say the NFL Players Association all responded the stupidest way available also and this is the reactionary time in which we live Trump reacts to NFL players by doing something dumb then NFL players react to President Trump doing something dumb by doing something even more dumb so the NFL Players Association put out a statement they said our union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans for their accomplishment this decision by the White House has led to the cancellation of several player led community service events for young people in the Washington DC area NFL players loved their country support our troops give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place well I don't understand why you had to cancel the player left community service events when the players associations got some money in its coffers if they really want to help out bunch of community members in the Washington DC area those players can still go and do this and in fact if they wanted to show up the president that's exactly what they would do they would say the president disinvited us from the White House we won't go to the White House anyway but we still want to help out the community members in Washington DC but because the world of politics revolves purely and simply around president Trump that means that everything Trump does is the is the black hole around which the entire universe and politics revolves and that's really stupid it also means the president should be more careful about the stuff that he says because this sort of stuff does have an impact on how Americans think about President Trump I have a column up in National Review today all about why Democrats are losing why Democrats aren't unable to get it together and one of the reasons is because Democrats have been fighting culture wars that they are losing well when the president decides to go too far in the culture wars it doesn't help him it only hurts him and only hurts the causes that he is pushing again if you believe in the national anthem believe people should stand for it you cannot lie about people who are standing for the national anthem kneeling for the national anthem for your own personal political game okay I have a little more to say on this but first I don't say thanks to our sponsors over at my Patriots apply so FEMA now estimates that most Americans have no plan for an emergency and the truth is that if an emergency happens I live in California there's an earthquake FEMA may not be able to get to you for at least 48 72 hours well that is why the best time to prepare is now hurricane season is already active earthquakes are rumbling out here don't wait most emergencies or a power grid attack will give you zero warning so act by securing dependable food storage right now my Patriot supply has the perfect food kit to get you started they've helped millions of people for a decade now this week you can get their four-week emergency food supply for just 99 bucks that is a low price for security again you spend 99 bucks you stick it in the closet you don't have to worry about it last for 25 years in storage and that means you're no longer gonna have to worry if there's a natural disaster there's a riot outside just gotta hunker down for a little while then you just have the food in the closet and you're the person who is smart enough to think of it years ago and the stuff does taste good I mean I've noticed that people around the officer legitimately we have to actually get another emergency food supply because we don't starve the people here but apparently they've been going through the pantry and taking out the cans of emergency food splatting eating them now there's no emergency don't do that guys okay but you can get the four week emergency food supply right now for 99 bucks 888 803 1413 that's 888 803 1413 or prepare with been calm prepare with Ben come check it out a preparer with been calm for that special deal again 99 bucks for a four week emergency food supply 888 803 1413 okay so what should the president do with regard to the fact that so many cultural figures dislike him the president should simply point out the cultural figures dislike him here is the nice thing about where the president sits in the pop culture sphere I've made this point over the past couple of weeks with regard to Samantha bee and the rest of the culture from the fact the media are insane over president Trump to the point where they are speculating about missing Melania Trump by the honestly Melania Trump had a kidney surgery like three weeks ago and the entire media since then has been speculating about where Melania Trump went there was a theory she'd been abducted by aliens there's a theory that President Trump was secretly beating her in the basement of the White House or some such nonsense okay everyone on the Left has lost their minds the extent that the Trump could simply sit back and point at them and laugh so the Philadelphia Eagles decided not to come again the president could have said listen that makes me sad I wish they would come but they're not coming and it would've been a good unifying moment for the country but I guess that's on them and the president could have done that instead he decided to play right in their hands because President Trump is a counter-puncher it's it's a pathological thing with the president this is just his personality and he cannot avoid the the feeling that he needs to hit somebody back if he feels hit the president is thin-skinned and he likes to hit back that hitting back is a good thing when it comes to some issues but when it comes to issues like this where we really should be getting a read together and having a communal feeling together around things like football it is not a particularly useful thing again I went to the Super Bowl last year and when I went to the Super Bowl I have to say the feeling of community in the building was astonishing it was astonishing I I can honestly say the only time I felt something like it is when you go to a synagogue or a church event the feeling that everybody is there from one common purpose to watch football to enjoy each other's company to to be in out of the cold honestly where's in Minnesota waving the American flag enjoying the patriotic aspects of the national anthem and the and the Blue Angels fly over and all the rest of it and all that stuff should be unifying the president should have gone forward with the event he should have said to the NFL players I'm sorry that you guys didn't come you really would have enjoyed it I think it would've been good for the country for Eddie to show up and we could have talked about some issues that you guys are having you know reaching out with an open hand is not a sign of weakness mr. president reaching out with an open hand to people who are disdaining you sometimes looks like strength sometimes it looks like you're going beyond the call of duty and I think the President Trump could stand to do that a little bit more and I hope that he does I hope that in the future the President of the United States decides that he is going to reach out to people on the other side of the aisle who have a pathological dislike for him and in doing so maybe open some hearts and open some minds rather than lying about the members of the Philadelphia Eagles which I just think is a huge mistake okay so meanwhile speaking of other stupid news the Miss America competition has now decided that they are no longer going to be having a swimsuit competition so gretchen carlson who's on the board over there she's a former Miss America herself I believe and she of course was the subject of a me-too scandal because Roger Ailes had allegedly sexually harassed her well gretchen carlson comes forward and she says we are now going to do a Miss America 2.0 makeover oh yeah so we are no longer a pageant we are a competition we will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance that's huge that's human and that means that we will no longer have a swimsuit competition and so we're no longer judging women when they come out in their chosen attire their evening wear whatever they choose to do it's gonna be what comes out of their mouths that we're interested in when they talk about their social impact initiative women oh that's really what it's gonna be about so Miss America 2.0 is actually going to be like the Kennedy Center Honors and Madeline Albright will be your Miss America 2018 because we're no longer taking physical appearance into account Hillary Clinton finally has a shot at being beloved by America she can be Miss America 2018 if she so chooses she can walk out wearing a giant trench coat and she can be awarded this because physical appearance no longer counts okay so here's why this is so dumb and I upset about this by the way no I'm not upset about this in fact I think the Miss America competition was always stupid right I'm the guy when I was a teenager used to unsubscribe from the swimsuit edition of Sports Illustrated because I thought it was basically softcore pornography right I mean the fact is that when you are looking at the Victoria's Secret catalog we may have this Victoria's Secret models on the runway people are not watching the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the fashion if those were 400-pound women walking down the runway with Victoria's Secret fashion on the ratings would be nil it's an excuse for dudes to watch scantily clad beautiful women walk around and then they can always say to their wives well I was just watching because I really loved the fashion aspect by the way women if you are taken in by this your boys lying to you okay he's not watching the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show because he's mo interested in the new styles of bra and panties that are coming out he's thinking about what happens when those bra and panties are not part of the show at all okay that's just the way the men work note to note to women all over the world the same thing was true of the Miss America pageant so as a religious person and an advocate of modesty for both men and women I'm perfectly happy with there being no swimsuit competition in the Miss America pageant I also will acknowledge that the Miss America competition was always about the swimsuit competition okay there's a reason that Miss America features a bunch of beautiful women and not a bunch of plus-size models or plus-sized non models who have done wonderful charity work mother Teresa was never going to be in the Miss America 2.0 pageant it's not because she wasn't a charitable human being it's because the Miss America pageant was not about that and here's the part that I find puzzling so I understand my own perspective on this I'm a religious person I think it's stupid to judge women by their bodies that doesn't say that doesn't mean that when you're entering a relationship sexual attraction isn't important it's deeply important it's not say that I don't think that people of all sexes should stay in shape I think that they should to the best of their ability it is to say however that I've always been an advocate for modesty because I think that if you want if women want to be treated as more than pieces of meat by men then it behooves them to understand how men think and men tend to see scantily clad women in sexual ways that's just the way the men think that is nature that is the way it works so that means that if you put on a little bit more clothing men are more likely to see you as a proper businesswoman as opposed to if you walk into the office wearing a bra and panties just telling you okay men are not thinking about your capacity for social media marketing at that point but here's here's where I find the arguments and left kind of weird so I've heard from the left that a woman wearing a bathing suit is actually empowering that scantily-clad women are empowering that in fact stormy Daniels is an example of female empowerment because she chooses to be a porn star and have sex with randos on camera I've heard that this is the essence of female empowerment and then if you say that acting immodestly is not female empowerment it actually is degradation and it is catering to the worst instincts of men and the most lewd instincts of men if you say that then you are anti-feminist your anti female but now I'm hearing that it's anti-feminist to allow the swimsuit competition to go forward but I was under the impression that all these women consented to be part of the swimsuit competition but this was something they wanted to do that that there wasn't the the leadership of the Miss America pageant wasn't down in the in the room whippin the girls to get in their bathing suits but the girls all chose to be part of this you can't have it both ways ladies okay if you are going to suggest that it is female empowerment to get unclad whenever you please then you can't then claim that you have done something feminist by telling women that they should no longer wear bathing suits and there shouldn't be a competition for bathing suits or anything like that I like that maybe what they should have done is they should have said listen this is a consensual competition we can go for it however we want just in the future we're gonna do evening gowns instead of instead of bathing suits by the way it's a lie the idea that they're going to award this to Madeleine Albright or Janet Napolitano or anybody else who is is not the most beautiful elk is just silly okay just it's ridiculous Rosie O'Donnell ain't winning the Miss America 2.0 it's not happening it's gonna be a beautiful woman from California who would look good in a bathing suit or an evening gown or an anything else and and anything else they say to you about this is a lie but it's all it's all just silliness it's all just silliness and demonstrates the internal contradictions inside the radical feminist movement okay meanwhile in in other news but the the situation with Robert the situation with Robert Muller is heating up and that situation is not particularly good for Paul Manta Ford so I'm gonna get to that in just second first I want to say thanks to our

texture calm /ban texture calm /ban to start that free trial okay so the latest news in the Muller gate situation is that Robert Muller the special investigator is now accusing Paul mana for Trump's former campaign manager have attempted witness tampering so here is the story from ABC News special counsel Robert Muller was seeking to revoke the bail of President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort for allegedly tampering with witnesses in the year-long probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election according to a court filing on Monday night attorneys with the special counsel of the accused man afford of quote attempting to tamper with potential witnesses while awaiting his trial which thereby quote has violated the conditions of his release so in other words poem anna fort has on an ankle bracelet and he's under constant surveillance and he's trying to tamper with witnesses anyway got to admire the dude's commitment to criminality my goodness in february within days of Muller's filing a 32 count superseding indictment against manna fort the former trump campaign chairman allegedly contacted two individuals who worked with him on a lobbying scheme to aid his kremlin backed ukrainian clients the two individuals were member of the Hapsburg group described by Muller in February superseding indictment of Manta for has a group of former senior European politicians to take positions favorable to Ukraine including by lobbying in the United States so he was reaching out to some of his European friends Muller steam is asking that the Washington DC federal court revoked manna forts current ten million dollar bail and is asking that the court promptly scheduled a hearing called for by the statute to determine mana forts release status now what's weird about this of course is that the day before all of this broke president Trump was tweeting about palm Ana fort with no obvious reason to do so he tweeted out quote there's only one of two people left who could become president why wouldn't the FBI or Department of Justice have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort on charges that were 10 years old and had previously been dropped during my campaign should have told me Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a very short period of time he represented Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many others over the years but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he wouldn't have been hired okay well to be fair everyone on the right who knew who Paul Manafort was was warning presidents from not to hire him as his campaign manager at about the time that he was hired now I guess the idea here is that the DOJ or the FBI should have told Trump manna fort but remember the DOJ and the FBI were suspicious that members of the Trump campaign other members of the Trump campaign were participating in Russian collusion and it doesn't seem completely out of bounds to me for the FBI or the DOJ so you simply say well why would we tell President Trump about all of this we suspect the President Trump might be more of a window than a wall when it comes to stopping information that can help us capture these guys which brings us to some big questions that I still have about the spy gate scandal so yesterday a guy whose show I really enjoyed a mangie know he responded to a show that I did on Thursday all about spy gauge 2018 these of course are the allegations that the Trump campaign was spied on by the FBI at the behest of the Obama DOJ and the Hillary campaign in order to take down Trump's campaign somehow during the election and I expressed three questions during the show on Thursday question number one was why didn't Hillary or the FBI or the DOJ released the most damaging information about the Trump campaign if this was in fact a setup in a hit the most damaging information that happened during the Trump campaign was the Donald Trump jr. meeting at Trump Tower with Natalia Veselin skya and the emails that were sent by Donald Trump jr. to a Russian connected agent that the Trump family had worked with before in which Trump jr. expressed his willingness to hear information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton why didn't we hear about that until after the election if this was a setup why didn't we hear about that why didn't we hear about George papadopolis who's apparently going around bragging to the Australian ambassador that he had met up with a Russian source who was going to provide him information on Hillary Clinton mails we didn't hear any of that stuff until after the election the only thing that we heard is that there were there was an investigation going on we heard that in the late stages of the campaign but the actual headline from the New York Times was investigation took place and nothing was found basically this is late October I think is October 30th was the New York Times story so that was question number one why didn't Hillary in the FBI release the most damaging information entering the campaign so we already knew about Manta for four years the idea that there were leaks about how man afford and utterly unconvincing Paul Manafort again for years had been suspected of being a Kremlin agent you know that had been going back long before the 2016 elections that was question number one question number two is why didn't the FBI target other members of Team Trump so if Spygate is a thing if the FBI was in fact targeting the entire Trump team if they suspected the entire Trump team of collusion to the extent that they were wiretapping Trump as Trump claimed in Trump Tower in that tweet from January 2017 if that was the case then why were the only people who were targeted inside the Trump campaign people who actually had pretty solid ties with the Kremlin okay those people would be the people that I mentioned before Robert Gates and Paul Manafort and Carter Page and George papadopolis several of whom have already pled guilty to lying to the FBI or to other charges related to this particular investigation so Dan Bronzino responded that when I asked this question I was ignoring that Trump jr. and Trump had actually been targeted the Trump jr. targeting he suggests was the Natalia vessel Mnet's kaya meeting was being run by a fusion GPS which had been hired by Hillary to gather dirt on the Trump campaign and therefore this was some sort of setup by Hillary Clinton I think dan admits rightly that there is not evidence to suggest that Hillary Clinton was behind the setup of the Trump Tower meeting again there is no evidence to suggest that there's certainly no evidence to suggest the FBI was behind the setup of the Trump Tower meeting now is it suspicious that fusion GPS was involved with the Trump Tower meeting yes it is suspicious is that enough for me to go all the way and say that Trump jr. was being targeted not really not really it's hard for me to go all the way without that evidence I'm happy to hear more evidence but I'm not willing to go all the way with all of that there's no evidence the FBI particularly or the DOJ used this meeting to target Trump jr. now Vaughn Geno's claimed that all of this was designed to notice that they could use the two-hopper rules so they could get information on Donald Trump I haven't seen the information they got on Trump if that's the case at this point so maybe when the evidence comes out that's what they were doing then we can talk about it Bunji NOAA also claims that Donald Trump was targeted by the steal dossier so the steal dossier obviously is is originally funded by the Washington by the Washington free beacon it was not the seal that's that's in the statement the steel dossier was not funded by the Washington free beacon an oppo research foul was started funded by the Washington free beacon later on the Hillary campaign picked up the Oppo research file from fusion GPS and then went out and hired a Christopher Steele Fusion GPS Ted using the Hillary Clinton camp as sort of the funders and still put together this dossier now it is false to say that we know that everything in the dossier is false okay we do not know everything in the dossier is false we know a lot of things in the dossier are BS I've said for a long time I think a lot of the stuff there is BS we don't know that everything in the dossier is false seal has been a source that was used by the FBI multiple times to suggest that the FBI was targeting president Trump because they used Christopher

Goldberg so internal Goldberg is coming up on her Sunday special as well so check that out we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation so as I say I had three questions about Spygate question number one was why didn't the worst stuff come out during the campaign question number two is why didn't the FBI target other members of Team Trump tan Mangino had been upset with my analysis of this issue or at least he had challenged my analysis of this issue and and I enjoyed dance Joe so I felt like it was worthwhile responding to some of his responses so one of the things that he claims and what Spygate is all about is that there was a spy targeting team Trump the guys name is Stephen helper Stephen Harper has worked with a bunch of Republican administrations in the past he was apparently asked by the FBI to meet with Carter Paige and George papadopolis after Papadopoulos bragged to the Australian High Commissioner to Great Britain Alexander Alexander Downer about Hillary's emails and after Kyra Paige organised a visit to Moscow that was greenlit by the Trump campaign the fact that he was asked to do so before there was a formal opening of an investigation into Trump rush conclusion doesn't mean an awful lot and to claim that he's a spy okay don't call it a spy you want to call it informing out really care about the language it's what he did that counts what he did is he approached Kyra Paige and he offered him like a couple of thousand bucks to write an essay and that was pretty much the extent of it from what I can tell that doesn't sound to me like mole inside the Trump campaign in the way that is being made out okay finally third question why doesn't Trump just declassify all this material and this is the big one why doesn't President Trump if the Carter page FISA warrant was badly gotten as Devon hoon as is claimed why doesn't Trump just declassify it if in fact the FBI was spying on Trump in nefarious fashion there'd be documentation to show that why doesn't Trump just reveal all that stuff so Dan has a theory and Dan's theory is that Trump doesn't do this because this would somehow interfere with or prejudice ongoing leak investigations but these two issues are unrelated as a lawyer illegal leaks are still illegal even if the president makes the underlying material material unclassified post-hoc so if I leak classified material and it's classified today and five years from now the president declassify that material I was still breaking the law when I leaked the classified material so declassifying it doesn't change anything Trump could easily declassify the pucara page FISA warrant for example without disrupting any ongoing investigation he hasn't and he should I've heard so much about it at some point why don't we just hear the rest of it we keep hearing do J's and being forthcoming with the House Intelligence Committee that is true and that is fair and that's why I think Trump should just go over their head and declassify this stuff like if someone who wants to get to the truth if the DOJ is in fact stonewalling and that's Trump's play not mine right Trump is saying the DOJ is stonewalling well if he's stonewalling then why not just go over their head and he classified this doesn't make a lot of sense to me and the idea that there is some sort of you know ongoing investigation that's why Trump doesn't declassify I'd have to see again more evidence maybe that's true but I'd have to see more evidence of it I don't think it's as crystal clear as Dan is suggesting finally there are two other issues that have been surrounding Spygate that are worth pointing out first trey Gowdy said last week didn't believe the Spygate narrative he said quote I think the FBI if they were at the table this morning they would tell you that Russia was the target and Russia's intentions for our country were the target the fact the two people who are loosely connected to the Trump campaign may have been involved doesn't diminish the fact that Russia was the target and not the campaign okay this was in fact the line that the Trump administration was using for months then they flipped and they said that the Trump campaign itself was targeted what they originally said is we're not guilty originally this was a counterintelligence investigation that was aimed at the Russians and the fact is that President Trump is not a target in fact that's why Trump probably fired James Comey as he went to Comey said the list just say I'm not a target and Comey wouldn't and Trump rightly said why won't you and Comey said well because I think it would be a bad idea and Trump fired him out of frustration and now they're saying that Trump was targeted by the FBI and that he really was the target of the investigation well he can't have it both ways either he was the target of the investigation or he was not the target of the investigation I guess the happy medium would be he was the target of the investigation and the evidence just didn't arrive to indict him but again I'd have to see more evidence that he was the target from specifically as opposed to particular members of the Trump campaign amid the broad suspicion of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign which again wouldn't end with the indictment of particular officials not with their there's no Trump campaign to indict you can't actually do a criminal indictment against the quote/unquote Trump campaign you can only indict people who knew about things and committed crimes okay finally the bunch you know said that I got it wrong when I said Trump had openly stated they were literally stated that he'd fired James Comey over Russia here is what Donald Trump said about firing James Comey and in fact when I decided to just do it ie fire Comey I said to myself I said you know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story nine ever claims that Trump fired Comey to obstruct the Russia investigation in fact I've been saying since the day Comey was fired that he did not do that I have been said I wrote an article that day saying that Comey was fired because he refused to clear Trump in the Russia investigation when Trump obviously wasn't under-investing but for Trump to claim that is that commis firing had nothing to do with the Russia cases which is what he claimed on Twitter that is just not true that's just not now with all of that said there are serious questions to be asked about the Muller investigation what's the scope of the investigation why hasn't in Pitt restricted to the issues at hand ie Trump Russia collusion why we're members of the Obama holdover team leaking like sibs criminally after the election why hasn't the DOJ turned over documentation to the House Intelligence Committee why did the DOJ struggle so hard to avoid turning over information that really could have been declassified why did James Comey keep contemporaneous notes about Trump not Obama why did he leaked information to his friends outside the government I'm not saying that it's impossible that the FBI and DOJ combined to target Trump during the election cycle as quote-unquote insurance against Trump winning although I'm still wondering how that insurance was supposed to work if they never revealed the information but I'm opening the argument I just need to see more information and I haven't seen the evidence quite yet so when the evidence presents itself I am happy to change my mind on all of this well this has led to a real break sort of inside the conservative movement Rudy Giuliani has been ripping up and down trey Gowdy over the last couple of days here's Rudy Giuliani the president's lawyer on these matters talking Chris Cuomo on CNN about it and they said there was no somebody's lawyer I don't know the last time they practice criminal law so don't don't tell me I'd like both of them but they're not the lawyers they don't have the awesome responsibility or representing somebody who is being treated in a way that you wouldn't treat a common criminal so don't tell me dowdy Gowdy and Nunez I got like more experience than the two of them by ten okay so he's angry at both Gowdy add Nunez right not just not just dragged out he's also angry at a Devin Nunez because Devin Nunez has suggested that trey Gowdy may not be entirely wrong so if the idea here is that that Rudy Giuliani has the most experience and therefore he knows what spikes like trey Gowdy was a prosecutor it was a federal prosecutor and trey Gowdy does know what he's talking about there's a rumor that there was not a rumor there was a report going around for Molly Hemingway over at the Federalists saying well trey Gowdy hasn't seen the underlying document so how can clear the FBI trey Gowdy has seen precisely the same documents that Devin Nunez has and he's come to some opposite conclusions which suggests an honest difference of opinion not the trey Gowdy has been somehow picked up by the deep state and turned remember just months ago he was ripping on james comey with the same alacrity as president Trump okay meanwhile President Trump has been talking about pardoning himself again I want to talk about that so President Trump like he came out the other day and he said I have the power to pardon myself this is at best unclear so the constitutional pardon power is laid forth in in article 3 of the article 2 rather of the Constitution of the United States is article 2 section 2 Clause 1 so the presidential have the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States except in cases of impeachment so in other words the president can't pardoned himself after he's impeached and convicted in the Senate so you can't pardon somebody who has been convicted in the Senate you can pardon somebody who was about to be impeached that's what happened to Richard Nixon with Gerald Ford according to the Heritage Foundation the power to pardon is one of the least limited powers granted to the president in the Constitution the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are the pardons that are limited to offenses against the United States and they cannot effect an impeachment process or a previous commutation or lessening of a sentence already imposed a pardon completely wipes out the legal effects of a conviction the presidential power to pardon was derived from the Royal English prerogative of Kings this is why I don't like the pardon power all that much it's not clear how far the pardons can go pardons have been used for broader public policy purposes of ensuring peace and tranquility in the case of uprisings which is what happened after the shays rebellion and the whiskey rebellion for example and the scope of the pardon power according to heritage remains quite broad almost plenary Justice Stephen field wrote in 1867 if granted before conviction it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities consequence upon conviction from attaching thereto it says the possibility of a president pardoning himself for a crime is not precluded by the explicit language of the Constitution but a broader reading of the Constitution and the general principles of the traditions of the United States might lead to the conclusion that a self pardon is constitutionally impermissible it would seem to violate the principle that a man should not be a judge in his own case that the rule of law is supreme in the United States is a nation of laws not men and that the president is not above the law is according to James v nur professor of public policy at George Mason University writing for heritage that's probably my reading is the president doesn't have the constitutional power to pardon himself because it puts him above checks and balances that are inherent now you could make the counter-arguments a the president can pardon himself but he could still be impeached so in reality the checks and balances still exist I think today CK said best alan dershowitz he's been very warm toward the Trump administration legally he says he doesn't think the president Trump has the power to pardon himself look I disagree with a great deal of what has gone on today from the White House I don't think that a president necessarily has the power to pardon himself I wrote a column today in the hill I wrote one a year ago in which I said nobody knows the answer to that question it's clearly on a blank slate nobody should be saying either that a president clearly has the power to pardon himself or a president doesn't have the power we just don't know the answer to that question we will probably never find it out and that's exactly right this is the real question is why Trump is even talking about this in the first place he doesn't need a pardon himself it's stupid to talk about pardoning yourself if you're not going to do it particularly because it just makes you look suspicious now I know that President Trump likes to mouth off on Twitter that's his thing but I'm not sure why this is useful to him chuck Grassley who again has supported President Trump pretty heavily in the Senate he says maybe Trump needs a new lawyer if he's being told this stuff if I were President in those days and I had a lawyer that told me I could part myself I think I'd hire a lawyer and this is part of the problem for President Trump is that he's so inconsistent in his public face on this stuff if he just presents in a public face which is I'm innocent do your worst there's really not a problem here see what you're gonna see and then he said but I got to say the scope of this investigation is beyond any sort of limitation at this point and we need investigations into leaking I'd be with him 100% of the way here but it's all the confused language coming out from the White House that is really not useful so for example the White House has given a bunch of different stories all of them conflicting about who drafted the statements in the aftermath of the Trump jr. Trump Tower story right there's a statement that's put out by Trump jr. at the time talking about how the meeting really was about Russian adoptions and there was originally a denial from the White House the president Trump had anything to do with that statement then it was admitted that President Trump in fact essentially drafted the statement here's Rudy Giuliani being asked about it on CNN you think Jay Sekulow lie maybe he just got it wrong like like I've gotten it I got a few things wrong at the beginning of the investigation I'm meaning my knowledge this is a complex investigation first week or so I got few things wrong and then it was clarified in a letter and that's the final position you can make a mistake and then if you don't if you don't if you want to you could say it's a lie but it was a mistake I swear to God it was a mistake okay so so if they're swearing it's a mistake that's fine but then it's it's it's very difficult to tell when a mistake is being made when a fib is being made because if the mistakes all leaning in one direction he starts to think somebody is fibbing to you again does any of this kind of thing any of this stacks up to a hill of beans in the end I don't think any of this ends up being anything I don't think Trump has indicted I don't think anybody whose ki around him is indicted other than the people we've already heard I haven't seen the evidence of any of that stuff the point I'm making here is that the president ought to be focusing on bigger things and the distractions of the Muller investigation are not particularly helpful to his to his administration he should be avoiding them himself and blowing them up bigger than they are okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate so thing I like so Bill Bryson is a very popular writer I picked up one of his books I've never read any of the stuff he wrote a series of columns called I'm a stranger here myself all about how he had been in Britain for 20 years and then he came back and lived in New Hampshire and it's a very charming funny book all about sort of experiencing life in America anew Bryson leans to the left on a bunch of issues but that really shouldn't inhibit your enjoyment of the book at all America's an amazing place it's an amazing place and a lot of people who are in America and don't appreciate how great America is have spent very little time in other countries they're talking about countries in which they've spent not a lot of time there's a reason everybody is clamoring to get into the United States is because America is the dream right New Hampshire where Bill Bryson leaves it lives that is the dream and he basically acknowledges as much even though he tends toward the left side of the aisle on a lot of key issues so check that out I'm a stranger here by Bill Bryson really worth the read and a lot of fun Drake okay time for some quick things that I hate as we discussed yesterday Bill Clinton has been making the rounds and the fact that Bill Clinton is still considered a respected voice in left-wing circles is just insane so you remember during the last campaign Kirsten Gillibrand he's the senator from New York originally she said that she thinks that President Clinton should have resigned after the Lewinsky scandal and after he was caught in a perjury trap well Clinton has now responded to Kirsten Gillibrand and he says well you know not really I shouldn't resign she's living in a different context well I just disagree with her I mean I think you know just you have to really ignore what the context was in but you know she's living in a different context and she did it for different reasons so I but I just disagree with her he's so gross what is the different context it's exactly the same context hey it is bad she sexually harassed the help it's bad to use your leverage as president of the United States it's up to 19 year old girls working for you it's a bad idea it makes you a bad person when you're married particularly it makes you a bad person so um no you know Bill Clinton still doing this routine of the hilarious part about this is the media sudden awareness their sudden awakening to the fact that Bill Clinton is despicable here's Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC they're talking about Bill Clinton it has been for decades an unbelievable double standard that the Clintons have used and abused where nobody is allowed to go there on this issue and in the age of me too women are supposed to go there and men by the way we're supposed to be able to say what the difference is between right and wrong and when you have done something wrong you were supposed to own it and not talk about facts distorted facts and obstructed facts my god he sounded like Trump I love that this just hit them I love this just hit them like it just hit me and Joe who pumped Trump during the primaries it just hit them that Trump is kind of like Clinton right yeah we knew that guys we're pretty much aware of that like the whole campaign we're pretty much aware that Trump and Clinton used to be buddy-buddy and we've been on top of this thing for I don't know 20 years and now you're proclaiming that Oh Mike I'm just so shocked by Bill Clinton my goodness my goodness it's like Claude Rains in Casablanca I'm shocked shocked to find this gambling going on here here winning sir thank you very much right I mean it's that feel it's just absurd but yeah this is why the left can't get a grip on anything suddenly their eyes have been awakened they've been opened by trumpet until of course the next Democrat is up for election and it turns out that Democrat was shtupping interns and lying about it then we'll just go right back to why are Republicans so snooty why can't Republicans just accept that we have new social standards in the United States that's the way the left operates unfortunately and Democrats have operated I hate this kind of partisanship okay time for a quick Federalist paper we didn't do one yesterday so Federalist 31 Alexander Hamilton writing he's still defending general taxation by the federal government and talking about the argument that we should not be just trying to go to the states and asking them for money that instead the states should actually go over the head of the state governments and we can tax citizens directly so he says as theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailable when exercised over the states and their collective capacities the federal government must have necessity be invested with an unqualified power of Taxation in the ordinary modes he's saying here is that under the Articles of Confederation the federal government gained money simply by going to the states and asking for levies and the states basically said go screw yourself and then they'd know any money so he said well if the states are going to be a burden here then we just have to go around the states otherwise we can't have a functional federal government and then he says in the end this is an important line he says we have to rely on people in the end to maintain the balance between the states and the federal government he says the moment we launch into conjectures about the usurpations of the federal government we get into an unfathomable and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasonings what he's saying here is everybody is complaining that the federal government might usurp all tax money and leave the states bereft but if we imagine worst-case scenario we're never gonna be able to do anything here his imagination may range and pleasure until it gets bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle and knows not on which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured whatever may be the limits or modifications or the powers of the Union it is easy to imagine an endless train and possible dangers and by indulging in excess of jealousy and timidity we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism any resolution he says listen we have to make a call here and we're going to have to determine exactly how the checks and balances work now the truth is that the federal taxation power was just fine up until the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution which allowed the income tax okay up until then the federal government was not an overweening institution that was dedicated to sucking as much money as possible out of your pocket it was really at the beginning of the 20th century that all of that changed so Hamilton's critique of the anti-federalists is Right the anti-federalists critique of Hamilton ended up being right in the long run because the reality is the federal government did usurp an enormous amount of revenue and they continued to do so on a daily basis all across the country okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro
