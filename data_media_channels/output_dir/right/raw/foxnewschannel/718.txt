1
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:05,260
GETTING THEIR SIDE OF THE

2
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:07,363
CONVERSATION.

3
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:09,331
>> ALL RIGHT.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,533
FOX SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,535
BRIT HUME JOINS US TONIGHT.

6
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:14,770
I DON'T WANT TO BE HISTORICAL OR

7
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,171
READ TOO MUCH INTO THIS BUT IT

8
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,974
DOES SEEM LIKE WE MOVED, AND YOU

9
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,843
HAVE MORE PERSPECTIVE THAN MY,

10
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:23,445
TO A PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO

11
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:24,647
POSSIBILITY OF COMPROMISE WHERE

12
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:27,182
ONE SIZE SEES THE OTHER AND IT

13
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:28,384
MUST BE DESTROYED.

14
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:31,186
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT.

15
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:37,593
RECOGNIZED AS THE GENTLE LADY

16
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:39,328
FROM CALIFORNIA.

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,929
THERE MAY NOT BE THAT MANY

18
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,964
PEOPLE THAT THINK RIGHT NOW THAT

19
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:43,465
SHE'S GENTLE OR A LADY, BUT

20
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:45,968
THAT'S THE CUSTOM OF THE HOUSE.

21
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,241
IN THE SENATE, MEMBERS ARE EVER

22
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:54,643
DISCOURAGED FROM DIRECT

23
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:57,379
ADDRESSING DIRECTLY TO EACH

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,715
OTHER ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

25
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:02,151
THEY WILL OFTEN REFER TO OTHERS

26
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:05,120
SUCH AS, I DISAGREE FROM THE

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,121
DISTINGUISHED SENATOR FROM

28
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:06,922
WHEREVER.

29
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:10,292
THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS.

30
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:10,993
POLITICAL DEBATES CAN BECOME

31
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:14,163
HEATED, AND THEY CAN DEVOLVE

32
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:15,698
INTO THE BRUTAL AND BITTER

33
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,533
NAME-CALLING THAT WE HAVE SEEN

34
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:18,167
LATELY, WHEN THE MOST

35
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:18,867
EXTRAORDINARILY HARSH THINGS

36
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:25,674
VIOLENCE.

37
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:29,344
IN 1856, AS SENATOR FROM

38
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:34,283
THE SENATE FLOOR BY A SOUTHERN

39
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:39,221
THAT DIVIDED US SO DEEPLY AND

40
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:40,789
THAT OF COURSE WAS SLAVERY.

41
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,963
WE HEARD IN THAT ERA, AND IT'S

42
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:49,331
DANGEROUS.

43
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,166
IT'S AS DANGEROUS AS STEVE'S

44
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:56,338
AS WELL.

45
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57,172
THAT'S WHY THESE TWO

46
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:59,541
INSTITUTIONS RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

47
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:00,943
KIND OF TALK AND BEHAVIOR HAS

48
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:03,145
CONSEQUENCES WHICH CAN BE QUITE

49
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:03,545
SEVERE.

50
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:04,947
>> Tucker: WOULDN'T IT BE

51
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:06,148
HELPFUL IF THE ADULTS ON THE

52
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,751
LEFT SHOWED UP AND SAID THAT?

53
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:09,818
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE TRUMP,

54
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:16,959
BUT YOU CAN'T CALL PEOPLE NAZI

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
AS ANYMORE.

56
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,396
NO ONE IS SAYING ANYTHING LIKE

57
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:22,798
THAT.

58
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,169
>>  THE LET ME TELL YOU

59
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,137
SOMETHING.

60
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:28,904
THE PRESIDENT DEFINITELY

61
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,773
DESERVES HIS SHARE OF THE

62
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:31,440
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE HE'S

63
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,643
TOSSED ABOUT HIS SHARE OF THINGS

64
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:35,244
TOSSED ABOUT HIS SHARE OF THING

65
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:35,778
THINGS.

66
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,780
HE SAYS THE STRONGEST THINGS.

67
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,715
BUT THERE IS A CYCLE HERE.

68
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:43,185
THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY OR TWEET

69
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:43,786
SOMETHING THAT IS

70
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,721
CHARACTERISTICALLY NOT TERRIBLY

71
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:47,189
PRECISE AND VERY OFTEN

72
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,589
EXAGGERATED.

73
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,558
THE CRITICS WILL RESPOND TO IT

74
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:52,161
BY TAKING THE WORST POSSIBLE,

75
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,232
REACT TO IT ACCORDINGLY.

76
00:02:57,233 --> 00:03:00,369
THEN THE SPIRAL BEGINS.

77
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,438
PRETTY SOON, YOU ARE HEARING HIM

78
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,340
ACCUSE THEM -- THE PRESIDENT

79
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:10,179
AND TIME-CONSUMING LEGAL PROCESS

80
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,713
TO KEEP ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS

81
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:14,550
FROM GETTING INTO THIS COUNTRY.

82
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,757
TRYING TO ILLUMINATE PEOPLE'S

83
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:22,157
DUE PROCESS.

84
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,560
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, WHAT

85
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:25,861
HE DESCRIBED IT IS PRECISELY THE

86
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:28,197
WAY THAT MANY COUNTRIES DEAL

87
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,231
WITH ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS,

88
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,599
AND THE WAY SOME OF THEM ARE

89
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,201
DEALT WITH BY THIS COUNTRY NOW.

90
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,103
BUT THAT WAS LOST ON COUNTLESS

91
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,707
FRONT-PAGE NEWS STORY DESCRIBED

92
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,875
THAT AS AN ATTACK ON THE

93
00:03:39,876 --> 00:00:00,000
JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
