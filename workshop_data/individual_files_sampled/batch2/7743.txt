yesterday Donald Trump announced he was gonna be pulling out of the plan June 12th summit with North Korea in Singapore and he released a letter that was I would say by Donald Trump standards quite reasonable it only had one reference to our horrific nuclear arsenal and a bit of an implied threat there but other than that he called him his Excellency and all of that and so we've been wondering how is North Korea going to respond well they have actually released a statement of their own we're gonna read some sections of this from you this is coming out of the Vice foreign minister of foreign affairs in North Korea who said we have inwardly highly appreciated president Trump for having made the bold decision which any other US president dared not and made effort for such a crucial event at the summit we would like to make known to the US side once again that we have the intent to sit with the US side to solve problem regardless of ways at any time at they did however address some of his slightly more inflammatory comments as for the quote tremendous anger and open hostility referred to by President Trump it is just a reaction to the unbridled remarks made by the u.s. side which has long pressed the DPRK unilaterally to scrap a nuclear program ahead of the summit so that is believed to be a reference to their attacks against Mike Pence but also earlier John Bolton because of the talk about a Libya style solution to the nuclear problem there which if you don't know history was a particularly violent invade a sodomy type solution to the problem when it came to overthrowing Libya's leadership they're understandably a king John one was not interested in that and so now we have the the pulling out of the summit we have the response and we have some idea from Donald Trump as of today how he will respond we have a short step it for you now we'll see what happens it could even be the 12 we're talking to them now they very much wanted to do it we'd like to do it to see what happened John everybody plays game you know so I think we all understood that every phase of this was a negotiating tactic but I love sending a letter and then calling what you did a game a day later anyway we might still have a June 12th summit we never know yeah good news first of all right second of all I love the amusing parts of these otherwise intense and possibly world ending situations it's not world at me because nobody else is really on North Korea society not World War three it's just like it would end the lives of millions of people but so I like to find the amusing part of it and so in their statement I like that they were like they said we inwardly highly appreciated what Trump did because externally we didn't we call this vice-president literally a political dummy yeah but apparently internally inwardly they were like man that guy's brilliant this shows is above all that North Korea and South Korea want peace over whelming poles I mean moon really really campaign on this and what this whole thing shows us is that it doesn't matter if they want peace the US Empire still has this kind of bizarre arbitration of whether they can or cannot sit down for these negotiations I think every story that's told about about the summit and about North Korea in general we're missing this giant framing how did the u.s. shape the peninsula and also the u.s. is the belligerent actor carrying out generous idle threats carrying out these war dreams every day I mean the denuclearization thing the u.s. basically they want the u.s. to pull out these Trident submarines that could obliterate North Korea I mean we are carrying out war game is on a daily basis around there so I think it's important you know not just denuclearizing North Korea but denuclearizing the u.s. around the area the Libya model thing is so disturbing if you're on North Korea side of this because it was after Libya gave up their nuclear weapons which is exactly what we're telling North Korea to do we went in there and then destroyed the regime and the country it still hasn't recovered and that happened in 2011 so that's a very scary thing for Bolton that cycle of all people to say I can see why they would react poorly also it's easy for Trump to say you know we all play these games and obviously in negotiation there's some back-and-forth and you pull out when you don't really mean that you're pulling out and all that stuff but in terms of setting up some sort of big deal you reference Libya it's a great example where it didn't exactly work out for them the way they thought it was going to and then we have Iran where we're like okay we're going to relieve these sanctions if you dial down your nuclear program they do it we certify month after month after month that they're abiding by it and then we put the sanctions back on anyway if you were a foreign country why would you feel that you could negotiate in good faith let alone all of the historical reasons not to believe I mean even recently in terms of deals with this presidency why would you believe that you would get anything approaching good faith out of them in any negotiation and to be fair we're in a Korean standoff if you will because the North Korea's also don't negotiate in good faith and they also violate all of their treaties and if you're talking about denuclearization of the area on the peninsula I'm totally in so they get rid of their nukes we withdraw our submarines wonderful perfect I'll do that deal right now now of course we are not going to be nuclear ice overall for North Korea that's just whether you think that's a good idea or a bad idea never ever not even within a billion years without ever happy bright move right so if the North Koreans have some inkling that that we're gonna head in that direction or that they're gonna get to keep their nukes none of this the yelling at each other or being nice to each other is gonna work out so if the idea is though get nukes out of that region you could totally work out and I hope that it does and and I'm encouraged by that what they have more encouraged by is so far it looks like today on day whatever we're on the palace coup has receded a little bit because what John Bolton Mike Pence did was in direct violation of Donald Trump's wishes they went out there and tried to start a war there's no other reason to mention the Libyan model unless you're trying to antagonize not say hey if you don't do a deal we'll hit you that we say that all the time Obama said that everybody says that right no the Libyan model means if you do do the deal we're gonna kill you anyway so that's the reason why Bolton and pence that of course and they think well I can say it in public and the North Koreans will understand but our leader is so stupid he won't understand they were actually doing a coup of his policy right on national television so I don't think the Trump got read into it but at least right now he's saying no no he's we're back on we're back to you know being friendly so for now Bolton and pence have not succeeded in driving us the war so that's great news and and other gamesmanship I'll also be kind fair whatever you want to say to Trump right look yes he violates his word all the time he did it at business and he bragged about it he's doing it in office of bragging about it so the DLC signs are not really worth the paper they're on historically right having said that I think the the big insults even though they're childish but the over-the-top threats and the fact that he might actually be insane for the moment being has helped the process a little bit in just this scenario right because the North Korean saying we inwardly highly appreciate the president they don't say that unless they're a little scared so I'm give the devil is do yeah I mean what did we think was gonna happen with John Bolton coming on board I mean this is a guy who wrote an op-ed I think for either the New York Times of The Washington Post saying we need to preemptively attack North Korea first I mean that is insane so yeah Trump is a con-artist he talks out of both sides of his mouth but like you said I mean there's people actively working for war with North Korean they're not gonna let up easily as plus the defense contractors stock just plummeted after this peace deal was then declared so there's a lot of pressures for you know but Trump could have came out and reasserted that he wanted this so he's you know he got taken over I don't know why they would start to panic over this we've got Iran coming up yeah yeah a lot of money there yeah it is interesting though to watch the people in the administration cuz like Pompeo seems to actually be working towards a good result in North Korea and James Madison out this morning and he was like we want this summit to happen but then he have Bolton and and pence it's just very interesting this split this dynamic between this side trying to get Trump to do with one thing and this side Chinaman if you it's just this weird show really so Jen that's a great point and so that's the neocons versus other parts of the establishment that are slightly more sane the maddest of the world who are like we got a look I'm gonna be a defense contractor one day but Iran's plenty let's not bite off more than we can chew I know that doing war with Iran and North Korea at the same time probably not a good idea so that's this this same terrible war monger part of the administration versus the insane part I am but is how's it going to wind up how does this movie end no one knows partly because Trump is so easy to manipulate you don't know if the neo cons are gonna win or is it or the Matis camps gonna win and you don't know on which day they're gonna win on which day they're gonna be reversed you don't know who the last person in the room is gonna be you don't know if the last thing that North Koreans say is going to be an insult or a compliment and so and even after the deal is done it's never really done cuz it's Trump so you have to hope that they make a deal and then hold on for dear life two easy ways follow Young Turks want
