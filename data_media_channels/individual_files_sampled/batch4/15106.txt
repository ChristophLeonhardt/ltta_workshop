when it comes to verboten communication we all know we're supposed to avoid using any language or imagery that's deemed racist sexist ageist homophobic Islamophobic etc etc etc but because this is indeed 2017 apparently we must also avoid using the double entendre too because well even a play on words can trigger generation snowflake hard to believe what sort of trite stuff the perpetually offended fine terribly offensive these days the latest example comes via a billboard advertisement promoting the Jack Astor's restaurant chain as you can see the ad depicts a photo of two fishbowl cocktails the copy reads quote we like them big and round end quote now maybe that ad makes you chuckle maybe it strikes you as corny or even distasteful but at the end of the day it's just an ad what's more it's an ad being run by a restaurant chain that embraces a logo of a donkey that's looking over its buttocks so clearly Jack Astor's dines out on being sassy but in this day and age of political correctness run amok even an innocuous billboard ads sporting a double entendre is grounds for certain individuals to go cuckoo for cocoa puffs check out this story in blog tio entitled Toronto really isn't liking the new Jack Astor's ad campaign by the way the headline is 100% certified fake news in that it states Toronto as in all 2.8 million citizens of Hogtown are offended by this ad as opposed to maybe some Torontonians are better yet some squeaky wheel half-wits who have way too much time on their hands in any event here's a smattering of the snowflake outrage quote your advertising is disgusting do any of you have mothers wives sisters or daughters watch your numbers drop end quote and then there was this quote hope you like your restaurants big and empty if you haven't noticed the world is done with sexist in the restaurant and media industries end quote and finally quote what might have been passable in the 90s when the standard aesthetic for beer commercials was wet t-shirt contests can no longer be passed off as cheeky it seems particularly when the joke isn't even clever end quote oh god how I miss the 90s almost as much as I missed the 80s when the virus of political correctness had yet to hit epidemic status speaking of the 90s the Jack Astor's controversy brings to mind another marketing brouhaha that erupted in 1995 namely a billboard ad for swatch that featured a woman with considerable cleavage this imagery even prompted a petition with one academic type weighing in noting that not only did the model have large breasts but they also appear to be gravity defying oh my goodness gracious gravity defying still if memory serves swatch and it's ad agency resisted the outrage the billboards ran as scheduled and lo and behold more than two decades later swatch is still selling watches galore but these days it seems that companies go out of their way to appease the squeaky wheel contingency and so it is that Jack Astor's has already stripped those billboards of that double entendre messaging even though unlike the swatch head the Jack Astor's heads don't even feature any real-life breasts Ã¤j wait a second did I say stripped stripped I'm deeply sorry if I've offended anyone I'm so sorry I truly am for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video you
