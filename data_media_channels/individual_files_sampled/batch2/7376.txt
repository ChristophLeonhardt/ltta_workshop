stormy Daniels an adult porn actress known as Stephanie Clifford in her real life has filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump and of course this has to do with the $130,000 payment that she received from Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen and the non-disclosure agreement that she had signed as in return for that payment now the lawsuit essentially claims that since Cohen's been talking about this case and since Trump himself did not sign that non-disclosure agreement then it's null and void essentially freeing her to share her story and talk about what she's experienced she's also claiming that Michael Cohen up until very recently had been threatening her and telling her not to share the details of this story with the public now she did file a civil suit against the president in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday alleging that since Trump never signed a nondisclosure agreement their lawyers set up weeks before the 2016 election their hush agreement is not null and void there are other components of this lawsuit though that I want to share with you guys Clifford and Cohen signed the contract but Trump never did the suit alleges that he purposefully did not sign the agreement so he could later if needed be or need be publicly disavow any knowledge of the agreement or Clifford the suit argues that even if the hush agreement was valid without Trump's signature Cohen voided it when he made multiple statements to the media and we know that he did he talked about how he paid that $130,000 out of his own pocket that Trump knew nothing about it and even if that were the case there are some potential legal consequences to that well we'll get into that in just a minute the lawsuit also alleges that when the story went public in January Cohen used intimidation and coercive tactics to force her to sign a false statement denying that she had an affair with Trump if is proven to be true that could also have severe consequences for Cohen himself he could potentially get disbarred and again we'll touch on that in just a minute also the hush agreement says Clifford has confidential information related to Trump which includes quote information certain still images and/or text messages okay that's really important so let's begin to break it down first let me start with that last part when this story first came out I had two thoughts about it one I don't care so he slept with a porn star is anyone surprised Melania are you really surprised no one should be surprised by this and I don't care what he does in his personal life and by the way Trump is not a guy who ran on Family Values he's a Republican and all the evangelicals loved him but that's their problem not my problem Trump didn't say that he was the best Family Guy to be fair told me he was on a picture of on the Playboy cover they would when evangelical leaders were posing with him and they in his office etc so that salacious part of the story is totally uninteresting to me it's fun but it's not politically important but I was wondering why did they pay her there was already 21 women who had accused them of far worse things sexual assault sexual harassment this was consensual so ok he didn't wanted to get out because it was right after Melania was having barren and that's awkward but I'm like but Trump he could just deny it I mean that's the number one go-to move for Trump I deny it I strongly deny it right so why in this case did he bother debate $130,000 and potentially get himself in the legal trouble oh she had pictures and texts so the texts are bad because it's gonna show definitively coming from Trump's phone probably that's why they mentioned in the lawsuit and it's gonna say that the stuff that's dirty dirty that's one thing and may be bad enough but if she's got pictures okay oh right that's why they settled that's I'm like oh that now when I saw that in the complaint I was like that's it now makes sense okay so that fits in explains why we're even in the middle of this mess now let's talk about the legal ramifications so now it's one thing for Michael Cohen to get her to do a non-disclosure agreement or a hush agreement that happens all the time that's perfectly normal and legal now that's basically saying you this might or might not have happened though I definitely don't want you to talk about it okay sometimes people do do that just to get rid of a headache and if it's a small amount and that's fairly normal this is a large amount and coming out of the lawyers own pocket is are really weird that gives you an indication that perhaps it did happen right and and then they want her to be quiet about but either way that's fine but when you ask her to say it didn't happen that's a totally different situation and when you have her sign into something that she they're gonna put out publicly as they did recently when the news broke and you know that it did happen and that's why you paid her the hush money in the first place well you took a thing that was perfectly legal and then made it illegal and so even if you don't go to jail over that or anything like that you're gonna get disbarred I mean that is disbarment 101 for a lawyer to ask someone to put out a false statement that you know is false okay and now with his own admissions that he was involved it's that's also pretty much proving that he knew that those statements were false and that they were doing this okay so look again they're gonna have to go through legal proceedings to disbar him etc but a world of trouble there okay now important to is way more important so that's Michael Cohen's problem that's a lawyer and see what happens right but the fact that Trump did not pay her is a bigger problem they actually handled this in the worst possible way because if Trump had said yes I slept with a pornstar what are you gonna do about it there's actually no legal issue there at all if he had said I deny it I strongly deny it still no legal issue he lied oh so what like politicians lie all the time he's lied a million times that has no legal implications but when they say Trump didn't pay it Michael Cohen did Trump can give money to his own champagne someone else cannot give a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to Trump's campaign that's an in-kind contribution they they'll make the case oh no it wasn't related to the campaign II happened right before the election but that's not why we settled it good luck with that but overall it is clear that it was right before the election related to the campaign Michael Cohen paid one hundred and thirty thousand dollars which is way above the limit Michael cones going to jail now look this is a thing he's okay if there was any justice in the world there's no justice and the FEC operated but but but it's not just the FEC FEC is useless that's the Federal Election Commission they got three Republicans that'll block anything if Michael Cohen came out on national TV drunk like say I'm number or straight or sober and came out and said yes I had to do a false statement yes I gave $130,000 an in-kind contribution that I illegally shouldn't have given their PC three Republicans will go nope not buying it okay not free to go but it's also a violation of laws in states and in the state of New York local prosecutors can go after them so we'll see if that plays out now the last part of the puzzle is political now Michael Cohen now in a lot of legal and career trouble a lot okay and apparently in recent story that came out just yesterday Michael Cohen tried to go get the hundred and thirty thousand dollars from Trump because he's like men wait I think you're gonna pay me back I gave her a hundred there just does but honestly with her use that with her he apparently had trouble getting his call returned so what happened Trump as usual screwed him that's what he does to everyone including his closest allies and now apparently his lawyer here's a person you don't want to screw over your lawyer he knows everything about you so if Cohen faced with a lot of legal jeopardy turns on Trump okay so I have absolutely no hope whatsoever when it comes to Cohen getting in trouble for making an kind campaign contribution and the reason why I say that is because he could easily say as his defense that he had made that contribution not to help Trump's campaign but to prevent the information from getting out and harming Trump's family I remember Edwards had made a similar similar argument or case when you know there was some money involved in the affair that he had I know but Ana look I wouldn't be so sure I hear you because almost like there's rampant corruption in America almost everyone gets away with it so you're you're right to be skeptical overall but some people do go to jail for campaign violations just ask Dinesh D'Souza and so he got his mistress to give extra money but he paid her back which was actually meant that he went over the limit and he lied about it and he went to jail so it happens especially a conservative idiots who don't even know how to do corruption most of it is legal you can just give it to a pack you can do an independent expenditure you can do dark money you can do it a hundred different ways but you can't do this where an individual gives a hundred and thirty thousand dollars that essentially to a campaign right Dinesh D'Souza I think gave ten thousand dollars with him and his mistress and maybe his wife real classy guy okay and look up the details online and then he had to go to prison for it so Michael : looks like he's not only in trouble but reeling the fact that he's going to the press and now saying like well I mean there was an agreement and I do but Trump didn't sign it and I don't have the money okay that's bad news for Trump man now if Trump pays him the money he's damned if he does if he doesn't pay him the money then Co is in trouble damned if he doesn't right so and she's gonna win on this particular lawsuit why you don't get to do a nondisclosure agreement that you didn't sign so maybe she is not allowed to disclose things about Michael Cohen because he's signed but Trump never signed that's the essence of a contract you did not agree you are not a party to that contract she say anything she wants about you tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick a wonderful little time bomb
