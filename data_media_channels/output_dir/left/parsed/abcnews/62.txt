>>> THIS IS A AN ABC NEWS 
SPECIAL REPORT.
MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHA
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> LAS VEGAS POLICE IS ABOUT TO 
HOLD ANOTHER PRESS BRIEFING AT 
THE LAS VEGAS POLICE 
HEADQUARTERS IN JUST ABOUT A 
MINUTE.
OF COURSE, ALL OF THE FALLOUT 
FROM THAT MASSACRE YESTERDAY IN 
LAS VEGAS, 59 PEOPLE KILLED, 527
INJURED BY A SINGLE GUNMAN ARMED
WITH AN ARSENAL OF RIFLES, 
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS IN LAS 
VEGAS, IT ALL UNFOLD TED 10:07 
P.M. SUNDAY NIGHT IN LAS VEGAS 
AND THE FALLOUT HAS BEEN 
HORRIFIC.
WE ARE WAITING FOR THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE RIGHT NOW, I'M HERE 
WITH OUR CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE 
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS.
WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT MORE IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ABOUT 
STEPHEN PADDOCK'S ACTIVITIES, 
STILL NO CLEAR INDICATIONS OF A 
MOTIVE. 
>> NOTHING THAT FITS THE PROFILE
AS BEST WE KNOW OF A MASS 
MURDERER AT ALL.
A MAN WHO HAD SOME MONEY, HIS 
BROTHER SAID HE WAS A 
MULTI-MILLIONAIRE, WAS KIND OF A
LONER, BUT HAD NOT HAD ANY 
RECORD WITH POLICE, ONLY PROBLEM
IN COURT WAS HE ONCE SUED A 
CASINO BECAUSE HE FELL DOWN ON 
THE FLOOR.
OTHER THAN THAT, NO OTHER 
ISSUES.
AUTHORITIES ARE VERY EAGER TO 
TALK WITH THE LONG TIME 
GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY WHO 
WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES AT THE 
TIME OF THE SHOOTING, BUT 
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE DISCOVERY 
OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE HOUSE 
THEY SHARED, GEORGE, IN 
MESQUITE, NEVADA.
THEY'RE VERY EAGER TO TALK TO 
HER AND ASK HER HOW COULD SHE 
NOT KNOW SOMETHING. 
>> PIERRE THOMAS, WHAT IS IT, 23
WEAPONS IN THE HOUSE, 19 WEAPONS
IN THE HOTEL ROOM, AUTOMATIC 
WEAPONS OR AT LEAST ALTERED SO 
THEY COULD FIRE AS AN AUTOMATIC 
WEAPON. 
>> EXACTLY, GEORGE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
PERPLEXED ABOUT THE SCALE OF 
WHAT THIS MAN PLANNED AND HOW 
PRECISE HE WAS, GEORGE, AND 42 
WEAPONS, 42 WEAPONS THAT HE HAD 
AMASSED.
AGAIN, SO MANY THAT HAVE BEEN 
CONVERTED WE'RE TOLD AT LEAST 
TWO CONVERTED THAT WOULD TAKE 
THEM FROM BASICALLY OPERATING AS
A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE TO ONE 
THAT FUNCTIONED ESSENTIALLY AS A
MACHINE GUN.
CONTINUOUS FLOW OF BULLETS 
COMING OUT AND MAKING IT VERY 
EASY TO SHOOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE. 
>> MATT GUTMAN ON THE SCENE IN 
LAS VEGAS, YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE 
THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL.
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MR. 
PADDOCK SPENT THOSE FINAL 72 
HOURS. 
>> Reporter: IT SEEMED THAT HE 
HUNKERED DOWN IN THERE, GEORGE, 
PRETTY EXTENSIVELY FOR THOSE 48 
HOURS, IN THE AFTERMATH WE'VE 
SEEN THESE NEW PICTURES OF THAT 
SUITE FROM WHICH HE FIRED -- HE 
APPARENTLY PUNCHED THROUGH TWO 
HOLES AND EXPOSED THIS ENTIRE 
CONCERT VENUE TO FIRE.
WHAT'S MOST STARTLING ABOUT THIS
IS THAT THOSE LONG GUNS THAT 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO, THE .762 
CALIBER WEAPONS HAVE A RANGE OF 
UP TO 1,000 YARDS, EASILY WITHIN
RANGE OF THIS VENUE BUT THAT 
ATTACK COULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
COMMITTED IF HE ONLY HAVE BEEN 
USING HANDGUNS THEY SIMPLY DON'T
HAVE THE RANGE, IT'S ABOUT 350 
TO 400 YARDS FROM HIS HOTEL 
WINDOW INTO THAT CONCERT VENUE 
DOWN BELOW. 
>> ALSO HAD A TRIPOD TO 
STABILIZE THE GUNS AND REMOTE 
CAMERA SET UP IN THE ROOM?
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, WE 
HEAR THAT THERE ARE CAMERAS OR 
HE HAD AT LEAST ONE CAMERA AT 
SOME POINT TRAINED ON HIMSELF 
FOR PART OF IT, OBVIOUSLY THE 
FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE 
KEEPING THAT VERY CLOSE TO THE 
VEST AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW
THE PURPOSE OF THAT CAMERA, AS 
WE STILL DON'T KNOW HIS 
MOTIVATION FOR PERPETRATING THIS
HORRIFIC ACT, GEORGE. 
>> PIERRE THOMAS, WE KNOW HE 
FREQUENTED CASINOS, WAS IN SOME 
WAYS -- I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE
WORD PROFESSIONAL BUT AN AVID 
GAMBLER OF VIDEO POKER. 
>> LOTS OF ACTIVITY, LOTS OF 
TRANSACTIONS.
WE ARE TRACKING AS MANY AS 200 
TRANSACTIONS THAT HE MAY HAVE 
MADE THAT MAY HAVE COME TO THE 
ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
GEORGE.
AGAIN, SO MANY UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS AND ONE OFFICIAL I 
TALKED TO JUST A COUPLE HOURS 
AGO SAID, PIERRE, BY NOW WE 
NORMALLY KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT 
MOTIVE.
VERY CONCERNING. 
>> ONE OF THE BRINGS, BRIAN 
ROSS, IS APPARENTLY THEY HADN'T 
FOUND YET ANY SOCIAL MEDIA 
ACCOUNTS. 
>> NOT THAT WE CAN SEE AT ALL.
HIS GIRLFRIEND DID HAVE A 
FACEBOOK PAGE NOW TAKEN DOWN, 
BUT NOTHING THAT WE SAW OF MR. 
PADDOCK, NOT AT ALL. 
>> AND MARILOU DANLEY ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT SURPRISED ALL OF US 
WAS HOW QUICKLY AUTHORITIES CAME
TO THE CONCLUSION THEY SAID THAT
SHE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THIS IN 
ANY WAY.
IS THERE SKEPTICISM RISING?
>> CERTAINLY IS AND THEY'RE 
DIALING BACK THAT EARLY 
STATEMENT SAYING NOW THEY WANT 
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A
ROLE.
THE QUESTION REALLY HOW COULD 
SHE NOT KNOW THERE WERE SO MANY 
WEAPONS AT THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD
BEEN STOCKPILING THESE OVER 
SEVERAL WEEKS AND ALSO THE 
QUESTION OF THE MONEY TRANSFERS 
HE MADE TO THE PHILIPPINES, TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE 
WEEKS BEFORE THE SHOOTING SENT 
TO THE PHILIPPINES TO SOMEONE 
THERE. 
>> WE KNOW THAT HE SENT THE 
MONEY TO THE PHILIPPINES, WE 
DON'T KNOW IT WAS TO HER. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> BUT ALSO
LEARNED YESTERDAY, BRIAN, IS 
THAT AT LEAST NEIGHBORS OF THE 
COUPLE IN MESQUITE HAD SEEN THEM
AS RECENTLY AS TWO WEEKS AGO, 
THEY SAID ACTING RELATIVELY 
NORMALLY. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE ARRIVED IN THE PHILIPPINES 
ACCORDING TO TRAVEL RECORDS THAT
ABC HAS REVIEWED ON SEPTEMBER 
15th WHICH WAS JUST TWO WEEKS OR
SO BEFORE THE SHOOTING.
SHE HAD NOT BEEN THERE IN A 
COUPLE YEARS.
SHE WAS THERE, MADE A QUICK TRIP
TO HONG KONG, BACK TO THE 
PHILIPPINES AND WAS IN THE 
PHILIPPINES ON THE DAY OF THE 
SHOOTING WE WERE TOLD. 
>> HEAR COMES THE SHERIFF.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR -- THIS
IS NOT GOING TO WORK.
>> DID WE GET EVERYBODY IN?
WHERE IS KEN?
OH, THERE HE IS.
I HAVE TO KEEP MY EYE ON YOU.
CARLOS?
ARE WE GOOD?
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW ANY 
VIDEO.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.
YOU ALL ARE AWARE WHO I AM, 
SHERIFF JOE LOMBARDO, CLARK 
COUNTY.
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENT ORCHESTRATION IN THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE AS COMPARED TO 
THE REST.
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW, 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE 
ADDRESS THE VICTIM ISSUES WE ARE
EXPERIENCING AND THE RESOURCE 
ISSUES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING.
SO I'M GOING TO KEY ON THAT.
ON THE ORIGINAL PORTION OF THIS 
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY 
COMMISSIONER SISLAK IS GOING TO 
PROVIDE DONATION INFORMATION AND
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AFTER THAT I 
WILL COME BACK TO THE PODIUM AND
ADDRESS THE OVERALL 
INVESTIGATION, WHERE WE STAND 
AND WHERE WE ARE GOING.
NOW, REFERENCE TO THE 
INVESTIGATION PIECE, I DON'T 
WANT TO REPEAT OF WHAT I 
EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY.
IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.
SO I WILL BE LIMITED IN THE 
DETAILS THAT I PROVIDE YOU, BUT 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THROUGH 
THIS WITH SOME MODICUM OF 
DECORUM.
SO PLEASE DON'T RUSH ME ALL AT 
ONCE WHEN WE GET TO THE QUESTION
PHASE.
I WILL IDENTIFY YOU IF YOU JUST 
RAISE YOUR HAND.
SOUND FAIR?
ALL RIGHT.
WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.
OKAY.
SO AS A MATTER OF FORMALITY OUR 
DEPARTMENT HAS WORKED THROUGH 
THE NIGHT TO IDENTIFY ALL THE 
VICTIMS OF SUNDAY EVENING'S MASS
SHOOTING ON ROUTE -- AT THE 
ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL.
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL BUT THREE
VICTIMS.
WE STILL HAVE AN ACTIVE SCENE AT
THE GROUNDS NEAR MANDALAY BAY SO
WE ASK ANYONE TO STAY AWAY 
INTEREST THAT AREA UNTIL FURTHER
NOTICE.
THE FBI IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO
CLEAR THAT SCENE.
SO THE QUESTION IS THE FBI 
VERSUS US.
WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE FBI, 
AS I SAID, FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING OF THIS IN THE 
INVESTIGATIVE PHASE.
THE FBI HAS BROUGHT A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES OUT OF 
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO ASSIST US 
WITH THAT.
SO THE REASON WHY THE HARVEST 
FESTIVAL WAS STILL IN 
CONTINUATION OF INVESTIGATION IS
NOT ONLY SOLELY RELATED TO THE 
REMOVAL OF THE VICTIMS, BUT IT'S
ALSO DOCUMENTATION OF THE SCENE.
SO WE'RE USING THE BEST PRACTICE
TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT WE 
HAVE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION.
THAT'S WHY IT IS TAKING A LONGER
PERIOD OF TIME ASSOCIATED WITH 
THIS.
SO WE ASK FOR EVERYBODY'S 
PATIENCE.
AS FAR AS LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD, 
NORTH AND SOUTH, WE ANTICIPATE 
TO BE OPEN SHORTLY, IN THE NEXT 
FEW HOURS, TO BENEFIT WITH 
COMMERCE AND WHAT WE DO AS A 
COMMUNITY.
ALL RIGHT.
THE KEY COMPONENT HERE IS 
RESOURCES AND VICTIM 
IDENTIFICATION.
SO BEAR WITH ME, I'M GOING TO 
TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS THE BEST
I CAN, BUT THE IMPORTANT PIECE 
IS IF YOU MISSED A NUMBER, WE 
ARE PUTTING UP ON LVMPD.COM IN 
THE NEXT HOUR THE LISTING OF ALL
NUMBERS I SHALL PROVIDE YOU 
TODAY AND FOR PEOPLE OUT IN THE 
PUBLIC TO CONTACT US IF THEY ARE
LACKING THIS OR THEY DON'T SEE 
THIS BROADCAST.
OKAY.
WE ARE ASKING FOR ANYONE WHO 
MIGHT HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE
SHOOTING IN A CRIMINAL CAPACITY 
OR IS A VICTIM OF THE SHOOTING 
TO CONTACT US VIA 311.
IF YOU ARE OUT OF STATE, IF YOU 
HAVE LEFT SINCE THE SHOOTING AND
YOU HAVE DISCOVERED YOU ARE -- 
YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE BECOME A 
VICTIM OR YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE 
AN INJURY ASSOCIATED TO IT, 
WE'RE STILL ASKING YOU TO 
CONTACT US, BUT THE OUT OF STATE
NUMBER WILL BE 702-828-3111.
ADDITIONALLY IF YOU ARE LOCAL 
AND YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
RESPOND TO A LOCAL SUBSTATION, A
WORKING POLICE SUBSTATION, 
LOCALS ARE FAMILIAR WITH, YOU 
HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILE A 
REPORT AT THAT LOCATION.
NOW, THE FAMILY REUNIFICATION.
ALL THAT IS OCCURRING AT THE 
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AT THE 
CONVENTION CENTER LOCATED AT 
3150 PARADISE ROAD.
YOU CAN GO THERE TO FILE A 
MISSING PERSON REPORT, YOU CAN 
GO THERE TO HAVE CONTACT WITH 
THE CORONER'S OFFICE, YOU CAN GO
THERE TO GET ANSWERS TO YOUR 
QUESTIONS AS FAR AS FAMILY 
REUNIFICATION.
THE PHONE NUMBER IF YOU HAVE 
LEFT THE AREA IS 1-866-535-5654.
NOW, WE WENT THROUGH A LITTLE 
SHORT PROCESS HERE RECENTLY 
WHERE THAT NUMBER WAS DOWN, WE 
PROVIDED A SEPARATE NUMBER, BUT 
WE WILL GO BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL
NUMBER BECAUSE WE HAVE THE 
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THAT FIXED.
SO I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON 
THE DIFFERENCE.
IF YOU ARE REPORTING THE CRIME 
OR YOU FEEL YOU ARE A VICTIM OF 
A CRIME, 311 IS YOUR OUTLET.
OR A LOCAL POLICE SUBSTATION.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR VICTIM 
INFORMATION OR FAMILY 
REUNIFICATION, THE FAMILY 
RESOURCE CENTER ON PARADISE ROAD
IS YOUR POINT OF CONTACT.
NOW, PERSONAL PROPERTY.
WE'RE GETTING SEVERAL QUESTIONS 
THROUGHOUT YESTERDAY AND 
CONTINUING TODAY ON PEOPLE 
ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER THEIR 
PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE ROUTE
91 SCENE.
WE ARE WORKING OUT THE DETAILS 
OF THAT.
WE ARE IN THE PLANNING PHASE OF 
THAT AND WE WILL HAVE AN ANSWER 
FOR THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE 
HOURS.
SO LVMPD.COM WILL PROVIDE AN 
ANSWER TO THAT PROBABLY BEFORE 
WE HAVE ANOTHER PRESS 
CONFERENCE, BUT WE ARE WORKING 
DILIGENTLY TO GET INDIVIDUALS 
WHO LEFT PERSONAL PROPERTY AT 
THE SCENE BACK TO THEM AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE.
I ANTICIPATE IT WILL NOT TAKE 
PLACE AT THE ROUTE 91 LOCATION, 
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE YOU 
FURTHERANCE OF CLARIFICATION AT 
THIS POINT, SO YOU WILL BE 
PROVIDED THAT.
THE OTHER ISSUE IS DONATIONS.
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN ANY 
CRITICAL INCIDENT THE OUTPOURING
OF SUPPORT FROM PRIVATE 
CITIZENS, CORPORATIONS AND 
EVERYBODY ELSE ASSOCIATED WITH 
CONCERN FOR THE VICTIMS IS 
OVERWHELMING AND WE APPRECIATE 
THAT, BUT IT COMES A POINT WHERE
WE CAN'T MANAGE IT.
NOW, THE RED CROSS IS UNABLE TO 
MANAGE IT.
WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE IT AT 
THE SUBSTATIONS, SO IF IT'S HARD
GOODS SUCH AS WATER OR CANNED 
GOODS OR STUFF THAT IS NOT -- 
WILL NOT BECOME PERISHABLE, 
THREE SQUARE AND CATHOLIC 
CHARITIES IS ACCEPTING THOSE 
DONATIONS.
SO WE ARE ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE 
THAT INFORMATION TO YOUR 
LISTENING PUBLIC AND TO ACCEPT 
DONATIONS AT THAT POINT.
SO AREAS OF -- LET ME GIVE YOU 
THE ADDRESSES FOR THOSE.
SO CATHOLIC CHARITIES IS 
OBVIOUSLY AT 1501 LAS VEGAS 
BOULEVARD NORTH AND THREE SQUARE
IS LOCATED AT 4190 NORTH PECOS 
ROAD.
AT THIS POINT I WILL ACQUIESCE 
TO COMMISSIONER SISOLAK AND HE 
WILL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE 
DONATION PHASE OF THIS AS FAR AS
VICTIM SATISFACTION AND THEN I 
WILL RETURN AND WE WILL CONDUCT 
A Q & A ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION.
COMMISSIONER. 
>> THANK YOU, SHERIFF.
WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE
TODAY TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF AN 
UPDATE ON WHERE WE STAND.
THE FUND THAT THE SHERIFF AND I 
SET UP YESTERDAY HAS NOW SU
SURPASSED 53,000 INDIVIDUAL 
DONATIONS IT'S IN EXCESS OF $3.7
MILLION AS WE SPEAK.
WE NEED A LOT MORE RESOURCES, WE
WILL NEED A LOT MORE MONEY, WE 
HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING 
TO NEED FUTURE SURGERIES AND 
HELP MOVING FORWARD.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A FEW 
SPECIAL INDIVIDUALS NOT INCLUDE 
IN THIS THAT TOTAL OF $3.7 
MILLION.
LAST NIGHT A PRIVATE CITIZEN 
CALLED THE SHERIFF AND I 
CONTRIBUTED $500,000 TO THE 
FUND.
THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT 
TOTAL THIS MORNING.
WAYNE AND KATHLEEN NEWTON CALLED
ME AND THEY HAVE DONATED 
$100,000.
THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT 
TOTAL.
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE
AND DON'T WANT TO DO IT ON GO 
FUND ME YOU CAN MAKE A CHECK TO 
LAS VEGAS VICTIMS FUND AND MAIL 
IT EITHER TO THE COUNTY OFFICE, 
TO MY OFFICE OR TO THE SHERIFF'S
OF
OFFICE, BUT I JUST GOT OFF THE 
PHONE WITH JIM MERN FROM MGM 
INTERNATIONAL AND THE SHERIFF 
AND I BOTH SPOKE TO JIM AND 
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE STEPPED UP 
IN AN ENORMOUS MATTER WITH THIS 
COMMUNITY AND EVERYTHING THAT 
THEY CONTINUE TO DO AND ON 
BEHALF OF MGM AND THEIR OVER 
50,000 EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE 
CONTRIBUTED $3 MILLION TO THIS 
FUND.
SO WE APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S 
SUPPORT, THE DONATIONS FROM $5 
TO NOW $3 MILLION AND THERE IS A
LOT OF NEED AND WE ARE GOING TO 
DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO
RAISE MONEY FOR EACH OF THESE 
INDIVIDUALS.
SO WE APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUING 
TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS, YOUR VIEWERS
AND READERS TO SUPPORT THE 
CAMPAIGN.
IT'S LAS VEGAS VICTIMS EITHER ON
GO FUND ME OR YOU CAN MAKE A 
CHECK TO LAS VEGAS VICTIMS FUND.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, SHERIFF.
>> WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE 
POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION CONCEPT.
WE'VE ALREADY GOT SOME 
INQUIRIES.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A FEW 
DAYS BEFORE WE CAN COORDINATE 
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE 
MONEY.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT 
THE MINOR PROPERTY LOSSES THAT 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE CALLED ON 
REGARDING, YOU KNOW, BACKPACKS 
AND SHOES AND PHONES, WE ARE 
LOOKING AT MORE MAJOR EXPENSES 
AS IT RELATES TO, YOU KNOW, 
SURGERIES, MEDICAL EXPENSES, 
FUNERAL EXPENSES, 
TRANSPORTATION, SO FORTH.
WE SHOULD HAVE MORE DETAILS WITH
YOU.
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE COUNTY
OFFICE AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
TO DEVELOP SOMETHING IN THE 
IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN TERMS OF 
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO, WHO THEY 
CAN CALL TO START DISTRIBUTING 
THE MONEY TO PEOPLE THAT ARE 
MOST DESPERATE.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
>> OKAY.
JUST A QUICK SYNOPSIS OR CURRENT
STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION.
I WON'T REITERATE WHAT WE 
DISCUSSED YESTERDAY IN PREVIOUS 
PRESS CONFERENCES.
BUT WE HAVE COMPLETED THE 
INVESTIGATION AT THE RENO 
PROPERTY AND I'M SURE THE 
QUESTION WILL BE PRESENTED WHAT 
WAS RECOVERED THERE.
SO IT WAS NUMEROUS ELECTRONIC 
ITEMS, ADDITIONALLY FIVE 
HANDGUNS AND TWO SHOTGUNS AND A 
PLETHORA OF AMMUNITION.
WE HAVE SERVED SEARCH WARRANTS 
AT THREE SEPARATE LOCATIONS THAT
WOULD BE THE ROOM AT THE 
MANDALAY BAY, THE MESQUITE 
LOCATION AND THE RENO LOCATION.
ADDITIONALLY, WE SERVED A SEARCH
WARRANT ON THE SUSPECT'S VEHICLE
LOCATED AT THE MANDALAY BAY.
SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY 
QUESTIONS.
>> SHERIFF. 
>> YES, SIR. 
>> CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE
MODIFICATIONS TO THE WEAPONS TO 
MAKE THEM AUTOMATIC.
BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT 
VIRGSS OF WHAT THAT COULD MEAN.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
>> THE QUESTION WAS WHAT ARE THE
MODIFICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE WEAPONRY.
ATF IS PARTICIPATING IN THAT 
EVALUATION.
I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ANSWER ON 
WHETHER ANY OF THEM ARE 
AUTOMATIC OR NOT, BUT WE ARE 
AWARE OF A DEVICE CALLED A BUMP 
STOCK AND THAT ENABLES AN 
INDIVIDUAL TO SPEED UP THE 
DISCHARGE OF AMMUNITION.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU ANY 
MORE DETAILS ON THAT, BUT IN 
PARTNER WITH THE FBI THE ATF, 
THEY ARE SENDING THOSE WEAPONS 
BACK EAST TO THE FBI CRIME LAB 
FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.
>> YES.
YES.
ABSOLUTELY. 
>> SHERIFF, THE GIRLFRIEND, HAS 
SHE GIVEN AUTHORITIES 
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT MOTIVE?
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THAT 
INFORMATION IS?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION
YET BUT I WILL ASSURE THE 
INVESTIGATION WITH HER IS 
ONGOING AND WE ANTICIPATE SOME 
INFORMATION FROM HER SHORTLY. 
>> YES, MA'AM. 
>> WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION IN 
REGARDS TO $100,000 TO THE 
PHILIPPINES . 
>> NO MA'AM, I DO NOT.
HERE YOU GO.
LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT.
THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION I 
DO KNOW.
OKAY?
BUT IT'S AN ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION AND WHEN I SAY I 
DO NOT KNOW I MAY KNOW, BUT -- 
BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN A 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION WE WANT 
TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED SAFETY 
OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT ALL 
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED AND
WE, I ASSURE YOU, THIS 
INVESTIGATION HAS NOT ENDED WITH
THE DEMISE OF MR. PADDOCK. 
>> SHERIFF. 
>> YES. 
>> COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE 
IF THERE IS AN UPDATE ON THE 
VICTIMS AND THE INJURIES AND 
ALSO IS THERE ANYTHING NEW 
 -- ARE YOU MAKING 
ANY PROGRAMS WITHOUT GETTING 
INTO SPECIFICS ARE YOU MAKING 
ANY PROGRESS INTO DETERMINING A 
MOTIVE?
>> NO, I WILL ANSWER YOUR LAST 
QUESTION FIRST.
NO.
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS, BUT I 
DON'T HAVE COMPLETE ANSWERS YET.
SO I ANTICIPATE A SUBSTANTIAL 
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO COME IN
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.
HOLD ON.
LET ME FINNISH THE REST OF IT.
AS FAR AS THE INJURIES, YOU 
KNOW, IT GOES ACROSS THE BOARD, 
CORONER COMMENTED ON THAT 
YESTERDAY.
WE HAVE TRAMPLED INJURIES, WE 
HAVE PEOPLE TRYING TO ESCAPE, 
INJURIES OF THEIR OWN DEVICE, WE
HAVE GUNSHOT WOUNDS.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT TOTAL TYPE
OF INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH ALL 
THE INJURIES AND THE PEOPLE THAT
DIED, IT GOES ACROSS THE BOARD.
I CAN'T GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE 
ASSOCIATED WITH GUNSHOT VERSUS 
OTHER TYPES OF INJURIES.
>> ARE THE NUMBERS 59 AND -- 
HAVE THOSE CHANGED OR ARE THEY 
STILL THE SAME. 
>> WE BELIEVE THE INJURY NUMBER 
WAS DECREASED SLIGHTLY AND WHEN 
I SAY SLIGHTLY, MAYBE 20, 
BECAUSE WE HAD A DOUBLE COUNT 
ERROR OCCURRING AT ONE OF THE 
HOSPITALS.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING CLOSE AND 
STILL IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE 
NUMBER I PROVIDED YOU.
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU HER CURRENT 
WHEREABOUTS RIGHT NOW, ALL I 
KNOW IS THE PHILIPPINES AND WE 
ARE IN CONVERSATION.
>> IS SHE A SUSPECT?
>> CURRENTLY SHE IS A PERSON OF 
INTEREST.
>> THE GIRLFRIEND.
>> SHERIFF. 
>> YES, MA'AM. 
>> THE DAILY MAIL HAS RELEASED 
PHOTOS THAT SHOW THE MOTEL ROOM 
AFTER THE S.W.A.T. TEAM ENTERED 
AND IT SHOWED GUNS AND 
AMMUNITION THAT MANY OUTLETS ARE
DISSEMINATING, CAN YOU VERIFY 
THE LEGITIMACY OF THOSE PHOTOS. 
>> I CAN'T VERIFY WHETHER THEY 
ARE LEGITIMATE OR NOT.
I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE TROUBLED 
BY T WE HAVE AN INTERNAL 
INVESTIGATION OCCURRING AS WE 
SPEAK ON HOW THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS 
WERE OBTAINED BY THE PUBLIC 
FORUM. 
>> SHERIFF, CAN YOU TALK, THEN, 
TO WHAT WAS FOUND INSIDE THAT 
HOTEL ROOM THAT THE GUNMAN USED,
SPECIFICALLY CBS NEWS IS 
REPORTING THAT THERE WAS A 
CAMERA INSIDE THAT ROOM.
WAS THE GUNMAN RECORDING?
WAS THE GUNMAN TRANSMITTING THAT
VIDEO ANYWHERE ELSE?
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 
TRANSMISSION BUT THERE WAS 
CAMERAS.
THERE WAS CAMERAS LOCATED 
OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM AND INSIDE 
OF THE ROOM ALONG WITH THE 
FIREARMS. 
>> AND HE HAD SET UP HOW MANY 
CAMERAS?
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
SPECIFIC NUMBERS. 
>> 
>> I ANTICIPATE HE WAS LOOKING 
FOR ANYBODY COMING TO TAKE HIM 
INTO CUSTODY.
>> SO YOU HAVE A RECORD OF HIM 
CARRYING OUT THIS CARNAGE?
>> NO, THAT'S NOT ESSENTIALLY 
WHAT I'M SAYING.
THAT IS BEING EVALUATED.
THE FBI TOOK ALL DIGITAL AND 
ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE INTO CUSTODY
AND WE ARE EVALUATING.
>> DO WE KNOW IF THIS MAN WAS 
TARGETING THIS PARTICULAR EVENT 
OR DID HE HAVE IN MIND PERHAPS 
ANOTHER EVENT IN THE LAS VEGAS 
AREA AS A POSSIBLE TARGET?
>> NO, WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THAT
YET.
I WILL PROVIDE YOU THAT 
INFORMATION AT A LATER DATE. 
>> TO FOLLOW ON THAT, THERE IS A
REPORT THAT HE MAY HAVE INTENDED
TO TARGET THE . 
>> WE ARE UNABLE TO CONFIRM 
THAT. 
>> A WEEK BEFORE. 
>> WE ARE UNABLE TO CONFIRM 
THAT.
>> WHAT'S THE CLARITY?
WHAT'S THE CLARITY YOU'RE 
SEEKING?
>> WHAT TIME THE SHOTS RANG OUT,
WHAT TIME YOU RECEIVED THE 
CALL -- 
>> WE RECEIVED A CALL AT 10:08 
P.M.
THE BEST OF OUR ESTIMATES AND 
VIDEO REVIEW HE CONTINUED TO 
FIRE AT A PROGRESSIVE SUCCESSIVE
RATE FOR APPROXIMATELY NINE 
MINUTES.
AS YOU CAN SEE BY ANY VIDEO YOU 
SEE IN THE PUBLIC SPACE IT WAS 
HARD TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY 
WERE COMING FROM.
ONCE IT WAS EVALUATED IT WAS 
COMING FROM THE MANDALAY BAY, AS
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT 
WOULD BE TO PINPOINT THE ROOM 
FROM THE OUTSIDE.
OFFICERS SUBSEQUENTLY FORMED UP,
TEAMED UP AND MOVED OVER TO THE 
MANDALAY BAY TO -- IN ORDER TO 
LOCATE AND ENGAGE, BUT THAT WAS 
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANDALAY
BAY SECURITY.
NOW, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THE MANDALAY BAY SECURITY WAS 
FANTASTIC.
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ASSUMING 
THAT THEY ARE UNSAFE BY, YOU 
KNOW, STAYING AT ONE OF OUR 
HOTELS.
WE WOULD NOT HAVE ENGAGED THIS 
INDIVIDUAL IN THE TIME LAPSE 
THAT WE DID WITHOUT THEIR 
ASSISTANCE.
WE RECEIVED INFORMATION VIA 
THEIR DISPATCH CENTER AND OR 
THEIR OPERATIONS CENTER, THEIR 
CALL CENTER FROM INDIVIDUALS 
STAYING WITHIN THE MANDALAY BAY 
THAT HELPED US LOCATE WHERE THIS
INDIVIDUAL WAS SEQUESTERED.
HOLD ON.
I WANT TO FINNISH HER QUESTION.
ALL RIGHT?
AND SO SUBSEQUENTLY THAT TAKES 
TIME AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MOVING 
FROM THE LOCATION OF THE EVENT, 
DEE NIEGD WHETHER YOU ARE GOING 
TO HELP VICTIMS EVACUATE OR YOU 
ARE GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU 
ARE GOING TO TAKE CHARGE AND PUT
AN ELEMENT TOGETHER AND GO 
ENGAGE THIS INDIVIDUAL.
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF BIFURCATION 
OF RESPONSIBILITIES ASSOCIATED, 
ESPECIALLY IN A DYNAMIC EVENT.
I WANT TO SAY KUDOS TO THOSE 
OFFICERS THAT GOT TOGETHER AND 
SAID THIS IS WHAT WE TRAINED 
FOR, ACTIVE SHOOTER, WE'RE 
PUTTING AN ELEMENT TOGETHER, 
LET'S GO ENGAGE THIS INDIVIDUAL 
AND LOCATE THEM.
OKAY?
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
AND WHEN THE SECURITY OFFICER 
WAS ENGAGED BY THE SUSPECT, WE 
BACKED OFF FROM IMMEDIATE 
APPREHENSION AND S.W.A.T. TEAM 
FORMED AND MADE ENTRY. 
>> WHAT TIME WAS THE SECURITY 
OFFICER ENGAGED?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT TIME FOR 
YOU. 
>> SHERIFF, HOW CONCERNED ARE 
YOU ABOUT YOUR OFFICERS FACING 
WEAPONS LIKE THIS?
>> ABSOLUTELY CONCERNED.
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND, YOU 
KNOW, WHO WOULD HAVE EVER 
IMAGINED THIS SITUATION?
I COULDN'T IMAGINE IT.
AND FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE 
IT UPON HIMSELF TO CREATE THIS 
CHAOS AND HARM IS UNSPEAKABLE.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO TRY TO 
SPITBALL OR WHAT IF THESE 
SITUATIONS AT ALL POINTS WHEN WE
TRAIN AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE 
PROPER RESPONSE AND I THINK WE 
DID A FANTASTIC JOB. 
>> MANDALAY BAY SECURITY 
IDENTIFIED THE ROOM BEFORE 
S.W.A.T. ARRIVED?
>> NO.
WELL, YEAH, BEFORE S.W.A.T. 
ARRIVED, BUT NOT BEFORE MY 
OFFICERS ARRIVED.
THEY WERE MARRIED OR HAND TO 
HAND WITH MY OFFICERS WHEN WE 
MADE ENTRY OVER TO THE HOTEL AND
IT WAS A MATTER OF -- IF YOU 
RECALL YESTERDAY I SAID BETWEEN 
FLOOR 29 AND 32 AND DURING THAT 
PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE FLOORS
WE RECEIVED ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION WHERE HE WAS LOCATED
AND THEY IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED. 
>> WHAT TIME DID S.W.A.T. BREACH
HIS SUITE?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER FOR 
YOU. 
>> DID HE CONTINUE TO SHOOT 
UNTIL THE SITUATE TEAM CAME IN 
OR WHY DID HE STOP SHOOTING?
>> THAT'S FOR US TO EVALUATE IN 
THE INVESTIGATION.
>> NO, THEY WERE THROUGHOUT THE 
VENUE, THEY EVEN HAD SOME 
VICTIMS WHO MET THEIR DEMISE 
OUTSIDE OF THE VENUE AND THEN WE
HAD INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN 
SHOT AND THEY CONTINUED TO RUN 
AWAY AND THEN THEY PASSED AWAY 
SEVERAL BLOCKS FROM THE VENUE.
WE ALSO HAD VERY HEROIC ACTS OF 
PEOPLE ATTENDING THE EVENT, WE 
HAVE NUMEROUS VIDEOS DEPICTING 
PEOPLE ATTENDING, NORMAL 
CITIZENS, PROVIDING MEDICAL AID 
AND PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION FOR
VICTIMS TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL. 
>> SHERIFF. 
>> YES, SIR.
>> GOING BACK TO THE POINT OF MY
COLLEAGUE THAT THERE BEING A 
CAMERA IN THE ROOM, I'M SORRY IF
I'M INTERPRETING THIS WRONGLY, 
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE HAD SET THOSE 
SAM
CAMERAS UP TO GIVE HIMSELF A 
WARNING OF THE APPROACH OF 
POLICE OFFICERS.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IN 
THE MIND OF A MADMAN, HOW WOULD 
YOU JOURNAL THIS MAN'S 
PREPARATION AND DETERMINATION TO
DO THIS BASED ON -- 
>> I DON'T EVEN NEED THAT BIT OF
INFORMATION TO MAKE A JUDGMENT.
THIS INDIVIDUAL IS PREMEDICATED,
OBVIOUSLY PREMEDICATED.
THE FACT THAT HE HAD THE TYPE OF
WEAPONRY AND THE AMOUNT OF 
WEAPONRY IN THE ROOM, IT WAS 
PREPLANNED, EXTENSIVELY AND I'M 
PRETTY SURE HE EVALUATED 
EVERYTHING THAT HE DID IN HIS 
ACTIONS.
WHICH IS TROUBLESOME.
I WAS HOPING -- YOU KNOW, I PRAY
THAT IN THESE SITUATIONS THAT A 
CITIZEN -- BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE 
AT ALL PLACES AT ALL TIMES -- 
THAT A CITIZEN SEES SOMETHING, 
SAYS SOMETHING AND WE ACT ON 
THAT.
QUITE OFTEN WHAT WE EXPERIENCE 
IN OUR LINE OF WORK A CITIZEN 
THINKS IT'S TRIVIAL AND THEY 
SAY, NO, I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER 
THE POLICE.
WITH HE ASK YOU TO BOTHER THE 
POLICE BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS
ESPECIALLY HOUSEKEEPING TYPE 
INDIVIDUALS OR ANY CAB DRIVERS, 
ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC SPACE THAT
CAN ASSIST US WE ASK THEM TO. 
>> SHERIFF, DO YOU KNOW IF HIS 
GIRLFRIEND HAS ANY KNOWLEDGE -- 
>> RICARDO. 
>> DID POLICE OR SECURITY GUARDS
FIRE ANY SHOTS AT ANY TIME 
DURING THE ENCOUNTER?
>> DURING WHILE HE WAS DIS
DISCHARGING HIS WEAPONS WE ARE 
NOT AWARE OF THAT.
NO SECURITY GUARD OR POLICE 
OTHER THAN THE ENCOUNTER AT THE 
ROOM. 
>> CAN YOU EXPAND ON WHAT WENT 
RIGHT.
I KNOW YOU PRACTICE FOR 
SCENARIOS LIKE THIS, NOT EXACTLY
THIS SCENARIO.
CAN YOU EXPAND ON WHAT WENT 
RIGHT?
>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT, 
RICARDO, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
PEOPLE HAVE THE ASSUMPTION 
THINGS WENT WRONG IN THIS TYPE 
OF CARNAGE BUT WHAT WENT RIGHT 
IS WE SAVED HUNDREDS OF LIVES.
IN AN EVENT AND THIS GUY HAVING 
THE ABILITY WITH THOSE WEAPONRY,
THE CARNAGE THAT COULD OCCUR 
OUTSIDE OF WHAT DID OCCUR, A LOT
MORE WAS PREVENTED BECAUSE OF 
OUR POLICE ACTION IN SHORT TIME 
AND PRIVATE SECURITY ACTION IN 
SHORT TIME TO SAVE SOME LIVES.
>> WITH ALL OF THIS IN THE ROOM,
THE CAMERAS NOW, THE GUNS, 
EVERYTHING ELSE YESTERDAY YOU 
HAD SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN 
HOTEL STAFF INSIDE THAT ROOM 
DURING THAT STAY, IS THAT STILL 
BELIEVED, DID HE TURN AWAY 
HOUSEKEEPING?
>> THE ONLY THING I KNOW AT THIS
POINT IS ROOM SERVICE WAS 
PROVIDED. 
>> SHERIFF, COULD I ASK YOU -- 
I'M SORRY IT'S A POINT I WANT TO
CLARIFY -- DO YOU BELIEVE YOU 
ARE GOING TO FIND THE MOTIVE FOR
THIS CRIME?
>> I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT. 
>> THE GIRLFRIEND, DO YOU KNOW 
WHERE SHE IS?
>> YES, I DO. 
>> WHY IS FBI NOT TRYING TO 
BRING HER BACK?
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT 
OCCURRING?
>> I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M 
ASKING.
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
>> THAT IS OCCURRING.
YES, MA'AM. 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING 
THIS NONSTOP FOR THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS, HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR 
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM?
>> I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED THAT.
NO, I AM.
I'M NOT BEING SARCASTIC.
WE'RE DOING GOOD.
I'M ACTUALLY VERY PROUD OF OUR 
PEOPLE.
I MEAN, THIS GUY HERE IS THE 
LOCAL SAC, AARON ROUSE IN CHARGE
OF THE FBI.
YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT GREG 
CASSEL TALKED ABOUT THIS 
YESTERDAY THE CHIEF OF THE CLARK
COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT.
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THIS 
JURISDICTION HAS THE BEST 
PARTNERSHIPS I BELIEVE IN THE 
UNITED STATES AS FAR AS PUBLIC 
SAFETY.
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE DID AS YOU 
DESCRIBED IN THE LAST 48 HOURS 
WITHOUT THAT PARTNERSHIP.
THE FBI STEPPING TO THE PLATE TO
HELP US WITH EVIDENCE, 
DOCUMENTATION AND PROSECUTION --
>> PRIDE FROM SHERIFF JOSEPH 
LOMBARDO SAYING THAT HIS TEAM 
SAVED HUNDREDS OF LIVES PERHAPS 
DURING THAT SHOOTING IN LAS 
VEGAS JUST TWO NIGHTS AGO.
ALSO SAYS HE IS FRANKLY WORRIED 
ABOUT HIS PEOPLE SAYING THE 
WORLD HAS CHANGED, SOME NEWS IN 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE AS WELL, 
THE SHERIFF SAYING THAT THE 
INJURIES, THE INJURY COUNT, HAS 
GONE DOWN BY ABOUT 20, THERE WAS
SOME DOUBLE COUNTING AT ONE OF 
THE HOSPITALS.
ALSO MORE ON SAN BERTEPHEN PADDD
THE ARSENAL HE COVERED.
I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 
THOMAS.
PIERRE, A COUPLE THINGS THERE 
FROM THE SHERIFF.
NUMBER ONE, HE SAID HE COULDN'T 
BE SURE THAT THERE WAS AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS BUT HE HAD THOSE BUMP 
STOCKS WHICH CAN CONVERT A 
SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON INTO AN 
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
ALSO CONFIRMING THERE ARE 
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM. 
>> HE IS CONFIRMING SOME OF THE 
CRITICAL FACTS WE'VE BEEN 
REPORTING.
THE BUMP STOCKS ALLOW AN ASSAULT
RIFLE TO FUNCTION ALMOST LIKE A 
MACHINE GUN, THE AMOUNT OF 
BULLETS THAT COME OUT THEY COME 
OUT SO MUCH MORE QUICKLY.
ALSO WE HAVE REPORTING TONIGHT 
THAT THE SUSPECT HAD A CAMERA 
OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM AS WELL AS 
THE INFORMATION THAT WE BROKE 
YESTERDAY ABOUT A CAMERA BEING 
INSIDE THE ROOM.
THE CAMERA OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM 
ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED THE SUSPECT TO MONITOR 
POLICE POTENTIALLY AS THEY WERE 
APPROACHING. 
>> YEAH. 
>> ONE SOURCE SAID THEY'VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN TERMS
OF THE PLANNING AND THE 
METICULOUS PLANNING INVOLVED. 
>> HE COULD SEE WHEN THEY WERE 
COMING, HOW MUCH TIME HE HAD, 
BRIAN ROSS, LOTS OF QUESTIONS AS
WELL ABOUT THE ROOMMATE, MARILOU
DANLEY, SHERIFF SAYING SHE IS 
STILL IN THE PHILIPPINES, THEY 
HOPE TO GET MORE INFORMATION 
FROM HER SOON.
MOST INTERESTINGLY ASKED IF SHE 
IS A SUSPECT HE SAID CURRENTLY A
PERSON OF INTEREST. 
>> THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE 
FROM BEING JUST A HELPFUL 
WITNESS.
SHE IS LABELED NOW A PERSON OF 
INTEREST WHICH IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TERMS MEANS SHE IS 
NOT QUITE A SUSPECT BUT SHE IS 
NOT OFF THE HOOK, EITHER, 
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE 
DISCOVERY OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN 
THE HOME THEY SHARED IN 
MESQUITE, NEVADA, AND THE 
EXPLOSIVES AND AMMUNITION ALL 
RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW COULD 
SHE NOT KNOW SOMETHING WAS GOING
ON. 
>> MATT GUTMAN, THE QUESTIONS 
ALSO ABOUT THOSE FINAL 48 HOURS 
AND THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IF THAT 
CAMERA ACTUALLY CAPTURED THE 
SHOOTING ITSELF.
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW THAT 
JUST YET, GEORGE, THE FBI HAS 
POSSESSION OF THOSE TAPES, THEY 
ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO DO A VERY
THOROUGH FORENSIC CHECK OVER 
THEM, BUT ONE INTERESTING TIDBIT
THAT WE SAW FROM SOME OF THESE 
NEW IMAGES THAT WE PUT OUT FROM 
THAT ROOM OR JUST OUTSIDE THE 
ROOM IS THAT HE WAS, IN FACT, 
USING ROOM SERVICE.
SO THE NOTION IS THAT HE HAD 
SHUT HIMSELF INTO THAT ROOM FOR 
A COUPLE OF DAYS, WE DO KNOW 
THAT IT HAD BEEN SERVICED A 
COUPLE OF TIMES.
THE QUESTION IS HOW WAS HE ABLE 
TO CONCEAL THAT MASS AMOUNT OF 
WEAPONRY, MORE THAN 20 WEAPONS, 
THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF 
AMMUNITION FROM THE PEOPLE WHO 
WERE COMING IN AND OUT OF THE 
ROOM AND HOW COME NOBODY FOUND 
HIM OUT.
I KNOW THE SHERIFF LOMBARDO 
COMMENDED THE WORK OF SECURITY 
AT MANDALAY BAY, BUT THESE ARE 
STILL QUESTIONS THAT THIS 
INVESTIGATION IS REALLY GOING TO
HAVE TO LOOK INTO, GEORGE. 
>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
ALL OF YOU WILL BE JOINING DAVID
MUIR IN LAS VEGAS FOR A SPECIAL 
EDITION TONIGHT.
