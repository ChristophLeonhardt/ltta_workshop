I have a serious question do you feel bad for Milan no you do not mm-hmm I don't either what I don't like though is when people express how bad they feel for Milani like yeah she signed up yeah you made your bed yeah completely and then you never had to make your bed again and hopefully you sleep in a different bed you know what I don't like hmm look I understood your your bed analogy there the thing I don't like is have your cake and eat it too why not I just don't like have your cake is weird because when you eat you're having cake so you're eating your own cake do you know what that I'm actually now I'm second-guessing my understanding of that may I have your cake and eat it too right that's stupid I don't have my cake cuz I didn't eat it but like what we not I don't under cake what once you eat your cake you don't have kit you don't have your cake anymore right but like you want to have your cake but you also want to eat it right out that you need to also get are you not allowed to have your own cake no no having can't you got to forget the eating cake and having cake are synonymous in your parlance so that's a big word you want a possess cake yeah and eat cake at the same time yes knowing that if you eat your cake we won't possess your cake
