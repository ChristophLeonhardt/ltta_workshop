LAURA INGRAHAM TAKES IT AWAY. Laura: SEAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FANTASTIC TRIBUTE. I'M LAURA INGRAHAM. THIS IS "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE." AS SEAN JUST MENTIONED, OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY HERE AT FOX AND OF COURSE, THE SAD NEWS, CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, BELOVED COLUMNIST, FATHER, HUSBAND, OF COURSE, CONTRIBUTED A FOX NEWS, PULITZER PRIZE WINNER, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR DIED TODAY AT AGE 68. HIS DEATH WAS A SHOCK BUT WAS NOT UNEXPECTED. HE TOLD US TWO WEEKS AGO THAT HE HAD TERMINAL CANCER AND NOT TOO LONG TO LIVE. CHARLES BECAME A LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE DURING HIS DECADE AT FOX NEWS. HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED POLITICAL ANALYSTS IN WASHINGTON, I THINK IN THE UNITED STATES, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, AND A BELOVED PRESENCE IN THE NEWSROOM HERE. CHARLES WAS ULTIMATELY LOST FOR WORDS BUT HE OFTEN PUT OTHERS IN THAT POSITION, AS I KNOW PERSONALLY. IT WAS HIS HUMOR, I THINK, THAT A LOT OF US, AS WE SMILED TONIGHT REMEMBERING HIM, OR THINKING ABOUT TONIGHT. ALL KINDS OF FOLKS, FOR THE LAST YEAR, AND THE END, HILLARY'S NOT GOING TO RUN. I SAID 100%, SHE WOULD RUN, UNLESS SHE IS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. THERE IS NO LIGHTNING. I THINK THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO GET IN, AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET OUT UNLESS THEY ARE BEATEN. SPEAKING AS AN AMATEUR PSYCHIATRIST. SO WHAT IF YOU LOOK LIKE A LUCKY LUCIANO? IT DOESN'T MATTER TO US AT ALL. THAT IS DRAWN FOR ME. I THINK HE WAS CALLING ME. HE WAS DEFINITELY CALLING YOU. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND A SOCIALIST? A DEMOCRAT IS A SOCIALIST ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE THEY DID? NO, NO. I SAID HERE A WEEK AGO THAT IT WILL SNOW AND IN HELL BEF IT WILL SNOW AND IN HELL BER IT WILL SNOW AND IN HELL BE IT WILL SNOW AND IN HELL BEH IT WILL SNOW AND IN HELL BEE OBAMA DOJ INDICTS HILLARY. I'M WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A BELIEF IN CLIMATE CHANGE BEFORE THAT. Laura: MUST BRING IN OUR DISTINGUISHED PANEL DISCUSSES LIFE AND CAREER. ON THE PHONE WITH US, "SPECIAL REPORT" ANCHOR, BRET BAIER. IN THE STUDIO, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST BRIT HUME, ASSOCIATE EDITOR AND COLUMNIST AT REALCLEARPOLITICS, A.B. STODDARD, AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR CHARLIE HURT, OPINION EDITOR FOR "THE WASHINGTON TIMES." BOY, ALL OF US HAVE SO MANY MEMORIES OF CHARLES. BEFORE WE GO TO THE PANEL HERE, BRET, YOU SAT IN THE SEAT SO MANY NIGHTS, AS DID BRIT HUME, WITH CHARLES TO YOUR RIGHT, AND IT WAS ALWAYS A ROLLICKING RIDE. AND COMMERCIAL BREAKS, WHERE ALL THE FUN USUALLY HAPPENS, AND IN THE ONLINE SPECIAL SHOW, WHERE CHARLES WAS EVEN FUNNIER THAT HE WAS ON THE PANEL. SOME REFLECTIONS TONIGHT? YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT IS A BITTERSWEET MOMENT BECAUSE I LIKE LOOKING BACK AT THOSE MOMENTS, AND THE FUN AND HUMOR. I JUST TALKED TO DANIEL, WHO WAS AT HIS DAD'S SIDE, ALONG WITH HIS WIFE, ROBYN, AND THEY'VE BEEN HEARTENED BY SOME OF THESE MEMORIES AND SOME OF THE STORIES, AND LOOKING AT THEIR DAD AND HIS PRIME, CHARLES COULD LIGHT UP A ROOM. HE COULD CRACK A JOKE. HE WAS MY FIRST BASEMAN THEY ARE ON THE PANEL FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS. BEFORE THAT, ALONGSIDE BRIT HUME BEFORE THAT, ALONGSIDE BRIT HUM BRIT HUME. HE COULD CUT THROUGH THE NOISE OF THE DAY, AND THEN CRACK US UP IN THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS LIKE NOBODY ELSE COULD. SO HE JUST HAD A GIFT. HIS WRITING WAS ON LIKE I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE ANOTHER COLUMNIST THAT HAD HIS PENETRATING KIND OF WISDOM AND THOUGHTS AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO USE THAT AS WE GO ON, BECAUSE HE'S COMMENTED ON EVERY ISSUE ON THE DAY. AND WE'LL BRING HIM INTO THE CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD. Laura: BRIT HUME. WE'VE KNOWN THIS WAS COMING FOR SOME WEEKS NOW. IT BARELY LESSENS THE SADNESS OF THIS MOMENT. BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS, CHARLES HAD A CHANCE, IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF HIS LIFE, TO HEAR HOW WE ALL FELT ABOUT HIM. THE KIND OF TRIBUTE YOU JUST HEARD FROM BRET, WHAT THE REST OF US HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL DAY, IT WASN'T THAT HE WAS JUST SO BRILLIANT, ALTHOUGH HE WAS, HE WAS ALSO SO VERY KIND AND FUNNY, AND WE LOVED HIM. ALL OF US AROUND HERE LOVED HIM. THOSE OF US WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERED BIG SHOTS LOVED HIM, EVERYBODY IS LOVE HIM, AS WELL. I HOPE YOU KNEW THAT, I SUSPECT HE DID, AND I'M GLAD HE DID FOR THAT. Laura: EVERYONE FROM THE MAKEUP ARTISTS, THE GUYS BEHIND THE CAMERA WHO DO SUCH GOOD WORK, AND WOMEN BEHIND THE SCENES, EVERYONE KNEW HIM. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY, THOUGH, THAN ANYONE ELSE. YOU POINTED THAT OUT. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE BRAKES, BACK IN THE DAY, "SPECIAL REPORT, CHARLES WAS ON, HE WOULD COME IN EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE WHEELCHAIR, IT TOOK HIM EARLIER TO GET INTO POSITION, WHICH MEANT THAT THEY WERE TWO COMMERCIAL BREAKS BEFORE THE TIME, THAT I GOT TO SPEND WITH CHARLES. EVERY NOW AND THEN, HE WOULD SAY, A KIND WORD TO ME ABOUT MY WORK. I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THE EARTH AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS AND IT HAD JUST BEEN CONFERRED UPON ME WHEN I GOT A COMPLIMENT FROM CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. Laura: A.B., THERE WAS A MOMENT ON "THE DAILY SHOW" THAT I HAD NOT SEEN UNTIL JUST BEFORE THIS SHOW TONIGHT. I WOULD LIKE YOUR REACTION AND THOUGHTS. LET'S WATCH. 30 YEARS. DO YOU EVER LOOK BACK ON SOME OF THESE WRITINGS AND THINK, WHAT WAS I THINKING? IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. GOOD FOR YOU TO SPEAK OFT GOOD FOR YOU TO SPEAK OFE WORST PART OF WRITING THE BOOK WAS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK AND READING THE MILLION WORDS I'VE WRITTEN, COULDN'T BELIEVE I HAD WRITTEN SOME OF THAT STUFF. WHAT HAS THE GROWTH PROCESS BEEN LIKE? THE GROWTH PROCESS, WELL, I WAS ONCE A LIBERAL. SO THE EARLY WRITINGS SHOWED HOPE. AND THEN CAME CHANGE. Laura: I MEAN, A.B., YOU SAT NEXT TO HIM ON SO MANY EVENINGS. JUST BRILLIANT. I WROTE ABOUT HIM LAST WEEKEND I SAID THAT THE ONLY DEBATE THAT I EVER WON IN NINE YEARS WAS ON THE SUPER COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS A DEBT CUTTING COMMITTEE, WHICH FELL FLAT ON ITS FACE, HE WROTE WITH GREAT HOPE ABOUT HOW IT ALL MIGHT WORK OUT. IT WAS REALLY GOING TO BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WHEN I BUSTED HIM ABOUT IT, WHEN IT FOLDED, HE SAID THAT WAS ONE OF THE TIMES WHERE I WASN'T CYNICAL ENOUGH. HE WAS NEVER WRONG. HIS PREDICTION DIDN'T COME TRUE. USUALLY BECAUSE HE HASN'T BEEN CYNICAL ENOUGH. BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS SO CYNICAL, HE WAS ALSO ALWAYS FULL OF HOPE AND JOY. AND HE REALLY DELIGHTED IN THE LITTLE THINGS, AND THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION, SO STOIC, SO STRONG, BECAUSE OF HIS BATTLE, AND WHAT HE HAD TO SURMOUNT IN THE WAKE OF IT. BUT THEN, JUST AS SOMEONE WHO REALLY DELIGHTED IN THE WARMTH AND EXCHANGE OF PEOPLE. HE LOVED PEOPLE. WE HAD A NIGHT RIGHT HERE AT THE TABLE, I'LL NEVER FORGET, EARLY ON WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL, AND I WAS SEATED IN BETWEEN HIM AND STEVE AND BRET ARE MAKING SOME COLLEGE OVER DRINKING JOKES, AND CHARLES SAID, THAT COMMERCIAL ALWAYS SAYS TO ME, THE ONLY BEER TO HAVE WHEN YOU ARE HAVING MORE THAN ONE. THEN HE PAUSED PERFECTLY TIMED, MORE THAN ONE WHAT? AND THEN OF COURSE, IT WAS RIGHT BACK TO THE PANEL, AND WE WERE BACK ON CAMERA, AND I WAS PRACTICALLY UNDER THE TABLE. HIS COMEDIC TIMING WAS UNBELIEVABLE. ALSO, SOMETIMES, JUST HAD THE DELIGHT OF A SMALL KID. IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO BEHOLD. Laura: PSYCHIATRIST, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, PULITZER PRIZE, MORE AWARDS THAN WE CAN LIST HERE. BUT CHARLES, WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT A POLITICAL MOVEMENT OR EVENT, HE WROTE ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT HE CUT THROUGH WHERE SO MANY OTHERS WERE MIRED IN MINUTIA. PRESIDENT REAGAN, I LOVED THIS PART, OF COURSE THIS WAS AFTER REAGAN'S DEATH. HE WROTE, "OPTIMISM IS OF THE PERFECT WAY TO TRIVIALIZE EVERYTHING THAT REAGAN WAS ORDERED. OPTIMISM, EVERY OTHER PERSON ON THE NUMBER SIX BUS IS AN OPTIMIST. WHAT DISTINGUISHED REAGAN WAS WHAT HE DID AND SAID. REAGAN WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA BY THE CYNICISM AND GENERAL RETREAT OF OF THE POST-VIETNAM ERA BECAUSE HE BELIEVED ON FASHIONABLY THAT AMERICA WAS BOTH GREAT AND GOOD." I LOVE THAT. LIKE AN OLD UNCLE, REAGAN IS SO OPTIMISTIC, BUT IT WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF AMERICA. I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE POINTED THAT OUT. HE WAS ALWAYS CUTTING AGAINST THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM. THAT AND OF ITSELF IS THE OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF AMERICA. OF COURSE, I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING CHARLES FAR LESS THAN ANYBODY SITTING AT THIS TABLE, BUT I REMEMBER BEING A YOUNGER BOY, GROWING UP IN A SMALL TOWN, AND WE GOT "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND I REMEMBER MY FATHER WOULD RIP OUT HIS COLUMNS AND SEND THEM TO ME, GIVE THEM TO ME, AND THAT HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON MY INTEREST IN NEWSPAPERS, AND OBVIOUSLY POLITICS. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY BRILLIANT, FUNNY, ALL OF THESE THINGS PRAY THAT THE TITLE OF HIS BOOK, "THINGS THAT MATTER," WAS THE MOST PERFECT TITLE OF A BOOK FOR HIM, BECAUSE WHAT HE DID BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS TO CUT THROUGH ALL THE NOISE AND PUT EVERYTHING INTO PERSPECTIVE, WITH THE THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT, AND THE THINGS THAT MATTERED. THAT BOOK WAS A COLLECTION. COLLECTIONS DON'T SELL. Laura: IT WAS ON THE BEST SELLER LIST FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. THAT SOLD LIKE HOT CAKES FOR YEARS. I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING IT. I GOT A COPY OF IT. I WAS ON THE TRAIN COMING FROM NEW YORK YESTERDAY, THERE WAS A GUY SITTING THERE READING THAT BOOK. Laura: I WANT TO MENTION BRET'S SPECIAL, PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THAT HOUR AND SIT DOWN, IT IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING. TOMORROW NIGHT, 9:00 P.M. ON FOX NEWS, I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT. I'VE SEEN BITS AND PIECES, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE THING. BRET, THE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, ELECTION NIGHT, PRIMARY NIGHT, KRAUTHAMMER WAS TOUGH ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO VERY FAIR. HE AND I GOT INTO SOME LEGENDARY BATTLES ON THE PANEL IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION, WITH GEORGE WILL, HIS BEST FRIEND, AND IT WAS A SPIRITED DEBATE, WAS ALWAYS SO MUCH FUN, THERE. HE WAS SUCH A GREAT SPARRING PARTNER ON THE ISSUE OF RISING POPULISM VERSUS THE OLD BUSH GLOBALISM, INTERVENTIONISM. HE LOVED THE PHILOSOPHICAL BACK AND FORTH THAT I THINK MAKES "SPECIAL REPORT" SUCH AN IMPORTANT SHOW TO HAVE FEATURED HIM. I KNOW BRIT HUME WAS THE FIRST ONE TO REALLY PUT HIM ON THE SHOW, AND THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE ON THAT PANEL. HE REALLY I KNOW YOU'VE MISSED HIM SINCE, WE'VE ALL MISSED HIM HERE AT FOX. YEAH. HE REALLY WAS A POWERHOUSE. HE LOVED GETTING INTO THE POLITICS. HE LOVED ENGAGING WITH YOU AND TUCKER AND OTHERS ON THE ISSUES OF THE DAY POLITICALLY OF THE DAY POLITICALLY P OF THE DAY POLITICALLY L OF THE DAY POLITICALLY T OF THE DAY POLITICALLY C OF THE DAY POLITICALLY L OF THE DAY POLITICALLY I OF THE DAY POLITICALLY E OF THE DAY POLITICALLY . I TRIED TO GET PANELISTS TO PUT CHIPS AND BETS ON POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. WE HAD 17 IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS, REPUBLICANS. SO HE DID NOT PUT ANY MONEY ON TRUMP AND EVENTUALLY, HE WAS BEGRUDGINGLY PUTTING FIVE AND TEN, AND HE WAS WOULD ALWAYS TEN, AND HE WAS WOULD ALWAYP TEN, AND HE WAS WOULD ALWAYT TEN, AND HE WAS WOULD ALWAYA FIVE CHIP ON ONE WOMEN IN ZONE, AND HE JUST HAD A GREAT TIME WITH IT. HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO I THINK TOUCHED PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT, EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM, YOU KIND OF NODDED YOUR HEAD AND SAID, ALL RIGHT, I GET THAT. Laura: BRIT, TRUMP, WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE BIG IMMIGRATION DEBATE, SEPARATING THE FAMILIES, I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT KRAUTHAMMER WOULD BE SAYING. ME, TOO. Laura: WHAT WOULD HE SAY ABOUT THE NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP ISSUE? HE WAS OFFENDED BY TRUMP. IN ANY WAY. Laura: LET'S BE HONEST, HE THOUGHT, AS DOES GEORGE WILL, TRUMP IS A HORRIBLE BULGARIAN. HE DID BELIEVE THAT. LET'S BE HONEST. HE THOUGHT HE WAS IGNORANT AND ADVANTAGEOUS. Laura: NO LOVE LOST. ONCE TRUMP WAS NOMINATED AND BECAME PRESIDENT, I THINK CHARLES, LIKE SOME OF THE REST OF US, WAS DEEPLY OFFENDED BY THE COVERAGE OF HIM. HE WAS VERY FAIR TO TRUMP DURING THE COURSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY, FOR AS LONG AS CHARLES WAS ABLE TO WITNESS IT, A YEAR BEFORE WE LOST THEM TO THIS TERRIBLE ILLNESS. Laura: HE HAD A COLUMN IN 2011, A.B., CALLED "ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE," ONE OF THE COLUMNS, USING THE TITLE, YOU GOT TO READ IT. I WENT BACK AND READ IT TODAY. TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY GALAXIES, CONSTELLATIONS, LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS AND SO FORTH. HE SAID AT THE END, "WE GROW JUSTLY WEARY OF OUR POLITICS BUT WE MUST OR MEMBER THIS. POLITICS, AND ALEX GRUBBY, GRASPING, CORRUPT, CONTEMPTIBLE MANIFESTATIONS, IS SOVEREIGN IN HUMAN AFFAIRS. EVERYTHING ULTIMATELY RESTS UPON IT, FAIRLY OR NOT, POLITICS IS THE DRIVER OF HISTORY." I THINK I WOULD DEBATE HIM ON THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF POLITICS IS THAT IMPORTANT TO MOST PEOPLE'S LIVES. BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM AND HE THOUGHT THE DEBATES THAT WE WERE HAVING, OF COURSE THAT WAS 2011, DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, ALL THE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE TERROR AND OTHER COUNTRIES, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WERE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A VERY INTERESTING CLINICAL TAKE TO MY PSYCHIATRIST TAKE ON THE AFTERLIFE, WHETHER THERE WAS AN AFTERLIFE. I JUST WONDER, LIKE, I JUST WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. WHEN I READ THIS, I WAS LIKE, THIS IS WHY I LOVED BEING ON WITH KRAUTHAMMER. WE ALL DO. THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS A WONDERFUL ABOUT HIS COLUMNS, THEY WOULD GO OFF ON ALL THESE OTHER HUGE Laura: BEING A FATHER. THE PERSPECTIVE WAS SO BROAD. THE THING ABOUT HOW MUCH HE LOVED POLITICS AND BELIEVED IT WAS AN IMPORTANT DEBATE, AND THE DISCOURSE WAS SO IMPORTANT, EVEN THOUGH IT'S ERODED AND DEGRADED SO RAPIDLY, HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE PERSUADABLE, AT LEAST AROUND THE EDGES. HE DIDN'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T WILLING TO JUST BE PERSUADED A BIT HERE AND THERE. AND SO HE TRIED TO BRING THAT TO HIS ARGUMENT. MOST OF THE TIME IT WORKS ON PEOPLE. THEY WOULD SAY, EVEN IF I DIDN'T AGREE AT THE END, I REALLY SAW HOW WELL HE MADE THE POINT. SO HE ENGAGED THEM. AND THAT WAS AN ART OF PERSUASION AND ITSELF. Laura: CHARLIE, YOU WORKED IN A LOT OF COLUMNS IN YOUR DAY, ON BEING A COLUMNIST, HE WROTE, "LONGEVITY FOR A COLUMNIST IS A SIMPLE PROPOSITION, ONCE YOU START, YOU DON'T STOP. YOU DO IT UNTIL YOU DIE OR CAN NO LONGER PUT A SENTENCE TOGETHER. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY INTENTION TO DIE AT MY DESK, ALTHOUGH MY MOST CHERISHED AMBITION IS TO OUTLIVE THE ESTATE TAX." WELL, HE ALMOST DID. WE'VE DOUBLED THE ESTATE EXEMPTION, SO HE DID PRETTY WELL ON THAT. AGAIN, HUMOR IN THE FACE OF DIFFICULTY, AND I DON'T KNOW. THAT WAS JUST ANOTHER. I THINK HE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU IN TERMS OF POLITICS IS NOT WHAT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT. HE IS RIGHT, POLITICS IS ABOUT POWER, WHO CAN GOVERN, IN THAT RESPECT, IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE IT IS HOW WE DETERMINE WHAT RIGHTS WE HAVE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE WANTED TO GO TO A BASEBALL GAME. HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN AT THE GAME TONIGHT, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED BY THAT. BUT HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN THERE. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO SQUEEZED MORE OUT OF LIFE THAN DR. KRAUTHAMMER. Laura: GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH TONIGHT.
