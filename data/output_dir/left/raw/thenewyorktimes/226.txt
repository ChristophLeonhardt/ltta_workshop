1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,920
My name is Brad Peyton.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,270
I’m the director of “Rampage."

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:04,770
All right.

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,380
What you see here
is a C-17 starting

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,500
to crash on the outside.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,160
That’s the largest military
plane in the US military.

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,470
Inside you have
Davis and Kate trying

8
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,610
to figure out what to do
now that they’ve knocked

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,190
George, the gorilla who
was rampaging on the plane,

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,680
unconscious.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,399
The challenge here
was on the outside

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,940
we basically did an aerial unit,
but on the inside everything

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,620
was shot on a
sound stage and you

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,610
have Dwayne Johnson
and Naomie Harris

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,020
actually on these
rigs, these wire rigs,

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,272
so that you could have the
sense they were falling.

17
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,730
We had these massive
wind machines.

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,430
Like there, you see Jeffrey
Dean Morgan and these guys

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,240
flying around.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,420
We actually had plane engines
that were blowing wind

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,950
through the whole set.

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,570
All the fire and
the black smoke,

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,750
everything dangerous,
was added in post.

24
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,220
But there were a
lot of real stunts.

25
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,869
Like, you’ll see
here in a second.

26
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:55,410
There you go.

27
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,270
You see Naomie lets
go and flies out.

28
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,910
We really pulled her at the
back of a plane on a sound stage

29
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,743
and then hooked her up
with a digital double

30
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:03,480
when she came outside.

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,610
There’s George, and George
is actually waking up,

32
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,690
and this stunt’s real.

33
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,540
This is Dwayne leaping back
to get to Jeffrey Dean Morgan

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,469
because he realizes
at this point

35
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:14,010
that he can’t leave Jeffrey and
has to get him off this plane

36
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,520
as well.

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,290
Everything is shot
in the direction

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,530
there where you see George,
the gorilla, was just a plate

39
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,070
and we added George
and the forklift

40
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,120
and the fire and
all that in post.

41
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,339
But this stuff, with the real
cast, is all shot for real.

42
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,880
And this is a really
interesting shot

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,329
because it actually takes two
completely different shots

44
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,870
and puts them
together, the first one

45
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,972
being on the plane and the
second one being skydivers.

46
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,430
And of course, they
would never let

47
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,610
us have Jeffrey Dean Morgan and
Dwayne actually skydive, so we

48
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,950
have real skydivers
being photographed,

49
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,310
and then we take a face
replacement process in post

50
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,860
to put them into
the scene and focus

51
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,470
on the emotion of the scene

52
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,500
And what you see here in the
last couple of angles of Dwayne

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,791
is something that I was
interested in doing because you

54
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,510
just don’t see movies shot
this way, where we mounted

55
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,010
a camera on the skydiver.

56
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,050
So you felt really
grounded and real.

57
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,720
And then in post, again, we
did a facial capture session

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,180
with Dwayne to get
the emotion right.

59
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,390
And this is actually a real
shot with real skydivers

60
00:02:12,390 --> 00:00:00,000
and then we just
added the explosion.
