president Kanye West visited rapper Donald Trump in the White House yesterday or possibly it was the other way around but who knows since reality is clearly cease to exist in his signature Dragon Energy style Kanye took the microphone from the leader of the free world saying imma let you finish your term mr. president but first I want to say that Beyonce had one of the greatest videos of all time Trump agreed and immediately redressed the injustice by appointing Beyonce chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff then I woke up even in real life the meeting of two of America's greatest something or others had a surreal quality to it Kanye wore a mag a hat and compared it to a Superman cape which made perfect sense or no sense at all since it's almost impossible now to tell the difference Kanye also defended the Second Amendment which made sense though it made no sense that he was making sense and the paradox toward gigantic worm hole in the space-time continuum causing reality to be sucked into itself then I woke up regaining consciousness I saw the left in the news media but I repeat myself reacting to the a Donald summit with his usual affable goodwill and principled integrity or violent hatred racism and hysteria as we used to call it before we fell through the wormhole in my previous dream and language lost all meaning former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile said quote and this is a real quote assuming there's still such a thing as a real quote Kanye West has set us back 155 years unquote of course she's right and now it's just like it was back in slavery days when billionaire black men used to hug their friend the president who had just finished improving the lives of all African Americans by virtually eliminating unemployment why not nothing is real anymore anyway after Kanye's oval office appearance black people throughout America suddenly realized the Trump was a great president then I woke up become Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan job tickety-boo there's a we need also sing see top see lower the zipa teasing it's all right it is mailbag day and it is also another Kingdom day oh my I don't know what that's screaming for

here I think it is true we pick on the left I pick on the left but today you know I'm looking at the country and where we are and I want to say to the left today I want to address anybody who's out there as a leftist or a Democrat I want to say keep doing what you're doing just keep it up keep attacking black people who have their own opinions you know just keep calling them Uncle Tom's and minstrels and dumb Negroes keep right on with that Democrats I like it because I want all Americans to thrive and I know black people are gonna wake up one day and realize that in order to have your respect they have to give up their intellectual freedom and personal independence so just keep and keep the women to keep calling the women gender traitors when they have their own opinions you just keep telling them that their sons and their husbands don't deserve due process in the presumption of innocence just stick with it stick with it Democrats I love it I love your style I want everyone to live the life that they choose and I know women are gonna wake up and realize you're turning them into whining victims in order to gain control over their lives so just and don't forget the gay folks do not forget the gay people keep telling them to strip their fellow Americans with their religious rights keep tell them to try and silence anyone who disapproves of them keep turning them into homo fascists and we on the right we'll just quietly collect the gay people who just want to be ordinary people ordinary Americans and be left alone like everybody else so just keep at it and don't forget the mobs don't forget the screaming and the mobs do not stop because I cannot destroy the credibility of your insidious anti American philosophy single-handed but you're doing a great job on your own and let's take a look Kanye what they Kanye the a Donald summit I have to talk about this it is just amazing the Kanye summit and the reaction are both amazing and listen Kanye is a kooky artist guy I'm not is and you know who cares about celebrity endorsements and all this stuff but he is a popular man and he's also he's obviously very kooky and his music is not my music I'm not gonna pretend it is but I was listening to him yesterday cuz it was a surreal meeting and this thing he just went off on this kind of rate he goes on these rants and you know you hardly know what he's saying but in the middle of these rants I started to hear what he was saying and it actually it was kind of moving you know it was actually kind of moving and so he's sitting in the Oval Office of Jim Brown the football player Jim Brown and he goes off and he starts talking well just listen to what he says he's been wearing the mag a hat and everybody's attacking him for the maggot habit I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game all right you know they tried to scare me to not wear this hat my old friends but this hat it gives me it gives me power away you know my dad and my mom separated so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home and also you know something about you know but the campaign I'm with her just didn't make me go as a guy they didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that could played catch with his son it was something about when I put this hat off and made me feel like Superman you made a Superman I was the best my favorite superhero and you made a Superman cape for me also I made a Superman cape for me so I felt like a man who plays catch with his sons because I didn't have that male energy in my life I mean that's a genuine genuinely honest and transgressive thing to say I mean he is telling you that the you know if anybody has stripped the black man of his manhood it is the left I mean nobody on the right wants anything for black people but to have families to be fathers to be men in among men that is what the right wants for the black man you know button because because our ideas get rid of the race thing the race thing is over we got it we get it you know this country had a major major change of heart in the 60s 50s and 60s it had a major change of heart it looked at its ins it felt shame it repented it is now a different place and wheel on the right say yeah let's let let's leave that behind everybody's for himself men be men women be women do it that's great who is telling them to be that you are so helpless you were dependent on our welfare who is telling him you know oh you can't you know you know you white don't need a man in the home women need a man like a fish needs a bicycle who's telling him that stuff who is putting their children at risk so that he wind up in prison and are taken off the streets and can no longer be part of the community it's all on the left was teaching the quail at like you know microaggressions what kind of a man I'm sorry but what kind of a man quails at microaggressions Oh women get are afraid when I walk into an elevator that's your problem that's your problem microaggressions are what men step on there but men wipe off their shoes as they're going to accomplish the thing they want to accomplish in their life and that's what he was talking about there Trump gave him that feeling Trump gave him the feeling being a man now let's listen to the reaction on MSNBC from this has cut six when they heard that they were just absolutely shocked Wow okay I'm doing this for everybody who's watching us who turned their volume down you can put it back up again that but if you think a thought 'fl play-by-play and political analysis you're not because that was an assault on our white house we're not we're not Canton analyze some of that stuff that was said as we warned you at the top there was a little profanity we've never actually more than you heard we were able to bleep some of it out but there was some of it did make it in there that was crazy that was bonkers I mean the things that that Kanye said with my favorite yeah how he talked about he had a lack of male role models in his life growing up not a lot of male energy in the season he was drawn to Magga was because of the male how'd he put that cap on he felt like a guy who could play catch with his his dick did laughing at him he's like that male power we don't want any male power in here we certainly don't want a father figures in the home we don't want any strong men showing young men how to be men we don't want that because that all man that ruins everything is all me too we're all victims we're all victims you know it is it is amazing this is what they're selling and Kanye of all people has ripped the masks of them off them you know he's ripped the mask is now bare how racist they are how sexist they are you know he was there to talk about prison reform and you know in his wandering you know monologue he kind of hit on prison reform a little bit and and this is a big deal prison reform because it's something that conservatives can get on board with because back in the 70s and 80s because of liberal legal transformations lip the liberal Supreme Court liberal policing this big cities were a crime infested jungle you know New York I lived in New York during that time you could not go outside without worrying about getting shot you couldn't let your girlfriend or wife got side without worrying she wasn't coming home it was miserable it was miserable and then Giuliani and other mayor's brought in ComStat and brought in you know no tolerance zero tolerance policing that they called it that it was really just making sure that weren't small crimes that led to bigger crime and the crime stopped it was a crisis and they ended the crisis except in liberal cities like Chicago they ended the crisis but like everything it had a price it had a price it put too many people in prison it wasn't mass incarceration it was enforcing the law and breaking the cycle that was leading our cities to become unlivable like San Francisco and Portland are becoming unlivable today but now now that the crisis has passed it is time to think about the cost when you take a young man off the streets you may be punishing a criminal but you're also taking away a father a brother a son you're taking them out of school you're taking them away from work so now it's time to think is there something else we can do is there some way we can rehabilitate people is there some way we can start to negotiate with these people because a lot of these neighborhoods have been cleaned up and the crime is low we can start to think about that it's good so anyway Kanye did hit on this at one point where he starts starts talking about racism so his number thirteen with blacks and african-americans we really get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry you say if people don't have land they settle for brands we want polo sport and Obama again we want to brand more than we want land because we haven't known how it feels to actually have our land and have ownership of our own blocks so when you don't have ownership then it's all about how something looks it's about the patina it's not about the soil it's not about the poor so we focus more on this somewhere on something to someone just expecting so I got it I got a shooter or the idea of someone being racist you know we talk about police murders which we definitely have to discuss and we have to bring the ability to the to the police offices and make the police officers are just like this but this is this whole hate building right and that's a major thing about racial tension like we also act I think we have to take a responsibility for what we're doing once again that was Caillou when you don't have land you need a brand I mean that was kind of profound I get to that back back to that in just a minute first I want to talk about 23andme this is one of those things those services where you spit in the test tube and they take a look at your DNA and tell you you know what they can tell you about your traits and also you can find out people that you're related to I just want to say this was I did it it was incredibly fun it is incredibly fun I found out I was a Swedish midget but no I just made that part up but no it's easy to do you spit in the tube they send you this kit even I could do it you spit in the tube and then you you mail your saliva sample back to them and then they just send you an email and it tells you certain traits that you're more likely to have it tells you people that you might not know you were related to who put this and all of this you can do it all you can say I don't want this information I don't want that or I do want this you know you organize it is made for you but it could just tell you all these really cool things about yourself and it's it you know it's not it's not going to tell you everything but it tells you stuff that this is really fun and interesting to know you can order your 23andme health and ancestry service kit at 23andme dot-com slash clayvin that's the number two three and me.com slash Clavin and they'll send report tells you the first thing it tells you how do you spell Clavin it's que la fille en 23andme what he was saying there what Kanye was saying there was actually profound if you don't have land you need a brand so in other words if you think all they offer you is identity instead of instead of accomplish and you know being somebody and doing something in the world and that's what he's talking about I think it makes perfect sense er now we have to listen then he hugged the president that's the thing that drove everybody crazy play that is very short clip play that I love this guy didn't want to put special guy this is to a special I love that is from saying I didn't want to put you in the you Shapiro's like that too you know there are plenty of famous people who wander in there and Shapiro says keep your head down you don't have to tell people you like me because it'll cost you and that's what Trump was saying to him there that was the moment that's the thing that drove them not so let's go over to CNN where Tweedledum and tweedle even stupider we're we're talking about this I got to go I got to go to Chris Cuomo first because that was maybe one of the that may win some kind of Emmy for one of the stupidest moments on television do we have that cut my curiosity wasn't about what came out of Kanye's mouth my wonder went to what was going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here's my educated guess okay other than a warm serotonin flush of happy hormone imaginary headlines blacks love Trump he's blacker than Obama I certainly agree this is a cartoonish situation but look at Trump here yet again yeah Superman sure I am I can do anything I can save people I wonder if images of Hurricane michael came into his head then the people that do need saving and here he is and then this Chris Cuomo reporting from inside the head of the president ladies and gentlemen yes hi this is Chris Cuomo I'm inside the head of the president reading his mind I've got yes I've got some racist thoughts going on hell is he talking about but if that's not stupid enough and you want some heat you got to go to Don Lemon heads could check him out what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself and embarrassing Americans but mostly African Americans because every one of them is sitting either at home or with their phones watching this cringing I couldn't even watch it I had to turn the television off because it was so hard to watch him sitting there being used by the President of the United States the president's exploiting him and excite I don't mean this in a disparaging way exploiting someone who needs help who needs to back away from the cameras who needs to get offstage who needs to deal with his issues the racist piece of garbage this guy is so ray really is awful you know there's a whole thing but you know one of the reasons I hope that Trump brings more black people into the conservative fold is is because you know we do want to hear from them we do want to know like what is going on we perfectly willing to accept that in their some ways in which the life of a black guy in America is different than the life of a white guy really willing to accept that and if there are problems we want to offer conservative solutions but what we don't want to do what we do not want to do is turn people into victims make people dependent and make people lock them into a philosophy because of the color of their skin that is incredibly racist I have to play this thing there's a guy I think his pronouncing his name on me and they have that wrong it's ami Horowitz and he does man on the street think he went to Berkeley the where I was where I graduated the UC Berkeley and he interviewed white liberals about why voter ID laws or racist young white liberals he asked them why voter ID laws her racist and then halfway through this he goes to Harlem and asks black people about it it is an amazing revelatory video listen to this you think that's harder for black people to go online well I feel like they don't have the knowledge of how of like how it works a lot of people have smartphones we might have data for most of the communities they don't really know what is out there just cuz they're not aware or like they're not informed I also think there's a repression of like black voting with them how they how if you're a convicted felon like you're not allowed to vote and everything and when you look at swing states like Florida that's a huge population of the of the like African Americans now I'm here in East Harlem to ask black people their thoughts on what you just heard do you have ID boy sure I do yes that's good idea do you carry ID yes I do do you know anybody any black person doesn't carry ID no and one that I know has an ID well what they think we don't have ID ha that's a lot do you have ID yes could I have my ID and my friends have their ID so we know what we need to carry around everybody that I know have ID like that's one of the things you need to walk around with you know this has been created this didn't happen accidentally this was created by the media this was created by the Democrat Party this is not an accidental thing you know they're telling they're telling people you know black people are dumb there's poor they're primitive they can't handle anything they don't know how to work the internet it's like you know it's like Matt anybody it is like they never met anybody with a different color skin that is where it comes from this condescension this and you know it is it is just it is all on one side if more black people came over and became conservatives they would find free you know answers to problems that might be in their community that include their freedom their independence their right to free thought and respect and respect for them as individuals as individuals not as black people because who cares if you're black or white is respect for you as an individual add to this this mob thing I have to read you know we've been talking about this thing in Portland and then we've just seen videos of it but today an editor from quill 'it is that time you pronounced Colette I cannot pronounce this guy's name is indy NGO that is his name ego i guess go yeah but he is an editor quill at and he wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal about the leftist mob in Portland where he lives and he says they they invited people to attend a protest because this 27 year old black father of three was murdered by the racist Portland Police okay so people have turned up for this and they started and by the way the guy who was killed by the Portland Police had already apparently killed allegedly killed two other people so it was like a shootout it was not like some kind of evil thing there's out there shouting stop race police terror throw all cops in the trash and they make their their make their way to the courthouse and they marched in the middle of the street bringing traffic to a stop they got a 74 year old man this is the video that keeps that's been playing a 74 year old man they tried to stop his car and he stepped out and was assaulted by the mob they pushed him and smashed his car with clubs after he managed to get back inside the vehicle no police were in sight even though the Central Precinct was blocks away Portland resistance a local social justice group put out a call on Twitter asking for the public to identify this white man and they they published photos of him is and his license plate with the message make racists afraid again this guy is not a racist he was just trying to get through this mob the guy says I've lived here my whole life but I don't want to go downtown anymore the mob later occupied a busy intersection and when a middle-aged man driving a car with North Carolina plates stopped in confusion the agitators descended on him you little white ever shouted one of course white man you are a little white supremacist go back to North Carolina where you came from this is the mob they came over Portland Portland Oregon which used to be a lovely city the crowd targeted other drivers you're lucky you didn't hit me I would have beat you up too yelled a demonstrator at another driver one person punched the back of a passing car now a block away here's the thing a block away police officers looked on they watched this why didn't they respond he and Ian Ingo contacted the department and they told him in a statement it feared intervention would change the demeanor of the crowd for the worse so the police wouldn't do anything he says such lawlessness is increasingly typical here so keep it up left these we love this on the right we want people to see who you are we want them to rip up you know the RNC is a new ad about this cut number nine where they just show you because it's not just the mob it's not just the man on the street it's the people at the top urging them on here's their ad I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings fall of the country maybe they were you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy get up and please get up in the face of some congresspeople is this the quote-unquote mob you know the thing is it says the left an unhinged mob the thing is that's a fair ad and there's no moral equivalence you know our friends over at campus Reform we love these guys Cabot Phillips goes out he does these campus you know man on the street interviews he went out and offered a hundred bucks to anybody who could name a time when conservatives had tried to stop left us from speaking listen to this give you $100 if you can give an example of conservative students on campus shutting down a liberal speaker under dollars the top of my head any campus I'm not too aware yeah I I'm gonna lose that hundred dollars I can't no I don't think I can I wish I cared but now that's that's amazing so keep it up lefties look I've gone a little long but I want to end with one more thing in the room with Kanye West Was Jim Brown one of the great greatest football players of all time and he came out afterwards and they asked him about the whole football thing with kneeling for the flag and I want you to listen to this man's answer because this is the answer this is the answer to the left with their you're a black man you're a woman you're a man you know this this identity politics built constructed to tear us apart to set us out each other so they can get power while we're fighting among ourselves that's the whole point of identity politics it is racism with a smiling face that's all it is it's racism with a smiling face meant to divide us like all racism is meant to divide people so the powerful can seize power that is what racism is for that is why people instigate it and people that's why guys like Putin sell it against the Jews that is why they sell it against white men on the Left that's all racism is it is just a means of going into your mind using your prejudices to turn you against your neighbors so they can seize power listen to Jim Brown's response to whether people should be kneeling and disrespecting the flag well I can be very blunt about taking a knee see first of all I'm an American that flag is my flag things that I've overcome in this country allows that make me a better person I don't think that we should take knees in protests instead of standing up for our flag I think we should work out our problems as a family and that's what I would advocate to my children to all the young people that I did I am an American that flag is my flag and I want to represent it that way you bet it's your Flags and brown you bet it's your flag I mean everybody this country I don't care what anybody says this country was built by people of a thousand different colors and it's being built right now by people of even more colors than before we are meant to be he is absolutely right we are meant to be the American family and the left does nothing but turn us against each other because the price their price of their identity politics is you lose your individuality you lose your freedom you lose what it means to be an American so keep it up lefties because Americans are smart they will figure it out we got the mailbag coming up I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire comm and subscribe we got the live streaming of another Kingdom season two episodes 1 & 2 and now it's it will be out there for everybody to listen to so everybody should listen to it come on come on pitch it alright come on over for the mailbag alright the mailbag every time I hear it I think about that truck veering off the road that's why we play it we worked late to kill drivers from Heidi red Hewitt's I don't know you know I recognize that name Heidi Reich you as I know her she's I know her from Twitter she is she wrote a book called honeymoon in Baghdad as she served in the Army in Iraq and met her husband in Iraq and so they had a love affair in Iraq and now she is raising a family and so yeah that's that's really funny I just recognized the name as I saw it hello supreme overlord Clavin ofc she knows my proper name that said we've heard the Democratic politicians this is about the mob tell their voters to do whatever it takes in order to win many of them have called for violence and we've seen a firsthand with these angry mobs if Republicans win and take over the House and Senate do you think the left will become even more violent and at what point to conservatives say enough is enough conservatives seem quite calm and mellow and provoked there has to be a point where we break I understand we need to be civil where the party values and morals but we also can't be a punching bag for these guys if the left becomes more violent after the elections how do you see playing out for us all right well this two-part question first of all know in in in one sense there will be a faction that becomes more violent but if if they lose the midterms the politicians are gonna realize that by playing to their base they have lost the country and once they realize that the politicians I think will start to move become a little bit more central and move back away from these people who are alienating the rest of the country I mean that is what happened when you know when Nixon in the 60s there was all the same thing the violence the riots and all this in Nixon just one like every every vote in America they got rid of him by other means but he won the electorate the people who the Democrats who came after that guys like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were in fact more centrist and they represented because there were southerners they had more sense of tradition and all that stuff so that's what I think will happen to the party they will realize the resistance has failed a small group a small group in a continually dwindling group will continue to be violent and possibly more violent and look and as in terms of our reaction we have the right to self-defense you don't have the right to go out and anticipate that they're gonna do something wrong and cause violence in return on principle you do not have that right and it would be just as destructive to our side as what they're doing is destructive to their side but you always have the right to self-defense you do have the right if you're swarmed by this mob to fight back and you certainly have the right to insist that the police protect you it has never worked for the police to stand by and do nothing that never works and that idea is always very suspect to me so I think listen I think a victory for the right in the midterms a full-on House and Senate victory would be a good thing because we would wake the resistance up to the fact that as Ann Coulter would say resistance is futile from Samantha hi Andrew are there any red flags you think women should look for when they first meet a man what a great question well look plenty of obvious ones right you want him to have a job or if you're in college you want him to have very decided goals you want them to be a driven person an ambition ambition ambitious person you want them to show up for the date on time you want them to be polite you want them not to talk the whole time you know these I think I shouldn't have to say this stuff I hope you already know this you to trying to take his time to get to know you before he tries to jump on your bones right you know it's like that the the other things I mean maybe more subtle things that people don't know you should definitely watch to make sure how he treats people who he may be a you know have more power than like waiters and restaurants like the valet who takes his car if you're living in LA we have valets you take your car you know you want to see how he treats those people because that's very very important you want to make sure that he takes responsibility for things if he's telling you a story about something that's gone wrong in his life and it's all somebody else's fault you know and the one really strange one and I hesitate to say this you take this with a grain of salt but if the guy is just too perfect you know shows up what the flower's pulls out your seed opens the door guy should do all those things in my opinion but if the guy is absolutely perfect you want to watch that he's not moving in on you too fast he's not a stalker because stalkers present that way I know I don't want to I don't want to make you suspicious of every polite lovable guy who comes into your can but just just watch out that is the thing that happens that people that stalkers play you by just being absolutely perfect in every possible way so that's just one thing to look out for but you're the the more normal ones the job making sure he's nice to waiters and all that stuff those are the things you can look for from Carlos supreme chancellor Clavin Jordan Peterson he calls him the Internet's dad I thought I was the Internet said dr. Jordan Peterson made a controversial statement that I personally find to be fair he said Cavanagh should step down now that he earned his seat to prove humility save his name and help heal the National divide surround him he seems very much in the brand of Christian self-sacrifice for the greater good I'm neither for nor against this idea but I also think people are really treating Peterson unfairly for this one your thoughts that people did jump on Jordan for this I completely disagree with him about it I completely think it is it is a what is it the Milton said that strain is of a higher to Nike I can't remember it was too high aiming too high there this was a hard-fought battle an important victory against mob rule an important victory for the process I think when you get those victories you should take the tear keep the territory that you took I do not think that gesture would have and received with anything but viciousness from the left I think the left has to learn that it's techniques are not going to work however there's nothing wrong with disagreeing with somebody you don't have to jump on the guy because you disagree with and I did see some stuff that was harsh and mean you know it's like we love Jordan he's doing great stuff and he's interesting has interesting things to say and we disagree with him that you know that it shouldn't be it shouldn't be that hard it shouldn't be that hard you don't have to you don't need a baseball bat to disagree with someone you just say yeah I disagree love you but you know your respect to you but with respect I disagree so I did disagree with him on that from Dave all hail Clavin supreme leader of the multiverse thank you I shouldn't you know have to say thank you because it's just odd but in your work both as an artist and as a commentator have you ever seriously struggled with overcoming self-doubt since your work as a novelist requires you to expose your creative ideas to criticism and your work as a political commentator also requires you to expose your intellectual ideas to criticism how do you manage to tune out the internal voice that tells you your novel might not be good enough and your arguments may be flawed this is something I regularly struggle with and I would suspect that your diverse career may have given you a unique vantage point on the subject I am bizarrely equipped with a complete indifference to how people I disrespect regard me okay that is not to say when my wife and I have a system when I write a book I give it to my wife she tells me what's wrong with it I yell at her and then I do what she said you know that's that's the thing I have to get angry further about what do you mean what I mean it's perfect it's perfect and then I just figure she's a great editor so I make most of the changes she wants you know but I do have a remarkable capacity to ignore the opinions of people I disrespect which is a lot of the people who disagree with me I feel very you know I I don't disrespect everyone who disagrees with me I disrespect people who don't have the principles that I believe are in fact principles right if you're out there mobbing people if you're out there calling people names if you're out there you know saying that a black person is a minstrel because he doesn't know you a party-line I do not have any respect for you I don't care what you think of me I really don't I mean I really have that feeling however however I hate to make mistakes I hated I've come on in here a couple of times and got it something factually wrong and I that I hate it when I you know like everybody I don't like to have to change my opinion but I will do it and I don't consider it weakness and you know not every book I've written is as good as every other book I'm aware of that you know sometimes you know when you finish something that's as good as it's gonna be you know these are the things you live with I think I think the advantage I have and the one thing that can be taught and can be learned is I'm not a perfectionist I work like a perfectionist I work over every sentence every word I write I work over everything I do I come in here I do so much prep just to come in and talk to you for a few minutes you know I do a lot of prep and work but I understand there will be errors there will be slips there will be things that are imperfect and I live with that so I I don't know if that helps I do have a weird personality about this I do have a very very thorny outer sphere that keeps me from being devastated by criticism from John I have a classic question with a bit of a twist I very good in-laws but my father-in-law and I see very differently on politics and current events well debate and as soon as actual facts data gets brought up he closes off he says I want to talk about this anymore so he's a leftist fair enough I'm used to that my wife and mother-in-law have encouraged no more debate which is probably for the best but when we visit they put on left-wing news or late-night comedians and then my father-in-law vocally agrees with how Republicans are stupid or our Trump is horrible and the second I say anything is no no we aren't debating we get along great outside of this but I'm at the point where I don't want to visit them anymore and I'll be tempted to just stay at a hotel with my wife which makes her sad rightfully so can you suggest anything that will help I know I won't be able to change his mind but this is getting tiresome it is tiresome and it's rude and I think you have to sit down with him and have a civilized polite conversation where you don't discuss the issues you start out with look we disagree I respect your opinions I understand that you see things from a different point and it's I don't want to debate with you fine no debates but it also is painful and unfair when you do this thing when you put on these comedians and say Republicans are stupid and then when I respond you say we can't debate so how about having a little bit of sensitivity towards me and I'll have a little bit of sensitivity toward you you can have that discussion because I think you know a lot of times especially on the left they do not hear themselves they do not know what they do and they're so certain that they're right that they don't understand that they're actually making a a political point they think they're just speaking the truth I think you should have that conversation with them because would be a shame if you know this tore up family relations from Zachary dear lord Clavin I know your advice is guaranteed to work so I was hoping you could help me I'm currently an engineering student at a large public university this semester I'm six hours away doing a cooperative education program at a job in my field what I thought would be a good educational opportunity has turned into a nightmare as my boss is unapproachable and is a terrible mentor who treats me like I'm an inferior being the whole situation has left me constantly tired and depressed I have no motivation to do anything even getting out of bed is a nightmare for me I have not felt happy in a while and it is hard to find help as my friends are so far away it sucks because I fought so hard to get out of that hole I was in and now I am right back in it how should I go about dealing with my work the next few months and do you have any tips on helping me find happiness and feeling like the person I was before there you know this is I'm a little bit this is a little bit strange to me at first quit I mean is if there's if you can quit the job there's no reason for you to be tormented if you can't quit the job if you can't quit the job then you're gonna have to regard it as a test of your valor and inner strength you get out of bed make sure you exercise don't drink too much make sure you get plenty of exercise and activity and steal your mind I mean make yourself realize that you are under attack by a bad boss steal your mind it's only a few more months and don't let the depression take you or anything like that I mean if you can quit quit there's no reason for you to be tortured if you can't quit if there are good and certain reasons why you shouldn't quit then take it as a test say I have got to be the guy who walks through this thing with my shoulders back with my head held high and with dignity and I don't get depressed and I make it through and that's what you have to take it take it like that the only thing that really stopped me in this mail mail was where you said it sucks because I fought so hard to get out of that hole I was in and now I'm right back in it so it sounds like maybe you're prone to depression or you've suffered from depression before and that's a whole other matter and that is something you might want to have looked at you might want to get some counseling about that if you are prone to depression you might want to find out what the cause of that is because it maybe go beyond what you're in right now let me take one more from McKay I am a conservative woman a wife a stepmom and a nurse one of the rain main reasons I'm a conservative is the emphasis on individual freedoms freedom however many conservatives lump women into the mother category I love caring for my patients being the one who cooks meals cares for the home and my stepchildren so clearly I'm a nurturing person but I've always known that I don't want children of my own and I have been told condescendingly that I will change my mind or that I just don't get it I've taken a lot of time to truly examine why I don't want children and I've always come to the same conclusion I respect the sacrifice men women make to be mothers and I honor that it's just not for me so my question is how can i reconcile being a conservative woman and not wanting to be a mom to many conservatives that is just wrong I would never become a liberal but one thing liberals are saying that conservatives are not a is it a woman has value even if she is not a mother uh I you know I don't know what conservatives are telling you you don't have value if you're not a mother it's garbage I mean that's ridiculous that is not what conservatives believe what conservatives believe is that you have you should live your own life live as an individual you know when I when I attack feminism one of the reasons I attack feminism is that I think a majority of women want different things than men they want they want are more focused on relationship they're more focused on the home they're more they want children and they want to take care of those children be around for those children I think a lot of women want that in their hearts but are being talked out of it by feminism however what does that say about you absolutely nothing it says absolutely nothing about the Jane or you know Debbie or Rose you know it doesn't say anything about her she has her own life and her own desires and she may not fit into that category which is absolutely fine you may want to work a hundred hours you know a day I do whatever you want to do is absolutely fine the only reason I attack feminists is I feel that they limit your choices not because I under the guise of giving you choices I feel they're actually denigrating motherhood denigrating homemaking denigrating being the wife which I think give a lot of women joy and pleasure and should be you know one of the choices available to people but nobody should tell you what you want personally what you want personally is entirely up to you and you have value in and of yourself you're obviously tremendously valuable person taking care of stepchildren nursing you know you're obviously hugely valuable person and no conservative who is a thinking conservative would tell you that you need to have your own children that's rude absolutely ridiculous if it's your mom then you may hear that I mean I can't I can't help you with that because moms want grandchildren but you know in as in terms of conservative philosophy the only thing I want for you as a conservative is for you to live your best life free and complete and letting other people be free as well all right we got to get the stuff I like you you you punks I'm gonna take my stuff and I'm gonna jam it so far up your stuff you're gonna have stuffing coming out your stuff for days weeks months you're gonna like it we're looking for a theme song here what on earth I think you guys crazy it's time to pick a theme song that was Chris Heinz all right I gotta do this quickly I saw a movie called three identical strangers it is a documentary it is now available I got it on pay-per-view with spectrum you could get it on Amazon Prime as well well here's here's the trailer which gives you an idea what it's about I wouldn't believe the story if someone else we're telling it but it's true they were did it it started when I went to college it was the first day of school all these people are coming up to me saying Eddie how are you Eddie hi I'm like my name is like hey I don't know what you're talking about soon as this guy turned around I knew it was Eddie's double I said you're not gonna believe this you have a twin brother oh my god as every chats are not coming toward it opens and there are his eyes or my eyes and my eyes are his eyes and it's true and then the story went from being amazing to incredible lose an article to twin is reunited I think I might be the third when people ask me what is the most remarkable story you ever encountered I tell them it's the story of the triplets so now you think you know what the movies about right here was my experience i watch this with my wife and i'm sitting there at this point when you get to this point where these three guys have been reunited which happens like 10 minutes into the film I said wow that's an amazing story 20 minutes later I said wow this is an amazing story 30 minutes later I'm like are you kidding me this is the most amazing story I have ever heard this is an incredibly amazing story it is touching it is it's just really really moving and it's it's kind of it's about nature versus nurture but it's also about the way the powerful treat people the way the powerful treat people with less power it is an amazing tale and just a very human and very rich and very deep and I really recommend that it's only like an hour and 40 minutes or 30 minutes something like that and just a really rich and deep story the documentary filmmaker is named Tim Wartell and I think he did a great great job and Lawrence Wright the journalist is in it who was a terrific journalist and he plays a a major role in the story but that's I'm telling you what you just saw which is unbelievable is just the beginning it's just the first plot point and then it just gets wilder and Wilder and it's all true again tune in today at 2:00 p.m. Eastern 11:00 a.m. Pacific for a special live stream of another Kingdom season 2 episodes 1 & 2
