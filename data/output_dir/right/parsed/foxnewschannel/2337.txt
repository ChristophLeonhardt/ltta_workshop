TO KEEP HIM OFF THE BALLOT.
IS HE SPENDING MILLIONS OF
HIS OWN.
MARTHA?
>> Martha: PETER, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
A "THE WASHINGTON POST"
COLUMNIST RECENTLY SUMMED UP
THE WEST VIRGINIA PRIMARY
SAYING THIS.
IF THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTION
WERE A SEASON OF THE
APPRENTICE, WE WOULD ALREADY
HAVE A FRONT RUN TORE BEAT
OUT EVERYONE ELSE.
DON BLANKENSHIP FRESH OUT OF
PRISON WHO STANDS A DECENT
CHANCE OF GOING BECOMING
WEST VIRGINIA'S NEXT
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR THE
SENATE.
HERE NOW DON BLANKENSHIP
WEST VIRGINIA SENATE G.O.P.
CANDIDATE AND FORMER MASSEY
COAL CEO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US
HERE TONIGHT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Martha: WHY DO YOU THINK
AT THIS POINT THAT YOU ARE
BEHIND IN THE POLLS AND DO
YOU THINK THAT IT'S BECAUSE
YOU DID RECENTLY SPEND TIME
IN PRISON?
>> I THINK I'M BEHIND IN THE
POLLS IS BECAUSE SENATOR
MCCONNELL HAS A SUPER PAC
THAT'S RUNNING, I THINK,
$1.5 MILLION WORTH OF ADS
AGAINST ME.
WE WERE EVEN BEFORE THAT.
AND BEFORE ELECTION DAY WE
WILL BE EVEN OR AHEAD.
>> Martha: SPEAKING OF
SENATOR MCCONNELL YOU MADE A
COMMENT OVER THE COURSE OF
THIS WEEK THAT GOT QUITE A
BIT OF ATTENTION.
LET'S PLAY THAT AND THEN YOU
CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
>> I HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN THE
FATHER-IN-LAW IS A WEALTHY
KIND OF PERSON AND HAS A LOT
OF CONNECTIONS TO SOME OF
THE BRAS IF YOU WILL IN
CHINA.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
AGAINST HIS WIFE.
I'M SAYING IT'S HER FATHER
THAT IS WELL CONNECTED IN
CHINA.
>> Martha: I SPOKE WITH
SENATOR MCCONNELL ON OTHER
TOPICS.
I WANTED TO GET HIS REACTION
TO THAT HE DID NOT RESPOND
DIRECTLY TO WHAT HE SAID BUT
HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.
WHO DO YOU SUPPORT.
>> THERE I'M NOT IN THAT
RACE.
I HOPE THEY NOMINATE SOMEONE
WHO CAN ACTUALLY WIN THE
GENERAL ELECTION.
>> Martha: THAT BREAKS DOWN
INTO TWO QUESTIONS.
UP THE FIRST THING IS ABOUT
THE CHINA PERSON COMMENT.
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING BY
THAT?
>> WELL, I THINK PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS CONSIDERING TARIFFS
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE
TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHINA IS THE BIGGEST TRADING
RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
DECISIONS ON THAT TRADE
AGREEMENT WITH DONE IN
AMERICA'S BEST INTEREST AND
NO PERSONAL BEST INTEREST.
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY
CORPORATION OR ANY BUSINESS
ENTITY.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE HAVE
YOU NO CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST.
IT'S NO ACCUSATION THERE.
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE
DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR THE
COUNTRY.
>> Martha: YOU SAID NO
ACCUSATION, BUT YOU POINTED
OUT THAT MR. MCCONNELL'S
WIFE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A
PROMINENT FORMER CHINESE
BUSINESSMAN.
SO THAT SUGGESTION -- SOUNDS
LIKE YOU ARE SUGGESTING HE
HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
BECAUSE OF.
THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
SUGGESTING?
>> WELL, YES.
I MEAN, I'M NOT SUGGESTING
THERE IS A CONFLICT OF
INTEREST IN ANY BUSINESS
WORLD THAT WOULD BE A
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
WHETHER YOU KNOW IT WOULD
IMPACT HIS DECISION MAKING
OR POSITION ON THESE ISSUES.
HE HAS IN THE PAST TAKEN
SOME STRANGE POSITIONS.
FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER TIANANMEN
SQUARE HE WAS ONE OF THE
SENATORS LETTING TRADE
CONTINUE WITH CHINA DESPITE
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND
VOTED IN THAT MANNER.
HE HAS HAD VOTES WITH CHINA
THAT ONE WOULD QUESTION.
THE BASE ISSUE HERE IS THAT
BUSINESSES ARE ALWAYS
CONCERNED ABOUT CONFLICT OF
INTEREST WHEN THEY ARE
NEGOTIATING DEALS.
IN THIS CASE WE JUST NEED TO
BE AWARE OF THEM.
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.
I WANT TO JUST ASK YOU ABOUT
WEST VIRGINIA BEFORE I LET
DID YOU GO BECAUSE WE ARE
GOING TO RUN OUT OF TIME.
IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, THEY
ARE LAST IN BUSINESS,
ACCORDING TO FORBES AND
FIRST IN OPIOID USE.
WHY ARE YOU THE BEST PERSON
TO TURN YOUR STATE AROUND?
>> WELL, ONE THING I IS I
HAVE IN THE GOTTEN GIVEN A
CHANCE TO TURN IT AROUND AND
MY TWO OPPONENTS HAVE.
ONE LOB IDEA FOR DRUG
COMPANIES ONE IS
REPRESENTING AND HAS
REPRESENTED FOR 20 YEARS THE
CITY THAT'S WORST IN THE
NATION PER CAPITA IN POET
DRUG DEATHS.
IT'S NOT EASY TOTAL
DIFFERENCE.
I HAVE HOT HAD THAT
OPPORTUNITY.
THE COMPANY I RAN WE WERE
DRUG-FREE.
WE WERE VERY TOUGH ON DRUGS.
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO BE
VERY TOUGH ON DRUGS AND
THAT'S WHAT I WILL BE.
>> Martha: WE HAVE MORE
CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU NEXT
TUESDAY NIGHT.
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
BEING HERE, SIR.
