1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,560
- My name is Sarah McBride

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,913
and I am a proud transgender American.

3
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:08,980
(applause)

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,280
My name's Sarah McBride.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,570
I'm the National Press Secretary

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,700
at the Human Rights Campaign,

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,170
the nation's largest LGBTQ
civil rights organization.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,140
After coming out as
transgender while in college,

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,180
I applied for and was eventually accepted

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,080
into an internship in
the Obama White House.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,590
And it was truly one of the
most incredible experiences

12
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,850
for me to walk into the White House

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,500
as my authentic self.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,100
Even as an intern, I saw that my presence

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,360
and the presence of
other transgender people

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,240
changed the way staffers
and administration officials

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,190
talked about transgender equality.

18
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,190
Because at the end of the day

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,680
an issue can no longer be abstract to you

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,720
if you're walking the halls

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,270
or sitting across the conference table

22
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,400
from a person impacted
by those challenges.

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,660
There was no question that
the Obama Biden administration

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,750
was supportive of transgender
equality from the start.

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,740
But in the second term,

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,270
we saw a degree of confidence and passion

27
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,990
for trans equality that we had never seen

28
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,600
by any administration in American history.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,830
And that was because that White House

30
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,550
got to know transgender people.

31
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,870
They got to see us in our full humanity.

32
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,523
They got to see us and understand

33
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:12,040
that our issues aren't some luxury issue

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,270
that you focus on once
you deal with others.

35
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,590
These are life and death
issues for the trans community.

36
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,060
Now in the five years since
I interned at the White House

37
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,488
we've gone from a presidency of progress

38
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,720
to a presidency of prejudice.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,220
Donald Trump and Mike Pence

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,490
have governed the exact
same way they campaigned,

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,090
with bigotry and with bluster.

42
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,930
Despite Donald Trump
claiming that he would

43
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,140
be a friend to the LGBTQ
community as President,

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,630
we've seen the exact opposite
from his administration.

45
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,310
Just a few months after taking office,

46
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,920
they rescinded life-saving guidance

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,470
promoting the protection
of transgender students.

48
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,450
They've appointed anti-equality extremists

49
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,100
to administration positions
on the federal bench.

50
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,530
They've granted a sweeping license

51
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,060
to discriminate to government workers,

52
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,830
federal contractors, and
health care providers

53
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,000
against LGBTQ people.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,900
And in one of his most shameful moves yet,

55
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,490
the President, the commander in chief,

56
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,820
targeted our own troops for
his hate and discrimination

57
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,550
with an unconstitutional dangerous

58
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,810
and discriminatory ban

59
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,890
on openly transgender service members.

60
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,440
It's a reminder that our progress,

61
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,190
our march toward a more perfect union,

62
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,760
is never linear.

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,890
Equality often comes in fits and starts

64
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,640
but we've seen over the long course,

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,940
over the long arch of history,

66
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,580
that we do move forward.

67
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,000
That no presidency can stand in our way

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,020
or halt the momentum of our movement.

69
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,690
That our voices are more powerful
than a single politician.

70
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,070
And that's why, even with
Donald Trump in the White House,

71
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,980
even with Mike Pence as Vice President,

72
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,990
even with anti-equality politicians

73
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,080
and far too many state legislators,

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,280
we continue to open hearts, change minds,

75
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,870
and move equality forward.

76
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,750
We must never forget
that change trickles up.

77
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,620
That change will come not just from laws,

78
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,117
but from hearts, minds,
policies and practices,

79
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:58,720
and more and more people saying that,

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,700
"If my child were to
come out as transgender,

81
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,340
"the world that I'd want them to encounter

82
00:03:03,340 --> 00:00:00,000
"is a world of kindness,
love and inclusion."
