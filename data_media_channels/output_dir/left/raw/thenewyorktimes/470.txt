1
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,820
This shell here has probably

2
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,222
about a dozen baby oysters

3
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,290
on it but they're much smaller

4
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,792
than my little pinky nail here.

5
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,292
You can see one at the top of

6
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,493
 

7
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,640
my fingernail.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,530
After several weeks they're

9
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,664
much easier to see.

10
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:05,732
At that point we're ready to

11
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,733
plant them on to sanctuary

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,668
reefs, where they

13
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,470
continue to grow and thrive and

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,304
provide ecological benefits.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,155
What we do here,

16
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,758
what we do on this land

17
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,194
is going to affect the water

18
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,930
in our river and in the Potomac

19
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,997
and in the Chesapeake Bay.

20
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,516
This is a little catch

21
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,617
basin, a little spring

22
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,285
development that we harnessed

23
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,787
enough water to fill a two-inch

24
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,456
pipe that goes by gravity

25
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,525
down to the first

26
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,727
pasture in this field now.

27
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:08,761
And that supplies them with

28
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,796
their water.

29
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:10,662
 

30
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,999
These are the practices

31
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,868
that farmers need

32
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,636
help with financially and with

33
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,738
technical assistance

34
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:19,973
to put these in.

35
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,075
And the proposed Trump budget

36
00:02:22,075 --> 00:00:00,000
is going to do away with that.
