Italy is crying invasion and even threatening to expel French diplomats over a dramatic cross-border migrant raid Rome has summoned the French ambassador after French border police swooped on an Italian rail station to make a suspected drug trafficking refugee take a drugs test Italian prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the incident and while the foreign ministry in Rome's kept a civilized tone some Italian politicians haven't held back the behavior of French agents in Bardonia is very serious matter we remind macron that no foreign agent can come here and assert their authority we are a sovereign country not a province of France we are not macrons toilet on top of expelling Russian diplomats we should expel French ones there had no right to answer no right this will be the first and the last time I'm very angry about what's happened Paris claims that a bilateral deal will allows them to cross Italian borders in such cases the Italian police insist that the deal says France must notify them of his plans and that it failed to do so authorities adds that the room inside the Bardo Nekia rail station was a migrant centre and off-limits moreover migrant center of fischels are outraged they're calling the raid interference and adding that French officers intimidated the doctor they're mediators and lawyers but France claims that it had asked permission to enter the facility and that the migrant agreed to take the urine test political science lecture and Lorenzo Craig Lascaux who's in Bosnia told us in his opinion the French police are in the wrong the NGO which is running the migrant center in part of the nature by the way I am a few hundred metres from there I am in model-making right now at the Oh NGO declared the differential thorgy's we're in a way acting in an intimidating manner and so this act has been seen by many politicians and I would say by a large portion of the Italian public opinion as an act of defiance a kind of violation of sovereignty on Italian soil what has been said very clearly by the Italian Authority is that Italian police was not informed by by French customs agent about the operation which is against the provisions of the binational agreements this is just the latest migrant related scandal on the French Italian border comes just weeks after a volunteer was summoned by French police for saving a heavily pregnant migrant in the Alps we were doing an ordinary patrolling tour as we have regularly done since the beginning of winter to bring aid to people who passed the pass in difficult conditions during this patrol we spotted a group of people who were walking in snow there we saw that it was a family was two young children and a pregnant woman we gave them food and drinks and dry clothes I took my car to take it to the hospital they asked for my documents and they cataloged my personal belongings they notified me of a hearing on Wednesday and released me at midnight I see two astronomers what the situation repeated itself tomorrow I would act in the same way I did the right thing telling journalists my telephoto lusts that many in his country are appalled by Frances behavior over the refugee situation France is one of the toughest countries and they don't they don't cooperate at all they putting the police force on every borders with Italy and they are very very aggressive on rejecting every every time they find some migrants that are trying to go to France and this is situation that is becoming really critical for Italy because Italy cannot keep all these thousands and thousands of migrants
