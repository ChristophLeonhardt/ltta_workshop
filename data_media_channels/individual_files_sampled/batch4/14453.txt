you and I share the belief that Scott Pruett is perhaps the most effective cabinet minister under Trump that's really what they're trying to do they're trying to get him out by hook or by crook well what are they what are they accusing him of they're accusing him of expensive plane flights they're accusing them particularly of renting this apartment for $50 a night and he says it was an airbnb style it was reviewed by EPA staff found no ethical violations but the media is going bonkers because it was the wife of a lady of the wife of a man who's worked for a company that represents some fossil fuel interest but it has no business before the EPA and they're just going just insane over this ignoring every other every other cabinet in previous administration scandals there is nothing here he's been grilled on this he's been investigated he got a deal that he did wasn't only spent charged and nights he went to this apartment and he also took some airline flights which were expensive but as people are researching Gina McCarthy Obama's EPA Administrator had travel expenses are exceeding anything even he came true it came close to you use the analogy as he knows it very well this is the equivalent of someone a property owner who's been suing your your local government for years because of all these bureaucratic excesses and then becoming a head of that bureaucracy yeah so this is unbelie this is the most offensive thing that Donald Trump has done in Washington is put a reformer like Scott Pruett at EPA they are beside themselves he's not only been the most effective Trump cabinet member probably the most effective cabinet member in the first year going back 40 years the Reagan's first term I can't think of any other cabinet secretaries that have been this powerful maybe you know Caspar Weinberger under Reagan or someone like that but this is the most effective and they are going after him completely and over my Newt stuff that is just as silly when you start hearing the details that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
