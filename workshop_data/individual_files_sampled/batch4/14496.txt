have we reached yet another new pinnacle in mind-numbing political correctness namely is it now off-limits to refer to sewer rats as sewer rats alas apparently sewer rats have feelings too well Toronto is the midst of yet another summer of the gun the align share of that gun violence being of the thug on thug varietal but a new law was achieved last month when a couple of gangbangers opened fire in a playground wounding two young girls in the process now to anyone who's a fan of civilization it was a despicable act it was a mindless act of violence and it prompted a justifiably infuriated Mayor John Tory to state the following quote the police are working aggressively and they're working with full resources deployed to track these people these profoundly antisocial kind of sewer rats down end quote but who knew that describing a pair of gunmen as sewer rats could be offside well at least it was offside to the perpetually offended community activist Desmond Cole who has turned race baiting into a full-blown career Cole recently went after mayor Tory tweeting the following quote did you apologize for calling black people profoundly antisocial sewer rats or not end quote yeah that's right Cole was actually going to bat for the thugs because well apparently being compared to subterranean rodents might be harmful to the self-esteem of those thugs or something for those who have endured the misfortune of listening to a Desmond Cole broadcast this Nut Bars comments were hardly surprising after all whenever Cole gets a chance to opine into a microphone the end result goes something like this blah blah blah blah white privilege blah blah blah blah white supremacy blah blah blah blah systemic racism due to white privilege and white supremacy blah blah blah blah you get the idea but Cole's attack on Tori was a really big mistake due to Cole's own arrogant and incorrect assumptions you see when meritorious remarks he wasn't even aware of the race or the skin colour of the gunmen all he knew was that too our men almost killed two young girls in a playground nevertheless in a CBC story Cole said that Tori's language was dehumanizing because he described the men involved in the shootings as a vermin actually come to think of it maybe call has a point here maybe Tory should apologize apologize to Verma in the world over that is because I've never known sewer rats to pack pistols and start shooting at kids in a playground but thankfully Tory is not backing down yet why is it that the progressives always seem compelled to come to the defense of the worst of the worst President Trump himself ran into this nonsense in May when he called members of the brutal Mexican gang ms-13 as animals only to have the left call this anti Mexican rhetoric and why does the left always always play the race card even when race has nothing to do with the matter at hand after all we'd be happy here to call any criminal an animal or a sewer rat regardless of race nationality skin color or creed as for the rest of us what should we as members of Team civilization call those bleeding hearts who come to the defense of the sewer rat community pond scum works for me for the rebel media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
