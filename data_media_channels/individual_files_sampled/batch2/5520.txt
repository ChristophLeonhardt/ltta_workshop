the mayor of New York City bill de blasio joins us now mr. mayor thanks for taking time out in a very another very busy day for you what more can you tell us about what happened downtown we know that the disposal unit has taken that bomb away up to the Bronx up to Rodman's neck the target apparently robert de niro his restaurant his office is his complex down there and tried back out what else can you tell us well thank God no one got hurt the device was removed successfully it looks exactly consistent with what we've seen with other devices and look someone is trying to intimidate someone's trying to quash voices in this country using violence that's what it comes down to or some group of people and what's very important to remember while we're getting to the root cause in this whole discussion of why we have an atmosphere of hatred in this country and how it can be addressed is to look at something very positive yesterday which is the reaction of the people of this city who were not intimidated were not thrown off their game did not allow this to undermine their faith in their society they saw first responders address this immediately we got a lot of information out there so people knew what was going on but it's something that always gives me hope the people are good that does not mean every actor on the public stage is good or positive but the people are good and they responded in a very noble way yesterday in my view and the New York Police Department will remind again the best in the world bar now amen they showed us again this morning any sense mr. mayor of who may have perpetrated this crime we know the FBI the NYPD and Secret Service all working together on this a lot of these packages came through the US Postal Service they scanned through there will be surveillance footage at some point if you have any sense of where this is coming from we don't but I am confident we will find the perpetrator or perpetrators there's a lot of information here obviously the pattern of these devices is very clear very consistent I think that will ultimately help the investigators also we need to recognize there could be more coming yeah and that's really if people being vigilant this moment is absolutely crucial you know our first responders do an extraordinary job and this city amazing job of fighting terrorism addressing terrorism over years but one thing you'll always hear from the NYPD is they do an even better job if the people are working with them and providing information and being the eyes and ears if anybody today in this country receives a package that looks suspicious don't open it immediately alert the authorities people have to be part of addressing this problem and also have to be careful in this moment it's not over until we find the people who did it and in fact Susan that's exactly what happened this morning this person working at the building owned by Robert DeNiro saw the packages on TV yesterday the other packages and said to himself wait a minute I saw one that looked exactly like that in our mail a couple of days ago and call the New York Police Department about four o'clock this morning right and what's also interesting is amazing is what and the NYPD has done since 9/11 and creates certain networks and if you could just explain like why people can feel safe in the city because we are reaching at the NYPD is reaching out to business leaders and building owners and that there are protocols in place I think that would be very helpful I think there's two pieces of the equation one is NYPD we've put a lot of very substantial anti-terrorism capacity in place we've added a lot more officers to that work including the very vivid overt work of being in front of media locations today being in front of the offices of elected officials to send a message that extra protection is there to reassure everyone but the other piece of the equation is what you point to which is building a whole network of people involved in providing information and insight to the NYPD that's the force multiplier a deep connection to the community as not just businesses it's right down to the grassroots with everyday people the phrase if you see something say something is is very real and alive here in New York City by the way there was an attempt a couple of years ago in the Chelsea neighborhood and one of the reasons why no one thanked God was grievously hurt was there was a pressure cooker bomb left on a sidewalk in a bag and a passerby and every day New Yorkers saw it literally walked by and then said wait a minute something looks funny here took the time to call the police that device was taken away safely no one was hurt because the message is everybody has to be participating in fighting terror and that if the relationship between police and community this goes beyond the fight against terror the relationship and policing community is one of real dialogue and mutual respect that will allow the police to keep us safe in much more profound ways that's what we've been working on here and we found that everyday neighborhood policing everyday dialogue between police and community also contributes to fighting terror this was an attack on our democracy yes this was an attack on former presidents on government officials on Democrats on Trump critics there's a pattern there that it's it's hard not to see it's clear having said that how quickly given you know the history and the knowledge of investigations like this will we know more about exactly where this came from who this came from what group what person and especially given that how many days away from the midterm elections well we 12 days away from the midterms what are your concerns about political implications copycats or this actually heating up before it cools down okay two parts I'd like to add into this one is the first response that people need to have to this is to not only be involved but get more involved in the electoral process in civic involvement in their communities this is the response look terrorism we don't know this is foreign or domestic we don't know this is one individual or an organized group the response is the same we will not let our democracy be undermined we won't let our values be undermined one of the things that I've really proud of New Yorkers for the way they handle these situations is the resiliency even the attack we had a year ago on Halloween Day people immediately respond to that by coming out in droves that night we have a big the city people participated rather than shrinking and and going away from their normal routine and from their involvement in the community they came out and droves to say we're not gonna let anyone change us or intimidate us so 12 days to Election first thing everyone needs to do is do everything you would have done and even more to be involved and to reinvigorate our democracy in the face of this the second point this investigation Rico could be days could be weeks could be longer and we can't assume an easy tidy resolution we have to assume unfortunately that this could take a while to unravel that we might see more of these and that we need everyone to participate in solving this problem with our law enforcement officials but even if it goes on for days even it goes on for weeks we can't let it change us see but at the same time mr. mayor wouldn't you also say that there's a responsibility in the part of those who are not Trump supporters not part of that ecosystem if you will to not just participate in the elections but to do our best to make sure that we don't respond nobody on our side responds in an equally correct violent or inappropriate way and we need to make sure our folks stay calm and vote and participate but not retaliate exactly right this this is ultimately going to be one of those moments I believe where people look at an atmosphere of hatred that's been created over the last two or three years and they reject it this goes beyond any partisan consideration this is an American question I don't think the American people like turning on their television or going online and seeing anger and hatred I think they want healing across the partisan spectrum clearly it doesn't matter what you consider yourself ideologically there's no place for violence and it's time to turn this entire situation so I think what this is going to cause is a lot of revulsion I think it's going to cause a lot of people including a lot of folks who are more conservative to say this is not the America I signed up for and we've got to start moving to a place of civility and respect including of course for the media you don't have to agree with what anyone in the media says you do have to respect the Free Press the founding fathers made that quite clear it's how our democracy works I think you're going to see people increasingly reject this politics of anger and extremism it is a lot about the Democratic reaction and perhaps a reset on the approach on the part of Democrats which I want to talk about but if you look at the president's tweet this morning he's not he's not focused on this breaking news story and what's happening in lower Manhattan on another suspicious device found at a Trump critics property he doesn't appear to be focused on what some would see is the monumental events of the past 24 hours he he still focused on dividing and on attacking the press what do we need to hear from your Republican counterparts at this point in lieu of a president who seems to be averse to unity okay first I would say I think I think we understand who Donald Trump is at this point and he's not changing so the yearning which is legitimate everyone's yearning for a leader who's going to be unifying and respectful it's not who he is it's not who he's been for his entire adult life right and the other thing is let's stop focusing on Donald Trump that we need to I think you're making a key point how about everyone else in the Republican Party a speak up now step up and talk about a respectful civil political discourse and I think this is about modeling good behavior it's not gonna come from the president we all grew up with I think a rather quaint notion that you know every child should look up to the president United States that's not viable at this point mm-hmm what is viable is what the rest of us do elected officials on both sides of the divide but everyday people as well this a lot of ways calls upon Americans to solve the problem locally which is something Americans are very good at to solve it at the grassroots to do some healing locally to work with people who don't necessarily agree with you on common interests for the good of your own community to get involved politically by the way one thing I would say despite this horrible last couple of days what we're seeing with early voting the country is another reminder of the strength and resiliency of American people people are coming out in droves to participate at this moment that's their way to make a difference at a moment like this and if you want to check on Trump whether you like him or not this is your chance to get it at these midterms really another development this morning the FBI and local police are now responding to a postal facility in New Castle Delaware in connection with this ongoing bombing investigation they haven't said yet why but there were reports yesterday that there was one of these packages addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden as we all know he lives in the state of Delaware again the FBI and local police responding now to a postal facility in New Castle Delaware perhaps tracking yet another package mr. mayor as you said we don't know where the end of this is we're forward we may find more packages in somewhere in the postal system may be left in mailboxes as this worker at Robert DeNiro's office and restaurant found and remembered that he saw one a couple of days ago how does the NYPD handle that what do you do with the prospect of there could be many many more of these floating out there I think the first thing is not to allow a culture of fear we want to educate people that this is happening that they can be part of protecting themselves and everyone around them we want everyone to participate but we're not going to allow culture yeah this can be handled what these individual or individuals has done is created a very clear pattern there's not a lot of subterfuge here we know exactly what they're doing and people can see it and address it and be ready for it yeah but it may go on for days it may go on for weeks we can't be scared of that we have to recognize that one thing that's very clear NYPD and our federal and state partners overwhelmingly overwhelming percentage of the time find the perpetrators and usually in the scheme of things pretty quickly that track record is really clear people need to have that confidence but that doesn't mean we get it instantly so if we have to weather a storm here I can certainly say on behalf of eight point six million people in this city they know how to weather that storm they've done it before and they're not going to let the acts of someone who's trying to intimidate undermine us so of its days of its weeks we will handle it but I'm absolutely certain we're going to find out yes so mr. mayor I've spoken a lot about what we need from Republicans in this and and we need them to speak out we are concerned the president will not we don't know where the end of this is and we're seeing that we now may not be at the end with the breaking news in lower Manhattan and now in New Castle Delaware but as Democrats I would speak to you now and say that we need to immediately press reset I want to be honest I've been highly reactive in my emotions and fears about this president and I've shown some of that even this morning we don't know who sent the packages but I do know in my heart that President Trump bears a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that made it almost inevitable that top Democrats and the media would be targeted we know that what Trump wants before the midterms is a brawl a battle of conspiracy theories unhinged accusations and violent rude behavior Democrats don't do it hold back don't try and intimidate Republicans from public and when they're at public places like restaurants don't do it a tactic explicitly encouraged by Maxine Waters don't do it don't do it don't say it Maxine don't say we can't be civil in dealing with Republicans like Hillary Clinton said don't say we should kick Republicans as another former government official said don't get in the gutter with this man and this rhetoric that's what he wants that's what he wanted during the Brett Cavanaugh hearings and he got exactly what he wanted and we gave it to him to an extent these bombs so chaos Trump thrives on chaos Democrats can win by doing the right thing we may have to lose badly for a while before we win in the right way but we can't win in the wrong way mayor de Blasio and I'm worried that we have reacted so emotionally and with so much shock and horror that we can be pulled in and that false flag can be raised right on the Democrats if we're not careful moving forward toward the midterms would you concede this is possible yeah because it's a very powerful point you make and I'm with you that there's a there's no contradiction between having extremely strong passionate views and going and fighting for them politically versus creating an atmosphere of civility and respect that does not have to be a contradiction and I really feel the folks in my own party and who share my believes who say look at this horrifying moment in history it calls for you know desperate times desperate measures I think that's a misunderstanding I agree with her point you can strike a notice civility and a note of mutual respect and mutual love for our country while simultaneously saying in the political arena in elections or on the floor of Congress we're gonna fight tooth and nail for what we believe in there's no contradiction you can be involved in civil disobedience which has helped to change the world Martin Luther King and so many others proved that but that does not have to devolve into violence and hatred in fact one of the things dr. King always talked about was not answering hatred with hatred how corrosive that was that somehow you had to find the love whether it's a matter of faith or ideology find the love for your fellow human even when you disagree with them your country and for your country and that's what when is the day in the end so your caution is right and the other point you made about the I feel it's very strongly for Democrats and progressives if you want instant gratification on November 6 you're barking up the wrong tree I believe November 6 will be a the outcome will be a mixed bag there will be some areas where from a point of view Democrats and progressives as real progress there will be some areas of setback that does not change the fundamental work ahead which is to go the grassroots and move people and educate them and motivate them to get more deeply involved one of the good things that's happening despite this painful last 24 hours is this moment of crisis over the last couple of years is reinventing our democracy I wish it wasn't happening this way but it is true that people are participating they're feeling ownership they're feeling it's no longer something they can stand back Friday they have to literally to the point of running for office themselves and that's what it takes maybe that's a course correction we need it maybe and I wish it didn't come in this form but maybe we needed that wake-up call anyway to recognize that if you are not participated in a democracy it will atrophy and that's the ultimate it's so precious and it's so easily broken I don't think we really understood what it is that we had that was so precious here when President Trump was elected as president I don't blame or fault anybody for believing in him but we have a precious democracy and it is in jeopardy this morning Mayor Bill DeBlasio thank you so much this morning thank you thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
