I have seen gods fly I've seen men build weapons that I couldn't even imagine I've seen aliens drop from the sky yeah but I have seen anything like this which one is your time you get to decide I'm Justine you are going to me don't freeze I never freeze I too never freeze if you are among before crazy people on the planet who have not yet seen this movie right after am joy you should go immediately to the theater and see Black Panther keep MSNBC on Sirius XM so you can still hear it and if you have seen it already go C to get I plan to definitely do that there are so many reasons why this film is smashing box-office records bringing in more than five hundred and twenty million dollars worldwide and Counting I am so excited to have one of those reasons with me right now here's a clip of him in action i baku leader of the jabari will hang accept your challenge buckle brought it to Hanuman a nose ring whoopee joining me now is the one and only mbaku also known in real life as Winston Duke Winston thank you so much for being here thank you thank you thanks for having me okay well first of all congratulations on the film and this is your first major feature film role how lucky are you and how did you get this part oh my god I'm incredibly lucky and I would have been really happy to be in a film with just one of these people with just Angela Bassett or Lupita Nyong'o or chadwick boseman and I'm in with everyone Andy Serkis you know Michael B Jordan and you know it's just it feels like serendipity because I think I mentioned to my agents probably three months prior that I wanted my work to have a social justice footprint I wanted it to mean something more I wanted it you know to be with directors who have more of an author type feel to their work and have a clear voice and I mentioned Ryan Coogler so three months later I'm going in for this untitled Marvel project and it turns out to be black panther and I couldn't be happier it's pretty amazing and for those who are hearing the accent you are from Tobago food and tomato trinny people United but you came to this country when you were a young man you are you are an immigrant and it you know how important is it for you as a member of the Diaspora it's different for you seeing this film from that point of view and do you think that people didn't see it differently than maybe people on the continent well I think so deeply because what conda's kind of existed for all of us across the Diaspora within our hearts and our minds like this idea of a country that's outside of the reach and effects of colonialism and the hopes of what that would be like imagining what our history and our position in the world could be like imagine how we would be able to change the trajectory of our of moving into the future if we didn't have that kind of problematic hurtful painful history and I think it's always been there but now this movie is make giving flesh to that imagination it's giving flesh and a reality to it and they're showing up they're showing out you know in Trinidad and Tobago there was an African beauty pageant that was associated with the premiere of the film drummers African dancers these are people who have been disconnected from a long strong history and they're getting a chance to recreate that and have this sense of grandeur and royalty associated with something and they're just loving it yeah and you know one of them without giving away any spoilers those four puts for four people who have not seen the film you know mbaku is a is an important character in the film he's sort of the anti-technology voice in the film the traditionalist and you know he's different from the comic they changed the title they gave him I think a lot more dignities are a lot more humor responsibilities he's now the leader of his entire tribe he has the welfare of an entire people on his shoulders and it's really given the character a lot more than just as ego to depend on you know absolutely we'll talk a little bit about infinity ward's I mean you know this is I'll be setting up the next big Marvel franchise how excited are you about that give us a little taste of it I am incredibly excited and stoked and so Marvel has a really great way of building worlds and getting their fans to be really invested because we get to know them we get to know these people we get to know what Conda and it's really established a new landscape new soundscape all these new wonderful things for us to just really dig into so now that you're invested and you're attached and you have narratives to hold on to they're gonna challenge all that with Thanos who's just very strong and imposing and you don't know what he's gonna do so it's gonna be a lot of fun well Winston you are very rightly being called one of the breakout stars from the film you're incredible congratulations like I mean just huge man thank you for being thank you so much thank you all right
