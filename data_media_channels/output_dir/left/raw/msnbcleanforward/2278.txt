00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,089
AND THE PRESIDENT’S TEAM IS LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE TARIFFS ON

00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,696
IMPORTED LAST YEAR. BUT CURRENTLY, OUR ECONOMY IS

00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,532
BUT CURRENTLY, OUR ECONOMY IS INCREDIBLY STRONG ADDING 213,000

00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,968
INCREDIBLY STRONG ADDING 213,000 JOBS LAST MONTH WITH A LOW 4%

JOBS LAST MONTH WITH A LOW 4% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

42
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,671
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. IF THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO

00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,507
IF THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO ADD 200,000 JOBS EACH MONTH, THE

00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,509
ADD 200,000 JOBS EACH MONTH, THE TRADE WAR WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY

00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,543
TRADE WAR WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY HURT TRUMP POLITICALLY.

46
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,579
HURT TRUMP POLITICALLY. BUT IF A DRAWN-OUT TRADE WAR

47
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,581
BUT IF A DRAWN-OUT TRADE WAR TRIGGERS A WAVE OF LAYOFFS AT

48
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,716
TRIGGERS A WAVE OF LAYOFFS AT U.S. EXPORT FIRMS, WELL, THEN

U.S. EXPORT FIRMS, WELL, THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF.

50
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,885
ALL BETS ARE OFF. >> THAT’S REALLY HARD TO

51
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,320
>> THAT’S REALLY HARD TO CALCULATE BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS

52
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,455
CALCULATE BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS MUCH BIGGER, WILDER ANIMAL THAN

53
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,623
MUCH BIGGER, WILDER ANIMAL THAN CAN BE CONTROLLED BY THE

54
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,557
CAN BE CONTROLLED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

55
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,992
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. JOINING US IS FORMER UNDER

PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, FRANK LAVEN.

60
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:49,834
LAVEN. IT’S A DANGEROUS GAME TO PLAY

61
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,602
IT’S A DANGEROUS GAME TO PLAY BECAUSE STEPHANIE IS RIGHT.

62
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,703
BECAUSE STEPHANIE IS RIGHT. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN TRENDING

63
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,039
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN TRENDING LOWER FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND

64
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,440
LOWER FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND CONTINUES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

65
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,209
CONTINUES UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT THERE ARE POTENTIAL

66
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,144
BUT THERE ARE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A

67
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:00,745
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A TRADE WAR.

68
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,346
TRADE WAR. >> I THINK YOU’RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

69
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,081
>> I THINK YOU’RE EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEN YOU PUT IN TARIFFS, YOU’RE

70
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,149
WHEN YOU PUT IN TARIFFS, YOU’RE ADDING COST TO BUSINESS.

71
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,851
ADDING COST TO BUSINESS. YOU’RE HURTING CONSUMERS.

72
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,553
YOU’RE HURTING CONSUMERS. SLOWING DOWN ECONOMIC GROWTH.

73
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,253
SLOWING DOWN ECONOMIC GROWTH. SO IT’S NEVER GOOD NEWS FOR THE

74
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,722
SO IT’S NEVER GOOD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY PUTTING IN TARIFFS.

75
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,424
ECONOMY PUTTING IN TARIFFS. SOMETIMES IT’S A NECESSARY

76
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,259
SOMETIMES IT’S A NECESSARY TACTICAL MOVE TO HELP SOLVE A

77
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,129
TACTICAL MOVE TO HELP SOLVE A PROBLEM, BUT, BOY, DON’T LET IT

78
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,463
PROBLEM, BUT, BOY, DON’T LET IT BECOME AN END IN ITSELF.

79
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,032
BECOME AN END IN ITSELF. BE LIGHT, SHORT TERM IF YOU’LL

80
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:21,766
BE LIGHT, SHORT TERM IF YOU’LL USE TARIFFS.

81
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,502
USE TARIFFS. >> WELL, CHINA AND THE UNITED

82
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,870
>> WELL, CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES BOTH BELIEVE THEY HAVE

83
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,071
STATES BOTH BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE UPPER HAND IN THIS.

84
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,105
THE UPPER HAND IN THIS. THERE’S NO NEGOTIATIONS THAT

85
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,775
THERE’S NO NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE’RE AWARE OF CURRENTLY UNDER

86
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:31,042
WE’RE AWARE OF CURRENTLY UNDER WAY.

87
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,977
WAY. SO BETWEEN THESE -- SO HOW LONG

88
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:33,945
SO BETWEEN THESE -- SO HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON?

89
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:35,780
CAN THIS GO ON? >> WELL, YEAH, STEPH, THAT’S

90
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,215
>> WELL, YEAH, STEPH, THAT’S ALSO REFLECTS THERE’S A

91
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,683
ALSO REFLECTS THERE’S A POLITICAL DIMENSION TO THIS AS

92
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:39,884
POLITICAL DIMENSION TO THIS AS AN ECONOMIC DIMENSION.

93
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,686
AN ECONOMIC DIMENSION. BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR

94
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,053
BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR POLITICS.

95
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,788
POLITICS. NOBODY IN CHINA CAN APPEAR JUST

96
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,790
NOBODY IN CHINA CAN APPEAR JUST TO BE COMPLIANT OR SUBMISSIVE TO

97
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,659
TO BE COMPLIANT OR SUBMISSIVE TO A FOREIGN POWER.

98
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,093
A FOREIGN POWER. SO THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST

99
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,795
SO THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST INITIALLY COME ACROSS AS DEFIANT

100
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,797
INITIALLY COME ACROSS AS DEFIANT AND REBUFF THE UNITED STATES.

101
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,432
AND REBUFF THE UNITED STATES. NOW AFTER A BIT OF A STALEMATE

102
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,501
NOW AFTER A BIT OF A STALEMATE YOU CAN WORK OUT A SOLUTION.

103
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,502
YOU CAN WORK OUT A SOLUTION. I’M GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT

104
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,603
I’M GENERALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE’RE GOING TO GET THERE.

105
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:01,272
WE’RE GOING TO GET THERE. BUT IT MIGHT BE A FEW MONTHS OF

106
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:02,507
BUT IT MIGHT BE A FEW MONTHS OF FRICTION AND BAD ECONOMIC NEWS

107
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:05,276
FRICTION AND BAD ECONOMIC NEWS BEFORE THIS IS FINALLY RESOLVED.

108
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,611
BEFORE THIS IS FINALLY RESOLVED. >> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

109
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,413
>> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TALKING TO NATO COUNTRIES,

110
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:09,714
TALKING TO NATO COUNTRIES, GENERALLY SPEAKING, THOSE

111
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:10,815
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THOSE LEADERS ARE ALL IN A SIMILAR

112
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:11,816
LEADERS ARE ALL IN A SIMILAR POSITION TO HIS, RIGHT?

113
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,618
POSITION TO HIS, RIGHT? STRONG POSITIONS HELP YOU OUT

114
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:14,919
STRONG POSITIONS HELP YOU OUT POLITICALLY, DOMESTICALLY.

115
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,621
POLITICALLY, DOMESTICALLY. BUT WHEN DEALING WITH CHINA, THE

116
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,289
BUT WHEN DEALING WITH CHINA, THE MATH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

117
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,124
MATH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE PRESIDENT XI IS

118
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,525
BECAUSE PRESIDENT XI IS PRESIDENT FOR AS LONG AS HE’D

119
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,793
PRESIDENT FOR AS LONG AS HE’D LIKE TO BE AND THE CHINESE

120
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,295
LIKE TO BE AND THE CHINESE GENERALLY WORK OFF OF FIVE-YEAR

121
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,130
GENERALLY WORK OFF OF FIVE-YEAR AND LONGER PLANS.

122
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:27,099
AND LONGER PLANS. SO THE POLITICAL IMPACT IN CHINA

123
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:28,533
SO THE POLITICAL IMPACT IN CHINA FROM THESE INCREASED COSTS IS

124
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:29,567
FROM THESE INCREASED COSTS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE POLITICAL

125
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:30,535
DIFFERENT FROM THE POLITICAL IMPACT IN AMERICA.

126
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:31,603
IMPACT IN AMERICA. >> YEAH.

127
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,840
>> YEAH. I THINK HE HAS MORE LEEWAY, BUT

128
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:36,842
I THINK HE HAS MORE LEEWAY, BUT HE ALSO HAS A PUBLIC PERSONA AND

129
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,611
HE ALSO HAS A PUBLIC PERSONA AND A PUBLIC ROLE, AND HE HAS TO

130
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,047
A PUBLIC ROLE, AND HE HAS TO POSITION HIMSELF AS THE STEWARD

131
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,282
POSITION HIMSELF AS THE STEWARD OF BROAD, NATIONAL INTEREST.

132
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,450
OF BROAD, NATIONAL INTEREST. SO, YEAH, HE’S NOT GOING TO GET

133
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:46,751
SO, YEAH, HE’S NOT GOING TO GET DAY-TO-DAY CRITICISM, BUT DONALD

134
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,721
DAY-TO-DAY CRITICISM, BUT DONALD TRUMP, THE U.S. PUBLIC WILL GIVE

135
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:51,924
TRUMP, THE U.S. PUBLIC WILL GIVE A U.S. PRESIDENT A LOT OF LEEWAY

136
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,026
A U.S. PRESIDENT A LOT OF LEEWAY AS WELL IF YOU SAY, WE NEED TO

137
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,961
AS WELL IF YOU SAY, WE NEED TO BE TOUGH WITH CHINA, GO BE TOUGH

138
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:56,695
BE TOUGH WITH CHINA, GO BE TOUGH WITH CHINA.

139
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,331
WITH CHINA. IF THAT STARTED HURTING THE

140
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:00,666
IF THAT STARTED HURTING THE OVERALL ECONOMY THEN YOU START

141
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:01,533
OVERALL ECONOMY THEN YOU START PAYING A PRICE FOR IT.

142
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,168
PAYING A PRICE FOR IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING, WHY

143
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,070
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING, WHY DID YOU GET IN A QUARREL WITH

144
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,538
DID YOU GET IN A QUARREL WITH CANADA ABOUT MILK AND GERMANY

145
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:07,072
CANADA ABOUT MILK AND GERMANY ABOUT STEEL.

146
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,540
ABOUT STEEL. ARE THESE FRONT AND CENTER

147
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:08,874
ARE THESE FRONT AND CENTER ISSUES?

148
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,476
ISSUES? ARE THESE REALLY AS IMPORTANT AS

149
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:10,776
ARE THESE REALLY AS IMPORTANT AS CHINA?

150
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:11,777
CHINA? >> IT’S INTERESTING YOU SAY

151
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:12,077
>> IT’S INTERESTING YOU SAY THAT.
