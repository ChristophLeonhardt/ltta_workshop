US prosecutors have admitted to falsely accusing an alleged Russian spy of offering sex in exchange for employment Maria boo sinner is currently in custody awaiting trial over the claims in July butanna was arrested on charges of acting as a foreign agent without registering with the US government Russia though says her arrest is politically motivated but in a court filing prosecutors said the accusations were based on text messages and other information they'd obtained but conceded they were wrongly interpreted and they maintained the need to keep her in custody though over questions about her relationship with an individual identified as a u.s. person one it was allegedly conservative political operative Paul Erickson a human rights loyd ankov alex says Putin his case was used to undermine the recent summit between President Trump and Putin I think in order to bootstrap a pretty weak claim against her they originally added these salacious claims of her offering sex for employment which frankly wouldn't rise to the level of a federal case anyway but frankly in order to destroy her reputation which they probably have effectively done at this point now ultimately I think the case will be dismissed I think there's nothing here I think this was a political gambit frankly to deal with bigger geopolitical issues to try to ruin you know the outcome of the summit between Trump and Putin she's being used as a political pawn by the United States and these cases these charges will be dropped but in the meantime a life will be destroyed you
