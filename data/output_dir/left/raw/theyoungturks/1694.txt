1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,510
THE TRIP IN MINISTRATION IS
ANNOUNCED A NEW CRACKDOWN ON

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,660
IMMIGRANT FAMILIES CROSSING THE
BORDER AND IN DOING SO THEY ARE

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,790
SHOWING A WILLINGNESS TO
PROSECUTE AND EVEN SEPARATE

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,250
FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE RARELY
SEEN IN RECENT HISTORY.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,210
UP UNTIL RIGHT NOW, CROSSING
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY IS A

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:30,919
MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO
SIX MONTHS 

7
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:52,000
IN JAIL.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,420
IN THEORY THEY COULD OF BEEN
LOCKED UP BUT IT WAS NOT

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,870
TYPICALLY THE CASE THAT WOULD
HAPPEN.

10
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:07,830
ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN AREAS.

11
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:18,430
IT 

12
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,430
REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
WHEN YOU GET DONE WITH THE

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,430
SENTENCE.

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,690
THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING BY 
THE

15
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:46,290
WAY.

16
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,840
WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF
THING THAT WOULD PROTECT HER

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,310
FAMILY FROM BEING SEPARATED
HOWEVER NOW IT WILL NOT.

18
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,280
IN SAN DIEGO THEY DID NOT TARGET
FAMILIES LIKE THIS.

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,690
THAT IS APPARENTLY NOT THE CASE
PREVIOUSLY BUT NOW THEY ARE

20
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,810
GOING TO BE DOING THAT.

21
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,190
>>SO THEY ARE WASTING A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

22
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,030
TAXPAYER MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO ARE
NOT DANGEROUS.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:14,490
THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO LET
THE KIDS GO IN THREE WEEKS.

24
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,599
IT WAS PREVIOUSLY NOT A PROBLEM
UNTIL THE TRUMPET MINISTRATION

25
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,120
SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO LOCK UP
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS FOR LONGER

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,830
EVEN THOUGH WHAT THEY ARE DOING
IS AT BEST A MISDEMEANOR BY

27
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,670
CROSSING THE BORDER.

28
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,349
IN SOME CASES THEY ARE TRYING TO
SEEK ASYLUM.

29
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,340
BUT THEY SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE RIGHT PORT OF ENTRY SO

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,700
I'M GOING TO IMPRISON YOU FOR
SIX MONTHS, THEN TAKE YOUR

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,549
KIDS AWAY AND RELEASE THEM IN
THREE WEEKS.

32
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:47,209
KNOWS WHERE YOUR KIDS ARE GOING
TO GO AND HOW LONG WE WILL

33
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,430
KEEP YOU IMPRISON.

34
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,019
BUT AS A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE TO
ADD.

35
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,720
JEFF SESSIONS SAYS THERE IS
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,590
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
MINISTRATIONS DID, YOU HAVE

37
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,689
A WHOLE SET OF CHOICES.

38
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:06,540
YOU ARE CHOOSING TO BREAK THIS
FAMILIES APART AND CHOOSING TO

39
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,430
BE DRACONIAN AND WASTE A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUR

40
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,040
RESOURCES FIGHTING PEOPLE WHO
ARE NOT DANGEROUS THEREBY ALSO

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,409
NOT SPENDING RESOURCES ON PEOPLE
WHO ARE DANGEROUS.

42
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,579
>>TO BE FAIR THIS IS ONE OF THE
AREAS WHERE THEY ARE VERY

43
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,450
CLEAR WHAT THEY WOULD DO.

44
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,590
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WANT TO
BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALL THE

45
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,680
SAME ACROSS ADMINISTRATIONS BUT
SOME OF THE TRUMPETS AND HE

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,310
PUTS PEOPLE LIKE JEFF SESSIONS
THERE, HE KNOWS HIS BASE WANTS

47
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,919
HIM TO BE CRACKING DOWN ON THESE
PEOPLE, SO HE'S GOING TO DO IT.

48
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,430
HE'S WASTING TONS OF MONEY ALONG
THE WAY.

49
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,569
>> IMMIGRATION PROSECUTIONS
HAVE TAKEN UP ABOUT HALF THE

50
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,779
CRIMINAL DOCKET SINCE 2008.

51
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:49,310
BUSH CHANGE THE PROCEDURE THERE.

52
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,680
ALL OF A SUDDEN INSTEAD OF GOING
AFTER VIOLENT CRIMINALS THE

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,892
FEDERAL DOCKET IS FULL TO THE
BRIM WITH CRIMINALS

54
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,329
CROSSING THE BORDER.

55
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,349
BUT OBAMA DID NOT CHANGE THE
POLICY AND HE CONTINUED.

56
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:09,749
NOT TRUMP COMES IN AND PUTS 
IT

57
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,749
ON STEROIDS.

58
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:15,319
NOW WE ARE GOING TO WASTE EVEN
MORE MONEY.

59
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,970
AND BY THE WAY WHEN OUR
ANCESTORS DO?

60
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,970
MAYBE I'M EXEMPT

61
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:27,630
BECAUSE WE CAME OVER LEGALLY.

62
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,810
IF YOU ARE HERE IN AMERICA
EARLIER DID YOU COME WITH

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,930
PAPERS?

64
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:52,430
DID PILGRIMS HAVE
PAPERS?

65
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,250
I DON'T THINK SO.

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,509
SO NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING HALF OF
OUR FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR

67
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,650
PROSECUTION GOING TOWARDS THAT
WASTE OF MONEY WHICH COULD'VE

68
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,310
APPLIED TO ALMOST ALL OF US, WE
ARE NOW HAVING EVEN MORE

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,120
RESOURCES WASTED.

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,009
THE ONE PART I WILL AGREE
WITH JOHN ON 100%

71
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,509
IS THIS IS WHAT YOU VOTED FOR.

72
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,330
IT'S NOT LIKE HE DIDN'T SAY HE
WAS GOING TO GO AFTER

73
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,710
PEOPLE WHO CROSS THE BORDER.

74
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,490
HE SAID ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

75
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,940
IS GOING TO TRY TO CRUSH

76
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,949
FAMILIES IN SOME CASES ESCAPING
FROM OPPRESSION AND THEN

77
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,600
SPLIT THEIR FAMILIES APART.

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,030
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT
BOMBING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE

79
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,080
EAST?

80
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,180
HE SAID THEY ARE
TERRORISTS.

81
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,800
BY THE WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
CIVILIANS NOT TERRORISTS

82
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,280
THAT WE KILLED.

83
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,349
ARE YOU SURPRISED IS GOING AFTER
PEOPLE'S FAMILY?

84
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,490
HE SAID HE

85
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,139
WOULD MURDER THE FAMILY MEMBERS
OF PEOPLE HE CONSIDERED

86
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,539
TERRORISTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
AND HE SAID HE WOULD GO AFTER

87
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,419
PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER IN
DRACONIAN WAYS.

88
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,289
I GUESS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

89
00:06:16,289 --> 00:00:00,000
CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA.
