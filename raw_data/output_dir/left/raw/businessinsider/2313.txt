00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,250
welcome back<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we're talking to</font>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,380
Dennis Crowley co founder of foursquare

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,379
tell us what's foursquare again because

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,080
i'm not you know they were building

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,400
things for mobile phones that are

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,719
supposed to makes it easier to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,460
it combines friend finders with social

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,900
city guides with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of layer</font>

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,090
of game mechanics on top to reward

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,980
people for doing interesting things so

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you said something interesting the other</font>

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,150
day we wrote a story about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,260
is coming out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own little</font>

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,060
check-in feature and you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by</font>

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of 2010 you expect check-ins to</font>

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,599
be a commodity that's interesting what

17
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,430
did you mean by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think well I mean</font>

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,600
everyone's kind of getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,460
check-in game and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it back in the day with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dodgeball we</font>

21
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">start a bunch of competitors and that</font>

22
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before the day where everyone was</font>

23
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,829
come sharing data and now that you know

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,290
open api's of the norm I imagine that

25
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,399
there'll be a lot of services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

26
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,230
offering check-in services or check<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

27
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,370
functionality and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

28
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,260
eventually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some common place and a</font>

29
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,340
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> applications be able to</font>

30
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,170
push and pull from them so how does how

31
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,329
does foursquare you know how do you make

32
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so it's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than a commodity on</font>

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,210
foursquare what do you do to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

34
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,850
people incentivize them to keep checking

35
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">in yeah well we always thought the thing</font>

36
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,609
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken with dodge ball was</font>

37
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,099
there was no incentive to check in and

38
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,420
you know the big thing that's different

39
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,340
in foursquare is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try to curate that</font>

40
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,659
experience so something different

41
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,880
happens every time like you might get

42
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,530
notified about a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's nearby</font>

43
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,360
Mike SR some point see my turn some

44
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,860
badges and I think the sweet spot is

45
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
kind of curating that experience so that

46
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is fun to check in every time and you</font>

47
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,820
want to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it over and over</font>

48
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,619
again there's this perception out there

49
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,420
that four squares killer app for New

50
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,100
York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City then it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> popular on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

51
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,500
coast even San Francisco how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

52
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,880
you think that's a fair perception and

53
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,340
and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do you break into</font>

54
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,770
mainstream America what is what i call

55
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,479
the normals yeah well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i think</font>

56
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff is always going to work in</font>

57
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,950
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas of high density at</font>

58
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,630
high density of people or places or

59
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,619
things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and it just so happened</font>

60
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,909
that that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know those normally</font>

61
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,100
overlap with large cities that being

62
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,450
said I mean there's pockets of density

63
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,140
everywhere you go and college campuses

64
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,340
you know II used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that it doesn't</font>

65
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,689
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works so great in Boston</font>

66
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,520
it works in certain pockets of Boston or

67
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,869
doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so great in New York it</font>

68
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,189
works in certain pockets of New York

69
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,320
sure so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big challenge for us is you</font>

70
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,540
know how do you expend that or extend

71
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,369
that use case to folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are outside</font>

72
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,899
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those larger areas and so some of the</font>

73
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,280
stuff that we're doing with partnering

74
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,639
with larger media companies or

75
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,840
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to offer a greater</font>

76
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,920
breadth of functionality kind of

77
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,660
addresses those issues you sold your

78
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,490
last startup dodgeball to<font color="#CCCCCC"> google and</font>

79
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,440
Google's going on a massive acquisition

80
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,640
spree now they say they're going to buy

81
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,590
a company a month it's google good at

82
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,050
acquiring companies or<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrating them</font>

83
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,610
you know you left after a couple years

84
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,010
but I think it depends you know we were

85
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we were there in a really</font>

86
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,620
interesting time when I think you know

87
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,420
the New York office was was really just

88
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to ramp up and I don't think</font>

89
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the right time for us to be</font>

90
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,080
there I think you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

91
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,820
evaluate it on a case-by-case basis and

92
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it depends on how large the</font>

93
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,390
company is and what and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

94
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the company is actually doing and how</font>

95
00:02:42,470 --> 00:00:00,000
that fits into the larger plans
