big news yesterday obviously was the death of Barbara Bush the Barbara Bush the wife to one president and the mother of another the universal admiration for Barbara Bush was really something nice I think in an era where everybody seems to be at each other's throats over politics a couple of things are worth noting right off the bat first of all if you look at all the obituaries it says that Barbara Bush was most famous obviously for as I say being the wife of one president in the mother of another there's this weird idea that goes around in feminist circles that being a wife and being a mother is somehow degrading to women that somehow it is it is what you do not in your relationship with others but what you do in your career that matters most well for the vast majority of human beings it is what you do in your family life and the kind of children that you raise that is going to be your final legacy on the world right Barbara Bush said this herself in 1990 she was speaking at Wellesley shoes protested in 1990 so this just shows how long these college protests have been going on but Barbara Bush who was then first lady of the United States she talked about why family was valuable in life in 1990 at a graduation so I want to offer a new legend the winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her dream not society's dreams her own personal dream who knows somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse and I wish him well he's up yeah she's a person who definitely understood the value of family one of the charming clips those going around yesterday as well as a clip from 2011 George HW Bush and Barbara were on the Today Show together and and they read with their granddaughter actually and george w bush's daughter and they they read George HW read some love letters that he'd written too to Barbara and you can sort of see their relationship encapsulated in this in this short clip on December 12 1943 my darling bar this should be a very easy letter to write my grandparents have been writing each other love letters for more than 60 years I love you precious with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life six 1994 for Barbara Pierce from gh WB will you marry me oops I forgot you did that 49 years ago today I was very happy on that day in 1945 I'm even happier today you give me joy that few men know I've climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world but even that cannot hold a candle to being Barbara's husband my mom used to tell me now George don't walk ahead you never listen to your mother little did I know I was only trying to keep up keep up with bar bar Pearce from on her darkest Street in Rye New York I love you I love you too why are we such Criers you know what you could be Speaker of the House okay so impoverish issues definitely a pistol is a good piece in the new york times by Christopher Buckley who is a a novelist and speechwriter for VP HW from 81 to 83 then he talks about exactly who Barbara Bush was he said that he learned a couple of lessons from her he said there was no false and he no pretense no guy almost spin no art to Barbara Bush who died on Tuesday she was what-you-see-is-what-you-get about the letter Americans are always clamoring about the virtues of transparency Barbara Bush was as transparent as distilled water whoo but she would have said of her own adored son as he weighed a campaign for the presidency if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office that's silly there are a lot of great families there are other people out there that are very qualified we've had enough bushes thanks mom if she was mrs. no-nonsense she also to playful leave in girlish side to her on one occasion I was alone in a freight elevator with mr. and mrs. Bush and their Secret Service detail when it got stuck between floors stuck elevators are viewed grimly by the Secret Service the atmosphere quickly elevated to condition read with hands reaching for the holstered glock nines orders brockton to wrist mics and all the rest the bushes were blithe I was standing behind them mr. Bush's fingers reached for mrs. Bush's derriere and gave it a pinch she turned to him and grin like an 18 year old hiya fellow she said so I can claim to have witnessed a primal scene between mom and dad Bush so just you know she was apparently a really really good woman by virtually all accounts and there were tributes that came in from the Clintons their tribute tributes that came in from the Obamas in class all across the aisle
