1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:01,859
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT SAYING

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,528
ABOUT THIS MATTER SO FAR TODAY?

3
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:05,396
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

4
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:06,798
WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THE

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,133
PRESIDENT WOULD REACH OUT TO

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,936
KING SALMAN ON THIS VERY TOPIC

7
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:15,707
GIVEN THE KING ORDERED THE

8
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:16,641
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO

9
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,275
KHASHOGGI'S DISAPPEARANCE.

10
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:18,142
ON TWITTER THE PRESIDENT IS

11
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,944
TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING.

12
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:22,013
LET ME TAKE YOU THERE AND SHARE

13
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:23,214
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

14
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:25,850
JUST SPOKE TO THE KING OF SAUDI

15
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,518
ARABIA WHO DENIES ANY KNOWLEDGE

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,654
OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE HAPPENED

17
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,723
TO OUR SAUDI ARABIAIAN CITIZEN.

18
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:33,591
HE SAYS THEY'RE WORKING CLOSELY

19
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,827
WITH TURKEY TO FIND ANSWERS.

20
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:36,994
I'M SENDING OUR SECRETARY OF

21
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,797
STATE TO MEET WITH THE KING.

22
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:40,531
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT INDEED.

23
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:43,301
THAT INVESTIGATION THAT I TOLD

24
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:45,369
YOU ABOUT INTO THE

25
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,705
DISAPPEARANCE IS BEING LED BY

26
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:49,607
THE KINGDOM'S COP PROSECUTOR AS

27
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,410
A RESULT OF THE NOT SO SUBTLE

28
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,811
MESSAGE FROM WASHINGTON THAT

29
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:54,746
THE SAUDIS NEEDED TO DO

30
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:55,113
SOMETHING.

31
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,348
WHEN HE WAS ASKED LAST NIGHT IF

32
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,917
HE THOUGHT THE SAUDIS WERE

33
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:01,085
BEHIND THE JOURNALISTS

34
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:01,819
DISAPPEARANCE THE PRESIDENT ON

35
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,155
60 MINUTES SAID THIS.

36
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,323
>> President Trump: NOBODY

37
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:05,823
KNOWS YET.

38
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,658
WE'LL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO FIND

39
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:08,159
OUT.

40
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,560
IT IS BEING INVESTIGATED AND

41
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:10,962
LOOKED AT VERY, VERY STRONGLY.

42
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:13,397
WE WOULD BE VERY UPSET AND

43
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,266
ANGRY IF THAT WERE THE CASE.

44
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,468
THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE.

45
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:18,636
MAYBE ESPECIALLY SO BECAUSE

46
00:01:18,637 --> 00:01:20,204
THIS MAN WAS A REPORTER.

47
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,472
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE

48
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:24,509
BOTTOM OF IT AND THERE WILL BE

49
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,910
SEVERE PUNISHMENT.

50
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,545
>> SEVERE PUNISHMENT AS IN

51
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,079
POSSIBLE SANCTIONS.

52
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,413
I THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT,

53
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:31,516
BILL, TO LET THE FOLKS AT HOME

54
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,985
KNOW THE SAUDIS AREN'T GOING TO

55
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:34,886
TAKE SANCTIONS LIKELY SAYING

56
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,221
THEY WOULD HIT US WITH OIL

57
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,856
PRICES THAT WOULD TOP $200 A

58
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,258
BARREL IF THEY'RE HIT WITH

59
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:40,625
SANCTIONS.

60
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:42,260
A BACK AND FORTH FROM

61
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,795
WASHINGTON AND RIYADH ALREADY.

62
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,696
>> Bill: NOW THE OTHER BIG

63
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,565
STORY IS WHAT WAS LEFT UNSAID I

64
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,433
THINK YOU COULD ARGUE FROM THE

65
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:52,203
60 MINUTES INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT.

66
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:53,738
THE FATE OF JAMES MATTIS.

67
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,674
IS HE STAYING OR ON HIS WAY OUT

68
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:57,141
SOMEDAY SOON?

69
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,643
>> OH, IF I KNEW I WOULD MAKE

70
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,878
SOME MONEY ON IT.

71
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,080
I SPOKE WITH A SENIOR WHITE

72
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,749
HOUSE OFFICIAL AN HOUR AGO AND

73
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,851
SHE SAID EVERYBODY LEAVES AT

74
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:07,552
SOME POINT, EVERYBODY.

75
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:09,654
EVEN ME AT SOME POINT I'LL BE

76
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:10,121
OUT OF HERE.

77
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:14,592
NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY, BILL,

78
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,526
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON

79
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:17,895
MATTIS WERE MEANT TO TELL

80
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:24,001
GRAFSH HIS DEPARTURE OR -- THE

81
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,737
WAY THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THE

82
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:27,939
GENERAL SENT THE SPECULATION

83
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,539
ENGINE INTO OVERDRIVE.

84
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,774
>> President Trump: IT COULD BE

85
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,241
THAT HE IS.

86
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:31,642
I THINK HE IS SORT OF A

87
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:34,011
DEMOCRAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

88
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,646
THE TRUTH BUT GENERAL MATTIS IS

89
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:36,480
A GOOD GUY.

90
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,182
WE GET ALONG VERY WELL.

91
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,383
HE MAY LEAVE.

92
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:42,186
AT SOME POINT EVERYBODY LEAVES.

93
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:42,553
EVERYBODY.

94
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:42,987
PEOPLE LEAVE.

95
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,789
THAT'S WASHINGTON

96
00:02:44,790 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
