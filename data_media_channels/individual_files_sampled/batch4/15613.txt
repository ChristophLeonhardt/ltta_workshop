I see em research just released the latest polls on voting intentions and it shows that Jeremy Corbyn could potentially win a general election or at least form a coalition with the Greens liberals and the SNP in the 2017 general election probably one of the most bizarre elections in British history the IRA sympathizing far-left Labour leader managed to gain his party 30 seats and achieved 40 percent of the vote that was despite his party having rallied against brexit and the electorate having only voted to leave the European Union the summer previous Tereza may tried to increase her majority but the risk totally backfired and she lost 13 seats that meant that the Tories lost their majority in parliament and ever since the House of Commons has been skating on thin ice with European Union sharks snapping at their ankles beneath them korben Easter's despite Corbin's traditional support for brexit are hoping the ice cracks and then they can go and cozy up with the sharks but teresa has had to put on a brave face and try and push drags it through with a precarious deal with Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party in short it's a mess and in the face of such uncertainty it seems surprising that the public would be willing to shake things up even more and hand our government over to a man who will put Diane Abbott in charge of national security and immigration reduce the tax threshold and hurt working-class families and welcomed in even greater numbers of immigrants than the conservative to resume but that's exactly what the numbers seem to show ICM has just announced that if an election would be held today the Labour Party would achieve 43 percent of the vote the Conservatives are 2% of the vote the Lib Dems 7 percent of the vote you get 3 percent in the Greens 2 percent that means the Lib Dems will maintain around 12 seats perhaps they lose a seat or two which is interesting the Lib Dems are the most Pro EU party in England they're quite open about their desire to ignore the results of the referendum and stop brexit but perhaps their supporters realize that they have well a better shot supporting Corbin in the labour party and then there's the issue of the total collapse of UK in 2017 their vote share was reduced to 1.8 percent from 12.6% in the general election but the three percent claimed by ICM research doesn't necessarily mean that you keep support is growing again in the face of an uncertain brexit in 2015 you keep studying almost every seat in the country with 614 candidates that figure was almost cut in half to 378 in 2017 ICM research shows three percent support across the country and given the current financial state of UK its disaster with former leader henry bolton and potential bankruptcy coming from a six hundred and sixty thousand pound legal bill it's hardly likely that they could muster up even 300 candidates in a snap election maybe 200 maybe maybe even 100 and failure to stand in enough seats in a general election would mean their support drops under 1.8% maybe under one percentage point and that leaves Britain in in quite a scary position I don't for a moment think that the combination of Labour's 43 percent the Lib Dems 7 percent and the Greens 2 percent means that a majority of the British people want breaks it stops I think the voters believe whoever they vote for will respect the will of their people and follow through with brexit that shows the faith and the decency of the British people and perhaps the naivety for placing faith in someone like Corbin but if Theresa May doesn't step up and do the right thing and scrap the transition period stop free movement and stand up to the tyrants in Brussels then who knows what might happen delay tactics and constant missteps by Theresa May could easily create doubts in the British voters and clearly we're seeing that by the latest poll results at this point I'm genuinely scared UKIP's pandering to the left and its refusal to deal with issues like jihad in crime it's potential bankruptcy and its general mismanagement has created a void in British politics perhaps that's where the likes of Amory waters and for Britain comes in but combined this temporary void with desperation and a lack of faith in Theresa May and we're creating a perfect environment for real socialists and Marxists to enter government and that won't just mean that brags it gets scrapped it means that Britain would be permanently transformed you you
