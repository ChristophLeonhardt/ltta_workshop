our landscape in the middle east has seen saudi arabia in israel gravitate towards each other over a mutual dislike of urine it's very clear we Israel and Saudi Arabia are practically on the same side all Sunni countries are against Iran and while both countries and I having any official diplomatic channels whispers are growing behind the scenes about the extent of their cooperation last month an Israeli military chief of staff was quoted as saying he was on the exact same page with the Saudis when it concerns Iran I was sitting there listening to the remarks of a Saudi general feeling like it could have been me saying the exact same thing it was like he was reading my own overview of the situation so a definite psychic bond building there that was until Trump threw a wrench in the works by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital therefore I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel Saudi Arabia joins the Muslim world's chorus of condemnation saying East Jerusalem should be recognized as the Palestinian capital a thought backed by its arch rivals in Tehran we condemn the u.s. decision on Jerusalem because of its great bias against the historical and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem yet as a Humaira every possible step must be taken to prevent the implementation of this illegal action by the US administration however there is one question that sticks out here what factors and elements made it possible for the US presence to dare to take such an outrageous a Saudi Arabia got cozy with Israel and balance ties with regional Muslim allies turkey jumped in with president aired on gathering Muslim nations and Istanbul to condemn Trump's call in Jerusalem and it was there that Saudi Arabia reversed back to being on the same side with Iran and against Israel Saudi Arabia with the majority of Arab states actually are adding towards establishing a certain alliance between them and Israel and the pretext of facing the Iranian threat this alliance is pushed forward by the United States of America as part of its grand strategy the so these support Donald Trump's move because they want to dissolve and get rid of the Palestinian cause and as an obstacle towards establishing an alliance with Israel however they cannot be open in their position because this would embarrass them throughout the Arab Islamic world and now the region is again left on a precipice where sides will eventually need to be taken Israel is attempting to calm the waters by saying they're ready to settle the issue with Palestine and have invited Riyadh into the peace process I suggest that Saudi Arabia as the leader of the Arab world take upon itself this initiative and go to the Palestinians and offer their patronage they are too weak they need someone to help them King Salman should come give patronage to and lead the peace initiative with the Palestinians and the US meanwhile the Saudi foreign minister says the Kingdom has a roadmap to establish full diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv should there be a peace agreement with the Palestinians but the question remains will Saudi Arabia find a way to keep everyone happy and if not who will be left out in the cold this time
