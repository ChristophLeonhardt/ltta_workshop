00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,306
>> THEY START TO DO MORE, THEY

192
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,875
START TO HAVE MORE.

193
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,942
>> Tucker: YOU ARE THE PEOPLE

194
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:53,676
LAUGHING AT THE END OF WHAT HE

195
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:56,546
SAID, RIGHT?

196
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,581
>> HE'S COMMITTING THE OFFER IN

197
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,149
BROAD DAYLIGHT.

198
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,350
>> Tucker: WHY DIDN'T HE JUST

199
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,085
ASKED HER ALL THE MANY RUSSIAN

200
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,386
AGENTS?

201
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:03,920
>> LET ME CONTINUE.

202
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,121
>> Tucker: THOSE ARE FOR

203
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:05,688
QUESTIONS, RIGHT?

204
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:10,727
IS A LITTLE CONFUSING.

205
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,061
>> WHY WOULDN'T HE ADMIT TO

206
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,530
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN PUBLIC

207
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,764
YOU LET THEIRS KNOW THEY ARE SO

208
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:15,932
STUPID THEY COMMIT THE CRIME AND

209
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:17,167
PUBLIC EXCEPTION.

210
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,134
HE DID IT.

211
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,536
>> Tucker: HAS ANY AGENT EVER

212
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:23,973
BROADCAST A MESSAGE TO HIS

213
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,008
HANDLERS EVER?

214
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:25,909
>> HAS ANY BUSINESS BEEN EVER

215
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,378
BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT?

216
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,179
HE MADE THE INVITATION IN PUBLIC

217
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,346
AND THEN YOU START TO SEE DURING

218
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:33,283
THE SUMMER OF 2016 -- WE HAVE AN

219
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,151
EMAIL THAT IS TITLED KREMLIN

220
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:38,555
CONNECTION, AN OFFER MADE TO

221
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,224
PAUL ERICKSON OF THE CAMPAIGN TO

222
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:41,858
CONNECT DONALD TRUMP AND

223
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:42,425
VLADIMIR PUTIN AGAIN.

224
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,327
KREMLIN CONNECTION.

225
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:47,597
>> Tucker: DID THEY CONNECT?

226
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,332
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THEY

227
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:49,999
CONNECTED.

228
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:50,934
>> Tucker: WHERE'S THE

229
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,735
EVIDENCE?

230
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:53,770
>> FIRST, DON'T CONFUSE EVIDENCE

231
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,938
WITH A CONCLUSION.

232
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,673
EVIDENCE GIVES THE FBI AND THE

233
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,307
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE --

234
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,341
>> Tucker: WHERE'S THE SMOKING

235
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,776
GUN?

236
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,543
I WATCHED RACHEL MADDOW.

237
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:01,411
I GET IT.

238
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:02,812
THERE ARE A LOT OF RUSSIANS AND

239
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:03,580
RUSSIAN PEOPLE AND EMAILS, BUT

240
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,815
WHERE IS THE ACTUAL PROOF THAT

241
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:06,549
SOMETHING HAPPENED AFTER MORE

242
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,351
THAN A YEAR OF THIS?

243
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,587
>> I DON'T HAVE SUBPOENA POWER.

244
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,187
BOB MUELLER DOES.

245
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,255
>> Tucker: YOU HAVE HIGH

246
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:13,590
SECURITY CLEARANCE ANYWHERE ON

247
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,324
THE INTEL COMMITTEE.

248
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:15,058
PRESUMABLY YOU HAVE MORE THAN

249
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:17,026
LIKE A CLIP OF HIM AT A PRESS

250
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:17,794
CONFERENCE.

251
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,862
>> I'M ONLY GIVING YOU THE

252
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:20,363
EVIDENCE I'VE SEEN IN AN

253
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:20,897
UNCLASSIFIED MANNER.

254
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:22,665
I'M TELLING YOU ALL OF THAT

255
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:23,733
WARRANTS LOOKING AT WHETHER OR

256
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,935
NOT WE CAN PROVE BEYOND A

257
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:26,669
REASONABLE DOUBT CONSPIRACY TO

258
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,371
DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES.

259
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,606
>> Tucker: ARE WE WORKING ON

260
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:29,906
THAT?

261
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,941
WE'VE BEEN AT IT FOR A LONG TIME

262
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:32,442
WE'VE BEEN AT IT FOR A LONG TIM

263
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:32,742
TIME.

264
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,676
>> NOT WITH THE OBSTRUCTION THAT

265
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:35,645
WE CONTINUE TO SEE.

266
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,548
>> Tucker: THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

267
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:38,948
>> NO.

268
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,350
>> Tucker: WITH THE PART WE

269
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,184
HAVEN'T HEARD?

270
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:41,584
I'M WAITING.

271
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,318
>> IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

272
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:42,619
NOSE.

273
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,721
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER NOSE.

274
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,390
>> Tucker: MORE SECRET

275
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,757
MESSAGES?

276
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:49,225
>> WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THIS IN

277
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,660
25 YEARS WE WILL BE AMAZED AT

278
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,494
HOW MUCH OF IT WAS RIGHT IN

279
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,262
FRONT OF US.

280
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,430
SO THEY ARE HACKING.

281
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,165
>> Tucker: WE ARE ALL SPEAKING

282
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,468
CHINESE AT THAT POINT AND PEOPLE

283
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,235
ARE LIKE PEOPLE THOUGHT RUSSIA

284
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,603
WAS THE THREAT.

285
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,471
>> THEY NEVER TURNED OUT ANY OF

286
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:03,172
THE APPROACHES.

287
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,173
THE CANDIDATE MAKES AN

288
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,341
INVITATION IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

289
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,776
THEY CONTINUE TO TRY AND ARRANGE

290
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:07,844
MEETINGS THROUGH THE SUMMER AND

291
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,846
THEN YOU START TO HAVE WHAT I

292
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
CALL -- IF THERE'S A QUIT BROKE

293
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:19,155
WHILE THERE HAS TO BE A QUO.

294
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,356
CANDIDATES POSITIVE FAVORABLE

295
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:20,957
STATEMENTS ABOUT PUTIN.

296
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,825
EVEN IF THOSE ARE AS YOU SAID SO

297
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:23,793
WE HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP.

298
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,895
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE NATIONAL

299
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,997
SECURITY ADVISOR, MICHAEL FLYNN,

300
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:29,432
WHO HAD BEEN OVER TO RUSSIA JUST

301
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:31,200
A YEAR BEFORE TELLING THE

302
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,769
RUSSIANS DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE

303
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:33,670
BARACK OBAMA IMPOSED SANCTIONS.

304
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,205
HOW DO YOU ASK WHEN THAT?

305
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,807
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN BRINGING THE

306
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:38,975
RUSSIANS INTO THE OVAL OFFICE

307
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,543
AND GIVING THEM NATIONAL

308
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:40,944
SECURITY --

309
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:41,678
>> Tucker: HERE'S WHAT I WOULD

310
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:42,845
HOPE, THAT WE WOULD STOP WITH

311
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:43,980
THE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA.

312
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,381
I THINK THEY ARE

313
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,382
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BUT THE TRUMP

314
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,151
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE JUST THE

315
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:48,585
OPPOSITE.

316
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:49,786
WE SENT JAVELIN MISSILES TO THE

317
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:50,587
UKRAINIAN REBELS.

318
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,021
WE HAVE OPENED UP DOMESTIC OIL

319
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,556
PRODUCTION HERE, WHICH HURTS

320
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,357
THEM IN GAS PRODUCTION.

321
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,960
WE HAVE KILLED OVER 200 RUSSIANS

322
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,927
IN SYRIA.

323
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,530
WE HAVE BOMBED THE GOVERNMENT,

324
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,864
WHICH IS THEIR CLOSEST ALLY

325
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:02,832
OUTSIDE THE BORDERS.

326
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,767
IN WHAT SENSE HAS HE BEEN

327
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,568
PRO-RUSSIA AS PRESIDENT?

328
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,669
I SAY THIS WITH SADNESS BECAUSE

329
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:07,537
I DON'T THINK       THINK YOU SO

330
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:07,570
I DON'T THINK       THINK YOU SL

331
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:07,604
I DON'T THINK       THINK YOU S

332
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:07,837
I DON'T THINK       THINK YOU SE

333
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:10,173
DOING ANYTHING.

334
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:11,074
>> ALL THE FAVORABLE THINGS,

335
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,008
BRINGING RUSSIANS INTO THE

336
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,910
OVAL OFFICE, KICKING OUT

337
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,744
AMERICANS.

338
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:27,023
FAILURE TO IMPOSE THE

339
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:27,590
CONGRESSIONALLY PASSED

340
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:27,957
SANCTIONS.

341
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:28,625
YOU KNOW HOW HARD WE HAD TO

342
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:28,925
WORK?

343
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,626
>> Tucker: WHAT ABOUT KILLING

344
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,126
THE 200 RUSSIANS?

345
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:30,660
>> DID HE KILL THEM?

346
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,327
>> Tucker: HE SENT THE U.S.

347
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:31,694
MILITARY.

348
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:32,428
>> I THINK YOU GIVE HIM TOO MUCH

349
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:32,761
CREDIT.

350
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,429
>> Tucker: ARE NOT FLAGGING

351
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:33,796
FOR TRUMP.

352
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:34,530
I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD'VE DONE

353
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:34,831
IT IT.

354
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:35,732
I CREDIT        HER TO SIZED HIM

355
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:35,765
I CREDIT        HER TO SIZED HIO

I CREDIT        HER TO SIZED HI.

362
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,533
HE'S KILLED 200 RUSSIANS, OBAMA

363
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,967
DID NOT DO THAT.

364
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,470
HE SENT MISSILES TO UKRAINIAN

365
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:40,803
REBELS.

366
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:41,938
OBAMA DID NOT DO THAT.

367
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,207
HE IS COMPETING WITH ENERGY AND

368
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,608
WEIGHS OBAMA'S NEVER TRY.

369
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,976
WHY IS HE MORE PRO-RUSSIAN THAT

370
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,978
OBAMA WAS?

371
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,980
>> DON'T EXCUSE WHAT HE HAS TO

372
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,981
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT --

373
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:52,682
YOU ARE GIVING HIM TOO MUCH

374
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,784
CREDIT.

375
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,754
