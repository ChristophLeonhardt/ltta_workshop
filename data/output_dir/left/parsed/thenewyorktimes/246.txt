The YouTube shooter,
Nasim Aghdam,
was widely known on 
Iranian social media
as Nasim Sabz, which 
means “Green Nasim,”
because of her advocacy for 
animal rights, healthy living
and veganism.
Her specific style of videos
made her relatively
famous among Iran’s growing
YouTube and Instagram influencers.
For instance, one showing
a rabbit where she explains
the differences
between vegetarianism
and being vegan.
In another video, 
she explains the benefits
of eating a papaya.
One of her most
well-known videos here
is one where she’s
wearing a revealing purple dress.
Don’t believe what
you see, is a message
appearing in the video screen.
“I’m being discriminated,
and filtered on YouTube,
and I’m not the only one.”
“And if you go and
check my videos,
you see that my
new videos hardly get views.”
She also criticizes YouTube,
and makes a physical protest,
a year ago, by going on the
streets, posting what she claims
to be a picture of herself
holding up a sign saying,
“YouTube dictatorship.”
And then there is a video that
gives more insight, if you will,
into the life of Ms. Aghdam.
She had fled her native
Iran decades ago.
In that video, she explains
that even though
she was a member of
the Baha'i faith,
which is a persecuted
faith in Iran,
she doesn’t really like
life in the United States.
And she literally says: 
In Iran they kill you by axe.
But in the United States 
they kill you with cotton,
an Iranian expression
for saying that she is
dying a slow death
in the United States.
She was also repeatedly being
teased online for her comments.
Many Iranian users
in social media
would ridicule her, would
tell her that she’s crazy.
And in one video she
actually explains
that she's doing very well,
and that it's actually the people
who are making those comments
who are mentally ill.
She also criticizes Instagram,
by saying that her followers
are all real.
She actually has several
Instagram accounts.
She also had a Telegram channel.
Before she attacked 
the YouTube office,
and subsequently
killed herself,
one of her last posts there 
is a childhood photo of herself
posing between flowers,
with one flower stuck in her hair.
