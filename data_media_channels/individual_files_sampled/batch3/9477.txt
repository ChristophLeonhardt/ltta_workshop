ABBY: RECENT FUNDRAISER OBAMA REPORTEDLY SAID YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED. DO NOT WAIT FOR THE PERFECT MESSAGE. ARE EXPECTING POLITICIANS TO BE SO INSPIRING AND POETIC AND MOVING BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION. KEEN DEAN HERE TO REACT IS FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND NO RELATION HERMAN CAIN U. ABBY: GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. DEAN CAIN, YOU ARE MY COUSIN AND YOU KNOW IT. DEAN: YES, SIR. GOOD MORNING ABBY AND ED. DEAN: GOOD MORNING. ABBY: PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY SAID ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES WE ARE SIGHING THAT PLAY OUT NOW HUGE MESSAGE TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WELL, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A LEADERSHIP CRISIS AND A MESSAGING CRISIS AND IT'S IN PART DUE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. BECAUSE HE LED FROM A POSITION OF JUST BEING IN THE POSITION AND APPEASEMENT AND YOU ARE RIGHT, IT HAS CONSEQUENCES. EXCEPT NOW WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ELECTION BY ELECTING THIS PRESIDENT. FOR A PERFECT MESSAGE. THEY HAVE A MESSAGE CRISIS. THEY SHOULDN'T BE WAITING FOR THE PERFECT LEADER. THEY DON'T HAVE A LEADER RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE A LOT OF VOICES MAKING A LOT OF NOISE AND AND SCARE PEOPLE AND MAKE PEOPLE ANGRY. DEAN: HERE'S A QUOTE FROM HONEST WITH YOU, IF I EVER REGRET DURING MY PRESIDENCY, IT IS THAT PEOPLE WERE SO PARTICULARLY AFTER WE LOST THE HOUSE THAT FOLKS STOPPED PAYING ATTENTION UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I DON'T THINK THAT STATEMENT IS TRUE. HERE'S WHY. PEOPLE GOT TIRED OF LOOKING AT ALL OF THE RHETORIC AND NO RESULTS. THE ONLY RESULTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD HANG ITS HAT ON ALONG WITH THE DEMOCRATS WAS FORCING THE UNAFFORDABLE CARE ACT DOWN OUR THROATS. STALLED. STARTING WITH THE GDP GROWTH AND NOW WE ARE PREDICTING A 3.5 TO 4% G.D.P. GROWTH, JUST IN THE FIRST 17 MONTHS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A CONSEQUENCES OF APPEASEMENT BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. IT GOES EVEN FURTHER. AS YOU KNOW THE ATLANTA FED 4.5% IN THE NEXT QUARTER. AND YOU HAVE GOT THIS 6 MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAX CUT. THE PRESIDENT CUTTING ALL THESE REGULATIONS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPACT. THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPACT. THIS IS WHY THE DEMOCRATS' HEADS ARE EXPLODING. BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO ELIZABETH WARREN TALKING ABOUT RIPPING BABIES FROM FAMILIES. THEY HAVE BEEN EXERCISING THESE PROCEDURES FOR TWO AND THREE ADMINISTRATIONS NOW. AND THEN WITH HELD AND THEN WITH GELD AND THEN WITH GILD AND THEN WITH GILLIBRAND TALKING ABOUT ABOLISHING ICE WITH NO IDEA HOW TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE SAYING ALL OF THIS POISONOUS RHETORIC AND DOING THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING, BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE NEW G.D.P. NUMBERS, THE JOB NUMBERS ARE JUST GOING TO BLOW PEOPLE AWAY. SO THEY ARE JUST USING THE TYPICAL, NEGATIVE RHETORIC.
