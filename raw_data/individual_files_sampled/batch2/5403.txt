here's a question what does waffle house have to do with hurricanes turns out if you want to know how bad a storm is going to be just see if the local waffle house is still serving breakfast if they are closed watch out why because they almost never close the Joplin Missouri tornado in 2011 it wiped out hundreds of businesses both waffle houses in town they stayed open when a blizzard hit Lancaster Pennsylvania in 2010 Waffle House was open 24 hours before hurricane Emma flooded Jacksonville Florida in 2017 standing room only in the Waffle House even federal officials now keep an eye on them as a way of determining how local communities are standing up to mother nature there is even a Waffle House index former FEMA administrator Craig Fugate came up with it and described it on NPR they are open most of the time and that's it that was the index if at Waffle House is closed because as a disaster is bad we call it red if they're open but have a limited menu so that's yellow and if they regular menu you just everything fun they're green we're good keep going you haven't found the bad stuff yet if they've got a full menu we're good to go Walt aimer is the CEO of waffle house he joins me now on the phone from Charleston South Carolina along with my friend Brandon Greeley us editor of the Financial Times Alphaville all right Walt if waffle houses tell us how bad the storm is going to be how many if any are closed in the path of hurricane Florence well we're actually doing pretty well right now we only have a couple of them closed the ones that are right along the beach most of our restaurants fortunately are a little bit off the off the water so we're we're able to keep just about all of them open right now and and we're busy and how exactly has the Waffle House become I don't know call it the gold standard for figuring out how to weather these big storms I tell people all the time I said we're really not that smart we're not that complicated we just we just have a lot of want to we want to be there for the community we want to be there for our people we want to be there for the first responders so we just show up and get to work and and work really hard and an overtime I think people started to recognize and places like even where I am and where I'm in right now in Charleston there's nobody open but us so it just just became kind of a little folklore over time and then I heard Craig Fugate voice there on the phone it was nice too nice to hear his voice um unfortunately he's retired but he he gave us a lot of attention when he mentioned us we had never met him before he did but I think that's how it really all got started well well I think you're being too humble just there on the screen we showed your sort of command center where your team monitors the storms how can you ensure I know you want to serve the community and the first responders but you've got an awful lot of employees who are not at home with their families they have not evacuated how do you make sure they're safe well our first concern is their safety and the folks that work for us that are in places that are unsafe a lot of them do leave so we bring a lot of our management team in from around the kind to support the operations and then we buy a whole lot of hotel rooms in in safe areas so I think we're up to couple hundred maybe 250 hotel rooms right now where are people from out of town are staying and a lot of our local associates are staying as well so a lot of our folks do leave and and we we first asked them to make sure that they and their families are safe but we tend to tend to put people in places that are much safer and buildings that are safe and if anybody wants to leave we let them leave and we supplement with people from around the country typically a lot of our management team well Brendan Greeley here I'm a massive fan I take my eggs covered and smothered I I agree with stuff I think you're being a little too humble here can you tell us a little bit about the the logistics of how you make sure for example the communications are in place and also you know you have to make sure that all of the eggs are there that the ingredients are there in you know in the event that supply chains are disrupted how do you make sure that the stores that are open can actually serve eggs yes please continue I'm sorry fortunately with things like these hurricanes we have plenty of notice you mentioned a couple tornadoes there as you're leading in those are a little bit more challenging but with tornado with the Hurricanes we have some notice so we mobilize a lot of resources ahead of the storm and bring in a lot of extra supplies a lot of extra food those folks you saw sitting around the table or kind of the command center to call a lot of plays but mostly our management team is out the field in the restaurants where we can assess what we have and what we need and we try to get as much loaded into the restaurants ahead of the storms and prepare with generators and instruction folks and electricians and and all the resources we need we try to stage nearby so that when the storm finally does come in we are we're supplied ahead of time and then we also have some great suppliers we work with that that help us out on the back end because when when you're the only act in town you tend to go through a lot of food pretty quickly so there is a pretty big logistical challenge probably the bigger challenge for us is the people logistical challenges is getting them all in here finding them places to stay rental cars deploying them to the couple hundred restaurants that we have in this affected area so well there there is a lot of work that goes into place and I'm not going to tell you we're really good at it we try to get better every time and every one of these things is a little bit different well we appreciate it you are living up to the term comfort food really creating a safe haven help us understand how high is the bar for you to close a restaurant in terms of weather danger well you know certainly we work closely with the local authorities and when they come by and tell us that we are in a in a dangerous place we will we will close down so but we have developed really good relationships with the FEMA folks and all the local and state agencies that we where we operate and so we've got good communications with them and we know where where our restaurants are that might be in harm's way and that that would cause us to close it down and then you know obviously when the storm is really rolling in near the eye of the storm we will we'll probably shut down just to make sure our folks are sheltering in the safe place but we don't try to get too far away so we can get back in there quick and if you think about it all these first responders and and the folks who did choose to stay behind there's no other place for them to get any food so so we've we sense it somewhat of a almost an obligation at this point but it's a huge part of our culture to be there for the community all the time and I guess that that comes from working for a restaurant chain that that never closes so and well Waffle House in general is a huge point of pride and destination down in the south hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with
