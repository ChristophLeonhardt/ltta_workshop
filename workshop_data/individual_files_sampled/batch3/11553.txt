both Korea was at the heart of the latest UN and Security Council meeting Washington's top diplomat Mike Pompeo praised progress made in relations between the two countries just a year since President Trump vowed to totally destroy the reclusive State past diplomatic attempts to halt North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile development were unsuccessful but now we're at the dawn of a new day so twelve months ago Washington and Pyongyang seem to be standing on the brink of war so will this new day mentioned by secretary Pompeo last Ilia Petrenko reports from new york it's only been a year and then boom Donald Trump's second UN General Assembly just listened to it I would like to thank chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken a lot of very positive things are happening with Chairman Kim he likes me I like him we get along but most importantly I believe that Chairman Kim jong-un wants peace and prosperity for North Korea twelve months ago same building same halls same mr. Trump no one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea no North Korea hasn't undergone any regime change surgery Chairman Kim is still in his chair but miraculously little rocket man is now an awesome guy rocket man shooting Rockets all over the place and with me he's not getting away with it he will truly regret it fire and fury the likes of which nobody's seen before totally destroy North Korean rocket man Mad Men is on a suicide mission for himself is that a dare it's a statement well today kim jeong-hoon is the president's most admired pen pal i'm sure you've heard about the beautiful letter so i've received two letters from chairman kim much personal correspondence magnificent very strong letter form incredible letters a letter that when I showed one of the letters just one to Prime Minister Robby he said this is actually a groundbreaking letter like any other president Donald Trump would love to be remembered as a true global peacemaker it took him a year and a half from his inauguration to zero in on his desired legacy a true breakthrough in the Korean crisis Barack Obama was having a harder time cementing his place in history books but then the Iran nuclear deal came to the rescue and mission find your perfect legacy was complete after nearly two years of intensive negotiations backed by strong sanctions the countries represented in this room achieved what decades of animosity and rhetoric did not and thanks to this deal we have seen real progress shortly after mr. Obama was gone the deal was left in tatters no matter how monumental it had been in the first place I've ever seen the disastrous deal one of the dumbest deals one of the worst deals ever was the Iran deal I'm all for agreements but that was a bad one Donald Trump waved goodbye to the agreements he quit unilaterally without paying attention to pretty much what the rest of the world has to say about it today's action sends a critical message the United States no longer makes empty threats when I make promises I keep them Donald Trump may indeed keep all his promises as president but it does happen that rivals sometimes take over at the White House after term one what if in a couple of years someone else will be representing the u.s. behind these UN General Assembly walls in New York a million Petrenko we spoke to Eric sir Watkyn co-founder of the lawyers for demilitarization and peace in Korea he believes that despite Washington's efforts to strengthen relations prospect of any peace treaty with the north is no closer it is hard to judge whether their statements match reality however just meeting by dialoguing and talking is progress and I think it needs to be acknowledged and praised that they are doing that however have we moved any closer toward a the idea of a peace treaty have we moved any closer toward finding a way to avoid these nuclear buildup on the peninsula I'm not sure through the efforts of Washington that we have I think we have through the efforts of president moon and South Korea and what they're doing but I don't think at this point in time we can say progress has been made because they should be entering a peace treaty ending the Korean War as a prerequisite to talks you
