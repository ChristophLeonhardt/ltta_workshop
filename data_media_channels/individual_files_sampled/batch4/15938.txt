Sinclair broadcasting sent a memo to each of its individual subsidiary stations for their anchors to read the statement on air now Sinclair's intention was to separate themselves from the rest of mainstream media to differentiate themselves as journalists who provide pertinent details of news stories - the left-wing agenda and it is an admirable goal albeit nearly impossible because of course there will always be journalists who are unable to conceal their opinions on a story and that's okay I'm one of those people it's impossible for me to hide my opinions on things that's why my nickname growing up was the mouth of the south but that's why I am NOT our journalist I have opinions and I make them known I don't act under a charade that I'm neutral Sinclair has recognized the hit that the rest of mainstream media has taken and they've decided however genuine or not to announce that they will make a concerted effort to not engage in the type of transparently liberal shenanigans of the rest of mainstream media the statement that their local stations made was this we are concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible one-sided news stories plaguing our country unfortunately some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think this is extremely dangerous to a democracy now Sinclair is getting ripped left and right by the rest of mainstream media but how is this any different from the parroting echo chamber of leftist narrative that's propagated by CNN MSNBC ABC CBS etc again let me be clear I don't have a problem with these networks being liberal but don't try to act like you are neutral don't call yourselves journalists these media networks have objectives they have a company culture they have a mission statement so how is Sinclair's statement any different from that you guys remember the dick cheney gravitas thing if you don't go Google Bush Cheney and look at articles from the year of 2000 watch the liberal Talking Heads talk about it practically every single one of them talks about Cheney bringing grah toss and they all use that word to the buffoonery that is George W I think Rush Limbaugh did a mash-up of it recently so if it's online check it out but New York Magazine reached out to David Smith who is the executive chairman of Sinclair broadcasting in mid November of last year requesting an interview with him and his response is epic he says appreciate the interest in your wanting to do a story but we don't talk to the print media as a general principle as we find them to be so devoid of reality and serving no real purpose have a great holiday later he added again my experience has consistently been that even with an interview it's of no consequence in terms of spin facts or Distortion political bent etc the print media is so left-wing as to be meaningless dribble which accurately or which counts for why the industry is and will fade away just no credibility SIA ouch anybody got some burn cream but what do you guys think do you think that this statement made by the individuals employed by Sinclair was propaganda esque or simply a company expressing the mission in news media let us know what you think in the comments thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda headboard the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.stanford.edu on the app store download it and you'll have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
