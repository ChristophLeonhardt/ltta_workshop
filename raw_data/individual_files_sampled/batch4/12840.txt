HBO's John Oliver belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent they think that because they share an accent with with Rex Harrison from my fair lady this makes them geniuses so John Oliver does a political show on American politics it's he doesn't know much about American politics he doesn't know much about politics generally but he's been feeded by the media because he's a comedian who's wildly to the left so just like Brett President Obama is gonna be interviewed by Samantha bee who's legitimately the least funny person in human history she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine who's the least funny person in human history both of them I believe be Stalin for that title a while back so now that we're gonna unify the championships so Obama's gonna be blonde with Samantha B where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortions wonderful John Oliver I was ripping on Donald Trump the other day is it some awards ceremony and because he's British that means we're supposed to pay attention to him even though we fought a revolution so he wouldn't have to pay attention to the Brits here here's John Oliver talking about abortion and in terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important we really did potentially hit a nadir in the modern era during that third debate because his discussion of late term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions to work no clear understanding of the basic biology of women's bodies and a very poor sense of grammar as well so I guess we got in a sense what we were asking for if you ask Donald Trump to draw a fallopian tube I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a child's drawing of a cobra okay and I wouldn't hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a fallopian tube or describe any of the biology here because he obviously doesn't know now look I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasn't graphic enough but let me for those who missed it explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion which is what he was talking about okay what happens in a late-term abortion what happens in a late-term abortion is something completely awful this is according to american pregnancy or okay not a right-wing pro-life website american pregnancy or quote the fetus is rotated forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs shoulders and arms through the birth canal a small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside the catheter removes the cerebral material that be the brains until the skull collapses the fetus is then completely removed hey that's one procedure that's used that stylette ssin and extraction okay and in late-term abortions it's usually one of these two dilation and evacuation or dilation and extraction dilation and evacuation the baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it sometimes they don't use such injections then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the child's body in the womb and remove it piece by piece so I guess the Donald Trump could have been more graphic I don't know the Chyna Oliver would have enjoyed that but he could have been more graphic I suppose but this is what they do they that laughing up like he comes raw fallopian tube okay John draw an abortion really dry what's it I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like it's not waving a magic wand and it's not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb I would like to see that but of course he'll never do that other than it might look like a cobra might look like a cobra maybe it'll look like a princess waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina the fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable
