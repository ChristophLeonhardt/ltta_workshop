00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,510
about YouTube documentaries we drank gin

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,160
and tonics and walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> around Kings Road</font>

17

and we took pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> together it was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just a really really great time if</font>

19
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,550
probably one of my favorite experiences

20
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,170
of meeting people on a part of the

21
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,670
experience I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting lots of people</font>

22
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">after the woman on YouTube power at</font>

23
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,059
VidCon last year so it was absolutely

24
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,500
fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the whole time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can help</font>

25
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,329
but think to myself how did a nerd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

26
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,670
me get so popular not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> wearing any</font>

27
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Argyle anyway so today I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haircut</font>

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the first time in like a year and a</font>

29
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">half I think nothing you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can really tell</font>

30
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,190
but even if I had shaved it off food I

31
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,719
did blue like I said I would when I was

32
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,640
little it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be a very minor</font>

33
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,289
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life compared to the sort</font>

34
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,820
of changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on this</font>

35
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,949
past fortnight this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortnight of</font>

36
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,710
ghosts of paintings pass of extensive

37
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,110
paperwork to do list cardboard boxes

38
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,330
this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> week that our family home</font>

39
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,790
of 30 years began to belong to someone

40
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,680
else the house I grew up it was built in

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,479
nineteen twelve but instead of spending

42
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,210
its centenary<font color="#CCCCCC"> here dancing aboard deck I</font>

43
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,799
spent much of that year at<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,869
and later left the house for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flat of</font>

45
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,150
my own well me and these are the three

46
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,310
souls the time in the house in between

47
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,280
was spent grasping for air or a moment's

48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,560
pause for a final song as the ship went

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,570
down to make sense of things I actually

50
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,579
grew to resent the house for what

51
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,650
hesitant buyers called its shortcomings

52
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,020
the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we need to sell</font>

53
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,450
like a giant burden above all for being

54
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,759
constant reminder of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past and it no</font>

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
longer housed the person who spent time

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,530
and energy too much time too much energy

57
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">devoted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could</font>

58
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,640
keep the house only<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to leave the</font>

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,219
house behind us as we began to navigate

60
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,869
this world without him this week

61
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,060
especially I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quotation from</font>

62
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,939
CS Lewis's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a grief observed it doesn't</font>

63
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,710
really matter whether you grip the arms

64
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,720
of the dentist's chair or let your hands

65
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,420
line your lap the drill drills on I also

66
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,030
thought that

67
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,709
as frequently quoted sentences that

68
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,470
follow a grief still feels like fear

69
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps more strictly like suspense or</font>

70
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,569
like waiting just hanging about waiting

71
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,120
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to happen it gives life a</font>

72
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,130
permanently provisional feeling I

73
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,690
remember JK<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowling's answer to my</font>

74
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,280
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whether biting about death</font>

75
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
so much means that she understands it

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,540
more no but she's less afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but</font>

77
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,520
it's not fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not right</font>

78
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,700
now it's waiting the lack indeed the

79
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,310
total absence of any sort of satisfying

80
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,290
completion we can sometimes make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

81
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,060
mistake of thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of death</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

82
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,610
completion but when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> dies there</font>

83
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,800
is always more to waitful in that way

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that waiting it's sort of what</font>

85
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,540
some people call hope but it can also be

86
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,000
what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> called read it can also just</font>

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,590
be paperwork I really didn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

88
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this video to be dark I really don't</font>

89
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,739
mean for my memories of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that house to be</font>

90
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,410
dark I wanted this video to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as light</font>

91
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,260
as the glow of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the constellations stuck</font>

92
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,660
onto the ceiling<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my childhood bedroom</font>

93
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,970
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break through the solid</font>

94
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,239
barricade<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the words no entry written</font>

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,090
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bedroom door with backward</font>

96
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,760
ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> no less I really wanted it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel</font>

97
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,010
as familiar as someone walking up the

98
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:39,910
creaking steps to the top room but now

99
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,350
those creeks will be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

100
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,000
different reference point for a

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> different set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

102
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,519
living<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a completely different life</font>

103
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,609
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drill drills on goodbye house I</font>

104
00:03:51,609 --> 00:00:00,000
did love you once
