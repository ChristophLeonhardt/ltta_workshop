MIGHT AND EASES ON REPORTS THAT TALKS ARE GROWING WELL. THEY'RE COMING BACK TOMORROW NIGHT. WE'LL KNOW TOMORROW NIGHT. MEANTIME, ANOTHER DEADLINE FAST APPROACHING. THAT IS ON THIS IRAN DEAL AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AWAY DETERMINING ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT WHETHER HE WANTS TO NIX THE DEAL IN PLACE OR FIX THE ONE THAT IS. ALL RIGHT. FORMER U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER JOINING US. MICHAEL, FRENCH AND GERMAN LEADERS SAID WE PUT TOO MUCH IN THIS TO RISK STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THERE'S THINGS THAT WE CAN FIX. THE PRESIDENT SAYS NO, IT WAS A DISASTER FROM THE GET-GO. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO DO? HE'S GOING TO WALK AWAY. THANKS FOR HAVING ME, NEIL. HE'S GOING TO WALK AWAY. MACRON HAS SAID IT BEST. IF THERE'S NOT FIXES TO THE JCPOA, IRAN WILL BECOME NORTH KOREA IN TEN YEARS. THE PRESIDENT WILL WALK AWAY BASED ON WHAT BOLTON AND POMPEO ARE ADVISING HIM AND THE BRIEFING THAT NETANYAHU GAVE LAST WEEK. Neil: AND THEN WHAT? A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I KNOW THIS WAS NOT THE KIND OF THING THAT SINCE IT WAS NOT RATIFIED BY CONGRESS, WE COULD WALK AWAY IF WE WANT TO, BUT CRITICS SAY BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T TRUST THE AMERICANS. ONE PRESIDENT AND THE NEXT GUY WHAT DO YOU THINK? THIS GIVES US LEVERAGE WITH NORTH KOREAN. KIM JONG-UN WANTED AN IRAN-LIKE DEAL. HE WAS BANKING ON THAT. THIS GIVES US LEVERAGE. WE'RE TEARING UP A BAD DEAL AND GOING IN FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. I THINK IT GIVES US LEVERAGE. THAT'S A WEAK ARGUMENT FROM THE OTHER SIDE. Neil: BUT I'M CURIOUS, TIM MONEY GUY HERE AT FOX, THE NERDY GUY. IRAN HAS THEIR MONEY, A MONEY. RIGHT. Neil: SO WHAT IS THE INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO SAY, ALL RIGHT, SURE, LET'S RENEGOTIATE THIS OR GET INVOLVED IN THIS? THEY SQUANDERED THAT'S MONEY. THAT'S WHAT THE PROTESTS ARE ABOUT. THE IRANIAN MONEY HAVE SAID THE REGIME SQUANDERED THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE IRAN DEAL, THE $150 BILLION. IT'S GONE. IT WENT TO BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING AND EXPORTING OF TERRORISM. PROTESTERS ARE STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO IRAQ, SYRIA AND LEBANON AND PAY ATTENTION TO US. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE TRILLION GOING TO A REGIME TO CONTINUE BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING, THE EXPORT OF TERRORISM. ALL THE WHILE, AT THE END OF A SUNSET CLAUSE, IT'S A NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA. THAT'S THE REASON TO WALK AWAY FROM THE JCPOA. IF YOU WANT TO HURT THE REGIME, TAKE THE JCPOA AWAY. EUROPE IS NOT INVESTING NOW. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN IRAN WHEN THE U.S. HAS WALKED AWAY FROM IT. IRAN'S ECONOMY IS NOT WORTH IT. DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH THEY HATE THE PRESIDENT, IT'S NOT WORTH HURTING A EUROPE FOR A PRESIDENT THAT COULD BE GONE IN
