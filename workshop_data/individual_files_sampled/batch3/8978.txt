DEFINITELY A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN THE U.S. SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT ON THE ZTE ISSUE. Bret: WILL FOLLOW IT. THANK YOU. THE MAN WHO WROTE LAST WEEK'S REPORT ABOUT THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL SCANDAL WAS ON CAPITOL HILL THIS AFTERNOON TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND DEFEND HIS CONCLUSIONS. ALONG WITH HIM, THE FBI DIRECTOR WHO IS PROMISING TO CHANGE THINGS AND HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE SHOWS US WHAT HAPPENED. I WANT YOU TO REOPEN THE INVESTIGATION. SENIOR REPUBLICAN SENATOR DRILL DOWN ON THE ANTI-TRUMP TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK AND FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE. THE 2016 MEETING WAS ABOUT A "INSURANCE POLICY" DISCUSSED IN THEN FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE'S OFFICE. STRZOK TEXTED ABOUT THE MEETING. YOU ASKED MR. McCABE. HE SAID HE DID NOT RECALL.
