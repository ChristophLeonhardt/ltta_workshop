When I stumbled across a high
school graduation in Gaza City,
it was disorienting.
I could have been
in Southern California
or suburban New Jersey.
Eager, excited kids in
their caps and gowns.
And then, a big dance party.
But these graduates of Gaza’s
American International School
are the privileged few,
the sons and daughters
of the elite.
They’ve come of age
in a place that’s
been under blockade since
they were 7 years old.
And even they can’t be sure
that they’ll ever get out.
The other 99 percent of
Gazans are far worse off.
They’re stuck here in one of the
most densely populated places
on earth, with little or no work,
sporadic electricity,
filthy water and
worsening public health.
The most acute
shortage is of hope.
Since March, thousands
have gathered
in protests demanding
a right of return
to their ancestral homes
in what is now Israel.
The protests were the
idea of a young activist.
He imagined masses of people
camping out peacefully
along the Israeli fence
that hems in Gaza,
then knocking it over
and walking across,
making a point
if nothing else.
But he lost control
of what he had started.
Hamas, the militant group
that has run Gaza since 2007,
took over.
The demonstrations
gave Hamas
a way to put themselves
on the side of their
frustrated constituents and
rage against a common enemy:
Israel.
The protest camps
set up along the fence
can make you do
a double take.
In parts, they look like
a community festival,
a carnival, a fair,
like a distant cousin
to Burning Man.
Women prepare
falafel sandwiches.
Barbers give haircuts
and trim beards.
Lip synchers and dancers
perform in the shade.
Actors ham it up playing
cruel Israeli soldiers.
Families come with their children.
It all seems like fun,
but closer to the fence,
it looks more like a battle.
The protesters, mostly
young men, but some women
and boys too, want to break
through the barrier
separating them from Israel.
The soldiers are
determined to stop them.
Scores have been
killed so far in Gaza.
Thousands have been injured.
Hamas calls the
protests peaceful —
because nobody is
firing rifles or rockets,
they say.
But Israel sees some
in the crowds throwing
grenades and
Molotov cocktails.
The protesters have
organized themselves
into teams — of rock
throwers with their slings,
the wire cutters who drag
away coils of barbed wire.
And the tire teams who
collect and then burn tires
to create a smokescreen
against sniper fire.
Other squads turn toys
into firebombs.
Rags soaked in gasoline
are tied to frilly kites
and sent flying
toward Israel.
Acres of farmland and
forest have burned.
Ambulance crews
circle in a loop, waiting
until they hear gunshots,
and running when they 
see someone fall.
Nearby, doctors and nurses
in hospital tents
tend to the wounded.
What the protests
can achieve is unclear.
The organizers talk
about increasing
international pressure on
Israel to lift the siege of Gaza,
and it seems like nothing
would do more
to accomplish that than
a tremendous body count.
It’s all meant to ramp up
to a climactic conclusion
over two days:
May 14, with the U.S. Embassy's
move to Jerusalem
on the 70th anniversary
of the state of Israel,
and May 15, when Palestinians
remember that history
as the Nakba,
a catastrophe.
The head of Hamas
in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar,
now says that the protests
will continue indefinitely
until, he says,
“We break the siege.”
