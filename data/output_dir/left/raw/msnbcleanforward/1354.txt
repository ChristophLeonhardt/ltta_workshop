INDICTMENT. HE MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE HOOK FOR

00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,901
HE MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE HOOK FOR MORE TROUBLE THAN WHAT WE WERE

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PAID THE MONEY TO THE TWO WOMEN.

NOT TO PAY OFF WOMEN SO HIS MARRIAGE WOULD BE IN TACT.

103
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,274
MARRIAGE WOULD BE IN TACT. BUT TO GET HIMSELF ELECTED.

104
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,743
BUT TO GET HIMSELF ELECTED. THAT IS AN AMAZINGLY PARTICULAR

00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,946
THAT IS AN AMAZINGLY PARTICULAR CHARGE THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF

106
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,948
CHARGE THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF THE PRESIDENT’S LACK OF

107
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:06,381
THE PRESIDENT’S LACK OF CREDIBILITY.

108

111
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:18,494
THIS IS NOT JUST A PAY OFF. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CAMPAIGN

00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:20,161
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CAMPAIGN IF

113
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:20,495
IF ITSELF.

114
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:21,195

TESTIMONY AND MAKES MICHAEL COHEN POTENTIALLY CREDIBLE HERE,

122
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,343
COHEN POTENTIALLY CREDIBLE HERE, IS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

123
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:37,479
IS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PAYMENTS WHICH MEANS THERE ARE

124
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,682
PAYMENTS WHICH MEANS THERE ARE TRANSACTIONS WHICH MEANS THERE

125

SOMEHOW THE MONEY WOULD POUR THROUGH AS A DRAW.

139
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:20,256
THROUGH AS A DRAW. BUT THE SECOND TIME THE
