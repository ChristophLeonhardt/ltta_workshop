good evening from New York I'm Chris Hayes the Environmental Protection Agency appears to be imploding tonight under the astoundingly corrupt leadership of Scott Pruett Pruett is now facing a truly remarkable 15 ongoing federal investigations and the Government Accountability Office has already found he broke the law by installing a $43,000 phone booth in his office which for the record is one of his relatively minor transgressions today Pruett seemed to admit to an entirely different potential crime that he ordered a top EPA EPA aide to contact the CEO of chick-fil-a about a franchise for Pruitt's wife a move that could leave Pruitt open to prosecution for trying to exploit the power of his office to benefit his finite family financially here's what Pruett said when he was asked about the allegation today yeah I think with great change comes you know I think opposition I mean there's significant change that's happening across not only the EPA but across this administration it's needed and look my wife is an entrepreneur herself I love she loves we love we chick-fil-a is a franchise of faith and it's one of the best in the country and so that's something we were very excited about so and we need more of them in Tulsa we need more of them across the country so anyway it's it's an exciting time sure is I love she loves we love look it's a it's a godly chicken sandwich that's an exciting time the aide who Pruett asked to get the franchise for his wife Sidney HUP left the EPA last year and today her sister millon hop followed suit atop EPA official telling the Atlantic that hop was quote tired of being thrown under the bus by Pruitt and the APA did not initially seem to take her departure very well when the Atlantic's le on a plot who broke the story and joins me shortly contacted EPA spokesperson Jehan Wilcox he declined to comment on Huff's resignation and then added quote you have a great day you're a piece of trash that's nice it's a person that works for us all of us citizens and fro it had a close relationship with hob she served as gatekeeper and emails revealed that Pruitt inappropriately tasked her with performing all sorts of personal tasks even though she was drawing government salary including booking personal flights finding him housing and most hilariously and bizarrely and sort of weirdly trying to purchase a used mattress from a Trump Hotel that today prompted Greenpeace to deliver what they claimed was an actual huge Trump Hotel mattress who would really want to check to Pruitt's EPA office of course it's long been clear that Shane does not really work on scott pruett lord knows we've tried here on this program or on his boss the president the United States despite Pruitt's cartoonishly long list of transgressions which include a sweetheart deal on a condo from a lobbyist who had business before his agency and excessive spending on security and first-class travel president drained the swamp today explicitly lauded his epa chief for a job well done administrator scott pruett thank you scott very much EPA is doing really really well and you know somebody has to say that about you a little bit you know that's got people are really impressed with the job that's being done at the EPA thank you very much Scott now hop was not today's only EPA resignation also reportedly jumping ship was another close prune aide senior counsel Sarah Greenwald both hop and Greenwald came from with Pruitt from Oklahoma where he had been Attorney General earlier this year we learned that Pruitt had sought to use an obscure provision in an effort to circumvent the White House and give both of those individuals massive raises if you're committed to the trumpet agenda why did you go around the president in the White House to get pay raises to two staffers I did not my staff did and I found out about that yesterday and I changed it should be fired from that it should not have been done in a minute maybe there would be some accountability career person or political person I don't know I don't know you don't know you don't know you don't know who did I found out about this yesterday and I corrected the action okay important to note that subsequent emails that have come out make it pretty clear that he was lying there but it's also important to realize that it's not longtime EPA staffers who may not agree with Pro politically who are fleeing the agency with today's resignations at least four political appointees people hired by President Trump have left in the past three months and this year former EPA deputy chief of staff Kevin chmielewskij who served on the Trump campaign all right he's a trump dude and he even appeared on stage with Trump turned whistleblower on Pruett because he was so astounded by his behavior going before Congress to detail wasteful spending and unethical behavior bias one the boss joining me now to break down the enclosure of the EPA to the top reporters on the beat New York Times investigative reporter Eric Lipton and Atlantic staff writer Elena plot who have both been doing great reporting Elena let me start with you what happened in this phone call in which you were told that you were garbage well as one does when you're a reporter you get a tip you confirm it and then you call spokesperson asking for comment and instead of getting a comment I was told I was a piece of trash and so there you have it I I know I haven't been doing this very long but I have to believe that relations between the press corps and flaks throughout an administration haven't always been this acrimonious you were just calling to confirm this set of facts I just want to be clear here like it was you heard that someone resigned you called to say did this person resign and you were told that your piece of trash exactly all right Eric what is going on over there it's just been a series of embarrassing slip-ups by Scott Pruett it's been I mean I in the last five days we've done five different stories you know it turns out the lobbyist was lobbying that rented the condo to him even more than we thought there's a coal executive who gave him tickets and seats that you had to make a million dollar donation to get access to you know the the the bed the effort to get to use bed the now and now the resignation of his people and the chick-fil-a I mean that that's five days worth of stories I mean it's just you know no wonder the press office there feels under siege but we aren't making these stories up we're just reporting them and there is there has been a bit of a tension between the reporters and and the press shop but you know we're just trying to do our jobs we'd actually rather be writing about environmental policy but Pruett keeps us focused on his management well online let me ask you this I mean there there is a sense in which all we keep having more more stories I'm going to just read a partial list here American some there's a sweetheart condo deal from lobbyists three million dollars spent on a massive security detail that's entirely unprecedented use the security detail for personal trips first-class travel on the public dime circumventing the White House to give those huge raises to AIDS which were by the way tens of thousands of dollars a year there's the chick-fil-a franchise request making an aide who's drawing government salary do personal tasks the $42,000 soundproof office phone booth the $1500 set of twelve fountain pens which is sort of what kind of it like a boutique kind of b-side scandal $5,700 biometric locks on office doors using flashing lights tours motorcade the lobbyist aided trip to Morocco seats at a college basketball game for a coal obvious here's my question to you is this penetrating in the EPA or are they all just like nothing's gonna happen to him well I think what EPA aides have learned that they can do quite well and the same goes for administrator Pruitt the cover-up is almost always worse than the crime in these cases I I broke the story about the two raises given to both Sarah green Walton mill and hub and what congressional investigators ended up asking about was not the raises themselves but whether Pruitt had lied about it so I think as few actually noted a lot of these are kind of b-side scandals things that impact administrations had they happen I have to wonder if the administrator or secretary in whatever department would have just apologized and we would have forgotten about it that I'm stay is there a significance of the two individuals that came with him from Oklahoma that were clearly close to him and the received these salary increases of the two individuals Eric that resigned or quit today yeah I thought I'm hearing directly from some of his closest people that he brought with him from Oklahoma that there's a lot of disappointment and a feeling that they have been their own careers or partially been sacrificed as a result of their committment to him and that they have been hurt by their working with him and there's a lot of disappointment among the top political people not only among the career people that have worked you know for decades to try to you know defend the quality in the environment in United States but even as political people which is the most surprising part of it Elena you want to say something absolutely and I think what we have to understand too is with Sarah and Mellon gone that circle of aides that Eric is referencing those closest to him is shrinking you know smaller and smaller by the day so you have to wonder either what delusion stories comes out in the next few days or what point Pruitt just decides I don't have anyone to lean on anymore other than the president which at this point honestly Chris maybe be enough well that's way it looks Eric I mean the president going out of his way to praise Pruitt today and remembers of Republican there was a congress sort of making noises a little bit about getting frustrated with this but nothing major enough to threaten the guys job as far as I can tell yeah my colleague Lisa Friedman was on the hill today trying to buttonhole senators she spoke with approximately 10 of them and I was actually surprised that the the the Republicans continued to for the most part be reserved in criticism there were a few that were quite critical but but they were not surprising who they were so I mean really the only person that matters here is the President Trump and and so far at least he continues to have the president's support but he's it's always obviously very unpredictable as to where these things are gonna play out with the president none of us really know what's gonna happen all right Eric Lipton and Elena plot thanks for both your great reporting and for making some time tonight Thank You Kurt hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
