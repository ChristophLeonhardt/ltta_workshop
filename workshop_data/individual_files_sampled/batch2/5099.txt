despite what we'll call a quiet period in the special counsels investigation The Washington Post reports Robert Muller's team is quote aggressively pursuing possible ties between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks you remember them at the center of the latest inquiry as president Trump's associate and friend of over three decades Roger stone Washington Post reporter Carol Lennon has a byline on the story and is standing by to join us The Post reports and we quote in recent weeks a grand jury in Washington has listened to more than a dozen hours of testimony and FBI technicians have pored over gigabytes of electronic messages that's the part that got our attention as part of the special counsels quest to solve one burning mystery did longtime Trump adviser Roger stone or any other associate of the president have advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks plans to release hacked democratic emails in 2016 today in a statement to NBC News Stone denied the accusations writing and this gets a bit tough but it's as written I never received anything including allegedly hacked emails from gusoff or 2.0 the Russians WikiLeaks Assange no punctuation or anyone else and never passed anything on to Donald Trump the Trump campaign or anyone else there is no witness who can honestly testify otherwise and no evidence to the contrary well with us for more the aforementioned Carole lennick Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter with the Washington Post and former US Attorney Joyce Vance who spent 25 years as a federal prosecutor Carol I saw you on our 4 p.m. broadcast and we agree on one central point that we can't get beyond how did Roger stone know to predict that Clinton's campaign chairman was about to have his turn in the barrel Tony Podesta six weeks before the amazing Podesta emails our lead did he know that how did he know that he says he said a lot of different things but one thing Roger stone has said more consistently than others is that he had some research that was provided to him conspiracy theorists who passed on something to a journalist and he received this information and it suggested wow this trove of emails that were released about Hillary Clinton's campaign were missing materials from John Podesta that must be coming it does seem a little prescient and people are straining to see how that could be true Joyce if you're if you're Muller what does Stone get you what does Stone bring you Stone brings 30 years of relationship with President Trump they've known each other for a long time he's got long-term relationships with Manafort he has history with all of the key players who are central to discerning whether or not the Trump campaign was engaged in a conspiracy with Russia to impact the election and where do you believe you and I have talked on the air many times about Roger stone about that target on his back about the heat what do you think this is all thwart you know Roger stone is like every other key witness in a conspiracy you can't go around him you have to confront all of the evidence as it comes to you and stone has made so many public statements about his connections with WikiLeaks there are so many as Carol so nicely puts it otherwise inexplicable statements predictions that he makes about acts that come to pass as Muller as the prosecutors in this case you have to understand how he made this was he a braggart is he a liar or was he actually connected to WikiLeaks and Russia and if so what if any of that information did he pass on to Trump since he also claimed that he and Trump talked frequently during the campaign you've got to go through that a piece of the time and figure out what's true and what's not true Carol just remind us to our knowledge Roger stone has not been called in that's right although seven associates and friends have and a lot of them have had their emails reviewed their text messages reviewed their DMS reviewed there's quite a lot of people around Roger stone who have come under the scrutiny of the special counsel they must not be enjoying having an association with Roger stone at this moment but I liked very much what Joyce just said about this issue of going through it may prove at the end of the day Brian that Roger stone was a bragger who didn't have any real connection to WikiLeaks no special back-channel even though he both stood of it privately even though he had some unusual prescience in his predictions but he does know a lot about Donald Trump the candidate did he know about anything else that was going on behind the scenes that Donald Trump who doesn't use email was talking about hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
