1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,300
Put out your fist.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,980
I didn't say push back, why you pushing back so hard?

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,900
Oh, true. You didn't.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,740
Because that's human nature.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,560
What do you think is your greatest 
competitive advantage right now?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Where do you think you are in
the lifecycle of your business?

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,060
Most people's plans don't get implemented because
they're too complex. I always tell people

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,420
complexity is the enemy of execution. 
Tell me who your ideal client is right now.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,000
Sure. Our competitive advantage is simple: 
supply chain.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,280
How are you doing, Michelle?

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,440
Michelle: So good
Tony: Good to see you.
Michelle: Thank you.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,520
I'm Michelle Cordeiro Grant, 
founder and CEO of Live.ly.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,040
What we sell are bras and undies and swimwear today,
but adjacency products will be coming tomorrow.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,360
Tony: I'm a big believer in rip open the plan that
you're gonna do, but I always have that back-up plan.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,750
Michelle: We started with an amazing conversation,

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,960
talking through the business, talking
through the strategy, me as a leader and so forth.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,000
Tony: I have zero question about your
ability to succeed because if you take

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,040
away all the skills, you have that much
drive and hunger, you'll figure it out.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,450
Michelle: It was nice that he kind of took a moment
to acknowledge that you're gonna do this

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,800
no matter what, but it's really how you do this 
that's gonna be game-changing in your personal life.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,850
Tony: My only piece for you
is taking care of you so that this

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,810
journey you don't look back and have regrets, right? 
Michelle: Right

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,480
Tony: And the place that you have regret will probably not be in the business, it will be in your personal life.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,520
Michelle: His approach is personal and it's
tailored, which i think is amazing.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,840
I think that's why he's so effective because he customizes to whoever he's interacting with.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Tony: I have no question she can succeed in business. My concern was I could feel that

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,960
below that, there's this
lack of fulfillment and enjoyment even

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,160
though she's busting her tail and my
goal in life is not only help people achieve more.

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,640
My goal is helping people have life
on their terms.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,100
Tell me, what are you gonna go back with

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,400
and tell me what questions you might have 
or how I might be able to help.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Michelle: Quite frankly, when I
started the week, I thought I was gonna

33
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,920
be asking him more for business advice,
but as I kind of went through the course

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,789
of the journey it changed, because I
really embrace what he says about it

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,680
being 80% psychology and 20%, you know,
operations and so I started to lean into that.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,640
Tony: Imagine there's a set of archetypes.
Michelle: Okay.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,620
Tony: A warrior archetype, 
which clearly you have within you.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm gonna break through this. I'm
gonna make this thing happen, right?

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,010
But the warrior is the one that will go do
battle. The warrior is fearless.

40
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,440
The warrior will just push through. 
Michelle: Yeah.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,970
Tony: I'm gonna ask you to stand up with me just

42
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,343
for a moment.
Michelle: Sure.

43
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,644
He told me to stand up. I'm
like, "Oh, boy. Here we go.

44
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,040
Where are we going? What are we doing?"

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
Tony: Can you relate to the warrior in you? 
Michelle: Yeah. Of course.

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
Tony: If you've got to instinctively say, "Where is the warrior in me?" Touch that part of your body, wherever that â€”

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
alright, here. Okay, good.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,440
The warrior says, "Michelle, all you need to do now, all you need to remember,

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
all you need to know to grow the next level is and 
give me the first response and say,

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,260
"The warrior says, 'Michelle ...'"

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,880
Michelle: The warrior says, "Michelle, all I need to do
to get to the next level is focus."

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,920
Tony: She's a very independent sort, so instead of me giving advice, I wanted her to give the advice to her.

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,149
Let's try something different. There's a magician.

54
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:09,715
The magician can see the strategy nobody else sees. The magician has fun with stuff that

55
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:13,500
stresses out the warrior. Feel the quality
of the magician. What's the quality of

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,660
emotion different than the warrior? I'm
curious, can you feel the difference?

57
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,800
Michelle: Calm.
Tony: Yes. And that's the piece you're missing right now.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,000
Michelle: I felt fortunate at the time, because I
knew that he was gonna be sharing with me a gift

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,079
that he gives to select
people and for him to take the time to

60
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,796
go there with me made me 
feel really, really blessed.

61
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:35,720
Tony: The lover in you. Where's the lover? Touch where the lover is.

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,730
Okay, good. And the lover is what you really are.

63
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,510
You're driven by love, even your customers, you're driven by love. It's very obvious.

64
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,650
Some people say that. You really are
that. It's where you get your energy.

65
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,099
It isn't just about business. It's about
love. She loves her clients. She wants to

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,860
see them have a beautiful life, and she's
so busy running around doing everything

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,960
that she kind of lost that connection, so
I want to bring that connection back.

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,960
As powerful as this woman is here and I
respect her immensely, this one with

69
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,620
tears in her eyes, she's the one who can penetrate
anyone. And you're being very vulnerable

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,209
right now, but you're being connected to
yourself and that feeling, that's what I

71
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,760
want for you on this journey.

72
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,220
I've done this for 40 years with you know tens of

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,010
millions of people from a hundred
countries so at this point I could be an

74
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,570
idiot and have to be able to notice there
are patterns that make people angry or

75
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,840
sad or frustrated. There are patterns
that make people passionate or grateful

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,130
or excited and when you
know what those patterns are and you see

77
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,860
what they are and you know what to do to
help people, just because I am you know I

78
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,261
got a lifetime's worth of experience.

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,720
You don't have to give up any of that drive 
 for you to have the quality of life you deserve

80
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
and your family deserves. See you soon.

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:00:00,000
Michelle: Thank you.
