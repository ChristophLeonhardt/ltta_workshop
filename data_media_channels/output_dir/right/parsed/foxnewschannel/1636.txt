CHINA MAY BE INTERFERING BUT HE
SAID HE HAS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH PRESIDENT XI.
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THE KENTUCKY
SENATOR RAND PAUL AND ASKED WHAT
HE THINKS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT
SAYING THE LIBYA MODEL WON'T BE
REPEATED IN NORTH KOREA AND
OTHER TOPICS AS WELL.
>> IT WOULD BE DISCONCERTING TO
NORTH KOREA TO SEE THE LIBYA
EXAMPLE.
I HOPE THERE IS A DEAL IN NORTH
KOREA.
I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO REASSURE
THEM, YES, THIS WILL BE
DIFFERENT THAN LIBYA.
IF YOU GIVE UP YOUR NUCLEAR
CAPABILITIES, THERE AND PEACE
AND LIKELIHOOD PROSPERITY.
>> Martha: CONCERNED AT ALL
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT SAYING WE
WOULD OFFER PROTECTION FOR HIM?
>> THAT I  MAY BE OVER-STATING
THE CASE.
THE WEST AFFECTED REGIME CHANGE
IN LIBYA.
IRAN AND NORTH KOREA WONDER
ABOUT OUR SINCERITY.
SOME OF US ARGUED IT WAS A BAD
IDEA TO GET OUT OF THE IRAN
AGREEMENT BECAUSE IT SEND A
MESSAGE WE ARE NOT CONSISTENT
WITH YOUR AGREEMENTS.
>> Martha: YOU VOTED AGAINST
GINA HASPEL.
WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS NOW THAT
SHE WILL BE THE CIA DIRECTOR?
>> THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS GETS
CANDIDATES TO SAY THINGS THEY
HAVE NOT SAY PREVIOUSLY.
SHE SAID WATER BOARDING DID NOT
WORK.
SHE NEVER SAID IT WAS IMMORAL
BUT CLOSER TO WHERE A LOST US
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE AS A
PEOPLE.
TORTURE AND WATER BOARDING IS
WHAT NOT WE SHOULD BE DOING.
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE POINTS
THAT TRUMP WAS SURVEILED.
SHE DENIED THAT THE CIA HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH BRITISH
INTELLIGENCE.
SHE SAID TO ME THERE WAS NO
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AND JOHN
BRENNAN GIVING THEM INFORMATION
ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
THAT CONTRADICTS NEWS REPORTS.
I HOPE IT'S TRUE AND I HOPE SHE
WILL PUT IT IN WRITING.
TODAY SHE DENIED THERE WAS A
MEETING WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT
SURVEILLANCE OF THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN WAS TRANSFERRED.
>> Martha: THAT WAS AN
INTERESTING EXCHANGE.
ARE YOU DISTURBED BY THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" PIECE SAID THERE WAS
A COUNTER-TERRORISM
INVESTIGATION OPENED UP BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CRIMINAL
CHARGE
CHARG
CHARGE?
>> I HAVE BEEN TROUBLED FROM THE
BEGINNING.
I THINK PEOPLE WERE DISHONEST IN
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO GO
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP BASED ON A
DOSSIER PAID BY THE CLINTON
COMPAIN AND DIDN'T TELL THE
JUDGE THAT.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE LYING FROM A
GET GO AND AN AGENCY RUN AMUCK
WITH FEELINGS OF HATRED AT THE
PRESIDENT.
I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BIAS
AT THE CIA.
>> Martha: YOU CAME UP WITH A
BILL THAT WOULD BALANCE THE
BUDGET AND CUT BUDGET BY 13
BILLY DONOVAN OVER 10 YEARS.
-- BILLION DOLLARS OVER 10
YEARS.
ONLY 21 SENATORS VOTED FOR THE
BALANCED BUDGET DEAL.
>> HEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM.
THE REPUBLICANS GO HOME TO THE
ROTTAR'S
ROTTAR'
ROTTAR'S -- ROTARY CLUB AND SAY
I AM FOR THE BALANCED BUDGET.
THEY PROMISEED TO REPEAL
OBAMACARE.
NOW 30 WOULD NOT VOTE FOR A
BUDGET THAT BALANCES IN 5 YEARS.
ONLY 32-BILLION DOLLARS PER
YEAR.
13 BILLION DOLLARS IS AGAINST
IMPOSED INCREASES.
THAT'S ONLY 1% A YEAR.
>> Martha: ANYONE THAT SURPRISED
YOU IN THAT VOTE?
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT WOULD
DECIMATE DEFENSE SPENDING.
DID ANYONE SURPRISE YOU WITH
THEIR VOTES?
>> NO, LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT
WOULD AFFECT THE DEFENSE.
IT HAD NO CUTS IN DEFENSE.
IT SAID YOU HAVE TO CUT 1% OF
THE TOTAL.
BUT THE COMMITTEES COULD DECIDE
WHERE TO CUT IT.
THOSE COMMITTEES COULD HAVE SAID
IT WOULD BE THE DEFENSE.
THAT'S UNLIKELY SINCE THE
REPUBLICANS CONTROL AND DON'T
WANT TO CUT DEFENSE.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MILITARY AND
NON-MILITARY AND ENTITLEMENTS.
IF YOU CUT ONE PENNY OUT OF THE
DOLLAR IT WOULD BALANCE.
THIS SHOWS THE HYPOCRISY OF
REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THEY ARE FOR
BALANCED BUDGET BUT UNWILLING TO
TAKE THE TOUGH VOTE.
>> Martha: SO NO ONE SURPRISED
YOU?
>> NO, THEY ARE KEEPING IT LIKE
WE HAD UNDER THE DEMOCRATS.
THAT'S THE DISAPPOINTING THING.
WE PROMISED THEM TO BE BETTER.
THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS
