seven years of savage fighting have left swath of Syria in ruins but slowly there are signs of recovery the ancient city of Palmyra is undergoing painstaking repair right now after its Roman remains sustained extensive damage by Islamic state Aleppo is also seeing major reconstruction even tempting enough for some foreign visitors to return summer nights girls going out to meet their friends in the center of the Christian town of micarta Syria August 2018 since 2015 I've been to Syria every year so 2016 I was able to go to Palmyra after the first liberation and then 2017 I was able to go to Aleppo three months after the liberation and this year I'm I returned and I went a bit all over the country actually was time on the two-hour train ride from Tarsus to Latakia this lovely Syrian woman asked me where I was from and then wanted a photograph with me soon I hope tourists will no longer be such a rarity to this wonderful country I pray for peace in this land people would just stop in the street and come up to me and shake my hand and embrace me and offer me tea and coffee and they would say to me thank you for coming because you know they haven't seen any strangers for you know seven eight years and they really missed it and they're really happy to see a foreigner even a foreigner from a supposedly hostile power it really doesn't make any difference it just happy to see someone who's interested in the situation in their country and interested in them and Wow the Welcome that I had was just incredible as long as people aren't expecting you know 5-star hotels and they're willing to to really get to know the people in the land I'd say very very soon I think tourism could start it yeah but I mean of course there are ruins everywhere you know it's um it's difficult you know it's a it is suffering from the aftermath of war you
