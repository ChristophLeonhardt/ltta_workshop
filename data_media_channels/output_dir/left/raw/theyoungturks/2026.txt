1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,730
SO JOE CROWLEY IS A
CONGRESSMAN FROM NEW YORK, VERY

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,999
POWERFUL, ARGUABLY ONE OF THE
TOP DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE.

3
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,999
WHY?

4
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:10,410
HE RAISES A LOT OF MONEY, WE
WILL SHOW YOU IN A SECOND, BUT

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,799
SOMEONE IS FINALLY CHALLENGING
HIM, ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ.

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:14,879
SHE'S

7
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,980
DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL, CROWLEY
HAS NEVER HAD A CHALLENGE LIKE

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,630
THIS BEFORE, HENCE ME DUBBING
HER ALEXANDRIA THE GREAT.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,090
YESTERDAY WE HAD MIGHTY MARY
WILSON, ANOTHER JUSTICE DEMOCRAT

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,369
RUNNING IN TEXAS, CHECK THAT OUT
AS WELL, WE HAVE ALL OF OUR

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,510
INTERVIEWS WITH THESE GREAT
CANDIDATES ON TYT POLITICS.

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,510
SHE

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:43,690
IS TRYING TO GET TO 10,000
SIGNATURES TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,920
ON THE BALLOT AND EVERYTHING IS
KOSHER.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,940
OF COURSE WHAT DOES JOE

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,710
CROWLEY DO?

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,350
HE CONTROLS A LOT OF
THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE IN THAT

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,050
AREA, SO CONVENIENTLY ALL OF A
SUDDEN VOTING AREAS ARE

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,100
BEGINNING TO CHANGE.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,100
OH, THAT I
HEAVILY MINORITY DISTRICT THAT

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,410
MIGHT FAVOR OCASIO-CORTEZ?

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,019
YEAH,
WE AREN'T GOING TO VOTE THERE

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,019
ANYMORE.

24
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,230
THE POLLING STATION,
WHAT A BREAK, WE HAVE TO MOVE

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,540
IT.

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,640
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE
IN NEW YORK.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,380
PER MEMBER WHEN ALL

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,550
OF A SUDDEN VOTER PURGES RIGHT
BEFORE THE PRIMARY.

29
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,550
SO THIS IS

30
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,500
IN SOME WAYS, AND THIS IS
HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,930
COUNTRY, BUT THIS IS A
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT RACE IN

32
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,360
NEW YORK BECAUSE CROWLEY IS SUCH
A POWER PLAYER IN THE DEMOCRAT

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,010
PARTY, BERNIE SANDERS VERSUS
HILLARY CLINTON ALL OVER AGAIN.

34
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,970
SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY I DON'T
WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE AGAIN,

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,380
AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT THINK I
WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT

36
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,740
MOVIE BUT GIVE IT A DIFFERENT
ENDING.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
AND HERE IS YOUR

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
OPPORTUNITY.

39
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,220
SO OCASIO-CORTEZ, VERY
PROGRESSIVE, A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT,

40
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,390
TAKES NO CORPORATE PAC MONEY,
MEDICARE FOR ALL, CROWLEY HAS TO

41
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,760
BE BROUGHT TO SOME OF THOSE
POSITIONS, LIKE MEDICARE FOR

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,030
ALL, ONLY AFTER HE GETS A
PRIMARY OPPONENT.

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,030
BEFORE HE

44
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,360
WASN'T FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL,
JUSTICE DEMOCRATS INTRODUCED

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,530
OCASIO-CORTEZ AS A PRIMARY OPPONENT
AND SUPPORTED THE MEDICARE FOR ALL

46
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,170
BILL IN THE HOUSE AND ALL OF A
SUDDEN CROWLEY SAYS THAT'S WHAT

47
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,350
I MEANT!

48
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,350
INTERESTING.

49
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,600
SO WHY
DOES CROWLEY HAVE THIS POWER IN

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY?

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
IS IT
BECAUSE HE'S PROGRESSIVE?

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
NO.

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,890
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MONEY,
LEBOWSKI.

54
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,890
LET ME SHOW YOU THE

55
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:35,400
MONEY CROWLEY HAS RAISED, THIS
IS HIS TOTAL IN HIS CAREER, IF

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,570
YOU ADD SECURITIES AND
INVESTMENT, INSURANCE, AND

57
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,730
COMMERCIAL BANKS, THAT'S AROUND
$4.2 MILLION.

58
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,110
THAT THE FINANCIAL

59
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,110
INDUSTRY.

60
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,600
REAL ESTATE IS ALSO
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IN NEW YORK

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,680
AND LEADS TO A LOT OF
CORRUPTION, THAT IS $1.6

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
MILLION.

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,320
TOGETHER THAT'S ABOUT
$5.8 MILLION.

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,390
CROWLEY AND OTHER

65
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,930
DEMOCRATS LOOK AT THAT AND GO
BRAVO, WAY TO RAISE A LOT OF

66
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,260
MONEY FROM BANKERS.

67
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,040
EXCELLENT
JOB, CROWLEY.

68
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
REAL PEOPLE LOOK

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,140
AT THAT AND GO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE

70
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,560
PEOPLE WHO GAVE YOU $5.8
MILLION?

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,260
YOU THINK BANKERS GAVE

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
CROWLEY MONEY FOR THEIR HEALTH?

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,970
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A

74
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,970
CHARITY?

75
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,590
NO, THEY GAVE THAT
MONEY FOR A RETURN ON

76
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,420
INVESTMENT, AN INVESTMENT THEY
HAVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,400
HENCE DONATIONS TO CROWLEY OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
BUT HERE COMES

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,630
ALEXANDRIA AND SHE DOESN'T TAKE
ANY OF THEIR MONEY, SHE DOESN'T

80
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,220
TAKE ANY OF IT.

81
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,820
SO HOW ARE YOU
GO TO CORRUPT HER?

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
WELL, YOU

83
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,430
CAN'T. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

84
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,520
SO LET ME SHOW YOU JUST THIS

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,070
LAST ELECTION CYCLE, BECAUSE THE
FIRST TIME THE BANKERS GAVE YOU

86
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,350
MONEY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN
ACCIDENT, THE SECOND AND THE

87
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,790
THIRD AND THE EIGHTH TIME THEY
GAVE YOU MONEY IT'S NOT AN

88
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,480
ACCIDENT, THAT MEANS THEY GOT
THEIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT, SO

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,530
HERE'S THE LATEST CROWLEY CHART
FROM THE LATEST INVESTMENT

90
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,290
CYCLE.

91
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,069
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM, CAN
YOU TELL WHICH INDUSTRY GIVES

92
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,080
JOE THE MOST AMOUNT MONEY?

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,660
OH
YEAH, THERE IS AGAIN, FINANCE,

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,459
INSURANCE, AND REAL ESTATE AT
$726,000.

95
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,050
SO THE MONEY KEEPS ON

96
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,430
ROLLING IN.

97
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,610
THOSE ARE NOT
NONPROFIT CONTRIBUTIONS, THOSE

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,620
ARE INVESTMENTS.

99
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,290
SO JOE THE
BANKER CROWLEY DOING GREAT WITH

100
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,290
THOSE GUYS.

101
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,730
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?

102
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,190
THE ONLY WAY THE SMALL DONOR

103
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,940
CANDIDATES AND THE NO CORPORATE
PAC CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO WIN

104
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,680
IS IF YOU ACTUALLY GET BACK.

105
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,780
SO
OCASIO2018.COM/LASTCALL TO

106

VOLUNTEER, SHE HAS 100
VOLUNTEERS RIGHT NOW, SHE NEEDS

THE BANKER DOLLARS DUE FOR
CROWLEY, THE JUSTICE DEMOCRAT

112
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:02,000
FOLKS ARE MUCH BETTER AT
SPENDING MONEY BECAUSE THEY

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,220
LARGELY RELY ON VOLUNTEERS AND
GRASSROOTS.

114
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,100

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,900
WIN TO BEGIN WITH.

117
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,690
CROWLEY HAS
NEVER REALLY BEEN CHALLENGED.

A

119
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,180
LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO
WIN.

120
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,600
BRENT WELDER IN KANSAS HAS

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,530
A BIG LEAD ON A REPUBLICAN
INCUMBENT.

122
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,530
MIGHTY MARY WILSON IS

123
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,630
