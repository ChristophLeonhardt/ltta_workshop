1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:15,139
I think the interesting thing about the

2
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,510
question of do young people care about

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,580
mass surveillance or do young people

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,160
care about civil liberties around

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,689
privacy I think when EDD<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miliband came</font>

6
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,949
and spoke it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

7
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,689
there was a lot of jokes among the

8
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,310
audience of all there goes miles talking

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,960
about mass surveillance but afterwards

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,670
and everyone was crowded around our

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,170
Miliband's and I went over and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,360
all asking him about it and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes to a broader question which is how</font>

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">does a society function with democracy</font>

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,890
if and how do the electorate help

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,130
influence policy and give consent if

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,170
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not knowledgeable about it and I</font>

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,110
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real concrete issues with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ</font>

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,880
is reports come out recently from a

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,040
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> tribunal which is the first in</font>

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,710
history that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has found that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the acts of</font>

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">GCHQ between 2007 and 2014 was illegal</font>

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
what can labour do to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up against</font>

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,570
it because there was a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,719
had spoke about the first question I

26
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,700
asked in which he didn't answer was can

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,310
he do his job if<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ have access to his</font>

28
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,679
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> email he didn't answer that and</font>

29
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:29,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing he brought up was well</font>

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,789
yeah absolutely this is a global issue

31
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:35,990
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a absolutely and he then</font>

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,689
brought up Lee Rigby<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Willett and</font>

33
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,280
he said I understand you care about

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,899
civil liberties miles but think about

35
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,270
Lee Rigby's family which I thought was

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,789
an interesting emotional twist on on the

37
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,840
answering the question because I

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,579
followed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> story very well and</font>

39
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,049
actually if you look at what happened

40
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,749
the authorities knew about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people</font>

41
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:57,319
they were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> on facebook one of the</font>

42
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,869
commissioners talking about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ</font>

43
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,389
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook is a safe haven for</font>

44
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,819
terrorism it's very Orwellian language

45
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,300
and so when I see Theresa May and she

46
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,318
actually popped round my house the other

47
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:11,810
day because she I mean not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just randomly</font>

48
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I'm in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maidenhead and she was</font>

49
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,430
campaigning and I think

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,989
you couldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> picked a worse door to</font>

51
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,599
knock on she and she was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

52
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,980
it and she sent me a letter afterwards

53
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,390
before the report<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out it being</font>

54
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,269
illegal but who's going to stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

55
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conservatives that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing the</font>

56
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,540
snoopers<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter if we're going to call</font>

57
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,189
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because as far as I was</font>

58
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:34,060
concerned ed<font color="#E5E5E5"> miliband is so terrified of</font>

59
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,950
if we don't take action he told me

60
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,840
afterwards if a terrorist attack happens

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
and we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> put through legislation</font>

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,219
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> media's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to eat you up and I</font>

63
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like how can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we how can we dictate</font>

64
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,450
how can we run policy if it's based on

65
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,700
fear and I just say a few things here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

66
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,470
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a balance that you've</font>

67
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,000
got strike and it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,030
back yes between civil liberties which

69
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,120
are extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and also safety</font>

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and allowing the security services who</font>

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,090
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep us safe to do their</font>

72
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,909
job properly and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that</font>

73
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,079
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their job properly you</font>

74
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,780
have to have proper accountability of

75
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,030
the security services yes now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

76
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,790
some extent we we we still struggle with

77
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,129
that where's the legal for sonia's well

78
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,139
but but the fact that it's found out

79
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,479
that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

80
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,729
wasn't legal is actually quite important

81
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,769
and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at least a bit of the</font>

82
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,650
system if somewhat belatedly is worked

83
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,970
and you've begun to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font>

84
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,129
accountability so we have to find ways

85
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,189
of getting making sure that the security

86
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,280
services who in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they're</font>

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,949
there to do a job in protecting us and

88
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:45,909
but do so with the appropriate respect

89
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,859
our civil liberties and parliament has a

90
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,129
role in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the joint security committee</font>

91
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,799
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment in trying to ensure that</font>

92
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,829
mi5 and mi6 are accountable for what

93
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,439
they do they're also accountable to the

94
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,199
government you then have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this worry that</font>

95
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,329
you're understandably talking about

96
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the capacity for mass surveillance</font>

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,669
which has come with the new technologies

98
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,139
that we've got specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

99
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">wide web collecting metadata on all of</font>

100
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,720
those things and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think having lived in</font>

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,060
a world where that didn't happen where

102
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,180
there was a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have privacy I'm</font>

103
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,139
far less certain now that real privacy

104
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,000
the way that the web was developed his

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,440
actual

106
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,740
be attainable now there are ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,960
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to Tim berners-lee and</font>

108
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,030
people like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can redesign</font>

109
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,690
the web to create whatever she<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't but</font>

110
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,710
there is also an issue that Apple Google

111
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,440
and all of the big companies that have

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,420
actually created this infrastructure and

113
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,590
controlling now don't want it to be

114
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,840
encrypted in quite that way because they

115
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,330
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite like to be able to throw</font>

116
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,640
advert shatters which demonstrate which

117
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,670
respond to the kind of searching we've

118
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,260
been doing on the web we've all got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

119
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you have a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a new car</font>

120
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,290
and all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get cars</font>

121
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,360
constantly whenever you go on your bone

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,940
or you you compute it so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

123
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some big profound issues about the</font>

124
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,990
meaning of privacy and how we can

125
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,650
balance civil liberties and safety which

126
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,920
it's hard to slogan eyes about in you

127
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,450
know Tim berners-lee you mentioned he

128
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,520
talks about having a digital Magna Carta

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,290
yeah I think I think that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

130
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">good and interesting idea and I think</font>

131
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to explore that kind of</font>

132
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,860
concept for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new structures that we</font>

133
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,930
find ourselves assisting in what's going

134
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,790
in the policy because that's exploring

135
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,890
and we seem to agree on some level is to

136
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,630
it but what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> in like what's going</font>

137
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change it's actually going to just</font>

138
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,600
like John very quick point to this which

139
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,580
is that I think one of the problems that

140
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,200
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this country over a very</font>

141
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,450
long period of time is that the debate

142
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">around civil liberties has only taken</font>

143
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,810
place in the heat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> passion of a</font>

144
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,450
tragedy or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrorist incident I think</font>

145
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,370
one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Labour could do</font>

146
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,530
and we haven't committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this but</font>

147
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,000
it's something that I think is worth

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,030
putting on the agenda is we could commit

149
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,310
having that<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate as fully and openly</font>

150
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,660
as possible at a time when we're not

151
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no we've definitely had to</font>

152
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,560
terrorism a second second so this is

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is a fair point and actually when</font>

154
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,700
ed told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about the fear I respect that</font>

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,550
like as human beings and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can look at</font>

156
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> military industrial complex in the</font>

157
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. like Barack Obama will get told by</font>

158
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,250
the Secret Service we need investment

159
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,320
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> military to prevent this is he</font>

160
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,210
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the one that says know if he</font>

161
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,610
has to trust their advice so we have to

162
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">what they say but I find that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

163
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,840
political sphere at the moment we can

164
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,210
look at all issues immigration we can

165
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,120
look at surveillance and terrorism at

166
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,969
the economy in dealing with the deficit

167
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Conservatives are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not with them at</font>

168
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,289
all and agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what they say but</font>

169
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,659
they are battering<font color="#E5E5E5"> labor in with the</font>

170
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:04,590
rhetoric of<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are tougher on dick</font>

171
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,330
dealing with terrorism because if you

172
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,310
were to try and defend civil liberties

173
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,169
it but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might let a terrorist</font>

174
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,509
attack and so when David Miliband at

175
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:15,659
story of Ed Miliband<font color="#CCCCCC"> heroin it yeah I</font>

176
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,520
know I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe heaven and through that</font>

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">during leaders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life so when Ed Miliband</font>

178
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,330
and said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about the Lee Rigby thing</font>

179
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,120
it angered me because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I want</font>

180
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">him to be on my side like I want someone</font>

181
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Parliament so when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Conservatives</font>

182
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,060
at the moment are talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

183
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,039
rid of encryption you can look at the

184
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,050
conservative sorry it's encrypted well

185
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,210
well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works anything about I would say</font>

186
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,000
about that I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> genuinely</font>

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,250
don't think that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about being</font>

188
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,379
worried about the media I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

189
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,629
suddenly a media storm that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

190
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">very hard to have a rational sensible</font>

191
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,250
debate around these things when you have

192
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,159
tragic episodes like the Lee Rigby

193
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,960
murder which was quite close to home for

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,599
me but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he's much more</font>

195
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,430
mindful of actually is that the

196
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,199
responsibility on politicians to make

197
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,849
sensible decisions about that balance

198
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,889
between people security and safety and

199
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,439
about civil liberties and I don't think

200
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can accuse I'd Miliband of not being</font>

201
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,490
brave you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he spent the last week</font>

202
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,569
being absolutely attacked across the

203
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,240
media for standing up to people very

204
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,949
wealthy people in corporations who don't

205
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,250
pay their taxes and I'm not she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

206
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,020
the way but but I think one of the

207
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,639
biggest things that we could do is

208
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,319
commit to having this debate in this

209
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,049
discussion in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Parliament led</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by a Labour</font>

210
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,120
government where we didn't start from

211
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,309
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point that you talked about</font>

212
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the Tories say it because it's got</font>

213
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,809
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable so that's my original</font>

214
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,519
point which is do young people care

215
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,470
about civil liberties and surveillance

216
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,100
and privacy it's actually does anyone

217
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,540
care about it and what you find is

218
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,390
people do care about it when they know

219
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,630
about it and to what extent is our

220
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,880
networked world now can you actually

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,610
have it because Facebook and the way

222
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,180
that young people use facebook is fine

223
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,250
and fun as it far as it goes but they

224
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,920
can't have a white<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat right history so</font>

225
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,250
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from my childhood I</font>

226
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,200
mean I'd the Facebook didn't I'm so old

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,180
Facebook didn't exist when I was a child

228
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,880
and my goodness would I I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

229
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I might have right written but but</font>

230
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and kids now put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all up online</font>

231
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,690
and this is why such trees are may I

232
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,460
said that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the political class</font>

233
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,600
social media has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around maybe let's</font>

234
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,460
say 15 years let's say that so people

235
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">who have a young age have lived</font>

236
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,320
discovered who they are online with a

237
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,510
digital footprint and they are having

238
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,000
legislation put by a political elite who

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,310
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Internet past and there's</font>

240
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,060
that big disconnect there and I just

241
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one issue but we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

242
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,270
about like what is the role of

243
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,280
government to protect the people to

244
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,960
educate because obviously there are a

245
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,670
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go behind closed</font>

246
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,110
doors with what Facebook and Google are

247
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,030
doing on my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube channel I</font>

248
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,210
research quite easily on your iPhone but

249
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,830
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't realize location</font>

250
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,750
settings you look on it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will tell you</font>

251
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the exact time you've left your street</font>

252
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,870
that should be a government the

253
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,520
government should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be educating people</font>

254
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,560
about their I got encryption for my

255
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,270
phone and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was saying I'm mentioned to</font>

256
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ed within six weeks i had two thousand</font>

257
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,060

258
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Underground's to access my phone in my</font>

259
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,590
data suck up my email info you know and

260
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,450
I'm educating people when people get

261
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,770
interested it's like wow I didn't know

262
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,920
this exists like we as a public can do

263
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,630
that but like that's why you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

264
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,220
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the debate before you</font>

265
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,430
decide what action yeah so you're saying

266
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,500
what is in the manifesto I think we have

267
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the debate about what that</font>

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,550
balance between security and safety and

269
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,020
privacy how is that written where I

270
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday because I'm actually write</font>

271
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,600
that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a talking</font>

272
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
point of the election and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

273
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,540
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry is one I think it will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

274
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,610
talking point at the election because of

275
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,040
the issues that are before us already

276
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,170
with counterterrorism and all of those

277
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,700
things but what I suppose we're both

278
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,710
saying and I think what you're saying as

279
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,780
well if we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> much deeper debate</font>

280
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">it about the implications of some of</font>

281
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,940
this technology where it's going is it

282
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,280
good it was it that we can anticipate is

283
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,930
there it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there a sort of suggestion</font>

284
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,320
that you've got maybe about how we could

285
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,640
mainstream that into a manifesto whether

286
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,590
it's the young<font color="#CCCCCC"> britain manifesto or our</font>

287
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,290
party manifesto about a commitment to

288
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,110
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of what is it the whole</font>

289
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,090
digital Magna Carta thing sounds a bit

290
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,070
of a cliche<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to give</font>

291
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,900
it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> title but you know digital</font>

292
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,760
rights and it's also hard because it's a

293
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">global issue and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know with what they</font>

294
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,990
say is varies doing in that mean for

295
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,830
example just just to give you an example

296
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the with websites we had a</font>

297
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,030
constituent of mine attacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> by fascists</font>

298
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,880
on his front doorstep and they had this

299
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,680
thing called<font color="#E5E5E5"> red watch that they put him</font>

300
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,140
up on telling everybody all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

301
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,420
thugs where he lived so that he would be

302
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,340
beat not need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> beaten up and his</font>

303
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,740
daughter was put in a very difficult

304
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,830
situation and so I did a debate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

305
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,650
on an adjournment debate saying the

306
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,390
government can we take this website down

307
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,360
you know it's being hosted its orbits

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,100
inciting violence violence has happened

309
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,360
what are you going to do about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

310
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,280
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically said or when would you</font>

311
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,220
know we can't do anything so this is

312
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,190
other issues as well as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as these</font>

313
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,260
issues of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are about</font>

314
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,160
incitement criminality child pornography

315
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,920
and abuse all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those things and the</font>

316
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
answers to them are a lot harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,940
they used can you have something

318
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,220
concrete in your manifesto because what

319
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,170
a lot of people who grew up under the

320
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,880
last Labour government remember what a

321
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">labor the government did to civil</font>

322
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,170
liberties and I was 42 day detention and

323
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,200
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Iraq war and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was ID</font>

324
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,530
cards and these things you know stick in

325
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,870
the minds of people and so what we

326
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want is something concrete so</font>

327
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,400
that you know we can hold you to account

328
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,740
because last time you didn't do a very

329
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,570
good job I mean you know putting you on

330
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,680
the spot so it doesn't have to be right

331
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,860
now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a suggestion around</font>

332
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,690
that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really welcome it and</font>

333
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,400
particularly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next few</font>

334
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,380
days I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

335
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,300
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Magna Carta sounds or a</font>

336
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,860
digital Bill of Rights or something

337
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,390
similar sounds something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be</font>

338
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,790
concrete and and can you can see what

339
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,430
your rights are yeah yeah that and even

340
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">though it is it's a tagline the digital</font>

341
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,660
magna carta de saints<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to pop</font>

342
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,340
yeah yeah yeah d and definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

343
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">neither the final point I was going to</font>

344
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,850
make was off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of branching of this is</font>

345
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,960
when you look at like the Ripper

346
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,690
legislation as well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when it was</font>

347
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,850
actually discussed and put through there

348
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,080
was a lot of caveats that weren't

349
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,840
discovered until<font color="#E5E5E5"> May public till</font>

350
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,400
recently which is it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> involves</font>

351
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,910
lawyers and journalists and I think

352
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also incredibly scary of how</font>

353
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,770
people lawyers are you know doctors how

354
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,540
can people like that do their job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

355
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,860
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the question I said about</font>

356
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,810
can he do his job if all his personal

357
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,500
emails are in you know access can be

358
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,710
accessed by GCHQ and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel like</font>

359
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,950
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cessna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption and like you</font>

360
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,000
know we can debate about all these

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,650
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agree on the</font>

362
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,350
values of<font color="#E5E5E5"> no actually only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ they</font>

363
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,090
should be worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean no the</font>

364
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,490
hacking the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking your</font>

365
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,560
revelations demonstrate that actually

366
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
the news of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world was routinely</font>

367
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,970
right hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's my crowbar the</font>

368
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference is private differences how do</font>

369
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,440
you say that systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ is paid by</font>

370
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,810
taxes as well and there's a big

371
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,060
difference because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are paying</font>

372
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,070
taxes because and me we have to or else

373
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,260
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to jail yep and they are doing it</font>

374
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,400
GCHQ needs to be properly accountable to

375
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,110
the people in our democracy that

376
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,700
represent people and that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

377
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,710
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier how you have</font>

378
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,840
accountability for what the security

379
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">services do but likewise i think that</font>

380
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,080
commercial companies be they the new the

381
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,450
defunct news of the world or other

382
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,850
companies also need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accountable</font>

383
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,540
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they behave at when they're</font>

384
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,400
breaking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> law as well which they</font>

385
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,260
clearly were doing about you know he's

386
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">pro proper structures that are thorough</font>

387
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,510
about being accountable we need to kind

388
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,160
of put these policies in place and come

389
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with some kind of Magna Carta but you</font>

390
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,730
also need to pledge to educate people

391
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,770
about that magma heart join me like this

392
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,320
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it be</font>

393
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,760
she don't try to get lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ice that</font>

394
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something that I let it to every</font>

395
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,360
every house of the whole country<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

396
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,580
might here are your eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's</font>

397
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because this point about</font>

398
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,080
education hasn't really come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far I</font>

399
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I'm right in saying through the</font>

400
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,260
consultation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with young</font>

401
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,110
people but these are real issue actually

402
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,700
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on our</font>

403
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">agenda and I don't know exactly what the</font>

404
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,260
best way to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's part</font>

405
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,630
of a you know revisited sort citizenship

406
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,610
package or we we control the curriculum

407
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,650
and I think it's an honor curriculum is

408
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,930
embarrassing like the fact I'm 25 I

409
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,980
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely understand how</font>

410
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,630
Parliament works you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and that's</font>

411
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,460
that's something I'm not I'm not from an

412
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,570
under privileged background by any

413
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,890
stretch of the imagination it would find

414
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,500
bad parliamentarians well thank you but

415
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,850
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we are actually in</font>

416
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,440
control of its not some smoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> emitting I</font>

417
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
don't know I nobody knows about it as a

418
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,350
curriculum everybody has to attend

419
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,330
school we<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the curriculum and it</font>

420
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,640
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an education it's all about</font>

421
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,230
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> should we have more life skills at</font>

422
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,820
schools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first aid and you know</font>

423
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,670
digital rights like why we're committed

424
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,760
to introducing sex and relationships

425
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,170
educational to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> curriculum so that</font>

426
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,580
young people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that they</font>

427
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,900
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep themselves safe and we've</font>

428
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,410
we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as being online</font>

429
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,910
skills as what you know keeping safer on

430
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,560
the online<font color="#E5E5E5"> community as well as in the</font>

431
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,680
real world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the point that you</font>

432
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,500
make about protecting your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data keeping</font>

433
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,050
yourself safe and when you're using

434
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,810
social media and understanding the

435
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,640
implications of the choices that you're

436
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,830
making I think these are all points that

437
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,300
are really well made and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

438
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,570
something that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think about my</font>

439
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,420
final quick question about privacy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

440
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,400
respect whatever answer you give we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

441
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,160
about telling you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air for</font>

442
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,839
accountability so would<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all agree</font>

443
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,849
that thank God we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

444
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,439
Edward Snowden who come forward and

445
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,180
exposed the illegal tease that took

446
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,030
place well I think Edward Snowden is a

447
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,780
mixed bag<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um partially because he</font>

448
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,949
he put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people at risk in just</font>

449
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,099
making all of that stuff Willie nearly

450
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,720
whatever it was was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> willingly though</font>

451
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,150
it was it just just released all of it

452
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's some very important</font>

453
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,650
issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's brought to light by</font>

454
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,790
doing it but he's also I think

455
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,640
shown a lack of consideration and

456
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,670
concern for the implications of some of

457
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,440
the information that he's released so I

458
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he's a mix back from that point of</font>

459
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,220
view and whistleblowers are always

460
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,500
important but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being completely</font>

461
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">indiscriminate about it i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is it</font>

462
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have spoiled it up because i</font>

463
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,540
completely agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but what it</font>

464
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,430
tells you i think is the power of data

465
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,680
and information and who controls

466
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,540
information which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is at the heart of a</font>

467
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,980

468
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,690
now talking about replacing all workers

469
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,580
with algorithms in the future because

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have a they went over well</font>

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">editions one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we have</font>

472
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,820
been exploring really<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously is how</font>

473
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,390
we open up more data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and information to</font>

474
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,940
not just to outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Whitehall and</font>

475
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Westminster but actually to citizens in</font>

476
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,670
a way that citizens can access and use

477
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,530
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to inform the choices that they</font>

478
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,850
make and how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold their own</font>

479
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,950
services to account and there's some

480
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,780
stunning examples of how that's been

481
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,180
done around the country but they are

482
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,580
they are isolated examples and we've

483
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,990
been looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> really seriously through</font>

484
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,060
the policy review that genre de<font color="#E5E5E5"> San</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Angelo a leading to see how we can</font>

486
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,070
mainstream that information knowledge is

487
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,940
power and has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used wisely and with</font>

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,460
respect for people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their safety and</font>

489
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,490
their private<font color="#E5E5E5"> life but if we can open</font>

490
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that up much more I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll end up</font>

491
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,750
with much better public services and

492
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,640
probably a much more equal society as

493
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,950
well everyone always has an issue of

494
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,750
what is key for them who they're gonna

495
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,790
vote for in the election and I quite

496
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,440
openly say<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I have a real</font>

497

trouble one thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for labor I</font>

498
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,550
have said that if they did come forward

499
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,410
and take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand for civil liberties and</font>

500
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,880
privacy they would have my way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

511
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,420
this interesting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

512
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,559
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> console</font>

513
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,090
tations you don't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from young but</font>

514
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it's cuz they just don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

515
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,600
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've heard things around this so</font>

516
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,669
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example at the event where we</font>

517
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:59,620
launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shape your future</font>

518
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,399
consultation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know issues like</font>

519
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,129
snapchat k yeah yeah and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

520
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,200
there are questions along with theme

521
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,639
that I think have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised with us</font>

522
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,799
quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more but we have been happier</font>

523
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,749
best kind of decision doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah</font>

524
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,269
but I mean the report today that

525
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:17,120
basically said that half of all girls

526
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,059
have been have been bullied and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

527
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:23,139
into sex or sexual acts I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

528
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,999
astonishing the amount of pressure that

529
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,700
has been put on young girls now by some

530
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,440
of these new technologies the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

531
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">bullying the thing that that term that</font>

532
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,619
canna press boys as well as girls at

533
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:39,320
really difficult times it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

534
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,850
just something that's that where the

535
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,450
technologies gone far ahead of where

536
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,129
sort of debate in society has gone and

537
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,440
we've really got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a handle on the</font>

538
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,850
sheer pressure the young boys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> girls</font>

539
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,399
are under I mean boys and girls when

540
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,960
they're young adolescents or even

541
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,960
younger now and being put under by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

542
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,629
power of social media I put to you that

543
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not social media and I'd</font>

544
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,019
say while it's now trackable and visible

545
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,610
that's been happening I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

546
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,139
say worse but that's been happening for

547
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,580
generations like that none of your bees

548
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,220
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit no actually now it's</font>

549
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible now we can be productive</font>

550
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,940
yesterday me that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

551
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,889
responsibility to change Vegas not

552
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">socially I really agree with you it's a</font>

553
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,330
societal problem yeah but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font>

554
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something about I think it isn't it I</font>

555
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,080
think there's something about what's

556
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,289
happened online<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we haven't created</font>

557
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,840
the same safety structures that we have

558
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,629
in society in the online community I see

559
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,249
those traditional structures failing all

560
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:40,940
the time as sure I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

561
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,159
right and not got it already look I

562
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,659
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> look we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font>

563
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is easy to say let's fix Facebook</font>

564
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,649
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is that</font>

565
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,200
we've we've we've started to really get

566
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,759
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue on to the agenda in the last</font>

567
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,440
few years and a lot of my labor

568
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,179
colleagues have really really pushed

569
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,070
this so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've had these</font>

570
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,720
debates about sex and relationship

571
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,820
education why don't you boys understand

572
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,250
concepts like consent in an astonishing

573
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,999
minority of

574
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,519
cases what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do to equip girls with</font>

575
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,409
tools to be able to push back against

576
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:11,239
some of this and we've had those debates

577
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:13,279
but it's got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move into the online</font>

578
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,159
sphere as well absolutely but let's not

579
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,869

581
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,169
I want to see is words like consent in

582

594
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:48,819
time but now we have that social

595
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,349
responsibility to see it and really

596
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:52,729
tackle it yeah rather than it being

597
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:54,319
