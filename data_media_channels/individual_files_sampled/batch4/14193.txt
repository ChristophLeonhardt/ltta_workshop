looks like Kathleen Wynn the fearless leader of the Ontario Liberals is actually very fearful indeed so much so that with regime change imminent she recently promised to fire herself as leader after election day will this turn around the fortunes of that sinking garbage barge known as the SS liberal premier wins announcement to quit as leader was shocking albeit not unprecedented for example in 2001 NDP BC premier wildest Onge conceded defeat days before that provinces election but he nevertheless urged British Columbians to elect a quote strong effective opposition to hold mr. Campbell's feet to the fire end quote the result of this last-second Hail Mary pass well the Liberals won 77 seats whereas the NDP was reduced to a party that could have a caucus meeting within the confines of a Mazda Miata but back to present-day Ontario recently when did a Monday morning martyr marks going from 1 Toronto mainstream media outlet to another in order to elicit both votes and sympathy her interview with CFRB morning man John Moore truly stood out as fascinating for all the wrong reasons morass win if there's any danger that she might lose her own seat of Don Valley West come Thursday and somehow someway win changed the discussion to make it all about the diversity of Don Valley West and how this rioting exists as a multicultural microcosm of Toronto itself for example she mentioned that when she goes to the gym she can hear at least five different languages spoken now that's not surprising to me the fact that many of those diverse gym members are polite enough not to speak disparagingly about win in a language that she can understand while she's standing there but what wind didn't talk about is that there is some diversity in Don Valley West that is accommodated at the expense of Canadian values and principles for example Valley Park middle school was the first Toronto school to embrace a gender apartheid mosque for Islamic prayers on Fridays boy stood at the front girls at the back and girls on their menstrual cycle well they're at the very back of this makeshift mosque because they're considered on clean and therefore haram yes indeed we are talking Toronto in 2018 not Turan here and yes we are talking about a publicly funded school that's supposed to be secular a school that's supposed to be committed to gender equity ie girls are equal to boys but those principles are also apparently Haram at Valley Park and so it is that the Toronto District School Board actually decided to sacrifice its own value set on the altar political correctness in order to appease to hardline Islamic extremists just a few minutes north of Valley Park is the taxpayer-funded Dennis R Trimble Resource Center guess what folks this facility stages Sharia compliant swimming pool sessions meaning only women can go for a dip at designated times even the windows are covered up burqa style so if you're a parent and you wanted to watch your daughter swim well tough luck and it is in the Flemington Park area of wins writing that you will perhaps observe the highest percentage of burqas and niqabs in all of Toronto so as you can imagine there's lots of tolerance for intolerance here don't get me wrong if a Muslim wants to have sex segregated Friday prayers at a mosque or within a private Islamic school pay fine by me but when my tax dollars go toward funding Sharia law in this great Dominion the line hasn't just been crossed it's been eradicated and another thing if Kathleen Wynne who is openly lesbian by the way and therefore very much hotter up there on the infidel scale if when can't even have an honest conversation about misogynistic practices that are occurring in her own writing then how do we even know that her promise to fire herself is genuine how do we know there's not some you know unspoken fine print here that this pledge is yet another stretch goal aka wind speak for lying through one's tea well the answer is we don't know indeed we can't trust anything that comes out of the mouth of a premier who has come to resemble a cross between Pinocchio and the little boy who cried wolf all of which kinda explains why win and the Liberals find themselves in such dire straits to begin with for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
