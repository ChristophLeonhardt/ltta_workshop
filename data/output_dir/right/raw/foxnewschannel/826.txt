1
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,488
>> DHS IS NO LONGER IGNORING THE

2
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:14,755
LAW.

3
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:15,423
WE ARE ENFORCING THE LAWS AS

4
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:16,557
THEY EXIST ON THE BOOKS.

5
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,726
AS LONG AS ILLEGAL ENTRY REMAINS

6
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,194
A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, DHS WILL NOT

7
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:22,563
LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

8
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:24,565
DHS WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE

9
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:25,600
LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS AS WE

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,336
ARE SWORN TO DO.

11
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:30,237
AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY, SURELY

12
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:33,341
IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE

13
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:34,375
UNRAVELING OF DEMOCRACY WHEN THE

14
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,845
BODY WHO MAKES THE LAWS, INSTEAD

15
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,947
OF CHANGING THEM, TELLS THE

16
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,216
ENFORCEMENT BODY NOT TO ENFORCE

17
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:42,950
THE LAW.

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,152
I ASKED CONGRESS TO ASK THIS

19
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,755
WEEK SO WE CAN SECURE OUR

20
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,457
BORDERS AND UPHOLD OUR

21
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:50,391
HUMANITARIAN IDEAS.

22
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:52,059
THESE TWO MISSIONS SHOULD NOT BE

23
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:52,960
PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,428
IF WE CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES, WE

25
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:58,065
CAN ACCOMPLISH BOTH.

26
00:00:58,065 --> 00:00:58,833
>> Bret: THE PICTURES ARE

27
00:00:58,833 --> 00:00:59,567
HORRIBLE.

28
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,334
THE EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.

29
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,770
THE CRITICISM IS ALL OVER THE

30
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,004
PLACE, AND THE BLAME GAME HAS

31
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,941
BEGUN IN EARNEST.

32
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,976
>> WE CAN DO THIS VERY QUICKLY

33
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:10,211
IF THE DEMOCRATS COME TO THE

34
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:10,745
TABLE.

35
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,480
EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO IT.

36
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,415
WE WANT TO DO IT MORE THAN THEY

37
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:14,682
DO.

38
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:16,917
>> THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE US

39
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:20,988
CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE CHILDREN

40
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:21,422
AND DREAMERS.

41
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:22,390
>> OUR DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS, EVERY

42
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,758
TIME THEY HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO

43
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,359
VOTE FOR A SOLUTION, THEY HAVE

44
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,527
VOTED AGAINST IT.

45
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,863
SO I HOPE THEY CHANGE THEIR

46
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:29,463
APPROACH.

47
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:32,033
>> PUT IT ON THE FLOOR AND LET

48
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:35,770
THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE VOTE.

49
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,072
AND YET THEY SLUMBER STILL.

50
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:39,006
>> Bret: WITH THAT, LET'S

51
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:41,075
BRING IN THE PANEL.

52
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:46,147
FORMER CA ANALYST BUCK SEXTON.

53
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,548
MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL

54
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:48,349
CORRESPONDENT AT NATIONAL PUBLIC

55
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:48,649
RADIO.

56
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:49,650
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR

57
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,552
AT "THE FEDERALIST."

58
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,754
SEEMS LIKE THIS IS COMING TO A

59
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:54,555
HEAD.

60
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:55,723
>> IT'S BEEN CONFUSING BECAUSE

61
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:57,291
THIS WAS A POLICY THAT WAS MEANT

62
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,160
AS A DETERRENT AND DESCRIBED AS

63
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,394
A DETERRENT BY JEFF SESSIONS AND

64
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:00,728
OTHERS.

65
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:01,429
DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS HERE

66
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:02,363
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET

67
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,365
SEPARATED FROM THEM IF YOU CROSS

68
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,132
ILLEGALLY.

69
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:08,235
BUT IT TURNS OUT I THINK

70
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,136
BEING TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION.

71
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,905
TODAY HE SAYS WE DON'T WANT OUR

72
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:13,674
COUNTRY TO TURN INTO A MIGRANT

73
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,544
CAMP OR A HOLDING PEN FOR

74
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:16,911
REFUGEES.

75
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:19,547
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE HER

76
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,348
SPOTS ABILITY FOR THE UNPOPULAR

77
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:22,783
PART OF THE POLICY WHICH IS THE

78
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,185
SEPARATION OF KIDS FROM THEIR

79
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:24,552
MOTHERS.

80
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:26,153
SO HE IS BLAMING THE DEMOCRATS.

81
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:29,256
>> IT'S BEEN TALKED OF A

82
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:29,990
DETERRENT IN PARTS BECAUSE OF

83
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,962
WHAT HAPPENED.

84
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,130
IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS COME

85
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,565
ON PEOPLE CROSS THE BORDER

86
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:38,966
ILLEGALLY AND CLAIMED AFTER THEY

87
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,534
WERE CAUGHT THEY WERE

88
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,235
ASYLUM-SEEKERS, THEY WOULD BE

89
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,670
LET GO AND ASKED TO REPORT BACK

90
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,571
AT A LATER DATE.

91
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,739
PEOPLE FIGURED OUT IT WAS A GOOD

92
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,941
WAY TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY.

93
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,876
HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH

94
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,244
IF YOU BROUGHT CHILDREN.

95
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,747
IT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

96
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:53,414
CHILDREN USED AS YOU WERE

97
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:53,948
CROSSING THE BORDER.

98
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,150
HE STARTED TO SEE THE NUMBER OF

99
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,052
CASES PEOPLE CROSSING THIS WAY

100
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,419
SKYROCKET.

101
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,253
THEY NEED TO MAKE A DETERRENT.

102
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:00,154
PEOPLE FIGURED OUT IT'S A GOOD

103
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,455
WAY TO CROSS.

104
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:05,359
THERE IS A MORAL COST CANNOT

105
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,393
FOLLOWING THE NATION'S LAWS AND

106
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:08,929
A MORAL COST TO SEPARATING

107
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:09,797
CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES.

108
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:11,365
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY COME

109
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,235
TOGETHER TO RESPECT THE LAWS OF

110
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,337
THE LAND AND KEEP FAMILIES

111
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:16,704
TOGETHER.

112
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:17,738
>> Bret: SECRETARY NIELSEN ON

113
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:18,572
THOSE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS GOING

114
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:18,973
OUT.

115
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,541
>> IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, WE

116
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,544
HAVE A THREE-HEADED 14% INCREASE

117
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:24,278
IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN ARRIVING

118
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:27,748
AT THE BORDER FRAUDULENTLY

119
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,351
CLAIMING TO BE A FAMILY UNIT.

120
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:33,988
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OF CONCERN.

121
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:34,922
SEPARATION CAN OCCUR WHEN THE

122
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,857
PARENT IS CHARGED WITH HUMAN

123
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:37,224
SMUGGLING.

124
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,793
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

125
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,961
WOULD DETAIN THE PARENT IN AN

126
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,996
APPROPRIATE SECURED DETENTION

127
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,364
FACILITY SEPARATE FROM THE

128
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:43,664
CHILD.

129
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:45,800
>> Bret: BOX, NO MATTER HOW

130
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,534
YOU EXCITING, THEY SAY THEY'RE

131
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:49,403
GOING TO SEEK ASYLUM,

132
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,471
THEY CHOOSE TO SEPARATE, WITH

133
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,606
THEIR PERCENTAGES THREE AND A 1%

134
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:53,340
THEIR PERCENTAGES THREE AND A 1,

135
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,041
THE IMAGES AND THE EMOTION

136
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,946
AROUND THE ISSUE ARE A POLITICAL

137
00:03:58,946 --> 00:03:59,313
DYNAMITE.

138
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,148
>> TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THIS HAS TO

139
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:01,582
BE HANDLED.

140
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:03,751
YOU CAN'T HAVE MOTHERS BEING

141
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:04,485
SEPARATED FROM INCREDIBLY YOUNG

142
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:04,852
CHILDREN.

143
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,187
I THINK THERE WILL BE A GOOD

144
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:07,755
FAITH EFFORT TO SOLVE THAT PART.

145
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:08,956
THERE'S A LEGACY OF LAWLESSNESS

146
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,559
HERE AND I THINK IT BECOMES TOO

147
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,426
APPARENT THAT NOT JUST THE OBAMA

148
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:15,529
ADMINISTRATION BUT THE CURRENT

149
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:16,797
DEMOCRAT PARTY WOULD PREFER A

150
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:17,464
SITUATION WHERE ESSENTIALLY

151
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,999
ANYBODY WHO CAN GET IN THE

152
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:19,666
COUNTRY CAN STAY.

153
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,668
AT SOME POINT, THEY HAVE TO BE

154
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:22,903
WILLING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION

155
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,038
WHICH ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE NO

156
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:26,974
LONGER ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE

157
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:27,575
COUNTRY?

158
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:28,609
THEY CREATED THIS LOOPHOLE, A

159
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,612
MASSIVE FRONT DOOR ENTRYWAY BY

160
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,347
BRINGING A CHILD WITH YOU, THAN

161
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,815
IT BECAME EASY TO STAY IN THE

162
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:35,149
COUNTRY.

163
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,151
YOU WANT TO FIX THE ISSUE OF

164
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,385
SEPARATING PARENTS AND CHILDREN

165
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:39,954
WHILE BEING PROCESSED.

166
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:41,488
BUT YOU ALSO DO HAVE TO ENFORCE

167
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:44,091
THE LAW BY PEOPLE COMING HERE

168
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:44,458
ILLEGALLY.

169
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,060
IN MANY CASES, CLAIMING ASYLUM

170
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,560
IN BAD FAITH.

171
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,596
THEY ARE SAYING WITH A BUNDLED

172
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:48,896
ESSAY.

173
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,397
THE WORD IS OUT.

174
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:51,866
SECRETARY NIELSEN HAS BEEN

175
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:52,967
ADDRESSING THAT.

176
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,735
YOUNG PEOPLE UNACCOMPANIED, THEY

177
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:56,270
ARE IN JEOPARDY.

178
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,071
MANY THOUSANDS OF ON THE COMPANY

179
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,806
OF MINORS ARE SO SHORT OF THE

180
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:00,074
BORDER WITH ANYBODY.

181
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:01,075
THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR THEM TOO.

182
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:04,511
THE INCENTIVE PUT IN PLACE BY

183
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:05,546
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS TO

184
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:05,846
STOP.

185
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,381
IT HAS TO END.

186
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:08,916
>> Bret: PROSPECTS OF FORCING

187
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,918
A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION, DOES IT

188
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:11,385
CHANGE?

189
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:14,188
LAST WEEK THE PROSPECT OF

190
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,556
IMMIGRATION LAW GETTING INTO

191
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:16,857
LAW, BILL GETTING INTO LAW, WAS

192
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:17,291
PRETTY SMALL.

193
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,692
>> IT LOOKED BAD.

194
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:19,727
THEY HAVE BEEN SO MANY ATTEMPTS

195
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:20,761
OVER THE PAST YEAR.

196
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,496
ONE WAS THE DEAL, WE WILL GIVE

197
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,864
YOU FULL FUNDING FOR THE WALL IF

198
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,934
YOU LEGALIZE THE DREAMERS.

199
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:27,735
NOW IT IS SOMETHING AKIN TO THAT

200
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,503
BUT ALSO WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING

201
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,571
ABOUT SEPARATING KIDS FROM THEIR

202
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:30,938
FAMILIES.

203
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:34,174
DONALD TRUMP IS ASKED FOR A 44%

204
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:35,542
DECREASE IN LEGAL IMMIGRATION

205
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:36,343
WHICH THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BALKED

206
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:36,610
AT.

207
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,178
I THINK IF YOU'VE GOT IT DOWN TO

208
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:42,683
A PRETTY SKINNY BILL, WALL,

209
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:43,317
DREAMERS, KIDS AND FAMILY

210
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,418
POLICIES, MAYBE YOU COULD GET

211
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:45,719
SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

212
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,355
THAT'S WHERE CONGRESS IS

213
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,123
HEADING.

214
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:50,758
>> Bret: THE DREADED "SKINNY

215
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:51,892
BILL."

216
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:52,626
>> SENATOR TED CRUZ INTRODUCED

217
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,361
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DEAL WITH

218
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:54,662
THIS.

219
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:56,230
THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT YOU CAN'T

220
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,798
DETAIN CHILDREN FOR MORE THAN 20

221
00:05:57,798 --> 00:05:58,132
DAYS.

222
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:00,367
IT TAKES LONG TO DEAL WITH

223
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,769
ADJUDICATING THE ILLEGAL BORDER

224
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:02,569
CROSSINGS THAT THEN CLAIM ASYLUM

225
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,371
THEN ENDS UP IN FAMILY

226
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:04,772
SEPARATION.

227
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:06,206
HIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU

228
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:07,574
ADJUDICATE THIS WITHIN TWO WEEKS

229
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,076
AND IF YOU FAIL TO PASS TEST,

230
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,978
YOU'RE DEPORTED AS OF FAMILY AND

231
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,413
OTHERWISE YOU CAN BE REUNITED AT

232
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:12,813
THAT POINT.

233
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:13,414
>> Bret: WE SHOULD SAY

234
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,849
SECRETARY NIELSEN MADE A POINT

235
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:22,189
TO SAVE YOU GO TO A PORT OF

236
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:28,696
ENTRY, THEN YOU CAN CLAIM ASYLUM

237
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:29,430
AND STAY TOGETHER AS A FAMILY IF

238
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,863
THERE'S ROOM.

239
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:30,564
>> AND IF THEY THINK YOU ARE A

240
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:30,965
REAL FAMILY.

241
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:31,665
>> Bret: HERE IS A BLAST FROM

242
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:32,232
THE PAST, IF YOU WILL.

243
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:32,933
HILLARY CLINTON ON THIS ISSUE.

244
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,134
>> THE PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPT TODAY

245
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,003
TO STOKE FEAR OF IMMIGRANTS NOT

246
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,372
ONLY AN HOUR COUNTRY BUT AROUND

247
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:40,074
THE WORLD BY CLAIMING THAT

248
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,076
MIGRANTS IN GERMANY ARE CAUSING

249
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:42,376
CRIME.

250
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:43,944
IN FACT, CRIME IN GERMANY IS AT

251
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:49,984
ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1992.

252
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:52,453
NOR ARE THESE POLICIES ROOTED IN

253
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:52,820
RELIGION.

254
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,958
IN FACT, THOSE WHO SELECTIVELY

255
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,729
USE THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY THIS

256
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,998
CRUELTY ARE IGNORING A CENTRAL

257
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:04,565
TENET OF CHRISTIANITY.

258
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:05,299
>> Bret: IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

259
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,603
ON THIS ISSUE, AS YOU CAN

260
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,138
IMAGINE, TOUCHING ALL ELEMENTS.

261
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,374
>> VERY DISHONEST IN TERMS OF

262
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:14,641
WHAT MRS. CLINTON IS PRESENTING

263
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:18,245
AS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN GERMANY.

264
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:24,251
SINCE 1982, WHAT HAS HAPPENED

265
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:24,718
DOESN'T MATTER.

266
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:25,386
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE

267
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:26,086
MASSIVE MIGRANT WAVE AND IT'S

268
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:27,187
CLEAR YOU HAD A 10% INCREASE IN

269
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:31,959
VIOLENT CRIME, HOMICIDE, RAPE,

270
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,161
THE CRIMES PEOPLE CARE ABOUT AND

271
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:34,962
NOTICE.

272
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,563
ONE SLOW START TO HIT THE

273
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:36,930
AIRWAVES.

274
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,399
THERE IS A HESITATION IN THE

275
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,967
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO SPEAK

276
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:40,701
OPENLY ABOUT THESE CRIMES.

277
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,569
WE SEE IT IN SWEDEN AND GERMANY.

278
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,971
THE PRESS DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL

279
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:44,304
WITH IT.

280
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:46,173
SHE'S WRONG ON THE FACTS.

281
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,008
RATHER, SHE IS MISCONSTRUING THE

282
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,144
REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING,

283
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,879
PICKING WHAT HAPPENED SINCE

284
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,746
1992.

285
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:53,514
THEY DO HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN

286
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,550
GERMANY WITH THE MIGRANT WAVE.

287
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,751
SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN OTHER PARTS

288
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:58,952
OF EUROPE AS WELL.

289
00:07:58,952 --> 00:07:59,953
MRS. CLINTON KNOWS THAT BUT

290
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,755
RIGHT NOW IT'S BETTER TO PLAY TO

291
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:02,189
THE EMOTIONS.

292
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,757
>> Bret: WHEN YOU HAVE

293
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:04,491
HILLARY CLINTON AND LAURA BUSH

294
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:08,162
ON THE SAME ISSUE, DOES IT

295
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,930
CREATE A BIGGER FORCE?

296
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,698
>> LAURA BUSH WAS AN EXTRA

297
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,333
ORDINARY ENTRY INTO THE DEBATE.

298
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,401
SHE DOESN'T EVER COMMENT ON

299
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,871
THINGS LIKE THIS, AND SHE DID.

300
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,075
THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE TWEET,

301
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:22,543
HE WENT AFTER ANGELA MERKEL.

302
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,344
SUGGESTING THAT HER HOLD ON

303
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:26,547
POWER WAS TEETERING ON THE BRINK

304
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,548
BECAUSE OF THIS.

305
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,951
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS ISSUING HIS

306
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,919
AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY,

307
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,686
ENCOURAGING CONSERVATIVE PARTIES

308
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:33,453
TO TAKE OVER.

309
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,856
THE KIND OF MEDDLING I DON'T

310
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,624
THINK YOU WOULD LIKE IF A

311
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,159
FOREIGN LEADER DID.

312
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,827
>> ANGELA MERKEL IS HAVING

313
00:08:39,827 --> 00:00:00,000
POLITICAL TROUBLE.
