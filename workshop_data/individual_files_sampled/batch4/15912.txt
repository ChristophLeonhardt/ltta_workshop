well first of all congratulations to you mr. Austin you certainly surprised those of us outside New Brunswick who hadn't been following you closely with in New Brunswick do you think you surprised people - I think maybe on a certain level we knew what we were hearing on the ground the coffee shops and the day-to-day you know talking to people type of deal we knew we had support there you know not only did we win three seats but we got almost 13% of the vote across the province and we came in second place in seven ridings so we're we're very you know very excited about what unfolded election night well I took the liberty of reading your platform and I could only find one campaign video online so I think I have a basic understanding of your party's platform but maybe you can say it in your own words where would you put yourself on the ideological spectrum what are the important issues to you what what was it that made three ridings vote for you in first place and come in second and seven more well I think some of the key issues deal with tax reform we're tired of our tax dollars going to big corporate handouts while small businesses here at home are struggling every day we're tired of politicians and in this status quo system which just seems to steamroll the wishes of the people on day to day policies in the province so you know it's it's it's we you know we talk about everything from you know eliminating corporate handouts proper tax reform you know where the New Brunswick is is you know completely archaic tax system where you know businesses are struggling people can't make ends meet you look at a city like Saint John which in in just recent history had the highest child poverty rate in the country yet also has the largest oil refinery in the country so we're thinking you know are they paying the fair share of taxes and the taxes that they are paying are they going into the city or are they going you know to the profit to be spent frivolously on some of these ridiculous projects so all kinds of ideas language fairness we said you know we respect the rights of both linguistic communities here in New Brunswick being the only bilingual problems in Canada but my goodness the way it's implemented is just completely completely out of out of control well that last one caught my eye when I saw your it mentioned in your campaign video in in many parts of Canada that would be deemed off-limits at taboo subject to criticize you were not afraid to challenge official bilingualism or at least the way it's implemented in New Brunswick how were you received by the media and by the pundits and by polite company were you allowed to have a healthy debate about an issue that's regarded as a sacred cow I wouldn't quite put it that way but I think when you when you look at the issue at large you know we've always taken the approach that you know we're not going to you know when it comes to these hot-button items or these taboo topics we refuse to take to politically you know correct sanitized approach to these issues we've always said we'll hit them head on and we'll have respectful meaningful debate around them we want all people included on those debates but see the governments of the past have had secret meetings around the official languages act and you know making amendments to that act and it was all done behind closed doors with a public consultation so you know a lot of groups organizations even average Joe and public wasn't included in that so it's really affecting people's lives here in New Brunswick I mean you get people that maybe are not bilingual that can't get government jobs you got people that have government jobs like can't get seniority you can't get advancement because of language it's a big issue here in New Brunswick and paramedics is a great example as well we have paramedics sometimes that aren't showing up for 40 45 minutes after the 911 walk 1 911 call comes in because again language requirements for paramedics are so so high that we can't find enough bilingual paramedics to fill them so a lot of them go on staff that it's it's a real issue I've heard that you just saying that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra Levant show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
