Academy award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o has slammed UK magazine Grazia UK for photoshopping her natural hair off its cover she tweeted the following photo where you can see how the photo was retouched just saying disappointed that at Grazia UK edited out and smooth my hair to fit a more Eurocentric notion of what beautiful hair looks like hashtag DT MH which means don't touch my hair as we learn from Solange Knowles album she also wrote a longer post on Instagram which in part reads that there is still a very long way to go to combat the unconscious prejudice against black woman's complexion hair style and texture obviously the internet was abuzz some of the reactions that I really liked just supporting what PETA mianga was shame on you across the UK your Eurocentric idea of beauty is not I repeat not the standard don't ever edit our natural god-given hair out in case y'all don't know we are beautiful just as we are hashtag don't touch my hair another person on Twitter said I need these magazines to stop cropping our crowns first to launch and Evening Standard now Lupita in Grazia hashtag DTM H so I've covered the story before when the Evening Standard Photoshop Solange's hair out of the frame were you with me yeah I remember that and it's baffling to me it's baffling that it happened again Simone what is your response to this yeah it's just kind of crazy that Grazia thinks that they can do this and not get called out for it I mean I guess caught yeah exactly I mean Lupita has several social media channels ro she can post the unedited image alongside the edited photo so it just seems kind of silly number one that we are even still uncomfortable with black women's hair in its natural state as a society like why it's it's how we are born and it's a beautiful thing and why do we need to keep criticizing that but number two it's just it's it's silly to me that you think you can get away with this so a couple questions about this I I thought that these stars had kind of editorial check before the print when I'm really surprised that they don't get to check their own you know their pictures before that they it gets printed me if it was me I want to check to see how fat I looked okay give it a real that's a so I'm surprised they're like yeah whatever you already took the picture I don't care we're just gonna doctor it and put it up so that probably is problem number one but number two is a question for you guys you know everybody keeps saying and she's saying you're eccentric but I is that the Gracia cover-more Eurocentric I mean it's it's just kind of almost near balled I don't think that's necessarily you're eccentric it does like maybe they thought that the cropping out the hair made her look better I don't know why they thought that but I'm not sure that it's Eurocentric am I wrong I could be longer she okay so she did call this Eurocentric but I think probably what she was trying to do is just to refer to an overall perspective in society that Eurocentric beauty standards are more pleasing so maybe that's what she was trying to do yeah so look I think the Eurocentric thing is absolutely real standards of beauty and the thing that really turns my stomach in some of the countries is when they have a white the like the creams that make your skin skin bleaching to make it look whiter yeah and and you know there's an interesting backlash to that when some cultures are saying if we want to make ourselves white or it's not on you and the West that tell us not to do it well and I was kind of blown away and I was like oh okay I'm not sure I agree but it's an interesting concept here you know they just should have better communication and and they probably should have watched our coverage when they did it to Solange Knowles on the Evening Standard which made it abundantly clear that you just don't touch a black woman's hair and that also extends itself to photoshopping I don't know why we made that really clear right we did should watch that background God see you UK if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network comm /join
