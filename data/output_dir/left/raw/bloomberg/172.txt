ALL OF THAT COMING UP.

21
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,564
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS THAT GOES

22
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:40,466
WAY BEYOND THE FEDERAL RESERVE

23
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,535
BECAUSE OVERNIGHT, THE SWISS

WINGS.

28
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,882
MICHAEL: MY FIRST THOUGHT IS IT

29
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,417
IS NOT ABOUT THAT WHAT BECAUSE

30
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,151
WE KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO IS

31
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,285
BASICALLY NOTHING.

32
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,153
IT IS ABOUT THE WHY, HOW DO THEY

33
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,121
EXPLAIN IT.

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,954
DO THEY SAY THAT THEY DO THEY

35
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:04,957
HAVE SEEN, AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME

36
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,527
DISAPPOINTING DATA LATELY, MEAN

37
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,860
THE ECONOMY IS GOING INTO A

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,998
SLOWDOWN, OR IS IT A BLIP?

39
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:12,799
HOW THEY EXPLAIN THAT AND GOING

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,499
FORWARD ON MATTER A LOT.

41
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,602
TOM: MINE IS SIMPLY THE WORLD

42
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,304
WILL BE WATCHING.

43
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,205
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

44
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:23,409
NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT EVERYBODY

45
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,143
WILL BE WATCHING AROUND THE

46
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:24,510
WORLD.

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,278
SHE IS CENTRAL BANKER TO THE

WORLD.

49
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,115
MICHAEL: SHE IS CENTRAL BANKER

50
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,184
AND A MAN WHO WAS IN COMPETITION

51
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,018
TO HER TO BE THE CENTRAL BANK OF

52
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,886
THE WORLD, LARRY SUMMERS,

53
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:37,023
PUBLISHED A NEW ARTICLE CALLING

54
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:37,790
ON THE FED TO KEEP RATES THE

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,926
SAME AND TO RAISE THEIR

56
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,196
INFLATION TARGET.

57
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:43,996
HE SAYS THAT THAT IS MAKING THE

58
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,465
SAME MISTAKE THEY MAKE OVER AND

59
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,599
OVER AGAIN.

60
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,467
HE SAYS IF YOU ARE RAISING RATES

61
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:54,307
TO HELP THE ECONOMY --

62
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,349
TOM: YES.

63
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,720
MY COMMENT, IT IS SO IMPORTANT

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,521
THAT LARRY SUMMERS IS ON THE

65
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:15,161
SAME PAGE WITH ZETNER

66
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,729
SAYING WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE

67
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,530
GROWTH, WHICH IS WHAT WE HEAR.

68
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,768
SCARLET: RAISING INFLATION

69
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,769
EXPECTATION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT

70
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:23,636
ENOUGH WITH COMMODITY PRICES

71
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,173
TAKING.

72
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,040
RAISING INFLATION IS A CHALLENGE

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,908
NONE OF THE CENTRAL BANKS CAN'T

74
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,475
SEEM TO GET RIGHT.

75
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,745
MICHAEL: A HIGHER INFLATION

76
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,546
TARGET GETS SET, THAT WILL PULL

77
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,648
INFLATION UP BECAUSE IT RAISES

78
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,315
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.

79
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,618
TOM: LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS.

80
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,822
MAYBE NOT ALL THAT MUCH WITHIN

81
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,923
THE STATEMENT, BUT THE PRESS

82
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:44,724
CONFERENCE YOU MAY SEE MARKETS

83
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,460
MOVE THE TWO YEAR YIELD AT A .69

84
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,695
AND THEN UP WE WENT, DOWN WE

85
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:50,763
WENT.

86
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,465
A HIGHER YIELD IN THE LAST TWO

87
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,700
HOURS.

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,937
OIL HAS BEEN SOGGY.

89
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,704
I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT

90
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,706
IS RELATED.

91
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,176
ON TO THE NEXT SCREEN.

92
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:03,943
THIS IS A SCREEN THAT IS A

93
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,944
LITTLE MORE MALLEABLE.

94
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,745
THIS IS STUFF THAT WILL.

95
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:11,718
THE DOLLAR INDEX.

96
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,954
THE EURO, 94.7.

97
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,024
THIS IS THE BENCHMARK.

98
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:18,891
THE ONE I WOULD REALLY WATCH

99
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:23,830
WITHIN THE NEW WANTS HIS --

100
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,732
NUANCES IS THE SPREAD.

101
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:32,171
87 IS NOT A RECESSION INDICATOR,

102
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:32,872
BUT THE VECTOR IS IN THAT

103
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,306
DIRECTION.

104
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,073
SCARLET: I WILL KEEP MY EYE ON

105
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,143
THE DOLLAR YEN.

106
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,046
JAPAN IS WAITING IN THE WINGS

107
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:40,713
READY TO DO SOMETHING IF

108
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,180
NECESSARY.

109
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,249
TOM: WHAT DO WE SEE FROM CHINA

110
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:43,716
OVERNIGHT?

111
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,320
MICHAEL: NOTHING.

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,221
THEY ARE DATA DEPENDENT ON THEIR

113
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,189
OWN DATA AND NOT AS DEPENDENT ON

114
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,090
THE FED.

115
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,194
THEY HAVE MOVED IN ANTICIPATION

116
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:55,995
OF THE FED, BUT IF THEY WILL BE

117
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,729
ON HOLD, THERE IS NO NEED.

118
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:01,100
TOM: IS THERE AN EMERGING MARKET

119
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,901
PROXY, THE DOLLAR AND MEXICO HAS

120
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,737
REALLY WEAKENED NEAR RECORD

121
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,605
WEAKNESS.I AM NOT SURE WHAT THAT

122
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:05,972
MEANS

123
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,407
.

00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,408

WORLDWIDE OF THIS FED MEETING.

200
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,668
WE HAVEN'T ESTEEMED SET OF

201
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,535
GUESTS FOR CONVERSATION AS WE GO

202
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,570

THEN WE MOVE ON FROM THERE.

208
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,748
HOW DO WE GET STARTED?

209
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,582
LET'S GET STARTED WITH SOMEONE

210
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,350
WHO MAY BE MARKET CALL OF THE

211
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,984
YEAR AMONG MAJOR HOUSES.

212
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,252
IT IS THE MAJOR AT HSBC.

213
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,156
HOW ABOUT ALLEN'S IN YOUR --

214
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,260
ELLEN ZENTNER.

215
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,364
SHE HAS BEEN ALMOST PERFECT.

216
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,098
FABULOUS IN SAYING THIS IS A

217
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:19,765
THREAD THAT WILL WAIT

218
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,534
.

219
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,401
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CALL AND

220
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,504
LET ME SAY WHEN WILL WE SEE THE

221
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,272
RATE INCREASE THAT YOU SAID WE

222
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:26,772
WILL WAIT FOR?

223
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,207
DO WE SEE THIS YEAR?

224
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:32,311
ELLEN: WE ARE STILL STICKING TO

225
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,212
A CALL THAT THE FED DOES GET A

226
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,816
RATE HIKE IN THIS YEAR.

227
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:41,352
IN AN EERY REPEAT OF LAST YEAR,

228
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:42,087
THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THAT IN

229
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,091
DECEMBER.

230
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:45,925
THESE ARE MONETARY POLICYMAKERS

231
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,759
NOT READY TO THROW IN THE TOWEL

232
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,059
YET.

233
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,361
TODAY IN THE STATEMENT AND THE

234
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,364
ACCOMPANYING DOT PLOT, THEY ARE

235
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:53,099
DETERMINED TO GET RIGHT HEIGHT

236
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:58,471
IN THIS -- RATE HIKES IN THIS

237
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,572
YEAR.

238
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,207
WE DON'T THINK THEY CAN, BUT

239
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,143
THEY WANT TO.

240
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:04,844
THERE IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE

241
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,611
OPTIMISM IN THE SECOND HALF OF

242
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,980
THE YEAR IF YOU ARE A POLICY

243
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,814
MAKER, AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

244
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,283
HOLD ON TO THE HOPE THAT GROWTH

245
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,051
CONTINUES IN THE SECOND HALF.

246
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,686
TOM: HERE IS A QUOTE THAT I

247
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,655
LIKE.

248
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,723
LET'S BRING UP THE QUOTE IF YOU

249
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,892
WOULD.

250
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,661
THE BASIC IDEA IS THE LONGER RUN

251
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,429
DYNAMICS, YOU THINK OF

252
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,497
SHORT-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM, AND

253
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,765
LONGER RUN.

254
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,001
THE DISPERSION OF THE DOTS WILL

255
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,769
SHIFT SOMEWHAT MORE DOVISH.

256
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,506
WE EXPECT NEW ASSESSMENTS IN

257
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,841
SWEEPING CHANGES TO POTENTIAL

258
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,611
GROWTH THE LONGER RUN AND DOWN

259
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,845
EQUILIBRIA RATES.

260
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,449
THE WORD SWEEPING

261
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:43,916
CATCHES ME.

262
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:48,220
MICHAEL: THERE HAS BEEN A BIG

263
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,088
CHANGE IN THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT

264
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,324
HOW FAST ECONOMY CAN GROW.

265
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,158
RIGHT NOW, JANET YELLEN HAS SAID

266
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,960
SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE

267
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,694
CAN GROW FASTER BECAUSE IT

268
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:57,296
REVOLVES AROUND PRODUCTIVITY AND

269
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,097
THE FACT THAT PRODUCTIVITY HAS

270
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,666
GONE AWAY.

271
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,467
WE KNOW THE LABOR MARKET IS

272
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,234
SHRIEKING BINDS UNTIL YOU GET

273
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:02,968
SOME INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY,

274
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,638
HOW DO YOU GET A HIGHER NUMBER?

275
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:10,409
ELLEN: EXACTLY.

276
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,210
IT IS PRODUCTIVITY THAT THEY

277
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,212
OFTEN WANT TO WHAT THEY TALK

278
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:13,946
ABOUT WE DON'T KNOW IF

279
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,214
EQUILIBRIUM BREAKS WILL PICK UP.

280
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,051
THESE PERSISTENT HEADWINDS WERE

281
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,852
EXPECTED TO FADE AND THEY HAVE

282
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,554
NOT.

283
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,354
IF YOU ARE A POLICY MAKER, YOU

284
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,990
HAVE TO START QUESTIONING YOUR

285
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,391
ENDGAME.

286
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,260
THE POINT YOU CAN RAISE RATES TO

287
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,994
AND HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET

288
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:29,328
THERE.

289
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,063
WE HAVE SEEN IN A POLICYMAKERS

290
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,132
GIVE THESE REMARKS PUBLICLY THAT

291
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,834
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT TO SHOW UP

292
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,302
IN THOSE DOTS IN THE OUT YEARS.

293
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,339
WHILE WE DON'T THINK THE STORY

294
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,207
OF TODAY'S STATEMENT WILL BE

295
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,276
THE. COMING DOWN FOR 2016, WE

296
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,010
THINK THE STORY WILL BE WHAT

297
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,679
THEY DO IN THE OUT YEARS

298
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,413
PROVIDING A SOMEWHAT MORE

299
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,348
REALISTIC PATH ALTHOUGH IT WAS

300
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,283
STILL NOT BE SEEN BY THE MARKETS

301
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,084
AS REALISTIC.

302
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,420
MICHAEL: I GUESS TO SUPPORT HR,

303
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,189
THE QUESTION WILL BE, WIRE WE

304
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,557
SEEING THE DECLINE THAT WE HAVE

305
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,193
IN LABOR MARKETS AND THE

306
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,430
INFLATION EXPECTATION?

307
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,132
AS YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART

308
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:07,933
OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE LAST

309
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,601
COUPLE OF MONTHS, A DATA

310
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,035
DEPENDENT AT HAS NO PARTICULAR

311
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:12,638
-- FED HAS HAD NO PARTICULAR

312
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,573
REASON TO RAISE RATES AT THIS

313
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:14,940
POINT.

314
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,576
ELLEN: I WOULD AGREE.

315
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,680
JOBS GROWTH HAS SLOWED.

316
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,918
THERE IS A BIG QUESTION MARK

317
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,719
AROUND THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT AND

318
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,486
WE NEED MORE DATA POINTS TO BE

319
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,988
SURE THAT THIS IS NOT JUST JOB

320
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,391
GROWTH MOVING INTO A SLOWER

321
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,225
PANEL, WITH WOULD BE TYPICAL IN

322
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,026
THE LATE CYCLE, LATE PHASE OF

323
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,762
THE BUSINESS CYCLE, OR IS IT THE

324
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,563
BEGINNING OF A PRECIPITOUS DROP

325
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,864
THAT WE SEE LEADING UP TO

326
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,765
RECESSIONS?

327
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,534
ANYTIME THERE IS A QUESTION MARK

328
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,370
AROUND THE DATA, THE FED SITS ON

329
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,838
HIS HANDS.IT NEEDS MORE DATA

330
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,340
POINTS

331
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,674
.

332
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,541
THIS IS WHY WE DON'T THINK IT

333
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,077
MOVES ON RATES THIS SUMMER.

334
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:51,911
THE PROBABILITY OF A JULY RATE

335
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,513
HIKE IS EXTREMELY LOW.

336
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,548
I WOULD NEVER SAY ZERO.

337
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,584
THEY HAVE SURPRISED AS BEFORE.

338
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,486
I WOULD PUT IT EXTREMELY LOW.

339
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,988
WHY IS JOB GROWTH SLOWING?

340
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:03,756
JANET YELLEN IS WORRIED ABOUT

341
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,257
PROFITS.

342
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:05,991
WE HAVE COME THROUGH FIVE

343
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,759
STRAIGHT QUARTERS OF COMPANIES

344
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,893
REPORTING DECLINING EARNINGS.

345
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,729
THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE.

346
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,597
IF YOU ARE BLEEDING MONEY, YOU

347
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,999
DON'T HIRE MORE.

348
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,801
THAT IS WHY WE THINK WE ARE

349
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,870
SEEING THE SLOWDOWN IN JOBS, BUT

350
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,604
HOW BIG OF A SLOWDOWN IS THE

351
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,672
QUESTION, AND WE NEED MORE DATA.

352
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,710
SCARLET: ARE WE AT FULL

353
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,210
EMPLOYMENT?

354
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,011
IF SO, DOES THE FED ACKNOWLEDGED

355
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,847
THAT ORTON SAID THAT -- OR HINT

356
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:29,281
AT THAT?

357
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,418
ELLEN: IT IS A GREAT QUESTION

358
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,185
BECAUSE MANY POLICYMAKERS ARE

359
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,821
SHOWING US THEY THINK WE ARE AT

360
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,889
THE EMPLOYMENT, BUT IF THAT IS

361
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,823
SO, WHY ARE WE NOT SEEING BIGGER

362
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,858
ACCELERATION IN WHICH GROWTH

363
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:40,726
THAT YOU WERE EXPECTING TO

364
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,162
SEE.INSET

365
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:47,499
JANET YELLEN HAS SAID PERHAPS

366
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,300
THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT

367
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,101
IS LOWER THAN WHERE WE THINK IT

368
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:49,401
IS.

369
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,303
IN FACT, IF I THINK BACK 10, 15

370
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,139
YEARS AGO SITTING AT A VENUE

371
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,444
WHERE SHE GAVE A SPEECH, SHE

372
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,244
SAID I BUY INTO THE IDEA OF THIS

373
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,180
NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT,

374
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,081
BUT I ALSO ADMIT THAT WE DON'T

375
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:02,648
KNOW WHERE IT IS.

376
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,283

EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MEASURES TO

THE FED'S DECISION TODAY, THE

DOT CHART.

407
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,525
WE WANT TO GO OVER WHAT THAT

408
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,293
ACTUALLY IS AND WHY IT IS SO

409
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,962
IMPORTANT.

410
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:38,730
THE FED A COUPLE YEARS AGO

411
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,134
STARTED PUTTING OUT WITH ITS

412
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:42,968
FORECAST THE LEVEL OF THE FUNDS

413
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:43,769

OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE THOUGHT

415
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,270
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE

ECONOMIC FORECAST.

417
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,473
FORTUNATELY, WALL STREET HAS

418
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,542
TAKEN THAT AS A PREDICTION.

419
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,610
IT IS THE LAW OF UNINTENDED

420
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,345
CONSEQUENCES SO YOU END UP WITH

421
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,281
IS DOTS THAT REPRESENTS WHAT

422
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,450
THE FED IT SHOULD BE TWO OF THE

423
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,688
MARKET THINKS.

424
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,422
TO THE TERMINAL RATE, THE

425
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,323
HIGHEST THE WILL GO IS MUCH

426
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,425
STEEPER THAN WHAT THE MARKET

427
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,459
THINKS.

428
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,127
THEY ARE STILL EXPECTING TWO

429
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,597
RATE INCREASES.

430
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,098
THIS IS PRICED IN FOR THE END OF

431
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,868
2016.

432
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:17,703
THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET THINKS

433
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,403
IS GOING TO HAPPEN, WHICH

434
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,740
BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT.

435
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,608
THE FED THINKS THEY WILL GET

436
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,010
3.5%.

437
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,877
THE MARKET THINKS HE WILL GET 75

438
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:26,545
BASIS POINTS.

439
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,549
FOR JANET YELLEN TODAY

440
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,350
INTRODUCED CONFERENCE, IT IS

441
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,084
GOING TO BE ABOUT THIS GAP.

442
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,388
EXPLAIN THIS.

443
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
WHITE AS THE EVENTS STILL MORE

444
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,023
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHERE INTEREST

445
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:38,757
RATES WILL GO THAN THE MARKET

446
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,057
IS.

447
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,693
SCARLET: YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THAT

448
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,761
ON BLOOMBERG.

449
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,664
STILL WITH US IS ELLEN ZENTNER.

450
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:50,002
MIKE DID A FANTASTIC JOB GIVING

451
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:50,836
US THE OUTLOOK FOR THE DOT CHART

452
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,704
.

453
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,540
THE DOT PLOT HAS COME UNDER A

454
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,912
LOT OF CRITICISM.

455
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,580
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE DOTS TO

456
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,848
YOU?

457
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,884
ELLEN: I THINK IT WAS VERY

458
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,953
VALUABLE WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED

459
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:12,891
BECAUSE IT CONVINCED MARKETS OR

460
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,692
PUT THE MONEY WHERE THE AMOUNT

461
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,793
IS OF THE FED, SAYING WE WILL

462
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,129
NOT RAISE RATES FOR A LONG TIME.

463
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,432
IT WAS VERY NECESSARY AT THAT

464
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:20,866
TIME.

465
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,633
THE UNFORTUNATE THING FOR THE

466
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,401
FED IS THE WAY THIS WORKS AS A

467
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,170
BODY IS WHAT SOMETHING IS

468
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,004
INTRODUCED, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT

469
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:26,538
TO TAKE IT AWAY.

470
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,007
ONCE THEY STARTED ON THE PATH OF

471
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,943
HIKING RATES, IT BECOMES NEARLY

472
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:34,179
USELESS.

473
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,981
MANY POLICYMAKERS HAVE ADMITTED

474
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:40,319
THAT, NOT JUST JAMES BULLARD.

475
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,119
NEVERTHELESS, IT IS HERE, SO

476
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,222
WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT?

477
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:44,956
THE FED CAN NOW USE IT AS A

478
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:45,657
COMMUNICATION COOL AROUND

479
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,591
ANCHORING THE LONG END OR

480
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,094
EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE EVENTUAL

481
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,130
PATH OF POLICY.

482
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,800
WE THINK THAT IS WHERE WE CAN BE

483
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,268
MOST EFFICACIOUS IN TODAY'S

484
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,671
MEETING BY BRINGING THE DOTS

485
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:04,510
DOWN IN 2017 AND 2018.

486
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,310
THAT IS WHERE THEY CAN BRIDGE

487
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,178
THE GAP.

488
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:10,315
MIKE MENTIONED THE EXPECTATIONS

489
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,950
CAP THAT THE MARKET IS PRICING

490
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,422
ONE RATE HIKE IN EVERY YEAR FOR

491
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,190
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, WHICH IS

492
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,957
UNREALISTIC, BUT THE FED SHOWING

493
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:27,499
THEY WILL HIKE UNREALISTICALLY.

494
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,168
THEY CAN CLOSE THAT GAP SO THE

495
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,538
FED CAN SEE MORE I TO I WITH THE

496
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,505
MARKET.

497
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,042
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DOT PLOT IS

498
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,845
HERE TO STAY.

499
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,712
JANET YELLEN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

500
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,179
WITH A Q&A.

501
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,483
MICHAEL: IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR YOU

502
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,684
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRADING, THE

503
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,518
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BRING

504
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,554
THE TERMINAL RATE DOWN, THE ONE

505
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,355
THAT IS ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT

506
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,057
HAND SIDE OF THE DOT PLOT

507
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,093
BECAUSE THAT WOULD SUGGEST HOW

508
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,728
FAST THEY WILL MOVE RATES UP,

509
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,562
WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW

510
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:58,697
MANY TIMES IT TAKES THEM TO GET

511
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,131
THERE.

512
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:04,002
ELLEN: EXACTLY.

513
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:04,836
THE FED WOULD BE PROVIDING THAT

514
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,737
ALL THE BRANCH TO THE MARKET,

515
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,706
SAYING WE ARE NOT TONE DEAF.

516
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,409
WE ARE NOT GOING TO MOSE THROUGH

517
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,644
THE RIGHT HEIGHT UNTIL WE GET TO

518
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,814
THE END GAME -- HIKES UNTIL WE

519
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,750
GET TO THE END GAME.

520
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,652
THERE IS A LOT MORE ROOM FOR THE

521
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:21,687
FED TO DO THEIR.

522
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:26,058
-- THERE.

523
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,892
I THINK PEOPLE WILL STILL WATCH

524
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:31,496
THE PATH FOR THIS YEAR.

525
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,230
I WANT TO SAY IT WILL BE

526
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,998
UNEXCITING BECAUSE THE MEDIAN

527
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,333
WILL STAY AT TWO RATE HIKES, BUT

528
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,804
WE GOT THE ONE RATE HIKE.

529
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,739
WHO JOINS HER?

530
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,975
I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME

531
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:47,446
INTERESTING DISCUSSION THERE

532
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,380
EVEN IF THE MEDIAN STAYS AT 2

533
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,414
FOR THIS YEAR.

534
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,384
TOM: I THINK YOU ARE DOT PLOTS

535
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:58,589
ARE LIKE SMOKE SIGNALS.

536
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,424
ONE-PERSON PUBLISHING SAYS THEY

537
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,262
ARE NUTS TO RAISE.

538
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,129
BUSINESS LOAN DELINQUENCIES ARE

539
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:04,997
ON THE UPSWING.

540
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,765
LET ME COMBINED THAT WITH

541
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,567
SOMETHING YOU KNOW QUITE WELL

542
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,968
OVER IN A BLOOMBERG TERMINAL.

543
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:15,307
WITH RECESSES SHOWING CAPACITY

544
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,107
TO UTILIZATION IS ROLLING OVER

545
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:19,411
WAY OFF THE 45TH YEAR TREND.

546
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,212
FOR THOSE ON BLOOMBERG RADIO,

547
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,747
ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW IS CAPU IS

548
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:29,354
THE PULSE OF MANUFACTURING.

549
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,155
ELLEN, IT IS ROLLING

550
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:30,989
OVER.

551
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:36,762
ELLEN: GUESS WHAT TOM.

552
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,562
EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE WERE

553
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,363
POINTING TO THE FACT THAT A LOT

554
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,465
OF THIS WEEK HIS IN THE

555
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,266
MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS LED BY

556
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:41,666
ENERGY.

557
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:42,234
GUESS WHAT.

558
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,137
IT TURNS OUT YOU CANNOT HAVE A

559
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,341
20% RISE IN YOUR DOLLAR AND

560
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:49,808
ESCAPE THAT.

561
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
HERE IT IS SHOWING THAT IN THE

562
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,513
DATA.

563
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,347
EVEN IF WE SET ASIDE THE EFFECT

00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:26,164
I WILL LOOK AT THAT TODAY.

753
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:26,964
>> WE COULD SEE A PROBLEM WITH

754
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,368
EQUITY MARKETS.

755
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,937
THE FED WILL WATCH THE FEEDBACK

756
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,440
INTO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY.

757
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,775
EVEN WITH THE GROUP GAINING

758
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:39,543
GROUND, WE ARE NOT SEEING THIS

759
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,579
IN THE UNITED STATES.

760
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,715
>> AGAIN, I THINK IT IS A

761
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,650
REPRICING.

762
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:52,089
IF WE DO GET TO A CONCERN, OTHER

763
00:34:52,089 --> 00:35:01,565
COUNTRIES IN THE UNION,

764
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:02,300
CERTAINLY WE DO SEE CREDIT

765
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,834
SPREADS AND THE U.S. HAS WIDENED

766
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:04,168
OUT.

767
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:04,935
THERE IS AN IMPACT OUT BEYOND

768
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:08,906
WHAT YOU SEE ON THE DOLLAR.

769
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:13,010
SCARLET: IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE

770
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,145
ARE SEEING IN THE U.K. WITH THE

771
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,480
POUND ALL OVER THE PLACE AND A

772
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,649
SLOWDOWN THERE, DOES THE FED PUT

773
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,483
MORE WEIGHT ON WHAT IS GOING ON

774
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:24,254
IN CHINA WITH THE U.K.?

775
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:26,090
>> THEY CAN WRAP IT UP IN A

776
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,791
GENERAL FASHION AND SAY

777
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,458
INTERNATIONAL AND ECONOMIC

778
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,259
DEVELOPMENT ABROAD THAT AFFECT

779
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,494
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE U.S.

780
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:31,896
ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING, SIMILAR

781
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:38,336
TO WATCHING WHAT ENCOMPASSES

782
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,370
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE LABOR

783
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:39,804
MARKET.

784
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,038
THERE ARE EVILS IN THE WORLD

785
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:41,806
THAT LURK BEHIND EVERY CORNER.

786
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:47,011
IT WILL BE CHINA TODAY AND SIX

787
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:52,350
MONTHS FROM NOW AND THEN YOU

788
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,351
WILL HAVE BIG EVENTS THAT ARE

789
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,119
MORE IMMEDIATE LIKE GREXIT.

790
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,124
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ENCOMPASSES

791
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:05,062
ALL OF IT.

792
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:05,996
WHAT I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE --

793
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,131
UNFORTUNATE IS THE TIMING OF

794
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:10,801
GREXIT, IT ALSO TAKES AWAY SOME

795
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,635
OF THE IMPACT WE WOULD GET FROM

796
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:12,570
JENNA -- JANET YELLEN'S'S

797
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,304
TESTIMONY.

798
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:20,578
TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF A GOOD

799
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,045
TESTIMONY.

800
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:21,746
WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN REALLY

801
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,480
NUGGETS FROM THAT EXCEPT THERE

802
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:32,923
IS A LOOMING GUERRILLA TWO LATER

803
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:33,257
--

804
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,058
>> TIME AND TIME AND TIME AND

805
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,328
TIME AGAIN, WE CANNOT GET IT

806
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,830
GOING.

807
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,499
WE ROLL OVER BECAUSE OF WEAK

808
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:48,705
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

809
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:54,178
WE ARE WAITING.

810
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,647
ALLEN, WHEN DO WE DO IT?

811
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,883
>> YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE HORSE'S

812
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,619
MOUTH.

813
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,822
IF I WANT GREAT IF I SCUM I CAN

814
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:05,389
CALL DIRECTLY.

815
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,090
I WAITED TO SEE ON BLOOMBERG

816
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,491
INSTEAD.

817
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,527
ONE OF THE THINGS IN THIS SHOW

818
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,763
AS WELL IS THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK

819
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,699
LOOP.

820
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:22,106
THE FED TIGHT -- GOES, NEGATIVE

821
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,009
FEEDBACK, SO THEY HAVE TO PAUSE

822
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:29,446
OR TAKE CARE.

823
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,314
GROWTH HAS BEEN VERY STRONG AND

824
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,115
WE DO NOT HAVE THAT SAME KIND OF

825
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,817
ACT DROP TODAY.

826
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:39,023
TOM: WOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN

827
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:39,723
WHEN WE GET BACK TO THESE

828
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,792
ECONOMICS?

829
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,429
>> I THINK THE FED HAS EMBRACED

830
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,197
THE NOTION WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

831
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,133
FOR A FEW YEARS.

832
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,268
THE REASON FOR A GRADUAL RATE

833
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,135
HIKE CYCLE IS THE POLICY RATE IS

834
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,404
LOW AND RISING GRADUALLY OVER

835
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,973
TIME.

836
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,375
YOU TALK ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET,

837
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,176
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS RUNNING

838
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,244
AT 3%. WE ARE APPROACHING FULL

839
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,113
EMPLOYMENT.

840
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,049
WE SEE SOME KICKOFF.

841
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,251
I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO

842
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,018
DISMISSIVE OF THE BASIC HOLDING

843
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:12,723
BLOCKS.

844
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,125
THE KEY INSIGHT IS THERE IS A

845
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:15,893
NEW NEUTRAL AND THEY NEED A

846
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,660
GRADUAL LIFT OFF TO A LOW DEATH

847
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,461
AND NATION HERE THAT IS WHY I AM

848
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:24,434
LOOK AT LONGER TODAY.

849
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:30,407
SCARLET: WE DO HAVE ANOTHER

850
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:31,208
CHART AND YOU WILL PULL THAT UP

851
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:36,646
FOR US AS WELL.

852
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:37,414
>> IT IS WHAT RICH WAS JUST

853
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:38,549
TALKING ABOUT, THE IDEA THAT

854
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,383
INFLATION EXPECTATION HAS GONE

855
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,419
DOWN.

856
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,755
WE CAN PUT THIS OUT ON BLOOMBERG

857
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,322
RADIO AS WELL.

858
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:45,990
THE BLUE LINE IS CONSUMER

859
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,027
EXPECTATIONS ARE AT A RECORD LOW

860
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:50,828
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

861
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,896
SURVEY FOR INFLATION.

862
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,031
THE MARKETS HAVE BEEN

863
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:54,832
PESSIMISTIC FOR INFLATION FOR

864
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,002
YEARS.

865
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:06,977
THE ECONOMY IS MUDDLING ALONG.

866
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:07,711
WE ARE NOT SEEING MAJOR

867
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:15,585
DISINFLATION ANYMORE.

868
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:16,453
>> THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A

869
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:17,254
NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT TENDS TO

870
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,057
INVOLVE -- EVOLVE SLOWLY.

871
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,494
SHE MENTIONED IN PHILADELPHIA,

872
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,030
IF I WERE FED CHAIR, I WOULD PAY

873
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,733
ATTENTION TO IT AS WELL.

874
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,135
SURVEY MEASURES GET OVERLY

875
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:31,936
INFLUENCED BY ENERGY OR GASOLINE

876
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,803
PRICES.

877
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:37,007
THERE DOES NEED TO BE.

878
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,044
UNDERLYING INFLATION IN THE

879
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,811
ECONOMY, THE FED TARGET IS

880
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,813
MOVING UP.

881
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,581
WE NEED TO KNOWLEDGE THAT IS

882
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:43,914
WELL.

883
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:48,819
SCARLET: AS WE WRAP UP

884
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:54,692
EVERYTHING, AT A TIME OF

885
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,093
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY RISING,

886
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:56,827
ARE WE SEEING THE LIMITS OF

887
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,896
MONETARY POLICY AND CENTRAL-BANK

888
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,730
POLICY NOT JUST IN THE U.S. BUT

889
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,967
AROUND THE WORLD?

890
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:04,835
>> WITH POLICY NEAR ZERO OR EVEN

891
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,971
NEGATIVE IN SOME AREAS OF THE

892
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:13,577
WORLD, MONETARY POLICY HAS RUN

893
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,044
ITS COURSE.

894
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:14,945
WE DO NOT HAVE US MUCH IN THE

895
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,981
TOOLBOX AS WE USED TO.

896
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,550
THIS IS SOMETHING JANET YELLEN

897
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,584
AND COMPANY HAVE EMBRACED AND

898
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,819
WHY THEY STILL FEEL THAT IF YOU

899
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,220
ARE THIS CLOSE TO ZERO, YOU HAVE

900
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,958

MICHAEL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

928
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,759
IS GOING ON HERE, AND THE FED

929
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:54,231
NEEDS TO KEEP IN MIND ALL THESE

930
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:54,998
DIFFERENT HEADWINDS COME ALONG

931
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:59,336
WITH THE WEEK JOBS REPORT, IT

933
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:04,108
IT COMES OUT WITH THE STATEMENT.

934
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,909
>> THEY WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY

935
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,144
THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY ARE

936
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,011
DOING TO IT IS NOT JUST WHAT

00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:08,679
THEY ARE DOING BUT WHY.

938
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:13,983
LET'S LOOK AT THE MARKETS VIEW.

939
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,620
THIS IS WHERE THE FED INFLUENCE

940
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,754
WHAT IS GOING ON PARITY LOOK AT

941
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:19,990
RATE SWAPS GOING FORWARD FIVE

942
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,594
YEARS.

943
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,428
BASICALLY, THE 10 YEAR TREASURY

944
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:28,432
YIELD UP TOP IS SHOWING YOU

945
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,900
WHERE THE MARKET THINKS THE 10

946
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,667
YEAR YIELD WILL BE HALFWAY OUT

947
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:36,773
IN A FIVE-YEAR TIME.

948
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:37,608
YOU TAKE OUT THE 10 YEAR YIELD

949
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,811
AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE MARKET

950
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,645
THINKS THE INTEREST RATE IN THE

951
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:45,849
MARKET IS.

952
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:46,617
IT IS BELOW ZERO AT ALMOST A

953
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,085
RECORD LOW.

954
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:54,124
THE MARKET SEES NO REASON.

955
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,660
>> IS THERE A REASON IT IS IN

956
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,130
DENVER BRONCOS COLORS?

957
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,432
>> UNTIL SEPTEMBER, THEY ARE

958
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:03,066
STILL THE CHAMPIONS.

959
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:06,236
THE MARKETS DO NOT THINK THERE

960
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,238
IS ANY REASON TO TIGHTEN RATES

961
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,508
OUT FIVE OR 10 YEARS PAIRED IF I

962
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,242
DREW THE LINE LONGER, IF YOU

963
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:17,648
COULD GET SWAPS THAT FAR OUT IN

964
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,115
PERPETUITY.

965
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:18,849
WHAT I WOULD SAY, THE MARKETS

966
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,352
ARE SAYING THEY DO NOT ASK THAT

967
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,153
THERE TO BE MUCH OF A RATE HIKE.

968
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:28,125
THOSE NUMBERS ARE WEIGHING

969
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:28,692
SEVERAL SCENARIOS.

970
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,493
A 60% CHANCE OF A HIKE BUT THEN

971
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,762
A 40% CHANCE OF ZERO.

972
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:38,535
YOU GET AN AVERAGE SOMEWHAT

973
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:49,813
BELOW, BUT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT

974
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:50,614
WHAT YOU SEE CONSISTENTLY IS A

975
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,750
GAP BETWEEN THE MARKETS AND IT

976
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,518
IS THE DOCK THAT SHIFT DOWN.

977
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,285
THAT IS JUST A REALITY OF THE

978
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,053
WAY THE MARKETS HAVE USED THIS.

979
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:56,787
>> WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO CHANGE

980
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:57,521
THE MARKET VIEW AT THIS POINT?

981
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,288
WE HAVE INFLATION LOT -- RISING

982
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:58,622
LOWER.

983
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,824
WHICH IS ARE GOING UP AND

984
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:01,625
EQUITIES ARE NOT FALLING OF THEY

985
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,361
ARE HAVING TROUBLE BUT BASICALLY

986
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,897
THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

987
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:07,397
DIRECTION.

988
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,131
>> THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE

989
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:08,766
RIGHT DIRECTION.

990
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,635
I THINK PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON

991
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:12,336
HERE IS JANET YELLEN HAS A

992
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,037
DIFFICULT COMMUNICATIONS

993
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:14,538
CHALLENGE.

994
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:20,277
THIS GOES BACK A NUMBER OF

995
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,044
DECADES, IN MY LIFETIME, IT IS

996
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:21,812
THE FIRST RATE HIKE CYCLE WHERE

997
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,882
INFLATION IS TOO LOW.

998
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,084
WE ARE HIKING BUT WE WANT HIGHER

999
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,886
INFLATION.

1000
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,455
IT IS A TOUGH MESSAGE TO CONVEY

1001
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,255
AND THEY ARE HAVING A CHALLENGE

1002
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:32,723
CONVEYING IT.

1003
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:36,660
SHE USED TO THE WORD UNCERTAIN

1004
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,095
13 TIMES IN A SIX PAGE SPEECH.

1005
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:42,666
EVERYWHERE, LOOK, A LOT OF

1006
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,167
UNCERTAINTY AND I GUESS THE

1007
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:44,968
MARKETS EMBRACED THAT NOTION AND

1008
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:45,736
I DO NOT SEE ANY RATE HIKE IN

1009
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:46,203
THE PIPELINE.

1010
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:50,507
SCARLET: UNCERTAINTY AND CAUTION

1011
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,308
AND ALSO ON THE ONE HAND AND THE

1012
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,143
OTHER HAND.

1013
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,078
TOM: I WENT TO WRITE WHERE

1014
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,113
RICHARD WAS.

1015
00:46:56,113 --> 00:47:02,219
I LOVE THE HUMOR ON THE OTHER

1016
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,288
END, UNLIKE MR. TRUMP.

1017
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:09,159
IN KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION,

1018
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:09,860
I WILL TURN TO THE LESS

1019
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,998
POSITIVE.

1020
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:15,665
SHE TALKED ABOUT IN

1021
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:16,233
UNDERSHOOTING OF THE

1022
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,268
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONSIDERED TO

1023
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,069
BE NORMAL IN THE LONGER RUN AND

1024
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:22,906
WOULD LEAD YOU INTO THE IDEA OF

1025
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:23,740
WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH TIMING.

1026
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,743
HELP US WITH THIS.

1027
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:27,511
HOW ORTHODOX IS THE MEETING

1028
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,781
TODAY?

1029
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:32,916
OR IS THIS NOT UNDER THE

1030
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,451
TEXTBOOKS WE USED WITH COLUMBIA?

1031
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,054
>> IT IS BUT THE REASON WHY IS

1032
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,956
WE HAD THE FED HIKED RATES.

1033
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:44,161
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND FISHER

1034
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,997
HAS MADE THE POINT WELL, POLICY

1035
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:47,831
ACCOMMODATION IS MEASURED BY THE

1036
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,566
REAL INTEREST RATES.

1037
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,702
THE FUND RATE IS BELOW

1038
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:53,170
INFLATION.

1039
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,606
IT IS STILL VERY ACCOMMODATED.

1040
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,608
THEY VIEW IT AS A GRADUAL MOVE

1041
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,744
-- REMOVAL OF ACCOMMODATION.

1042
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,281
THE UNEMPLOYMENT LATE -- RATE

1043
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,816
BELOW, BANKS DO NOT LIKE TO THEY

1044
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,385
WANT A TIGHT LABOR MARKET TO

1045
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,255
PUSH UP INFLATION AND PUSH UP

1046
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:13,357
WAGES.

1047
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,257
THIS IS NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S

1048
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:15,626
OR YOUR UNCLE.

1049
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,730
TOM: A LOT OF THE UNCLES AND

1050
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,833
GRANDMOTHERS IN THOSE CANDIDATES

1051
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:23,633
HAVE A GREAT LOSS OF CREDIBILITY

1052
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:28,204
WITH INSTITUTIONS.

1053
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:29,906
IT 12 MINUTE BEFORE THIS

1054
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:30,574
DECISION, HOW DOES THIS

1055
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,777
INSTITUTION, YOUR FED, HOW DO

1056
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,544
THEY GET BACK CREDIBILITY WITH

1057
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,948
MR. TRUMP, WITH DR. PAUL, AND

1058
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:38,415
THE OTHERS?

1059
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,851
HOW DO THEY PULL THEM BACK INTO

1060
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:45,022
THE CENTRAL BANK FOLD?

1061
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:50,560
>> I WILL NOT GET INTO SPECIFIC

1062
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,361
CANDIDATES, BUT BROADLY, THE

1063
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,996
BANK OF JAPAN AND THE ECB,

1064
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,232
CERTAINLY, BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY

1065
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,032
FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO DO IN

1066
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:59,937
THE CRISIS, THEY WANDERED INTO

1067
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,372
THE SANDBOX OF FISCAL POLICY AND

1068
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,173
TRADITIONALLY, THAT IS DONE BY

1069
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:03,907
CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT AND

1070
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,842
THE TREASURY AND IT IS NOT DONE

1071
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,777
BY THE FED.

1072
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:09,913
I THINK IT IS INEVITABLE.

1073
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,048
I THINK THERE WILL BE POLITICAL

1074
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:15,051
PRESSURE ON THE BANKS IN THE

1075
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:19,389
FUTURE.

1076
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,324
TOM: WE WILL CONTINUE AND AGAIN

1077
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:25,461
MY, VICE CHAIRMAN.

1078
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:26,930
MICHAEL: STILL AHEAD, BEFORE

1079
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,267
JANET YELLEN'S NEWS CONFERENCE,

00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,067
BRIEFINGS THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE

1081
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,602
OUT FOR.

1082
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,039
THAT IS NEXT ON BLOOMBERG

1083
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:42,612
TELEVISION.

1084

♪

1085
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:01,084
MICHAEL: WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY

1086
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,986
FROM THE FED DECISION.

1087
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:03,720
THEY ARE GOING TO PUT A

1088
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,621
STATEMENT OUT AT THE TOP OF THE

1089
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,124
HOUR, GIVING THEIR REASONS FOR

1090
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,859
WHAT THEY DO, EVEN IF THEY DO

1091
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:10,994
NOT DO ANYTHING.

1092
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:11,795
TO WATCH FOR IN THE STATEMENT,

1093
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,565
WE WILL RING IN RICH FROM PIMCO

1094
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,068
AND PLAY A LITTLE GAME.

1095
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:18,868
HERE ARE THE THINGS THEY WILL

1096
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:23,073
HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR THE LABOR

1097
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:23,840
MARKET INFLATION EXPECTATIONS

1098
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,108
AND GLOBAL OUTLOOK.

1099
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,910
LET'S LOOK AT LABOR MARKET

1100
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,579
EXPECTATIONS HERE IT IN THE LAST

1101
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,181
STATEMENT, THE FED SAID THAT

1102
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,015
LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE

1103
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:36,052
IMPROVED FURTHER, EVEN AS GROWTH

1104
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:36,853
IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY APPEARS TO

1105
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,287
HAVE SLOWED.

1106
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:41,391
KEEP IT OR CHANGE IT?

1107
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:41,958
>> CHANGE IT.

1108
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,028
>> WHAT DO THEY SAY?

1109
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,964
>> THEY MAY REVERSE IT AND THEY

1110
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:48,732
MAY SAY THE ECONOMY HAS PICKED

1111
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:49,499
UP FROM Q1 BUT THE LABOR MARKET

1112
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,903
APPEARS TO HAVE SOFTENED.

1113
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,672
>> DO YOU THINK THE MARKET

1114
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,606
PANICS AT THAT IF THEY DO THAT?

1115
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,209
>> NO, I THINK JANET YELLEN GAVE

1116
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,009
A STRONG HINT OF THAT IN HER

1117
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,344
SPEECH.

1118
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,212
SHE COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO SAY IT

1119
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,113
IS ONE DATA POINT.

1120
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:12,155
I THINK THEY WILL DOWNGRADED.

1121
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:17,026
>> INFLATION CONFERENCE --

1122
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:20,764
CONVERSATION REMAIN LOW.

1123
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:21,531
LITTLE CHANGED ON BALANCE IN

00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:28,104
RECENT MONTHS.

1125
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:28,905
THE MICHIGAN NUMBER, ENOUGH TO

1126
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,473
CHANGE IT OR KEEP IT?

1127
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:34,244
>> YELLEN INDICATED SHE IS

1128
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,581
FOLLOWING THAT CLOSELY.

1129
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,415
I THINK THE TRICK WITH CHANGING

1130
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,585
IT IS, IT IS A CLOSE CALL.

1131
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:45,488
THEY WILL CHANGE IT THOUGH.

1132
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,990
THE LAST THING IS THE BIG CHANGE

1133
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:51,861
THEY MADE.

1134
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:52,729
THEY TOOK OUT THE EXTENSIVE LINE

1135
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,433
ABOUT THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS.

1136
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,802
THE COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO

1137
00:53:58,802 --> 00:53:59,602
CLOSELY MONITOR INDICATORS AND A

1138
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:02,606
GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

1139
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:06,910
DEVELOPMENTS.

1140
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,710
DO THEY JUST LEAVE IT AT THIS

1141
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,979
POINT?

1142
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:09,712
>> I THINK THEY LEAVE IT

1143
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:10,480
UNCHANGED.

1144
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,350
TOM: DO YOU REALIZE IT IS AT THE

1145
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:18,821
DINING ROOM TABLE.

1146
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:20,657
>> THAT IS FRIGHTENING.

1147
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,825
>> IT IS PLANNED.

1148
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,526
>> DOES THE FETTIG KNOWLEDGE

1149
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,729
THAT HOUSEHOLD SPENDING HISTORY

1150
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:27,063
OK?

1151
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,632
RETAIL SALES TO BETTER THAN

1152
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:29,532
EXPECTED.

1153
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,768
IT HAS IT -- IT HAS BEEN HOLDING

1154
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,670
UP.

1155
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,506
>> Q1 WAS VERY SOFT AND Q2 IS

1156
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,809
SHAPING UP TO BE GROWTH AROUND

1157
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,146
2.5%.

1158
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,013
POSSIBLY, CONSUMER NUMBERS HAVE

1159
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:46,049
BEEN GOOD.

1160
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:46,883
THEY WANT TO KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE

1161
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,352
HAD A PICK UP.

1162
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,354
THEY NEED A PICKUP FOR A YEAR TO

1163
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:51,821
PLAY OUT.

1164
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:57,360
TOM: MIKE, WHEN WAS YOUR FIRST

1165
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,262
FED MEETING WITH BURNS?

1166
00:54:59,262 --> 00:54:59,996
HOW DID WE GET TO THESE

1167
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,164
STATEMENTS?

1168
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:01,965
PUT UP ONE OF THOSE QUOTES

1169
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,834
AGAIN.

1170
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:09,839
YOU REMEMBER YES OR NO.

1171
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,910
>> THE FIRST STATEMENT, WE

1172
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,513
CHANGE RATES.

1173
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,648
WE MIGHT DO IT AGAIN.

1174
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,052
WE NOW HAVE THESE STATEMENTS.

1175
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,021
>> IS IT WORSE FOR THE MARKETS,

1176
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:29,125
ADDED CLARITY, OR IS IT BETTER

1177
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:29,859
FOR THE MARKET TO HAVE MORE

1178
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:30,326
INFORMATION?

1179
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,160
>> I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR THE

1180
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,963
FED IS NOT TO HAVE TOO MUCH

1181
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,133
INFORMATION, BUT THEY HAVE TO

1182
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:43,173
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REACTION IS.

1183
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,742
IT PROMISES THE COMMITTEE

1184
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:51,247
ITSELF.

1185
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,450
A DIFFERENT MIX ON THE

1186
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,118
COMMITTEE, WE WOULD HAVE

1187
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:55,752
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS.

1188
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,655
THAT IS THE CHALLENGE.

1189
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,489
>> DOES THAT GET CONVEYED THE

1190
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,292
WAY THEY VOTE?

1191
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,527
MOST OF THOSE VOTES HAVE BEEN

1192
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,363
UNANIMOUS.

1193
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,399
>> IT DOES NOT SHOW UP IN THE

1194
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,533
VOTING BUT IT DOES SHOW UP

1195
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,371
BETWEEN THE MEETINGS.

1196
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,107
THE RATIO NOISE IS TOUGH TO THIS

1197
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:26,749
IN TANGLE.

1198
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:28,351
>> WE ARE LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES

1199
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:32,589
AWAY FROM THE FED DECISION.

1200
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,290
THE FORMER PHILADELPHIA FED

1201
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:38,328
PRESIDENT, HE SAYS THE DOWNSIDE

1202
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:42,031
TO A CONSENSUS VOTE IS LANGUAGE.

1203
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,334
IF YOU CANNOT VOTE WHAT YOU WANT

1204
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,068
TO VOTE, YOU HAVE TO CATCH

1205
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,169
EVERYTHING IN THOSE TERMS WITH

1206
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:51,441
TOM WAS CONFUSED.

1207
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:58,214
>> THE REAL INNOVATION HERE, IS

1208
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:01,150
TO HAVE THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED

1209
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,219
PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THE CHAIR

1210
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,821
CAN USE THE BULLY PULPIT TO GIVE

1211
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,723
HER READ OF THE SITUATION.

1212
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,225
BEN BERNANKE USED THAT WELL AND

1213
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:10,026
I THINK JANET YELLEN HAS USED

1214
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:15,531
THAT EFFECTIVELY AS WELL.

1215
00:57:15,531 --> 00:57:16,332
>> RIGHT NOW ON OVERSHOOT, IT

1216
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,367
SHOWED UP A LOT.

1217
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,569
MAYBE OVERSHOOT IS THE NEW

1218
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,871
SLACK.

1219
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:26,843
I HAVE PUT THE CHART OUT ON

1220
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:27,644
BLOOMBERG RADIO PLUS, BUT IT IS

1221
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:33,783
TO MEASURES OF CPI GOING UP, A

1222
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:38,221
PHRASE FROM RUDY WHO TRAGICALLY

1223
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:42,358
DIED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

1224
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,227
CAN A CENTRAL BANK MANAGE AND

1225
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:48,264
OVER SHOOT OR ARE THEY DREAMING?

1226
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:52,168
>> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

1227
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:55,171
I THINK THEY WANT TO OVERSHOOT.

1228
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,907
THEY WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH AN

1229
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:58,775
INFLATION TARGET.

1230
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:05,481
ON THE ONE HAND, ON THE OTHER

1231
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:06,215
HAND, THEY HAVE BEEN BELOW

1232
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:06,849
AVERAGE FOR FIVE YEARS.

1233
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:09,152
THEY MAY NEED TO ENGINEER A

1234
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,120
MODEST OVERSHOOT.

1235
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,389
THEY DO NOT WANT TO OVERDO IT

1236
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,092
AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE GETTING

1237
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:24,600
TOO COY FOR MY SHOOT.

1238
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,338
TOM: EQUITIES, BONDS,

1239
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:32,341
CURRENCIES, I WILL ADD A

1240
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:33,042
BALANCING IN THE EQUITIES

1241
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:37,846
MARKETS.

1242
00:58:37,846 --> 00:58:39,382
THE TWO-YEAR YIELDS LOWER AND

1243
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:42,051
LOWER.

1244
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:46,556
1.61 IN OIL.

1245
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:50,560
A CHART TO HELP OUT.

1246
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,829
>> WE'RE LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR

1247
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:53,229
YIELD.

1248
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,866
MOST EFFECTED BY WHAT THE FED

1249
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,366
DOES TODAY.

1250
00:58:57,366 --> 00:59:02,071
IT HAS BEEN VOLATILE.

1251
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:02,872
GOING INTO THE MORNING, THEY

1252
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:09,912
COME BACK AGAIN.

1253
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:15,218
SCARLET: WHAT TYPE OF REACTION

1254
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:15,985
DID WE SEE TO THE NUMBERS THAT

1255
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,388
CAME OUT THIS MORNING THAT SHOW

1256
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,155
A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN

1257
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:19,956
ANTICIPATED BY ECONOMIST'S?

1258
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,259
>> NOT A WHOLE LOT.

1259
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,261
IT FEEDS INTO THE IDEA THAT

1260
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,028
THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE

1261
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:28,865
BETTER OUT THERE.

1262
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:33,369
IN GENERAL, THE NUMBERS ARE NOT

1263
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,206
THAT BAD.

1264
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,107
>> WAY MORE INTERNATIONAL THAN I

1265
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,977
EVER HAVE DONE.

1266
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:46,015
THE 105 IS STILL STUNNING.

1267
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,185
105 AND 92.

1268
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:52,088
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

1269
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,124
NOTED IN OUR AGO, AGAIN NOTICING

1270
00:59:55,124 --> 01:00:00,229
KILLING ONE SEES UP, A TWO YEAR

1271
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,399
YIELD.

1272
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,167
VERY QUICKLY, THE GERMAN

1273
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,936
TWO-YEAR NEGATIVE 0.60, GERMAN

1274
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,239
10 YEAR, ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO

1275
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:16,345
KNOW IS THIS MAY BE THE MOST

1276
01:00:16,345 --> 01:00:17,213
INTERNATIONAL MEETING I'VE SEEN

1277
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,849
THAT THE CHAIR HAS TO FACE.

1278
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:21,384
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1279
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:22,418
IT IS NOT JUST GERMANY.

1280
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:25,655
U.K. FALLING AS WELL.

1281
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,090
I AM FOCUSED ON DOLLAR YEN'S

1282
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:27,490
HERE.

1283
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,291
IT IS IN OUR SOMETHING THE BANK

1284
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,461
OF JAPAN CANNOT LIKE IT ALL.

1285
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,930
WE TALKED ABOUT THE STANDARD

1286
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:34,764
DEVIATION MOVE IN THE DOLLAR YEN

1287
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:35,531
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

1288
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,400
THE BANK OF JAPAN NEEDS TO STEP

1289
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,100
IN AS WELL.

1290
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,473
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT VERY -- HAS

1291
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,708
TO FOLLOW UP WITH HIS MEETING

1292
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,811
LATER ON.

1293
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,080
>>'S FOLLOW-UP IS THE SAME AS

1294
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,814
THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL

1295
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,883
HAPPEN IN THE GREXIT VOTE.

1296
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:54,717
THE FEELING IS MAYBE THEY HAVE

1297
01:00:54,717 --> 01:01:02,191
TO WAIT AS WELL.

1298
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,025
>> THEY WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW

1299
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:06,295
THE BRICKS WILL VOTE.

1300
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,063
>> TAKE A LOOK AT HOW IT IS

1301
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,631
TRADING AT THE MOMENT.

1302
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,967
OPEN ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE

1303
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,803
LEAD UP TO THE GREXIT.

1304
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,038
CURRENTLY AT 14160 WE WANT TO

1305
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:17,640
CHECK IN WITH ERIK SCHATZKER,

1306
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,140
WHO IS LIVE.

1307
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:23,813
>> NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES.

1308
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:24,847
THE FED IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION

1309
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:28,818
IS HOLDING AT A QUARTER

1310
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:29,385
PERCENTAGE POINT.

1311
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,620
WHAT IS HOLDING IS THE OUTLOOK,

1312
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,856
THE OUTLOOK FOR RATE INCREASES.

1313
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,726
ANOTHER BIG SHIP BY THE FED,

1314
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:41,731
LOWER FOR LONGER, I REPEAT,

1315
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,498
LOWER FOR LONGER, EVERYBODY.

1316
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,000
A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

1317
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,769
FEDERAL MARKET COMMITTEE STILL

1318
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:52,241
ANTICIPATE INCREASES BY THE END

1319
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:52,742
OF THE YEAR.

1320
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:53,509
SIX NOW FAVOR ONLY A SINGLE 25

1321
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:58,014
RACIST POINTS HIKE.

1322
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,849
YOU RECALL ONLY ONE MEMBER WAS

1323
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:03,853
THAT DOVISH.

1324
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:04,654
PLUS THE COMMITTEE NOW EXPECTS

1325
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,756
TO RAISE RATES AT A SLOWER PACE

1326
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:12,295
IN 2017 IN 2018 TO NOT ONLY IS

1327
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,162
THE FED MORE DOVISH, BUT IT HAS

1328
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,832
GROWN MORE DOVISH SINCE THE LAST

1329
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:18,034
MEETING IN APRIL AND REMEMBER

1330
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:18,768
FROM THE MINUTES THAT MOST OF

1331
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:19,902
VOTING MEMBERS WERE READY TO

1332
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:26,208
RAISE RATES IN JUNE AS INFLATION

1333
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:29,378
CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN.

1334
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:31,213
>> OF COURSE WE HAVE THE

1335
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:32,014
DISASTROUS JOBS REPORT AND HERE

1336
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,082
IS WHAT THE FED SAID.

1337
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:39,122
THE PACE OF IMPROVEMENT AND

1338
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,190
LABOR MARKET HAS SLOWED.

1339
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:42,024
INFLATION COMPENSATION DECLINED.

1340
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,194
IN OTHER WORDS, NOT ENOUGH TO

1341
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,730
JUSTIFY A RATE HIKE THE ARE

1342
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,497
NOTABLY, NO MENTION IN THE

1343
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:49,298
POLICY STATEMENT OF THE GREXIT

1344
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:51,467
RISK.

1345
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,169
THE FED IS ON HOLD AND GIVING NO

1346
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:56,339
SIGN HOW SOON IT MAY MOVE OFF OF

1347
01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:00,242
THE QUARTER-POINT P ARE WE HOPE

1348
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:01,043
TO IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH

1349
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:01,877
JANET YELLEN.

1350
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:07,549
THAT BEGINS AT 2:30.

1351
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:10,486
>> WE HAVE SEEN A MAJOR MARKET

1352
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:10,820
MOVE.

1353
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,620
GIVEN ME THE DATA SCREENS IF YOU

1354
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:11,954
WOULD.

1355
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,256
I WANT TO SHOW HERE AT THE

1356
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:16,392
MOMENT ON THE SCREEN.

1357
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:17,960
THE MARKET IS UP 84 AND THE VIX

1358
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,329
PLUNGERS.

1359
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,431
THAT IS A COMPLACENCY THAT WILL

1360
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:27,470
SUPPORT THE FED.

1361
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:31,474
MICHAEL MCKEE REVERSAL.

1362
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:37,546
IT GOES RIGHT BACK.

1363
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:38,347
BRING ON THE SECOND DATA SCREEN

1364
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:39,582
AS WELL.

1365
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,618
I WILL SHOW IT IN THE MOMENT.

1366
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:45,755
A STRONG END.

1367
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,591
MICHAEL, VERY QUICKLY.

1368
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,159
I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT AN

1369
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,228
IMPORTANT, IT.

1370
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:56,332
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS DOWN WE

1371
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:56,665
GO.

1372
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:59,335
THIS IS CRUSHING.

1373
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:05,107
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.

1374
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,910
ARE YOU READY?

1375
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:13,348
>> IT IS ALREADY UPDATED.

1376
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:14,083
YOU CAN SEE WHAT. IS JUST

1377
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,119
TALKING ABOUT.

1378
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:17,920
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE MOVED

1379
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,524
THE FORECASTED DOWN AND NOW THE

1380
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,358
CONSENSUS IS BASICALLY, IF YOU

1381
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,159
ARE LOOKING AT THE MEDIAN, ONE

1382
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,561
MORE MOVE WILL TAKE US TO A

1383
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:30,466
RANGE OF 50 OR 75 BASIS POINTS.

1384
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:31,267
WE ARE NOT EXPECTING TO MORE

1385
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,502
MOVES THIS YEAR.

1386
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:34,336
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF

1387
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:37,039
PEOPLE WHO THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

1388
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,578
JUST WENT ALL THE WAY OVER AT

1389
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:43,179
THE LEFT-HAND SIDE.

1390
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,046
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE PRICING IN

1391
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,182
FOUR MOVES JUST OVER 1.6% AND

1392
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,618
THEN YOU GO ALL THE WAY OUT TO

1393
01:04:49,618 --> 01:04:51,253
THE LONGER-TERM AND YOU ARE

1394
01:04:51,253 --> 01:05:01,330
LOOKING AT 2.95.

1395
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:07,536
YOU CAN SEE THE PURPLE LINE.

1396
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,305
YOU CAN SEE THE MARKET

1397
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:12,141
EXPECTATION HAS MOVED UP A

1398
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,211
LITTLE BIT AS WELL AS THEY

1399
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,915
DIGEST WHAT THE FED HAS SEEN.

1400
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:19,648
THEY WANT TO MOVE CLOSER

1401
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:21,317
TOGETHER AND THE MARKET WANTS

1402
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,084
THEM TO MOVE DOWN MAYBE NOT AS

1403
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:26,756
MUCH AS THEY HAVE.

1404
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,623
>> IT WAS THE FED THAT CAME DOWN

1405
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,625
IN THAT MARKET WENT UP.

1406
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:30,459
>> THE MARKETS WENT UP A LITTLE

1407
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:33,062
BIT IN THE OUT YEARS OF 2018,

1408
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:39,402
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE FED HAD.

1409
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:44,240
SCARLET: THE FUNCTION MEASURES

1410
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,610
PROBABILITY.

1411
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:51,447
AND 8.6% CHANCE, JULY 27

1412
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:51,881
MEETING.

1413
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:56,652
COMPARE THAT WITH 15.8%.

1414
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:01,724
IN TERMS OF GOING OUT FURTHER,

1415
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:02,491
THE MARKET DOES NOT REALLY SEE

1416
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,094
THE RATE HIKE INCREASE TO MORE

1417
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:10,866
THAN 30%.

1418
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,535
IT IS VERSAILLES WE HAVE SEEN

1419
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:16,639
40% INCREASE.

1420
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:22,811
TOM: WHEN I READ YOUR PAPER, ALL

1421
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:23,646
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS DID NOT

1422
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,547
EXIST.

1423
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:28,083
TO OUR ELITE ECONOMISTS KNOW

1424
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:30,186
WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE

1425
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,887
THIS?

1426
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,791
>> SURE.

1427
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:39,128
THE BIG CHANGE COMPARED TO THE

1428
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,996
CRISIS OF UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

1429
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:41,764
CENTRAL BANKS NEED TO TAKE A

1430
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,765
STAND OR A FOLK US AND GET A

1431
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:48,237
SENSE OF WHERE NATURAL IS.

1432
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,805
IT IS ALSO A RISK MANAGEMENT

1433
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:57,279
APPROACH CLOSE TO ZERO.

1434
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,147
I THINK THIS IS A HARDER PROBLEM

1435
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,182
THEY ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.

1436
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,085
>> A QUESTION.

1437
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:11,393
THIS IS NOT POPULAR.

1438
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:13,062
>> THAT IS THE TRAITOR SITTING

1439
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:19,568
ON 46TH STREET.

1440
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,070
COME ON, THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY

1441
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,738
PLANNED.

1442
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:23,305
MASSIVE OUTLIERS.

1443
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:29,211
SCARLET: ERIK SCHATZKER HAS BEEN

1444
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,012
COMING THROUGH AND YOU NOTED A

1445
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,815
COUPLE OF CHANGES IN CHAIR

1446
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,216
YELLEN'S STANCE, HER LANGUAGE

1447
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,553
FROM DECEMBER UNTIL NOW.

1448
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,320
>> I AM LOOKING MORE AT THE

1449
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,121
DOTS.

1450
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,290
REMEMBER IN DECEMBER WHEN THE

1451
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,826
FED GOT OFF ZERO AND RAISE RATES

1452
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:48,697
, IT ANTICIPATED RAISING RATES

1453
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,366
FOUR MORE TIMES OVER THE COURSE

1454
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:51,367
OF 2016.

1455
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,168
HOW MUCH MORE DOVISH THIS FED

1456
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:57,139
HAS GROWN IN THAT SIX MONTHS, IN

1457
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:57,906
DECEMBER, 14 OF THE 17 VOTING

1458
01:07:57,906 --> 01:08:01,143
MEMBERS SOUGHT #RATES AT 1% OR

1459
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:08,783
ABOVE BY THE END OF 2016.

1460
01:08:08,783 --> 01:08:14,423
IN DECEMBER, 12 OF THOSE ARE 2%

1461
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:19,794
OR ABOVE BY THE END OF 2017.

1462
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:23,399
IT IS TRULY INCREDIBLE.

1463
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,198
I WANT TO POINT OUT ONE OTHER

1464
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:24,533
THING.

1465
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,736
THE FED IS STICKING TO A GRADUAL

1466
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:34,209
RATE INCREASE OVER TIME.

1467
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:35,109
GETTING THE FOMC AND THE ECONOMY

1468
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:35,810
BACK TO A NORMALIZATION.

1469
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:40,549
WE WILL HEAR WHAT JANET YELLEN

1470
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,350
SAYS IN THE FACE OF THE FED

1471
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,187
STICKING TO THE IDEA THAT

1472
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:50,792
GRADUAL IS EVEN WANTED AT THIS

1473
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:51,225
POINT.

1474
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:53,862
THAT WORD NEEDS TO BE IN THE

1475
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:54,630
STATEMENT AND WHETHER THE FED

1476
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,430
CAN CONTEMPLATE NORMALIZATION AT

1477
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,966
THIS TIME.

1478
01:08:57,966 --> 01:08:59,734
>> THEY ARE GRADUAL IN THE

1479
01:08:59,734 --> 01:09:02,970
FORECAST TO NEXT YEAR AND ONLY

1480
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,339
1.5%.

1481
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:04,106
PRETTY BLAND ABOUT WHAT IS GOING

1482
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:06,475
ON.

1483
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,209
WHY THEY HAVE COMING DOWN SO

1484
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:07,743
MUCH.

1485
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:14,750
>> IT IS VERY SHORT ON DETAILS.

1486
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,551
GRADUAL WAS THE WERE USING BACK

1487
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,853
IN DECEMBER.

1488
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,055
IF YOU DEFINE GRADUAL IN

1489
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:20,856
DECEMBER, IT WAS MORE OR LESS A

1490
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:25,361
RATE HIKE ONE OF EVERY TWO

1491
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:25,794
MEETINGS.

1492
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,899
WE HAVE HAD THE FED ON HOLD AND

1493
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,767
IT JANET YELLEN AND COMPANY ARE

1494
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,102
GIVING US NO CLUE AND WE MAY GET

1495
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:33,935
ANOTHER CLUE WHEN WE GET IN THE

1496
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,471
ROOM, BUT GIVING US NOTE LOU

1497
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:38,273
WHEN WE EXPECT THE NEXT RATE

1498
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:38,807
HIKE TO COME.

1499
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:39,441
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

1500
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,477
CREDIBILITY.

1501
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:42,211
THAT WORD CREPT INTO THE

1502
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:42,678
MINUTES.

1503
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,947
IT HAS TO BE CONCERNED OF THE

1504
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:45,714
USE OF THE WORD GRADUAL GIVEN

1505
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:49,818
WHERE WE ARE TODAY RELATIVE TO

1506
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:50,652
WHERE WE WERE IN DECEMBER WHEN

1507
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:51,420
THEY WERE USING THE SAME LINE

1508
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,990
WHICH.

1509
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:55,858
SCARLET: THAT MEANS THE CONTRAST

1510
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:00,695
IS PRETTY DRAMATIC.

1511
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:01,363
RICH IS STILL WITH US.

1512
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:07,702
THE INTEREST RATE WAS CUT 3%.

1513
01:10:07,702 --> 01:10:08,537
THE BUSINESS CYCLE WE ARE IN NOW

1514
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:13,775
IS DIFFERENT OVERALL.

1515
01:10:13,775 --> 01:10:18,414
>> THAT IS THE CASE.

1516
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:22,151
2012, THAT WAS AT 4.25.

1517
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,352
IT IS NOW AT THREE.

1518
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:30,692
IT HAS FALLEN SUBSTANTIALLY.

1519
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:34,363
THAT AS WELL.

1520
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:38,300
THIS -- THIS IS WHAT WE CALL FOR

1521
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:38,834
MONETARY POLICY.

1522
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,370
IT WILL NOT ONLY BE GRADUAL, BUT

1523
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,004
IT IS TO A MUCH LOWER

1524
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:45,774
DESTINATION.

1525
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,210
THIS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY THE

1526
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,044
FED THAT THIS IS THE WORLD THEY

1527
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:49,745
ARE NAVIGATING RIGHT NOW

1528
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,580
ABSOLUTELY.

1529
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,516
TOM: WHERE IS THE TERMINAL RATE.

1530
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:55,451
JOHN PUBLISHED A NOTE THREE DAYS

1531
01:10:55,451 --> 01:11:03,792
AGO OF 2% TERMINAL RATE, WHICH I

1532
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,560
FIND SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY

1533
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,096
UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE NATION.

1534
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:07,963
IN YOUR ESTIMATION, WHERE IS THE

1535
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:12,034
TERMINAL RATE, ALL THE USERS IN

1536
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:12,901
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WATCHING WHO

1537
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:17,239
WOULD GO HIT THEM OVER THE HEAD,

1538
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,774
WHERE ARE WE GOING IN THREE OR

1539
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,644
FIVE OR EVEN 10 YEARS?

1540
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:24,179
>> THERE IS A NEW NEUTRAL, WHICH

1541
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:24,947
WE HAVE DEFINED AS A FED FUNDS

1542
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:28,750
RATE OF TWO OR 3% AND GIVEN

1543
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:33,355
WHERE THE FED IS NOW, IT IS

1544
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,356
PROBABLY THE LOWER END OF THE

1545
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,958
RANGE AND WITH A 2% INFLATION,

1546
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,528
THAT MEANS A REAL RETURN ON CASH

1547
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,829
20 COMPARED WITH 200 BASIS

1548
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,699
POINTS ON THAT CRISIS.

1549
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,833
IN FIVE OR 10 YEARS, WE WILL

1550
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:49,438
PROBABLY HAVE A RECESSION.

1551
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:54,042
IF WE DO, THE FED WILL BE HIKING

1552
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:54,343
.

1553
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:55,143
THAT IS THE OTHER FACTOR TO TAKE

1554
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:56,912
INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL.

1555
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,081
>> WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE

1556
01:11:59,081 --> 01:11:59,848
FED'S ECONOMIC FORECAST.

1557
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,950
THEY MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

1558
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:05,087
THIS YEAR.

1559
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,222
BRINGING DOWN THE FORECAST GOING

1560
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,957
OUT TO 2018, THEY SEE THE

1561
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:09,725
ECONOMY GROWING 1.9-2 PERCENT

1562
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:12,928
THIS YEAR.

1563
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:21,369
IN MARCH, THEY HAD SEEN 2.1-2.3.

1564
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:22,604
SO THEY SEE SLOWER GROWTH BUT AT

1565
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,707
THE SAME TIME, THEY SEE RICH AND

1566
01:12:25,707 --> 01:12:26,308
FASTER INFLATION.

1567
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:27,743
THEY'RE CALLING FOR THE PRICE

1568
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:33,181
INDEX OF 1.7 THIS YEAR.

1569
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:33,949
IN MARCH, THE ONLY SAW 1% TO

1570
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:38,486
1.6%.

1571
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:40,322
>> I THINK THIS RECOGNIZES THE

1572
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:41,056
POTENTIAL GROWTH RATE IN THE

1573
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,291
ECONOMY HAS REALLY SLOWED

1574
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:47,629
GLOBALLY AND I THINK IN THEIR

1575
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:48,463
VIEW, THEY HAVE GOT A SLOW RATE

1576
01:12:48,463 --> 01:12:50,899
OF POTENTIAL GROWTH AND MICEX

1577
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,801
ARE CLOSING AND THEIR MODELS ARE

1578
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:53,602
TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD GET

1579
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,003
GIVE A PICKUP IN INFLATION, AS I

1580
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:55,804
SAID.

1581
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:56,572
THIS IS A FED THAT ONE TIRE

1582
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:59,608
INFLATION.

1583
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:02,077
THIS IS A FED THAT IS HIKING

1584
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:02,711
RATES AND WANTS HIGHER

1585
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:03,145
INFLATION.

1586
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,479
THAT IS WHEN -- THE WAY THE

1587
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:05,314
MODEL INSTRUCTS THEM.

1588
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:09,985
TOM: RICHARD WILL CONTINUE WITH

1589
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:10,319
US.

1590
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:23,431
LET ME DO A DATA CHECK.

1591
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:24,266
A MAJOR MOVE IN THE FIXED INCOME

1592
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:24,733
MARKET NOW.

1593
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,367
THE TWO YEAR YIELD THOSE

1594
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:26,134
ROUNDTRIPPER OVER THE LAST 48

1595
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:26,468
HOURS.

1596
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,235
WE WENT FROM .67 AND WE GO RIGHT

1597
01:13:27,235 --> 01:13:27,970
BACK DOWN IN THE LOW END OF A

1598
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,837
RECENTA MAJOR MOVE IN THE FIXEDE

1599
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:29,271
MARKET NOW.

1600
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:29,671
 RANGE.

1601
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:33,709
THE 158 LEVEL, GOOD MORNING.

1602
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:39,915
HSBC ON THE EARLIER CALL OF 1.50

1603
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,650
PERCENT.

1604
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:49,591
AS SCARLET STATED, THE NFL ON A

1605
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,459
577, YOU REALLY WONDER HOW JAPAN

1606
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:51,126
WILL WAKE UP ON THURSDAY

1607
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:51,493
MORNING.

1608
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,797
SCARLET: THIS IS THE WEAKEST

1609
01:13:54,797 --> 01:14:00,035
LEVEL OF THE DOLLAR AGAINST THE

1610
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,236
ANSYS SEPTEMBER 2014.

1611
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,070
I WANT TO BRING IN THE COHEAD OF

1612
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,939
THE GLOBAL FIXED PORTFOLIO

1613
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,807
MANAGEMENT GOAL ASSET

1614
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:22,323
MANAGEMENT.

1615
01:14:22,323 --> 01:14:23,091
ARE YOU CHANGING HOW YOU ARE

1616
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:23,892
ALLOCATING YOUR FUNDS AND ARE

1617
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:24,693
YOU CHANGING HOW YOU ARE PUTTING

1618
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:25,460
YOUR MONEY RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHAT

1619
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,061
YOU HAVE JUST LEARNED?

1620
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:26,795
>> THE STATEMENT WILL NOT COST

1621
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:27,529
-- WILL NOT CAUSE US TO CHANGE

1622
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:27,963
PORTFOLIOS.

1623
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:28,664
WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHERE THE

1624
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:29,064
NEWS WAS.

1625
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:29,831
THE NEWS WAS IN THE JOBS REPORT

1626
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:31,299
IN THE NEWS WAS IN THE LOWER

1627
01:14:31,299 --> 01:14:32,668
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS IN THE

1628
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,435
MARKETPLACE AND IN SLOWER

1629
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,370
CORPORATE EARNINGS.

1630
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:41,043
THERE ARE FUNDAMENTALS CAUSING

1631
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,011
US TO CHANGE OUR POSITION IN THE

1632
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:43,445
PORTFOLIOS.

1633
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:44,212
>> IT IS ALSO IN THE WAY THE FED

1634
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:46,648
INTERPRETED AND FRAMED THE DATA

1635
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:51,419
WE'VE ALL BEEN REACTING TO.

1636
01:14:51,419 --> 01:14:52,220
>> AS ALL OF YOU AND SOME OF

1637
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,088
YOUR SPEAKERS HAVE SAID, THE FED

1638
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,423
IS JUST CATCHING UP WITH THE

1639
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,491
MARKET HERE WITH THE FED IS

1640
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:57,325
DOING IS REPORTING THE NEWS AND

1641
01:14:57,325 --> 01:14:58,060
FOLLOWING THE MARKET IN OUR

1642
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,761
VIEW.

1643
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,464
>> ONE MORE RATE INCREASE THIS

1644
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:06,435
YEAR, LOWERING GROWTH FORECAST,

1645
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,469
AT THIS POINT, YOU ARE GOING TO

1646
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,203
BE ABLE TO GO ON VACATION IN

1647
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:08,937
JULY AND JUST FORGET THAT

1648
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:09,471
EATING?

1649
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,506
>> THERE IS A LOT GOING ON

1650
01:15:11,506 --> 01:15:15,043
ACROSS THE MARKETS.

1651
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:15,911
YOU THINK ABOUT GREXIT AND CHINA

1652
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:16,745
RISK AND THE SLOWER ECONOMY IN

1653
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:18,514
THE U.S. 

1654
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,582
THOSE KEEP US UP AT NIGHT MORE

1655
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,316
THAN A SINGLE FED MEETING.

1656
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:24,352
THE RISK OF RATES, I WOULD SAY

1657
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:25,521
THE OPPOSITE IS THE RISK.

1658
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:29,424
THE RISK IS THAT THE SESSION

1659
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:30,926
RISK IS HIGHER NOW.

1660
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:31,693
THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE

1661
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,264
CONCERN.

1662
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,098
>> YOUR TRADE BACKGROUND, WHAT

1663
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,600
WILL BE THE STABILITY WHEN YOU

1664
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,538
HAVE A JUMP CONDITION?

1665
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,640
28 YEARS OLD, THEY JUST TOOK

1666
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,408
LEVEL TWO AND LEVEL THREE, DO

1667
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,877
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS?

1668
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:49,711
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED LIKE

1669
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,782
YOU HAVE HERE WHEN YOU GET THE

1670
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:54,516
JUMP CONDITION, HOW WILL THE

1671
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:55,651
MARKETS REACT?

1672
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:58,720
>> WE HAVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

1673
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,723
WITH GRAY HAIR.

1674
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:06,662
WE HAVE A TON OF BLOOMBERG.

1675
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:10,899
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY COACHING THEM

1676
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:11,566
BUT THEY ARE STUDENTS OF

1677
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:13,735
HISTORY.

1678
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,004
WE ARE VERY MUCH FOCUSED AND

1679
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,739
MUCH MORE CONCERN ABOUT WHERE

1680
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,841
THINGS GO IN TERMS OF THE RISK

1681
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:22,311
OF A SLOWDOWN AND THE ECONOMY.

1682
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,078
WE ARE TRYING TO COACH HIM

1683
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,147
PEOPLE.

1684
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,815
>> WHAT I WANT TO KNOW FROM YOU

1685
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:30,051
IS THE JULY MEETING AND THE

1686
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:30,786
SEPTEMBER MEETING, IT IS NOT

1687
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:33,155
COMMERCIAL PAPER.

1688
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,589
IN THE TRENCHES AT GOLDMAN SACHS

1689
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:37,926
ASSET MANAGEMENT?

1690
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:41,096
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.

1691
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,099
NUMBER ONE, THE THING THE FED IS

1692
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:44,800
WATCHING MOST CLOSELY AS

1693
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,467
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

1694
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:48,136
WE WATCHED INDEX VERY CLOSELY.

1695
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:49,905
GOLDMAN SACHS HAPPENED TO HAVE

1696
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:54,042
ONE AS WELL.

1697
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:54,743
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE

1698
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:57,145
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE NOW,

1699
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,947
THEY ARE AT ABOUT THE SAME PLACE

1700
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,048
THEY WERE IN DECEMBER WHEN THE

1701
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:01,283
FED TIGHTENED FOR THE FIRST

1702
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:01,650
TIME.

1703
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:02,217
THAT IS NUMBER ONE.

1704
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,084
NUMBER TWO, WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN

1705
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:04,753
INCREASE IN NATION AT

1706
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,389
DICTATIONS.

1707
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,391
WE WATCHING WAGE DATA VERY

1708
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:09,858
CLOSELY.

1709
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,626
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF

1710
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:14,362
SURVEYS RECENTLY IS INFLATION

1711
01:17:14,362 --> 01:17:19,667
EXPECTATIONS.

1712
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:20,969
>> HISTORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE

1713
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:21,803
BEST START IN THE BEST START IN

1714
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,372
THEY GO TOO MUCH AND TOO FAST.

1715
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:25,140
WITH THE WAY THEY BROUGHT IT

1716
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:30,145
DOWN, HE FINALLY WILLING -- ARE

1717
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,880
YOU FINALLY GOING TO ACCEPT THE

1718
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,514
GRADUALLY QUESTION >>

1719
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:33,382
ABSOLUTELY.

1720
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:38,387
-- GRADUALLY?

1721
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:41,790
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1722
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,624
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE

1723
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:47,862
WORLD WILL OPERATE.

1724
01:17:47,862 --> 01:17:49,364
THE OTHER THING WAS A

1725
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:50,699
PRESUMPTION OF ALL STUDENTS OF

1726
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:51,533
THE CENTRAL BANK POLICY WAS THAT

1727
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:56,071
THE EUROPE -- THE U.S. WAS AN

1728
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:56,504
ECONOMY.

1729
01:17:56,504 --> 01:17:57,272
WHAT HAPPENS IN GENERAL DOES NOT

1730
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:58,640
MATTER.

1731
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,043
>> THAT IS NOT SURE ANYMORE.

1732
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:02,844
CAPITAL FLOWS ARE SIGNIFICANT

1733
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,545
AND HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE

1734
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,080
MARKET.

1735
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:05,914
TOM: ON THE ACTUAL TRADING AND

1736
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:10,418
DOING OF THINGS IN THE MARKET, I

1737
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:12,688
HAVE GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU.

1738
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:18,760
I REMEMBER DAVID WAS TALKING

1739
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,527
ABOUT FOUR STANDARD DEVIATION

1740
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:20,262
MOVES AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT

1741
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:20,729
OIS FOR THAT.

1742
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:24,933
HOW CLOSE -- THAT IS THE WRONG

1743
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:25,400
QUESTION.

1744
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,003
HOW DEEP IS THE MARKET NOW TO

1745
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:28,904
WITHSTAND STANDARD DEVIATION

1746
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:31,907
SHOCK?

1747
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:35,110
>> LIQUIDITY IS INCREDIBLY

1748
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,879
CHALLENGED ACROSS THE MARKETS.

1749
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,916
I WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT YOU

1750
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,884
WOULD HAVE MORE AND MORE

1751
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:47,255
SHORT-TERM BLIPS IN MARKETS

1752
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,089
BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LIQUIDITY.

1753
01:18:48,089 --> 01:18:48,957
IN THE END, REAL MONEY MATTERS

1754
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:52,894
AND ECONOMICS MATTER.

1755
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:53,695
IN THE EVENT WE HAVE A MODERATE

1756
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,998
LEVEL OF GROWTH AND A MODERATE

1757
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:58,800
LEVEL OF INFLATION, SOMETHING

1758
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,668
LIKE GREXIT AND A CREDIT CONCERN

1759
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:03,705
IN CHINA WILL NOT BLOW UP THE

1760
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:04,272
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

1761
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,841
IN THE LONG RUN, IT WILL BE THE

1762
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:10,212
FUNDAMENTALS THAT MATTER.

1763
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:10,912
STARLET: VOLATILITY AND

1764
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,881
LIQUIDITY AND ECONOMICS.

1765
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:17,018
THERE IS TALK THAT TALKS ARE

1766
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:22,123
HIGHER, CLOSE TO MILLENNIAL

1767
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:23,592
HIGHS.

1768
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,292
HOW DO YOU REACH THAT?

1769
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,093
IS AN INDICATION INVESTORS ARE

1770
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:29,064
PRICING IN?

1771
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:32,233
>> I DO NOT THINK IT IS

1772
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:33,001
NECESSARILY A RECESSION BUT IT

1773
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:33,835
IS PRUDENT IN MARKETS WHERE YOU

1774
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,103
HAVE HAD SOME SPREAD

1775
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,139
COMPRESSION, TWO OR THREE WEEKS

1776
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:41,142
AGO, THE VIX WAS AT 13 AND YOU

1777
01:19:41,142 --> 01:19:41,776
HAD 21 THE OTHER DAY.

1778
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:43,044
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CASH LEVELS

1779
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:44,346
REFLECTING LIQUIDITY BUT YOU

1780
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:45,847
THINK PRICING EVALUATION MAKES

1781
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:49,217
GOOD SENSE TO BE RUNNING HIGHER

1782
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:53,021
THAN AVERAGE CASH LEVELS IN

1783
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,422
THESE MARKETS, ABSOLUTELY.

1784
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,558
>> I WOULD AGREE 100% PURITY IF

1785
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,559
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

1786
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,594
THE CREDIT MARKETS, THEY ARE

1787
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:00,362
PERFORMED INCREDIBLY WELL

1788
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:03,598
BECAUSE RATES ARE NEGATIVE

1789
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:04,633
EVERYWHERE ELSE AND RATES IN THE

1790
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,300
U.S. ARE POSITIVE.

1791
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,203
OUR VIEW IS THAT THERE IS RISK

1792
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:12,474
IN THE ECONOMY.

1793
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:18,146
AND YOU LOOK AT THE PERSPECTIVE.

1794
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,014
>> THE FED SEEMS TO BE ON A HOLD

1795
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:19,814
FOR QUITE SOME TIME HERE AND I

1796
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:23,718
WILL ASK YOU AND I WILL AT --

1797
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:24,586
ASK RICH, ARE YOU GETTING TO THE

1798
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,722
POINT WHERE CACHES UNACCEPTABLE

1799
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:28,189
SUBSTITUTES?

1800
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:29,457
IS THE FED DISTORTED THE MARKET

1801
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:30,558
SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE DO NOT NEED

1802
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:34,962
TO BUY ASSETS?

1803
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:37,999
>> THE DEBATE AROUND GENERATING

1804
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:38,800
POSITIVE RETURNS FOR INVESTORS

1805
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,467
WILL BECOME A BIGGER AND A

1806
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:40,268
BIGGER ISSUE HERE AT A BIG ISSUE

1807
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,703
IN EUROPE AND JAPAN, AND WITH

1808
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:45,940
RATES SO LOW IN THE U.S., IT HAS

1809
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:46,508
BECOME BIG HERE.

1810
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,710
IN THE EVENT THE FED IS MORE

1811
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:52,447
DOVISH AND WE WILL BE IN A

1812
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,349
SLOWER GROWTH ENVIRONMENT BUT A

1813
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,150
LOW RISK OF RECESSION, YOU WILL

1814
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,551
SEE MORE AND MORE MONEY COME TO

1815
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:59,020
THE MARKET TO GENERATE POSITIVE

1816
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,487
YIELDS.

1817
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,823
YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH

1818
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:02,590
DIRECT ECONOMIC RISK BUT STILL

1819
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,959
TRY TO FIND HIGH-QUALITY WAYS TO

1820
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:05,961
GENERATE RETURNS.

1821
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:11,566
>> ARE WE GETTING TO A POINT NOW

1822
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:12,267
WHERE MARKETS ARE STILL

1823
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,068
DISTORTED AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO

1824
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:14,969
BUY A NEGATIVE RATE INSTRUMENT

1825
01:21:14,969 --> 01:21:15,737
BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT TO PAY TO

1826
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,107
GET IT, IS THE SAFETY NOT WORTH

1827
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,242
IT?

1828
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,845
>> EXACTLY.

1829
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:24,579
NEGATIVE RATES, WE HAVE

1830
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:25,380
THANKFULLY AVOIDED THAT IN THE

1831
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,515
U.S. 

1832
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:28,349
NEGATIVE RATES ARE A DISTORTION

1833
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:33,254
AND WE REFERRED TO THIS OF THE

1834
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:35,523
WORLD OF INSECURE STABILITY.

1835
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:36,324
THE WORLD APPEARS TO BE STABLE

1836
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,293
BUT THAT IS DECEPTIVE.

1837
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,695
IN THAT WORLD, IT MAKES SENSE TO

1838
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:41,429
FOCUS AS MUCH ON PRESERVING

1839
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:42,330
CAPITAL AS IT DOES TO DESERVING

1840
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:47,101
ON CAPITAL.

1841
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:47,936
TO RETURN UNDER CAPITAL IN THIS

1842
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:48,736
WORLD, I THINK THAT SHOULD GUIDE

1843
01:21:48,736 --> 01:21:52,873
INVESTING.

1844
01:21:52,873 --> 01:22:00,381
>> AS WE GO TO ASIA, IF I LOOK

1845
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:01,116
AT EUROPEAN BANKS, THEY ARE

1846
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:05,220
PERFORMING MISERABLY.

1847
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,020
DO YOU SEE LIQUIDITY IN THE

1848
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:06,754
EUROPEAN MARKET OFF OF THIS

1849
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:11,059
MEETING -- ECONOMIC MUMBO-JUMBO

1850
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:14,529
THAT WILL ALLOW THESE BANKS TO

1851
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:15,263
TRY TO SHIELD THEMSELVES AS

1852
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,698
GOLDMAN SACHS AND AMERICAN BANKS

1853
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:21,803
SHIELD THEMSELVES YEARS AGO?

1854
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:24,172
IS THERE A TRADING STABILITY

1855
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:24,939
WHEN YOU LOOK OUT OF NEW YORK

1856
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:27,242
AND OUT OF LONDON?

1857
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:28,076
>> THERE IS VERY LIMITED CREDIT

1858
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,245
CREATION GOING ON IN EUROPE

1859
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,913
BECAUSE OF THE CAPITAL

1860
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:32,647
CHALLENGES OF THE BANKS.

1861
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:36,251
UNLESS THE BANKS IN THE

1862
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,118
COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT A LOT OF

1863
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,487
THESE BANKS BY THE BULLET AND

1864
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,489
DECIDE TO RECAPITALIZE THE

1865
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,690
BANKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION

1866
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:44,859
WHERE WE CONTINUE TO SEE LOW

1867
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:45,693
LEVELS OF GROWTH AND POTENTIALLY

1868
01:22:45,693 --> 01:22:46,261
DEFLATION IN EUROPE.

1869
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,897
TOM: I GO BACK TO YOUR SKILL SET

1870
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:52,100
IN THE TRENCHES HERE.

1871
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,335
THE BASIC IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO

1872
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:55,103
COMPETE WITH MARIO DRAGHI FOR

1873
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,272
PAPER, AM I RIGHT THAT THAT IS

1874
01:22:57,272 --> 01:23:00,442
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

1875
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,877
>> YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY PRICING

1876
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:03,711
THE BANKS OUT OF A HIGH-QUALITY

1877
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:04,379
MARKET HERE WHEN THE BANKS

1878
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:08,016
GENERATE EARNINGS, THEY WILL

1879
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,717
RELY ON MORE RISK HERE THE

1880
01:23:09,717 --> 01:23:10,518
PROBLEM IS IT IS A VICIOUS CYCLE

1881
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:11,286
GOING ON IN EUROPE.

1882
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:16,090
WITH CONTINUED SLOW GROWTH,

1883
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:18,626
THERE'S TOO MUCH CONCERN ABOUT

1884
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:19,561
REGULATION AND POLITICAL RISK IN

1885
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:19,994
EUROPE.

1886
01:23:19,994 --> 01:23:22,630
YOU'RE FINDING COMPANIES ARE NOT

1887
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:26,668
EXTENDING.

1888
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,535
TOM: IT IS GREAT TO SEE MIKE IN

1889
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:31,006
THE TRENCHES.

1890
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:31,806
VERSUS FIRST-CLASS FLYING AT

1891
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:32,407
50,000 FEET.

1892
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:38,613
SCARLET: NOT A BAD PLACE TO BE.

1893
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:39,380
LET'S LOOK AT DOLLAR YEN.

1894
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:42,450
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON IT.

1895
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,619
AS LOW AS 105 643 AGAINST THE

1896
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,888
JAPANESE YEN.

1897
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:47,722
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN FOR THE DOLLAR

1898
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,591
VERSUS THE YEN.

1899
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:53,528
THE DOLLAR YEN WAS WET -- WAS AT

1900
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,430
187 AND BEFORE APRIL, 11131.

1901
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,699
>> WE ARE ALL FRIENDS HERE.

1902
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:11,078
I WILL CALL AN AUDIBLE.

1903
01:24:11,078 --> 01:24:15,750
>> THAT IS TRICKY.

1904
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,719
PROBABLY BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY

1905
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,021
HAVE LEARNED IN THE PAST AND ARE

1906
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:24,959
NOT INTERVENING.

1907
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:27,862
OBVIOUSLY, THEY WILL WEAKEN THE

1908
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:30,265
NP OR MY GUT TELLS ME IF WE ARE

1909
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:31,132
AT 100 OR THROUGH IT, THAT WOULD

1910
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:31,833
BE A MAGIC NUMBER THAT WOULD

1911
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,835
PROBABLY TRIGGER SOME

1912
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:37,305
INTERVENTION.

1913
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:38,072
IT WOULD BE THE MINISTER OF

1914
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:43,511
FINANCE.

1915
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,379
>> SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND IS

1916
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:45,880
THE U.S. TREASURY HAS BEEN TERM

1917
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,082
IN SAYING DO NOT DO THAT.

1918
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:52,220
HOW FAR WILL THEY LET THEM GO?

1919
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:59,760
IN THE PAST, WE HAVE COOPERATED.

1920
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,561
DOES THE REST OF G7 LET JAPAN

1921
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:03,331
JUST GO DOWN THE TUBES?

1922
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,400
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIPLOMATIC

1923
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,502
LANGUAGE, THERE IS ALWAYS

1924
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:11,306
VOLATILITY AND UNSTABLE MARKETS.

1925
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,608
NOBODY KNOWS THAT.

1926
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:14,509
IF YOU MOVE AT 122 NOT TOO LONG

1927
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:19,380
AGO, IT IS A BRUTAL MOVE.

1928
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,649
AGAIN, IT WOULD NOT SHOCK ME.

1929
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:22,483
UNDERSTAND WE SEE THAT LEVEL BUT

1930
01:25:22,483 --> 01:25:25,486
IF WE DO, IT WILL NOT CHECK ME

1931
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:26,321
IF WE SAW SOME INTERVENTION.

1932
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:31,426
TOM: IDENTIFYING THE YEN TO ONE

1933
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:32,560
OF 561.

1934
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,562
IT IS REMARKABLE.

1935
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:37,499
IT IS A TWO YEAR YIELD.

1936
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:42,804
WHILE OUTSIDE TWO STANDARD

1937
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,238
DEVIATIONS, IS JANET YELLEN

1938
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:46,607
LOSING CONTROL OF HER MANAGEMENT

1939
01:25:46,607 --> 01:25:50,445
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

1940
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,814
>> I DO NOT THINK SO.

1941
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:53,548
IF I HAD TO LOOK AT A SINGLE

1942
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,415
PIECE OF NEWS AND DID NOT HAVE

1943
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:58,386
THE BENEFIT OF READING THE

1944
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:03,057
REPORT, THE KEY POINT IS SIX

1945
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:05,226
MEMBERS OF THE FED DECIDED TO

1946
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,027
MOVE THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF TWO

1947
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:08,763
INCREASES IN 2016 21.

1948
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:09,597
WE THINK ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS

1949
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:10,264
CHAIR YELLEN.

1950
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:14,402
WE ACTUALLY THINK THE

1951
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:15,103
PROBABILITY OF TWO HIKES,

1952
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:20,508
ALTHOUGH -- IT HAS GONE DOWN.

1953
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,242
IT WILL IMPACT THE TWO YEAR.

1954
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:22,810
THE 10 YEAR WILL BE MUCH MORE

1955
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,812
RELEVANT TO THE FUTURE PATH FOR

1956
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:29,117
RATES.

1957
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:29,917
SCARLET: BEFORE WE LET YOU GO,

1958
01:26:29,917 --> 01:26:32,353
WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU

1959
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,955
WANT TO HEAR FROM JANET YELLEN

1960
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:35,757
IN HER NEWS CONFERENCE?

1961
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:39,961
>> IT IS VERY MUCH A GLASS IS

1962
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:40,595
HALF-EMPTY STATEMENT.

1963
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:41,362
I WILL LOOK FOR JANET YELLEN TO

1964
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,631
INDICATE SOME POSITIVE.

1965
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,034
IT IS A VERY DOVISH STATEMENT.

1966
01:26:47,034 --> 01:26:47,869
WE WILL SEE IF SHE TRIES TO

1967
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:52,206
CREATE A TWO-WAY READ OF HER

1968
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:52,974
INTENTIONS OR IF SHE TRIES TO

1969
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:56,377
REINFORCE THE DOVISH STATEMENT?

1970
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:57,178
>> I FIGURE YOU WILL SEE A

1971
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,414
LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFYING BALLOTS

1972
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:03,584
TO OFFSET A LITTLE BIT OF

1973
01:27:03,584 --> 01:27:04,519
DOVISH.

1974
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:05,353
>> THE MARKET IS REALLY TAKING

1975
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,922
IT AS A DOVISH MOVE.

1976
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,993
>> IT WILL BE RELIANT UPON THE

1977
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:12,360
DATA.

1978
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,161
WE ARE SPENDING A LITTLE BIT TOO

1979
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:14,929
MUCH TIME.

1980
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:20,902
>> WE WANT TO THANK RICHARD OF

1981
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:21,302
PIMCO.

1982
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:22,737
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

1983
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:28,342
LET'S GET A DATA CHECK.

1984
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:30,445
WE NEED TO BE REMINDED TO CHECK

1985
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:32,380
THE 10 YEAR YIELD AS WELL.

1986
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,281
MOVING DRAMATICALLY AFTER THIS

1987
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:36,184
STATEMENT.

1988
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:40,121
TOM: MICHAEL MCKEE NOW THE

1989
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:40,888
VOLATILITY HERE AND WHAT IT

1990
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:44,359
WOULD MEAN FOR THE MARKETS.

1991
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,660
I SUGGEST THE PRESS CONFERENCE

1992
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:46,527
WOULD BE THE MOST INTERESTING.

1993
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:51,398
I THINK YOU CAN SAY IT.

1994
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:55,770
MICHAEL: THIS IS NOT THE FED

1995
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,137
FUNDS.

1996
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:56,938
HE CAN SEE THE TWO-YEAR TAKING

1997
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,640
OUT.

1998
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,376
TWO MOVES THIS YEAR, 56 BASIS

1999
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:05,713
POINTS, ROUNDUP TO 57.

2000
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:06,581
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TRADING AROUND

2001
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:09,250
37 BASIS POINTS.

2002
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,985
YOU ARE NOT EVEN IN THE

2003
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:13,721
MID-POINT OF A MOVE UP.

2004
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,657
TOM COLE AND BLOOMBERG RADIO AS

2005
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,759
WELL, WORLDWIDE.

2006
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:18,693
OF COURSE ACROSS OUR MANY

2007
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:24,198
CHANNELS.

2008
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,700
INTERESTING AND SURPRISING

2009
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,671
ANNOUNCEMENT.

2010
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:32,740
YOU SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THESE

2011
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:37,678
DOVISH -- JANET YELLEN.

2012
01:28:37,678 --> 01:28:38,479
>> YOU THINK THERE IS A SHIFT IN

2013
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,715
THE FORECAST, AND THAT IS THE

2014
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:46,320
NEWS HERE.

2015
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,054
>> IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO

2016
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:49,657
MARKDOWN HIS VIEW OF GDP OFF OF

2017
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:53,628
WHAT WE HEARD TODAY?

2018
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,428
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM

2019
01:28:54,428 --> 01:28:57,131
THAT QUESTION.

2020
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:57,932
>> WE DID NOT HAVE A DISSENT

2021
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:00,802
THIS TIME.

2022
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:03,104
GEORGE FROM THE KANSAS CITY FED

2023
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,907
WENT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.

2024
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,209
SHE IS PROBABLY HIGHER ON THE

2025
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:08,576
LIST.

2026
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:09,343
HAS BEEN ARGUING THE FED WOULD

2027
01:29:09,343 --> 01:29:09,877
RACE RATE.

2028
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:13,114
SCARLET: DOES IT MATTER AMONG

2029
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,015
FED OFFICIALS?

2030
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:17,819
>> NOT AT ALL.

2031
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,954
THE FED IS NOT THE NEWS HERE.

2032
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:22,490
>> WHAT IS THE NEWS?

2033
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,324
>> THE NEWS IS THE JOB NUMBER,

2034
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:23,925
IS IT REAL OR NOT.

2035
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:31,498
WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

2036
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:33,234
>> DECADES WORKING IN FIXED

2037
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:34,435
INCOME, IS THE NEWS THAT WE ARE

2038
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:35,236
IN A GREAT DISTORTION, NEAR

2039
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:37,805
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, WHERE

2040
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:39,107
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO, IS IT

2041
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:43,344
TRUE?

2042
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:44,211
>> IT IS A RISK THAT THE ISSUES

2043
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:49,584
OCCURRING IN JAPAN AND OCCURRING

2044
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:50,384
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE HAVING

2045
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:50,918
A SIGNIFICANT AND

2046
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:52,553
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT.

2047
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:53,421
THAT OUR ECONOMIC MODEL HAS EVER

2048
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,556
FULL US.

2049
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:56,290
TOM: CAN I ASK YOU A DUMB

2050
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:59,193
QUESTION?

2051
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,963
DO YOU MAKE MONEY WHEN YOU TRADE

2052
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,232
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE PAPER?

2053
01:30:05,232 --> 01:30:07,201
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION YOU CAN.

2054
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:09,570
YOU CAN MAKE MONEY IN THE EVENT

2055
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,239
THAT RATES WILL RISE.

2056
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,807
TOM: HE LIGHTS UP.

2057
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:15,343
THAT IS AMAZING.

2058
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:18,179
>> WE LIKE TO MAKE MONEY.

2059
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:19,347
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE THAT MAKING

2060
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:23,851
MONEY OWNING GERMAN BONDS.

2061
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:24,485
WE ACTUALLY OWN THEM.

2062
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:25,252
THERE HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE RATES

2063
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:28,255
AND I THINK IT WILL BE A

2064
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:29,090
TERRIBLE EVENT BUT IN THE NEAR

2065
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,427
TERM, YOU SEE INFLATION.

2066
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,161
>> MY QUESTION THEN, CAN YOU

2067
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:39,734
TRADE OUT FAST ENOUGH TO KNOCK A

2068
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:40,134
KILLED?

2069
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:40,901
OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRAITS THAT

2070
01:30:40,901 --> 01:30:44,872
ARE BASED ON THIS?

2071
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:45,539
>> OF COURSE WE CAN.

2072
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:47,608
THE QUESTION IS PRICE.

2073
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,377
>> HAPPEN YOU HEDGE WHAT IT IS

2074
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:52,947
ON STERLING?

2075
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,682
>> THEY ARE INCREDIBLY

2076
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,852
CHALLENGED AND VERY RAPID MOVE

2077
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:58,653
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW

2078
01:30:58,653 --> 01:31:03,858
DAYS AND CHANGING EXPECTATIONS.

2079
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:04,392
VERY DIFFICULT.

2080
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:05,159
YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE

2081
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:07,495
MOST OF THE DIRECT WRIST -- RISK

2082
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:08,362
IS PRICED.

2083
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,698
ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE AT SUCH

2084
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:11,899
LOW REASONS WE

2085
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:13,200
ARE AT SUCH LOW LEVELS DESPITE

2086
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,337
THE NEWS TODAY IS YOU HAVE SEEN

2087
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:17,071
A LOT OF CAPITAL COMING OUT

2088
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,874
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN OF BREXIT

2089
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:20,508
BUYING TREASURIES.

2090
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:22,843
IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO MOVE,

2091
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:24,612
PEOPLE TO SOME DEGREE OVER STATE

2092
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:25,379
THE CHALLENGES IN THE MARKET.

2093
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:27,248
SCARLET: JANET YELLEN COMING UP

2094
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,584
TO THE PODIUM.

2095
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:30,384
THIS IS HER NEWS CONFERENCE

2096
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:33,387
FOLLOWING THE FED RATE DECISION.

2097
01:31:33,387 --> 01:31:37,525
LET'S GO TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

2098
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:38,359
WERE CHERRY YELLEN IS BEGINNING

2099
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:38,993
HER PREPARED REMARKS.

2100
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,696
CHAIR YELLEN: TODAY, THE FEDERAL

2101
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,496
OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE MAINTAIN

2102
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:45,232
THE FEDERAL RANGE AT 1.25 TO

2103
01:31:45,232 --> 01:31:48,636
1.5%.

2104
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,971
THIS ACCOMMODATIVE POLICY SHOULD

2105
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:51,772
SUPPORT FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARD

2106
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,240
OUR STATUTORY OBJECTIVES OF

2107
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,609
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE

2108
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:57,478
STABILITY.

2109
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,613
BASED ON ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, THE

2110
01:31:59,613 --> 01:32:00,515
COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO

2111
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,784
ANTICIPATE A GRADUAL INCREASES

2112
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:04,685
IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OVER

2113
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:08,556
TIME ARE LIKELY TO BE CONSISTENT

2114
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:09,223
WITH THE ACHIEVING AND

2115
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:11,459
MAINTAINING OUR OBJECTIVES.

2116
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,793
HOWEVER, RECENT ECONOMIC

2117
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:15,429
INDICATORS HAVE BEEN MIXED,

2118
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:18,265
SUGGESTING OUR CAUTIOUS APPROACH

2119
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:19,366
TO ADJUSTING MONETARY POLICY

2120
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:23,404
REMAINS APPROPRIATE.

2121
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:24,405
AS ALWAYS, OUR POLICY IS NOT ON

2122
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:27,708
A PRESET COURSE, AND IF THE

2123
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,810
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SHIPS, THE

2124
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:31,178
APPROPRIATE PATH OF POLICY WILL

2125
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:34,248
SHIFT CORRESPONDINGLY.

2126
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,050
I WILL COME BACK TO OUR POLICY

2127
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:39,019
DECISION, BUT FIRST, I WILL

2128
01:32:39,019 --> 01:32:39,653
REVIEW RECENT ECONOMIC

2129
01:32:39,653 --> 01:32:41,722
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OUTLOOK.

2130
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:44,058
ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY

2131
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,826
WEAK LATE LAST YEAR AND EARLY

2132
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:47,028
THIS YEAR.

2133
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:50,831
SOME OF THE FACTORS WEIGHING ON

2134
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:51,766
THIS WERE EXPECTED.

2135
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,201
FOR EXAMPLE, EXPORTS HAVE BEEN

2136
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,071
SOFT REFLECTING SOME DUDE

2137
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,074
FOREIGN DEMAND, AND THE EARLIER

2138
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:03,244
APPRECIATION OF THE DOLLAR.

2139
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:04,712
ACTIVITY IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

2140
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:08,015
HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN HIT BY THIS

2141
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:11,252
DEEP DROP IN OIL PRICES SINCE

2142
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,454
MID-2014.

2143
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:14,288
THE SLOWDOWN IN OTHER PARTS OF

2144
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:17,925
THE ECONOMY WAS NOT EXPECTED.

2145
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,293
IN PARTICULAR, BUSINESS

2146
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:22,163
INVESTMENT OUTSIDE OF ENERGY WAS

2147
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,197
PARTICULARLY WEEK DURING THE

2148
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:26,233
WINTER, AND APPEARS TO HAVE

2149
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:29,637
REMAINED SO INTO THE SPRING.

2150
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:30,504
IN ADDITION, GROWTH IN HOUSEHOLD

2151
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,072
SPENDING SLOWED NOTICEABLY EARLY

2152
01:33:32,072 --> 01:33:35,476
IN THE YEAR, DESPITE SOLID

2153
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:39,547
INCREASES IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME,

2154
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:40,247
AS WELL AS RELATIVELY HIGH

2155
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:42,350
LEVELS OF CONSUMER SENTIMENT AND

2156
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:47,488
WEALTH.

2157
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,390
FORTUNATELY, THE FIRST QUARTER

2158
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,191
SLOWDOWN IN HOUSEHOLD SPENDING

2159
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,158
APPEARS TO BE TEMPORARY,

2160
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:53,728
INDICATORS THAT THE SECOND

2161
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:54,562
QUARTER HAVE SO FAR POINTED TO A

2162
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:56,497
SIZABLE REBOUND.

2163
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:59,266
THIS RECOVERY IS A KEY FACTOR

2164
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:00,434
SUPPORTING THE COMMITTEE'S

2165
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:04,872
EXPECTATIONS THAT OVERALL

2166
01:34:04,872 --> 01:34:05,706
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WILL EXPAND AT

2167
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:06,507
A MODERATE PACE OVER THE NEXT

2168
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:08,676
FEW YEARS.

2169
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:10,411
DESPITE LACKLUSTER ECONOMIC

2170
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:13,280
GROWTH, THE JOB MARKET CONTINUED

2171
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:18,486
TO IMPROVE EARLY IN THE YEAR.

2172
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,355
DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, JOB

2173
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:22,122
GAINS AVERAGED NEARLY 200,000

2174
01:34:22,122 --> 01:34:23,524
PER MONTH, JUST A BIT SLOWER

2175
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:24,992
THAN LAST YEAR'S PACE.

2176
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:27,228
AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HELD

2177
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:31,532
NEAR 5%, EVEN THOUGH NOTABLY

2178
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:32,266
MORE PEOPLE WERE ACTIVELY

2179
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:35,670
LOOKING FOR WORK.

2180
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,239
HOWEVER, MORE RECENTLY, THE PACE

2181
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,106
OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOR

2182
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:39,907
MARKET APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED

2183
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:41,976
MARKEDLY.

2184
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:42,843
JOB GAINS IN APRIL AND THEY ARE

2185
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:46,580
ESTIMATED TO HAVE AVERAGED ONLY

2186
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,183
ABOUT 80,000 PER MONTH.

2187
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,751
WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL

2188
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:54,989
TO 4.7% IN MAY, THAT DECLINE

2189
01:34:54,989 --> 01:34:57,091
OCCURRED BECAUSE FEWER PEOPLE

2190
01:34:57,091 --> 01:34:57,925
REPORTED THAT THEY WERE ACTIVELY

2191
01:34:57,925 --> 01:35:00,461
SEEKING WORK.

2192
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,029
A BROADER MEASURE OF

2193
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:04,165
UNEMPLOYMENT THAT INCLUDES

2194
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:04,932
INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT AND ARE

2195
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:08,702
AVAILABLE TO WORK BUT HAVE NOT

2196
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:11,005
SEARCHED RECENTLY, AS WELL AS

2197
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,740
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING PART-TIME

2198
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:15,676
BUT WOULD RATHER WORK FULL-TIME,

2199
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:17,078
HAS FLATTENED OUT.

2200
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:19,914
ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE, AVERAGE

2201
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:21,882
HOURLY EARNINGS INCREASED 2.5%

2202
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:24,785
OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS, A BIT

2203
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:27,855
FASTER THAN IN EARLIER YEARS,

2204
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:28,656
AND A WELCOME INDICATION THAT

2205
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:29,356
WAGE GROWTH MAY FINALLY BE

2206
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:30,157
PICKING UP.

2207
01:35:30,157 --> 01:35:33,027
ALTHOUGH RECENT LABOR MARKET

2208
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:37,298
DATA HAVE ON BALANCE BEEN

2209
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:38,065
DISAPPOINTING, IT IS IMPORTANT

2210
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:39,934
NOT TO OVERREACT TO ONE OR TWO

2211
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:42,136
MONTHLY READINGS.

2212
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:43,170
THE COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO

2213
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,205
EXPECT THAT THE LABOR MARKET

2214
01:35:45,205 --> 01:35:46,106
WILL STRENGTHEN FURTHER OVER THE

2215
01:35:46,106 --> 01:35:50,077
NEXT FEW YEARS.

2216
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:50,878
THAT SAID, WE WILL BE WATCHING

2217
01:35:50,878 --> 01:35:53,681
THE JOB MARKET CAREFULLY.

2218
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:56,250
ONGOING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND AN

2219
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,285
IMPROVING LABOR MARKET UNDERPIN

2220
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:01,088
OUR INFLATION OUTLOOK.

2221
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,423
OVERALL, CONSUMER PRICE

2222
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:04,325
INFLATION, AS MEASURED BY THE

2223
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:07,161
PRICE INDEX FOR PERSONAL

2224
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,263
CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES, WAS

2225
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:11,398
ABOUT 1% OF THE 12 MONTHS ENDING

2226
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:15,569
IN APRIL, STILL SHORT OF OUR 2%

2227
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:16,771
OBJECTIVE.

2228
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:17,638
MUCH OF THIS SHORTFALL CONTINUES

2229
01:36:17,638 --> 01:36:20,541
TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF

2230
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:21,275
EARLIER DECLINES IN ENERGY

2231
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:23,644
PRICES AND LOWER PRICES FOR

2232
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:27,982
IMPORTS.

2233
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:28,816
CORE INFLATION, WHICH EXCLUDES

2234
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,551
ENERGY AND FOOD PRICES, HAS BEEN

2235
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:33,220
RUNNING CLOSE TO 1.5%.

2236
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,456
AS THE TRANSITORY INFLUENCES

2237
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:38,192
HOLDING DOWN INCLUDE --

2238
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:39,793
INFLATION FADE, AND AS THE LABOR

2239
01:36:39,793 --> 01:36:40,627
MARKET STRENGTHENS FURTHER, THE

2240
01:36:40,627 --> 01:36:42,696
COMMITTEE EXPECTS INFLATION TO

2241
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:44,732
RISE TO 2% OVER THE NEXT TWO TO

2242
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:47,334
THREE YEARS.

2243
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:52,406
OUR INFLATION OUTLOOK ALSO RESTS

2244
01:36:52,406 --> 01:36:53,941
IMPORTANTLY ON OUR JUDGMENT THAT

2245
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:54,541
LONGER RUN INFLATION

2246
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:56,877
EXPECTATIONS REMAIN REASONABLY

2247
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:58,145
WELL ANCHORED.

2248
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:58,946
HOWEVER, WE CANNOT TAKE THIS

2249
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:05,286
ABILITY OF LONGER RAIN INFLATION

2250
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:06,020
EXPECTATIONS FOR GRANTED.

2251
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,922
WHILE MOST MEASURES OF INFLATION

2252
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:09,857
EXPECTATIONS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE

2253
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:12,426
ON BALANCE IN RECENT MONTHS,

2254
01:37:12,426 --> 01:37:14,628
FINANCIAL MARKET MEASURES OF

2255
01:37:14,628 --> 01:37:16,030
INFLATION COMPENSATION HAVE

2256
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:19,233
DECLINED.

2257
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:20,034
MOVEMENTS IN THESE INDICATORS

2258
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:23,837
REFLECT MANY FACTORS, AND

2259
01:37:23,837 --> 01:37:24,638
THEREFORE, MAY NOT PROVIDE AN

2260
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,673
ACCURATE READING ON CHANGES IN

2261
01:37:26,673 --> 01:37:27,841
THE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS THAT

2262
01:37:27,841 --> 01:37:30,044
ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR WAGES AND

2263
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:33,314
PRICES.

2264
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:34,081
NONETHELESS, IN CONSIDERING

2265
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:36,750
FUTURE POLICY DECISIONS, WE WILL

2266
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:39,520
CONTINUE TO CAREFULLY MONITOR

2267
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,754
ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PROGRESS

2268
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:43,123
TOWARD OUR INFLATION GOAL.

2269
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:45,926
LET ME NOW TURN TO THE

2270
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:49,963
INDIVIDUAL ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS

2271
01:37:49,963 --> 01:37:50,731
SUBMITTED TO THIS MEETING BY

2272
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:52,833
FOMC PARTICIPANTS.

2273
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,103
AS ALWAYS, EACH PARTICIPANT'S

2274
01:37:56,103 --> 01:37:56,904
PROJECTIONS ARE CONDITIONED ON

2275
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:59,239
HIS OR HER OWN VIEW OF

2276
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:01,008
APPROPRIATE MONETARY POLICY,

2277
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:04,345
WHICH IN TURN, DEPENDS ON EACH

2278
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:06,480
PERSONS ASSESSMENT OF THE

2279
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,314
MULTITUDE OF FACTORS THAT SHAPE

2280
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:08,882
THE OUTLOOK.

2281
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,250
PARTICIPANTS PROJECTIONS FOR

2282
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:14,221
GROWTH OF INFLATION ADJUSTED

2283
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,356
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ARE

2284
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:19,460
SLIGHTLY LOWER IN THE NEAR TERM

2285
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,294
THEN IN THE PROJECTIONS MADE FOR

2286
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:22,129
THE MARCH FOMC MEETING.

2287
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:24,465
THE MEDIAN GROWTH PROJECTION NOW

2288
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:28,535
REMAINS AT 2% THROUGH 2018, IN

2289
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:29,336
LINE WITH ITS ESTIMATED LONGER

2290
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:31,171
RUN RATE.

2291
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,840
THE MEDIAN PROJECTION FOR THE ON

2292
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,376
A PLUMMET RATE EDGES DOWN FROM

2293
01:38:36,376 --> 01:38:39,947
4.7% AT THE END OF THIS YEAR TO

2294
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:43,550
4.6% IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS,

2295
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,085
SOMEWHAT BELOW THE MEDIAN

2296
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:45,953
ASSESSMENT OF THE LONGER RUN

2297
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:51,392
NORMAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

2298
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:52,092
THE MEDIAN PATH OF THE

2299
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:52,826
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS LITTLE

2300
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:55,796
CHANGED FROM MARCH.

2301
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:56,964
FINALLY, THE MEDIAN INFLATION

2302
01:38:56,964 --> 01:39:00,100
PROJECTION STANDS AT 1.4% THIS

2303
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,604
YEAR, A BIT FIRMER THAN IN

2304
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:04,972
MARCH, AND THEN RISES TO 1.9%

2305
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:10,144
NEXT YEAR, AND 2% IN 2018.

2306
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:11,812
RETURNING TO MONETARY POLICY, AS

2307
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:15,115
I SAID, THE COMMITTEE MAINTAINS

2308
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:16,283
ITS TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL

2309
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:16,750
FUNDS RATE.

2310
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:20,020
THIS DECISION REFLECTS THE

2311
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:22,156
COMMITTEE'S CAREFUL APPROACH IN

2312
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:26,059
SETTING MONETARY POLICY,

2313
01:39:26,059 --> 01:39:27,227
PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE

2314
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:27,995
MIXED READINGS ON THE LABOR

2315
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:28,962
MARKET AND ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT

2316
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,965
I HAVE DISCUSSED, AS WELL AS

2317
01:39:31,965 --> 01:39:33,233
CONTINUING BELOW TARGET

2318
01:39:33,233 --> 01:39:36,069
INFLATION.

2319
01:39:36,069 --> 01:39:36,904
PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY IN RAISING

2320
01:39:36,904 --> 01:39:40,107
OUR INTEREST-RATE TARGET WILL

2321
01:39:40,107 --> 01:39:41,575
ALLOW US TO VERIFY THAT ECONOMIC

2322
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:43,310
GROWTH WILL RETURN TO A MODERATE

2323
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:48,815
PACE, THAT THE LABOR MARKET WILL

2324
01:39:48,815 --> 01:39:49,483
STRENGTHEN FURTHER, AND

2325
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:50,250
INFLATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

2326
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,387
PROGRESS TOWARD OUR 2% OBJECTIVE

2327
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:53,720
.

2328
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,421
CAUTION IS ALL THE MORE

2329
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:56,456
APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE SHORT-TERM

2330
01:39:56,456 --> 01:39:58,726
INTEREST RATES ARE STILL NEAR

2331
01:39:58,726 --> 01:39:59,493
ZERO, WHICH MEANS MONETARY

2332
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,495
POLICY CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY

2333
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:04,765
RESPOND TO SURPRISINGLY STRONG

2334
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:05,532
INFLATION PRESSURES IN THE

2335
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:11,972
FUTURE THAN TO A WEAKENING LABOR

2336
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:12,739
MARKET AND FALLING INFLATION.

2337
01:40:12,739 --> 01:40:13,574
ALTHOUGH THE FINANCIAL MARKET

2338
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:18,111
STRESSES THAT EMANATED ABROAD

2339
01:40:18,111 --> 01:40:19,780
THAT STARTED THIS YEAR HAVE

2340
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:20,547
EASED, VULNERABILITIES IN THE

2341
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:22,249
GLOBAL ECONOMY REMAIN.

2342
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:24,885
IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF

2343
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:26,720
SLUGGISH GLOBAL GROWTH, LOW

2344
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,456
INFLATION, AND ALREADY VERY

2345
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:31,358
ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY POLICY IN

2346
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,427
MANY ADVANCED ECONOMIES,

2347
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,295
INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS OF AND

2348
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:38,665
APPETITE FOR RISK, CAN CHANGE

2349
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:41,468
ABRUPTLY.

2350
01:40:41,468 --> 01:40:42,302
AS OUR STATEMENT NOTES, WE WILL

2351
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:47,107
CONTINUE TO CLOSELY -- MONITOR

2352
01:40:47,107 --> 01:40:47,808
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

2353
01:40:47,808 --> 01:40:49,176
DEVELOPMENTS.

2354
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:49,910
WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE

2355
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:53,914
EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY WILL

2356
01:40:53,914 --> 01:40:54,681
WARRANT ONLY GRADUAL INCREASES

2357
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:56,483
IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

2358
01:40:56,483 --> 01:40:57,684
WE EXPECT THE RATE TO REMAIN FOR

2359
01:40:57,684 --> 01:41:00,587
SOME TIME BELOW LEVELS THAT ARE

2360
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:01,788
ANTICIPATED TO PREVAIL IN THE

2361
01:41:01,788 --> 01:41:06,159
LONGER RUN BECAUSE HEADWINDS

2362
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:06,994
WEIGHING ON THE ECONOMY MEAN THE

2363
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:09,963
INTEREST RATE NEEDED TO KEEP THE

2364
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:11,031
ECONOMY OPERATING NEAR ITS

2365
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:14,268
POTENTIAL IS LOW BY HISTORICAL

2366
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:17,538
STANDARDS.

2367
01:41:17,538 --> 01:41:18,372
THESE HEADWINDS, WHICH INCLUDE

2368
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,874
DEVELOPMENTS ABROAD, SUBDUED

2369
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:23,210
HOUSEHOLD FORMATION, AND MEAGER

2370
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:25,012
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH COULD

2371
01:41:25,012 --> 01:41:29,550
PERSIST FOR SOME TIME.

2372
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:30,384
BUT IF THEY GRADUALLY FADE OVER

2373
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:34,888
THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AS WE EXPECT

2374
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:36,290
, THEN THE INTEREST RATE

2375
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,958
REQUIRED TO KEEP THE ECONOMY

2376
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:40,294
OPERATING AT AN EVEN KEEL SHOULD

2377
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:43,263
MOVE HIGHER AS WELL.

2378
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:48,435
THIS VIEW IS CONSISTENT WITH

2379
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:49,169
PARTICIPANTS PROJECTIONS OF

2380
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:51,204
APPROPRIATE MONETARY POLICY.

2381
01:41:51,204 --> 01:41:51,972
THE MEDIAN PROJECTION FOR THE

2382
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:53,240
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE RISES ONLY

2383
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,276
GRADUALLY TO 1.5% AT THE END OF

2384
01:41:56,276 --> 01:42:00,347
NEXT YEAR, AND 2.5% BY THE END

2385
01:42:00,347 --> 01:42:04,651
OF 2018, SOMEWHAT BELOW ITS

2386
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:05,552
ESTIMATED LONGER RUN NORMAL

2387
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:08,489
LEVEL.

2388
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:10,691
ALTHOUGH THE MEDIAN FEDERAL

2389
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:11,491
FUNDS RATE AT THE END OF THIS

2390
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:12,292
YEAR IS UNCHANGED FROM MARCH,

2391
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:15,362
THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS

2392
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:18,065
REVISED DOWN THEIR PROJECTIONS.

2393
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:20,634
42017 AND 2018, THE MEDIAN

2394
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:25,806
PROJECTION IS 1.25% TO 1.5

2395
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,374
PERCENTAGE POINTS BELOW MARCH,

2396
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:31,478
ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH THE 1.25

2397
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,080
PERCENTAGE POINT DOWNWARD

2398
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:33,914
REVISION MADE TO THE ESTIMATED

LONGER RUN LEVEL OF THE FEDERAL

2400
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:38,919
FUNDRAISER.

2401
01:42:38,919 --> 01:42:39,720
AS I HAVE NOTED ON.

2402
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:44,257
OCCASIONS, PARTICIPANTS

2403
01:42:44,257 --> 01:42:45,625
PROJECTIONS FOR THE FEDERAL

2404
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:47,060
FUNDS RATE, INCLUDING THE MEDIAN

2405
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:47,894
PATH, ARE NOT A FIXED PLAN FOR

2406
01:42:47,894 --> 01:42:50,831
FUTURE POLICY.

2407
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:55,402
POLICY IS NOT AN A PRESET CORE

2408
01:42:55,402 --> 01:42:55,869
-- COURSE.

2409
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:57,938
THESE FORECASTS REPRESENT

2410
01:42:57,938 --> 01:42:59,006
PARTICIPANTS INDIVIDUAL

2411
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:00,774
ASSESSMENTS OF APPROPRIATE

2412
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:02,843
POLICY, GIVEN THEIR PROJECTIONS

2413
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:05,645
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT,

2414
01:43:05,645 --> 01:43:08,849
INFLATION, AND OTHER FACTORS.

2415
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:11,351
HOWEVER, THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS

2416
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:14,855
INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, SO EACH

2417
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:19,226
PARTICIPANT'S ASSESSMENT OF

2418
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:19,993
APPROPRIATE POLICY IS ALSO

2419
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:20,660
NECESSARILY UNCERTAIN,

2420
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:24,064
ESPECIALLY AT LONGER TIME

2421
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:27,000
HORIZONS, AND WILL CHANGE IN

2422
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,701
RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE

2423
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:30,003
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND ASSOCIATED

2424
01:43:30,003 --> 01:43:32,839
RISKS.

2425
01:43:32,839 --> 01:43:33,607
FINALLY, THE COMMITTEE WILL

2426
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:38,011
CONTINUE ITS POLICY OF

2427
01:43:38,011 --> 01:43:38,745
REINVESTING PROCEEDS FROM

2428
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:40,981
MATURING TREASURY SECURITIES AND

2429
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:41,782
PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY

2430
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,183
DEBT AND MORTGAGE BACKED

2431
01:43:43,183 --> 01:43:44,918
SECURITIES.

2432
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:46,320
AS HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR POLICY

2433
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,021
STATEMENT, WE ANTICIPATE

2434
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:50,056
CONTINUING THIS POLICY UNTIL

2435
01:43:50,056 --> 01:43:53,160
NORMALIZATION OF THE LEVEL OF

2436
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,228
THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS WELL

2437
01:43:55,228 --> 01:43:56,463
UNDERWAY.

2438
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:59,065
MAINTAINING OUR SIZABLE HOLDINGS

2439
01:43:59,065 --> 01:44:02,035
LONGER-TERM SECURITIES SHOULD

2440
01:44:02,035 --> 01:44:04,171
HELP TO MAINTAIN ACCOMMODATIVE

2441
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:06,740
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND SHOULD

2442
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,607
REDUCE THE RISK THAT WE MAY HAVE

2443
01:44:07,607 --> 01:44:10,510
TO LOWER THE FEDERAL FUND RATE

2444
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:13,013
20, IN THE EVENT OF A FUTURE

2445
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:15,549
LARGE, ADVERSE SHOCK.

2446
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:16,683
THANK YOU.

2447
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:17,551
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR

2448
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:26,559
QUESTIONS.

2449
01:44:26,559 --> 01:44:32,899
>> ONE OF THE BIG UNCERTAINTIES

2450
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:33,700
HANGING OVER MARKETS IS THE VOTE

2451
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:34,468
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM NEXT WEEK.

2452
01:44:34,468 --> 01:44:36,169
HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR WAS THAT IN

2453
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:38,472
TODAY'S DECISION, RELATIVE TO

2454
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:44,511
THE QUESTIONS YOU ELUCIDATED

2455
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:45,879
ABOUT THE JOBS AND INFLATION

2456
01:44:45,879 --> 01:44:46,646
DATA, AND COULD YOU TALK ABOUT

2457
01:44:46,646 --> 01:44:49,749
THE CHANNELS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

2458
01:44:49,749 --> 01:44:51,384
THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A BREXIT

2459
01:44:51,384 --> 01:44:53,787
ON THE U.S. ECONOMY?

2460
01:44:53,787 --> 01:45:00,360
CHAIR YELLEN: WELL, BREXIT, THE

2461
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,895
UPCOMING DECISION ON WHETHER TO

2462
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:02,662
LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION, IS

2463
01:45:02,662 --> 01:45:03,530
SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED.

2464
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,499
I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY IT IS

2465
01:45:05,499 --> 01:45:07,768
ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT FACTORED

2466
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:12,672
INTO TODAY'S DECISIONS.

2467
01:45:12,672 --> 01:45:13,340
CLEARLY, THIS IS A VERY

2468
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:14,007
IMPORTANT DECISION FOR THE

2469
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:18,945
UNITED KINGDOM AND FOR EUROPE.

2470
01:45:18,945 --> 01:45:21,848
IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD HAVE

2471
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:24,684
CONSEQUENCES FOR ECONOMIC AND

2472
01:45:24,684 --> 01:45:26,820
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN GLOBAL

2473
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:31,158
FINANCIAL MARKETS.

2474
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:31,958
IF IT DOES SO, IT COULD HAVE

2475
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:34,694
CONSEQUENCES IN TURN FOR THE

2476
01:45:34,694 --> 01:45:36,730
U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK THAT WOULD

2477
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,999
BE A FACTOR IN DECIDING ON THE

2478
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:43,503
APPROPRIATE PATH OF POLICY.

2479
01:45:43,503 --> 01:45:44,271
IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE

2480
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:47,274
UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE DISCUSSED

2481
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:49,109
AND THAT FACTORED INTO TODAY'S

2482
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:56,082
DECISION.

2483
01:45:56,082 --> 01:46:02,756
>> THE FED'S OUTLOOK FOR RATES

2484
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:05,692
HAS BEEN COMING DOWN SHARPLY,

2485
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:07,227
BUT HAS BEEN COMING DOWN OVER

2486
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:08,028
TIME, ALMOST A FULL PERCENTAGE

2487
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,229
POINT IN SOME CASES, COMPARED TO

2488
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:10,163
A YEAR AGO.

2489
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:12,299
YET THE GDP OUTLOOK REMAINS THE

2490
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:13,433
SAME.

2491
01:46:13,433 --> 01:46:14,267
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST

2492
01:46:14,267 --> 01:46:17,938
QUARTER TO THE COMMITTEE'S

2493
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:19,206
OUTLOOK TO BRING DOWN RATE SO

2494
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:22,309
MUCH, NOW JUST 2.4%, AND FURTHER

2495
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:24,177
FROM THE LONG RUN THAN IT WAS IN

2496
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:26,346
THE PRIOR ESTIMATE THAT WAS OUT

2497
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:28,848
THERE.

2498
01:46:28,848 --> 01:46:30,717
HAS THERE BEEN A DRAMATIC CHANGE

2499
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:31,585
IN THE COMMITTEE'S VIEW ON THE

2500
01:46:31,585 --> 01:46:34,054
RELATIONSHIP OF GDP TO RATES,

2501
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:36,957
AND MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY

2502
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:38,692
THE FED KEEPS HAVING TO LOWER

2503
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:39,359
THE RATE AND GETTING THE

2504
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:39,859
FORECAST WRONG.

2505
01:46:39,859 --> 01:46:42,362
CHAIR YELLEN: AS I MENTIONED IN

2506
01:46:42,362 --> 01:46:45,432
MY OPENING REMARKS, THERE IS

2507
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:46,533
REALLY A GREAT DEAL OF

2508
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:49,569
UNCERTAINTY AROUND EACH

2509
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:54,007
INDIVIDUAL'S ASSESSMENT OF THE

2510
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:54,774
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RATES,

2511
01:46:54,774 --> 01:46:57,377
PARTICULARLY AS WE GO FURTHER

2512
01:46:57,377 --> 01:46:59,446
OUT IN THE FORECAST HORIZON, AND

2513
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:02,682
WHEN WE COME TO THE LONG-TERM.

2514
01:47:02,682 --> 01:47:05,652
I THINK WHAT WE CAN SEE, WHAT

2515
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:09,756
MANY STUDIES SHOW, IS THE

2516
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:15,662
SO-CALLED NEUTRAL RATE, MAINLY,

2517
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:18,498
THE LEVEL OF THE FED FUNDS RATE

2518
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:19,232
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

2519
01:47:19,232 --> 01:47:21,701
ECONOMY GROWING ROUGHLY AT

2520
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:22,469
TRENDS AND OPERATING AT FULL

2521
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:25,272
EMPLOYMENT.

2522
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:26,106
THAT RATE IS QUITE DEPRESSED BY

2523
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:26,773
HISTORICAL STANDARDS.

2524
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:30,677
MANY ESTIMATES WOULD PUT IT IN

2525
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:31,745
REAL OR INFLATION-ADJUSTED TERMS

2526
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:35,949
NEAR ZERO.

2527
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:38,852
THE PATH THAT YOU SEE IN THE DOT

2528
01:47:38,852 --> 01:47:40,854
PLOT FOR RATES OVER TIME IS

2529
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:43,390
IMPORTANTLY INFLUENCED.

2530
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:47,160
THERE IS A ACCOMMODATION.

2531
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:47,994
AS WE ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES, I

2532
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:52,732
THINK, MOST PARTICIPANTS FEEL

2533
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:53,533
THE ACCOMMODATION IN THE CURRENT

2534
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:54,834
STANCE OF POLICY NEEDS TO BE

2535
01:47:54,834 --> 01:47:59,306
GRADUALLY REMOVED.

2536
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,140
BUT A VERY IMPORTANT INFLUENCE

2537
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,777
IN THE OUT YEARS IS WHAT WILL

2538
01:48:03,777 --> 01:48:06,913
HAPPEN TO THAT NEUTRAL RATE THAT

2539
01:48:06,913 --> 01:48:07,614
WILL JUST KEEP THE ECONOMY

2540
01:48:07,614 --> 01:48:10,317
OPERATING ON AN EVEN KEEL.

2541
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:11,017
I HAVE OFTEN COME IN MY

2542
01:48:11,017 --> 01:48:12,786
STATEMENTS AND REMARKS, TALKED

2543
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:21,127
ABOUT HEADWINDS THAT REFLECT THE

2544
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:21,795
LINGERING AFFECTS OF THE

2545
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:22,362
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

2546
01:48:22,362 --> 01:48:25,165
TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE

2547
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:28,134
HEADWINDS, I THINK, MANY OF US

2548
01:48:28,134 --> 01:48:31,271
EXPECT THESE HEADWINDS WOULD

2549
01:48:31,271 --> 01:48:34,574
GRADUALLY DIMINISH OVER TIME.

2550
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:35,408
THAT IS A REASON WHY YOU SEE THE

2551
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:38,278
UPWARD PATH FOR RATES.

2552
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:40,313
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MORE

2553
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:41,047
LONG-LASTING OR PERSISTENT

2554
01:48:41,047 --> 01:48:42,048
FACTORS THAT MAY BE AT WORK THAT

2555
01:48:42,048 --> 01:48:47,454
ARE HOLDING DOWN THE LONGER RUN

2556
01:48:47,454 --> 01:48:48,321
LEVEL OF NEUTRAL RATES.

2557
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:52,659
FOR EXAMPLE, SLOW PRODUCTIVITY

2558
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:54,561
GROWTH, WHICH IS NOT JUST A U.S.

2559
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:56,329
PHENOMENON, BUT A GLOBAL

2560
01:48:56,329 --> 01:48:59,099
PHENOMENON.

2561
01:48:59,099 --> 01:49:00,800
OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A LOT OF

2562
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,568
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WILL

2563
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,003
HAPPEN TO PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH,

2564
01:49:04,003 --> 01:49:07,240
BUT PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH COULD

2565
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:08,475
STAY ALONG FOR SOME TIME.

2566
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:13,513
WE HAVE AN AGING SOCIETY IN MANY

2567
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:15,181
PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT COULD

2568
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:16,483
DEPRESS THIS NEUTRAL RATE.

2569
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:20,487
I THINK ALL OF US ARE INVOLVED

2570
01:49:20,487 --> 01:49:23,523
IN A PROCESS OF CONSTANTLY

2571
01:49:23,523 --> 01:49:26,392
REEVALUATING WHERE IS THAT

2572
01:49:26,392 --> 01:49:30,997
NEUTRAL RATE GOING.

2573
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:31,831
WHAT YOU SEE IS A DOWNWARD SHIFT

2574
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:34,167
IN THE ASSESSMENT OVERTIME IN

2575
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:37,570
THE SENSE THAT MAYBE MORE OF

2576
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:38,304
WHAT IS CAUSING THIS NEUTRAL

2577
01:49:38,304 --> 01:49:39,639
RICK TO BE LOW, ARE FACTORS THAT

2578
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:42,876
WILL NOT BE DISAPPEARING, BUT

2579
01:49:42,876 --> 01:49:44,711
WILL BE PART OF THE NEW NORMAL.

2580
01:49:44,711 --> 01:49:48,581
YOU STILL SEE AN ASSESSMENT THAT

2581
01:49:48,581 --> 01:49:49,916
THE NEUTRAL RATE WILL MOVE UP

2582
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:50,750
SOMEWHAT, BUT IT HAS BEEN COMING

2583
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,652
DOWN, AND I THINK IT CONTINUES

2584
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:57,057
TO BE MARKED LOWER.

2585
01:49:57,057 --> 01:50:02,995
AND IT IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.

2586
01:50:02,995 --> 01:50:08,434
>> THE MEDIAN PARTICIPANT

2587
01:50:08,434 --> 01:50:09,936
FORECAST FOR THE FED FUNDS ARE

2588
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:12,038
FOR 2017, 2018 CAME DOWN QUITE

2589
01:50:12,038 --> 01:50:12,572
DRAMATICALLY.

2590
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:15,875
THIS STANDS IN CONTRAST WITH THE

2591
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:18,378
2016 MEETING FORECAST.

2592
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:23,950
AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE WERE SIX

2593
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,785
PARTICIPANTS WHO SAW ONLY ONE

2594
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:28,955
RATE HIKE THIS YEAR.

2595
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:31,991
CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHAT IT WOULD

2596
01:50:31,991 --> 01:50:38,665
TAKE FOR TWO RATE INCREASES TO

2597
01:50:38,665 --> 01:50:40,066
BE THE LIKELY OR APPROPRIATE

2598
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:45,605
POLICY PATH?

2599
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:46,406
ABOUT THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN

2600
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:48,875
THE MEDIAN VIEW AND THE VIEW OF,

2601
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:50,143
SAY, THE VOTING MEMBERS OF THE

2602
01:50:50,143 --> 01:50:52,145
COMMITTEE -- IF THERE IS ONE, I

2603
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,213
SHOULD ADD.

2604
01:50:53,213 --> 01:50:58,585
CHAIR YELLEN: I AM NOT GOING TO

2605
01:50:58,585 --> 01:50:59,352
COMMENT ON PARTICIPANTS VERSUS

2606
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:02,288
VOTERS.

2607
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:05,325
YOU KNOW, MONETARY POLICY, THE

2608
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:12,699
COMMITTEE FEELS MONETARY POLICY,

2609
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:13,466
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVERAL

2610
01:51:13,466 --> 01:51:15,134
YEARS, WE SHOULD SHOW THE PUBLIC

2611
01:51:15,134 --> 01:51:15,869
OF THE VIEWS ARE OF ALL THE

2612
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:18,238
PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMMITTEE,

2613
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:21,374
ESPECIALLY GIVEN VOTING ROTATES

2614
01:51:21,374 --> 01:51:22,342
EVERY YEAR.

2615
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:28,715
THAT IS A DECISION WE MADE.

2616
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:29,582
BUT YOU ASKED ME WHAT IT WOULD

2617
01:51:29,582 --> 01:51:32,419
TAKE TO HAVE TWO INCREASES.

2618
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:35,388
THE COMMITTEE, AS A WHOLE, NEVER

2619
01:51:35,388 --> 01:51:39,359
DISCUSSES HOW MANY INCREASES WE

2620
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:40,126
SHOULD HAVE THIS YEAR OR NEXT

2621
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:40,493
YEAR.

2622
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:43,263
THAT IS NOT A DECISION WE ARE

2623
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:46,833
MAKING AS A COMMITTEE.

2624
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:47,634
WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON A

2625
01:51:47,634 --> 01:51:49,202
MEETING BY MEETING BASIS AND

2626
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:51,438
TRYING TO GIVE A SENSE TO THE

2627
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:54,808
PUBLIC OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING

2628
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:55,575
FOR AND WHAT THE BASIS OF A

2629
01:51:55,575 --> 01:51:59,579
DECISION WILL BE.

2630
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:03,249
AS I INDICATED, FIRST OF ALL,

2631
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:04,517
INTERNATIONAL UNCERTAINTIES LOOM

2632
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:05,018
LARGE HERE.

2633
01:52:05,018 --> 01:52:09,489
WE MENTIONED BREXIT, THE U.K.

2634
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:12,458
DECISION, OBVIOUSLY, HOW THAT

2635
01:52:12,458 --> 01:52:13,893
TURNS OUT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

2636
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:15,862
FACTOR INTO FUTURE DECISIONS.

2637
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:16,596
WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE

2638
01:52:16,596 --> 01:52:19,265
PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH

2639
01:52:19,265 --> 01:52:20,400
AND CONTINUED PROGRESS IN THE

2640
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:25,905
LABOR MARKET.

2641
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:27,607
THE FORECAST THAT YOU SEE IN THE

2642
01:52:27,607 --> 01:52:29,709
SCP AND STATEMENT INDICATES THE

2643
01:52:29,709 --> 01:52:32,211
COMMITTEE EXPECTS TO HAVE

2644
01:52:32,211 --> 01:52:35,715
MODERATE GROWTH, 2% GROWTH

2645
01:52:35,715 --> 01:52:38,518
SUGGESTS HEALTHY GROWTH FOR THE

2646
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:40,754
REST OF THE YEAR AND A PICKUP IN

2647
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:44,924
GROWTH FOR THE SECOND QUARTER.

2648
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:46,926
WE EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUING

2649
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:51,030
PROGRESS IN THE LABOR MARKET.

2650
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:51,831
WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

2651
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:56,703
GROWTH OUTLOOK, BECAUSE WE DID

2652
01:52:56,703 --> 01:52:57,503
SEE SLOWER GROWTH IN THE FOURTH

2653
01:52:57,503 --> 01:52:58,204
QUARTER AND IN THE FIRST

2654
01:52:58,204 --> 01:52:59,773
QUARTER.

2655
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:04,677
WITH RESPECT TO THE SLOWDOWN,

2656
01:53:04,677 --> 01:53:05,478
THAT SEEMED TO BE OUT OF LINE

2657
01:53:05,478 --> 01:53:06,045
WITH FUNDAMENTALS.

2658
01:53:06,045 --> 01:53:10,917
WE EXPECTED IT TO PICK UP AND WE

2659
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:11,718
HAVE SEEN GOOD EVIDENCE THAT IT

2660
01:53:11,718 --> 01:53:14,087
HAS PICKED UP.

2661
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:14,954
BUT NOW THE LABOR MARKET APPEARS

2662
01:53:14,954 --> 01:53:16,790
TO HAVE SLOWED DOWN.

2663
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:22,662
WE NEED TO ASSURE OURSELVES THAT

2664
01:53:22,662 --> 01:53:24,030
THE UNDERLYING MOMENTUM IN THE

2665
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:27,834
ECONOMY HAS NOT DIMINISHED.

2666
01:53:27,834 --> 01:53:30,503
AS I SAID, WE WILL BE CAREFULLY

2667
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:31,270
ASSESSING DATA ON THE LABOR

2668
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:37,076
MARKET TO MAKE SURE JOB GAINS

2669
01:53:37,076 --> 01:53:39,545
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH A

2670
01:53:39,545 --> 01:53:42,882
PACE SUFFICIENT TO RESULT IN

2671
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:43,716
FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE LABOR

2672
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:46,286
MARKET.

2673
01:53:46,286 --> 01:53:47,153
WE WILL BE WATCHING THE SPENDING

2674
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:50,056
DATA TO MAKE SURE GROWTH IS

2675
01:53:50,056 --> 01:53:50,823
PICKING UP IN LINE WITH OUR

2676
01:53:50,823 --> 01:53:52,158
EXPECTATIONS.

2677
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,328
OF COURSE, WITH RESPECT TO

2678
01:53:55,328 --> 01:53:56,129
INFLATION, WE ARE CONSTANTLY

2679
01:53:56,129 --> 01:53:56,829
EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT

2680
01:53:56,829 --> 01:54:01,000
INCOMING INFORMATION IS ROUGHLY

2681
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,369
IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS.

2682
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:04,237
SO WE WILL BE EVALUATING THAT AT

2683
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:06,105
EVERY MEETING.

2684
01:54:06,105 --> 01:54:08,941
EVERY MEETING IS LIVE.

2685
01:54:08,941 --> 01:54:10,176
WE COULD MAKE A DECISION AT ANY

2686
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:15,014
MEETING TO ADJUST THE FUNDS RATE

2687
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:15,348
.

2688
01:54:15,348 --> 01:54:16,115
THAT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT

2689
01:54:16,115 --> 01:54:17,183
WE WILL WANT TO SEE TO MAKE SUCH

2690
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,019
DECISIONS.

2691
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:26,893
>> THE FED CREATED A LABOR

2692
01:54:26,893 --> 01:54:28,194
MARKET CONDITIONS INDEX FOR

2693
01:54:28,194 --> 01:54:29,729
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT WAS

2694
01:54:29,729 --> 01:54:30,563
DESIGNED TO BRING TOGETHER A LOT

2695
01:54:30,563 --> 01:54:32,632
OF THESE FACTORS.

2696
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:33,499
I AM SURE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT

2697
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:35,301
HAS BEEN FALLING SINCE JANUARY.

2698
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:37,437
THAT SUGGEST TO SOME PEOPLE THAT

2699
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:38,204
IT WAS YOUR DECISION TO RAISE

2700
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,673
RATES IN DECEMBER THAT HAS

2701
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:41,407
CAUSED THIS WEAKENING IN THE

2702
01:54:41,407 --> 01:54:42,375
LABOR MARKET.

2703
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,644
COULD YOU ADDRESS WHAT ROLE, IF

2704
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:45,411
ANY, THE FES DECISION TO RAISE

2705
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:47,280
RATES PLAYED IN THE SNOW AND WE

2706
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,147
ARE NOW SEEING?

2707
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:50,316
CHAIR YELLEN: LET ME SAY, THE

2708
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:54,420
LABOR MARKETS INDEX IS KIND OF

2709
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:58,424
AN EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCT THAT IS

2710
01:54:58,424 --> 01:54:59,158
A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MANY

2711
01:54:59,158 --> 01:55:00,593
DIFFERENT INDICATORS.

2712
01:55:00,593 --> 01:55:03,262
ESSENTIALLY, THAT MEASURE TRIES

2713
01:55:03,262 --> 01:55:05,598
TO ASSESS THE CHANGE IN LABOR

2714
01:55:05,598 --> 01:55:07,600
MARKET CONDITIONS.

2715
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:11,304
AS I LOOK AT IT, AS THE INDEX

2716
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:13,906
LOOKS AT THINGS, THE STATE OF

2717
01:55:13,906 --> 01:55:14,707
THE LABOR MARKET IS STILL

2718
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:18,377
HEALTHY, BUT THERE HAS BEEN

2719
01:55:18,377 --> 01:55:21,714
SOMETHING OF A LOSS OF MOMENTUM.

2720
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:25,718
THE 200,000 JOBS A MONTH WE SAW

2721
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:31,557
IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR

2722
01:55:31,557 --> 01:55:34,227
, THAT SLOWED IN RECENT MONTHS.

2723
01:55:34,227 --> 01:55:36,329
EXACTLY WHAT THE REASONS ARE FOR

2724
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:37,196
THAT SLOWING, IT IS DIFFICULT TO

2725
01:55:37,196 --> 01:55:41,234
SAY.

2726
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:42,068
AGAIN, WE SHOULD NEVER PAY TOO

2727
01:55:42,068 --> 01:55:44,804
MUCH ATTENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, TO

2728
01:55:44,804 --> 01:55:45,939
ONE JOB MARKET REPORT.

2729
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:50,209
WE OFTEN SEE LARGE REVISIONS.

2730
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:51,044
WE SHOULD NOT OVERLOAD THE

2731
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:57,583
SIGNIFICANCE OF ONE DATA POINT.

2732
01:55:57,583 --> 01:56:00,019
ESPECIALLY WHEN OTHER INDICATORS

2733
01:56:00,019 --> 01:56:02,021
IN THE MARKET ARE STILL FLASHING

2734
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:03,389
GREEN.

2735
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:04,257
INITIAL CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

2736
01:56:04,257 --> 01:56:06,192
INSURANCE REMAIN LOW.

2737
01:56:06,192 --> 01:56:09,795
PERCEPTIONS OF THE LABOR MARKET

2738
01:56:09,795 --> 01:56:12,231
REMAIN FINE.

2739
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:18,538
DATA FROM THE JOB OPENINGS

2740
01:56:18,538 --> 01:56:19,639
CONTINUES TO REACH NEW HIGHS.

2741
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:20,473
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF INCOMING

2742
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:25,345
DATA THAT DOES SIGNAL CONTINUED

2743
01:56:25,345 --> 01:56:27,446
PROGRESS AND STRENGTH IN THE

2744
01:56:27,446 --> 01:56:29,749
LABOR MARKET.

2745
01:56:29,749 --> 01:56:30,550
BUT AS I SAID, IT DOES BEAR

2746
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:32,652
WATCHING.

2747
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:33,486
THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT FEEL AND

2748
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:37,056
DOES NOT EXPECT, I DO NOT EXPECT

2749
01:56:37,056 --> 01:56:39,158
THAT LABOR MARKET PROGRESS HAS

2750
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:41,794
COME TO AN END.

2751
01:56:41,794 --> 01:56:42,662
WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE CLEAR TO

2752
01:56:42,662 --> 01:56:45,798
THE PUBLIC, AND THROUGH OUR

2753
01:56:45,798 --> 01:56:46,566
ACTIONS, AND THROUGH THE

2754
01:56:46,566 --> 01:56:51,304
REVISIONS YOU SEE OVER TIME IN

2755
01:56:51,304 --> 01:56:54,407
THE DOT PLOTS, WE DO NOT HAVE A

2756
01:56:54,407 --> 01:56:57,577
FIXED PLAN FOR RAISING RATES

2757
01:56:57,577 --> 01:56:58,845
OVER TIME.

2758
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,580
WE LOOK AT INCOMING DATA AND ARE

2759
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:02,648
PREPARED TO ADJUST OUR VIEWS TO

2760
01:57:02,648 --> 01:57:07,987
KEEP THE ECONOMY ON TRACK.

2761
01:57:07,987 --> 01:57:08,821
IN LIGHT OF THAT DATA DEPENDENCE

2762
01:57:08,821 --> 01:57:11,524
OF OUR POLICY, I REALLY DO NOT

2763
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:15,561
THINK A SINGLE RATE INCREASE OF

2764
01:57:15,561 --> 01:57:19,198
25 BASIS POINTS IN DECEMBER HAS

2765
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:22,668
HAD MUCH SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE

2766
01:57:22,668 --> 01:57:24,770
OUTLOOK, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO

2767
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,639
ADJUST OUR THINKING IN LIGHT OF

2768
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:29,508
INCOMING DATA IN WHATEVER

2769
01:57:29,508 --> 01:57:33,646
DIRECTION IS APPROPRIATE.

2770
01:57:33,646 --> 01:57:37,016
>> I WANT TO COME BACK TO THESE

2771
01:57:37,016 --> 01:57:38,884
LONGER RUN RATE REDUCTIONS YOU

2772
01:57:38,884 --> 01:57:41,754
HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT.

2773
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:44,190
YIELDS ON 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTES

2774
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,525
HAVE FALLEN BELOW 1.6%.

2775
01:57:46,525 --> 01:57:47,860
5-YEAR NOTE'S, NEAR 1%.

2776
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:52,832
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD, IN

2777
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:53,599
GERMANY AND JAPAN, LONG-TERM

2778
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,568
BOND YIELDS ARE NEGATIVE.

2779
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:57,570
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS LOW

2780
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,906
LEVEL OF LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS,

2781
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:03,476
AND DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY PAUSE

2782
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:04,844
IN LOOKING AT YOUR OWN

2783
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:06,646
PROJECTIONS, COMING TO A

2784
01:58:06,646 --> 01:58:09,582
CONCLUSION ABOUT WHETHER THOSE

2785
01:58:09,582 --> 01:58:10,416
PROJECTIONS ARE POSSIBLY STILL

2786
01:58:10,416 --> 01:58:12,718
WAY TOO HIGH, AND THE BOND

2787
01:58:12,718 --> 01:58:13,853
MARKET IS AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL?

2788
01:58:13,853 --> 01:58:17,790
CHAIR YELLEN: I THINK THE LEVELS

2789
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:21,594
OF LONGER-TERM RATES REFLECT

2790
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:24,463
ESSENTIALLY TWO THINGS.

2791
01:58:24,463 --> 01:58:27,667
ONE IS MARKET EXPECTATIONS ABOUT

2792
01:58:27,667 --> 01:58:30,636
THE PATH OF SHORT-TERM RATES, IF

2793
01:58:30,636 --> 01:58:32,705
WE ARE CONSIDERING A 10-YEAR

2794
01:58:32,705 --> 01:58:37,109
TREASURY SECURITY, WHAT WOULD BE

2795
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:37,877
THE PATH OF SHORT-TERM RATES

2796
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:39,178
OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS?

2797
01:58:39,178 --> 01:58:41,747
THE SECOND FACTOR IS THE

2798
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:45,151
SO-CALLED TERM PREMIUM, OR THE

2799
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:51,524
EXTRA YIELD THAT INVESTORS

2800
01:58:51,524 --> 01:58:52,224
DEMAND IN ORDER TO HOLD A

2801
01:58:52,224 --> 01:58:53,159
LONGER-TERM SECURITY, INSTEAD OF

2802
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:57,263
TO INVEST SHORT-TERM.

2803
01:58:57,263 --> 01:58:59,098
CLEARLY, MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR

2804
01:58:59,098 --> 01:59:01,367
THE PATH OF SHORT-TERM INTEREST

2805
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:04,737
RATES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS

2806
01:59:04,737 --> 01:59:08,574
REMAIN LOW.

2807
01:59:08,574 --> 01:59:09,375
THAT IS A FACTOR, THAT IS AN

2808
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:13,079
IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT, I THINK,

2809
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:14,180
HOLDING DOWN THE LEVEL OF

2810
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:16,249
LONGER-TERM YIELDS.

2811
01:59:16,249 --> 01:59:19,318
PERHAPS AS IMPORTANT, OR MAYBE

2812
01:59:19,318 --> 01:59:22,355
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, THE TERM

2813
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:25,658
PREMIUM IS ALSO LOW AND HAS ALSO

2814
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:30,062
PROBABLY COME DOWN.

2815
01:59:30,062 --> 01:59:30,930
WHEN WE ENGAGED IN LONGER-TERM

2816
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:34,200
ASSET PURCHASES, OUR VERY

2817
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:38,037
PURPOSE IN DOING THAT WAS TO

2818
01:59:38,037 --> 01:59:41,040
DRIVE DOWN LONGER-TERM YIELDS BY

2819
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:49,982
MAKING THESE ASSETS SCARCER,

2820
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:51,784
MORE VALUABLE TO THE PUBLIC THAT

2821
01:59:51,784 --> 01:59:52,585
WANTS TO INVEST IN LONGER-TERM

2822
01:59:52,585 --> 01:59:55,054
SECURITIES.

2823
01:59:55,054 --> 01:59:55,888
WE WERE CONSCIOUSLY ATTEMPTING

2824
01:59:55,888 --> 01:59:58,824
TO DRIVE DOWN THAT PREMIUM.

2825
01:59:58,824 --> 01:59:59,625
WE CONTINUE TO HOLD A LARGE

2826
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,527
QUANTITY OF THOSE SECURITIES,

2827
02:00:01,527 --> 02:00:02,595
BUT WE ARE NOT ADDING TO THEM.

2828
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:06,732
IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE

2829
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:07,600
ECB, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BANK OF

2830
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:10,202
JAPAN, ARE ALSO ENGAGING IN

2831
02:00:10,202 --> 02:00:12,505
QUANTITATIVE EASING, BUYING

2832
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:15,708
LONGER-TERM ASSETS, AND PUSHING

2833
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:16,642
DOWN THOSE TERM PREMIUM.

2834
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:21,881
I THINK THOSE ARE VERY LOW, AS

2835
02:00:21,881 --> 02:00:22,648
WELL AS THE EXPECTED PATH OF

2836
02:00:22,648 --> 02:00:23,082
SHORT RATES.

2837
02:00:23,082 --> 02:00:30,922
>> [INAUDIBLE]

2838
02:00:30,922 --> 02:00:36,462
>> I WANT TO SAY AGAIN, WE ARE

2839
02:00:36,462 --> 02:00:39,865
QUITE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHERE

2840
02:00:39,865 --> 02:00:40,933
RATES ARE HEADING IN THE

2841
02:00:40,933 --> 02:00:46,005
LONGER-TERM.

2842
02:00:46,005 --> 02:00:48,707
WE WRITE DOWN OUR BEST

2843
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:54,713
ESTIMATES.

2844
02:00:54,713 --> 02:00:55,514
AT THIS TIME, OF WHAT IS A

2845
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:56,282
LONGER THAN NORMAL RUN OF THE

2846
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:59,952
FEDERAL UNDERRATE -- FEDERAL

2847
02:00:59,952 --> 02:01:01,587
FUNDS RATE.

2848
02:01:01,587 --> 02:01:04,990
THERE IS GREAT UNCERTAINTY IN

2849
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:07,326
THAT NUMBER.

2850
02:01:07,326 --> 02:01:08,160
AS I SAID, WE HAVE GOOD REASON

2851
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:11,831
TO BELIEVE THIS SO-CALLED

2852
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:12,598
NEUTRAL RATE, RATE COMPATIBLE

2853
02:01:12,598 --> 02:01:13,966
WITH THE ECONOMY OPERATING AT

2854
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:16,869
FULL EMPLOYMENT IS LOW AT THE

2855
02:01:16,869 --> 02:01:21,173
PRESENT TIME.

2856
02:01:21,173 --> 02:01:25,878
MANY OF US BELIEVE AS A BASE

2857
02:01:25,878 --> 02:01:27,580
CASE IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME

2858
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:28,514
THOSE RATES WILL MOVE UP OVER

2859
02:01:28,514 --> 02:01:29,348
TIME, BUT WE ARE NOT CERTAIN OF

2860
02:01:29,348 --> 02:01:31,317
THAT.

2861
02:01:31,317 --> 02:01:34,787
IT IS ONE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES.

2862
02:01:34,787 --> 02:01:35,588
THERE COULD BE REVISIONS IN

2863
02:01:35,588 --> 02:01:36,389
EITHER DIRECTION.

2864
02:01:36,389 --> 02:01:46,565
THUS FAR, IN RECENT TIMES,

2865
02:01:46,565 --> 02:01:47,366
REVISIONS HAVE MAINLY BEEN IN A

2866
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:49,735
DOWNWARD DIRECTION.

2867
02:01:49,735 --> 02:01:51,904
THE IDEA THAT A LOAN NEUTRAL

2868
02:01:51,904 --> 02:01:52,738
RATE MAY BE CLOSER TO THE NEW

2869
02:01:52,738 --> 02:01:53,138
NORMAL.

2870
02:01:53,138 --> 02:01:56,175
BUT YOU DO STILL SEE SOME

2871
02:01:56,175 --> 02:01:57,943
REVERSIONS.

2872
02:01:57,943 --> 02:01:58,777
SO WE ARE REALLY QUITE UNCERTAIN

2873
02:01:58,777 --> 02:02:01,480
ABOUT THAT.

2874
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:06,886
>> IN YOUR SPEECH IN

2875
02:02:06,886 --> 02:02:07,620
PHILADELPHIA, YOU CALL THE

2876
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:08,654
SLOWDOWN IN JOB GROWTH LAST

2877
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:10,589
MONTH CONCERNING.

2878
02:02:10,589 --> 02:02:12,358
YOU MENTIONED TODAY THAT YOU

2879
02:02:12,358 --> 02:02:15,060
WANT TO VERIFY THE UNDERLYING

2880
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:15,794
MOMENTUM IN THE ECONOMY AND

2881
02:02:15,794 --> 02:02:17,129
LABOR MARKET IS CONTINUING.

2882
02:02:17,129 --> 02:02:17,863
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE TO

2883
02:02:17,863 --> 02:02:19,832
CONVINCE YOU THAT THE LABOR

2884
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:20,566
MARKET IS STILL MOVING TOWARD

2885
02:02:20,566 --> 02:02:21,800
FULL EMPLOYMENT, AND HOW LONG DO

2886
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:22,735
YOU SEE IT?

2887
02:02:22,735 --> 02:02:28,574
CHAIR YELLEN: I CANNOT GIVE YOU

2888
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:29,408
A FORMULA, I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD

2889
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:30,209
LIKE TO HAVE A NUMBER THAT IS A

2890
02:02:30,209 --> 02:02:31,877
CUT OFF FOR WHAT WE NEED TO SEE

2891
02:02:31,877 --> 02:02:34,980
IN A PARTICULAR REPORT.

2892
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,982
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

2893
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:38,684
INDICATORS OF THE LABOR MARKET.

2894
02:02:38,684 --> 02:02:41,787
FOR EXAMPLE, THE LABOR MARKET

2895
02:02:41,787 --> 02:02:47,526
CONDITIONS INDEX HAS 19

2896
02:02:47,526 --> 02:02:50,129
DIFFERENT INDICATORS.

2897
02:02:50,129 --> 02:02:50,963
CLEARLY, WE WILL BE LOOKING AT

2898
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:56,202
THE NEXT JOBS REPORT.

2899
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:57,069
IF WE WERE TO SEE A HEALTHY PACE

2900
02:02:57,069 --> 02:03:01,874
OF JOB GROWTH, ABOVE THAT NEEDED

2901
02:03:01,874 --> 02:03:04,109
TO KIND OF MAINTAIN THE STATUS

2902
02:03:04,109 --> 02:03:07,580
QUO IN THE LABOR MARKET.

2903
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:10,516
I SHOULD SAY, OVER TIME, WE

2904
02:03:10,516 --> 02:03:11,317
SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE, AS THE

2905
02:03:11,317 --> 02:03:15,254
ECONOMY COMES CLOSER TO MAXIMUM

2906
02:03:15,254 --> 02:03:17,423
EMPLOYMENT, THE LIKELY PACE OF

2907
02:03:17,423 --> 02:03:20,192
JOB GAINS IS PROBABLY GOING TO

2908
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:22,995
SLOW DOWN SOMEWHAT.

2909
02:03:22,995 --> 02:03:24,363
WE HAVE SEEN SOME SLOWING.

2910
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:25,898
BUT THE RECENT COUPLE OF MONTHS

2911
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:30,169
WAS VERY LOW, AND ARGUABLY NOT

2912
02:03:30,169 --> 02:03:30,970
EVEN AT THE PACE WE NEED TO SEE

2913
02:03:30,970 --> 02:03:34,373
TO MAINTAIN STABLE LABOR MARKET

2914
02:03:34,373 --> 02:03:36,675
CONDITIONS.

2915
02:03:36,675 --> 02:03:37,509
WE WANT TO SEE AN ADEQUATE PACE

2916
02:03:37,509 --> 02:03:39,712
OF JOB CREATION.

2917
02:03:39,712 --> 02:03:40,479
THERE MIGHT BE REVISIONS TO

2918
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:44,750
PREVIOUS MONTHS IF WE CHANGE OUR

2919
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:45,584
VIEWS, BUT THERE WILL BE OTHER

2920
02:03:45,584 --> 02:03:49,755
SURVEYS OF EMPLOYMENT INTENTIONS

2921
02:03:49,755 --> 02:03:51,457
, OTHER INDICATORS OF THE LABOR

2922
02:03:51,457 --> 02:03:53,592
MARKET THAT WE WILL BE FOCUSING

2923
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:55,828
ON.

2924
02:03:55,828 --> 02:03:57,830
THERE IS NO FORMULA FOR WHAT IT

2925
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:59,665
TAKES, BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT

2926
02:03:59,665 --> 02:04:04,503
THE LABOR MARKET.

2927
02:04:04,503 --> 02:04:09,908
>> ALSO IN PHILADELPHIA, YOU DID

2928
02:04:09,908 --> 02:04:12,911
NOT SAY THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY

2929
02:04:12,911 --> 02:04:13,679
BE APPROPRIATE FOR A RATE HIKE

2930
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:16,248
TO OCCUR IN THE COMING MONTHS.

2931
02:04:16,248 --> 02:04:17,750
DID YOU INTENTIONALLY LEAVE THAT

2932
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:19,718
OUT?

2933
02:04:19,718 --> 02:04:25,190
CHAIR YELLEN: YOU KNOW, WE DO

2934
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:25,891
NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS

2935
02:04:25,891 --> 02:04:26,492
SUFFICIENT MOMENTUM.

2936
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:27,326
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIMETABLE

2937
02:04:27,326 --> 02:04:30,496
WILL BE TO GAIN THAT ASSURANCE.

2938
02:04:30,496 --> 02:04:33,032
EVERY MEETING IS LIVE.

2939
02:04:33,032 --> 02:04:33,866
THERE IS NO MEETING THAT IS OFF

2940
02:04:33,866 --> 02:04:41,240
THE TABLE, THAT NO MEETING IS

2941
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:42,074
OUT, IN TERMS OF A POSSIBLE RATE

2942
02:04:42,074 --> 02:04:44,109
INCREASE.

2943
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:44,910
BUT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

2944
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:46,345
THE DATA.

2945
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:49,748
I CANNOT PRE-SPECIFY A

2946
02:04:49,748 --> 02:04:50,916
TIMETABLE.

2947
02:04:50,916 --> 02:04:54,820
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE TO SAY IT

2948
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:55,654
IS IN THE NEXT MEETING OR TWO,

2949
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:56,188
BUT IT COULD BE.

2950
02:04:56,188 --> 02:05:00,192
NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

2951
02:05:00,192 --> 02:05:00,993
IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT BY

2952
02:05:00,993 --> 02:05:05,397
JULY, FOR EXAMPLE, WE WOULD SEE

2953
02:05:05,397 --> 02:05:07,032
DATA THAT LEAD US TO BELIEVE

2954
02:05:07,032 --> 02:05:08,133
THAT WE ARE IN A PERFECTLY FINE

2955
02:05:08,133 --> 02:05:09,935
COURSE, AND THAT DATA WAS AN

2956
02:05:09,935 --> 02:05:11,837
ABERRATION AND OTHER CONCERNS IN

2957
02:05:11,837 --> 02:05:13,906
THE PAST.

2958
02:05:13,906 --> 02:05:20,312
>> WE ARE IN ELECTION SEASON.

2959
02:05:20,312 --> 02:05:21,080
IN THE PAST, THE FED HAS BEEN

2960
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,982
SENSITIVE TO MAKING POLICY

2961
02:05:23,982 --> 02:05:27,152
CHANGES IN ELECTION YEARS.

2962
02:05:27,152 --> 02:05:29,621
YOU HAVE THREE MORE MEETING

2963
02:05:29,621 --> 02:05:30,422
BEFORE THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL

2964
02:05:30,422 --> 02:05:31,557
ELECTION.

2965
02:05:31,557 --> 02:05:32,391
COULD YOU COMMENT ON WHETHER OR

2966
02:05:32,391 --> 02:05:34,226
NOT THE ELECTION WILL COME INTO

2967
02:05:34,226 --> 02:05:41,133
PLAY, AND ANY CONCERN THAT IF

2968
02:05:41,133 --> 02:05:42,234
YOU CHANGE POLICY AHEAD OF THE

2969
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:44,136
ELECTION -- BASED ON YOUR

2970
02:05:44,136 --> 02:05:45,971
FORECAST TODAY, YOU COULD -- ARE

2971
02:05:45,971 --> 02:05:50,843
YOU CONCERNED THAT THAT COULD

2972
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:51,677
LEAD TO CHARGES THAT THE FED IS

2973
02:05:51,677 --> 02:05:52,377
TRYING TO CHANGE POLICY TO

2974
02:05:52,377 --> 02:05:53,379
INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE

2975
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:56,649
ELECTION?

2976
02:05:56,649 --> 02:05:57,516
BECAUSE IF IT HAS BEEN SENSITIVE

2977
02:05:57,516 --> 02:05:59,285
TO THAT IN THE PAST.

2978
02:05:59,285 --> 02:06:04,590
CHAIR YELLEN: WE ARE VERY

2979
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:05,257
FOCUSED ON ASSESSING THE

2980
02:06:05,257 --> 02:06:06,258
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND MAKING

2981
02:06:06,258 --> 02:06:08,060
CHANGES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE

2982
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:11,430
WITHOUT TAKING POLITICS INTO

2983
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:13,365
ACCOUNT.

2984
02:06:13,365 --> 02:06:16,101
LOOK, IF THE INCOMING DATA WERE,

2985
02:06:16,101 --> 02:06:19,171
IN THE COMING MONTHS, TO JUSTIFY

2986
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:24,176
THE KIND OF GRADUAL INCREASES

2987
02:06:24,176 --> 02:06:26,178
THAT WE HAVE LONG DISCUSSED,

2988
02:06:26,178 --> 02:06:28,313
THAT WE SEE IS APPROPRIATE IN

2989
02:06:28,313 --> 02:06:33,752
LIGHT OF THE OUTLOOK, I THINK

2990
02:06:33,752 --> 02:06:34,586
MARKETS SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED

2991
02:06:34,586 --> 02:06:36,589
BY SUCH A DECISION, IF WE MAKE

2992
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,991
IT.

2993
02:06:38,991 --> 02:06:39,825
IT IS OBVIOUSLY CONSISTENT WITH

2994
02:06:39,825 --> 02:06:48,433
THE DATA WE HAVE SEEN AND THE

2995
02:06:48,433 --> 02:06:49,601
COMPANY WILL FEEL APPROVED --

2996
02:06:49,601 --> 02:06:50,302
FREE TO MOVE IN THE COMING

2997
02:06:50,302 --> 02:06:50,969
MONTHS IF APPROPRIATE.

2998
02:06:50,969 --> 02:06:56,241
>> YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR REMARKS

2999
02:06:56,241 --> 02:06:57,709
THAT WE ARE GETTING A SLIGHTLY

3000
02:06:57,709 --> 02:06:58,477
DIFFERENT SIGNAL WHEN YOU LOOK

3001
02:06:58,477 --> 02:06:59,678
AT INFLATION VERSUS INFLATION

3002
02:06:59,678 --> 02:07:00,179
EXPECTATIONS.

3003
02:07:00,179 --> 02:07:01,647
COULD YOU DETAIL WHICH YOU LOOK

3004
02:07:01,647 --> 02:07:07,987
AT AND WEIGHT MORE?

3005
02:07:07,987 --> 02:07:08,821
ARE YOU FOCUSING ON THE PICKUP

3006
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:09,788
IN INFLATION?

3007
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:12,724
CHAIR YELLEN: WE ARE LOOKING AT

3008
02:07:12,724 --> 02:07:14,994
BOTH.

3009
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:16,762
WITH RESPECT TO THE BEHAVIOR OF

3010
02:07:16,762 --> 02:07:22,734
INFLATION, INFLATION IS BEHAVING

3011
02:07:22,734 --> 02:07:23,502
ROUGHLY IN THE MANNER I WOULD

3012
02:07:23,502 --> 02:07:24,002
HAVE EXPECTED.

3013
02:07:24,002 --> 02:07:26,638
I WAS REALLY NOT SEEING

3014
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:27,840
SIGNIFICANT SURPRISES THERE.

3015
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,111
WE HAVE LONG SAID, AN IMPORTANT

3016
02:07:32,111 --> 02:07:32,978
REASON INFLATION IS AS LOW AS IT

3017
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:36,748
HAS BEEN, IS BECAUSE OF PAST

3018
02:07:36,748 --> 02:07:39,384
DECLINES IN ENERGY PRICES,

3019
02:07:39,384 --> 02:07:40,886
INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE

3020
02:07:40,886 --> 02:07:45,557
DOLLAR.

3021
02:07:45,557 --> 02:07:46,291
AS THOSE FACTORS BEGIN TO

3022
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:46,959
DISSIPATE, WE WOULD SEE

3023
02:07:46,959 --> 02:07:48,660
INFLATION MOVING UP.

3024
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:49,895
NOW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE

3025
02:07:49,895 --> 02:07:51,630
SEEING.

3026
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:52,331
THAT IS IN LINE WITH OUR

3027
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,966
THINKING AND WITH THE DATA.

3028
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:57,669
THOSE THINGS HAVE STABILIZED.

3029
02:07:57,669 --> 02:07:59,972
THEIR INFLUENCE IS DISSIPATING.

3030
02:07:59,972 --> 02:08:03,709
WITH RESPECT TO CORE INFLATION,

3031
02:08:03,709 --> 02:08:04,543
WHICH IS PARTLY INFLUENCED ALSO

3032
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:07,212
BY THE DOLLAR, MUCH WRONG TO

3033
02:08:07,212 --> 02:08:08,013
PULL OUT THE DOLLAR IN IMPORT

3034
02:08:08,013 --> 02:08:11,083
RICE INFLUENCE, CORE INFLATION

3035
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:13,986
SEEMS TO BE BEHAVING ROUGHLY AS

3036
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:17,089
ONE WOULD EXPECT WITH WELL

3037
02:08:17,089 --> 02:08:20,292
ANCHORED INFLATION EXPECTATIONS

3038
02:08:20,292 --> 02:08:22,094
AND AN IMPROVING LABOR MARKET.

3039
02:08:22,094 --> 02:08:26,665
SO I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING,

3040
02:08:26,665 --> 02:08:28,200
INFLATION, EVEN CORE INFLATION

3041
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,234
IS RUNNING UNDER 2%.

3042
02:08:29,234 --> 02:08:30,769
I CONTINUE TO THINK THE EVIDENCE

3043
02:08:30,769 --> 02:08:34,106
SUPPORTS A PROJECTION THAT IT

3044
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:34,806
WILL MOVE UP OVER THE NEXT

3045
02:08:34,806 --> 02:08:36,975
COUPLE OF YEARS BACK TOWARD OUR

3046
02:08:36,975 --> 02:08:40,312
2% OBJECTIVE.

3047
02:08:40,312 --> 02:08:44,216
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, AND

3048
02:08:44,216 --> 02:08:45,951
ECONOMIC THEORIES SUGGEST,

3049
02:08:45,951 --> 02:08:49,121
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE

3050
02:08:49,121 --> 02:08:49,821
RELEVANT TO PRICE AND WAGE

3051
02:08:49,821 --> 02:08:51,823
SETTING DECISIONS.

3052
02:08:51,823 --> 02:08:55,227
SO WE DO MONITOR INDICATORS OF

3053
02:08:55,227 --> 02:08:55,961
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS

3054
02:08:55,961 --> 02:08:58,664
CAREFULLY.

3055
02:08:58,664 --> 02:08:59,464
NOW, IT IS VERY HARD TO KNOW

3056
02:08:59,464 --> 02:09:01,500
EXACTLY WHAT INFLATION

3057
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,969
EXPECTATIONS ARE RELEVANT TO

3058
02:09:03,969 --> 02:09:08,240
ACTUAL PRICE AND WAGE DECISIONS.

3059
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,074
SO FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SEEN THE

3060
02:09:09,074 --> 02:09:11,209
MICHIGAN SURVEY, A MEASURE OF

3061
02:09:11,209 --> 02:09:13,545
HOUSEHOLD INFLATION,

3062
02:09:13,545 --> 02:09:18,183
EXPECTATIONS MOVE DOWN.

3063
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:20,085
THAT IS A PRELIMINARY NUMBER.

3064
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:20,919
IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO MAKE

3065
02:09:20,919 --> 02:09:21,954
OF IT.

3066
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:22,855
WE HAVE CERTAINLY TAKEN NOTE OF

3067
02:09:22,855 --> 02:09:25,758
IT.

3068
02:09:25,758 --> 02:09:29,728
BUT SURVEY-BASED MEASURES, WHERE

3069
02:09:29,728 --> 02:09:32,764
FORECASTERS WERE QUERIED, HAVE

3070
02:09:32,764 --> 02:09:33,932
ALL BEEN STABLE.

3071
02:09:33,932 --> 02:09:34,733
MEASURES OF INFLATION

3072
02:09:34,733 --> 02:09:37,502
COMPENSATION -- I ALWAYS BEEN

3073
02:09:37,502 --> 02:09:41,540
CAREFUL TO CALL IT COMPENSATION

3074
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:44,776
RATHER THAN EXPECTATIONS --

3075
02:09:44,776 --> 02:09:45,577
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INFLATION

3076
02:09:45,577 --> 02:09:47,146
EXPECTATIONS.

3077
02:09:47,146 --> 02:09:48,013
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS INFLUENCE

3078
02:09:48,013 --> 02:09:50,582
THOSE MARKET ENSURES, BUT THERE

3079
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:52,384
IS ALSO AN INFLATION RISK

3080
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,987
REVIEW.

3081
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:56,255
-- PREMIUM.

3082
02:09:56,255 --> 02:09:57,055
THERE IS GOOD REASON TO THINK

3083
02:09:57,055 --> 02:09:57,856
THE INFLATION RISK PREMIUM COULD

3084
02:09:57,856 --> 02:10:02,094
HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AND

3085
02:10:02,094 --> 02:10:02,928
MAYBE DEPRESSING THOSE NUMBERS.

3086
02:10:02,928 --> 02:10:05,797
SO WE WATCH THEM, WE HAVE TAKEN

3087
02:10:05,797 --> 02:10:07,866
NOTE IN THE STATEMENT THAT THEY

3088
02:10:07,866 --> 02:10:15,541
HAVE MOVED DOWN.

3089
02:10:15,541 --> 02:10:16,308
ACTUAL INFLATION IS BEHAVING

3090
02:10:16,308 --> 02:10:21,112
MORE OR LESS AS WE EXPECTED.

3091
02:10:21,112 --> 02:10:25,117
>> WENDY APRIL MINUTES WERE

3092
02:10:25,117 --> 02:10:27,252
RELEASED, THEY CAUGHT MARKETS BY

3093
02:10:27,252 --> 02:10:30,422
SURPRISE.

3094
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:31,256
THEY SEEM TO SHOW THERE WAS AN

3095
02:10:31,256 --> 02:10:33,158
ACTIVE DISCUSSION OF A POSSIBLE

3096
02:10:33,158 --> 02:10:37,162
JUNE RATE INCREASE, SOMETHING WE

3097
02:10:37,162 --> 02:10:38,630
HAD NOT GONE FROM THE POLICY

3098
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:39,464
STATEMENT THAT WAS ISSUED RIGHT

3099
02:10:39,464 --> 02:10:41,500
AFTER THE MEETING.

3100
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,367
WAS THAT A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO

3101
02:10:42,367 --> 02:10:46,004
HOLD BACK AND TELL US WHEN THE

3102
02:10:46,004 --> 02:10:47,439
MINUTES CAME OUT ABOUT THE JUNE

3103
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:51,910
DISCUSSION?

3104
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:52,677
IF SO, COULD YOU TELL US WHAT

3105
02:10:52,677 --> 02:10:53,445
SURPRISES WE COULD SEE IN THE

3106
02:10:53,445 --> 02:10:54,313
JUNE MINUTES?

3107
02:10:54,313 --> 02:11:01,553
CHAIR YELLEN: SO, THE MINUTES

3108
02:11:01,553 --> 02:11:02,354
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE AN ACCURATE

3109
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:03,121
DISCUSSION OF WHAT HAPPENED AT

3110
02:11:03,121 --> 02:11:04,590
THE MEETING.

3111
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:06,358
THEY ARE NOT CHANGED AFTER THE

3112
02:11:06,358 --> 02:11:09,561
FACT IN ORDER TO CORRECT

3113
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:10,495
POSSIBLE MISCONCEPTIONS.

3114
02:11:10,495 --> 02:11:12,998
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF

3115
02:11:12,998 --> 02:11:16,068
DISCUSSIONS THAT MEETING OF THE

3116
02:11:16,068 --> 02:11:19,137
POSSIBILITY OF MOVING IN JUNE.

3117
02:11:19,137 --> 02:11:23,141
THAT APPEARED IN THE MINUTES.

3118
02:11:23,141 --> 02:11:24,543
I SUPPOSE, IN THE APRIL

3119
02:11:24,543 --> 02:11:29,514
STATEMENT, WE GAVE NO OBVIOUS H

3120
02:11:29,514 --> 02:11:34,019
INT OR CALENDAR-BASED SIGNAL

3121
02:11:34,019 --> 02:11:37,289
THAT JUNE WAS A POSSIBILITY.

3122
02:11:37,289 --> 02:11:38,523
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

3123
02:11:38,523 --> 02:11:40,525
STATEMENT, WE POINTED TO SLOWER

3124
02:11:40,525 --> 02:11:46,765
GROWTH, BUT THERE WAS NO

3125
02:11:46,765 --> 02:11:47,566
FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR GROWTH TO

3126
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:50,569
HAVE SLOWED.

3127
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:53,538
WE POINTED TO FUNDAMENTALS

3128
02:11:53,538 --> 02:11:54,606
UNDERLYING HOUSEHOLD SPENDING

3129
02:11:54,606 --> 02:11:56,608
DECISIONS THAT REMAINED ON SOLID

3130
02:11:56,608 --> 02:11:59,578
GROUND, SUGGESTING MAYBE THIS

3131
02:11:59,578 --> 02:12:03,348
WAS SOMETHING TRANSITORY THAT

3132
02:12:03,348 --> 02:12:03,915
WOULD DISAPPEAR.

3133
02:12:03,915 --> 02:12:06,651
WE NOTED LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS

3134
02:12:06,651 --> 02:12:08,487
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IN LINE WITH

3135
02:12:08,487 --> 02:12:11,657
OUR EXPECTATIONS.

3136
02:12:11,657 --> 02:12:15,660
WE DID DOWNGRADE SOMEWHAT OUR

3137
02:12:15,660 --> 02:12:17,462
EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT THE

3138
02:12:17,462 --> 02:12:20,799
GLOBAL RISK ENVIRONMENT.

3139
02:12:20,799 --> 02:12:29,808
I DO THINK THERE WERE HINTS IN

3140
02:12:29,808 --> 02:12:31,176
THE APRIL STATEMENT THAT THE

3141
02:12:31,176 --> 02:12:31,776
COMMITTEE WAS CHANGING

3142
02:12:31,776 --> 02:12:32,644
INTERVIEWS OF WHAT IT WAS SEEING

3143
02:12:32,644 --> 02:12:32,944
.

3144
02:12:32,944 --> 02:12:36,882
WE CONTINUE TO SAY THAT IF WE

3145
02:12:36,882 --> 02:12:40,118
THINK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

3146
02:12:40,118 --> 02:12:40,919
INVOLVED IN LINE WITH OUR

3147
02:12:40,919 --> 02:12:42,787
EXPECTATIONS, THE GRADUAL AND

3148
02:12:42,787 --> 02:12:44,656
CAUTIOUS FURTHER INCREASES WE

3149
02:12:44,656 --> 02:12:49,594
EXPECT TO BE APPROPRIATE.

3150
02:12:49,594 --> 02:12:51,229
I SUPPOSE I WAS SOMEWHAT

3151
02:12:51,229 --> 02:12:51,963
SURPRISED WITH THE MARKET

3152
02:12:51,963 --> 02:12:56,168
INTERPRETATION OF IT.

3153
02:12:56,168 --> 02:12:57,903
BUT THE MINUTES OF THE APRIL

3154
02:12:57,903 --> 02:13:00,605
MEETING WERE AN ACCURATE SUMMARY

3155
02:13:00,605 --> 02:13:08,112
OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

3156
02:13:08,112 --> 02:13:12,117
>> THE FED HAS REPEATEDLY VOICED

3157
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:15,053
ITS CONCERN OVER THE SLOW BASE

3158
02:13:15,053 --> 02:13:16,989
OF WAGE GROWTH.

3159
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:19,324
I WAS WONDERING, DO YOU THINK

3160
02:13:19,324 --> 02:13:20,292
INCREASING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM

3161
02:13:20,292 --> 02:13:21,159
WAGE COULD BE OF ANY HELP, COULD

3162
02:13:21,159 --> 02:13:24,129
IT BOOST HIGHER WAGES AND

3163
02:13:24,129 --> 02:13:26,164
EVENTUALLY DRIVE UP INFLATION?

3164
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:29,834
CHAIR YELLEN: I THINK THE

3165
02:13:29,834 --> 02:13:32,037
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES THAT HAVE

3166
02:13:32,037 --> 02:13:34,906
GONE INTO EFFECT, ESTIMATES THAT

3167
02:13:34,906 --> 02:13:38,777
I HAVE SEEN SUGGEST IT IS A

3168
02:13:38,777 --> 02:13:41,880
RELATIVELY MINOR INFLUENCE ON

3169
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:43,148
THE AGGREGATE LEVEL OF WAGE

3170
02:13:43,148 --> 02:13:48,119
INFLATION.

3171
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:48,853
I WOULD TAKE SOMEWHAT FASTER

3172
02:13:48,853 --> 02:13:50,355
WAGE INCREASES TO BE A SIGN THAT

3173
02:13:50,355 --> 02:13:53,291
LABOR MARKET SLACK IS

3174
02:13:53,291 --> 02:13:56,294
DIMINISHING THAN THAT THE LABOR

3175
02:13:56,294 --> 02:13:57,095
MARKET IS APPROACHING CONDITIONS

3176
02:13:57,095 --> 02:14:00,265
THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH MAXIMUM

3177
02:14:00,265 --> 02:14:07,406
EMPLOYMENT.

3178
02:14:07,406 --> 02:14:14,146
I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME HINTS,

3179
02:14:14,146 --> 02:14:14,980
PERHAPS PULMONARY INDICATIONS,

3180
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:15,747
THAT WEIGHT GROWTH IS PICKING

3181
02:14:15,747 --> 02:14:16,381
UP.

3182
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:18,450
AS MUCH AS ANYTHING, I THINK IT

3183
02:14:18,450 --> 02:14:19,284
IS A SIGN OF A GENERALLY HEALTHY

3184
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:22,454
LABOR MARKET, WHICH IS WHAT OUR

3185
02:14:22,454 --> 02:14:25,257
MANDATED OBJECTIVE IS, TO

3186
02:14:25,257 --> 02:14:25,991
ACHIEVE MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT.

3187
02:14:25,991 --> 02:14:30,429
SO IT WOULD BE A SYMPTOM OF IT.

3188
02:14:30,429 --> 02:14:36,868
>> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

3189
02:14:36,868 --> 02:14:38,603
DISCUSSION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

3190
02:14:38,603 --> 02:14:42,841
MONTHS ABOUT THE SLOW PACE OF

3191
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:43,642
THE MAN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

3192
02:14:43,642 --> 02:14:45,577
SOME ECONOMISTS THINK CENTRAL

3193
02:14:45,577 --> 02:14:48,713
BANKS SHOULD YOU CAN ABOUT USING

3194
02:14:48,713 --> 02:14:50,749
HELICOPTER MONEY.

3195
02:14:50,749 --> 02:14:55,587
THEY BE IN JAPAN OR YOUR FIRST.

3196
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:58,156
-- EUROPE FIRST.

3197
02:14:58,156 --> 02:14:58,923
THEN FORMER CHAIR BEN BERNANKE

3198
02:14:58,923 --> 02:14:59,791
WEIGHED IN AND SAID IT WOULD BE

3199
02:14:59,791 --> 02:15:00,659
A GOOD IDEA TO PUT HELICOPTER

3200
02:15:00,659 --> 02:15:04,829
MONEY IN ITS TOOL KIT, IN THE

3201
02:15:04,829 --> 02:15:05,363
UNITED STATES.

3202
02:15:05,363 --> 02:15:06,097
I LIKE TO GET YOUR COMMENTS ON

3203
02:15:06,097 --> 02:15:06,698
THAT.

3204
02:15:06,698 --> 02:15:13,071
CHAIR YELLEN: IN NORMAL TIMES,

3205
02:15:13,071 --> 02:15:13,872
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE A

3206
02:15:13,872 --> 02:15:14,639
SEPARATION BETWEEN MONETARY AND

3207
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:18,743
FISCAL POLICY.

3208
02:15:18,743 --> 02:15:21,313
IT IS A PRIMARY REASON FOR

3209
02:15:21,313 --> 02:15:23,381
INDEPENDENCE OF THE CENTRAL BANK

3210
02:15:23,381 --> 02:15:27,119
.

3211
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:27,852
WE HAVE SEEN ALL TOO MANY

3212
02:15:27,852 --> 02:15:31,022
EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES THAT END

3213
02:15:31,022 --> 02:15:32,824
UP WITH HIGH OR EVEN

3214
02:15:32,824 --> 02:15:37,929
HYPERINFLATION BECAUSE THOSE IN

3215
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:39,531
CHARGE OF FISCAL POLICY,

3216
02:15:39,531 --> 02:15:42,801
DIRECTORS, CENTRAL-BANK, TO HELP

3217
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:43,902
THEM FINANCE IT BY PRINTING

3218
02:15:43,902 --> 02:15:48,206
MONEY AND MAINTAINING PRICE

3219
02:15:48,206 --> 02:15:50,008
STABILITY AND LOW AND STABLE

3220
02:15:50,008 --> 02:15:53,978
INFLATION IS VERY MUCH AIDED BY

3221
02:15:53,978 --> 02:15:54,679
HAVING CENTRAL BANK

3222
02:15:54,679 --> 02:15:56,047
INDEPENDENCE.

3223
02:15:56,047 --> 02:16:02,654
THAT SAID, IN UNUSUAL TIMES,

3224
02:16:02,654 --> 02:16:03,755
WHERE THE CONCERN IS WITH VERY

3225
02:16:03,755 --> 02:16:07,325
WEAK GROWTH AND POSSIBLY

3226
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:09,127
DEFLATION, RATHER RARE

3227
02:16:09,127 --> 02:16:10,895
CIRCUMSTANCES.

3228
02:16:10,895 --> 02:16:11,730
FIRST OF ALL, FISCAL POLICY CAN

3229
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:12,364
BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL.

3230
02:16:12,364 --> 02:16:17,102
IT IS NATURAL THAT IF IT CAN BE

3231
02:16:17,102 --> 02:16:19,037
EMPLOYED, JUST AS MONETARY

3232
02:16:19,037 --> 02:16:20,905
POLICY IS DOING A LOT TO TRY TO

3233
02:16:20,905 --> 02:16:23,041
STIMULATE GROWTH, THE FISCAL

3234
02:16:23,041 --> 02:16:28,780
POLICY SHOULD PLAY A ROLE.

3235
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:29,547
NORMALLY, YOU WOULD HOPE AN

3236
02:16:29,547 --> 02:16:31,449
ECONOMY WITH NO SEVERE DOWNSIDE

3237
02:16:31,449 --> 02:16:33,151
RISKS, MONETARY AND FISCAL

3238
02:16:33,151 --> 02:16:35,153
POLICY, WOULD NOT BE WORKING

3239
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:38,522
ACROSS PURPOSES, BUT TOGETHER.

3240
02:16:38,522 --> 02:16:40,291
WHETHER OR NOT IN SUCH EXTREME

3241
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:42,093
CIRCUMSTANCES THERE MIGHT BE A

3242
02:16:42,093 --> 02:16:48,333
CASE FOR, LET'S SAY," NATION --

3243
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:51,536
CLOSE COORDINATION, WHERE THE

3244
02:16:51,536 --> 02:16:55,440
CENTRAL BANK PLAYS A ROLE IN

3245
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:56,174
FINANCING POLICY, THIS IS

3246
02:16:56,174 --> 02:16:56,907
SOMETHING THAT ACADEMICS ARE

3247
02:16:56,907 --> 02:16:57,375
DEBATING.

3248
02:16:57,375 --> 02:17:00,745
IT IS SOMETHING THAT ONE MAY

3249
02:17:00,745 --> 02:17:02,513
LEGITIMATELY CONSIDER.

3250
02:17:02,513 --> 02:17:05,517
I WOULD SEE THIS AS VERY

3251
02:17:05,517 --> 02:17:11,222
ABNORMAL, EXTREME SITUATION,

3252
02:17:11,222 --> 02:17:13,725
WHERE ONE NEEDS AN ALL-OUT

3253
02:17:13,725 --> 02:17:15,559
ATTEMPT.

3254
02:17:15,559 --> 02:17:19,531
EVEN THEN, IT IS A MATTER THAT

3255
02:17:19,531 --> 02:17:20,365
ACADEMICS ARE DEBATING, BUT ONLY

3256
02:17:20,365 --> 02:17:23,602
IN AN UNUSUAL SITUATION.

3257
02:17:23,602 --> 02:17:29,207
>> NOW THAT THE FED HAS STARTED

3258
02:17:29,207 --> 02:17:29,974
THE PROCESS OF RAISING RATES,

3259
02:17:29,974 --> 02:17:31,776
VARIOUS FED OFFICIALS HAVE SAID,

3260
02:17:31,776 --> 02:17:34,712
INCLUDING BEN BERNANKE, THAT THE

3261
02:17:34,712 --> 02:17:35,547
FED COULD GO CASH FLOW NEGATIVE

3262
02:17:35,547 --> 02:17:38,916
IN THIS SITUATION AS CAPITAL

3263
02:17:38,916 --> 02:17:39,784
LOSSES ARE TAKEN ON THE

3264
02:17:39,784 --> 02:17:41,352
PORTFOLIO BOND.

3265
02:17:41,352 --> 02:17:42,853
DO YOU SEE THIS HAPPENING, AND

3266
02:17:42,853 --> 02:17:43,788
WHEN MIGHT THIS HAPPEN?

3267
02:17:43,788 --> 02:17:46,691
CHAIR YELLEN: TALKING ABOUT OUR

3268
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:49,761
INCOME GOING NEGATIVE?

3269
02:17:49,761 --> 02:17:57,402
IT IS CONCEIVABLE, IN A SCENARIO

3270
02:17:57,402 --> 02:17:58,169
WHERE GROWTH AND INFLATION

3271
02:17:58,169 --> 02:17:58,903
REALLY SURPRISES US TO THE

3272
02:17:58,903 --> 02:18:04,009
UPSIDE, THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO

3273
02:18:04,009 --> 02:18:05,477
RAISE SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES

3274
02:18:05,477 --> 02:18:07,978
SO RAPIDLY THAT THE RATES WE

3275
02:18:07,978 --> 02:18:12,350
WOULD BE PAYING ON RESERVES

3276
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:14,152
WOULD EXCEED WHAT WE ARE EARNING

3277
02:18:14,152 --> 02:18:14,718
ON OUR PORTFOLIO.

3278
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:19,123
EVEN THEN WE HAVE ABOUT $2

3279
02:18:19,123 --> 02:18:23,295
TRILLION OF LIABILITIES, MAINLY

3280
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:24,195
CURRENCY, ON WHICH WE PAY NO

3281
02:18:24,195 --> 02:18:25,063
INTEREST.

3282
02:18:25,063 --> 02:18:28,066
SO THIS DOES REQUIRE AN EXTREME

3283
02:18:28,066 --> 02:18:32,370
SCENARIO WITH VERY RAPID

3284
02:18:32,370 --> 02:18:34,539
INCREASES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST

3285
02:18:34,539 --> 02:18:34,973
RATES.

3286
02:18:34,973 --> 02:18:38,175
SO IT IS CONCEIVABLE BUT QUITE

3287
02:18:38,175 --> 02:18:42,147
UNLIKELY THAT IT COULD HAPPEN.

3288
02:18:42,147 --> 02:18:47,818
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF IT WERE TO

3289
02:18:47,818 --> 02:18:48,719
HAPPEN, WE WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMY

3290
02:18:48,719 --> 02:18:49,486
THAT WOULD BE DOING VERY WELL.

3291
02:18:49,486 --> 02:18:52,056
THIS IS PROBABLY AN ECONOMY THAT

3292
02:18:52,056 --> 02:18:54,291
EVERYBODY WOULD FEEL VERY

3293
02:18:54,291 --> 02:18:57,327
PLEASED WAS PERFORMING WELL AND

3294
02:18:57,327 --> 02:19:04,369
BETTER THAN EXPECTED, AND OUR

3295
02:19:04,369 --> 02:19:05,102
GOAL IS PRICE STABILITY AND

3296
02:19:05,102 --> 02:19:05,702
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT.

3297
02:19:05,702 --> 02:19:09,607
WE WOULD, WE FEEL GOOD THAT WE

3298
02:19:09,607 --> 02:19:10,709
HAD DONE WELL IN ACHIEVING THAT.

3299
02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:13,844
WE USUALLY MAKE MONEY.

3300
02:19:13,844 --> 02:19:14,611
WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A LOT OF

3301
02:19:14,611 --> 02:19:16,347
MONEY IN RECENT YEARS, BUT THE

3302
02:19:16,347 --> 02:19:18,282
GOAL OF MONETARY POLICY IS NOT

3303
02:19:18,282 --> 02:19:22,787
TO MAXIMIZE OUR INCOME.

3304
02:19:22,787 --> 02:19:24,888
IN A VERY STRONG ECONOMY LIKE

3305
02:19:24,888 --> 02:19:25,690
THAT, THE TREASURY WOULD BE

3306
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:28,459
SEEING A LOT OF INFLOWS IN THE

3307
02:19:28,459 --> 02:19:35,933
FORM OF TAX REVENUES, TOO.

3308
02:19:35,933 --> 02:19:40,672
>> TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU FEEL

3309
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:43,641
CONSTRAINED IN RAISING INTEREST

3310
02:19:43,641 --> 02:19:45,543
RATES BY THE LOW OR EVEN

3311
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:51,716
NEGATIVE RATES THAT FOREIGN

3312
02:19:51,716 --> 02:19:52,450
CENTRAL BANKS ARE PURSUING,

3313
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:54,719
POSSIBLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR WHAT

3314
02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:55,486
IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE DOLLAR

3315
02:19:55,486 --> 02:19:56,788
EXCHANGE RATE?

3316
02:19:56,788 --> 02:19:59,991
IF THAT IS A CONSTRAINT, TO WHAT

3317
02:19:59,991 --> 02:20:00,859
EXTENT MIGHT YOU ALSO BE

3318
02:20:00,859 --> 02:20:03,762
CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT

3319
02:20:03,762 --> 02:20:09,534
LONG-RANGE OF LOW DOMESTIC RATES

3320
02:20:09,534 --> 02:20:10,368
ON POSSIBLY DISTORTING DOMESTIC

3321
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:11,870
MARKETS?

3322
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:14,606
CHAIR YELLEN: THE STATE OF

3323
02:20:14,606 --> 02:20:17,609
FOREIGN ECONOMIES, BOTH THEIR

3324
02:20:17,609 --> 02:20:19,677
GROWTH OUTLOOKS AND THEIR STANCE

3325
02:20:19,677 --> 02:20:25,149
OF MONETARY POLICY, THOSE ARE

3326
02:20:25,149 --> 02:20:25,950
FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE U.S.

3327
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:30,154
OUTLOOK AND INFLUENCE THE

3328
02:20:30,154 --> 02:20:30,989
APPROPRIATE STANCE OF MONETARY

3329
02:20:30,989 --> 02:20:31,356
POLICY.

3330
02:20:31,356 --> 02:20:34,959
SO OF COURSE, WE DO LOOK AT

3331
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:40,932
FOREIGN RATES, THE PROSPECTS,

3332
02:20:40,932 --> 02:20:41,733
AND THE PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH IN

3333
02:20:41,733 --> 02:20:43,067
THOSE ECONOMIES IN CONSIDERING

3334
02:20:43,067 --> 02:20:47,105
THE STANCE OF POLICY.

3335
02:20:47,105 --> 02:20:51,542
DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN COUNTRIES

3336
02:20:51,542 --> 02:20:52,644
IN THE LIKELY POLICY PADS DO

3337
02:20:52,644 --> 02:20:56,181
TEND TO SPILLOVER INTO EXCHANGE

3338
02:20:56,181 --> 02:20:59,417
RATES.

3339
02:20:59,417 --> 02:21:00,284
THAT IS A STANDARD PART OF HOW

3340
02:21:00,284 --> 02:21:02,053
MONETARY POLICY WORKS.

3341
02:21:02,053 --> 02:21:10,128
A STRONGER DOLLAR DOES HAVE BOTH

3342
02:21:10,128 --> 02:21:12,163
A DEPRESSING EFFECT, THEY CREATE

3343
02:21:12,163 --> 02:21:14,899
CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH DOMESTIC

3344
02:21:14,899 --> 02:21:18,102
DEMAND IS DEPRESSED.

3345
02:21:18,102 --> 02:21:24,242
AT THE MOMENT, FOR QUITE SOME

3346
02:21:24,242 --> 02:21:26,211
TIME, AND PROBABLY GOING

3347
02:21:26,211 --> 02:21:28,479
FORWARD, NET EXPORTS WILL

3348
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:29,247
PROBABLY BE A DRAG ON U.S.

3349
02:21:29,247 --> 02:21:29,614
GROWTH.

3350
02:21:29,614 --> 02:21:31,683
SO THAT IS A FACTOR WE TAKE INTO

3351
02:21:31,683 --> 02:21:35,620
ACCOUNT.

3352
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:36,454
INCREASES IN THE DOLLAR THAT WE

3353
02:21:36,454 --> 02:21:42,427
HAVE SEEN SINCE MID-2014 HAVE

3354
02:21:42,427 --> 02:21:44,896
SERVED TO PUSH INFLATION DOWN AS

3355
02:21:44,896 --> 02:21:45,697
WELL, CAN ALSO HAVE IMPACTS ON

3356
02:21:45,697 --> 02:21:46,431
COMMODITY PRICES THAT ARE

3357
02:21:46,431 --> 02:21:48,466
RELEVANT.

3358
02:21:48,466 --> 02:21:51,602
IT IS CERTAINLY RELEVANT TO THE

3359
02:21:51,602 --> 02:21:53,037
STANCE OF U.S. MONETARY POLICY,

3360
02:21:53,037 --> 02:21:58,042
AND A FACTOR, BUT ONE SAYS A

3361
02:21:58,042 --> 02:22:00,344
CONSTRAINT, I WOULD NOT GO AS

3362
02:22:00,344 --> 02:22:01,012
FAR TO SAY THAT IT IS A

3363
02:22:01,012 --> 02:22:02,380
CONSTRAINT ON MONETARY POLICY.

3364
02:22:02,380 --> 02:22:06,618
WHEN WE HAVE AN OUTLOOK OR

3365
02:22:06,618 --> 02:22:12,891
CONTINUING ABOVE TREND GROWTH,

3366
02:22:12,891 --> 02:22:13,758
HOLDING RATES ABSOLUTELY FLAT,

3367
02:22:13,758 --> 02:22:14,459
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

3368
02:22:14,459 --> 02:22:16,494
INFLATION WOULD OVERSHOOT OUR

3369
02:22:16,494 --> 02:22:18,629
TARGET, WE WOULD SEE A CASE TO

3370
02:22:18,629 --> 02:22:22,066
GRADUALLY RAISE RATES OVER TIME.

3371
02:22:22,066 --> 02:22:23,535
AT THE MOMENT, I THINK, MARKETS

3372
02:22:23,535 --> 02:22:26,671
EXPECT -- AND THIS IS FACTORED

3373
02:22:26,671 --> 02:22:30,708
INTO MARKET PRICES -- A GRADUAL

3374
02:22:30,708 --> 02:22:31,442
PATH TO RATE INCREASES OVER

3375
02:22:31,442 --> 02:22:33,011
TIME.

3376
02:22:33,011 --> 02:22:33,845
FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WERE TO SEE

3377
02:22:33,845 --> 02:22:35,747
UPSIDE SURPRISES TO GROWTH AND

3378
02:22:35,747 --> 02:22:38,616
INFLATION, AND HAD TO RAISE

3379
02:22:38,616 --> 02:22:40,752
SHORT-TERM RATES FASTER THAN WE

3380
02:22:40,752 --> 02:22:42,954
THOUGHT WE SHOULD, ONE OF THE

3381
02:22:42,954 --> 02:22:43,721
CHANNELS BY WHICH THAT WOULD

3382
02:22:43,721 --> 02:22:46,791
WORK WOULD BE THE ASSOCIATED

3383
02:22:46,791 --> 02:22:49,494
IMPACT ON THE DOLLAR.

3384
02:22:49,494 --> 02:22:51,662
THAT IS A STANDARD CHANNEL

3385
02:22:51,662 --> 02:22:53,064
THROUGH WHICH THE MONETARY

3386
02:22:53,064 --> 02:22:55,099
POLICY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM

3387
02:22:55,099 --> 02:22:55,967
WORKS, AND WE WOULD TAKE THAT

3388
02:22:55,967 --> 02:22:58,102
INTO ACCOUNT, AND WOULD NOT FEEL

3389
02:22:58,102 --> 02:22:59,370
CONSTRAINED.

3390
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:00,171
THAT WOULD BE PART OF HOW IT

3391
02:23:00,171 --> 02:23:06,043
WOULD WORK.

3392
02:23:06,043 --> 02:23:09,881
>> HOW MUCH ARE YOU WATCHING OIL

3393
02:23:09,881 --> 02:23:12,917
PRICES AND THEIR IMPACT ON

3394
02:23:12,917 --> 02:23:16,087
INFLATION, AND HOW THAT COULD

3395
02:23:16,087 --> 02:23:17,255
AFFECT THE TIMING OF FUTURE RATE

3396
02:23:17,255 --> 02:23:18,022
INCREASES, AND HOW MUCH YOU

3397
02:23:18,022 --> 02:23:18,957
MIGHT INCREASE RATE?

3398
02:23:18,957 --> 02:23:23,227
CHAIR YELLEN: OIL PRICES HAVE

3399
02:23:23,227 --> 02:23:23,995
HAD MANY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON

3400
02:23:23,995 --> 02:23:25,363
THE ECONOMY.

3401
02:23:25,363 --> 02:23:26,230
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING OIL PRICES

3402
02:23:26,230 --> 02:23:26,898
CLOSELY.

3403
02:23:26,898 --> 02:23:33,337
AS YOU SAID, FALLING OIL PRICES

3404
02:23:33,337 --> 02:23:39,076
HOLD DOWN INFLATION -- PULL DOWN

3405
02:23:39,076 --> 02:23:40,945
INFLATION.

3406
02:23:40,945 --> 02:23:43,181
IT TAKES FALLING OIL PRICES TO

3407
02:23:43,181 --> 02:23:43,981
LOWER INFLATION ON A SUSTAINED

3408
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:44,315
BASIS.

3409
02:23:44,315 --> 02:23:46,951
ONCE THEY STABILIZE, AT WHATEVER

3410
02:23:46,951 --> 02:23:49,120
LEVEL, THEIR IMPACT ON INFLATION

3411
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:54,158
DISSIPATE OVER TIME.

3412
02:23:54,158 --> 02:23:54,959
SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THAT

3413
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:57,395
HAPPENING.

3414
02:23:57,395 --> 02:23:58,196
NOT ONLY HAVE THEY STABILIZE,

3415
02:23:58,196 --> 02:24:01,132
THEY HAVE MOVED UP SOME.

3416
02:24:01,132 --> 02:24:02,600
THEIR IMPACT ON INFLATION IS

3417
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:06,237
WANING OVER TIME.

3418
02:24:06,237 --> 02:24:07,705
BUT OIL PRICES HAVE ALSO HAD A

3419
02:24:07,705 --> 02:24:12,043
VERY SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE AFFECT

3420
02:24:12,043 --> 02:24:13,811
ON DRILLING AND MINING ACTIVITY

3421
02:24:13,811 --> 02:24:15,880
THAT HAS LED TO WEAKNESS IN

3422
02:24:15,880 --> 02:24:18,850
INVESTMENT SPENDING AND JOB LOSS

3423
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:21,853
AND MANUFACTURING, OBVIOUSLY, IN

3424
02:24:21,853 --> 02:24:26,157
THE ENERGY OR.

3425
02:24:26,157 --> 02:24:28,693
-- SECTOR.

3426
02:24:28,693 --> 02:24:29,427
IT HAS DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN

3427
02:24:29,427 --> 02:24:30,194
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR DIFFERENT

3428
02:24:30,194 --> 02:24:32,330
SECT HERS.

3429
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:33,164
FOR AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS, IT HAS

3430
02:24:33,164 --> 02:24:34,332
BEEN A BOON.

3431
02:24:34,332 --> 02:24:36,968
WE HAVE ESTIMATED SINCE 2014,

3432
02:24:36,968 --> 02:24:37,869
THE DECLINE IN ENERGY PRICES,

3433
02:24:37,869 --> 02:24:41,138
OIL PRICES, HAS PROBABLY

3434
02:24:41,138 --> 02:24:44,909
RESULTED IN GAINS OF ABOUT $1400

3435
02:24:44,909 --> 02:24:47,111
PER U.S. HOUSEHOLD.

3436
02:24:47,111 --> 02:24:49,647
THAT HAS HAD AN OUTSTANDING

3437
02:24:49,647 --> 02:24:51,683
POSITIVE IMPACT ON SPENDING.

3438
02:24:51,683 --> 02:24:53,384
BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE

3439
02:24:53,384 --> 02:24:55,286
WORLD THAT ARE IMPORTANT

3440
02:24:55,286 --> 02:24:59,223
COMMODITY EXPORTERS, THE DECLINE

3441
02:24:59,223 --> 02:25:02,226
WE HAVE SEEN IN OIL PRICES HAS

3442
02:25:02,226 --> 02:25:03,494
HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT ON THEIR

3443
02:25:03,494 --> 02:25:06,063
GROWTH, THEIR TRADE WITH US, AND

3444
02:25:06,063 --> 02:25:13,537
OTHER TRADE PARTNERS, AND CAUSED

3445
02:25:13,537 --> 02:25:14,205
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE HAD

3446
02:25:14,205 --> 02:25:15,006
SPILLOVERS TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

3447
02:25:15,006 --> 02:25:16,074
AS WELL.

3448
02:25:16,074 --> 02:25:22,746
SO IT IS A COMPLICATED PICTURE.

3449
02:25:22,746 --> 02:25:28,219
TOM: THE CHAIR GETTING MORE

3450
02:25:28,219 --> 02:25:30,621
PRACTICE AT HER PRESS

3451
02:25:30,621 --> 02:25:31,122
CONFERENCE.

3452
02:25:31,122 --> 02:25:31,889
MICHAEL MCKEE HAS ATTENDED 432

3453
02:25:31,889 --> 02:25:32,823
OF THESE BACK TO ALEXANDER

3454
02:25:32,823 --> 02:25:33,925
HAMILTON.

3455
02:25:33,925 --> 02:25:34,759
YOU ARE NOT IN A BROADWAY PLAY.

3456
02:25:34,759 --> 02:25:39,130
MIKE: YOU DID NOT HAVE TO PAY

3457
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:39,864
THAT KIND OF MONEY TO GET IN

3458
02:25:39,864 --> 02:25:40,231
THAT.

3459
02:25:40,231 --> 02:25:41,732
TOM: HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM

3460
02:25:41,732 --> 02:25:44,669
MARIO DRAGHI'S PRESS CONFERENCE?

3461
02:25:44,669 --> 02:25:48,572
MIKE: VERY MUCH THE SAME.

3462
02:25:48,572 --> 02:25:50,207
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO ASK A

3463
02:25:50,207 --> 02:25:51,042
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION BUT PEOPLE

3464
02:25:51,042 --> 02:25:51,943
ARE FOCUSING ON THE IMPLICATIONS

3465
02:25:51,943 --> 02:25:54,345
OF IT.

3466
02:25:54,345 --> 02:25:56,113
THAT BECOMES AN ISSUE WHEN A

3467
02:25:56,113 --> 02:25:56,881
MEETING WITH JULY IS ON THE

3468
02:25:56,881 --> 02:25:57,214
TABLE.

3469
02:25:57,214 --> 02:25:59,583
SHE TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE,

3470
02:25:59,583 --> 02:26:00,318
PROBABLY NOT FOR ECONOMIC

3471
02:26:00,318 --> 02:26:01,752
REASONS TODAY, BUT THERE ARE

3472
02:26:01,752 --> 02:26:02,954
PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY SHOULD

3473
02:26:02,954 --> 02:26:03,587
HAVE THESE EVERY DAY.

3474
02:26:03,587 --> 02:26:06,057
TOM: LET'S WELCOME BACK OUR

3475
02:26:06,057 --> 02:26:09,127
AUDIENCE.

3476
02:26:09,127 --> 02:26:10,862
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IN ASIA,

3477
02:26:10,862 --> 02:26:13,064
CERTAINLY LISTENING IN A VERY

3478
02:26:13,064 --> 02:26:14,899
INTERESTING EUROPE AS WELL.

3479
02:26:14,899 --> 02:26:17,401
YOU ARE WATCHING AND LISTENING

3480
02:26:17,401 --> 02:26:18,169
TO BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND

3481
02:26:18,169 --> 02:26:19,203
BLOOMBERG RADIO.

3482
02:26:19,203 --> 02:26:21,939
I AM TALKING WITH MICHAEL MCKEE.

3483
02:26:21,939 --> 02:26:24,408
LET'S DO A QUICK DATA CHECK

3484
02:26:24,408 --> 02:26:25,176
BEFORE WE GET TO OUR ESTEEMED

3485
02:26:25,176 --> 02:26:26,511
GUEST.

3486
02:26:26,511 --> 02:26:27,278
VICE CHAIRMAN BLINDER IS

3487
02:26:27,278 --> 02:26:28,980
SCHEDULED TO JOIN US.

3488
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:32,450
THE DATA, THE USUAL SETBACK BACK

3489
02:26:32,450 --> 02:26:33,184
FROM THE SHOCK AND ALL OF THE

3490
02:26:33,184 --> 02:26:34,952
MEETING, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THESE

3491
02:26:34,952 --> 02:26:39,090
ARE CHANGED SCREENS FROM ONE

3492
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:49,533
POINT -- 1:45 THIS AFTERNOON.

3493
02:26:49,533 --> 02:26:53,237
WE WILL COME TO YEN IN A MOMENT.

3494
02:26:53,237 --> 02:27:00,578
105.06, STEEPENING OUT OVER THE

3495
02:27:00,578 --> 02:27:02,713
LAST HOUR.

3496
02:27:02,713 --> 02:27:03,514
THERE IS THE TWO-YEAR YIELD

3497
02:27:03,514 --> 02:27:07,684
AGAIN.

3498
02:27:07,684 --> 02:27:09,687
FULL THIS TOGETHER, ECONOMICS,

3499
02:27:09,687 --> 02:27:10,521
FINANCE AND INVESTMENT, WITH THE

3500
02:27:10,521 --> 02:27:11,255
GLOBAL LITMUS PAPER, WHICH IS

3501
02:27:11,255 --> 02:27:12,089
FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

3502
02:27:12,089 --> 02:27:16,127
WORKING WITH JAMES SWEENEY IS

3503
02:27:16,127 --> 02:27:18,462
SHABAB JALINOOS.

3504
02:27:18,462 --> 02:27:20,197
I WANT TO GO RIGHT TO THE CHART

3505
02:27:20,197 --> 02:27:22,800
AND THE LOOK ON DOLLAR YEN.

3506
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:23,634
FOR THOSE OF YOU ON BLOOMBERG

3507
02:27:23,634 --> 02:27:26,537
RADIO, I WILL PUT THIS OUT.

3508
02:27:26,537 --> 02:27:28,439
THIS IS A CHART THAT MANY OF OUR

3509
02:27:28,439 --> 02:27:29,440
VIEWERS AND LISTENERS KNOW.

3510
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:34,111
JAPAN WANTS A WEAKER YEN.

3511
02:27:34,111 --> 02:27:35,179
A GOOD PART OF A STRONGER YEN IS

3512
02:27:35,179 --> 02:27:37,915
CHAIR YELLEN.

3513
02:27:37,915 --> 02:27:38,716
IS CHAIR YELLEN THE CENTRAL

3514
02:27:38,716 --> 02:27:39,483
BANKER TO THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN?

3515
02:27:39,483 --> 02:27:43,821
>> WE GET TO SEE TONIGHT, I

3516
02:27:43,821 --> 02:27:45,590
GUESS, WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE

3517
02:27:45,590 --> 02:27:49,727
BOJ'S OWN INTEREST-RATE READING

3518
02:27:49,727 --> 02:27:50,728
-- MEETING.

3519
02:27:50,728 --> 02:27:53,497
MY QUESTION WOULD BE, WHAT IS

3520
02:27:53,497 --> 02:27:54,465
THE POINT OF EASING NOW AHEAD OF

3521
02:27:54,465 --> 02:27:57,501
THE POTENTIAL BREXIT RISKS THAT

3522
02:27:57,501 --> 02:28:01,072
THE MARKETS ARE FACING?

3523
02:28:01,072 --> 02:28:01,872
POTENTIALLY SEEING A LACK OF

3524
02:28:01,872 --> 02:28:03,340
RESPONSE IN THE MARKETS.

3525
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:05,776
AND THEN POTENTIALLY HAVING TO

3526
02:28:05,776 --> 02:28:07,812
EASE AGAIN.

3527
02:28:07,812 --> 02:28:12,817
IT IS DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT.

3528
02:28:12,817 --> 02:28:16,053
MIKE: JANET YELLEN DID NOTE IN

3529
02:28:16,053 --> 02:28:21,125
HER NEWS CONFERENCE THAT BREXIT

3530
02:28:21,125 --> 02:28:21,759
WAS A FACTOR IN HER

3531
02:28:21,759 --> 02:28:22,326
DECISION-MAKING.

3532
02:28:22,326 --> 02:28:23,060
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL

3533
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:23,427
HAPPEN.

3534
02:28:23,427 --> 02:28:25,129
IT IS A FACTOR IN THE TRADE

3535
02:28:25,129 --> 02:28:25,830
RIGHT NOW, THE UNCERTAINTY

3536
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:26,397
SURROUNDING THIS?

3537
02:28:26,397 --> 02:28:30,935
>> IF YOU LOOK AT FX OPTIONS

3538
02:28:30,935 --> 02:28:33,304
MARKETS, CURRENCIES COULD BE FAR

3539
02:28:33,304 --> 02:28:34,038
AWAY FROM THE U.K., THEY ARE

3540
02:28:34,038 --> 02:28:36,040
ALSO PRICING IN QUITE A LOT OF

3541
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:36,774
IMPLIED VOLATILITY OVER THE

3542
02:28:36,774 --> 02:28:37,141
BREXIT.

3543
02:28:37,141 --> 02:28:41,479
THAT IS REALLY THE ONLY ISSUE

3544
02:28:41,479 --> 02:28:42,279
RIGHT NOW THAT IS AFFECTING

3545
02:28:42,279 --> 02:28:43,014
MARKETS.

3546
02:28:43,014 --> 02:28:46,250
NONE OF THE FED IS OUT OF THE

3547
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:47,051
WAY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

3548
02:28:47,051 --> 02:28:47,651
BANK OF JAPAN MEETING.

3549
02:28:47,651 --> 02:28:51,422
MIKE: THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES,

3550
02:28:51,422 --> 02:28:52,289
SUPPOSE THEY WILL TO STAY IN THE

3551
02:28:52,289 --> 02:28:56,460
EUROPEAN UNION.

3552
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,261
ON JUNE 24, DOES EVERYBODY HAD

3553
02:28:57,261 --> 02:28:57,862
FOR THE SAME DOOR?

3554
02:28:57,862 --> 02:29:03,767
>> POTENTIALLY, YES.

3555
02:29:03,767 --> 02:29:04,602
A LOT OF INABILITY IN THE MARKET

3556
02:29:04,602 --> 02:29:05,369
AT THIS POINT TO PROVIDE AN, IN

3557
02:29:05,369 --> 02:29:07,138
TERMS OF HEDGES FOR THOSE

3558
02:29:07,138 --> 02:29:10,308
WORRIED ABOUT BREXIT RISK.

3559
02:29:10,308 --> 02:29:12,343
PRESUMABLY, MARKETS ARE

3560
02:29:12,343 --> 02:29:14,979
UNDERWEIGHT STERLING ASSETS,

3561
02:29:14,979 --> 02:29:16,046
MATERIAL WAY, EUROPEAN ASSETS

3562
02:29:16,046 --> 02:29:18,416
GENERALLY MORE.

3563
02:29:18,416 --> 02:29:20,017
IT COULD LEAD TO A RISK ON

3564
02:29:20,017 --> 02:29:24,021
ENVIRONMENT.

3565
02:29:24,021 --> 02:29:24,889
IT DEPENDS ON HOW CONCLUSIVE THE

3566
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:25,489
OUTCOME IS AS WELL.

3567
02:29:25,489 --> 02:29:29,593
SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT A TIE VOTE

3568
02:29:29,593 --> 02:29:30,361
LEAD TO SOME RISK AVERSION IN

3569
02:29:30,361 --> 02:29:30,761
THE U.K.

3570
02:29:30,761 --> 02:29:33,230
BUT A CLEARER WHEN WOULD BE A

3571
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:33,731
NARROW ENTRY.

3572
02:29:33,731 --> 02:29:38,769
TOM: WITH THE UNCERTAINTY THAT

3573
02:29:38,769 --> 02:29:39,537
BOB NARDELLI AND THE BUSINESS

3574
02:29:39,537 --> 02:29:42,940
WORLD TALK ABOUT, IS YOUR WORLD

3575
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:43,674
BUSY, OR ARE YOU ALL AT THE

3576
02:29:43,674 --> 02:29:44,608
BEACH AND THE HAMPTONS?

3577
02:29:44,608 --> 02:29:48,913
MIKE: YOU HAVE TO STAY THROUGH

3578
02:29:48,913 --> 02:29:49,547
THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK.

3579
02:29:49,547 --> 02:29:52,083
>> EXACTLY.

3580
02:29:52,083 --> 02:29:52,850
WE DO HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE

3581
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:53,284
MARKETS.

3582
02:29:53,284 --> 02:29:57,388
TOM: ARE PEOPLE TAKING BET

3583
02:29:57,388 --> 02:29:57,721
S?

3584
02:29:57,721 --> 02:30:02,927
>> IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY.

3585
02:30:02,927 --> 02:30:03,727
INVESTORS HAVE CERTAINLY TRY TO

3586
02:30:03,727 --> 02:30:04,929
COVER THE RISK, BUT ACTIVELY

3587
02:30:04,929 --> 02:30:06,998
BETTING -- IT IS HARD.

3588
02:30:06,998 --> 02:30:07,798
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO BET

3589
02:30:07,798 --> 02:30:11,802
ON BREXIT RIGHT NOW, IT IS

3590
02:30:11,802 --> 02:30:13,004
EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT.

3591
02:30:13,004 --> 02:30:16,374
THE RISK PREMIUMS ARE HIGH.

3592
02:30:16,374 --> 02:30:17,241
NOT VERY APPEALING AT THIS POINT

3593
02:30:17,241 --> 02:30:19,010
TO DO ANYTHING ON THAT FRONT.

3594
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:21,178
WHEN WE ARE SEEING OUR MARKET

3595
02:30:21,178 --> 02:30:21,979
PARTICIPANTS LOOKING AT AREAS

3596
02:30:21,979 --> 02:30:22,746
WHERE THEY STILL MIGHT BE CHEAP

3597
02:30:22,746 --> 02:30:32,490
WAYS TO PUT BETS ON BREXIT.

3598
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:33,357
WE BELIEVE IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN

3599
02:30:33,357 --> 02:30:36,260
THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS TOO LOW.

3600
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:38,396
IF YOU GET A GENERAL MARKET

3601
02:30:38,396 --> 02:30:39,196
DYSFUNCTION, EVEN A CURRENCY

3602
02:30:39,196 --> 02:30:41,732
THAT IS COMPLETELY UNRELATED

3603
02:30:41,732 --> 02:30:43,367
COULD SEE A LOT OF VOLATILITY.

3604
02:30:43,367 --> 02:30:44,034
THERE ARE STILL THESE

3605
02:30:44,034 --> 02:30:45,970
POSSIBILITIES ON THE SIDELINES,

3606
02:30:45,970 --> 02:30:47,038
BUT NOT THAT MANY.

3607
02:30:47,038 --> 02:30:52,810
MIKE: ERIK SCHATZKER TRADED HIS

3608
02:30:52,810 --> 02:30:53,978
TICKET TO "HAMILTON" TO A SEAT

3609
02:30:53,978 --> 02:30:55,579
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

3610
02:30:55,579 --> 02:30:56,413
HE HAS COME OUT OF THE MEETING

3611
02:30:56,413 --> 02:30:58,582
NOW.

3612
02:30:58,582 --> 02:30:59,383
WHAT DID YOU SEE AS THE MOST

3613
02:30:59,383 --> 02:31:00,150
IMPORTANT THING THAT SHE SAID?

3614
02:31:00,150 --> 02:31:06,490
ERIK: A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT

3615
02:31:06,490 --> 02:31:07,224
THINGS, WE CAN CERTAINLY GO

3616
02:31:07,224 --> 02:31:08,292
THROUGH A BUNCH OF THEM.

3617
02:31:08,292 --> 02:31:10,094
IT TOOK A WHILE FOR HER TO

3618
02:31:10,094 --> 02:31:10,861
ANSWER OR ADDRESS THE QUESTION

3619
02:31:10,861 --> 02:31:12,529
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE

3620
02:31:12,529 --> 02:31:13,330
INEVITABLY ASKING AFTER READING

3621
02:31:13,330 --> 02:31:15,399
THIS PIGMENT AND LOOKING AT THE

3622
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:17,935
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS

3623
02:31:17,935 --> 02:31:20,838
AND IMPORTANTLY, THE DOT PLOT.

3624
02:31:20,838 --> 02:31:21,672
COULD THE FED ACTUALLY MOVE ANY

3625
02:31:21,672 --> 02:31:26,277
TIME DURING THE NEXT THREE

3626
02:31:26,644 --> 02:31:28,279
SHE WAS ADAMANT THE BAND WILL

3627
02:31:28,279 --> 02:31:28,979
FEEL FREE TO MOVE THE DATA

3628
02:31:28,979 --> 02:31:30,147
COORDINATE.

3629
02:31:30,147 --> 02:31:32,182
SHE SAID IT COULD BE AT THE NEXT

3630
02:31:32,182 --> 02:31:33,017
MEETING OR TWO AND SHE SAID, AND

3631
02:31:33,017 --> 02:31:35,185
I QUOTE HER, JULY IS NOT

3632
02:31:35,185 --> 02:31:37,455
IMPOSSIBLE.

3633
02:31:37,455 --> 02:31:39,223
SHE HAS BEEN SAYING THIS

3634
02:31:39,223 --> 02:31:42,860
CONSISTENTLY BUT IT IS CLEAR

3635
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:43,861
THAT SHE WANTS TO LEAVE THE

3636
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:45,629
WORLD WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT

3637
02:31:45,629 --> 02:31:46,463
THE BED IS A DEPENDENT, IT WILL

3638
02:31:46,463 --> 02:31:48,032
NOT BE SWAYED BY POLITICS, EVEN

3639
02:31:48,032 --> 02:31:52,269
IF THERE IS A DISORDERLY MARKET

3640
02:31:52,269 --> 02:31:53,037
REACTION TO A POORLY HANDLED

3641
02:31:53,037 --> 02:31:56,940
DEAD RIGHT LIKE -- FED RATE

3642
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:59,343
HIKE.

3643
02:31:59,343 --> 02:32:05,082
THAT CONTINUED ALL THE WAY

3644
02:32:05,082 --> 02:32:05,749
THROUGH FEBRUARY 11.

3645
02:32:05,749 --> 02:32:06,450
ENERGY GUYS TALKING ABOUT

3646
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:06,817
BREXIT.

3647
02:32:06,817 --> 02:32:07,551
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

3648
02:32:07,551 --> 02:32:11,322
SHE SAID THE BREXIT LOOMS VERY

3649
02:32:11,322 --> 02:32:14,425
LARGE FOR THE BED.

3650
02:32:14,425 --> 02:32:18,696
-- THE FED.

3651
02:32:18,696 --> 02:32:22,032
MIKE: HOW DID SHE SWEAR THE IDEA

3652
02:32:22,032 --> 02:32:31,007
--

3653
02:32:31,007 --> 02:32:31,675
INFLATION RISING AND

3654
02:32:31,675 --> 02:32:32,509
UNEMPLOYMENT STAYING ABOVE WHERE

3655
02:32:32,509 --> 02:32:33,277
IT IS CLOSE TO FULL EMPLOYMENT,

3656
02:32:33,277 --> 02:32:34,478
YET THE FED BE ON HOLD AND

3657
02:32:34,478 --> 02:32:35,279
LOWERING ITS FORECAST FOR RATE

3658
02:32:35,279 --> 02:32:35,679
INCREASES?

3659
02:32:35,679 --> 02:32:38,749
ERIK: JEWS ASKED THAT QUESTION A

3660
02:32:38,749 --> 02:32:40,884
COUPLE OF WAYS AND I DO NOT

3661
02:32:40,884 --> 02:32:41,685
THINK YOU COULD FIND ANYBODY IN

3662
02:32:41,685 --> 02:32:43,787
THAT ROOM WHO THOUGHT THE

3663
02:32:43,787 --> 02:32:44,455
EXPLANATION FOR THAT WAS

3664
02:32:44,455 --> 02:32:49,492
SATISFACTORY.

3665
02:32:49,492 --> 02:32:50,294
WHETHER WE ARE GOING BACK EVEN

3666
02:32:50,294 --> 02:32:53,697
FURTHER TO SEE HOW THE FED HAS

3667
02:32:53,697 --> 02:32:54,365
RATCHETED DOWN WHAT THE

3668
02:32:54,365 --> 02:32:56,934
EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT THE NORMAL

3669
02:32:56,934 --> 02:32:57,801
RATE SHOULD BE AT THE ECONOMY IS

3670
02:32:57,801 --> 02:32:59,336
OPERATING AT FULL EMPLOYMENT

3671
02:32:59,336 --> 02:33:01,906
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CRANKING

3672
02:33:01,906 --> 02:33:04,909
DOWN, RATCHETING DOWN ITS

3673
02:33:04,909 --> 02:33:06,877
EXPECTATIONS FOR INFLATION FOR

3674
02:33:06,877 --> 02:33:09,813
UNEMPLOYMENT AT THE SAME TIME

3675
02:33:09,813 --> 02:33:10,647
BUT MOST IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC

3676
02:33:10,647 --> 02:33:13,284
GROWTH.

3677
02:33:13,284 --> 02:33:14,151
I DO NOT THINK I'M ALONE AND

3678
02:33:14,151 --> 02:33:17,054
COMING OUT OF THAT ROOM FEELING

3679
02:33:17,054 --> 02:33:17,788
LIKE THAT QUESTION WAS WELL

3680
02:33:17,788 --> 02:33:18,188
ANSWERED.

3681
02:33:18,188 --> 02:33:22,059
MIKE: THE MARKET HAD TO LIKE THE

3682
02:33:22,059 --> 02:33:24,862
FACT THAT THE FED CAME DOWN

3683
02:33:24,862 --> 02:33:27,831
TOWARDS WHERE THE MARKET IS, BUT

3684
02:33:27,831 --> 02:33:29,700
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF

3685
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:33,103
WHAT THE REACTION FUNCTION IS?

3686
02:33:33,103 --> 02:33:38,509
SHAHAB: WHAT THE SHOWS OF THE

3687
02:33:38,509 --> 02:33:39,276
IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL EVENTS.

3688
02:33:39,276 --> 02:33:42,012
WE HAVE WEAK GROWTH OUTSIDE OF

3689
02:33:42,012 --> 02:33:45,249
THE U.S. 

3690
02:33:45,249 --> 02:33:48,852
ALL OF THIS IS LEADING TO

3691
02:33:48,852 --> 02:33:51,355
INFLOWS INTO U.S. DEBT MARKETS.

3692
02:33:51,355 --> 02:33:55,359
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE A

3693
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:57,428
SITUATION WHERE NET TRADE HAS A

3694
02:33:57,428 --> 02:34:00,230
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GDP AND IF

3695
02:34:00,230 --> 02:34:04,968
THE DOLLAR WERE TO SURGE, THAT

3696
02:34:04,968 --> 02:34:08,472
YOU HAVE A FEEDBACK LOOP BACK

3697
02:34:08,472 --> 02:34:09,006
INTO INFLATION.

3698
02:34:09,006 --> 02:34:11,542
IN MY VIEW COME AT IT IS

3699
02:34:11,542 --> 02:34:13,076
DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW FOR THE FED

3700
02:34:13,076 --> 02:34:15,579
TO BE DOING ANYTHING APPROACHING

3701
02:34:15,579 --> 02:34:17,481
A SEQUENTIAL SERIES OF HIKES.

3702
02:34:17,481 --> 02:34:23,754
TOM: STARTING IN THE JAPAN

3703
02:34:23,754 --> 02:34:24,655
THURSDAY, TODAY IS WEDNESDAY,

3704
02:34:24,655 --> 02:34:27,758
RIGHT?

3705
02:34:27,758 --> 02:34:33,863
FOR YOU AND ME, WE ARE NOT SURE.

3706
02:34:33,863 --> 02:34:36,733
BUT SERIOUSLY, THIS IS A REALLY

3707
02:34:36,733 --> 02:34:40,204
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

3708
02:34:40,204 --> 02:34:41,071
WE HAVE TO OPEN IN JAPAN THAT WE

3709
02:34:41,071 --> 02:34:44,074
HAVE TO GO TO EUROPE.

3710
02:34:44,074 --> 02:34:44,842
EUROPE NEGATIVE RATES CLOSED

3711
02:34:44,842 --> 02:34:45,909
UGLY.

3712
02:34:45,909 --> 02:34:47,711
HOW WILL THEY ADAPT TO THIS

3713
02:34:47,711 --> 02:34:50,547
MOMENT AS THEY RECALIBRATE LESS

3714
02:34:50,547 --> 02:34:53,884
TO BREXIT AND MORE TO THE NEXT

3715
02:34:53,884 --> 02:34:54,318
MOMENT?

3716
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:58,889
SHAHAB: AT THE TIME BEING IT IS

3717
02:34:58,889 --> 02:34:59,690
HARD TO LOOK BEYOND BREXIT, TO

3718
02:34:59,690 --> 02:35:02,493
BE HONEST.

3719
02:35:02,493 --> 02:35:03,360
THERE'S SO MUCH REQUIREMENT

3720
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:04,094
RIGHT NOW TO NOT LOSE MONEY.

3721
02:35:04,094 --> 02:35:06,897
TOM: BRILLIANTLY SAID.

3722
02:35:06,897 --> 02:35:11,101
SHAHAB: IT MAKES IT HARD TO LOOK

3723
02:35:11,101 --> 02:35:11,602
THAT FAR OUT.

3724
02:35:11,602 --> 02:35:16,640
MIKE: THAT IS A BIG CHANGE FOR

3725
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:17,441
PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS BECAUSE IT

3726
02:35:17,441 --> 02:35:20,210
WAS EASY TO MAKE MONEY, GENTLE

3727
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:20,978
BANKS WERE PUMPING MONEY INTO

3728
02:35:20,978 --> 02:35:22,379
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

3729
02:35:22,379 --> 02:35:24,181
THE GOAL IS, JUST DO NOT LOSE?

3730
02:35:24,181 --> 02:35:28,585
SHAHAB: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

3731
02:35:28,585 --> 02:35:30,954
CALIBRATE JUST WHAT WILL HAPPEN

3732
02:35:30,954 --> 02:35:32,456
TO MARKETS IN A BREXIT OUTCOME.

3733
02:35:32,456 --> 02:35:35,159
BUT MARKETS ARE DEFENSIVE.

3734
02:35:35,159 --> 02:35:38,829
YOU ARE NOT PAID A TREMENDOUS

3735
02:35:38,829 --> 02:35:39,630
AMOUNT OF YIELD TO TAKE RISK AT

3736
02:35:39,630 --> 02:35:40,197
THIS POINT IN TIME.

3737
02:35:40,197 --> 02:35:41,432
SO WHY DO IT?

3738
02:35:41,432 --> 02:35:44,301
WHY LOOK TO TAKE ON AGGRESSIVE

3739
02:35:44,301 --> 02:35:46,303
POSITIONS AHEAD OF AN EVENT

3740
02:35:46,303 --> 02:35:47,004
WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

3741
02:35:47,004 --> 02:35:48,372
ANALYZE?

3742
02:35:48,372 --> 02:35:52,976
THAT IS WHAT HAS PUT THE MARKET

3743
02:35:52,976 --> 02:35:53,744
IN THIS DEFENSIVE MODE WE HAVE

3744
02:35:53,744 --> 02:35:56,480
RIGHT NOW.

3745
02:35:56,480 --> 02:36:00,417
THE CURRENT STATUS IS TELLING

3746
02:36:00,417 --> 02:36:03,020
BANKS THINGS ARE NOT GOOD, --

3747
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:08,425
TOM: I WAS SURPRISED AT THE

3748
02:36:08,425 --> 02:36:09,626
AMOUNT OF TALK ON THE LABOR

3749
02:36:09,626 --> 02:36:10,460
ECONOMY IN 60 DAYS OF LOUSY

3750
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:12,996
LABOR NUMBERS.

3751
02:36:12,996 --> 02:36:14,832
WHAT WAS THE ENERGY IN THE PRESS

3752
02:36:14,832 --> 02:36:16,366
CONFERENCE BY THE BLUNT

3753
02:36:16,366 --> 02:36:19,770
INSTRUMENT OF PAYROLLS?

3754
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:22,940
ERIK: THERE WERE A LOT OF

3755
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:26,110
QUESTIONS.

3756
02:36:26,110 --> 02:36:27,044
WE WILL SEE TO JUSTIFY A RATE

3757
02:36:27,044 --> 02:36:27,845
INCREASE.

3758
02:36:27,845 --> 02:36:33,984
THE QUESTION MIGHT BE -- SHE

3759
02:36:33,984 --> 02:36:34,751
SAID ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION

3760
02:36:34,751 --> 02:36:35,485
YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND 18 A

3761
02:36:35,485 --> 02:36:35,886
POINT.

3762
02:36:35,886 --> 02:36:40,157
-- ONE DATA POINT.

3763
02:36:40,157 --> 02:36:43,527
YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND A SINGLE

3764
02:36:43,527 --> 02:36:44,962
DATA POINT.

3765
02:36:44,962 --> 02:36:52,002
IF YOU HAD TO ISOLATE ONE THING

3766
02:36:52,002 --> 02:36:52,769
THAT JANET YELLEN SEEMS MOST

3767
02:36:52,769 --> 02:36:56,106
CONCERNED ABOUT, IT IS THE LABOR

3768
02:36:56,106 --> 02:36:57,408
MARKET, MORE SO THAN INFLATION.

3769
02:36:57,408 --> 02:36:59,176
SHE KEPT DOWN THESE CONCERNS

3770
02:36:59,176 --> 02:37:03,213
ABOUT DETERIORATING INFLATION

3771
02:37:03,213 --> 02:37:06,383
COMPENSATION, WHICH IS HOW SHE

3772
02:37:06,383 --> 02:37:07,150
DESCRIBES THINGS LIKE TIPS OR

3773
02:37:07,150 --> 02:37:08,318
BREAK EVENS.

3774
02:37:08,318 --> 02:37:13,657
SHE ALSO DID GIVE US A COUPLE

3775
02:37:13,657 --> 02:37:14,458
OTHER CLUES ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD

3776
02:37:14,458 --> 02:37:16,259
TAKE FOR THE FED TO WANT TO

3777
02:37:16,259 --> 02:37:17,795
RAISE RATES.

3778
02:37:17,795 --> 02:37:18,528
WE HAVE GOT INTO A BUNCH

3779
02:37:18,528 --> 02:37:21,264
DETAILED ABOUT ONE OF THEM WHICH

3780
02:37:21,264 --> 02:37:21,999
IS INTERNATIONAL OR EXTERNAL

3781
02:37:21,999 --> 02:37:22,499
DEVELOPMENTS.

3782
02:37:22,499 --> 02:37:26,003
BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE WORTH

3783
02:37:26,003 --> 02:37:29,573
POINTING OUT, WHICH WERE SUBDUED

3784
02:37:29,573 --> 02:37:31,708
HOUSEHOLD FORMATION AND THIRDLY,

3785
02:37:31,708 --> 02:37:33,577
MEAGER PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.

3786
02:37:33,577 --> 02:37:36,246
THOSE ARE THINGS THE FED

3787
02:37:36,246 --> 02:37:38,882
CONSIDER HEADWINDS.

3788
02:37:38,882 --> 02:37:39,716
IF THERE WAS PROGRESS ON EITHER

3789
02:37:39,716 --> 02:37:43,921
OF THOSE TWO FRONTS, SHE

3790
02:37:43,921 --> 02:37:44,755
BELIEVES WILL BLOW THROUGH RIGHT

3791
02:37:44,755 --> 02:37:45,522
TO JOB CREATION AND ULTIMATELY

3792
02:37:45,522 --> 02:37:47,724
WE WOULD SEE IT IN THE FORM OF

3793
02:37:47,724 --> 02:37:48,291
HIGHER INFLATION.

3794
02:37:48,291 --> 02:37:52,529
TOM: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

3795
02:37:52,529 --> 02:37:57,501
FOCUSED ON MOVING TO JULY.

3796
02:37:57,501 --> 02:38:00,470
I THINK I'M GOING TO DO A DATA

3797
02:38:00,470 --> 02:38:02,272
CHECK HERE QUICKLY ON THE YIELD

3798
02:38:02,272 --> 02:38:03,040
MARKET IN WHAT WE SAW IN THE

3799
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:04,741
GYRATIONS AND WONDERING WHERE

3800
02:38:04,741 --> 02:38:06,610
RUVELL BE TOMORROW MORNING.

3801
02:38:06,610 --> 02:38:12,549
THE TENURE, UNDER 160, BOBBING

3802
02:38:12,549 --> 02:38:13,316
AROUND BUT STILL A LOWER YIELD

3803
02:38:13,316 --> 02:38:15,519
ON THIS CALL.

3804
02:38:15,519 --> 02:38:20,657
THE DOLLAR YEN IS 106 A MOMENT

3805
02:38:20,657 --> 02:38:21,058
AGO.

3806
02:38:21,058 --> 02:38:23,827
MIKE: LET'S LOOK AT THE TWO-YEAR

3807
02:38:23,827 --> 02:38:24,194
YIELD.

3808
02:38:24,194 --> 02:38:26,863
THE YIELD CURVE IS STEEPENING A

3809
02:38:26,863 --> 02:38:27,631
BIT.

3810
02:38:27,631 --> 02:38:29,900
THE TWO-YEAR PROBABLY MORE THAN

3811
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:30,367
THE 10 YEAR.

3812
02:38:30,367 --> 02:38:33,270
AS PEOPLE TAKE THE FED OUT OF

3813
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:36,773
THE MARKET FOR AT LEAST THREE TO

3814
02:38:36,773 --> 02:38:37,641
SIX MONTHS OR SO.

3815
02:38:37,641 --> 02:38:42,913
TOM: A MUST READ BOOK.

3816
02:38:42,913 --> 02:38:44,881
OVER A DECADE AGO, I WAS THE

3817
02:38:44,881 --> 02:38:45,582
WORK OF ALAN BLINDER AT

3818
02:38:45,582 --> 02:38:46,183
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY.

3819
02:38:46,183 --> 02:38:49,486
HE IS THE FORMER FED VICE

3820
02:38:49,486 --> 02:38:51,121
CHAIRMAN.

3821
02:38:51,121 --> 02:38:51,922
YOU KNOW HIM FROM HIS RECENT

3822
02:38:51,922 --> 02:38:55,625
BOOK ON THE CRISIS, BUT WHEN I

3823
02:38:55,625 --> 02:38:57,594
REMEMBER WAS A QUIET RESOLUTION

3824
02:38:57,594 --> 02:38:59,930
TALKING ABOUT BANKING GOING

3825
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:03,100
MODERN.

3826
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:05,335
ARE THEY WORKING OUT OF YOUR

3827
02:39:05,335 --> 02:39:06,336
CORTEX WORK OR AS EVERYTHING WE

3828
02:39:06,336 --> 02:39:07,137
HEARD TODAY ABSOLUTELY ORIGINAL

3829
02:39:07,137 --> 02:39:07,971
IN A VERY LOUD REVOLUTION?

3830
02:39:07,971 --> 02:39:13,610
>> I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS

3831
02:39:13,610 --> 02:39:14,411
COMPLETELY ORIGINAL BUT IT IS

3832
02:39:14,411 --> 02:39:16,013
VERY MODERN.

3833
02:39:16,013 --> 02:39:18,582
WHERE THE GREAT HALLMARKS OF

3834
02:39:18,582 --> 02:39:19,282
MODERN CENTRAL BANKING AS

3835
02:39:19,282 --> 02:39:21,251
OPPOSED TO OLDER -- AND I DO NOT

3836
02:39:21,251 --> 02:39:22,052
MEAN ARCHAIC, JUST A FEW DECADES

3837
02:39:22,052 --> 02:39:26,423
AGO -- IS CENTRAL TALK WITH

3838
02:39:26,423 --> 02:39:31,794
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC.

3839
02:39:31,794 --> 02:39:32,596
AS ALAN GREENSPAN NEVER WAS,

3840
02:39:32,596 --> 02:39:43,874
DOING A PRESS CONFERENCE TO

3841
02:39:43,874 --> 02:39:44,708
EXPLAIN THE FED'S BANKING.

3842
02:39:44,708 --> 02:39:45,509
ALAN GREENSPAN WAS BED -- FED

3843
02:39:45,509 --> 02:39:46,243
CHAIRMAN NOT TOO LONG AGO AND

3844
02:39:46,243 --> 02:39:46,977
NOW WAS UNTHINKABLE AND NOW IT

3845
02:39:46,977 --> 02:39:47,477
IS JUST NORMAL.

3846
02:39:47,477 --> 02:39:49,346
MIKE: WHAT DID YOU LEARN TODAY

3847
02:39:49,346 --> 02:39:55,752
ABOUT THE FED'S REACTION?

3848
02:39:55,752 --> 02:39:56,586
WHY WOULD THEY CONSIDER GIVING

3849
02:39:56,586 --> 02:39:58,388
THEIR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK?

3850
02:39:58,388 --> 02:40:03,894
ALAN: IT IS A FURTHER TIGHTENING

3851
02:40:03,894 --> 02:40:05,328
OF THE LABOR MARKET STARTS TO

3852
02:40:05,328 --> 02:40:08,632
SHOW EVIDENCE OF INFLATIONARY

3853
02:40:08,632 --> 02:40:12,569
PRESSURES.

3854
02:40:12,569 --> 02:40:15,238
WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME THAT

3855
02:40:15,238 --> 02:40:16,006
ESTHER GEORGE DID NOT DISSENT

3856
02:40:16,006 --> 02:40:19,910
FROM THIS DECISION BECAUSE IF

3857
02:40:19,910 --> 02:40:21,044
YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN A

3858
02:40:21,044 --> 02:40:21,845
CERTAIN WAY YOU CAN SEE SIGNS OF

3859
02:40:21,845 --> 02:40:22,179
THAT.

3860
02:40:22,179 --> 02:40:24,881
FOR EXAMPLE, WE SEE THAT THE

3861
02:40:24,881 --> 02:40:25,582
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS JUST

3862
02:40:25,582 --> 02:40:29,886
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE FED'S

3863
02:40:29,886 --> 02:40:32,556
ESTIMATE, AND WE SEE BOTH WAGES

3864
02:40:32,556 --> 02:40:36,026
AND PRICES ACCELERATING, THOUGH

3865
02:40:36,026 --> 02:40:39,162
FROM VERY LOW LEVELS, NOT LEVELS

3866
02:40:39,162 --> 02:40:41,431
THAT SCARE ANYBODY RIGHT NOW.

3867
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:42,232
BUT THEY ARE MOVING UP, NOT

3868
02:40:42,232 --> 02:40:44,368
DOWN.

3869
02:40:44,368 --> 02:40:45,202
IF YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY HAWKISH,

3870
02:40:45,202 --> 02:40:47,904
THAT WOULD BE -- THOSE WOULD BE

3871
02:40:47,904 --> 02:40:53,376
POWERFUL FIGURES -- SIGNALS TO

3872
02:40:53,376 --> 02:40:54,077
START GETTING ONTO NORMAL

3873
02:40:54,077 --> 02:40:55,979
INTEREST RATES BUT THE FED DID

3874
02:40:55,979 --> 02:40:57,147
NOT THINK THAT WAY TODAY.

3875
02:40:57,147 --> 02:41:01,284
MIKE: YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

3876
02:41:01,284 --> 02:41:02,919
PROJECTIONS THEY PUT OUT AND

3877
02:41:02,919 --> 02:41:05,188
THEY SEE INFLATION RISING BUT

3878
02:41:05,188 --> 02:41:06,256
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE

3879
02:41:06,256 --> 02:41:14,231
NEXT TWO YEARS FALLING EVEN

3880
02:41:14,231 --> 02:41:15,031
FURTHER THAN THEY HAVE BEFORE.

3881
02:41:15,031 --> 02:41:15,799
ALAN: THAT IS THE KIND OF THING

3882
02:41:15,799 --> 02:41:16,166
I MEAN.

3883
02:41:16,166 --> 02:41:16,900
THEY ARE FORECASTING INFLATION

3884
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:17,667
BELOW NEHRU WHICH IS CONSISTENT

3885
02:41:17,667 --> 02:41:22,472
WITH LYSING -- RISING INFLATION.

3886
02:41:22,472 --> 02:41:24,374
THEY HAVEN'T SIGNED US A LONG

3887
02:41:24,374 --> 02:41:25,075
TIME TO THEY HAD GOING TO

3888
02:41:25,075 --> 02:41:25,709
TOLERATE AN OVERSHOOT OF

3889
02:41:25,709 --> 02:41:27,411
INFLATION.

3890
02:41:27,411 --> 02:41:29,479
THEY DID NOT LET A NUMBER ON

3891
02:41:29,479 --> 02:41:30,180
THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

3892
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:31,314
ESTIMATED THAT MEANT 2.5%

3893
02:41:31,314 --> 02:41:35,852
INSTEAD OF 2%.

3894
02:41:35,852 --> 02:41:37,621
THE PRINCIPLE IS THE IMPORTANT

3895
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:41,091
THING, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY

3896
02:41:41,091 --> 02:41:41,725
FORTHRIGHT ABOUT SOME

3897
02:41:41,725 --> 02:41:42,359
WILLINGNESS TO OVERSHOOT

3898
02:41:42,359 --> 02:41:42,792
INFLATION.

3899
02:41:42,792 --> 02:41:43,860
MIKE: DO YOU THINK THEY CAN GET

3900
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:44,761
THEIR?

3901
02:41:44,761 --> 02:41:48,999
ALAN: I DO THINK THEY CAN GET

3902
02:41:48,999 --> 02:41:53,270
THERE.

3903
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:54,204
VERY RECENTLY, I'M TALKING ABOUT

3904
02:41:54,204 --> 02:41:55,538
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS,

3905
02:41:55,538 --> 02:41:58,508
INFLATION IS BASICALLY THE FED'S

3906
02:41:58,508 --> 02:42:02,446
TARGET.

3907
02:42:02,446 --> 02:42:03,313
THEY ARE BASICALLY THERE NOW BUT

3908
02:42:03,313 --> 02:42:03,813
IT IS RISING.

3909
02:42:03,813 --> 02:42:07,117
IT LOOKS TO ME WE'RE GOING TO

3910
02:42:07,117 --> 02:42:07,784
GET AN OVERSHOOT IN THE

3911
02:42:07,784 --> 02:42:08,418
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE.

3912
02:42:08,418 --> 02:42:11,121
NOT A GIANT OVERSHOOT THEM ABOUT

3913
02:42:11,121 --> 02:42:11,621
AN OVERSHOOT.

3914
02:42:11,621 --> 02:42:16,126
TOM: WE WILL GET AN OVERSHOOT,

3915
02:42:16,126 --> 02:42:18,228
BUT THIS LINKS IN WITH YOUR WORK

3916
02:42:18,228 --> 02:42:20,997
OF LINKING FINANCE INTO

3917
02:42:20,997 --> 02:42:21,765
ECONOMICS, WE DO IT WITH A

3918
02:42:21,765 --> 02:42:22,565
MASSIVE DISTORTION OF INTEREST

3919
02:42:22,565 --> 02:42:23,300
RATES.

3920
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:27,037
IF THE FED EXTENDS IT, THEY

3921
02:42:27,037 --> 02:42:29,940
LENGTHEN AND STRENGTHEN -- MAYBE

3922
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:32,142
IT IS LOWER LONGER -- DO THE

3923
02:42:32,142 --> 02:42:35,746
BANKS OF THE WORLD, CAN THEY HAD

3924
02:42:35,746 --> 02:42:36,546
THE PATIENCE AND THE TIME TO

3925
02:42:36,546 --> 02:42:42,385
WAIT FOR THE HEAD TO MOVE -- FED

3926
02:42:42,385 --> 02:42:43,186
TO MOVE OR ARE THEY GOING TO RUN

3927
02:42:43,186 --> 02:42:43,954
OUT OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM?

3928
02:42:43,954 --> 02:42:47,557
IS DEUTSCHE BANK GOING TO RUN

3929
02:42:47,557 --> 02:42:48,258
OUT OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM?

3930
02:42:48,258 --> 02:42:52,696
ALAN: I DO NOT THINK SO.

3931
02:42:52,696 --> 02:42:53,496
TO YOUR QUESTION, THEY DO NOT

3932
02:42:53,496 --> 02:42:55,532
HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO WAIT.

3933
02:42:55,532 --> 02:42:57,200
THEY MAY WISH FOR A HIGHER

3934
02:42:57,200 --> 02:43:00,603
INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, BUT

3935
02:43:00,603 --> 02:43:03,907
THEY ARE NOT GETTING IT QUICKLY.

3936
02:43:03,907 --> 02:43:04,741
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT CAN I DO

3937
02:43:04,741 --> 02:43:11,514
ABOUT IT, CAN THEY HOLD OUT?

3938
02:43:11,514 --> 02:43:12,382
THIS IS SQUEEZING BANK PROFITS,

3939
02:43:12,382 --> 02:43:13,116
MORE SO IN EUROPE THAN THE

3940
02:43:13,116 --> 02:43:17,086
UNITED STATES.

3941
02:43:17,086 --> 02:43:18,121
BUT BUSINESSES HAVE FLUSH TIMES

3942
02:43:18,121 --> 02:43:18,855
AND LEAN TIMES AND THEY ARE

3943
02:43:18,855 --> 02:43:19,589
GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH

3944
02:43:19,589 --> 02:43:22,759
THE LEAN TIMES.

3945
02:43:22,759 --> 02:43:25,929
WHEN YOU LOOK AT U.S. BANKS, YOU

3946
02:43:25,929 --> 02:43:28,698
RAISED DEUTSCHE BANK AND ARE

3947
02:43:28,698 --> 02:43:30,433
OTHERS, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

3948
02:43:30,433 --> 02:43:31,801
U.S. BANKS, THEY ARE DOING

3949
02:43:31,801 --> 02:43:32,635
PRETTY NICELY RIGHT NOW IN TERMS

3950
02:43:32,635 --> 02:43:35,071
OF PROFITABILITY.

3951
02:43:35,071 --> 02:43:35,839
THEY ARE NOT SUFFERING VERY

3952
02:43:35,839 --> 02:43:37,707
MUCH.

3953
02:43:37,707 --> 02:43:39,809
THEY WOULD BE BETTER OFF

3954
02:43:39,809 --> 02:43:40,610
INTEREST RATE WERE HIGHER, BUT

3955
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:42,912
THEY ARE NOT SUFFERING SEVERELY

3956
02:43:42,912 --> 02:43:43,646
FROM A LOW INTEREST RATE

3957
02:43:43,646 --> 02:43:44,080
ENVIRONMENT.

3958
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:46,750
TOM: YOU AND YOUR STAFF COUPLE

3959
02:43:46,750 --> 02:43:47,650
ELUDED A TERMINAL VALUE FOR THE

3960
02:43:47,650 --> 02:43:51,221
AMERICAN ECONOMY.

3961
02:43:51,221 --> 02:43:55,926
MITSUBISHI IS WAY BELOW 2%.

3962
02:43:55,926 --> 02:44:01,064
TERMINAL GROWTH, POTENTIAL GDP,

3963
02:44:01,064 --> 02:44:04,034
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

3964
02:44:04,034 --> 02:44:09,039
THE BASIC IDEA, IS THIS A NEW

3965
02:44:09,039 --> 02:44:11,074
AMERICA, A SUB 2% AMERICA?

3966
02:44:11,074 --> 02:44:14,210
ALAN: I NOTED WITH INTEREST THAT

3967
02:44:14,210 --> 02:44:20,116
THE FED HAS STUCK TO ITS 2% GDP

3968
02:44:20,116 --> 02:44:20,917
GROWTH RATE IN THE LONGER RUN

3969
02:44:20,917 --> 02:44:24,254
COLUMN ON THE PROJECTIONS.

3970
02:44:24,254 --> 02:44:26,923
THEY HAVE COME DOWN A BIT OVER

3971
02:44:26,923 --> 02:44:27,724
THE LAST TWO YEARS BUT I DO NOT

3972
02:44:27,724 --> 02:44:28,558
THINK ENOUGH.

3973
02:44:28,558 --> 02:44:30,493
THE MAIN PART OF THAT GROWTH

3974
02:44:30,493 --> 02:44:32,596
RATE IS PRODUCTIVITY.

3975
02:44:32,596 --> 02:44:36,967
IT IS NOT POPULATION GROWTH.

3976
02:44:36,967 --> 02:44:37,801
LABOR FORCE GROWING SLOWLY AND

3977
02:44:37,801 --> 02:44:38,768
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

3978
02:44:38,768 --> 02:44:39,502
THAT KIND OF A NUMBER IS

3979
02:44:39,502 --> 02:44:51,981
CONSISTENT WITH ROUGHLY EIGHT

3980
02:44:51,981 --> 02:44:55,018
1.7% ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH

3981
02:44:55,018 --> 02:44:55,418
RATE.

3982
02:44:55,418 --> 02:44:56,152
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE

3983
02:44:56,152 --> 02:44:56,820
BEEN DOING ONE HALF OF 1%

3984
02:44:56,820 --> 02:44:57,487
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATE.

3985
02:44:57,487 --> 02:44:58,221
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE

3986
02:44:58,221 --> 02:44:58,955
WILL BRING, NEITHER DOES JANET

3987
02:44:58,955 --> 02:45:00,557
YELLEN, BUT TO ME, AN ASSUMPTION

3988
02:45:00,557 --> 02:45:02,392
THAT RELATIVELY SOON WE'RE GOING

3989
02:45:02,392 --> 02:45:04,461
TO SEE PRODUCTIVITY GROWING AT

3990
02:45:04,461 --> 02:45:07,564
1.7% LOOKS QUITE AGGRESSIVE TO

3991
02:45:07,564 --> 02:45:09,599
ME.

3992
02:45:09,599 --> 02:45:13,570
I WOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN THAT.

3993
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:21,144
MIKE: THE FED IS ABOUT THERE,

3994
02:45:21,144 --> 02:45:21,978
BUT THAT YOU LOOK AT INFLATION

3995
02:45:21,978 --> 02:45:24,114
EXPECTATIONS.

3996
02:45:24,114 --> 02:45:24,881
WE HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS

3997
02:45:24,881 --> 02:45:28,118
CONSUMERS AND WALL STREET VIEW.

3998
02:45:28,118 --> 02:45:28,885
THEY ARE NOT GOING IN THIS

3999
02:45:28,885 --> 02:45:32,255
DIRECTION.

4000
02:45:32,255 --> 02:45:33,123
WE WILL THIS OUT FOR EVERYONE TO

4001
02:45:33,123 --> 02:45:35,158
LOOK AT, BUT THE MARKET STILL

4002
02:45:35,158 --> 02:45:35,859
DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT.

4003
02:45:35,859 --> 02:45:41,131
>> THE MARKET I THINK IS MORE

4004
02:45:41,131 --> 02:45:41,932
WILLING TO LOOK AT GLOBAL

4005
02:45:41,932 --> 02:45:44,100
DEVELOPMENTS AND TAKE SIGNALS

4006
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:45,735
FROM WHAT IS GOING ON IN JAPAN,

4007
02:45:45,735 --> 02:45:47,637
WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR AREA,

4008
02:45:47,637 --> 02:45:51,474
POTENTIAL RISKS FROM CHINA.

4009
02:45:51,474 --> 02:45:52,175
DOCTORS ALSO NEED TO BE

4010
02:45:52,175 --> 02:45:52,976
CONSIDERED ONLY LOOK AT THE U.S.

4011
02:45:52,976 --> 02:45:53,376
ECONOMY.

4012
02:45:53,376 --> 02:45:58,181
IN MY VIEW, WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

4013
02:45:58,181 --> 02:45:59,749
U.S. ECONOMY WE DO IT FROM A

4014
02:45:59,749 --> 02:46:00,583
U.S.-CENTRIC PERSPECTIVE, WHICH

4015
02:46:00,583 --> 02:46:01,417
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THE RIGHT

4016
02:46:01,417 --> 02:46:02,052
WAY.

4017
02:46:02,052 --> 02:46:06,723
BUT THE WAY BECOME HIS ARE

4018
02:46:06,723 --> 02:46:07,524
UNFOLDING MORE BROADLY, THAT IS

4019
02:46:07,524 --> 02:46:07,924
CHANGING.

4020
02:46:07,924 --> 02:46:09,826
I THINK MARKETS MAY BE

4021
02:46:09,826 --> 02:46:13,630
INDICATORS OF WHERE THE

4022
02:46:13,630 --> 02:46:14,397
ECONOMICS LOOKS AT THE U.S.

4023
02:46:14,397 --> 02:46:15,231
ECONOMY WILL BE GOING FOR IT.

4024
02:46:15,231 --> 02:46:20,770
MIKE: YOU SEE THEM STILL BURNING

4025
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:21,538
DISINFLATION INTO THE UNITED

4026
02:46:21,538 --> 02:46:21,905
STATES?

4027
02:46:21,905 --> 02:46:25,608
SHAHAB: THAT IS THE SIGNAL THE

4028
02:46:25,608 --> 02:46:28,645
MARKETS ARE GIVING RIGHT NOW.

4029
02:46:28,645 --> 02:46:29,746
THERE IS DIFFICULTY FOR MARKET

4030
02:46:29,746 --> 02:46:30,580
OBSERVERS TO SEE WHAT IS REALLY

4031
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:32,415
GOING ON IN CHINA, WHAT IS

4032
02:46:32,415 --> 02:46:34,651
REALLY GOING ON IN EUROPE.

4033
02:46:34,651 --> 02:46:35,485
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

4034
02:46:35,485 --> 02:46:37,987
TRANSPARENT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW

4035
02:46:37,987 --> 02:46:41,124
IS THAT THE MARKET PERIODICALLY

4036
02:46:41,124 --> 02:46:41,958
AS LARGE PICKUPS IN RELATION TO

4037
02:46:41,958 --> 02:46:44,928
THOSE ISSUES AND MANY OF THE

4038
02:46:44,928 --> 02:46:45,795
PROBLEMS THEY POSE HAVE NOT GONE

4039
02:46:45,795 --> 02:46:47,597
AWAY AT ALL.

4040
02:46:47,597 --> 02:46:49,065
LET'S IMAGINE YOU GET A BREXIT

4041
02:46:49,065 --> 02:46:50,366
OUTCOME AND U.K., WHAT THEN

4042
02:46:50,366 --> 02:46:55,071
HAPPENS TO YOUR ECONOMY?

4043
02:46:55,071 --> 02:46:55,872
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE NO

4044
02:46:55,872 --> 02:46:56,539
MEANS ASSAULT AND IT IS

4045
02:46:56,539 --> 02:46:58,808
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO IMAGINE THEY

4046
02:46:58,808 --> 02:46:59,542
WILL BECOME INCONSEQUENTIAL

4047
02:46:59,542 --> 02:47:00,643
GOING FORWARD.

4048
02:47:00,643 --> 02:47:06,082
TOM: YOU HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER

4049
02:47:06,082 --> 02:47:07,750
OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY POLITICS,

4050
02:47:07,750 --> 02:47:08,518
YOU ARE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF

4051
02:47:08,518 --> 02:47:12,155
JOHN KERRY.

4052
02:47:12,155 --> 02:47:12,956
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO SECRETARY

4053
02:47:12,956 --> 02:47:15,325
CLINTON AND SPECIFICALLY, HAVE

4054
02:47:15,325 --> 02:47:16,993
YOU SPOKEN TO SECRETARY CLINTON

4055
02:47:16,993 --> 02:47:17,760
ABOUT A RENEWED FISCAL POLICY?

4056
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:21,965
ALAN: I HAVE NOT COME I AM NOT

4057
02:47:21,965 --> 02:47:23,566
SPOKEN TO HER AT ALL RECENTLY,

4058
02:47:23,566 --> 02:47:26,970
SHE HAS BEEN A VERY BUSY PERSON.

4059
02:47:26,970 --> 02:47:28,538
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

4060
02:47:28,538 --> 02:47:29,606
YOU TALK ABOUT AFTER A CAMPAIGN

4061
02:47:29,606 --> 02:47:32,308
IS OVER.

4062
02:47:32,308 --> 02:47:33,042
WE MIGHT NEED IT, IT IS

4063
02:47:33,042 --> 02:47:34,010
POSSIBLE.

4064
02:47:34,010 --> 02:47:38,848
MY BEST GUESS NOW IS THAT WE

4065
02:47:38,848 --> 02:47:41,484
WON'T, BUT I DO NOT HOLD THAT

4066
02:47:41,484 --> 02:47:42,218
GUESTS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF

4067
02:47:42,218 --> 02:47:44,187
CONFIDENCE.

4068
02:47:44,187 --> 02:47:45,054
THAT COULD BE WRONG AND WE COULD

4069
02:47:45,054 --> 02:47:47,090
NEED A FISCAL STIMULUS DOWN THE

4070
02:47:47,090 --> 02:47:50,193
ROAD.

4071
02:47:50,193 --> 02:47:51,928
WHETHER WE CAN GET ONE THROUGH

4072
02:47:51,928 --> 02:47:53,129
CONGRESS IS ANOTHER QUESTION

4073
02:47:53,129 --> 02:47:53,896
ENTIRELY AND WILL DEPEND ON

4074
02:47:53,896 --> 02:47:55,198
OTHER THINGS, ON THE OUTCOME OF

4075
02:47:55,198 --> 02:48:01,103
THE ELECTION.

4076
02:48:01,103 --> 02:48:04,974
MIKE: I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD TO

4077
02:48:04,974 --> 02:48:08,044
THE LAST POINT.

4078
02:48:08,044 --> 02:48:10,213
I THINK THE MARKETS OF GOTTEN A

4079
02:48:10,213 --> 02:48:13,483
LITTLE TOO MODERN.

4080
02:48:13,483 --> 02:48:14,317
YES, WE ARE INFLUENCED BY JAPAN

4081
02:48:14,317 --> 02:48:16,719
AND CHINA IN EUROPE, AND SO ON,

4082
02:48:16,719 --> 02:48:17,954
BUT EXCHANGE RATES ARE GLOATING

4083
02:48:17,954 --> 02:48:21,591
AND THAT LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM

4084
02:48:21,591 --> 02:48:26,362
FOR DIVERGES AND INFLATION RATES

4085
02:48:26,362 --> 02:48:28,565
IN THE U.S. VERSUS EUROPE.

4086
02:48:28,565 --> 02:48:29,399
I DO NOT PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT IN

4087
02:48:29,399 --> 02:48:34,103
PROJECTING U.S. INFLATION ON THE

4088
02:48:34,103 --> 02:48:34,871
INFLATION RATE IN EUROPE OR

4089
02:48:34,871 --> 02:48:39,608
JAPAN, FOR EXAMPLE.

4090
02:48:39,608 --> 02:48:45,948
TOM: VICE CHAIRMAN BLINDER, IS

4091
02:48:45,948 --> 02:48:46,716
HE CRATERING THE MARKET RIGHT

4092
02:48:46,716 --> 02:48:47,016
NOW?

4093
02:48:47,016 --> 02:48:50,520
MIKE: HE WAS TRYING TO BE

4094
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:53,389
OPTIMISTIC, I THINK.

4095
02:48:53,389 --> 02:48:57,827
ALAN: I DO NOT THINK I HAVE THAT

4096
02:48:57,827 --> 02:48:58,428
POWER ANYMORE.

4097
02:48:58,428 --> 02:49:05,134
TOM: PUSH AGAINST VICE CHAIRMAN

4098
02:49:05,134 --> 02:49:06,736
BLINDER, IF YOU WOULD, AS YOU DO

4099
02:49:06,736 --> 02:49:07,403
WITH GREAT RESPECT, THE

4100
02:49:07,403 --> 02:49:10,540
ECONOMICS OF SAY ALAN MELZER OF

4101
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:11,341
CARNEGIE MELLON AND OTHERS WHO

4102
02:49:11,341 --> 02:49:12,508
SAY THAT THE MARKET TAKE CARE OF

4103
02:49:12,508 --> 02:49:14,544
ITSELF.

4104
02:49:14,544 --> 02:49:18,681
THE BASIC IDEA IS, LEAVE THE

4105
02:49:18,681 --> 02:49:19,449
MARKETS ALONE, EVERYTHING WILL

4106
02:49:19,449 --> 02:49:19,916
BE FINE.

4107
02:49:19,916 --> 02:49:20,683
WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT METER

4108
02:49:20,683 --> 02:49:22,852
RIGHT NOW?

4109
02:49:22,852 --> 02:49:23,753
DO WE NEED TO BE INTRUSIVE OR

4110
02:49:23,753 --> 02:49:24,187
NOT?

4111
02:49:24,187 --> 02:49:27,590
ALAN: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

4112
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:28,558
MONETARY POLICY.

4113
02:49:28,558 --> 02:49:32,428
I THINK WE NEED, OR AT LEAST

4114
02:49:32,428 --> 02:49:35,765
SHOULD BE INFORMATIVE.

4115
02:49:35,765 --> 02:49:39,268
THAT IS, MARKETS IN THE PAST

4116
02:49:39,268 --> 02:49:43,573
OFTEN FLEW OFF ON TANGENTS

4117
02:49:43,573 --> 02:49:44,374
MAKING EXTRAPOLATIONS ABOUT WHAT

4118
02:49:44,374 --> 02:49:46,409
THEY THOUGHT THE FED WAS GOING

4119
02:49:46,409 --> 02:49:49,979
TO DO THAT WERE VERY POORLY MORE

4120
02:49:49,979 --> 02:49:50,446
IN REALITY.

4121
02:49:50,446 --> 02:49:55,185
-- MOORED IN REALITY.

4122
02:49:55,185 --> 02:49:55,985
IT IS MUCH HARDER TO DO THAT

4123
02:49:55,985 --> 02:49:57,053
NOW.

4124
02:49:57,053 --> 02:49:57,920
THE MARKETS CANNOT GET EXACTLY

4125
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:00,656
WHERE THE FED'S RATES WILL BE

4126
02:50:00,656 --> 02:50:01,090
RIGHT NOW.

4127
02:50:01,090 --> 02:50:04,861
THE FED DOESN'T KNOW THAT

4128
02:50:04,861 --> 02:50:05,261
EITHER.

4129
02:50:05,261 --> 02:50:07,430
BUT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT

4130
02:50:07,430 --> 02:50:08,698
BELIEVE IN THE MARKETS BECOME

4131
02:50:08,698 --> 02:50:10,867
TOTALLY UNHINGED FROM FEDERAL

4132
02:50:10,867 --> 02:50:12,936
RESERVE REALITY ARE SEVERELY

4133
02:50:12,936 --> 02:50:14,570
DIMINISHED BY THE GREATER

4134
02:50:14,570 --> 02:50:21,911
COMMUNICATIVE THIS --I WILL GIVE

4135
02:50:21,911 --> 02:50:23,279
YOU AN EXAMPLE, BACK IN THE DAY

4136
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:24,113
WHEN I WAS VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE

4137
02:50:24,113 --> 02:50:28,651
FED, AND THIS IS WHEN THE FED

4138
02:50:28,651 --> 02:50:30,153
WAS VERY QUIET AND SAID NOTHING

4139
02:50:30,153 --> 02:50:34,390
ABOUT ITS BOARD INTENTIONS.

4140
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:35,258
I WAS AGGRAVATED THAT THE MARKET

4141
02:50:35,258 --> 02:50:40,730
BUT THE FED RATE WAS GOING TO 8%

4142
02:50:40,730 --> 02:50:41,464
AND MOST OF US INSIDE THE

4143
02:50:41,464 --> 02:50:42,265
BUILDING THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY

4144
02:50:42,265 --> 02:50:46,202
TO GO HIGHER THAN 6%, BUT WE

4145
02:50:46,202 --> 02:50:48,237
SAID NOTHING OFFICIALLY TO BRING

4146
02:50:48,237 --> 02:50:51,307
THE MARKETS EXPECTATIONS DOWN.

4147
02:50:51,307 --> 02:50:53,342
EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME DOWN

4148
02:50:53,342 --> 02:50:59,549
AND THE RATE TOPPED OUT AT 6%,

4149
02:50:59,549 --> 02:51:00,316
BUT WE LET THAT MISCONCEPTION

4150
02:51:00,316 --> 02:51:01,117
SIT THERE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS.

4151
02:51:01,117 --> 02:51:03,553
THE FED DOESN'T DO THAT

4152
02:51:03,553 --> 02:51:03,953
ANYMORE.

4153
02:51:03,953 --> 02:51:07,690
MIKE: THEY GIVE US REASONABLY

4154
02:51:07,690 --> 02:51:08,524
EXPLICIT GUIDANCE.

4155
02:51:08,524 --> 02:51:13,329
I WILL ASK YOU BOTH, THIS --

4156
02:51:13,329 --> 02:51:14,130
DOES FORWARD GUIDANCE WORK AT

4157
02:51:14,130 --> 02:51:16,699
THIS POINT?

4158
02:51:16,699 --> 02:51:20,603
IS IT USEFUL IF THE FED CANNOT

4159
02:51:20,603 --> 02:51:24,474
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, AND WE DO NOT

4160
02:51:24,474 --> 02:51:25,608
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

4161
02:51:25,608 --> 02:51:26,843
WITH ALL THESE GLOBAL

4162
02:51:26,843 --> 02:51:27,643
DEVELOPMENTS THAT KEEP POPPING

4163
02:51:27,643 --> 02:51:27,944
UP?

4164
02:51:27,944 --> 02:51:32,915
ALAN: I THINK IT IS VERY USEFUL.

4165
02:51:32,915 --> 02:51:35,852
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN

4166
02:51:35,852 --> 02:51:38,087
CONTROLLING.

4167
02:51:38,087 --> 02:51:39,822
THE MARKET HAS LOOK AT PAST

4168
02:51:39,822 --> 02:51:42,792
HISTORY, CORRECTLY SEEN THAT THE

4169
02:51:42,792 --> 02:51:45,928
FED HAS OVERESTIMATED THE

4170
02:51:45,928 --> 02:51:48,865
STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY,

4171
02:51:48,865 --> 02:51:54,203
CONCLUSIVELY OVERESTIMATING AND

4172
02:51:54,203 --> 02:51:55,038
EXPRESSING THIS BELIEF IN THAT

4173
02:51:55,038 --> 02:51:57,006
FORECAST.

4174
02:51:57,006 --> 02:51:59,842
THAT IS FINE.

4175
02:51:59,842 --> 02:52:02,245
WHAT YOU LIKE THE MARKETS TO DO

4176
02:52:02,245 --> 02:52:03,279
IS PROCESSING A LOT OF

4177
02:52:03,279 --> 02:52:04,046
INFORMATION, INCLUDING WHAT

4178
02:52:04,046 --> 02:52:08,584
COMES OUT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

4179
02:52:08,584 --> 02:52:09,385
, AND MAKE ITS OWN JUDGMENTS.

4180
02:52:09,385 --> 02:52:10,219
THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE GET PAID TO

4181
02:52:10,219 --> 02:52:11,154
DO, AND THAT IS FINE.

4182
02:52:11,154 --> 02:52:11,954
I THINK IT IS GOOD.

4183
02:52:11,954 --> 02:52:17,560
SHAHAB: IT IS CERTAINLY USEFUL

4184
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:18,394
IN TERMS OF SETTING A FRAMEWORK

4185
02:52:18,394 --> 02:52:19,095
FOR THE MARKET TO LOOK AT

4186
02:52:19,095 --> 02:52:19,462
EVENTS.

4187
02:52:19,462 --> 02:52:21,864
HAVING SAID THAT, IT IS

4188
02:52:21,864 --> 02:52:25,167
INTERESTING ME TO TALK ABOUT

4189
02:52:25,167 --> 02:52:29,438
ISSUES LIKE CHINA, LIKE BREXIT,

4190
02:52:29,438 --> 02:52:30,239
ISSUES THAT CLEARLY NOBODY HAS A

4191
02:52:30,239 --> 02:52:31,040
HANDLE ON IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND

4192
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:34,911
OF REACTION THEY WILL ELICIT AN

4193
02:52:34,911 --> 02:52:39,015
THE MARKET OR THE ECONOMY.

4194
02:52:39,015 --> 02:52:39,849
BUT STILL HAVE FORECAST SO MUCH

4195
02:52:39,849 --> 02:52:40,650
HIGHER THAN WHERE THE MARKET IS.

4196
02:52:40,650 --> 02:52:42,418
THE MARKET IS GIVING INFORMATION

4197
02:52:42,418 --> 02:52:43,252
TO POLICYMAKERS AS WELL AS MUCH

4198
02:52:43,252 --> 02:52:48,791
AT HIS TELLING POLICYMAKERS --

4199
02:52:48,791 --> 02:52:49,592
THOSE TELL RISKS HAS SEVERE

4200
02:52:49,592 --> 02:52:50,059
AFFECTS.

4201
02:52:50,059 --> 02:52:52,061
THIS GAP BETWEEN THE MARKETS AND

4202
02:52:52,061 --> 02:52:54,730
THE POLICYMAKERS DOES RAISE SOME

4203
02:52:54,730 --> 02:52:55,164
QUESTIONS.

4204
02:52:55,164 --> 02:52:59,068
TOM: WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

4205
02:52:59,068 --> 02:52:59,802
ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND

4206
02:52:59,802 --> 02:53:01,838
BLOOMBERG RADIO.

4207
02:53:01,838 --> 02:53:02,672
PROFESSOR BLINDER, WE SHOW THIS

4208
02:53:02,672 --> 02:53:06,442
CHART EARLIER OF COLUMBIA AND

4209
02:53:06,442 --> 02:53:09,278
NOW PIMCO AND WE DID THIS AND --

4210
02:53:09,278 --> 02:53:15,818
THE BASIC IDEA OF THEM LOOKING

4211
02:53:15,818 --> 02:53:19,188
AT THE OVERSHOOT -- YOU

4212
02:53:19,188 --> 02:53:21,691
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, THE IDEA

4213
02:53:21,691 --> 02:53:38,407
OF A FED THAT WILL OVERSHOOT.

4214
02:53:38,407 --> 02:53:41,477
I'M GOING TO SAY SIX YEARS AGO,

4215
02:53:41,477 --> 02:53:42,078
WE NEED TO REFLATE.

4216
02:53:42,078 --> 02:53:42,812
IN YOUR READING OF ECONOMICS,

4217
02:53:42,812 --> 02:53:43,479
CAN YOU REFLATE A SOCIETY?

4218
02:53:43,479 --> 02:53:44,180
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

4219
02:53:44,180 --> 02:53:44,947
BERNANKE -- CAN THEY REFLATE AN

4220
02:53:44,947 --> 02:53:45,848
ECONOMY?

4221
02:53:45,848 --> 02:53:51,420
ALAN: THERE IS LOTS OF EVIDENCE

4222
02:53:51,420 --> 02:53:52,254
FROM THE PAST BUT IN THOSE PAST

4223
02:53:52,254 --> 02:53:53,823
EPISODES, THE CENTRAL BANKS

4224
02:53:53,823 --> 02:54:00,630
RARELY, IF EVER, FACED THE --WE

4225
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:02,131
USED TO CALL IT THE ZERO LOWER

4226
02:54:02,131 --> 02:54:03,099
BOUND, NOW WE KNOW WE CAN GO

4227
02:54:03,099 --> 02:54:07,336
NEGATIVE.

4228
02:54:07,336 --> 02:54:08,104
IN THESE PAST EPISODES OF

4229
02:54:08,104 --> 02:54:11,140
REFLATION, THE EFFECT OF LOWER

4230
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:15,578
BOUND WAS ALMOST NEVER A FACTOR.

4231
02:54:15,578 --> 02:54:17,313
WE JUST WERE NEVER ANYWHERE NEAR

4232
02:54:17,313 --> 02:54:20,116
IT, THEREFORE IT WAS NEVER AN

4233
02:54:20,116 --> 02:54:21,384
EFFECTIVE CONSTRAINT.

4234
02:54:21,384 --> 02:54:24,520
WITH THE EFFECT OF LOWER BOUND,

4235
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:25,354
THE CENTRAL BANK IS CONSTRAINED

02:54:25,354 --> 02:54:26,355
TO WEAKER INSTRUMENTS, AS WE NOW

4237
02:54:26,355 --> 02:54:28,491
KNOW.

4238
02:54:28,491 --> 02:54:30,226
AND WE ALSO NOW KNOW THAT IT

4239
02:54:30,226 --> 02:54:32,795
TAKES, TO USE A TECHNICAL TERM,

4240
02:54:32,795 --> 02:54:37,333
A HELL OF A LOT OF QUANTITATIVE

4241
02:54:37,333 --> 02:54:41,904
EASING FOR 1% CHANGE OF INTEREST

4242
02:54:41,904 --> 02:54:42,304
RATES.

4243
02:54:42,304 --> 02:54:47,476
THAT IS WHERE THE FED WOUND UP,

4244
02:54:47,476 --> 02:54:48,444
AND THAT MEANS THEY HAVE LESS

4245
02:54:48,444 --> 02:54:51,481
POWER IN THE CURRENT

4246
02:54:51,481 --> 02:54:54,450
CIRCUMSTANCES TO REFLATE AN

4247
02:54:54,450 --> 02:54:56,752
ECONOMY THAN THEY ARE USED TO

4248
02:54:56,752 --> 02:54:57,553
AND HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED,

4249
02:54:57,553 --> 02:54:59,589
HISTORICALLY, TO HAVE.

4250
02:54:59,589 --> 02:55:05,695
MIKE: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

4251
02:55:05,695 --> 02:55:09,765
OBVIOUSLY, IF THE SKY FALLS, THE

4252
02:55:09,765 --> 02:55:10,533
BRITISH MOVE OUT ANY MARKET

4253
02:55:10,533 --> 02:55:11,333
FALLS APART, THAT IS ONE THING.

4254
02:55:11,333 --> 02:55:14,603
THE FED IS NOW ON HOLD FROM HERE

4255
02:55:14,603 --> 02:55:15,604
UNTIL PROBABLY DECEMBER, WHAT IS

4256
02:55:15,604 --> 02:55:17,073
THE TRADE, WHERE DO WE GO?

4257
02:55:17,073 --> 02:55:22,011
SHAHAB: THIS MIGHT BE NEGATIVE

4258
02:55:22,011 --> 02:55:22,778

ECONOMY IS GOING, ON A TECHNICAL

4261
02:55:26,849 --> 02:55:30,820
BASIS, AT THAT POINT I SUGGEST

4262
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:31,520
GETTING BACK INTO RISK,

4263
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:33,956
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, THE U.K.

4264
02:55:33,956 --> 02:55:34,557
DECIDES TO REMAIN.

4265
02:55:34,557 --> 02:55:36,959
BUT THE MARKET COULD MOVE AFTER

4266
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:40,796

4267
02:55:40,796 --> 02:55:41,931

4268
02:55:41,931 --> 02:55:46,368

4269

4272
