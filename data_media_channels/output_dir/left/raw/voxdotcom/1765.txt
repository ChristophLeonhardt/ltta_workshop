1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,910
This is Eureka, Missouri, a city that floods
repeatedly.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,510
We’re talking catastrophic floods, twice
in less than two years.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,239
“Yet more rain and dangerous flooding are
affecting parts of the Midwest and South tonight.”

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,390
“Take you across the Meramec River, notorious
for flooding very quickly.”

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,869
“Towns like Eureka, and others, well they’re
in for a rough few days.”

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,390
But, just 12 miles downstream is a town called
Valley Park.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,390
It stayed pretty dry thanks to a levee.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,870
A giant artificial embankment that surrounds
the city, designed to keep water out.

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,550
Valley Park got their levee  largely because
the city was willing and able to pay for it.

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,850
It kept their own town dry but here’s what
flooding looked like in neighboring towns,

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,860
including Eureka, that didn’t have levees.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,520
“The valley Park levee withstood the water.”

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,340
“That levee holding could be part of the
problem.”

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,289
“They suspected the same levee that protected
Valley Park may have been to blame for devastating

15
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,080
flooding in Fenton, Eureka, and Arnold.”

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,180
Can a levee protect one town while making
flooding worse for others -- especially towns

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,780
that can't afford a levee?

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,840
A fluid mechanics lab, a 13-foot long model
of a river, and some adorable tiny houses

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
will help us find out.

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,760
People love levees.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,120
There’s about 100,000 miles of these embankments
across the US.

22
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,470
Sometimes concrete, sometimes earthen for
centuries, we’ve built them between humans

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,340
and rivers.

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,440
We even write songs about them.

25
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,280
But it turns out, even when levees are effective,
they can still be devastating.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,159
As far back as 1852, levees came with a very
important warning.

27
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,660
Charles Ellet Jr. - a famed US civil engineer
- cautioned that levees confine rivers and

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,030
cause them to "rise higher and flow faster."

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,320
And relying on levees “encourages a false
security.”

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,980
But he was largely ignored.

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,180
Levees became the default for flood control
- mostly funded and constructed by local entities.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,450
Some riverside communities that could afford
it, built taller levees for more protection,

33
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,540
while less fortunate neighbors dealt with
the devastating effects.

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,120
To show you what we mean we went to the banks
of the Mississippi River.

35
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,989
To a fluid mechanics lab, where a team of
engineers from the University of Minnesota

36
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,879
built us this landscape model to test flood
scenarios.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,500
Overhead, a scanner collects 3D data to measure
exactly what’s happening.

38
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,610
It’s a generic model of a river with no
levees.

39
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,700
That means, when the water level increases,
it overflows.

40
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,920
And spreads across the floodplain, often creating
important wetland habitat that’s home to

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,580
a variety of species.

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,070
Putting in levees cuts rivers off from this
land, destroying floodplains and wetlands.

43
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,080
It allows people to convert these areas into
farmland or build houses on them.

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,200
And while levees protect these communities
from flooding, they constrict the river into

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,120
a narrow channel, making the water flow faster
and higher.

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,360
That creates a bottleneck leading to additional
flooding upstream.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,840
If all the levees are the same height, both
sides should be about equally protected from

48
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,510
the average flood.

49
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,440
And if the river rises so much that the water
overtops the levee, then both sides should

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,700
flood pretty equally.

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,739
But let’s say, people on one side of the
river lobby for higher levees.

52
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,920
Now, instead of both sides flooding, only
one floods.

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,140
The side with the lower levees is at a clear
disadvantage.

54
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,820
So what can people in flood zones do?

55
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,610
We can't just pick up and move major cities.

56
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,750
We need levees to protect places like these.

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,020
There is an alternative.

58
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,060
We could build levees farther back, so rivers
could still expand and create wetlands.

59
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,560
These “setback levees” ease flooding on
both sides, rather than protecting one city

60
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,740
at the expense of another.

61
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,090
This approach is common in other parts of
the world - like Holland for example - but

62
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,740
not in the U.S.

63
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,310
Here, we tend to build levees right next to
rivers.

64
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,720
Some communities that can afford to build
higher levees do so at the risk of others

65
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,110
with little oversight.

66
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,410
We do have the Army Corps of Engineers -- a
federal agency tasked with regulating a fraction

67
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,820
of all levees.

68
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,080
They have to ensure -- at least on paper -- that
federal levees won't dramatically raise local

69
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,220
flood levels.

70
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
But those engineering predictions don’t
always match reality.

71
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,400
For instance, the Army Corps designed Valley
Park’s levee in the early 90s with data

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,040
and software from that era.

73
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,920
Engineers estimated the levee’s impact on
neighboring areas would be minimal.

74
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,020
But by the time it was completed in 2005,
the region had grown significantly.

75
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,990
More people had built alongside the river,
increasing the risk of flooding - which wasn’t

76
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,620
considered in the original plan.

77
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,300
While we don’t know the precise impact of
Valley Park’s levee on neighboring towns

78
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,290
just yet, since the levee was built, the region
outside Valley Park has suffered two of the

79
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,949
worst floods in its history.

80
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,900
The Army Corps says they’ve done nothing
wrong, and that the levee meets all state

81
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,270
and federal laws.

82
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,979
But there’s a growing body of research that
shows levees push flooding onto surrounding

83
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:50,150
communities that have lower levees or no
levees at all.

84
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,479
Researchers measured water levels around 13
levees in the Midwest and found they all increased

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,740
flooding -- some by over five feet.

86
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,420
As the climate changes and cities push for
higher levees, flooding is only expected to

87
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,990
get worse.

88
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,669
Especially along the Mississippi River, which
is almost entirely lined with levees.

89
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,260
Some of these embankments have been substantially
raised since their completion, against federal

90
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,280
rules, making flooding worse across the river
and upstream.

91
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,020
So, yes, we need some levees.

92
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,580
But the system for regulating them is broken.

93
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,920
Even though the science overwhelmingly  shows
that constructing higher levees makes flooding

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,400
worse in the long-term.

95
00:06:30,400 --> 00:00:00,000
We keep building them taller, passing our
problems upstream.
