well cup wraps up president Putin's saying a few words at the end of the tour thought isn't something where you just enjoy the spectacle you go for the results but the results were also at a very high level this time so now we can be proud that we have our own football our own football school our own possibilities we can now expect greater results in future tournaments this is what has been shown by our our national team what I especially liked is that our guys have shown great skill and have performed at the highest level possible and I believe this is the important thing this is what we have to be grateful to them for and certainly the result itself was outstanding we have to congratulate them with that so that they achieve even more in the future I going to meet them yes we've already planned a number of meetings first I'm going to meet the manager then the head of the team and that I'll meant meets the the rest of them after hockey you wanted to play hockey don't you want to play football now you know every one of us used to play football at some point in our lives we used to kick balls at some time in our lives and I like to watch football I like to watch some of the best teams playing great games it seems that anyone can play football but of course actual real football requires a lot of practice and skill and I'll stick to hockey because this is what that's what I've been doing in my life well we've seen one very strange ago from the Croatian team but Croatia was playing a very good very good football of course there were some mishaps but the French have also played incredibly incredibly well we've spoken on many occasions and we've expressed this idea that the most important thing is to organize a great tournament a great World Cup and everyone says that we've been successful now one thing I want to emphasize a lot of the times we say not some of the best things about our fans in our country but it turns out they are not just emotional like they used like they usually are but they're also very responsible and this is why I'd like to say special thanks words of gratitude to our fans for the way they treated the whole event the way they treated the World Cup because it was to a large extent because of our fans I would like to thank our manager our fans our team all the football fans and spectators who helped and supported our team I'd like to thank those who organized who managed and administered the whole thing I'd like to say thanks to heads of hosts cities they were always I could see smiles on the faces of the people who organized the events they were always very hospitable and kind and I wouldn't want to talk about what was said before the tournament now I want to talk about what we hear today thanks to the efforts of thousands of people we've managed to organize to host this wonderful sports festival and I'd like to extend special words of gratitude to to fans from all over the world who came to Russia we're all so great they were also very responsible they have shown that sport and football can unite people not lead to some squabbles but actually unite countries and unite peoples based on shared values a lot of people got acquainted with the culture of Russia with our towns and cities and now millions of people have changed what they think about our country have changed their opinions and with this regard when I spoke to my colleagues from Croatia and France I think that all those foreign fans who have fan IDs will now be able to have visa-free access to Russia up to the end of this year and I hope that many of them will use this opportunity and come to our country once again on multiple occasions and bring their families with them thank you thank you so much you you
