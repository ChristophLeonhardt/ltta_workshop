Jeff thank you for putting the conference together thank you for putting this panel together I think it's really important that we have a discussion about it together and and I don't know that anyone's been more supportive of every pathway to get money out of politics than we have at the Young Turks we've supported almost every group in the field American promise represent us you name it we've supported them we've supported every pathway legislation ballot measures amendments through Congress and an amendment through the states and we call for unity and the group that I started Wolfpack calls for unity in fact there's a letter out now wolf dash pack.com slash unity to make sure that everyone in the movement is fighting together instead of against each other I think that most people here would agree with that unfortunately that's not always the case as you'll see in this discussion so the one area where we do have disagreement is the convention so it's easy to say let's do legislation and I support every attempt at legislation in this Congress in this Congress you're gonna get legislation okay then you're gonna get 67 senators to call for an amendment does anyone anyone believe that's possible so alright Ben god bless your heart okay all right let the record note that three Americans raised their hands so for our friends who believe a convention is too risky I like to state for the record what I think almost every progressive in the country knows we are not winning we're it's not 2114 to use a football analogy it's 49 nothing we're getting slaughtered now I remember the first discussion I had in this case with common cause and I asked okay what is the alternative if you're not going to go to the States and it was two things one was demographic changes I don't know if that takes two or three decades I don't know how many decades that takes the other one was the Supreme Court how's that working out so that is in my opinion and I think the opinion shared by a lot but we'll have the discussion not a very viable path and it can be overturned by the next Supreme Court there is only one thing that cannot be overturned that is a constitutional amendment and unfortunately there's only one pathway right now to get that constitutional amendment and that is to go to the states now I have great news for you at the state level the corruption is not anywhere near the level it is at the national so in the national level the corruption is nearly complete I would argue for the Republican Party it is at least 98 percent unfortunately for the Democratic Party we could argue over percentages but 80 percent is not a bad figure so it is nearly impossible to get them who are wedded to money in politics who got their power through that money in politics who won in this corrupt system to say oh yeah golly gee I guess you're right I'll change that system but at the state level they do not have national power and they are more responsive to their voters and because they represent smaller and smaller number of voters and those voters are overwhelmingly on our side both Democratic and Republican voters they are ninety-three percent believed that politicians represent their donors and not their voters they believe that unfortunately our democracy has become completely corrupted so to tackle the convention issue as quickly as I can obviously that's why I think strategically it is absolutely necessary and then of course people say well there are risks if you're winning and you're up 28-nothing don't take any risks run up the middle get your yard and a half and punt right but what since we began that conversation not just with common cause but with everybody in all the different groups what has happened we have lost a thousand seats at the state level making it much harder we've lost the House of Representatives who lost the Senate and we lost the presidency to Donald Trump every day that we don't do something is a day we fall further behind while people tell us it's too risky to act it is far far riskier not to act in every possible way to get to that amendment and in in terms of those so-called risks right now they say well what if there's a unlimited convention well there there are enough calls for an unlimited commission right now so we'll get into the specifics of that as we as we go here and they have not done it there are enough calls to call for a convention right now they have not done it so it is not true that you could have an unlimited Commission it's just not and everything that a convention does is to propose an amendment that is also in arguable you can read article 5 for yourself article 5 says that a cat whatever is proposed either through Congress or a convention must be ratified by three-quarters of the states it is one of the hardest combative constitutions in the world to amend you must get three-quarters of the states to ratify lucky for us we represent the only issue in the country that three-quarters of the states actually agree to which is that money in politics has corrupted and nearly destroyed our democracy let's take it to the voters of the state level and that is our pathway to victory thank you thank you so thank you jack and I just so you know no one thinks the American promise is naive I'm always happy to be the only one in the room to raise a hand if I think it's right and and Ben grubitz had his hand up there too and I want to say why we don't think there's 67 senators in the Congress right now who are going to do this or 290 members in the house but we do believe in the American people and we believe in you and we and I and and us in our ability to make Congress do what it may not want to do now but we'll be forced to do if we build this movement strong enough and I just want to give a little history before turn it to Vicki to address the concerns that caused her to oppose the use of a convention call but I guarantee you the women who went to Tennessee who to win ratification of the 19th amendment that bill moyers described a few minutes ago did not have a strategy in you know ten years before that happened oh let's just go and ask the all-male unelected Senate to have 2/3 of them give us the right to vote and oh here's another idea while we're there let's ask that to two-thirds of the unelected Senate to do another amendment that says we're gonna elect senators that would have been crazy but if I were there then I would raise my hand and say damn right because that's correct it's what we have to do and it's what we're gonna do now and just like us now they had people who said we got to have a convention the Senate and Congress they're never gonna do it and they had people saying are you kidding me a convention is a really bad idea so their position of American promise the view that the theory is we are in a system and we need everybody doing what they think is the right thing to move this forward and that's what we believe in and that's what we believe is going to cause every but just like all other amendments 27 amendments every one of them came out 2/3 of Congress ratified by three-quarters of the state and it wasn't because they stood down on other strategies it's that's the outcome and that's the outcome we believe in so that's right we have American promise members on both sides of this argument and are quite comfortable with that it's not up to us to say which what you have to believe it's up to us to help you get the information you need so you can move this forward and Viki Harrison has been in this for some years and we have moved it forward in New Mexico and without a convention call and you have in common cause has opposed convention calls and sought to stop them in favor of a straight congressional strategy on the amendment could you tell us why that is what your concerns are sure how about the con side of the con con I'm going to turn that into my new tagline thanks for having me here and as jeff says I'm with common cause New Mexico I have been the IDI out there for about six and a half years and in 2012 we became the second state to ask Congress to do something about citizens united we got tired of them not doing anything so we did it again this year and I can understand the concerns that people say why would you think that Congress would do anything why would you think this Congress would do anything and I quite frankly as somebody who does work in the States would say the same thing about state legislators why would we expect them to do anything I mean citizens united in that decision there was a secondary eight to one decision that said but of course you'll have disclosure I mean yeah we'll just blow the doors off money but of course we'll know where it came from talk to those of us in the states that don't have good disclosure laws who've been fighting for now eight years to get that disclosure that everybody expected so if we can't get state legislators to even agree to disclose where the money comes from it becomes very difficult to get them to say but we're gonna get rid of all that money and so you know yes the threat of a runaway convention is part of it but that's just one piece of our concern around an article five convention all of what the pro side says we feel like are exactly the arguments on the anti side as well special interest we've got you know more than 30 of our states that are run by Republican legislators and Republican governors and I work a lot with Republicans in New Mexico and they want disclosure I mean my polling every year shows that ninety percent of the Republican people in New Mexico want disclosure but that doesn't translate to the state legislature and I wish that I had the same attitude that you know that jenk has about the state legislators that they're smaller and they represent people who are there that's not my experience as an advocate for 25 years in New Mexico and that we would have passed a disclosure bill that five years ago I passed unanimously through the Senate four times and still isn't law and so I think that you know the special interests that run these states as well as Congress is part of our concern we're concerned about what if there's a disagreement at the convention who writes the rules let's say they come up with an amendment what court is in charge of even looking at it you know we talk about you know if we're gonna combine amendments or not I'm telling you on the ground in New Mexico Democrat legislators who want a convention on citizens united will vote for a convention of states and tell you I'm hoping we can combine them and the same thing happens on the other side now and if that's not gonna happen does that mean that every single convention application has to be exactly the same because I don't know about y'all but working in New Mexico you can introduce something it's never gonna look the way you introduced it by the time you finish it this is democracy and state legislators love to dicker around in democracy they think they know more than anybody else and so I think there's a variety of reasons I mean we've written a report called the dangerous path anybody can go on our website and read all of the reasons and I just want to close by thing for this net for now is you know you'll hear a lot about common cause opposing this and it's not just common cause we put together a letter last year and over 250 organizations signed it in fact in New Mexico to fight convention applications I had my partner's all of my union partners and my immigrants rights partners who came to me and asked me for my help in defeating it so you may hear a lot about common cause but there's not just common cause we've got everybody from nail to Scalia saying that's a bad idea so thank you thank you Vicki yes thank you and so let's bring Kent chest egg into the conversation we're very glad to have a law professor who's looked into some of the legal issues around this this isn't something that comes up every day of course in American law or life but can what have you found why are you comfortable with the convention strategy thank you Jeff and Thank You Vicki and Janke before the hearing from everybody so about a year ago a little over a year ago we tried to get this through the winding legislature without success so three of us Shelby Shadwell and Lynn Morrison and I saw him both here in the room and me a few others decided that we would try and put this on the ballot and the first question that we encountered was what are we putting on the ballot are we going to ask pretty please mister Congress can you do this for us or are we going to go all the way and ask for actual voters to weigh in and say yes we want a convention of states because we don't think Congress is going to do it so and we'd heard all the stories all the horror stories about how a convention can run away and there's no rules so they'll make up the rules and they can change immense change the amendment process and everything all those I heard all those things so the first thing we did was do some research to find out are they true what are the risk because we we knew this was going to be a critical decision before we decided to go for or with the petition which way do we go so we did the research and discovered a couple of interesting things first of all that the fear of a convention is bipartisan cross left and right both groups on the left and the right and Vickie's absolutely right - the number of groups on the Left including common cause that oppose it there's groups on the right that opposed it including Alec Alec as opposed to this so it's kind of a strange bedfellow situation but when I did dug into it we finally concluded that the position against the amendment or against the the convention call is wrong for three very important reasons number one it's historically factually wrong the claims about the 1787 convention running away is factually incorrect that is not true but also we felt that these arguments were legally inaccurate which I'll get to in a second but also and this is the key one for us strategically unwise and janko's are already outlined some of the reasons why we think it's strategically unwise so let me just start first by talking about why I think it's historically wrong the argument is that the only convention we ever had was a runaway convention that the Articles of Confederation were the Congress called a convention of states and to amend the Carta khals and instead the convention ran away and it proposed a whole new constitution Constitution which was a runaway convention and that's two points number one if that's true then the Constitution is invalid why are you supporting it right that that didn't make sense but more importantly it's factually not true the Continental Congress did not call that Convention in 1787 here's what actually happened in 1786 Virginia there so the Articles of Confederation were not working there was all kinds of problem most and most of the problems involved commerce between the states they were taxing each other and there was a lot of problems with interstate commerce so there was a convention called by the state of Virginia and only five states showed up but they all agreed that there are problems with the Articles of Confederation and we think we need a much wider country convention involving all the states and dealing with more than just the commerce problem there's a lot of other problems with the Articles that need to be fixed so Virginia called for a convention to meet in Philadelphia in 1787 six other six states joined that and ultimately Congress said if you want to go ahead but Congress did not call it it was actually called by the states so the process there was and actually Congress at that time could not have possibly called for a convention of states because the Articles of Confederation did not include that power did not say that this is a way you can do this so they had to step outside of the Articles of Confederation and called the states themselves called this they met and sentence in Philadelphia and the call was not make some minor changes to the Articles the call was we have we need a general convention if you read last night I read the report from the Annapolis convention in 1786 that said we want a general convention to discuss everything so the state's called for a general convention how can you run away from that that gives the state the convention the power to propose whatever it wanted to propose and it proposed a new canoe Constitution it was not running away from its power it was exercising the power given to it by the states which called for this general convention so that's the first point that the first convention was not a runaway convention it was called by the state's independent of the articles so factually that that point is absolutely incorrect it's legally incorrect I think the the fact that the Constitution doesn't that the current Constitution Article five does not have rules for how a convention should run has been taken by those who oppose the convention to mean therefore there are no rules and the convention can do whatever it wants that's the argument you hear all the time in fact all that means the Constitution's generally don't have those kinds of detailed rules there's lots of stuff the Constitution states states general principles broad principles and then leaves it to other bodies that it creates to come up with the rule so the courts come up with rules Congress writes rules or legislative branch rights rules the Constitution is not a rule based a rule making thing so it's not surprising to me that article 5 doesn't have specific rules for I'll convince you need to find other sources of rules and there are several of them the Due Process Clause is one that we need to honor people's expectations but the biggest one to me is simple common law the common law of agency now I'm a law professor and I can tell you with some Authority I think that this is a typical first-year law school concept when a principal says I want to appoint somebody as my agent to do something that agent has one has only the power given to it by the principal so if the state says I appoint this delegate and we call them delegates they are receiving power from a higher authority of the state I appoint my this delegate to do one thing write an amendment on this issue it doesn't have that agent does not have the right to do anything more than that one thing so legally I think it's impossible for a convention it's legally impossible we're asking the wrong question we ask how can we stop the convention from running away the actual question is what gives it the right to do that in the first place how could it possibly have the right to do something that's not been authorized to do and finally I'll close with this and because Jenks already strategically unwise I think strategically this is the only tool we have that has a chance of success why deprive ourselves of that one tool that we think has a chance for success and a final point there are those and Alec actually does not want to run away convention but there are some on the right who say if we get a convention we're gonna do whatever we want why do we want to give them aid and comfort if we're standing here saying a convince you can run away then the the convention hall that's closest to getting this done is a a right wing side of the balanced budget amendment they're close and if they get the convention they could say hey look all the people on the Left say can run away let's do it let's run away they say we can strategically it's not smart to make that argument I don't think it's possible for a convention to run away it's highly unlikely and I therefore we made the choice at winning promised to go for the convention of states and let's hope we get it thank you okay thank you Ken Craig Clevedon is given a lot of thought to this two different amendments I encourage you to check out renew democracy org right and we've been grateful to him for joining this panel all the way from Montana and let me ask you Craig where do you come out are you satisfied that jenkin can have answered all the issues on this question well certainly not there are two immutable facts that fuel this debate certainly it is the case that without some type of external pressure look at what happened in the historical perspective example of the 17th amendment that's when we ratified the provision that senators would be elected directly by individuals instead of being appointed by the House of Representatives the without nearly successful and in fact some historians say it was actually successful that there were the adequate a number of calls without the pressure of a constitutional convention threat the Senate would have never ratified that bill we would not have direct election of senators without that that's certainly the case but it is also certainly the case that article 5 is short and sweet it certainly also does not define how the convention would take place and in any real fashion there are three aspects that are concerning first off is the call that's the the request to Congress to initiate the Constitutional Convention what is the situation for what would be concerned considered a valid determine call there err no so there are no established rules for that so does the call have to be identical does each call have to be the same undoubtedly if all calls are not the same the calls will be questioned they'll be contested and if they're contested they'll march up to the Supreme Court does anyone here think the Supreme Court will be interested in enabling us to change the Constitution I'm certain not their course is also the call the concern about the content the subject matter of the convention when we talk about a runaway convention what that means is there's we're just putting in subject matter we're asking questions that were not already ratified by the states and the process not ratified but approved by the states in the process to secure ratification so that it simply means that we're inserting subject matter that wasn't in part of the part of the call there are no rules that govern that so to say we can't have a runaway quote/unquote convention is really just anyone's conjecture without any type of rules so we have a situation where uncertainty reigns on both sides it's uncertainty on the side of the folks that are opposed to a convention process what will happen when we call the convention well we is there a possibility that we would enable questions that have not been sent through the process of 34 states to consider that's it's an entire possibility but historically if you look at the past we certainly can see that we have not had a Constitutional Convention in the past since the 1780s in the social sciences we learn that the most likely thing to happen tomorrow is what happened today the most likely thing to happen today is what happened in the past if we've not had a Constitutional Convention in the past it seems like that's relatively highly unlikely that we're going to be able to perfect that if we don't perfect that how is it that we're going to move our issue forward adequately and when the support that we need if we don't have the pressure from a constitutional convention type of a process as well as attempting to secure legislation so both things are important we we see we seem to be having a debate here about something that we really don't need to have a debate about and here's why we can eliminate that uncertainty by initiating legislation that would control the process edwin meese the Attorney General for Ronald Reagan commissioned a study by the Department of Justice in that study is about 60-page fairly a lengthy tomb will make your eyes water even if you are a constitutional professor and one of the things that that can read it was the end I've posted on my website and it's also on your Hoover app the the document that I'm referring to this is the Department of Justice this is not my opinion and probably I don't know of any other legal authority that would prevail over the Department of Justice and this is what they say in the end of their executive summary this paper concludes by recognizing that there are inevitable uncertainties associated with any yet untried process however it has suggested that the adoption of the convention procedures legislation by the Congress would minimize greatly any remaining uncertainties associated with a convention method of amendment so we have at hand a method of eliminating the uncertainty in the process and yet no one on either side of this debate has initiated that and some it's understandable that it would take it a fair amount of work and it's kind of ancillary to anyone's process so we have not developed that but it also is certainly the case that legislation has existed in the past this is not a unicorn this is not an imaginary creature the staunch liberal Orrin Hatch from Utah introduced legislation in the 1980s that's also on my website it's also on your huva app the exact legislation that was introduced and it would control the it was introduced to control the call limit the subject matter and also make sure that the certification process by Congress would be effectual in other words once the convention was done with its work then the ratification would be sent by Congress to the to the states so that would eliminate any possibility of a runaway convention or a convention that considered subject matter that was not introduced in the call I think it's essential that we've come together as a movement that we take up a drive for legislation that would solve the uncertainties so that we can not only use the amendment the standard legislative procedures but that we can enable the Constitutional Convention procedures to be effective both for us and for the future because understandably having a perfected set of regulations would make a constitutional convention push politically feasible right now you have to say that the physical feasibility of a constitutional convention amendment push is dubious the uncertainty has as we and and this is evident in the balanced budget amendment proposal they have come close a couple times and have states dropped off because they were concerned about the procedural or amplifications thank I just want to pop in real quick before you move on and I just want to question the fact that alec is opposed to a constitutional convention because somebody just sent me a text with a bill moyers program where bill is talking about how they love it so I just wanted to clarify that if I could respond to that quickly yeah there's a point of order factual clarification and then I I know there's going to be some questions out here and I want to make sure you have a chance to answer some of those so just factual correction position of Alex Alec yes so I was on the Alec website last night and found a lot of articles opposing the convention process and I know for a fact that Alec has proposed legislation in many states that say a limited convention that delegates to a limited convention are limited to what they are called to do we adopted that in Wyoming so Wyoming was a target state for many years for Alec to try and get on board with the balanced budget amendment so it's a you would think it's a pretty ripe state for that pick up why I mean refused to do that for many years because of the fear of a convention call so the runaway convention the runaway convention was their fear so Alec proposed model legislation which has been enacted by at least nine states that say a convention cannot run away the delegates to a convention are limited to voting on what they want to vote what what the call is for and if they fail to follow if they if they do try and run away the delegates are removed from the delegation they are replaced by other delegates and they have committed a felony so literally in Wyoming if one of our delegates tried to run away they can go to jail for five years Alec proposed that legislation and adopted in Wyoming and several others at least nine states I know about the doctor that okay if you have a question about this process because it's complicated and what's interesting is you know Americans are fully capable from some pretty complex constitutional law discussions and that's what we're about and that's what we're having but if you have a question raise your hand in a moment but I want to do one more round give Jack a chance to weigh in and you just got lots of notes I've been saying so I hope you digest them and then I want to give Vicki a chance to just close out any other remaining concerns after hearing Jenks arguments on the other side and then I want if you have a question about the process or whether people have said we'll want to make sure we save time for that so jag there are a lot of things I want to address I'm gonna go real quick first I want to say they're good people on it all sides here and I know that they mean well and if we had beers or tea or something I'm sure we'd get along but there are real life consequences so I want to get to that in a second look first of all I want to be clear I support American promise and every other group that tries to do it through Congress and we've had people on the show to fight for that in fact I started a whole group called Justice Democrats to create enough momentum in Congress to be able to pursue that path as well so and and most importantly that actually several of the panelists here have described call for convention creates enormous pressure for Congress to act in fact more than half of our amendments have been because of pressure created by a convention including the 17th amendment which I believe Craig said it was an immutable fact that how close we got to the convention the 17th amendment forced Congress to go yeah yeah I meant direct election of senators so that these two things help each other they don't fight each other if you do both but you must do both now I know the big you mentioned that they did a study called dangerous path which I think is a great title because it goes to the heart of the fear-mongering in this oh my god don't act don't act whatever you do do not do something and she mentions 250 organizations there's a lot of pickup sees and Rochester's in there let's just from the same organizations but anyway but most importantly and this is important is unions so yeah a lot of the unions too and I've had conversations with them and I think they are beginning to change on that but you have to remember the unions also do money in politics they put a lot of money into politics so it's not that they're particularly worried about a convention as much as they're worried about getting money out of politics and I think all of us here agree that we must get politics and what I'm trying to convince our Union brothers and sisters is you're on the end of a perpetual losing battle they'll always have more money than you please think long-term not short-term so now I've got to address some of the things that would say rules there's not enough rules but Ken is exactly right the Constitution is not supposed to set out the Robert's Rules of Order zuv anything let alone a convention but to say that there are no rules and it'll be it just mayhem is not true we've had hundreds of state conventions there are plenty of rules we know exactly how we would proceed now you could say hey well look you're not positive about some of those I hear you Craig but my god are we going to be frozen into inaction because you're not sure about rule 17 b3 so we have to go forward anything unless and by the way I totally support your call for clarification of rules and in fact we've gone and had meetings of Democrats and Republican legislators to try to sort out those rules because we are thinking ahead and and but and so god bless you on that fight so great let's do that together but let us not say okay let's all pause before we figure out the rules you know what's gonna motivate people to figure out the rules if a convention is coming then they're gonna say yes my god let's get the rules right and hold on and and in terms of 1787 look this is super important I the it was ratified even 1787 the Constitutional Convention that was not an article five convention because article five did not exist at the time that was the Constitution didn't exist at the time an article five convention is different it is limited by definition and but even so the Constitutional Convention was ratified in fact Rhode Island and North Carolina were briefly foreign countries because they refused to ratify so they're advocating process incredibly important and the worst case scenario they have is a runaway convention that created the best document ever written so if you trust the people you will get two good results and I have to say that when Vicki talks about state legislatures not always doing the right thing that is unfortunately true the in our experience the number one group that affects state legislators not to do this is common cause they I look a lot of you in the room Maryland Hawaii New Mexico Massachusetts common cause blocked us in everyone Massachusetts just happened in Maryland we had it we had the House of Delegates we had the Senate we had more than enough senators that were co-sponsors we were definitely going to pass and common cause went to the state legislatures and said don't do it don't do it dangerous path don't do it so you understand that it is not a theoretical debate they have killed resolutions to get money out of politics all across the country and they say and Rikki explains why she thinks it's too dangerous it's a dangerous path but it does actively fight to get money or to keep money in politics and the Koch brothers did loss to us in New Jersey Alec Alec is he's Kenna's right Alec fought us in New Jersey and they lost but they're no match for common cause they have better lobbyists and they defeat us when the right wing can't because they they have lobbyists that talk to Democratic legislators and scare the hell out of them and it's just not true so we need we need to be mindful of time and I'm gonna give Vicki a chance to respond as we said at the outset it's no secret that common cause opposes this and that they will oppose it when it comes up in the States that's what their position is it's been very clear so I want to give Vicki a chance to say why that is and and let's hear it sure and again you know this idea that by opposing this one particular bill we're you know we're fighting to keep money in politics is just simply ludicrous if you want to know what common cause does in the state's then first of all email me and I'll send you a list of our wins in every single state on a variety of issues around money in politics and I think that you know we can you know in an era we are in an era of extreme gerrymandering we're in an era of you know again so much money in politics that the people who talk about money in politics can't even predict how much is going to be spent in the next year I mean it just explodes every single year we are in a hyper partisan atmosphere so what I say is why would we think that this atmosphere is going to create anything that's good for our country it's special interest on both sides of the aisle and yes we can hope that these things are gonna happen the way we think they might but the truth of the matter is is nobody up here really knows and we have a really great attorney on our national governing board and he's got a great quote about the con con he says why set your house on fire and then pray the fire department shows up in time thank you so I'll work backwards to Bruce go ahead and a question out to the moderator counsel you know better beers the only way is to go through the convention because we'll never get it through Congress but we can elect a new Congress and in fact we have a in my view who have a better chance of doing that than going from the five we only have five states right now and we have to get to 34 and the balanced budget the thing that's been going on for years and years and years and they still haven't gotten to 34 so what makes you think that we're going to get to 34 before we can elect a new Congress that will be much more amenable to this okay thank you for that I'm gonna take a few cut so make sure we get some in and then I'll pull the questions out of it I'll just work backwards and I'll get over here too so go ahead sir in the yellow yeah basically I'm confused by the fact that if we have whether it's a convention or the amendment process that we're following if the amendment wording calls for multiple issues and there are other amendments that are out there for a single issue does that constitute in your case a call for the same thing it's confusing today we're gonna clarify that and second it's get a couple more in here yeah my question is if we have any examples from other countries unconstitutional processes of the ways in which they've gone around amending their constitutions through a similar type of mechanism like a constitutional convention okay we're gonna take one more and then I'm gonna bring the panel back in to try to address these yes okay all right we got some good questions I'd ask the panel to keep it very short I'm gonna tee them up first to Professor chest egg if he knows of other countries practices and then I'll open it if anyone else on the panel does to weigh in I know of no other countries that has an article 5 I mean this is the United States Constitution it's it's it's one off and I have not studied other countries I would I would be surprised to find anything remotely similar to what we have here we're unique okay and the question about the confusion here I think genk you had a thought on that so that's an excellent question so how many calls are there for a convention and can you put them together so that's actually one of the most important questions and before it was unsettled because there was actually hundreds of calls for a convention on different issues and so it seemed like well if you wanted an unlimited convention a general convention like the 1787 you could have one well last couple of years has been a great clarifying moment because Congress started counting they started counting all the different convention calls right now they have counted up to 75 from 36 different states so that is enough that you need 34 states to call for a convention the reason we don't have one is because they have decided and by Kenna's Wright American all these groups agree American Bar Association Congressional Research Service Department of Justice and the Senate Judiciary Committee you cannot combine issues if you could combine issues we would already have one in fact it would be a constitutional obligation for Congress to call one so we've settled that issue you cannot combine them it must be limited okay and then I'm gonna put the last maybe a little slight rephrasing of the alec question to Vickie because it may be somewhat responsive to Jenks because I hear in both of these some concern about on the what if there's different calls or and so what is to prevent Alec from mucking it up in the legal phrase mucking it up like once the convention begins is that fair I think it's whether it's Alec or any special interest group I think we have a concern um you know we can poopoo the rules all we want to but the truth of the matter is we don't even know who would be at the convention would it be one person from Wyoming and one person from California is that really fair for America so we don't even know who's gonna go there how they're gonna be picked I just want to say we've been working to pass an Ethics Commission in New Mexico for five decades we finally passed it last year to put it on the ballot because we don't have a ballot measure mechanism we have to go through the state to get it on there the number one question the people in New Mexico have about an Ethics Commission they're like oh that sounds like a great idea wait a minute who the hell is gonna choose who's on that Commission Vicki because if it's legislators or the courts or any of those people then I'm not going to trust it why would this be any different at all so you ask question of how do we know so Alec has already taken over a body that can propose a an amendment so that's really scary it's called the United States Congress they already own that so my my point is that that a convention at least gives us an opportunity to get there and and whatever you do do not get scared three-quarters of the states must ratify a convention is only to propose an amendment 3/4 must ratify and we and and for all you progressives out there I'm sorry but we're not gonna get a really progressive amendment we're not gonna get a really conservative amendment we're only gonna get one that an overwhelming majority of Americans agree with and great news for us overwhelming majority of Americans agree on only one issue which is to get money out of politics I want to thank everybody we're out of time obviously this conversation could go on much longer but I appreciate the panel's clarity convictions civil debate it's a debate that will continue and I thank you everyone here for your civil participation
