1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,000
Behind every order you place online is a real
person called a picker.  They navigate massive

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,100
warehouses to find the item you just ordered,
and bring it to place where it is packed and shipped.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,020
With companies like Amazon offering delivery
in as little as an hour, the pressure is on the

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,200
pickers to really speed things up.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,640
The pick time in these facilities have gone
from days to hours to minutes.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,840
It’s very hard to have an entire workforce
shift their cadence and even sustain that cadence.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,240
Silicon Valley company Fetch thinks it has
a solution to this problem.

8
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,290
You guessed it, robots.

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,800
The first step for us really was to eliminate
the tedious activity.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,180
So they could specialize at the things that
they’re good at and then the tedious task

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,170
of going from one side of a 400 square foot
warehouse to the other, that’s given to a robot.

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,240
Exactly.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,100
Pickers used to spend several minutes pushing
carts from one side of the warehouse to the other over and over again.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,260
Fetch wants their robots to do those long
runs leaving the picker to fetch more items.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,320
The result is increased warehouse efficiency with orders up as much as 30 percent without adding more pickers.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,960
At Fetch, engineers work in a mock warehouse,
training robots to maneuver about their future homes.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,400
We want to see how efficient they are how they are dealing with each in terms of going around each other, traffic management through the facility.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,560
The robots are able to get around autonomously by using a combination of a laser and a time-of-flight camera

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,800
so the robot can adjust to obstacles.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,520
The robot actually does path planning, plans a path through the facility and then navigates along that path

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,840
while avoiding obstacles.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,960
This is essentially looking through the robots eyes.

23
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,530
It allows us to see 3D data coming off of
the robot.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,720
You kind of see the shelves and the boxes
around and every kind of nook and cranny there.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,109
RTK Logistics, which serves the semi-conductor
industry, is among Fetch's first customers.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,760
Fetch's robots are designed to work side by
side with people, unlike some robots that

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,800
have to be separated from human workers for safety.

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
Partnering with people to do what the robot
is capable of doing

29
00:02:17,710 --> 00:00:00,000
while making the person
more efficient is really important.
