this segment is presented in partnership with down-ticket TYT and down-ticket want to remind you that every years in election year and with down-ticket you could help even the playing field against big-money and special interests by contributing directly to your favorite candidate just open up the browser on your mobile phone and go to down ticket com late on Monday Brett Kavanaugh agreed to an interview with Fox News and the interview could be problematic for him in the future considering some of the declarative strong statements he made and we do have some clips for you today which we will not only show you but also do a little analysis of apparently while this interview was being broadcasted the writers for The New Yorker who broke the story about the second woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct were fact-checking Kavanaugh so we will give you some of those Corrections after we show you the clips but with that said let's take a look at the first video here is Cavanaugh denying that he was at the party that the first accuser said he assaulted her at she doesn't remember the date and she doesn't remember the place but what she does remember that I just detailed is very specific and other assault victims say that they've had similar memories where they remembered exactly what happened but they didn't necessarily remember the events surrounding it you have categorically denied that this happened did anything happen no I've never sexually assaulted anyone not in high school not ever I've always treated women with dignity and respect do you know her I may have met her we did not travel in the same social circles she was not a friend not someone I knew you don't remember ever being at parties with her ever I do not and this is an allegation about a party in the summer of 1982 at a house near Connecticut Avenue an east-west highway with five people present I was never at any such party the other people who are alleged to be present said they do not remember any such party okay so he is responding to the allegations by the first accuser dr. Blasi Ford and if you can recall her specific allegations there were things that were murky things that she didn't specifically remember including the exact address of where the party took place and where the alleged assault took place and it's strange that he knows the exact address and that he's reciting it there in the interview I don't know why he did that that I don't that was super weird so I wouldn't remember the address of a party I wasn't that I I wouldn't remember the address of a party I was at why now if it was 35 years ago so I don't know why they thought that was a good idea to specify the address of the party that he claims he never went to that was absolutely bizarre and I don't think it helped his case at all it did the reverse I mean obviously we neither one of us know why he did that I can only assume that he's probably exhausted right now because everything in the interview seemed very rehearsed very well-planned except for that specific portion where he recited the addresses no no you'd have to memorize that address to even remember it yeah no they they must have planned it but I can't for the life of me figured out why they would give the exact address it's sounded like he was like look I was not at Connecticut and 287 Maple Avenue connection I wasn't on the second floor where there is green wallpaper with ducks on it I did not see that blue carpet nor was I rolling around in it at all why are you saying these things it's very strange and I also want to point out one other thing he used the words dignity and respect toward women countless times I mean he that was something that he wanted to drive home it was something that I think he was coached on and so he wants to and you will notice this in you know the following clips that we show you he really wants to present himself as this good guy who was a good boy at the time that these alleged assault took place so just real quick before that one is look I get it he's in a tough spot so if he did it he's in an awfully tough spot because he did it and he has to cover it up if he didn't do it boy he's also in a tough spot because you have to deny it while making sure you're not greatly angering women in this country and so you have to talk about dignity and respect of women and and and he also has to be really careful about his answers not to incriminate himself but at the same time this looks so rehearsed and faked that I don't do people really still believe that the any of this that he didn't practice it with lawyers and and advisors over and over again now it doesn't mean it's not true but it is a hundred percent rehearsed well another thing that also screams of this was rehearse and everything was planned out in detail is he's he did what standard establishment people in the political world do which is I'm gonna bring my wife along with me yeah and it's painful it's painful and you know what maybe she really wants to be there to support him and it is what it is but nonetheless it does seem rehearsed and just to answer your question Jake and this is from my perspective I do think that people who care about politics who are passionate about politics who have been following this story unfortunately have made up their minds with few exceptions people who do want to keep an open mind as we've said on this show numerous times we don't know we don't know without a shadow of a doubt that he did it and we want to be fair and the testimony is important but with that said I do think that on the right especially lawmakers have made up their mind and they've been pretty open and honest about that yeah and in some parts of the jury who come in for me on what they are so let's keep going with the clips because when he talks about what a choir boy he was that part of the juries in for me and and again if you are trying to convince people that you're not a liar you should stop lying yeah so in the next clip he addresses Debora Ramirez's allegations which were profiled in The New Yorker and that was the article written by Jan Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow she says she was at a dorm party and this happened quote Brett was laughing I can still see his face and his hips coming forward like when you pull up your pants I'm confident about the pants coming up and I'm confident about Brett being there she was initially uncertain it was you they write in this piece but after six days she's confident enough she says should the American people view her as credible I never did any such thing never did any such thing the other people alleged to be there don't recall any such thing if such a thing had happened it would have been the talk of campus do you wouldn't roommate I think his last name was Roche who said you know that he could see this kind of thing happening that you drank a lot in high school drank a lot in college and although he hadn't seen or heard this incident himself that it added up to him that that it made sense that you treated women that way I've always treated women with dignity and respect he does not corroborate the incident at all the incident did not remember him you as a roommate I do remember why do you think he would say that what I know I'm not gonna speculate about motives I know I never did that if I had done that it would've been the talk of campus so I have to just quickly address some of the things that he either intentionally lied about or maybe missed in the original reporting on that story now as was accurately reported here at TYT there were some issues with her memory right and and she was very honest about that Deborah Ramirez was honest about that however to say that there was no one who corroborated it or to say that it was it would have been the talk of campus he in the original article it's clear that there is a specific person who corroborated it and he's basing it off of what he heard a couple days after the alleged assault so again the reporters here Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow were fact-checking him as this interview was happening and so were at least as it was airing and so Meyer noted that she and Ferro reported at least one witness suggest that the event was talked about on campus in the days afterward she continues to write and so it was a classmate who heard about it at the time told me he has thought of it every time he hears Kevin namor heard Cavanaugh's name for the last 35 years so yeah I mean maybe he just forgot about that part of the story but to say that no one corroborated it and to say hey people would have been talking about it and no one was it's just that's not true at all yeah so but here I think we have a lot more of a mixed record because now remember no one is saying they were at the party and saw it happen there is someone who's saying and he was a hundred percent sure that people told him about the party so that goes against Cavanaugh's point that nobody on campus was talking about it because they were but there is no other witness right now that was at that party and and in the case of Ramirez look do I think she's genuine given her over-the-top honesty about how she doesn't remember certain things and how intoxicated she was etc I I believe she's totally genuine on the other hand that's a tough thing to accuse somebody of to say like I don't remember if it was him but after six days of thinking about it I'm sure it is him you just look if that was against the an ally of mine or a friend of mine I'd say that's a pretty tough way to accuse someone so yeah look I agree with you on that and I do think based on the way Republicans have shifted in the way that they're handling these these allegations The New Yorker piece might have been counterproductive because now it seems as though they're latching on to Ramirez and and the fact that she was drinking which I don't think that's a credible way of you know discounting her her recollection but more importantly they're saying well she doesn't remember so this is you know an attempt to slander defame Cavanagh to smear him it's all political that's all this is so in a way it has been a little counterproductive look that's the politics of it and I care less about that in this context and and and and but if you did care about that no the second woman always makes a giant giant difference and I think the tenor of the conversation changed even a little bit more when the second woman forward so I think her accusations are very relevant in that sense whether you believe them is a different question and in this case there's a good reason to believe both people right she could genuinely believe that and you might say yeah but I'm not sure I trust her recollection that's all right and and just to clarify my point look I I think that among Democrats it certainly helped right maybe some Democrats that are on the fence but among Republicans what it signaled to them was oh this is a fishing expedition they're looking for anyone and everyone who's willing to smear him and that's how it's a little counterproductive I've personally noticed that the tone from Senate Republicans has changed whereas before there were a lot more careful to be a little respectful at least of the women and now it's no-holds-barred we're gonna go after these women and and that's that's what I mean when I say it's kind of productive with that said though let's go to the next clip where Cavanaugh talks about being such a good boy when he was in high school when I was in high school and I went to an all-boys Catholic High School a Jesuit High School where I was focused on academics and athletics going to church every Sunday at little flower working on my service projects and friendship friendship with my fellow classmates and friendship with girls from the local all-girls Catholic schools and yes there were parties and the drinking age was eighteen and yes the seniors were legal and had beer there and yes people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit but I know that's not what we're talking about we're talking about an allegation of sexual assault I'd never sexually assaulted anyone yeah so this is the part that's among the worst of his responses because by every account he was a wild man in high school in college and so you could say hey that's no big deal and if it didn't involve the sexual assault allegations it would be no big deal but no one thinks that he was a choirboy that was I went to Little Flower every Sunday and what I cared most about was my friendships with the boys and the girls and the local schools no man you were the the on the football team that bragged about sexual conquests all the time the football in and large did you guys were the rowdiest of the bunch you over drank by everybody who knows you thinks that so the more honest way to go would be hey man did I drink too much in college and in high school I did I would you know I was a young kid et cetera but that doesn't have any new was sexual assault and I wouldn't do that but yeah we did a bunch of stuff that I regret I mean we read young knuckleheads that's a normal human answer I suppose this rehearsed beat us well I think what's notable from that answer was that he said something along the lines of you know did some people have one too many beers right he didn't take any responsibility for over drinking during this interview however when he gave speeches at College events in the past he bragged about over drinking you know we were we were partying I'm obviously paraphrasing I don't have his exact speech in front of me but I remember he recalled this one time and I believe it was when he was in college where he and his buddies were on a bus and then they finally got to the location that they were trying to get to and they all kind of like fell out of the bus because they had been drinking so much so in other instances he'll admit to partying and over drinking but in this like goody-two-shoes interview he's presenting himself as someone who was just like constantly studying going to Sunday school every Sunday or going to church every Sunday and and you know just looking out for his friends and that's it and if he had the whole speech in front of you you still wouldn't have the whole speech in front of you because as we showed on TYT investigates in a speech he gave a couple of years ago he said the famous phrase what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep but somebody took that out of the transcript yes so again we're hoping that a Democratic senator asks did you take that out of the transcript and if you did why did you take it out of the transcript before any allegations came out so make sure you check out TYT comm /e investigates to see that story thanks for watching this free clip of the young turks don't forget to become a TYT member today
