1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
so at least three or four times a week I

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,750
seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be finding myself walking alone</font>

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,150
home at night quite late it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,680
dangerous but I'm on a really main road

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a planet along with me all</font>

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,200
the time but in back of my mind I'm

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,030
always on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alert like I'm always</font>

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,250
aware of who's around me where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,560
in relation to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> body and I just have</font>

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very aware all the time that's</font>

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,960
something I've grown up with us and I

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,240
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> most most people and inherently</font>

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,699
most girls grow up with not wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,980
but just automatically knowing where

15
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,510
everybody else is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street every</font>

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">time I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walk home i'm reminded of the</font>

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,740
fact that i really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start and</font>

18
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,020
self-defense classes I want to feel even

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,309
if its illusion that I could overpower

20
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,170
somebody who tried to attack me I think

21
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just miss it as</font>

22
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,600
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know you read too</font>

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,579
many papers you watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> too many films but</font>

24
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,719
actually I have been approached on the

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,920
street I've been trying people<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font>

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,690
tried to get me in a car once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

27
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,160
been followed home I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

28
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,930
dismiss it as a paranoia need to talk to

29
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,640
more women because often it's based on

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,260
actual experience it made me think about

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">how I've had to move through spaces</font>

32
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,379
throughout my life because it's scary

33
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,480
taking up space sometimes and having to

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,980
know everybody else's in relation to you

35
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,750
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just want to exist this is</font>

36
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,489
why I can't meditate this is why

37
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,129
mindfulness and focusing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just so hard</font>

38
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,729
I think for many people also are many

39
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,770
many women because i think you know

40
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,060
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> always trying to think of two</font>

41
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,439
things at once you know people say oh

42
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,450
like they're just they're multitasking

43
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,770
maybe that's because we always have to

44
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,479
be aware of where we are and what we're

45
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,340
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in who else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is around and what</font>

46
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,740
they think and who is inhabiting what

47
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,900
space you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing somebody is</font>

48
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,880
explicitly told me a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

49
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,710
doesn't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be said in some ways as</font>

50
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,570
soon as 12 remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm standing on the</font>

51
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,950
playground with my friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> because a few</font>

52
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,150
people who are laughing at me from a

53
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,970
walk because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I walked you know with my</font>

54
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,549
legs apart because crossing them over as

55
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,470
uncomfortable when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you walk and I just</font>

56
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,720
kind of walked I guess like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boy my</font>

57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,490
friend who genuinely only had my best

58
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,140
interests at heart we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing on the</font>

59
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,759
playground<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me teaching me how to</font>

60
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,130
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a girl and I remember going</font>

61
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">through his paces have been like i doing</font>

62
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:52,890
it right i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and doing the</font>

63
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,869
holock oh oh yeah no<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sway your hips</font>

64
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,759
a bit more place your right<font color="#E5E5E5"> foot in</font>

65
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,810
front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your left or your left one</font>

66
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,909
front of your right don't let<font color="#CCCCCC"> them go</font>

67
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,469
side by side you have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

68
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,100
instead of like this oh I must now seem

69
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,780
so silly it seems so stupid but at the

70
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,369
time it was I worried about because

71
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,380
people bullied me about

72
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,350
it's just like Oh feel attractive<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

73
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">two to attract boys always talk to you</font>

74
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,730
hurt my eyes downwards and then quickly

75
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,920
snap them up what is that you know

76
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,570
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

77
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,070
back to your eyelids because I literally

78
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,720
feel fucking batty doing it I'm

79
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,490
basically a mature analyze why I've put

80
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,960
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much weight recently why I've</font>

81
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,180
always had extra weight around me

82
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,740
throughout my teenage years and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

83
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,970
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us trying to give</font>

84
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,400
myself permission to take up space you

85
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,650
know give myself a present nothing no is

86
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,000
more you're staying<font color="#CCCCCC"> on public transport</font>

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a man just opens their legs and sits</font>

88
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,300
there like this in your personal space

89
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,250
like taking a horse fucking room but you

90
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,350
know I'm allocated space your allocated

91
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,480
space mmm you and then you see women on

92
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,470
the tube<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sitting there like this</font>

93
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,480
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder why you know and who told</font>

94
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">him to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because I don't think</font>

95
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody told them I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

96
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,030
say the word angry feminist this movie

97
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">might angry you know the scary means</font>

98
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,790
you're angry feminist like actually if I

99
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,050
really think about there's nobody to be

100
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,880
angry<font color="#CCCCCC"> at so nobody who's telling me this</font>

101
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,410
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who are telling me this</font>

102
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have been told and I</font>

103
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">think sometimes when people and hear</font>

104
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,260
about feminism and then speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me like</font>

105
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,730
they expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things like did</font>

106
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,020
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is the majority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

107
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,730
women in the workplace that aren't in

108
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,230
these kind of managerial roles and this

109
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,240
has made like women CEOs there are in

110
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,610
the world and yes that is a problem but

111
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't see it as something that I'm</font>

112
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,720
blaming any before<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway and go you you</font>

113
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,490
you part of the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we don't</font>

114
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,710
feel like but their spaces we have

115
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,930
permission to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I haven't read lean</font>

116
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,840
in yet but I will I promise it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

117
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I feel like maybe a lot of my</font>

118
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,450
friends actually don't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they</font>

119
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,040
have permission to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into these spaces</font>

120
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,170
and permission to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make decisions of</font>

121
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,120
permission to go to these kind of roles

122
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,070
because it just doesn't occur to us oh

123
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm realizing is the persecution isn't

124
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,720
always human to human person to person

125
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,910
it's often<font color="#E5E5E5"> history</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to person you know</font>

126
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,709
sometimes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like if I'm being</font>

127
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,290
pursued by any kind of specific person

128
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,720
or any specific threat or any<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

129
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">items to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set of ideals I feel like I'm</font>

130
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">being pursued by history I feel like I'm</font>

131
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,390
running and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming faster and it's</font>

132
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,370
like you know we're being persecuted by

133
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,640
our own gender heritage and this it's

134
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,080
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> something you can blame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some before</font>

135
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,640
so it's really hard to solve that and

136
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,959
I'm guess what I'm trying to say here is

137
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,490
that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to give you</font>

138
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,840
permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're sitting somewhere</font>

139
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,640
and you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you money waiting for</font>

140
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,089
something

141
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,040
you permission to go for that role or to

142
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,750
do that thing or to say that people to

143
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,930
walk that way look that way knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

144
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,160
couldn't be serious with this whole

145
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,949
video took this wound if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

146
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that don't give</font>

147
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,000
yourself permission it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

148
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,620
importance about urgency there is

149
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,320
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important than you being</font>

150
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,590
here don't always be aware of your space

151
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,389
and how it relates to everybody else's

152
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,280
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be in your space take a</font>

153
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
moment to be in your space nothing is

154
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,940
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> urgent than your right to be here</font>
