Hilary Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee for sinister president and Donald Trump the preposterous Republican nominee for unimaginable president have been attacking each other on foreign policy lately mrs. Clinton gave a speech last week detailing her criticisms of Trump and then Trump fired back until the weapon was wrestled from his hand Hillary began her attack by claiming that Trump was too inexperienced to handle foreign policy she said quote here is a man who has never traded government favors for illegal cash payoffs or recklessly toppled a dictator plunging an entire region into chaos or left our people to die and then lied about it to their parents while standing in front of their coffins these are not things you can learn on the job I've done them all and if elected president I'll be sure to do them again especially the cash payoff part unquote Trump responded to the charges by breaking out of his enclosure swinging from a tree into a crowded children's area seizing a three-year-old boy and dragging him through a man-made river zoo officials finally brought Trump down with a tranquilizer gun and returned him to his cage preventing any loss of life mrs. Clinton continued to hit Trump on foreign policy by calling his outlook dangerously chaotic he doesn't really have any ideas she said just a series of bizarre attitudes I on the other hand firmly believe that rainbows shoot out of the backsides of suicide bombers Mexican gangsters are dreamers who only want to come to America to mow my lawn and Europe is a magical kingdom somewhere across the silver sea where everyone has health care and speaks with a charming accent Trump answered mrs. Clinton's criticism by strangling his humpback guard tearing his chains from the castle wall and descending into a nearby Bavarian village where he mistook a little girl for a flower and threw her into a lake to see if she could float a mob of angry villagers finally chased mr. Trump to an abandoned mill which they set on fire with their torches the mill collapsed in flames giving the impression the monster had been destroyed but leaving the matter suspiciously open to question mrs. Clinton ended her speech by declaring that mr. Trump did not have the temperament to be a good foreign policy president she said quote at any moment that man do something absolutely crazy like kill Islamic terrorists or enforce our immigration laws this would completely reverse the foreign policy President Obama has been carefully building in order to lose the friendship of our allies and encourage the ambitions of our enemies I hereby pledge to you that a Hillary Clinton administration will stay the Obama course and ensure that our national decline is not just unnecessary but irreversible mr. Trump hit back against mrs. Clinton in an interview with John Dickerson on Face the Nation ripping Dickerson's head off with his bare hands and then roasting his decapitated body over an open flame before devouring at whole on national TV viewers agreed Trump's actions improved both the show and Dickerson so election 2016 continues just about as usual trigger warning I'm Andrew Clayton and this is the Andrew Clayton show I think we're living we're living in the Mar Republic you know you've heard of the Y Mar rep√∫blica why mark Republic was put into place in Germany after World War one there was a revolution and they brought on in a republic so they had a much more democratic you know a system with a president all this stuff and it was very wobbly and it fell apart as the economy fell apart they had these terrible inflation people were pushing wheelbarrows of cash to the store to buy bread and all this stuff and it fell apart and gave great to the Nazis the Nazis took power we're having like the same kind of craziness the same kind of radicalness the same kind of violence except there's no reason so there's no why so it's not the Weimar Republic it's just the Mara but like a long joke but it was it was worth it wasn't it so unfortunately Muhammad Ali could not survive the Clavin was weakened so we're here without him the rest of it have to push on we'll talk about Ali we'll talk about it we have a lot of stuff to talk about it's both d-day and the beginning of Ramadan so that will put those together and insult Muslims I think that'll work well but we really and also I want to remind you also to subscribe so you can be part of the mailbag on Wednesday when we will answer all your questions personal questions philosophical questions political questions whatever you want to know romantic things we will do it all whatever you want to say but you gotta subscribe it's free for 30 days and then it's like 8 bucks a month or something like that so uh the thing I really want to talk about though and I know you know it's this breaking news this thing's moving forward we have the California primary coming out in the New Jersey primary and other states that'll be pretty much the end obviously of the Democrat primaries there's one more in Washington DC I think mid month but this is coming to the place where it's gonna end and we'll be talking about that we'll talk about that a little more tomorrow because there's something I really have to talk about that happened last week that I think you know I don't want the new cycle to pass it by without bringing it closer to you know more front and center in your attention which is the violence that has been taking place at Trump rallies I mean it happened in our state here in in San Jose Thursday night it was an appalling spectacle and one of the reasons it's so important to me to talk about it is because I have been scouring Trump from the beginning for his violent rhetoric I've called him a proto-fascist and people were attacking me on Twitter when this thing happened they were saying well you called him a proto-fascist what's this well this is fascism this is real fascism and yes he is a proto-fascist though all that violent talk about beat up the protesters and punch that guy in the mouth and I'll pay your legal fees all of it bad bad stuff nothing nothing like what happened in San Jose this was a spectacle like I just never ever thought I would see and you know you know the thing is guys like you know Milo you Napoles these guys on the alt-right they think this stuff is funny it's not funny because you know when you deal with evil your irony your irony doesn't mitigate the evil the evil just takes over the irony the only way to deal with evil is by doing the right thing I'm gonna run tom ABCs Tommy an ass's report from the San Jose scene I'm gonna let it run pretty long the thing about this is an excellent report it's on this Stephanopoulos GMA show you know I run down the news media constantly I've lost all respect for them I think they are a corrupt organization they are Democrats basically with press cards but all of this is true of the managers the guys on the street whatever their politics are frequently trying to get the truth out there Street reporters and I've been a reporter and I've been in the news business the street reporters are constitutionally created to get the news and what so often happens is they report the news and the guys at the top the Scott Pelley z and the managers whose names we don't know they kill their stories if they're anti-obama they're the guys who have been sitting on Obama stories Scott Pelley has been so negative so he has struck down so many anti-obama stories stories that put Obama in a bad light the reporters don't even want to be on his show this is the flagship show of CBS and reporters don't want their stories on because they feel he's that dishonest so Tom jnanis is doing an excellent excellent job reporting at this San Jose rally and he just tells you what the chaos is like and you can see it if you subscribe this was one of the most violent scenes I have ever witnessed at a trump rally at times it seemed like the police had no control of the situation people were getting beat up right in front of them and these were not clashes these were pure attacks Trump supporters men women even the elderly left this building last night and walked right into danger overnight all-out brawl outside the Trump rally in San Jose California Trump supporters harassed beaten and bloodied by mobs of protesters they're like spitting on me and stuff this man says he was sucker-punched his clothes torn off his back seven more people just for a livery bad this lone female Trump supporter tried to stand her ground her sign porn from her hands her glasses ripped off and shoved in her face a woman wearing a trump jersey cornered and then egged in the face fights breaking out in the streets all over the convention inside Trump spoke to a large and welcoming crowd we're going to build that wall don't even think about it but outside protestors accused Trump of being a racist and hunted down the people that support him that man eventually fighting his way back to police and another point protesters followed this couple violently harassing them then storming the parking lot where they tried to escape protestors shaking cars and smashing taillights drivers forced to hit the gas to get out police were there armed in riot gear but from what we witnessed reluctant to initially stop or engage the protesters then this a young man running in fear from protesters then getting tackled before breaking free we pointed to police this Trump supporter walking with his wife spat on bottles thrown at them then punches he says it was the only way he could get out this is so disgusting that spectacle of that woman surrounded by these thugs a lot of them wearing masks by the way if you couldn't see it a lot of them dressed up so you can't tell who they are the police standing by and I know the police have a very tough time of it but later on the police chief and the mayor came out with a statement that was just disgusting basically blaming Trump for this and you know not taking responsibility for the fact that they let this get out of hand this is the face of fascism and it went by the way one of my real objections to right-wing radio in general is the overuse of terms like fascism and tyranny and this kind of everything gets hyped up and this is just part of what the media has to do to keep your attention because you turn them off if they don't get you excited you know if you don't get people ginned up then people don't listen so they you know if Obama misuses an executive order people start shouting tyranny tyranny that's not tyranny that's the kind of thing that happens under democracy it needs to be spotted it needs to be shouted down this is tyranny this is when people can't go to a rally without being surrounded without being chased down hunted down like animals that's fascism okay and there's nothing there's no excuse nothing Trump is done nothing Trump is said it may give us an excuse for that so here comes Hillary we're gonna play the third Hillary cut and Jake Tapper has Iran and he asks her will she denounce this and here's her milk toast to the lukewarm reply I condemn all violence in our political arena I condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people who were engaging in it I condemn it by those who are taking violent protests to physical assault against Donald Trump this has to end he said a very bad example he created an environment in which it seemed to be acceptable for someone running for president to be inciting violence to be encouraging his supporters now we're seeing people who were against him responding in kind it should all stop it is not acceptable that's just garbage that's garbage to hell with her and Jake Tapper presses her and she doubles down listen to it listen to it get even muley mount as tapper pushes her that played the fourth cut at the end of the day do you think that those violent anti-trump protesters actually might be helping him in a way by by showing his opposition in such a horrendous light I don't think any of this helps anybody I don't think his protests that were led by his supporters beating up people who were peacefully protesting against Trump helped Trump and I don't think that people who are protesting and using physical violence against people supporting Trump are helping anybody so I wanted to just and Jake I don't want to parse it I don't want to talk about the political implications I want it to end the police have a hard enough job trying to make sure that we're able to gather and talk about the issues facing our country and Trump has lowered the bar and now is it a surprise the people who don't like him are stepping over that low bar I don't think it is he needs to condemn all violence by everyone I already have I will continue to do so on nonsense you know a lowered the bar so you stepped over it it's like you raised your skirt so I raped it you know this is like when a newspaper says Trump inspired violence that is like it's like woman inspired rape it's this is this is absolute garbage and it's even more garbage because of this here is Tammy Bruce Tammy Bruce a pal she wrote this excellent piece in The Washington Times this morning I'll reach as much of it as I can from Chicago to Albuquerque to San Diego and now last week's obscene riot in San Jose California Americans and the world saw supporters of the liberal agenda violently target Trump supporters peacefully trying to attend a rally as though they were prey make no mistake the supposed anti Trump riots are not organic nor are they natural they are the result of leftist organizing using paid Stooges Fox News reported in March a Craigslist ad posted by Bernie Sanders supporters offering $15 an hour to protest at a trump rally in Wisconsin they would also provide shuttle bus transport parking if you needed it and ready-made signs yeah not organized just natural upset citizens who are so passionate about the situation they just can't help themselves and if you believe that I have a YouTube video for you that caused a bunch of passers-by in Benghazi to riot to when confronted with the fact that the organizers of these melees are bernie sanders supporters and representatives from democrat allied groups like la raza & moveon.org the democratic party establishment denies denies denies they then condemned the violence with one hand while their allies perpetrate perpetrated the latest embarrassment for the democrats and the country was last thursday when americans watched in horror the video of liberal protesters at a San Jose Trump rally violently attacking people who were trying to attend the event the American flag was burned cars were attacked people were spat upon punched in the face and beaten this is what liberals have been doing since the 60s Tammy goes on they've done it here in Europe and South America the left always resorts to violence because they cannot win on the issues the policies of Hillary and Bernie destroy lives and the only way to keep you in line like a batterer is to keep you too afraid to leave them they hope you'll be intimidated into surrendering or at least will be distracted and not notice that they've already set the nation on fire but it's already too late the Democrats and their allies simply don't understand trying to beat us into submission reaffirms our determination to end this charade that's Tammy Bruce in the Washington Times and by the way by the way that moveon.org remember is a George Soros supported entity and he is a big Hillary Clinton person this is not just Bernie's people this is Hillary's people that she knows exactly what's going on and you know i-i've denounced the words that come out of trumps mouth but when Hillary Clinton talks about protests at which people are beaten Trump wrote that's never happened that has never happened once or twice somebody's gotten out of line and punched somebody I condemned it I condemn the fact that Trump didn't condemn it that is proto fascism but this is the real thing and it's in keeping Tammy is right it's in keeping with what the left does you remember that thing that just happened in Yale not long ago around Halloween where one of the masters of the house was trying to defend the idea that you could dress up in any damn Halloween costume you wanted to instead of being culturally aware and read about who you were going to offend and you remember the Nicholas Christakis his name was went out and tried to explain his point of view to a mob a mob of Yale students and Yale students listen my son was one of them they are the most privileged people in the world God blessed them acting like a bunch of thugs listen to this again it was like that's fascism - and that's violence - and by the way there was a piece in The Wall Street Journal over the weekend talking about the fact that they hounded this man Christakis and his wife Erica who both of whom are total liberals by the way because these guys always eat their own they hounded them out of their position while the administration not only stood by but basically supported the people who are hounding them this is the face of fascism this is fashion this is what it's like and it's always the same excuse it's always translating words into actions you said this and that oppressed me you did thought this and that oppressed me you you know you took this action or said these words or think thought this thought and put this for it and that oppressed me so I have the right to respond with violence you elevate language to an action of violence and then you can respond in violence and it's always around this issue of racism you know there's always around this whole issue you know I don't even know what the left opposes racism I don't even know you know they tell me that all morality is relative they tell me that every culture is the same as every other culture so why is a racist culture worse than a non racist culture I don't get it I know why I'm opposed to racism I know I'm opposed because it says that God created man in His image and then after that God came down to earth and zipped himself into a Jesus suit and told told us that to love him and to love our neighbor that's why I oppose racism that's why and that just like you know they're always saying about religious people that they won't listen to the facts I won't listen to the facts nothing you can tell me nothing you can tell me scientifically about black people or Mexicans or anything is gonna make me hate them because I know where they come from and I know whose image they're created and I know my obligations to them why why what is the left care it's all relative you know let's just have a racist culture why not you know I don't I don't get it I don't get why they're so excited nothing they say makes sense which brings me to Donald Trump and the judge okay Donald Trump is now under attack for his racist remarks about Judge Gonzalo Curiel Gonzalo Curiel is a an American of Mexican descent he is presiding over this case of this lawsuit of Trump University people claiming Trump University was a fraud Trump's argument is that curiel that the plaintiff in this suit came forward and basically praised Trump University and so the they got rid of the plaintiff and continued the suit and from the same no that's not fair if you get rid of the plaintiff the suit is over so he says Coryell hates me because he's Mexican and I want to build a wall so Jake Tapper challenges him on this Jake Tapper who is now like the only journalist left in America who's asking anybody anything that's why he's here so often so Trump is defending himself he won't take it back if you were giving me fair rulings I wouldn't be talking to you this way he's giving me horrible I don't care if you criticize him that's fine you can criticize every decision what I'm saying is if you invoke his race as a reason why he can't take a joke I was doing it but if I think that's why he's doing it when Hillary Clinton says it's a racist Hillary Clinton is a stiff if Hillary Clinton Ryan today Paul Ryan today said he didn't care for the way that you were attacking this judge I'm just telling you Paul Ryan does another case his system isn't it the die shooter won this case on summary judgment this is not a kid this is a case I should have won when someone you know the law firm paid hillary clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars to make speeches do you know the law firm i do we've reported we were reported in on my show okay so i'm glad you're the only one but on women the law firm paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to hillary clinton to speech before either of you it wasn't where everybody fell asleep during a speech before either of you were running for president they did but here's the gist the fundamental I know that they've contributed to Mendes amounts of money to our campaign yes do you know they've contributed a lot of money to Eric Schneiderman New York Attorney here's my question no no do you know that I did not know do you know that these people went to every Attorney General practically in the country that they could and you know this case was turned down by almost every Attorney General from Texas to Florida to many of these states is it not when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race is that not the definition of racism well of course it is of course tappers right it is the definition of racism he is mean unless he has proof listen it's possible that somebody might not like Trump because he's he's gonna build a wall of a Mexican guy of Mexican descent might not like Trump that's possible it could happen the guy maybe target him for that you gotta have proof before you go racial on a guy you got to have proof but let me just point out again that one of the things that we object to about Trump or just about everybody here at the death objects know about Trump is that he's basically essentially a leftist and one of the things whenever when the New York Times runs a headline that says white cop shoots unarmed black teen they are telling you the same thing Trump is telling you they are telling you that that black that cop acted because of his race they are communicating that before anybody has any proof they do it again and again and again a white cop who shot a black teen an unarmed black teen always the same story they are implying exactly what Trump is saying out loud he is only sinking to the level of the left and when even when he encourages violence he is only sinking to the level of the left the violence is inherent in the left ISM and it has been that way for years and it's that way every time they shout down ben shapiro at at college or any other speaker to college and those that that woman was guilty of a kind of a fascist silencing and intimidation that we've seen from the left for years you know all these years people have been writing me saying the left la shouldn't we lie the left is intimidate shouldn't we intimidate and I keep saying no because we're the good guys well congratulations you've got is gonna bring you what you want but I'm not sure you're gonna like it I don't think you're gonna like it I don't like it alright let's talk about Muhammad Ali but before we talk about Muhammad we have to say you know the one of the best things written about Muhammad Ali after his death at 74 was by John Nolte one of the people I like best on earth and who is now writing for The Daily wire I'm so thrilled and and a trump supporter which says a lot of good things about the people who run the Daily wire including ben and jeremy boring that they have brought on somebody they disagree with to represent that point of view nobody can do it better than Nolte I note he's one of the best observers of the modern media and one of the reasons I think he likes Trump so much is the Trump trashes the media Muhammad Ali died Nolte wrote politically this is what John wrote for The Daily wire politically culturally and socially alia and I agreed on practically nothing as a young man the newly crowned heavyweight Tramp fresh from his earth-shattering upset over Liston announced his conversion to Islam and membership in Elijah Muhammad's bizarre and racist Nation of Islam cult he would later refuse to serve his country in Vietnam and end his life as a globalist me I'm a patriotic Roman Catholic who firmly believes that one of America's great sins was abandoning our allies in South Vietnam when it comes to how the world should be ally was the furthest thing from my North Star and as remarkable as they were Ally's athletic accomplishments have little to do with my admiration for the man what I admire about Ali is that he was something incredibly rare and courageous one of the hardest things to be during his time or any time Muhammad Ali was his own man you know that's a beautiful sentiment and it's part of Nolte's wonderful open mind I don't entirely agree with it I'm not a hero worshipper and in the sense that I don't look at people who do great things well or think do things greatly and think that they should somehow represent who I should be you know there's a lot of gray area and what Ali did you know he was they took three years of his life away for the fact of his fighting life away he was banned from the ring because he wouldn't go to Vietnam on religious principles if he had been a white Quaker if he had been a white Roman Catholic and had refused to go to go to Vietnam I don't think they would have done to him what they did the Supreme Court ultimately let him back in with a unanimous verdict but the thing about it is forget about all that he was one of the very few people who says I'm the greatest who was the greatest he was a thing of beauty and a thing of beauty as John Keats said is a joy forever more than that John Keats says something else he said beauty is truth and truth is beauty and that's all you know on earth and you know there is something about someone who does something at this level which is inspiring in ways that transgress that go beyond the transcend inspiring in ways that transcend his politics his opinions if he had been an evil man that would take away from what he did but he wasn't an evil man he was a man trying to find his way in a very very difficult time and he was an absolutely beautiful beautiful athlete when he fought I love boxing I love watching two people pound each other to death I think it's a it's a great scientific sport requiring immense courage he had immense courage and he had a style like nothing I have ever seen if he was not one of the hundred greatest athletes who ever lived certainly in America you know I don't know who is and it's just it's just a wonderful thing to see and you'd have to look you know humanity is broken nobody's perfect this guy did something great greatly and I think that that's worth remembering and I was really sorry one of the very rare celebrities when I heard about his death I went oh you know he was one of the greats all right stuff I like and this is interesting this actually leads in to what I have to say about stuff I like there was a show on AMC a six-part miniseries based on a john lecarre a novel called the night manager it's a just a wonderful wonderful spy story exciting well plotted so brilliantly acted Hugh Laurie at this point at Point I remember a Hugh Laurie I lived in England he was like a miner and not a miner comedian he was I may be a major comedian but he just has become one of the great great actors Tom Hiddleston is in it basically is the he's the hero it's like an audition for the next Bond movie he will make a great James Bond Elizabeth de vikke who is a long one in a long line of willowy blondes whom I have fallen madly in love with the since I was 10 years old including my wife I love those long low-key blonds and she is just beautiful in it you know one of the things that has happened to look array as he was I think he was one of the greatest novelists of his day I think when the Berlin Wall was up when the Soviet Union was active he chronicled the Soviet Union when so many artists were ignoring what was going on when the wall came down he unfortunately I believe partakes of this British Orientalism that romanticizes Islam and he could not confront the fact that Islam was the great evil of our age Islamism I would say is the great evil of our age Islamism is the great evil of our age and the great question of our age is whether Islamism is inherent in Islam or is it a cancer on Islam and that's a question for experts to debate openly and honestly without being afraid and without being intimidated the Caray has lost that train and he makes all his villains now our arms dealers and we're supposed to get all upset that people are selling arms but the fact is people can't sell arms unless somebody buys them if you get rid of one arms dealer another will take his place but if you get rid of a bad philosophy you could have a good ten years before a new bad philosophy springs up Islamism is a very bad philosophy and everything in the arts everything in the arts is meant to avoid discussing it all these superhero movies they are they're the reason we have superhero movies is not just because of the spectacle is because people don't want to make movies in which Islamists are the villain instead you can have like an octopus guy comes out and it you know destroys a city you know there's a new movie the sequel to Independence Day is coming out and it shows that in the posters in LA it shows Europe in flames and the cut line is they picked on the wrong planet well that's about terrorism they're telling you about terrorism but nobody wants to admit who the terrorists are so they make it about aliens from outer space and that has forced the arts to stop discussing the great subject of our time which is this culture clash that's going on and that's one of the problems with the night manager and because it's a problem with the night manager it becomes very simplistic morally however however there is just nobody who can do character like liquor a there's nobody who can do drama and the acting is great and the locations are great and just everything about the show is as entertaining as it can possibly be so in the same way that Ali presented a beautiful thing that maybe you don't want to take as a as a as a philosophical truth you know maybe the words coming out of his mouth weren't philosophical truths while his art was beautiful in the same way the night manager is as interesting and exciting as it can possibly be without really dealing with the issues that liquor a was so good at dealing with when he dealt with the Soviet Union what he knew about the Soviet Union was that as bad as the West can be and we can all be corrupt and make mistakes and do terrible things what he understood was that as bad as the West could be the Soviet Union was worse and he can't bring himself to say that about Islamism and Islam in the Middle East he just can't bring himself to say it so he can't write the great books that he used to write still the night manager is as entertaining as it can possibly be stuff I like and I recommend it alright tomorrow we'll come back and we'll talk about California because California here we come it's going to be really interesting some really interesting stuff is popping up I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show come back tomorrow and we'll talk all about
