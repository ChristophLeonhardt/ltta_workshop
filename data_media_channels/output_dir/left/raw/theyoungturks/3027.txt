1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,140
TODAY MARKS

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,529
THE FIVE YEARS ANNIVERSARY OF
THE TRAGIC SANDY HOOK SHOOTING.

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,540
ON THAT DAY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S
BEEN FIVE YEARS I STILL REMEMBER

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,490
WHEN WE SAW THE BREAKING NEWS
AND WHEN WE DID THAT SHOW.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,490
I

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,710
CAN'T BELIEVE THE FIVE YEARS OF
GONE BY BUT ON THAT DAY, 20

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,730
CHILDREN AND SIX TEACHERS WERE
KILLED.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,110
HEAR THEIR PICTURES.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,039
THOSE CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY
YOUNG.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,039
SO YOUNG.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,529
THE THING THAT GOT TO ME IS
THAT THEY WOULD'VE BEEN

12
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,410
SIXTH-GRADERS TODAY.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,440
THEY WOULD BE DEVELOPING
PERSONALITIES AND INTERESTS,

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,420
HAVING IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY
WOULD WANT TO GO ON TO DO IN

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,920
THEIR CAREERS MAYBE.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,149
UNFORTUNATELY NOT, THEIR LIVES

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,720
WERE TAKEN THANKS TO A MONSTER.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,320
HERE ARE THEIR NAMES.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
WE

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,500
HOPEFULLY WILL NOT FORGET THEM.

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,730
IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS ON DAYS

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,520
LIKE THIS WE LIKE TO LOOK BACK
AND RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO WERE

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,690
TAKEN FROM US.

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,499
YOU SEE THE
CHILDREN'S NAMES AND THEN AT THE

25
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:04,360
NAME AND, THE NAMES OF THE
TEACHERS AND THANKFULLY, BECAUSE

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,270
IT'S AN ANNIVERSARY, THERE IS A
LOT OF CONVERSATION ON SOCIAL

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,270
MEDIA, PROFILES OF THE CHILDREN
IN THE TEACHERS.

28
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,270
SOME DETAILS

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,890
ABOUT THE LIVESTOCK I SAW JAKE
TAPPER WAS TWEETING ON

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,030
INDIVIDUAL FACTS ON THEM DIET IS
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO REMEMBER

31
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,490
THE VICTIMS BUT WE DO TO
RECOGNIZE THE SAME TIME THAT

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,549
WHILE A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE
WILL LOOK BACK AND THINK ABOUT

33
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:32,799
THIS, MANY WON'T AND MANY MORE
WON'T ACT AND SO IT IS NOT

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,090
REALLY A SURPRISE THAT IN THE
FIVE YEARS SINCE THAT THERE HAVE

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,010
BEEN AT LEAST 1576 MASS
SHOOTINGS WITH AT LEAST 1788

36
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,799
PEOPLE KILLED AND OVER 6000
WOUNDED AS WELL.

37
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,799
AND THOSE MASS

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,980
SHOOTINGS, THE WOUNDING'S IN
SOME WAYS CAN BE ALMOST AS

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,479
TERRIBLE AS DUST THAT WERE
TALKING ABOUT IN SOME CASES

40
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,700
WOUNDS BY ASSAULT RIFLES,
DREADFUL LIFE-CHANGING WOUNDS.

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,229
THAT IS GENERALLY, BUT EVEN IF
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

42
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,119
SOMETHING LIKE SANDY HOOK:

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:14,980
THAT IS ONE FATALLY SHOT EVERY
44 HOURS, THE EQUIVALENT OF

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,430
EVERY OTHER DAY.

45
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,400
THIS IS BEEN
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE TOO

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,790
MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE
IN POWER IN THIS COUNTRY DO NOT

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,540
LOOK BACK ON SANDY HOGAN
REMEMBER WHAT A TRAGEDY IT WAS A

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,069
DREAM OF NEVER HAVING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

49
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,069
VERY

50
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,290
OFTEN THEIR THINKING ABOUT THEIR
DONORS WHETHER THEY'RE FROM THE

51
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,170
NRA OR CONSERVATIVE
ORGANIZATIONS YOU DON'T SEE ANY

52
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,860
KIND OF GUN CONTROL DIVE WE
COULD BRING THIS UP, HARPER'S

53
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,819
PUT OUT A TWEET TODAY TALKING
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.

54
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:58,600
IS NOT TO 
SAY WE HAVEN'T

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
ACHIEVED ANYTHING.

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
THERE HAS

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,450
BEEN POSITIVE NEWS AND
LEGISLATION IN SOME STATES

58
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,500
BUT TYPICALLY THE ONES ARE
ALREADY DOING BETTER WHEN

59
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,560
IT COMES TO GUN CONTROL THE.

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,489
WE SHOULD CIRCLING THIS BY
ITS PROPER NAME.

61
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,580
IT WAS THE

62
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,190
SANDY HOOK MASSACRE AND WE ARE
ALLOWING MASSACRE AFTER MASSACRE

63
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,370
AFTER MASSACRE AND WE ARE
ALLOWING THESE FOLKS TO

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,769
TERRORIZE US AND I DON'T JUST
MEAN THE SHOOTERS, I MEAN THE

65
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,730
LOBBYISTS AND THE POLITICIANS
THAT ENABLE THE SHOOTERS, THAT

66
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:40,470
BASICALLY PUT THOSE WEAPONS IN
THEIR HANDS AND SAY, HAVE AT IT.

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,569
YOU THINK IN THIS COUNTRY
THERE'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT

68
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:49,870
PORTION THE HAS MENTAL ISSUES,
THAT IS OTHERWISE CRAZED.

69
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,870
SOME

70
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,829
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VIOLENCE
BUT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE

71
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,900
WHO HAVE MENTAL ISSUES OR
VIOLENT.

72
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
A VERY BIG NUMBER.

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,120
DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE A VERY BIG NUMBER AT ALL

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,720
TO PRODUCE 1700 MASS SHOOTINGS
SINCE SANDY HOOK IN THE LAST

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,870
FIVE YEARS.

77
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,780
HOW MANY MASSACRES
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW BEFORE WE

78
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,530
DO SOMETHING AND THE ANSWER IS
THOUSANDS.

79
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,700
YES, AND IT HAS ONLY GOTTEN
WORSE.

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
ORLANDO WAS A BIGGER

81
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,070
NUMBER AND VEGAS WAS AN EVEN
BIGGER NUMBER AND OUR

82
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,510
POLITICIANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO
REPRESENT US INSTEAD OF COURSE

83
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,490
REPRESENT THEIR DONORS AND THEY
COLLECTIVELY ARE SAYING WE DO

84
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,600
NOT CARE.

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,530
WE DON'T CARE TO
THOSE KIDS DIE.

86
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,530
WE DO NOT CARE

87
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,830
THAT WE HAVE NONSTOP MASSACRES
ALMOST ONE-A-DAY IN THIS COUNTRY

88
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,290
AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO PROTECT
THE CITIZENS BECAUSE WE GET PAID

89
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,230
BY THE NRA.

90
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,980
WE DO WANT TO AT LEAST TALK
ABOUT, THERE WERE TENS OF THE

91
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,880
LAST YEARS TO DO SOMETHING TO
TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,900
SPECIFIC, THE MOST EGREGIOUS
MASS SHOOTINGS, SO WE ARE HAVING

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,080
UNFORTUNATELY A PROBLEM WITH ONE
OF OUR GRAPHICS BUT JOE MANSION

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,710
ALONG WITH ONE OTHER SENATOR IN
THE WAKE OF SANDY HOOK PUT

95
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,310
FORWARD A BILL THAT WOULD'VE
REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR

96
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,280
ALL PRIVATE GUNSHOT TRANSFERS
RATHER THAN SIMPLY THROUGH THE

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,700
FEDERAL SYSTEMS AND
UNFORTUNATELY, THANKS TO AN

98
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,590
INCREDIBLY DECEPTIVE SMEAR
CAMPAIGN BY THE NRA THAT DID NOT

99
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,590
PASS.

100
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,840
AT THE TIME BARACK OBAMA
SAID THIS:

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,750
IN FACT, THE BILL 
WOULD'VE

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,000
STRENGTHENED THE LEGAL

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,790
PROHIBITIONS AGAINST ANY SORT OF
ORGANIZED FEDERAL REGISTRY WHILE

104
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,590
ALLOWING BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR
PRIVATE GUN TRANSFERS SO

105
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,620
THAT DIED.

106
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:43,280
IN 

107
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,120
THAT CASE DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS, THINGS AGAIN IN NO

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,050
SMALL PART TO AN ORGANIZED
LOBBYING CAMPAIGN BY THE NRA AND

109
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,190
OTHER PRO-GUN ORGANIZATIONS
VOTED THAT DOWN AND SO NO

110
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,300
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN AGAIN AFTER
SANDY HOOK AND MOST RECENTLY,

111
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,220
AFTER THE VEGAS MASSACRE THAT WE
TALKED ABOUT IN WHICH, THANKS IN

112
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,390
NO SMALL PART TO BUMP STOCKS,
THE ABILITY TO TURN A

113
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,390
SEMIAUTOMATIC

114
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:20,620
WEAPON INTO FUNCTIONALLY AN
AUTOMATIC FIREARM WE HAD:

115
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:39,960
MONTHS ARE GOING BY AND YOU CAN
BUY THESE AND REPLICATE THE

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,800
LAS VEGAS MASKER.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,810
THE FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECK
LAW THAT JOHN MENTIONED FIRST

118
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,720
HAD AND 93% APPROVAL.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,190
IF YOU
CAN'T PASS SOMETHING IN A

120
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,280
SO-CALLED DEMOCRACY THAT HAS A
93% APPROVAL, YOU MIGHT NOT BE

121
00:06:55,280 --> 00:00:00,000
IN 
A DEMOCRACY.
