1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:03,236
GROWING TO ABOUT EIGHT MILES.

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:08,375
IT'S SINCE BEEN CONTAINED.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,343
LELAND: FOUR STATES HOLDING

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,211
PRIMARY ELECTIONS THIS TUESDAY.

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,412
WE'LL GET TO PENNSYLVANIA IN A

6
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,547
COUPLE OF MINUTES.

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,148
MEANTIME, LET'S TALK ABOUT

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:15,549
IDAHO.

9
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,818
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THERE

10
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,353
ACTUALLY ONE TO WATCH.

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,188
HISTORICALLY IDAHO HAS BEEN A

12
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,023
RED STATE.

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,857
ONE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE

14
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,892
BELIEVES THERE IS A CHANCE TO

15
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,060
CHANGE THAT.

16
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,895
PAULETTE JORDAN JOINS US NOW

17
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,563
FROM BOISE.

18
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,031
NICE TO HAVE YOU WITH US, MA'AM,

19
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:31,565
WE APPRECIATE IT.

20
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,300
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, LELAND.

21
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,668
LELAND: WHEN WE SAY

22
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,736
HISTORICALLY, WE MEAN THERE

23
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,537
HASN'T BEEN A DEMOCRATIC

24
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,806
GOVERNOR SINCE 1990.

25
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:40,941
PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONGRESS

26
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,743
WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN THAT.

27
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,778
GIVE US A SENSE, WHY DO YOU

28
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,847
THINK YOU HAVE A CHANCE NOW?

29
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,482
>> WELL, WE'RE SEEING A NEW

30
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,916
TIME, A NEW AGE.

31
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,084
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE

32
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,453
EXCITED THAN EVER TO SEE A BOLD

33
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,389
NEW KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT WE

34
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,523
OFFER IN MY CANDIDACY AND I

35
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,858
FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE.

36
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,693
WE FIGHT TOGETHER FOR OUR IDAHO.

37
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,560
LELAND: DO YOU THINK--

38
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,329
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

39
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,031
EXCITEMENT IN THAT IDEA OF A

40
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,932
POSSIBLE BLUE WAVE COMING.

41
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,734
YOU'RE NOT REALLY RUNNING THOUGH

42
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,036
AS A CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT.

43
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,504
EVEN A MODERATE DEMOCRAT.

44
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,840
YOU CALL YOURSELF A PROGRESSIVE

45
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,241
DEMOCRAT.

46
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,209
THIS IS A STATE THAT BROKE HARD

47
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:16,910
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

48
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,080
HASN'T VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN

49
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,414
SINCE--

50
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:25,152
OR A DEMOCRAT SINCE LYNDON

51
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:25,786
JOHNSON FOR PRESIDENT.

52
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:26,987
IS SOMETHING CHANGING IN IDAHO

53
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,555
OR YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE

54
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,756
TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS NOW?

55
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,059
>> PEOPLE ARE MORE THAN ABOUT

56
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,561
THEIR PARTY.

57
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,865
THEY'RE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY.

58
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,434
WE HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF

59
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,635
VALUE SYSTEM WHOLLY CONNECTED TO

60
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,969
THE LAND AND PEOPLE ARE READY

61
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,439
FOR TRUST, THEY'RE READY FOR

62
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,473
INTEGRITY AND THEY WANT REAL

63
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,341
LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S WHAT WE

64
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,377
SEE IN MY CAMPAIGN AND

65
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:50,744
CANDIDACY.

66
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,778
LELAND: POLICY-WISE, WHAT'S

67
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,380
WRONG IN IDAHO IN YOUR MIND THAT

68
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,514
NEEDS FIXING?

69
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,484
>> WELL, FROM EDUCATION TO OUR

70
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,820
HEALTH CARE, WE HAVE AN EXPANDED

71
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,155
ACCESS TO 62,000 INDIVIDUALS IN

72
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:02,756
OUR STATES.

73
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,392
WE HAVE TO DO BETTER.

74
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,493
WE ARE FACING DILAPIDATED

75
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,428
SCHOOLS, WE ARE DEFUNDING OUR

76
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,395
PUBLIC EDUCATION, NOT SUPPORTING

77
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,997
OUR TEACHERS WHO ARE NOW GOING

78
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,734
TO OTHER STATES, OUR NEIGHBORING

79
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,702
STATES LIKE WASHINGTON AND

80
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,939
IDAHO--

81
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,408
EXCUSE ME, OREGON, WE HAVE TO DO

82
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,677
BETTER AND WE HAVE TO PROVIDE

83
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,878
NEW LEADERSHIP THAT WILL DEFEND

84
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,712
THE PEOPLE AND PUBLIC LANDS.

85
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,147
LELAND: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

86
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,449
LAND, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR

87
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,918
FAMILY, ON THOSE LANDS FOR

88
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,319
CENTURIES.

89
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,086
HOW MUCH OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE

90
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,689
TALKING ABOUT HAVE TO DO WITH

91
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,957
NATIVE AMERICAN ISSUES?

92
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,625
>> WELL, IT'S CLEARLY STATED

93
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,427
THAT WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO

94
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,262
IDAHO, WHEN YOU COME TO OUR

95
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,163
COMMUNITIES, ALL THE ISSUES,

96
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,231
WHETHER IT'S DEALING WITH OUR

97
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,533
PUBLIC LANDS, FIGHTING FOR OUR

98
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,767
ENVIRONMENT, FOR CLEAN AIR AND

99
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,402
WATER, FIGHTING FOR EDUCATION,

100
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,071
FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE, THOSE

101
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,507
ARE NOT JUST INDIGENOUS ISSUES.

102
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,977
THEY'RE ISSUES FOR EVERY SINGLE

103
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:57,310
IDAHOAN.

104
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,044

ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEMOCRATIC

107
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,281
GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION AND

108
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:01,648
OTHERS?

109
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,450
DO THEY THINK THIS EVEN HAS A

110
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,586
CHANCE TO BE MUCH LESS WINNABLE,

111
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,889
BUT A FAIR FIGHT WITH WHOEVER

112
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,158
WINS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION?

113
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,363
>> I THINK ONCE WE WIN ON MAY

00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,031
15TH, WE'LL SEE THEM COME

115
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,431
TOGETHER.

116
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,467

THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR'S

120
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,505
ASSOCIATION WILL CERTAINLY BE

121
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:25,839
THERE.

122
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,374
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE

123
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,708
NATIONAL LEVEL WILL BE THERE FOR

124
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,042
SUPPORT.

125
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,010
LELAND: I'LL TAKE THAT TO BE

126
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,512
THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE YET?

127
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,148
