having women make the first move might
seem like a a small product change but
it actually has a huge punch so
oftentimes men are always expected to
send that first note so when they
receive the first the first text I think
it's extremely flattering so we have
found something very interesting
response rates go up by 60% when you
personalize the first line so instead of
saying hey exclamation point if you say
hey and include their name your chance
of a response goes up by 60%
so personalizing a first message really
really helps we always say use a little
humor and some light heartedness that
that usually wins
