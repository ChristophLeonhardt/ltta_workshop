restaurant so I'm sure gonna like it
cool well let's say pick you up for n
six great see you then okay but hey so
today is kind of a big day I've been in
a room all summer making videos and I
haven't really gotten a chance to go out
much so I finally met my buddy talked me
into arranging a blind date and I'll be
honest I'm a little nervous I've never
actually been on a blind date so I want
to go all out so I booked one of the
fanciest restaurants in Toronto and I'm
gonna be spending the day making myself
a classier human being so today I'm
gonna be showing you to prepare for a
date the classy way a truly classy guy
make sure that every little thing about
him is perfect starting with the hair
the foot POC know this slicked back
you're gonna just my regular hair style
someone mess with perfection the next
thing it needs the clean shave it what
better way to do it then with a straight
razor I've never really used one of
these before so try and bear with me oh
okay um I'm a better idea
a true gentleman knows his area of
expertise I wasn't about to just skin
half my face but I've got Dave here to
do it for me to shave me not to skin
mine you know what never mind
nothing says classy like a nice suit
what do you guys think you take a big
blind
