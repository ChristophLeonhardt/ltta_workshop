1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,894
>> Shannon: BIPARTISAN CALLS,

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:03,295
TOO.

3
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:04,562
THANK YOU FOR MONITORING THAT IS

4
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:08,199
OUR NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN FIGHTING

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,703
A LONG MUCK AROUND THE CLOCK

6
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:14,339
IN AN EFFORT TO GET TO BRUNSON'S

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,308
RELEASE.

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,275
WELCOME CONGRESSMAN,

9
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:17,676
MARK WALKER.

10
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:18,310
>> THANK YOU, SHANNON.

11
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,845
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

12
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,314
>> Shannon: I KNOW YOU SHARE A

13
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:22,681
KINSHIP.

14
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,649
YOU WERE A PASTOR, AS WELL.

15
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,151
YOU WERE VERY CONNECTED TO THIS

16
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:26,451
CASE.

17
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:27,719
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT

18
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,187
THE REACTION FROM THE PASTOR OR

19
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:30,188
HIS FAMILY AS HIS GOODNESS

20
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,059
INTRODUCED TO SPREAD?

21
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,393
>> IT'S BEEN A CELEBRATION TODAY

22
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:38,330
EVEN WITH US BEING IN THE PATH

23
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,298
OF THIS NASTY HURRICANE, I THINK

24
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,333
WE HAVE A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND

25
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,969
NORTH CAROLINIANS WITHOUT POWER,

26
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,704
BUT IN OUR CIRCLE, THIS IS A

27
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:46,871
GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA.

28
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,673
IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR THE BRUNSON

29
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,007
FAMILY.

30
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,076
WE HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP

31
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,244
WITH HIS DAUGHTER, WHO JUST

32
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:54,913
RECENTLY SAID TO ONE OF OUR

33
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:56,881
COMMITTEE MEETINGS, I REMEMBER

34
00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:58,550
HER SHARING THOMAS SHANNON, THAT

35
00:00:58,551 --> 00:00:59,284
SHE WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO

36
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:00,118
THE DAY THAT HER DADDY COULD

37
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,456
WALK HER DOWN THE AISLE.

38
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:08,026
BEING THE FATHER OF A

39
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:08,927
12-YEAR-OLD, THAT WAS A POWERFUL

40
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:09,294
STATEMENT.

41
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:10,195
THE FACT THAT THAT GETS TO

42
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,663
HAPPEN NOW, IT'S BEEN A TEAM

43
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:12,864
EFFORT.

44
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,265
WE WORK HARD WITH OUR FINANCIAL

45
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,268
TURKISH INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE

46
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:18,470
ABLE TO GET U.S. TRADE

47
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,537
REPRESENTATIVES AND BE ABLE,

48
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,073
WORKING WITH THE WORLD BANK,

49
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:23,875
REFUSED THE LOANS TO THE TURKISH

50
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:24,275
GOVERNMENT.

51
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:28,079
GREAT WORK THERE, GREAT WORK.

52
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,880
BUT THE TRUTH CHAMPIONS IN THIS,

53
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:33,685
YOU HAVE TO GET CREDIT TO

54
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:34,452
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND

55
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:35,353
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO WERE THE

56
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:36,855
HOME RUN HITTERS IN GETTING THIS

57
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:37,155
DONE.

58
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:38,289
>> Shannon: THEY HAVE BEEN

59
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,090
RELENTLESS ABOUT THIS.

60
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,692
WHEN PEOPLE SAY, WHAT DID YOU

61
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:42,360
HAVE TO DO TO GET BRUNSON HOME

62
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,129
CUSTOMER HEARS WITH THE

63
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,596
PRESIDENT SAID.

64
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:44,830
>> THERE WAS NO

65
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:46,998
DEAL MADE.

66
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,467
THERE WAS NO DEAL AT ALL.

67
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,036
BUT, WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE

68
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,671
HIM AND HAVE HIM IN GOOD SHAPE.

69
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,873
I HEAR HE'S IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.

70
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,775
>> Shannon: THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

71
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:59,244
THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO GIVING YOU

72
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,512
CREDIT AND MANY OF THE LAWMAKERS

73
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:01,746
THAT YOU MENTIONED IN THEIR

74
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,249
STATEMENT TODAY BUT ADDING THIS,

75
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,417
"WE REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED

76
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:06,484
ABOUT THE CONTINUED DETENTION OF

77
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:07,285
OTHER UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN

78
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:10,288
TURKEY AND AROUND THE WORLD AND

79
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,223
HOPE FOR A RESOLUTION IN ALL

80
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:13,358
THESE CASES IN A TRANSPARENT AND

81
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,459
FAIR MANNER."

82
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,461
GOOD NEWS FOR THE BRUNSON

83
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,897
FAMILY, BUT NOT FOR THE FAMILIES

84
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,032
OF OTHER DETAINEES, AS WELL.

85
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,167
>> NO QUESTION.

86
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,234
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE

87
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:26,271
RELENTLESS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

88
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,073
TAKE A MOMENT TO PAUSE AND

89
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,274
APPLAUD THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR

90
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,475
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THEIR

91
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:30,775
WORDS.

92
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,578
A LOT OF PEOPLE, SPECIFICALLY IN

93
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,345
THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY, HAVE

94
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,648
BEEN ASKED, WHY WOULD YOU

95
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:37,482
SUPPORT A PRESIDENT?

96
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:39,150
AND WE CONTINUE TO SAY REALLY

97
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,086
ONE EXAMPLE AFTER THE OTHER WHY

98
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,488
WE PUT THE POLICY AHEAD OF THE

99
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,289
PERSONALITY, AT TIMES.

100
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,690
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HIM SAYING

101
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:47,992
I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

102
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,828
IT, SPECIFICALLY AS A

103
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,261
HUMANITARIAN.

104
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:52,397
MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RELIGIOUS

105
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:53,631
BRADYS AND THE INFRACTIONS WE

106
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,265
SEE WORLDWIDE.

107
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,934
HE IS LEADING ON THESE EFFORTS.

108
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:56,668
>> Shannon: WE ARE ALMOST OUT

109
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,470
OF TIME BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU

110
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,437
ABOUT THE CASE OF

111
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:00,438
JAMAL KHASHOGGI AND THE SAUDIS.

112
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,341
WHERE DOES THIS GO FROM HERE?

113
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:08,780
>> I THINK FIRST OF ALL, IF

114
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:12,650
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE

115
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,052
AWRY, WE THINK RIGHT NOW EARLY

116
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,086
EVIDENCE IS SHOWING THERE HAS

117
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:16,254
BEEN SOME FOUL PLAY HERE.

118
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:16,955
WE DO HAVE TO ACT ON THAT BUT

119
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,557
NOT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE BACK

120
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,459
OFF AND ARMS DEAL AND LET THE

121
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,660
SAUDIS GET INVOLVED WITH THE

122
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,062
RUSSIANS OR THE CHINESE AND

123
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,630
WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE ARMS.

124
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,098
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

125
00:03:27,099 --> 00:00:00,000
STAY INVOLVED AND KEEP THOSE
