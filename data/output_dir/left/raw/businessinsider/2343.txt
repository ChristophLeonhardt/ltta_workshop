1
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question comes from SC</font>

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan he says do you genuinely think</font>

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a v-shaped</font>

4
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,859
recovery um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I really don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,420
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be v-shaped or what</font>

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,949
people really<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean by be shaped I mean</font>

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,349
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really depends on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how steep of a ve</font>

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,270
or you're expecting I think it's pretty

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,190
obvious we already had a recovery I mean

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,719
I a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things have recovered but I</font>

11
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,129
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the more more relevant</font>

12
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,570
question is you know are there some

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,760
industries that will be doing better<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,039
the future regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,629
a weak recovery but you know a company

16
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,480
like Coke in 5-10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or you know do</font>

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,829
you think they'll still be a growing

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,420
business and are they cheap now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,960
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think yeah i think it's it's</font>

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,899
kind of a it's difficult for anyone to

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,930
know really how you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,700
how steep the recovery will be but it's

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,869
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that I you know I do</font>

24
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,520
believe that we've passed you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,439
worst point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a second question from</font>

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">mick lassen he says do you agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,100
much of China's recent boom has resulted

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,990
in a housing bubble in the large cities

29
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,049
I think yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sure for sure and I</font>

30
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one big reason is that for a lot</font>

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,500
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> China they actually don't</font>

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have many options for investment so</font>

33
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,180
really housing real estate is one of

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,520
really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most you know you have to</font>

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">think in terms of their history</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,170
banking system maybe wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,700
dependable so the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependable thing</font>

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,700
to have is really land and property and

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,200
now the obviously now stocks or another

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,970
option but I think yeah historically

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,439
that's sort of really one of their few

42
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,970
options and so they're all going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,280
and obviously stimulative policies in

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,189
China are stimulating that and in a

45
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,800
place like Hong Kong

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,720
then you also have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultra-low</font>

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,250
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> rates so another question do</font>

48
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,289
you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> China will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

49
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">sustain its growth I think it's I mean</font>

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,920
China's going to grow over for sure in a

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,630
long term I think that's so so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

52
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,420
yes it'll sustain it the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely</font>

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,330
scenario is that yeah they keep growing

54
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,820
rapidly they might have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> violence</font>

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,340
slow down you know maybe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year or in</font>

56
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,380
a few years but still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term path</font>

57
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,890
I mean is for growth it's it's it's it

58
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,390
just wouldn't make sense for for so many

59
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,340
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have such a lower center of</font>

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,790
living to not sort of be able to use all

61
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the technologies and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> innovations that we</font>

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,480
have in developed countries and do sort

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,160
of a like it's basically tech transfer

64
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,400
to develop its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> country so so I think</font>

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah i mean the growth path is for sure</font>

66
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,600
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's a matter of you know has</font>

67
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,120
it gone too fast most recently and you

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
know will there be you know some you

69
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,560
know pretty sharp downturn in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> near</font>

70
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,300
term another question from gym is it

71
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,730
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ethanol can end global warming</font>

72
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,730
concerns in 10 years you know I think

73
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this question I mean my global warming</font>

74
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,170
concerns I've already ended so so I

75
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,770
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not really relevant sir</font>

76
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,550
another question from sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> lorenz if the</font>

77
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,070
oil price would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> determined by a</font>

78
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,160
simple supply demand mechanism would it

79
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,930
be higher or lower than fifty dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

80
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,760
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a limb here I'm</font>

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,950
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be lower the</font>

82
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,350
reason being is that you know you have

83
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,220
OPEC so so OPEC is purposely restricting

84
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,640
the amount of oil that that exists

85
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,050
basically on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market at any time</font>

86
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,260
right now OPEC actually the its surplus

87
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,570
capacity is actually I think it's not

88
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,700
like a multi-year high right now so I

89
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,989
think for sure obviously if you didn't

90
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a giant you know group of Nations</font>

91
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,200
restricting the amount of oil out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,780
oil price would be far lower and I'll go

93
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a limb and say that be well below</font>

94
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,600
fifty dollars another question from GP

95
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,360
is it time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell yet</font>

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,010
so what I'm guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> stocks you know I</font>

97
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,269
made this thing to top I think it all

98
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,550
depends on the stock obviously the

99
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,600
markets come a long way but I think it

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,250
depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the industry i would say i</font>

101
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,330
would say an interesting place to look

102
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually talked about this</font>

103
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,800
yesterday is actually look at rather

104
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,960
than fully selling stocks actually

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,430
taking output protection which

106
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,800
essentially buying put options to

107
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,260
protect your stocks you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

108
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,170
some names that might make sense another

109
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,090
question from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sir Lorenz yes what's the</font>

110
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">best place to party in Bangkok I think</font>

111
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,200
it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's quite a few</font>

113
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,710
places i would say if if you are in town

114
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,780
there and you want like a sort of a

115
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,580
really nice place there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

116
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,650
called the state tower where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

117
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,260
basically it's a huge open-air bar on

118
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,990
the 60th floor of this huge tower it's

119
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,460
quite nice if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

120
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,130
something just like sort of a local and

121
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,650
just nuts<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say you want to go to</font>

122
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,440
this place called RCA it's a giant it's

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,570
a giant strip of clubs with music

124
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,580
blasting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the streets and yeah</font>

125
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,400
thousands of people it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty fun</font>

126
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,830
another question about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thailand what's</font>

127
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,190
the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> living in Bangkok it really</font>

128
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,229
depends how you want to live you can

129
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,419
live really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap you can also live at a</font>

130
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,360
pretty high standard of living but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,919
would say overall you have about it's

132
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,740
about half the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. yeah you</font>

133
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,090
can you can live quite well you it's

134
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,790
easy to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice condo swimming pool</font>

trips to islands and you can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

137
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,090
basically a normal salary have you

138
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,690
traded or done market related work yeah

139
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean I personally been investing on</font>

140
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,700
money for<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite some time now I've</font>

141
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,910
worked both on the buy and sell side so

142
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,740
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked at a buy-side portfolio</font>

143
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,860
manager I've I've worked with a

144
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,590
multi-strategy hedge fund called Riley

145
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,500
capital partners I also worked

149
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,310
Hong Kong do you have any political

150
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,530
philosophy so to speak yeah um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

151
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,980
I'm generally very<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess people would</font>

152
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,790
say I mean I like I like to have

153
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,950
economic freedoms and countries so I i

154
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,440
generally lean towards anything that

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,560
allows individuals and individual groups

156
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,780
or corporations that have the freedom to

157
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,669
pursue their own economic interests long

158
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,380
as you don't obviously infringe on other

159
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,100
people's rights at the same time though

160
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,810
I have to admit I'm a bit nuanced where

161
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,700
I'm not like some ultra libertarian I

162
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,240
actually do believe in having some sort

163
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,940
of social safety net because I do think

164
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,040
there are people who just fall into bad

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad luck and those people</font>

166
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,460
actually I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more productive in</font>

167
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,740
a long term to kind of catch those

168
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,380
people and help them sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

169
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,190
rehabilitate themselves into the economy

170
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,350
rather than just let them you know crash

171
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,479
and burn so I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit nuanced there but</font>

172
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,370
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say I lean towards a sort of</font>

173
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,460
having them the liberal economy finally

174
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,010
from Don flamenco do you think being

175
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,320
openly biased is the future of

176
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,200
journalism yes I do I think it's a whole

177
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,330
different situation now there's tons of

178
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,710
information out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there if you just want</font>

179
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,140
straight data it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web it's</font>

180
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,190
everywhere I think if there's no opinion

181
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,250
or analysis then it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

182
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">just data if you want actual value on</font>

183
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,010
you know on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> information I think</font>

184
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,650
there should be opinion and analysis

185
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,150
because that's that's a perspective it

186
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,630
really means everything so that's it I

187
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you know I'll see you next</font>

188
00:08:17,010 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and thanks a lot for watching</font>
