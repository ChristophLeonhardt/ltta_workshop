in short users you can now have TYT the palm of your hand our TYT app is available for download in the Google Play Store just go to TYT comm slash app to find out more conspiracy theories have dominated political discussions since 2015 and unfortunately conspiracy theories continue to happen conspiracy groups continue to form and a recent example of that would be queuing on now this is a group of people who believe all sorts of conspiracy theories we're gonna outline a few of them for you in just a moment but they are part of a group online 8chan or infinity chan as they're called and i'll give you some more details so this anonymous user claiming to be a government agent with top security clearance waging war against the so called deep state in service to the 45th president Trump Q feeds disciples or bakers scraps of intelligence or breadcrumbs that they scramble to bake into an understanding of the storm the communities term drawn from Trump's cryptic reference last year to the calm before the storm for the president's final conquest over elites globalists and deep state saboteurs so I want to pull my hair out now the reason why I'm bringing this up really quickly is because you would think like come on I mean whatever it's online it's probably like a group of teenagers it's not something serious except Trump was recently at a rally in Florida and there were a shocking number of people sporting cue paraphernalia either shirts or signs whatever it is so let's just quickly go to graphic 21 where you'll see an example this was a photo shared by the Washington Post and also Adam Smith had tweeted that it is stunning to me how many people in this Trump Tampa crowd have queuing on shirts or t-shirts signs or t-shirts that is not a healthy sign for the GOP or for America I agree with you on that okay I have to get into the details because they are amazing so you might have already heard about some of it we're so and I'm gonna preface this to be super clear these are not true for those who are incredibly stupid they could it be true okay so first of all they're obsessed with child sex rings obsessed and this started with the all right and the alt light and they accuse every one of their enemies of being pedophiles so we saw it happen we showed it to you on the show way before anyone in the mainstream media picked it up and now everyone in this insane conspiracy theories are pedophiles including they randomly picked Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks and we're calling from home alone right Macaulay Culkin sorry okay and Seth Green whatever these guys are not better miles it's just and it's hashtag pedo would which is unfortunate in a couple of different ways okay so so and then now tell them Hanks us to come out and go yeah I'm not a pedophile like it's insanity okay so you might have heard that but it gets crazier how could it get crazier than that because some of it is so weird like it's hard to understand so Q I mean who believes that there's an actual EQ inside the government okay wait hold I want to respond to that for a second there is literally one person who is anonymous claiming to be part of the CIA who is now working against the CIA like that's all it takes that's all any random person can just go on one of these forums one of these groups and just say I am I have gone rogue I'm now speaking out against the deep stick come on guys like we need we need to fund education so important so so understand that this stuff comes originally from like 4chan nee-chan a stuff so i know that a certain percentage of people that are playing along are doing it for lulz for shiggles right and and the guy who probably started is laughing his ass off or you know the group of people etc so I know that that's a certain percentage but another percentage a sizable percentage believe it's real so in but didn't get get this twist Q says Robert Muller is actually a white hat what is the white hat he's actually a good guy he's actually setting up the deep state and he's gonna at the end of his investigation reveal that people were actually guilty of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that's yep that's exactly what's happening yes that is what is happening okay and but and of course by the way I should be clear Obama Clinton and George Soros of course and hold we're not done yet they're planning a coup that Muller is going to stop okay and and they traffic children in their spare time of course oh hey so but when Muller comes out and doesn't do that what are they gonna do I know there's on to the next conspiracy well what were there ever FEMA camps at Obama setup no doesn't matter that the UN ever forced us in The Hobbit homes yeah the Jade helm conspiracy ever happen it doesn't matter doesn't matter we're on to the next one right so I'm not anywhere near done I know I know you're not so I'm gonna dig deeper into this and and produce something for no filter because there's a lot going on but one of the things that one of our interns looked into was whether or not people are donating money to this cause and they absolutely are and we're talking about elderly people you know handing over their social security checks handing over gas cards all sorts of things I mean yes you're right I think that there are you know there's some percentage of people who think this is just funny and they're playing along but I think the more nefarious part about all of this is the defamation that people are dealing with and the fact that people are getting scammed out of their own money and guys and let alone the actual danger when people believe this remember with pizza gate which was incredibly similar and these guys apparently believed in peace of gate to of course right a guy went and actually shot up the place because he thought there was a child sex ring in the basement yeah organized by Democrats and so now look some of the minute stuff is funny and some of it is dangerous so more funny stuff they believe that JP Morgan the American here the old with the back in the back in the day sunk to Titanic I mean but didn't he but didn't he why is it part of this conspiracy no iceberg it was no iceberg nothing straight ahead okay another funny one and they believe in a fascist philosophy and the movies of Francis Ford Coppola what so apparently Spielberg's a bad guy but Coppola he knew he knew poor Fork I don't know who I feel worse for Francis Steven Spielberg or braces for Coppola he said wait wait wait I didn't mean anything I just just feel bad for America all together because that makes a lot more sense yeah and and so okay now here comes a dangerous ones so of course they go to the well on the Rothschilds so it's the Illuminati and it's the Jewish bankers no and they lead a satanic cult and guess who's one of the very few people on earth who's figured out that satanic cult and fights against it Vladimir Putin so that way you tie it all up in a nice bow that's why Trump works with Putin because he's against the evil Jew bankers who run the world oh Jesus Christ right and they think that there's going to be a Great Awakening and that there is going to be a Christian revival that priests ages their victory so now it's not funny anymore right now these are dangerous people and they're all they're all right wing they're almost all armed and they have lost their minds and their and even if you were in the crowd who's doing it for lulz it's not funny man I know that like that's the rare situation where you feel like you've got some power and so you feel empowered to go with this and you think it's fun it's not fun when people get shot it's not fun when you spread anti-semitic conspiracy theories that's gonna get people killed and and lead us down a dark dark path I mean let alone of course all the other racism bigotry et cetera that goes along with this stew of insanity and speaking of insanity there are a couple of so-called celebrities and no to be fair they are real celebrities have bought into it on surprising you you can guess it Roseanne Barr of course and Curt Schilling of course yeah and Curt Schilling he she's a strange dude like no no dirt like that we're having and that's why when the media does that neutrality stuff it tries to be crazy they're not on cue and on their be calling it of course as it is because this is so over the top right but when they're like oh you know that he says she said I don't know Curt Schilling is a conservative and then other people are this and we're having a legitimate conversation we're not having a legitimate conversation curtly has lost his mind he thinks that the Rothschilds in the den and JP Morgan sunk the Titanic there was no iceberg whatever right and so anyone who believes not just all of this but any of this is that on another planet and finally look to things in the old days it's not like these people didn't exist but the great thing about the internet is also the worst part of it the thing about the internet and then you get both stand there's no way around it it was a great thing but then it is that you form communities except now they have formed a community of lunatics the lunatics existed all the time it was just nothing to bring them together right there was no way of mobilizing that that's right now the craziest people in the country are armed and have been brought together and energized and then sent into the world believing things that are not true and told these are the people who control your lives the implicit next sentence being and sometimes not implicit sometimes said out loud aren't you gonna do anything about it these groups formed and I saw Jim Acosta did you know he's running a Twitter video of his experience there one of the guys had a sign with all this on it the rally yeah he's one of members at the Florida rally so now the question cut because you should have start asking elected officials that are of the party where they're targeting these groups of people what do you think about this group does and growing with your platform behind them why are they your events yeah what are you gonna say about it because eventually we know how politicians are if enough people because it's already happening if enough people no matter how insane they are say things and build up some kind of energy behind it those dopes energize and mobilize them as long as it supports them getting back in office yeah so I mean the things that are being said and that are being apologized for the Donald Trump is doing are just slightly less insane than what these guys are talking about but we're accepting because both were mobilized and they're letting people get in office so how long before we law these people to have these platforms that are being legitimized because they need to get office I I love that you brought that up remember this is Trump's brand Trump loves conspiracy theories I mean he was one of the leaders of the birther conspiracy theory against Obama so this is his brand this is something that he embraces and yeah that's right he's the chief lunatic he's the guy who said there's three million undocumented immigrants that voted in the election and he's the one who said Ted Cruz's dad might have killed John Kennedy full-blown maniac he thinks that Obama personally wiretap Trump yes so and and the list goes on so and and to be fair to the media what do you do in a situation where a person who has lost his mind is the President of the United States and he leads a bunch of conspiracy theorists who are armed and dangerous I'll give you one small thing we can do to fight back and it's a tiny thing but it and look whatever I suggest this I don't know if they'll catch on or not but let's throw it out there and see what happens they have a following we have a large following they're wearing cue shirts let's start wearing v shirts I've be next okay I don't know sometimes too though no nothing against Phoenix right they don't for heavyset man it's not as good okay but we'll make them on we'll put them on shop TYT calm I don't know how long it'll take but and I'll tell you why so I want to outnumber them so they see these cue shirts and Y V V for Vendetta before very toss which means truth as opposed to the conspiracies right they don't even exist yet you make them I don't know we'll make him you make him wear the V shirts and so that you know look I know it's deeply disconcerting that a significant percentage of this country has not only lost its mind but gathered in a community of people who are deeply unstable but we do outnumber them I hope so yes we definitely do so that's at least a visible way of showing that all right it's an idea we'll throw it out there hashtag V and see what happens two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on
