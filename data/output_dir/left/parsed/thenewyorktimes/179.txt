“We don’t have
good trade deals.”
“Nafta is the worst trade
deal maybe ever signed.”
“Do we make any
good deals anymore?”
“Let me be clear.
These tariffs are
totally unacceptable.
The American administration
has made a decision today
that we deplore
and obviously is
going to lead to retaliatory
measures, as it must.”
“There were
different scenarios,
but obviously today,
unfortunately, the worst case
scenario was presented,
which is imposing tariffs
on your allies.”
“I regret the protectionist decision
of the U.S. administration
on steel and aluminum.
I’m hoping that it will be
possible to avoid
an escalation, because we don’t
want to have a trade war.
We want to have a
real dialogue with the U.S.
But again, I regret
such a decision.”
