as Bob Muller keeps racking up these indictments putting heat on the Trump White House some are asking whether this probe could ever lead to the most existential question in our system of government can a prosecutor in the executive branch indict the head of that branch a sitting president during the Nixon era Watergate prosecutors determined that a president could not be indicted in office only after he left office but lately many critics of this president say yes it is I think constitutional to die - sitting president I mean the the bottom line legal issue is the president is not above the law my view is a sitting president can lawfully be indicted to deny categorically that a president can can be indicted is to say that that president is above the law now those are interesting opinions including from to current members of Congress but this question will not be resolved by anyone's personal opinion what matters here are the written legal authorities and there really are two big ones here the first as always is the Constitution which creates the congressional process to remove a president for high crimes and misdemeanors but before anyone gets anywhere near there the second written Authority is the DOJ rules that authorize the special counsel the rules that gave Rod Rosenstein that power to appoint Moeller in the first place after Jim Comey's dramatic firing and they govern all the big calls in this case like how much autonomy and money Miller gets whether a final report goes public the documentation and of course any question about indicted a sitting president now if Muller ever wanted to consider that he'd have to get through Rosenstein and a Justice Department opinion back from the Clinton era which does state you can't indict the president it's from an office of legal counsel inside the DOJ and that is what Eric Holder was referring to when pressed on this very issue by Rachel Maddow I think some fairly persuasive arguments that can be made that a president can be indicted now you know the the the controlling opinion at least at this point is the one from the Office of Legal Counsel which says that that in fact is not not correct the control part so there you go the Constitution and the DOJ rules governing Miller so what are those authorities mean is that the end of it where those DOJ rules meant to stop someone like Miller from ever going beyond that memo what would the author of those original DOJ rules say I mean that that would be interesting to find out right now well the man who wrote those rules and who served as Barack Obama's top lawyer at the Supreme Court arguing over 30 cases winning an Obamacare case serving as Acting Solicitor General he is here tonight Neil Koch all former acting Solicitor General under President Obama thank you for doing this such a pleasure ari if a council a special counsel like Muller thought there was grounds to indict a president one how does that work with him in Rosenstein and to to the rules that you wrote mean that he is restricted from doing that by that previous DOJ memo so I think the first thing to think about is just how extraordinary this is before getting into your question I mean the conversation is moved from is Russia hoax or something like that to can President Trump be indicted and comparisons going back to Watergate and Nixon and that's not a good sign for President Trump as people start comparing him to Nixon and looking at Nixon there are precedents the way that I think this unfolds in practice is that Muller will let's say that Muller has the goods that the president has committed crimes he then has to think to himself what independence do I have well the special counsel regulations though written in 1999 basically say Muller you're under the supervision of the Deputy Attorney General who's the acting Attorney General for this case rod Rosenstein now he'll then say to rod you know I maybe want to indict the president but there's this office of legal counsel this prior opinion from 20 years ago that says I can't do I have permission to do so the regulations say Muller you're bound by DOJ policy but you can seek exceptions and so that's what I expect he would do so let me read from that again we're reading from something that I don't know I'm curious if when you wrote it you knew it would become so central to a big issue in the country but it says a special council shall comply with the rules procedures policies of the Department of Justice and that memo that Eric Holder and you have cited says the indictment of criminal prosecution of a sitting president quote would be unconstitutional which seems like good news for any president including this one to ask you the very narrow legal point is your view that at a basic level that means that doing so would be against DOJ rules under under what you wrote well I just remember the regulations also say that the special counsel can seek a departure from the established DOJ policies with the permission of the acting Attorney General so I think that's the way this unfolds and you're absolutely right that this old opinion from 20 years ago does preclude in general the Justice Department from indicted a sitting president for constitutional reasons and so the an exception can be so if we go down this hypothetical which is something that you have a lot more experience than I do on given all your Supreme Court arguments but if you go down that hypothetical and they disagree and rod Rosenstein says no I don't think this is a position for a departure a in your view is that just his simple legitimate lawful call to make and be is that something that we would all learn about it is a hundred percent as lawful call to make and yes it would be something we learned about so this is something we spent a long time on in 1998 and 99 in drafting the regulations the idea was if the acting Attorney General interferes with the special counsel in any way either because of a cover-up or because of whatever reason may be legitimate reasons he's got to report that to Congress he's got a reported not just the majority in Congress but also the minority party so the regulations say look we're gonna shed sunlight on any sort of interference with the investigation and really they say they have three parts for when the reporting to Congress is triggered one is when you point a special counsel the second is when you end a special counsel and the third and most important is if the acting Attorney General in some way says no to on something so molar who's a very by-the-book s person who'd ordinarily follow DOJ policy in every circumstance I think would look at these regulations and if he has really the goods and we don't know whether he does I'm President Trump or not but if he did I think he'd say to himself look I've got to ask permission at least from the acting Attorney General can I indict and if the indictment if the acting Attorney General says no that then triggers the reporting requirement to Congress and allows us all to find out about it right good you all just gonna say you're educating us on something that is really in the weeds but you know it because you wrote it in so important I haven't heard a lot of people make the point you just did which is that even on other issues say not indicted the president which is this very dramatic topic but let's say that Muller was asking for expanded authority to go into a whole new dimension or area and that mr. Rosen Stein determined lawfully that he shouldn't go in that area you're saying your rules would trigger reporting to Congress so we would all know that happened exactly that that was the central concern you know we're in but you know it's a kind of platonic question who's guarding the Guardians and you always have to worry from the standpoint of public perception how do we issue reassure the public that this investigation is being carried on fairly without interference well one way to do so is to say look if the acting Attorney General who's the president's guy you remember rod Rosenstein is the president's appointee to the Justice Department but if he says no to Muller on something then he's got to tell Congress about it and that sunlight as Louis Brandeis said Justice Brandeis is often the best disinfectant the best in fact and also a great source of vitamin D hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
