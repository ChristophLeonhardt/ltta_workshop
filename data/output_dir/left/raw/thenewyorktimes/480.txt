Hi, I'm Melissa Chiu director of
the Hirshhorn Museum and

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,513
Sculpture Garden in Washington.

3
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,748
We're standing here in

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,018
Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror
Room.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,753
It's called Phalli's Field and

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,455
it was created in 1965.

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,890
It was the very first

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,258
Infinity Mirror room.

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,329
Each of the Infinity Mirror
rooms in the exhibition

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,331
differs.

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,434
The common thread is that

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,105
you, standing inside
this very intimate space,

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,810
feel as if there are infinite 
views of yourself,

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,345
but also the other elements.

15
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,113
And they could be light,

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,215
illuminated pumpkins

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,651
or even lanterns.

18
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:57,290
One of the works is just
a very simple strings of light.

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,828
which create this sense of you

20
00:01:01,828 --> 00:00:00,000
being alone in the cosmos.
