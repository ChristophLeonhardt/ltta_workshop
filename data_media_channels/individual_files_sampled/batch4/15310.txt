hey everybody what is going on happy Monday a lot to talk about now let me know if you I had tweak some settings this morning so let me know if you can hear me if my audio and video is okay because we were playing around with some settings trying to get these stream problems resolved for you and it's a bit a bit difficult a lot happening over the weekend we had the fisa application released hey william from london how are you we had the fisa application released and some pretty big threats from Donald Trump toward Iran got my Superman mug my American flag shirt I am ready to rock all right let's talk about this far as application Wow Greg is from Australia we've got the UK we've got Paul in Toronto Paul gonna be talking about that shooting the Dan Fritz shooting in Toronto probably tomorrow I want to get some more information on that first very preliminary right now and trying to reach out to some contacts I have up in the RCMP and in Toronto PD if I could find that a little bit more about that so if you guys are wondering why we're not doing that today I want to analyze that when we have some more info on it that all being said let some nice chaired grim reaper says thanks man that was a had this for like ten years had it made from my old office about another one at home and it Bosco's in the house Wow em you guys are all Zorich went on a junior greetings from Miami Florida my old hometown him up a little bit north of you now but down in Miami all the time my Mo's about to have a bad day John Duncan says right let's get into it so the FISA application was released the left is spinning this they're saying oh it proves that they did notify that they did notify Moeller the FISA Court that the that the steel dossier was paid opposition research except they didn't let me give you my analysis as a guy who submitted warrant applications as to the biggest problem with well few of my biggest problems number one it tells us that the entire case was predicated upon the steel dossier paid opposition research now they didn't they didn't tell the court the most important detail about the steel dossier that it was unverified in fact I've been digging through this Feist application since about 5:00 a.m. this morning and wood jumps out at me the most is that the the signatures on the applicants call me and Sally Yates and all the other players you know of repeatedly throughout the four hundred and twelve pages certify that the information contained therein is accurate it was not steel dossier was based upon unvetted and unverified Russian sources unverified Russian sources roy lopez says if i commented on the attack in canada and i'm gonna talk about the Danford shooting tomorrow roy and i'll remind the audience of that throughout we just don't have enough information on it right now the suspect is dead we know one dead 13 shot i've reached out to some people in the RCMP and then toronto pd and waiting to hear back see if we can get any additional info there there's not much do there's not much to analyze right now and and nancy not a mess last I saw last I saw let me see this last I saw the casualty count was not that high so let's see what's going on and again I don't like I'm not one of these people that analyzes mass shootings I'm not one of these people that in that analyzes mass shootings no Nancy with respect you're wrong and and luckily it's the other way it's it's one it's one dead and thirteen or fourteen injured not twelve dead that's the latest that could change that's why I don't want to talk about the shooting this morning a guy who responded in these shootings I know that they shake out very differently in the end I don't want to knee-jerk want to give you good analysis back to the FISA application though the FISA application we have here is the unverified dossier the unverified dossier was used as the basis for about 95% of the evidence contained therein but let's look at a bigger problem if Carter paged the subject of the FISA application if Carter page had done 1% 1% of what he was alleged to have done the guy you'd be rotting in a supermax prison right now instead he hasn't even been charged with jaywalking because he did nothing wrong and remember you could always super chat with us you got the s not in there the little dollar sign looks like my Superman mug he donate a couple of bucks you get the big banner the whole world the whole world and I say very good things about but the so if quarter painted-on 1% of what he's alleged to have done he'd be rotting in Supermax but like I said the guy hasn't been charged with jaywalking he's been railroaded if I recorded pages I'd sue the DOJ all quarter-page ever did was as an energy executive who dealt with Russia and Asia he spoke at a conference in Russia on energy and Russia in Asia I mean it's simple as that the steel dossier made these tremendous leaps these suppositions these allegations then Antonio Texas I love it great city San Antone thanks for being here and and Sally Yates and James Comey and rod Rosen Stein and a host of other players signed off on this warrant and that should send a chill down the spine of every American because paid political opposition research was used who get a FISA application and to to imply that a member and by the way Carter page was not an was not an integral member of the Trump campaign team he was an ancillary advisor and ancillary adviser through the Trump campaign on geopolitical issues energy things of that nature he's not a guy that was in the war room in Trump campaign headquarters every day directing anything is not somebody that had a lot of interaction with the candidate now President Trump at all but even look at this guy it was a stretch it was a leap they were looking for any connection and they found one guy who spoke at an energy conference in Russia and said oops there's our guy and they took this unverified salacious as James Comey put it dossier gave it to John McCain gave it to the FBI McCain gave it to the FBI they were all so giddy that they were gonna be able to take down Trump with this they tried and then the FBI and DOJ Comey and Sally Yates and others ran over to the FISA Court and said oh yeah there's our signatures he verified everything in here but they didn't they didn't but the problems are along even one of my favorite legal analyst Andy McCarthy over at National Review a guy who said I trust the FISA Court DOJ would never lie Andy McCarthy yesterday tweeted I said this wouldn't happen he admitted he was wrong he is enraged at what do jaded here because make no mistake make no mistake DOJ lied the FBI lied when James Comey and Sally Yates sign that FISA application when they certified that that information therein was vetted was verified they committed perjury another probably never face justice for it you and I would you and I'd be in jail for it but don't don't make no mistake again see there's nothing else they committed perjury as did Rosen Stein this is uh T Obama says so the paisa was based on false information and the signatories knew it it sure seems that way it seems like they lied never verified the dossier see remember they didn't have to know the information was false but they they they committed perjury when they signed off claiming the information was verified and vetted even if the information in the dossier was all true they still committed perjury they didn't know it was true they didn't know it was false because the FBI never sent anybody to Russia to verify the claims in the dossier claims asserted by other Russians there's your collusion with Russia and another King blue from England I love my UK audience you guys are awesome guys are absolutely awesome so ever gonna get native uh bat-fink Reynolds says the Middle East is insane we're gonna get Iran in just a moment really want to stick on the on the paisa dossier and so now what we had what we had was one guy by the way it was an allegation against one guy Carter paged a guy that the FBI knew didn't interface with Trump regularly an advisor now I've worked on campaigns I and a lot of time in the political sphere before media even now during I'll still consult with candidates on messaging and imaging and that kind of thing if you know how campaigns work and see most of the public doesn't I don't expect them to who people go about their everyday lives and they're you know engaged in they're in finance and law and medicine and manufacturing and they're swinging hammers and they're cops and they're firefighters and he shouldn't be expected to understand the intricacies of campaign work but in a campaign there are many many advisors rarely those advisors get near the candidate but typically what'll happen is they'll interface with a campaign manager or a deputy campaign manager or the campaign CEO or the campaign CEO oh because remember campaigns are suddenly nonprofit corporations right the entity that manages that campaign or there's a board and on that board might be somebody who's a major player in the energy space and so a guy like Carter page would interface with that person that person with the campaign CEO or campaign manager and then the campaign CEO our campaign manager with the candidate and if the information was really good they might tell that advisor who's now three steps down the ladder recorder Page was alright come in with a mediator for a meeting with the candidate next Thursday you've got five minutes to brief them and that's typically the extent of the interaction between a candidate like Trump a high-profile guy like Trump and a guy like quarter-page OOP dropped my pen it's more like a hey man great information thanks for that real busy on the campaign trail but really wanted to say great job have a good one anything I need to know yes sir you need to know one two and three all right great job again boom boom boom they turned to the campaign manager a smart guy let's make sure he's got a job in the administration if we win and that's the extent of it there isn't enough interaction for a guy like quarter-page to have brought Russians in the influence the outcome of the election they're just there's not enough hours in the day on the campaign trail for president there's simply not now we're talking to a couple people talking about fusion GPS so here's how that all work all right so Hillary Clinton and T contracted fusion GPS a company run by Glenn Simpson formerly the Wall Street Journal and others eugen GPS contracted Christopher steel so they contracted fusion GPS they do opposition research on the Trump campaign dumping campaigns do every day where it appears dubious on the part of the Hillary campaign is that instead of paying fusion GPS directly which would have necessitated disclosures to the Federal Election Commission which are all public record you're entitled to see every dime coming into and out of a campaign all right instead of paying fusion GPS in that legally transparent and compliant manner it appears that what Hillary did and it appears now conclusive what Hillary's campaign did was put the money into their law firm Perkins koey they paid them fees and Perkins Coey paid fusion GPS or pit Perkins koey contracted using GPS and billed back the Clinton campaign now problem with that is you're only gonna see payments to Perkins Coey the law firm you're not going to know that within those payments in opposition research firm using GPS was contracted because Perkins Coie is not obligated to disclose who they pay on behalf of the campaign unless they're subpoenaed in a civil lawsuit or it comes out like this it's it found out part and parcel to the major non scandal now I'm scared young Zeeland is saying who dead plus the shooter in Toronto now confirmed and that's exactly why I like to wait to analyze these these incidents because the information comes fast and furiously and I'd much rather give you accurate info than premature in Philly when it comes to victims okay so down this former mi6 who has a history of working with the FBI with fusion GPS it appears Christopher Steele goes over to Russia some old sources he knew back in his intelligence days he can't he gets all this here say oh you got these guys in the Trump campaign doing this but quarter-page again like I said he was a three tear down advisor who by the way was doing nothing wrong he attended a conference probably spoke to some Russians a lot he was in the energy business we have trade with Russia diplomatic relations with Russia it's legal for an American Energy executive the meetings with Russia or the page by the way it was a military officer at Annapolis Graduate Naval Academy graduate he's laughing at all this he is laughing at all this and rightfully so and so you've got all of this nonsense this unverified dossier it's then brought to a court a dossier not compiled by the FBI not by the DOJ or the DEA or the CIA or any other government agency but by a private firm a private firm paid for by the Clinton campaign hidden payments homey and mccabe and struck and Sally Yates and Loretta Lynch and rod Rosen Stein and a whole host of actors bring this to a FISA Court with their signatures all over it and they say we verified everything in here it sure looks to us like Carter Paige is a Russian agent they signed off saying this is all verified but it had never been the FBI and DOJ never independently sent prosecutors and agents to speak to every one of Christopher Steele's sources and then backtrack their stories and investigate their stories and that's what verification would have meant and so when Comey and Yates and the others signed off on this application saying that the information had been vetted and verified they committed perjury now the information turned out to be false but as I said a bit ago even if it had turned out to be true every word they still would have committed perjury because the information was not vetted and verified but they didn't care and you know why they didn't care they didn't care because they truly in their heart of hearts believe that Hillary Clinton would be the next president of the United States now I have the worst allergy though if I sneeze bearable not a rain down here in South Florida and something coming out in the trees is just killing my allergies sinuses we're getting a little bit of buffering but beams a lot better today now lot of you are making some comments so we're going to go to all the comments and you're asking if the FISA judges were in on it well here's the problem Oh Chaz no trust chasm by the way thank you $20 donation that was awesome thank you very very much much appreciated as asks no Chao says no trust and Intel or Justice Department's in assertion that russians hacked the dnc disappearance of service part a cover-up of leaked exposing corruption russia collusion investigation is designed as a distraction exactly in an excellent comment so let's go there somebody also asked do I think the FISA judges are complicit a chance that was a very very generous donation thank you very much for that we we really appreciate that um I'm not ready to say the face the judges were complicit or guilty not ready to say that here's why when you've got the director of the FBI Sally Yates at the time the acting Attorney General and others senior I mean major players in the FBI and DOJ in front of your bench saying this is true we vetted it we verified it you know you're the judge it's not your job to question them why would you they presented you four hundred and twelve pages of what they on their reputations under penalty of perjury certified was accurate that's overwhelming evidence for a warrant you weren't told that 95% of it was based on an unverified dossier you were told it was vetted and verified so I can't blame the judges just yet unless we find out the judges knew now the Chaz's outstanding comment no one has trust in the intelligence community or the Department of Justice right now Chaz in fact Bob Goodlatte House Judiciary Chairman now wants to subpoena he wants John Brennan to testify and if Brennan doesn't come in voluntarily he's going to subpoena him and he should and your comment about the servers it is insane but the only company that was ever allowed to examine the DNC servers was CrowdStrike that evidence is tainted no one can conclusively say those servers were hacked because long and I'm gonna wait a minute on the buffering what I was saying was because we were buffering a little bit uh was that and I see okay my buffering just held us back a bit but the chest your point that evidence is completely contaminated completely contaminated not only that route strike was rotten by a guy whose it was an FBI contemporary of McCabe and struck Comey and Muller during the uranium one deal yeah and from Eric Schmidt alphabet Google somebody who considered them somebody who Hillary's campaign considered Daffy it's really really bad now king blue says the FISA judge is as bent as Aras who jailed Tommy now I disagree the one of job Tommy was impetuous and and acted inappropriately and I think it was political persecution these fights the judges were given four hundred and twelve pages by the FBI and DOJ a very bad information and I believe lied to and we're gonna find out more about that but I think the real problem was a DOJ and FBI let me go back through some of your comments free pulpit magic says Bree fell on the forest of Kew Gardens 10:30 day before almost killed somebody I don't understand the question hmm interesting okay I don't know how you would protect yourself from a falling tree odd it's not within my wheelhouse of expertise all right so so I don't think it was the judges back at the 525 Zach a Sanchez I agree with you CrowdStrike holding those servers they well the evidence so contaminated no one could say they were hacked or it was just a phishing scam the entire case was botched but I do agree with you I do agree with you that Russia collusion and the Muller investigation were nothing more than a distraction because they really thought Hillary was gonna win and when she didn't win and they knew Trump was gonna get control of DOJ and FBI in the intelligence community they had to do something they had to do this rush of collusion nonsense the hope he would be so distracted and so discredited that when he exposed them he wouldn't have he wouldn't have any time or credibility now I wanted a little bit about Donald Trump's tweet toward Iran because it's important he said if you didn't see it pretty incredible stuff he said that he wanted to essentially hello Iran up he said where is it who Iranian president rouhani and this is all in capitals never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which you throughout history I've ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death be cautious God it Robert Jackson good morning my friend it is so refreshing have a president who's not afraid who tells the world's bad guys tells the world's bad guys what they need to hear which is slow your roll and he puts the United States first it was a great tweet it was a great statement and I wanted to touch on that Trump is also railing Trump is also railing against the Russia collusion investigation he's quoting tom Fitton from Judicial Watch quite a bit tom is doing an excellent job president wrote quote President Trump on Twitter quote it was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI in the Justice Department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a war on target Trump team this is a Clinton campaign document he means the dossier it was a fraud and a hoax designed a target Trump so are we now at the second tweet so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked Hillary Clinton the DNC that was knowing and falsely submitted to paisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Muller witch-hunt and the president's right Muller is now discredited if Muller were this man of integrity seems to be I'm a man of integrity Muller would shut himself down Muller would say very uncomfortable I found no evidence of Russia collusion and most I've got are false statements I've got man afforded old financial crimes I've got nothing I've got nothing a bit ridiculous I got a lot of comments from you guys on that uh let's I want to know what you guys think of Trump's tweet on Iran though I'm gonna read it again why rainy and President rouhani and this is the rest is all in caps never ever threaten the United States again are you a so you will suffer consequences the likes of which you throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words a violence and death be cautious exclamation point man I love it I love it well and exit said strokes wife is he's not the head of the SEC using her maiden name she's a deputy director she was promoted back in 2014 a lot of bad information that she was promoted to run the SEC right around the time it's not that's not the case he's one of the few deputy directors over there appointed during the Obama administration but not in 2016 fake news sucks as a here Podesta has been given immunity Tony Podesta it's reporters being offered limited use immunity its immunity unique to his testimony still looks really bad now I'm gonna go back through your comments now but let's say oh wow amsterdam netherlands i want to go back and take some of your comments we took some really really good ones let's see what else we got here to comments on Trump Russia not many on Iran surprise you guys Jack wall Jets what's my opinion on the crown prince of Saudi Arabia I don't trust that a Arabia Saudi Arabia is one of the most aggressive state sponsors of terror they don't have that much oil anymore either so I'm not really I'm not really uh you're concerned about Saudi Arabia and I don't like that we still swoon over them fake new sucks as struck basically said judges in his pocket well not really he and judge Contreras are good friends Contreras eventually recused rightfully so rightfully because of his prior relationship with Peter Straub and I I think Contreras needs to be looked at he was the original judge in general Flynn case for QT was also would be happy to hear that let's see let's see what else we've got we've got a lot a lot of comments a native engines everyone loved President Trump in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s until he started to want to run for president look if Donald Trump had run for president as an establishment guy that loved him even more whom they did wanted his money when he ran as an anti-establishment guy they hated him because he put the fear of God into them ah about Seth rich what do you think about him being a leak disguised as a Russian hack okay here's what I think I think set three rich leaked to WikiLeaks I do believe that set wrench was killed because of that I don't believe it was super-secret government agents is that there's a lot of questions about the robbery my gut is a guy who investigated robberies and homicide I think it might have been another staffer or somebody that found out he leaked they went to scare him things got a little out of hand and he got shot professional assassins don't leave you laying on a busy street they just don't and a lot of people are embarrassing themselves with Erie's about the set bridge and to me it looks like either I don't know if it's a robbery gone bad I do believe he was the weak I do believe his death had something to do with that but um as you guys know not as conspiratorial as everybody let's see dunt Duncan says for over a year and a half the Democrats knew about this and lied to our faces ship every day lied to our faces worse with the haze of Adams chef a Democratic congressman from California he leaked it appears he leaked even trey gowdy called him out he said hey I'll paraphrase trey Gowdy Gregg Audi is right mjm said is this ty I think you mean the Iran tweet it's the best tweet Trump as put out there yo Kotchman says tom Fitton is awesome don't you do this what time is awesome love my president love my president let's see what else we got well well the yeah beer mama says they killed him to get the drum I'm drive off of him it was always on him that's another conspiracy theory that is unproven on proving let's work with theories that that have basis an investigative empirical fact in anecdotal fact in a store now a couple of problems but it's been pretty good for most of the show and it doesn't appear we're getting it's not too horrible not too horrible looks like what we're having now is spikes where the signal is in and out all right Ally Klein asks the best question though I've been charges will be brought against some people at the FBI and DOJ you know it's let me answer it like this many charges should have already been brought I think it's becoming more difficult every day or charges not be brought there's just too much wrong doing way too much wrong doing hyuk-joo dolly says it's Trump the ideal Christian I don't care we have separation of church and state in America I want a good president I want a good MD says morning John they're late what a weekend yep busy weekend but back to the question is Trump a good critic ideal Christian probably not and I don't care he's a great president he's a great president let's see and again I'm not avoiding talking about the Danforth shooting in Toronto I'm just I want I want to discuss tomorrow when we have more details when I'm clearer more detailed fact pattern emerges in the case and we can analyze who why what and everything so why do you think the DNC all of a sudden needed to get new equipment for all their servers would happen to the originals Joe Amos well well I don't really know I don't know let's see what else we've got here we're the Trump is the best policy for religious freedom which benefits Christians well right right so that's what I'm saying John he doesn't need to be the ideal Christian he needs to be a great president and in terms of religious liberties and property rights and gun rights and First Amendment issues and putting America first and keeping the bad guys at bay he's been a great president so if he protects religious liberty then I really don't care if he's a very Christian I'm not I'm not I didn't elect Trump to be my priest I elected Trump to be president the United States and that's an important distinction hold on comments are coming in Fast and Furious Lee huh you guys drove the Nazis out of Europe a while ago when are you guys gonna come over and kick some Muslim but asking for a friend well you know Europe is gonna have to do for Europe they're gonna have to do for Europe fuck Miguel says I wonder how long it will take to release the Muslim shooters name yeah I saw a very clear video and the guy does appear to be darker skinned with a beard in the Danforth shooting he certainly does hangman John Ruth says Trump is the best president since Teddy Roosevelt I love Teddy Roosevelt I did River in New York on Long Island New York and then North Shore you check out Sagamore Hill which was Teddy Roosevelt's home it's owned by the National Park Service now it's open for tours really cool really cool glimpse into his life I used to go all the time and I used to live in New York and I River there told me about a 40 minute ride outside of New York City if you're ever there I highly recommend it called Sagamore Hill you can do tours through it cool property really cool place to just spend the day even a couple of hours eisah Warren had already been denied once yeah they were looking at they were looking at uh they were looking at home at afford four years to Department of Justice and they you know walk that back so I don't you know I'm not I don't have any faith anymore and it pains me to say there's a law-and-order guy but I no longer have faith in the Department of Justice or the FBI I just don't I think they failed us I think they have failed us and I think they've really they have a crisis of confidence the leap of which I've never seen where was that really good comment hangman John Ruth read Bible at home keep Constitution at the Oval Office exactly it couldn't say it better myself nothing to add to that Don where's Chuck says Trump where's Chuck Trump is exposing the real truth making him more popular that's exactly right that's what's happening you know I always say Trump sounds like one of those guys one of those politicians you see in a movie you see it a movie and he says all the things you wish your politician would say and I really cheers and loves him and he crosses party lines right did you get him in the real world you get Donald Trump and everybody hates him and tries to take him down now if Donald Trump were saying all these things and they sounded well liberal or a hit a D behind his name oh the media would love him the media would love him look furrier asked a great question if Iran continues its position how do you think Trump will respond well I think what Trump will do is he will attack Iranian military asset probably hit Iranian naval ship it ran is really complex the simple reason that the Iranian people especially those who are like 60 down a millennial they are pro-west they remember days under the Shah for the Iranian people would love nothing more than to be free they would love nothing more than to be like the United States prosperous and wealthy and buying luxury goods the Iranian people are not the enemy they're by and large secular they don't want to live under this this radical Korea like rule and so we've got to be careful with Iran I'm gonna hit military targets prety giclees it their codes force like guys like Soleimani who run their codes for us real bad guy real brutal guy we've got if we could whack a soleimani and take out the mullahs we're doing okay that's what should happen that's what should happen my ology isn't getting me guys I'm sorry there you go it's just been brutal even more brutal when you got to turn out a live show every day terrible terrible terrible oh good question MD good question and a deviate here a little bit where is that says me about Marco Rubio and Tim Scott knocking out a judge knocking out a judge judge bounds a conservative that trump appointed for a spot on the uber liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals now judge bounds is a conservative they went back to something he wrote in college it went back something he wrote in college where he basically said that campus groups didn't have race-based events that it should end wrong with that Rubio and Tim Scott knocked him out now MD is saying that it had something to do with moneybags I don't know if you mean Soros but I don't know if that's the case and I dropped water on myself too I don't know if that's the case but I do know that Marko has angered a lot of conservatives down here in Florida by doing that nobody understands that even his supporters don't understand why he keeps doing that John Duncan says Trump hates ground troops I'm assuming we'll just sink their Navy yeah John you know I'm thinking we might hit them they're Navy as well because they're patrol boats they're naval assets or would have harassed our people and our ships that's what I'm thinking is that that'll be the first action he shows them that will take their naval boats out first or maybe we crippled the boats and we take their naval people hostage and like they did ours or you know prisoner war bring him back to the US embarrass Iran on the world page forced them who forced them to a beg for their people Matt let's see wow I've got a lot of comments here let's say great mug John mica says yeah I love these mug I've got this one got two big ones I've got this one they've got a Captain America let me see some guys have a lot of comments all right let's go one of the American people gonna start going after all these traitors well we've got and that was from Sean well we are trying we are trying Chuck McGill and the Danforth shooting is saying a young child has been killed it's why I want a report but it's not official I don't like uncle I hope America doesn't get tricked into another Middle East war Yaya says now we're not gonna get tricked into another Millie we're not well that's not going to happen I think we're going to be I think Trump is very measured in what he does Kevin klauer says there is no separation of church and state as most understand that is as the president he should be a moral leader and I think he's doing well for Trump look I don't I want my president to be able to order special operations people in to kill the bad guys morality is not my first concern and I love being with you guys see I fight through the allergies let's see what do I think of Israel helping the white helmets uh quagmire isn't it a whole white helmet setting look I'm not a fan of the UN I am NOT a fan of the UN let's see no faith until what or who changes in BOJ our FBI from Gail Cochran yeah Gail you're right I mean I think it needs a thorough housecleaning Trump needs to get rid of even his own appointees now they served him very very poorly at East Texas treasures has Trump needs to fire sessions agreed if he could find them I think sessions went into WITSEC into the witness protection program nobody knows where he is nobody knows where he is or John Duncan watching Fox News on a different more monitor now that all flights are on throughout all attitudes are different all the never Trump errs seem to a flip it's all toothy grins right now now not all of them because if you watch MSNBC or CNN they're saying well this disproves the Nunez memo they did tell the court that Steele was paid opposition research they really didn't it was very peppered statement but believe me the left is still trying to spin this the left is still trying to spin this Alex Freedom says what did the FISA warrants showed in the warrants themselves Alex it was the foreign applications and the warrant application show that the that the apathy applies and warrants were predicated mostly upon the debunked dossier we covered it quite a bit dr. McGill says oh I thought there's rebel media Canadian news well yeah rebels Canadian entity but that my show tends to focus more on there or one of their American correspondents I tend to focus more on the u.s. issues I am gonna do the Toronto shooting we just don't have enough info on it right now we just don't have enough info on it right and I don't like speculation in this let's see now I can't read the name but it says Israel stands the forefront of the entire world in the face of terrorism Trump surprised all the skeptics in Israel he did what he promised he's not afraid to stand up the Iranian yeah I agree I agree I will say I disagree that Israel stands at the forefront of the entire world in the face of terrorism I think the US are they really are the ones whose groups are standing at the forefront of the war on terror we've lost more troops and 9/11 so I think Israel is been a great partner but I have to say I'm gonna have to go with my team on that one my friend and but Israel is surrounded by terror States so if you that's the context then I agree then I agree let's see BBC calls Muslim terrorists Asian rights of Eurasian you know Boris's guys like you want to make a move to America you guys Rock not help not perfect but would you say how bloody wait hold on a second I lost you but how bloody is nowadays my salute well I salute you as well Boris all right Wolverine good morning to you patty-cakes says trey gowdy flips back and forth john duncan yeah they never Trump is on Fox will make morons oh they look like morons look never Trump movement on the whole is thoroughly debunked movement they they really really embarrass them really embarrass themselves I think now that's just my two cents I think they have successfully made fools of themselves check my phone make sure my producers aren't trying to reach out to me and I nope all good want to make sure they're not seeing any problems on their in with the stream that I'm not alright let's say ya left is saying that the fly so applications proves if for brains was right and Nunez should go to jail it's just nuts that's remember yeah that's exactly what they're doing MD they're saying that well they told the court of its the spin it's hysterical but look histrionics typically happened when you are house of cards starts collapsing you've got nothing left they really have nothing left nothing at all Americans must not abandon their veterans soldiers much of them must have a future to hope for exactly look we treat our veterans very very poorly the VA was a mess hopefully new VA secretary appointment and interestingly enough when you talk to veteran specially disabled veterans and I've had this conversation with representative Brian mast down here with a buddy of mine who was a real team sex guy he was not disabled but he still goes to the VA they'll tell you the doctors and nurses in the VA are great they treat them really well they love the doctors and nurses it's the civilian support staff those entrenched bureaucrat uh Jack said hero says if I seen the end rumah Court the analysis of the new FISA documents yes I love Andy's work I absolutely love Andy's work and the most telling part to me is Andy basically said he was wrong he said that all this couldn't happen and it happened Andy McCarthy her they is one of the most honest actors out there I think he's a an incredibly brilliant guy yeah and the interesting thing we're getting buffering issues and again it's really good on this end and they all happened very late in the show Andrew McCarthy is one of the most honest guys out there he's he's a brilliant brilliant guy and Andy McCarthy is just blown away by all this I actually spoke to a couple of other former one of my very close friends uh was a federal prosecutor for many years and then we worked together in the private sector and he had applied for many FISA applications because of the types of crimes he was prosecuting and the investigations he worked on and he told me he has never never seen anything that's bad literally his words this was last night at about 10:00 p.m. Eastern that he had never seen anything this bad Johnse Lang says the only people listening to the fake news spin of the idiots in the Beltway bubble the masses have woke up banks to the rebel well thanks yeah look I always say it right John you've got your DC New York LA to an extent Miami Chicago bubble right those are other media markets yeah and Calvin flower says John Cardillo for president 2024 thanks for a great broadcast Calvin I appreciate the vote of confidence but I would never want that job I love doing what I do I love doing I'm gonna stay right here I like this chair better I like being on air with you guys cuz we can talk about it anything the president oh poor guy look what Trump puts out a tweet whole world wants him impeach on the left want some impeach let's see a three-year-old victim of an acid attack in the UK have not seen that story I need a couple of comments on I'm gonna check into it after the show Edouard cheese burro chess burro says that these people meaning the left is the never Trump pers is a good comment wanted Trump to call out the Russian President on the world stage for admit a stupid move by the United States absolutely right absolutely right you don't insult the guy in front of the world and escalate tensions you do what she would Trump did and then if you got to get tough you got to get tough because with being underreported as Trump said after and MD said when McCarthy made the comments and you could see the anger you could see just how upset he was about what dlj has done and guys I really don't know why we're getting these uh these problems he's buffering issues right now because we have and you see they're very quick and very quick it's our stream is is really strong today uh ok Chaz that's another great question injustice to punch ass thanks again for that donation and the Justice Department investigate itself and write indictments again fellows the never Trump feelings are pervasive in DC ninety point four percent Hillary versus four point one Trump in DC alright so a couple of great points in there hen they yes will they know that's why I tell you guys every day I despise the concept of a second Special Counsel I don't like special counsels but at this point I think we need a second special counsel to investigate DOJ and the first special counsel lyonel be Grand Prix is saying we should have a photo a name of the Toronto terrorist I agree I agree said hero's asking me do you think that the FISA judges are compromised I'm not ready to go there yet because they had 412 pages from the FBI and DOJ and signatures from the director of the FBI in the acting Attorney General Sally Yates and a lot of testimony though I think the FBI and DOJ were compromised but the judges had what they felt was overwhelming evidence in front of them and until we see more that says the judges were a compromise I haven't seen that look I'm angry but I don't want to make accusations against people is when I can I put myself in the judges shoes and if I were on that bench somebody presented me four hundred and twelve pages of a FISA application being your FBI people walked in front of me swore you know on the Bible or that the information they were giving me was factual and I had signatures from the director of the FBI in the acting Attorney General United States saying this had been vetted and verified when those senior FBI people came in I said has this been better than verified they said yes I'm gonna sign that warrant I'm gonna sign that warrant but all those people committed perjury well I can't blame the judges I mean the judges had overwhelming evidence that the information was good is there mean appears I'd - by the FBI and DOJ haribol pattycake says what do I think about trey gowdy he flips I think he's all bark and no bite he's great for sound bites he'll never do anything he'll never do anything he doesn't want an actual result he just wants to grandstand he would also figure and let's see let's see let's see let's see uh hat legs that she had a radio show hmm I'd love to do in radio and liberal media is scared to be called racing true true true well they're scared to be called races they're also component all Fitzpatrick's has watched the one shooting video I saw the very clear video the guy does look me like he's dark-skinned with a beard indicating a Muslim indicating terrorism fact but no informations I'm out seems to support that theory but like I said let's report it once we know uh Artie just published the White House open a TV channel and Iran encouraging the Iranian people good Iranian people are Pro West they're our allies we need to be doing that with the people of Iran lyonell be grand priest I don't care what color he is or where he's from terrorist Tara agree Lionel I agree I agree that is a great great comment let's see Lisa Paige is an FBI lawyer not an agent I never said Lisa Paige was an FBI also no longer an FBI lawyer she quit she resigned I've never reported that Lisa Paige was I was an agent for the FBI boys reported we're high dead hero says when Gowdy is on he's very good when he's not he is met well when he's on but what is on me down bikes to the cameras is one thing when he the chairman of a committee he needs to push the speaker to start generating letters requesting criminal prosecution and let's see what else don't want to know what the Democrats read out emails concerning jason Chaffetz another Republican well they're never going to look into the dimmer they are never gonna look into the Democrats because it's not what they do it's not what they do Glenn HEC senses how to help at least pay to become an FBI agent she was never an agent there's simply a lawyer for the FBI very high-ranking lawyer he didn't go through Quantico he didn't carry a badge carry a gun she wasn't sworn she wasn't law enforcement he was an attorney for the bureau let's see lot of calls for the police to release the name of the Toronto shooter I agree ah I see so you guys were responding to a comment that she was a lawyer with an agent not a lawyer not you weren't pointing that to me let's see yellow asks where the Democrats got those emails on shamans and others great question or a heat question isn't it yeah great question you know it's gonna be very interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days gonna be Morgana dundee says she used

got um our stream got disconnected and reconnected don't know why Oh M DS asking if we heard any more on a Scott Israel front sheriff in Broward County also that I see real clear investigations on run C in the Broward School Board re federal program to stop arrests in school yeah I've reported on that extensively waiting still waiting for this FDLE report but what I'm hearing down here is that Israel will be removed again others have reported that as fact and gave timelines I have not I have not because I talked to people in the know and they're not giving me timelines so take other timelines with a grant called run C has a lot of problems a lot of problems and I think there's a big movement now hunter I'm sorry Andrew Pollock the dad of meadow Pollack who's building the school is working overtime to remove run C from office but Democrats down here seem to like run C because he's an Obama guy and it's it's really tragic I'm gonna bring more on that as information surface is
