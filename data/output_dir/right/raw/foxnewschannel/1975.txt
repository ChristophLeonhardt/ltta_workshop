1
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:14,318
>> Laura: PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE

2
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,052
THE HISTORIC DECISION TODAY TO

3
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:15,719
WITHDRAW THE U.S. FROM THE

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,787
NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.

5
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,922
HE ALSO SIGNED A MEMO SLAPPING

6
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,358
TOUGH SANCTIONS ON THE IRANIAN

7
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:22,259
REGIME.

8
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:22,993
U.S. ALLIES HAVE COMPLAINED THAT

9
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:26,396
LEAVING THE DEAL COULD BE

10
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:27,531
DANGEROUS, BUT THE PRESIDENT

11
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:28,298
SAID IT'S MORE DANGEROUS TO KEEP

12
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:32,803
THE DEAL IN PLACE.

13
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:33,537
>> THE IRAN DEAL IS DEFECTIVE AT

14
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:34,237
ITS CORE.

15
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:38,609
IF WE DO NOTHING WE KNOW EXACTLY

16
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,345
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

17
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,346
IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,

18
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,716
THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE

19
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,118
SPONSOR OF TERROR WILL BE ON THE

20
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,287
CUSP OF ACQUIRING THE WORLD'S

21
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,822
MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONS.

22
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,358
AT THE HEART OF THE IRAN DEAL

23
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:57,794
WAS A GIANT FICTION, THAT A

24
00:00:57,794 --> 00:01:00,130
MURDEROUS REGIME DESIRED ONLY A

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,867
PEACEFUL NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM.

26
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:07,270
TODAY WE HAVE DEFINITIVE PROOF

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,339
THAT THIS IRANIAN PROMISE WAS A

28
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:09,673
LIE.

29
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:12,242
>> Laura: ON TOP OF THAT, MORE

30
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:12,776
HUGE NEWS.

31
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:14,778
THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE

32
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:15,912
TIME, DATE AND LOCATION HAVE

33
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:18,215
BEEN SET FOR A SETTLEMENT WITH

34
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:19,850
NORTH KOREAN NORTH KOREAN LEADER

35
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,584
KIM JONG UN.

36
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:21,785
AND SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE

37
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,186
POMPEO IS NOW IN NORTH KOREA FOR

38
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:25,255
A SECOND TIME TO PAVE THE WAY

39
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:26,857
FOR THE TALKS.

40
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:29,593
MOMENTS AGO I SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY

41
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:30,560
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,728
SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON

43
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,797
ABOUT TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT.

44
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:36,199
>> THIS IS A BIG DAY TODAY.

45
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,801
PEOPLE ARE FREAKING OUT, THE

46
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,236
USUAL SUSPECTS ARE FREAKING OUT.

47
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:41,371
A COUPLE OF OTHER NOT SO USUAL

48
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:41,972
SUSPECTS.

49
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:42,839
THIS IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS SET

50
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:47,177
ABOUT THIS DEAL BACK IN 2015

51
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:47,944
WHEN OBAMA HAD NEGOTIATED IT.

52
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:50,080
LET'S WATCH.

53
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,149
>> THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF OUR

54
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:53,517
NEGOTIATION WAS TO ENSURE THAT

55
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:56,586
THERE WOULD BE NO PATHWAY FOR

56
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:58,555
IRAN TO ACHIEVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

57
00:01:58,555 --> 00:01:58,989
CAPABILITIES.

58
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,957
THIS DEAL DOESN'T ACHIEVE THAT.

59
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,093
>> THIS AGREEMENT IS TOO FLAWED

60
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:06,963
AND TOO DANGEROUS FOR US.

61
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:07,497
>> I READ THE JOINT

62
00:02:07,497 --> 00:02:08,231
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION

63
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:10,167
LAST NIGHT, OVER 100 PAGES.

64
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,768
I WILL BE HONEST, I WAS

65
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:12,836
SKEPTICAL GOING IN.

66
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:13,970
THERE'S NOTHING I READ LAST

67
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,806
NIGHT THAT ALLEVIATES MY

68
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,406
SKEPTICISM.

69
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:17,607
>> THE FACT IS THE DEAL HAS BEEN

70
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,975
FLAWED FROM THE BEGINNING.

71
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:19,976
I THINK THE PRESIDENT LAID THAT

72
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,979
CASE OUT IN HIS STATEMENT TODAY.

73
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,214
HE GAVE THE EUROPEANS AND OTHERS

74
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:26,583
A CHANCE TO FIX IT.

75
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,751
IT WAS NOT DOABLE BECAUSE THE

76
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,351
FLAWS GO RIGHT TO THE

77
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,787
FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEAL.

78
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:31,922
HE DID WHAT HE CLEARLY

79
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,824
ADVERTISED HE WAS GOING TO DO AS

80
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:36,359
FAR BACK AS THE 2016 CAMPAIGN,

81
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:37,861
PULLED THE UNITED STATES OUT OF

82
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,228
THE DEAL.

83
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:39,396
WHY?

84
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:40,864
BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR SECURITY

85
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:42,399
INTEREST TO GET OUT OF THIS

86
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:42,866
FLAWED DEAL.

87
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:43,800
>> Laura: JOHN KERRY TODAY

88
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,534
EXPLAINED WHY HE WAS DOING HIS

89
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:48,305
OWN LITTLE VERSION OF TALKING TO

90
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,806
IRAN.

91
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:52,175
>> UNTIL TODAY, UNTIL THIS

92
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:53,243
AFTERNOON THE POLICY OF THE

93
00:02:53,243 --> 00:00:00,000
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS TO
