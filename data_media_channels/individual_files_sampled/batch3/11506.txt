while many countries have expelled Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK and not everyone agrees with the move among them MPs and neighboring Ireland which is also kicking out diplomats you're asking us to trust Boris Johnson and dare I say this might not be the wisest course of action we spoke to our people in the Irish capital about what they thought about the diplomatic expulsion relating to the script our case I think it's a needless threat to our sovereignty by a man who is thinking only of his legacy I just serve look for the proof and I haven't heard any they definitely should have waited until it was proven I mean it there's some messed up things going on and obviously have to take things with caution you know and we're really neutral country like what why would we do that I think it's disgraced because we're supposed to be a neutral country and it's gone beyond it's just it's totally unreasonable what they're doing no reason to support the British security services or to take their word for what happened in Salisbury or for anything else and personally speaking when I think of his ashamed that any Averys government would act as a puppet sort of our Britain and a puppet of the British security services but this tells us something about the drift of European politics and the drift of Irish politics along with their European partners at the moment I think it's a dangerous moment for Ireland is making a step into an area which Ireland as a neutral country always in get through country on tonight so it's making a step away from neutrality and that has got ominous implications for the future foreign policy and indeed domestic policy of the Republic of Ireland
