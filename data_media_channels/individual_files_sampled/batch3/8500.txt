DAYS BEFORE THE SUMMIT. IN BOTH COUNTRIES THEY DELEGATIONS MEETING IN SINGAPORE AND IN THE DELIMITER IS ZONED THIS WEEK IN HOPES OF DOING JUST THAT. THANK YOU. FOR THIS WERE JOINED BY A FORMER CIA STATION CHIEF WHO SERVED AS CHIEF FOR THE STATION IN MOSCOW. ALSO A CONTRIBUTOR. THANK YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU. A BIG SURPRISE THIS WEEK WHEN THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER, THE RIGHT-HAND MAN OF PUTIN OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MADE A SURPRISE VISIT TO PYONGYANG. REALLY THEY WERE MONUMENTAL SITES AND MEETINGS. WHAT TO MAKE OF HYMN SUDDENLY GOING OFF TO KIM JONG-UN OWN? WE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTIONS. NOW WE ARE SEEING THE RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN OUR EFFORTS TO BRING PEACE TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA.HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE SINCE AT LEAST A DECADE. HE APPARENTLY DID NOT HAVE ANY PRIVATE MEETINGS. THIS IS FOR THE PUBLIC TO CONSUME AND IT WAS DEFINITELY A MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA LEADERSHIP. HE HAD PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH KIM JONG-UN AS WELL AS A MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES. THE FOCUS WAS ON SANCTIONS AND HE TALKED ABOUT RATIONING DOWN SANCTIONS BEFORE NORTH KOREA TAKES THE ACTION THAT WE DEEM NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARSENAL. WHAT IS IN RUSSIA'S INTEREST. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID? VERSUS RICK REMEMBER THAT NORTH KOREA IS AN OLD SOVIET SATELLITE STATE. IN FACT THE FIRSTLY OF NORTH KOREA, WAS A MAJOR IN THE SOVIET ARMY AND FOUGHT AGAINST THE JAPANESE DURING WORLD WAR II. THE SOVIETS INSTALLED HIM AS THE LEADER OF THE FIRST LEADER OF NORTH KOREA. IT IS NOT TAUGHT IN NORTH KOREAN HISTORY BOOKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. BUT IT IS A TRUE FACT. THE RUSSIANS ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE DIPLOMACY IN THE REGION. FIRST AND FOREMOST, THEY WANT TO COUNTER UNITED STATES STRATEGICALLY. THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNITED STATES INFLUENCE IN THE REGION BOTH MILITARILY AND POLITICALLY. THEY LIKE TO REDUCE OUR MILITARY PRESENCE. AND OUR INFLUENCE. SO I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY SUPPORT KIM JONG-UN OWN BUT IS JUST A LEGACY FROM THE SOVIET DAYS. THEY ALSO SUPPORT KIM JONG-UN BECAUSE THEY FRANKLY, THEY DON'T LIKE SANCTIONS TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED. AND THEY WERE INTERFERING IN ELECTIONS AND IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES POSSESSES THE POLITICAL AND POTENTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM RESISTING THE SANCTIONS. THEY BELIEVE IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG-UN OWN AND NORTH KOREA DOESN'T PAN OUT, THEY WANT TO BE THERE AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INCREASED TRADE. THEY'RE ALREADY VIOLATING SANCTIONS WITH THE EXPORT OF OIL IN LOAN NORTH KOREAN WORKERS TO RESIDE AND WORK IN RUSSIA. BUT THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO A LOT MORE ECONOMICALLY WITH NORTH KOREA. THEY WANT A PIECE OF THE PIE. AND THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN CROSSING SANCTIONS WITH OIL TANKERS, TRANSPORTING OIL WHICH IS AGAINST PYONGYANG. AND EVADING SANCTIONS THAT THEY BASICALLY VOTED FOR IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL. THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK IT IS A BALANCING ACT FOR THEM. AND OF THE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK FRANKLY, PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWS STRENGTH. THEY WERE NERVOUS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR HOSTILITY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES AND NORTH KOREA. SO THEY DID TAKE SOME ACTION WITH SANCTIONS BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BUSTING THEM A LITTLE BIT. OF COURSE THEY HAVE THE SITE OF SOME EXPORTS OF RUSSIAN GOODS TO NORTH KOREA. AND THIS IS 60 MILES FROM THE NORTH KOREAN BORDER THAT IS THE STRATEGIC PORT OF RUSSIA. AND LAVROV POPPED UP.THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY. I DID NOT LIKE THE RUSSIAN MEETING YESTERDAY. I SAY WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THAT? BUT IT COULD BE A POSITIVE MEETING. IF IT IS A POSITIVE MEETING I LOVE IT. IF IT'S A NEGATIVE MEETING I'M NOT HAPPY. AND IT COULD VERY WELL BE POSITIVE. THEY ARE DISCUSSING A POSSIBLE SUMMIT BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND PUTIN PAY WHAT YOU THINK THEY SHOULD DO? I THINK THE PRESENT WOULD KEEP IN MIND, THE FAILURES OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. THE OBAMA MINISTRATION BELIEVED RUSSIA WAS ON OUR SIDE. IN SYRIA. AND WHEN THE RUSSIANS SAID, WAS SECRETARY LAVROV TOLD SECRETARY KERRY THERE WAS NO MILITARY SOLUTION IN SYRIA, LAVROV WAS LYING ABOUT THAT. WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA DOES NOT HAVE OUR BEST INTEREST AT HEART. ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. I THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT AND I THINK SECRETARY POMPEO WILL BE GREAT AS WELL THE NEW DIRECTOR OF CIA, GINA HASPEL WHICH IS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON RUSSIA. THE KEY RAN OVER THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FURNISHING THE PRESIDENT WITH THE INTELLIGENCE HE NEEDS TO HE WILL BE IN THE KNOW ABOUT WHAT RUSSIA AND VLADIMIR PUTIN 'S REAL INTENTIONS ARE. THE BEST LEVERAGE WE HAVE AGAINST NORTH KOREA IS BY PUSHING THIS BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP THAT WE ENJOY RIGHT NOW WITH THE NORTH KOREANS. I THINK THE PRESIDENTS MEETING YESTERDAY WITH KIM YONG-CHOL, THAT WAS EXTRA NEARLY IMPORTANT. THOSE ARE THE RELATIONSHIPS I THINK THAT NEGOTIATIONS REALLY DEPEND UPON. WE SAW SECRETARY POMPEO WHO VISITED NORTH KOREA TWICE. MET WITH KIM YONG-CHOL TWO TIMES THERE. ESSENTIALLY DELIVER A WARM TURNOVER TO THE PRESIDENT. I THINK THAT IS HOW WE HANDLE RUSSIA, BY FOCUSING ON THE BILATERAL ENGAGEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA. TRY THE SIX PARTY TALKS AND TWO OF THOSE PARTIES, RUSSIA AND CHINA ARE NOT REALLY UP TO HELP US TOO MUCH. FINALLY I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT UPSTAGED PUTIN. MAYBE THAT IS WHY LAVROV MADE THE TRIP? THAT PUTIN SEES HIMSELF ON THE OUTS WERE NOT PART OF THIS ONGOING PROCESS WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THE JUNE 12 SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN. I THINK THAT IS INSIGHTFUL. I WOULD AGREE 100 PERCENT. I THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS AT THE UNITED STATES SEIZED THE INITIATIVE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SEIZED THE INITIATIVE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. IT DOES CAUSE VLADIMIR PUTIN SOME CONCERN. THE ON THE OUTSIDE PRODUCE A VERY PUBLIC STATEMENT. I THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
