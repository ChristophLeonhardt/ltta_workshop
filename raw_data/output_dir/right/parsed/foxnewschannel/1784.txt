ALREADY TALKING.
AINSLEY: SORRY.
I'M A GIRL.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE WERE CHATTING ALL THREE
OF US.
ALL RIGHT.
A NEW CAMPAIGN AD IS URGING
MOTHERS TO TALK TO THE THEIR
CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> HE WAS NEVER AFRAID TO
TALK WITH GIRLS.
BUT THINGS NEVER REALLY
WORKED OUT FOR SOME REASON.
I WORRIED WHEN HE WENT TO
COLLEGE, BUT HE CAME HOME
OFTEN.
I GUESS HE NEVER REALLY
LEARNED TO DO HIS OWN
LAUNDRY.
IT WASN'T UNTIL I MET HIS
COLLEGE BUDDIES THAT I
REALIZED THAT IT MIGHT BE
TOO LATE.
THIS MOTHER'S DAY, TALK TO
YOUR CHILD BUT THE G.O.P.
AINSLEY: DOES THAT AD GO TOO
FAR OR DO YOU THINK IT'S ALL
IN GOOD FUN?
HERE TO DEBATE THIS IS
AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST AND
HOST OF TRUTH EXCHANGE CATHY
BARNETT.
LADIES, THANKS FOR BEING
WITH US.
YOU WERE LAUGHING.
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
WHY?
>> IT'S PARODY.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.
TOM STIERS IS A BILLIONAIRE.
IS HE SUPPORTING THIS
EFFORT.
HE COULD HAVE HIRED A BETTER
COMEDY WRITER.
AINSLEY: CATHY?
>> THIS IS ABOUT AS FUNNY AS
KATHY GRIFFIN HOLDING UP A
BLOODIED HEAD OF THE
PRESIDENT.
SHE CALLED THAT IS A
SHE CALLED THAT SS A
SHE CALLED THAT SATA
SHE CALLED THAT SATIRE.
I'M BLACK.
I'M A CONSERVATIVE.
I VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
IN 2016.
I INTEND TO VOTE FOR HIM
AGAIN IN 2020.
DOES THAT MAKE ME A TORCH
CARRYING CARD MEMBER OF THE
KKK?
IT DOESN'T.
BUT, LIBERALS TEND NOT TO
GET IT.
THAT'S THE HEIGHT OF RACISM.
YOU THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT ME
AND TELL ME WHO I AM AND
IT'S THAT KIND OF ARROGANCE
THROUGHOUT THE AD.
THROUGHOUT THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY THAT GOT DONALD TRUMP
ELECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
>> THAT ATTITUDE, LOOK, THAT
IS THE HEIGHT OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
HE DID NOT CONDONE THE
CHARLOTTEVILLE TORCH BEARING
WHITE SUPREMACISTS.
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING
DONALD TRUMP ARE IN EFFECT
SUPPORTING THAT KIND OF
ACTIVITY.
>> NO, THAT IS NOT --
AINSLEY: THAT'S A BLANKET
STATEMENT.
>> THAT RACIST IS
INTOLERANT.
>> HOW CAN YOU.
>> DEMEANING AND AIR
>> DEMEANING AND ARROGANT.
THE IF ANYTHING THIS TSA
SERVES AS A GET OUT THE VOTE
FOR SEARCHES, RIGHT?
THESE ARE THE SAME ARROGANT
AND DEMEANING PEOPLE THAT
ARE BEHIND THIS AD.
THEY ARE ALSO OCCUPYING THE
PREVIOUS OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION AND WHO ARE
CLAWING TO GET BACK INTO
POWER THIS YEAR.
AINSLEY: LET ME READ WHAT
JOHN LOVETT WROTE A FORMER
OBAMA SPEECH WRITER.
HEY, TOM STEYER, THE ADS ARE
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND
ANNOYING.
YOU ARE NOT HELPING ANYONE
BUT YOURSELF, MAYBE.
AND YOU ARE WASTING MONEY
THAT COULD REALLY HELP THAT
WHEN WE ARE IN THE FIGHT FOR
OUR POLITICAL LIVES.
THAT'S A DEMOCRAT.
>> MY BIG QUESTION IS WHY IS
THIS SO IRK SOME TO
CONSERVATIVES?
YOU ARE IDOL -- INTERESTING
USING A MOTHER AN EVERY DAY
AVERAGE MOM LITTLE BOB IN
NICE HOME WHICH IS FRANKLY
ALONG THE LINES OF
CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGY THAT
THE MOTHER SHOULD BE IN THE
HOME NURTURING FUTURE
GENERATIONS TAKING THAT AND
TURNING IT ON ITS FACE WHEN
IN REALITY.
>> I MANY SITTING HERE AS A
STARK CONTRAST TOGGLE
EVERYTHING THAT AD.
I AM BLACK, I AM A
CONSERVATIVE AND THAT'S.
>> YOU ARE AN OUTLIER.
>> THAT'S INTOLERANT.
ALL THROUGHOUT MY
NEIGHBORHOODS I SEE THESE
RIDICULOUS SIGNS TALKING
ABOUT HATE HAS NO HOME HERE.
BUT, LIBERALS ARE THE
PHYSICAL EMBODIMENT OF THAT
VERY THING.
>> NO.
WE ARE --
>> HOW IS THIS PIECE OF
PROPAGANDA ANY DIFFERENT
THAN THE RUSSIAN FACEBOOK
ADS THAT SEEM TO MAKE
LIBERALS RUN WITH THEIR HAIR
ON FIRE.
IT IS DEROGATORY.
IT IS BIASED AND IT IS
PROMOTING MISLEADING
INFORMATION THAT IS MEANT TO
DIVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
HOW IS THIS ANY DIFFERENT
THAN THE RUSSIAN ADS THAT
SEEM TO PUT THEIR HAIR ON
FIRE.
>> THIS IS NOT BIGOT
TRINCHTS IS BIGOTRY.
>> BASED ON ANYBODY'S RACE,
ETHNICITY.
>> IS HE BEATING UP POOR
KIDS.
>> LET ME ASK YOU, ARE YOU
WORRIED THAT THIS TYPE OF A
MESSAGE, JUST A BLANKET
STATEMENT ABOUT THE G.O.P.
AND WHAT YOU SAID IN THE
BEGINNING AND IT'S ALMOST
LIKE THAT DEPLORABLE
COMMENT.
IT DOESN'T -- DO YOU THINK
THAT IS GOING TO BACK FIRE
WHEN WE SEE THE --
>> -- WHY ARE WE SO UPSET
ABOUT THIS?
THIS IS A PARODY.
SPEAKING TO STYER'S BASE
WHICH ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE
THESE THINGS AND SPEAKING
SPECIFICALLY TO MOTHERS.
THAT IS THE PART SO IRK SOME
TO THE RIGHT WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT FAMILIES.
THE REALITY IS THAT FAMILIES
TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS AT
HOME.
I TALK ABOUT POLITICS WITH
MY CHILDREN AT HOME.
THE RADIO IS ON ALL THE
TIME.
THESE ARE ACTUAL ISSUES THAT
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
MOTHERS TO BE INFLUENCING
THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT WHAT
THE G.O.P. IS ABOUT, THEN
YOU NEED TO BE HAVING A
DIFFERENT MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT
THE G.O.P. IS.
>> MISLEADING AND DEROGATORY
INFORMATION.
THERE IS NO TRUTH THERE.
I AM NOT TRYING TO BEAT UP
ON POOR KIDS.
I AM NOT WALKING AROUND WITH
A TORCH IN MY HAND.
AND I AM NOT TRYING TO BEAT
UP ILLEGALLIES AND SEND THEM
HOME.
IT'S DEROGATORY.
TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN, TALK
ABOUT FACTS.
TALK ABOUT CLEAR-EYED LOGIC
AND STOP THE CONSTANT
NARRATIVE OF PUSHING HATE.
