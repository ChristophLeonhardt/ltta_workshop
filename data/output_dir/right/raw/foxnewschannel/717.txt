1
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:11,936
>> Tucker: IT'S NOT EXACTLY

2
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:13,871
THE ROLLING STONES ON TOUR, BUT

3
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,272
HILLARY CLINTON'S ENDLESS

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,410
CLINTON WAS RECENTLY IN THE

5
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,847
UNITED KINGDOM WHERE SHE BEGAN

6
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:24,415
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE AMERICAN

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:24,915
ELECTORAL SYSTEM.

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,784
HERE IS A SELECTION.

9
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:29,854
>> IN THE U.S., IT WAS A PERFECT

10
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,788
STORM.

11
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:31,822
DEEP CURRENTS OF ANGER AND

12
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:36,327
RESENTMENT FLOWING THROUGH OUR

13
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:44,535
WORLD MY EMAILS FOR THE MOST

14
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,579
CAMPAIGN WAGED FROM THE KREMLIN.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,348
>> Tucker: WAGED FROM THE

16
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:57,682
KREMLIN.

17
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,350
THE DARKEST RESOURCES OF THE

18
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,384
KREMLIN NO DOUBT.

19
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:03,788
BUT THE 2016 ELECTION IS STILL

20
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,290
ATOP THE CONVERSATION.

21
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,792
THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT IT UP

22
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:08,959
HIMSELF LAST NIGHT.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,562
>> SHE WRITES A BOOK AND SHE

24
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:12,396
DOES THE TOUR.

25
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:15,199
HOW MANY REASONS THAT SHE GIVE

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,600
FOR USING       LOSING THE ELECT

27
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:16,634
FOR USING       LOSING THE ELECO

28
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:20,838
REASON.

29
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:30,281
OBVIOUSLY A FREQUENT AND

30
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:32,616
TREASURED GUEST ON THIS SHOW.

31
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:34,852
I DON'T WANT TO CARRY WATER FOR

32
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,253
THE KREMLIN, BUT I CAN'T RESIST

33
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:36,587
ASKING.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
I'M STILL BAFFLED.

35
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:43,661
>> IT MATCHES WHAT WE WERE

36
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,863
DISCUSSING EARLIER IN THE SHOW

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,234
BASED IN EMOTION, NO FACTS, IT

38
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,605
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLICY

39
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:55,473
AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SOME

40
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:58,642
UP SESSION IF YOU WILL, AND

41
00:01:58,643 --> 00:01:59,577
RAGE.

42
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,513
SHE IS ON FOREIGN SOIL, IN

43
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:05,282
ADDITION, AND YET NOW, SHE'S NOT

44
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:08,219
ONLY CONFRONTING TRUMP ABOUT

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,186
POLICY, OR ABOUT HAVING BETTER

46
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:20,197
TURKEY'S TYRANNICAL LEADER WHO

47
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:20,998
JUST GOT REELECTED.

48
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:24,368
BUT SHE STILL, PERSONALLY FOR

49
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,203
SOME REASON, CAN'T RESOLVE THE

50
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:28,205
FACT THAT SHE FAILED.

51
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,174
THAT THIS WAS NOT GOING TO

52
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,208
HAPPEN.

53
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,309
AND WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT A

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,545
RUSSIAN CONSPIRACY, IT REALLY

55
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:38,315
WAS ABOUT THE SIMPLE BASIC

56
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,850
DECISIONS IN THE CAMPAIGN LIKE

57
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,786
NOT GOING TO WISCONSIN.

58
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,290
TO THAT FAILURE.

59
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,399
>> Tammy: YES.

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,435
AS A WOMAN, AND I WANT WOMEN IN

61
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,436
POWER, WE ARE TERRIFIC LEADERS.

62
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:02,239
THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BECOME AN

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,574
ALMOST STEREOTYPICAL CARTOON OF

64
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,810
WHAT HAPPENS WITH A WOMAN,

65
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:09,280
WE DON'T LOOK AND DEAL WITH THE

66
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,318
THIS IS NOT HELPFUL.

67
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,886
IT IS A SHAME AND, AT THE SAME

68
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:18,789
TIME, YOU ARE ARGUING -- AND

69
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,990
WHEN SHE ARGUES AGAINST THE

70
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,126
ELECTORAL COLLEGE AS AN EXAMPLE,

71
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,228
SHE IS ARGUING THAT THE ENTIRE

72
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,362
REPUBLICAN STRUCTURE OF THE

73
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,665
UNITED STATES IS AT FAULT AS

74
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:27,965
WELL.

75
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,800
IT'S A FOUNDERS NOW WHO ARE THE

76
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:35,539
REPRESENTATION ALSO OF WHAT IS

77
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,440
HAPPENING HERE AT HOME WITH THE

78
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:39,610
LEFT AND WHAT'S GOING ON NOW

79
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,947
WITH ALL OF THE HARASSMENT AND

80
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:43,314
VIOLENCE.

81
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:44,815
>> NOT HELPFUL.

82
00:03:44,816 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
