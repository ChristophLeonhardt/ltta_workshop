It kind of makes me nostalgic
in this building because it's a
look that I
remember very well from the
from the 80s. A lot of people
hated it but it really does,
it gives it a liveliness
that the urban environment
might not have had.
After graffiti was no
longer on trains,
I think it migrated to
walls and to spaces like
this, which were abandoned
spaces, and kids
could come in here and
paint at their leisure.
It would be great to, if
this place is renovated it
would be great if this
interior walls were kept as
they were rather than
made pristine again
Of course graffiti is an
ephemeral art form so it was
never intended to stay forever.
