Welcome to the Trump
International Hotel.
It is housed in Washington’s 
Old Post Office,
owned by the
federal government.
The Trump Organization holds a
60-year lease on the building.
The hotel is one example
at the center of a new lawsuit
filed by Maryland and the
District of Columbia this week.
It claims President Trump has
used his position
to help his businesses and violated
the Constitution’s bans against
self-dealing by receiving payments
from foreign governments,
federal agencies and states.
During the week of Mr. Trump's
inauguration,
the minimum nightly rate at the
hotel was about $735 dollars
for a room like this one.
