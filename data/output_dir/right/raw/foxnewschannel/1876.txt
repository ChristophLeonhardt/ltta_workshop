00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:10,874
>> Laura: WE SAY THIS A LOT

2
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:11,508
BUT DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY

3
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,877
JUDICIAL WATCH THEY CONFIRM

4
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:15,912
COLLUSION BETWEEN MUELLER AND

00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:16,713

WHAT?

12
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:29,292
THAT SUBSTANTIATES NEWS REPORTS

13
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:31,094
THAT COMEY MET WITH MUELLER

14
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:31,795

BECAUSE ALL OF CONGRESS WANTED

44
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:22,479
HIM TO TESTIFY.

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,515

INCLUDING THE GENERAL COUNSEL

57
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,069
AND RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING.

58
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,603
THERE IS MISTAKES.

59
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:49,072
THERE'S TYPOS.

60
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,273
CONSULT WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

61
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:51,808
MUELLER TO DETERMINE THE TIMING

62
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:52,676
OF ANY SUCH TRUST MONEY.

63
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:53,510
SO THE TIME HE SHOULD BE WORKED

64
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,314
OUT WITH MUELLER.

65
00:01:57,314 --> 00:01:58,448
IS THERE ANY BENIGN EXPLANATION

66
00:01:58,448 --> 00:01:58,815
FOR THIS?

67
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:03,120
>> TYPICALLY THERE WOULD BE SOME

68
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,554
COORDINATION, BUT WHAT COMEY

69
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:06,289
SAID WAS BEYOND THE PALE IN

70
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:06,923
TERMS OF WHAT GOVERNMENT

71
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:08,324
OFFICIALS ARE TYPICALLY ALLOWED

72
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:10,160
TO SAY IN SUCH SITUATIONS.

73
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,129
CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE AN FBI

74
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,230
DIRECTOR AND YOU ARE HAVING

75
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,132
MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT OF THE

76
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:15,799
UNITED STATES, TYPICALLY THE

77
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,134
AGENCY TALLIES YOU YOU'RE

78
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:18,535
NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT.

79
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:19,870
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT

80
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,472
DOCUMENTS YOU CREATED AT THE FBI

81
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,574
ABOUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

82
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,409
COMEY HAD FREE REIN DURING HIS

83
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:27,544
TESTIMONY AND IT WAS BLESSED

84
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:31,248
BOTH BY THE FBI IT LOOKS LIKE

85
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,750
AND BY MR. MUELLER.

86
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,120
>> Laura: SOL, THIS IS

87
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,454
CURIOUS.

88
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:40,924
AS THEY REFER TO AN EMAIL, I

89
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:43,493
GUESS THERE ARE INSTITUTIONAL

90
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,095
PRIVILEGES OR PREROGATIVES THAT

91
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:48,098
MAY BE PRESENTED BY ANY SUCH

92
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:48,532
TESTIMONY.

93
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:51,701
SO THE FBI, SPECIAL COUNSEL'S

94
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,502
OFFICE, MET WITH JAMES COMEY.

95
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:55,238
WE WANT TO BASICALLY CORDON

96
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:56,339
EIGHT ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS.

97
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,340
I GUESS, I DON'T KNOW THE

98
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,708
INSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGES, THINGS

99
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,376
THAT COMEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO

100
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:02,112
REVEAL PRESUMABLY ON

101
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:02,712
CAPITOL HILL.

102
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:05,315
DO YOU SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH

103
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,317
THIS, THE APPEARANCE OF

104
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,084
COORDINATION?

105
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:11,888
>> I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM FOR

106
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:12,522
MUELLER.

107
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,324
TO ME, THIS ISN'T REALLY NEW

108
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:14,624
NEWS.

109
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:16,026
I THINK COMEY AT THE TIME

110
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,527
ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO

111
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,762
CONSULT WITH MUELLER.

112
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,630
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT COMEY HAS

113
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,098
HAD A MAN CRUSH ON MUELLER FOR

114
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,935
QUITE SOME TIME AND WANTS WRAP

115
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:26,903
HIMSELF IN MUELLER'S GLORY.

116
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:29,506
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY READ THESE

117
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,308
LATEST EMAILS THAT TOM GOT.

118
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,276
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

119
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:34,511
WRONG WITH COMEY GOING TO

120
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,712
MUELLER AND SAYING I'M GOING TO

121
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,746
TESTIFY.

122
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,348
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH

123
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,416
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY OR HOW I'M

124
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,917
GOING TO SAY IT?

125
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,619
DO WE KNOW THAT MUELLER BLESSED

126
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,288
ANYTHING, OR IS THAT JUST

127
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:46,923
SOMEBODY SURMISED?

128
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:47,924
AGAIN, NOTHING SURPRISES ME

129
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:48,458
ABOUT JAMES COMEY.

130
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,294
I DON'T THINK IT'S BE USED FOR

131
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:51,828
SMEAR MUELLER.

132
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:53,530
>> Laura: HERE'S ANOTHER BIG

133
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:53,830
STORY.

134
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,765
HER ME TO COME I WANT TO GET

135
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:56,900
INTO THIS.

136
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,901
DEVIN NUNES AND TREY GOWDY WENT

137
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:58,935
TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TODAY

138
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:01,104
AND THEY WERE ALLOWED TO REVIEW

139
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,106
CERTAIN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

140
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:04,007
THEY SAID THIS AFTERWARD.

141
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,909
WE HAD A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION

142
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,078
TODAY WITH OFFICIALS AT THE

143
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,312
OFFICE OF DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL

144
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:10,080
INTELLIGENCE, DEPARTMENT OF

145
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,214
JUSTICE, FBI AND RUTH QUESTIONS

146
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:15,885
RELATED TO THE INTEL COMMUNITY.

147
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:17,087
COMMITTED TO HOLDING FURTHER

148
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,488
DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

149
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,089
WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

150
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,890
DIALOGUE.

151
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,525
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

152
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,260
THIS FOLLOWS NEWNESS THREATENING

153
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,927
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS AGAINST

154
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:26,696
JEFF SESSIONS.

155
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:27,464
THREATENING CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS

156
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:30,700
TO GET ANYWHERE.

157
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,103
WHAT, WHERE IS THIS GOING?

158
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,504
>> LOOKS BAD FOR THE REPUTATION

159
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:35,572
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

160
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:38,541
THE FBI HERE.

161
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,509
IT TAKES THREATS, REPEATED

162
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:40,143
THREATS.

163
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:41,177
IT'S LIKE THOSE MOVIES WHERE THE

164
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,913
VILLAINS ARE CHASING THE TRAIN

165
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:44,648
AND THEY ARE THROWING STUFF OFF

166
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,882
THE BACK TO TRY TO DELAY THEM.

167
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,217
IT'S LIKE THAT.

168
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:48,385
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO

169
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:49,953
HAVE TO PAY THE PIPER AND

170
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:50,620
CONFORMED WITH INFORMATION.

171
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,222
THEY ARE DOING IT VERY SLOWLY.

172
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,291
CLEARLY SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO

173
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,425
HIDE BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE

174
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,893
SUMMING TO HARD TO KNOW IT'S

175
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,862
REALLY IRONIC HERE IS THAT THE

176
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:01,698
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS AN

177
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,899
INFERIOR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

178
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:03,733
CREATED BY CONGRESS.

179
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,202
FOR THEM TO ARROGANTLY SAY THAT

180
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,103
THEY ARE SOMEHOW ABOVE THEIR

181
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,772
CONGRESS AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO

182
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:09,539
ANSWER REQUESTS LIKE THE REST OF

183
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:12,509
THE GOVERNMENT IT'S REALLY

184
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:12,909
OUTRAGEOUS.

185
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,010
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THEM TO

186
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,377
COOPERATE.

187
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,879
THEY PUT OUT THE STORY THE DOJ

188
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,314
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS ON BOARD

189
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:18,948
WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT THEN

190
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:19,649
THE WHITE HOUSE BUT NOT AS DIM

191
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:20,950
AS I KNOW ACTUALLY WANT YOU TO

192
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,886
COOPERATE.

193
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,588
JUST DON'T GIVE THEM THIS EXTRA

194
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:27,290
TOP HIGH SECRET.

195
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,291
WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE REDACTIONS

196
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,125
IN THE PAST THAT HAVE BEEN

197
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:29,826
GRUDGINGLY UNVEILED AND THAT

198
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:30,860
THEY WERE ENOUGH IN BURGER.

199
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,996
THEY WERE SIMPLY THERE TO

200
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:35,532
PROTECT THE DUE DATE.

201
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:36,900
>> Laura: THEY WERE

202
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,500
EXCULPATORY.

203
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,101
THEY WERE EXCULPATORY.

204
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,737
NOT FOR THE DOJ.

205
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,272
>> FOR FLYNN AND OTHER PEOPLE.

206
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:45,308
THEY ARE PROTECTING.

207
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:47,143
>> Laura: THERE IS ALWAYS A

208
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:47,944
TUG-OF-WAR BETWEEN CONGRESS AND

209
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:49,012
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

210
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:52,048
THAT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED.

211
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,550
>> KNOCKED TWO THIS DEGREE.

212
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,919
>> Laura: THIS TAKES IT TO AN

213
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,353
NEW LEVEL.

214
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:57,020
KIMBERLEY STRASSEL HAS AN

215
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,954
INTERESTING ANALYSIS TO MAKE

216
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:59,723
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL."

217
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:01,591
SHE WRITES IT'S ABOUT THE FBI

218
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:01,925
SOURCE.

219
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,394
SHE SAYS WE KNOW MR. NUNEZ'S

220
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:07,097
REQUEST DEALS WITH THE TOP

221
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,064
SECRET INTEL SOURCE OF THE

222
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,934
FBI AND CIA WHO IS A U.S.

223
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,969
CITIZEN AND WHO WAS INVOLVED IN

224
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,537
THE RUSSIA COLLUSION PROBE.

225
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,406
WE MIGHT TAKE THIS TO MEAN THAT

226
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:18,708
THE FBI SECRETLY HAD A PERSON ON

227
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,377
THE PAYROLL WHO USED HIS OR HER

228
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:23,279
NONFBI CREDENTIALS TO INTERACT

229
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,684
IN SOME CAPACITY WITH THE TERM

230
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,886
CAMPAIGN.

231
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:30,520
STRESSFUL HAS INCREDIBLE

232
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,087
SOURCES, I KNOW THAT.

233
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:34,124
SHE SEEMS TO BE INDICATING THAT

234
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:34,791
THERE COULD'VE BEEN SOMEONE

235
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,027
INSIDE THE TERM CAMPAIGN FROM

236
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,729
THE FBI WHO WAS EMBEDDED IN

237
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:40,130
THERE.

238
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,631
I GUESS SPYING ON THE TERM

239
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:41,998
CAMPAIGN.

240
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,601
WE WILL SEE IF ANY OF THIS PANS

241
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,403
OUT BUT TOM.

242
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,538
FROM THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

243
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,173
COMMITTEE THAT THERE WAS A

244
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:50,874
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION

245
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:51,608
AGAINST FLYNN WHILE HE WAS ON

246
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,343
THE CAMPAIGN ARE WORKING FOR THE

247
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:53,743
TRANSITION.

248
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:55,145
>> Laura: HOW DOES THAT PLAY

249
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:55,779
OUT?

250
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,347
WIRETAPS OR WHAT?

251
00:06:57,347 --> 00:07:00,483
>> WHAT DID THE PROGRAM ENTAIL?

252
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,619
THIS JUSTICE BERMAN TAKES THE

253
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,386
APPROACH OF THE MODIFIED LIMITED

254
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:07,123
HANGOUT IN TERMS OF INFORMATION.

255
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:07,824
FOUR MONTHS THE MUELLER

256
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,325
OPERATION SAT ON THE FACT THAT

257
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:13,930
THEY HAD THE STRZOK-PAGE

258
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,297
MESSAGES.

259
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,099
THEN WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE

260
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:16,733
CLINTON DNC DOSSIER.

261
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,903
THERE IS GOING TO A THIRD OR

262
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:21,104
FIFTH SHOE THAT DROPS.

263
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:22,038
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S

264
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,506
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AT ISSUE

265
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:23,807
HERE.

266
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,809
THERE IS EMBARRASSING

267
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:26,843
INFORMATION.

268
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:33,116
>> Laura: SOL, THE STRASSEL

269
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:33,883
POINTS.

270
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:38,154
I KNOW YOU LOVE IFS.

271
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:41,591
IF THE FBI EMBEDDED SOMEONE

272
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:46,329
INSIDE THE TERM CAMPAIGN WITH A

273
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:47,697
BELIEF OR RELIGION OR PURPOSE,

274
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:48,832
IF RESTER WAS REALLY TRYING TO

275
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,366
THROW THE ELECTION IF THEY IT

276
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,201
INFORMATION INDICATING THAT,

277
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,603
THEY PUT SOMEONE INSIDE THE TERM

278
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:54,304
CAMPAIGN BURROWED AWAY LOOKING

279
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:58,007
IN ONE OF THOSE CUBICLES,

280
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,309
WITH HIS YOU'RE OUT OR HER EAR

281
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,077
OUT, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THERE IF

282
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,178
THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE?

283
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:03,346
>> BO, THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM

284
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:04,681
UNLESS YOU HAVE THE SAME KIND OF

285
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:05,648
PROBLEM YOU HAVE WHEN YOU SEARCH

286
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:06,349
A LAWYER'S OFFICE.

287
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,786
YOU BETTER HAVE SOME THING

288
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:10,520
REALLY, REALLY GOOD TO BE ABLE

289
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,121
TO JUSTIFY THAT.

290
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:12,722
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

291
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:13,356
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING.

292
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:16,593
BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER, LET'S

293
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,495
GIVE CREDIT TO JOHN EHRLICHMAN,

294
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,230
THE AUTHOR OF MODIFIED LIMITED

295
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,563
HANGOUT.

296
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:22,232
I WOULD WANT TO LEAVE HIM

297
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:22,999
TWISTING SLOWLY, SLOWLY AND THE

298
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,501
WIND FROM ALORA.

299
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,134
>> Laura: EXCELLENT.

300
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:27,103
>> KEEP IN MIND THERE'S AN OLD

301
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:31,341
SAYING THE WAGES OF CRYING WOLF.

302
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:32,942
HARMEET PUT HER FINGER ON IT.

303
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,043
WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY INSTANCES

304
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:34,777
WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

305
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:37,647
IN THE API HAS SAID WE HAVE

306
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:41,717
TO REDACT THIS BECAUSE IT'S

307
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:42,418
ENDANGERING NATIONAL SECURITY

308
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,720
AND ITS CLASS BY.

309
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,422
WE'VE SEEN NO TIME AFTER TIME

310
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:47,590
WHERE IT'S BEEN UNREDACTED AND

311
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,526
IT'S JUST BEEN EMBARRASSING.

312
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:50,760
THE LATEST EXAMPLE -- WHEN YOU

313
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,861
DO THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES THE

314
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,663
FLOOR GOING TO STOP BELIEVING

315
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:53,930
IN.

316
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,064
YOU LOSE ALL CREDIT ABILITY.

317
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,134
WE SAW THAT LAST WEEKEND WHEN

318
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,135
THEY FINALLY UNREDACTED TO

319
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,170
PASSAGES IN THE HOUSE

320
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,506
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MAJORITY

321
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:05,341
REPORT, THE SELECT COMMITTEE

322
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,009
REPORT, THEY REVEALED TWO

323
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,278
INCREDIBLE THINGS.

324
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:10,413
ONE THAT THE FBI DIDN'T THINK

325
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:11,180
MIKE FLYNN HAD LIED.

326
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,083
WE HEARD ABOUT THAT.

327
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:14,551
>> Laura: HUGE.

328
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,086
>> SHOCKING.

329
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,322
THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T FOCUSED ON

330
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:20,290
ENOUGH, THAT THE UNDERLYING

331
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,525
CRIME MIKE FLYNN WAS BEING

332
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,161
INVESTIGATED FOR WAS THE LOGAN

333
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:27,330
ACT, AN ACT THAT SPENT A DEAD

334
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,301
LETTER FOR OVER 200 YEARS.

335
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:31,868
ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING.

336
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:32,902
>> Laura: THEN JOHN KERRY

337
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:35,505
NEVER VIOLATED, OF COURSE.

338
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,107
>> IT'S REALLY SHOCKING.

339
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:41,511
IT'S REALLY SHOCKING THAT SALLY

340
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,379
YATES WOULD APPROVE AND GREEN

341
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,181
LIGHT AN INVESTIGATION OF

342
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,116
ANYBODY FOR VIOLATING THE LOGAN

343
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,151
ACT.

344
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,719
>> Laura: LET'S TALK TURKEY.

345
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,522
WE ARE WAY OVER.

346
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:52,822
SOUND.

347
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:53,957
THE HISSY FIT OF A RESIGNATION

348
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:54,290
LETTER.

349
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,726
OH, COME ON.

350
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,294
SHE MARCHES HERSELF OR THE

351
00:09:58,294 --> 00:09:59,562
AGENTS TO INTERVIEW FLYNN.

352
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:00,563
THAT WHOLE THING SMELLS LIKE A

353
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:01,931
BIG FAT SET UP TO ME.

354
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:05,101
SALLY YATES.

355
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,235
HAVING ANY BUSINESS GOING TO

356
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:07,103
INTERVIEW MIKE FLYNN.

357
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:08,571
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A LAWYER.

358
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,908
OF COURSE I'LL TALK TO YOU.

359
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:12,542
MIKE FLYNN SHOULD'VE NEVER

360
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,776
TALKED TO THEM.

361
00:10:13,776 --> 00:00:00,000
HE DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT.
