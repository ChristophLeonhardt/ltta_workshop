STEVE: DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ IN
THE HOUR AFTER BRETT
KAVANAUGH WAS CONFIRMED TO
THE SUPREME COURT TWEETED
SUPPORT FOR ABOLISHING THE
ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO PREVENT
MORE KAVANAUGHS.
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ
TWEETING, QUOTE:  IT IS
WELL-PAST TIME WE ELIMINATE
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE A
SHADOW OF SLAVERY'S POWER ON
AMERICA TODAY THAT
UNDERMINES OUR NATION AS A
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
SO, WHY DOES THE ELECTORAL
COLLEGE MATTER?
JOINING US NOW DINESH DA
SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE
FILMMAKER AND AUTHOR OF DID
THE DEATH OF A NATION "ALSO
A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE
AVAILABLE.
WHEN YOU READ HER TWEET,
WHAT DID SHE THINK SHE WAS
TALKING ABOUT.
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK SHE
IS CONFUSING THE ELECTORAL
COLLEGE WITH THE THREE FIFTH
CLAUSE.
THE THREE FIFTH CLAUSE WAS
ABOUT SLAVERY ARGUMENT NORTH
AND SOUTH OVER
REPRESENTATION.
IRONICALLY THE NORTH, WHICH
WAS THE ANTI-SLAVERY SIDE
WANTED BLACKS TO COUNT FOR
ZERO BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO
REDUCE THE REPRESENTATIVE
POWER OF THE SLAVE STATES.
THE SOUTH WANTED BLACKS TO
COUNT FOR A FULL PERSON.
THREE FIFTH CLAUSE TO
PRESENTED TO SHOW THE BLACKS
NOT TO BE FULLY HUMAN ISN'T
AT ALL.
ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A
DIFFERENT MATTER.
LARGE STATES AND SMALL
STATES.
NOT.
ANNA: AT THIS QUAKED ISSUE,
WE HAVE STLA NOW.
WE HAVE LARGE STATES, WE
HAVE SMALL STATES, IF WE HAD
A SYSTEM THAT GAVE POWER
ONLY TO THE LARGE STATES.
THE SMALL STATES WOULD BE
UNREPRESENTED.
THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING
THE CORE OF OUR FOUNDING IS
THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.
TO CREATE A UNION, THE
FOUNDERS NEEDED THE CONSENT
OF THE LARGE STATES AND
SMALL STATES.
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS
PART OF THAT ARITHMETIC.
STEVE: SURE.
YOU KNOW, DINESH, THE
ELECTORAL COLLEGE HAS BECOME
A TALKING POINT FOR THE LEFT
BECAUSE, LOOK AT DONALD
TRUMP.
HE WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
BUT LOST THE POPULAR VOTE.
SAME THING WITH GEORGE BUSH.
SO WE HAVE HEARD THIS FOR A
WHILE.
>> WE HAVE HEARD IT FOR A
WHILE.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN THIS
CASE, I'M NOT SAYING WE
SHOULDN'T HAVE A DEBATE
ABOUT THIS.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMEONE
ONCE SAID TONIGHT TAKE A
FENCE DOWN IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHY IT WAS PUT UP IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
THE FOUNDERS HAD A
PHILOSOPHICAL STATESMANSHIP
THAT TRIED TO HAVE POWERFUL
IDEAS BUT IMPLEMENTED IN THE
REAL WORLD.
THE PROBLEM IS TODAY WE
DON'T UNDERSTANDING OUR
SCHOOLS DON'T DO A GOOD JOB
IMPEECHING THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE FOUNDING.
YOU HAVE THIS FANATICISM.
STEVE: YOU BLAME HER
EDUCATION.
