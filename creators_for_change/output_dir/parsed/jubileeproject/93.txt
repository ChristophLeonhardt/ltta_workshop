then Hendrick went back to South Korea
and lived happily ever after
so the script ends with him going back
to Korea yeah
any comments I like it yeah it's a good
script okay
yeah yeah I like it too the only thing
is do you think that your protagonist
might be extremely flat cuz like the
film starts out and he's tying this
whiny bitch and then at the end of the
film he's still a whiny bitch the
kindness watch what sulk first six
minutes Eric your main character has no
art at all he literally just does
nothing the entire time I think the
movie should have a different ending I
would say that the main character should
decide to stay in America at the end as
he finds his purpose yeah yes yes that
do that that way instead of just texting
his friends the entire time and
complaining a lot he actually makes a
decision at the end and then has some
kind of a mentality not only that but
that adds a message to your script and
right now there is no message in the
script unless your message is my
protagonist is a whiny bitch
