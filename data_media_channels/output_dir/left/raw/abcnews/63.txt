THAT IS WAS MEMORY OF THE 58 

21
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,498

BRIAN ROSS, AND WE'RE LEARNING 

25
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:50,341
MUCH MORE NOW ABOUT THE SHOOTER,

26
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:54,012
STEPHEN PADDOCK.

27
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,415
64, ACTED ALONE AND KILLED 

28
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,716
HIMSELF.

29
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,651
STILL SEARCHING FOR A MOTIVE.

30
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:03,754
>> WE KNOW HE SPENT SEVERAL 

31
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:07,725
WEEKS STOCKPILING WEAPONS AND 

32
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,025
AMMUNITION.

33
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,094
GOT A VERY HARD TO ATTAIN 

34
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,129
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

35
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,564
BUT HE WAS A VERY UNREMARKABLE 

36
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:17,868
PERSON AT AGE 64 HE MOVED TO A 

37
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:23,407
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF

HIS BROTHER SAYS HE WAS NOT 

40
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,779
POLITICAL, HE HAD SOME MONEY AND

41
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,914
LIVED MOSTLY TO PLAY VIDEO 

42
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:30,114
POKER.

43
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:35,219
>> UNREMARKABLE, PERHAPS, BUT 

44
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,721
PIERRE THOMAS, A MAN THAT BUILT 

45
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,690
UP QUITE AN ARSENAL.

46
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,826
19 GUNS IN THE ROOM THAT WE SEE 

47
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,961
THE WINDOW BLOWN OUT RIGHT 

48
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:44,295
THERE.

49
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,564
>> HE CAME ARMED TO KILL.

50
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:50,101
OUR SOURCES TELLING US ROUGHLY 

51
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,703
20 GUNS, 19 GUNS I WAS SPECIALLY

00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,805
TOLD IN THAT ROOM AS HE FIRED 

53
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,041
DOWN ON THOSE UNSUSPECTING 

54
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:02,313
PEOPLE TRYING TO ENJOY A

CONCERT, GEORGE.

58

LAW ENFORCEMENT TRYING TO 

59
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:05,750
DETERMINE WHERE THE GUNS CAME 

60
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,384
FROM.

61
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:11,222
TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THEY WERE

62
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,056
BOUGHT AUTOMATIC, IF THEY WERE 

63
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:17,528
AUGMENTED TO BECOME AUTOMATIC.

64
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,630
A HUGE INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW.

65
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,469
NOTHING REMARKABLE IN HIS 

66
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,103
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND TO SUGGEST 

67
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,238
HE WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

68
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,106
>> THE AUTHORITIES HAVE KNOCKED 

69
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:30,908
DOWN A CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY 

70
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:31,909
FROM AN ISIS WEBSITE.

71
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,213
WE WANT TO GO TO MATT GUTMAN WHO

72
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,848
IS ON THE SCENE.

73
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:38,849
THIS WAS A SCENE OF PURE TERROR 

74
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,521
AND PANIC THAT UNFOLDED ABOUT 

75
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,658
10:07 LAS VEGAS TIME.

76
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:55,966
>> GEORGE, WE WERE ABLE TO SEE 

77
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,935
DOWN INTO THE CONCERT VENUE, AND

78
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,638
WHAT WE SAW WAS INCREDIBLY 

79
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,272
DISTURBING.

80
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,107
THE DEBRIS OF WHAT HUNDREDS AND 

81
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,344
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND.

82
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:18,255
THERE WAS STRETCHESBANDAGES ON  

83
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,322
DISTANCE BETWEEN WHERE THE 

84
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,726
SHOOTER WAS AND THE CONCERT 

85
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:21,958
VENUE.

86
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:23,527
WE THINK ABOUT THE MASS AMOUNT 

87
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:27,231
OF BULLETS AND FIRE FIRED IN 

88
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:27,431
THERE.

89
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,766
IT WAS DEADLY ACCURATE AND 

90
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:32,536
ASTONISHING GIVEN THE VAST 

91
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:35,139
DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SITES

92
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,510
AND THE TYPES OF WEAPONS, THE AR

93
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,978
TYPE RIVFLES.

94
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,045
VERY DISTURBING.

95
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,148
THERE ARE FIRST RESPONDERS GOING

96
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,283
THROUGH AND COMING THROUGH AND 

97
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:48,518
FORENSIC TEAMS TRYING TO FIND 

98
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:49,920
WHATEVER EVIDENCE THEY CAN AND 

99
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,024
PICK UP ANY PIECES THEY CAN. 

100
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,793
>> SURVEILLANCE VIDEO LIKELY TO 

101
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,528
PICK UP MORE EVIDENCE IN THE 

102
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,629
COMING DAYS AS WELL.

103
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:03,334
THIS MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE 

104
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,502
VICTIMS.

105
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,403
LINDSEY DAVIS IS AT THE HOSPITAL

106
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:09,507
WHERE THEY TOOK IN HUNDREDS OF 

107
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:09,740
VICTIMS.

108
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,574
YOU HAVE EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE 

109
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:15,546
AREA DEALING WITH THIS TRAUMA.

110
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,614
>> YES, 515 PEOPLE INJURED.

111
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:20,484
WE JUST MOVED AWAY, BUT UMC IS 

112
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:23,287
JUST ACROSS THE STREET OVER 

113
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,888
HERE, IN THIS PARKING LOT THEY 

114
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,524
BROUGHT IN A BUNCH OF RV'S, AND 

115
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:32,663
THIS IS A POP UP, IMPROMPTU 

116
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,231
BLOOD DRIVE.

117
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,465
WE'RE TOLD AT SOME LOCATIONS 

118
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,001
THERE IS A FIVE HOUR WAIT, RIGHT

119
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,769
NOW THEY'RE AT CAPACITY.

120
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,671
IT'S JUST ONE WAY THAT THE 

121
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,773
COMMUNITY IS RALLYING AROUND THE

122
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,308
VICTIMS JUST ACROSS THE STREET 

123
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,245
WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE 

124
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:51,349
STILL FIGHTING FIR OR THEIR LIV.

125
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,052
12 PEOPLE STILL IN CRITICAL 

126
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:55,319
CONDITION.

127
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,655

LAST WELL BEYOND AS WELL.

129
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,794
THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, 

130
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,529
THOSE VICTIMS ON THE SCENE, 

131
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:06,097
LINDSEY.

132
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,331
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

133
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,166
I THINK THAT IS THE LARGE THING 

134
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,869
SO IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THE 

135
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,437
COMMUNITY IS THEY'RE EAGER DO 

136
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,539

THERE IS A GO FUND ME PAGE, 

138

FREE FOOD AND CHARGING STATIONS,

141
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,818
TRYING TO ERASE SOME OF THE 

142
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,820
UGLINESS OF THE DAY.

143
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,522
>> OKAY, THANK YOU LINDSEY 

144
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,591
DAVIS, NO WORDS FROM THE

149
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,566
AND CALLED ON ALL MILES PER 

150
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:45,469
HOURS TO COME TOGETHER AT THIS 

151
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:45,702
MOMENT.

152
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,038
>> YES, THIS IS A DAY FOR

HAS ORDERED ALL FLAGS FLY AT 

155
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:00,618
HALF-STAFF TODAY.

156
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,985
THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING JUST 

157
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,388
ENDED MOMENTS AGO, AND THERE WAS

158
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,123
A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN THERE 

159
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,659
FOR SARAH SANDERS ABOUT THE 

160
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,293
PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON GUN 

161
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,894
CONTROL GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN 

162
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:11,495
LAS VEGAS TODAY.

163
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,731
THEY SAY THIS IS NOT THE PLACE 

164
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,233
OR TIME FOR POLITICAL DEBATE.

165
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,768
SURELY THIS IS A QUESTION THAT 

166
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,003
WILL CONTINUE TO COME BACK AT 

167
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,072
THIS WHITE HOUSE.

168
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,275
I ALSO ASKED SARAH SANDERS IF HE

169
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:28,012
CONSIDERS IT AN ACT OF DOMESTIC 

170
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:28,312
TERRORISM.

171
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,915
THEY SAY IT IS PREMATURE.

172
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,884
THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT FOR 

173
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,285
