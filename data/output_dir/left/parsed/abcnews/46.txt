INTRADAY. 
>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR WITH 
NEWS FROM WALL STREET.
WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE FLOOR OF
THE STOCK EXCHANGE.
THE DOW DOWN MORE THAN 1,000 
POINTS COMING ON TOP OF A MORE 
THAN 600 POINT LOSS ON FRIDAY.
THAT PUTS THE DOW DOW IN NEGATI 
TERRITORY FOR THIS YEAR, DOWN A 
LITTLE MORE THAN 4% RIGHT NOW.
OF COURSE THIS COMES ON TOP OF A
HEALTHY GAIN IN THE STOCK 
EXCHANGE OVER THE LAST YEAR.
IT YOU LOOK BACK TO WHEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED 
IN JANUARY 2017 THE DOW BELOW 
20,000 NOW ABOUT 24,000, SO 
CLOSE TO A 25% RISE SINCE 2017.
BUT IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH DAY ON 
WALL STREET RIGHT NOW AS WE 
APPROACH THE CLOSING BELL, THE 
DOW CONTINUES TO DROP, NOW DOWN 
ABOUT 1100 POINTS.
I'M HERE WITH OUR CHIEF BUSINESS
CORRESPONDENT.
THIS WOULD BE THE LARGEST POINT 
DROP EVER IN DOW HISTORY BUT FAR
FROM THE WORST DAY. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IN POINT 
TERMS WE WILL CLOSE SOMEWHERE 
DOWN ABOUT 1100 POINTS TODAY.
THAT'S SIZABLE BUT NOWHERE NEAR 
AS BAD AS IT WAS SEPTEMBER 9th, 
2008, WHEN THE DOW FELL 777 
POINTS, A NEAR 7% FALL THAT DAY.
WE'VE JUST COME A LOT FARTHER 
SINCE THEN.
THAT'S WHY THE PERCENTAGE TERMS 
TODAY ARE STILL DOWN 4.6% BUT 
NOT AS BAD AS THEN. 
>> THE FAMOUS BLACK MONDAY IN 
1987 WHERE THE DOW DROPPED MORE 
THAN 20%.
AT ONE POINT THE DOW WAS DOWN 
1600 POINTS, EVEN WORSE. 
>> IT WAS LOOKING LIKE WE COULD 
BE IN THAT NEGATIVE 7% TERRITORY
SO WE'VE COME UP FROM THERE.
BUT GEORGE, AS WE WERE SPEAKING 
ABOUT EARLIER THERE WERE A 
NUMBER OF VETERANS ON WALL 
STREET WHO HAVE BEEN FEELING 
LIKE SOMETHING IS COMING, THAT 
THIS IS MEANT TO BE, THAT 
SOMETHING -- WE WERE GOING TO 
SEE A SELL-OFF LIKE THIS AT SOME
POINT IN TIME GIVEN HOW FAR 
STOCKS HAVE COME IN THE LAST 
YEAR, UP 22% IN THE LAST YEAR. 
>> RIGHT.
BUT THE ECONOMY STILL QUITE 
STRONG.
>> THE JOBS REPORT ON FRIDAY, 
200,000 JOBS WERE ADDED, THE 
WAGE GAINS ARE HAPPENING AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE WAITING ON, 
THOSE WAGE GAINS AND SOME OF 
THAT ACTUALLY CAN HAVE A 
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THIS MARKET 
BECAUSE AS WAGES AND JOBS 
IMPROVE, IT GIVES MORE REASON 
FOR THE FED TO HIKE INTEREST 
RATES WHICH CAN WEIGH ON STOCKS.
>> WE'VE HAD THE CLOSING BELL.
DOWN ABOUT 1178 POINTS.
IT WILL SETTLE A FEW MORE 
MINUTES.
MORE THAN 4% LOSS ON TOP OF A 
600 POINT DROP ON FRIDAY.
THAT HAS WIPED OUT THE GAINS IN 
THE DOW FOR THE YEAR.
REBECCA WILL BE JOINING DAVID 
MUIR ON "WORLD NEWS."
