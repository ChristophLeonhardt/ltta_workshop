1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:01,652
WEST VIRGINIA.

2
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:02,819
LEADING THE COUNTRY IN A LOT OF

3
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,088
WAYS TO STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE

4
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,124
BELIEVE IS WEST VIRGINIANS.

5
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,092
>> Bret: CONGRESSMAN,

6
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:09,459
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:11,328
>> Martha: MR. BLANKENSHIP,

8
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:13,797
YOU WERE IMPRISONED ON A

9
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:15,465
CONVICTION IN THE MINE EXPLOSION

10
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,534
CASE, YOU HAVE BLAMED THE OBAMA

11
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,069
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT

12
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:20,437
ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON COAL,

13
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,838
BUT TOO MANY OF THESE MINING

14
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:23,607
FAMILIES DID BLAME YOU.

15
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,676
CAN YOU BLAME THEM IF THEY DO

16
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,445
NOT THINK THAT IT IS RIGHT FOR

17
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,980
YOU TO GO FROM THE JAIL CELL TO

18
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,781
THE UNITED STATES SENATE?

19
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,982
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT IS A

20
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:33,083
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO BE

21
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:33,416
ASKING.

22
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,751
TO THE QUESTION WE NEED TO BE

23
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,853
ASKING IS WHETHER WE CAN PREVENT

24
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,188
A BIG BRANCH FROM HAPPENING

25
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:39,022
AGAIN.

26
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:40,824
AT THIS TIME AND HAVE THEM

27
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:42,425
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IT

28
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:44,828
IN HALF AND FINISHED ALMOST

29
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,530
EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THERE WAS

30
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,465
EXISTENCE FOR 17 YEARS EXPLODED.

31
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,566
BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT

32
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:50,767
BLAME ME, THEY BLAME THE COAL

33
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:53,336
MINERS WERE NOT DOING THEIR JOB,

34
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:56,239
WHICH WAS TERRIBLY UNTRUE.

35
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,674
NEARLY 400 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,

36
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:58,642
THEY DID THEIR JOB.

37
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,277
AND I PLEA BARGAIN DURING THE

38
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:01,311
TRIAL, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN

39
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,746
AMAZING THAT THE MINERS DID NOT

40
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:06,650
DO THEIR JOB, I CANNOT DO THAT.

41
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,551
FACING 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A

42
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:10,053
FIXED CHARGE, AND I BEAT ALL

43
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,454
THREE OF THE FELONY IS, THEY PUT

44
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:12,923
ME IN JAIL, BECAUSE I DID NOT

45
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,926
STOP THE COAL MINERS FROM

46
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:17,460
TELLING EACH OTHER THAT THE

47
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,228
INSPECTORS HAD ARRIVED.

48
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,397
THAT IS NOT A LAW THAT IS ON THE

49
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:21,198
BOOKS.

50
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,799
THAT IS A LAW THAT THE OBAMA

51
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,634
PROSECUTORS MADE UP IN

52
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:26,837
REPARATION FOR THE TRIAL.

53
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,639
THE TRIAL WAS VIOLATED OF A

54
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:30,407
PERSON'S HUMAN RIGHTS TO A FAIR

55
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:30,707
TRIAL.

56
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,710
TODAY DID THINGS LIKE IN ORDER

57
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,212
TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE THAT

58
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:36,580
THEY HAD TO GIVE THE DOCUMENTS

59
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,048
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE AT

60
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,916
TRIAL, THEY GAVE US 1 MILLION

61
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,851
AND A HALF DOCUMENTS AND SAID

62
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,987
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO USE THE

63
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,222
DOCUMENTS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

64
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,656
IT IS INCREDIBLE.

65
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:47,858
THEY SENT ME IMPRISONED FOR A

66
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,260
MISDEMEANOR, I WAS THE ONLY

67
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,127
PRISONER THAT WAS A MISDEMEANOR.

68
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:52,262
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING

69
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,864
TO THE END THAT IT WAS A FAKE

70
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,265
PROSECUTION.

71
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:56,733
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

72
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:57,967
THOSE THAT SAY THAT YOU HAVE

73
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:59,469
MADE IT ABOUT YOU?

74
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:00,737
DO YOU ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY

75
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:03,306
FOR THE DEATHS OF THOSE 29

76
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:03,873
MINERS?

77
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,209
>> I AM ACCEPTING THE

78
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:06,976
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING

79
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,044
I CAN TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING

80
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:09,445
AGAIN.

81
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,347
THE GOVERNMENT CUTS IT IN HALF.

82
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,982
THE JOB WAS FINISHED EIGHT HOURS

83
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:13,850
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION.

84
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,651
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN SAY

85
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:15,451
ABOUT IT.

86
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,287
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE

87
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,088
ATMOSPHERE NO MATTER WHETHER YOU

88
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:22,458
HAVE SHARP BIDS, DOLE BEDS, PLUG

89
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,994
WATER SPRAYS, NO SPRAYS COMING

90
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,429
HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE

91
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:26,829
ATMOSPHERE.

92
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,531
TO THE WAY YOU PREVENT IT IS A

93
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:31,301
LOT OF AIRFLOW, AND THESE GUYS

94
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,835
THEY DO THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO

95
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,070
MAKE THAT CHANGE.

96
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,771
THEY SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THEM

97
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,873
AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

98
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:37,574
>> Martha: WHY DID YOU INSIST

99
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,475
THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE THAT

100
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:39,842
CHANGE?

101
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,110
>> BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT

102
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,879
THEY WERE MAKING THE CHANGE.

103
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,214
WHEN YOU HAVE 119 COAL MINES, IT

104
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:45,949
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH

105
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,619
WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING.

106
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:53,389
WE NEED TO BRING IT TO A

107
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,090
REGULATORY INSPECTOR GROUP AND

108
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,858
INVESTIGATIVE GROUP LIKE THE NTS

109
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:59,929
IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WHEN

110
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,831
YOU USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE

111
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:02,999
MINES TO CONTROL THE ATMOSPHERE.

112
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,368
WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A RELIEF

113
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,102
VALVE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS

114
00:03:06,102 --> 00:00:00,000
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU
