1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,389
PERHAPS THINGS NEED TO BE

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,491
DECLASSIFIED IN A MORE

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,392
TRANSPARENT AND FAST FASHION

4
00:00:06,392 --> 00:00:07,193
THAN THEY ARE.

5
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:08,661
GUYS, THANKS SO MUCH.

6
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,997
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE TARGETED

7
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:13,799
FOR YOUR POLITICAL BELIEFS BY

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,101
THE FULL FORCE OF THE FEDERAL

9
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:15,501
GOVERNMENT?

10
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:21,474
WE'LL ASK THE MAN, DeSOUZA.

11
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:22,708
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US

12
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,042
TONIGHT.

13
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,578
THIS PARDON HAS SET OFF A

14
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:27,013
FIRESTORM OF FREAKOUTS AMONG

15
00:00:27,013 --> 00:00:31,350
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT.

16
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,352
AND TODAY WE HAD AN ESPECIALLY

17
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:36,389
BIG FREAKOUT FROM A FORMER OBAMA

18
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,056
U.S. ATTORNEY ON MSNBC THIS

19
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:40,393
MORNING.

20
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:40,926
LET'S WATCH.

21
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,862
>> IT CONCERNS ME NOT ONLY IS HE

22
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:44,230
VIOLATING THE NORMS OF NOT GOING

23
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,198
THROUGH THAT NORMAL PROCESS, BUT

24
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:48,968
IS HE PAINTING A NARRATIVE THAT

25
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:51,003
SENSITIZES THE PUBLIC THAT THE

26
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,471
GOVERNMENT IS OFTEN UNFAIR TO

27
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:52,805
PEOPLE.

28
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:54,940
WHICH I THINK HAS LONG-TERM

29
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,575
DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES TO THE

30
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:57,610
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

31
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,680
>> THE LEFT HAS FREAKED OUT MORE

32
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,316
OVER MY PARDON THAN MAYBE ANY

33
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:05,618
OTHER.

34
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:07,520
I WAS WATCHING SOMETHING ON CNN,

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,488
I THINK IT WAS EARLIER TODAY, OR

36
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:10,756
YESTERDAY, THESE THINGS BECOME A

37
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:12,358
BLUR, AND THEY WERE SAYING HOW

38
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,694
DANGEROUS IT IS THAT I GOT THIS

39
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:15,027
PARDON.

40
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:16,662
AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT, AND

41
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:18,497
IT OCCURRED TO ME, I THINK I

42
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,433
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING AT.

43
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,834
IT'S DANGEROUS TO THEM.

44
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,669
IT'S DANGEROUS TO THEIR

45
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,104
IDEOLOGY, AND DANGEROUS IN A WAY

46
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:26,939
THAT OTHER PARDONS -- THINK OF

47
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,974
THE CLINTON PARDON OF MARK RICH.

48
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:32,011
YOU'VE GOT A GUY HERE WHO'S AN

49
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,014
INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADER AND

50
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:37,216
POSSIBLY A TAX FRAUD, INVOLVED

51
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:38,884
IN ALL KINDS OF RACKETS.

52
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,820
BUT HE'S NOT DANGEROUS TO THE

53
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,487
IDEOLOGY AT CNN.

54
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:46,158
IN FACT, HE HELPS TO SUPPORT

55
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,593
PROGRESSIVE CAUSES, HE GIVES

56
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:49,829
MONEY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION.

57
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,697
I, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A

58
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,032
NONWHITE IMMIGRANT WHO CAME TO

59
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:54,667
AMERICA WITH $500 IN MY POCKET.

60
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,836
AND I'VE BEEN EXPOSING THE WHOLE

61
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:57,737
PROGRESSIVE IDEOLOGY.

62
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,371
SO I'M DANGEROUS IN THAT WAY.

63
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,973
THEY'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

64
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:03,542
>> Laura: JOHN AVALON ON CNN

65
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:06,812
TODAY WAS, AGAIN, THE MEDIA, THE

66
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,782
DEMOCRATS, THE NEVER-TRUMPERS,

67
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,150
THEY'RE ALL QUESTIONING WHY THIS

68
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,517
OCCURRED.

69
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:12,952
AND LET'S WATCH.

70
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:14,553
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS?

71
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:16,188
>> I THINK YOU SEE THIS AS THE

72
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,957
POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY MEANS A

73
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,492
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD.

74
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:22,161
THIS IS ALSO WHO'S BEEN A

75
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:23,095
SELF-STYLED CONSERVATIVE

76
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,296
INTELLECTUAL WHO HAS BEEN A

77
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:25,231
TWITTER TROLL FOR A LONG PERIOD

78
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,933
OF TIME RIGHT NOW, APPEALING TO

79
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,470
ALL THE WORST INSTINCTS AND

80
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,404
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

81
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:34,406
>> I'VE NEVER ALLEGED ANY

82
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:35,141
CONSPIRACY OF ANYONE.

83
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,577
WHAT I'VE DONE IS EXPOSED THE

84
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:39,812
SORDID HISTORY OF THE DEMOCRATIC

85
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:42,414
PARTY, A HISTORY THAT ACTUALLY

86
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:43,749
CONTINUES TO THE PRESENT.

87
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:45,785
I'VE ALSO EXPOSED A LOT ABOUT

88
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:46,085
OBAMA.

89
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,620
OBAMA WOULD NOT HAVE INDICTED ME

90
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,421
IF I DIDN'T MAKE A FILM THAT

91
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,523
DEEPLY UPSET HIM.

92
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:52,558
I DIDN'T JUST GO AGAINST HIS

93
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,161
IDEOLOGY, I KIND OF GOT INTO HIS

94
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:55,461
HEAD.

95
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:56,862
AND SOMETIMES WHEN I SPEAK ON

96
00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:59,064
CAMPUS, PEOPLE GO, WELL, GEE,

97
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,333
DIN ESH, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

98
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,035
OBAMA SAW YOUR DUMB MOVIE OR

99
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,170
CARES ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO

100
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,436
SAY.

101
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,805
THE REASON I THINK THAT IS

102
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:07,606
BECAUSE HE WAS ATTACKING ME ON

103
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:12,011
HIS PERSONAL WEBSITE

104
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:12,478
BARACKOBAMA.COM.

105
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:12,912
THERE YOU GO.

106
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:16,415
THIS IS A NARCISSISTIC PRESIDENT

107
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:19,018
WHO RECRUITED ERIC HOLDER TO

108
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,020
CARRY HIS WATER FOR HIM, TO GO

109
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,055
AFTER ME.

110
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:27,293
>> Laura: CNN SUBSCRIBED TO THE

111
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,995
LIBERAL IDEOLOGY, DINESH.

112
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,097
THEIR POINT IS PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

113
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:35,868
AND PEOPLE LIKE ME, WE'RE

114
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:36,368
ALT-RIGHT.

115
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,770
YOU'RE NOT A CONSERVATIVE AND

116
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,238
YOU'RE NOT WINNING IN THE ARENA

117
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:42,708
OF IDEAS, YOU'RE ALT-RIGHT, OR

118
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,777
YOU'RE XENOPHOBIC, AND I LOVE IT

119
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:46,545
WHEN THEY CALL YOU RACIST,

120
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:47,413
THAT'S ALWAYS FUN.

121
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:49,381
IT'S A WAY TO AVOID AN ARGUMENT,

122
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,082
A DEBATE.

123
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,851
WE SAW THIS GOING BACK TO

124
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,420
COLLEGE, DINESH AND I WENT TO

125
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,855
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE TOGETHER, WAY

126
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:57,089
BACK BEFORE THEY CALLED IT

127
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:57,923
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

128
00:03:57,923 --> 00:03:59,725
THEY WERE TRYING TO AVOID THE

129
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:01,794
FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE ABOUT THE

130
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,829
GREATNESS OF WESTERN

131
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,397
CIVILIZATION, HOW OFF-TRACK THEY

132
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:08,467
HAVE BEEN ON SO MANY ISSUES, THE

133
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,502
DECLINE OF TRUE INTELLECTUAL

134
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:11,737
THOUGHT AND DIVERSITY OF

135
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:12,071
THOUGHT.

136
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,105
THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT DEBATE,

137
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:16,175
THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE

138
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,110
DEBATE IN LINE WITH, FRANKLY,

139
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,378
WANTING TO SHUT YOU DOWN, OR

140
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:19,778
THIS SHOW.

141
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:21,714
>> HERE'S A TINY DETAIL ABOUT MY

142
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,148
CASE THAT'S SO REVEALING.

143
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:26,051
THIS CLINTON APPOINTEE JUDGE WHO

144
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,920
ADJUDICATED THE CASE, SAYING

145
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,288
THERE'S NO POLITICAL TARGETING

146
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:31,056
HERE, AS PART OF MY SENTENCE HE

147
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,292
SENTENCES ME TO MANDATORY

148
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,159
PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELING.

149
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,694
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A

150
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:36,028
MINUTE.

151
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:36,996
WHAT ABOUT MY CASE?

152
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,530
HERE I'VE GIVEN TOO MUCH MONEY,

153
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,733
MY OWN MONEY, TO A CANDIDATE, A

154
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,903
COLLEGE FRIEND OF MINE RUNNING

155
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:44,470
DAHMER.

156
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,605
I DIDN'T PUT BODIES IN THE

157
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:47,039
REFRIGERATOR.

158
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,109
WHY DO I NEED PSYCHIATRIC

159
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:50,509
COUNSELING?

160
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:51,810
IF NOT THAT IT'S THE PROGRESSIVE

161
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,913
VIEW THAT I'M NOT JUST WRONG,

162
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:55,614
BUT I'M SOMEHOW CRAZY?

163
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,850
THAT PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH

164
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,952
THEM REQUIRE NOT PERSUASION, BUT

165
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:00,286
THERAPY.

166
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:02,488
AND SO THIS IS THE KIND OF

167
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:03,322
REEDUCATION PROJECT THAT WAS

168
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:06,225
ATTEMPTED ON ME, AND FINALLY THE

169
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,293
JUDGE BECAME SUPER FRUSTRATED

170
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,028
AND THREW UP HIS HANDS AND

171
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:10,362
BASICALLY SAID THE REEDUCATION

172
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:13,198
HAS FAILED, THIS MAN CANNOT BE

173
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:16,635
PSYCHOLOGICALLY REHABILITATED,

174
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,671
WHICH I TOOK AS A GREAT

175
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,071
COMPLIMENT.

176
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:19,838
>> Laura: MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE

177
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,974
PUT YOU UP ON THE RACK, AND

178
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:22,741
WATERBOARDED YOU.

179
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,476
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENHANCED

180
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:25,377
INTERROGATION THEY WOULD HAVE

181
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,478
SUPPORTED ON THE LEFT.

182
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,280
I ALSO WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS

183
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,982
ON COMMENTS MADE TONIGHT BY

184
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,550
STEVE BANNON, FEATURED TONIGHT

185
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,084
ON CNN.

186
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,520
HE SEEMS TO BE REENTERING THE

187
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,921
PUBLIC ARENA, HE'S BEEN OVER

188
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,223
THERE IN ITALY, MAYBE WORKING ON

189
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:40,392
THAT POPULOUS MOVEMENT OVER

190
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:40,693
THERE.

191
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,061
HE SAID THIS ABOUT THE MULLER

192
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:42,528
INVESTIGATION.

193
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,297
>> I'VE BEEN A BIG PROPONENT --

194
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:47,099
I SAID, DON'T FIRE COMEY.

195
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,735
I'VE SAID, HE'S A COMBAT PLA

196
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:50,035
REIN.

197
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:51,470
THAT OUGHT TO PLAY OUT AS IT'S

198
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,305
GOING TO PLAY OUT.

199
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,573
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

200
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:55,140
MAKE OF IT.

201
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,176
I WILL SAY THAT ACTUALLY MUELLER

202
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:00,612
WAS THE HEAD OF THE FBI WHEN MY

203
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,481
CASE FIRST SURFACED.

204
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,149
AND THE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT

205
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,250
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN TRYING FOR A

206
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,787
WHILE TO GET MY FBI FILE, AND

207
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:09,154
COULDN'T.

208
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:11,323
AND THEN FINALLY THEY GOT IT

209
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:12,992
REDACTED, BUT IN IT, IT

210
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:15,060
IDENTIFIES ME AS A PROMINENT

211
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,794
CRITIC OF OBAMA.

212
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,830
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY

213
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,531
INTERESTING, BECAUSE WHY IS THAT

214
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,733
IN MY FILE?

215
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,434
IF THIS IS A CASE OF LADY

216
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,503
JUSTICE BEING BLIND,

217
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:26,438
INVESTIGATING A CAMPAIGN

218
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,240
VIOLATION, WHY HIGHLIGHT MY

219
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,607
POLITICS.

220
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,642
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE MUELLER

221
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,511
FBI IS SIGNALING TO THE JUSTICE

222
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,813
DEPARTMENT, THE HOLDER JUSTICE

223
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:36,515
DEPARTMENT, HERE IS A GUY WHO'S

224
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,050
ONE OF YOUR POLITICAL ENEMIES,

225
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,285
HERE IS A GUY YOU MAY WANT TO GO

226
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:40,586
AFTER.

227
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:41,920
THIS IS WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING

228
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,755
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

229
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,056
THIS IS WHAT MAKES PEOPLE LIKE

230
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:45,624
ME DANGEROUS TO THEM.

231
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:47,559
THIS IS WHY I'M NOT AN ORDINARY

232
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,861
CONSERVATIVE, BUT SOMEBODY WHO

233
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:49,762
ULTIMATELY THEY WOULD LIKE TO

234
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:50,562
SEE LOCKED UP.

235
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:54,366
>> Laura: WELL, THEY'VE SEEN,

236
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:56,101
AND THEY'VE TRIED TO SILENCE

237
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:56,969
CONSERVATIVES BEFORE.

238
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,303
AGAIN, GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO

239
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,438
COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

240
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:00,839
THEY SHUT DOWN SPEAKERS.

241
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,975
YOU'VE HAD PROBLEMS ON COLLEGE

242
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:04,076
CAMPUSES.

243
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,144
OBVIOUSLY ANN COULTER, WE'LL

244
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:07,046
TALK TO HER IN A SHORT WHILE,

245
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:08,247
SHE'S HAD PROBLEMS.

246
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,382
EVEN BEING ABLE TO SPEAK,

247
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,451
PHYSICALLY BEING ALLOWED TO

248
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,086
SPEAK AND PARTICIPATE.

249
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:18,223
NOW IN THE OBAMA ERA, DINESH,

250
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:21,360
THAT WAS USED AS A TACTIC,

251
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,262
INTIMIDATION, FOLLOWING FOX NEWS

252
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:26,131
REPORTER CHERYL ATKINSON, HER

253
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,166
COMPUTER WAS BROKEN INTO.

254
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,234
THESE ARE INTIMIDATION TACTICS

255
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,638
THAT GO BEYOND THE STUFF THAT

256
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,073
WE'D NORMALLY THINK OF.

257
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,741
WE TALK ABOUT RUSSIA, BUT

258
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,177
THEY'RE ADOPTING THE TACTICS OF

259
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:40,779
THE OLD SOVIET UNION.

260
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,548
>> THERE'S A DEEP LEVEL OF LYING

261
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:44,016
AND DECEPTION THAT GOES ON HERE.

262
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,918
YOU KNOW THAT BOTH OBAMA AND

263
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,290
HILLARY WERE THE DISCIPLES OF

264
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:51,690
SOLYNNSKY.

265
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,591
>> Laura: WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

266
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,727
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS IT'S MOVING

267
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:56,795
FARTHER AND FARTHER LEFTWARD?

268
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:59,198
>> TO ME, THE PARTY IS IN MANY

269
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:00,933
RESPECTS ROTTEN TO THE CORE.

270
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,768
AND WHAT'S REALLY HOLDING IT UP

271
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,504
IS NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

272
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,072
ITSELF, BUT BUT ITS OWN WEIGHT

273
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:08,373
IT WOULD COLLAPSE.

274
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,375
IT'S SUSTAINED BY A KIND OF

275
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,910
OUTSIDE ALLIANCE INVOLVING

276
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,712
PEOPLE IN ACADEMIA, THE LEFT IN

277
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:16,281
THE MEDIA, AND THE LEFT IN THE

278
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,382
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

279
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:21,653
THE LEFT CONTROLS THESE THREE

280
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:22,921
MEGAPHONES OF OUR CULTURE, AND

281
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,790
THEY CAN PUT OUT LIES AND

282
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,557
DISINFORMATION AS LONG AS THAT

283
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:26,158
CONTINUES.

284
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:28,160
THEY'RE WHAT'S HOLDING UP THE

285
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,661
DEMOCRATIC PARTY RIGHT NOW.

286
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:32,831
THEY'RE THE COVER-UP ARTISTS FOR

287
00:08:32,831 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS PARTY.
