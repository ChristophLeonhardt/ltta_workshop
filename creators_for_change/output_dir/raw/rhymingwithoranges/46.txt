on the 21 trillion dollars which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,320
hidden from national taxes good now I

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,420
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 trillion is a very big</font>

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,090
number there is scary but just to put it

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">into context that hopefully you guys</font>

25
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,320

these evil politicians we've also seen

actually to be fair does give Camryn so

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,579
much needed street cred now I should be

56
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,440
clear there

57
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,450
nothing illegal about setting up and

58
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,389
running an offshore account yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

59
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,669
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't pay taxes in the country</font>

60
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,150
where you live and work but I hear that

61
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,190
there are lots of reasons why you would

62
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,810
legitimately set up an offshore account

63
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,740
other than tax avoidance have apparently

64
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be honest I did my degree in Modern</font>

65

explaining what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> almada bad</font>

67

films will you be in but I know next to

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,420
nothing about economics so I'm just

69
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave some links downstairs in</font>

70
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,540
the doobly-doo and you guys can do the

71
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,040
reading and then summarize what you

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,570
found in the comments below does that

73
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,690
sound good yes excellent teamwork that

74
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,700
said offshore accounts are politically

75
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,590
used to avoid tax in the country where

76
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do business and where you reside</font>

77
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,920
which is a bit of a slap in the face for

78
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,010
the rest of us who paying money to like

79
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,650
the fire services the health care and

80
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roads that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helped a country you know</font>

81
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,530
function bless him david hasn't dealt

82
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,750
with these revelations very well he

83
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,190
initially basically told us all to

84
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,950
bugger off because taxation is a private

85
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,350
matter he then later on after we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all got</font>

86
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,400
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit pissed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off with that</font>

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,680
response said that oh no my family

88
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,590
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't profit from offshore</font>

89
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,959
accounts to be fair is true because he

90
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,640
sold the last of his shares in<font color="#CCCCCC"> blairmore</font>

91
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">holdings in 2010 before he became prime</font>

92
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,709
minister so Oh fine right when pushed

93
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,540
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. Cameron said that his family</font>

94
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,130
wouldn't profit from offshore accounts

95
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,010
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future to which the rest of the</font>

96
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,130
UK kind of went hmm so the private

aren't know really David really really

105
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,769
been King the protest and I kind of love

106
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">aunty Cameron protests nowadays because</font>

107
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,290
they all revolve around<font color="#CCCCCC"> pic symbolism</font>

108
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,430
because of that thing he definitely

109
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,100
didn't do now I didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the</font>

110
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,680

<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font>

112
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,750
men managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get these images in this</font>

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,840
video and it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of fun</font>

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,180
stuff hammer said with a solemn face

115
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,769
that he wished that he dealt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,690
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing a little bit better which</font>

117
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,260
yeah yeah he probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have but the</font>

118
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,700
thing is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he really</font>

119
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,250
understands why people are pissed off

120
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,410
about this the issue is that and I think

121
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can agree that tax avoidance is</font>

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,169
immoral David Cameron himself said back

in twenty twelve<font color="#E5E5E5"> when commenting on tax</font>

can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> that commented on in 2012</font>

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,110

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,720
offshore accounts are immoral and not

130
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,490
illegal shouldn't it be the government's

131
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,180
job to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> them all illegal and then we</font>

132
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,880
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cameron who he himself has profited</font>

of this is impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not at least</font>

138
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,990
question whether his like a willingness

139

to change a phenomenon that cheats the

held responsible for the financial
