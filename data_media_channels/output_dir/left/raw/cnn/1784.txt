as Hillary Clinton was toasted with
cheers for her new book she roasted

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,610
Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the
grave offense called manspreading

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,190
men spreading the practice whereby a man
adopts a sitting position with his legs

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,320
wide apart he would man spread and there
are plenty of pictures to prove it

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,130
though it could have been worse do you
think maybe you could close your legs a

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:34,559
bit no I'm good now we already knew
about Putin's provocative posture he's

7
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,520
got that kind of slouch
looking like the bored kid in the back

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,230
of the classroom Hillary has also said
Putin wouldn't look at her and of his

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,899
manspreading she wrote it was as if to
say I take what I want and I have so

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,949
little respect for you that I'm going to
act as if I'm at home lounging in my

11
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,070
bathrobe big surprise after all Putin is
used to lounging in public bare chested

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,709
and he seems to man spread with everyone
actually many male leaders from

13
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,170
President Trump to Israel's prime
minister man spread right back Hillary

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,820
didn't just call Putin out
she acted it out every time I met with

15
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:22,560
him it would be but in her attempt to
mimic me and spreading she spread only

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:31,430
her arms too modest a man spread all the
way oh for god sakes
