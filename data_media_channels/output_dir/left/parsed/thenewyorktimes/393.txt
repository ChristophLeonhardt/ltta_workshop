Beloit is an old Rust Belt 
manufacturing community
that just did some spectacular 
things for many, many years.
But the transition, like
many other Rust Belt communities,
started as technology — started 
to change and manufacturing
started going overseas.
Ultimately we looked at Ironworks
here as a great kind of a canvas 
to take a very, very old building and
transform into something that 
could be used in today’s world
with most notably technology.
The evolution didn’t just happen 
overnight, and it’s kind of like,
which comes first, the chicken 
or the egg, and we’re trying
to figure out how we could 
reinvent this.
Because again, what comes first, 
do you get the businesses
and then hope the people come, 
do you try with your existing
businesses to get more 
excitement somehow?
