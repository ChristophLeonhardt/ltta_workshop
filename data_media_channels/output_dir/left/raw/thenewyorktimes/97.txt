00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,679
Alex Jones is the internet's most notorious conspiracy theorist and with his site Infowars

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,370
He's peddled a number of dark and bizarre conspiracy theories, Sandy Hook

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,110
It's got inside job written all over this cover pitch gate. We have covered it

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,240
We are covering it and all I know is god help us

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,629
We're in the hands of pure evil after weeks of criticism YouTube

6
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:25,559
Facebook Apple and Spotify all acted to essentially erase many of his videos and posts from their services

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,969
In many cases the companies are saying he violated their terms regarding hate speech and a number of other rules

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:40,379
Alex Jones today and his show dedicated nearly all four hours to what he called censorship of his platform and President Trump

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,410
the Republican Congress the state houses

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,260
independent media all leader rally together

11
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,239
against this global move to censor America and the planet and this is something that he

12
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:55,559
Essentially has been warning his followers of because it was sort of ticky tacky

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,959
Enforcement for several weeks and he sort of saw this coming. This is the internet purge people

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,159
I think for those who have tracked the social media policies by some of these big tech firms

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:12,659
today was a significant moment because these tech companies have really struggled with this dilemma of wanting to

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:20,189
Combat misinformation online, but at the same time not wanting to become arbiters of truth. Can you define hate speech?

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,540
Senator I think that this is a really hard question

18
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,909
And I think it's one of the reasons why we struggle with it for months and really for years

19
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,289
The tech companies have been reluctant to weigh in on a lot of these controversial speech issues

20
00:01:34,570 --> 00:00:00,000
But it appears after months of criticism. The tech companies have finally said in the case of Alex Jones that enough is enough
