NASCAR. HOT ON THEIR HEELS IS 14-YEAR-OLD. HE IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE YET HE IS ONLY 14. RACING PROTEGEE JOINS US TO SHARE HIS AMAZING STORY. TELL US YOUR STORY. WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU GOT INTO A CAR AND REALIZED THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. IT STARTED AT NASSAU COLISEUM IN LITTLE GO-CART. AS SOON AS I GOT BEHIND THAT WHEEL OF THAT GO-CART I KNEW I WANTED TO DO THIS FOR MY LIFETIME. GRIFF: WHEN I WAS 14 I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO EQUIPS MY PARENTS I WOULD LOVE TO RACE NASCAR. HOW DID YOUR PARENTS ALLOW YOU TO DO THIS? MY GRANDPA BUILDS HOT RODS AND ALL THESE RACE CARS AND STUFF. AND HE TUNED FOR VERY FAMOUS PEOPLE IN NASCAR. IT'S REALLY BEEN IN MY BLOOD. MY FAMILY JUST ALLOWED ME TO DO IT AND I CAN'T THANK THEM ENOUGH BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE MY HEART IS. ABBY: WHAT DO BIG TIME RACERS SAY TO YOU WHEN THEY SEE YOU ON THE TRACK, 14 YEARS OLD AS GOOD AS YOU ARE. NEXT SENSATION AS MANY PEOPLE DESCRIBE YOU. WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY TO YOU. THEY ARE REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THESE CARS. BUT I HAVE THE TALENT AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO RESPECT THE VETERANS BECAUSE ONCE YOU GAIN THEIR RESPECT, THEY WILL RACE YOU CLEAN. AND YOU WILL DO A LOT BETTER. AND HAVE REALLY GOOD RACES. GRIFF: HOW FAST DOES THIS GO? 130 TO 150 MILES PER HOUR. ABBY: WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING BEHIND THE WHEEL HERE LIKE YOU HAVE SO MUCH ADRENALINE GOING THROUGH YOU WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING? YEAH. LIKE YOU GET TO THE CORNER AND YOU FEEL ALL THOSE G FORCES BEING ON YOU. AND IT'S JUST THAT FEELING THAT YOU CAN'T GET GET OUT OF ANYTHING ELSE. GRIFF: WHAT IS YOUR GOAL? LIFE? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? IS IT TO WIN AT ALL? YEAH. MY GOAL IS TO BE MONSTER ENERGY NASCAR CUB SERIES. JUST TO BE UP THERE WITH THOSE BIG GUYS. I REALLY HAVE MY HEART IN THIS. AND I GAVE IT ALL I HAVE GOT. AND IF I GET OUT OF THIS, I GAVE IT ALL I GOT AND THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT MATTERS. ABBY: FINDING YOUR PASSION AT 14 IS INCREDIBLE. I KNOW YOUR MOM IS PROBABLY SO PROUD AND NERVOUS AT THE SAME TIME SHE IS OVER HERE ON THE PLAZA. YOU RAISED AN AMAZING SON AND GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY. GOOD LUCK TO YOU AGREE VAN GUY V
