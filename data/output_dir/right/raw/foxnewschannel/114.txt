00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:17,061

00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:17,428
VANISHED.

00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:18,262
THE FRONT DOOR WAS EITHER

10
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,397
KICKED OR SHOT IN.

POLICE.

18
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,343
SO FAR NO PIECE OF INFORMATION

19
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:35,679
TO SUGGEST ANYONE WOULD WANT TO

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,081
KILL THEM.

21
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:38,215
YESTERDAY LAW ENFORCEMENT

THE SHERIFF HAS SINCE POSTED

29
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,363
UNFORTUNATELY THAT SEARCH DID

00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:55,466
NOT YIELD ANYTHING OF

31
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:55,966
EVIDENTIARY VALUE.

32
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,334
LAW ENFORCEMENT TELLS US

00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,554
SHE IS STILL IN THE AREA AND

44
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:21,391

FOR ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

52
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:34,805
BUSINESS OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS

53
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:35,806
SAY INVESTIGATORS HAVE SHOWED

54
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,408
