Ooh!
Did you hear that feeding buzz?
That was fantastic.
Do you see them?
Wow!
Danielle Gustafson is something of a citizen scientist
Not a scientist per se, but someone who voluntarily
collects data, that’s necessary for the study
and conservation of species
She also leads people on walks
in New York’s Central Park
to observe and understand the only flying
mammal in the world:
Bats.
Did you also just know it was going to be bats?
That was going to be your thing?
Of course not.
Of course not.
Who picks bats?
You did.
Or maybe bats picked me.
Bats suffer from incredibly bad PR.
There are a lot of Dracula connotations
And vampire bat connotations
Well Batman seems like it actually does a few good
things for the bats,
except when they’re actually on screen.
Pretty much anything you wanna know about
bats and New York
it hasn’t been studied
Poor bats.
They’re so poorly studied.
The citizen scientist movement around bats
and other creatures
Is being lifted by a small audio technology company
called Wildlife Acoustics
We listen to birds, we listen to frogs
We listen to bats, we listen to whales
Our customers are on the front lines watching
major shifts with warming climates
and sort of the movement of species now finding
broader ranges
where they didn't use to have, and what effect
that has on the ecosystem.
Recently, they’ve turned their attention
on hobbyists and citizen scientists
The bat detectors that we have now
used to cost thousands and thousands of dollars,
and only professionals had them.
Wildlife Acoustics makes a range of listening
devices and apps for iOS and Android
Like Song Sleuth, a five dollar app that’s
like the Shazam for birdsong
And one of their recent releases, the Echo
Meter Touch 2,
is basically the Shazam for bats
For $179, you can plug in this little accessory,
hold it up to a night sky, and listen for bats
The free app that comes with them can identify
them based on the way they echolocate, because
all nine species of bats in New York 
echolocate in different ways.
And for that reason, did you know that’s
why they all have different ears, to catch
sonar in different ways?
Some bats are echo locating over 100 kilohertz
Or 150 kilohertz
So it’s way beyond our range of hearing,
and it’s way beyond most microphones and
electronics by design.
The device brings it down to a frequency that
the human ear can hear, and that’s how you know
when to look up
And as they get closer and closer to a prey
item, they start echolocating faster and faster
and in the very end, when they’re right
on top of the moth,
it sounds a little bit like somebody giving
you the raspberry
So it’s like tch-tch-tch-tch-tch
Plllfffffttt!!!
It’s incredibly cool.
So far there’s no public database where
citizen scientists can upload their data
Thought both Danielle, through her nonprofit
Bat Conservation International
And Wildlife Acoustics say it’s something
they want to create
I will also say I had kind of a dream to have
many people conducting bat walks
so kind of like it becoming a thing.
So just so you know it’s a thing in England
People over there figured out it’s kind
of fun to listen to bats, because once you’ve
done it, it’s kind of addictive.
It hasn’t exactly caught on but I’m thinking
this technology, the new technology,
mobile technology, could change everything.
