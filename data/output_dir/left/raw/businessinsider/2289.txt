1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,770
so studio wrote this very provocative

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,300
blog post the other day where you

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically wrote back and said look when</font>

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,379
I was in Little<font color="#CCCCCC"> League we didn't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,629
ice cream just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for losing you actually</font>

6
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">had to win before you got some success</font>

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,500
and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,060
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> world lots and lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,100
today are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simply congratulate or</font>

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,120
trying I think that's true I

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,170
congratulate<font color="#CCCCCC"> every entrepreneur for</font>

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,880
taking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk and actually starting</font>

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,980
something because it takes such

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,500
intestinal fortitude to leave a big

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,059
company job and start something from

16
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:37,220
scratch and go against all odds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,140
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> something but the truth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,730
matter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all of those companies</font>

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,620
should be started and not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

20
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies in fact a relatively small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub</font>

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">sector of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies should be</font>

22
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,750
funded and particularly funded by

23
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,940
venture capitalists and you've dealt

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a lot of successful companies over</font>

25
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,910
the years you probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> watched thousands</font>

26
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,040
more that have failed do you feel like

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the folks who ultimately are going to</font>

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,969
succeed have a sense of that that they

29
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,550
shouldn't just simply be rewarded for

30
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,899
the fortitude or that that's not all

31
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,309
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they actually need to</font>

32
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,649
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that well i think you know</font>

33
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,450
you can be psychically rewarded in that

34
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,770
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting something and it's good</font>

35
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,359
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but the truth of matter is in</font>

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,399
the end companies either work or they

37
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,499
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and if they work you're</font>

38
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:16,850
making money you're adding value to

39
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,369
society you're creating a either a

40
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,439
product or a service which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,869
helping people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's adding real</font>

42
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,670
value if you if you have a product that

43
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work in a company that fails</font>

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,149
you're causing a lot of pain you're

45
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,740
losing either your money you're losing

46
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,240
your investors money you're wasting your

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,219
time you're putting your family<font color="#CCCCCC"> at risk</font>

48
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,679
so in on the one hand i'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

49
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,749
torn because i'm impressed by every

50
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:39,799
entrepreneur that becomes an

51
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,569
entrepreneur and i love the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that</font>

52
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,639
every entrepreneur puts their you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

53
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,920
puts everything on the line to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,749
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from nothing but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i also know</font>

55
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:50,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if it turns out unsuccessfully it's</font>

56
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,009
a very bad thing so if certain people

57
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,840
should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be entrepreneurs i guess in</font>

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,459
the end what I'm saying is certain

59
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,380
people are entrepreneurs they have the

60
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,779
spirit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the judgment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

61
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,009
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what some people call the rat</font>

62
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,049
like cunning to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> something out of</font>

63
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,429
nothing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done and</font>

64
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:06,259
others just<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't they get pushed</font>

65
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,999
into being an entrepreneur because

66
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">either they they lost their job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or they</font>

67
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i remember back in 1999</font>

68
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,210
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had all these people leaving IBM and</font>

69
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,440
these very large companies to go work

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
for startups and they were not start up

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,090
people

72
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,440
they come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying well I was</font>

73
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,860
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> 225,000 dollars as you know an</font>

74
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,440
x-large company now I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to pay</font>

75
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
me two hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and twenty-five thousand</font>

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,190
dollars plus the equity and by the way I

77
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,349
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to be no risk and it just</font>

78
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,879
doesn't work that way it's all risk and

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,680
reward you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you take the risk</font>

80
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,940
and if it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you get their</font>

81
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,769
greater reward but the risk also<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

82
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,180
downside which is what the end of the

83
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,160
first ball will really showed and I

84
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,640
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just crystal clearly of</font>

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,260
people saying but now but how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

86
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,549
small companies how are they going to

87
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,440
get funded again and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

88
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,239
realize that the true entrepreneurs are

89
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,590
going to power through that as they did

90
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,870
in the bust but so when you look at

91
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,970
somebody who is going to succeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

92
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,709
you're evaluating entrepreneurs some of

93
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,440
them always sound incredibly grandiose

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,540
making these great<font color="#E5E5E5"> claims sometimes</font>

95
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,519
that's very successful others tend to be

96
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,560
total realists but they have a hard time

97
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,120
selling things I mean is there a

98
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,459
consistent theme that you see and the

99
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,510
type of entrepreneurs that you're

100
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the people that actually</font>

101
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">should and do have what it takes to do</font>

102
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,599
this I would say it's what I look for in

103
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,819
both entrepreneurs and in co-investors

104
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,500
is what I like to say is no naive tagged

105
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,690
right no not eat a also has<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to</font>

106
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,940
do with judgment<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so they're not</font>

107
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,680
naive about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business they're going</font>

108
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,720
to go into they're not naive about how

109
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">much money it's going to take they're</font>

110
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,780
not naive about how hard it is to build

111
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,639
they're not naive about you know where

112
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,109
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start it in and what</font>

113
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,579
it's actually going to take to get from

114
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,069
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute start up to large</font>

115
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,139
success and the risk inherent in that

116
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,670
fundamentally usually people that have

117
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,220
done it<font color="#CCCCCC"> before have a lot less night a</font>

118
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,450
about doing it again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

119
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that are really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pleasure to fund</font>

120
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,829
when you have to teach somebody and you

121
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,450
know teaching on your dollar on your

122
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">dime is very painful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it can be very</font>

123
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">very expensive as well and do you find</font>

124
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,329
that these entrepreneurs have the same

125
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,200
sense of realism with you and with their

126
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,599
employees or when they go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

127
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,859
shop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they talk to the employees</font>

128
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,569
about whipping them up and the chances

129
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,849
of success are they again as realistic

130
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,400
in that environment as they are with you

131
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,620
absolutely not you know to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

132
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,630
entrepreneur you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to force it will</font>

133
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,370
things through right to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

134
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,710
from nothing you have to push through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

135
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,960
wall and get something<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and a few</font>

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,090
things are true in start-up companies

137
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,830
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge risks that are being taken</font>

138
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,860
with customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's huge</font>

139
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,270
in effect with capital because you're

140
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">always running very very lean you're</font>

141
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,960
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of to the edge when you</font>

142
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,389
fund a round of capital right that round

143
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,009
is what's take you to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next valuation</font>

144
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,780
point and the closer you get to being

145
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,400
out of money theoretically the greater

146
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,199
evaluation you're creating and if you

147
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,659
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and raise money to too far away from</font>

148
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,039
that valuation point then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

149
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a step up or it may be a</font>

150
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,500
down round so you don't want to do that

151
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,750
but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get too close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot of</font>

152
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,939
unsystematic things can cause the timing

153
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,310
to get put off and the closer you get to

154
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">being out of money the more risky it is</font>

155
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,250
for your company and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

156
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,389
go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your company and say you know</font>

157
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,370
what guys I decided I'm going to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

158
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,080
of your jobs at risk and wait an extra

159
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,759
month until I start fundraising because

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get a slightly higher</font>

161
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:11,689
valuation you have to make judgment

162
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,159
calls and you have to go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

163
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,719
company if to be realistic you have to

164
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,400
tell your company when<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

165
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,050
working and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> things aren't working</font>

166
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,539
but certain things don't need to be in

167
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,460
their purview right the fact that you

168
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,930
have high confidence that you are going

169
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,060

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:28,729
that company going forward you don't

172
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,500
have to be so clear on the company and

173
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,449
explain to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> it specifically what</font>

174
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:33,860
you're doing with the cash and why

175
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,629
