the greatest love about parenting is that you are responsible for your kids I know that sounds crazy you think well who else would be responsible for them it looks up me but here's the question parents of teenagers are always frustrated with kids not taking responsibility for themselves not taking responsibility for their stuff well why should they take responsibility for themselves if you've always been taking responsibility for them it's what you're doing is saying look it's my job to get you to behave better it's not your job to get yourself to behave better it's my job because I'm responsible for you and that means I judge everything about myself as a parent is how well I get you to do something I need you to do and that always causes this incredible power struggle because we're dealing with something someone that has a mind of their own it's not my job to manage my kids behavior it's my job to help them learn to manage their own behavior which means I'm not responsible for them and the choices that they make I am responsible to them for the choices that I make because here's the truth I can't control any choices they make my child the minute old she's deciding what will and will not go into her mouth we know she's hungry but she's not eating I'm not deciding for her not to eat she's deciding that now it's not based on some decision tree algorithm right she's a minute old but I'm not making that decision I am is responsible to her for doing everything I need to do to put her in the best position possible to make a good choice what she does after that is up to her I'm not responsible for what another person does I am responsible for what I do and here's why that's great is I'm actually in control of that I can control how I behave and it's amazing when you stop trying to control how your children
