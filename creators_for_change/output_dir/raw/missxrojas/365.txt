for my generation at least it's very

uncovered that and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling a very</font>

specific story from that publications

43
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,810
in that vein I'd be really interested to

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,430
find out whether there are any fantastic

uncovering it but the Washington Post

48
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,580
does play a very particular role

49
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,259

you've got it kind of embedded in your

74
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,060
head and some weird cryptic cipher way

75
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm starting to think that my</font>

76
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,880
appreciation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> political drama has a</font>

77
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,500
lot to do with structure what the

78
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,090
function of narrative is the function of

79
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,008
languages and also ideas of like

80
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,538
Socratic dialogue and big holes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

81
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,310
people's arguments and having a lot of

82
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,410
sequences

83
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,820
and questions going back and forth

84
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,440
strong dialogue is so central to my

85
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,090
appreciation of a political drama and

86
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,470
again to kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hug back to Hamlet a</font>

87
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,700
little bit it's a very theatrical

88
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,320
dialogue and that's shown very clearly

89
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,880
for example by the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

90
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">stalking began writing plays frost/nixon</font>

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,660
was originally a play at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> donmar</font>

92
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,610
before they turned into a fantastic film

93
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I really enjoyed just because it's</font>

94
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,370
really nicely edited I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

95
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,020
easy and very mistaken to say that

96
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,730
politics is about right and wrong in

97
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,020
different conceptions of right and wrong

98
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,000
because that radically over simplifies

99
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,040
what's at work politics isn't about

100
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,750
right and wrong it's about argument and

101
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,100
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> persuasion it's about</font>

102
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">narrative and dialogue and strange</font>

103
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,700
notions of vision the idea being that if

104
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a narrative if you present a</font>

105
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,030
persuasive narrative and appealing

106
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,920
narrative whatever you presumably have

107
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
that moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> janu Mont where</font>

108
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,010
everything falls into place everything

109
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,660
makes sense you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the answers you</font>

110
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,820
may not quite understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

111
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,290
everything but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sense of</font>

112
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,900
direction and clarity and linearity that

113
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,550
I think we seek out and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

114
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,170
those narratives they're not perfect

115
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,030
representations of the truth or anything

116
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that as a lot of oversimplification</font>

117
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,310
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new problems ultimately</font>

118
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,290
the question is how convinced are you

119
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you finish watching when you finish</font>

120
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,640
reading when you finish you leaving the

121
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,070
play all writing is persuasive writing

122
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,750
whether the attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to persuade you</font>

123
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,760
of a political<font color="#E5E5E5"> position or a particular</font>

124
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,770
outlook on the world and they involve so

125
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,240
many levels of persuasion the world

126
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,100
creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance the character you</font>

127
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,660
need to be persuaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> about everything</font>

128
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,400
that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen is strangely subtle</font>

129
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,290
and unnoticed way well as paradoxically

130
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,670
it's seeping through every page and

131
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,500
every aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story or maybe yeah</font>

132
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,850
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> political dramas are so</font>

133
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,560
appealing to me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they most keenly</font>

work how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people create these stories and</font>

136
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,200
it's rather meta because you know that

137
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,580
there's this other story being created

138
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,930
within it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe there's something a</font>
