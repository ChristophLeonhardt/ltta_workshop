1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:03,153
>> THIS IS AN INFLECTION POINT

2
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:04,988
AND YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

3
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:09,660
YOU PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE.

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,994
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:13,997
>> ROBERT AKIL IS A ATTORNEY AND

6
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:15,332
ACTIVISTS.

7
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:19,469
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,339
IF PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISTS HAVE A

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,740
RIGHT TO INTIMIDATE AND SCREAM

10
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,877
AT PEOPLE THEY DISAGREE WITH

11
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:27,544
POLITICALLY AND PUBLIC

12
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:28,745
RESTAURANTS AND IN FRONT OF

13
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:35,519
THEIR HOMES, WHAT ARE THE

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,588
BOUNDARIES OF THAT?

15
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:40,991
AND WHAT ARE THE BOUNDARIES NOW

16
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,225
IN THE NEW ACTIVISTS OF THE

17
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:43,994
LEFT?

18
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:46,730
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

19
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,964
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

20
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,534
WHAT MAXINE WATERS SAID TO HER

21
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:51,501
SUPPORTERS IS, EXERCISING HER

22
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:56,406
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

23
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,342
IT'S A SWAMP TERRITORY IN D.C.

24
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,210
RIGHT NOW, WHERE THEY ONLY

25
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,647
LISTEN TO LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL

26
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:04,114
INTEREST GROUPS.

27
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:17,761
>> IT'S A LITTLE STUNNING FOR ME

28
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:19,930
TO TAKE OUT A LECTURE FROM

29
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,231
ANYONE ON THE LEFT WHO HAS BEEN

30
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:22,432
WORKING OVERTIME THE PAST COUPLE

31
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:30,741
OF YEARS.

32
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:31,942
AND IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER

33
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:34,144
IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SCREAM AT

34
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:37,280
PEOPLE IN PUBLIC, AND TO FORCE

35
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,749
THEM OUT OF, FOR EXAMPLE,

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,349
RESTAURANTS.

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,584
THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO WIN

38
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,152
THEM OVER OR SO THAN THE OTHER

39
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:43,987
SIDE OF THE ISSUE, IT'S AN

40
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:44,755
EFFORT TO INTIMIDATE THEM.

41
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,256
YOU CAN'T READ IT ANY OTHER WAY.

42
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:48,959
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THEY WERE

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,693
TRYING TO INFORM SARAH HUCKABEE

44
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,397
>> BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THE

45
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,567
REGULAR PRESS BRIEFINGS, THEY

46
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:58,835
DON'T GO OUT AND HAVE TOWN HALL

47
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,337
MEETINGS, THIS IS THE ONLY TIME

48
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:02,406
THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE

49
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,207
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THEM.

50
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,477
IT'S BEEN >> Tucker: WAIT,

51
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,178
TRUMP JUST PREEMPTED OUR SHOW

52
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,814
YESTERDAY -- >> THEY DON'T SPEAK

53
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:11,415
IN A TOWN HALL.

54
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,321
OPPONENTS.

55
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,291
I'M GLAD THAT YOU ARE HERE, WE

56
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:21,658
DISAGREE.

57
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,959
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A

58
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,393
CONVERSATION.

59
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:24,761
HE DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO

60
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,363
SCREAM AT ME IN FRONT OF MY

61
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:27,564
CHILDREN AT A RESTAURANT.

62
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,965
IT'S AROUND MY HOUSE ON A

63
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:29,766
WEEKEND.

64
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,501
COME TO SOCCER GAMES, GO TO MY

65
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:32,302
PARENTS FUNERALS.

66
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:33,770
DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE

67
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,238
BETWEEN HAVING A DEBATE OVER THE

68
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,810
ISSUES AND INTIMIDATING PEOPLE

69
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,411
IN THE PUBLIC SPACE?

70
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,180
>> THIS IS PART OF THE

71
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,381
ADMINISTRATION.

72
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,283
RIGHT NOW IT'S EXPLAINING WHAT

73
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:48,585
THE POLICIES ARE WENT BY

74
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,453
EXPLAINING WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

75
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:50,387
THESE CHILDREN.

76
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,788
IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A

77
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,190
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS, I DO

78
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,191
LIKE OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE

79
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,293
DONE AND DO TOWN HALLS AROUND

80
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:56,827
THE COUNTRY.

81
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:06,436
DON'T SIMPLY HIDE BEHIND THE

82
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,237
WALLS OF POWER.

83
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,239
IF THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE SOCCER

84
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,907
GAMES AND GOING TO YOUR HOME,

85
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:15,912
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T

86
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:15,946
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     C

87
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:16,112
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     N

88
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:16,146
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     T

89
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:16,179
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     L

90
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,114
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     K

91
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:18,148
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     T

92
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,415
THEY ARE SAYING THEY CAN'T     O

93
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,158
YOU ARE BY DEFINITION

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,160
ENCOURAGING -- FIRST OF ALL YOUR

95
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,561
CLOSING OUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF

96
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:33,930
AGREEMENT OR COMPROMISE, AND YOU

97
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:38,668
ARE BASICALLY SAYING, HURT THEM.

98
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:39,703
HONESTLY, I BEING SINCERE.

99
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:43,940
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT NAZIS WORK

100
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,711
TAKING OVER THE COUNTRY, I WOULD

101
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,145
CONSIDER FORCE.

102
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,147
BECAUSE BY DEFINITION IT

103
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,115
ENCOURAGES VIOLENCE.

104
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:53,650
>> LETS UNDERSTAND THAT DURING

105
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,951
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HE WAS

106
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:57,387
ACCUSED OF BEING EVERYTHING FROM

107
00:03:57,388 --> 00:04:00,991
A MUSLIM SLEEPER CELL TO A

108
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,192
NON-AMERICAN CITIZEN.

109
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:03,693
JOE WILDS YELLED OUT, YOU LIED

110
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,762
TO COME UP DURING THE

111
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:06,696
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.

112
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,999
SOMEBODY HAS TO FIX THE ISSUE.

113
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:12,836
ADMINISTRATION THAT REFUSES TO

114
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:13,737
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT'S

115
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:25,549
THEY SPEAK A LOT AND THAT'S NOT

116
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,750
REALLY THE ISSUE.

117
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,786
THE ISSUE IS, YOU HAVE A RIGHT

118
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:30,987
TO TAKE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES

119
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,924
AND TURN THEM INTO SOME KIND OF

120
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,158
MOB RETALIATION.

121
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,260
MAYBE THE LEFT SHOULD STOP

122
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:38,962
CALLING PEOPLE NAZIS.

123
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,164
MAYBE THAT'S TOO FAR.

124
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,198
MAYBE THAT'S SETTING THE TABLE

125
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,301
FOR SOMETHING AWFUL.

126
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:45,735
CAN WE AGREE ON THAT?

127
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:59,950
SUPPORT CHARLOTTESVILLE WHO HAS

128
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:00,550
NAZI WALKING AROUND WITH

129
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,151
SWASTIKAS?

130
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:10,393
>> IT'S ONE THING TO SAY, OF

131
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,461
SOMEONE WHO IS ESPOUSING, I

132
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,798
GUESS, NAZI VIEWS, YOU ARE A

133
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:15,932
NAZI.

134
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:19,336
BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS, WHAT

135
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:20,737
I NEED TO DO IS DESTROY YOU.

136
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,139
AND THAT'S WITH THE LEFT IS

137
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,374
SAYING, ISN'T IT?

138
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,977
>> I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS, WHEN

139
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:29,346
YOU DO NOT CONDEMN, WE DO NOT

140
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,948
CONDEMN PEOPLE LIKE DAVID DUKE.

141
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,416
WE GET IT SHE'S CONFUSED WITH

142
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,150
THEM.

143
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,989
PEOPLE IN HEAVEN AT TOWN HALL

144
00:05:38,990 --> 00:00:00,000
WHERE YOU SPEAK WITH PEOPLE AND
