I try to relax every single
muscle so that there’s really
no tension involved.
The only muscle
working is my brain.
I just shut my eyes and I
visualize the different ups
and downs in the courses, where
I’m going to make my moves.
I love when it’s a really cold
morning with the perfect snow,
and it makes the perfect —
And they always have a
timer that counts down.
It makes me so nervous, even
when I hear it in the summer
because you know that is
the start of the race.
And it’s like beep,
beep, beep, beep.
I’m heading up to
the first climb.
I definitely don’t want to
go too hard at the beginning
because this is a hard course
and pacing is important.
Nerves come in a lot
of different forms.
Sometimes they come
to your muscles
and they make you
feel totally shaky.
Sometimes they do
this bizarre thing
where they make you so
nervous that you almost
become to this relaxed
state where you’re like,
O.K., come on leg, you can do it.
You’re halfway up
the climb, this
is when your legs start burning.
Don’t think about that, just
think about being light,
being light, being light.
There is no weight holding
me down, I am just this bird
flying up the hills
and across the flats.
I actually discovered that
the voice, the positive voice
in my head that’s talking
to me during races,
is actually my mom’s voice.
Come on, Sadie, come on.
Light as a bird.
It’s like one, two, three,
four, right, left, right, left.
Crest over the top of
the hill, low tuck.
Don’t be afraid of that corner.
Rip out of the corner.
1, 2, 3, 4.
1, 2, 3, 4.
I think my favorite
times to compete
are when the crowd are so loud
that this roaring of voices
becomes almost — it
dulls out anything
in your head, just this buzz
that overtakes everything.
You got to stay in it.
You stay in it.
You still have one more climb.
Headed for the
final climb, this is
where you know you have to dig
deeper than anybody else is
willing to.
O.K., you got it?
All right, headed down
for the finish line.
Get your hands up,
get your hands up.
The line is right there.
I have those times where
I see us crossing the line
and winning that
medal, and the faces
of the girls on our team
and just the excitement.
And it’s totally that extra
motivation that’s like, O.K.,
I can do this and
I’m going to do it.
I don’t know exactly
what it looks like,
but I have visualized
the emotional part of it.
I really try to not
look at my competitors.
I think sometimes
when you look at them,
they seem like
they’re 30 feet tall
or their muscles are this big.
And you don’t see just
another competitor.
And so I try to not look around.
I try to only think
about what I can control
and what I’m going
to accomplish.
It’s nobody else, it’s me just
doing what I do every day.
