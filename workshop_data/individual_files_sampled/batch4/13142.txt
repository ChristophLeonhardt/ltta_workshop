so during this whole thing with the the Cavanaugh hearing as they were you know leveling these chart charge after charge trying to bolster these charges the woman who works with Ronan Farrow at The New Yorker basically said they were printing these things without really checking them because I wanted to bolster the charges of Christine Blasi forward but actually I think that backfired but Trump said this about young men at this point well I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very is a very difficult time what's happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice it really does you could be somebody that was perfect your entire life and somebody could accuse you of something doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say but somebody could accuse you of something and you're automatically guilty but in this realm you are truly guilty until proven innocent that's one of the very very bad things that's taking place right now so this woman and I'm sorry I could not find her name but she put out the satirical song about this about how oh yes men have it so tough and it's such a scary time for men here's the song the chaperone I can't wear a miniskirt if it's the only one I own I can't use public transportation after 7:00 p.m. I can't be brutally honest when you slide into my d-ends I can't go to the club just to dance with my friends and I can't ever beat my dream garnet and date buddy sure is scary time gentlemen band together make some noise it's really tough when your reputations on the line and any woman you've assaulted good turn up anytime yeah scary time for guys can't speak to Danny warmoth or the curse the eyes so confusing Cassandra prison just ignited to make you mean that you even have to be now a lot of people on the right attack this song saying oh you know you live in a free country you can do any one of these things but I don't think that's quite fair she's talking about the fact that women have to be more careful than men in a lot of situations that just the ordinary life of a woman is a life lived on guard to some degree and you know I have total sympathy with that what the problem with it is the problem with it is not that it's that she's blaming and the left is blaming men how would it be if knowing that I walked through a black neighborhood a bad black neighborhood I know I'm more likely to get mugged and I get mugged in that neighborhood and then I say well the shell it shows you something about black people no it shows you something about that neighborhood and about the culture of that neighborhood and about the culture of poverty and whatever is going on in that neighborhood and and maybe it shows you something about black culture you could even say that but does it show you something about black people no that's the kind of generality that the left that identity politics is peddling to everybody so she's talking about men but if she's not talking about the majority of men who would run to her defense she's talking about the bad guys basically the reason she can't live in an apartment on the ground floors because a bad guy's not gonna because of me it's not because of you it's because of somebody who might come in and that is what they're selling that is the whole thing they're selling they're selling bigotry they're selling racism they're selling sexism while swinging those slurs at us everybody's got problems and girls have problems that are for girls and boys have problems that are for boys I think boys suffer from crime a lot more than girls do actually you know because the person most likely to get murdered I think is a young man and it was in within the vicinity of a gang so there's all kinds of problems the world is tough the world is tough but blaming identity groups blaming identity groups is precisely not the way forward and while the left continually accuses the right of doing it it's all happening on the left
