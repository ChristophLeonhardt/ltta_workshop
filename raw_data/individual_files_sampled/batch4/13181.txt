hello everyone I am Alicia Krause and welcome to this episode of the conversation with our very own Andrew Klavan don't forget today to ask questions as a subscriber only subscribers can ask questions be sure to log on to our website daily wire.com and head over to the conversation page to watch the live stream after that just start typing into the daily wired chat box where drew will answer questions as they come in for an entire hour Oh God Michael's conversation that is our very own Michael Knowles has been confirmed for Tuesday November 14th at 2:00 p.m. Pacific 5:00 p.m. Eastern I can't wait to rip him and give him a very hard time that should be really entertaining cuz he doesn't know anything asking really with a laugh so I'm excited to talk to Michael that day that'll be great so we're having some questions come through we're gonna get to as many as possible I like to save people's names and sometimes where they're from like ok with you right no you should yeah you should give their addresses and their phone numbers and we'll send people no no no salesmen will call we won't go that far at all so how are you liking being at the Daily wire I mean this is kind of a different pace for you to do a daily podcast right it's kind of an amazing experience yeah it's a yeah it's about it's about 10 times more work than I thought it was gonna be but it's about a hundred times more fun I mean you have to understand people don't understand this about me I I'm a writer I have lived my life in a room by myself I really have and I spend most of my time in a room by myself doing things with commas you know like like I'm gonna put that take that comma from here and take it there and coming out into the actual world has been a shock I mean it really has to actually be talking to be on camera and I never expected ever to do anything where I would be on camera except an occasional interview so do you like the interaction that you have with your listeners in advance yeah well that's the passport yeah that's the thing I like this I mean the thing about think about writing a book is even now when you could possibly publish a book you know instantaneously you don't you centers your publisher sometimes it takes eight months you get some reactions because it's now everything's on email and all that stuff but it's not the kind of personal relationship that you have like this it's very distant still you know I remember the first time they made one of my books into a movie I remember being on an airplane and they played my movie and you looked around and you felt like there are people like listen they listening to some I wrote you know because see with the head says and that was the first time I realized I had this like kind of personal relationship with people I mean you always know vaguely you're writing for people but you never see it you know we're here everything is instantaneous and also you get to hear a little bit more what about what people like you know you say something and people say well I don't like that I don't like that you said that you know and that maybe maybe you did this wrong or you did that and so that's educational you know you start to find out who's out there you really do not have that relationship when you just write even even now even now when everything's instantaneous you simply don't have the direct relationship because you never know I mean the people who leave comments can be awfully angry people you know you don't know the people who leave comments on your on your writing yeah you know a lot of times there's trolls and all this stuff you know you don't really know what the audience is but something like this especially because the daily wire has a great group of people series not flattering them seriously a great group of people I don't know it's just a lot more personal and interactive and I like it well that's the great thing about the conversation so if you want to ask questions and be a part of our conversations with our daily wire host like ben shapiro michael knowles and our very own andrew pleavin please go subscribe become a member right now so let's get started all right all righty Spencer is asking how can conservatives make themselves intellectually respectable when the left portrays political debates as contests between their informed dispassionate reasoning and our stupidity and dishonesty well that is exactly that's an excellent description of what the Left does and they do do it and it's everything the left us is magnified because they have the megaphone of the press so they have the network's they have the New York Times Ava Washington cause all the big angles and they have the the late-night comedy shows and all the actors and all this stuff so they have put you know like for instance virtually any issue that you deal with has two sides most issues I mean if not talking about like slaughter and slaughtering the innocent you're talking about things with two sides and so let's let's say for example you have a debate about gay marriage and one person is saying well gay people are people and they love each other and they shouldn't be free to be married and the other people are saying well wait you know marriage is a pillar of our society it's a central bastion of freedom we don't want to change the definition that's a debate that's to decent human beings can sit down and have that debate together but the left does continually as Spencer says is they cast it as you are either a good open-minded open hearted person who will accept gay marriage or you're an evil hateful person and it doesn't matter that two years ago whenever was 2008 Barack Obama was against gay marriage and then suddenly he's four it doesn't matter all that stuff that passed is gone so what I always try to do is first get rid of personalities you know don't talk about Donald Trump don't talk about Barack Obama don't say he did this you did this this is happening talk about principles what is the principle that you're defending and once you get get them to that place there's not that much they can do they have to engage and obviously you're always going to get attacked there's no way one of the things I sometimes feel is that people are because I get questions like this a lot and I feel like people are asking me how they can they have this discussion without paying the price you can't you can't they're gonna come after you they're gonna call you names are gonna do all that stuff but get them on principle so I always start like for instance when I speak to people I always say I'm a freedom guy I believe in freedom so gay people want to get married okay but a baker doesn't want to cater that that's okay too you know you've got to have your freedom depends on letting the other guy be free would you say that that's a libertarian stance or conservative I am I am kind of more of a libertarian when it comes to this sort of thing for the simple reason that this wasn't true in the in the old days when we had more of a concern moral consensus it was okay for the government to have laws against homosexuality because everybody including homosexuals thought that homosexuality was wrong that consensus has collapsed a government now that can control what you do in your bed is to bigger government it's to bigger government and that I think that's a change that's come upon us I think that it's a change that conservatives were too slow to pick up on they didn't understand that they were gonna lose that fight I did I knew that they were gonna lose that fight and so I tend to be libertarian about that and of course conservatism in libertarianism or Venn diagrams are very close together you know I'm not I would say there are a lot of things I'm conservative about for instance I'm not at all libertarian about abortion which I don't think that actually I don't think it's a libertarian issue I think if you're killing somebody you know that's that you can't just say like you have the right to do that why do you think there is that disparity between libertarians and abortion well you know I'm frequently asked by libertarians how can you if you're a small government how can you be against the woman's right to an abortion and the question there's only one questionable about an abortion and that is is that a child is that a human entity you know and I simply don't see how you can say that it's not the argument is is always about what the fetus can do at that moment you know can it make a decision can I suffer can it do this it doesn't matter because we don't live just in place we lived in live in time you're not just the person you are now you're the person you were 10 years ago and they're all the memories that you have and so if this if this infant in the womb is left alone it will become a person who can decide which is the same is true of you if you're asleep you know I can't say well your sleep you can't make a decision so if I want to kill you I can no because eventually you wake up eventually that child will be born and I think I think that's once you take that out and you can tell the pro-abortion people do everything they can to delete that human being from the language they don't talk about abortion they don't talk about killing they don't talk about babies they you know it's if if you're pregnant as you know you know that's a baby nobody ever says oh I I'm having a fetus nobody ever says that but once you start to talk about abortion suddenly the pro-abortion people start to use this very vague very scientific language to dehumanize this person you know I always say about anything I'm always in favor of the I'm always for the smallest guy in the room you know I'm always for the guy who doesn't have a voice or doesn't have a chance or doesn't get to say anything seems to me in a room where abortion taking place that's easy easy cool so why do you think there's such a big difference between because I'm always fascinated by this why libertarians tend to they okay no that's something that government shouldn't be involved in well libertarians is a movement are really kind of lost I mean all this stuff about whether marijuana can be that he gets so obsessed with marijuana you know when you talk about him as a political party I can't believe when you talk to libertarians and you bring up pot they're still talking 30 minutes lichter like it's Bob you know you want to smoke a joint smoke a joint but that's that's not an important political movement so I think libertarianism is kind of lost as a political movement as a philosophy that's different as the basic look I think basically the basis of conservatism is freedom and if you are going to be free the other person has to be free and the only argument you can have against somebody else's freedom is if it impinges upon yours and I think that when you listen to conservatives for instance when you listen to conservatives against gay marriage what they say is the family is a principle support of freedom therefore we have to protect the family their talk still talking about freedom I'm I'm a person who would rather let people be free and then work out the problem as it comes up so you know back in the 19th century in England they would argue should Catholics be allowed to vote and they would say well no because the Catholic won't just be loyal to England he'll be loyal to the church as well and what I would have said is like let them vote and if that's becomes a problem we'll work it out at the time okay let's keep moving and don't forget to ask questions as a subscriber you need to log in to the daily wire website daily wire comm and head over to the conversation page to watch the live stream and after that just start typing in the daily wired chat box where drew will answer questions as they come in for this entire hour our next question comes from Jacob Harris he says hello Clavin do you agree with the sentiment that John Keegan expresses that war is not politics carried out by other means but rather it has predated it and comes from human nature yes I absolutely agree with this and by the way it's Lord Clavin I absolutely agree with us you know if you read Shakespeare Shakespeare divided basically the the activities of man into love and war when you were at war you're at war then when he came back he got married you reproduced had families all their stuff war to defend those families to defend those families all this war I always laugh when I hear somebody who's written an anti-war novel or an anti-war film I always want to say good I'm writing an anti hurricane film you know let's see if that solves anything you know because I do think it's one of the activities of man what has happened with war and I think it's an important thing and it's another thing that I think conservatives don't take into account I mean conservatives for instance have yet to incorporate in their minds the effect of birth control on the sexual lives of human beings technology changes things it may not change the morals of things but it changes what happens if you were fighting a war in Homeric days and you were a guy with a sword running out against other guys with swords it's a very different situation that if you're running onto a field and people are wiped out like in World War one whether they were just hos machine gun bullets over a field and an entire town would be wiped off the face of the earth in minutes okay that changes the morality of war nuclear weapons changed the morality of war there was a time when I think war was heroic there was a time when it's horrible as it was war was glorious now I think war is so horrific and so mass so full of mass murder that it's really hard to get the ancient glory out of it and yet at the same time men especially the male especially still feels that he wants to fight for something and and I think a lot of the problems we have in society is that natural basic instinct men have to want to fight for their women to want to fight for the property to want to fight for success its thwarted because when you go out and fight it's all just bombs going off and the guy next to you is gone and there's no glory in it whatsoever I mean the glory is theoretical in the sense that we understand it was glorious that you were brave enough to do that but there's not the glory of watching you know a warrior go out with a sword and fight his way and hack his way through which actually was like an athletic thing that was an actual glorious thing but I think it's a very basic thing I think what we're dealing with is that our natures have been thwarted by technology which has made war so horrifying and so full of mass that our basic nature to fight for what we believe in has been forwarded and I think it creates a lot of problems so it's so interesting that you say that do you how much involvement do you think culture has had in porting the masculinity specifically of American males well I think what happens is that culture that culture would not be able to thwart men being men if you needed men to be men as you did in the old days never would have occurred to a Viking woman to say stop fighting all the time because the minute you stop fighting all that should be gone you'd be carried off by the next drive that was that was fighting you know it's on those moments like 9/11 I remember I remember suddenly all those liberal ladies all those feminists ladies going oh that's what men are for because it's the men who run into those buildings there's no getting around that it's not women who go charging up the stairs when the building is coming down around you it is the firemen it's the policemen those are the guys who do it and then you remember this is part of what men are for now of course in our world men actually do serve a lot of purposes but their new purposes you know the kind of the kind of technological advances do tend to stem from male ways of thinking but it's not the same thing it's not that obvious brute force there is a force that protects us the military and the cops and all that stuff but we've gotten so powerful that it allows people like me to do other things like create and invent and all about I feel like I could talk to you about this for a whole hour all these don't follow up questions in my head but we're gonna get back to our subscribers in a moment but first we wanted to take a second just share with you about our very generous sponsor for this episode of the conversation Skillshare Skillshare I love Skillshare and it's just what we were talking about skills fair is it's this online community where you can get

photography social media marketing digital illustration just about anything I've used them a couple of times I've used them I went on to test them for our audience that's smart yeah so I went online I thought what I'll do is I'll go on the writing ones cuz I've been a professional writer all my life and I've been six just fill out it I'll look at the writing class there were good writing class writing class about how to market how to write you know what to think about and all this stuff and how to plot plot and they're taught by industry experts experienced professionals they're perfect if you're looking to build your career or start some something on the side that you've always dreamed of doing Skillshare is giving Andrew Klavan listeners a one-month free trial of unlimited access to over 17,000 classes what you do is you go to www.sceeto.com slash Andrew and start your free month today that's super cool isn't it and I mean coming from a pro yes to the mouth you come in and you check it out for everybody Eleanor wants to talk to you and say hello I was just wondering what your views if any we're on UK politics the parties in the current prime minister Theresa May or other well-known political figures such as Jeremy Corbyn and others well you know I lived in England for seven years and one of the things I learned very quickly in by doing this and I learned it within a month of moving there is you don't know anything about a country until you live there you really don't you don't do not know the ins and outs you get a sense I know sometimes don't you ever read in the newspaper wherever you're getting your news you'll read about France and you think France is coming a part of the scenes yeah and then you'll go over there think that looks fine you know exactly it all depends where you are really great reason why I mean get the good cheese and the good wine great you know great clothes and all that stuff now these French people are gonna write it it is funny to perfect but but I lived in England for many years and so I learned that you really don't know unless you live there and now I have not lived there for 20 years and so I don't really know I you know I was I was deeply in favor of the UK of brexit I was very much in favor of brexit Teresa may seems to have bobbled this ball she was never in support of brexit and I started by saying you don't know that much about it so you understand I'm an American talking about this she didn't really support brexit I think the European Union is a mistake I think that it is proven it's a mistake by its unbridled allowing of immigration coming in and basically insisting that you have to take these immigrants whether you want them or not if you can fit them or not whether they fit your culture or not and it's very left-wing and is very intrusive and the problem the British have is the British follow rules so if you tell them you know yours and they do by the way if Brussels puts out a report saying you know your potato chip must have a curve in it that's 17 you know on arc of this you know the British will sit around with their potato chips trying to man that you know and of course the Italians are like whatever yeah so so I would say that I'm in favor of it I think Terry samay is blowing it and I think it may not happen because she's done such a bad job Jeremy Corbyn is a dangerous guy he is a clown like Bernie said he's their bernie sanders he is like bernie sanders yeah he does not know he's a leftist socialist he really does not know what socialism looks like he should look at men as well though that is what socialism looks like and the problem is is he's so bad he's so far left because you know Britain really moved to the right he's so far left that they think he's not gonna get in but Theresa May remembers a parliamentary system she has messed up enough so he could very easily slip in and then they're gonna be in genuine trouble I'm curious to see what happens in Austria where the new Prime Minister there is very young yep 31 31 yep my age it's gonna be the new Prime Minister and he's saying that he wants to pull out of the EU as well and make Austria more sovereign nation I think he's a really good sign because whenever we hear the Germany or Austria is going to the right we immediately see that just don't the jackboots and the Nazis and all this stuff and this guy is just a moderate you know right winger who wants to pull away from the far-right but it is a nationalist and does understand I think I think that Muslim immigration is a big problem I don't think that I think that Islam has things inherently in it's ideas that are at odds with the West and just having them come in on mass is a bad mistake and I think that if this guy can curtail that if he can show respectable amount of success suddenly a lot of other countries are going to be saying you know what we're not Nazis if we go a little bit to the right it's not gonna instantly turn us into Adolf Hitler it's interesting because we're friends from Scandinavian countries and they kind of say the same thing they can't understand and they're from socialist countries yeah and would identify a socialist but they say you Americans in your immigration of course you should have a wall because look what's happened to Europe it's ridiculous where daily there you know it detect it is a conflation of race with belief you know I don't care what color a person is if he's an American you know if he believes in the Constitution he believes in freedom I could care I truly could care less but you can have a belief system that is repugnant or just in conflict with the basic premises of the West you know if your if your belief system does not include freedom of religion and Islam in a lot of ways does not I understand can be interpreted in many different ways but there is a strain of it that does not if you are not online with women being an equal part of society and I'm an anti-feminist I see this as an anti feminism you know but you're not welcome in the West you know you're a problem for the West if that is your religion if your religion is that not only not only can your women not be treated equally but they can't leave see that's the important if you want to have a religion where a woman can voluntarily say oh yeah I'll be part of your religion and I'll wear this crazy getup and all that so that's fine but if you kill her when she tries to leave not so fine anymore and that's probably right and so that and to me you don't you can't conflate ideas which are allowed to criticize an attack even if they're religious ideas you can't come flate those with race which is totally just inborn and you're part of you know that you're made in the image of God no matter what color you are well some people might argue well they'd be wrong and they'd be John wants to know can you tell us what the appropriate scope of the government's role in protecting the environment only federal or state none of the above your free use of land but there are permanent side effects permanent side effects I think everybody understands this is called the problem of the Commons everybody understands that the government has some role in regulating the comp the use of common land and of course the error would be be included and that as we all breathe the air nobody wants to go back to the London Fog nobody wants to go back to the smog in la smog in LA was you know cured by people saying we've got to cure this and then they invented the catalytic converter and it's it is really really different out there than it is today if you google a picture of like the valley in the 70s today I remember standing on a hotel balconies watching this green yuck come in over the horizon was a horrible thing so nobody is against you no come this is the you this is the good uses of government how you know how when something what government is for and as I say this is the problem of the Commons is solving the problem that no one person has but we all have so in other words a factory doesn't have a problem with the air because it just wants to build its stuff but all of us together have a problem the air and that's what we use government for the problem is what the left does continual continuously is they take legitimate problems and they cause hysteria about them and then they try to use them to seize all this power it's not like oh let's keep the air clean let's set reasonable standards for air and let each state find a way to meet those standards it's like oh my god it's the end of the world if you don't sign on to this you're a Holocaust denier we're gonna be burned to death in two years or as Al Gore would say we're gonna die two years ago and left and then so you have to give government all the power and all the control over our energy sources or else you're a horrible horrible human being that's a crazy stupid argument that we shouldn't even allow to happen but what happens is the press amplifies that argument and cuts us off when we say you know what I'm happy to take care of the air happy to take care of our water we all want that calm down because by the way if the world is gonna burn up you can't do what to think about it is hope so don't destroy our economies don't take over everything don't be in control of everything as far as I'm concerned like the EPA for instance yes and doing a great job I mean I love what he's doing should be like 52 guys with one of those pool testers you know what it tells us how clean the water is each one should go to a state and dip it in and say any water's a little dirty and they say well clean it come back in six months test it again that's it you know just push set that set the bar where it's supposed to be and then stop telling people to do but the left is all about regulating everything so they always want to make a panic it can't be it can't be you know these city neighborhoods are a problem it has to be racism in America there's no more racism in America nor anywhere else in fact less I would say having lived other places I would say much in America but they always are trying to take little grains of truth and blow them up into forests of sensation yeah okay moving along don't forget to ask questions as a subscriber you have to login so if you're writing things on Facebook or YouTube right now I'm sorry we cannot see them because you need to be a subscriber log into the website daily wire.com and head over to the conversation page to watch the live stream after that to start typing into the daily wired chat box where drew will answer questions as they come in for an entire hour I'm not used to calling you drew do you prefer to be called drew Andrew I don't mind you know my drew Clavin was always my professional and because I was nobody ever heard of Bill Shakespeare so I thought when I write a book it should have Andrew Clayton on it but most people have always called me drew once okay good to know so I guess I could start calling you drew next question is from Emmanuel he says that he has a silly question for Overlord Clavin what is your favorite daily wired cartoon daily wire court what daily wire cartoons I read the daily wire all the time I've never still we have cartoons on the daily where you guys what I liked our funny videos is that what they're talking about the funny videos oh okay I find a lot of those funny in like my mind is gone completely blank a specific favorite yeah well I'll ask you I'll remind you later and then maybe gherkin tweeted out for everybody the hippo what did the hippo oh yes that was funny alright we'll say the hippo serious question what is your biggest letdown and biggest win for president oh good question well I think the thing that I mean it's gotten we've all gotten so tired of saying it it's they keep saying oh it's Supreme Court justice Gorsuch but that's not it really no because he has it's not just courses okay he has is completely changing the nature of the federal courts and as much as conservatives hate Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell has just gotten rid of this thing they called the blue slip rule he's cleared that way so a lot of these guys were being confirmed his and Trump's justice picks and judges judge picks have been tacular as somebody said in an article Scalia's all the way down and I think that that is just terrific I also love and this has been a bugbear of mine for a long time these regulations that Obama specifically but really the government as a whole has been using to control people's lives so they passed these laws and they'll say well yes but we passed the law but here is an agency that is gonna make the regulations and the agency just endlessly that's that what the guy does he goes to work at the agency and makes regulations and so Trump's rule that you have to cut two regulations for every new one you make spectacular those are the things I really do love and do you see that being implemented in places oh yeah it's absolutely yes it's actually happening and it's happening in terms of cutting back regulations that that forced religious people to provide birth control that they didn't want to provide and and the EPA regs against coal coal usage he's cut back and say he's really done a good good job with that obviously he has not been as successful wrangling the cats in the Congress he's not a no okay so what's your biggest let day I would say my biggest letdown with him so far is that he he hasn't he hasn't tempered his tone to get past the bullying he's starting to one of the things I keep saying about trumpet no one no one will listen to me Alicia I keep saying is he learn stuff you can watch him do it you can watch him get better at things you know he is so he's a very successful man he was very successfully changed to let you know the skyline of New York in the 70s and 80s and he did it when people had given up on New York and he was a big success on TV and all this stuff is he will be the first person to remind you what great ratings but ujuj is like but he that bullying thing working the littles people I think you know I understand why people like it because we're taught were all tired of being pushed around by the press basically we all feel that we haven't had a voice Barack Obama was a quiet man but he was a very very nasty man he really divided us and all this stuff that's still still I want to hit back I want to hit back hard but I also want to hit back as like it's not that I want to play by gentleman's rules but I don't want to be as big a bully as they are I don't see it if we keep sinking to each other's levels eventually we just disappear into the earth this ties into the question that was asked earlier about the war and the glory of war yeah I think that a lot of the support for Donald Trump did go back to like those people that felt like they've been deluged or they can't be that macho kind of you know have that bravado anymore and so even though Trump might be a little more extreme than they would be in their everyday life they like cheer him on because they're like well somebody's finally saying it yeah you know you're absolutely right and I got so angry at Bill Kristol today he put out a tweet saying I like everything that Trump is doing but it's not worth his degrading of the culture shut up you know like what yeah yeah what he's I'm like sitting around with your champagne and caviar so you know that he's degrading the culture of the country no I will not go that far I like what he's doing I think it's much more important but but I do want the guys who represent me who are standing up for our side I do want them to fight intensely and without you know any kind of hole holding back but they don't have to be small and they don't have to be personal and they don't have to be bullying and sometimes Trump is he's getting better he's getting better he's not the Mary was a little bit and and you know that there are things there things that he's done the other thing that I would say disappointments me about him but I knew this so it doesn't disappoint me is that he does have this Democrats train on him you know so he wants to get he keeps talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare but he doesn't want to get rid of it he really does feel that deep down he feels that government health care is a good thing everyone everyone to have coverage and and I feel like I don't know if you can square that circle you know you can't have an insurance business that ensures people who are all SiC and they have this thing you know like what do they call it where they have a word for it preexisting conditions that's insane right how is an insurer if you take insurance from me I'm betting that you won't get sick yeah if you're already sick I've already lost the bet why would I insure you you know so I do feel that there has to be a level of care for people who can't afford it or indigent and all this stuff but but Trump does have a certain left to strain and it comes out from time to time that always disappoints me too so drew thinks that Donald Trump is improving his skills when it comes to communication and learning something like but if you want to improve your skills then you need to head on over to skills chair there are generous sponsor of this episode of the conversation with Andrew Clavin what a great segue well here's the thing for my birthday we should many months ago my wife got me a keyboard and

me a free they gave me a free thing to test it out but it is kind of you know I always feel like why am i selling it's free just get it just watch just try it out it can't hurt next question is from Luke Jackson he wants to know do you believe that as the culture shifts continually towards social programs becoming more popular that there will be a point at which the concept of individualism will be abandoned for globalism yeah of course of course if we let look nothing is free every social program they give you buys one of your freedom that's the point of them they're not giving them to you because there's such a nice guys they give them to you them to you because they give you them more power over your life it is natural for people who run for office who want to be in charge to be in charge that's what they want and so they sit and I've talked to a lot of these people and they they stop thinking of their constituents as free people capable of making decisions you know whenever they have one of those congressional budget things where they decide how much is gonna things are going to cost the ones that no one watches and no one watches that nobody believes because they're never right and reason they're never right as they never take into account that people are going to make independent decisions based on what they see before them so absolutely I mean I think that this is another thing when our first question was about how can you have in a conversation with people and they're demonizing you all the time and the conversation that we always have about these things is oh here look at the poor child if you take this program away the poor child is gonna die will die right and we never have the question of like how can we solve that problem without taking our freedoms away nobody ever says it I've never seen anybody say even on the right they never say okay let's let's agree there's a problem now let's talk about what might work in order to preserve our freedoms in order where I don't have to take somebody's money away it's not my money it's their money I don't have to take somebody's money away and just give it to this person who's only gonna then become dependent on that money I mean I've talked to welfare workers and they call it welfare psychosis where after a while you start to show up and say where's my welfare money as if it were your welfare money it's not it's charity forced charity meaning taken away from somebody else and given to you it's not an entitlement you are not entitled to it the person who worked for that money is entitled to it you are being given it it's being taken away by force and given to you and so I don't want people to starve in this con any country I don't want people to starve I don't want them to be sick without getting health care but nobody ever asks the question how can we solve this problem and keep people free because it's too easy to throw money at things and it always breaks stuff it always takes people's freedom and it doesn't really help people I mean I think that when people get addicted to welfare when they get addicted to entitlements it's hard to get them off and and where is after all I mean as we've just seen with Obamacare who has the political courage to cut back an entitlement once it's been given to someone as precious few people and and and this is another reason why I feel the press is so to play I really feel the media is to blame for almost all of our problems responsibilities on the actual voter though to make themselves aware well I mean you're right of course but I mean people are you know or all of us fallen we're all of us corrupt and we can be bought and that's and that's the thing you know once they start giving you that money nobody wants to give it back you know and you also think like oh if I lose this what will I do whatever will I do instead of well you know take the money away and I'll go find it somewhere else I'll work I'll do something else so you know I am a I'm not against the safety net I feel that when you start talking about you know college should be free my first thought is you know I have to put my kids through college why don't have to put your kids through college I don't get that I don't understand it seriously I work really really hard that sounds a lot like Ben like he only cares about his wife and his kids yes doesn't care about yeah well you know it's like I'm a much much nicer person than Ben as you can tell no but I but I do care and I do want people but but I don't see I mean I broke my back to put my kids through good schools I didn't break my back to put your kids in good schools I'd like you to do that oh I'm working yeah dear lord have mercy might have to bring her to the office and homeschool so words words that don't exist to me free that's one of the many words that just doesn't exist there is no such thing as free you know I mean the moon belongs to everyone but the best things in life are not for me here moving along Jeremiah Peterson wants to know Emperor of the land and Hasina westco's hi he says the bend says that he finds friends kind of useless you feel this way as well do you know many people as friends or only have a small pool are you quality versus quantity I don't even have a small pool oh that's not what you meant Ben said he finds a friends kind of useless I love them he said that like Jeremy our very own Jeremy boring is his friend just like oh wow that's that's a big I'm gonna know Jeremy's your friend and and Jeremy it's interesting everybody around here is friends with the boss yeah but I was friends with the boss before so I yeah that's always been you know Jeremy Bourne you I always laughingly called the god-king of the daily wire yeah built this place I mean he did and he's he genuinely is a brilliant guy and he really made this place and took it we were doing these videos in his pool house to begin with and now we're in these beautiful studios and all this stuff don't say where they are no he'll come after so if that is a one of Ben's useless friends I only wish that I had as many useless friends has been that and and I find friends to be one of the great great consolations of life and I you know it is it is an interesting thing when you have a good marriage and I have a 40-year marriage I've had one argument with my wife in 40 years may seriously we have a very intensely romantic marriage and it and it does tend to exclude it tuns tend to create a world around you and your family that excludes other people doesn't let them get quite as close as they might get if I were alone if I were alone I'd be inviting these clowns over all the time and look at them I mean that's how desperate I would be so you know so that that does you do have this intense friendship with your wife that does put you in a different position but I just find friends conversation ideas exchanged pain and pleasures exchange I find that to be one of the great consolations in life life has many difficult things about it obviously not not the least of which being and that it's you know it's full of pain and suffering and loss and goodbyes and I just find other human beings to be just one of the great joys of life and I say this is a writer who as I said spends a lot of time alone but and I think basically if you tide bend down and started to torture him well try it after the show will go that I think he would admit that his friends were important to him talk I am always fascinated to I think that there's such a difference between male friendships and female friendships interests and I think that sometimes Society doesn't put enough stock in the importance of like man to man friendship well I think they like name the beauty of that and like going there going through life together of that you know there's a wonderful short story by Henry James called the great good place I stole the name from my memoir the great good thing from the great good place it's this dream he has of heaven where it's basically just men walking around discussing ideas I think I kind of understand that I mean there's nothing I like better than a drink in a cigar and to sit and chat about you know what's going on and religion and all these things see women do the same thing except usually at the nail salon if you want to ask questions please be sure

questions as they come in we're keeping the questions rolling next question is from christian silva wow man you have like lots of nicknames here these are not my title Christian asks hello Clavin supreme leader of the mall that's actually on my business card I cannot say these like with a straight face sorry although Trump has taken the office and there is a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate the military seems to keep declining why I'm not interesting tirely sure that's true it takes a long time een Obama gutted the military and you know you can say it was because of sequestration but sequestration was a gimmick that Obama basically stepped into and then used to gut the military it military was really in bad shape I don't think that it is true that is necessary thoroughly declining still I think what is true is that it takes a long time to build up the military once you know you've let it let it decline well even before him I mean George W Bush tried to rebuild a little bit right but of course the strain that Iraq and Afghanistan had on the military and people don't talk about this much but President Bill Clinton did a lot to cut to military that's right that's right and it really was a strain and a strain we didn't entirely pay for the the george w bush freedom agenda was looking back on it i agreed with some of it but i have to say that some of it was ill-thought-out I think the the Trump will start to bring the military back we're in terrible debt you know also we have to be careful that we have a military that is lean and mean rather than one that is expansive and just full of just sucking up money I do think that there come there is coming a point and I think this is something I like about Trump he's doing it instinctively I worry a little bit about that because you have to do this well but he is instinctively a little bit of an isolationist I'm not an isolationist but I am a contained you know I do not think we can police the world I don't think we can fight the world I don't think we can save the world I think that we have to defend our own borders first our own people first then our allies and then whatever else we can do but I think we do need to leave me mean military and I'm I have a hope that he'll bring it back from where it's been anyway okay say that S word again which you talked about I don't want to say it cuz I don't want to jinx how you say it what did I say the Ted Cruz Obama using it as an excuse for military cuts oh no it was like the caramel caramel tomato tomahto you spell you said sequestration sequestration what sequestration Oh sequence who cares are there are there speaking skills on Skillshare comm you know the probably are almost everything there's 17,000 classes we've got

it's a story a serial story that we're telling okay and we're printing up in another website ricochet cuz we can't do it here because it's got some bad language in it and stuff like that so we were

unlimited access to over 17,000 classes go to WWE show calm andrew and sort of free month I just loved hearing you say side hustle so Brendan I hope I'm saying that right Brendan Gilroy he wants to know what's your view on cussing you just admitted you cursed a little bit on this other podcast Michael Nolt is I've listened to your audiobook for the Empire of Lies and I remember hearing you cuss and say some colorful things and it made me wonder how you felt about it in everyday life I will tell you a funny I can tell you two funny stories about the night I used to play tennis I don't anymore but I used to play tennis and when you play Telemachus sometimes you have a bad day and I was playing a guy and I was saying God darn it gosh rotten stupid dad you know and he stopped the game this guy stopped the game and came to the net and said listen I read your books there's no golf Barnett in your books you know people curse in your books I said well those are in my books this is no Club I said they're ladies here he said there are no ladies in your books either that's true and the other thing is I was just talking about this book another Kingdom absolutely true when I started writing it I thought you know it it has an underpinning of Christian thought and it's not a preaching book it's not a Christian book but it has this underneath and I thought it would be really nice because I know the Christian audience is very delicate when it comes to cursing if I could write the book without curses on it I wrote the entire first draft we're talking about three hundred and fifty pages I thought the entire first draft without any curses in it and it was absurd it just was not the way to you it didn't seem real at all and it wasn't and you know you get to this point where people are screaming at each other and they're saying you stinky pop you know so so basically I just I rewrote it and I put the curses back in and there been people commenting they're not a lot it's not like you know it's not like every other words not The Sopranos or anything like that was just a people curse when they curse i I do not curse in front of women thank you I try very hard not to curse in front of women I'm not always successful what I did I have to admit when I'm alone with the boys and we're sitting around I get a little raw but yeah but but I still and I still don't like I hate to say this because I know it's like unmodern I still don't like you're in women curse okay I was gonna say after being on radio for four years with Ben Shapiro yeah and you know the guys talk talked during commercial break and we're like you know joking around and all that stuff I'm not a cursor like I only curse if you like hurt me or my family messy what my words and my heels like what's going down and Ben always said that he that he thinks that cursing for like guys is a normal natural thing to express yourself no but it seems like dirty when a woman does it you know what are your thoughts I I don't know it doesn't it doesn't seem dirty it just doesn't seem ladylike I think I'm just old-fashioned enough to sort of expect women to elevate the room you know when women come in everybody gets better yeah it's like you know I mean listen I used to work in a newsroom so y'all are scoundrels and we just like enlighten you a little bit I used to work in a newsroom it was all guys it's Mel the language was bad people behaved badly and then they hired a couple of women and everything like I mean and and in England there are these clubs still where they don't let women in me go there's all these old men's smokes you know smoking cigars with ashes on their vast and snoring and all this stuff and then you go to the club's with a black women and everybody's talking and they're polite and it's lovely yeah it's like I think women have always in my life elevated a room and I just I still can't get used to obviously I don't I don't go around lecturing people about it but I still don't like it when women Christmas interesting yeah good to know Liana Clarke wants to know where did you live when you lived in the UK and are you visiting again anytime soon I visited just a few months ago I still have many many friends there and and I loved it I lived in I guess technically it's South Kensington I was on the border of Earls Court I lived in a building where Princess die lived when she was just - die or lady die where she was and I lived right it was a beautiful beautiful neighborhood right off the old Brompton Road and I could walk to my office's different offices that I had at the time and I just I loved that's it I have to tell you that it was like falling in love I'm not kidding I lived for years there I don't think my feet touch the ground and it was just like falling in love I would wake up every morning eager to see the city I loved seeing the city I felt elevated and good up all the time I just loved it now I was there for seven years after six and a half years this weird switch turned on in my head and it was coming up on the on the Millennium and I think that had a lot to do with the two because one day I was at a party for X it was all expatriate writers we were all leaving and it was the Millennium was coming yeah I'm moving back I'm going back and and something just kind of switched like I didn't want to die in England I didn't want to die in Englishmen I felt it like I'm an American I loved my country but man oh man I still love that country today it's not I can't recapture that that love I felt for it then but I love the people I met made many good friends there and I go back and visit I try to go back in business as often as I can any plans for speech is there any time soon I feel like that was gonna be a follow-up yeah yeah you know they call me if they'll pay me to go over there I'll certainly go okay I think the next question we had was gonna be from O'Connor yep there we go goddamn Brookhaven it better be God with a little baby that's a different that's a jumpy business card don't be blasphemous know how do conservatives take back the culture oh man I I think that this is like it's always an interesting question that everybody wants to know the answer to well for one thing you have to love the culture the the arts cannot be saved by people who don't love them and you know you talk about cursing and all that stuff obviously the important thing about a work of art is not whether people curse in it not whether people are naked in it but whether it represents the inner life of man accurately and one of the things that I despise about the left is that they know how to make stories that touch on the inner life and then filled them with propaganda that's untrue so for instance you know perfect a classic example avatar was probably a great example I mean there's a classic story guy goes back he goes native and all this stuff but it was filled with images that just weren't true of American military destroying the energy source of an innocent of noble savages and all this stuff but if a story tells the truth almost all good stories are conservative because if you tell a story that tells the truth is about individuals it's about the God it's about nobility and all this stuff we take we we have to take back the culture by participating in the culture we have to take back the culture by making culture and we have to take back the culture by supporting people who make culture and this is the thing this is the big one there are a million conservative think tanks they built an entire conservative build an entire system to fight back about the universities not one of them deals with the arts we have think tanks about law if think Tex about legislation we have think tanks about a city policy we have there's not one think tank there's what Andrew Breitbart wanted to do he Breitbart before he died told me I'm gonna he said to me I'm gonna make you the president of my artistic think tank and I said sign me up I'll do it you know and then he didn't live to do it I think that we need awards for artists artists work for love you know I know this you know we need the money but we work for the love we need awards we need review venues you know you look at the you know weekly standard and the National Review and also they don't have people dedicated to movies dedicated to books they have people who will review books and review movies but they don't really know you pick up the New Yorker and you read Denby I think his name is he really knows the movies I mean they've got another guy Anthony Lane who doesn't know the movies but the guy one of their guys really knows the movies you pick up I don't want to name names would you pick up a lot of conservative things and they will write about the arts but not with the kind of expertise that that gives a review the kind of bite that it needs we need review venues we need studios we need people to buy some moviemaking studios and or at least create some movie making and and TV making studios we need publishing houses we need all that infrastructure and we don't have it you know people like me and I have fought and scratched and done very well as a writer of fiction but I have done it basically by just kind of bullying my way through and I've never well I didn't want to say that but but no you know but but I think that like it shouldn't be it's always gonna be hard to be an artist cuz everybody wants to do it but it shouldn't be so hard to be a conservative artist and and the Conservatives just don't care that I mean they just don't care and it's like I've made the speech so many times I got tired of making it right so you have to support the arts and I always used to joke that they look at me like my wife looks at me when I tell her that when you buy something on sale it still cost money you know my wife like you know I like you but I don't know what you're talking about you know that's the big conservatives say when you say you know the arts are where you lose the cultures where we lose elections Barack Obama would never have been elected if the if the arts and our culture had not eaten away the ground of freedom under our feet for 50 years before that's a really good point and don't forget if you want to ask questions we only have a few minutes left so be sure to log on to our website daily wire comm and head over to the conversation page to watch this stream live after that just by typing into the daily wired chat box where drew will answer questions until we run out of time so let's try to grease through some more before we run out of there all right Ryan wants to know is the moral development towards the left with the scary things it entails inevitable it's inevitable over the long term because leftism is a form of decay and all things that humans make die and decay but as I always say you don't have to win over the long term you just have to win today conservatives are like doctors we know we'll lose because freedom always dies but it doesn't have to die today and if it doesn't die you keep it alive long enough then you die and you're not the problem and it belongs to your children so so all nations I'd like to have something with some freedom believes and I know me too me too and freedom look freedom is a living thing all living things die freedom is a human thing and all human things die countries are human things all human things like keep it alive today keep it alive today and tomorrow and never despair and I mean this is the thing I used to tease Ben when Ben and I first met I said you he was very pessimistic and I said why yeah I know but and I said to him you're like a doctor who like a thirty year old man comes in and you say you're gonna die he says when he's 150 years you know well everybody's gonna die in 50 years look you lose the battle but you don't lose it today and that's all we have okay Veronica Young wants to know oh she calls you handsome that's what my business what do you do when you still love someone who has rejected you it feels dishonest in my heart to date someone else even though I try how do you turn off reshape or before that love that's so tough I mean look this is a this is a question one of the things is you cannot take the pain out of life life is painful there's a lot of loss even when you're happy you know your children grow up you know you grow old everything is all your parents died everything is about letting go in life and it's an art you have to perfect if you're going to love life and enjoy life and this is true of someone you know most of us have had this experience I certainly have when you love someone who doesn't love you back you got to let them go and that's something you just have to practice and until you get it right you know and it's the thing is you can't it becomes masochistic you know you start doing you're starting to enjoy the pain of it if you just link it's time to move on it is you know having your heart broken I mean like I said an experience we all go through most of us go through but but it is something you just have to learn to let go of and you have to learn to like it's almost I almost have to learn to enjoy the melancholy of goodbyes because so much of life is goodbye every day in life is goodbye in some way or other I think it's different stages of your life there's different stages of goodbye that's right exactly you're always saying goodbye to something but but you do not want to lose the love that's waiting for you that God has waiting for you because that wasn't it you know feel the pain suffer the pain move on it's the only thing you can do relationship advice from Andrew Clavin a wise word this woman I'm gonna totally butcher this name Yago Queen Tana I hope I said that right oh he says Senor how can conservatives make sense of the argument that although man is inherently evil the community will still step in to take care of the needy without government intervention okay but wait a minute that I mean all government is is a power center and we need power centers to achieve things that require power but it is still filled with people government is not you know some magic entity that just does the right thing it's still filled with people so if government if people are fallen and corrupt and evil you've got there's a good chance the government will be fallen corrupt and evil we all know that we need government I mean was it Madison yes it was Madison who said men were angels we would not need government they're not angels we need government that's not the argument we're having this always really bothers me that that's not the argument we're having we're not having whether we need government where the question should be how small can we keep government and still have a society you know and as far as I'm concerned just as smaller but we should keep experimenting keep pushing the envelope if it gets too small and we have chaos good bring it back a little bit but it's always government's natural tendency is to grow we should fight that natural tendency and keep pushing back and pushing back there's there's no question that we need government that's not the question is how little government can we have because the picture of the government is less for you and I think part of Iago's question though was re how do we guarantee though that because men are not perfect that they're gonna step up to maybe do that charitable work to fill the void well I you know I think that all of our founding fathers said basically that our Constitution is built for religious people and I think one of the things we're suffering from is that we're no longer a religious people and I it there's a open question whether an irreligious people can be free you know I mean if we're not gonna take care of each other it's not about the government goes away and we don't do anything it's it's having communities that care for their weak people in it that is part of an element of our founding faith of Christianity that we take care of the people who fall behind it's not I mean this is the thing the argument is not between government taking care of people and Oh to hell with them it's government taking care of people or finding other ways to do it and I think we should really work hard to find community ways to do it guys like Barack Obama purposely set out to destroy government in dependent communities of helping and I think we should purposely set out to rebuild that's a good point last question great Overlord Clavin sorry I can't what could pro lifers do in pop culture to change hearts and minds maybe a sci-fi analogy and can anything that would make a truly powerful statement actually get produced how yeah very tough if you're talking about Hollywood not so much but one of the things that has really frustrated Hollywood is they find that they can't make abortion a happy ending they can't turn it into a happy ending and they have tried and tried and tried but they can't because it's not a happy ending it's a despicable horrible thing I think there's a showing called the good doctor which I haven't seen in which a mother actually stands up and says I'm not even if you want me to I'm not having an abortion it actually stands up against it you know we get we can tell those stories but it's hot it's hard I mean we don't own the culture they took the culture we have to take it back and I think that these are stories you know I mean I wrote the story the Gosnell story they still haven't released it they still haven't found a way they made the film but even that was very very difficult and I'm not sure how it turned out you know I'm just the screenwriter so I only see it when I write I write them they're great but they don't always turn out that way but like you know the it has been very very difficult if you go on there's a movie called something like October baby or something like that with a pro-life movie go on Rotten Tomatoes and it gets something like a 98 percent from people and a 2 percent review from the reviewers because the reviewers are out to get it this is an absolute it sacrament among the left and and you know I was talking about this today on my show I understand why they want abortion I think it's it's a fundamental injustice built into nature that when you have sex with a woman she can get pregnant it means that she is not as free as you are you know she is and and we all want people to be free and I understand but unfortunately they're things like you can't say well you know you don't like your wife so kill her you can't say oh well the baby creates a problem so kill it that it's simply a moral line we should not cross so it's not like you know this is what I talked about before about the press making it so we're always at each other's throats and there's no conversation we can have we can have a conversation about this I think but with some people but I think that the the press and the arts and the culture that the left controls has gone out of its way to make this a sacrament that somehow and and by the way they're losing they're losing because the argument I mean the thing is the thing is science is on our side you know people always say to me you know Thomas Aquinas said that you could it's possible he was against abortion but he said it is acceptable have abortion before the baby quickens before it moves and I thought yeah cuz he didn't have a scanner where you could see Thomas Aquinas an ultrasound he would not have said that exactly I mean science is on our side but I do think look you can't you can't ask me how we can make cultural art of artifacts in a world where the Left owns the culture they don't own it entirely anymore because there's so many ways to publish books yourself to put out little videos to do all this stuff all the things that I've done I mean I have done all these videos I've done videos about abortion that done vide you know you fight back we're in a guerilla war that is what the culture is we're in a guerilla war and I know this because I am a guerilla in both senses of the word and and you fight back from the places we have it worked when if we fought the British in the revolution it's gonna work now we're gonna beat them we're gonna beat them by popping out from behind YouTube from popping out from behind podcast from popping out from behind trees and taking down this Empire one step at a time and I do believe woman ok Andrew
