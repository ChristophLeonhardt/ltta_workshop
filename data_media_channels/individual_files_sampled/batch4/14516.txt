I'm Ezra Levant it's May 28th and you're watching battlegrounds hello and welcome to battleground it is a feature we have had at the rebel for about a month now every day between 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. Eastern time I come to you live on a feature that YouTube is created called super chat which allows me to talk to you the comments on the right side of the screen and the super chat aspect is for folks who want their comment to be pinned you can chip in a couple of bucks or a couple of pounds or a couple of Swedish kronor and it'll be up there for a period of time that money goes to the rebel to help pay our costs we've had a lot of fun on this noontime show for the past month I look at it as a light-hearted way to deal with news that doesn't quite fit into my evening show at 8:00 p.m. a lot of laughs last week we got into some silly subjects but today is a grave day I don't feel humorous at all and we have only one subject we're going to cover and that is the shocking and drumhead conviction and sentencing of our old friend Tommy Robinson a drumhead trial is a term for a trial that happens so quickly that it does not have proper procedure it is the type of trial that is sometimes done in a battlefield it is the type of trial that if done in a third-world country is called a kangaroo court or a sham trial or a sham court I'll show you some video we'll take the time or take the whole hour today about this but for those of you who don't know and for those of you in the United Kingdom who are subject to a publication man let me give you a recap of the facts as you know Tommy specializes in the subject that so many people in the West want to talk about but that's so few official people want to talk about matters Diaz lame' fication of society and in particular Tommy focuses on a horrific phenomenon in the United Kingdom at his industrial scale rape gangs and typically Tommy goes to court to confront the accused rapists to show them to show their names to ask them questions and he's almost always alone these cases are horrific and horrendous the case in question on Friday was in Leeds UK there were 29 people on trial 27 of them were men two women who were involved as well who were accused of raping more than a dozen girls aged 11 to 17 think about they raped an 11 year old girl but understand what a rape gang is this isn't hiding in the bushes and then jumping out grabbing a girl raping her and then running off this is a rape gang that raped these women allegedly over a systematic extended period of time again and again they tricked them trap them extorted them exploited them groomed them as a phrase I hate using the word groom because it sounds like something you know you you you know he's got good grooming he has a good haircut and he's well-dressed that is not I don't want to use that word because it is the opposite it's it's tricking and trapping and extorting typically a man will encounter a 12 or 13 year old girl either online or let's say on the street and ingratiate themselves here's here's some free candy seriously these kids these girls are so young candy is often what's in question for older girls that might be a cigarette or alcohol and they give these trinkets to these girls and they woo them and Sam I'm do you want a grown-up boyfriend you deserve a boyfriend don't listen to your mother so they they trick these girls of tender years and then maybe they get a kiss or maybe they they say send me a topless selfie I'm just telling you and these are not examples I'm making it out of the blue these are examples from the rather and report and other reports and when a girl compromises herself a little bit let's say sends a topless sext the selfie then the trap is sprung oh if you don't sleep with me now I will send this picture to your mother and let her know that you've been drinking and consorting and sending naked pictures so you must now sleep with me or I will I'm extorting you because I'll embarrass your mother oh you've slept with me now you have to sleep with all my friends who will rape you and they're all in this together it's collusion it's not I mean rape is a horrific crime but typically in the West it's a it's a it's a solitary crime of sneaking crime in a dark alley but here it's the opposite it is gangs who work with each other and these girls are trapped and sometimes they do go to police go to their parents but as we've learned so often police social workers frontline health care workers refused to act because they're worried about being called racist there were cases documented I just read one the other day in this in The Times of London that actually a police officer and two politicians in Rotherham when it was brought to their attention a rape gang they joined the rape gang because that here were these helpless girls who were being victimized who were trapped who were being extorted the cop and the two politicians joined the rape gang in other instances when a mother or father would drag the girl to the police station say she's been raped she's been drugged the police would say to the parent you shut up now or we will charge you with neglect sometimes when brothers or fathers would go to these houses where the mass rapes would happen they were charged by police with causing a disturbance or breach of the peace so I just wanted to wanted to give you four five minutes what this is that Tommy's protesting it's not the odd random rape it's a systematic rape on an industrial scale the city of rather him alone is just a city of a quarter million people but more than 1,400 girls were raped 1,400 girls out of a city of a quarter-million people who saw their 125,000 females in that city and I don't know what fifty thousand them are that within a certain age if you have raped 1,400 girls in a city of 250,000 that is almost every single family that has been touched and that went on for a decade and the case that Tony was reporting outside the courthouse in Leeds about went on for nearly a decade as well and what did Tommy do I see there's a super chat comment I'll come to that in a moment and what did Tommy do well he was very careful because as you know Tommy used to work for us at the rebel and almost exactly a year ago he was reporting outside a rape case in Canterbury and he made the mistake of stepping onto the property of the courthouse and he made the mistake of doing a video selfie you know on periscope when he was still on Twitter 45 seconds that's all it was he only showed himself he didn't show any accused he didn't show any jurors he did make the one mistake of saying a rapist instead of an accused rapist Tommy that his home was raided at 4:00 a.m. do we have do we have the video of that the 4:00 a.m. arrest raid so Tommy did a 45-second I'm talking about last year's case I'll come to this year's case soon for a 45 second video selfie that neither compromised any suspect or any juror Tommy had his house raided SWAT team style at 4:00 a.m. I just want to show you a little bit of the footage Tommy had always had his wits about him and when they came to his home at 4:00 a.m. he turned on his cell phone take a look at this for a second 0 for 32 and the place at my house and I'm being arrested for going to a court case in Canterbury and trying to video the Muslim that's footage from a year ago when police Raiders house why would they raid his house at 4:00 a.m. they could have phoned him they know him they know his number they know where he lives they know his lawyers tommy has been in and out of well contact with the law that's proved that way for a decade but they chose to raid his house at 4:00 a.m. to make a point shock and awe to disrupt and destabilize him and to send a message to his family to stress out his family his beautiful wife and his three beautiful kids Tommy doesn't hide Tommy doesn't run why didn't they come at 9:00 a.m. why didn't they come when the kids were at school why did they come at 4:00 a.m. because it is political it is punitive and I say again that is the hallmark not of a free country like the United Kingdom that is the hallmark of an unfree country of a police state I see there's some super check comments one from someone named a legit babyface and one from someone named nerdy Dov I will come back to those comments make a note of them and I will get back to you thank you for your support they came to his house to make a point that they can do things to him any time in any manner and if he thinks the rule of law if he thinks he will be given all the benefits of the doubt like Muslim rape gangs are he will not be he was taken to Canterbury Court we Amin when he worked for the rebel I had the authority to act as his employer and we immediately dispatched outstanding lawyers we took half a day to track him down we finally found out where he was in what jail he was in we sent lawyers up to Canterbury we got him out that night he was home that night to his family and we later had a proper trial but it was on a knife's edge it was under knives do we have the transcript from the the court a year ago and I sent that to you this morning it was an excerpt from the courtroom we'll find it a paraphrase of T now but I'll show it to you when my producer finds it the judge in Canada a year ago said it's on a knife's edge do I throw you in prison and I know you'll be at extreme risk in prison but a large part of me doesn't care I'm gonna you think I'm making that up and going to quote you the exact quote from the judge when we call up that transcript so we managed to get what's called a suspended sentence the judge says three months in prison but I'm not gonna pull the trigger on that now but it's gonna hang over you for 18 months so that's the back story a year ago tommy was in Canterbury he was reporting outside a rape gang trial there he against the rules video to himself for forty-five seconds and he said rapist instead of a lady through rapist those two things a three month prison term now we're suspended but still a three month prison term and for standing on precincts in the court I ask you have you ever seen any media report from a courthouse yes of course media always report from a courthouse when there's something involving law and order do they stand on the courthouse property of course they do because it's a beautiful shot from a TV news point of view having the majestic court in the background every single journalist in the history of the West stands in front of the court when they're doing a courthouse journalistic piece but only Tommy was said because you were physically standing on the on the sidewalk in front of our courthouse that's against the law so I tell you all that by way of background because on Friday and again Tommy hasn't worked for us for a couple months it's been an amicable goodbye but you know he's been independent and god bless him so I saw on my Facebook feed that Tommy was going live outside the courthouse in Leeds UK and I thought oh and I always makes me a little nervous because I lived through that experience with Tommy a year ago and I thought well geez I hope he's just remembering our rules because when every time that we go to court we would say all right remember say accused and alleged until they're convicted don't violate a publication ban and don't stand on court property every other journalist stands on court property but again there's no fairness there's no rule of law when it comes to the UK and Tommy Robertson so those were our rules for Thomas ours I got a little nervous when I saw Tommy was at court Leeds and I was but I'm curious and I think Tommy's got a lot of courage so I watched him and he was exceedingly careful every time he said alleged or accused I was watching that I was watching that I thought could good and you could see and he was doing the Facebook live for a full hour and he was very careful to stand on the street or on the sidewalk and there was one moment in the hour where you asked some official can I stand here oh yes I can so those two things very very careful I understand that there was no jury so no one could have been affected he was the final day of the whole trial it was the verdict day there was no more trial to come and and finally when he read the names of the accused he was reading them from a new site if I understand where he was reading them from because I later found this he was reading from from the BBC do we have that BBC page let's put it up here for a second so right now I'm showing you you can see on the right hand son says BBC see those names her fan a med Nazaret has same Zubair ahmed mohamed respond as la mohammed camera maja there's a lot of more happens there you see that this is a he'd hassan mohammed azim whether it's about there's a whole bunch of Mohammed's there's got to be eight Mohammed's there so if you see that this list here this is not from the rebel website that little logo on the bottom right that's that's we just put that on screen this is from the BBC website and you can see the two women at the bottom the Muslim women who were who were involved with him so do you see that this is on the BBC's website right now so the BBC the state broadcaster in the United Kingdom was publishing those names and Tommy was literally reading those names from the BBC website so what had Tommy done wrong did he call accused criminals criminals so did he already assert that they were guilty no he did not I watched him he said alleged are accused okay check was he on the precincts of the court itself no he was not you could see you could see that he was not did he in some way jeopardize an ongoing trial no he was last day in fact they were coming to court with their prison backs in case I see there's more comments they're nerdy dev and I see this in a comment there from steam machine I promise that I will come back to your comments I'm later in the broadcast as 12:14 I want to get some facts up first but I will come back to the super jack comment did Tommy break a publication ban by saying the names of the accused well he was reading the state broadcaster he was reading from the website with state broadcaster that was publishing their names for the world to see our producers tell me they have before I move on I want to show you what the judge in Canterbury said all right so this is from the transcript in the court this is the judge talking to the QC that we hired for Tommy was an outstanding QC by the way let me read it the cola Levski was his name I accept what mr. kovalevskiy tells me about the dangers that you might face were you to be sent into immediate custody I have to say it is on a knife-edge so far as I'm concerned because a very large part of me thinks so what you can be put into protective custody do you understand the importance of what I just read to you you can find that transcript online by the way that's from the court in Canterbury from a year ago Kovalev Sookie said your honor he's just you know and by the way if you read the whole transcripts you'll be reminded that Tommy Robinson got approval in luton to stand on the steps of the court and he showed the judge that he said judge I thought I could stand on the steps of course I was told I could and luton so Tommy thought he was kosher and by the way every other journalist does it so for that trifle 45-second video selfie and I acknowledge he should have said accused criminal set of criminal you sent a guy to prison for three months for that I don't believe it I don't believe it not in the country with the rule of law where no matter how high or how low er you treated in the same way no no and you did you see the judges Cavalier near it you put that that transcript out for one more second please you see that so mr. Cole over the Lipsky said hey judge you put this guy in jail you're going to get him killed because prisons in the UK they're halal prisons they're run by the Muslim gangs really and what and you're in jail already you're Muslim prison you're in jail already for murder for terrorism you don't think that's just an extra 72 virgins for you to knock off Tommy so the judge says you know what so what so what really so you're going to sentence a man to death for taking a 45 second video selfie that did not identify any juror and he accused well yeah that's the law for Tommy Robinson in the UK you know I grew up here in Canada we're part of the Commonwealth Queen Elizabeth is our queen she's on our currency our stamps our passport and you have this dream in your mind oh I know what the UK is like it's a land of Magna Carta Shakespeare Winston Churchill oh it ain't no it ain't no it ain't so I showed you the raid on Tommy's home last year I showed you the judge saying where I was going to throw you in jail but not this time three months suspended sentence so here we are were twelve months into the 18-month period so understand the prison term that that judge a year ago gave is a three month prison term did you get that but she suspended it she said I will not make you serve those three months if you're of good behavior so it's like a dagger over your head hanging by a string for 18 months after 18 months the dagger goes away but we're only 12 months into that dagger you understand that so comes Friday Tommy's outside the courthouse and Leeds I got to tell you I won't lie I was nervous for Tommy I thought geez what he in there man what are you doing there well you don't tell Tommy now I mean one of the in our my last meeting with Tommy a couple months ago when we say goodbye I said Tommy Robinson's not built for any boss is he you didn't need to hear that for me you know that Tommy Robinson's he told me he never had a boss before in his life Oh believe me I could tell and you can't put lightning in a bottle that's Tommy Robinson so he went on his own and and I thought oh my god Tommy now be careful be careful because there's two ways Tommy Robinson's going to end one is god forbid he'll be attacked physically by an Islamic extremist the other is god forbid he'll be seized and thrown in prison to be killed by an Islamic extremist and so let me show you what happened I'm sure you've seen this video before but if you are in the United Kingdom and maybe you have not seen this video before here's a video of Tommy and again he was doing a one-hour live stream on Facebook he was only there with a couple friends George does cameraman and there was a lady there as well and let me show you from her know where Tommy was alone on the street seven cops I counted you count them with me seven cops took Tommy and put him in the back explain wasn't a big sleepy what does that mean you know what I don't mean a female what does that mean this is this is ridiculous you feel what you're doing it I haven't said a word I eat the sock in fact someone laid their hand in the salt in the app so I call other people threaten me about my mother and Here I am being arrested for saying nothing about water please George excellent questions what did I do wrong what does it mean how am I possibly disturbing the peace how on earth was he disturbing the peace if you looked at his hour-long video as I did he was by himself on the street disturbing the peace public - so there was no public there there was no peace being disturbed it was Tommy speaking at a pretty quiet probably this volume like it wasn't shutting he was talking to his phone for an hour I want to read a few quick super chats that came in before before time to us by just a reminder what a super chat is you chip in a couple bucks and make sure comment on Twitter bright-colored and we get the dough to help pay our bills here and I try and make a point of reading all those so thanks I see nerdy dub says do you think this is where Canada is heading without a major change yes absolutely we see this already in the city of Halifax Nova Scotia police have stopped referring to the ethnicity of Muslim taxi drivers there's been a string of Muslim taxi drivers sexually assaulting Canadian girls in Halifax and at first I mean they're all let's them I'm sorry they are and the first police would describe them but now they don't they just say someone with an accent what's that mean is it a French accent an Italian accent that you too should send you know look isn't it saying some was an accident identify them does it is it an Irish accent is it a German accent is it an accent from the deep south how their little thing you want to ride this is that accent is that it's a Texas accent hurt a little Fang is that the accent so yeah police are already self-censoring in Canada in Toronto Kevin J Johnson is being prosecuted under a hate crime for some video he did I mean I myself have been taken to court by the Human Rights Commission's taken to their human rights court for publishing those Danish cartoons of Muhammad a dozen years ago that's my answer to you someone named a legit babyface says this is why I'm thankful to live in the u.s. site like this will never hopefully happen Godspeed for Tommy free Tommy Robinson well you're right you've got the First Amendment I think that is the most important Amendment it's the one that defends all the others I heard someone say take away all my rights except for freedom of speech and with that I will win back my other rights and that's why they go for freedom of speech first and they're doing in the UK and they're doing it here in Canada hang on to your First Amendment and don't you think for a second that what you saw there about Tommy Robinson wouldn't be done to Alex Jones Gavin McInnes Bill O'Reilly bill Hannity you're sorry Sean Hannity excuse me you don't think Rush Limbaugh would be booked up for hate speech you don't think any right-wing American would be picked up the way Tommy was without your First Amendment you don't think Americans would want to do that you don't what we know that we know that Hannah can you find a picture of Nakula bass Lena Kula you know who I'm talking about folks remember on September 11th 2012 the anniversary of 9/11 a month and a half before the Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign there was a there was a terrorist attack on the US consulate in Benghazi and it was al-qaeda and that was inconvenient because Barack Obama had said we took care of al-qaeda Hillary Clinton said we took care of al-qaeda so what did they do they blamed it on some YouTube video where these were film critics angry angry at some but they did they blamed it on some YouTube video from someone in California and the media ran with it now that's a lie and politicians lie and when you're gonna do they're liars just a picture of Neda Coulibaly Nakula being jailed so there was a filmmaker I think he was Egyptian who made this film he's an anti Muslim dissident who came from a Muslim country we'll put the picture up when we see he was arrested in the United States on some trumped-up charge Hillary Clinton needed a scapegoat for Benghazi Barack Obama Susan Rice needed a scapegoat for Benghazi that was not al-qaeda they just needed to be able to weather the storm for six weeks show it on the screen now that's him producer of anti-islam film arrested ordered held without bail Nakula Bosley McCullough is let out of his Cerritos California home by Los Angeles County sheriff's officers on September 15th so do you understand what this is September 12th the Benghazi riots September 11th or the anniversary of 9/11 four days later here's the scapegoat a filmmaker in California thrown in jail in the United States of America so yeah that we should Tommy Robinson moment friends okay let me get back to things I see there's some more super chats let me I don't want to miss them because I appreciate you guys chipping in steam machine says donate to Tommy Google Tommy Robinson online email Sajid Javid here absolutely Tommy needs our help and I'll have some news later today about what we can do and what we can't do Achille 7:07 says slight correction protect the First Amendment with the Second Amendment yeah you're right but look at the Second Amendment look at how it's under the united states right now and howard how is the second amendment being defended the first amendment I guess the first in the second go hand-in-hand but that's another point that's another point do you think the police would have been so confident to scoop up a law-abiding profit protester like Tommy Robinson if the British citizenry excuse me citizenry were armed do you think it would be so casual and cavalier do you think British men would be walked over so easily by these rape gangs if they were armed and I tell you again when British men in Rotherham went to the homes where their sisters and daughters were being raped the police arrested those British men for if you had an armed citizenry in the United Kingdom I put it to you these rape gangs would not exist Bhoomi kins says do you think Britain has any chance of coming back will it ever be great again or was it already dead well as pope john paul ii would say with his life there's hope things look awfully bad in the Soviet Union didn't they until one day they didn't until people rose up the flame of Liberty was not quite extinguished where there was life there was hope I think things are quite bad in the anigh in the kingdom I I really hadn't been there I mean them once or twice in my life as a tourist until I met Tommy and then I would visit him every month or so and I would always come back shocked at what I had seen shocked I don't know if I told you the story think I told the story the other day when I went to Sunderland with Tommy Robinson to meet Chelsea right the young girl who was brutally assaulted by a predator the police sent a vehicle with closed-circuit TVs to check up on our meeting who's this guy from Canada's who flew in to meet with the Wright family and Tommy I'd never seen that before that really is police state stuff yes police station you heard the stories about the UK keeping out Lauren southern and Brittany Pettibone and Martin Sellner these are not violent people at all you know and and the letters for these people were their right wing well it's not against a lot to be right wing it that's what a political dictatorship says I believe in the right of a country to keep out anyone they choose for reasons of sovereignty but that that's not appropriate the United Kingdom is not a political state where they may measure a police state where they measure your politics before asking if you're allowed in very troubling let me remind you what we're doing here it's 1228 we're halfway done every day between 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time I hop on the show it's normally like hearted banter I show silly things that are too silly or trivial to make my 8 p.m. show I play some clips I have some banter I take some of the comments on the side here but it's not funny today I am not amused I am so on Friday I contacted the family I spoke with two family members of Tommy Robinson and I spoke with Tommy's lawyer and obviously you can understand I want to keep those conversations private I've had a number of exchanges with the family and the lawyer over the weekend and including this morning I do not want to reveal those because out of respect for the family in the process I don't want to meddle Tommy has a again I'm not Thomas boss anymore a year ago I was the minute I saw him arrested I felt I had the authority to act on his behalf and so we hired some of the top lawyers in the UK we crowdfunded the legal fund for it and we got Tommy out 13 hours later he didn't even spend a night in jail we had a proper hearing a week or two later we kept Tommy out you saw that rageous ruling though the judge said she was touring with putting him back in jail I don't have that authority now do I I'm Tommy's ex employer and he Tommy's incommunicado he's in prison he went straight from the courthouse steps to prison in a matter of hours I haven't spoken with him his family had trouble getting in touch with his lawyer his lawyer I imagine that that in Leeds the judge Samara took Tommy had a drumhead hearing instant gave him a lawyer who didn't know him didn't know his history was not an expert in content record law it is a very obscure area of law let me tell you we hired an expert is very rare no one does contempt of court law as a as a mainstay it's so rare and they just hire some just some public defender they give him to Tommy it's not even a fair trial they didn't even wait for his lawyer to land she was in an airplane I understand in that moment but here's the here's the icing on the cake the judge put his conviction of Tommy under a publication ban well I'm sorry the star chamber that was the Polish centuries ago you know I'm talking about the star chamber secret secret trousers there are no secret trials in the UK there are on occasion momentary prohibitions on publication if there's some extremely sense of reason if there are young people involved the identities of certain people are involved but Tommy is on a young person Tommy's matter is concluded why would Tommy's treatment and his 13 month sentence 13 months why is that covered by a publication ban in the UK and I related question where's the BBC where's channel 4 where is the Daily Mail where is the Times of London where's the Telegraph why aren't they going to court to have this to have this lifted where's reporters without borders where's Amnesty International I'm sorry tell me how Tommy Robinson is not a political prisoner reporting on a rape gang and I told you the told you the facts I saw he said alleged and accused he did not say they were convicted he did not step on the courthouse pretty since whatsoever he only read the names from a government website it was the last day of the trial was in fact the day of the verdict what possible reason was he convicted and sentenced to 13 months in prison what possible reason was it what we actually don't no do we I mean I've heard things secondhand but there is it is against the law to even inquire it's against law even to publish things so all these UK websites these new sites publish the news about Tommy's arrest and sentencing and then they took them down they took them down because of this court order I have some news about that I'm not quite ready to give it I'll send it out by email later today maybe I'll even hop on for a brief moment on Google ly but we will have some news let me hint at it you may know that the rebel is based here in Toronto Canada but you may not know that we also have a affiliate called rebel news network UK Limited that is a British company with British operations and British customers and I'll have some news later on today about the publication ban I'm just not ready to tell you right now it's 12:30 2 p.m. we have some ads but I don't want to run them I want to take some comments Andrei's test frame says Ezra you're amazing I love everything you do well thanks Andreas I wish I could do more here though I have to say when I saw Tommy look at the Cameron said George get a solicitor I thought I want to because we've got these three lawyers we lose he's last time Adam King was the contempt of court expert Jonathan Grimes the criminal law expert from Kingsley Napoli and mr. Kowalewski top-notch QC that's a bit of a dream team I think Tommy's case needs an adjacent l-3 team you know I mean if not now when I mean if Tommy's case is not of national importance enough when you when he ever gonna hire a dream team and we threw everything we threw three lawyers at it last time because I thought I'm not you know do we need three lawyers probably not am I gonna save 10,000 pounds and risk Tommy going to prison no way so I my instinct is but I'm not the decider am i I'm a meddler now I'm a friend friend and a fan but I'm I have no authority I have no instructions from Tommy he's in jail I have the family you know they know me I've met the missus and the fam a few times in the UK but I have no authority to act and you know Tommy's not with the rabble anymore we left on good terms but he's not with us and he has a lawyer can who is instructed by him or was I can't I can't take the place so I offered our help to crowdfund again and they said well let's talk to Tommy hold off hold off I love crowdfunding you know that's how we run the rebel this is sort of a form of crowdfunding right now what we're doing on super chair we've crowdfunding predominant before we crowd funded for Tommy's allies say Fletcher also in Sunderland the dinner lighting up north justice for Nikki the woman who was beat up we Chris eat help Chris the the Navy officer who helped Knox remember that Knox who needed a wheelchair we did a lot it that's what we do we crowd fund I said to the family I'm the crowd from the land he said wait wait wait don't do any crowdfunding we got to talk with Tom we've got to make sure this episode I'm not meddling my man like I'll talk to you more tonight about the court gag order them let me read another super chat if something happens this is from nerdy dev is something happens to Tommy in jail I believe there will be an uprising things are teetering on the edge they're making a martyr out of him well yeah that's that is sort of part of what's it called the Streisand effect isn't it maybe the case of Barbara Streisand didn't want a photograph of her Santa Monica property being put online or Malibu property and no one was looking at that picture was just an obscure picture online like maybe ten people had watched it but she went to court to have that taken down and because of that tens of thousands of people saw her property that's the Streisand effect sometimes when you try and attack something you give it much more attention than it would have I think that had Tommy not being arrested by the seven cops on Friday you know 100,000 people would have seen Tommy's report through Facebook but because of what they did to Tommy and the the shocking speed of it I'm sorry to take someone from detention arrest to prosecution hearing conviction sentence in prison and what was that for hours it isn't that what they called them what was the word in Spanish the Despero sea dose or something in Chile or or some of those Latin American banana republics where they would swoop in police state style and they would just be it would be disappeared I got to say I'm not going to call the the UK a police state but I tell you one thing if the surveillance state say another thing they're losing their civil liberties and I tell you a third thing you don't need me to tell you to take a man from political protest journalists to prison in a couple of hours without his lawyer there and put a gag order a secret gag order sorry that's not normal that's not normal and you know the Brits the Brits are being kept in the dark because of the gag order and CNN I haven't checked in the last three minutes CNN has ignored it Fox News did a story on it and look at this look at Drudge Drudge is always ahead of things put up this is the dredge report yesterday I don't know if it's still the lead item on the Drudge Report Drudge Report biggest news one of the biggest news sites in America anti-immigration protests for jailed in London judge orders press blackout Robinson silenced so this is the under news the dissident news I haven't seen anything in the mainstream news I have granted i-beam I have had my head down for a couple hours so maybe some example meantime and what I think is what most hopeful look at this sweet friend by Donald Trump jr. so this was as you can see this was yesterday morning Donald Trump jr. mmm he was retweeting Curt Schlichter who he works for their team Curt Schlichter was saying man arrested and imprisoned in England for reporting on a court case reporting on his case is also illegal just crazy and then Donald Trump jr. retweets out and adds reason 1776 for the original brexit don't matter merica fall in these footsteps that Donald Trump is good with the Twitter's 1776 obviously reference to the revolution and the original Braxton I think it's fair to say that the trumps are Anglo files the thing is a fact SATA can may not feel that way in return but I think a lot of Brits do they used to call the special relationship didn't they excuse me I'm hopeful if not if it's on the radar of Donald Trump jr. may maybe wouldn't be something wouldn't be something if the President himself tweeted retweeted just did something I think that would light a fire and it would frankly show up the cowardice of British politicians and here's the thing who's standing up who's standing up for Tommy Robinson the UK there is one member of the European Parliament you kept fella hanniger member's name there's this one mep who's been really chummy with tommy and i ne and builders gave a short speech outside the British Embassy in Holland but where is a single Conservative member of parliament in the United Kingdom where where's where's anyone I mean yes you're some of our gag but where where the politicians where are they fighting for Tommy and surely they must know if they come for Tommy today they'll come for them tomorrow you don't have to agree with everything Tommy says to agree with this right to say it you can disagree with every time thing Tommy says and disagree with his personal conduct I think the accusations against Tommy are always exaggerated the time I spent with them I every single preconception about Tommy he's seen the media's false you know I I don't want to get into the personal people around Tommy because you you say their name and then they get an Tifa or Muslim extremist come in their dorm well let me put it this way the very first day I met Tommy last year I flew into London this was right after the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge who's this guy with Tommy Tommy's here Kay I was having a meeting with Tommy who Tommy bring with him is as long as standing friends since grade school who happens to be a black man just by the way and I say that like the best friends I'm not going to give more personal details other than people say Tommy's racist he couldn't be less racist he's a Jew lover frankly and he gets flak from the fart Tommy burned a swastika flag is a symbol of his anti-fascist credentials one of the reasons Tommy left the EDL is he thought it was taking being taken over with too much racial animus I see Tommy correct people not in a politically correct way but just in a if people get rambunctious he's always careful about distinguishing between Isla and the doctrine and Muslims as people Tommy he's not politically correct he's not he's not a scold he's not a word policeman but anyone who says Tommy is a racist bone in his body they just don't know Tommy that's just a fact let me read some super chants I see here Craig McDonald Tommy Robinson has been sent to the Ministry of love and it's being whitewashed by the Ministry of Truth sad times we live in well yeah you're quoting phrases from George Orwell's 1984 how right he is I see another super chat from Shelley Korea for $20 canadian thank you very much I don't see a comment from you Shelley but if you I'll try and find one if you have one JG stoner says what can I do in the United States that goes beyond typing well listen I'm on I'm in a holding pattern a little bit here too because I want to what can I do what can I do well I know what I've done in the past I've helped quarterback illegal response I cannot do that because I do not have the authority to act on behalf of Tommy if he was still working for me I wouldn't have waited for anyone's permission because I'm I'm the boss but I'm not the boss anymore am I they're not even meeting with Tommy and I think it's bank holiday in the UK so I think they're did I'm meeting with him in jail until tomorrow how frustrating is that so I just as much as I want to help I'm worried it would be seen as meddling and and it probably is a form of meddling I want to do something and and I know I have a few tools I like using but maybe the family he doesn't want that maybe Tommy doesn't want that I don't know and so I'm not gonna step in unless I'm asked to step in right with the crowdfunding and and I certainly don't have the authority to hire lawyers or set the legal strategy for the family of course not right there is something I can do without Tommy's permission and without the permission of his lawyer or his family and I thought I would be in a position to make an announcement at this moment but I think it's going to take me about an hour or two I promise I'll put a video on it so if you are a subscriber to our rebel YouTube channel you'll see a notification I don't know if you click subscribe and notify I will have a announcement later today I already alluded to it I alluded to it before when I told you that we have a UK media company called rebel media so a rebel news network UK Limited and we have a UK company and that might give you a hint of what we're gonna do later today it's 12:40 3 p.m. I want to show you something that I didn't show before it's just a document this is the court-ordered publication ban so this is this is the the gag or hold it up on the screen I'm going to read from this notice to the press reporting restriction this this doesn't exist in the United States really in the Crown Court at Leeds Regina that's the Latin word for Queen versus Stephen Christopher Yaxley Lennon that's Tommy Robinson's legal name His Honour Judge Marcin QC made the following order under Section 4 sub 2 of the contempt of court act 1981 on the 25th of May 2018 it's funny since it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in this proceedings the publication of any report of these proceedings shall be postponed until after the conclusion of and then into trial numbers those are the underlying rape trials but hang on a second why is it that we can't talk about Tommy's case and just Tommy's case if there are some reasons why we cannot talk about the underlying rape gang trial there may be legitimate reasons but what are the reasons for not talking about what happened - tell me why that matter has concluded now has it not the man is in prison Tommy's name is notorious or famous however you want to phrase it there's no publication ban on Tommy no reason for that no privacy reasons why can we not talk about and why why are the British people being treated like they can't handle the truth your questions that I can't answer stitch mouth says we are worried about free Tommy in baton me and his mind and soul is more free than many of us in the UK that's a very philosophical points I suppose it's the difference between being alive and living I mean you can be you can have peace the peace of imprisonment right they there was peace in the Soviet Union for 70 years but it wasn't free Tommy lives life like a free man ought to I think that's that Lionheart I'm talking about Glenn Buxton I sent a message to the White House by a white house.gov slash contact to have the president help Tommy well I was really excited John Cardillo of our team and Chris lictor of our team we're really going to work over the weekend on Twitter and they are a couple degrees closer than me to the White House and you saw there that Donald Trump jr. retweeted Kirk Schlichter so I think it is working its way towards the center wouldn't that be amazing if Donald Trump tweeted about this Shelly Korea $20 chip in thank you very much this super chat business as you can see there are literally hundreds of all hundreds of comments there there's there's a lot of them there's some interesting one did Tommy have a defense lawyer yes he was assigned a defense lawyer by the court but that but Tommy is a complicated case he's got an enormous history with the courts he has a history with contempt of court he's a history I told you from Canterbury a year ago the lawyers that we had in Canterbury were excellent kovalevskaya forgot his first name tapenades QC very expensive Adam King excellent lawyer with a real focus on contempt of court and of course Jonathan Grimes the criminal lawyer that I'm gonna I'm not gonna call that a dream team because they're not like world-famous like OJ's dream team but that was a hell of a team yeah he didn't have that he didn't even have his regular lawyer Alison Gordon they gave him some lawyer some duty counsel public defender style Oh what's your name oh you're Tommy Robert Tommy and what are you here for like it and the trial was over in minutes in minutes a year ago we were given several weeks something was out on bail we were given weeks to prepare our lawyers have to prepare the case contempt of court is in a very obscure law it's not like a salt or traffic ticket that everything there's only certain basic rules and everybody knows that's what I mean by a drumhead trial just wham bam thank you man that is not that is not the justice the legal system conflated the Magna Carta even even the Star Chamber you know I mentioned that earlier Star Chamber is secret court even a Star Chamber had rules and had actually had high rules you had to have a lawyer in in the Star Chamber and it wasn't just some public defender I can tell you that all right let me check the time it's 12 48 what is this just for those who have joined us see we have 3500 people watching now welcome my name is Ezra Levant I'm the president of the rebel dot media we're based in Canada but we have operations in other countries in the world for about a year Tommy Robinson was our star journalist in the United Kingdom he left us earlier this spring to go independent and he left with our best wishes Tommy's quite a character and as I joked with him last time I met him he's not built to have a boss so it was amicable in fact I was chatting with Tommy by by email just a week ago he was asking if we would participate in a festival he called it to welcome Donald Trump to the United Kingdom he actually wanted to see if I don't even think I passed this honor he had Katie Hopkins who works for us he was he asked me to pass on to Katie Hopkins his invitation to participate in a festival for Donald Trump I am now deeply worried that Tommy Robinson will not be out of prison in time for Donald Trump's arrival and I'm deeply worried that he will be in prison for 13 months and I should tell you that when a man like Tommy Robinson goes to prison in the United Kingdom is akin to a death sentence because every Muslim criminal there wants to kill him they've got nothing else to lose they're already in prison for murder or terrorism and they will go to heaven and they will be a hero imagine being the hero of the prison the hero of British extremist Muslims the man who killed Tommy Robinson and so the alternative is for him to request to be put in protective custody aka solitary confinement no human being can live in solitary confinement for 13 months it will drive you mad in fact tommy was telling in one of his videos I was watching him again he was talking about how he's in solitary twenty three and a half hours a day can you imagine it's that's virtually sensory deprivation 23 and a half hours a day and and he's in solitary he was last time he's probably in solitary in Hull prison right now by request or he'd be killed all right I think there's some more let me see if there's some more super chats out there exlude X this is for you haters here stay strong and fight the good fight Jason Patric Richard please mr. president help Tommy Robinson checkpoint charlie what is the judge's name well we had it on the we had it on the the court order there it's you can see it judge Marcin let me make sure I'm reading that correct judge Marcin of Leeds so this was in Leeds which is in the north of England it's 450 this is a heavy show normally these daytime shows by me they're light we have silly clips almost found videos on the internet you know we had a big laugh the other day about Starbucks and their bathrooms really funny but it's not funny right now Tommy it's a handful and and he and I had our you know challenges over the years but he maintains them I maintain my view that he was the most important journalistic project we've ever done that the rebel was supporting him and I I am proud that we were a stepping stone for him to become an independent journalist that we pulled him Tommy I mean I don't think it's a secret to say when I contacted Tommy about a year and a bit ago he was doing home renovations this I was paying the bills and I said what do you make him doing that he told me I said we'll pay that not to do that come tell the world your story shortly thereafter there was the attack on the Westminster Bridge bridge Tommy was on the scene within men and it took off from there and I think Tommy's really found his groove and he likes to be independent I mean look at the guy of course he is he's not built to have a boss in Canada 2,000 miles away different time zones and you know we're corporate so I'm always worried about the legals I'm already well we serve so you know we said goodbye Tommy went independent with our blessing didn't stop me from being a fan and he wanted us to work with him on this Trump project God willing he'll get out we'll be able to do that but of course I care and I'm frustrated that I can't do more but there's no way in hell I'm gonna act without an invitation from his family his lawyer or Tommy himself I just don't want to meddle but later today I will have an announcement of what we can do with our company called rebel media rebel news network UK Limited a couple of quick super chats come in urethral grundles sorry to change the subject but I feel that all people need to I feel that all people need to know about rebel media have you made your bumper stickers free with shipping yet need to spread the word that's a great idea Yuri through thank you for that I think we're doing a retool of our store it's a little bit outdated and and I think we need to do that sorry we haven't mean of a speedy priority but I appreciate your reminder golf and guns the spineless UK government has sentenced a political prisoner to death free tell me yet tell me can you tell me the differences between what happened to Tommy and a political prisoner because I can't spot them Forza Italia aft that's an alternative for doors on brakes it freedom those are various parties that in in the EU that our freedom oriented a fifty dollar super Chad thank you from Steven T who is Tommy Robinson we are Tommy Robinson well that's the thing I saw some spontaneous rallies in London over the weekend and I see others being planned in other cities I think Tommy Robinson is bigger than these sensors in this judge believe I'm just making sure that I haven't missed any of the super chats I'm grateful for your support and your interest let's check the clock as 1253 for those who are only joining and I see this thirty five hundred people online now which is more we had at the beginning Justin can we play the clip of the actual arrests of Tommy just a recap for those who weren't with us in the first ten minutes others super quick recap Tommy Robinson formerly a rebel employee left us to go independent a few months ago was reporting outside the trial of an accused raping in the City of Leeds in the north of the UK tommy was standing outside the court not on court property Facebook live-streaming he did not say they were criminals he called them accused criminals he was not stepping on public property he was on the public sidewalk he read the names of the accused from the BBC the UK state broadcaster he showed he did nothing that I can tell that was against the rules of of the court and then suddenly after live-streaming from one hour this happened show the video doctor used to explain you hit diversity swishing closing the bridge sleepy what does that mean what direction Mahler what does that mean this is this is ridiculous let's do you feel what you're doing it I haven't said a word I eat the stock in fact someone laid their hand in the salt in the offside call I'll repeat with me about my mother nothing about Jorge there's a moment there when he says to the police how do you feel about what you're doing here that's a damn good question this network breach the peace breach the peace he was talking into his cell phone by himself on the street for an hour there's no one around him you said there was just that one lady in the red outfit and then there was George's cameraman that said they would buy themselves on the street that's part of the problem they were by themselves where was the mainstream media where's the BBC where was Channel four where was sky where his ITV were where were the news on a rape trial 29 people accused of raping again and again and again and again and again for years girls as young as 11 years old where the hell was the public there should have been a public there and they indeed should have been disturbed because what was going on in the court was quite disturbing Tommy was swept up literally hours from that videotape he was sent to prison for 13 months his lawyer his long-standing lawyer was not even informed he was given some duty counsel and I'm not disparaging the doodly counsel I'm just saying that Duty counsel did not know Tommy at all did not know the case and surely was not an expert in contempt of court law and to add insult to injury put the court ruling out the court order the judge who whisked Tommy off the streets and into prison for 13 months said no one in the United Kingdom can report on that well you know what I live in North American and bound by the censorship of UK laws we have a UK company and we will be taking a step later today I'm not quite ready to announce them sorry I will be ready within a couple of hours I think it's a sad state of affairs when people in the United States or France or wherever can learn more about what is happening to a British citizen and the British rule of law then can Brits will you not agree with me couple of super chats I'm gonna read them because it's already 1257 we're almost out of time a legit babyface says I honestly hope Tommy is going to be okay hope he gets a reduced sentence what all y'all do if y'all get the green light to help him out will you spend the same amount of money like you did last time well I want to answer that clearly because I said this earlier but you may have only joined it I will not be crowdfunding for Tommy unless I'm specifically asked to do so it is simply not my place I wish I could I enjoy crowdfunding we crowd fund for a lot of projects along the way but I'm not going to do so until the family or Tommy or his lawyer asked me to I just don't want to meddle it's not my place if tommy worked for me believe me we would be doing these things already there is no crowd fund that I'm aware of that has been authorized by Tommy other than his own website Tommy Robinson dot online if that changes I'll let you know there is something I believe I can do that I will announce a few hours I'm sorry I'm not ready with that news right now but I want to make sure I get everything right before I make a public announcement but thank you for your support I'm worried I'm worried that even a month in prison is deadly dangerous to Tommy now he can do a month in solitary I don't think any person can do 13 months in solitary and by god he doesn't believe he doesn't deserve to be in there for a day I tell you he has not broken any rule super chat by golf and guns Brits are not free their subjects of the crown and cannot speak their mind well listen we're subjects to the crown here to Queen Elizabeth is our queen in Canada too but we're not as far gone yet but we can be and I say to my American friends and I know there's Americans who love Tommy and Americans who discovered him in part because of his work with rebel and I'll always be proud of that we have a lot of alumni at the rebel people keep remind we have great talent with us right now in the UK Katie Hopkins is amazing in the u.s. I mentioned some names John Cardillo Curt Schlichter fred rob jim shock in washington with campus unmasked we have so much talent teaming up with tommy and sending him into the world journalism was something I will always be proud of and I'll always remember the cases he fought for and I'll always remember what he taught me that there's a great swath of the UK that Morrissey would call The Forgotten people nobodies nothing nobodies nothing's Tommy there was someone at Tommy and he fought for them in Word and in deed and I think it's time that all of us come to the aid of our man I wish I had a concrete step for you to do now I'm afraid that we'll have to wait until tomorrow after the family and the lawyer meets with Tommy in prison but I thank you for joining me today I'm sure I'll have more to say on this tomorrow and I will also later today announce what one small thing we are in a position to do given that we are a media company in the UK if I missed your super chat forgive me I'll there was just so many comments today we have over 3000 people watching it's the top of the hour 1 p.m. Eastern Time so I'm done for today I will also talk about Tommy on my 8 p.m. Eastern show you need to be a subscriber for that but I will go into similar detail and I'll probably have news about someone doing this afternoon if you don't want to subscribe to the show that's fine I will see you back here tomorrow 12:00 noon Eastern Time I believe that's 5 p.m. in Greenwich Mean Time 5 p.m. in London England and and I'll have more for you on this subject then if I have news from the family that I'm at liberty to share I will do so other than that it will do my best to respect their privacy Lord knows they're going through enough that's it from the rebel world headquarters here in Toronto Canada until tonight on our subscription show and tomorrow on these super chats goodbye and keep fighting for freedom you
