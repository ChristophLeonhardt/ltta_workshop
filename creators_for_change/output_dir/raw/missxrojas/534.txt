00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,269
1991 the year i was born and so I was

81
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,280
born with the shock of this event in my

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,910
mind and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 92 92</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy who did</font>

83
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,069
it was I think the Australian Prime

84
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,810
Minister and we give him the nickname

85
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,940
the lizard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> oz no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> touches the</font>

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,760
McQueen's back and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was so funny</font>

89
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,950
because it's all this kind of royal pomp

90
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,340
and circumstance that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down</font>

91
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,560
the drain it's great and then Gordon

Brown<font color="#E5E5E5"> our prime minister and the Queen</font>

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,639
have been in talks about changing the

94
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,700
succession which is horribly anti-woman

95
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,359
it basically is primogeniture in favor

96
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,880
of anyone being royal apart from a woman

97
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,620
and a woman as a last resort I mean it's

98
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,930
amazing that there have been women on

99
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,069
the throne<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if it's of the best</font>

100

<font color="#E5E5E5">Victoria a lot better than the Georgia</font>

103
