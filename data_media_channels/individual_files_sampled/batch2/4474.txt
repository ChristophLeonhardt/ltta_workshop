a man who's really doing well if you believe in polls I believe in pulse only the ones that have us up because they're the only honest you know they take these polls they show them I say that's can't be right if you look at the polls did the Senate everybody says we're doing very well but the house I think we're doing almost as well with regard to the house you know they call it a generic poll and actually the Republicans are doing well in the generic poll but I don't know that a generic poll means anything because their individual races the house that's President Trump last night talking about the polls first at that rally in Erie Pennsylvania then in a phone interview with Fox News and joining it's now national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC Steve Kornacki his excellent new book is the red in the blue the 1990s and the birth of political tribalism Steve good morning we love having you in the slaughter thank you we got some new polls including one just out a few minutes ago in Texas what does it tell you yeah new Ted Cruz beta O'Rourke Senate poll has Cruz up nine points from Quinnipiac 54 to 45 and again I think there been about a dozen polls now since Labor Day in that race only one of them has had beta or orc ahead it was a few weeks ago so Cruz I think just the totality of the polls clearly ahead out there yeah you look at the other states so let's look at Tennessee that's a well actually we looked at Tennessee yesterday and but Tennessee like Texas are critical for Democrats if Texas I've always been sort of an outside shot but there are a lot of these states like Tennessee that also seem to be slipping away from Democrats even that we have 26 states left anything can happen but let's look at let's look at a when we go to Nevada Heller was again he was supposed to be the the incumbent that was in the biggest danger but here we have another poll that actually shows him up to that's still in the margin of error but again more evidence that every Republican is doing better post Cavanaugh at least in the Senate yeah that's and that is the second Nevada poll in two days we had our own NBC mayor's poll that showed as you say the identical results so now you've got two polls out this week the one on your screen there's from the New York Times in Siena poll showing that two-point lead for Dean Heller a couple things when you start looking inside the numbers there in Nevada one of the things that power Democrats in the Obama era to some sizeable victories in Nevada was extremely strong support and extremely strong turnout from Hispanic voters in Nevada in that New York Times upshot poll not necessarily seeing that same divide also there was a new poll out yesterday down in Arizona poll from the ABC affiliate in Arizona significantly the first poll in Arizona since Labor Day to show martha mcsalley the Republican taking a lead in that race over Kyrsten Sinema the Democrat every poll since Labor Day besides this one it had cinema ahead their raises the question has there been a turn in Arizona that's similar to what we've seen in Tennessee potentially in Nevada potentially in other states or are we going to see more polls out of Arizona approve this one to be more of an outlier but again it would seem at least to fit into the trend of this week Republicans at least doing very well in these Senate polls and in a couple house polls as well so see if you put those together Tennessee Texas Nevada Arizona is there a theme with all fours a political gravity setting in in those states yeah I mean you're starting to you're starting to see the idea here of the Republican base the sort of latent Republican voter the Republicans have been trying to get them interested trying to wake them up and I think you're starting to see that in those numbers there the question we've been asking all week is this you know the Cavanaugh effect has been debated as does this last until Election Day because remember if you just that the course of this year there have been moments when it looked like Republicans were just headed for defeat in November but we're headed for epic defeat there have been moments when it's Perks back up Republicans I think I think it's safe to say Republicans have been getting some of their best polling news in the last week absolutely on the Senate side and even in some individual House races not necessarily the generic poll announced but some individual House races they've been getting very encouraging news but again three weeks from now what are we gonna be saying that becomes the question it's a lifetime especially in the age of Trump the NBC News Marist Poll checked in on the Senate races in Minnesota in the special election for Al Franken seed interim senator Tina Smith has a 16-point lead she's the Democrat of course while Democratic senator Ami Bashar is leading her Republican opponent by 30 points now with likely voters and it's looking slightly over the east in Wisconsin where Democratic senator Tammy Baldwin is holding strong in the Marquette University Law School poll she is up by 10 points in her bid for a second term while Republican Governor Scott Walker has the slightest of leads as he seeks a third term leading Democrat Tony Evers 47 to 46 last month ever was ahead by five points Jo so as you look at all these Jo from start to finish here what do you see well I see right now the Republicans getting a huge bump out of the Cavanaugh hearings I think a lot of Americans especially a lot of Republicans didn't like what they saw during that those hearings coming from from the Democratic side of the aisle but Rick Tyler I remember three weeks out that Donald Trump was down you know 10 11 12 points we bring it up all the time hear that that we were castigated on this set for even saying there still was a race in fact I said three weeks is a lifetime two weeks is a lifetime one week is a lifetime and the count down and that is the case so right now Republicans are looking pretty strong right now at this point in 2016 Hillary Clinton was looking pretty strong a lot can change in three weeks can't it it can't change a lot can change in three weeks Jo and it did in 216 it would be a little excuse me a little less hard in our pollsters in 216 I don't know that they all got it wrong I think we you know tracking the Electoral College made it difficult to predict that president Trump would be president because either he would have to essentially run the table but as Election Day approaches polls you know generally always tighten up Republicans are more reliable voters in the offseason but they weren't motivated and I agree with I agree with you that the the Cavanaugh hearings had a dramatically positive effect for Republicans and there and the reason is one it energized the Trump base but it also energized a lot of Republicans who aren't necessarily Trump supporters who might be looking for an alternative governing party and what they saw on the Senate Judiciary Committee with the abandonment of the presumption of the innocence on the Judiciary Committee which I think is in some ways disqualifying the Republicans said no or those those Republicans said no this is not the alternative we were seeking yet it certainly did seem to be like a motivator and as far as polls go in 2016 you are right a lot of the polls got it got it right Hillary Clinton ended up winning by two three percent almost three million votes and so Donny Deutsch things could tighten up I suspect they will tighten up and and we'll have another churn over the next one to three weeks but boy looking back assessing what went on during the Cavanaugh hearing so there is no doubt as somebody that you know studies branding there's no doubt that at least for Senate candidates the the Cavanaugh hearings were disaster for the Democratic Party I think that the numbers speak out but there's also one other number that just came in a latest political poll that the enthusiasm gap was you always point to is kind of to me detail and I agree with you is back up to about nine points in terms of the enthusiasm Democrats or the Republicans so that's a little bit of good news in but against those other numbers I think what you're seeing I think you there is this chest out bump that the Republicans they're they're feeling strong they're feeling successful but I do think over three weeks fear and anger will win out over satisfaction and I think what's also Republic which sways to the Democrats is fear and anger of what happened and what will continue to happen if there's no guardrail on Trump one interesting we working with the DNC what they've gone back to is their knitting and the message is health care health care health care they're going to take away your health care and I think the Democrats really realized as quick as they can turn the page on this and all the local races by our two to three to one margin the attribute the one issue that people more than the economy for the first time or voting on in health care and that plays to the Democrats which is the reason the Trump put all those falsehoods in the USA Today op-ed about health care Steve Kornacki thank you very much we'll see Morrow still had a bipartisan group of senators is calling for an investigation into the disappearance
