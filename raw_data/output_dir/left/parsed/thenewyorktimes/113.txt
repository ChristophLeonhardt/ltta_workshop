A weeping teenage girl
recently sat in front of
Iran’s state TV and made a
so-called confession. Her crime?
She danced to pop
music in her bedroom
and posted the recordings
on her Instagram account.
This young girl, 18-year-old
Maedeh Hojabri,
was arrested by
Iran’s security agents, hauled
in front of the
state broadcaster,
and forced to make
state-dictated
statements of remorse.
My name is Nazanin Boniadi
and I’m an Iranian-born
actress.
My parents were
political refugees
who fled to London in
the aftermath of the 1979
Iranian Revolution.
They didn’t want to
raise their daughter
in a social, political
and legal climate
that was growing increasingly
aggressive toward women
and girls.
I often wonder how
different my life
would have been if I’d
grown up without the freedom
to dance, sing and
perform as a little girl.
Thousands of Iranians
inside the Islamic Republic
and all over the world have
registered their disgust
at the humiliation
of this girl by posting
videos of themselves
dancing and singing
in solidarity with Maedeh.
This is only the
latest in a series
of acts of civil disobedience
against Iran’s
decades-long gender apartheid
and legalized misogyny.
Brave Iranian women
have disguised themselves as
men to enter sports stadiums
and they’ve publicly removed
their government-mandated
headscarves in peaceful
protest.
For many women,
the hijab has become
a constant reminder
of their inequality in Iran,
where women are forbidden
from becoming judges, let alone
president.
And a woman’s court testimony
and inheritance is half that of a man’s,
and a married woman needs
her husband’s approval
to work or travel.
Now we see a young girl, head
uncovered, joyfully dancing
at home,
forced to parade
herself in front
of the nation as a criminal.
This cultural
tyranny must end.
It’s not only peaceful dissent
that can land one in prison
in Iran.
People are told
what books they
can read, what movies
they can watch,
and what music they can enjoy.
Maedeh’s arrest shows
that Iran denies
even the most personal
and nonpolitical acts
of expression, a basic
and universal human right.
Humiliating a young girl
for her joyful acts of youth
is a disgrace.
The authorities tried to shame
a young girl, but instead
they have only shamed themselves.
It’s a moral imperative
that every world leader
stands with the Iranian
people and doesn’t ignore
their cries when shaking
hands with President Rouhani
or Foreign Minister Zarif
or any representatives
of the Islamic Republic.
It’s time to put
people before politics.
Human dignity is
not negotiable.
