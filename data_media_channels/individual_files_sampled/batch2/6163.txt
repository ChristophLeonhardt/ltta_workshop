it is Martin Luther King Day my favorite day of the year I love Martin Luther King he's my hero my role model we got an MLK shirt on right here oh yeah that's from shaft uit they tell me it's 30% off today is it just today well you gotta I guess you got a panic attack today okay we've also got other shirts I may I asked for these shirts even though people were like really who's gonna read a giant quote from Martin Luther King on your shirt and my argument is everyone okay I do from time to time yes it says we must straighten our backs and work for our freedom and man can't ride you unless your back is bent okay no no Ben thank you yes goddamn right I love Martin Luther King yeah we've got a couple of those quotes at shop T y-t-dot-com and the thing that I'm gonna say two more things about my on the game then we got a hell of a show for you guys today but one is I can't I can't I can't get past not only what a great brain he had but what a great heart he had so I I would argue the Martin Luther King is the best at let alone fighting for freedom and civil rights for everyone but the the best at giving speeches that I have ever heard ever ever ever it's possible that in the history of humanity some people gave the speech in Spanish or in Lithuanian that I didn't hear and they were better than Martin Luther King but it of all the ones that I have ever read or seen Martin Luther King is head and shoulders above everyone else but even that is not his number one trait and I talk about this often he said we don't go down to the South just to liberate african-americans from the plight that they are in we go to liberate the white racists from the hate in their heart because it's killing him God that is so thank Natomas I can't I can fathom the speeches I cannot fathom a heart that large and so yeah I know I know and I gotta be honest with you that's not what we do from time time we do it but I don't obviously I'm not that good a man we company kick ass and and fight the aggressors but but he was better than that and and just you cannot respect a man enough and so hats off to him obviously on today showing and always but the second thing is I also feel as he said in one speech sometimes I get discouraged but there is a balm for the sin sick soul so we are looking for that bomb and and and that we believe that we will find it for the country and that our sin sick soul which is in it's among its darkest hours today with Trump in office a deeply racist president in office in the year 2018 that we will find it we will find that cure and we'll bring the country back to the vision that Martin Luther King had you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
