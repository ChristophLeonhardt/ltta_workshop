senator grassley do you know how this votes going to go today I think it'll be very successful you know that for a fact at this point in fact if you would talk to the leader he would say something like he told us Perry's most of the time like maybe 99% of the time well you know how the votes burn the goal before it goes this is one vote that we probably won't know until the votes are actually cash Wow that is what the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley told NBC's Casey hunt moments ago joining us now from Capitol Hill Republican member of the Judiciary Committee Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana senator thank you for being on Joe has the first question yes senator curious if how Republicans are feeling about Brett Cavanaugh's vote that's coming out does Mitch McConnell and does the caucus believe they have enough votes to move for the final vote tomorrow I can only give you my opinion Joe I don't know my hunch is that we have the votes but that's just a hunch I think senator Grassley was correct when he said we won't know for sure until the votes counted but I feel like you judge Cavanaugh be confirmed I think it'll be close obviously you've been worried from time to time over the past year and a half about the judiciary wanting to make sure that people get put on the judiciary weren't just put there for political reasons wanted to make sure that they actually had the experience and the temperament to be federal judge and you've let the White House know that and the judiciary know that even when the White House may not have appreciated it wondering what your thoughts are today after two weeks of a circus just a brutal fight stakes couldn't be higher and what concerns do you have moving forward regardless of how this vote turns out well a couple of things if you look at judge Kavanagh his body of work is 307 opinions I haven't read all of them but I've read most of them and his my review articles I'm convinced that he's a very qualified number two I take away from this that the the confirmation process really is a mess it needs to be cleaned up it's gotten so bad at times I if our founders had envisioned this some might have voted to stick with King George I mean it's just a mess and it's got to be addressed number number three I felt the anger of mostly women who have been sexually harassed and it's something that the American people want to choose us to deal with we should deal with it I think we have to be very careful some of my colleagues believe that you're morally tainted if you don't automatically believe the accuser every time I don't agree with that I think you're morally tainted if you don't treat the accuser and the accused with respect and fairness and due process now I've said before a sexual sexual assault is prevalent in this country I didn't realize it I've talked to many of my friends about it happen to be women and I say you know I didn't I'm shocked and they say well what planet did you just parachute in from it exists has to be dealt with this is no country for creepy old men but at the same time it's no country at all without due process and people are entitled to a fair treatment on both sides and I think I think I hope we've learned something from this exercise what about judge Kavanagh is temperament obviously you've read through his opinions he breakthrough Law Review articles you see that as a judge he certainly has the qualifications what about the temperament and we're gonna play you a clip in a moment of what judge Kavanagh told students back in 2015 about being nonpartisan but it hasn't talked about staying calm in the eye of the storm do you believe the judge Cavanaugh after last week has the judicial temperament to sit on the United States Supreme Court yes and and I two points number one I've talked to and listen to his law clerks I used to clerk for a federal judge the person who spends the most time with the federal judge is his or her law clerks and they know him well and to a person they testified to me and I've heard them on interviews even handed in fair-minded years but number two look at the context judge Cavanaugh has been called a rich lying drunk sexual predator and he took offense to that and he responded in a very forceful and I think human way and I don't hold that against him well mmm you know you saw him with your own eyes senator at the hearing and here is his description of how a judge should be back in 2015 listen to his words mm-hmm to be a good judge and a good umpire it's important to have the proper demeanor really important I think to walk in the other's shoes whether it be the other litigants the litigants in the case the other judges to understand them to keep our emotions in check to be calm amidst the storm on the bench to to put it in the vernacular don't be a jerk I think that's important to be a good umpire and a good judge don't be a jerk so from what you saw in the opening statement of the very emotional hearings did he meet that standard in my opinion yes if you consider the circumstances and what he said is absolutely right I know federal judges you do too some of them have partisan he brought up the Clintons he was a little one would at one might say that he was kind of a jerk to senator Amy Klobuchar and he was extremely defensive and emotional everything that he said in that speech I I don't think I saw the same thing you did I saw someone who failed at every standard that he laid out there well I think yeah again you have to consider the context he had been called once again it was a some call it a character assassination I know some people think it's accurate I don't they called him a liar they called him a drunk they called him rich they called him a sexual predator it affected as it did dr. Ford's his family his parents his reputation and the man responded I do think it's important the judges have the proper demeanor I know some federal judges some some were fine others can strut sitting down I mean they get on the bench and they become all of a sudden Imperial and they're there for life and you don't want a federal judge like that I don't think Kavanaugh has ever been like that I listened to his his opening statement I'm listening dr. Ford's opening statement I was there every minute and I can tell you at the end of the day there were no winners in that room I saw were two people in pain and it could have been avoided because the confirmation process that let the American people and them down there haven't been very many Alexander Hamilton's throughout this whole moment I haven't thought this whole episode I haven't seen many legal monthly Lincoln moments in this whole one experience senator Kennedy it's willie geist good to see you again this morning you said yesterday after having read the report the report is thorough I'm convinced judge Cavanaugh is innocent of the charges made against them but you also said something to one of our producers up on Capitol that said I really wish you could see this I really wish you could read the report there are things in there that really make me angry what was it in there that made you angry senator I can't tell you I wish I could I think we're making a big mistake not releasing this report I think the American people have a right to read it and draw their own conclusions it's a decision by the White House and the Attorney General senator Feinstein senator Grassley with all respect I think they're wrong I know normally a background investigation is not released for privacy reasons but this is not a usual circumstance there were five witnesses interviewed for judge Cavanaugh four for miss Ramirez the fifth one is Ramirez didn't want to talk these witnesses all identified by either miss Ramirez or dr. Ford as people who could corroborate their allegations none of the witnesses corroborated the allegations and you can if you read this report and I really wish you could you could say there were some politics involved did the report lead you to believe senator the judge Kavanaugh had been falsely accused by dr. Ford I'm not gonna say that I think he well let me put it another way I trust American people to make their own decisions and conclusions I've reached mine I don't mean Judge Kevin all did it I'm not saying that dr. Ford and miss Ramirez aren't telling the truth I don't know them I'm just telling aren't you by definition saying they're not telling the truth you don't believe I did it you could you could make that argument but when it's a he said she said or he said he said or she said she said circumstance you have to look at the corroborating evidence if there is any and there's none here whether there's none yet every witness and these were all witnesses identified by the the folks making the allegations did not corroborate and I know that dr. Ford's counsel have made a big deal about her not being interviewed but the FBI asked dr. Ford's counsel to submit additional evidence and they refused they refused to submit anything senator Susan Dell / Co here you said at the top that this whole process is a mess and should this vote go down on party lines I think it will be very difficult for Americans not to look at the Supreme Court as a political body and that an interest that they're doing not doing things along party lines since this process has been such a mess would you and maybe some of your colleagues think about going back to 60 votes which would require consensus and perhaps take away some of this partisanship I'm sure that's where things we'll talk about would you support it though I don't know yet I need to get a little distance from this to try to decide how to fix this mess I just know we've got two choices we can ride the anger or we can solve the problem I know but clearly we've got a problem I will say I think the American people unfortunately thought the Supreme Court was political even but even before this freak show that we just went through people unfortunately think of the Supreme Court is a mini Congress but they're not and they shouldn't be and it's something we need to work on part of that as a fault of Congress Congress will not take part votes make difficult decisions I hear it every day well we can't vote on that we can't vote on that I can't take that vote and so a lot of the difficult issues in American life and socio-economic policy had been bucked with the US Supreme Court and that's not the what I founders intended in my judgment senator noah rothman just to tag on Susan's question if Joe Manchin declines to vote with the majority and it is a party-line vote does Justice Kavanagh have a legitimacy the problem and by extension the Supreme Court I think I think in light of this episode both judge Kavanaugh and dr. Ford their lives will never be the same I don't think in the long run it will hurt judge Cavanaugh I have confidence that he will be a good justice I do think he has the right demeanor and I have read all if or at least most of his body of work but the longer term implications upon the US Supreme Court is an institution that's something we've got to work on there's no question about it but it was a problem even before this confirmation Fiasco American people believe the Supreme Court is a mini Congress it's not it's not supposed to be and we've got to work through hard to try to fix that and a lot of look that fault lies with Congress all right so John Kennedy thank you we appreciate your opinion thank you very much up next no matter what happens with judge Cavanaugh it is undeniable that the me2 movement played a role in how this nomination fight played out we'll talk to a pair of journalists who have covered these issues as closely as anyone keep it right here on Morning Joe thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
