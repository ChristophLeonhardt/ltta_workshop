CLIFTON.
ALL RIGHT, KENNEDY, THIS IS YOUR
KIND OF TOPIC.
YOU GO FOR IT.
>> I AGREE WITH WHAT CANDACE
OWENS SAID ABOUT EDUCATION.
THE FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES WITH
THOUGHT SUPPRESSION START
YOUNGER THAN COLLEGE.
THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO FIND
THEIR PASSIONS.
WE DON'T HAVE REAL SCHOOL CHOSE
IN THE COUNTRY.
WE RELY ON A VERY OUT DATE --
OUTDATED METHOD CONTROLLED BY
UNIONS AND PARENTS ARE DISTANCED
FROM HELPING THEIR KIDS LEARN.
WITHIN THAT DISTANCING AND LACK
OF ACTUAL SCHOOL CHOSE IN THE
COUNTRY YOU SEE A LACK OF
CURIOUSTY.
THEN THEY GO TO COLLEGE.
I DON'T SHARE YOUR BLANKET
OPTIMISM THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WILL
START THIS REVOLUTION BECAUSE I
FRANKLY THINK NOT ONLY HAVE THEY
GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF PRIVACY BUT
THEY ALSO, IT'S LIKE A STRANGE
CULTURAL THING ABOUT NOT
CULTURAL THING ABOUT BOT
CULTURAL THING ABOUT BEING TOLD
WHAT TO DO.
>> IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO,
FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE LIKE US.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO
CORRECT US.
>> THE SCHOOL CHOSE POINT IS
VITAL.
THAT'S A POLICY SOLUTION WE CAN
PURSUE.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN GET
THEM MORE FREEDOM LOVING.
>> FIGHT LIKE HELL, TALK TO YOUR
KIDS.
IT'S CRITICAL WE CONTINUE TO
PARENT AND DON'T RELY ON
SCHOOLS.
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE TO HAVE THE
DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR KIDS.
NOT JUST ABOUT SEX, DRUGS, AND
AND INDIVIDUALISM AND FIGHTING
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE FORM OF
MIND CONTROL WE PROJECT ON OUR
KIDS SOMETIMES IN SCHOOLS THERE
IS A BIT OF A GULF AND WE HAVE
TO FIGHT AT THAT LEVEL AND TEACH
THEM TO BE WARRIORS FOR FREEDOM
AND THOUGHT.
STEVE: THERE YO GO, I AGREE.
MARJORIE AREN'T YOU EMBARRASSED
WITH THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
BECOME SO INTOLERANT.
>> I DON'T OWN WHAT ANY PERSON
IS OUT THERE DOING OR SAYING
REGARDLESS OF PARTY.
WHAT WE ARE MISSING IS
SUVILLITY.
WE ARE LACKING EMPTY.
THAT MEANS THE ABILITY TO NOT
JUST LOOK AT THINGS FROM OUR OWN
PROSPECTIVE BUT SEE THEM FROM
MANY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEORIES OF
THOUGHT.
CANDACE LAID OUT HER OWN IDEAS
WHAT THE POLITE OF THE BLACK
COMMUNITY IS AND THEIR
CHALLENGES TODAY.
ONE BLACK PERSONS EXPERIENCE IS
NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER.
JUST LIKE ONE WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE
IS NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER.
WE ENDANGER OURSELF WITH WHERE
WE ARE CULTURALLY IN THIS
WARFARE.
WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING OUT WITH
VERY BLATANT IDEAS WITH THE WAY
THE WORLD WORKS.
THIS DISREGARD A LOT OF OTHER
PEOPLES EXPERIENCES.
FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL MEANS WE
ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR
ACTIONS AND WORDS AND BELIEFS
IMPACT ALL OF US.
THE FREEDOM IS TO HAVE OUR OWN
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS
THE FREEDOM IS TO HAVE OUR OWN
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND SAVILITY.
>> TY.
STEVE: YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING.
IF YOU DEAR EXPRESS A POINT OF
VIEW OUT OF LINE YOU ARE SHOUTED
DOWN.
HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?
>> I AGREE THAT'S NOT A
PRODUCTIVE WAY FOR US IN THIS
COUNTRY TO BE APPROACHING
ANYTHING.
I ABSOLUTELY I SEE IT ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE I'LL.
YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH WHAT KANYE
SAID AND NOT INSULT HIM AT THE
SAME TIME.
YOU CAN HAVE DISCOURSE AND
CONVERSATION AND EXCEPT AND
UNDERSTAND AND FIND A SOLUTION
TOGETHER.
WE'LL BE IN THE SAME THING RIGHT
NOW.
THAT'S WHAT THE EXCITEMENT
AROUNDTRUM.  WAS AND IS.
HE TAPPED INTO SOMETHING PEOPLE
WEREN'T LISTENING TO IN THE
COUNTRY.
43% OF AMERICANS DON'T HAVE $400
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY THERE IS
SOMETHING REAL HAPPENING.
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE
THINGS HE DOES THAT LEAVE OUT
ANOTHER AREA OF THE COUNTRY OR
MAKE PEOPLE EITHER MINORITIES
SOCIOECONOMIC PEOPLE FEEL LEFT
OUT.
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT.
KENNEDY, TO WRAP IT UP THE WAY
ANY KIND OF DEVIATION FROM THE
ORTHODOXY MEANS YOU CAN'T HAVE
THE CIVILITY.
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S UNREAL.
THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT
BLAMED TRUMP SUPPORTERS FOR
BEING RACIST AND SEXIST.
SHE CALLED THEM A BASKET OF
DEPLOYABLES AND RELIED ON
IDENTITY POLITICS TO GET HER
ELECTED.
>> IT DIDN'T GET HER ELECTED.
>> I'M NOT DONE.
>> SORRY.
>> HANG ON ONE SECOND.
YOU JUST MADE A HUGE
CONTRADICTION.
YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON SAYING
THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL
FOR WOMEN WHO DON'T SUPPORT EACH
OTHER.
YOU HAVE TO THINK AS A GROUP, AS
A CLUSTER.
YOU HAVE TO SAY WE HAVE TO HAVE
EMPTY FOR OUR INDIVIDUAL
EXPERIENCES BUT WE CAN'T JUST
RELY ON INDIVIDUALS AND
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT.
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T BUY IT BECAUSE
WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD EMPATHY.
>> I DO MEAN IT.
