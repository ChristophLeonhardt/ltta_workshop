00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,411
DEVICE THAT WAS FOUND AT GEORGE SOROS’S HOME A FEW DAYS AGO, IF

21
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:44,878
SOROS’S HOME A FEW DAYS AGO, IF YOU REMEMBER.

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,880
YOU REMEMBER. THEY’RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT,

23
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,281
THEY’RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT, ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT IT’S

00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,223
FACT IT WAS AN ACTUAL DEVICE OR IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT’S MORE

27
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,224
IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT’S MORE OF A HOAX.

28
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,959
OF A HOAX. NOW, OBVIOUSLY THE CLINTONS

29
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,127
NOW, OBVIOUSLY THE CLINTONS DON’T RECEIVE MAIL THE WAY THAT

30
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,631
DON’T RECEIVE MAIL THE WAY THAT PERHAPS YOU AND I DO, WHICH IS

31
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,533
PERHAPS YOU AND I DO, WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE MAIL SCREENERS

32
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:07,634
THAT THERE ARE MAIL SCREENERS AND IT ISN’T SOMETHING WHERE YOU

33
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,002
AND IT ISN’T SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN JUST WALK UP TO THEIR HOUSE

34
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:10,804
CAN JUST WALK UP TO THEIR HOUSE AND PUT A PACKAGE IN THEIR

35
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,106
AND PUT A PACKAGE IN THEIR MAILBOX OR LEAVE IT ON THEIR

36
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:13,640
MAILBOX OR LEAVE IT ON THEIR DOORSTEP.

37
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,108
DOORSTEP. AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL THREAT TO

38
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,444
AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL THREAT TO THE CLINTONS THEMSELVES,

39
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:18,545
THE CLINTONS THEMSELVES, TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE LIMITED IN

40
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,479
TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE LIMITED IN SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SHIPPED

41
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,749
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SHIPPED OVER THE MAIL, OR A PACKAGE THAT

42
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:24,151
OVER THE MAIL, OR A PACKAGE THAT WOULD BE DELIVERED.

43
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:25,819
WOULD BE DELIVERED. WITH THAT SAID WE’RE REALLY

00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,760
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT IF, IN FACT, IT IS THE SAME TYPE OF DEVICE

49
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:36,197
IT IS THE SAME TYPE OF DEVICE THAT WAS FOUND AT GEORGE SOROS’S

50
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,566
THAT WAS FOUND AT GEORGE SOROS’S HOME, AND IF, IN FACT, IT

51
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,901
HOME, AND IF, IN FACT, IT CONTAINED EXPLOSIVE POWDER AS

52
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:41,068
CONTAINED EXPLOSIVE POWDER AS THAT DEVICE DID.
