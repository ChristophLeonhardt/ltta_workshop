US defense secretary James mattis has said that his country has no actual evidence that a chemical attack took place in the Syrian city of Douma at the weekend I believe there was a chemical attack and we're looking for the actual evidence the the OPCW this the organization for the Chemical Weapons Convention we're trying to get those inspectors in if we get them in if the regime will let them in we will not know who did it they can only say that they found evidence or did not any more than that development in the past I will now Calum opens with us hi there again took us through what we've learned from these comments yes that was Secretary of Defense James Madison he was speaking before the US Armed Services Committee before the Congress now it's unclear exactly how they can talk a military action if they at this point do not yet have evidence to confirm that a chemical attack took place now it is common for Western politicians to say that that because there's been a history of allegations against the Syrian government that somehow this proves it but it's interesting mattis explained where these conclusions come from as well this is mattis before the Congress there have been a number of these attacks in many cases you know we don't have troops were not engaged on in the ground on the ground there so I cannot tell you that we had evidence even though we certainly had a lot of media and social media indicators that either chlorine or sarin were used now furthermore he seems to indicate that that he does not need and the Department of Defense does not need the permission of the US Congress in order to carry out these strikes he said that essentially they can carry them out and then they will report to Congress after they carry them out if if they do indeed carry out strikes now it's interesting he said it's not simply the use of chemical weapons that would be a justification for a strike but it's the threat that perhaps US personnel that are on the ground could be possibly hit with chemical weapons that in itself is a justification for a strike it's Vegh furthermore he seemed to indicate as if Russia were somehow trying to block the OPCW from reaching Syria and inspecting the site when in reality Russia has works to facilitate the chemical experts and inspectors in the country they've offered to provide military protection and the Syrian government has been totally open and willing to allow the inspectors to go wherever they need to go in order to do their work so that's kind of a distortion of the situation now at this point Trump is sending a variety of different messages we saw him tweeting out get ready Russia but now we see him saying that they're there the possibility of attack could come very soon or not soon at all so Trump is sending out a lot of different messages now we took through the streets of New York and asked New Yorkers how they interpret Donald Trump's various tweets regarding Syria and Russia in the last few days this is what New Yorkers said about how they interpret the different messages from Donald Trump Trump's Twitter page grabs the attention of the world but when Trump tells Russia to get ready for American missiles then calls for a stop to the arms race then blames the Democrats for bad relations with Moscow the world starts to get a little bit confused we decided to ask New Yorkers what they think about the president's social media activity what order do you think they came out in bottom one first top one second and middle one last actually it was that one was first that one was second that one was third Russia vows it I'll say this is first me you're correct that is the first one awesome okay second one would be this much of the Bab lip nope man so our relationship with Russia verse now yeah and then much of the okay got it I'm thinking one two three but votes order actually it's one two three uh-huh if you were in Russia if you were like in the Russian Foreign Ministry how would you react to this what how would you interpret it I would take it very seriously you know it's a strong nation and if something is perceived wrong it's going to be scrutinized those seem inconsistent to you it's real inconsistent it goes back and forth so you can't tell what he's thinking honestly you got places like the NBA and the NFL telling players not to tweet during the game and that's something small then obviously you know as president of the United States are tweeting about you know stuff like this it's not gonna not gonna fly it doesn't work if I was in Russia I would say that USA Donald Trump is being tough it's a tough situation over there in Syria right now but so far he hasn't let us down yet so I'm okay I'm okay with it looking at Trump's tweets it's not exactly clear where he stands but with lives hanging in the balance and geopolitical tension on the rise there are probably lots of people out there who wish that Donald Trump could articulate things just a little more clearly caleb Maupin RT New York
