experts from the OPCW chemical weapons watchdog are expected to arrive in the Syrian town of Duma in the next few hours the probe will look into the allegations of a chemical attack that emerged on April the 7th meanwhile more doubts have been raised over this footage filmed by the white helmets group in a local hospital the video claims to show the aftermath of the chemical attack but our sister channel RT Arabic visited that very Hospital in Duma and talked with the doctors and the locals they described what happened on the 7th of April claiming they saw no toxic agents being used we also to learn people from the white helmets told us about the use of chemical weapons but we saw no sign of that if chemical weapons were used against those people our medical staff would have also been affected people poured water of our heads repeating that we had been attacked with chemical weapons somebody ran up from outside shouting about a chemical attack don't know who that was we heard an explosion and somebody said it was a chemical weapon we ran to where the noise came from and started pouring water over the people but they seemed to be okay and then walked away without any help so confused somebody started pouring water over people's heads saying there had been a chemical attack by was at the spots with my wife and daughter but none of us experienced any symptoms of chemical poisoning meanwhile even some Western media outlets and are calling into question the allegations of a chemical attack that's after British journalist Robert Fisk visited the hospital and spoke with the doctors there and found absolutely no evidence of the use of any chemical weapons however those who still have no such doubts are Washington and its allies the US Britain and France chose not to wait at all for the official investigation before launching air raids against Syria in the early hours of Saturday the US State Department spokesperson Heather now it said Washington's decision not to wait was justified the OPCW is something that we back strongly but it can also take quite a bit of time for the OPCW to gather its information and compile a report so I would ask you should the United States and her allies wait around for Bashar al-assad to use more chemical substances on his people should we wait around for that formal investigation that can take months and months this is you know actually scandalous that the US has launched a strike based on insurgent tide social media sources well this is exactly what defense secretary Jim mattis said at a briefing several days ago where he didn't have solid intelligence on any chemical attack in Douma what he did have were social media reports people saying stuff on the internet and who were those people the same people that State Department spokesperson Heather now it's referring to there the Syrian White helm which has been funded to the tune of at least 23 million dollars by the State Department
