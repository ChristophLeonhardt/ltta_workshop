MEDIA BIAS EXPOSED.

5
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:13,854
IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE

LEFT-WING MEDIA HATES

STORY MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM ARE

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,628
GROTESQUELY IRRESPONSIBLE

10
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,330
EXAMPLES YET.

OR STOPPING A LOT OF THEM.

YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD

23
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:44,151
THESE PEOPLE ARE.

24
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:47,421
THESE AREN'T PEOPLE.

25
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,222
THESE ARE ANIMALS.

26
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:50,224
WE ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF THE

27
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,426
COUNTRY AT A LEVEL AND RATE

28
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,362

ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

THE MORNING PAPERS FLAT OUT

OUTRAGEOUS REPORTS.

IN.

50
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:33,901
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MS-13

51
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,636
AND ALSO IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE

52
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:36,303
BIT FURTHER ON THE TAPE, YOU

53
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:42,610
WILL SEE WE HAVE LAWS.

54
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,612
ONE MS-13 COMES IN AND OTHER

55
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:46,814
GANG MEMBERS COMING, I REFER TO

56
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:47,581
THEM AS ANIMALS.

57
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,616
GUESS WHAT.

58
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:49,417
I ALWAYS WILL.

59
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,052
WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT BY THE

60
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:51,852
THOUSANDS.

61
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:54,955
IT'S A BIG DANGEROUS JOB, AND

62
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:57,258
THEY ARE ABLE IN SOME CASES TO

63
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:00,027
COME BACK AND OR NEW GROUPS COME

64
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:01,829
IN, ALSO FROM THE GANGS.

65
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,330
>> Jesse: SARAH SANDERS

66
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,633
ISSUING THIS EPIC TAKEDOWN OF

67
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,901
THE LIBERAL TRUMP HEATING MEDIA.

68
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,136
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS CLEARLY

69
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:11,672
REFERRING TO MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.

70
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:14,408
THEY ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY

71
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,042
AND WHOSE DEPORTATIONS ARE

72
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,445
HAMSTRUNG BY OUR LAWS.

73
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:20,448
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS

74
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,716
AND DEADLY GANGS THAT OPERATE BY

75
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:30,424
THE MOTTO OF "RAPE, KILL,

76
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:31,392
CONTROL."

77
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,427
I DON'T THINK THE TERM THE

78
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:36,597
PRESIDENT USE WAS STRONG ENOUGH.

79
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:38,632
MS-13 HAS DONE HEINOUS ACTS.

80
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:40,468
IT TOOK AN ANIMAL TO STAB A MAN

81
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:46,607
100 TIMES, RIPPED HIS HEART OUT.

82
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,609
IT TOOK AN ANIMAL TO KIDNAP,

83
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,378
DRUGGED AND A 14-YEAR-OLD

84
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,246
HOUSTON GIRL.

85
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,047
I THINK THE TERM ANIMAL DOESN'T

86
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,382
GO FAR ENOUGH.

87
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,051
>> Jesse: DAY NOW, THIS IS

88
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:57,985
DEVASTATING FOR THE MAINSTREAM

89
00:02:57,985 --> 00:02:58,619
MEDIA.

90
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,421
THIS WASN'T A FEW OUTLETS.

91
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:04,992
THESE WERE THE BIGGEST, MOST

92
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:05,860
CREDIBLE MEDIA COMPANIES OUT

93
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,594
THERE BOTCHING THING THAT'S

94
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,829
PRETTY SIMPLE.

95
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,198
>> Dana: IT GREW BECAUSE OF

96
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:11,632
SOCIAL MEDIA.

97
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,935
I REMEMBER THERE WERE TIMES

98
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:16,637
WHEN, AND EDITOR HERE IN

99
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:18,372
NEW YORK WOULD WRITE A HEADLINE

100
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:19,106
OR CHOOSE A PHOTO THAT WAS OUT

101
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:21,142
OF CONTEXT AND YOU WOULD HAVE

102
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:22,910
WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS OR LET'S

103
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,645
CALL IT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS

104
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:25,079
HYPOTHETICAL.

105
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,080
THEY WOULD CALL UP AND SAY

106
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,414
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING.

107
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:28,549
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS DOING.

108
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,252
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

109
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:31,952
POSSIBLY COULD'VE HAPPENED BUT

110
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:35,022
IT CAN HAPPEN SOON ENOUGH.

111
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,357
SOME OF THE OUTLETS LIKE THE AP

112
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:39,627
DELETED THE TWEET WHICH IS

113
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:41,028
BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT IT DOES

114
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:43,797
SHOW YOU THAT IMMEDIATELY THEY

115
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:48,269
HEARD "ANIMAL" AND "IMMIGRANTS,"

116
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,204
I MAY PUT IT TOGETHER WITHOUT

117
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:50,538
CONTEXT.

118
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:54,275
I WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT IT,

119
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:58,679
THE PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE.

120
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:01,015
ED GILLESPIE WHEN HE WAS RUNNING

121
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:03,117
FOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, ONE OF

122
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,619
HIS ISSUES WAS MS-13.

123
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:06,253
"THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD

124
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:06,854
SEVERAL HEADLINES.

125
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,156
IF WE HAVE THEM, WE CAN SHOW YOU

126
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:09,557
IF WE HAVE THEM, WE CAN SHOW YO

127
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:10,124
YOU.

128
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:14,228
BASICALLY DESCRIBING ED AS A

129
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,829
RAPIST, POISONOUS.

130
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,697
A MONTH LATER

131
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:18,399
"THE WASHINGTON POST" ALL OF A

132
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,202
SUDDEN HAD A CHANGE OF HEART

133
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,404
ABOUT MS-13 IN THEIR HEADLINES.

134
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:24,205
AFTER ED GILLESPIE LOSES THEY

135
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,639
TALK ABOUT HOW I MISS 13 IS

136
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,074
TERRIBLE.

137
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:30,644
THEY ARE VIOLENCE.

138
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:31,145
A COUPLE EXAMPLES.

139
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,882
IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT

140
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:37,418
THE MEDIA TENDS TO DEFEND MS-13

141
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:39,353
IN THE STRANGEST WAYS IN ORDER

142
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:42,223
TO HURT A REPUBLICAN.

143
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,757
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE SET OF

144
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:44,625
EVENTS.

145
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,826
HERE'S THE THING.

146
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:46,460
THIS HELPS TRUMP.

147
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,896
>> Jesse: IT DOES.

148
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,231
>> Dana: YOU DON'T WANT THIS

149
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,899
TO HAPPEN TO ANYBODY BUT AT THE

150
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,704
END OF THE DAY, HER     HE CERTA

151
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:56,737
END OF THE DAY, HER     HE CERTN

152

END OF THE DAY, HER     HE CERTY

153
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:57,438
WON.

154
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:58,839
>> Jesse: SOME PEOPLE ON

155
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,208
TWITTER SAYING EVEN MS-13

156
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:01,909
MEMBERS AREN'T ANIMALS.

157
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,212
THEY ARE HUMANS.

158
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:06,614
TAKING A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.

159
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,449
>> Greg: THEY HAD TO SHIFT,

160
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,817
ONCE THE STORY FELL APART, THEY

161
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,620
HAD TO FIND A NEW AVENUE.

162
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,622
NOW THEY ARE DEFENDING A

163
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,957
MURDEROUS GANG OF RAPISTS.

164
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:18,826
MS-13 IS ANOTHER VICTIM CLASS.

165
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,261
IF YOU GO AFTER THEM, YOU ARE

166
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,362
THE BAD GUY.

167
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:21,895
HOW DARE YOU JUDGE.

168
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:25,399
THEY ARE JUST IT, THEY ARE LIKE

169
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,134
A BOOK CLUB WITHOUT THE BOOKS.

170
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:32,640
THIS IS THE LAUREL-YANNY

171
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,642
EXPERIMENT WRIT LARGE.

172
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:36,844
NORMAL PEOPLE HEARD WHAT THEY

173
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:39,480
HEARD CORRECTLY WHICH WAS HE WAS

174
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,314
REFERRING TO A GANG.

175
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:45,152
THE MEDIA HEARD RACIST.

176
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:47,254
IT IS THE LAUREL-YANNY EXCEPT

177
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,922
THAT THEY ARE MISHEARING THIS ON

178
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:49,423
PURPOSE.

179
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:50,557
THIS ISN'T AN ACCIDENT.

180
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,393
I GUESS MAYBE BECAUSE OF THEIR

181
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,828
OWN CONFIRMATION BIAS THEY ARE

182
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:55,562
SELECTIVELY HEARING SOMETHING.

183
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:56,697
AND IN THE NECK STRATEGY IS,

184
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:58,299
THEY KNOW THEY'RE WRONG, THEY

185
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:00,034
KNOW THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

186
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:00,868
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY IS TRUMP

187
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:04,038
HAS SAID BAD THINGS BEFORE.

188
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,673
HE WILL PROBABLY SAVE THEM

189
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:06,040
AGAIN.

190
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,274
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT

191
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:08,409
THEY ARE WRONG HERE.

192
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,446
THAT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT THEY'VE

193
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:14,448
USED DEFENDING HATE CRIMES.

194
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:15,616
THE RACIST GRAFFITI WAS FAKE BUT

195
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:18,319
SOMEWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY IT

196
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,620
IS REAL.

197
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,354
IT'S THE LAST ARGUMENT THEY ARE

198
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:22,489
GOING TO HAVE TWO DEFEND IT.

199
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:27,294
IT'S GOING TO BE HILARIOUS.

200
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:29,797
I WILL GIVE TIME TO OTHER PEOPLE

201
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:30,397
I WILL GIVE TIME TO OTHER PEOPL

202
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:31,231
PEOPLE.

203
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,399
>> Jesse: AS SARAH SANDERS

204
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,201
MENTIONED ENDED A VERY GOOD JOB

205
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:36,637
OF MENTIONING, THE AMOUNT OF

206
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:39,239
HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY

207
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,074
MS-13, KIMBERLY.

208
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,675
YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM.

209
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:43,410
I DON'T SEE HOW THE DEMOCRATS

210
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,612
CAN EVEN GO NEAR AGAIN LIKE

211
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:45,913
THAT.

212
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,247
>> Kimberly: ABSOLUTELY.

213
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:47,981
OVER THE YEARS, WORKING AT A GET

214
00:06:47,981 --> 00:07:05,432
-- AS A GANG CRIME SPECIALIST.

215
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,835
THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF MEDIA

216
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:08,402
BIAS EXPOSED.

217
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:09,937
YOU SEE A SITUATION LIKE THIS

218
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:10,604
BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF VITRIOL

219
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:15,008
THAT THEY HAVE AND THE ANGST AND

220
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:15,809
UPSET TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT,

221
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:17,277
THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR AND THEY

222
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:19,813
TRIED TO SAY IT'S A SITUATION

223
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,548
WHERE HE IS BEING RACIST TALKING

224
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:22,216
ABOUT THIS.

225
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,083
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT TOOK

226
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,386
A FAR ENOUGH SAYING ANIMALS.

227
00:07:25,386 --> 00:07:26,120
WHEN YOU SEE THEIR HANDIWORK AND

228
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,921
YOU SEE THE CRIME SCENE AND YOU

229
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,591
SEE PHOTOS OF ME TALKED THE

230
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:35,863
FAMILY MEMBERS OF MS-13 AND THEY

231
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:37,231
ARE COMMITTING HEINOUS

232
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:37,965
ATROCITIES SHOWING NO REGARD FOR

233
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:40,234
HUMAN LIFE.

234
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,702
USE OF THE MACHETE.

235
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:42,336
THEY LOVE TO PUT NAILS ON

236
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,039
BASEBALL MASTER BEAT PEOPLE TO

237
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:46,607
DEATH.

238
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:49,543
THE YOUNG GIRL, TEENAGER WHO

239
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,812
THEY FELT DISRESPECTED COME.

240
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:54,081
THAT GANG LEADERS SHRINE TO A

241
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:54,848
DEMON.

242
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,284
FAMILY MEMBERS NOT ABLE TO

243
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:58,819
IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN BECAUSE

244
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,820
THE STATE OF THEIR BODIES THAT

245
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,688
THEY ARE LEFT IN.

246
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,623
NOT EVEN ANIMALS.

247
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:05,025
WILD ANIMALS EVEN BEHAVE LIKE

248
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:05,426
THIS.

249
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,027
WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT THE

250
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:07,761
FACTS ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

251
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,664
WAS SAYING, HE WAS SAYING

252
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,933
RESPECT FOR VICTIMS, RESPECT FOR

253
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:16,236
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A FLAT OUT,

254
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,238
SAYING I HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR

255
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,306
HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED, AND I

256
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:22,443
LOOK TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE

257
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:23,811
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO SOMETHING

258
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:24,478
ABOUT THIS.

259
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:25,746
>> Jesse: JUAN, YOU'VE WORKED

260
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,214
IN THE MAINSTREAM PRINT MEDIA

261
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:27,815
BEFORE.

262
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,450
ANY EXCUSE FOR SOMETHING LIKE

263
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:29,750
THIS?

264
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,885
IS IT SLOPPINESS OR IS IT

265
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:32,352
SOMETHING MORE?

266
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:35,456
>> Juan: YEAH, IT IS CALLED

267
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:35,823
ACCURACY.

268
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,058
>> Jesse: WALL, WHAT DO YOU

269
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:38,926
MEAN ABOUT THAT?

270
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:40,461
>> Juan: IT'S ACCURATE.

271
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,861
YOU ARE FEEDING THEIR GRIEVANCES

272
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,363
ON THE RIGHT BY SAYING THE

273
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:44,865
TERRIBLE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, HOW

274
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,201
COULD THEY SAY SOMETHING SO

275
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:47,501
AWFUL.

276
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,268
THEY MISINTERPRETED THE

277
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:48,669
PRESIDENT.

278
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:50,504
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE PRESIDENT

279
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:51,205
CALLED PEOPLE ANIMALS.

280
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,874
AND THEN YOU SAY OH, NO, NO, IT

281
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:54,875
WASN'T PEOPLE.

282
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,478
HE WAS REFERRING TO THE

283
00:08:57,478 --> 00:08:59,213
HANNIBAL LECTORS OF THE WORLD,

284
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:01,181
MS-13 GANG.

285
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:06,420
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU DO NOT TALK

286
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,788
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AS ANIMALS.

287
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:09,923
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE OR WHO

288
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:10,657
THEY ARE.

289
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:12,226
YOU DO NOT BECOME A MONSTER BY

290
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:16,296
DEMONIZING YOUR OPPONENT.

291
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,432
[ALL SPEAKING]

292
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:18,765
HOLD ON.

293
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,234
I WANT TO FINISH.

294
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,936
I THINK THEY ARE TERRIBLE BUT --

295
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,872
>> Greg: YOU CALLED THEM

296
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:25,439
TERRIBLE!

297
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,240
HOW INSULTING ARE YOU!

298
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,043
HOW DARE YOU CALL THEM TERRIBLE?

299
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:30,477
IT'S HURTFUL.

300
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:32,646
>> Juan: I CALL YOU HILARIOUS.

301
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:34,381
HERE'S THE THING.

302
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,983
YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS

303
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,651
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO

304
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,053
THIS COUNTRY WHO AREN'T WHITE

305

ARE COMING FROM S-WHOLE

306
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:41,955
COUNTRIES.

307
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:43,023
YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT TALKING

308
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:47,528
ABOUT BOOK COMING FROM MEXICO.

309
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:51,632
MURDERERS, RAPISTS.

310
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,634
THIS IS THE KIND OF EXCUSE YOU

00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,370
HERE FROM THE RIGHT WING ECHO

312
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:56,737
CHAMBER.

313
00:09:56,737 --> 00:10:00,941
I AM TELLING YOU.

314
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:04,011
YOU GUYS ARE TRUMP APOLOGISTS

315
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,646
TODAY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT.

316
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,014

00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:10,450
>> Jesse: YOU ARE A FAKE NEWS

318
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:10,918
APOLOGIST, JUAN.

319
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:15,989
TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT?

320
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:20,227
>> Dana:        [ALL SPEAKING]

321
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,261
>> Juan: YOU LOVED TO MAKE

322
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:24,665
IMMIGRANTS INTO EVIL BECAUSE IT

323
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,233
FIRES UP TRUMP'S FACE.

324
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,634
>> Jesse: WE ARE NOT

325
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:29,803
CONFLATING MS-13 WITH IMMIGRANTS

326
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:30,671
CONFLATING MS-13 WITH IMMIGRANT

327
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,071
IMMIGRANTS.

328
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,840
>> Kimberly: DID YOU HEAR WHAT

329
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,641
DANA SAID?

330
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,343
>> Greg: THIS LAUREL-YANNY

331
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,378
THING WHICH YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT

332
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:41,415
HERE IS JUAN HERE'S YANNY WHICH

333
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,550
IS SAD BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY

334
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,018
LAUREL.

335
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:46,320
>> Kimberly: I HEARD LAUREL.

336
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,621
>> Greg: IT'S A VALUABLE

337
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,356
LESSON ON THE HELP WE LEARN FROM

338
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:49,623
IT.

339
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:52,059
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, SOMETHING

340
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,427
CHRIS HAYES DID FROM MSNBC WHICH

341
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:54,795
I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY ADMIRABLE.

342
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:57,798
TRUMP WAS TALKING TO PARALYMPIC

343
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:59,833
ATHLETES AND HE SAID HE WANTED

344
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,201
TO WATCH THEM PERFORM BUT HE

345
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:01,835
FOUND IT HARD.

346
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,470
THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT

347
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,439
SAID HOW DISGUSTING IT WAS THAT

348
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,741
HE WAS SAYING HOW HARD IT WAS TO

349
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,076
WATCH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

350
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:09,409
PERFORM.

351
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,177
ACTUALLY WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS

352
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:13,647
IT'S HARD TO WATCH BECAUSE HE IS

353
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:13,947
BUSY.

354
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,782
AS THE PRESIDENT, IT'S HARD FOR

355
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:18,051
HIM TO WATCH THE OLYMPICS OR

356
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,252
PARALYMPICS.

357
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:20,454
CHRIS HAYES ORIGINALLY TWEETED

358
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,188
OUT THAT THIS WAS DISGUSTING.

359
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:24,725
HE WANTED AGAIN -- WATCHED IT

360
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,025
AGAIN.

361
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:28,061
HE SAID I WAS WRONG.

362
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,262
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE

363
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:29,896
SCHEDULE.

364
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:30,964
IF PEOPLE GO AND LISTEN, IT'S

365
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:33,333
OBVIOUS HE IS TALKING ABOUT A

366
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:34,701
HE IS CALLING THEM ANIMALS.

367
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,204
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

368
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:39,373
PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN THAT MAY BE

369
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:41,008
THEY HAVE TO STEP OUT OF THEIR

370
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:41,642
OWN DELUSIONS, THEIR OWN

371
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:45,445
EMOTIONS AND RELIES THAT YOUR

372
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,649
INITIAL RESPONSE IS INCORRECT.

373
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,550
>> Juan: DO YOU THINK ANYONE

374
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,953
WHO IS A CRIMINAL IS AN ANIMAL?

375
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,254
>> Greg: I THINK THAT'S

376
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,255
INSULTING TO ANIMALS.

377
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,391
BY THE WAY, WE ARE ALL ANIMALS.

378
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,126
>> Juan: I THINK IN OUR

379
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,862
SOCIETY LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

380
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:02,663
JUDGED GUILTY OF CRIMES LATER

381
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,065
RETURN AND WE WANT THEM TO --

382
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:07,267
WE DON'T SAY THEY ARE ANIMALS.

383
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:09,136
>> Greg: THEY ARE NOT, ARE NOT

384
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:13,840

00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,244
CHRIS HAYES.

388
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,646
I THINK PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

389
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:21,948
REMEMBER WHEN THE DOCTOR

390
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:23,884
KING STATUE THEY SAY WAS REMOVED

391
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:24,851
FROM THE OVAL OFFICE AND THEY

392
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,053
HAD TO CORRECTED.

393
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,854
PEOPLE IN MEDIA MAKE MISTAKES

394
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:29,456
BUT THIS IS NO MISTAKE.

395
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,924

I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS BUT

398
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,665
THE CORRESPONDENT ON CNN.

399
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,067
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A

400
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:40,834
GRAPHIC.

401
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,569
SAYING THAT THEY PUT A TARGET

402
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:43,837
OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

403
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,572

405
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:47,641
WORLD.

406
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,376
IT HAPPENS ON BOTH SIDES.

407
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,544
>> Greg: IT IS JUST WORSE ON

408
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:51,078
THEIR SIDES.

00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:52,546
>> Jesse: THEY ARE GETTING ALL

410
00:12:52,546 --> 00:00:00,000
OF THESE NEWS STORIES WRONG.
