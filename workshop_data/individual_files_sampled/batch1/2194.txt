I have to say though that I think you compare the two that Watergate pales really in my view as compared to what we're we're confronting now his subsequent actions sharing a sense of intelligence with the Russians and compromising its source reflect either ignorance or disrespect and either is very problematic similarly the whole episode with the firing of Jim Comey a distinguished public servant apart from the egregious inexcusable manner in which it was conducted reflect complete disregard for the independence and autonomy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation our premier law enforcement organization very interested to see what happens with Jim Comey's hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee and what he I think it will be very significant to see what he both what he says and what he's asked about and doesn't respond to as I've often said it is absolutely crucial for the United States and for that matter for the world for this presidency for the Republicans for the Democrats and for our nation at large that we get to the bottom list you know is there is there a smoking gun with all the smoke and I I don't know the answer to that
