to fight the barbarous tyranny of feelings let's get into our latest segment this day in history this day in history let's begin with the Nazis on this day in 1941 Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States bringing the formerly neutral us into the European conflict incredibly Hitler had no advance warning of his axis partner Japan's plan to attack the United States German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop believed a declaration of war on the US would overwhelm the German war effort Hitler thought war inevitable so he declared it first bizarrely blaming FDR for the war Hitler proclaimed quote first he incites war then falsifies the causes then odiously wraps himself in a cloak of Christian hypocrisy and slowly but surely lades mankind to war but obviously his was louder and in German we are fortunate now to be joined by Victor Davis Hanson the Martin and illy Anderson senior fellow in classics and military history at the Hoover Institution and the author of the new book the second world wars Victor thank you for being here thank you for having me now before we get into today's significance and some of the other excellent questions your book brings up why do you ask why title the book the second world wars rather than the Second World War for a lot of reasons that if the war was fought from the Arctic Circle to the Sahara and some English Channel to the Volga River and then the Pacific all the way from the Indian Ocean to the Aleutians in Manchuria to Wake Island in Hawaii so the bath canvas in which the combatants and all but 18 countries finally join didn't really know at every moment who they were fighting or why I mean nobody in Manchuria a Japanese soldier in Manchuria didn't have much in common with a Bulgarian on the Eastern Front firing of Russians but more importantly until 1941 and the invasion of the Soviet Union by the Third Reich people didn't call it world war 2 or in the Anglosphere Second World War words there were ten separate Wars conducted by Hitler and they were all except for the Blitz against written successful between September 1st 1939 and June 22nd 1941 so that nearly 2 year period they were known as the fall of France or the Yugoslavian or the Greek war the Norwegian or the Danish war but they were all surprise attacks all successful all against weak supposedly weaker neighbors all within close proximity to Germany and German logistical capability when he went into the Soviet Union that was quite a horse of a different color it was a huge country had no ability to get to Russian industry across the Urals and then six months later when Japan attacked us and the British at Singapore us at Pearl Harbor then mysteriously four days later Italy in Germany quite unexpectedly declared war the United States at that point this huge canvas I just mentioned really took shape and there was no longer a Yugoslavian war or a Polish war it all became lumped into the Second World War singular and World War one appropriately was now renamed from the Great War to World War one you know this is as you point out the 76th I think anniversary of that declaration of Hitler declaring war on the United States you know just shortly four days after Pearl Harbor why on earth would a Dolf Hitler already in the midst of his war is that he's fighting why would he declare war on the largest economy in the world well it didn't make any sense and it surely doesn't make any sense now I've also put people at his General Staff key military advisors not only didn't know that he was going to do it but objected vehemently when they found out about it so we have to put ourselves in his mindset he was inordinately impressed by naval power because his fleet was a fraction of the size of British fleet and he felt a job which was third largest in the world and comparable to the American Pacific Fleet would so tie down America that they would not really be able to fight a two-front war and he felt that Britain was dormant he hadn't controlled what his own what we would call now the European Union and he really only had one front and that would be against Russia and when he declared war on December 11th he was at the first subway station outside of Moscow so on his way of thinking very shortly moscow leningrad are gonna fall I'm going to finish the war Britain will be isolated the United States is going to have its hands full effort lost its fleet at Pearl Harbor and my u-boats will be right off the coast of Miami and for the first time in two years they could really go after these fat targets that will cut the Lifeline off the Britain and therefore the war will be over six months British will start Russia will fall the United States won't come to terms with the Japanese in terms of did he have any idea of the fleet that was being constructed in u.s. dockyards in 1941 no did he have any idea of it at World War one the United States had delivered two million men in less than 18 months no yep any idea that the United States would create 130 aircraft carriers or a bomber an hour he had no concept of that and as people tried to explain to him even people like Goering the marshal the Luftwaffe that if you're getting yourself into an existential war it's quite different than border wars and he said my nephew we have no ability to bomb Russia beyond the Urals we were not able to shut down Manchester and Liverpool in London industry and we surely don't have an ability to go to New York or Detroit or Oakland and yet that's fell on deaf ears and by a by an existential war you mean a war that can't be solved with a little treaty and leaving the government in place you need to totally force the country into submission and unconditional surrender and that hubris that you described in Hitler is I suppose unsurprising I was thinking to myself that the axis power is not being able to collaborate or to coordinate with one another shouldn't be so surprising Nazis and racialist totalitarians are not the easiest people to share and get along but it's unbelievable that Hitler did not know that his partner in Japan was going to attack Pearl Harbor then the betrayal of the Soviet Union there was no coordination with Mussolini to what degree or yeah to what degree what does that inability to cooperate did that affect the outcome of the war well it did a great deal because they all have shared fascist ideologies and you think they would have coordinated in a way that British imperialist American Democrats and Soviet communists would not but all the major division decisions on the Allied side unconditional surrender a second front in Normandy strategic bombing campaign Linley's were all mutually agreed upon and they were coordinated and more importantly the Allies shared expertise so if we had a p39 Airacobra that we didn't feel was very good but although it was excellent for anti-tank warfare then we gave it to the Soviets who found it quite useful if we had a Sherman tank that really couldn't knock out a panther the British came in and said let's put our 17-pounder on that turret or if we had a p-51 that was not flying as fast as a clockwork the British came in and said great airframe wrong engine we'll put a Merlin engine and made the best fire of the world there was no such sharing of information among the fascism and that they really hurt them and in the case of Pearl Harbor the Japanese were very angry at the Russians because right when they were fighting Stalin in 1939 in August and part of the fascist war global war what they fell against communism Hitler cut a deal with Stalin Molotov Ribbentrop pact and that made that freed up russia's western flank worries about it and the japanese is sued for peace they paid the germans back in April of 1941 on the eve not too long six weeks before Germany was going to go into Russia they cut their own non-aggression pact installing and that free about twenty five divisions on the east shores and Russia and boundaries to be used against the Germans so there was nothing but suspicion among all three of the Axis powers I suppose it's not a surprise if your partners are fascists that you might be a little suspicious though it is impressive that liberal democracy is able to work with was able to work with Stalin so well one of my favorite lines in your book is you say quote we often forget that the Third Reich was postmodern in creative genius but pre-modern in actual implementation and operations and it reminds me of that scene in George Bernard Shaw's back to Methuselah where the serpent says to Eve this is frequently quoted by Democrat politicians like the Kennedys but he says you see things that are and ask why I dream of things that never were and ask why not to what extent was Germany and Adolf Hitler were they the victim to their own fantasies and delusions well the entire Nazi ideology was built on sort of a hodgepodge of Nietzschean Superman crackpot philosophy vogner's of operas and the drama that they had never been corrupted assimilated and her married integrated with the Roman Empire that they turned up upside down in Roman history that's been on the wrong side of Daniel and Ryan was the right side that they were therefore evokes term that meant not just you were German Aires you would live in Germany or spoke German but you'd look this particular way and out of that sort of crackpot idea that came up with the idea one German was worth three or four Russians or Americans or British and that meant that they never really look at a very pregnant until albert speer the brilliant engineer aversion industry and central planner a german industry came into power in 4243 did they ever look at a cost-benefit analysis so where they ally said here's a b-17 here's a Lancaster bomber here's a b24 here's a b-29 this is how much money it cost to deliver one pound of ordnance so many miles against the enemy now what are the alternatives they said we're going to have a cruise missile v1 or an intercontinental Mississippi - they're the latest technology or we're going to have a mission at 262 jet and they just looked at performance ability in isolation or high tech in isolation or they looked at a tiger 2 tank they never out and they said well it has an 88 millimeter barrel it has six inches of armor Nurik weighs 65 tons they never asked themselves how many hours can that tank operate per hours of maintenance whereas that's all we talked about Sherman went out one hour of maintenance $10 on the road b-29 20,000 pounds you can deliver much cheaper than it b-17 and so when we didn't exact the Manhattan Project Lead b-29 projects they were grounded in common-sense pragmatism maintenance durability and they lived in a world of fantasies whether it was huge rail guns like Gustav it took 7,000 Germans to shoot one shot one projectile every three minutes and after out of 80 they walk there had absolutely no effect on the war the Japanese building the Musashi and the Yamato the two largest battleships in the world between them sank one light carrier when they could have used resources to build 50 of the world's best destroyers they have great destroyers to have enough of them well that old stereotype we have of the Germans is you know very efficient those Germans are very efficient people but the the portrait that we get out of your book is of a passionate Hitler yeah Hitler who is given to his own ideological wackiness given to the the blunders that come out of his own ideology about his people and this brings up the question of what precisely was the main decider of the war what was the biggest influence you write ideology for good or evil was a force multiplier of German Japanese and Soviet armies but obviously they lost so what was the relative importance of ideology air land and sea military superiority and economic output finally on the outcome of the war once Hitler and the Japanese redefined the war as really the big thick Italy Germany in Japan against the Soviet Union United States and Britain they could not win that war because they were outnumbered by almost too hard million people and the United States and the Soviet Union had a larger GDP each of them than the three axis put together and the United States would soon Allegheny be bigger than all of the combatants on both sides and in so many Union and the United States with each field of military over 12 million so the question was once they found themselves and they stumbled into an existential war could their greater experience could the ferocity of the Japanese or German soldier could they headstart that they had could their utilization of what is now the entire EU Third Reich occupation and most much larger area and the Pacific on the shale oil fields in any Mesa to the Malaysian rubber plantations to the rice belt in Southeast Asia could they use all of that and defeat the Allies before they geared up and for a while it look like they could that's if we were to ask his question in August of 1942 the 6th army was just about ready to crush the Russians at Stalingrad Guadalcanal 11 occupy and was cutting off Australia from the Americans Rommel had taken to Brooklyn was on his way to Suez thinking he could link up with army group South in Russia and then suddenly that fantasy vanished with the 1st Marine Division just wiped out the Japanese on Guadalcanal in a series of five naval battles we destroyed a great portion of the Japanese fleet don't need to talk about Stalingrad they lost the entire sixth army of 300,000 veterans and then Rommel was stopped El Alamein had to flee all the way back into Libya and Algeria and of course quarter-million people would surrender the next summer so at that point it was just a question what are the Allies want to do they can defeated the axis tactically but didn't want to have an armistice like World War one or do they want to have an unconditional surrender if they have had one on conditions rather they have to go to Rome Berlin and Tokyo and destroy these people's political system was 15 million enemy soldiers in the field I was going to be very costly that's mostly the war of 1943 44 and 45 and and before that the Axis powers were doing very well but they had the advantage of constantly surprising people they would there was a series of surprise attacks sucker-punches in the field of war and yet then the mongrel Americans and the decadent British and all of these countries that the Germans would have called decadent were able to rally a lot of active economic and military output how did to what degree did the Axis powers rely entirely you know or majorly on surprise and how did decadent nations defeat the ideologically disciplined axis the answer is that they were ideologically but they weren't disciplined so if you look until 1944 per capita expenditures on military Affairs munitions soldiers as a percentage of GDP was much greater in places like Britain or the Soviet Union in the United States and it was not just in Jef Japan but Germany as well so you have Americans working called decadent that were not having women wear nylons where Germans were still wearing nylons and we were having paper guides when people in Germany were not saving paper that changed by 44 and 45 but we really geared up people always look at Britain as sort of a weak link but during the Blitz of September of 1940 the British will they've lost script ecology there they were under attack they were producing more supermarine spitfires per month than the Germans with all the current today EU under the control of producing bf109 fires so we kind of forget that the allottee just made a lot more sacrifices they were a lot more practical and pragmatic in their approach to war and they were not blinded by ideological zealotry and speaking of some of those sacrifices now particularly when we talk about the war in the Pacific when we talk about the war in the Pacific there is a atone it seems of apology Barack Obama implicitly if not explicitly went to Hiroshima to apologize for the dropping of the bomb and yet as you write the Japanese were butchers during the war they killed many more than were killed themselves why is it that when we when we discuss the war in the Pacific there is such a feeling of sympathy or apology toward the Japanese it's hard to know I think part of it was the Chinese Theater was really unknown to the west and some fifteen to seventeen million Chinese the vast majority of them civilians were butchered by a Japanese who'd been killed another four to five million civilians in the South Pacific in other areas of Asia and then they probably killed either in camps civilians are in combat another five to six hundred thousand Australians America and British and I guess the idea wasn't because we dropped the bomb and it was a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima Nagasaki that just ended discussion and we forget sometimes that over 65 million people who were killed more work through about 80 million excuse me 80 percent of them about 50 million and that would be the 6 million who'd lost their lives in the Holocaust of 3 or 4 million civilians and Yugoslavia in Poland the 27 million dead of which probably somewhere around 16 million in Russia were civilians the 16 I mentioned the other civilians in Asia we're all killed by Germans and Japanese soldiers and World War 2 we should remember was one of the few wars history where the loser is lost far left and did the winners and basically it was a story of German and Japanese soldiers killing people in Eastern Europe Russia and China they didn't have any weapons and we're not in uniform and so when Obama said that in this apology you think well what were the Japanese thinking when they know in their own history that in terms of how my day loss versus howling they kill they were the most murderous combatant in the entire war and that all of his dead people 50 million dead people were killed by these two countries and that we're showing deference to them because we ended the war and to the miseries and Hiroshi my Nagasaki and by the way that would that was true because it wasn't that we tried to stave off an invasion as this is largely caricatured but we had the entire bomber fleet that had been idle for three months in Europe 10,000 b-24s b-17s British Lancaster bombers all we're going to be at least a large part transferred to Okinawa which was owned not like the Marianas 1,600 miles Japan but 380 miles and Curtis LeMay could envision dropping a more napalm which had already burned out 65% of the urban core of Japan but dropping more explosives and napalm about every two weeks and the power of one atomic bomb I mean so that was all called off by the the the atomic bombs and lamenting sort of said I don't know why we had to drop them I had I had a fleet in mind and air fleet that would have devastated Japan waves of no atomic bomb to do he was right my grandfather was a navigator on a b24 during the war over Belgium I believe in Germany and the I've toured some of those planes had those fleets gone over to the to the Pacific had we not dropped the atomic bomb I don't know of anybody who suggests there wouldn't have been catastrophic ly more damage and bloodshed and this brings up a question with the Japanese and the kamikaze attacks specifically because you you write that the kamikaze attacks were cheap and effective if it didn't cost very much to do it from a an economic level rather than a human cost level but paradoxically they demonstrate desperation they demonstrate that the enemy is so desperate they're willing to kill their own soldiers to sink your ship or suicide attacks ever sustainably advantageous in war taken there's a paradox in their use they can be very effective and it cost benefit if you have no morality about the value of life but usually people use them in a symmetrical fashion in other words when they're losing and because they're in desperation so had the Japanese launched 400 kamikazes in the Battle of Midway they would have won the war they would have won that battle and maybe they would have not won the war but they would have won for two years they would have been unstoppable because they think 17 ships at Okinawan killed 5000 American sailors worst defeat in American history of the sea and they did so with obsolete zeroes that increase their range by not having to have a round trip come back home and by using substandard pilots that all I had to do is given the plane and no dog cloudy no bombing nothing doesn't take a whole lot to learn how to take off you know doesn't require as much training tip you're gonna just run your plane into somebody ship and the point was that this was a cruise missile whose human brain was more accurate than anything known at the time and a v1 so they were very effective but why Japan didn't use them earlier was they thought we don't have to winning and usually what happens in history when you get that desperate tactic is very successful which is probably it's too little too late the irony is it would have been very successful but human nature being what it is you never resort to that when you feel that there's no need to know final question is you say that world war 2 which killed 60 million people could have been prevented how is that why is it that wars such as this begin the axis were the weaker powers by any standard of calibration so at Hitler known in 1939 in September that the Soviet Union was just you know it was neutral but not a partner or was opposed to Germany they would have never declared war because they would have had this army of 7 million people in their eastern flank and the embeddable trench arm but they had invaded non-aggression pact so collision was one reason on the part of Russia the other was appeasement and that was that not just materially the French and British when they saw Hitler finally in 38 for what he was a desperately rearmed and they were very successful they were getting close to parity or maybe even security but they didn't they were so common ties by World War two that they didn't want to repeat we're done in the film whereas the Germans who should have been traumatized as the losers very much wanted to repeat it they wanted a second try so there was an appeasement going arm that Hitler interpreted not as magnum entity to be reciprocated but with weakness to be treated with contempt finally the third unfortunate leg in that the equation was the United States was isolation if we had said in 1939 say in January we have an honour we have a an alliance with France and we're going to station a hundred thousand American troops we had mobilized Hitler with a Pelotonia but it was a combination of British and French appeasement American isolationism and Soviet collusion that trick Hitler into thinking that these countries were morally weakened did not want to go to war not and that diluted him to the fact they were actually very strong countries had already had parity with him when he attacked them and would soon overwhelm him and as a result we lost 2% of the world population all because of isolation and appeasement and collusion all very bad stuff a Victor Davis Hanson professor Hanson thank you for being here the book is excellent the book is the second world wars I highly recommend it we've been talking about how nobody in America learns history any more facts have now been banned from college campuses and they're deemed hateful and and bigoted so I recommend if you'd like to refute all of that craziness go out there and read Victor Davis Hanson the second world wars vdh thank you very much and we'd love to have you back there thank you for having me
