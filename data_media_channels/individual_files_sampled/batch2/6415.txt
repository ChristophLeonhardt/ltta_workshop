abundantly clear that they will no longer support members of the GOP who they feel are not living up to the Koch brothers expectations now these are Republicans they have been supportive of the very tax cuts that the Koch brothers and their supporters have been calling for but apparently there are other issues that these donors are looking for these Republicans to take care of including tariffs they hate the fact that Donald Trump has engaged in this trade war so as a result during their Colorado Springs get-together which they do every year here's what they had to say they're saying that representative Kevin Cramer from North Dakota doesn't do enough to further the cokes policy issues to warrant their help okay so to give you some more details on that apparently this network is also currently not supporting Senate candidates in two other key states Indiana and Nevada I'll get to them in just a second but this has led to a feud between Donald Trump and the Koch brothers now Trump has handled it the way he handles every other food he's gone after them on Twitter but it's really fascinating because remember I mean corporations got a gigantic tax cut under Trump Republicans overwhelmingly Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly supported it voted for it but it's still not enough for the Koch brothers it's still not enough for these donors they want more so there's a lot of different parts of this story and angles who's right Koch brothers or Donald Trump oh boy right number two this is a fight within the Republican Party they usually the kind of thing that MSNBC celebrates an easy relevant but this one is not irrelevant this one is very very relevant and it has potentially really positive ramifications but the things that have been said are significant Donald Trump called a joke do you have those I do so let's go to graphic 22 here are the two tweets in reference to the Koch brothers the globalist Koch brothers who have become a total joke in real Republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas they love my tax and regulation cuts judicial pics and more and he also says I made them richer which is true their network is highly overrated I have beaten them at every turn they want to protect their companies outside the u.s. from being taxed I'm for America first and the American worker a puppet for no one two nice guys with bad ideas make America great again so yeah there's a lot to break down there because well I actually agree with Trump on the whole issue of sending you know their their jobs abroad or not wanting to be taxed you know offshore tax havens like all of that stuff is true then Koch brothers want to maintain those benefits but Trump took advantage of that as well like Trump is lying to the American people when he pretends as if he's not also benefiting from that Ivanka Trump up until just recently was benefiting from that by you know shipping jobs to other countries rather than manufacturing clothing for her line here in the United States so first let me do a breakdown of how different media handles this right Fox News looks at this who's right Trump or the Koch brothers they say both because that's that's their bread and butter those are guys they've supported their whole lives right so CNN looks at it and goes I can't tell it's he said she said I can't tell right MSNBC looks at it and says Koch brothers Morning Joe loves the Koch brothers fauns over them Joe and Mika go to Koch brothers get-togethers and retreats and come back and all the establishment people on MSNBC is say Donald Trump is wrong and the Koch brothers are wonderful Americans okay so I don't agree with any of that so what's the TYT stance first of all they're both wrong okay so that's no other network will tell you that they pick sides or or like Siena and refuse to pick sides even though things are obvious right and then the second part is is more important which is well it depends what's the what conversation are we having why are we against Trump why are we against the Koch brothers based on substance so the Koch brothers professionally bribe almost all the Republican Party sometimes some Democrats are corrupt enough to they might bribe camp yeah some Democrats as well but overall they they're in the business of bribing Republicans so they're wrong in in the corruption that they do and they say they say they do it for a libertarian principles hilarious no every one of their positions lines up with their business interests so on that Trump is correct they don't like the tariffs because they have companies that make things abroad and they don't they don't want that they do want open borders when it comes to trade by the way the Koch brothers are right that the tariffs are not going to help the economy right so it depends what are we talking about what are the facts right overall when you weigh all the different things that they're right and wrong about it in in this particular case in this story Trump is more right than the Koch brothers are fascinating yes yeah and and by the way I just want to add one more facet to this story that I think is important look the reason why Trump is you know boastful about this on Twitter and it doesn't seem to be afraid of the loss of donor money especially when you know the blue wave is coming in the midterms I think it's because the the Republicans who refuse to speak out against the trade war understand that they have a political price to pay if they go against Trump because remember Trump's base is still very loyal to them yeah and so that's why there's choosing sides with Trump versus the Koch brothers what's the point in bringing in Koch brother money or their campaign donations if voters are gonna reject them for going after Trump so look I know what Trump is doing and it's he's not really thinking it through because he's not bright enough but it is it's in his nature right he's accumulating power in just one person which is what fascists do he doesn't like the distributed power of even the oligarchs like the Koch brothers having it he says no I am I'm now in in charts like Bane and Batman when he puts the hand on the business excited and goes so you think you're in charge Hey so and and that's what he's doing so I don't like that he's doing that but are the Koch brothers part and parcel of the corruption in America absolutely he's totally right about that but I did not get excited by that why this Trump flip-flops all the time and remember when he said o NRA you know they could intimidate other people but not me I'm gonna get tough and then three days later they're like hey schmuck you know how much they give you and he goes oh never mind we're not gonna do anything that I said earlier the NRA is awesome I've killed all my proposals in fact I shot them okay so I was waiting for him to do that with the Koch brothers because he doesn't know what he's doing he tries to do the alpha male thing and then the Koch brothers are like you know who you work for and I thought two days later he'll flip flop because he's Trump that's what he does but then this is a really interesting development that just happened Steve banning came out and said that the Koch brothers are quote a total scam a Ponzi scheme and then this is even more important and not just random insults he said no one ever knows who their donors are and that's true it's not just the two Koch brothers they bring some of the richest people in the country into their retreats of Palm Springs and other places they do it a couple of times a year and since a lot of it is dark money we don't know who those incredibly rich people bribing our politicians are so now here comes the right-wing going after them Bannon says we are going to find out who they are referring to the donors we're going to identify people who the cokes back okay no but that's real man because look on the left we're the only ones who would dare go after the donors this is so much fun and that wait a minute we are having fun yeah okay because this is for the first time I've ever seen the right-wing be genuine because most of the time ninety-eight percent of time whether they're politicians or they're pundits or they're in the media or they all they do is take donor money billions of billionaire money and do whatever they tell them to do they're all puppets but this is not what a puppet does I'm being fair credit where credit is due and and you know the right wing's way more vicious so excited so when we target the donors we're the only ones right on the left everybody else on the Left zagoon not the donors not the donors our beloved donors the so-called progressive groups in Washington are totally in bed with the donors so but they're never gonna touch them but if the right-wing turns on their own donors oh those donors are about to get kabobs okay so now that's a civil war that makes a difference so what I can't stand this one MSNBC does this and and even their primetime shows which I like from time to time God when they do this it drives me crazy when they're like oh do you know that the freedom caucus is pushing John Boehner or Paul Ryan and they're having a fight within the Republican Party haha no you Schmucks that's pushing Overton Window to the right it doesn't hurt them it allows Paul Ryan to go oh what could I do the house freedom caucus twisted my arm and I just had to give the rich more tax cuts that's a shell game you know celebrate that this is a real war where Koch brothers versus the right-wing in the form abandoning Trump unless Trump flip-flops which could always happen okay and Bannon is not fully back in the fold if he does not flip-flop and they actually go to war and the right wing starts exposing right wing donors then the battle is joined as atrocious as they are if you remember Republican voters actually hate the corruption and the Democratic voters hate the corruption we're trying to fight against the establishment on both sides I've never seen right-wingers be genuine except take back our Republican a couple other groups that are really really conservative and I disagree with them on everything else but there are a couple of people who are genuine and actually getting trying to get free and fair elections but if they are joined by this big fashion of the right-wing that actually fights against the donors game on yeah game on and also we hopefully at some point will get back to a place where we are legitimate debating ideas that would be amazing right because look I I love the idea of debating ideas but right now we're in his corrupt system where nothing is genuine we can't even agree on the facts because everything is corrupted by the money look I want to leave this story with San sam nunn Berg's tweet because I think that it kind of summarizes this whole story perfectly he says quote the cuck brothers better check themselves before they wreck themselves wow so numbers off the sauce and back on Trump okay I just thought that was a nice word to use nice use of the word cuck and also check yourself yes well it sounds like a cooked astrophys on its way but one that might actually help the American people last thing for me is look the fake progressives the establishment Democrats will look at this story and our coverage of it and they will say how dare you how dare you agree with Steve Bannon on anything or Donald Trump on anything you're supposed to oppose them no matter what we live in the black and white world and the resistance means that I mean unless they're helping the rich then we agree but other than that right and there are donors to that's fine we agree with that but other than that you're supposed to blanket and disagree with them no it depends and so in this case if they are genuine and that's a giant if and Bannon and and Trump go after some of the donors Trump won't go after all the donors because they're his donors but if Bannon is legitimate and there's a real right-wing faction fighting against a donor class that is a excellent turn of events to easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on
