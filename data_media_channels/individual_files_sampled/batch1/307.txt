desert is supposed to promote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman s reform vision for the kingdom the Financial Times Bloomberg CNN the New York Times and reporters from The Economist and CNBC will now not be going the CEOs of uber Viacom and one of the founders of AOL have also said they won't be attending other business leaders are reassessing their ties with Saudi Arabia Richard Branson founder of the Virgin Group has suspended investment talks in a space venture and involvement in to Saudi tourism projects former US energy secretary Ernest Moniz is backing away from bin Sermons dream mega city project Neil bin Salman's 2030 vision seeks to radically change the image of the kingdom but he's under fire over human rights issues economic reforms and foreign policy dozens of rights activist clerics and female campaigners have been detained in recent months last year many Saudi princes and businessman were arrested accused of corruption some of those released had to pay hefty fines the highly anticipated listing of state all state-owned oil giant Aramco has been put on old bin Salman decided Saudi forces would join the war in Yemen but three years on the fight against the Houthi rebels continues and the blockade of Qatar is still led by Saudi Arabia splitting the Gulf Cooperation Council and causing regional instability let's now bring in our guests here in Doha Khalid Al Cotter an economist and researcher at the Institute the new economic thinking at the University of Cambridge in London named Aslam chief market analyst at think markets and in Washington DC Ahmad herb director of research and analysis at the Arab Center Washington DC a warm welcome to you all let me begin with you how little heart can you just explain to the viewer what the Saudi crash means what how did this happen it mean that the there is a doubt and there is a doubt about there is a fear and anxiety and fear in the market associated with the elevated uncertainty associated with the case of hysteria and the possible involvement of the Saudi government in this case and then the possible repercussions of this on the weather on negative impact on the atmosphere of the investment or economic impact or economic penalties by the West are though I doubt it or even possible change in power structure so there are this is something really major and their doubt is already existed in the canal in D&D Saudi policy we have seen erratic and reckless policy over the recent period from the Red Skelton case to war in Yemen to Qatar Sankey to Qatar sanction to IPO around co2 a recent cancellation of a major project major energy project solar system solar energy project so the in my opinion the Hassan II case is just a major trigger of all of this and can show the world how the mentality of the leadership in power right now in Saudi Arabia and how far they can go with their reckless policy crossing all red barrier red lines and this is really will put the part that political part of an economic partner political allies in very difficult situation we will see many of them running away we already have seen it and trying to distance themselves from the regime so the the Saudi government is in really a Naughton of the table I mean it's a difficult situation this is very serious and we either they will have to come up with a way to come up out clean out of this or to our we might see a change in power structure or change in in in political and economic policy and it worth more reform more opening up with regard we have yes so far let me just bring in name Aslam here looking at this was a sort of global perspective the markets are clearly jittery but not because of Jamal keshavjee death is it more because of the fact that all of these high profile CEOs have pulled out of what was dubbed Davos in the desert that that's the economic impact or do you think it is because of keshavjee death alleged death I must say thanks thanks Nick I think when it comes to FDI foreign direct investment what you wanted to have is you wanted to have a certainty what you cannot tolerate is the stubbornness in any single government because when the business leaders and everyone else sense that that okay we do not have an assurity we do not have a political stability in the country that is the least thing that any investor or any firm wants to see and hence if these news which are becoming a headline apparently as you have correctly pointed out on Bloomberg on CNBC whether our earlier calls were posted so this will become a major concern because the founder of a Virgin Money or a virgin brand is not something something small if the entrepreneurs at these levels decide to okay that we're gonna cut ties are we gonna scale back from all of other investments that we were planning or intending to do in Saudi Arabia of course the Saudi stock market is going to have a huge reaction of course it is very normal for a stock market to have a reaction where nearly 82 stocks out of 86 stocks are in a deep negative territory 33 billion dollar is the literally right of the Saudi stock market today but we have seen this movie over and over in different parts of the world because panic when it triggers are similar in a way on the back of these such headlines these kind of reactions are very normal what we wanted to see is is the Saudi Arabia coming up and then saying okay look we are willing to resolve this matter with other political governments but I wanted to point out one important element over here because just the US or the president Trump administration is coming up and then saying look we're gonna have a very strong reaction about this they are not talking to a country which doesn't hold a major commodity we I mean I'm what I would say I hate to bring this up but 1973 oil embargo is an a very important example here where Saudi Arabia retaliated against the US yes the situation isn't the same because US is producing more than 10 million barrels a day but to answer your question very precisely uncertainity for FDI is the worst thing that can happen to any country that's a really important point the 73 oil embargo is very important point let me bring in my herb here it was used as a political tool to put pressure on the US now u.s. President Donald Trump is very clearly said there will be repercussions but what can the US president really do Saudi Arabia seems to be holding a lot of the business cards here surely yes Saudi Arabia is holding a lot of the business cards the problem is that the III I'm sorry but I don't really take with much credence with the president what President Donald Trump says here we're talking about a person who is who prefers you know anybody coming and investing in the United States buying weapons buying whatever it is over repercussions over things of that nature I I have a feeling that the man is just simply suing for some time he wants to buy some time to see how things may change I on the other hand don't see anything really changing this event is a major political event not only an economic event and the problem is that you know what Saudi Arabia is able to do whether it is able to do the 1973 thing to redo 1973 is that to me is doubtful Saudi Arabia has not had the economic transformation that you know vision 2030 or any other plans have indicated so it's still dependent on selling oil if it doesn't sell the oil it's not going to have revenue let's talk about right now let me bring in colors of hot air what impact will this have on his grand plan to stop Saudi Arabia relying on oil I I think they would regard to the vision this is a sign of the failure of the vision the vision already has suffered from many critiques it has been it reinforced the doubt about the vision about the sustainability and about the credibility and the sustainability of the Saudi economic policy to me by many economists not just by me to me I am already pessimistic about this because it does not address the real issue the real issue in Saudi Arabia what then the need that the citizen need home health education employment you are talking about the highest inflation is the 20% in the youth so the the people of the Saudi Arabia this day they don't need luxurious City they don't show you project they don't need to dig a canal around Qatar which we waste a lot of money as infeasible anyway economically or politically beside the many other observation on the vision with regard to their negative impact on the labor market and the private sector and the method in which they did the attacks was implemented if I tell you from my own sources what I hear that there are many businessman in Saudi Arabia trying to get their money out these days - fear of being confiscated so if you are you are not creating the right atmosphere the right environment to attract FDI to attract investment this is very important and the harshaali event is a major trigger as a major trigger it is something build is there and end in the mentality of the leadership the young leadership so either there we will see a change or to find a way to get the government hands clean out of this or it will be a serious disaster a serious disaster let me bring in my Muslim here when you on your trading floor when you're looking at all your screens the Bloomberg screen the terminal and you're doing all of your financial analysis when you're looking at the numbers when it relates to the grand vision for 2030 do those numbers add up to you can Saudi Arabia lease loosen its reliance on oil and develop this vision or is it like a holiday later saying it's a bit of a dream because actually they're not addressing the real issues in Saudi Arabia which are unemployment amongst the youth which are you know much more structural problems back at home like when we are discussing the structural problems they do not go overnight it takes a long period of time for these structure and cyclical changes to happen and one of the initiatives that MBS has taken was bringing Davos in science as you pointed out but whether that concept can stay there rather than it can sustain that credibility this is the huge question because we are talking about Middle East over here we are talking about UAE like Dubai on one hand Qatar on the other side Saudi Arabia on the other side they all know one thing very clearly or Iran I leave that ran out for the timing because it doesn't have the same position but we they all know one thing there clearly that we cannot rely on oil hence MPs said okay we wanted to change our economic dependence by going into foreign direct by investing into bigger funds and then perhaps dude some sort of a format while Scandinavian countries have done and then dry the revenue through that that wouldn't happen overnight that will take enormous amount of a time but plea geopolitical instability like this is absolutely critical for the country and like you would not see any investors feeling comfortable when they do not feel that okay I can redraw my funds I can pull out of a country I have my freedom of speech or any of these elements you do not want to do that because if MBS is really serious in changing the view about Saudi Arabia how the outside world see he got to show some sustainable results he got to show some important and solid results of that by having a stubborn behavior is not the way that the Saudi Arabia can do we know that a recent spat between Saudi Arabia and Canada and that was just over some futile point whatever they that's actually really important point when I am let me just let me just stop you that's a very important point I want to bring in a Madhur bit name just said the Saudis have a stubborn attitude which is stopping them from you know developing a political response to all of this is that fair well you know it's stubborn attitude is you can describe it as a stubborn attitude but then again you know all governments act in that sense where they feel that they are sovereign and they do not want to be interfered with which is which is you know a very very fair point the problem is you know why are we here I mean that same government that is rejecting and interference in its affairs is really making really major mistakes I mean since the beginning of 2015 when King Salman rose to the throne and brought along his son with him you know Saudi Arabia has made really some serious very very serious mistakes and no reckoning so far you know for how long will Saudi Arabia dis considering that none of it worked and all of it costs a lot of money I mean the Saudi Arabia and Yemen alone it pays probably like you know what I think the figure is like five to seven billion a month on a war that that is not going anywhere you know there are certain other things that the Saudi government politically speaking needs to really make a serious effort to try to change the atmosphere surrounding everything that its delivery bring holiday that's right and that's actually a political reckoning a political reckoning our guest says combined together the cost of the war in Yemen the Aramco IPO being put on hold all of the problems that the crown prince has had we're trying to get everybody get everybody to go along side with him and then the siege of gotten all of this in combination is Saudi Arabia now a bad investment yes I think yes I think we might see a pressure by drawing attention to Saudi Arabia and that it might have some positive result that you cannot get away with all of this and the West cannot keep close an eye on it as it's gone because of political and economic interests we might see drawing attention to the to Saudi economy to Saudi Arabia human right and quelling political dissident and opinion of speech and press we might see less of that hopefully in the future so there could be some positive side and to this story let me bring in a Muslim here we have a situation where investors are clearly jittery about Saudi Arabia as a country to put money into a lot of things seem to be happening very quickly a lot of investors are making what a snap decision I guess or has this been a long time coming is Saudi Arabia seen as being always being a risky investment but the risk was always worth it I don't know if the risk is always worth it I think it depends on the administration to you answer that and provide that platform because look if you wanted to attract investment you need to have a quality labor and talent that how do you attract talent because you provide them stability you provide them a bit different opportunity without that you cannot do it and that MBS did grease and you go into Silicon Valley by far I applaud that because I think none of the other Saudi officials that I know of have done anything like that where they've met the CEO of the former series of big big corporations and then trying to convince them to bring those investments or that research hubs back in Saudi Arabia and then this is what I was saying earlier there is a huge sort of a competition going on between the countries and Qatar by far has a very very lenient rules because it's providing residency is providing a lot of government support for a new startups if we are talking about startup it is all about AI it is all about green energy it is all about faint tech who is gonna do that the most efficient way who's gonna bring the most amount of her research labs within these react among these countries would be the winner because we know the fossil fuel isn't the answer anymore the only answer is to divert the development in the FinTech space and over in the UK just comparing a similar situation if we look at the brexit and everything else if the UK loses that talent because of the brags that everyone else is going I'm talking about the unstability element which is right there in Saudi Arabia now while Saudi Arabia doesn't have that talent but is trying to attract that talent so with with everybody with the presence of that instability it will suffer more let me bring in a mother herb here listen listening to all of our guests talk about the economic side of this there has to be a way out for the Saudis politically what will politically calm the markets calm means national community what will what are the options for Saudi Arabia listen there are there are many options I mean you know there are those who are I believe it's just too extreme to what to try to ask for a complete change of leadership in Saudi Arabia this is a legitimate rule it's the King needs to really make some you know some some really serious decisions including including his Crown Prince and including the advisors around his Crown Prince I mean you know this is for the Saudis to determine I mean there well nobody can really tell Saudi Arabia hey this is a sovereign issue you know we want to interfere here no I think Saudi Arabia should decide on this but then again Saudi Arabia should be there are very very smart and capable people in the royal family and in the Saudi etholon above power so you know there are many many important things that can be done you know you could you could you know lift up the the ban on expression in Saudi Arabia you can open up to the world you can say hey listen you know but there are certain things that we need to do regarding Yemen you know understandably Yemen is a very very important strategic issue for Saudi Arabia but you know going to war in Yemen against a very very poor country it's it's just it's it shouldn't happen it shouldn't be there are political ways of dealing with this issue you know the affair is very very to me I'm sorry to say it but it's a very shameful affair a shameful affair let me just stop with that because we are running out of time and I would like another answer from from all three of you give me mr. Khalid Al Fatah in 30 seconds what you think is the way out for Saudi Arabia if there is indeed one that you think they can take if I tell you a reform serious political reform and economic reform to reinforce economic and social stability first and foremost and then this hopefully will lead to economic to political instability and sustainability of the regime other there is no way out yeah now a Muslim 30 seconds what could you offer the Saudi government as advice I would say stop provide more stability on his border by stopping all the wars with the neighboring countries that would promote the entire stability element in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia would attract a lot of investment just because of that and a mud herb 30 seconds if you were advising the Saudi government right now liberalize a domestic front allow people to say what they want to say that will that will tell the world that you are ready for a good investment you're ready for you know coming for for really serious reform because you don't know no country can really develop if this if these things keep happening in Saudi Arabia so that we have it we seem to be developing a narrative of that this is a very serious perhaps the most serious situation Saudi Arabia's face plays politically and economically let me just ask one very quick question to you Khalid Al Kut the idea of the economic blockade against Qatar all of this sort of stuff it's clearly had an impact on you personally do you see a way of a climb down when it comes to relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar within the region can they ever get back to normal what do you mean can the relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar get back to normal yes of course everything is possible if there is a will and there is like a good intention it is possible good intentions well thank you to all our guests khalid al hopper name Aslam an ax murderer thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website al Jazeera comm and for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com /aj inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is aj inside story from me Imran Khan and the whole team here bye for now
