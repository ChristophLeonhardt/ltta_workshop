by signing the executive order yesterday president trump pushed pause on a crisis he created and then struggled to contain the washington post counted 14 different positions the administration has taken on the zero tolerance policy let's watch just some of them I have put in place a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry on our southwest border if you cross the border unlawfully then we will prosecute you it's that simple I hate the children being taken away the Democrats have to change their law that's their law this administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry and not break break across the block unlawfully the president has promised the American people he is going to secure our border we don't like the policy here either by the way today I signed an executive order we're going to keep families together well the separation of families is currently on hold the crisis with these children is far from over roughly 2,400 kids under the age of 12 still remain and makeshift detention facilities and shelters many of them are toddlers and infants the executive order contained no language on how these children will be reunited additionally any future families would still be detained as they await criminal prosecution and deportation potentially indefinitely for more I'm joined by Jacob Soboroff MSNBC correspondent just back from Texas Jonathan Lemire Associated Press White House reporter and MSNBC political analyst Susan page USA Today Washington bureau chief and Efrain Olivera is lawyer with the Texas Civil Rights Project I want to get to the detainment centers and the kids in a moment but first I didn't want to talk about politics the president last night at his rally in Minnesota only talked about the executive order for a very short period of time maybe a couple sentences if he was proud of it if he was excited by it if he had wanted to do it he would have bragged about it Jonathan for that entire rally instead he bragged about how tough he is how tough he is an immigration it feels like this is something that he had no to do yes you were exactly right it was one brief passing mention in the executive order and then he spent the rest of that almost trying to reprove his his hawkish immigration bona fides that he was out there in the warm embrace of his supporters supporters at this rally and you and I both well know how much he gets a charge out of that being back among sort of his people where everything he says are going to cheer and they're gonna scream it when he says that you know makes fun of a cable network or Hillary Clinton they're gonna bring back the old locker up chance but on immigration which was certainly the thrust of this last night among his other grievances that he was talking about he revived some of the rhetoric from his very first campaign kickoff in Trump Tower three years ago this week talking about how Mexico doesn't send its best people suggesting that he really wanted again like I said I'm a tough on the border this way he suggested the Democrats are more interested in the rights that illegal immigrants have rather than American citizens and that is that the part of what makes us president so frustrated is that in as this crisis has unfolded up until yesterday he thought this was good before the Republican isn't good for the White House he thinks being tough on immigration is a winner going into the midterms this year he says hey that's how I won the White House that's why I think our party can do well this November but the story got the better of him those images overwhelmed him and he had to cave much to his dismay Susan he got a lot of pushback in 2016 from everybody in the Republican Party all the Democrats pundants colonists you name it a lot of people in America as well he didn't win the popular vote but he's still won and he still survived a lot of these scandals that nobody thought he would be able to survive he survived and thrived frankly off the Muslim ban he survived and thrived by creating this division was he wrong to believe that this would work for him and you know very in very stark political terms not in any moral terms just or political terms absolutely and you know survive Charlottesville - there have been controversy after controversy where the conventional wisdom is this is the end this goes too far proven wrong over and over again there I think there is some feeling that the idea of these thousands of kids taken from their parents for parts unknown and in some secrecy you know the administration is being is not being transparent about where they are how they're being treated or for it how they'll be reunited and in some cases I think they don't have any idea what the how the policy is going to unfold but in other cases I think they realize that the what we keep calling the optics of this are just are just really devastating and they're not devastating I think for some of the president's core supporters who are very much support the idea of zero tolerance for illegal immigrants but for for swing voters for suburban voters for mothers everywhere I mean I think there are a lot of voters who look at this and say no this is not who we are this cannot stand and that's why you saw this very grudging concession I think you could tell in the president's comment state just how unhappy he was that he had to reverse himself on this Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared on the Christian broadcast network today he said he didn't anticipate the public backlash to the zero tolerance policy and never really intended to separate migrant children from their parents here that is it hasn't been good and the American people don't like the idea that we're separating families we've never really intended to do that what we intended to do was to make sure that adults who bring children into the country are charged with the crime they've committed I think it's the right thing we'll work our way through it and try to do it in the most compassionate way possible the body language right there and the way that Jeff Sessions was even speaking is a lot different than we normally see him when he usually gets on stage or at a mic or a podium and he smiles or whatever policy he is announcing or whatever defense he is giving that was certainly different in that interview and it's also not what the administration originally said was the point of the zero-tolerance policy let's watch that deterrent yes hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry we have to break up families the Democrats gave us that law our department of homeland security personnel going to separate the children from their moms and dads yes I am considering in order to deter more mental on this terribly dangerous Network I am considering exactly that if in the beginning it was always about to turn it was always this idea that we're gonna separate families so families know not to come over the border also by the way it's humanitarian because they shouldn't be making this dangerous journey I'm just flabbergasted listening to Jeff Sessions the first time I heard Jeff Sessions say that and excuse me while I picked my chin up off the floor because we know that he announced this policy we know that he wanted to separate children from their parents all along as a deterrent we know that this administration knew that the deterrent that was put into place in 1994 under the Clinton administration resulted in more people dying in the desert we know deterrence doesn't work we know that it has these terrible unintended consequences he knew he was gonna take children away from their families so look this is one of the most scarring things I've ever seen with my own two eyes it is the most current thing I've ever seen in my entire life I hope that those images are plastered across Washington DC for a really long time to come including for everybody in this administration that hasn't to do with it and pretend it like they didn't this is according to the reporting out there was bad optics for the president the president even came out and said that Ivanka told him daddy this looks bad it did you were there tell us how bad it actually is not how bad it looks it just blows my mind that we're even talking about it in terms of optics we're talking about little children sitting on the floor in cages on mattresses with mylar blankets with somebody in a watchtower for a security contracting company that is usually reserved for military bases or other stuff like that sitting there and watching over them like they're in a prison daycare it's not optics it's inhumane and the fact that the fact that this would come from an administration or from any administration that claims to care about kids and it came claim to care about Americans it just blows my mind Efrain the President signed this executive order does that mean the crisis is over no it's not over far from it and in fact some things have gotten worse because now we're thinking at indefinite detention of families and here on the ground this morning we interviewed 17 parents who were separated from their children they don't know where their children are and what conditions are being held or when or if they're gonna see them again and there's no plan in the executive order it's you know silent on anything about reuniting these 2,400 children with their parents how complicated how difficult is it to reunite these these families I was talking to an intercept reporter today who spoke to a woman who she considers to be one of the lucky ones who made it out had a credible threat assessment essentially saying that she could go out go further with her asylum claim she was led out of the detention center and she was able to pick up her five-year-old or six-year-old son that same day is that gonna be the standard will that happen for everybody it was certainly not happen for everybody because we have many cases in which the parents are detained at an immigration facility in New York Seattle bothered parts of Texas while the children are in shelters with or are in South Texas in Georgia and many other parts of the country and the two systems or our shelter system where the children are and the I's detention facility system are not designed to communicate with each other so that's what's causing in part this chaos in addition to the zero tolerance policy which is a root of the problem and not only that we do not know if there are any of these parents who have already been deported and if your parent has already been deported and you're a child that was sitting in one of those detention centers and now in an HHS shelter and your parent is back in El Salvador Honduras or Guatemala you may not ever see your parent again if they don't have the resources to come back and contact you what about the babies who can't say this is my mom this is my dad here's her name here's his name here's my phone number and what if and what if you're one of those children or one of those babies that was that was taken into custody in that DHS facility in Natale in the interim in between when this executive order was signed and when that policy was put into place it just these people are left in limbo they're hanging in the balance because of two months of politics basically hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching
