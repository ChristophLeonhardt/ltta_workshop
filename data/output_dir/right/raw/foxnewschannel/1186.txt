00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:13,909
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA.

8
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:15,611
WHICH POLITICAL WATCHERS

9
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:16,912
BELIEVE COULD DETERMINE THE

10
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:18,714
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE COME

11
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:19,915

00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:27,556
REGARDLESS OF PARTY.

18
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:28,857
MEANING BOTH DEMOCRATS AND

19
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:30,392
REPUBLICANS COULD BE SHUT OUT

20
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:31,593
OF KEY CONTESTS.

21
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:33,095

00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:39,368
COUNTRY.

27
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:40,335
CALIFORNIA'S FASCINATING.

28
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:41,737
TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING

29
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:42,170

>> YOU ARE RIGHT.

31
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:44,139
THIS IS A FASCINATING STATE TO

32
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:44,806
LOOK AT.

33
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,308
AS YOU MENTION THIS IS A TOP

34
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,643
TWO VOTE-GETTER SYSTEM.

35
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,144
SO IN THREE CONGRESSIONAL

36
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:50,879
DISTRICTS THERE ARE SO MANY

37
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,015
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES VYING TO

38
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,349

00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:56,451
ADVANCE IN THE TOP TWO

40
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:58,353
VOTE-GETTER ROUND THAT

41
00:00:58,353 --> 00:00:59,721
BASICALLY THEY COULD BE SHUT

42
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:00,822
OUT AND WE COULD SEE

43
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:02,190
REPUBLICANS WITH A SMALLER

44
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,658
FIELD ADVANCE.

45
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:05,694
WHAT IS ASTOMP NICHING TO

46
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:07,863
ME -- ASTOMP NICHING TO ME IS

47
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:08,997
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS

48
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:10,032
GETTING INVOLVED IN BULLYING

49
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:14,336
THE CANDIDATES OUT OF THE

50
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:14,770
RACE.

51
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,571
YOU HAVE ONE DEMOCRATIC

52
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:17,773
CANDIDATE IN THE 48th

53
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:18,774
DISTRICT SAYING THE PARTY

54
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,375
OFFICIALS CAME TO ME AND SAID

55
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,543
I WAS TOO BROWN TO WIN HERE

56
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:23,345
AND I HAD TO LEAVE THE RACE.

57
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,714
THIS IS ASTONISHING THEY ARE

58
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:26,682
SINKING TO THAT LOW.

59
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:28,150
>> WHO IS THAT?

60
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,852
>> CONGRESSMAN OMAR SIDIQUE,

61
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:33,021
THE FORMER ADVISER ALLEGING

62
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,122
THIS AGAINST THE OFFICIALS IN

63
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:35,257
THE 48th DISTRICT.

64
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:36,324
>> Martha: WHAT IS HE DOING

65
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:36,858
ABOUT THAT?

66
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,560
IS HE FIGHTING THAT?

67
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,562
THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

68
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:41,663
>> HE HAS BEEN SAYING IT

69
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:42,164
LOUDLY.

70
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:44,066
IT'S ONLY PICKED UP BY ONE

71
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,067
SOURCE, THE WASHINGTON

72
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,501
EXAMINER BUT I CONFIRMED WITH

73
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,103
THE R.N.C. HE IS SAYING THE

74
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,104
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFFICIALS

75
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:49,671
TOLD HIM THIS.

76
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:50,972
NO ONE IS COVERING THIS.

77
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,507
THEY ARE USING RACE-BAITING

78
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:54,242
AND TACTICS TO BULLY OUT

79
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:54,776
CANDIDATES.

80
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:56,011
IT'S ASTONISHING.

81
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,345
>> Martha: IT IS

82
00:01:57,345 --> 00:01:58,480
ASTONISHING.

83
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,015
WHAT ABOUT THE REPRESENTATIVE

84
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,416
ED ROYCE'S SEAT WHICH IS OPEN.

85
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,718
THAT IS CALLED THE WEIRDEST

86
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,753
RACE IN THE COUNTRY.

87
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:05,420
WHY?

88
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,154
>> IT'S VERY WEIRD.

89
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:07,456
YOU HAVE THE DEMOCRATS

90
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:09,024
FIGHTING SO INTENSELY THAT THE

91
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,358
STATE PARTY CHAIRMAN, THE

92
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:11,393
DEMOCRATIC STATE PARTY

93
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:13,462
CHAIRMAN CONVENED THEM AT AN

94
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:14,362
ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

95
00:02:14,362 --> 00:02:17,365
IN WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AS A,

96
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:18,667
"GODFATHER LIKE DINNER" SAYING

97
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,968
WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER

98
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:21,203
AND MAKE PEACE BECAUSE WE ARE

99
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:21,803
HURTING OURSELVES.

100
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:23,038
THIS IS HOW VICIOUS IT'S

101
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:23,371
GOTTEN.

102
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:27,876
THEY ARE CONVENING AT ITALIAN

103
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:28,777
RESTAURANTS TO MAKE PEACE.

104
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:29,611
>> Martha: WE HOPE IT

105
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,046
DOESN'T TURN OUT LIKE "THE

106
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:31,446
GODFATHER."

107
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:32,914
IN TERMS OF THE MONEY SPENT BY

108
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:34,316
THE DEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW, THEY

109
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:37,119
ARE IN DANGER OF GOING BUST IN

110
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,253
CALIFORNIA THEY DUMPED SO MUCH

111
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,054
MONEY IN THIS.

112
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:39,821
RIGHT?

113
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:40,188
>> RIGHT.

114
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:41,957
THERE ARE SEN TEATS THEY SPENT

115
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:46,161
COMBINED $30 MILLION -- TEN

116
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:47,763
SEATS THAT THEY HAVE SPENT

117
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:49,164
COMBINED $30 MILLION.

118
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:50,432
WE HAVE ONLY SPENT A FRACTION

119
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:50,899
OF THAT.

120
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,601
OUR CANDIDATES ARE EQUIPPED

121
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:53,668
WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHEN

122
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,137
THEY COME OUT OF THE RACES BUT

123
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:56,905
TO AVOID THE TOP TWO VOTE

124
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,340
GETTER SYSTEM, THE DEMOCRATS

125
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,641
ARE WASTING THE MONEY AND SOME

126
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:00,776
OF THEIR CANDIDATES ARE NEXT

127
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:01,309
TO BROKE.

128
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,078
THEY HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE.

129
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,079
D.M.C. IS BROKE, TOO.

130
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,082
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT

131
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,984
HOLDING ON TO THE REPUBLICAN

132
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:10,218
SEATS CALIFORNIA?

133
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:11,620
>> SOMETHING WE ARE LOOKING AT

134
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,021
IS THE SANCTUARY STATE LAW

135
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,322
THAT HAS REALLY TAKEN

136
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,590
CALIFORNIA BY STORM.

137
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,026
YOU SEE MORE THAN A DOZEN

138
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:19,027
DISTRICTS RISING UP AGAINST

139
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,028
THE STATE DISTRICT SAYING THIS

140
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:21,196
IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT TO

141
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:21,563
TOLERATE.

142
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:23,231
THIS IS A KEY HOT BUTTON ISSUE

143
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:23,565
FOR US.

144
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:28,804
WE HAVE SEEN KEVIN DALIEONE

145
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:31,039
WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST DIANNE

146
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,406
FEINSTEIN.

147
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:32,874
HE HAS FALLEN IN THE POLL AND

148
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,576
THAT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT

149
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:35,677
IS HAPPENING STATE WIDE.

150
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,045
>> Martha: IT'S GOING TO BE

151
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:37,445
FASCINATING.

152
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:40,882
WHAT ABOUT MONTANA?

153
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:41,883
WE REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT

154
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:46,521
GOING AFTER THE SENATOR TESTRA

155
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:47,656
THERE, AND THEY WANTED HIM TO

156
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:53,161
BE THE HEAD OF THE P.A.

157
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,830
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

158
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,864
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

159
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,199
JOHN TESTER VOTED AGAINST

160
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,200
NEARLY ALL OF PRESIDENT

161
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,271
TRUMP'S POLICIES.

162
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,506
CAN PUT ON TWO HANDS THE

163
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,707
NUMBER OF BILLS I GOT

164
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,842
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SIGN."

165
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:08,310
HE WASN'T WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

166
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,077
ON TAX CUTS.

167
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,312
WASN'T WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON

168
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,346
KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT OPEN OR

169
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:15,817
ANY OF THE OTHER KEY

170
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:18,053
LEGISLATION.

171
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,421
HE HAS A GREEN PARTY CHALLENGE

172
00:04:19,421 --> 00:00:00,000
AND HE IS FIGHTING THAT IN
