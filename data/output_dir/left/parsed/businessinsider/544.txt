haha
I started drinking Coke Zero when it
came out and it's pretty much the only
soda I checked now I probably have I'd
say two to three a day at work I have
coke a lot I drink awaken a bit I am a
diet coke aficionado it just doesn't
really taste like Coke Zero this is not
good that I think is that cook I just
had a diet coke earlier and it tastes
exactly like that I think that's the
Coke Zero sugar that's Diet Coke that
just tastes horrible sorry this doesn't
taste very familiar
this is Diet Coke and it's good I like
deco ESCO zero it tastes really familiar
that I think is the regular Coke Zero
the old one it tastes like a Coke Zero
I've been drinking earlier today I like
this one
number three is the new one I think this
is
Oh
