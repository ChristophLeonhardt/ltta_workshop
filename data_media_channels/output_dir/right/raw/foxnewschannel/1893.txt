1
00:00:01,422 --> 00:00:04,592
JUAN WILLIAMS, JESSE WATTERS AND

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:07,328
KENNEDY!

3
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:08,596
"THE FIVE" ."

4
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:11,031
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, CNN

5
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,167
PRODUCERS WERE DREAMING OF THEIR

6
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:15,235
NEXT STORMY HEADLINE,

7
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:16,637
PRESIDENT TRUMP WELCOMED HOME

8
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:17,638
THREE AMERICANS IMPRISONED IN

9
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:18,038
NORTH KOREA.

10
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:19,940
AND HE DID IT TO GREAT RATINGS.

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,408
>> I THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY

12
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:25,212
BROKE THE ALL-TIME HISTORY

13
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:28,015
TELEVISION RATING FOR 3:00 IN

14
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:28,616
THE MORNING.

15
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,851
THIS IS A SPECIAL NIGHT FOR

16
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,154
THESE THREE REALLY GREAT PEOPLE

17
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:37,625
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING IN

18
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,326
THIS COUNTRY.

19
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:43,464
I WANT TO THANK KIM JONG UN WHO

20
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:46,200
REALLY WAS EXCELLENT TO THREE

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,469
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

22
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:49,603
>> Greg: I NEVER THOUGHT I

23
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:50,070
WOULD HEAR THAT.

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,406
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD

25
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,208
HAVE A FORMER REALITY GAME SHOW

26
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,309
HOST RUNNING THE MOST POWERFUL

27
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,777
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD EVER.

28
00:00:56,777 --> 00:01:00,114
AND THAT REALITY AND THE REALITY

29
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,582
OF THIS MORNING'S RELEASE ARE

30
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:02,449
CONNECTED.

31
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:03,884
THE RELEASE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN,

32
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:07,388
AND TO THE NORTH KOREA THREAT,

33
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:09,189
HAPPIER DAYS TO ALL OF US, IT IS

34
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,624
TOO SOON TO TELL, BUT YOU WOULD

35
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:13,360
HAVE TO BE IN YOUR OWN PRISM OF

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,695
BIAS NOT TO SEE THIS AS A

37
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:18,966
PROMISING STEP TO THE CORRECTION

38
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,168
OF THE WORLD, RIGHT, CHUCK?

39
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:26,206
>> IT IS SO TROUBLING TO SAY

40
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:26,907
THAT KIM JONG UN TREATED THE

41
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:28,976
AMERICANS EXCELLENTLY.

42
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:29,710
THE RELEASE SHOULD NOT BE

43
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,783
EXALTED, IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED.

44
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,452
>> Greg: WHAT A WET BLANKET,

45
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,354
BUT THE DEVELOPMENT PUTTING IN'S

46
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:41,255
PERSPECTIVE.

47
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:45,993
TAKING TURNS AFTER SHOCK OF THE

48
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,194
PORN INTEREST, THREE AMERICANS

49
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,429
ARE FREE.

50
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:49,997
ONCE YOU GET PAST HIS UNSEEDED

51
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:54,635
LEAD PAST, HIS ENTIRE PAST

52
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:56,203
REVEALS THAT TALENT.

53
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,371
THEY ELECTED A UNIQUE TOOLKIT

54
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:00,908
FOR UNIQUE TIMES.

55
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:04,211
ABLE TO ENGAGE ROGUE REGIMES AND

56
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,212
WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND.

57
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,814
CARROTS AND A REAL STICK, NOT

58
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:07,181
FANTASY.

59
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:10,383
WHO KNEW THAT WHAT WE NEEDED

60
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:11,652
MOST WAS A REALITY TV STAR WHO

61
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,388
ACTUALLY DEALS IN REALITY?

62
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:15,989
SO WITH THOSE THREE PEOPLE, WHAT

63
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,493
THEY HAVE PREFERRED A SQUEAKY

64
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,694
CLEAN PRESIDENT THREADING ALONE

65
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:22,296
IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS THEY SAT

66
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:23,864
IN A FOREIGN JAIL, OR A

67
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:24,865
BILLIONAIRE TYCOON WHO IS NOT

68
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:27,234
THE BEST HUSBAND, BUT CAN TALK A

69
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,803
BEAR OFF OF A FISH TRUCK?

70
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:31,972
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

71
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:32,873
ALL RIGHT, KENNEDY, WELCOME TO

72
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:33,574
THE SHOW.

73
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,976
YOU LOOK GREAT IN PINK AS ALWAYS

74
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:36,610
YOU LOOK GREAT IN PINK AS ALWAY

75
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:36,944
ALWAYS.

76
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:37,678
WHY IS THIS WORKING?

77
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:40,647
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

78
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,984
BEFORE IT IS OBJECTIVELY GOOD.

79
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:44,918
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE

80
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:46,987
TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS NOT A GOOD

81
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,188
THING.

82
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:49,423
AND IT IS INTERESTING AND VERY

83
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:50,090
PREDICTABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL

84
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,992
CERTAINLY TRY.

85
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:56,330
I THINK THAT THE VISUAL WAS

86
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,198
GREAT OF THE PLANE LANDING, AND

87
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,801
TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE

88
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:01,368
VICE PRESIDENT AND THE

89
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:02,102
FIRST LADY AND THE SECRETARY OF

90
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:05,606
STATE THERE TO WELCOME THREE

91
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:08,175
PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES AND RECENT

92
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:09,576
HISTORY IS ABSOLUTELY

93
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:10,811
UNIMAGINABLE TO AMERICANS.

94
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,781
NOT THE 1% AND NOT THOSE WHO ARE

95
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,048
COMFORTABLE BUT TO ALL

96
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:15,849
AMERICANS, WE CANNOT FATHOM WHAT

97
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,821
LIFE IS LIKE BECAUSE VERY FEW

98
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,055
PEOPLE GET OUT TO TELL THE

99
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:22,389
STORY.

100
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,791
IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE STATE OF

101
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,992
THE UNION, ONE OF THE MOST

102
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:28,095
MOVING PARTS WAS A MAN WHO WOULD

103
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:29,830
ESCAPE NORTH KOREA AND TAKE HIS

104
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,965
CLUTCHES IN THAT EMBRACE OF

105
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:34,401
FREEDOM AND A CONTINUATION OF

106
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:35,536
THAT NARRATIVE THAT IS INVESTING

107
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,371
IN VERY REAL TERMS.

108
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:38,138
REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT

109
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:40,574
THE PRESIDENT OR WHO YOU VOTED

110
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:41,975
FOR, YOU HAVE TO STOP AND

111
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:43,343
REALIZE THAT THIS IS A GREAT

112
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:46,580
MOMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

113
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,849
>> Greg: JESSE, YOU KNOW THAT

114
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,551
I LIKE IT WAS AT 3:00 A.M.,

115
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:53,387
TRUMP IS SAYING, I DON'T SLEEP,

116
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:54,588
HILLARY WOULD BEEN IN BED BY

117
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:54,855
NOW.

118
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,590
>> Jesse: HE WAS UP FOR THE

119
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,392
3:00 A.M. PHONE CALL, IT IS

120
00:03:58,392 --> 00:03:58,725
PERFECT.

121
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,794
AND GREAT RATINGS AS HE

122
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:01,161
MENTIONS.

123
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,229
FROM HERE UNTIL THE MOUTH.

124
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,665
I'M SURE THAT THEY WERE REALLY

125
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,567
GOOD.

126
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:07,601
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT OLIVE

127
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,969
BRANCH FROM LITTLE ROCKET MAN

128
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:09,970
PRAYED HE DESERVES A LITTLE BIT

129
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,337
OF CREDIT.

130
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:11,638
I KNOW THAT IF OBAMA SAID THEY

131
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,308
WERE TREATED EXCELLENT, PEOPLE

132
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,576
WOULD'VE SAID, WHAT ARE YOU

133
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:15,876
DOING?

134
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:19,379
BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS JUST

135
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,981
TRUMP'S WAY OF NEGOTIATING.

136
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,950
HE CUTS THEM DOWN WHEN HE NEEDS

137
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,984
TO.

138
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:24,985
THAT IS GREAT.

139
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:27,487
IT IS A BIG DISTINCTION OF HOW

140
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:28,789
OBAMA DEALT WITH THESE THINGS.

141
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,758
REMEMBER OBAMA GOT A CHENEY BACK

142
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:34,027
BUT HE HAD TO GIVE UP FIVE

143
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:34,761
TERRORISTS FROM GITMO, WE DID

144
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:38,198
NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP ANYTHING.

145
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,133
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE

146
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,469
FROM THE LAST ADMINISTRATION.

147
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,605
THIS PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN BACK

148
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:45,339
DETAINEES.

149
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:48,008
WE GOT THEM FROM EGYPT,

150
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:49,610
AFGHANISTAN, EVEN THE UNGRATEFUL

151
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,577
BASKETBALL PLAYERS FROM UCLA

152
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:51,278
THAT CAME THROUGH CHINA, THEY

153
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:54,047
CAME BACK.

154
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,849
HE IS WITH THE GEORGE COSTANZO

155
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:56,183
METHOD.

156
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:58,385
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS

157
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,153
WHENEVER OBAMA DID SOMETHING,

158
00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:01,588
TRUMP DOES THE OPPOSITE IN

159
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:04,191
NORTH KOREA, SYRIA, IRAN, AND IT

160
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:07,227
SEEMS TO BE WORKING, JUAN, THE

161
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,562
MEDIA IS NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL

162
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:10,197
OF THE FALSE THINGS THEY

163
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,598
PREDICTED WOULD HAPPEN WITH

164
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:12,599
NORTH KOREA.

165
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,568
THEY SAID WE WOULD ALIENATE THE

166
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,270
AND NOT GET CHINA TO HELP US

167
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,536
OUT.

168
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:19,439
WE WERE GOING TO GO TO WAR.

169
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,407
AND POMPEO WAS NOT A GOOD

170
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:20,807
DIPLOMAT.

171
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:21,775
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TURNED

172
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,678
OUT TO BE WRONG.

173
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:25,812
THE MEDIA IS LIKE A BAD

174
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:26,213
WEATHERMAN.

175
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:27,047
EVERY DAY THEY COME OUT AND THEY

176
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,649
SAY IT IS GOING TO RAIN.

177
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,450
AND EVERY DAY IT IS CLEAR SKIES

178
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,451
AND SUNNY.

179
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,921
BUT THEY NEVER APOLOGIZE OR GET

180
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,355
FIRED.

181
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:39,159
>> Greg: SO, JUAN, FROM A

182
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,594
SCALE OF ONE BEING AWESOME, TEN

183
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,195
BEING SUPER, SUPER, SUPER

184
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,364
AWESOME, WHERE WOULD YOU PUT

185
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:44,765
THIS?

186
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:45,365
>> Juan: SUPER, SUPER,

187
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:49,870
SUPER -- GOSH, I IMAGINE US IN

188
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,605
THAT SITUATION, YOU WANT OUT,

189
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:53,006
YOU WENT OUT FOR AMERICANS.

190
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:54,574
IT IS GOOD.

191
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:56,843
THE PART THAT AMUSES ME FIRST IS

192
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,779
THE BUSINESS ABOUT RATINGS,

193
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,415
CLEARLY IT IS ALL ABOUT THE

194
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:02,382
APPEARANCES AND HIS POLITICAL

195
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:03,183
POPULARITY.

196
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,751
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS

197
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,586
WILL CELEBRATE.

198
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:07,788
LET'S PUT DOWN CHUCK SCHUMER FOR

199
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:09,122
STATING THE OBVIOUS THAT WHAT

200
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:12,826
YOU REALLY WANT HERE IS KIM JONG

201
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:13,760
UN WOULD NOT BE HOLDING

202
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,828
AMERICANS AND TREATING THEM SO

203
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:15,429
BADLY.

204
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:18,231
AND WE SHOULD NOT BE CALLING HIM

205
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,366
EXCELLENT OR ANYTHING.

206
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:20,934
JESSE, I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT

207
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:23,503
WE DID GIVE SOMETHING TO KIM

208
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,539
JONG UN, WE HAVE GIVEN HIM A

209
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,173
SUMMIT.

210
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:28,008
PUTTING HIM ON THE LEVEL WITH

211
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:28,742
US.

212
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:29,776
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

213
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:32,980
HE HAS WANTED THIS ACROSS THE

214
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,747
ADMINISTRATION FOR PREVIOUS

215
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:34,848
PRESIDENTS THAT HAVE DENIED IT.

216
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,251
HE IS THRILLED THAT HE IS SEEING

217
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:40,020
A WORLD LEADER EQUAL TO THE

218
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,387
PRESIDENT.

219
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:41,855
>> Jesse: WHAT WAS THE OBAMA

220
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:42,189
POLICY?

221
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,157
DO NOTHING.

222
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:45,559
>> Juan: WE DID NOT DO

223
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:46,159
NOTHING.

224
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,829
WE DO NOT DO NOTHING, BUT WE DID

225
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:49,596
NOT HAVE ANY SOLUTION.

226
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,365
I THINK THAT THIS IS WHY --

227
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,767
>> Jesse: THE SUMMIT AS A

228
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:54,968
RESULT OF SANCTIONS AND TOUGH

229
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:55,335
RHETORIC.

230
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,770
>> Juan: IT IS A RESULT OF

231
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,373
ACTIONS TAKEN IN TERMS OF PRIOR

232
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:01,708
SANCTIONS, DO, DISTINCTIONS, BUT

233
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,175
I ALSO THINK --

234
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:03,210
>> Jesse: ALL OF THE ALLIES

235
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,245
ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE SUMMIT.

236
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,748
THE ALLIANCES ARE STRONG.

237
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:09,282
>> Juan: WHEN YOU LOOK AT KIM

238
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:11,118
JONG UN, WHAT HE IS BUILDING

239
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:14,187
TOWARDS IS THE IDEA OF THE

240
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:14,788
UNITED STATES EXCEPTING

241
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,590
NORTH KOREA AS A NUCLEAR POWER.

242
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,924
EVERY OTHER AMERICAN PRESIDENT

243
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:18,792
HAS HAD NO TO THIS.

244
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,394
>> Kimberly: I DO NOT KNOW

245
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:21,995
WHERE YOU ARE GOING.

246
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:24,765
THERE IS NOT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

247
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:25,232
THIS STATEMENT.

248
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:28,969
>> Greg: ONE TRUMP GETS THE

249
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:31,405
PRESURPRISE, WILL JUAN SAY, OKAY

250
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:31,872
PRESURPRISE, WILL JUAN SAY, OKA

251
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:32,172
OKAY.

252
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:34,608
>> Kimberly: IF YOU LOOK AT

253
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,710
THE MEDIA REPORTS, THIS IS

254
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,779
SOMETHING THAT KIM JONG UN DID

255
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,414
RELUCTANTLY PRAYED HE DID NOT

256
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:41,982
WANT TO RELEASE THREE AMERICAN

257
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:45,385
HOSTAGES PAID HE DID SO BECAUSE

258
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,187
OF THE UNIQUE AND NONCONFORMING

259
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:47,988
DIPLOMATIC POLICY THAT THE

260
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:49,189
PRESIDENT ENGAGED IN.

261
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,792
THIS IS NOTHING THAT WAS

262
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:52,659
UNSETTLING TO KIM JONG UN,

263
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,960
SOMETHING THAT HE WAS NOT

264
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,195
FAMILIAR WITH.

265
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,230
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIED A

266
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,198
DIFFERENT APPROACH.

267
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,166
IT HAS PRODUCED A HISTORICAL

268
00:07:59,166 --> 00:07:59,499
RESULT.

269
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,768
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

270
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:02,636
SITUATION, WHY WOULD ANY

271
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:05,672
AMERICAN NOT SAY THAT THIS IS A

272
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:07,007
VERY, VERY FAVORABLE AND

273
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:08,341
AUSPICIOUS RESULT THAT HAPPENS

274
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,009
HERE.

275
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,378
I LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND I SEE

276
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:12,179
THREE HEALTHY AMERICANS THAT

277
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:13,713
THOUGHT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE A

278
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:14,047
CHANCE.

279
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:17,417
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO COME HOME

280
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:17,884
TO THIS COUNTRY.

281
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,986
THANK GOD.

282
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:21,354
JUXTAPOSED TO THAT FOR OTTO

283
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:22,589
WARMBIER AND HIS FAMILY, I DO

284
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,124
NOT WANT TO FORGET ABOUT HIM AND

285
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,158
THE SUFFERING THAT HE WENT

286
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:25,492
THROUGH.

287
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:26,526
IT IS A BIG MOMENT TO SAY THAT

288
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:31,264
WE ARE APPRECIATIVE AS A COUNTRY

289
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:34,034
AND HAPPY IN THIS DIPLOMACY.

290
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:34,868
>> Kennedy: THINK ABOUT THE

291
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,035
CHILDREN AND THE BABIES THAT

292
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,571
WERE KILLED IN FRONT OF THEIR

293
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:38,270
PARENTS AND THE NORTH KOREAN

294
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,207
LABOR CANCER.

295
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,009
TO YOUR POINTS, THOSE ON THE

296
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,377
LEFT HAVE BEEN SAYING,

297
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,979
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RHETORIC TO

298
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,948
GET HEATED, THERE WAS SO MUCH

299
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:48,715
UNPREDICTABILITY THAT PEOPLE WHO

300
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:50,450
SUPPORT TO THE PRESIDENT DID NOT

301
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,385
KNOW WHERE WE WERE GOING IN

302
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,386
TERMS OF NORTH KOREA.

303
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:54,988
BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED OUT,

304
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:56,456
YOU SAY THAT NO PRESIDENT HAS

305
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,291
GONE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE

306
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,293
MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN, WELL,

307
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:02,062
NO PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ON THE

308
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:05,232
PRECIPICE OF A REAL PIECE.

309
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,766
>> Juan: NO, CLINTON AND BUSH

310
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,969
BOTH THOUGHT THEY HAD DEALS,

311
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:12,339
EITHER WITH HIS FATHER.

312
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,274
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF

313
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:15,775
THIS BEFORE, KENNEDY.

314
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,512
>> Kennedy: IT IS ALL MALARKEY

315
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:18,912
COMPARED TO.

316
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:20,614
>> Juan: THEY ALL SAID NO,

317
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:22,449
BECAUSE THEY KNEW HOW

318
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,484
NORTH KOREA RAN THE PRISONER

319
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:25,152
CAMPS.

320
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:26,953
>> Kennedy: THAT IS NOT TRUE,

321
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:30,557
THEY OFFERED MORE CONCESSIONS

322
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:32,392
AND ENERGY AND RELAXING

323
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,760
SANCTIONS OF THE AHEAD OF TALKS.

324
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,228
THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.

325
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:37,030
THEY ACTUALLY GAVE TEN SESSIONS

326
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,899
AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN

327
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:39,599
NORTH KOREA MADE PROMISES THAT

328
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,335
WERE UNVERIFIED AND THEY WERE

329
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:43,770
NOT EVEN PRESIDENT TO THAT.

330
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,872
THE ONE THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT

331
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:48,575
THE PROCESS IS THAT HAS BEEN

332
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,177
REVERSED.

333
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:51,912
>> Juan: HOUSE THAT REVERSED?

334
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:53,146
>> Kennedy: BECAUSE KIM JONG

335
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:56,016
UN GAVE UP SOMETHING BEFORE BOTH

336
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:56,349
PARTIES.

337
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,952
>> Juan: YOU ARE WRONG, IN

338
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,787
NOVEMBER HE HAD HIS THIRD

339
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:01,988
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC TEST

340
00:10:01,988 --> 00:10:02,789
UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION.

341
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,325
SO I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS

342
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,627
COMPLETED NOW PREPARATIONS FOR A

343
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:10,163
COMPLETE NUCLEAR ARSON.

344
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:13,600
SO YOU STOP ANYTHING, WAIT A

345
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,167
SECOND?

346
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,969
>> Kennedy: WARD IS BETTER?

347
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,704
BOMBING HIM AND THE WEAPONS?

348
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,574
ARE GOING TO THE TABLE --

349
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,809
>> Juan: THAT IS NOT THE

350
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:23,577
DISCUSSION THAT WE ARE HAVING AT

351
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:26,780
THIS TABLE.

352
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,181
I AM ALL FOR REUNITING THE

353
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,150
PENINSULA IF WE CAN GET A REGIME

354
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,685
IN NORTH KOREA THAT IS NOT

355
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:35,388
TORTURING PEOPLE.

356
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:37,457
>> Kennedy: DEMOCRATS WANT

357
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:38,558
REGIME CHANGE?

358
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,293
>> Juan: WILL LET ME SPEAK FOR

359
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:40,961
A MINUTE!

360
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,462
YOU HAVE A GUY WITH NUCLEAR

361
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:44,231
WEAPONS THAT HE HAS BEEN

362
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:45,031
TESTING, WE HAVE PREVIOUS

363
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:46,032
ADMINISTRATIONS I THOUGHT THEY

364
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:47,167
HAD A DEAL.

365
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,501
NOW WE HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH

366
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,636
HIS RHETORIC AND WE DO NOT KNOW

367
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,172
WHAT KIND OF DEAL.

368
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:54,140
WHAT HAPPEN WITH THESE THREE

369
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,774
PRISONERS AS MUCH AS WE

370
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:55,809
APPRECIATE THEM COMING HOME IS

371
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:58,178
NOT TO BE SEEN AS OH, THIS IS A

372
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,213
RADICAL CHANGE.

373
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,549
>> Jesse: THIS IS WHY THE

374
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:04,384
AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE

375
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:05,085
WASHINGTON, YOU HAVE ONE AND

376
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:07,754
CRIME CHUCK WHO WILL NOT GIVE

377
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,121
CREDIT TO.

378
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:11,791
I REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA KILLED

379
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,393
BIN LADEN, AND THEY GAVE CREDIT

380
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:14,160
WHERE CREDIT WAS DUE, TO THE

381
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,130
NAVY SEALs.

382
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,266
BUT THERE IS A SPIRIT OF

383
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,834
BIPARTISANSHIP THAT USED TO

384
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,769
EXIST WHEN GOOD THINGS HAPPEN TO

385
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,170
AMERICA AND AMERICAN CITIZENS

386
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,739
AND PEOPLE WERE MOVING TOWARDS

387
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:26,039
PEACE.

388
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,709
LET'S JUST REMEMBER THAT THEY

389
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,380
JUST WANTED TO END THE KOREAN

390
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,248
WAR, SINCE 1950, TO SIT BACK AND

391
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:37,550
NITPICK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS

392
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,319
THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOOK

393
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:39,619
SMALL.

394
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:43,323
AND IT LOOKS PARTISAN.

395
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:45,692
>> Greg: NOW IT IS SET FOR

396
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,494
SINGAPORE.

397
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:49,796
>> Kimberly: JULY 12, IF YOU

398
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,365
LOOK AT THE APPROVAL OF

399
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,367
AMERICANS, 77%, SO IF YOU BEG TO

400
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,769
DIFFER, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

401
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,570
AMERICANS ARE FOR THIS, WE ARE

402
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,672
FOR PEACE AND DIPLOMACY, WE ARE

403
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:00,106
SITTING DOWN AND HE IS NOT

404
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:03,176
AFRAID TO BREAK THE MODERN RULES

405
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,312
AND GO TO THIS AND GET ADDED IN

406
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,079
A DIFFERENT ANGLE TO PRODUCE THE

407
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,348
BEST RESULTS.

408
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,050
>> Juan: I DO NOT THINK THAT

409
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,985
THERE IS ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT

410
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:12,452
THERE IS ANY ARGUMENT ABOUT THA

411
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:12,752
THAT.

412
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:13,787
HANG ON A SECOND.

413
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,355
>> Kimberly: IT DOES NOT

414
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:16,790
MATTER WHETHER POLITICS ARE.

415
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,891
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE FOR THAT.

416
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:19,559
>> Juan: I THINK IT SHOULD BE

417
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:19,859
100%.

418
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:23,163
I COULD NOT AGREE MORE.

419
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:24,130
TALKING ABOUT RECONCILIATION

420
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,931
FROM NORTH AND SOUTH.

421
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,566
BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE TO

422
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,968
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IS IT

423
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:31,171
THAT WE ARE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE

424
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,172
WITH.

425
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:34,708
>> Kennedy: CAN I ASK YOU A

426
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,241
VERY QUICK QUESTION?

427
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:36,343
>> Juan: THIS IS WHAT I SAID

428
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:39,546
TO JESSE, WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT

429
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:40,947
CONCESSION TO THE PRESIDENT OF

430
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,817
NORTH KOREA WHO HAS BEEN SEEN AS

431
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:44,818
AN INTERNATIONAL --

432
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,653
>> Kimberly: THAT IS NOT A

433
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:47,153
GREAT CONCESSION.

434
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,054
>> Kennedy: HOW ARE YOU GOING

435
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:49,656
TO AFFORD THAT?

436
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:50,857
>> Greg: YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

437
00:12:50,857 --> 00:00:00,000
ELEVATE THE PERSON THAT YOU ARE
