NOW THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST
AND WE MIGHT HEAR SOMETHING ON
FRIDAY.
WE'LL SEE.
BACK TO YOU.
>> Dana: WE'LL COME RIGHT
BACK TO YOU, GREG.
THANK YOU.
TO HELP US BREAK IT DOWN.
JAMILE JAFFERS, FORMER ADVISER
TO THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEES.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
IT HAS BEEN DISORIENTING TO
HAVE KIM JONG UN BE SO
CORDIAL.
HE DID RELEASE THE AMERICAN
HOSTAGES AND IT LOOKED LIKE WE
WERE FULL STEAM AHEAD.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE
CHINA ANGLE HERE?
ALSO, IS IT SOMEWHAT, A LITTLE
MORE COMFORTING WHEN YOU
REALIZE OH, THIS IS THE KIM
JONG UN FAMILY WE KNOW?
WE HAVE RESPECT FOR THE
PROCESS, FOR THE SUMMIT BUT WE
ARE NOT GOING TO GO THERE AND
BE SNOOKERED.
>> THAT IS RIGHT, DANA.
LOOK.
CHINA OBVIOUSLY IS A BIG
PLAYER IN THE REGION.
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY THE BACKER
OF THE NORTH KOREA REGIME.
WITHOUT CHINA THERE IS NOTHING
FOR NORTH KOREA.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT.
THEY ARE INCLINED TO GO WHERE
CHINA TELLS THEM TO GO.
IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE
AGGRESSIVE STATEMENT CAME
AFTER MEETING WITH THE CHINA
LEADER.
IT'S NOT CLEAR IF HE SAID I
WANT TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE OR
CHINA SAID YOU NEED TO BE MORE
AGGRESSIVE.
EITHER WAY, WHAT YOU ARE
SEEING HERE IS TWO LEADERS
SORT OF GOING TOE TO TOE TO
SAY I CAN CANCEL, YOU CAN
CANCEL, I CAN TALK ABOUT
NUCLEAR WAR AND SO CAN YOU.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHILE
THE TENSIONS HEATED UP A
LITTLE BIT, PRESIDENT CANCELED
THE SUMMIT BUT I BET IT'S BACK
OPEN IN TWO WEEKS.
>> Dana: THE PRESIDENT DID
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR THAT.
EVERY ACTOR HERE INVOLVED,
CHINA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA,
UNITED STATES AND CERTAINLY
NORTH KOREA ARE ACTING IN
THEIR COUNTRY'S BEST INTEREST.
HELP ME UNDERSTAND.
WHY IS IT IN CHINA'S INTEREST
FOR THE SUMMIT NOT TO GO
FORWARD?
>> LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY
WHAT IS IN CHINA'S INTEREST IS
TO HAVE A NORTH KOREA THAT
COMES BACK IN LINE AND DOES
RIGHT THING HERE.
BUT ALSO NORTH KOREA THAT IS
STRONG RELATIVE TO SOUTH
KOREA.
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT
THEY SEE, THEY USE THE COLD
WAR TERMS.
THE U.S. HAS A FEAR OF
INFLUENCE.
SOUTH KOREA.
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, SO THEY
NEED TO BALANCE IT OFF.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP HAS THE
UPPER HAND CHINA SAYS WE WANT
YOU TO BACK OFF.
NORTH KOREA FEELS THE SAME
WAY.
SO NOT CLEAR IF IT'S CHINA
PULLING THE STRINGS OR NORTH
KOREA REACTING TO SAY WE WANT
TO DO THIS AND CHINA SAYS YEP,
THAT SOUNDS FINE TO US.
>> Dana: ANYTHING THE
PRESIDENT DOES COMES WITH SOME
CRITICISM FROM SOME PARTS OF
THE COUNTRY.
RICHARD HAAS FROM THE FOREIGN
POLICY CIRCLES TWEETED THE
SUMMIT WAS BOUND TO FAILED AS
TRUMP BADLY OVERESTIMATED WHAT
NORTH KOREA AGREE TO.
THE ISSUE IS AND WAS THE
U.S. WILLING TO ACCEPT OUTCOME
SHORT OF TOTAL
DENUCLEARIZATION.
ALL OR NOTHING FOREIGN POLICY
WITH NORTH KOREA, IRAN, CHINA,
TRADE RISKS PRODUCING NOTHING
BUT OR CONFLICT.
"I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK OF
THIS.
YOU WERE INSTRUMENTAL TO GUIDE
REPUBLICAN SIDE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS AS PRESIDENT OBAMA
MOVED FORWARD ON THE IRAN
DEAL.
WHAT PARALLELS DO YOU SEE
HERE?
>> LOOK, YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT HALF MEASURES.
IF YOU WANT FOREIGN POLICY OF
HALF MEASURES, FINE.
DONALD TRUMP GOING FOR A BIG
PRIZE HERE.
THAT COMES WITH SOME COST.
EVERYONE WAS AMAZED THAT
DONALD TRUMP COULD PULL OFF A
BIG MEETING LIKE THIS.
I THINK IT STILL HAPPENS IN
THE LONG RUN BUT ON AMERICA'S
TERMS.
THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO
NEGOTIATE.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE WE WANT IT
TOO MUCH LIKE THE IRAN DEAL
THEY WILL STRING YOU OUT AND
GET A VARIETY OF CONCESSIONS.
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH
OBAMA AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
IT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME.
>> Dana: ISN'T THE ISSUE
HERE WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION
MEANS?
KIM JONG UN IS IN A STRONGER
POSITION BECAUSE HE NOW HAS
THE WEAPONS.
WE SAY NO, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP
THE WEAPONS IF YOU WANT THE
OTHER THINGS THAT THE
PRESIDENT SAID COULD BE GOOD
FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
THE DEFINITION OF
"DENUCLEARIZATION" IS THE KEY
HERE.
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.
THAT IS THE KEY.
THE CHALLENGE HERE IS DONALD
TRUMP MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT
VIEW OF WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION
MEANS.
THE U.S. POSITION HAS BEEN NO
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE KOREAN
PENINSULA, OUT COMPLETELY.
KIM JONG UN MIGHT AGREE WITH
THAT.
BUT HE MAY MEAN I'LL
DENUCLEARIZE WHEN YOU
DENUCLEARIZE.
THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE
SCENARIO.
WE SEE WHAT IS MET HERE BUT
PART OF WHY YOU WANT TO GET TO
THE PLACE THEY ARE TALKING TO
ONE ANOTHER AND UNDERSTAND THE
TERMS BEFORE YOU GO IN
NEGOTIATIONS.
>> Dana: ONE THING THAT IS
DIFFERENT IS BEFORE THE WHOLE
PROCESS, BEFORE MIKE POMPEO
THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE HAD
GONE OVER TO NORTH KOREA,
ACTUALLY MET WITH HIM.
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF
RELATIONSHIP.
SO THAT IS DIFFERENT.
AND I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.
IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE PLACE AT
