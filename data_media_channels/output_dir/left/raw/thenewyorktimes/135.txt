1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,550
With Andres Manuel
López Obrador’s victory,

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,320
Mexico has elected
a new president

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
willing to push back
against Donald Trump.

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,040
López Obrador has
shown a willingness

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,180
to go toe to toe with Trump,
who often taunts Mexico.

6
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,490
He’s been sharply critical
of the border wall.

7
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,640
And of Nafta.

8
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,890
López Obrador has been
compared to Nicolas Maduro

9
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,810
for being a populist on the left.

10
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,720
And with Donald Trump
for his protectionist

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,700
and anti-establishment
approach.

12
00:01:34,700 --> 00:00:00,000
But he insists
he’s his own man.
