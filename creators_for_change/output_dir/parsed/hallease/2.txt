- We're on our way to D.C.
- And I'm mooching.
- Yeah.
- And I'm here too.
- Yay (laughing).
(electronic music)
-  If you
plan to continue using
your small, lightweight devices,
please make sure your device
is set to airplane mode,
or the silent, or it is turned off.
- 
I decided to disable
the comments on my
Creators for Change video,
for a few days
and I grappled with that decision.
I'm fine with people disagreeing,
just do it respectfully.
- You guys, it's snowing.
It's snowing in D.C, ah.
- It's snowing.
- You're not as excited as I am.
- I mean I lived in it
in like, four years.
- Well, I'm excited, 'cause it's snowing.
- It sucks.
- (laughing) It sucks?
- Yeah, it sucks 'cause then
the sun never comes out (laughing).
- Oh.
- Well that's not
gonna be the case, today, but.
-  It's pretty
though, I like it.
- Yeah, it's always romantic
the first day or two
and then, as it starts accumulating
and getting more and more cold.
- So romantic.
- Yeah.
- Isn't this great, you
wanna snuggle up by the fire.
- Oh, let's get a fire then.
- Ah?
Oh, okay (laughing).
- 
Something I've taken
great pride in with this community
is how we all interact together below.
Even when we don't agree,
I watch that comradery vanish in minutes.
Years of work, discussion, discourse,
poof, gone.
So for the rest of the week,
I've found myself somewhat conflicted.
Why do I do this?
What do I do this for?
As a smaller channel, it's hard
not to be focused on growth,
but, this week gave me pause
and access to what I assume
bigger channels deal with
on some level pretty regularly.
Do I even want to grow?
Or rather, what's the price of growth?
And am I willing to pay it?
- Okay, it's raining, it's wet, but,
we are here, in,
The African American History Museum.
-  Woo.
- AKA The Black Smithsonian.
And we are going to--
- The saddest part.
- What?
- The saddest part.
- Yeah, we're gonna start
from the bottom, which is the saddest part
and work our way up, so, watching Oprah,
oh that's an exit, so yeah, here we go.
(piano music)
(upbeat piano music)
Going through the Black Smithsonian
was a reminder of what is
necessary to achieve change.
Many times, knowing that you'll never see
the fruits of your labor.
But each rebellion, each lawsuit,
a drop in a bucket,
that will eventually get full
and overflow.
(upbeat piano music)
(water hissing)
Okay.
We just finished at the Black Smithsonian.
- Oh yeah, we're still goin',
we're going to 9th.
- We're going to 9th?
- Yep.
- Okay.
We just, we know where we're going.
- Yes.
- We just finished
at the Black Smithsonian.
- Let me know where we're going.
- (laughing) And we
know where we're going.
It was really good.
- Very intense.
- Very intense,
we only made it through
the first three floors.
- In four hours.
- In four hours.
So, we're gonna try to
come back on Saturday.
- Yep.
- So we can see
the top three floors,
which are happier, I think.
Hopefully.
- We were told.
- We were told.
But it was really good, it
was really good to learn,
more in-depth about the history.
They give you so many details.
- Yeah as opposed to the Texas textbooks.
- Right.
- Oh you know,
civil rights.
- We had slaves and then
we didn't (laughing).
- Did they really have it so bad?
- Right.
- No.
- Yeah, so this is cool.
- Did you look at the
weather before you came here?
-  Yes.
- You did?
See.
I was cry full.
I felt like because I
lived out here for so long,
I knew, that knowin' this
time it would be cool,
I mean it would be cool, not cold.
This is cold.
A little disrespect (mumbles).
(Hallease laughing)
- Chris is like camera two now.
Yeah Mr. Hallease is getting involved,
in the channel in a constructive way.
-  At times.
- When it makes sense
and he's not feeling lazy.
-  When he feels like it.
- When he feels like it (laughing).
We're heading to dinner.
- There it is, right there.
- Yeah, I noticed you
had the sweat shirt on
and I was like, man you
seem like a tough dude, or,
you just didn't--
- Nah, I didn't.
- Okay.
- But this got the fur
on the inside though,
so it is kinda warm,
but my legs are cold.
-  Yeah.
- So after the YouTube event, right,
in L.A, we didn't get out that joint
till like, 11,
so I had to drive two hours south,
go to sleep, wake up,
the car was at the house I watched,
so I only got three hours of sleep.
I didn't pack until the morning.
So I packed at four.
Brought everything except underwear, son.
-  You didn't
bring underwear (laughing)?
- I'm wearin' the same
underwear I came in here with.
- Oh, God.
Okay, so, there have been times, yes.
-  Air 'em out.
- Where I have been (laughing),
in situations, but as a
lady, let me just say,
I have washed them in the sink.
-  Yeah.
- And blow dried them with a hair dryer
you ain't goin' catch me
in these streets ridin' dirty, okay.
- I pulled them out, I pulled 'em out
and I didn't put 'em in the bag
so I thought I had them.
So when I got here
and I got dressed for the morning,
that's when I realized I didn't have them.
-  Oh.
-  Yes, I want to,
quote, succeed at this,
because these bills ain't
goin' pay themselves,
yo all feelin' me,
support our channel on Patreon,
link in the description,
and a (mumbles), okay?
I want to succeed, but not at the expense
of all of you
and yet I'm reminded
of what I said recently
in a Beast Cast episode.
- I wanna be the person that can enable
my family or friends or whoever to
do what they wanna do
'cause there's this whole idea of like,
you hit a certain level of success
and you don't pull the ladder up.
Like after you, you leave it down, right?
And so for me, I keep
thinking of how can I place
myself strategically to climb this ladder
and deal with the things
that people don't really have the capacity
to deal with that I think I can handle
to break through it
and then, just be pullin'
people up the entire time,
you know what I'm saying?
- 
I still feel that way.
I still feel like I need to succeed
so I can bring others with me.
And God heard me say that
and this was the first test.
- You the camera girl here.
(Hallease laughing)
To get that camera, I hate cameras,
you know that.
Let me see, okay.
You remember this?
(Hallease humming)
-  That's Antoinette.
-  I've talked about
being uncomfortable, on this channel,
and this week was hell-uh uncomfortable.
If this was God's first test
did I fail?
I shut those comments off
and the weight of the world left me fam,
but did I fail?
- That's a lovely--
- Take a look at this.
-  Yeah you got nice.
- This is growing a little bit.
- Yes, it's terrible.
- But that wasn't the
one I was lookin' for,
and here, here they are.
The two of you, have you seen this?
And then they got that one.
-  Austin Rivers,
it's up knee deep, past yesterday--
-  You always look upset,
(Hallease laughing)
like you're just on the
verge of being upset.
-  As of now,
the comments are back on.
And I'm slowly engaging.
If nothing else, maybe you
can learn from my mistakes.
In the comments below, let
me know what drives you
to keep moving forward.
What do you do it for?
