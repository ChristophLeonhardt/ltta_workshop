TOLD US, THE ROAD AHEAD COULD
BE LONG AND DIFFICULT.
MOLLY.
>> GREG, THANK YOU.
>> A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL GO
FORWARD WITH DENUCLEARIZATION
AND WHAT THE DEFINITION OF
MUSIC KIM JONG-UN WHICH CAN BE
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE WORD
MEANS FOR THE PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND THE TRANSPORT MINISTRATION.
LOTS OF QUESTIONS.
ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THIS
STUNNING, UNBELIEVABLE
TURNAROUND BY KIM JONG-UN.
JUST RECENTLY, OF COURSE HE WAS
ACCUSING THE UNITED STATES OF
WANTING TO ATTACK HIS NATION.
SAYING THAT HE WOULD TURN
SEOUL, KOREA INTO A SEA OF
FIRE.
MORE BLUSTER AND ARROGANCE FROM
HIM.
BUT SUDDENLY, YOU SEE THE
IMAGES OF HIM SMILING AND
WALKING CASUALLY WITH PRESIDENT
MOON.
JUST A ASTOUNDING TURNABOUT.
WE HAVE THE DIRECTIVE CAREER
WORKING GROUP AT HARVARD
KENNEDY SCHOOL OF GOVERNMENT IN
CAMBRIDGE.
JOHN, WELCOME.
DO YOU THINK THAT KIM IS
GENERALLY REALLY SINCERE?
OR IS THIS ANOTHER --
>> THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION BUT
I THINK GIVEN THE LEVEL OF
PREPARATION AND ALSO
INTERACTIONS WE LOOK AT
PREPARATIONS FOR THE SUMMIT
TAKING PLACE IN INTELLIGENCE
CHANNELS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.
WE'VE NOT SEEN IN THE US AND
NORTH KOREA CONTEXT.
TO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO
BE SAID ABOUT THEN DIRECT
TO THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO
BE SAID ABOUT THEN DIRECT R
MIKE POMPEO, THIS IS NOT THE
NORM AS HE IS IN THE PAST.
>> THERE IS CONCERN THAT BOTH
SIDES MAY BE MISREADING EACH
OTHER.
AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR WAS ON
CBS THIS MORNING.
LET'S SEE WHAT HE SAID.
>> BOTH UNITED STATES AND NORTH
KOREA ARE COMING TO THE TABLE
FOR DIFFERENT REASONS AND BOTH
SIDES ARE MISREADING THE OTHER
SIDE.
WE THINK THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT
NORTH KOREA TO THE TABLE BY
PUTTING OUR ARMS AROUND THEIR
NECK AND SQUEEZING WITH
SANCTIONS.
NORTH KOREA IS COMING TO THE
TABLE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY
ARE NOW A NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATE
AND THEIR DRAG NESTED TABLE
BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF THEM
IN THAT STATUS.
>> YOU CONCURRED WITH THAT?
AND IS THERE A REAL DANGER IN
THE TWO SIDES LIKE THIS THAT
WHAT IS GOING ON OR NOT?>> I
THINK THERE IS THE DANGER OF
MISINTERPRETATION.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO
ABOUT THAT TYPE OF RISK?
ONE THING TO MITIGATE THAT
RISK, WE ARE SEEING TREMENDOUS
USE OF -- AND FRANKLY THE OFFER
FROM THE SOUTH KOREANS EITHER
PROVIDING SERVICES.
HERE I AM REFERENCING THE
INTELLIGENCE.
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
SOUTH KOREA IS PLANNING THIS
INTERMEDIARY ROLE.
THEY HAVE ENABLED EACH OTHER TO
CLOSE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT NOT
COMPLETELY.
THIS IS PART OF MEETING AND
NEGOTIATIONS WHICH WILL BE KEY.
RISKING A LOT BELOW THE SURFACE
THAT NORMALLY DOES NOT COME TO
LIGHT.
>> CLEARLY, PERHAPS FORMALIZING
THIS.
IT COULD BE AN EASIER SELL AND
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MUCH MORE
EASILY ACHIEVED BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
AND ARTILLERY ON THE BORDER?
AND EVEN HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
RISKING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN
THE PAST WITH QADDAFI.
HE KNOWS THAT AND THAT HAS BEEN
HIS PROTECTION.
MARK CASSIDY REALLY GIVE KIM
JONG-UN GIVING OF HIS NUCLEAR
PROTECTION?
>> IS A MONUMENTAL TASK.
BUT I THINK THAT IS WHERE THIS
TYPE OF DEALS AND THE IDEA OF
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS CAN GET
IS THE BASIS OF THIS HIGH-LEVEL
TYPE OF INSTRUCTION HAPPENING.
>> WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM DO
THAT?
LET'S THAT IS PART OF THE
NEGOTIATIONS AND TERMS OF
PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE TABLE
HERE BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE
NORTH KOREAN CLAIMS AND
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN
DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE UNITED
STATES, THINK THROUGH THIS TYPE
OF DISCUSSION THERE HAS BEEN A
BIG FOCUS ON TRYING TO GET TO
CONDITIONS THAT FEAR THEIR
SECURITY NEEDS AS WELL AS THE
THREATS.
BUT BETTER THAN THAT THERE IS
DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
LEASING REFERENCE NOT IN THE
PAST.
THAT IS THE PART THAT COULD BE
NEW.
THE FAST TALKING KEMPER FAST
TRACK THIS, THE IDEA THAT IS
EXPANDED UPON ANDREW MOVING
INTO THIS LOCATIONS, THERE ARE
OPPORTUNITIES HERE BUT THE
CONCEPT OF MOVING FROM NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, IT IS CONCEPTUALLY
SOMETHING TO EXPLORE.
>> WHEN LOOKING AT THE SITE
THAT IS AN OPERATIONAL NOW.
DO YOU THINK IS REALLY READY TO
MOVE INTO THE MODERN WORLD?
YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURES.
YOU THINK AFTER ALL OF THIS,
HAVING CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND
THE LIKE THAT HE IS READY TO
MOVE INTO CIVILIZATION?
>> THERE IS PEACE OF THE
DECLARATION THAT FOCUSES VERY
MUCH ABOUT THE FUTURE.
THE IDEA OF MOVING TO A
PERMANENT PEACE MECHANISM.
THERE ARE ALSO BIG REFERENCES
TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT.
ONE THING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN
MIND THAT NORTH KOREAN ELITES
HAVE TASTED THIS GLOBALIZED
LIFESTYLE AND IS PREDOMINANTLY
FROM THE ONE PERCENT THAT IS
MIGRATING OPERATING AND LIVING
IN THE CHINESE MARKETPLACE.
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, WHAT
THEY KNOW THE EXPERIENCE IS
VERY TANGIBLE.
I THINK THAT PART MAKES
INTERNAL COMMENCING OF SOME OF
THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WITHIN THE
NORTH KOREAN MUCH MORE
STRAIGHTFORWARD.
BUT IT IS THIS BARGAIN WHO DOES
WHAT, WHEN, WHERE AND HOW.
BECAUSE OF THE DETAILS WE WILL
SEE.
>> FINALLY, ONE THING THAT WE
THINK AS AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER
FORGET, OTTO WARMBIER.
HIS PARENTS NOW ARE SUING NORTH
KOREAN REGIME CLAIMING THAT
THEY BASICALLY MURDERED HIM IN
COLD BLOOD.
THAT THE 22-YEAR-OLD UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA STUDENT WAS
BRUTALLY TORTURED AND KILLED.
BASICALLY BRAIN-DEAD FEARS OF
THE PRESENT DEMAND THAT KIM
JONG-UN APOLOGIZE?
AND MORE THAN THAT, PROSECUTE
THE GUARDS RESPONSIBLE?
>> VERY TRAGIC WHAT HAPPENED TO
OTTO WARMBIER.
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPE OF
ISSUES, THERE WILL BE A TIME
AND PLACE FOR IT.IN TERMS OF
PRIORITIZATION, THE FOCUS ON
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD ON
DENUCLEARIZATION I THINK WILL
TAKE PRIORITY.
AND THE HOPE STILL BE
OPPORTUNITIES LATER ON TO
ADDRESS THIS.
>> IS CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THEY
