no campaigning just one party and rarely any surprises elections in Cuba are carefully managed in this vote the last step before Cuba's National Assembly chooses a replacement for Raul Castro was no different with their ballots Cubans essentially confirmed the names of 605 assembly delegates an electoral process that began months ago and will end on April 19th that's when the new assembly forms the Council of state which in turn chooses the next president it's widely expected this man Vice President Miguel Diaz canal will replace Raul Castro this government that we are electing today will owe it self to the people the people will take part in the decisions that the government takes that government will work based on its relationships to the people and the people can also remove those who don't meet their responsibilities it's a generational transition that the Cuban government says will guarantee the continuity of the revolution and in a country where the political power is largely in the hands of the Communist Party troweled Castro won't be stepping down entirely he's expected to remain as first party secretary and as such continue to be a major power behind the scenes there's a palpable sense of resignation in Cuba about who the next president will be in fact with only weeks to go Cubans know very little about migas es canal or any of the other potential candidates one thing there is no uncertainty about though is what the next president's biggest challenge will be upon taking office and that is tackling the country's stagnant economy over the last decade Cuba has made efforts to modernize its economy most notably allowing some private businesses to operate but many here feel they have fallen short of what's needed to improve quality of life on the island the next president's job has also been made much harder by the worsening relationship with the United States and the economic collapse of Venezuela Cuba's main ally in the region there will be positive changes both to our economy and our politics because some of the decisions made in the past have become obsolete but our own certainly we have some big economic challenges ahead in particular the unification of our two currencies which creates a lot of problems but we trust those people in this new government will be able to find the best way forward without ever compromising our peace and freedom whoever's the next leader will find it tough to replace these historically recognized figures but despite the challenges ahead many Cubans are hoping this is a moment their government can capitalize on for lasting economic reform Julia galeano al Jazeera Havana
