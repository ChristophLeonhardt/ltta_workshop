Maria Bartiromo is a big fan of Donald Trump so when she saw Donald Trump tweeting an attack against other government officials she wanted to jump in and and help the big guy out so first let me show you the tweet that Trump sent recently he says I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow and he did today that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI DOJ infiltrated or surveil the Trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by the people within the Obama administration so he says they politicized the Department of Justice and the FBI well look if they left it at well let's have the Inspector General do their job and look into whether that was a political attack against the Trump campaign or if they had a legitimate warrant reasonable suspicion and they were investigating a potential crime great have the Inspector General do that no problem so I'm actually not overreacting to it I think it depends on the the manner in which they proceed now if instead Donald Trump says look I don't want the Inspector General looking into it and I don't want to go through regular course of business I just want the Department of Justice to fire anybody who is my opponent at the FBI and to eviscerate any group that's looking to legitimately investigating not my sense having seen Donald Trump having heard his words having him saying over and over again in public is that he's looking to do the latter right but theoretically you could do the Inspector General route and that's what rod Rose is time now having met with Trump says yeah we'll have the Inspector General look at it okay so but Romo those is not that's not enough she's gonna go after far more than done even just the FBI let's look this is a major presidential election tamo basically it what it appears to me politicizing all of his agencies the DOJ the FBI the IRS the CIA they were all involved in trying to take down Donald Trump a word they were all involved in trying to take down Donald Trump the IRS to see it well first of all where are they okay why hasn't the IRS released his tax rate if they were part of a plot to take down Donald Trump he is incredibly nervous about those tax returns doesn't anybody see him I come by rs hasn't released them oh the CIA to see I would would it how's the CIA going to take down Donald Trump okay so apparently the conservative hosts have done a number of things one is they've gone full Jones so knowing Alex Jones you think the frogs are gay hold my beer Hey so she's thrown the kitchen sink in there second thing is and this is what fascists do destroy the rule of law oh you're gonna try to enforce the law and keep our system of government as it is with this checks and balances no we will destroy your checks and balances anyone who tries to investigate us we will actually investigate them and throw them in jail for trying to do their job law enforcement we were kidding we never believed in law enforcement so now we'll say the Department of Justice and the FBI are all crooks who hatch the conspiracy along with the IRS and the CIA to tunnelled a target Donald Trump you know what that means that means Maria Bartiromo was never seen in the first place and there was all these fascists who were sitting in their closets and now Trump has given them permission to come out of the closet so yes all right how do we destroy all things that make this country what it is now if as a journalist she was to say hey listen I don't believe everything you hear from the FBI or the CIA well I'd say I hear you on that hey finally a little bit of journalism is broken out at Fox right and you were to say hey for example when they do a drone strike and they say it's only civilians perhaps we should question that I'd say fantastic right but don't assume that they killed civilians don't assume they didn't kill civilians let's actually look into it and and and do some reporting Wow how's that for an idea instead she goes with don't listen to anything they're saying all the people trying to enforce the law are all part of a global conspiracy against our beloved Dear Leader they can't wait the minute he gave him a little bit of opening they jump right through it they're like what do we started roasting people on false charges she's so sad by the way does anyone ever talk about business on fox business I've literally never seen it I don't know we must have covered dozens of their clips never once saw them talking about business okay so she's not done yet she knows who hatched a conspiracy let's watch but where was Obama I don't know there what are those checks and all of this information tell us where Obama was it sounds like either President Obama or Hillary Clinton were sort of masterminding all of those oh yeah masterminding it Hillary Clinton mastermind herself to a defeat one of the worst and least popular candidates in American history what a mastermind Hillary Clinton is yeah hey guys I got a great mastermind idea let's not go to Wisconsin or Michigan okay anyway and Obama intelligence officials come up to Obama and the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership on the set in the house and they say it by the way the Russians are interfering with this election and they are trying to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton mr. McConnell says hey you better not say anything okay because that'll hurt our Republican candidate even though it's true and I acknowledge that it's true Obama my legacy so he didn't say anything as usual he was a total pushover and what does he get I mean for eight years he never learned that lesson well if I'm enough of a pushover the Republicans maybe don't say nice things about me you said nothing during the election Trump won and now they say you launched a global conspiracy including the IRS and the CIA they were gonna say that no matter what you schmuck so this is what the right wing in this country has devolved to a bunch of conspiracy theory lunatics who can't wait to go after their political opponents and destroy our system of government okay they never believed in it anyway they never believed in the Constitution they want us to be ruled by either an authoritarian leader or some religious zealot they believe a theocracy they don't in the Constitution they don't believe in a separation of church and state they don't believe in freedom of the press they don't believe in rights they don't believe in probable cause they don't believe in any of those things and they never have they don't even believe in democracy so the minute that they have an opportunity they're gonna go authoritarian and they're gonna go all the way so understand that's what's coming down the pike and it turns out they were always in our midst but carefully hiding in the closet waiting for just a moment like this Maria congratulations you're out of the closet now two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
