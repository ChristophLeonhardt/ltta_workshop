A MEDIA FRENZY ABOUT
MELANIA TRUMP.
TODAY, THE PRESIDENT LASHED OUT,
CALLING THE COVERAGE UNFAIR AND
VICIOUS.
FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDIA BUZZ HOST
HOWARD KURTZ SEPARATES FACT FROM
FICTION.
>> SHE WENT THROUGH A LITTLE
ROUGH PATCH BUT SHE'S DOING
GREAT AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF
WHAT SHE HAS DONE.
THE PEOPLE LOVE YOU.
THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY LOVE
YOU.
THANK YOU, HONEY.
>> MELANIA TRUMP APPEARED AT A
FEMA HURRICANE BRIEFING WITH HER
HUSBAND TODAY, WHICH WOULD HAVE
BEEN UNREMARKABLE, EXCEPT MUCH
OF THE MEDIA HAS TURNED HER
ABSENCE INTO FROM THE PUBLIC
STAGE INTO THE MELODRAMA.
ONCE THE FIRST LADY STEPPED AWAY
FROM THE PUBLIC STAGE, POLITICAL
RAN A STORY TITLED "WHITE HOUSE
SILENCE ON MELANIA --
"VANITY FAIR" HAD A PIECE ABOUT
WHY HER VANISHING ACT MATTERS.
IN THIS, FROM
"THE HUFFINGTON POST."
"MELANIA MYSTERY CONTINUES.
FIRST LADY WANT TO COMPANY
PRESIDENT TO G7 OR SINGAPORE."
>> MELANIA'S LONG ABSENCE FROM
THE PUBLIC EYE HAS EVERYONE
WONDERING WHAT IS REALLY GOING
ON.
ON SOCIAL MEDIA, JOKES TO
RESPECT HER IMAGE ON MILK
CARTONS.
>> I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST THE
PRESS WHO ARE RABID FREIGHTER
THINK THERE ARE DEMOCRATS,
REPUBLICANS, FANS, THERE ARE
LOTS OF PEOPLE JUST WONDERING
WHERE IS THE FIRST LADY.
>> THAT KIND OF COVERAGE
PROMPTED THE PRESIDENT TO UNLOAD
ON TWITTER TODAY.
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA HAS BEEN SO
UNFAIR AND VICIOUS TO MY WIFE
AND OUR GREAT FIRST LADY,
MELANIA.
DURING HER RECOVERY FROM
SURGERY, THEY REPORTED
EVERYTHING, FROM NEAR DEATH TO
FACE-LIFT TO LEFT THE
WHITE HOUSE AND ME, TO NEW YORK
OR VIRGINIA, TO ABUSE.
ALL FAKE.
SHE IS DOING REALLY WELL."
HE ADDED THAT FOUR REPORTER
SPOTTED THE FIRST LADY WALKING
TO A MEETING BUT THEY NEVER
REPORTED THE SIGHTINGS BECAUSE
IT WOULD HURT THE SICK NARRATIVE
THAT SHE WAS LIVING IN A
DIFFERENT PART OF THE WORLD, WAS
REALLY ILL, OR WHATEVER.
THE FIRST LADY WASN'T REALLY
MISSING IS THE EAST WING MADE
CLEAR, SHE WAS ATTENDING
MEETINGS.
MELANIA HERSELF TWEETED THE
MEDIA WERE WORKING OVERTIME
SPECULATING WHERE I AM AND WHAT
I'M DOING.
JOURNALISTS WEREN'T VICIOUS
TOWARD MELANIA TRIBE, AS THE
PRESIDENT CLAIMS.
BUT TOO OBSESSED WITH HER
STAYING BEHIND THE SCENES.
KNOWING FULL WELL THIS IS A
FIRST LADY WHO DOES NOT RELISH
THE SPOTLIGHT.
THE SPREADING OF SUBSTANTIATED
