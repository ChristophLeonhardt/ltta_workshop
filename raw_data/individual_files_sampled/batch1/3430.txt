this could be any Sunday football scene but these friends aren't cheering for their hometown team I grew up being Broncos and Rocky's fan and now I just kind of whoever is on my team that given week that I need to do well is you know rooting for along with legions of others they're playing daily fantasy sports putting hundreds of millions of dollars in the line every week that type of action brings out the pros wake up at seven o'clock and this is all I do every single day how many hours a week do you work I work between 70 and 80 every single week and those pros are raking in the cash there's definitely been some six-figure months but not everyone is so lucky and I didn't night out when you're constantly on the negative end of the ledger that's that's not fun now the industry is under fire if you live in the state of Nevada you can no longer play draft kings or fan duel bottom line New York declares this game illegal the big question prompting the state bands is DFS gambling it's not it's a game of skill gambling without a doubt as a passionate sports fan who waited deep into online poker in the mid-2000s I wanted to find out who is right who are the winners who are the losers and perhaps most of all can a passionate sports fan like me actually win 1.3 percent of the player pool wins 91 percent of the profits sharks take down 90% of the money our journey into the deep end Roman merchandani is a native Bostonian in recent nyu grad who works at a tech startup we met with him very recently just before New York Bands DFS until then he played daily fantasy sports every week and just makes the games a lot more interesting because now I'm just looking son just waiting for the pass game every week now I'm like slightly more invested into every other game which is fun that Friday he walked me through his picks for Sunday I me a quarterback we got fits for the running backs we got Todd Gurley Doug Martin on the Bucs Titan ladarius green Flex DeAndre Hopkins obviously obviously obviously the daily fantasy sports phenomenon covering virtually every major college and pro sport started with the launch of industry pioneer FanDuel in 2009 followed by its primary competitor draftkings in 2011 DFS is for big money with daily wagers you can play against a single person or in a pool where the top half wins in both cases winning doubles your money or you can play tournaments the most popular of which have million-dollar first prizes merchandani played on the draftkings mobile app so this is the lobby this is where they kind of feature all the different contests you can make sort by you know your risk appetite how much you want to bet what the different prizes are and now it lets you select by position who you actually want to put up and you have your salary here so obviously works up a salary cap basis we joined merchandani and his friends that Sunday to watch the games and track their lineups we actually have a pretty good set up time we'll be cheering for this game I'd be chewing for this game and that's probably none of our own personal teams are playing take Sunday and Monday a lot more interesting DFS has grown exponentially now boasting two million players the vast majority are male and white half are between the ages of 25 and 35 and the majority make more than $75,000 a year feeding the frenzy wall-to-wall commercials like these appealing to the audience's fan hood 1.1 million fans like you have won money on FanDuel families have seventy five million dollars a week get off the sidelines and make some of that yours it can really pay to be a fan fans like you it can really pay to be a fan a narrative both companies push hard you know sports your smart there's money for the take II get in the game baited with the lure of million-dollar paydays the commercial certainly seemed to strike a chord with players like Rome its friend Raj I like waking up Sunday morning knowing that I'm gonna be a millionaire I will talk to the big game but I have very realistic expectations Duffy shoots for the moon after people wake up in there strike big this weekend right that's why we keep playing damn left up I went to school majored in accounting and was a licensed CPA for five years we traveled to Denver to visit Nick Dunham one of the top 20 professional DFS players in the world he's a prime example of the type of player Roman and Raj are actually playing against Dunham started playing casually in 2010 once we realized that you could put more work into it build models and start to hone your skills and get better and better you know it became more like a business than a hobby and Dunham has put his number crunching skills of profitable use his predictive models factored in a host of data including player stats injury reports coaching tendencies and even weather based on the projections that I've given each of these players this is according to my model the optimal team to get the most fantasy points and how much it is final lineup earned him that weekend $40,000 I started making more money playing daily fantasy sports than I was making doing public accounting and that was awesome because you know I mean who could say that they would rather do somebody's books over playing fantasy sports who to put your profit in the terms of a salary about how much do you make in a year from this into the six figures mid-six figures low six figures last year was mid six figures winning if that level requires more than just know-how and dedication it demands a volume and lots of it for football right now it's usually two to three thousand contests per start time like most pros Dunham enters the thousands of contests a week ensuring a large enough sample size for his statistical edge to materialize his daily fantasy sports gambling no absolutely nothing if you have a complete new person who say plays me on one day of MLB and they've never played daily fantasy baseball I guarantee that I would beat them 80 to 90 percent of the time and to me that you know that means it's a game of skill Dunham's very way of life hinges on that distinction as does the fate of the entire industry daily fantasy sports now finds itself in the cross hairs from the satirist s daily fantasy sports the most addictive thing you can do on your phone other than perhaps cocaine to the politicians effectively it's day trading without any regulation at all the industry is under fire based on the very definition of the game under federal law online games of skill are legal whereas gambling is not Tom Griffiths the co-founder of fan duel is unequivocal it's a common misconception that daily fantasy is gambling it's not it's a game of skill we caught up with Griffiths back in October when the separate controversy was in the news employees at two major companies are accused of gambling with inside information that millions of customers did not have newly filed court documents show FanDuel may have encouraged employees to play in other sites but not with inside information when the scandal broke however the companies were quick to respond has it this week abiding our employees meanwhile scrutiny of the industry has ratcheted up the US Department of Justice and FBI are in the preliminary stage of an investigation into daily fantasy sports operators the first shoe to drop was Nevada which declared DFS gambling then came the most high-profile case New York's Attorney General ruled DFS is gambling and illegal in New York estate home to FanDuel and the most players of any other state's industry employees and a few fans fought back staging a protest at the attorney general's office proclaiming billions are riding on that major media companies and other deep pocketed backers including Google and Wall Street Titan KKR have invested in one or the other top two sites even the NBA MLB and Major League Soccer have invested it's easy to see why sports leagues love DFS it's fundamentally changing the way that people consume sports now we see when people start playing Fanjul even if they were a fantasy fan already they consume 40 percent more sports than they had in the past the craze the crash it's reminiscent of online poker a decade ago is DFS headed there too all roads lead to Las Vegas the heart of American gambling culture we're here to meet up with two very different people who know a lot about daily fantasy sports if you got caught up in the poker boom last decade you know ed Miller a pro player and author of one of the definitive books on poker strategy the first book on the subject I read when I started playing seriously he played DFS part-time until Nevada outlawed it in October it you know kind of came out of the poker community a little bit and it was clear you know there's money and it's a game and that's kind of what I do so so I jumped in one of the primary objections I've heard from individuals I've talked to is that they are diehard sports fans who eat sleep live breathe let's say baseball for instance and they're getting consistently beaten by people who are stat geeks what would you say to to that objection you're misunderstanding the game if you think that it's a game that's kind of based around baseball performance but if you don't attack the game aspect first and you think just knowing about baseball it's gonna do the trick you're not gonna win you know it's that simple all the pros we talked to our big sports fans and you do need that knowledge to succeed at DFS but it's not enough you need a lot more to win and if you've ever played any game on the Internet you know that when you first log on and start playing no matter how good you think you are you're gonna get Killip yeah that's just the reality there's people out there on the internet who are way better than you in July Miller made waves co-author in a study that quantified exactly how extreme those disparities in the DFS ecosystem are according to the analysis the pros or sharks represent about one percent of the players but take in more than ninety percent of the profits the big fish come next they lose a lot of money feed the Sharks and keep the ecosystem to float and the minnows or small stakes players are at the bottom representing 80 percent of the players but a small portion of the Miller cautions that it was based on a small sample but the results are directionally accurate the 91% you're saying might be a little bit high but you do think that one and a half percent ish are taking down a pretty substantial portion of the profits absolutely there's not much that was the point of my article I think the game you know has some flaws and and and this is one of the flaws is basically that it is prone to a relatively small number of people taking a lot of the money online poker was similarly lopsided but was brought down in part by site operators offshore headquarters and shady handling of player funds problems DFS doesn't have what do you think are some of the things that an average consumer or sports fan doesn't know about these games that maybe they should before they get involved you probably are not gonna be a winner out of the gate that just knowing about sports is not enough you're gonna have to be immersed in the game you're gonna have to think about it like a game and approach it like a game when I go off that plane I feel alive and I just I want to be close to the action my name is Mario and I'm from Harrison New Jersey and I'm a longshoremen import of knork mariya prefers only to give his first name I met up with him in Las Vegas while he was on vacation but as he tells it Vegas isn't vacation at all when I'm here I'm home and when I'm in New Jersey I think it's just a job for me I would consider myself a gambling man especially when I'm in Las Vegas never really had a problem I never got that deep into things when I had to like hock a ring or sell a car Mario told me he's a bit of a baseball savant falling in love with the game at the age of four and having the ability to read a box score like a book even in elementary school he routinely won season-long fantasy leagues prior to trying out DFS daily fantasy sports started for me in 2014 I heard about it I saw it I saw the commercials and I dipped my toes in to it and I got my my ass handed to me and when you look at the people that finished first or second it's the same names all the time it's never a different name it's kind of like sitting at a blackjack table and somebody's there holding all the Aces how much do you think you have lost playing over the last year and a half money-wise over $10,000 I lost some sleep lost some days at work there was a lot of low points because every day was the same as putting in these hours and getting nothing out out of it at the end of day do you feel like you were cheated out of any money no I know what I know what I was getting to what I was getting to do the money in if I lose I lose I just want to know I get deep fair and square I told Mary you about Ed Miller study one of the most cited findings is that 1.3 percent of players the very top we're taking down somewhere in the neighborhood of 91% of all entry fees entered well I didn't know about that if anyone if I don't about that maybe I want to stop playing that's that's that's tough that's more than what a casino is going to come away with that's wild how does that make you feel it makes me feel like a fish definitely Jonathan bails receive degrees in philosophy and psychological statistics from a small Pennsylvania College in 2009 once a resident of Brooklyn he now calls Philadelphia home I wake up before the Sun comes out because I'm so like excited to just do my job he plays professionally but unlike Nick Dunham in Colorado bales focuses mostly on tournaments and his strategy hinges more on game theory in psychology than predictive analytics it's easier to predict what other people are thinking than it is to predict performance really I'm looking for how can i benefit the most when other people are wrong I think it is a lot like day trading and that you're buying and selling players based on what their perceived value is I think daily fantasy is a much better investment than the stock market really I do because daily fantasies peer-to-peer so if I wanted to play you right for $5,000 nine and I had to have we could do that right but we could do that so it's peer-to-peer so you can have a bit of a bigger edge because his primary focus is tournaments it's not enough to just score a lot of points he has to beat everyone in the field whereas I think most people are trying to maximize like how can I score as many points as possible I don't want to score as many points as possible I want to win a league and I think that those are different todd gurley is gonna be the top owned running back in tournaments that might mean that that's a player that I actually want to get away from this contrarian strategy has been very successful for bales about how much money do you make in a year just just from playing it's in the six figures baseball this year but the first week was the best week I ever had in daily fantasy like the first five days of that movie were ridiculous how much one did you make in five days multiple six figures and then in five days yeah Bale says he had 15 straight losing days after that hot streak but the month was still profitable for him a recurring theme among top players and to say that poker or daily fantasy isn't a game of skill is ridiculous I don't think there's been a three month period ever where I've not made money but is that in in a way a little bit of an unlevel playing field and a bit unfair that you who are a professional at this are playing lots of games against novices the game itself is very an even playing field everyone can approach it everyone could do what I do if they wanted to right like I don't have any special skills what he said next I didn't see coming so Nietzsche I really like to read and he's really influenced the way that I play daily fantasy how it does it Nietzsche influenced the way you play daily fantasy sports I think just the general process of like critiquing everything and thinking about how we are going to go about solving problems is generally helpful DFS is a gambling or skill I think pros like Dunham and bales prove it requires a specific and sophisticated set of skills which means for people like Mary you and me it doesn't pay to be a fan not really that's just not enough for casual players picking up the game they're gonna start thinking well what players should you know whereas when I approach the game I that's not the first question is what is the first question who knows how to win you know how do you win this
