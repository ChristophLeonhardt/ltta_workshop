day I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show we have so much to get to today we it's just War World War the whole time Alicia Krause from the conversation at the Daily wire is making her panel of deplorable stay beyou but before we get to any of that I have very good news especially for me but I guess for all of us we have a new sponsor we have a sponsor we're gonna keep the lights on we're gonna job we're gonna keep my cup full of coffe fa for maybe a week or two longer uh we we have to talk about stamps calm stamps calm is great I've been saying these sponsors are all kind of providential because they speak to my deepest most central desires I am a millennial I'm a member of the much-maligned millennial generation the one thing about Millennials I speak from experience and from the heart we want everything like right now we want it on-demand we can get everything on demand I don't want to have to go to the post office I don't want to have to go to any

us keep the lights on okay we've got so much to get to right now let's begin with this story that's all over the news Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson it's always some Florida woman has come out swinging against President Trump with an allegation that one of her constituents a Goldstar Widow received a phone call from Trump after her son sergeant Lee David Johnson was killed in niger two weeks ago a Wilson alleged that this is the congresswoman alleged that Trump told told the widow quote well I guess he knew what he signed up for but I guess it still hurt we don't know what he said you know we do know that this Florida congresswoman is pretty kooky and she comes from a far left ideological background she famously introduced a congressional resolution to honor Trayvon Martin she called for Trump's impeachment a couple months ago and she wears these weird hats all the time the timing is also a little coincidental just a couple days ago Trump suggested that Obama didn't call gold star families when soldiers were killed in action now we have this Democratic rep swinging back a great guy on Twitter Matt's ideas shop laid it out fairly well in a likely unlikely diagram because look Trump may have said something to that effect he's not exactly the most eloquent guy in the world he might have said something to the effect of my condolences your husband made the ultimate sacrifice he bravely enlisted he he knew what he signed up for he's ready to give his life he's a hero so that's one version of this some some series of those kind of lines or he might have said hey yo it's me the Donald your husband know what he signed up for are we cool what do you think it is I don't I'm sorry I don't care how in our particulate Donald Trump can be I don't think it was the latter I he may have said some comment to that effect but the Democratic congresswoman who's made this a cudgel given the timing and given her past history I think it is worth questioning what her political motives are here regardless the the really sad thing about this episode is that there's a brave American sergeant Lee David Johnson who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country for my freedom and for yours and he's now being used as a blunt political cuddle by a cynical Democrat congresswoman it's really awful and and we shouldn't give it we should address it obviously we should address the allegations but we should not spend more time talking about this the cynical woman this this democratic propagandist that even even if she's alluding to some truthful comment here is obviously twisting it for political purposes in other war related news my battle ax of a cousin Hilary Clinton is despicably mouthing off on foreign soil the former future president slammed president Trump's North Korea policy as quote dangerous and short-sighted today during a speech in South Korea she alleged quote picking fights with Kim jong-un just puts a smile on his face I think the real quote went like but we were translating it obviously for for the American audience the irony defies reason but then the Clintons are immune to shame Donald Trump is clemens von Metternich compared to Hillary Clinton let's just establish that first she has no credibility here her disastrous handling of foreign affairs from the failed Russia reset to her awful handling of crises in Egypt and Libya and elsewhere in the world it should disqualify her from saying boo about geopolitics but more than that she and particularly her husband bear the lion's share of the blame for the North Korean nuclear crisis that we find ourselves in in 1994 people might not remember this Bill Clinton refused to respond when Kim Jong Il pursued nuclear weapons and when Kim Jong Il refused to allow weapons inspectors to review two of his nuclear waste sites in complete violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty then Hillary Clinton not just first lady she was also later Secretary of State she executed a North Korea strategy known as this is not a joke strategic patience strategic patience you you couldn't make that up in political satire and that strategic patience was very unstraight because it only allowed the threat to grow president Trump and Secretary of State Tillerson their handling of North Korea has apparently been pretty good so far from from what we can tell it's very hard we're getting mixed signals we don't really we're not dead and we're not de we haven't been obliterated yet you know he Trump secured the release of that american student otto warmbier who was jailed by the Kim regime during the Obama administration but fine Hillary is bitter that she lost the presidency twice she can't get over it she's clearly being ripped apart from the inside out who cares the real offense here is that she's criticizing US policy on foreign soil there has long been a taboo against doing this you know we have robust political debates at home and then abroad American citizens are supposed to present a united front they're supposed to refrain from criticizing the present policy overseas Hillary however is immune from shame patriotism be damned my cousin what a what a traumatic family reunion this will be next year the third battlefront the president Trump faces right now is the apparently Steve Bannon induced war between the White House and Mitch McConnell president Trump standing next to McConnell at this press conference claimed quote my relationship with this gentleman is outstanding very Trump he endures for the exclamation point at the end McConnell echoed this he said contrary to what some of you have reported we are together totally on this agenda to move America forward but then Donald Trump in typical fashion went on to say that he also quote totally understands the frustrations of Steve Bannon and Bannon plans to run primaries against congressional leadership and establishment Republicans Bannon has declared hashtag war on the Republican establishment and the conservative establishment for that manner for analysis on this last bit on the ban in McConnell Trump who knows what's happening we have to bring on our expert panel of deplorable z an all-female panel just to celebrate Harvey steena in Hollywood falling apart we decided to bring all the ladies on the show today we have in Marathi from the Daily Caller we have Amanda presto Giacomo from The Daily wire and making her panel of deplorable 'z debut we have Alicia Krause our old friend Alicia Kraus who you might have seen on the conversation yesterday with Andrew Clavin and now the Daily wires very own ladies thank you for being here thanks first question Alicia in the war between Trump McConnell and Bannon who was winning haha I don't know that Bannon is at war with Trump I have this kind of conspiracy theory that he is working behind the scenes and talking to Donald is like I got your back bro and he really is doing these things to it that he thinks maybe are helping Donald Trump I think that I think that Bannon might be winning this game though because as we saw in the Alabama primary or the Alabama race down there and ended up being bannon's guy that won not Trump's guy and I think that Trump would like to blame Mitch McConnell for that I don't know if that's gonna end up coming out on if he's gonna end up you know coming out on top with that argument but I think that Bannon is apparently recruiting candidates across the country to pursue and push forward legislation and agendas that Bannon thinks are what Trump should be doing that he isn't doing anymore and that's how Bannon positions his exit from the White House I said I mean I'm not being fired I was always gonna leave I can help Trump a lot more from the outside than I can on the inside maybe that's true maybe it is an Amber is Bannon just trying to position himself in the best possible light at trying to make himself seem like a player here I think that's what ben ben shapiro suggested earlier today or is he acting on behalf of the White House like Alicia thinks I think it's a little bit of both I think Alicia is right that Bannon is probably of the mindset that he's helping Trump by opposing these supposedly anti Trump candidates but at the same time I don't think he really has as much power as he lets on when you look at the Alabama race Roy Moore was already really really popular and slated to win that race so I'm not sure how much of an effect Bannon really had there and if you consider the fact that he thinks that being at Breitbart gets him a lot of power that would mean that places like the Daily Caller and The Daily wire would also be able to you know shape a lot troll races and I'm just not sure that that's really the case oh I feel no offense does yeah I don't know I kind of feel like I can zap lightning out of my fingers or something but maybe that's just a difference of reaction Amanda Trump has been saying very nice things about Mitch McConnell regardless of the Bannen dynamics regardless of whether they're working in collusion he's been saying nice things about like one of the most detested Republicans in the country pigs are flying on a cold day in hell how long will the bromance last as long as it's beneficial to trump I mean he'll he can turn on McConnell at the drop of the Hat so it's Trump knows how to play this game better than anyone if you think it's beneficial to you know cozy ups to McConnell and have that presser with Earl bloody buddy then he'll do it and then the second he wants to put the blame back on McConnell he will and we've seen that before so it's just whatever is beneficial to Trump he'll spin it in a way that you know it's it you know McConnell's good or bad whatever people are knocking him because they say he has a tough relationship with the truth you know he says one thing one day says one thing the next I actually really like it I do think the New Yorker thing is is it play with my read on that because that is just how New Yorkers talk they'll come out they'll say oh yeah I love this guy he's like a brother to me yeah he's he's doing the great look in the back yeah and then the next you know the next day if he if if McConnell stabs Trump in the back he'll say he's a total loser I hate his guts and who cares you know there's like a and then he'll come back around his um I don't say dishonesty but his relationship with the truth I think it's sort of guileless here he's very open you know that Donald Trump is gonna do that see you know the minute McDonald turns on him it's gonna be no-holds-barred yeah and it helps him kind of push whatever he wants for it because they know that he's you know oh I'm in his good graces no for the second so they know them along that way gotta love it it's that that's that I think I compared him to met her knee earlier in the show that that's the I don't know if future historians will recognize the political genius of Donald Trump but they probably should he's actually been working at a much and I think a lot of people gave him credit for okay we've got a lot more news to get to we we have to get to the war on Halloween before the war on Christmas there's now we're on Halloween there is so much to talk about but if you don't subscribe to the daily wire you can't see the rest of it we appreciate all the current subscribers you're helping keep the lights on you're helping keep cuff fa and like in my tumblr but for the rest of you go over there right now you'll get me you'll get the Andrew Clavin show you'll get the Ben Shapiro show all that it's just $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership but I know you're thinking that's a lot of shows who cares whatever but look at this guys look at this the leftist tears tumblr filled to the brim with coffe FA right now yeah this is the finest mechanism for drinking tasty leftist ears in the country this the vintage we've prepared here is actually from South Korea it's from so laughter Hillary Clinton's speech obviously it's not a limited run because Hillary Clinton has been spouting salty leftist ears for nine months now and really for the better part of 30 years but you can have that vintage can be yours if you go to the daily wire calm right now we'll be right back an Englishman who has spent 40 years as an active member of a white supremacist movement has announced that he is a gay Jew and he's retiring from neo Nazism Alysha we're talking about a Jewish neo-nazi here do we have a clip of this guy were you thinking of your mom no why not because because that term the Jews you're presenting a global faceless mass of people you know you can't personalize these you can't see an individual there that's not even your mom no and that's the sort of generalization that results in six million people being deliberately murdered we've heard this term Jewish neo-nazi before that's what all the crazy campus lefties call been every time he shows up there this guy it's a really interesting interview he explains that he joined the neo-nazis and the white nationalists and all that because he was a loner basically he didn't have any friends he didn't have anything to do do you think I don't want to get into too much psychobabble yeah do you think that explains some of these all right guys - I'm not talking about the Peppe people who mischievous I'm talking about the real racist neo-nazi types Richard Spencer and does that social ostracism explain their political actions I may be potentially I think this also ties into the hashtag me to campaign bear with me for a moment I think Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro pointed out really good points that when society doesn't have a standard that's set of like what real men need to do and then manliness in general by many in the leftist feminist movement is kind of poo pooed on and looked down on then unfortunately sometimes you have men that look to the wrong types of groups to create those friendships and those standards of decency that are like really bad and shouldn't be followed and then once they become a part of that group they adhere to all those ideas because they don't want to lose their circle of friends on a very extreme level we've seen this with Isis and how Isis targets young men specifically on Twitter and in educational you know places and in some radical mosques around the world and I think that it make sense that the KKK and these neo-nazi groups would be recruiting people and members in the same way but I mean his interview was really impactful and a friend of the program Bethany Mandel has pointed out that when you target those people in a good way and befriend them and show them the face of women Christians Jews gay people black people they have a really hard time than just identifying hatred toward the entire group because I've gotten to know you as an individual of course I love that dynamic they're the individual versus these collective group identities and yeah I think that's certainly the case even with the me to comparison there there is not in the culture and an ideal of what masculinity should look like what manliness should look like I think it's the same with these neo-nazi types they say they're defending Western civilization but they don't really understand what Western civilization is or adhere to those values so they say we want to protect Christendom but we want nothing to do with Christianity yeah that absolutely excellent analogy amber lefties call anybody on the right racist fascist neo-nazi whatever they have they accuse us of hate just as they would accuse David Duke of hate or Richard Spencer how do we make sure that we don't wake up someday or woke up probably is more like it and disavow all of the views that we hold right now how do we know that we're not as crazy and awful as they say that we are well part of the reason why we're not going to wake up one day and disavow our views is because for what our views are rooted in truth are not eightfold bigoted views as the left would have us believe so we kind of have an advantage over the people who are actually neo-nazis because we are grounded in some kind of truth and value do you think that these neo-nazi guys don't you think these neo-nazi guys think that their racial theories are rooted in truth you know and when we just have we have other theories that we ground our political views in how do we know that we have the right one said we know that we have the true ones man you just went full lefty on me you know I think it's it shows why why it's so important to be really we're full about how we label people and how we collectivize people because if you're going by that standard then anyone could be enough anyone could be a neo-nazi anybody could be hateful we could easily turn that turn term around on the left and accuse them of being neo-nazis and if they defend it you can just say well of course you don't think you are because you don't want to you know you don't want to face yeah absolutely it's really dangerous right yeah exactly so it just shows how important language is and how people will if you overuse terms they start to lose his meaning and they start to lose their value and we easily could turn that term around on them I mean a lot of the premises that are shared by these far fringy extremist racial groups yeah neo-nazis or whatever or premises that are indulged in by the left that racial group identity is is what defines a person rather than a person's soul inequality before God and individuality by the way I think that's why we're not going to woke up some day and realize that really we should have been you know lefty social justice warriors is because they're their premises are similarly wrong to those neo-nazi premises and as Alicia suggested you know we're the ones who are saying look at the individual judge the individual you know we're all all created in God's image and we have to live out those ideas that have been that have caused the west and that have been developed in the West but part of these problems I mean not to get to theological here but I get ideological we're delving into Shiite Catholicism on this show so please are you know it created in the image of God and that's where our belief in natural law starts and the Equality of man starts but unfortunately in our culture leftist have distanced God from the involvement of human importance right our human value especially I mean look at what they do to babies in utero and so therefore that individualism isn't important to them because they do like the group think of you you are this and this group is more important than this because it's more politically appropriate or it can be a political use to them and a tool to them at that time and it started years and years ago with the growth of you know progressivism and that movement away from where does natural law come from and the belief and our founders that you know this has to come from God and this is where this right came from and it's not being taught to kids today I mean I was hashtag homeschool of 12 years but I've even talked to fellow home schoolers and other Millennials I'm a grandma malonyl you're on the younger millennial age you know I'm a few years older than you it isn't taught to an entire swath of Americans and it hasn't been for 20 plus years so really I think in order to not wake up one day and to answer your question a little bit we have to start training people of where those rights come from and what what you know America really stands for and that's that's where it begins it doesn't begin when you're donating to politicians it's a lot earlier than that and it's how the left has gained so much ground Amanda this guy was a member of the National Front it's a very fringy for right UK political party it doesn't have any seats in parliament or anything it's fuscia stick it's nationalistic is there any fear for us that good old red white and blue American nationalism American patriotism that it will morph into a grotesque like National Front racial populism I mean there's always the threat of that I suppose I mean we've seen it you know it's basically reactionary right like we've seen this during the 2016 election or we had the rise of the all right maybe a couple years before that because the left as I keep moving left they perpetuate this groupthink identity politics to keep moving that way and and and then plus on top of that they called their opponents you know racists and bigots and homophobes and all and all this and that you kind of have this reaction to kind of you know kind of fill into that same identity politics thinking and then kind of fulfilling that prophecy that they called you so sure there's there's definitely a threat of that happening and like I said we kind of have like this very small minority of actual potent white supremacist because again all rights like I'm just saying the left keeps pushing left and they keep playing politics sure you can see a reaction and then also I mean I don't know how PC this is but I think you know a mixing of demographics as we keep getting more mixed and there's no assimilation that's the key part when they're not adopting American values you're gonna have some conflict unfortunately so I think assimilation is huge too that can kind of you know push this this alt-right movement a little you know give it more prominence turn out that temperature in that melting pot got to make it all melt a little a little faster make a big delicious American goop a nice fondue a nice American fun do is what I want yeah an elementary school in Massachusetts has canceled Halloween they have canceled Halloween for not being quote inclusive enough in its place they will now hold black and orange spirit day amber is this white Trump one yeah actually it is because this is just another example of how people think it's more important to not offend other sense of other people's sensibilities and it is to I don't know have fun or even just promote truth you know I think this was black and orange day sounds a little bit racist you know throw in a term block around like that was that about and orange against people of of El Presidente's descent all the time Google actually it was being called out I think it was yesterday because they added this part to Google Maps or if you click on a root they tell you how many calories you can burn if you walk the route instead of driving and then it's like oh if you could burn 300 calories that's three mini cupcakes and people got really offended by that and we're really triggered by it and like force them to remove this so apparently offending people is or not offending people is more important than I don't know combating the obesity epidemic in the United States amber is a Kevon myself I am deeply triggered by that I don't want to know how many calories now I'm just oh now all I can think about is cupcakes the story of this Halloween story it gets to my central theory of the left that the left what it really wants is the the Hollow she'll the husk of an institution of a great institution but not the animating principle of it not all the stuff that's inside so they drink decaf coffee they get fancy university degrees without a university education that you see it in a lot of churches I think I actually thought about this in Westminster it has the husk the Anglican Church the husk of a liturgy and traditional church but it's gotten watered-down in a lot of its principles and its dogma so it you know it's been much like my dear alma mater Yale has been invaded by the left and hollowed out because of it is black and orange day Alicia is it actually different than Halloween what is the difference here if you change those words what what changes I actually read this piece and I was like wait a second is is this any different than Halloween they will take my daughter's elementary school Halloween from like parade from me within my cold dead hands it's like I am all for the full family Halloween Casa or amazing at Halloween seriously if you like Halloween get married and have kids and then you can enjoy it forever like it is amazing but I I don't know how different it is and it's so funny because in their effort to not offend anyone I think that they are really offending more people I mean Halloween is like a pagan holiday growing up in the Bible Belt of America like we couldn't celebrate Halloween we had to dress up as Bible character do this thing called a hell house were you going you get scared by sin there's actually people like that they're there now they're trying to appease the leftist like politically correct people but they're probably like unknowingly appeasing a lot of Southern Baptists somewhere in the country it's gonna have the opposite effect that they intended tell them that and they will immediately reinstate Halloween it'll be a matter of minutes Amanda the reason they canceled Halloween allegedly is because Halloween is not inclusive enough you know the holiday where you dress up like whatever you want and get a candy corn what is meant by inclusion by these school administrators yeah I'm so mad you asked me this because I had the same question I was like I really had no I was like how how you can dresses everything you want um I don't know honestly this is kind of like Infowars II but I don't know this is the conspiracy central baby bring it to us maybe there's like some religious I don't know somebody complaining so they want it like preemptively stop everything and it's probably not a Christian family I don't know I mean who knows I mean I mean no one's terrified of you know everything these days too perhaps I just wanted to you know preemptively appease people who are not gonna celebrate Halloween and I don't think it's the Christians that they're looking out for so I don't know maybe that's the good unintended consequence of this it's like put the Christ back in Christmas it's put the Hallows back in Halloween put the Saints back in it I don't know that's I'm always trying to look on the bright side of these things yeah actually I don't like Halloween like I'm that oh I'm like a you know inside I'm like a 75 year old southern I'm like Baptist preacher like I I feel all nice and like Saint Church am like I don't like it that is so beautiful because Amanda you do have a reputation and you're in your writing of being a little you know on occasion curmudgeonly I do love the idea of like a little trick or treater knocking on your door he's ripped the candy from them have everybody sing like hymns and that's beautiful that's a beautiful thing very Christian you're probably saving their souls moving on Senator Rand Paul has recently slammed John McCain and Lindsey Graham I know you're shocked he slammed them for parading as conservatives Senator Paul tweeted senators McCain and Graham are torpedoing the budget by insisting on busting the budget caps for more spending Amanda this Rand Paul have any credibility here he has been torpedoing conservative legislation all year except that he's doing it from a libertarian perspective instead of from a neoconservative perspective I gotta go with Rand Paul here he's the only one who somewhat sticks to conservative libertarian like libertarian values and yes he's been kind of a thorn in the side of President Trump but as we just saw with the health care thing he's you know he helps with that executive order to do a lot more get rid of regulation so I think I mean I don't want to sound like a chill for for Rand Paul here but I feel like he's actually trying to push something semi libertarians semi conservative because because my goodness I mean McCain and Graham I mean they're you know they're all the way on the Left I kind of think that he does have some credibility just because uh every now and then he'll stick to his principles I will say I've been hitting Rand Paul a lot in the last few weeks because he's been completely useless in the Senate recently but he is on the side of fiscal responsibility here he is he's brought up a term that people have have not been discussing even conservatives haven't been discussing all year which is federal spending which is the national debt which is debt to GDP amber do you think that in this age of cultural battles and which is clearly what we're in it's clearly what we elected Donald Trump to do ken debt to GDP ratios still excite conservatives gosh I really hope so I'm reminded of the days back is from like 2008 to 2012 where the Tea Party was really popular and they were all about bringing down the national debt and even if this isn't something that's super popular among maybe Donald Trump space there are still conservatives in Congress who care about this we saw this in all of these debates about the disaster relief bills just yesterday a bunch of conservatives voted against a bill that would help were to reco because they were upset that a lot of the spending with wasn't going to straight disaster relief I think mark Meadows was among those Jim Jordan so it's still something that they talked about it's not as to the front of the conversation as it used to be but I think President Trump would be really smart to get on board with lowering the national debt because he loves to talk about GDP growth and as we all know a 20 trillion dollar national debt is not going to be super useful for growing the economy when you have something like ninety percent debt to GDP or approach you know we Pro tching 100% debt to GDP that is a drag on the economy it would be nice if they did that back to McCain Alicia John McCain has malignant brain cancer it's unlikely that he will be around this time next year but this guy is gonna go down swinging he's gonna swing against his political opponents he's gonna probably swing against his own brain cancer you got it even if you don't agree with McCain on a lot of things as I don't you do kind of have to admire that spirit I mean this guy is piss and vinegar pretty much till the end do you do you think that conservatives knowing that John McCain is not long for this world can we in good taste fight back against his terrible legislative goals well one I hope that he does fight this and when I mean he is the maverick and I think that that would have been something that they should have pushed a little more back in 2008 when he was running against then-senator Barack Obama I think that there are a lot of pros of McCain's character and past experience that they the you know people that were working on the campaign didn't work on enough and I think that they're still members of the GOP in the Senate that can go to the senator and and they can work together I really don't think that he wants to go down destroying his side of the aisle I don't think that at all but I think it could be interesting to see what happens and listen I mean Rand Paul has been as divisive to goals of the GOP as John McCain and Lindsey Graham have so I think that there just tends to be a lot of attention on Senator McCain because of where he is in his life and the specific things he said about the president that maybe Rand Paul isn't saying right and I hope you know John McCain is a mixed bag to conservatives he has been a RINO for a long time but he also has been a Republican fighter before he ran for president in 2000 he was pretty reliably on the right voted pretty reliably with Republicans it would be nice if in this last part of his career if he would come back and help us out and and affect some policy rather than just run down trumps agenda but I don't know I don't think he watches my show we should make him some things to be fair there are some things in Trump's agenda that ain't so conservative and so you know if if McCain is going to run down the parts of Trump's agenda that aren't conservative then I am all for him in that way sure sure but we hope we just hope at something like Obamacare repeal or something that should be a no-brainer yeah you know that he'll he'll come around on it but I guess we'll have to wait and see that's our show today panel thank you for being here amber Athey from The
