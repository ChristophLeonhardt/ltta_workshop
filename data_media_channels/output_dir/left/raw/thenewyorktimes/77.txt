1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,590
Ants are great tunnelers.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,280
That’s how they make
their nests underground.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,310
But even they run into traffic
jams, like this one here.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,750
That’s not surprising.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,530
But the solution is.
Experiments with fire ants

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,070
showed that the key to
avoiding jams and

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,660
solving ones that do
occur is idleness —

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,310
30 percent of the ants do
70 percent of the work.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,100
And that turns
out to be ideal.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,530
Add more ants to
the working pool,

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,440
and productivity suffers.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,950
It’s not that any
particular ants are lazy,

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,740
or that they know how to
avoid jams completely.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,300
Ants do pile up.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,030
But they’re easily
discouraged by a jam

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,490
and good at backing
up and turning around,

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,490
allowing the remaining
workers to continue digging.

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,370
Some of the ants don’t
even go near the tunnel.

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,290
The researchers tested
their ideas

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,310
about optimal ant behavior
using robots

21
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,150
and magnetized spheres.

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,030
With simple instructions
to gather the spheres,

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,520
the robots all rushed to
work at the same time.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,960
The result: gridlock.

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,170
But with some idleness
programmed in,

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,000
the robots were
more productive.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,330
Here you can see the original
group versus ones programmed

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,100
to think more like ants.

29
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,260
In the real world, this
kind of programming

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,360
could make robot swarms
more effective

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,310
at searching disaster sites
or delivering drugs

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,660
inside the body.

33
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,930
So why don’t ants just
make wider tunnels

34
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,600
with more room for digging?

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,280
Well, here’s what happens
in a wider tunnel.

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,100
Sometimes, it’s hard
to hang onto the sides.

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,860
And sometimes, they
completely lose their grip.

38
00:01:35,860 --> 00:00:00,000
How embarrassing.
