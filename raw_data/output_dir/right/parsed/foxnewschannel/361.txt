ON NO DOUBT.
THANK YOU FOR LEADING US ALL.
HEAR JOHN KENNEDY FROM
LOUISIANA.
HE SITS ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.
GOOD EVENING.
>> GOOD EVENING, ED.
>> Ed: LAST WEEK YOU CALLED THIS
AN INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW.
WHERE ARE WE TONIGHT.
>> IT'S AN ENTER GALACTIC FREAK
SHOW ON STEROIDS.
>> Ed: WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
WE THINK HE WILL BE CONFIRMED
UNLESS THERE'S A SURPRISE.
>> I'M VERY PLEASED.
THERE'S NO WINNERS.
I'LL BET YOU THIS TIME JUDGE
KAVANAUGH TOMORROW NIGHT, JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, WHO I THINK WILL BE
CONFIRMED AND I'M VERY PLEASED,
HE WON'T FEEL LIKE A WINNER.
I BET DR. FORD AND HER FAMILY
WON'T FEEL LIKE A WINNER.
IT ALL COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED
IF SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAD TURNED
OVER DR. FORD'S ANONYMOUS NOTE
TO US, WE COULD HAVE
INVESTIGATED WITHOUT THE
INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW.
IT'S VERY, VERY SAD.
THERE'S NO WINNERS.
>> SPEAKING OF SENATOR
FEINSTEIN, YOUR CHAIRMAN,
REPUBLICAN CHUCK GRASSLEY ON
"FOX AND FRIENDS" DID NOT NAME
HER BUT HE SUGGESTED THAT
DEMOCRATS TRIED TO COACH
WITNESSES TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> WE UNDERSTAND THAT LELAND
KAISER, THE FORMER FRIEND OF
DR. FORD, FEELS -- FELT PRESSURE
TO RE-VISIT HER DENIAL OF
KNOWING ABOUT THE ALLEGED
ASSAULT.
>> I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE FBI REPORT.
BUT THERE'S EVIDENCE ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED
THAT THEY WERE LED INTO IT AS
WELL.
>> YOU SAW THAT FBI REPORT.
WHAT IS HE REFERRING TO?
>> I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT
EITHER.
IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE NOT TO
RELEASE THE FBI REPORT.
I TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL
DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS.
>> Ed: YOU'RE TANTALIZING US
MORE.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO CALLED FOR
TRANSPARENCY, I NOTICED SHE
KEEPS SAYING WE NEED TO KEEP
THIS FBI REPORT CONFIDENTIAL.
THAT'S BECAUSE DEMOCRATS DON'T
WANT US TO SEE SOMETHING?
>> I DISAGREE WITH HER.
I AGREE WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY'S
COMMENTS.
UNDER THE LAW, WE CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THE DETAILS.
I WISH WE COULD.
IT'S CLEAR TO ME NOW MORE THAN
EVER THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF
POLITICS INVOLVED IN THIS.
FBI INTERVIEWED EVERY ONE OF THE
WITNESSES SUGGESTED BY
MRS. RAMIREZ AND DR. FORD.
NOT A SINGLE ONE CORROBORATED
THE ALLEGATIONS.
AND THERE WERE SOME INDICATIONS
OF POLITICS.
AND I THINK WE'RE MAKING A
MISTAKE NOT TO ALLOW THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THIS
REPORT AND JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES.
I TRUST THEM.
>> Ed: YOU SAID ALSO IN RECENT
DAYS THAT CONGRESS HAS HIT ROCK
BOTTOM AND KEEPS ON DIGGING.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE
REFERRING TO THIS.
BUT THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER
NANCY PELOSI COMPARED JUDGE
KAVANAUGH TO A DICTATOR.
LISTEN.
>> I GUESS THERE'S A SIMILARITY
THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT THEY -- LOVE WITH KIM
JONG-UN, THINKS KAVANAUGH IS A
GREAT OUTSTANDING PERSON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S
TALKING ABOUT.
>> Ed: HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT?
>> I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SAY
THIS, BUT I'M GOING TO BE FRANK.
BILLY GOAT BRAIN,
MOUTH.
>> Ed: WOW.
>> THAT'S JUST TYPICAL.
THAT'S SYMBOLIC OF ALL THAT HAS
GONE ON.
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS
WAY.
THERE'S SOME HIGH POINTS --
>> Ed: SUCH AS WHAT?
LET'S GIVE A POSITIVE.
>> I'M SO PLEASED THAT JUDGE
KAVANAUGH WILL BE CONFIRMED.
I'M SO PLEASED THAT DUE PROCESS
STILL MATTERS IN AMERICA.
I'M SO PLEASED THAT THERE'S MORE
AWARENESS ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE
IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S
REAL.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY REAL.
>> Ed: IN FACT, YOU SAID THE
OTHER DAY THERE'S NO ROOM FOR
CREEPY OLD MEN OR CREEPY YOUNG
MEN.
BUT THIS IS NOT A COUNTRY, THIS
IS NOT AMERICA WITHOUT INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE
ADVANCED THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE
MORALLY TAINTED IF YOU DON'T
AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THE
ACCUSER.
THAT'S WRONG.
THAT'S UN-AMERICAN.
YOU'RE MORALLY TAINTED IF YOU
DON'T TREAT BOTH THE ACCUSER AND
THE ACCUSED WITH FAIRNESS AND
WITH RESPECT AND WITH DUE
PROCESS.
BUT THIS PROCESS, I MEAN,
FINALLY WE DECIDED THAT PEOPLE
WERE GOING TO HAVE DUE PROCESS.
BUT IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE
EPISODE, IF OUR FOUNDERS COULD
HAVE ENVISIONED CONFIRMATION
BEING LIKE THIS, A COUPLE
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE STUCK WITH
KING GEORGE.
IT'S BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT.
>> YOU'RE HAPPY THAT JUDGE
KAVANAUGH WILL BECOME JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH.
BUT THERE MAY BE AN ASTERISKS IF
YOU LIVE TO DEMOCRATS.
JOHN PAUL STEPHENS HAD THIS TO
SAY ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT.
LISTEN.
>> HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED
WHEN HE WAS EARLIER.
BUT HIS PERFORMANCE CAUSED ME TO
CHANGE MY MIND.
>> Ed: I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY
HE WAS ACCUSED FALSELY OF RAPE.
BUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH ADMITTED
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GONE TOO FAR,
SIR.
>> LOOK, JUSTICE STEPHENS IS
ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION.
THIS IS AMERICA.
WHAT I SAW FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH
AT THE HEARING WAS A HUMAN BEING
RESPONDING TO BEING CALLED RICH,
LYING, DRUNK, SEXUAL PREDATOR
AND HE RESPONDED HE WAS OFFENDED
ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF, HIS
REPUTATION, HIS SPOUSE, HIS
13-YEAR-OLD AND HIS 10-YEAR-OLD.
I SAW A HUMAN BEING RESPONDING
TO WILD ACCUSATIONS.
THAT HE HATED WOMEN.
HE HATED CHILDREN.
HE HATED LITTLE WARM PUPPIES.
HE WAS EVIL.
THIS THING -- THIS THING WOULD
BE OVER THE TOP IF SOME PEOPLE
BELIEVED IN A TOP.
>> Ed: SENATOR, I HAVE LESS THAN
A MINUTE.
YOU JUST HEARD JOHN ROBERTS
REPORT THAT PEOPLE ALREADY ON
THE LEFT SAYING THAT SUSAN
COLLINS FOR VOTING FOR THE JUDGE
IS AN APOLOGIST FOR RAPISTS.
YOU HAD PEOPLE ACCUSE JUDGE
KAVANAUGH OF BEING A RAPIST HE
SAYS FALSELY.
HOW DO WE PICK UP THE PIECES?
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP?
WE HAVE A MID-TERM ELECTION THAT
MIGHT BE NASTIER.
AFTER THAT ELECTION, HOW DO YOU
PICK UP THE PIECES?
>> I WOULD SAY NUMBER 1, WE HAVE
TO RECOGNIZE THAT SEXUAL
VIOLENCE IS REAL IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THERE'S NO COUNTRY FOR CREEPY
OLD MEN OR MIDDLE AGED MEN, BUT
IT'S NO COUNTRY AT ALL WITHOUT
DUE PROCESS.
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES.
NO ONE IS GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN
INNOCENT.
YOU'RE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN
GUILTY.
