00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,756
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS NUMBER 4 IN

3
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:15,957
THE HOUSE.

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,561
JOE CROWLEY LOSING INTO A WIDE

00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,963
MARGIN TONIGHT TO A 28-YEAR-OLD

00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,399
BERNIE SANDERS ORGANIZER OWN

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,236
DORSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC

8
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,604
SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA.

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:31,740
28-YEAR-OLD COURTEZ MIGHT BE THE

10
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,609
FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

11
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:38,947
TONIGHT HOW DEMOCRATS HOPING FOR

12
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:48,156
A POST-PELOSI ERA ARE LEFT

13
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:48,340
LEADER

14
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:48,924
LEADE

15
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:49,324
LEADERLESS.

16
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,359
THE FORMER ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,695
CLINTON MARK PEN AND DERRIK

18
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:57,499
MARK, THIS IS A YOUNG WOMAN,

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,768
THERE IS A TWEET SHOWING HER A

20
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,303
YEAR AGO TENDING BAR.

21
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:11,413
FAR-LEFT IDEAS.

22
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:13,315
SHE UPENDED THE NUMBER 4

23
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,215
DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE.

24
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,258
NOT EXPECTED TO WIN.

25
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,193
HAS SOME STRONG VIEWS AGAINST

26
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,861
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN THERE A

27
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:27,829
LONG TIME AND SPENT $3 MILLION

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,501
AND DIDN'T GET HIS VOTE OUT.

29
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:36,371
THERE WERE 26,000 VOTES IN A

30
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:38,773
DISTRICT THAT IS 90% DEMOCRATIC.

31
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:40,742
IN REALITY, VERY FEW PEOPLE

32
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:41,109
VOTED.

33
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,580
SHE DID A GREAT JOB ORGANIZING.

34
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:49,317
SHE WON.

35
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,319
OTHER CHALLENGES IN THE LEFT IN

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,854
CHICAGO WERE BEATEN BACK.

37
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:55,991
HERE'S WHERE THE LEFT PICKED ONE

38
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:01,429
DISTRICT.

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,264
>> Shannon: HOW DO YOU THINK

40
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,634
THIS WILL PLAY OUT IN THE FALL?

41
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:07,502
IF SHE COMES TO CAPITOL HILL

42
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,537
IT'S SOMEBODY WHO IS FAR LEFT.

43
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,477
ENDORSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC

44
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:15,877
SOCIALISTS.

45
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:17,312
>> SHE'LL BE A BACK BENCHER THAT

46
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:23,818
SHE WILL BE A HIT ON THE CABLE

47
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,487
NEWS CIRCUIT AND A MEDIA

48
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,122
CELEBRITY BUT NOT AN EFFECTIVE

49
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:28,256
MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

50
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:34,295
TURNING OVER SOMEBODY IN

51
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:37,198
LEADERSHIP WHO COULD GET THINGS

52
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,499
KNOW.

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,667
I AM NOT HEART BROKEN.

54
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:42,103
I THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT

55
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,255
FRANKENSTEIN

56
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,240
FRANKENSTEI

57
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,876
FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER RETURNS.

58
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:53,732
THE LEFT PREACHED TRIBUNAL

59
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:53,982
THE LEFT PREACHED TRIBUNA

60
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,455
PROGRESSIVE AND ONLY NEEDED TO

61
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,956
SAY AND SUPPORT THE RIGHT

62
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:02,290
THINGS.

63
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,525
HE WAS NOT A MODERATE.

64
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:06,828
THE IDEA OF A WHITE MAN

65
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,797
REPRESENTING THAT DISTRICT WAS A

66
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:10,365
BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR MANY.

67
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,199
THEY LOST.

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,335
I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

69
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:16,404
>> Shannon: MARK, WHAT DO YOU

70
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,305
MAKE ABOUT THIS?

71
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:20,341
WE HAVE SEEN THIS PLAYING IN

72
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,577
CALIFORNIA WHERE DIANE FEINSTEIN

73
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,480
A LONG MAIN STAY WAS NOT

74
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,917
ENDORSED BY HER OWN PARTY IN

75
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:29,317
CALIFORNIA.

76
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,585
THEY WENT WITH SOMEBODY MUCH

77
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,186
FURTHER TO THE LEFT.

78
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:32,921
>> WELL, MOST OF THE CHALLENGES

79
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,789
HAVE BEEN BEATEN BACK.

80
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,658
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL

81
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,359
SEASON, THE DEMOCRATS COME OUT

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,729
WITH A PRETTY GOOD GROUP.

83
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,501
THEY DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE.

84
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:49,604
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY RUN A

85
00:03:54,844 --> 00:04:04,853
>> THEY RUN IT FACED ON FULL

86
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:06,354
EMPLOYMENT AND 4% GROWTH.

87
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,757
>> BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

88
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,325
UNABLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND

89
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:14,129
THIS WEEK WITH THE CRISIS AROSE,

90
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,897
OVER WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE

91
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,766
BORDER, THE CONGRESSIONAL

92
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:18,666
REPUBLICANS FROZE AND THE

93
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,337
PRESIDENT HAD TO DO AN EXECUTIVE

94
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,523
ORDER

95
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,776
>> WHAT WAS THE DEMOCRATIC

96
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:28,143
SOLUTION?

97
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:31,312
TO OPEN THE BORDERS AND ANGER

98
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,415
THE MOB TO KEEP PREVENT PEOPLE

99
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:38,520
FROM THINKING.

100
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:42,724
HOPE TO GOD WHATEVER VIOLENCE

101
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:46,661
SPRINGS WITH AN ANGRY MOB WAITS

102
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,763
UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.

103
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,366
THEY WANT TO KEEP IN THE MOB

104
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,272
I DON'T THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE.

105
00:04:57,273 --> 00:05:00,108
>> THIS IS A DYNAMIC YOUNG

106
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:01,309
PERSON WHO OVERTHREW SOMEONE WHO

107
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,478
WAS IN THE DISTRICT A LONG TIME.

108
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,380
LOST A BIT OF TOUCH.

109
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,582
THIS IS TRAFFIC NEW YORK

110
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:07,949
POLITICS.

111
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,420
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF

112
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:15,290
CONGRESSWOMAN SHE WILL BE.

113
00:05:15,291 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Shannon: MARK WROTE AN
