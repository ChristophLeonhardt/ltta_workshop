IN THE AFTERMATH OF BILL COSBY'S GUILTY VERDICT, CAMILLE COSBY HAS TAKEN TO FACEBOOK TO RELEASE AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S CONVICTION, COMPARING IT TO EMMETT TILL'S DEATH. IN A POST ON COSBY'S FACEBOOK PAGE, SHE WROTE A LONG PIECE THAT STARTED WITH THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION AND THEN GOING INTO EMMETT TILL AND THEN GOING IN SAID JURY BY MEDIA. I WANT TO REVIEW A FEW SNIPPETS. SHE SAYS: I DO WANT TO CONTINUE GOING ON THROUGH SOME OF HER STATEMENT, BUT I WANT TO STOP HERE AND TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WHERE WE ARE SEEING THE MEDIA TURN. ON THEIR BELOVED CHARACTER. BILL COSBY IS AMERICA'S DAD OR WAS. AND OFTEN TIMES, THAT WILL LEAD THE MEDIA AND THE JURY TO BE BIASED IN THEIR FAVOR, BUT NOW WITH THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AFTER THE MISTRIAL HE IS BEING SEEN IN A DIFFERENT BY AND I DO THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE AND NOT BE PUTTING DOWN. I THINK CAMILLE HAS LOST HER MIND. I THINK SHE HEARD THE LYRICS TO STAND BY YOUR MAN AND THEY DIDN'T HEAR THE PART WHERE IT WAS LIKE, UNITL HE DRUGS AND RAPES 60 WOMEN. I THINK THAT IS THE PART OF THE SONG THAT SHE MISSED. IT IS I AM FASCINATED, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD BY CAMILLE COSBY AND PEOPLE LIKE THIS BECAUSE ONLY THING I CONTINUE TO COME BACK TO IS THAT SHE BELIEVED THAT? DOES SHE BELIEVE WHAT SHE IS SAYING OR IS THERE A PAYOUT? AS THEIR FEAR, BRAINWASHING, STOCKHOLM SYNDROME OR DOES SHE BELIEVE IT? I DO NOT KNOW IT WILL EVER KNOW BUT I KEEP COMING BACK TO THAT DIET IS SO FASCINATING TO. I THINK SHE BELIEVES IT BUT I THINK SHE BELIEVES IT BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN WITH HIM FOR SO LONG AND GOTTEN HERSELF TO BELIEVE IT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE HER WHOLE LIFE WAS ALIVE, THE ENTIRE TIME THEY WERE MARRIED HE WAS DRUGGING AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING 58 WOMEN. IT IS HARD TO LIVE WITH THAT UNLESS YOU THINK, NO, HE IS NOT GUILTY, IT IS ALL A LIE BUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THAT, ROW QUICK ON HER SAYING, TAKING AWAY HIS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HE HAS EVERY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT IN THE WORLD THAT HE COULD SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS, HE IS A CELEBRITY. IN ANOTHER PART THAT SHE SAID THE MEDIA IS ESTABLISHING BARRICADES PREVENTING THE TRUTH, VIOLATIONS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. NO, THERE IS NO VIOLATION. THE MEDIA DOESN'T DO THAT, THE GOVERNMENT WHAT SO YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG ON THE CONCEPT. 2ND OF ALL, YOU JUST SAID THIS. THEY DIDN'T PREVENT YOU FROM SAYING IT'S NOT BILL COSBY CAN SAY ANYTHING WHAT HE WANTS. YOU ARE TOTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT THAT IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY WHAT IS GOING ON. SHE ALSO SAID HE WAS CONVICTED BY PUBLIC OPINION AND NO, HE ADMITTED TO BUYING DRUGS TO GET WOMEN TO SLEEP WITH HIM. HE SAID TO SLEEP WITH HIM BUT ACTUALLY BUYING DRUGS TO INCAPACITATE THEM TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT THEM AND THAT IS NOT THE CONVICTED IN THE JURY OF PUBLIC OPINION, THAT IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL TO. A 22-YEAR-OLD JUROR HAS NO IDEA WHO HE IS AND SO FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE. HE WAS LITERALLY CONVICTED BY AN ACTUAL JURY. LET'S CONTINUE ON. SHE SAYS: THIS IS SUCH A DISGRACE TO EMMETT TILL'S LEGACY, EVEN HIS FAMILY HAS SAID DO NOT ASSOCIATE HIS DEATH WITH WHAT IS GOING ON WITH COSBY'S CONVICTION AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE WAS THEY SAID, THEY ADMITTED TO HAVING DONE ESSENTIALLY AND THE JURY STILL FOUND THEM NOT GUILTY, BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. EMMETT SO DOES NOT HAVE A VOICE IN THIS. THE CITY WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD ABOUT THIS AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND EVEN THE JURY SAID IN THIS SECULAR CASE THAT IT WAS COSBY'S OWN COMMENTS THAT MADE THEIR DECISION. THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE. SO UNBELIEVABLY OFFENSIVE. EMMETT TILL WAS A 14-YEAR-OLD KID WHO WHISTLED AT A WHITE WOMAN, MAY BECOME A LEADER EVEN KNOW IF THAT WAS TRUE AND THEN WAS BEATEN TO DEATH FOR WHISTLING ALLEGEDLY AT A WHITE WOMAN. BILL COSBY IS NOWHERE NEAR DEATH, NOT BECAUSE OF THE JURY BUT ALSO, HE ADMITTED TO DRUGGING WOMEN SO THAT HE COULD SEXUALLY ASSAULT THEM AND THEN 68 WOMEN HAVE BACKED UP THIS ACCOUNT, SO. IT IS SO OFFENSIVE TO EMMETT TILL. ANY FAMILY OF A WRONGFULLY CONVICTED PERSON SHOULD BE OUTRAGED BY THIS. THE NET IS VERY WIDE. SHE IS BASICALLY CREATING THIS FALSE EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN EMMETT TILL'S DEATH WHICH WAS THIS EGREGIOUS ACT, TORTUROUS ACT OF VIOLENCE AND THEN SHE TRIES TO CREATE THIS FALSE EQUIVALENCY BY SAYING IN THE CASE OF BILL COSBY: SHE IS COMPARING HIS MURDER COSBY NOT BEING ABLE TO DO STANDUP. CAMILLE, GOOGLE IMAGE LYNCHINGS AND THEN SHUT YOUR STUPID MOUTH BECAUSE THIS IS SO OFFENSIVE. IT IS A REAL THING THAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS DAY. ERIC GARNER WAS LANCE SOMEWHAT ARGUE BY THE NYPD. THERE WERE TWO BLACK MEN WHO WERE JUST LYNCHED IN OKLAHOMA RECENTLY. BILL COSBY IS NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. BILL COSBY IS NOT BEING LYNCHED OKAY. I HAVE DONE LONG EXPLANATIONS OF WHAT LYNCHING WAS BACK IN THE DAY, YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. IT IS THE MOST GRUESOME THING YOU WILL EVER HEAR. IT IS NOTHING, YOU LOST A STANDUP ROUTINE. BILL COSBY AND HIS WIFE ARE DOING THE CLARENCE THOMAS STRATEGY. TO BE FAIR TO BILL COSBY, HE HAS DONE SOME WONDERFUL THINGS FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WELL BEFORE THIS NEWS CAME OUT WERE ALSO ANNOYED AT HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD GO AROUND YELLING AT KIDS PULL YOUR PANTS UP, IT IS ALL THE PERSONAL RESPONSE ABILITY, KIND OF SAYING IT IS YOUR FAULT. THAT WAS AT LEAST WAS HOW IT WAS PERCEIVED SO NOW, INSTEAD OF TAKING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PULLING HIS PANTS UP, HE GOES AND TALKS ABOUT LYNCHINGS OR HE GETS HIS WIFE TO DO IT WHICH IS WHAT CLARENCE THOMAS DID. THERE IS NO RACISM AND THAT IS WHY HE IS NOMINATED BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS OF THE SUPREME COURT AND THEN WHEN HE IS ACCUSED, HIGH-TECH LYNCHING. DON'T DO THAT. IT IS INCREDIBLY DISRESPECTFUL TO THE MEMORIES OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER THROUGH THAT. HE IS OF ADVANCED AGE AND HIS LEGACY IS TARNISHED AND NEVER COMING BACK YOU WOULD THINK IF YOU WANTED TO BALANCE THE LEDGER IN ANY WAY WHEN YOU ARE OF THIS ADVANCED AGE, YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN TO CLEAR ALL OF THIS WRONG AND NOT DOUBLE DOWN WHEN YOU ARE AN OCTOGENARIAN. THIS IS HOW YOU WERE GOING TO BE REMEMBERED BY GIVING A DEPOSITION SAYING THAT YOU DRUGGED WOMEN, BEING CONVICTED NOW SAYING THAT THIS IS AN OUTRAGE, REMEMBER LYNCHING? IT'S WORSE THAN IT COULD'VE EVER BEEN. ONE MORE POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE WHICH FRUSTRATED ME, SHE TALKS ABOUT SINCE WHEN ARE ALL ACCUSERS TRUTHFUL? THAT IS SO DEMEANING TO ALL WOMEN THAT COME FORWARD AND HAVE THE COURAGE AND BRAVERY TO COME FORWARD. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT FALSE ACCUSATIONS, IT IS SUCH A SMALL PERCENTAGE. THEY ESTIMATE ABOUT 2% MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN COME FORWARD ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR RAPE SO THE FACT THAT SHE IS QUESTIONING WOMEN'S TRUTH. 58 WOMEN, THAT OF COME FORWARD THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BETTER VICTIMS THERE MIGHT BE, IT IS SO UNBELIEVABLY IRRESPONSIBLE AS A WOMAN AND SO DAMNING TO HALF OF OUR COUNTRY.
