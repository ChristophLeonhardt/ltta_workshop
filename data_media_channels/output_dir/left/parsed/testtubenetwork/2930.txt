presonus I'm so punchy and tired now
then get the usually in the raw I like
it okay I like it all right so we
represent a YouTube show yes for daily
why do you usually see your daily
Oh sometime you make something seem kind
of exclusive and secret everyone else
ok so you
you have all of these things you have
cilenia Liz really value so feel like
they're your personal value this room
i'm a very very open to things like
meditation is London Christian but I try
to talk about me like
well but reality is I'm very I think
that we should be celebrating cultures
and I believe that religion especially
first tentative ability for God's
creations whether they are Buddhist
hi Jane
but I appreciate your kind words it's
not about your question looks like my
question I guess is just like that
speaks a lot for Millennials so you like
you are speaking to
party of popularity with your social
media present so I i love the millennial
generation you hold them on issues with
a Republican or Democrat
good
stuck in some of the thinking
I think ways of staff
about differences and about divisions
and so I think Millennials
of reckless sharing
I'm inspired by that generation so it
reflects a lot of my body and swipe
secrets it's a natural connection I
think how this would make real estate
when they don't operate in an authentic
space and so I just try to be the best
version of myself as possible
a form inspire me as a
yeah and i think this lake
part of the
president
you daughters beforehand are you just
kind of European yourself people respond
to you know look there was a really
inspired person exert awesome challenge
me
before i got i should said only go on to
this error here if you're going to
your authentic self she was I know you
your spirit is she sensed it this is a
natural step of you
and she was right and he getting him
also competed supercharged my life
ways especially of American cities I'm
very mission driven and I found social
those connections could really
strengthen my city in fact I loved it by
the time i was getting crazy tweeting
it like I was a better manager of my
city because some people realized hey I
can actually respond to me right now
people will drive along and they would
take pictures of potholes and tweet it
needs a fix this and I would now find
out about potholes or my road crews
traffic lights out before my traffic
engineers water main breaks before
my water department it just
really is a demonstration that when you
are connected buildings connections to
move at a speed that is far greater than
you
yeah for sure so today's seems par tup
how do you feel
the middle one like don't be losing the
Rings things I just in traditional media
and I cut these questions well it all is
brewing and the Bernie Sanders people
around this and I cannot be kidding me
the convention that just ended 22 by
Senate Republican colleagues wouldn't
even go it was boycotted and here we
have one where Jeff Merkley in my
college senator important
doors for him most
next week you guys Elizabeth Warren say
because she was sneaking me
it was poorly put all of us were there
and I love about it is during our
primary nobody was talking about the
size of your hands nobody was sort of
insulting and it's me compassion there
was a contest
free or more vulnerable how are we going
to heal this ridiculously read this
disparity in income in our country and
those contests ideas actually resulted
in the final winner changing their
platform know which is amazing so we
have a big test that tonight everybody
was funded uh and and
fight against a party where doesn't
represent Republican are
because you see so many defections from
him and so I'm really proud that tonight
some people might want to say older is
booing hear this and say you're not
either but the reality is
and we actually are better cook as I my
favorite moment of the night
was that they wouldn't let Bernie
Sanders feet yeah I'm sitting actually
this is kind of a big moment for me this
is like the moment you want you kind of
dream about like you wanna make your mom
proud I'm sitting in the box my mom is
missing behind me I'm city next week
listen then I got John John Lewis is
sitting right theater the former
attorney General Eric Holder sit right
here I've got a congresswoman I'm like
surrounded the head of Planned
Parenthood is a row and I'm just
thinking looking around me I'm like okay
it's alleged to take a breath holy crap
I here and then Bernie Sanders comes up
to speak who just bought Bill Clinton's
wife and I'm like I'm not in awe i'm
sorry this is where i am kind of more
reporter hair like look at a house built
it back he's cheering yeah he is
cheering so basically that Bernie
Sanders unable to start this speech for
what seemed like a long time for me not
just because Bernie Sanders people
cheering but because Clinton people were
cheering Clinton family members were
cheering that was a beaut that was like
my favorite moment because it just
showed that we love that guy
it not just for a party of a national
conversation he moved America in my
opinion to be a more compassionate
country the time that you need to care
about people who are getting let every
equation so I'm proud I was proud of my
party crowd mic Senate colleague Bernie
Sanders I'm proud of my presidential
nominee Hillary Clinton and saying we
can get along
you might be people that little
frustrates the little side the scandal
is having with WikiLeaks people directly
little salty and run average it's always
going to be easy and comfortable but
we've got a mission and this mission for
me
against the guy I have a nice that was
here watching tonight she can't she came
very young still in grade school I don't
want my niece to listen to a president
over the next four years talk about
women such a beginning
my knees to see somebody that makes it
standard to tweet how vicious and mean
stuff on a regular basis I want somebody
the model and President Obama did
model principles and values so I'm proud
of my party tonight I'm lifted
I that's why even though it's late and I
probably have had no sleep I'm not going
to fall asleep what does like feeling
your soul yeah higher but you're still
wire again and you just can't fall
