>>> WELCOME BACK.
TALK ABOUT A BARBECUE AND BOOZE
BUMMER.
A NEW HEALTH WARNING THAT FINDS
OUT THAT NO AMOUNT OF BOOZE,
SAUSAGE OR BACON IS SAFE AT ALL.
JOINING US NOW TO WEIGH IN IS
DR. MIKE WITH MAYBE NOT SUCH
GOOD NEWS.
DR. MIKE, SAY IT AIN'T SO.
>> YOU WALKED INTO THE LION'S
DEN.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE ALL
OF THE BOOZE, WE HAVE THE BACON.
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS, YOU HAVE TO
CELEBRATE.
WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT POINT FROM
THE GET GO.
BUT IF YOU EAT THIS TYPE OF FOOD
FOR CELEBRATION PURPOSES OR
EVERY NOW AND THEN, THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS STUDY IS TALKING
ABOUT.
THIS STUDY IS TALKING ABOUT
EATING BACON EVERY DAY, 50 GRAMS
WORTH, FOUR STRIPS OF BACON AND
IT INCREASED THE RISK OF CANCER
15% TO 20%.
>> FOUR STRIPS OF BACON EVERY
DAY.
>> EVERY DAY.
>> SO THE HEADLINE OF NO AMOUNT
NOT REALLY.
>> THIS IS WHAT SCIENTISTS DO
AND THIS IS WHY THE CLINICAL
DOCTOR WHO ACTUALLY SEES
PATIENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS, I
DISAGREE WITH THE LOGIC THEY'RE
TAKING HERE.
THEY'RE SAYING THAT NO AMOUNT IS
SAFE.
YES, IF THE RISK SLIGHTLY GO UP
BY 0.1% THAT MAKES IT NOT SAFE.
WHAT I DECIDE TO SAY FOR ME OR
MY PATIENTS IS TOTALLY
DIFFERENT.
THAT'S AN OPINION CALL.
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS
MAKE IT SCIENTIFIC.
I'M LOOKING AT THE HUMAN ASPECT
OF THINGS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT.
>> THIS YEAR AN ESTIMATED OVER
1.7 MILLION NEW CASES OF CANCER
WILL BE DIAGNOSED IN THE U.S.
CAN YOU TIE THAT TO DIET?
I MEAN BREAK THIS DOWN.
>> WELL THERE WAS A STUDY DONE
NOT SO LONG AGO THAT SHOWED 42%
OF CANCER CASES ARE CAUSED BY
PREVENTABLE FACTORS AND THE
LEADING CAUSE OF THAT WAS
SMOKING, OVERDRINKING, INDOOR
TANNING BEDS AND BEING OBESE.
YES, MAYBE BACON SLIGHTLY
CONTRIBUTES TO THAT.
AND IF YOU THINK OF THE PEOPLE
WHO EAT HUGE AMOUNTS OF BACON,
THEY'RE NOT EATING HEALTHY FOOD.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
NO FRUITS AND VEGGIES.
THAT'S ME.
I HAVE THREE TO FOUR SLICES OF
BACON EVERY DAY.
I REALLY DO.
WHY NOT CELEBRATE TUESDAY.
TUESDAY MIGHT BE THE LAST
TUESDAY I HAVE.
IF YOU WORK OUT, MAYBE YOU CAN
EAT BACON.
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING
TRADEOFFS.
IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS
