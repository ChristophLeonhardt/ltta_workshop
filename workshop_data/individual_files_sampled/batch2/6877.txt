and short users you can now have TYT the palm of your hand our TYT app is available for download in the Google Play Store just go to TYT comm slash app to find out more the Daily Caller they have published problematic articles in the past and recently they decided to publish an article about us and Alexandria Acacio Cortez and how she won the primary in her district in New York now I'm amused by this article because everything that they state is bad is actually not bad at all but nonetheless there were a lot there was a lot of misinformation here so Kyle Parris ik is the person who wrote this I want to give you the relevant portions of his article he says new details have emerged revealing that George Soros helped prop up Democratic Socialist Alexandria Castillo cortezes political career in an attempt to put 400 Bernie Sanders likes politicians in Congress okay so wouldn't that be awesome yeah I don't so I don't even know where to start first of all Alexandria Ocasio Cortes awesome Bernie Sanders like politicians awesome like George Soros like all they have to do is mention George Soros and then all of a sudden this is all terrible George Soros did not prop up Alexandria across New York Cortez as far as I know that didn't happen no I know for a fact so one thing they could have done is contacted us to see if anything they were printing was false and they would have found out a lot of it was false another thing they could have done is actually do journalism but that's not what they do and so that's the problem with right wing blogs they fabricate stuff all the time who's behind Daily Caller again Tucker Carlson oh okay so it must be credible ah yeah nobody but look that's what drives me crazy about the mainstream media and Washington they like will talk of Carlson as a show on fox news so if he's running Daily Caller it must be credible no not so you should actually look to see if they print the truth or lies it's okay to have a conservative perspective this nothing wrong with that at all it's not okay to print things that aren't true and do it on a regular basis and not have any standards of reporting at all so okay so what's the reality so they talk in the article about how we The Young Turks helped Alexandria kasi air Cortes win yeah that's right guilty as charged that part is true and she has said on air here that we were a big part of her victory which I thank her for and she you know who else was a giant part of her victory her Alexander Consul Cortes did an amazing job sure he caught Chakravarti who was part of the just Democrats and who ran her campaign all the volunteers who worked on our campaign some of them whom our Young Turks viewers the people who did the small dollar donations that it takes a village so it was all those people now was George Soros involved not at all in fact just Democrats point is no corporate PAC money and we want to take money out of politics which would mean that George Soros couldn't influence politics at all it's the opposite of our mission so with the four hundred people that they're referring to and again all they had to do was ask but they're not interested in the truth so Alexandria on the show has talked about in other places the the groups that asked her to run or Justice Democrats and brand new Congress now brand new Congress was an idea originally that was supposed to be nonpartisan support both Democrats and Republicans that are good honest people and overthrow the corrupt system in Congress now what wound up and the idea was to get four hundred people in the office Republicans and Democrats okay now most of that staff actually wound up deciding that that was not the best way to go some state and that still I believe exists okay but most folks went to justice Democrats that are only for progressive Democrats so can we get four hundred people into Congress I hope one day that seems fairly ambitious okay but no the idea was we're gonna run dozens of candidates who are and the one litmus test is uncorrupted you cannot take corporate PAC money and did we find candidates like Alexandria crosshair Cortes yes and when you say that that part is true now let's turn to finally disor so what in the world about sores what is he to do with anything yeah yeah can I read you some more of what he wrote specifically about Soros so okay so in an interview with progressive digital media outlet The Young Turks a member of a Soros funded network of far-left publications called the media consortium so the argument here is that TYT happens to be part of the media consortium that is funded by the Soros buy by Soros and that these digital media outlets have supported Alexandria Castillo Cortes which means George Soros is propping up Alexandria Acacio Cortez what and by the way I okay you address it go ahead okay so are we part of the media consortium yes okay I don't want to say no because I don't ever want to empower these guys and like I don't want to associate myself with them etc I wish that it worked better I wish that progressives work together better and the media consortium was a really good effort to do that but in reality it hasn't done much and not for lack of good intent is a bunch of excellent progressives who cared to do the right thing where do they get their funding from I have no idea I've never asked them you know why we've never gotten a nickel from the media consortium in fact we paid dues into the media consortium maybe I'm paying Soros so we pay we never got a nickel out of the media consortium that was never the point the point was hey progresses worrying the other which I love we call Young Turks Houma progressives yeah I wish the media consortium was bigger and stronger and that we worked better together but we never got any money out of it and and they never promised any money to certainly not to us right and people paid dues into it to support it if Soros was funding it at some extravagant way why would we have to pay dues into it exactly so look I want to be clear about one other thing like they make it seem as though getting funding from George Soros is a bad thing based on nonsensical conspiracy theories and smears geared toward Soros right so getting funding from George Soros in my opinion is not a bad thing they make it seem like a bad thing because they've defamed the guy left and right but you know for the purposes of this article it is misinformation and we haven't received funding from him and I personally would not be opposed to receiving funding from him just keeping it real okay so and sometimes we say that jokingly and then they run with it they actually then they write artists Young Turks looking for funding from George know so finally the the thing with these guys is that it's one big circle of one line feeding into another line so they quote well they're like oh well the media Research Center which is a conservative nonsensical it's not it's not some bipartisan fact-based organization that is right-wing yeah so they're like uh-huh we found a list of pretty progressive somewhere on the Internet they're all getting funded by source by the way other facts are wrong they say the entire consortium has 300 million people who read it or view it every month we alone have 200 million so I imagine actually where as a consortium if that consortium actually existed and we actually did anything with it look I personally have not heard of anything that the media consortium has done in a couple of years right but I wish they would and they're great people so anyway I my guess is that it's if you combine all those people it's way past 300 million but there's no secret agenda and and I wish Soros responding great progressive stuff and part of the anti source stuff is anti-semitic conspiracy theories and so I will always defend Soros from that garbage but the reality is the Soros family does fund some progressive groups who I think with good intent fight against some things that unfortunately have the consequence of keeping money in politics so I am NOT for those progressive groups and I am NOT for that effort and people ask me all the time another group I started was wolf wolf dash pack.com tell everybody about it it's to get money out of politics and they will ask and it's non partisan they'll say oh yeah you want to give Soros money out of politics the answer is absolutely I don't want Bloomberg or Soros or Koch brothers or Karl Rove or any of these guys Sheldon Adelson it doesn't matter who they are I also don't want multi national corporations to come in or foreign powers to come in to influence our elections you know who should influence our elections the American citizens it's not that complicated supposed to be a democracy but so we fight against that and and what they do here is smears and they do it on purpose so for God's sake the rest of the media stop taking right wing blogs like The Daily Caller seriously they're not serious they're not reporters all they are is propaganda it's not just because they have a perspective that's totally fine it's that they do things that are not true
