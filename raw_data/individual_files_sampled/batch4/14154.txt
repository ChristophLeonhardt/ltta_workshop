Mayor Sadiq Khan's approval ratings have slipped to a new low so after a summer of carnage in London by the way a summer of carnage that was predicted by surgeon Martin Griffiths which I reported on back at the time mayor said he comes approval ratings I've just carried on plummeting in London who would have thought it so I polled by you go for Queen Mary University asked Londoners what they thought about the job citycam was doing and well it's not good his approval ratings are now lower than ever after a hundred people have already fallen victim to murder in the city knife crimes out of control so is gun crime and working-class communities have been severely hit by gang violence and voters over the age of 50 have given Sadiq Khan a negative rating that's as well as white voters generally and the working classes London's working class don't like a mayor who's allowed their communities to turn into war zones hmm funny that isn't it who would have thought it his support from the working-class communities of London has gone from plus 5 to minus 7 throughout the summer that's a huge change and the poll also found that 44% of voters believe he's doing well that's down 8 points since April 20 18 knows who think he's doing a bad job have increased by 10 points since April putting the figure at almost 40% that's a lot of people professor Phillip kauri of Queen Mary University explained in April 2018 Sadiq Khan was still ahead among those aged 50 to 64 working-class Londoners those living in outer London and white voters he's now behind among all these groups when we first started polling he was one of the most popular politicians in Britain such was his cross-party support he even had net positive support from conservative voters those days are long gone looks like the days of charming London's voters are over Mayor Sadiq Khan's approval ratings are lower than ever with the working-class white voters and over 50s all rejecting the politician despite in times gone by him being able to win over support from the Tories and generally being a charming schmoozer in London and when he go for voters from all sides in fact he got the the biggest mandate of any single politician in British history those days are well over now because with a negative rating from these three voting groups it's clear that his multicultural charm is beginning to wear off but do I think it means he's going to lose in the next election no so here's the thing and I'm not sure a Tory mayor will actually ever win London ever again even after a summer of total carnage of a hundred plus murders of stabbings and shootings galore and gang violence out of control and the police not being given the resources they need even after with all that I mean London's changed it's a new place and this is what happens when you transform a city and then tell them to vote for the people that transformed it in the promise of more transformation if you change the population of a city change the culture of a city then the way they vote is going to change forever unless you reverse that that's not going to change anytime soon is it so I don't think the Tories are ever gonna win ever again meaning Sadiq Khan could well win by default next time around that's assuming he's the candidate again unless the polls get worse and worse and worse than it looks like he might not win maybe labour would change their mind then maybe they're gonna ask him and put it in a korbinite candidate although hmm hey maybe Sadiq Khan already is anti-semitic enough Corbin so I guess we'll see what happens with that one but Khan could personally have a hand in my opinion personally have a hand in criminal activity going on in London I'm not saying he does but if he did if he did I still think he could win and I don't think he'd win because he's got huge huge huge levels of support it's not just that because it is true still even a majority still think he's doing a good job it's a smaller majority but it's a majority non though s but when you combine that with the that the Tories are so hated and in a city with the changed demographics such different demographics they're never gonna vote for the quote-unquote nasty party that doesn't like immigrants which is what the Tories are always blamed as as being it's not true honestly it looks like London's not going to change anytime soon and despite these approval ratings showing Siddiq becoming less and less popular I think the changing demographics have sealed the deal for labour to control this city pretty much forever catch up with all the rebel stories on our brand new app which you can download now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
