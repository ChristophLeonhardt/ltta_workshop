what I provide reading it in the

36
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">original form if you're going into</font>

41
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,250
hollow city has much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same format</font>

42
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,720
of the first but beautiful end papers

43
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,189
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're out you'll find</font>

44
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,930
included amazing photographs now one of

45
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,250
my favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about the book is</font>

46
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the photograph often doesn't come</font>

47
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,610
until after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've read through that</font>

48
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,320
passage that the photograph kind of

49
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,450
describes or illuminates in a way I

50
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,100
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how intentional visitors I'm</font>

51
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,810
going to get very intentional but it

52
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,549
allows you mind to create the scene and

53
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,100
then it really enhances the scene it's a

54
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,840
weird process between text and image

55
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,310
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what i like about this</font>

56
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,140
series and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes it so creepy</font>

57
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">effectively creepy that play between</font>

58
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,009
text and image in that sense that

59
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,479
everything's trying to trick you as well

60
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,040
you can't quite you can't quite find

61
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,049
stability ransom<font color="#E5E5E5"> riggs writing style is</font>

62
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,579
very rich you do feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

63
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting a treat out of it the twister</font>

64

effective as well I can open spot twist

65
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,119

mainland Britain of our time a rather

dark<font color="#CCCCCC"> ear and blitz your time one might</font>

71
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,060
say but this book in the series as well

72
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,310
isn't just for anyone it's not just for

73
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,380
creepy fans it's not just for the fans

the books is still like the most awesome

95
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,450
person ever so writing so strong it has

96
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,190
that play and it exists as a book in its
