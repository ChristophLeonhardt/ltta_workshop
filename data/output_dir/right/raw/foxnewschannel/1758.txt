00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,114
TUCKER CARLSON IS UP NEXT.

WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON

TONIGHT.

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,860
IT'S A BIG WEEK.

8
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,762
THIS IS THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY

9
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:22,835
OF ROBERT MUELLER'S APPOINTMENT.

10
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:26,038
IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO

11
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:26,839
ASSESS HOW IT'S GOING.

12
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,540
THE INVESTIGATION IS COSTING

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,244
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, IT'S USING

14
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:33,546
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS

15
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:34,680
OF CABLE NEWS COMMENTARY.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,649
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN

17
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:37,383
BROUGHT TO A VIRTUAL STANDSTILL.

18
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,619
WE STILL AWAIT THE

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:41,854
INVESTIGATION, ITS CONCLUSIONS.

20
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:43,789
WHEN YOU'RE IN, WHAT DO WE KNOW

21
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,590
SO FAR?

22
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,791
CERTAINLY NOTHING WE WERE

23
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:46,392
PROMISED AT THE OUTSET.

24
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,394
STILL NO EVIDENCE OF ANY PLOT BY

25
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:49,862
THE TERM CAMPAIGN TO COLLUDE

26
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:51,330
WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO

27
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,032
HACK THE PRESIDENCY, TO BE

28
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:53,833
HILLARY CLINTON.

29
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,267
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIA

30
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:56,836
HAD ANY VOTE TOTALS FOR THAT

31
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:57,169
MATTER.

32
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:58,671
THERE STILL ISN'T ANY PROOF THAT

33
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,673
THEY ARE BEHIND THE HACKING OF

34
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:01,240
JOHN PODESTA'S EMAILS.

35
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,441
WE STILL HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN

36
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,242
EVIDENCE THEY HAD ANYTHING TO DO

37
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:05,678
WITH THE DNC HACKING.

38
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:07,646
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH

39
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:09,482
CRIMES, BUT ONLY FOR BEHAVIOR

40
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:11,050
TOTALLY UNCONNECTED TO HIS

41
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,351
CAMPAIGN OR BECAUSE THEY

42
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:13,419
ALLEGEDLY LIED TO MUELLER'S

43
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:13,953
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM.

44
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,754
IN THE CASE OF FORMER NATIONAL

45
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,556
SECURITY ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN,

46
00:01:17,556 --> 00:01:20,626
HE APPARENTLY WAS CHARGED WITH A

47
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:21,760
FELONY PERJURY CRIME EVEN THOUGH

48
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,230
HIS FBI INTERVIEWERS WE JUST

49
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,030
LEARNED DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS

50
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,466
LYING WHEN THEY SPOKE TO HIM.

51
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,167
SO IF YOU PEOPLE ARE HAVING

52
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,669
THEIR LIVES DESTROYED, BUT FOR

53
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:32,738
NOTHING THAT WE CAN SEE.

54
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:33,472
NO COLLUSION HAS BEEN FOUND OR

55
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:35,474
EVEN SUGGESTED.

56
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:36,141
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVEN'T

57
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:38,878
LEARNED ANYTHING.

58
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:39,845
WE LEARNED THAT WHEN RUSSIA DID

59
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,881
TRY TO INFLUENCE THE CAMPAIGN

60
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,616
THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT IT.

61
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:44,316
THEY SPENT A SMALL AMOUNT OF

62
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:46,252
MONEY ON ONLINE ANTS LIKE AT

63
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:48,654
THAT ALMOST NOBODY SAW.

64
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:49,555
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OUTCOME

65
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,056
OF THE RACE, THEY WEREN'T

66
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:51,524
COMPETITIVE.

67
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,392
THEY WEREN'T EVEN ALL ON TRUMP'S

68
00:01:53,392 --> 00:01:53,859
BEHALF.

69
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,394
SOMEWHERE AGAINST TRUMP INSTEAD

70
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,630
OF BACKING A SPECIFIC CANDIDATE,

71
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,831
THEIR GREATEST INTEREST SEEMS TO

72
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,832
HAVE BEEN SOWING CHAOS AND

73
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:07,039
DISUNITY IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM.

74
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,240
MORE THAN ANYTHING WE LEARN JUST

75
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,309
HOW CLUELESS THE PEOPLE WHO RUN

76
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,876
WASHINGTON, D.C., R.

77
00:02:10,876 --> 00:02:13,045
RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE FACT THAT

78
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:13,679
THEY CREATED DONALD TRUMP

79
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,114
THEMSELVES BY ABANDONING AND

80
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,115
THEN COMING TO DESPISE THE REST

81
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:18,450
OF THE COUNTRY THEY RUN, THEY

82
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,619
COULDN'T FACE THAT SO THEY

83
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:21,854
CONCOCTED THE RUSSIA COLLUSION

84
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:22,788
STORY AS A WAY TO SUSTAIN A

85
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,057
WORLD WHERE THEY DID NOTHING

86
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,892
WRONG AND THEY ONLY LOST BECAUSE

87
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:27,860
THEIR ENEMIES BETRAYED THIS

88
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,894
COUNTRY TO A FOREIGN POWER.

89
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,062
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, RUSSIA WAS

90
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:33,132
ALL THEY COULD TALK ABOUT

91
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:34,099
BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T

92
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,968
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES

93
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,369
THAT GOT TRUMP ELECTED IN THE

94
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:38,470
FIRST PLACE.

95
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,573
DRUG ODs, A VANISHING MIDDLE

96
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,240
CLASS.

97
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,874
THEIR AGENDA OF WITTILY

98
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,442
REPLACING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

99
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:44,276
THIS COUNTRY WITH IMMIGRANTS.

100
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,245
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

101
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:46,545
THAT.

102
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:49,048
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN WORKING FOR

103
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,215
MOST OF HIS PRESIDENCY DEMOCRATS

104
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,083
HAVE LOOKED FORWARD TO

105
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,152
THE BIG MIDTERM WINDS THAT WILL

106
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,386
GIVE THEM CONTROL OF CONGRESS

107
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:54,787
ONCE AGAIN.

108
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:56,221
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF ALL OF

109
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,057
THIS, BUT IT HASN'T WORKED.

110
00:02:58,057 --> 00:02:59,291
THEIR LEAD IS DWINDLING.

111
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,793
IT'S NOW IN THE MARGIN OF ERROR.

112
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:01,860
THEY MAY NOT WIN BACK THE HOUSE

113
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,461
AT ALL.

114
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:03,295
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SENATE WAS

115
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,531
GOING TO BE BEYOND THEIR REACH.

116
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:05,798
WHY?

117
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:08,033
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS RECOGNIZED

118
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,234
THAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS

119
00:03:09,234 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT WHAT THEY SAID IT WAS.
