good sleeping in on the weekends actually be really bad for you well according to one study that has yet to be peer reviewed by a medical journal they are saying it is possible a preliminary new study found that every hour sleep was shifted per week was associated with an 11% increase risk of heart disease these findings were presented this week at the annual meeting of the Associated Professional sleep societies which is what I just called my bedroom a joint venture between the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the sleep Research Society again it hasn't been peer reviewed yet and the authors are just basically using their findings to indicate what could be more set in stone at a later date but let's talk about it to study the effects of altered weakened sleep patterns researchers looked at survey responses from approximately 1,000 adults ages 22 to 60 to determine participants average amount of social jetlag they subtracted weekday from weekend sleep midpoints if a person reported sleeping from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on weeknights midpoint 3:00 a.m. and from 1:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. on weekends midpoint 5:00 a.m. for example that's a two-hour difference the researchers found that every hour of social jetlag was independently associated with a 22 percent increased likelihood of self-reported good health as opposed to excellent health and a 28% increased likelihood of fair / poor health each era of weekend sleep shifting was also associated with an 11% increased risk of heart disease as well as higher scores of fatigue sleepiness and depression screening questionnaires so first let me get a reaction from you guys do you think that sleeping in is going to kill you I have a hard time believing the study at all okay cuz like you mentioned it it is yet to be peer-reviewed right it said this is associated where there's no clear consensus on whether it causes it or not and sleep studies along with food studies are very hard to do because there's so many factors that go into this long length of time that you're studying you don't know what this person's life is or their stress level or their anxiety or their job or their diet or so many different factors that could change whatever risk for heart disease or other factors may be think that that's an important thing to point out is that with studies like this it is so subjective to each individual person I'm skeptical if they can make up a broader assumption that's why you do a survey with a thousand people is to try to get rid of some of that natural variability but I so cynical when it comes to studies anytime a new scientific study says that you should you know punch yourself in the face and then you'll have more friends like that it was not a real setting at all but I'm so what kind of friends at the end of the day I would only buy this I think if they had surveyed maybe ten thousand adults I really only believed why think really broad I just think also self-reported surveys are also another factor to look into but it's just I mean there's something to be said about presenting science in a journalistic way because so often this will be taken at face value and be read to be the truth and it's just like well what about these other studies what about peer reviewing it it's it's a fair thing to say that said a research assistant at the University of Arizona where who was involved in the study Sierra Forbush said just simply this suggests that a regular sleep schedule may be an effective relatively simple and inexpensive preventive treatment for heart disease as well as many other health problems that I can get on board sure I think I think Hollywood is actually you know whatever you're feeling exhausted you're coming down to something get a good night's sleep it does help your health yeah Arianna Huffington can get behind that I think that their basic idea in the article not in the headline the article that if you're sleeping the same amount but you shifted all over the place overtime back to be bad your health that's not a stretch I don't think but it's the way that people are pitching it as sleeping in on the weekends might be bad for you but but what they describe here is not the issue it's not that people are just going to sleep later on Friday and Saturday nights and getting the same amount of sleep I have a feeling a lot of those people are also sleeping more and they're saying they're controlling for to make sure they're sleeping the same amount but that's not reality reality is I might go to sleep at 1 instead of 11 but I probably also super 10 hours which probably gets rid of a lot of the negative health effects it may not be sustainable may not be great for you but I'm not sure that what they're describing is really how the headlines these articles are pitching it also doesn't control for you know reasons while this video title might pitch it okay I don't make the title yeah yeah I don't we don't do that don't complain to us we have no control over that it also doesn't control for things like maybe you getting realtor on the weekends and then that might affect your night's sleep because I know this guy does yeah I don't I don't have to fake mushrooms and I go why I go wild Young Turks membership creates independent media believe me no ads believe me all the show believe me on demand believe me support
