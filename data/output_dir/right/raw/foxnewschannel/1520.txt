00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:03,688
TEAM FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:05,590
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL FLY

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,660
REAL WELL WITH THE FAN BASE

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,127
THAT'S ME.

00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:17,802
HOW ABOUT DEMOCRATS?

12
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:20,138
>> A BRIGHT SPOT FOR DEMOCRATS

13
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:22,474
WHEN IT COMES TO SENATE

14
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:22,841
HOPEFULS.

00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:50,402
REPUBLICAN PART.

27
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:55,240
DEMOCRATS DON'T SEE MUCH OF AN

28
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,607
ADVANTAGE.

29
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:56,641
CONGRESSMAN WHO LEADS IT SAYS

30
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,443

00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:09,087
GRASSROOTS.

00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:12,190
WE WANT TO HOLD THEM FOR AN

35
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,824
UNPOPULAR AGENDA.
