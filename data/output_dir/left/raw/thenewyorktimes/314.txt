be the best in the world.

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,300
Not just winning slaloms or one
event, but being able to win,

9

in every event."

"You have slalom skiers that
are specializing in slalom.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,360
And to be competitive with them,
you need a lot of training.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,990
Then GS, the same thing.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,159
There’s a lot of GS specialists.

15
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,700
And then downhill
and super-G, that’s

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,489
a whole other set of girls
that are obviously exceptional.

17
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,870
Racing all five
disciplines, there’s

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,335
very few people that have
actually been able to do it."

"When I ski, I feel some kind of
a rhythm with every course.

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,930
Slalom is much faster
tempo between turns.

22
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,250
So it’s kind of like a
really upbeat sort of a song,

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,450
like today’s hits, you know."

enough, downhill, it’s

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,350
almost like some sort
of classical symphony.

27
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,090
So that’s been an
interesting transition."

giant slalom and slalom,

I barely had enough time
for training as it was.

34
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,060
Now, adding two more events,
I have basically twice

35
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,950
as much training
that I need to do

36
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,950

If you catch an edge,

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,410
you’re in the fences,
on the side of the hill.

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,460
And normally crashing that fast,
you’re going to get injured".

was that I wanted to
