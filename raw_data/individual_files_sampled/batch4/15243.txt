this new law does not ban foreign funding of Canadian elections it tells foreigners exactly how to do it to be legal so the new law bans foreign third party expenditures but but get how it defines what a third party is let me read this it's a bit long but you'll see why I'm reading it why it's so tricky so lawyerly why this thing is three hundred and fifty two impenetrable pages long so this is a definition of a foreign third party okay in subsection one a foreign third party is a third party in respect of which if the party is an individual the individual is one not a Canadian citizen two is not a permanent resident as defined in Subsection two one on the immigration refugee and three does not reside in Canada okay so right away a foreigner who resides in Canada he can campaign with his money against the Conservatives yet to be a citizen or a permanent resident or just a resident he's got an apartment here let me let me keep going B if the third party is a corporation or entity one it does not carry on business in Canada or it's only activity carried on in Canada during a pre-election period insist of doing anything to influence electors during that period to vote for or refer to vote or refrain from voting or to vote or refrain from voting for a particular candidate a registered party at the following election and it was incorporated formed or otherwise organized outside Canada okay so let me just explain that so a foreign company M campaign in Canada just as long as it takes one of those boxes just as long as it does something in Canada other than electioneering has a lemonade stand for one afternoon or does literally any other thing in addition to campaigning even just once then it's allowed all that's banned is a company that only comes to Canada to only campaign well there's your room now so literally do one other thing come spend ten bucks doing something else and then stay and spend a million dollars supporting Trudeau and attacking pipelines this isn't a band do you see what I mean the certain bands these are instructions to foreign funders on how to get around the bands this is Trudeau inviting in the big money one more example this is from a definition as well if the third party is a group then it's banned only if no person who is responsible for the group is one a Canadian citizen to a permanent resident as defined in Subsection 2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or three resides in Canada so again this is the rule of banned foreign third party so if you're a group all you need is just one token Canadian or even just one permanent resident or literally just someone with an apartment here a college student I don't know if a foreign exchange student so yeah this this this is not a ban on foreign meddling it's an instruction manual on foreign meddling this is a blank check for the colonization of Canadian politics by foreign entities by Trudeau's friends David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel and John Podesta and Jim called me all of those every environmentalist group they're all welcome all of Gerald but says old friends he used to be the boss of the World Wildlife Fund he's a lot of American environmentalist friends it's a 350 two-page bill I haven't read it all carefully but I know this it's an attack on democracy it will allow thousands of ineligible people to vote it'll allow Canada's election to be bought legally by George Soros or any other for who wants to dabble in our country use us as a plaything that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate I'll just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
