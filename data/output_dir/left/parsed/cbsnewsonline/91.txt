THE JURY. 
HE SAID THAT IS BECAUSE HE HAS 
RECEIVED THREATS AND CRITICISM 
AS A RESULT OF THIS CASE AND HE 
DOES NOT WANT TO SCARE ANYONE 
ELSE FROM SERVING ON A FUTURE 
JURY. 
WE WILL NOT GET THOSE NAMES. 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT 
THE MEDIA WILL APPEAL. 
WE DO NOT HAVE A VERDICT, THERE 
IS A LOT GOING ON. 
>>WE FORGET HOW HIGH-LEVEL THE 
SECURITY RISK CAN BE FOR SOME 
OF THESE TRIALS. 
IF THE TRIAL DOES STRETCH INTO 
NEXT WEEK IS THAT BAD NEWS FOR 
THE PROSECUTION? 
>> SO FAR I THINK IT IS IN THE 
REASONABLE TRY -- TIMEFRAME FOR 
A JURY OF 12 PEOPLE TO COME UP 
WITH A CONCLUSION ON 18 
DIFFERENT COUNTS. 
THERE IS LIKELY DEBATE IN THE 
JURY ROOM ABOUT REASONABLE 
DOUBT. 
WHAT THAT MEANS. 
IT APPEARS THAT THERE HAS TO BE 
SOME SORT OF DISCORD ABOUT 
WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT 
MET ITS BURDEN IN THIS CASE. 
THAT WILL TAKE UP MORE TIME. 
THEY ALSO HAVE HAD QUESTIONS 
ABOUT TECHNICAL TERMS USED IN 
THE CASE. 
THAT IS A SIGNAL THAT THEY ARE 
BEING METHODICAL AND VERY 
DELIBERATE. 
THAT WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME. 
THESE ARE VERY COMPLICATED 
CHARGES. 
HE IS CHARGED WITH FILING FALSE 
TAX RETURNS, FAILING TO FILE 
REPORTS OF A BANK ACCOUNT. 
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE, 
THERE IS A LOT OF PHYSICAL 
DOCUMENTS, THERE IS A LOT OF 
TESTIMONY, IT IS GOING TO TAKE 
TIME TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS. 
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO 
WEIGHEDIN ON THIS TRIAL. 
I WANT TO PLAY SOME OF HIS 
SOUNDBITE. 
>>I THINK THE WHOLE MANAFORT 
TRIAL IS VERY SAD WHEN YOU LOOK 
AT WHAT IS GOING ON. 
I THINK IT IS A SAD DAY FOR OUR 
COUNTRY. 
HE WORKED FOR ME FOR A VERY 
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
HE HAPPENS TO BE A VERY GOOD 
PERSON. I THINK IT IS VERY SAD 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO PAUL 
MANAFORT. 
>>THE PRESIDENT IS VERY 
PASSIONATE. 
WE KNOW THAT MANAFORT IS 
BANKING ON A PRESIDENTIAL 
PARDON. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
>> THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO SINCE 
MANAFORT WAS INDICTED. 
FIRST HE HAS TRIED TO DISTANCE 
HIMSELF SAYING HE ONLY WORKED 
FOR ME FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
FIVE MONTHS IS NOT EXTENDED BUT 
IT IS A CRUCIAL AMOUNT OF TIME. 
HE WANTS TO DISTANCE HIMSELF 
FROM MANAFORT AND MAKE SURE 
THAT THIS CASE HAS NOTHING TO 
DO WITH HIM OR THE CAMPAIGN. 
THE SECOND THING THE PRESIDENT 
IS TRYING TO DO IS PAINT 
MANAFORT AS A VICTIM. 
HE IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE 
POSSIBILITY IF HE HAS TO GRANT 
HIM A PARDON. 
HE WANTS TO FRAME MANAFORT IN 
THE SAME WAY HE HAS FRAMED JOE 
ARPAIO OR SCOOTER LIBBY OTHER 
PEOPLE HE HAS GRANTED --. 
HE WANTS MANAFORT TO BE ONE OF 
A PATTERN. 
I THINK SEEING THE PRESIDENT 
ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THIS WAY, 
DISTANCE AND THEN TRY TO INVOKE 
SYMPATHY FOR MANAFORT. 
>>INTERESTING. 
BREAKING NEWS FROM THE MANAFORT 
TRIAL THEY MAY NOT GET A 
VERDICT TODAY. 
THE JURY HAS REQUESTED TO LEAVE 
BY 5 PM. 
I CANNOT BLAME THEM THEY ARE 
ONLY A FEW SUMMER DAYS LEFT. 
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT TIME THEY 
WANT TO COME BACK ON MONDAY. 
THAT MAYGIVE US A CLUE. 
MAYBE THEY WILL ONLY HAVE A FEW 
HOURS LEFT, IF THEY'RE WILLING 
TO COME IN THE AFTERNOON THAT 
IS THE SIGN THAT THEY HAVE A 
LOT OF WORK. 
>>PAULA REID THANK YOU FOR 
JOINING US. 
>>> TOP FORMER INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICIALS ARE PUSHING BACK 
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP REVOKED 
THE SECURITY CLEARANCE OF 
FORMER CIA DIRECTOR JOHN 
BRENNAN. 
OR THAN A DOZEN FORMER U. S. 
OFFICIALS INCLUDING FORMER CIA 
DIRECTORS AND DEPUTY DIRECTORS 
SIGNED A LETTERIN
