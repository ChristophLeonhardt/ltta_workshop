1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,430
THIS
MORNING IT WAS REVEALED THAT

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,259
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN THE US
TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A BEATING

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,899
OVER THE NIGHT.

4
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,339
THE
LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF

5
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,131
ALLOWING FREE ACCESS OF THE

6
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:13,450
MEDIA TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS OF
OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WAS SHUT

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,840
DOWN.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:30,210
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE
SPECIAL PERMISSION LOOK LIKE.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:42,769
HER MOTHER, THEIR FATHER,
GRANDMOTHER ñ

10
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:43,829
THAT IS AN ISSUE.

11
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,250
YOU MIGHT
THINK I DON'T CARE IF THE MEDIA

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,250
GETS INTERVIEWS.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,379
THAT'S FINE,
BUT THIS WILL ALLOW SENATORS AND

14
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,060
CONGRESSPEOPLE TO EVADE ANY SORT
OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,060
DO.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,989
WE ALREADY KNOW THEY ARE NOT
DOING TOWN HALLS.SOMETIMES

17
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,540
AMBUSHING THEM IN A HALLWAY IS
THE ONLY WAY WE MAKE CLEAR WHAT

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,980
THEY STAND FOR AND WHAT THEY ARE
DOING AND MAKE SURE THERE IS

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,830
SOME SORT OF CULPABILITY FOR
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,830
IT GOT EVEN

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,920
DARKER DURING THE DAY.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,500
REPORTERS
WERE CALLING IN TO FIND OUT WHY

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,030
THEY WERE DOING THIS.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,030
LET'S LOOK

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:41,899
AT THIS TWEET.

26
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,930
THE WASHINGTON
POST HAD A REPORTER WHO WAS ALSO

27
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:52,759
HUNG UP ON.

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,689
THANKFULLY THERE WAS
IMMEDIATELY MASSIVE PUSHBACK

29
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:02,359
FROM A LOT OF POLITICIANS,
ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ON

30
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,290
THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,068
THANKFULLY
THEY HAVE DECIDED TO REVERSE

32
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:21,060
THAT 
RULES CHANGE.

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,390
SO THEY BOWED TO THE PRESSURE.

34
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,870
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DID.

35
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,110
I LIKE MAKING COMPARISONS
LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY

36
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,440
BEEN TURNED ON THEIR HEAD THAT
WE FORGOT TO THESE GUYS WORK

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,570
FOR.

38
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,090
IN A WAY WE ARE THEIR BOSS.

39
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,090
WE AT LEAST HAVE TO KNOW WHAT

40
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:56,349
THE HELL 
THEY ARE DOING.

41
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:11,690
IT IS 

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,690
JUST THE WAY IT

43
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,690
WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD.

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,349
YOU
CAN'T SAY NOBODY GETS TO MONITOR

45
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,459
WHAT I AM DOING AFTER YOU HIRED

46
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:24,750
ME.

47
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,050
EXACTLY.

48
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,860
THESE PEOPLE HAVE
INCREDIBLE POWER TO INFLUENCE

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,220
OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,750
THE
IDEA THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,599
REDUCE TRANSPARENCY ñ WE HAVE
BEEN CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP

52
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,800
HATES THE MEDIA AND WANTS TO DO
WHAT HE CAN TO CHANGE LIBEL

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
LAWS.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,270
BUT THIS WAS SENATE
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO MAKE THIS

55
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,270
CHANGE.

56
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,500
THINK ABOUT THE BIG
VOTES THEY WILL TAKE IN THE NEAR

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
FUTURE WHEN THEY VOTE ON TRUMP

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:04,220
CARE AND STEEL HEALTH INSURANCE
FROM AMERICANS.

59
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,390
THEY DO NOT WANT

60
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:17,990
A CAMERA IN THEIR FACE AFTER

61
00:04:17,990 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY CUT TAXES FOR CORPORATE
AMERICA.
