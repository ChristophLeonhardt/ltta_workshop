1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
hey everyone hope all is well there is

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely something that significantly</font>

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,470
changed about me the past few years but

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,730
it's something I've never really

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,750
addressed to camera like this which is I

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,609
have become increasingly serious in the

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">way that I conduct myself and in the</font>

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,340
things that I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about on my videos</font>

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,080
and I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people out</font>

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,269
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are like our miles i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> missed</font>

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,890
the good old days<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you were a lot</font>

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,790
more random ah free-spirited will you

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">get tell by the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use now what come</font>

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,160
a worm has been no time to talk but the

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,070
truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we all change and if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,260
at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first video I ever made on</font>

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube and compare it to now or just</font>

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,860
watch the videos over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years you see</font>

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,050
there has been progression and a lot of

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,120
it comes down to experience and

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,210
education I've been very lucky because

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,300
in my videos some people wonder why i'm

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,449
so into talking about myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what i</font>

24
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,700
do and it's because i have gained so

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,760
much positivity from being a part of the

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
youtube community and making these

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,430
videos and by expressing the success

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,189
that I have and the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wish to</font>

29
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,770
achieve I hope it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will encourage other</font>

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,290
people to emulate the same things and I

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">think in many cases it has worked but if</font>

32
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,420
we're talking about me being serious

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,350
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the fact that it's a very</font>

34
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,470
serious world and I think there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,280
much comedy and funny stuff on the web

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,170
you don't need me to do that I like

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,329
posing questions that spark discussion

38
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,829
and conversation because there is so

39
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,079
much wrong in the world that needs

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,009
addressing and I guess the fundamental

41
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,990
reason is because of the positivity I

42
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,299
have received from having this approach

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,479
and every time I am out and about

44
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,729
whether I'm meeting strangers friends

45
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,179
family I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will test the airwaves of</font>

46
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,239
conversation and I will try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and bring up</font>

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,650
the issues that

48
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,599
I think matter I will say to them what

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,909
matters to you and they baby wanting to

50
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,209
talk about the sport or you know comedic

51
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,000
things going on but I do bring it down

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,010
to a level of seriousness because nine

53
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,420
times out of ten at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,730
conversation I see it in their eyes

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,280
their eyes open<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as I've mentioned</font>

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,500
before I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had people kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of burst</font>

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,989
into tears which I sometimes feel bad

58
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,239
about but it's for a good reason they go

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,939
I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there were people</font>

60
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,459
that thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things this much and</font>

61
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,799
they no longer felt alone and the reason

62
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,650
I am so serious now is because I feel so

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,560
alive the more you educate yourself and

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,170
the more aware you are about the world

65
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,760
around you you know the more conscious

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,819
you are the more alive you are and I

67
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,260
guess I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the metaphor of like</font>

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,909
being on a life-support machine being in

69
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,250
a coma I think there are so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

70
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the world like that today and people</font>

71
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">are slowly waking up but they can't do</font>

72
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">it on their own if they haven't been</font>

73
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,489
shown the means of being able to

74
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,319
question and think for themselves you

75
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,870
know to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decent teacher is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not about</font>

76
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,840
telling people what to think but telling

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,150
people how to think but just because I'm

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,430
primarily serious doesn't mean I don't

79
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,069
also have a light-hearted side I mean

80
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,079
yeah perhaps I need to show that

81
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,299
light-hearted side more in my tweets

82
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,019
Facebook updates and<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube videos um</font>

83
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,540

104
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,639
zoomed in the camera should be when

105
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,470
doing my videos so perhaps you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help</font>

106

108
