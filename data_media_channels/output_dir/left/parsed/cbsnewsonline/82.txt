>> THE LIFE ALONE CAN SAVE THE 
WORLD FROM ITS BONDAGE TO SIN, 
SELFISHNESS, GREED, AND 
INDIFFERENCE. 
TO THE NEEDS OF THE LESS 
FORTUNATE. 
THAT IS THE LIFE WE HAVE COME 
TO KNOW IN CHRIST JESUS. 
IT BECAME INCARNATE IN OUR 
WORLD THROUGH A FAMILY AND 
THROUGH THE WITNESS OF 
CHRISTIAN FAMILIES IN EVERY AGE.
IT HAS THE POWER TO BREAK DOWN 
EVERY BARRIER IN ORDER TO 
RECONCILE THE WORLD TO GOD AND 
MAKE US WHAT WE WERE ALWAYS 
MEANT TO BE. 
A SINGLE HUMAN FAMILY DWELLING 
TOGETHER IN JUSTICE, HOLINESS, 
AND PEACE. 
THE TASK OF BEARING WITNESS TO 
THIS GOOD NEWS IS NOT EASY. 
YET THE CHALLENGES THAT 
CHRISTIANS FACE TODAY ARE 
THEY WERE DUE TO A HUMBLING 
CONNECTION TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. 
IT WAS THERE DAILY WITNESS OF 
FIDELITY TO CHRIST AND TO EACH 
OTHER THAT WON HEARTS YEARNING 
FOR A WORD OF GRACE AND HELPED 
GIVE BIRTH TO THE CULTURE OF 
EUROPE. 
THAT WITNESS REMAINS A 
PERENNIAL SOURCE OF SPIRITUAL 
AND MISSIONARY RENEWAL FOR 
GOD'S HOLY AND FAITHFUL PEOPLE. 
OF COURSE, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE 
PEOPLE WHO RESIST THE GOOD NEWS 
AND MURMUR AND IT IS HARD WORDS.
YET LIKE THE SAINT AND 
COMPANIONS WHO FACED ICY WATERS 
AND STORMY SEAS TO FOLLOW JESUS,
MAY WE NEVER BE SWAYED OR 
DISCOURAGED BY THE ICY STARE OF 
INDIFFERENCE OR THE STORMY 
WINDS OF HOSTILITY. 
BUT LET US ALSO HUMBLY 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF WE ARE 
HONEST WITH OURSELVES, WE CAN 
AS WELL FIND THE TEACHINGS OF 
JESUS HARD. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS 
ALWAYS TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO 
HURT US. 
HOW CHALLENGING ALWAYS TO 
WELCOME THE MIGRANT AND THE 
STRANGER. 
HOW PAINFUL TO JOYFULLY BEAR 
DISAPPOINTMENT, REJECTION, OR 
BETRAYAL. 
HOW INCONVENIENT TO PROTECT THE 
RIGHTS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE, 
THE UNBORN, OR THE ELDERLY WHO 
SEEM TO IMPINGE UPON OUR OWN 
SENSE OF FREEDOM. 
YET IT IS PRECISELY AT THOSE 
TIMES THAT THE LORD ASKS US, 
WHAT ABOUT YOU? 
DO YOU WANT TO GO AWAY AS WELL? 
WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE SPEAR 
TO ENCOURAGE US AND WITH THE 
LORD ALWAYS AT OUR SIDE, WE CAN 
ANSWER, WE BELIEVE. 
WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE HOLY 
ONE OF GOD. 
WITH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, WE 
CAN REPEAT, WE TOO WILL SERVE 
THE LORD, FOR HE IS OUR GOD. 
THROUGH THE SACRAMENTS OF 
BAPTISM AND CONFIRMATION, EACH 
CHRISTIAN IS SENT FORTH TO BE A 
MISSIONARY, A MISSIONARY 
DISCIPLE. THE CHURCH, AS A 
WHOLE IS CALLED TO GO FORTH TO 
BRING THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE 
TO ALL THE PERIPHERIES OF OUR 
WORLD. 
MAY OUR CELEBRATION TODAY 
CONFIRM EACH OF YOU, PARENTS 
AND GRANDPARENTS, CHILDREN AND 
YOUNG PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN, 
RELIGIOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS, 
CONTEMPLATIVE'S AND 
MISSIONARIES, DEACONS AND 
PRIESTS, AND BISHOPS, TO SHARE 
THE JOY OF THE GOSPEL. 
MAYHEW SHARE THE GOSPEL OF THE 
FAMILY -- MAY YOU SHARE THE 
GOSPEL OF THE FAMILY FOR THE 
WORLD. 
AS WE NOW PREPARE TO TAKE UP 
AGAIN OUR OWN SEPARATE WAYS, 
LET US RENEW OUR FIDELITY TO 
THE LORD AND TO THE VOCATION HE 
HAS GIVEN TO EACH OF US. 
MAKING OUR OWN, THE PRAYER OF 
SAINT PATRICK. 
LET EACH OF US RISE. 
>> CHRIST WITH ME, CHRIST BE 
BEFORE ME, CHRIST BE BEHIND ME. 
 HERE WE HAVE THE 
POPE USING THE WORDS OF THE 
SAINT PATRICK. 
>> WITH THE JOY AND STRENGTH 
GIVEN BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, LET 
US SAY TO HIM WITH CONFIDENCE, 
LORD, TO WHOM SHALL WE GO? 
YOU HAVE THE WORDS OF ETERNAL 
LIFE. 
 
>> LET US TAKE A FEW MOMENTS IN 
SILENCE TO REFLECT. 
>> THAT WAS POPE FRANCIS AT 
SUNDAY MASS IN DUBLIN, IRELAND. 
THIS COMES AFTER THE POPE 
EXPRESSED SHAME FOR THE 
CHURCH'S SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDAL.

NAVY PILOT SHOT DOWN IN 1967 
OVER NORTH VIETNAM. 
AS A PRISONER OF WAR, HIS CAP 
TORS -- CAPTORS TORTURED HIM 
FOR 5 1/2 YEARS. 
WHEN THEY LEARNED HE WAS AN 
ADMIRAL SON THEY TRIED TO

OTHERS WERE FREED. 
IT WAS COURAGE THAT MARKED HIS 
LIFE, THROUGH TWO PRESIDENTIAL 
CAMPAIGNS AND DECADES IN THE 
SENATE, HE BECAME ONE OF THE

CROSS PARTY LINES.

McCAIN GOT OVER IT BY PLUNGING 
INTO HIS WORK IN THE SENATE 
WHERE HE CHAMPIONED CAUSES 
LARGE AND SMALL. 
SOMETIMES CAUSES HIS PARTY 
WANTED NO PART OF. 
IT WAS McCAIN WHO TOOK ON MANY

EVEN AGAINST OUR WORST ENEMIES. 
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM. 
IT'S ABOUT US. 
IT'S ABOUT US.

ENGAGE IN THESE KINDS OF 
VIOLATIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL 
BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS THAT WE 
GUARANTEED WHEN WE DECLARED OUR 
INDEPENDENCE.
