presumptive Republican nominee for humiliating president Donald Trump continues his out-of-control rampage of attacks and innuendos against Hillary Clinton the presumptive Democratic Papa P Melissa mis Maxima position that doesn't actually exist yet in Trump's latest outrage you referred to the 1993 death of Vince Foster as quote very fishy Foster was the deputy white House Counsel during the Clinton administration who committed suicide in a Virginia Park by shooting himself in the mouth the suicide spurred rumors that the Clintons had murdered Foster especially after Bill and Hillary's aides apparently removed documents from Foster's office after his death but Foster's death has been investigated repeatedly and ruled a suicide as has the death of Kathleen Willie's husband Edward who shot himself on the very same day mrs. Willie says Bill Clinton chased her around the Oval Office grabbing her private parts mrs. Willie's accusations were thoroughly denied by Clinton operatives as were charges that Hillary sold her influence as a senator in return for donations to the Clinton Foundation from Russian businessman Boris payoff who later committed suicide by throwing himself down a flight of stairs then beating himself to death with an aluminum baseball bat investigators have debunked those allegations as they have the charges that Clinton's suspicious private email server was broken into by a Romanian hacker who later did himself in by shooting himself six times in the back of the head that death was ruled a suicide as were the deaths of five people who witnessed the fatal attacks on the American compound in Benghazi an accused Clinton of lying about the attacks those witnesses tragically ended their own lives by locking themselves in a cellar and setting the house on fire while screaming help help please don't kill us mrs. Clinton laughed off questions about these deaths as she laughed off charges that she accepted payoffs in the form of her husband's speaking fees which mysteriously skyrocketed after she became Secretary of State these allegations were detailed in a book by a Hoover Institution journalist who later committed suicide by running very fast down a dark alley and then riddling himself with machine-gun bullets mrs. Clinton was absolved of all responsibility for the journalists death as she was absolved of charges that her private email server was wiped clean by a tech expert in New Jersey the expert later went home and left the suus note reading quote dear God I think someone is going to unquote and then killed himself by sticking his feet into a tub full of cement and hurling himself into the Atlantic Ocean about 135 miles offshore mrs. Clinton responded to Trump's outrageous charges by saying quote Donald Trump's attacks on me have become increasingly irresponsible and absurd and by the way I've noticed he's been looking a little depressed lately unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show don't start looking at stuff up I made up everything except the first two but I made them all up and it's not it's all it's just kidding around and but we'll get back though I'm gonna unpack that opening because it's unfair that stuff however today it's the world-famous mailbag day and you can participate by subscribing and sending your questions in it's free for the first thirty days and then I think me and Shapiro come to your house and take your furniture I think that's listen if you subscribe you can also watch all right so let's let's talk about this yesterday we were talking about how the left-wing media was shocked absolutely shocked that Donald Trump would dare to talk about Bill Clinton's infidelities and and Hillary Clinton's work in keeping those in fidelities quiet and threatening the women who brought charges against them their partnership basically in silencing these women who had been allegedly abused by Bill Clinton and they were maybe was just absolutely stunned that this could come up even though Hillary Clinton is running on the 90s economy and even saying that she's gonna put bill in charge of the economy so he can bring back the tech boom and Newt Gingrich's policies that make all those things happen and all the other things that she's against the welfare reform the crime reform all those things that she is against she's running against but she's saying gee things were great the last time somebody named Clinton was out there so Trump is quite legitimately you know attacking him and the left-wing media is shocked so now Trump is up the ante because he's brought back Vince Foster and Vince Foster as I say Depp why can't house counsel a depressive had clinical depression you didn't like the limelight he was in didn't like the scandals that kept hammering the Whitewater scandals travelgate scandals and finally went out into a park and blew his brains out and did leave a message a suicide note that was in pieces there is absolutely no evidence this has been investigated to death as it were and there's absolutely no evidence that they the Clintons had anything to do with his death there is some evidence that Hilary and Bill's aides walked into Foster's office after his death and under the noses of the FBI investigators walked off with some documents a lot of documents that had been missing showed up in typical Clintonian fashion two years later and of course there was nothing in them to incriminate anybody but that's so typical of the Clintons so that when they complained that there are conspiracy theories around them it's also because they're obviously corrupt so and so that those conspiracy theories grow up so now Trump has said he went to the Washington Post and this is what he said he said Trump and by the way just before I say that Catholic Kathleen Willie's husband also did kill himself and that had apparently nothing to do with the Clintons but if you go online and Google deaths connected to the Clintons there are these long long lists of people who knew Bill and Hillary who died and under mysterious circumstances many of them are untrustworthy there has never been any evidence that the Clintons were involved in any of them so yeah you know I have nothing to say about that but Trump that's doesn't stop from because if it's been in the National Enquirer Trump will talk about it so he told The Washington Post in an interview he thought Fisher's death was Foster's death was very fishy this is what he said quote he had intimate knowledge of what was going on Foster had intimate knowledge of what was going on he knew everything that was going on and then all of a sudden he committed suicide I don't bring Foster's death up because I don't know enough to really discuss it I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder I don't do that because I don't think it's fair that's good nice of him so here's Bill Clinton's response this is just a replay of the same old 92 playbook believe it or not I went through the same thing we're doing today heck some of those right-wingers were sending videos out accusing me of murder why would they accuse me of anything I was yeah there is a vast right-wing conspiracy that accused them of sleeping with Monica Lewinsky oops you know that's so mean you lie enough you know you lie enough and this stuff starts to stick but don't forget don't forget Donald Trump is the same guy who accused Ted Cruz's father of essentially killing JFK it's any stupid story that swims by and when he was when he was challenged on it was like hey he was in the National Enquirer that's a good paper yeah I saw it on a bathroom wall how could it be untrue you know sir so Trump is the same guy and I know it's much more fun when he's doing it to them than when he's doing it to our guys but he's still he's a terrible person he'll say anything you know however however I just want to point out that he is handling his post nomination his post presumptive nomination really really well his strategy has been very very good it's all working he's solidifying his support in the GOP much faster than the media thought he was going to do the thing with the judge selections even though it's all ridiculous he never saw those he never saw that list of judges on TV with Hannity and going yeah this and some guy I've heard of you know so but it's all been very clever and it's all working but the media is just reeling in shock that he would say any of this stuff we play this clip yesterday of Chris Cuomo I just want to play just a little bit of it today just one little piece of it where Cuomo is objecting to Trump's spokesman about Trump bringing up bills affairs listen to this if you are not a sexist what you usually say is I'm not a sexist here's all the things that prove that I'm not here all the beautiful things the beautiful women you don't turn around say actually you're the sixth you call me a sexist I call you sis this is Chris Cuomo Democrat hack explaining to Trump's operative how it's supposed to work we do the attacking we the left-wing media do the attacking you get on defense and real and then we move on to the next attack before you can even defend yourself it worked with Mitt Romney that's how we did it with Mitt Romney we accused him of bullying somebody in high school we accused him of abusing his dog we accused them of having on women and he kept saying no no I didn't do that you don't attack us what the hell's wrong with you we're the mainstream media you don't attack us so here's the New York Times saying the same thing as Donald Pham and you can tell how scared they are of this guy because this is all that's in the New York Times as Donald Trump pushes conspiracy theories says the New York Times is the headline right wing media gets its wish ever since talk radio cable news and the internet emerged in the 1990s as potent political forces on the right Republicans have used those media to attack their opponents through a now-familiar two-step political operatives would secretly place damaging information with friendly outlets like The Drudge Report and Fox News and with radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and then they would work to get the same information absorbed into the mainstream media candidates themselves would avoid being seen slinging mud if possible so as to avoid coming across as undignified or desperate yet by personally broaching topics like Bill Clinton's marital indiscretions and the conspiracy theories surrounding the suicide of Vince Foster a Clinton White House aide a Clinton White House aide Donald Trump is again defying the norms of presidential politics and fashioning his own outrageous style one that has little use for a middleman let alone usual ideas about dignity okay just to put this in context right this is the same newspaper that a week ago ran 20 pages of information proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that Donald Trump was a billionaire heterosexual which is shocking to the times on both you know counts that BAE he has a lot of money and B he sleeps with women that's what they proved and the women came out and said no we kind of like me you know it was fine he was nice we had a good time this blows up in the New York Times his face and now they're telling us you know how awful and they continue to run these pieces yesterday was David Brooks why does everybody hate Hillary it's cuz she works too hard she works too hard somebody you know I thought when I saw this that's like the interview where you go in the job interview and they say what's your biggest flaw and I'm too dedicated to the company I work too hard you know that's that's something they did it again today today they have another one this is an absolute gem from Thomas Edsel he says how could a candidate with as much baggage as Trump be neck and neck with one of the most admired best credentialed and most broadly experienced nominees in the history of the Democratic Party it's like these guys have not got a clue see when the when the times singles out the right-wing media they leave out the fact that they're the left-wing media they don't think they are they think you know I have heard this again and again I have seen New York Times editors going no no you know we're an urban newspaper so we're tolerant of gays and we have you know those values but we report the news utterly straight I mean these are the guys who blame george w bush for starting a hurricane that destroyed New Orleans I mean this is like you know do you remember that that was the turning point in the Bush administration that was when they had been throwing these phony scandals these non scandal scandals in the Nixon administration they had non-denial denials in the George W Bush administration they had non scandal scandals one after another after another but they never tagged him until they got all those things on with all those things on TV with people suffering in New Orleans and guys saying george w bush hates black people and all this stuff listen to this from National Review just remember that what that was like because I remember I was out of town I was in Hawaii when the hurricane hit New Orleans and I read the New York Times which at the time I would never have done and I thought wow this is like hate speech it's like the things they're saying about george w bush are hateful listen to this from National Review virtually all of the gripping stories from Katrina were untrue all of those stories about in Paula's Zahn's words bands of rapists going block to block not true tales of snipers firing on medevac helicopters bogus the yarns peddled on Oprah Winfrey by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and the New Orleans police chief that little babies were getting raped in the Superdome and that the bodies of the murdered were piling up completely false the stories about poor blacks dying and comparatively huge numbers because American society left them behind nah while most outlets limited themselves to taking Nagin's estimate of 10,000 dead at face value editor and publisher the watchdog of the media ran the headline mortuary director tells local paper 40,000 could be lost in the hurricane in all of Louisiana not just New Orleans the total dead from Katrina was roughly 15 Black's did not die disproportionately nor did the poor in fact it was the other way around in terms of blacks they were a little it was a little disproportionate non-blacks the only group truly singled out in terms of mortality was as always the elderly this barely captures how badly the press bungled Katrina coverage and yet an ubiquitous media chorus claims simultaneously that Katrina was Bush's worst hour and the press is best so when the New York Times talks about this pattern of right-wing politicians slipping news to The Drudge Report it's cuz the Drudge Report was the only person who will report the news they were the only guys who report Bill Clinton stooping Monica Lewinsky in our Oval Office that we pay for any other chief executive in America fired any other chief executive in America caught with a young girl like that in his office in the you know the Board of Directors tosses him out so you know that this is this is the thing you know they're so shocked because they don't realize that they have lied and lied and lied and lost their credibility with all of us so what's what's really interesting about this is just take a look at two clips from yesterday Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump now outside the Donald Trump rally right there's this riot going on essentially these guys are starting all kinds of trouble mostly Latinos with printed suspiciously printed signs that look that they've been made in a factory so there was not these were not guys writing on cardboard boxes these were this was an organized rally meanwhile at Milo yu-na police is talking at a college and people are storming you know anyone who's talking for Trump is getting stormed and by take a look at the two candidates take a look at Hillary first she's attacking trying to hit back at Trump kind of weekly but we're not talking about any ordinary anti-union anti worker Republican a lot of Republicans themselves say Donald Trump is a disaster waiting to happen to America what little we know of his economic policies would be running up our debt starting trade wars letting Wall Street run wild all of that could cause another crash and devastate working families and our country Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages fewer jobs more debt he could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies I mean ask yourself how can anybody lose money running a casino really so there's Hillary Clinton looking like grim death you know her voice is almost gone she's screeched she got this horrible screech she just he's reading straight off the teleprompter she looks like she's you know she's just her eyes doing back and forth Obama thing we need straight off the teleprompter and she's saying things these kind of wild attacks on Trump like yesterday she said oh you know he said something at one point in 2007 that it looks like the housing market is gonna crash and that wouldn't be such a bad thing for me because I can make a lot of money out of that and Trump said yeah that's what I do I'm a businessman I make money whether it's good times or bad times that's what a good businessman does and our country should be run like that also perfectly good point perfectly reasonable point but that's that's grim Hillary Clinton okay Trump this is hilarious look at Trump I've learned don't even joke a little bit you know don't even joke a little bit you know ed rendell okay the he was the mayor of Philadelphia he's a big big Hillary Clinton supporter okay think of this I was so angry when I heard him say this but ed rendell big big women love and I love women shout it out shout it out she said women love you I love women okay but ed rendell one of Hillary Clinton's biggest supporters said that half the women in the United States something to this effect half the women in the United States are ugly nobody even talks about it nobody talks about can you imagine if I made that statement it would be the electric chair and I don't believe that either by the way but he made that statement and I said oh he said you don't even hear about it you don't even hear about it I mean he was a big wheel and now he's big in the Hillary Clinton campaign and you don't even hear about it because there's a double standard if you're a Republican if you're a conservative it's a total double standard from the sleeves back there the sleeves but first of all look he's having a great time he's having fun I mean it looks like you're sitting there looking at it from maybe a Trump administration okay it would be fascist but at least be fun fascism at least we'd be laughing you know he said that sleaze back there he's talking about the press he's talking about the guys that every Republican for the last 50 years has been scared witless of they've been trembling in their boots you wonder why they didn't stand up to Obama it's the press he's a sleaze but he's pointing at them you know you can't help but love it and the and the proof that he's right the proof that he's right about the bias in the press is this who are both candidates not talking about who is the missing man the invisible man Barack Obama nobody is saying a word about him Trump's not running against him and Hillary's not running on him Hillary's talking about how much everybody's suffering you know but she never says a bad word about Obama today in The Wall Street Journal for the first time in the modern era young adults are more likely to live with their parents than with a spouse or partner according to a new study by Pew Research Center young men I mean you know these are college graduates are living at home because they don't have good jobs nobody has good jobs they keep quoting that stupid you know unemployment has dropped the 5% but this these are not the same jobs that disappeared this is a suffering economy any economy would have bounced back after the crash in 2008 but he has made sure that that's a terrible economy here's a piece in The Wall Street Journal by marco rubio about obamacare the the one piece of big legislation which by hook and by crook obama forced through the evidence keeps mounting rubio says six years after being signed into law obamacare is a costly and unsustainable disaster look at what has happened in the past month alone a federal court ruled that the obama administration violated the law by spending money on obama care subsidies without an appropriation from Congress they're just keeping the thing afloat by legally throwing our money at it in Florida fifteen health insurers are seeking an average increase in premiums of 17.7 percent in increase in premiums for 2017 the continued rating of Medicare Advantage Obama care was projected in 2012 to cut a hundred and fifty six billion from the program over a decade it hurts many seniors in my home state and nationwide the health loss sweeping mandates continue to target faith-based organizations like the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor on and on okay so here's a piece you know there was a novel by Ralph Ellison about a famous novel about the black man in America called Invisible Man Barack Obama is the Invisible Man he is the Invisible Man everybody loves him but everything he's done has gone bad I mean the guy has been a total incompetent and there's a piece in The Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago last week I think it was where he says how did how did he get away with this how did he get away with it and he says mr. Obama is able to avoid being a target the reason he's able to avoid being a target is that he is a deft manipulator of the media probably more skillful at it than any president ever he heads a savvy public relations machine that market hit markets him like a Hollywood celebrity a role he obligingly and successfully plays and so all you ever see of Obama is him with people admiring him him putting up a statue to women him blowing bubbles with children all the stuff that's boy you ever see them and that fact alone has sucked the credibility of the media until when you still as I said yesterday when you stand Donald Trump next to principals he looks like a monster when you stiffen him up next to the media he looks like a god it's like it's that simple and Trump knows it and he's playing it brilliantly the mailbag time for the mailbag you know we got a lot of questions this time about religion so I'm kind of gonna weevil a couple of them together here's one from John it says how do you and then connect when it comes to religion we just punch each other you know that's how their human been connect when it comes to religion since you're now a Christian and he practices Judaism what fundamental differences do to not agree on it says PS I love the show and it bought your two of your books from Amazon that's how you get it that's how you get in it's like this is like the Bill O'Reilly so you have to buy my books and then I answer your question look I obviously I can't speak for Ben you know religion is so different from the inside than it is from the outside that what usually when you're talking about another guy's religion you're talking garbage you know you two really don't know what he's going through obviously I was born and raised to Jew but I was born and raised not a secular Jew but a very it was a very weird story you can read all about it in my book I hope you will pre-order my book the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in in Christ and of course then you know he looks at that story as a sad story I look at as a happy story I found faith in Christ's salvation happiness joy in knowing Jesus but to been like I was lost to Judaism because of my upbringing because of the way I was raised what I can say about my faith because my faith is kind of eccentric even in Christianity is I don't believe Christianity is a religion I believe it's a relationship I believe everything that Christians do should be looked at as a visual aid and a memory aid essentially a sensory aid to getting to know Jesus Christ and the reason when I get to know Jesus Christ is he is all of God that we can know you know there is a God the Father who is incomprehensible and when you talk to that amorphous God that empty God that empty room I think you start to worship yourself I think that God takes on traits of your father types and traits if your mother takes on traits of you and pretty soon you're worshipping the world Jesus gives you a way to communicate through another human being with the divine and that relationship everything else is just built to to hone that relationship even the Bible in the Bible keeps you from making turning Jesus into yourself the Bible reminds you what he said who he was what he did and that's how you get to know him better there's nothing you can do to win God's salvation in Christianity you know there's not there's nothing to do there's no rules there's nothing you know there's not everybody who says don't do this don't do that that's fine I'm not and the traditions are important those traditions help you to get to know him but basically this is for me about a relationship with God and when I look back it's been I think it's been 12 years now since I was baptized when I look at those 12 years and how that relationship is progressed sometimes through church sometimes through Scripture often through prayer a lot of by reading you know you can't do it on your own because then you're just talking to yourself all those things that have developed that relationship when I look back what I find over those 12 years is that I am now more myself than I ever have been it's a bizarre bizarre thing all this garbage has fallen off me it's really amazing you know when you look there's a wonderful story in the Narnia book about a little one of the Narnia books about a little boy turns into a dragon and he keeps pulling trying to pull his dragon skin off so he can become a boy again but it just keeps growing back and finally as Lomb the Christ like lion just rips it off him and it's it's excruciating but he rips the scales off and he becomes a human being and that has been pretty much my experience that up until that moment I did everything I could I meditated I used therapy and all those things were really helpful but the skin kept growing back but something about knowing Christ is transformative and I'm not preaching to you I'm just telling you my experience and that is the relationship that Judaism doesn't contain it has all kinds of other ways of dealing with God you know the Jews are a chosen people a special people in their relationship with God God doesn't break his promises he doesn't say I'm gonna do this for you and then walk away Jesus has come that the deal is off I don't leave that at all I don't believe the notion that I write about this a lot in the great good thing this notion that the Jews killed Christ that's not even an English sentence to me you know that's like saying the whites held slaves it's like saying the blacks rioted in Los Angeles you know you know what some guy who didn't do it wasn't there who was on the other side coast you know right in Los Angeles cuz he was black it just doesn't make sense to me I do explain what I think that means in my book so anyway what I what I but is not included in Judaism obviously this is the the great dividing line is the character of Jesus Christ as being the Son of God and a representative of God and you know that's that's something that is not in Ben's religion but what is in Ben's religion I would have to leave it to him to say because only he can explain it to you in a proper way so that's my answer I don't just want to add that somebody else Audrey Gayle grace asked who is my favorite character in The Chronicles of Narnia and I wanted to add that in because I'm not a big fan of CS Lewis's fiction I loved his nonfiction I mean the weight of glory is one of my favorite books and that's saying something because I've read everything so every book ever written so that's that's saying a lot but you know I like the Narnia books but the one point when the Narnia books really come to life is whenever Aslan the law that Christ Li lion is on the scene because CS Lewis's description of his relationship to human beings is so exact and it actually does develop this theme of of a relationship of the relationship being everything alright that's what I had to say about religion I hope that made some kind of sense I'll go through a couple of quick ones I'm running out of time here's guy who this does sound like Bill O'Reilly but he says I just finished reading your homeland ER series and they were great and he's looking for more books for kids with good values this is from Jake I will say I will advertise that I have other books for kids that are the same a series called mind war a couple of books called crazy dangerous if we survive nightmare City but also take a look at older books you know look at 101 Dalmatians shame the Western if you have a boy I read that book five times when I was a boy it's a great great Western The Hunger Games is a good series you know it's not just a best-seller it's actually good in Harry Potter also a good series I noticed that you and Ben often used the same clips in your podcast is that on purpose asks Mary no it's not it's simply that there's not really that much news in any given day and you know we're just going to the same sources and that's basically the stuff that's there and some of it you know the guys are cutting the clips and if they already have the clip and Ben says I want to hear from that guy they throw in the same clip so it's not it's not my purpose I got stopped I didn't leave myself enough time welcome back there were some questions I'd like to come back to stuff I like that's the mailbag we'll do it again next Wednesday subscribe send your questions I will get as many of them as I can so this has been ancient Greeks and I'll come back and do the ancient Romans another time because they have a lot of stuff that is formative to but I just think these are things that I wanted to recommend I recommend that the pericles 'as funeral oration from Thucydides Plato's apology of Socrates and the reason I'm recommending these things is because they're easy reads they're good reads I'm not sending you like you know crazy stuff that'd be hard to read and they are what you are they think what you think because these books existed because people wrote these books and another one and this is just as entertaining as it gets there's a book of history the father of history he's called Herodotus he wrote what it is assumed to be kind of one of the earliest real histories and in Herodotus if you don't want to read them I love this book I read it a long time ago but I loved every page but it's like 800 pages long but if you don't want to read every page read book six and seven of the histories which includes the Battle of Marathon the famous battle where the Persians invaded they were way outnumbered the Greeks and the Greeks went out and fought them at marathon and there's a famous legend that's actually not in Herodotus it's misremembered from Herodotus it's in Plutarch that a guy went running from the battlefield of Marathon the 25 miles to Athens to announce the victory and that's how we get the marathon that's twenty four point something miles it's the distance from Marathon to Athens the next chapter involves the story of Lion itis at the Battle of Thermopylae the three hundred who stand up against the next Persian invasion and stand in this little pass the pacifier and we're all remember from the movie 300 let's take a quick look at the scene this is where we hold them this is where we fight this is where they die they sealed boys remember this day it will be yours for all time Spartans they done your work Moe long lobby come and take the Molen lobby you know have you heard the word laconic you know the word laconic like Gary Cooper John Wayne would be laconic they're guys who don't speak much but what they say is really choice that comes from the area Laconia which was the area that Spartan was in and they had a way of speaking it was very tense Mullen lobby come and get him pal you know that's this stuff is formative because it talks a lot about why freemen why a small band of freemen can beat a bigger band of slaves and that's really really important all right tomorrow if there's not too much news other news I want to talk a little bit about Hollywood and some of the terrible things that are going there and have a friend of mine on who is a Christian critic I hope we'll get to interview him it should be interesting because there's a lot of really nasty stuff coming on and Hollywood it's been but that's affecting our minds I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show it's been lovely talking to you let's do it again tomorrow
