I often ask the press to hold people accountable especially if they're on their air and I think MSNBC host Chris Jansing did that in this case she had representative Francis Rooney on he's a Republican of Florida and she asked him about their health care proposal now I'm gonna give numbers at the end of these clips that she couldn't have had access to on the spot there I hope that they do a follow-up segment like this but I want to show you what the congressman said and then what the reality is let's watch you don't have any concerns about premiums going up I think if we can bring choice selection and competition back into the non group policy market through this tax credits and that premiums will go down and deductibles will go down you say you think it will but what is the confidence level because there is a slew of analyses and you know that they're out there that suggests the exact opposite of what you're saying and in fact those who would be hurt the most are those who would in fact be those who have the most difficulty the poor the elderly the people most in need if the CBO score comes out on this Senate bill and suggest the same thing that's a CBO score on the House bill show which is that millions of Americans would lose their health care under this bill you still would support it absolutely I would remember that the voodoo economics of the CBO score was faulty the first time around and the Wall Street Journal covered that very well you know it assumes that nobody will buy insurance unless they're mandated to buy a statist system like Obama care does it give any credit for behavioral modification and incentive through the tax credits oh yeah yeah it turns out of course the CBO score came out for the Senate bill and 22 million people are gonna lose their insurance it's like how we're gonna give them incentive through tax cuts now wait a minute they don't have that much money to get tax in the first place and you're cutting Medicaid by eight hundred billion dollars and so if they were relying on Medicaid to get the health insurance in the first place they can't buy it they don't have enough money and almost all of your tax cuts are going to the very top here I'll give you some numbers on that right now actually says I give tax incentives who did you give it to the top 1% top one percent under Trump care would be a tax break of $45,000 per year yes they'll have plenty of incentive to buy any insurance they like but you think that's a big number tax rates for the top point one percent under Trump care is 250 thousand dollars a year so if you're in the top point one percent congratulations Donald Trump and all of the Republicans just gave you a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year gift on average so don't tell me about tax incentives and how they're gonna help people buy insurance those folks already had insurance almost all the tax cuts go to the very very rich but it's okay because Jansing is actually gonna ask about that androoni has what I view to be a hilarious answer now it's a very standard answer for the Republicans but I'll show you why it is in fact comical here let's watch let me cite the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities which says this is basically a program that a bill that makes sure that the wealthy get tax cuts that's okay with you as people are losing their coverage see I happen to think the tax cuts on it to stimulate investments which is what this tax cut is it's Obama putting a tax on investments cutting those taxes are very important to stimulating stimulate investments of job creation I mean sometimes these people don't seem to understand how capitalism works when you instead advise investment people deploy capital create jobs milk companies and put more people to work so they can afford all these things that don't have to be on Medicaid oh I love that condensation said capitalism works again you give all the money to the rich and then it trickles down on you maybe I have a different idea why don't we just let people have the money in the first place and then they don't have to wait for the rich to have it decide that they're gonna allow it to trickle down on the middle class okay so now I have the facts on my side let me show you these are the same exact arguments that the Republicans used under george w bush they so we need massive massive tax cuts for the rich and so they got it and their tax cuts put a two point one trillion dollar hole in a deficit under george w bush from 2001 and those tax cuts continued until 2010 under obama when obama changed the tax regulations so in that 10-year period those tax cuts the great majority going to the rich and the corporation's two point one trillion dollars well the economy must have boom because he just told you you don't say that all right we gave it to the rich we give trillions of dollars the rich and then you guys get a lot of jobs so obviously unemployment we went way down under bush right well let's take a look here's the chart of unemployment wait a minute it goes skyrocketing up at the end of Bush's term so after eight years we didn't have unemployment going down we had unemployment going up way up actually if you continue that chart is continue to go up during the Great Recession into Obama's first term and then Obama turns it around we well you're gonna say well Jake it was a giant financial crash at the end of 2007-2008 yeah exactly so the rich got all the money and what do they do they gambled with the bank's gambled with it they took crazy risks they crashed their economy hey so did it help the economy to create more jobs no it didn't it never does by the way I'll tell you why it doesn't and I'll show you a couple more facts because if for example you do an Earned Income Tax Credit which goes to the middle class with a little working poor they act so they work they get a tax credit ok well that's an interesting concept that's different than tax cuts for the rich they immediately spend the money or if you get Medicare or Medicaid you need it you immediately spend it on health care you you know you there's you help with food stamps for the working poor they immediately spend the money you know why because they need it so it circulates the money they need food they need books for their kids etc they need clothes so they immediately put it back into the economy and the money circulates and so that wins it's it's the exact opposite of trickle-down economics and it actually improves the economy greatly that's why at our height in 1950s and 1960s as our economy was booming and into the 1970s we had tax rates for the very top marginal rate this is not what they all paid this is what if you got passed like a million dollars ten million dollars depending on how you calculate inflation for any dollar above that amount you'd pay sometimes seventy sometimes up to ninety one percent in taxes but the economy boomed because then you build schools you build bridges and the money circulated when people got it in the in the middle class when the rich get it they put it into their bank account and sometimes they gamble with that accountant crash the economy but they don't recirculate it in the economy you can't take trillion dollars of tax cuts and buy that many yachts with it so more facts as of 2013 the Tax Policy Center found that under Obama the top 1% of earners paid an effective federal tax rate of roughly 32 percent compared to about 27 percent under Bush now I don't think that's nearly enough but clearly in that case Obama raised taxes he also did it through Obamacare there was a small increase in there and that's what Rooney's fighting against and they're saying no no no no we got to give back all that money to the rich so tax cuts tax increases will greatly damage the economy you won't be able to add jobs really so let's go to the facts on that well jobs created under george w bush there were some jobs created and then unemployment shot up and we lost a lot of jobs so after eight years we only created about a million jobs that's a miserable record miserable under barack obama eight years we created 15 million jobs so what happened to tax increases hurt the economy and cost your jobs and tax cuts are wonderful for the economy and create jobs it's just not true they keep repeating that as a talking point not because they care about the economy or getting you jobs it's because they work for those same rich donors who get those tax cuts they have no intention of having it trickle down on you except in terrible ways they have an intention of keeping the money that's why they bought people like rooney to make those nonsense talking point so now as they cut your healthcare and 22 million people won't have health care and so many more people will have it cost much more money especially if you're sick you have a pre-existing condition or you're elderly and you'll get less coverage for it and all that so that the rich can get more tax cuts and pretend that it'll at some later point help you you know what would help me now health insurance you just watch the video from the young
