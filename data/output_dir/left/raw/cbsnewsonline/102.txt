1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:03,736
POLICE DEPARTMENT, WORKING IN 

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:04,303
CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRE 

3
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:05,071
DEPARTMENT AND SHERIFF's OFFICE 

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,805
BEGAN THE EVACUATION OF 

5
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,640
APPROXIMATELY 150 FOLKS FROM 

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,176
THIS COMMUNITY. 

7
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,044
THE MAJORITY OF THOSE FOLKS 

8
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,312
WENT TO SHELTERS. 

9
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,515
WE THEN TRANSITIONED ALMOST 

10
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,350
IMMEDIATELY FROM THE EVACUATION 

11
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,087
MODE TO THE SECURITY MODE 

12
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,155
MAKING SURE THOSE AREAS THAT 

13
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,155
HAD BEEN EVACUATED ARE SECURE. 

14
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:26,392
IN ADDITION TO THAT I WOULD JUST

15
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,061
ADD THAT WHILE THINGS ARE 

16
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,295
PROGRESSING POSITIVELY AND WE 

17
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:33,133
ARE KEEPING OBVIOUSLY POSITIVE 

18
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,100
THOUGHTS IN MIND, IT IS VERY 

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,135
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ALL 

20
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,171
CLEAR HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN YET. 

21
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,274
WE ASK THAT FOLKS NOT RETURN TO 

22
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,042
THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN 

23
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,177
EVACUATED UNTIL -- ENGINEERING 

24
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,778
FOLKS TELL US IT IS OKAY TO 

25
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,981
RETURN. 

26
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,416
I ASK YOU BE A LITTLE BIT 

27
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,819
PATIENT AND MAKE SURE WE ARE 

28
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,852
NOT GOING BACK NOW BECAUSE IT 

29
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:54,721
IS NOT TIME. 

30
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,755
I WOULD ASK MEMBERS OF THE 

31
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:56,589
PUBLIC's TWO OTHER THINGS. 

32
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,725
ONE THING I UNDERSTAND THIS IS 

33
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,492
INTERESTING, A LOT OF PEOPLE 

34
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,095
WANT TO COME OUT AND VIDEOTAPE 

35
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,696
THIS AND MAYBE TAKE SELFIES. 

36
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,632
THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THAT. 

37
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:10,537
THAT DOES IS IT CAUSES US AS A 

38
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,771
POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PULL VITAL 

39
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,039
ASSETS FROM OTHER AREAS TO MAKE 

40
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,573
SURE YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF 

41
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:16,276
AND YOU ARE NOT IN A PLACE YOU 

42
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,011
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE. 

43
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,546
I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO DO THAT 

44
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:19,846
RIGHT NOW. 

45
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:20,513
SECOND THOSE BARRICADES YOU SEE 

46
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,614
UP THERE ARE MEANT FOR YOU NOT 

47
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,251
TO PASS THEM. 

48
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,753
PLEASE DO NOT JUST TAKE IT UPON 

49
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,687
YOURSELF TO MOVE THE BARRICADE 

50
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,454
AND GO AROUND IT. 

51
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:29,589
THE BARRICADE IS THERE FOR A 

52
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,090
REASON. 

53
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,692
I WOULD ASK YOU NOT TO DO THAT 

54
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,526
EITHER BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS 

55
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,561
VITAL STAFFING ISSUES WE ARE 

56
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,795
DEALING WITH AND WE NEED THOSE 

57
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,529
FOLKS WHERE WE NEED THEM. 

58
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,099
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT. 

59
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,301
WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN IT 

60
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,169
OVER TO JENNY HUNTINGTON HUMAN 

61
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,172
SERVICES. 

62
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,608
. 

63
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:48,875
>> HELLO. 

64
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,243
-- AGENCY HAD THE GREAT 

65
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,245
PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THE RED

00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,915
CROSS AS WELL AS LYNCHBURG CITY 

67
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:56,949
SCHOOLS TO OPEN AND OPERATE THE 

68
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,585
SHELTER LAST EVENING AT THE 

69
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,552
REQUEST OF THE EMERGENCY 

70
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,154
OPERATIONS GROUP. 

71
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,224
WE HOUSED ABOUT 98 FOLKS LAST 

72
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,992
NIGHT IN OUR SHELTER AND FED 

73
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,292
THEM BREAKFAST THIS MORNING. 

74
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,463
SOME OF THEM ARE ON THEIR WAY 

75
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,831
TODAY, OTHERS REMAIN AT THE 

76
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,099
SHELTER. 

77
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,969
WE HAVE ABOUT 90% OF THOSE 

78
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:22,208
FOLKS WHO ARE EVACUEES AND ONCE 

79
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,209
THE DAM IS SECURE AND PEOPLE 

80
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,310
WHO CAN RETURN TO THEIR HOMES 

81
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,578
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. 

82
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,747
ABOUT 10% OF OUR FOLKS WERE 

83
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:28,981
ACTUALLY DISPLACED BY THE FLOOD 

84
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,216
THERE. 

85
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,784
HOMES OR APARTMENTS ARE DAMAGED 

86
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,787
BY ONE WATERS AND REHOMING THEM 

87
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,823
WILL TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME. 

88
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,959
THE SHELTER WILL BE OPEN UNTIL 

89
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,294
THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED, AND WE 

90
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,195
WILL BE WORKING WITH THOSE 

91
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,429
FOLKS IN THE COMING DAYS TO 

92
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,566
HELP THEM DEVELOP A HOUSING 

93
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,266
PLAN FOR SAFE HOUSING OUTSIDE 

94
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:50,837
OF THE SHELTER. 

95
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,338
AS MENTIONED, THE SHELTER ALSO 

96
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,041
HAS A PET COMPONENT, AND THE 

97
00:02:55,041 --> 00:03:00,780
LYNCHBURG ANIMAL SHELTER HAS 

98
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,951
BEEN VERY HELPFUL ALLOWING 

99
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,818
PEOPLE TO BRING THEIR PETS 

100
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:06,786
BECAUSE IT DID INCREASE THEIR 

101
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,019
COVER. 

102
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,154
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 

103
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,757
SHELTER ARE ELDERLY OR DISABLED 

104
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,425
IN SOME WAY AND THOSE PETS ARE 

105
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,860
VERY COMFORTING TO THEM AS WELL 

106
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,027
AS THE CHILDREN THAT ARE THERE. 

107
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:15,995
SO THAT HAS BEEN VERY 

108
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,729
SUCCESSFUL. 

109
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,965
THE RED CROSS HAS BEEN 

110
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,668
INSTRUMENTAL PROVIDING STAFF TO 

111
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:21,901
HELP. 

112
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,138
THE PAPERWORK, THE ACTUAL 

113
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,906
EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS COTS AND 

114
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:33,413
BLANKETS, PROVIDING THE FOOD, 

115
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,881
EASY CLASS IS THE LOCATION OF 

116
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,514
THE SHELTER ON MEMORIAL AVENUE. 

117
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,749
WE ARE STILL ACCEPTING PEOPLE 

118
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:41,054
INTO THE SHELTER IF THEY NEED 

119
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,954
ASSISTANCE DUE TO BEING 

120
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:42,755
DISPLACED BY THE FLOODWATERS, 

121
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,591
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO AND 

122
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,293
TAKE AS LONG AS THE NEED IS 

123
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:47,526
THERE. 

124
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:50,730

SPUR OF THE MOMENT. 

134
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,555
I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF 

135
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,623
THE CITY TEAM, MANY OF WHICH 

136
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,825
YOU HAVE HEARD FROM, BUT MANY 

137
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,059
OF WHICH ARE SITTING BEHIND THE 

138
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,761
CAMERAS AND MANY OF WHICH ARE 

139
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,529
OUT IN THE FIELD DOING THE WORK 

140
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,064
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT 

141
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:25,565
NOW. I 

142
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,968

AS WE SPEND THE NEXT SEVERAL 

146
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,379
DAYS AND PERHAPS WEEKS WORKING 

147
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,279
TOWARD RESILIENCY FROM THIS 

148
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,414
EVENT. 

149
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,650
THAT INCLUDES THE FORMAL PART OF

150
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,018
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. 

151
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,188
WE NOW OPEN IT FOR QUESTIONS 

152
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,289
THAT I WILL MOST LIKELY DEFER 

153
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,792
TO THE APPROPRIATE STAFF. 

154
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,596
>> Reporter: MR. MITCHELL COULD 

155
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,633
YOU TELL US WHAT GOES INTO 

156
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,968
DETERMINING WHEN THE DAM IS 

157
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,201
STABLE? 

158
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,836
WHAT ARE THE FACTORS YOU LOOK 

159
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,470
AT? 

160
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,741
>> A NUMBER OF THINGS WE LOOK 

161
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:08,907
AT. 

162
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:09,876
ONE IS HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS 

163
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,210
ACTUALLY DONE TO THE DAM BY THE 

164
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,379
OVERTOPPING OF THE SPILLWAY. 

165
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,414
SECOND, AND MOST IMPORTANT 

166
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,015
THING WE LOOK FOR, IS ANY TYPE 

167
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:22,555
OF SEEPAGE THROUGH THE BASE OF 

168
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:22,821
THE DAM. 

169
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,890
IF THERE IS NO SEEPAGE THAT 

170
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,824
MEANS WATER IS STILL NOT 

171
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,691
PENETRATING THROUGH THE DAM SO 

172
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,026
AS LONG AS WATER IS NOT 

173
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:27,694
PENETRATING THROUGH THE DAM 

174
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,895
ITSELF, IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE 

175
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,362
STABLE. 

176
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:36,102
>> TALK OF OPENING A SLUICE 

177
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:36,669
GATE, IS A TRUE. 

178
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,606
>> THERE IS IT EMERGENCY 

179
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,441
SPILLWAY THAT IS CLOSE. 

180
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,642
WE HAVE TO EXCAVATE THE END OF 

181
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,847
THE SPILLWAY THAT GOT COVERED BY

182
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,515
DEBRIS WHEN THE DAM OVER TOP. 

183
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,450
THE TO EXCAVATE THAT PROBABLY 

184
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,317
TOMORROW MORNING AFTER THE 

185
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,252
STORMS PASS AND OPEN THAT GATE. 

186
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:53,953
THAT WILL ESSENTIALLY LOWER THE

00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,235
IT HAS BEEN A CONCERN AND WE 

212
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,770
HAVE PLANS IN THE WORKS TO

1980 BY THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS 

242
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,838
BUT DETERMINED THAT THE DAM 

243
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,807
SPILLWAY WAS INADEQUATE TO PASS 

244
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,743
A LARGE VOLUME OF WATER. 

245

THAT IS A RELATIVE TERM THOUGH, 

258
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,605
BECAUSE BY TODAY STANDARDS, 

259
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,641
DAMS HAVE TO BE DESIGNED TO 

260
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,176
PASS A PROBABLE MAXIMUM FLOOD. 

261
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:36,682

269
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,359
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. 

270
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,262
ONE IS TO FORTIFY THE DAM SO IF 

271
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:52,264
IT OVERTOPPED IT WOULD NOT 

272
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:56,102
ERODE AND BREACH AND FAIL. 

273
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,036
THAT IS ONE OPTION THAT HAS 

274
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:57,870
BEEN LOOKED UP. 

275
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,239
THE OTHER WOULD BE TO BASICALLY 

276
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,507
DRAIN THE LAKE, REMOVE THE DAM 

277
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,010
AND BUILD A BRIDGE OVER 

278
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,010
BLACKWATER CREEK. 

279
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,145
THOSE ARE TWO OPTIONS BEING 

280
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,079
CONSIDERED LONG-TERM.

MADE? 

284
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,655
>> THAT PROCESS IS CURRENTLY 

285
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,822
BEING HANDLED BY PUBLIC WORKS. 

286
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,592
THEIR ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. 

287
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,394
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE 

288
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,163
ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT? 

289
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,199
>> WE ARE STILL STUDYING THAT. 

290
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,633
WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER THE 

291
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:32,405
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WE FEEL 

292
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,008
EVENTUALLY POTENTIALLY LAKESIDE 

293
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:36,942
DRIVE COULD BECOME FOUR LANES 

294
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,077
IN THERE AND THERE MIGHT BE AN 

295
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,010
ADVANTAGE TO BUILDING A BRIDGE 

296
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,245

DAM. 

298
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,915
SO WE ARE STILL STUDYING THAT, 

299
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,683
DETERMINING WHAT OUR BEST 

300
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:49,055
OPTION IS FOR THE LONG TERM. 

301
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,992

305
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,331
AND WORK FURTHER INTO THIS 

306
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,299
PROBLEM, CERTAINLY THAT IS 

307
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,100
SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO TALK 

308
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,468
ABOUT AND FIGURE OUT WHERE DO 

309
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,503
WE GO FROM HERE LONG-TERM. 

310
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:04,903
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

TERM PROCESS, PARTNERSHIP WITH 

319
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,900
THE UNIVERSITY OF LYNCHBURG AND 

320
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,838
IT REQUIRES CAREFUL STUDY. 

321
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,339
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS 

322
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,607
AND WE HAVE BEEN MOVING TOWARD. 

323
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,777
RIGHT NOW WE ARE WORKING ON 

324
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,444
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES FOR THE 

325
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,380
CONSTRUCTION SO WE HAVE IN 

326
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,750
FORWARD VERY DELIBERATELY. 

327
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,052
CERTAINLY I HAVE NEVER EXPECTED 

328
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,954
THE DAM TO TOP. 

329
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,289
IN MY CAREER I HAVE SEEN 

330
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,124
OVERTOPPED A COUPLE OF TIMES 

331
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:58,758
AND IT HELD. 

332
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,194
THIS HAS BEEN AN UNFORTUNATE 

333
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,295
INCIDENT AND WE HAVE TO MOVE 

334
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,397
FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT WITH THE 

335
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:09,769
RIGHT SOLUTION IS. 

336
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,203
>> JUST ANOTHER POINT RELATED 

337
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:11,470
TO THAT. 

338
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,639
A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE STATE 

339
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,641
GENERAL ASSEMBLY PASSED 

340
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,241
LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED THE 

341
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:19,445
STATE TO REEVALUATE THE PROBABLE

342
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,747
MAXIMUM FLOOD AND PROBABLE 

343
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,317
MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION EVENTS. 

344
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,552

346
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,589
RENOVATED BASICALLY THE PROCESS 

347
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,025
WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR ABOUT A 

348
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,026
YEAR UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF 

349
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,628
THAT STUDY, TO SEE ULTIMATELY 

350
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,164
THE DAM HAD TO BE ABLE TO PASS. 

351
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,200
THAT WAS ANOTHER DELAY IN THE 

352
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,767
PROCESS. 

353
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,037
AS WERE WE -- AS WE WERE 

354
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,038
APPROACHING THE FINAL DECISION 

355
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,540
THE ISSUE CAME UP MOVING THE 

356
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,576
PROCESS FURTHER AS WELL.

360
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,851
LOTS HIGHER THAN THE DAM

00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,020
ITSELF? 

362
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,488
>> WELL, THE HIGH HAZARD 

363
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:08,194
