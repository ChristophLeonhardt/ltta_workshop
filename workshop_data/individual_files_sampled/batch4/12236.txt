now that I did roll out of bed off my bowl and bran sheets and saw all of the crazy scintillating headlines today let's go through the claims we've been talking about this book all day there's a hot book that's gonna come out over Donald Trump and the White House that's saying he's just awful everything's chaos Steve ban and got smacked down for this let's go through and see which claims are credible which you're not here they are Joker all compiled a great list of the daily wire a lot of other authors have to number one he's not only crazy he's stupid billionaire and Trump confidant Thomas Brock jr. told a friend berrak Barack Barack you know said this is totally false wolf never ran the quote by him to ask if it was accurate he also said it's clear to anyone who knows me that those aren't my words and inconsistent with anything I've ever said what do we think about this I guess he could have said it if he did say it he wouldn't he certainly would deny it at this point that said what motivation does he have to say it what motivation does he have to say it just some nobody lefty reporter or writer I don't see the motivation there I'm skeptical that he said it I'm skeptical that the writer Michael Wolfe heard this in an incredible way number two Melania was in tears and not of joy on election night they didn't want to win the White House they just didn't want to be this is one he wrote a the the author of this book wrote a piece in the New York magazine said Trump didn't really want to be President I it's this is hard to believe guys he's been talking about being president for 30 years he has been encouraged to run for 30 years he flirted with it in the year 2000 and he almost ran for the Reform Party nomination he seriously considered it in 2012 he's been talking about issues of American policy both domestic and international for decades even during the Reagan administration you took out a big ad in the New York Times to question an aspect of the Reagan foreign policy I just don't believe it people do people don't know what it takes to run for even dog catcher or Congress or governor much less president the United States if you don't want it you're not going to do it he wanted to win that's total nonsense number three when Roger Ailes suggested Trump tap former House Speaker John Boehner for White House chief of staff he said who's that don't you get it cuz Trump's such a dummy he didn't know who the Speaker of the House was right ridiculous yet we know yeah Donald Trump tweeted about John Boehner in 2013 he said quote Speaker John Boehner who I like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it he sent out another tweet Danxia or rather Don jr. agrees with that but here's another tweet from Donald Trump about John Boehner in 2015 from tweeted whacky Glenn Beck who always seems to be crying worse than Boehner speaks badly of me only because I refused to do his show a real nutjob you can't have it both ways you can't have it and say that Donald Donald Trump ever does is watch cable news he's glued to Fox News morning noon and night but he's never heard of any of the things that are talked about there sorry guys you have to choose a line of ridiculous attack and Michael wolf is trying to have it both ways it just isn't true another quote from there is working with the president was like trying to figure out what a child wants this was attributed to Katie Walsh White House staffer she denies having said it he's done what he said he would do that's that's what has shocked so many people you know it's sort of surprised me as well but he has done it so trying to figure out what he wants he's been saying what he wants for 30 years this is one of the crazy aspects of trumpism they say he's playing for DHS he isn't for DJ's he said he would nominate originalist he has he said he would cut regulations he has he said that he would lower taxes he has he's just doing what he said he would do and this is confusing a lot of people certainly not like working for a child number five wolf reports that six weeks into office Donald Trump's still had not determined what the new administration's top priorities would be and said that operations in the West Wing were chaotic ditto on the last point exactly did on the last point we we know what the agenda has been he said it during the campaign and he's fulfilled it now what about Michael wolf we know that this guy has very little credibility he this isn't his first book he's been around for a while he admitted to lying in his first book burn rate which was about his time in the early days as an internet entrepreneur you know the dodgiest profession imaginable the dodgiest profession until like bitcoin broker or something so what are some of those allegations he wrote in that book quote how many fairly grievous lies have I told how many moral lapses had I committed how many ethical breaches had I fallen into like any other financial conniver I was in short-term mode so this is a guy who has no credibility is admitting he has no credibility as a matter of honesty he's saying that he's a liar his business collapsed in 1997 surprise surprise is for anyone familiar with the dot-com bubble that book came under siege he took very few notes yet he recounted long conversations verbatim Judith Regan a classmate of wolfs at Vassar disputed every single thing that he wrote about her in that book and said that she hadn't talked to him in 30 years and he admitted that he hadn't talked to her in 30 years Andrew Sullivan the political columnist accused wolf of fabricating whole quotes of his in 2001 in total 13 subjects of burn rate said that wolf invented quotes from them whole cloth so the guy has no credibility the New York New Republic's Michele Caudill wrote about him quote much to the annoyance of wolfs critics the scenes and his columns aren't recreated so much as created springing from wolf's imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events even Woolf acknowledges that conventional reporting isn't his bag he's a droid and making the reader think that he has spent hours and days with his subject when in fact he may have spent no time at all but of course none of that will deter the mainstream media will it absolutely not they are having a field day with all of this that's because they are less credible than Wolfe Esquire says if Michael Wolf's access to Trump surprises you then you don't know Michael Wolfe but New York magazine ran Donald Trump didn't want to be President ha ha Vanity Fair wrote how Michael Wolfe stuck a shiv in Donald Trump Cosmo 5 bombshell revelations about Donald and Melania lationship from new behind-the-scenes book ok all ridiculous and by the way when Ed Klein wrote that book about the Clinton or about Barack Obama rather called amateur did we see bombshell bombshell bombshell and all of those news outlets absolutely not we saw people calling his credibility into question calling the quotes into question but not so here the story is just too good now what about the banning quotes what does this mean about all of the banning quotes Woolf alleges the ban and said quote Donald Jr is a traitor these treasonous that he's going to be cracked like an egg on national TV that the Russian meeting was treasonous that Breitbart is not a legitimate news source a son-in-law Jared Kushner is greasy and that they are sitting on a beach trying to stop a category 5 now Bannen was apparently the guy who allowed wolf into the White House his access appears to have ended Wolf's access when John Kelly took charge their reports came out as early as August the Trump blamed Bannon for the leaks David Moore tosco a conservative writer wrote in case it's not clear to everyone by now Steve Bannon was the single biggest leaker in the White House in the West Wing until his departure Don jr. agrees Donald Jr wrote Steve had the honor of working in the White House and serving the country unfortunately he squandered that privilege and turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing harassing leaking lying and undermining the president Steve is not a strategy strategist he's an opportunist plus most damning of all Trump smacked him down yesterday now Trump's natural reflex is to call BS on the mainstream media to call fake news for some reason though he seems to think Bannon really talked to this guy doesn't mean the quotes are truthful Bannon didn't even join the campaign until two months after the meeting he allegedly treasonous took place but Trump seems to think that he at least said it which makes us perhaps conclude that he's right about banning here at least these banning quotes are right at least been and talked to him the the writer Michael Wolfe says that he has tape of Bannon so we'll have to see about that but the Trump enos of all of it makes me think that at least some of this is true let's bring on the panel to describe it we have flex talks Austin Fletcher and we have Jacob berry guys what do you think is this legitimate is Bannon done flex what do you think I think it is I was hoping that we would have heard something from Bannon before everyone started responding but once we got all the responses from Don jr. and President Trump himself it's kind of seems like you know what said was said and you can't really come back from it now it's like when you kind of hold things in the back of your mind when you have like your girlfriend or a certain relationship and then once you say them you know those certain things that you were holding in forever you can't really take them back and it's never gonna be the same so it's sad to see him go and it's a shame to potentially lose something like Breitbart a big ally of the president hopefully you know he goes two separate way from there and we don't lose Breitbart if that's true and it is pretty gross to think of Steve Bannon and Donald Trump as boyfriend and girlfriend up on and makeout point or something in an old Cadillac but and that's neither here nor there Jacob what do you think I think I think van is pretty much done if if he finds some way to bounce back it's gonna be in Dick Morris style you know where he just kind of makes appearances on Newsmax TV I think and gets caught doing weird things with hookers in hotel rooms sure yeah possibilities here sure but I honestly think he's done I think that he he got fired and he decided to get a little bit of vengeance but it's really hard to get vengeance on the President of the United States especially when you don't know anything so I honestly think that he's had his time he had his moment in the Sun and no one really even knew who he was until this election the the mainstream media kind of made ban in a name so I think that when all this is settled down when dust settles we'll be going Bannon Bannon who absolutely I don't know the guy personally but a number of my friends do some of them sort of like the guy some of them say he's just a monster so I really don't care about Steve Bannon one thing also that makes this seem kind of legit is that a apparently Wolf's access ended way back right when Bannon got kicked out of the White House so it could have been that he was salty about getting fired salty about how things were going he gave these quotes out and now they're dropping it's really a matter of Liberty for me that's all I care about in all of this is the freedom of it all my freedom in particular so Donald Trump has enacted a wonderfully effective conservative agenda he's done it pretty quickly within his first year I like that I want more of that I want lower taxes more tax reform less regulation more originalist justices who are going to respect the Constitution more strength and credibility abroad I don't really care who's doing it if Steve Bannon is gonna help that great be my guest go on and help it but if Steve Bannon is gonna undermine this presidency undermine this administration because of some personal vendetta or because he wants to burn down certain aspects of the Republican Party sorry buddy see you later I don't know No thank you no no no more give me the freedom give me the freedom and if you're going to turn on that and betray somebody and betray a movement and betray your president your candidate then you you're not going to be able to do it it's like if these quotes are true and they do seem fairly legitimate then that big shoe of Donald Trump just came down and squashed the guy you might be trying to crawl out from under it but it's it's no good we just have to keep calm and make America great again okay let's get to the news there so this is sort of Trumpy news of the Virginia House of Delegates now remains in Republican hands because of a lottery in a hat David Yancey candidate there beat his opponent Democrat Shelley Simons after somebody pulled a name out of a hat it was an exact tie there were multiple recounts and so I guess in the Virginia House of Delegates the way you resolve that for the first time in the centuries is you just reach into a hat and pull out the Republican thankfully Jacob is this race the ultimate demonstration of the error behind nevertrump behind well I'd like Trump to win but I don't want to vote for him because it's icky I don't think so I honestly think that this was just like you said it was just recount after recount and I think the people just wanted to see someone seated so they brought in this old archaic rule but as far as weather never Trumper have anything to do this I don't think no remember there's two types of never Trump errs they're the we're gonna vote for Hillary because we hate Trump for some reason and then they're their David French kind of Ben Shapiro and me included in that who are just kind of well we don't believe Trump is a conservative and so far he has been his first year I'll give him credit the most conservative administration since at least Reagan and possibly Coolidge well I wouldn't go that far but I will say I will say that we're still this administration is still young so we could see that lefty side that we know existed in Trump at least for some time but as far as this delegates situation goes I think that they just wanted to in this race and they're like let's just get this over with so that we can seat someone in this house I'm not gonna let you off that easy Jonah Goldberg said that he wanted Trump to win that if the if the vote were a perfect tie and it came down to him to decide the winner he would have picked Trump but nevertheless he will never ever vote for Donald Trump because it's icky because it would be hard to look at himself in the mirror he's not good enough for me he does something like that right and his premise is that his vote doesn't matter my vote doesn't matter this election shows us even one single vote can matter and not just in that little House of Delegates election but it throws the entire body with without this guy winning the Republicans would not control the Virginia House of Delegates anymore so again though I'm not sure what this really has to do with with Trump as far I know you're trying to connect it to college I'll explain to you what it has to do with never Trump never Trump errs were Republicans who said I would like Trump to win generally because it would be better than Hillary Clinton but I don't want to actually vote for him and it's okay because my vote doesn't matter what this shows is that your vote does matter every single vote can matter through a whole election uh you know I don't think that was actually an ever Trump argument I was your birthday that may have been she was a leading never Trump er well okay he was a big name never Trump er I wouldn't say he like was the face of the movement really I would probably have to say that Glenn Beck was probably the face of the never Trump errs but I think that as far as this goes remember I voted I didn't vote for Trump or Hillary so yes I disagree I think you should you should vote in these situations and maybe Mickey Mouse will win and maybe Mickey Mouse a win but if for I know someone who hated Trump but they voted for Trump because they like pence and if that argument had been presented to me hey if we will at least get pence as the VP in a more intellectual way I might have been more persuaded with that argument but to me this this Virginia House race just represents just how how volatile the elections have become in the era of Trump and how important every single vote is in the spirit of Republican unity I will leave it there but I think that conservatives and Republicans should take a lesson from this election and from the closeness of certain races and the actual stakes for the country rather than for how one looks in the mirror flex is a random hat drawing the best solution to a tied election besides obviously recounting and recounting and recounting yeah I don't think it's that bad I think the Democrats should find a way to make this the norm because 5050 odds take that I'll take that all day that's the Democrats could do 5050 odds with the whole thing and pull everyone's name out of a hat I mean that blue wave might happen so you're gonna get a lot of dead people out of the Hat they've been they've been trying versions of this strategy for a fairly long time absolutely right I also do kind of like the whimsy of it of pulling the name out of the Hat because so frequently one of the negative sides of democratic politics especially in an era where politics and entertainment are exactly the same thing is that people treat politics like religion they treat it like they're the the sole focus of their life and that's what give their lives meaning obviously we don't have a mom ARC in America in countries with a constitutional monarchy it's sort of the monarchy that embodies the spirit of the country and is the head of state and the government kind of changes but there's that stability and continuity in liberal democracies like the United States we don't really have that and so I do like the idea of sometimes it's just gonna be pulled out of a hat you're gonna roll the dice that's your leader and it's gonna be okay the government shouldn't dictate every aspect of your life and if it is doing that then you have to fix something about your government more importantly about your culture speaking of the culture Jeff Sessions as Justice Department is cutting an Obama era dereliction of duty and finally enforcing federal law on marijuana so four years thought dispensaries have cropped up all over California and other states with legal marijuana even though those state laws violate federal law now flex you strike me as no stranger to the OL Haitian oregano what should the conservative position on pot legalization be Michael my mother watches this show I'm sorry mrs. talks I'm kind of disappointed because realistically I think California was you know heading towards this liberal utopia which is also basically hell you know it's a sanctuary state much of which is on fire there's tons of homeless people many of them have hepatitis it's not illegal to give people AIDS knowingly anymore right so I was kind of like every time I leave my apartment I live downtown it's basically a Mad Max movie so I'm kind of disappointed that this final piece that could have made you know gone all the way around been California is officially how I thought have been some good action and made it more interesting so I'm a little disappointed to see Jeff Sessions tear these back a little bit that is too bad yeah I really enjoy the cinematography I'm driving around downtown yeah all the explosions and fumes Jacob for a long time the libertarian strain of conservatives and Republicans have said we need to legalize pot obviously all the lefties want to legalize pot I personally don't really have anything wrong with it I just don't care that much except the pro-pot people are so passionate about it and they're so annoying that I really want to make them upset so I want pot to remain illegal I'm really torn on this subject as you can see how should conservatives think about it well I think we should look at it honestly and we should say okay when when we see now I'm coming at it from a conservative perspective not a libertarian perspective but I think we should look at the pros and cons of it one of the it's not as volatile as even alcohol but on the flip side there are people who suffer dire consequences from being addicted to it but also there's the medical aspect of it now I don't believe that marijuana cures cancer I've not seen I've seen nothing but very subjective gossip that it that it has any effect on cancer on cancerous cells but I do think that people who suffer with chronic pain who are who suffer with anxiety maybe it can be medically applied to them now it's be clear though I'm against of all forms of smoking when you have a grandmother who had a lung transplant it kind of takes the wind out of your cells as far as smoking itself goes but I think if we're very Pro brownie I'm out I'm very Pro Brown yes absolutely like I said we can always look at the medical aspect of it but I'm I kind of agree with you that about the the pro pot people they just get so insanely crazy you just want to go oh man just be quiet it also I will say I won't tell any tales at a school I might have tried the old Haitian oregano once or twice I had a local yogurt when I was in India and it turns out that local yogurt was a very mystical indeed here we were on the ganges and i just can't get that into it I just don't really like it that much so as a matter of culture I don't really want to encourage people to do it it's it's not really that fun I find people say it makes you so much funnier that isn't true it you just think things are funnier because you get stupider and hungrier and fatter but you aren't funnier so I don't like that aspect of it it just makes you kind of confused and your heart beats a little faster I can't get that into it at all I would come to a compromise that we can legalize pot if we first legalized Cuban cigars I'm very hopeful I would support that yeah sure that's that's see that's the spirit of compromise we're getting things done the art of the deal gentlemen we got to move on to the mailbag but thank you for being here Austin Fletcher flex talks once again missus talks I'm very sorry I'm only joking and Jakob berry from The Daily wire thank you both I will talk to you soon look I know you want to hear the mailbag we have some really good questions we have some video answers but if you are not subscribed to the daily wire.com we just can't do it folks I'm sorry I want you to stick around if you're on Facebook and YouTube we got to say goodbye if you already subscribe thank you you helped keep the lights on you keep qoph fa in my cup we really appreciate it if you don't subscribe guys come on it's the new year it's the Trump economy 4% economic growth massive tax cuts if you have an S corp you're about to make a ton of more money it's ten bucks a month or $100 for an annual membership what do you get you get me you get the indra Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show no ads on the website but you get this the leftist here's tumblr and I will say I had a knock-down drag-out debate with the Daily wires director of tumblers because as you'll notice I don't use the the lid on the show I drink it without the lid like a civilized person who's not driving a car but I have to tell you all of the lawyers want me to say it comes with a lid so if you if you get it today you'll get a special limited edition Michael Noel's show leftist here's tumbler with a detachable lid so you can use the lid you can take the lid off we're all about freedom of choice here on the right and in the conservative and Liberty movement so go over to the daily wired.com right now we'll be right back first question comes from Aleutian question is what is the UN John take it away the point that I want to leave with you in this very brief presentation is where I started is there is no United Nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and that's the United States when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories if you lost 10 stories today it would make a bit of difference this kind of mindless creation of the United Nations as something different than what it's in the United States interest to do isn't going to sell here or anywhere else the United States makes the UN work when it wants it to work and that is exactly the way it should be because the only question the only question for the United States is what's in our national interest and if you don't like that I'm sorry but that is the fact you said it brother you said that is former UN Ambassador John Bolton I couldn't have said it any better next question from Jason hi Michael I work in tech and never learned much history what books would you recommend for learning about the history of Western civilization I'm trying to avoid the revisionist trash but don't know where to start PS your book is inexplicably good Jason thank you Jason you clearly have great taste in literature so I always recommend this book whenever anyone says I don't know anything about the history of Western civilization I want a kind of recent book to sum things up for me you can start with the modern era that's from about 1500 to 2000 through the present the era that begins with what we would call the Renaissance or the High Middle Ages the best book on that to begin I think is from dawn to decadence by Jacque Morrison he's the guy who started great books at Columbia one of the reasons this book is so good is he'll just include in parentheses other books you should read as he goes through everything from the Protestant revolution all the way up through the present it's a really good work on modern Western story it explains how we got from the advent of Protestantism all the way through the present just about everywhere on earth so it's really really good you should also read maybe the greatest history book ever written through Siddha T's you might notice I borrowed a line from Thucydides to open up my own magnum opus reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide that that's a great ancient history work and really the beginning of I think where you should start on ancient history if you want other things that are kind of in the news people are always attacking Christopher Columbus or was attacking the Pilgrims and the founding of America some good books to start on that that you can breeze through in a day or two maybe two or three days as Samuel Eliot Morrison's book on Christopher Columbus Admiral of the ocean sea is really good he's not a lefty lunatic he's a little bit more conservative historian but a wonderful highly respected historian and a Nathaniel Philbrick is pretty even-handed in his treatment of the pilgrims in the Mayflower this was a very popular American history book that came out maybe ten years ago start with those dawn to decadence is where I would begin and then you can get more into what I think is really fascinating history in the Middle Ages and late Rome but I would begin there and you kind of work your way backwards from what you know to from what is familiar all the way backward into the foundations of your civilization in your culture from Garrett hi Michael I would like you to bring light to my confusion with CS Lewis's law of human nature Louis states that there are typically two instincts that humans face when looking at a problem the right instinct in the wrong instinct and there's a third there's there's a conscience so this argument tends to work for most people but it doesn't work for all for example a child who is out of control does what they want to do without regard for a conscience the typical response for this predicament as the child is not yet learned right from wrong but the moral law that Louis is proposing is saying that right from wrong is built into us I do not know if humans would not would know not to steal murder or line naturally can you please clear this up for me thanks yes absolutely they would know this naturally this these moral laws have been observed in all people at all times in all places now Louis writes is specifically addresses this he says this law was called the law nature because people thought that everyone knew it by nature and did not need to be taught it they did not mean of course that you might not find an odd individual here or there who did not know it just as you find a few people who are colorblind or who have no ear for a tune but taking the race as a whole they thought that the human idea of decent behavior was obvious to everyone so yeah there's gonna be a random psychopath or someone who has no moral sense but these are exceptions that prove rules when it comes to the specific example of little children a three-year-old is the worst individual on the face of the earth right the three-year-olds are just awful monsters of selfishness who demand everything and don't really care about anybody else but this is because they haven't yet reached the age of reason so the age of reason the Catholic Church says the age of reason occurs around seven years old but just about every framework for viewing the world has some sense of the age of reason three-year-olds are not reasonable in the way that older children and then teenagers and adults are reasonable so a way to think of it is that my ability to reproduce is built-in to me it is a fact of nature it isn't something I learn I didn't learn how to reproduce trust me if I were in the woods I would do it just fine and people all over the world have done but I can't produce sperm cells at age four either I haven't yet reached an age of maturity there was a time to every purpose under heaven and so well that law of nature has built into all of us we must mature even Jesus and the Gospels grows in wisdom right he growth he matures because he's in time and space and he's in fleshed in a body so far from contradicting this law of nature it simply tells us something about our own time and our own space and what we have to do to to live as human beings with with bodies as well from Alex hey Michael I have a bit of a dilemma I'm very attracted to the idea of the Catholic Church you know I'm always shocked when we get these Catholic questions we never get these do we Marshall never get that some minutes wonder if I'm very pleased in any case I recognize that if there were to be a one true church the Catholic Church would be the best candidate to hold that mantle however I'm a former member of the LDS Church the Mormon Church that got very thoroughly burned by my whole world become unravelled what advice would you give to someone who loves God is currently active in an evangelical church and would like to know how best to worship Him thanks Alex well I'm glad to hear that you've found an evangelical church that is bringing you closer to God and that you're in and that you're also thinking about joining the Catholic Church and you're thinking that might be the next step that is a little bit retelling of my own return to the Catholic Church I did read a lot of Protestant theologians and evangelical writers and preachers on my way back across the Tiber to - or my Pope ish 2,000 year old institution one of the you bring this up with the LDS Church this is the risk of dealing in real institutions and it's the end it's a real risk of faulty teaching and faulty engagement with the faith this isn't just about LDS or some other derivative of Christianity even Catholic schooling I have a lot of people who come up to me they say Michael you're still in the Catholic Church did you go to Catholic school and I'll say no and they said oh that's why you're still in the Catholic Church I know a lot of people who went to Catholic schooling and they just led them they ran away they they had bad experiences they don't want to associate with their childhood in the pain that comes with being a child or an adolescent so that this is a trouble the thing that you must do is not throw the baby out with the bathwater something that might aid you on your journey there's a wonderful resource called Catholic Answers which is the benefit of being around for 2,000 years and having people during those two millennia debating all of these questions is if you opposed to the Catholic Church what should I have for breakfast on Tuesday morning at 8:00 they'll have an answer they'll say bacon and eggs and you know orange juice or something so you you can consult a lot of the questions you might have on the institution of the church on the sacraments on the Magisterium on the church fathers whatever you can search for it and you'll probably find an answer if you're drawn to the notion that the God who became incarnate and and fleshed and lived for a certain time in a real time in place chose real people to do real things who instituted the Acts of the Apostles and who said Peter on this rock I build my church feed my sheep you have the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven if you if that leads you to conclude that maybe there is a real church with a real order real people running it then I encourage you in that and don't be discouraged the devil likes to discourage us that's his main tool is to say no no cynicism you know that no no it's all fake people are all fools and don't ever commit yourself to something real that will make you vulnerable don't don't fall into that trap proceed in joy and and seriousness you know and with joy and prudence and I wish you luck on your journey from Preston hey Michael I'm 20 years old and I reside in Chattanooga Tennessee I just recently received a premium subscription to The Daily wire well congratulations I mean you're gonna survive the floods that's really good pal I'm going to see you on the ark and the ark that'll just be it'll just be people floating on left us cheers tumblers I couldn't have asked for a better gift I am having trouble finding a major that suits me a major in college I assume I enjoy theology and politics any suggestions yes I don't necessarily recommend studying either of those undergraduate theology might be good to study I don't recommend political science really any of the social sciences I prefer disciplines that are older that are more grounded in the university the social sciences came about relatively recently they came about as theories to apply the scientific method to things that don't necessarily lend themselves to the scientific method such as human affairs government history I majored in history that was one of my majors in college I recommend that history will give you a grounding for anything that you want to do it will give you in my view a better political education than a political science ever would political philosophy is an interesting field of study but it's fallen totally out of favor at the University in favor of political science which I don't have a ton of respect for I would study that if you if you're interested in politics and theology I might study the classics I might study literature I think literature is a wonderful way to engage in both theology and politics literature basically converted Andrew Clavin to Christianity literature and Christmas cookie so that's one recommendation for it but in an older field of study and older discipline I think will serve you well in any of your interests from Jessica dear Michael how do you know how the new tax plan will affect freelance musicians Thank You Jessica well as a former freelance actor myself you'll probably be fine because freelance artists don't make any money in mine in my own humble experience of it it actually will help you a lot I think because of the advantages to pass-through entities so a lot of freelance artists have an s-corporation they'll incorporate themselves so an actor could incorporate himself and then deduct movie tickets wardrobe haircuts whatever you can deduct things that feed into the business of that if you're a blank book writer like me then you could deduct blank sheets of paper or pens without any ink in them those could be business deductions as well under the new tax plan you can deduct I think up to 25 percent of your income so that is a real nice benefit if you're an artist I assume you live in one of these godforsaken cities with high city and state and local taxation like Los Angeles or New York that part will ding you a little bit but I think it'll be more than made up for on the S corpse if you haven't incorporated yourself as an artist and you do make an income incorporate yourself there are a lot of benefits to it from Nathan Michael Noel's king of the trolls what is your favorite color Nathan my favorite color is green there's no joke there's no any addition to that I just really like the color green green like money I guess from Marcus hi Michael I love your show my question when should we hit a bully back twice as hard and when should we turn the other cheek please answer using biblical references people misunderstand this all the time a lot of people who would just take Christianity to be just some small aspect of it they'll become pacifists they'll say we should never punch back don't ever fight back they've only read a couple lines of the Bible and they'll say see it says this they haven't read the other things GK Chesterton wrote northa doxy that heresy is not the promotion of Vice it's just a promotion of one virtue to the exclusion of all the others that's what they're getting at but don't forget to classy ass tees there is a time for everything and a season for every purpose under heaven there's a time for war and a time for peace in the same breath that Christ says turn the other cheek he also says if your right eye causes you to sin pluck it out and throw it away I don't know that he means that literally if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away I don't know that he means that literally as we mean literally he says do not say anything other than yes or no everything else that you say comes to evil of course he doesn't mean that literally cuz he says many other things and he tells st. Paul takes many oaths it takes many vows he says only pray in your inner closet but then Christ praise in public as well so Christ also says to the Apostles if you don't have a sword sell your cloak and buy one he says that very explicitly st. Agustin and st. Thomas Aquinas both explained just war very well all the reasons when wars can legitimately be undertaken Santa Claus himself st. Nicholas punched a heretic in the face at the first Council of Nicaea when we're talking about that Sermon on the Mount Christ sums up the whole sermon in the next chapter he says seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be yours as well that's what he's telling us seek first the kingdom of God then follow everything else and then he gives us these examples these parabolic examples these hyperbolic examples do not you shouldn't strike back at somebody for spite or for cruelty or even really for vengeance so I don't think that you should be doing it say ah that'll hurt him and that will give me great pleasure and joy but our Lord is also not telling us to be doormats and to let the cruel rape the face of the earth Christ is speaking of a spiritual strategy to Humble the self and to win other souls over to him but not everybody has moved necessarily by this humility so we should love our neighbors as ourselves but sometimes we all need a little bit of tough love don't we a priest friend of mine keeps a baseball bat near the door of his rectory because it's not a great neighborhood there have been break-ins and burglaries of the poor box I one time asked him about this and he explained it to me sometimes there just isn't time to turn the other cheek that's my feeling as well that's our whole show for today be sure to tune in to another kingdom it's finally back my podcast with Andrew Klavan the next chapter is up chapter 11 episode 11 and we're coming to a big climax in this if you haven't caught up listen it's a really fun narrative podcast that is going to go up tomorrow morning tune in on Monday we'll be back to do it all over again I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show we'll see you then the Michael Noel's show is produced by Marshall Benson executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey supervising producer Mathis Glover our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex's and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Cora Mina hair and makeup is by Jeshua alvera the Michael Knoll show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing 2017
