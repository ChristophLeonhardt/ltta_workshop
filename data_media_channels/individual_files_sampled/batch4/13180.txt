Mitt Romney is running for office again in some other state he moved to five minutes ago in other news the sky will appear blue today and water will remain wet we will analyze the many many faces of Mitt Romney what the inevitable senator Romney means for the Trump administration and why Republicans need more conviction politicians and fewer squishes from dynastic liberal families then breaking news new evidence from the Muller investigation has undercut claims that Trump colluded with the Russkies and Jimmy Kimmel is crying again aren't you shocked and that crazy I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show I get this question all the time in my mailbag we've got so much to talk about today we have really really great stuff in the news because we'll make fun of Jimmy Kimmel for crying but we'll talk about why it matters and also why we should learn some lessons from never Trump Republicans all the way from Mitt Romney to Bret Stevens but I get this question the mailbag I don't know two times a day three times a day Michael how can I feel like I'm sleeping with you I get it constant I get it I get it from people here at the Daily wire the way to do that of course is to get yourself a set of Bolin brand sheets Bolin brand sheets are so nice look you and I we're never gonna agree on everything are we maybe we will and we'll probably agree on this too we could all use some more sleep you know last night I kid you not I only got 15 hours I got 15 hours of sleep but I showed up today because I knew I had to be here and I knew that I had to spread a little cough fi and joy into your life you know the best way to get a great night's sleep is to use really premium bedding and I don't know if you know this premium bedding costs a lot of money it can cost about $1,000 I usually would just scrape pieces of cardboard apart and lay them on my bed because I was very cheap now I don't have to do that because I've Bolin Branch sheets and boa branch is really good everything that they make from bedding to blankets is from 100% pure organic cotton which means that they start off very super soft and they get even softer over time it kind of reminds me if you've ever stayed in a really really nice high-end hotel I've never paid to stay in a high-end hotel but I have stayed in a couple and you know being an actor you're gonna we'll go into that later but they'll have really really high-end bedding and it just feels like that free but you get it every single night and it gets softer over time so you can buy directly from them so you're essentially paying wholesale prices with bold and branch instead of spending a thousand dollars which is what it costs from a lot of other companies you buy direct from them it is much much less expensive like it's just a fraction of that cost maybe a couple hundred bucks so everyone who tries Bowen brand sheets that loves them that's why they have thousands of five-star reviews Forbes The Wall Street Journal Fast Company are all talking about Bolin branch even three u.s. presidents sleep on Boland branch and me three US presidents and little old me sleep on these sheets and you should sleep on them - don't let barack obama have all the fun you don't come on guys like listen it's 2018 treat yourself make sure that you can at least indulge as much as those three US presidents shipping is free and you can try them for 30 nights if you don't love them send them back for a refund but you will not want to send them back i promise you you won't want to send them back but there's no risk at all so even if you do you know you'll get them for thirty nine thirty nights of decent sleep and that'll probably power you for a few more months and then when you try to do it again so to get started right now my listeners don't you ever say that i never did anything for you my listeners get fifty dollars off of these sheets that is really good so you're paying a fraction of the price already and you have fifty bucks off of that your first set of sheets at bowl and branch calm promo code michael mi CH AE L go to Boleyn branch dot-com today for fifty dollars off of your first sets of sheets that is bol l and branch comm promo code Michael fifty dollars off your first set of sheets very very good okay Mitt Romney is running for office again is it is it a day that ends in Y it's got to be a day that ends in Y because Mitt Romney it's really for office and the main takeaway from it I'm sorry to say is that Mitt Romney has not learned anything over these past few decades here is the Romney announcement video Utah's admired not only for its beauty but also for the character of its people you tones are known for hard work innovation and our can-do pioneering spirit but more than these we're known as a people who serve who care and who rise to any occasion Utah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington Utah has balanced budgets Washington is buried in debt Utah exports more abroad than it imports Washington has that backwards Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion and on Utah's capitol hill people treat one another with respect I have decided to run for United States Senate because I believe I can help bring Utah's values and Utah's lessons to Washington Utah is a better model for Washington than Washington is for Utah we feel that this is the right time for me to serve our state and our country I ask for your support and your hopes and look forward to meeting you over the coming year I'm Mitt Romney from the 1990s I'm running for our state I love our he says our state about oh when it comes to Utah that's very cute he's lived in Utah for five seconds now he just keeps him moving to wherever he's gonna run from so I guess I guess he went to college in Utah and then he went you know he lived all of his life in Massachusetts worked there Bain Capital was the governor of Massachusetts then when he wanted to run for president in 2012 again for the second time he moved to New Hampshire he started living in New Hampshire then and now that he wants to run for Senate from Utah he's gonna move to Utah and talk about our Utah values you know you've been there for three seconds the other aspect of this is like clearly the advice that his political advisors gave him was mitt you know the trouble with the 2012 race is you weren't plastic enough you weren't robotic enough it wasn't a preen of preening and you know pristine commercial enough to get you over the finish line in 2012 he's learned all of the wrong lessons clearly and that's just on the design front I mean this doesn't work in 2018 this is something that Donald Trump showed us the way that the media works now is not traditional we've moved into new media platforms we've moved into social media and what people like is authenticity we've seen a lowering of all of these things even from our movie stores or you know movie stores now we see them on Instagram it used to be that you would never see them until you were at the movies now they go they make PSAs and they tweet and they go on Instagram it's much closer it's much more personal and that's how Donald Trump was able to connect directly the American people it's still how he connects to the American people and cuts through the mainstream media because his Twitter account has a much wider reach than the New York Times could ever hope to have Mitt Romney didn't learn that lesson he's running campaign ads from the early 2000s you you have to keep up this is what happens when politics becomes corporate and becomes a bit ossified is you can't pivot you rely on these consultants who very frequently don't know anything they don't know very much about the candidate and they don't know very much about the race and so they're always running the last election they're always running the last campaign because they learn everything they were supposed to do you know and whenever the last Senate campaign was in Utah and they're not keeping up with the times Mitt Romney clearly hasn't kept up with the times that's just on the visual aspect from the content of it it's very anti Trump he says that Washington is sending an exclusionary message to immigrants that is ridiculous the immigration to native population ratio is the highest in this country that's been since the 1890s over a hundred years ago that in and that immigration period in the 1890s gave us the Kennedys so maybe we should be careful to see which god-awful political dynasty we're importing now from some other country in the world it's really frustrating because one would think that after he was so anti Trump during the campaign he might have pivoted and realized that we're playing in a new political reality maybe said I was wrong about a few things I shouldn't have said this this was a little too much but that that isn't what happened he's doubling down on all of these things he not only is he not listening to the American people and to his constituents when it comes to the tactics of campaigning but he's not even listening to them on the content you will remember during the 2016 campaign Romney was a V anti-trump here he is excoriating the eventual GOP nominee there are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life this is one of them being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement he understands that our economy is facing threats from abroad he's one of the few people who stood up and said you know what China has been cheating they've they've taken jobs from Americans they haven't played fair we have to have a president who will stand up to cheaters we believe in free trade of free enterprise but we don't believe in allowing people to cheat day in and day out I spent my life in the private sector not quite as successful as this guy oh no wait a minute that wasn't when he was excoriating Donald Trump in 2016 that was what he was saying exactly the opposite four years earlier begging for his endorsement when he said that Donald Trump is a better business businessman than I am Donald Trump is right about China he's right about trade he's trying to pad all of these things what a magnificent hotel Donald thank you for the honor of hosting me here that was four years ago but now now now we get the real Mitt Romney in 2016 here was Romney excoriating Trump last year two years ago Donald Trump is a phony a fraud his promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University he's playing the members of the American public for suckers he gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat and let me put it very plainly if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee the prospect for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished if Donald Trump's plans were ever implemented the country would sink into prolonged recession is it he a huge business success doesn't he know what he's talking about no he isn't and no he doesn't well your city is more successful than you so so what does that tell us about you MIT a phony and a fraud huh phony and a fraud a wonder I wonder if the the Romney doth protest too much we have to analyze this a little bit more in all of the all of the ridiculous predictions he made that did not come through but before we do that I listen I I'm a man who likes to stay on time you know that that's why we that's why I can't get to all this right now and I love movement watches I'm wearing my movement watch now I wear it all the time you might say this this is a new one I got it's from their new collection called the RUF Oliver collection and it is so cool how sleek is this watch is there a sleeker watch out there no I don't think there is it is really cool it's the kind of retro but it's I think I think it's called retro futuristic even that seems like a contradiction it's got a very modern dial retro build though I really really like it we've gotten a lot of compliments on it and it's fine it's actually at the bank the other day and I was caching a bunch of checks and no doubt for not doing any work some kind of other blank thing I was doing and and the guy handed it in and the guy at the bank teller he said wow really like your watch man that's a cool looking watch I said listen if you use my promo code I'll catch you 15% off we can really both benefit here movement watches is is the biggest watch company in the world you know it's the fastest growing watch company in the world it's the one that that you've really got to keep your eye on because they they just started a few years ago and it has grown like gangbusters it was started by these two college dropouts they've now sold watches in over 160 countries they've sold almost 2 million watches so given the amount of time that they've been around they are the biggest thing on the market I don't know if you checked out the site lately they have doubled the number of watch styles and they're still expanding and I hope they keep expanding and so that I can get maybe a couple more of these things and mix and match them and the reason you can do that I always loved watches have worn watches since I was seven or eight years old and because I felt if you're gonna be a serious person or even look like a serious person you've got to wear a watch you have to keep time keep a schedule have places to go and people to see and but I never wanted to spend ever those insane prices for timepieces that until recently you had to pay five thousand six thousand dollars I couldn't do it even if you wanted a really nice looking watch a watch that's kind of presentable a little more versatile if you went to a department store a watch like this would cost five hundred dollars four or five hundred dollars luckily with movement they skip all of that middleman so you can buy direct from them and you can get watches at an incredible price point movement watches start at just 95 dollars they've not only introduced a ton of new watch collections for both men and women they've also actually expanded to sunglasses and fashion-forward bracelets for her or for him I don't know listen it's 2018 you know you don't need to we don't need to have these gender stereotypes and gender socially constructed gender roles they're all about looking good and keeping it simple movement watches don't tell you how many steps you've taken I really I'm not a big fan of that kind of watch I like an elegant simple timepiece I don't want it I don't want it to tell me how many steps I've taken because I usually don't take them any steps that's very depressing when I do that and this is a timepiece it's a timepiece that tells you the time it doesn't tell you how many hamburgers you've eaten or what the temperature is in Timbuktu it just tells you the time and a nice elegant analog dial and it doesn't blow up your wrist with text messages you know some watches do that now I don't answer text messages ever on my computer or on my phone I certainly won't do it on my watch so it's really great you'll get the the best price of possible because they sell direct you online classic design quality construction styled minimalism and I'm gonna give you the same offer I gave my bank teller you can get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns so it's totally no risk whatsoever by going to movement comm / coffe FA that's MVM t-dot-com / coffe fa co v fe fe we've left the vowels in the promo code in the cafe but we've taken them out of the movement so you should see why the movement keeps growing check out their expanding collection go to MVM t-dot-com / co FFA co v fe fe enjoin the movement so ok we've got we got to get back to mit romney now all of those predictions he says if if Donald Trump becomes president the economy is going to fall into recession economy is growing at rates we haven't seen in a decade the economy is blowing up the market took us a little bit of a hit during the election and then it shot right back up and it's it's done very well consumer confidence is very high we're finally after a decade seeing wages increase we didn't see that at any point in the last 10 years the economy is doing very very well even the IMF credits Donald Trump with boosting the global economy the International Monetary Fund no particular fan of American conservatism but they have credited Donald Trump and the tax reform bill the tax reform now law with raising the global economy so all those predictions were totally wrong by the end of the speech mit romney preening as one might do during that election says this is a time for choosing and what he's referencing is Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater a time for choosing you and I have a rendezvous with destiny how dare Mitt Romney invoke a time for choosing how dare he compared himself with Ronald Reagan he here is Mitt Romney on Ronald Reagan you can judge for yourself look I was an independent during the time of Reagan Bush I'm not trying to return to Reagan Bush oh that's that's really what political courage what's standing with conviction the conscience of a conservative Mitt Romney that was Romney running against Ted Kennedy in 1994 for Senate in Massachusetts I was an independent during the time of Reagan Bush I don't like Reagan Bush I never watched Ronald Reagan I didn't even like GE theater I'm not with the Gipper I won't win one for the Gipper it's just pathetic and now he comes up here and he's what we now know in retrospect is that Donald Trump has governed as a conservative we know that he's been a conservative president and therefore his campaign promises came true he was he campaigned to govern as a conservative and you have Mitt Romney coming up there pretending to be the standard-bearer of conservatism meanwhile he's dissing Ronald Reagan throughout much of his political career pathetic but we should have known this from Romney because Romney comes from a family of liberal Republicans Romney cites his father George as his hero his guiding star in politics George Romney was another failed liberal Republican presidential candidate he was also the three-term governor of Michigan Bill Buckley we always talk about the conservative movement we have all these people saying about movement conservatism what about the movement I know Donald Trump's doing great conservative things but what about the movement Bill Buckley started the conservative movement to keep the Romneys out of office he to the first Romney explicitly in 1968 he ran against liberal Republican John Lindsay for mayor of New York he sometimes supported Democrats over liberal Republicans because of what a threat liberal Republicans were of the movement the conservative purl closures the the on the right that you know they they constantly now are endorsing Romney they've largely embraced this guy in opposition to Trump who regardless of his performance on the campaign trail or whatever things he said on television in the year 2000 as govern is a conservative how do the Romney's govern George Romney as governor of Michigan not only raised taxes but he passed Michigan's first income tax the George Romney hated federalism he said quote as far as I'm concerned states have no rights only people have rights obstructionism masquerades as states states rights as the height of folly which is outrageous by the way our framers set up a federal system such that the federal government would be run in part by the states and in part by the people that's why the Senate was elected by the states and the house was elected by the people though that fell apart after the 17th amendment alleged the direct election of senators the framers needed the states to have power because that's the only way that you can present prevent against demagoguery the the need of the state stepped power because it maintains the individual character of different parts of America and it doesn't make it into some homogenized bland gray a bureaucratic technocratic single state government George Romney initially supported Vietnam and then he accused the generals of brainwashing him and said that he no longer supported the war and it was terrible he did that thing he sort of cut and run I guess is the phrase we would use today Mitt Romney for much of his political career has followed in his father's ideological footsteps let's just run through a quick little history of Mitt Romney in politics when running for Senate in 94 Mitt Romney supported gutting the First Amendment right to political speech by limiting campaign contributions he flipped on this in 2007 initially he had the same point of view as Hillary Clinton on this then he flipped in 2007 but his explanation totally missed the point he said when he flipped he said the original intent of mccain-feingold campaign finance reform was to reduce the role of money and special interests in our political system but on this too it has been a failure political spending has been driven into secret corners and more power and influence has been handed to hidden special interests he's gotten the reasoning here totally totally wrong the problem is not money in politics money in politics is protected by the First Amendment because money is speech if I want to hold up a sign that says don't elect Mitt Romney anymore guys we should elect conservatives oh I'm going to have that sign cost the money to make that sign that's what I can campaign donation goes toward and now it is true is bizarre to think that any law would wrote money out of politics there's no way that that would possibly happen big politics attracts big money but we shouldn't even be trying to get money out of politics we know that money in politics doesn't decide elections anyway Donald Trump was outspent two-to-one Hillary Clinton spent twice as much money on her campaign as Donald Trump and he crushed her in the electoral college it was a landslide you don't need to worry you don't need to protect the American people from themselves and from their own freedom of speech and from their own desires they can govern themselves just fine thank you very much Mitt Romney said that he supported the Citizens United decision which repealed all of those campaign finance laws there's anti-constitutional campaign finance laws but then Romney criticized the substance of the decision saying I'm not crazy about corporations making political contributions as a concept why not this is the same man who said corporations are people my friend and he was right when he said that corporations are people a corporation isn't a building a corporation isn't a parking lot corporation isn't a desk with a computer on it it's people working in corporation with one another in corporate right but without citizens united how on earth could we defend a newspaper endorsing a political candidate is that the newspaper isn't a person is it the newspaper is it it's a corporation but corporations are people my friend Romney you see this constantly he always wants to have it both ways he always I don't I don't feel comfortable saying this conservative thing he'll say it let me walk sit back and you just don't know where the guy stands as governor of Massachusetts he said he was quote absolutely committed to fighting global warming because he said quote I think the global warming debate is now pretty much over and people recognize the need associated with providing sources which do not generate the heat currently provided by fossil fuels I don't think that's true I don't think scientific debates are over I don't think they're pretty much over and I certainly don't think this one it's over perhaps we should bring on our friend Richard linson again to talk about this the MIT atmospheric physicist who who would think contradict Mitt Romney on that point but MIT Romney again is taking this political highbrow elite position don't we know what's best and listen listen we know what's best for you come on you silly little rubes I've read the science papers and even that isn't true Romney as governor supported higher taxes on SUVs and taxing developers for cutting down trees in the suburbs he's supported expanding the soda can tax the bottle bills you know you have to pay more money whenever you buy 17,000 cases of aqua at the supermarket as one does he appointed prominent environmentalists to regulate industry he put limits on oil and gas drilling he subsidized hybrid hippie cars that which no Republican should ever drive the only Hybrid a Republican should drive is a Lamborghini that burns motor oil and gasoline he refused to offer tax relief on the gasoline tax during those sky high gas prices of 2006 his lieutenant governor wanted some tax relief for people you remember how high taxes were or how high gas prices were back then and he said no no we can't do it we need to teach people a lesson about conserving energy a more out-of-touch elite position one cannot imagine he supported cap and trade cap and tax as governor though he flipped on this when he ran for president again he provided no sufficient explanation as to why he flipped on this when he was governor he opposed the Bush tax cuts for some reason I was one of the best aspects of the Bush administration every conservative was on board for it he opposed it I don't know why and of course his governor Mitt Romney invented Obama care he invented the prototype of Obama care he installed it in his state and then he lobbied the federal government for an expansion of Medicare a federal federal entitlement program the sort of which is responsible for driving all of the debt quite a record quite record in office for me Romney now all politicians change their minds that happens I've changed my mind about a lot of things I'm sure you have to Donald Trump has certainly changed his mind about things with Trump though the comparison doesn't really hold with Trump he said lefty things on television in the year 2000 and then he said he changed his mind and as president he's been very conservative his record in governing is a conservative record his rhetoric might be all over the place his Twitter account might be all over the place but his record his actions are conservative Mitt Romney's his public speech record is also all over the place but his record is liberal his record as governor was liberal Romney he might say conservative things on the campaign trail but then he'll govern it at best like a liberal Republican the proof of the pudding is in the tasting that's the case with government and a note on that phrase people always say the proof is in the pudding which doesn't make any sense what does that even mean what is the proof in the pudding the phrase is actually the proof of the pudding is in the tasting which does make sense just that's just a little sidebar now I don't mean to rundown Romney too much I voted for Romney in the general election in 2012 because he was obviously better than Obama I don't think he's a bad man in the way that a lot of politicians can be he seems like a nice enough guy I'd love to share a decaffeinated coffee with him or something whatever we could drink you know but I didn't vote for the man in the primary most of my conservative friends didn't vote for him in the primary except for them the more elite ones I've actually worked for two of his opponents in that primary I didn't think he was a good candidate then certainly he wasn't a good candidate as we were running explicitly against Obamacare we we nominated the only guy on earth who could claim to have invented Obamacare not a great judgment call but we have to question Mitt Romney's judgment here we have to question his judgment for political considerations and for policy considerations Mitt Romney undercut the GOP nominee in 2016 and disingenuously claimed to be the standard-bearer of conservatism this is no small thing he turned on his party and I'm not saying you can never turn on your party or turn on a candidate or a nominee but you better be right you better be right when you do it and he wasn't and he didn't he wasn't right about it and it blowing up in his face that is a big thing just to basically say I would prefer Hillary Clinton become president then the Republican candidate become president the Republican nominee become president that is that is a big statement and it appears that that's what Mitt Romney said I don't think we just let him off the hook for that especially given his very liberal record in government he he also in terms of questioning his judgment he made a bunch of hysterical predictions that proved completely incorrect it didn't happen America is safer abroad than we've been we've been in ten years America the American economy is doing much better than it has been doing in ten years on social policy we've got more social policy concern social policy coming out of this administration than we did out of George W Bush administration and he was a social conservative but we're getting more social conservative policy out of Donald Trump than out of him we're getting the embassy moved to Jerusalem in Israel just that takes such brass cojones of conservatism to say we're not going to let these other middle eastern states boss us around and tell us where we're gonna put our embassy that's a really beautiful thing we as a matter of foreign policy he's handled our adversaries and our allies much better than Barack Obama did were closer to our allies and were putting much more pressure on our adversaries then after all of that Mitt Romney tried to suck up to Donald Trump to become Secretary of State we had that photo you remember that photo yeah so this is the biggest questioning of his judgment I think did he ever think the Trump was gonna make him Secretary of State Donald Trump invited him to dinner to get that picture that's the only reason he did it and Romney fell for it because he really wanted to get a position in the administration he spent a year lambasted this guy in pretty brutal and personal terms and then and then when we see that he just caved do we really need more Romney's that's best kind of what it comes down to do we need more Romney's or even Bush's and I'd like the bushes a lot I'm a fan of the bushes I'll break from some of the people on the hard right I think they're they're great they're fine but don't forget Bush was added to the Reagan ticket to appease the elite wing of the Republican Party to appease the moderates and the liberals in the establishment he wasn't added as some ribbed conservative he never pretended to be a rock ribbed conservative neither did george w bush george w bush actually seemed to imply in the 2000 campaign the conservatism is cruel because he said i'm gonna be a compassionate conservative he actually echoed what his father did after reagan his father said we need a kinder gentler conservatism and nancy reagan was very offended by this and said then who kindly and gentler than who george so these guys were never conservatives they never pretended to be conservatives they did fine i love i love the george bush senior stood by ronald reagan he was a model vice president that's something we should admire him for and george w bush reacted well in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 we should give him credit for that too and he had some domestic advantages also nominated some good at justices we had a lido out of him although we've gotten Gorsuch out of trump that's really nice what what I do mean is that the GOP needs conviction politicians it needs conviction politicians not journeyman politicians not career politicians not social politicians who just seem to want to be in the office and go to the dinners and be an important person and be a be a just a statesman or appear like a statesman we need people who believe something we need people who actually have beliefs I don't know that Mitt Romney has beliefs I'm sure he has I'm sure he has core beliefs but I don't think he has core political beliefs exactly none that he's really shown us all advances of conservative policy and governance have come through conviction politicians like Ronald Reagan we need to seriously rethink our vision of politics the conservative movement needs to seriously rethink its vision of politics Winston Churchill is the great example of this a Winston Churchill he used to eat would fly airplanes and he was already a well-done figure at this point he escaped from prison camps in South Africa as a hero from the Boer War you've written books and he was a journalist so anyway he would fly these airplanes and he would he wasn't good at flying them so he crashed them now and he would he crashed them three times and by the the third time it was a pretty tough crash nearly fatal and he was interviewed about this and they say aren't you shouldn't you give this up aren't you crazy to be flying these airplanes and Winston Churchill said something profound as he often did he said I love life but I do not fear death and and you see this throughout his political career he loved life he does not fear death you see this when he broke out of a South African prison camp you saw this in all of his war service when he was in in military academy he begged to go to Cuba to help the Spanish put down an insurrection just cuz just cuz just so that he could see some action and get trained and have bullets whizzed by him he said it was the first time he ever had the pleasure of being shot at missed you know this is a guy who he did love life it's not just like he was on a suicide mission it's not just I don't care about death and he's a crazy person he did love life he doesn't fear death this is the Christian position this is the this is what we should think of as conservatives this is what we should think of as Americans these are the kinds of politicians that we need Ronald Reagan was a conviction politician he was the kind of guy who said this is what I believe I'm not gonna try to pander to everybody in the room and make that guy think I'm saying one thing and make that guy think I'm saying another thing and just that mealy mouth of Bill Clinton yes Bill Clinton but what he thought about the Desert Storm what he thought about the first Iraq war and he said if the vote were close I would have voted with the majority but I sympathized with the opinion of the minority that and that is almost a verbatim quote I don't have the exact word head is almost a verbatim quote classic clintonism well it depends what the meaning of the word is is you don't hear that from Ronald Reagan right Ronald Reagan tells you anything's straight forward in many ways Donald Trump does this to people say Trump doesn't know what he believes he doesn't say what he believes doesn't believe anything I don't see that clearly he does believe certain things clearly he does I don't know that he could give a time for choosing speech I don't think he's steeped in conservative thought and in historical thought and philosophical thought as such that he could give a great oration like that but I think he has beliefs I think he has gut believes and you see it with Twitter Twitter gives you a little bit of a glimpse into this guy as a thought process because there aren't a ton of filters there even if some people are writing some things or whatever you get a decent view into what he's thinking and he has these gut reactions so the NFL players is is one of them these NFL players are making a mockery of our country they're they're so ignorant Lee undermining even their own protests because only in America could you do this only in America could you so disrespect your own flag which the flag which gives you the right to protest your own flag and Donald Trump's reaction to that isn't oh well I I guess you know what we should say is they have to right do this of course but really but blah blah blah you said this is terrible this is a terrible thing they should stand for their flag it's that simple if you were raised right you know that it's a terrible thing you should stand for your flag it's your country you should love your country and it's America which is the best country ever and you should love that I think he has that gut feeling a gut patriotism when asked who he would vote for in the election Ben Stein a Republican journeyman economist speechwriter for Nixon and also famous actor he said you know I suppose I'll vote for Donald Trump I don't think he knows a damn thing about economics but his campaign is Pro America and Hillary's is anti America it's about ripping America down that that's an important thing and we'll talk about that a little bit to some of the priorities that we have to think about here but you might see in Ronald Reagan something akin to a conviction politician or at least what a conviction politician looks like in our current culture which doesn't have very many deep convictions we might see the best of that in in Donald Trump okay do I have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I do doughnut that's terrible I'm sorry because we have a lot more to get to but well I guess I'm saying goodbye to Facebook I said goodbye to YouTube a long time ago YouTube I think YouTube said goodbye to me a long time ago when they started censoring all of our materials if you're on Facebook make sure you head on over to daily wire calm right now why well you'll get me you'll get the Andrew Klavan show you got the Ben Shapiro show that's all great you'll get the conversation next one up is the big boss himself Ben Shapiro you can ask him any question you want he'll answer them everybody can watch but only subscribers can ask questions many are called few are chosen but none of that matters you guys see Jimmy Kimmel last night I assume you guys saw Jimmy Kimmel right well I hope you had this handy be well I know you had this handy because anyone who didn't is now floating in a puddle in their house they're floating upside down or something you need the leftist ears tumblr I don't know how many times I have to tell you this you need this to protect yourself and your and your your womenfolk and your children your family in your possessions this is the only fda-approved vessel to contain salty and delicious leftist tears of whether hot or cold you can have them however they come out but we're getting them from Jimmy Kimmel we're getting them all over the place and make sure that you get the leftist here's tumblr daily wire calm we'll be right back to talk about all of the fake news the school shooting and Jimmy Kimmel and so much more daily wire calm we'll be right back okay so III will just touch on this at the beginning will loop back to it at the end this horrific school shooting was really awful and the left wasted no time in demagoguing it it was it was just terrible they're saying that that the shooter was a white nationalist and I haven't met that many white nationalists named cruise or Fernandez or Jew Carelli or what I am meto tell a lot of those you know but I guess there's a first time for everything you know there are a lot of fake statistics going around some are saying that there have been 18 school shootings in 2018 that isn't true there they're playing around with the statistics at most you can say that a gun was even accidentally discharged five times around schools in 2018 but that isn't either here nor there we'll get back to what we really have to take away from this at by the end of our show in a little little last moment first breaking news the Muller investigation has indicted 13 Russians for trying to meddle in the 2016 election Russian information warfare sought to bolster Trump and hurt Hillary during the election but after the election that same machine sought to bolster anti Trump protests the so-called resistance so this is really great they said that they said for so long the the Russians were to help they're helping Trump they're here for Trump then we said well I don't know if that's true the Russians obviously always want to screw up our political process they've been doing that for a century they've been doing that since the Russian Revolution but I don't know they really liked why do they like Trump Trump's doing things to harm them just the other day we've apparently us back troops slaughtered dozens of Russians in Syria right I mean we are literally killing these people on the battlefield so it doesn't make a lot of sense and now it makes sense and I love it so much because all those people wearing the little hats the the hats and with these disgusting profane signs and paper mache things their tools of Russia those guys are tools of Russia because the the so-called resistance has started a lot of the anti-trump protests immediately after he won the presidency the indictment that we see now reads quote defendants and their co-conspirators used false us personas to organize and coordinate other false us personas to organize and coordinate us political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 presidential election one of those rallies included Trump is not my president which was held right after the election in 2016 so now now listen to that you I don't know if you picked up one of the little lines there Democrats are trying to shut this up they were using us personas we're using us personas the indictment goes on quote some defendants posing as US persons and without revealing their Russian Association communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities did you catch that did you I don't know if you caught that that means so they weren't saying they were Russians that means that if anybody tried to collude with them and by collude we mean some guy comes to you on your campaign and says I have dirt on your opponent 100 percent of politicians take that meeting which they should that's what a campaign is for anything else would be campaign negligence anything else would be negligent to your donors and your constituents and your candidate so they they took that meeting the operatives from Russia pretended to be Americans which means there's no collusion that means that there's no evidence of collusion for the 500 millionth time more evidence mounting as ever to quote what Dianne Feinstein accidentally said and what Van Jones accidentally said the rush of collusion story is a nothing burger we see it now from Bob Muller it's giving me faith in the Mulder investigation by the way that these indictments are coming out who knows I'm still a little skeptical he's clearly has too much power should never have been appointed in the first place but not too bad I'll take what I can get really good stuff they're gonna try to cover this up all day so make sure if you're on Twitter or if you've got some Democrat friends make sure to yell it really loudly in their faces say see here is evidence that they were not colluding they were it's logically impossible for this to have been Russian collusion okay other good news the immigration deal failed what do you need to know about this it's a little confusing there was a big Senate bipartisan immigration deal that the White House basically shut down it of legalised at least 1.8 million a future Democratic voters are people who were likely 3.5 times 28.7 five times as likely to vote for Democrats as for Republicans Democrats were pretty thrilled about that it gave some border protection it sort of dealt with a little bit of the chain migration problem all you need to know about this issue is that the immigration deal failed Ted Cruz is happy about that Stephen Miller is happy about that The Wall Street Journal and Viacom are angry that's a win that's all you need to know let all the other stuff go the Pro immigration wing of the Republican Party is upset voxcom the most disingenuous a lying left-wing rag on the internet other than Media Matters is upset and pretty rock-ribbed conservatives are happy that's a win best news of all is Jimmy Kimmel is crying again Jimmy Kimmel is crying again and yep there they are so good because it's also a day that ends and why he's crying again I hope you have your tumblers ready here is Jimmy Kimmel if one illegal immigrant causes a car accident we've got to build a wall to keep the rest of them out why are you looking for solutions to that problem and not this one every reasonable American Republican or Democrat knows that something has to be done something and we're not doing anything but go ahead I'll let you finish now let me explain it why why do we want to deport people who are breaking our laws is because they're breaking our laws and we're nation of laws and because the people of this country have a right to have their democratically enacted immigration law enforced and the people of this country have a right to determine who gets to come in and who gets to go out and who gets to use up their tax dollars in welfare and who gets to vote in their elections and who gets to do all of those things that's why we deport some people who are here illegally the reason that we don't take away all of their guns is it's a civil right we said we here let me try to explain it for Jimmy Kimmel we enforce the law and we also protect civil rights is that out may I'll slow it down for Jimmy Kimmel yeah I know I know he's the great intellectual of the modern left but we enforce the law and we protect civil rights I know it seems like a contradiction in terms it's a really perverse culture that demands comedian politicians and earnest comedians that's what we're getting here Kimmel wants something some action just give me something something what what do you want what you're like a little child you're behaving like a little baby boy but I want something why I need mama what do you want I don't know I just know something my man we shouldn't let them get away with this we should not let the left get away with this Jimmy Kimmel doesn't actually care he does not care about this if he cared he would propose a solution but he hasn't proposed a solution because he doesn't care every time Democrats demagogue this issue we should point out what they are that's what they that's what they're doing that's what they big don't care worse they're using dead kids as political props there's nothing nice or caring or genuine about what Jimmy Kimmel does he uses sick and dead kids night after night and crocodile tears as props to erode American liberty night after night after night don't we shouldn't let him get away with this it isn't oh he's just a little dummy oh that's it's really despicable what he's doing and we and we should call it out every chance we can finally I'll end on this because we're running a little late I should have paid more attention to my movement watch the New York Times conservative columnist prominent never Trump or Bret Stevens is calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment Bret Stevens writes quote they should want to change it fundamentally and permanently there was only one way to do this repeal the Second Amendment repealing the amendment may seem like political mission impossible today but in the era of same-sex marriage it's worth recalling that most great causes begin as improbable ones this should be a warning on the one hand it shows that we should trust our gut when it comes to squishes like you know we say oh well I don't know maybe it's a conservative ah he looks like a conservative if it looks like a squish and talks like a squish and sounds like a squish it's probably a squish treat it that way you know I don't say I'm gonna think you mean to these people or you know run them out I don't I'm happy to have a big tent party but let's not pretend that Bret Stevens is the standard bearer of conservatism as the New York Times I think would like to do that isn't they don't have any Pro Trump Republicans on their staff to my knowledge he Bret Stevens is right about gay marriage we've been talking about gay marriage a little bit in the last couple weeks and the redefinition and the language issue of this you know he obviously I don't think this is like a cause like civil rights or the abolition of slavery but our modern does he calls it a great cause because our culture all our culture cares about these days is sex and assaulting language and maybe sexually assaulting language in pattern in Hollywood at least who knows it sounds that sounds about right we should be careful to keep our priorities in order we have to keep our priorities in order when we see these things we see the the Republican can the conservative at the New York Times you know say that we need to repeal the Second Amendment there remain conservatives today who will not vote to real like Donald Trump because he uses naughty language and doesn't belong to the same lunch clubs that they do that's what they have that so it's so uncouth but what about what about the dignity of the presidency I like the dignity of the presidency too I long for a day when we have Abraham Lincoln giving the Gettysburg Address you know night after night that would be very nice and uplifting I suppose we have to protect our Liberty we have to protect our Liberty and there people out there who on the left and ostensibly on the right who are trying to repeal fundamental civil rights in this country Hillary Clinton campaigned on it she campaigned especially on gutting the First Amendment and gutting the Second Amendment repealing the Second Amendment weakening the Second Amendment don't get caught up in the lunch clubs don't get caught up in oh but it's uncouth oh it doesn't you know the Donald Trump tweet it doesn't go well with my Chardonnay forget that drink the leftist tears it's much more delicious anyway you've got to keep your priorities in order and you've got to make sure that our primary goal is to protect Liberty here to protect the American Way and to defend it and don't get caught up in all of the other stuff that's all abstract that's all some we can think about it we can think about it some other day maybe in a time when our Liberty is less under threat or we have other options available to us we can prioritize that but today we have our priorities it's protection of Liberty and we've got to keep it away from crying acts like Jimmy Kimmel okay that's our show doesn't have as a fun Friday show we should do more Friday shows I will be
