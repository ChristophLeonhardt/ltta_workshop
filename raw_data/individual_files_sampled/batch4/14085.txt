we've been hearing about superhero movie fatigue for years the heroes on rasoi well Marvel released its latest installment venom and it crashed onto the big screen in hopes of finding dozens of human hosts to watch it so will this prediction of hero fatigue come to pass or is it more like the predictions of manmade catastrophic climate change where it's just kicked down the road every year so like we promised guys it's gonna happen I'm talking to you Al Gore but did it happen this time let's find out I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood Tom Hardy's venom had many media outlets on pins and needles wondering if superhero movie fatigue was actually gonna set in well didn't happen and it's not true and I'll tell you why also venom broke the October box-office records here's the thing the superhero genre is just like any movie you get tired of bad movies not good movies every movie you watch there is a hero whether he has a cape or superpowers you follow that person and you care about him as long as it's a good story you're gonna like it we have bad movie and political fatigue not good movie superhero movie whatever but let's get into it as a viewer I give venom a four out of five and let's just be real we all just wanted to see one of the top five actors in the past 20 years put on a CGI alien super crazy freak suit and fight other crazy monsters and that's what we got for some of the movie you basically have to watch Tom Hardy act circles around the entire cast and forget about them and the plot because the best part of this movie is literally Tom Hardy talking to Tom Hardy because he plays the venom voice as well and that is the only interesting dialogue parts of this entire movie now the action sequences are good and the CGI is fantastic but it really drags in the beginning of this movie because we just want to see venema it takes literally like 45 minutes for those two characters to come together and then you're like oh finally let's watch as a critic I give Enemy 3 out of 5 the movie itself was a mess the plot was just so chopped who things added it was frustrating because what worked worked Tom Hardy fighting with a dark alien mirror version of his own personality while they then buddy-cop their way through conflict romance and action all of that works really well but because it's 2018 that was more like a blip and they had side-characters with their own moral conflicts to try to slow down the movie to a crawl I mean literally in an interview Tom Hardy said the best 30 to 40 minutes of the movie were cut out I guess to make time for all this other stupid nonsense it doesn't do anything no I'm not kidding and literally this is the second time this has happened the reason why the bad guy is doing what he's doing is because of course the world is being destroyed by manmade climate change and it's gonna be over in like 25 years they say it like oh yeah we know yeah we were done in one generation we're done and of course in the first half of the movie were subject to a brilliant female protagonist who stands up to the man and then you're like wait why is she even here because she's the catalyst to bring Tom Hardy's character to this facility when he's been a reporter in his entire life and was gonna do that in the first place you're like why do we spend so much time with this character and then she dies we waste like 35 minutes doing nothing here it's also this scene that was so clearly added where the bad guy Drake is talking to a group of kids gave me a speech about how the facility works in this African American girl speaks out and interrupts and while he's talking everyone's like Shh don't do that he's talking he's like no no come here little girl don't let anyone silence your voice we need leaders like you like we also need civility people who show manners and are courteous to other people right right right but no no just interrupt people whenever you want because it's time my faith in values is a three out of five now in this movie Eddie Brock is a freelance reporter he's not paid off any mainstream outlets he goes out and seeks the truth and that's what's great about him he's not just speaking up for people no he's speaking truth for people who would normally never hear it and it's also interesting because venom kills people in this movie which I don't mind except there's a lot of unjustified kills in this movie and the best part of this movie is that Eddie Brock and venom both are willing to sacrifice themselves for others the people they care about either their friendships the romance or just the world in general anyway if you want a fun CGI ride once you get past this stupid first 35 minutes this movie it's pretty great I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content in the entire rebel lineup you
