1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,110
THERE IS A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC
THAT GETS TO ENJOY THEIR UP

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,110
SESSION WITH GUNS WITHOUT ANY
TYPE OF CRITICISM, SO.

3
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,110
LET'S MOVE ON TO AN INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT STORY THAT I

4
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,110
REALLY WANT TO SHINE SOME LIGHT
ON.

5
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,110
*****************************************************************************************
THE ACLU RECENTLY DID AN

6
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,110
INVESTIGATION INTO THE NUMBER OF

7
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,389
AMERICANS WHO ACTUALLY GET SENT
TO JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR.

8
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,259
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BEEN DEALING

9
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,470
WITH FINANCIAL EMERGENCY, MAYBE
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND AS A

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,260
RESULT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY
CERTAIN DEBTS AND SO COLLECTORS

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,170
HAVE FOUND A SNEAKY WAY TO
CIRCUMVENT THE LAWS AGAINST

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,070
DEBTORS PRISONS IN ORDER TO FIND
A WAY TO IMPRISON THESE PEOPLE

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,620
UNTIL THEY PAY BACK THAT MONEY.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,750
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS ON
THIS AND THE INTERCEPT DID

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:50,930
AN EXCELLENT JOB IN REPORTING
IT.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,930
SO WHAT THEY DO IS THE
COLLECTORS WILL TAKE THESE

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,700
DEBTORS TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THE

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,870
JUDGE WILL RULE IN THE
COLLECTORS FAVOR MEANING THAT

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,770
THE PERSON WHO OWES THE DEBT
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,330
RULING INDICATING THAT THEY HAVE
TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK BUT

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,070
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE POOR?

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,390
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE
TO PAY THAT MONEY BACK?

23
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,590
OFTENTIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY
WILL NOT GET THE NOTIFICATION

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,070
NECESSARY TO SHOW UP TO ONE OF
THE COURT HEARINGS AND WHEN THAT

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,391
HAPPENS, THERE IS A WARRANT OUT
FOR THEIR ARREST AND THEY

26
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:27,390
ARE THROWN INTO JAIL.

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,910
USUALLY THE JUDGE WILL DECIDE TO
SET THE CASH BAIL AMOUNT AT

28
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,770
THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THAT
INDIVIDUAL OWES TO THE

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,140
COLLECTOR AND THEN AS SOON AS
THE PERSON, IF THEY ARE

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,800
ABLE TO PAY THAT BAIL AMOUNT
PAYS IT, THE JUDGE THEN

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,850
HANDS THE MONEY OVER TO THE
COLLECTION AGENCY.

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,630
SO WE OUTLAWED DEBTORS
PRISONS IN AMERICA IN 1833, SO

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,490
ALMOST 200 YEARS AGO WE THOUGHT
IT WAS SUCH A BARBARIC

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,049
PRACTICE THAT WE SAID YOU ARE
NOT ALLOWED TO DO IT ANYMORE.

35
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,850
NOW WE HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK INTO
DIFFERENT WAYS.

36
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,590
NUMBER ONE, IF YOU OH THE
GOVERNMENT MONEY, SO FOR

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,950
EXAMPLE FOR A TRAFFIC TICKET
THEY GO WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

38
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,090
YOU ARE NOT OWING IT TO A
PRIVATE CITIZEN, TO

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,520
GOVERNMENTS OF YOU DON'T PAY
THAT WE CAN PUT YOU IN PRESENT.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,490
NOW THERE ARE SO MANY FINES AND
PANEL SEASON LEVIES BECAUSE IT

41
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,489
IS A REGRESSIVE FORM OF
TAXATION, THEY CUT TAXES ON THE

42
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,950
CORPORATIONS AND THE RICH, THEY
HAVE TO GET IT FROM SOMEWHERE SO

43
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,770
THEY INCREASE PARKING METER
VIOLATIONS AND STUFF BUT

44
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,209
YOU ARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT A 39
JAIL.

45
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,080
THE SECOND WAY THEY HAVE DONE IS
WHAT IS BEING OUTLINED HERE

46
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,712
AND IT IS A REALLY INTERESTING
LOOPHOLE THAT THEY CREATED.

47
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:40,620
IF YOU OWE MONEY TO, LET'S MAKE
UP AN ABSURD CASE.

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,629
MCDONALDS, IT'S A PRIVATE
CORPORATION, THEY CAN'T PUT YOU

49
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,629
IN

50
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,440
PRISON BECAUSE HE DID NOT PAY
FOR YOUR BIG MAC BUT WHAT THEY

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,440
CAN DO AND SO ONE OF THESE CASES
IS ACTUALLY JARED KUSHNER'S

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,349
FAMILY THAT OWNS THE APARTMENT
BUILDING AND THEY ARE DOING

53
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,360
THIS TO ABOUT 100 PEOPLE WHO ARE
LATE ON THEIR RENT.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,240
OKAY, THEY DO NOT PAY THEIR
RENT, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
KICK

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
THEM OUT, ETC.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
WE ARE NOT ARGUING ABOUT THAT.

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,440
THEY SAY YOU OWE ME MONEY SO I
CANNOT PUT YOU IN PRISON FOR

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,489
THAT, I'M HAVING TROUBLE
COLLECTING IT SO INSTEAD I AM

60
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,920
GOING TO START A CIVIL
PROCEEDING AGAINST YOU, NOT

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,459
CRIMINAL BUT IF YOU DO NOT SHOW
UP AND THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS

62
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,489
MOST IN MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT STILL BE

63
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,300
IN THE HOSPITAL OR YOU MIGHT BE
IN A DIFFERENT STATE BEING

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,730
TREATED AND THEY GO, AND A LOT
OF TIMES THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO

65
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,600
SHOW UP SO THEY MAIL IT TO YOU
RIGHT AWAY, COUPLE OF NOTICES.

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,050
YOU DO NOT SHOW THE COURT THEN
THEY GO, HEY, MISTER JUDGE,

67
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,330
CAN YOU GIVE ME A WARRANT FOR
THEIR ARREST BECAUSE THEY

68
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,459
DID NOT SHOW UP TO COURT.

69
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,569
THAT IS CALLED CONTEMPT OF
COURT.

70
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,459
THE JUDGES ARE IN ON IT
UNFORTUNATELY.

71
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,840
THAT IS WHY THEY DO WHAT
ANNA SAID, YOU OH $2300

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,420
AND THEY SAID THE BAIL AT WINK
$2300 AND AS SOON AS YOU

73
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,000
GIVE THE BELL MONEY THEY GIVE IT
OVER TO THE COMPANY.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,780
IF YOU HAD THE $2300 ADDITIONAL
WRONG BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE

75
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,330
DEBTORS PRISONS BUT MOST OF THE
PEOPLE HERE DO NOT HAVE THE

76
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,510
MONEY, THAT IS WHEN THEY DID NOT
PAY IT OR SOME OF THEM DON'T

77
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,250
EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT AND THEY
CANNOT FOR THE BAIL SO IF

78
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,080
YOU ARE RICH, NO PROBLEM.

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,810
YOU CAN AFFORD THE BILL, YOU'RE
DONE.

80
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,220
MIDDLE-CLASS, MOST OF YOUR
ALBRIGHT.

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,298
IF YOU ARE POOR, THAT IS IT,
YOU ARE ROTTING AWAY IN A

82
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,468
DEBTORS PRISON.

83
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,759
AND IF YOU ARE POOR YOU DON'T
HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,449
DEFEND YOURSELF SO FOR INSTANCE
IF YOU ARE NOT PROPERLY NOTIFIED

85
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,569
BY THE COURTS OR THE COLLECTION
AGENCY THAT IS GOING AFTER

86
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:33,770
YOU HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIGHT
BACK?

87
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,189
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE YOUR
CASE THAT YOU DID NOT GET

88
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,319
THE PROPER NOTIFICATION.

89
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,919
IF YOU ARE POOR YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT,

90
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,759
THAT REQUIRES A LAWYER AND A
VERY EXPENSIVE LEGAL

91
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,909
PROCESS SO I WANTED TO PROFILE A
COUPLE OF THE STORIES THAT

92
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,909
REALLY STOOD OUT TO ME.

93
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,969
THESE ARE SPECIFIC PEOPLE WHO
WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS

94
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,000
AND WHAT I'M ABOUT TO READ
SPEAKS TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,319
PEOPLE WHO HAD MEDICAL
EMERGENCIES AND WHILE THEY

96
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,030
WERE GETTING THE TREATMENT THAT
THEY NEEDED, THE NOTICES

97
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,169
WERE SENT AND THEN AS SOON AS
THEY COME HOME, THEY ARE

98
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,309
SERVED WITH WARRANTS AND A
HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.

99
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:21,159
LET'S GO TO GRAPHIC 43.

100
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:31,719
SO SHE RETURNS HOME AND SHE IS
LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON?

101
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,480
AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
PAID YOUR MEDICAL BILLS, THERE

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,039
ARE THREE WARRENTS FOR YOUR
ARREST.

103
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,039
DOESN'T

104
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,949
MATTER THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING
FROM SICKNESS AND

105
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,639
SHE WAS GETTING THE TREATMENT
THAT SHE NEEDED, THEY DIDN'T

106
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,639
CARE.

107
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,590
AND SHE DIDN'T BREAK ANY
LAWS.

108
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,590
EXACTLY.

109
00:05:46,590 --> 00:06:06,779
NEXT CASE:

110
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,009
YOU CANNOT GARNISH GOVERNMENT
BENEFITS LIKE SOCIAL

111
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:14,080
SECURITY, SO THE COLLECTORS AND
THEY COME FOR YOU, THEY TAKE THE

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,870
SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY YOU MIGHT
NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN YOURSELF.

113
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,520
THAT IS WITHOUT LOGS IT BUT NOW,
SINCE THEY CAN ARREST YOU,

114
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,409
THEY USE THAT THREAT OF ARREST
TO GET YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY

115
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,749
MONEY ANYWAY AND IN THAT CASE,
IT IS A PERSON WHO IS

116
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:32,081
PARTICULARLY NOT ABLE TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEY

117
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,139
INTIMIDATE AND THREATEN, ETC.

118
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,779
THERE IS AN ATTORNEY IN TEXAS
WHO RUNS A COLLECTIONS 101

119
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,849
COURSE AND IN THAT COURSE, HE
TEACHES IN A HANDBOOK ENTITLED,

120
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,669
IT'S EASIER TO SETTLE WHEN THE
DEBTOR IS UNDER ARREST.

121
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,970
THIS IS NOTHING THERE UNAWARE
OF.

122
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,089
THEY KNOW WHEN THEY USE IT TO
THEIR ADVANTAGE.

123
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,679
THE COURT SYSTEM KNOWS IT BUT IT
HELPS THEM CRUSH POOR PEOPLE

124
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:02,849
ANYWAY AND JENNIFER TURNER FROM
THE ACLU MADE A GREAT POINT

125
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:03,849
SIMILAR TO WHAT ANA WAS SAYING.

126
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,179
SHE SAYS IT IS LARGELY AN
INVISIBLE PROBLEM BECAUSE

127
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:11,710
THE PEOPLE IT AFFECTS DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY FOR LAWYERS.

128
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,469
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR
PR.

129
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,129
OF COURSE NOT SO NOBODY EVER
FINDS OUT ABOUT IT AND THAT

130
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:22,740
IS WHY THEY PICK ON THE
POWERLESS, BECAUSE IT IS EASIER.

131
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,779
THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY MEANS TO
FIGHT BACK SO IN SOME WAYS, THAT

132
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,770
WE'VE OUTLINES AND OTHER
STORIES, THE RICH GET RICHER AND

133
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,520
IN THIS CASE, THE POOR GET
POORER AND BY THAT IF YOU PUT

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,679
THEM IN JAIL, THEN THEY
OFTENTIMES GET FIRED AND THEN

135
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,899
THEY HAVE LESS MONEY AND KIDS
PIGGYBACK AND THEN THEY

136
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,459
HAVE TO SIT IN JAIL LONGER.

137
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,489
NOT ONLY DO THEY GET POORER BUT
THE POWERLESS GET EVEN MORE

138
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,559
CRUSHED BY THE SYSTEM.

139
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:50,339
AND IT'S REALLY A SYSTEM OF
SKIMMING PEOPLE AS MUCH AS

140
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,659
POSSIBLE BECAUSE EVERYONE, ALL
THE BAD ACTORS HERE ARE IN BED

141
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:57,270
TOGETHER AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT
IS NOT ONLY DO THEY THREATEN

142
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,529
THESE PEOPLE BY SAYING THERE
COULD BE A WARRANT OUT FOR

143
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,749
YOUR ARREST, THEY ENCOURAGE
THEM TO TAKE OUT LOANS FROM

144
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,239
PAYDAY LENDERS SO IT IS A
VICIOUS CYCLE.

145
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,240
WE ALL KNOW THAT AS SOON AS YOU
TAKE OUT THAT LOAN FROM

146
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,180
PAYDAY LENDERS THERE ALL SORTS
OF FEES AND HIGH INTEREST

147
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,069
RATES ATTACHED TO THAT LOAN AND
IT ESSENTIALLY DIGS THESE

148
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,219
PEOPLE INTO AN EVEN DEEPER
FINANCIAL HOLE AND IT IS

149
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:23,439
REALLY DEVASTATING TO SEE HOW
MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM THIS.

150
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,629
BY THE WAY, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES

151
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,959
ACCORDING TO THE ACLU DEAL WITH
THESE ARREST WARRANTS EVERY

152
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,919
SINGLE YEAR AND THE PROBLEM WILL
ONLY GET WORSE IF WE ALLOW

153
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,000
OUR POLITICIANS TO BE BOUGHT
BY THE SAME COLLECTIONS

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,121
AGENCIES AND PAYDAY LOAN LENDERS
THAT LOVE THE SYSTEM, SO

155
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:46,389
MICK MULVANEY, WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT US AS CONSUMERS

156
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,250
IS REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS.

157
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,269
HE HAS ALREADY SCRAPPED A PLAN
TOGETHER ADDITIONAL DATA ON

158
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,850
CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING OF DEBT
COLLECTION DISCLOSURES AND ALSO

159
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,850
KEEP IN

160
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:13,339
MIND THAT THESE INDUSTRIES ARE
DEEP 

161
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,779
IN HIS POCKET.

162
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,510
I WANT TO ADD ONE BIT OF CLARITY
TO THAT.

163
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,360
MULVANEY GOT MOVED OVER TO THE
CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUREAU.

164
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,270
THE TIME THEY WERE PLANNING TO
DO A CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT

165
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,270
YOU GUYS.

166
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,270
IT IS IN THEIR NAME.

167
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,959
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION
BUREAU SO THEY KNEW ABOUT

168
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,290
THIS PROBLEM AND IT WAS
ACTUALLY A RARE CASE FOR THE

169
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,600
GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO DO
SOMETHING POSITIVE.

170
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,870
MULVANEY, HAVING ALREADY TAKEN
MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB

171
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,800
IT IS TO COLLECT MONEY FROM YOU
AND PUT YOU IN PRISON SAID

172
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,940
OH, WHAT AN UNLUCKY BREAK FOR
YOU GUYS.

173
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,790
IT TURNS OUT I DECIDED YOU DO
NOT NEED PROTECTION.

174
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,810
I ALREADY GOT MY $3000.

175
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,360
THAT IS ALL IT TAKES.

176
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
THE MINUTE HE COMES IN

177
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,319
AND GOES NO, WE ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THAT PROTECTION ANYMORE.

178
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:02,110
KEEP ON PUTTING THEM IN
PRISON AND SQUEEZING THEM

179
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,300
FOR EVERY DOLLAR AND EVENTUALLY
GIVE ME A TINY LITTLE BIT OF

180
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,939
IT AND THAT IS ALL YOU NEED.

181
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,860
THE SICKNESS OF MONEY IN
POLITICS IS WHAT DRIVES SO

182
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,949
MUCH OF THIS.

183
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,079
WE ARE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE WE ARE
HOPING TO GO BACK TO THE

184
00:10:16,079 --> 00:00:00,000
GOOD OLD DAYS OF 1833.
