week or say something I've already

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,970
noticed about finishing so early in

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,620

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,510
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exams is the guilt I'm one of</font>

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,309
these people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels guilty little bit</font>

too much but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when your friends are still</font>

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,700
slaving over books and panicking about

revision and that sort of thing it does

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,199

for my first<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper day of post academia</font>

44
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,580
and in a moment of all these revelations

45
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,500
about myself I was having<font color="#CCCCCC"> coffee with my</font>

46
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,670
friend Hannah this morning as she asked

47
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">me what my plans were for after</font>

48
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">University the famous question when I</font>

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,040
told to a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my ideas especially for</font>

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,350
September onwards she kind of gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

51
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,579
impression I was selling myself short

52
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,560
and well my immediate reaction to that

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,030
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defensive and</font>

54
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,890
be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm trying really hard I so</font>

55
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,930
no it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for me to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bilbray</font>

of I'm happy to speak up in class and

59
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,520
you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not afraid to talk to</font>

60
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,490
shopkeepers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even random strangers to</font>

61
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,110
chat to them about their day on public

62
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,390
transport do this and that sort of thing

63
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,369
I've never had a problem with that kind

64
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,840
of confidence I'm definitely not that

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,670
confident in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own abilities as a</font>

66
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,000
person as kind of a marketable thing

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,860
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than self confidence in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

68
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,390
it's

69

lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence in my potential say</font>

70
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,870
