NEIL? Neil: I'M SURE THAT MIGHT COME UP IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS. WE SHALL SEE. NOW WE HAVE MULTIPLE PRIMARIES GOING ON IN FOUR KEY STATES. THE MOST CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED WILL BE IN WEST VIRGINIA. 14 HOURS UNTIL THE POLLS OPEN THERE. NOW THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING INVOLVED. PRESIDENT TRUMP URGING ONE CANDIDATE TO BE REJECTED.
