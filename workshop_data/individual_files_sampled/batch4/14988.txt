okay here we go you know it sounds like a great idea let's take a popular movie and make it a comedy you know Silence of the Lambs but with comedy a walk to remember with some slapstick or Schindler's List with some knee-slapping jokes yo you know it'd be even better let's recast Jesus and passion to Christ with Will Ferrell and tell him to really cut loose that sounds stupid well of course but not as stupid as taking the predator a horror thriller franchise and making it a comedy I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood the predator hit the big screen which is kind of confusing since it's the sixth movie in the franchise but they trying to copy the original title and boy do I miss that movie made in 1987 if you haven't seen the original predator stop this video and watch that instead and I mean look at that lineup who doesn't want to see these jacked heroes fight for the lives against some monster in the woods alright spoilers ahead this movie sucks plot spoilers are also ahead but you should keep on watching because if you ain't got time to bleed you also ain't got time to watch garbage movies as a viewer I'm gonna give the predator a 2 out of 5 and that is generous believe me I really debated giving any 1 out of 5 but there were some minor ly entertaining moments that I had to give it some props for even though almost nothing I mean nothing makes sense in this movie this movie does start off pretty entertaining you know a predator fleeing for his life from another predator we don't know why will we find out of course not you also see a rugged military sniper stuck in the woods with this monster chasing astrum it really feels like the original predator it's fun will the continue of course not because then the story starts the actors start to perform and instead of continuing that set up we turn to a band of murderous misfit people joking around way a monster tries to kill them for no reason as a film I'm gonna give this a 0 out of 5 I mean really when you watch this movie just to ask why why the entire time because they justify nothing in the movie because this was clearly a chopped-up script by some people who said yeah we have a script but let's uh add some stuff oh and tell jokes on every page like a Marvel movie but like what if that doesn't make any sense what is sense anyway oh so we have a predator running from another one so what happens in the story don't give a reason at all for that don't tell the backstory just have them bring some random Bionic suit to earth for literally No reason but why doesn't matter but does he team up with the humans you know like a defector coming back to have to protect himself for me in weird Alliance no no no no time for that just have him disembowel and murder people constantly be like here I brought gifts oh we also have a really cool girl who's brought in because she's an evolutionary biologist and she's gonna develop some bio weapon to fight these predators well no it's all about girl power let's have her grab a military grade weapon and cycle through automatic weapons and grenade launchers as she jumps on to a super predator for absolutely no reason but don't we have military guys everywhere it isn't she brought in because she's the scientist yeah but reasons oh and let's also have a random alien jog and they kill one of them and they shoot one in the back of the head thus lobotomizing it and have it stumble across the movie for over an hour doing nothing so at the very end it can bite one of the Predators and we can justify its reason for being there Oh could this movie get any worse wait here's an idea let's have the reason predators have to come to earth is because the humans are destroying it with global warming whoa wait it gets better instead of having people fight for their survival against a clear villain let's make it kind of ambiguous and have the American military just killing random people for no reason even though they're all gonna die guys like I'm not kidding there is literally as seen this movie where two dudes one guy being the dude from key and Peele and possibly his gay lover are bleeding dying out stuck into a tree and on the ground and they look longingly to each other's eyes before pulling out a gun and then pop each other right the dome killing themselves I was just hoping at that moment I could turn and lock eyes with another predator fan and we could do the same to put each other out of our own misery my faith in values is an absolute zero out of five this movie's a complete dumpster fire please go see the original made in 1987 it's way better I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
