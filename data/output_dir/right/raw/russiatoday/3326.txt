00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,810
grilled on this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,630
responded we followed these buses as

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> departed if an opportunities</font>

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,450
presented themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> to conduct strikes</font>

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,720
against any potential Isis fighters that

34
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">were had decided to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flee then we would</font>

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,790
did not present<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there were</font>

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,470
many civilians that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were part of that</font>

39
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">say that no Isis fighters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the</font>

40

cities and go somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else can you say</font>

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,810
that I can't say with a 100% certainty

42
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that every single fighter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was identified</font>

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming out of Raqqa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the question now</font>

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is where are these ISIL fighters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,110
they're no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Raqqa so where</font>

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">would they be heading towards well one</font>

potential place the nearest<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

48
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">they could flee to would be Turkey and</font>

49
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,110
the Turkish government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has voiced some</font>

50
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,700
serious concerns<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,069
that some have left ISIL terrorists

52
