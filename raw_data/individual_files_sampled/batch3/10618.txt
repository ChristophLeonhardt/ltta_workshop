almost a thousand people gathered at an anti migrant demonstration in the German city of chemnitz as right-wing sentiment continues to raise its head protesters held bottles at police who tried to disperse the crowd let's go live now to Artie's Pisa Oliver who's following the incident in Germany Peter good to see you can you tell us more about what prompted such scenes well yes this all happened after the stabbing to death of a 35 year old man in the early hours of Sunday morning this was after a fight that broke out between a group which includes what police have called foreigners this was after the city festival in communites that was taking place on Saturday was supposed to continue into Sunday but it was called off following this group that had gathered and rampage through the city and included apparently members of a far-right football hooligan outfit attached or loosely attached to the local football club but the the fight which left a 35 year old man dead also left to other people seriously wounded in hospital police have made two arrests in connection with the killing but it's prompted opposition politicians to come out and say that the incident shows that the police can't keep well can't keep the peace and can't keep citizens safe in Germany right now or particularly in that city of Kim Mnet's like Germany took in or has taken in over 1 million refugees and migrants since 2015 and how to correctly integrate them into society has proved problematic in fact the the most recent proposal that was put forward which would have involved a year's worth of community service for some refugees and in even in some cases that could see conscription into the military well that was dismissed by Angela Merkel as a viable option to use compulsory military service I've consulted with military chiefs they all say that the profession of soldier is not what it used to be and has changed Peter can you give us an idea of the feeling in Europe over the issue in general well it's not just in Germany that we've seen people speaking out on this recently we in France we've seen one member of the leading member of the Republican Party they're saying that the problem of integration was actually now becoming a fight for European identity how can we fail to realize that we have reached the limit as regards integration and that this mass immigration of today poses a cultural threat to European civilization but ultimately we're three years on over three years on now from the first major influx of refugees and migrants into Europe and we're still nowhere near finding a solution to how to integrate people as well as how to we'll have to take in people who are genuinely in need you
