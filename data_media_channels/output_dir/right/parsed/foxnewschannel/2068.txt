LELAND: SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR
DEMOCRATS IN THIS YEAR'S
PRIMARIES ARE AMONG THE MOST
PROGRESSIVE AND RECENT HISTORY.
THEY WORRY THE SAME POSITIONS
THAT MAKE THEM POPULAR NOW WILL
TURN TOXIC COME NOVEMBER.
WHEN WE WERE IN OHIO YESTERDAY,
FORMER BOMB ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL NOW RUNNING FOR
GOVERNOR SAID THE DIVIDE BETWEEN
REAGAN DEMOCRAT AND PROGRESSIVE
LIBERAL IS JUST A MEDIA FIX IT.
>> I DON'T THINK IT REPRESENTS
ANY REAL SPLIT PARTY.
BERNIE SANDERS HAS NOT MADE AN
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE
ALTHOUGH SENATOR WARREN HAS
ENDORSED ME.
>> HERE TO DISCUSS WAYS AT THE
BATTLE OF THE SEC GOING DOWN ON
A SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
ROBERT, TO YOU FIRST.
IS HE RIGHT THERE'S NOT A SPLIT
IN THIS IS JUST FICTION?
>> THERE IS A SPLIT BETWEEN THE
MODERATES IN THE PARTY COME THE
PEOPLE AROUND PARTY INTO THE
GROUND OVER THE LAST DECADE AND
PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE PARTY
WHICH IS THE FUTURE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
THINGS LIKE THE UNIVERSAL
GUARANTEED INCOME FROM
IMMIGRATION REFORM, ADDRESSING
POLICE BRUTALITY, WORKING
TOWARDS ISSUES THAT AFFECT YOUNG
PEOPLE, STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS
WILL DRIVE THE PARTY TO THE
FUTURE.
PEOPLE WHO RAN THE PARTY INTO
THE GROUND ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE
PAID ATTENTION ON THE NEW
PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE PARTY.
LELAND: ASSUMING THAT EXIST AS
ROBERT SAYS, WILL TAKE HIM AT
FACE VALUE.
HOW DO REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THAT?
>> IT'S REALLY A TOUGH BATTLE
RIGHT NOW AS YOU SAY IN THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS MOVING MY
LEFT.
REPUBLICAN PARTY MOVIE MARBURY.
A WIDE OPENING IN THE MIDDLE.
WAS ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
THAT I'M NOT SURE.
BUT JUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO
CONTINUES TO GO RIGHT IN MORE
RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO GO THAT
WAY THROUGH 2020.
AS 20.
HIS 20.
HIS FIRST 2018 GOES, NOT A LOT
OF EXPLOITING THE DEMOCRATS TO
THE RIGHT TO SUPPORT TRUMP AND
HIS PEOPLE.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIAL
ELECTION, IT WAS A DEMOCRAT
ESSENTIALLY RUNNING ALMOST AS A
MODERATE REPUBLICAN IF YOU
LISTEN TO AND WITH NANCY PELOSI
AND OTHERS THAT WON THE
ELECTION.
YOU MAY SAY PROGRESSIVES ARE THE
FUTURE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
BUT IS THAT A WINNING FUTURE?
>> IMAGIST INEPTITUDE BY THE
CLINTON CAMPAIGN THAT RESULTED
IN CAMPAIGN IN STATES WHERE THEY
NEEDED A MORE PROGRESSIVE
METHOD.
DISTRICT BY DISTRICT, WHAT WE
SEE IS PEOPLE ARE RUNNING ON A
BET THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A
DAILY IF NOT WEEKLY SCANDAL
GOING ON IN PUSHING OUT THEIR
BASE.
THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO PLAY BY
THE POLICY CLINTON STENY HOYER
PLAYBOOK IS A THING OF THE PAST.
THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY IS RIGHT
NOW.
>> AS WE LOOK FORWARD IN THE WAY
THIS IS SHAPING UP, AND IT IS
CLEAR HOW THE PRESIDENT IN THE
WHITE HOUSE WANT TO FRAME THE
SERVICES ABOUT THE ECONOMY.
YOU SAW THAT YESTERDAY WITH THE
PRESIDENT WAS IN OHIO FOR A
SMALL BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE.
HERE'S ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE
ROUNDTABLE.
>> WE CHOSE TO MOVE FORWARD.
WE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT FOR
SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS, DIDN'T
FEEL IT WAS THE RIGHT TIME THAT
WE SAW WITH YOUR STRONG
LEADERSHIP THAT NOW IS THE TIME
TO REINVEST IN OUR COMPANY.
>> OS DO THE SAME QUESTION I
ASKED IN THE POSTER UP A BIT
EARLIER.
THOSE FOLKS ON STAGE CERTAINLY
SEEM TO CREDIT THE PRESIDENT.
AS WE WENT THROUGH OHIO, PEOPLE
SAID THE ECONOMY IS DOING
BETTER.
THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY GIVE THE
CREDIT TO THE PRESIDENT.
HOW DO REPUBLICANS WIN THE
ARGUMENT IN 28 TEAM?
>> THE BIGGEST FOR REPUBLICANS
IN 2018 AS THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT
WHAT TRUMP HAD DONE AND WHAT
TRUMP CAN DO IT WITH HIM IN THE
WHITE HOUSE, HOW IS THE ECONOMY
TURNED?
EVEN IF IT'S NOT HIM
SPECIFICALLY, HE'S BEEN IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
JOB NUMBERS ARE AT.
MORE MONEY IN PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS
GOING UP.
FOR THOSE THAT MAY NOT TALK
ABOUT, THEY LOOK UP MONEY IN
THEIR PAYCHECKS.
FOR THOSE THAT LIKE PRESIDENT
TRUMP, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT
HAVE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE THE
VOTER NUMBERS ARE NOT AS HIGH IN
A MIDTERM ELECTION LIKE THEY
WILL BE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL AND
THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THOSE
THAT SAY WE ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP
SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY THINK
THEY HAVE TO DEFEND HIM FROM THE
MEDIA, THE LEFT SIDE.
>> CERTAINLY AS YOU LOOK AT THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEAL, A RACE
OF WHO CAN BE MORE TRUMP, WHO
CAN WRAP THEMSELVES AS A
REPUBLICAN MORE IN THE FLAG OF
CHARM.
ROBERT QUESTION TO YOU.
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.
EVERYONE WE TALKED TO IN OHIO
SAYS THE ECONOMY IS DOING GREAT.
HOW DO DEMOCRATS DO ANYTHING
OTHER THAN SAY THANK YOU,
PRESIDENT TRUMP?
HOW DO YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE
ECONOMY WHEN THINGS ARE DOING
WELL?
>> THESE NUMBERS WOULD FORCE
EVERYONE TO RUN FOR THE MIDDLE.
THE PROBLEM IS THE PRESIDENT HAD
SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS ON A DAILY
AND WEEKLY BALLOTS.
DEMOCRATS RUN ON RESTORING
FAMILY VALUES TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
THEY RUN ON THE FUTURE OF THE
COUNTRY NOT BE IN A SITUATION
WHERE TALK ABOUT STARS IN
EVERYDAY RESTORING THE
PRESIDENCY PEOPLE CAN BE PROUD
OF.
LELAND: GENTLEMEN, APPRECIATE
IT.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
