in on the latest issues surrounding the questions that were apparently asked of Donald Trump I think there's a couple of super important things there first of all it always bothers me that the powerful get to play by different rules so if you were under federal investigation do you think the FBI would send you their questions ahead of time and let you craft the answers let your team of lawyers craft the answers ahead of time hell no they'd bring you in for questioning that spring all those questions on you and you'd be in a world of trouble so Donald Trump is getting special treatment I get it he's the president but it sucks that the president gets to be treated it in a way that an average citizen would never ever get so he's actually getting biased treatment on his behalf in his favor although you could never tell from all this crying but that's not what I mainly wanted to talk about the main thing is Donald Trump had a weird reaction to the Muller question so if you haven't seen them the New York Times leaked all the questions that special counsel Robert Muller is asking Donald Trump so they had already given it to Trump most people think the Trump team leaked them and there's logic behind that Muller wouldn't want those questions out there but Trump then had an interesting reaction to it on Twitter he said see no questions about collusion and everybody looking at the questions we're like what do you mean there's a ton of questions about collusion they asked about how the famous Trump Tower meeting where Don jr. and Kushner and mana fort were at and and then they asked about the mana fort and whether he cooperated with the Russians they asked about Mike Flynn and whether he talked about the Russians so there was actually a lot of questions about collusion so why did Trump say that there were none he read the same questions the reason is in his mind the real collusion is money laundering and there weren't any questions about money laundering so I was like oh thank god they're just talking about collusion during the campaign which is no big deal they're just talking about whether we talk to the Russian and got the emails during the campaign I don't care about that at all I also ride that in his second obstruction of justice I'll survive that in a second they haven't really gotten to the beef which is the decades of money laundering that Trump has been doing for the Russians you will see that I'm absolutely right about that and that's why Trump today is breathing a sign of relief and kind of doing a little bit of an endzone dance because he thinks haha they're not onto the real issue the real issue is oven criminal and I've been a criminal for a long long time and that's why he's beholden to the Russians there's a hint of a question about Felix seder and a deal that they were gonna do in Moscow but the reality is that's not the big deal it's not the Trump was gonna build something in Russia that's the issue it's all the properties of the Russian oligarchs bought in the United States through Donald Trump and how they launder their money so I hope that Muller is hiding the ball and that's what he's actually going after and that he didn't ask the questions about that on purpose so the Trump is not tipped off to it or the other scenario is he's not really going there in which case that's a disaster because I think about other charges are weaker and I think he should get to the heart of the matter I hope he's spring in a bear trap on him but for right now it looks like those questions are not related to what I think is essence of the issue and obviously based on his reaction what Donald Trump thinks is the essence of the investigation which is the money laundering stupid so by God if Muller Steve is not looking into it turn around and go in that direction that's much more fruitful and much more damaging to our democracy if he's literally financially beholden to the Russians but we'll find out because they're getting closer and closer and once you start at least asking questions the president for better or for worse we are beginning to come to the near of the end so we'll see come well what he comes up with an investigation but that's your answer for why Trump appears to be relieved for the moment being
