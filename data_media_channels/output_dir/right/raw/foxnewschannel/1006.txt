1
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,062
TOTAL ANNIHILATION STEPPED

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:04,963
OUT OF BOUNDS.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:05,731
WATCH THIS.

4
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:08,233
>> THEY WILL BE MET WITH

5
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:11,103
FIRE, FURY, AND FRANKLY

6
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:12,137
POWER, THE LIKES OF WHICH

7
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,841
THIS WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN

8
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,174
BEFORE.

9
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:17,876
>> ROCKET MAN IS ON A

10
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:20,178
SUICIDE MISSION FOR HIMSELF.

11
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:21,346
AND FOR HIS REGIME.

12
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:24,683
>> DO NOT UNDER ESTIMATE US.

13
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:29,688
AND DO NOT TRY US.

14
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:31,557
>> Tucker: WELL, THAT WAS

15
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,258
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO

16
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:33,659
REMARKABLY.

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,227
HOW DO WE GET FROM THAT TO

18
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:35,961
WHAT WE ARE WATCHING RIGHT

19
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,462
NOW ON OUR SCREEN.

20
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:38,597
BYRON YORK HAS COVERED ALL

21
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,899
OF THEM.

22
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,967
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AT

23
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:42,701
THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER AND

24
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:45,604
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

25
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:46,738
BYRON, REVERSE ENGINEERING

26
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,340
THE LONG ROAD FROM THERE TO

27
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,274
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

28
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:50,442
HOW MUCH OF THIS WAS

29
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:50,842
INTENTIONAL?

30
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,045
HOW MUCH OF THIS UNFOLDED AS

31
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:54,513
A PLAN OR A STRATEGY ON THE

32
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,347
PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION?

33
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,049
>> WELL, THERE WAS A

34
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,350
STRATEGY TO DO SOMETHING

35
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,617
NEW.

36
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,618
I MEAN, THIS IS SO

37
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,053
EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE IT IS

38
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:03,422
A PRESIDENT TRYING SOMETHING

39
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:03,689
NEW.

40
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,290
DONALD TRUMP IS CRITICIZED

41
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,592
FOR VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING HE

42
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:07,326
DOES.

43
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:09,094
BUT HE HAS BEEN PERHAPS

44
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,128
CRITICIZED A LITTLE LESS FOR

45
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:10,462
THIS.

46
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,863
BECAUSE NORTH KOREA IS A

47
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,198
PROBLEM THAT NO PRESIDENT

48
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,467
HAS BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

49
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:18,136
EVER BEFORE ANYWAY.

50
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,406
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE 2016

51
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:24,543
CAMPAIGN FOR ALL THE TIME

52
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,243
THAT NORTH KOREA NORTH KOREA

53
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,278
HAS TAKEN IN TRUMP

54
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:27,279
PRESIDENCY IT, WASN'T REALLY

55
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,715
A HUGE THING IN THE

56
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,082
CAMPAIGN.

57
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:31,650
WASN'T A BIG THING IN THE

58
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,085
G.O.P. PRIMARY DEBATE NOR IN

59
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,886
THE GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE.

60
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,955
AND I THINK THAT WHAT TRUMP

61
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,024
IS DOING HERE IS SOMETHING

62
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:42,628
SO NEW BECAUSE.

63
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:43,996
HE WOULD CRITICIZE AND

64
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:46,531
PLEDGE TO DO UNDO WHAT A

65
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:51,236
PREVIOUS PRESIDENT HAS DONE

66
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:58,310
NOT ENGAGE.

67
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,411
ENFORCE THAT IDEA?

68
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,714
WHY WILL FIND OUT.

69
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:03,482
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WILLING

70
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,516
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT

71
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:07,252
THAN HIS PREDECESSORS.

72
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,253
>> VERY QUICKLY, SINCE YOU

73
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,422
ARE PART OF THE PRESS BUT

74
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,790
YOU ALSO WATCH CAREFULLY.

75
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,991
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

76
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,026
NEWS COVERAGE OF THIS?

77
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,095
>> WELL, I THINK THAT AS I

78
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,231
SAID BEFORE, I THINK IT'S

79
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:20,432
BEEN A LITTLE LESS NEGATIVE

80
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,933
THAN A LOT OF OTHER TRUMP

81
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,734
THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS A

82
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:25,003
POSSIBILITY THIS COULD WORK.

83
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:26,071
AND SO WHILE THERE IS A LOT

84
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:28,540
OF SORT OF A NATURAL

85
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,308
TENDENCY TO POO POO WHAT

86
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:31,376
TRUMP DOES, THIS ACTUALLY

87
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:31,943
MIGHT WORK.

88
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,345
I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF IT

89
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:34,746
HAS GROTON CAUGHT UP IN THE

90
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:37,983
COVERAGE OF THE G-7 COVERAGE

91
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:39,351
AND WHICH HE HAD A LOT OF

92
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,252
HIS COMMENTATORS SUGGESTING

93
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,620
THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO

94
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,655
DESTROY THE WESTERN ALLIANCE

95
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:46,391
AND THEN THUS GOES WEAKENED

96
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,192
IN TO SINGAPORE.

97
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,326
BUT GENERALLY I THINK IN THE

98
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:50,062
LEAD UP TO THIS, WHILE THERE

99
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:51,763
WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF.

100
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,031
SO THINGS YOU JUST PLAYED

101
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:53,832
DONALD TRUMP SAYING THIS

102
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:55,367
ROCKET MAN AND THE FIRE AND

103
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,435
FURY STUFF, A LOT OF

104
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,804
CRITICISM OF WHAT HE DID

105
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,237
THERE.

106
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:00,172
WHEN THIS ACTUALLY CAME TO

107
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,540
THE IDEA OF AN ACTUAL

108
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:01,873
SUMMIT.

109
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:02,607
I THINK PEOPLE ARE WAITING

110
00:03:02,607 --> 00:00:00,000
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
