and thank you at home for joining us this hour happy to have you with us where do you want to start tonight the prospect that we're about to shoot more missiles at Syria right after the president said he wanted us to have nothing to do with the war in Syria anymore we could start there there's also the fact that the president literally said today get ready Russia that's a quote get ready Russia as he was apparently preparing his plans to shoot missiles into Syria where Russia is the major organized military power on the ground the president says get ready Russia as in here they come you guys ready got everything moved out of the way do you need any more time you good to go this enough notice get ready Russia so we could start there tonight we could start tonight with the x-rated report about alleged sexual abuse and violence by Missouri's Republican governor that report just released tonight by the Missouri state legislature and that governor still believes there is no need for him to step down we can start there we could start with yet more senior officials leaving the Trump administration or we could start with the previously fired senior White House official who's now been brought back and installed on the president's orders at the Justice Department we could start there we could we could start with the next new scoop that we've got on the Moller investigation following our report last night on Dana Bente and James Comey there is a lot going on my fine-feathered friends I'm very glad that you're here there's a lot to get through oh and also the Speaker of the House third in line to the presidency resigned today or at least he announced that he is leaving he will not be running for re-election ho-hum normal Wednesday these are wednesdays in our life now the Republican Party has held the House of Representatives since the beginning of 2011 they won the chamber in the 2010 midterms the big tea party wave that was one of the biggest partisan swings in the house in modern American history the Republicans picked up 63 seats in that first midterm after President Obama was elected in the 2010 midterms and when you when you win a majority even if it's just a small majority you of course get to take control of all the committees in the house you don't just get the leadership of the House at large all the committees that had previously been shared by Democrats those Democratic chairs had to hand over their gavels to new Republican chairs and and when that sort of transition happens it is a feeding frenzy in Washington it is power-play writ large there's lots of jockeying among members of Congress for the best jobs often the chairmanships are won by senior members of the House people who've been around for a long time and have made a lot of friends and doled out a lot of favors they have a lot of kits to cash in with their colleagues but when the Republicans took over the house with that big big win in in in 2011 2010 midterms they're all getting sworn in in 2011 the Republican member of Congress who managed to snag the best chairmanship of all the the chairmanship of the Budget Committee best gig in Congress the person who would be responsible for crafting the Republicans economic alternative to President Obama's proposals that guy was a pretty young guy just 40 years old at the time not one of these old Lions of Congress who'd been you know raising money for all his or her colleagues for decades it's this 40-year old guy who got that plum job not because he'd been around forever and had lots of favors to trade but because he was seen as such a quality he was seen as such an up-and-comer and specifically he had a really detailed really specific plan he said that he had the plan for the Republican Party to finally get American debt and deficits under control because he knew how to do it you put him in charge he would do it his reason for living was to cut the debt it was what he dreamed about it was what he lived for it was his life's work it was all he cared about it was definitely one thing that he knew how to do better than anybody else and he had dreamy blue eyes and he looked awesome alongside blown up charts and graphs the facts are very very clear the United States is heading toward a debt crisis the only solutions will be truly painful for us all that doesn't have to be our future the way we respond to this challenge will ultimately define our generation we can choose a path to prosperity let's take a look at how we can do it our debt as a share of the economy is already too high but look at where it's going these are actually pretty conservative estimates here's what would happen under our proposed budget what we're calling the path to prosperity as you can see we won't come anywhere close to the tipping point and we'll pay off the debt over time the House Republicans budget man called for dramatic cuts and changes we put the nation on the path to actually pay off our national debt 41 year old Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan is going big compared to the White House budget laid out in February the Republican plan over the next decade would cut government spending by 6 trillion dollars reduced the federal deficit by four point four trillion compared to the President's budget according to the Congressional Budget Office Budget Chairman Congressman Paul Ryan champion of urgent deep cuts a 40-year old congressional rebel with a cause and Jon Karl spent the day with him he's been given more power over the federal budget than anybody in Congress Paul Ryan the Republican with the budget ax 23 million he's a little like the guy in the movie Dave the accidental president who sets out to fix the budget line-by-line that's another 47 million so this is good we're doing good but in the movie Dave only has to find 650 million dollars in savings Ryan wants to cut several trillion over the next 10 years I mean how do you go in here and how do you find the kind of savings you want to find and how how do you reason these things since I was 22 years old you literally go through it line by line directly this is perfect so direct loans lesson I knew spending an autopilot that has no congressional oversight and it gave the illusion that they were cutting spending that's the Paul Ryan party trick that he does with reporters okay you have smudge it to any page all falls find you wasteful spending to cut on any any page oh look look at this one you know you thought you're burping the alphabet routine was good right or that thing you do at the chewing tobacco lid no no no try opening the budget boom I'd kill that I mean yes there were party poopers out there who pointed out that in that example and that televised interview that one random thing Paul Ryan happened to pull out of the budget at random as an example of wasteful spending that thing it's actually something that saved the US government billions and billions and billions of dollars so cutting it would cost billions of dollars but still the idea that he had some sort of budget magic that he was budget magic personified it was so exciting you just didn't want to reveal how the trick was done or that it didn't work you just wanted to believe in the magic the beltway really wanted to believe in the magic however you felt about Paul Ryan's actual grasp of actual numbers by the very next year that plan of his that he had unveiled was such orthodoxy for Republicans and he was seen as such a serious policy guy by the mainstream press that the following year 2012 Republicans basically by consensus chose Paul Ryan as their vice presidential candidate to run with Mitt Romney because yes dreamy blue eyes and youthful fitness looked great alongside Mitt Romney but also policy right he had that very very serious plan he was the policy guy in choosing Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate Mitt Romney has instantly remade his presidential campaign congressman Ryan the energetic chairman of the House Budget Committee is the Republican master of all aspects of federal spending and he comes complete with his own detailed conservative fiscal plan to remake the role of the federal government in everything from Medicare and Medicaid to tax policy and agriculture subsidies in naming congressman Ryan governor romney has transformed the presidential campaign into an ideological battle ideological battle because republicans have picked they called him the republican master of all aspects of federal spending there's a conservative activist named Grover Norquist who's an anti-tax Crusader he said at the time that Republicans didn't actually even need Mitt Romney as a presidential candidate didn't matter who was at the top of the ticket all they needed was that magic plan from the Republican master of all aspects of federal spending Paul Ryan Grover Norquist said at the time quote we want the Ryan budget pick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become President of the United States all we want is Paul Ryan's magic plan well Paul Ryan did not become vice president in that campaign that he and Mitt Romney lost in 2012 but while Mitt Romney sort of disappeared for a while it's now trying to just make his political comeback now Paul Ryan kept rollin and he ended up becoming Speaker of the House in 2015 and again the prevailing view was this meant that the Republican Party would now be led by mr. policy by the most capable most devoted policy wonk in all the land the man whose reason for living was to reduce deficits and the debt and boy does he know how to do it once he was speaker Paul Ryan started releasing these odd but sort of exciting videos about himself as Speaker at the time that they made people think that maybe he was running for president in 2016 or maybe he just liked having videos of himself out there with soaring music and the sound of people applauding him reassuring it would be if we we fix the tax code put patients in charge of their health care grew our economy strengthened our military lifted people out of poverty and pay down our debt the cynics will scoff they'll say it's not possible scoffing cynics who don't believe we will pay down our debt don't you know that Paul Ryan has been working on this since he was 22 he has the plan he's going to bring down the date he's gonna do all those things the debt will disappear this is this is who Paul Ryan is in American politics and he's an important figure in American politics but this is the founding mythology of Paul Ryan over his 20 years in Congress and at the beginning of last year his party finally took control of the White House and the Senate and the house where he isn't charged and he has a huge majority in the house he can do what he wants and with that full control they have enacted some of Paul Ryan's policies that he has been campaigning for for 20 years he's finally seen his fiscal plans come into existence two days ago we got the mathematical fiscal assessment of the result of those policies the deficit is now going to shoot past a trillion dollars by 2020 as a share of the American economy the deficit is gonna reach levels not seen since the economic collapse of 2008 before that the last time deficits were this big was World War two because we were paying for a world war at the time the debt is going to rise thirteen trillion dollars in the next ten years that report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that came out two days ago then this was this morning today I am announcing that this year will be my last one as a member of the house to be clear I am NOT resigning I intend to fool my serve term as I was elected to do but I will be retiring in January leaving this majority in good hands with what I believe is a very bright future I have accomplished much of what I came here to do which part you may or may not care about the debt and deficit some people care a lot about it some people don't care about it at all but getting rid of the debt in the deficit that is the origin story of why Paul Ryan exists in American politics and and and why he's third in line to the presidency after the President and the Vice President it's him it's why he was put in charge of the budget for the Republicans and why they ran him for vice-president with Mitt Romney and why they made him Speaker of the House he will get rid of the debt and then than what he did with the power that they gave him once he got to enact his magic plan is that he's gonna add 13 trillion dollars to the dead and and Paul Ryan apparently looked at that report that came out on Monday afternoon and thought well my work here is done I'm pretty much done what I've I mean again you may or may not care about that as a policy issue but the it's I think it's this is a if we're never gonna look at this if we're ever gonna look at this this is the time the beltway myth of Paul Ryan which we have all been living through over the course of his political ascendance these past few years the Beltway myth of Paul Ryan is the opposite of what Paul Ryan did which should make us examine our myths whatever you think of congressman Ryan speaker Ryan whether you bought into the myth in the first place or not it is inescapably true that he did the opposite he failed that achieving the goals that he set for himself from day one and that everybody cheered him on as being capable of achieving as a Republican party leader he did the opposite and now he's leaving saying he's pretty much done with what he wanted to do he will be the second Republican House Speaker to quit in the space of three years his predecessor John Boehner stepped down in October 2015 John Boehner supposed Congress life has seems kind of Awesome actually from what we know about it it has mostly been him golfing and giving occasional interviews about how relieved he is to not be in terrible Congress anymore he has occasionally sent out dispatches from his RV on the open road he wears shorts when he drives it's been kind of a low-profile retirement for the last Republican Speaker of the House who quit but today turned out to be a really awkward day for everybody in the Beltway media to suddenly turn around and say hey I wonder what John Boehner is up to right now we're having another House Speaker quit what happened to the last one today ended up being a very awkward day for everybody to suddenly start wondering about John Boehner again because early this morning hours before anybody knew that Paul Ryan was going to announce that he too was leaving John Boehner announced very early on Twitter today that he was joining the board of a weed company like a marijuana company john boehner former republican speaker the house chose this morning to come out of the closet as a brand new proponent of legal pot quote i am joining the board of acreage holdings because my thinking on cannabis has evolved okay i mean we all know john boehner as a proud cigarettes and red wine guy this is new when john boehner shared his evolution his marijuana evolution in that tweet before 7:00 a.m. this morning i'm sure he didn't think it was going to be part of every single story about the biggest news in american politics today but there you have it something for paul ryan to look forward to now that he's retiring to spend more time probably becoming a lobbyist i mean i would pay money to see them hi together at some point that will probably happen but it is it is no mystery why paul ryan might have wanting why he wanted it to get out of the way of the november elections this year that tea party wave in 2010 in the first election after obama was elected president that was the the the the wave election that made paul ryan budget chair that was very big some of the people who watch these kind of trends for a living they think this year could bring a democratic wave that is even bigger than what we saw in 2010 even if you don't believe that hype and it is still a long way out before the election it's already clear that it's gonna be at least a sort of rough year for republicans in election after election over the last few months from state legislative seats to governorships even to the US senate democrats have been doing way better than they did in 2016 or in some cases better than they've done in many election cycles going back many years Democrats have won upset victories and traditionally conservative places hello Alabama there have been a number of instances where Democrats have still lost in very conservative places but the percentage swing toward Democrats in those elections has nevertheless been huge just yesterday we kind of had a couple of specials a a Democrat won a Florida Senate race state Senate race she won her race by a fifty point margin and yeah that's a democratic district in Florida so maybe not surprising that a Democrat won but Hillary Clinton crushed that district in 2016 Hillary Clinton won that district by 25 points this is a 25 point swing further toward the Democrats in that race yesterday a 50 point margin also yesterday there was another special in Iowa in Iowa a Republican won a state Senate seat in in a very red district but that Republican won by fourteen fewer points than Trump had won that district in 2016 so it's a fourteen point swing and Democrats direction even in a even in a race they could still hold on to these kind of swings are real and we have been seeing them for well over a year now and if they persist even at a fraction of what we're seeing now they will make it very hard for Republicans this November not to mention the fact that every Republican America will be running with Donald Trump as their Party standard bearer maybe Paul Ryan could have been the standard bearer before he quit but it's gonna be Donald Trump and that will doubtless help some Republicans in some places that really love Donald Trump at the rate things are going right now though it is hard to imagine what amount and what manner of scandal and legal peril may be hanging over Trump on his administration by the time voters are actually going to the polls and voting in November we just learned today that as of last week the Russia Legal Defense Fund for the Trump campaign staffers and Trump administration staffers is open for business and taking donations so maybe that could be kind of a joint election message maybe that could be like hey you vote for me or if you don't have time to go out and vote please could you contribute to the Russia legal defense happy election season GOP we'll be right back hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks
