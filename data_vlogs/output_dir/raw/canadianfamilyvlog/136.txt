<font color="#E5E5E5">some research on it and I was like oh</font>

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,950
this is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these solutions to these</font>

107
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,600
pregnancy problems seem like they're

108
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,210
easily easily solved but the trick of it

109
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,620
is sometimes you read a solution or

110
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,850
something you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple let's</font>

111
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,230
just do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and promise off but it</font>

112
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,580
actually doesn't really solve the

113
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,080
problem as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vicki</font>

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
the reason why women<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pregnant and</font>

115
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,620
not men what does not even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

116
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,620
with it seem like a big deal right yeah

117
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,990
yes yeah big he knows if I was pregnant

118
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,370

119
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,170
stay in bed every day all day I think I

120
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,090
can't move there's a new sore my body

121
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,720
