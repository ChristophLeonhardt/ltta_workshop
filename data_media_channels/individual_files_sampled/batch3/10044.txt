usually what happens with mysteries is the answers get revealed crimes are solved perpetrators are identified in the scrap pile case what's interesting is we seem to be going in Reverse for research activities or protection you would need for instance five to ten grams or so but even in Solsbury it looks like they may have used more than that without knowing the exact quantity I'm told it may be 50 100 grams or so which goes beyond research activities for protection it also stretches the realms of reality here's some perspective one drop of a nova chalk nerve agent is enough to kill roughly 10 people 100 grams the equivalent of a small glass would be enough to wipe out at least a neighborhood kill thousands and thousands any serious chemists familiar with nerve agents will tell you as much nova truck is supposed to be very toxic highly toxic five to eight times more toxic than than VX which is already very very toxic what's interesting is how the head of the world's chemical weapons watchdog could possibly make such a mistake perhaps that was a mistake the OPCW didn't take long - shall we say clarify the OPCW would not be able to estimate or determine the amount of the nerve agent that was used in Salisbury on the 4th of March 2018 the quantity should probably be characterized in milligrams fair enough they miscalculated a slight exaggeration of about a hundred thousand fold but ok remember when Russia protested the accusation that only eight could make Nova chalks no one took them seriously in fact the accusers were offended by the very idea the Russians crossed all boundaries when they said the Nova jock agent could have come from the Czech Republic that is a lie fake news right so imagine the Czech foreign ministers face when the president then comes out and says this bill una novia choke was produced and tested in the Czech Republic it was a small quantity though we know when and we know where it was done it would be hypocritical to pretend that such a thing never happened remarkable just to think Britain was so sure it was all solely singularly exclusively Russia is highly likely that Russia was responsible we do hold Russia culpable culpable culpable for the attempted murder you argue that their source of Naveed shock is Russia how did you manage to find it out so quickly can I look at the evidence I mean the people from from Portland on they were absolutely categorical and I asked the guy myself I said are you sure and he said that there's no doubt only Russia it could only have come from Russia said the guy over there - Boris Johnson hundred percent guaranteed go-ahead sanction Russia you can probably guess what happened next is a pattern here we have not verified the precise source to be clear you're not able at Porton down to say where it is from we haven't yet been able to do that so much backtracking it might as well be back running yet the media hits the breaking news pedal over any scandalous statement no matter how unsubstantiated and every time those statements turn out to be untrue no one cares staying tuned only for the next sensational revelation award-winning journalist and filmmaker John Pilger is the guest on today's edition of going underground he says it's crucial for the media to question the official narrative I've never known a time when so-called as you describe it mainstream surely a a satirical term mainstream journalism has been so integrated into a propaganda barrage and that that propaganda campaign at the moment pointed right against Russia suggests to me that it's the beginning of a kind of nother march on Russia I've been a journalist for a long time I've covered many Wars I've covered the first cold war I've covered it from the Soviet Union I've covered it from the United States I would say there is a pseudo journalism now to simply write down and swallow what governments tell you is the very antithesis of what real journalism is
