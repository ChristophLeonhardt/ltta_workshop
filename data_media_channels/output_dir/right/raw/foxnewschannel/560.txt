1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,484
>> I BELIEVE HER.

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,819
TO BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY IN

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,021
THE UNITED STATES SENATE

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:11,389
AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS BEING

5
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,557
NOMINATED TO ONE OF THE MOST

6
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,358
POWERFUL POSITIONS IN THE

7
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:15,626
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,

8
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:16,561
THAT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY

9
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,361
AMOUNT OF COURAGE.

10
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:20,531
>> NOT ONLY DO WOMEN, LIKE

11
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,766
DR. FORD WHO BRAVELY COMES

12
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,201
FORWARD NEED TO BE HEARD,

13
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,035
BUT THEY NEED TO BE

14
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:24,402
BELIEVED.

15
00:00:24,402 --> 00:00:26,003
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE

16
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,005
MEN OF THIS COUNTRY JUST

17
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,140
SHUT UP AND STEP UP.

18
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,107
DO THE RIGHT THING.

19
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:33,845
>> I BELIEVE DR. FORD.

20
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:35,613
I BELIEVE THE SURVIVOR HERE.

21
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:36,481
>> I BELIEVE HER.

22
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,248
I STAND WITH HER.

23
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:39,584
>> I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD.

24
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:44,055
I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE.

25
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:44,622
ANNA: HAVEN'T HAD THE

26
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:46,357
HEARING YET.

27
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:47,458
STEVE: PROMINENT DEMOCRATS

28
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,793
TALKING ABOUT THE ACCUSER OF

29
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:49,927

STATES YOU ARE IN TOWN FOR

35
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:57,435
THE UNITED NATIONS.

36
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:00,371
>> GOOD TO SEE NEW REAL

37
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,139
LIFE.

38
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,241
KELLYANNE'S SWEEPER NOT

39
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,543
BEHIND US STEVE SO QUIET IN

00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:05,910
HERE.

41
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,078
BRIAN: NO ONE MOWING THE

42
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:07,579
LAWN.

43
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:08,146
STEVE: REGARDING THE

44
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:11,049
ACCUSERS AND THE CAMPAIGN

45
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:11,783
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

46
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,818
SHE DESCRIBED IT AS A VAST

47
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:14,486
LEFT WING CONSPIRACY.

48
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:15,253
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ONE?

49
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:16,621
>> I THINK THE PROCESS THAT

50
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:17,789
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PLAYED

51
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:18,957
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY

52
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:21,359
APPALLING AND DISGUSTING.

53
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,927
EVEN IN THE ACCUSER'S LETTER

54
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,195
YESTERDAY TO SENATOR

55
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,398
GRASSLEY, SHE SAID SHE

56
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:27,532
WANTED TO DO THIS PRIVATELY

57
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,801
AND SHE REACHED OUT FOR THAT

58
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:30,135
PURPOSE.

59
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:31,636
BUT, BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS

60
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:33,538
WANTED TO PLAY 11TH HOUR

61
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:34,773
POLITICAL GAMES, THEY WAITED

62
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:35,673
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.

63
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:39,611
THEY HAVE MADE THIS A HUGE

64
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:42,080
PUBLIC CIRCUS AND FRANKLY

65
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,148
HURT TWO DIFFERENT FAMILIES'

66
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:43,949
LIVES THAT THEY WILL NEVER

67
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,450
BE ABLE TO BE THE SAME

68
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,217
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY

69
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:47,452
HAVE OPERATED THIS PROCESS

70
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,087
AND I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING

71
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,690
THAT THEY HAVE EXPLOITED

72
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,924
THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR

73
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:53,858
FAMILIES FOR THEIR OWN

74
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,627
POLITICAL PURPOSES.

75
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:56,895
BRIAN: WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE ON

76
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:57,829
MARCH THAT'S INTERVIEW LAST

77
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,130
NIGHT AND WHAT WENT INTO THE

78
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,098
DECISION TO DO THAT

79
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:02,233
INTERVIEW BECAUSE THIS WHOLE

80
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,168
PROCESS HAS BEEN UNIQUE.

81
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,602
THAT WAS A VERY TOUGH

82
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,004
DECISION I IMAGINE FROM

83
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:06,471
COMMUNICATIONS.

84
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,372
>> I THINK WE HAVE BEEN VERY

85
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,708
CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING.

86
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,408
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS WANTED

87
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,978
TO COME OUT AND TELL HIS

88
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:13,345
STORY.

89
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:14,012
BRIAN: HE HAS BEEN TELLING

90
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:14,379
YOU THAT?

91
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:16,515
>> I MEAN, HE SAID IT IN

92
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,550
EVERY LETTER, EVERY

93
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,452
EXCHANGE, EVERY STATEMENT

94
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:21,720
THAT HE IS WILLING AND READY

95
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,921
TO COME AND ANSWER

96
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,656
QUESTIONS, HARD QUESTIONS,

97
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:25,257
UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS

98
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,459
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN VERY

99
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,864
CONSISTENT FROM DAY ONE AND

100
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:32,865
UNEQUIVOCAL IN HIS DENIAL

101
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:33,899
THAT ANYTHING EVER TOOK

102
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:34,199
PLACE.

103
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,802
I FIND IT TO BE A GOOD

104
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,203
PLATFORM THAT HE WAS ABLE TO

105
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:39,371
COME OUT AND TO SHARE HIS

106
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,039
SIDE OF THE STORY BECAUSE,

107
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,940
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL AND AS

108
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,442
FAR AS I REMEMBER IN

109
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:44,309
AMERICA, YOU ARE STILL

110
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,310
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN

111
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,744
GUILTY.

112
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:47,646
BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

113
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:48,647
CALLING HIM GUILTY FROM DAY

114
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:50,216
ONE BEFORE THEY EVER EVEN

115
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:51,517
TALKED TO HIM.

116
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,018
THEY SET THROUGH HOURS OF

117
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,086
HEARINGS, NEVER BROUGHT IT

118
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:54,353
UP.

119
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:55,688
NEVER TALKED TO HIM IN

120
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:56,755
PRIVATE MEETINGS AND WAITED

121
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:57,857
UNTIL THE LAST ANYONE TO

122
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:59,658
START THROWING OUT SOME

123
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:01,060
OUTRAGEOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT

124
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,628
HAVE NO CORROBORATION WHICH

125
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,130
I FIND REALLY TERRIBLE.

126
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,665
ANNA: A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND

127
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:07,400
THE TIMING CURIOUS.

128
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,068
WE DO WANT OUR VIEWERS TO BE

129
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,169
ABLE TO HEAR WHAT JUDGE

130
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,737
KAVANAUGH HAD TO SAY DENYING

131
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,105
THE ACCUSATIONS TALKING TO

132
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:15,608
MARTHA MACCALLUM ON "THE

133
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:15,941
STORY."

134
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,044
>> IN AMERICA, WE HAVE

135
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,111
FAIRNESS, WE HEAR FROM BOTH

136
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:19,412
SIDES.

137
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:22,415
A FAIR PROCESS AT A MINIMUM,

138
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,151
AT A BEAR MINIMUM REQUIRES

139
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,186
HEARING FROM BOTH SIDES

140
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,755
BEFORE RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

141
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,090
PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HAD TOO

142
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,658
MANY BEERS ON OCCASION AND

143
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:33,592
PEOPLE GENERALLY IN HIGH

144
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:34,593
SCHOOL, I THINK ALL OF US

145
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:35,728
HAVE DONE THINGS WE LOOK

146
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,964
BACK ON IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

147
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,132
REGRET OR CRINGE A BIT.

148
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:40,966
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

149
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:41,567
TALKING ABOUT.

150
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:42,735
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN

151
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:43,903
ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL

152
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:44,236
ASSAULT.

153
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,205
I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY

154
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:46,906
ASSAULTED ANYONE.

155
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:48,874
I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED WOMEN

156
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:50,943
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

157
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:51,877
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO

158
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,512
HAVE KNOWN ME BEST FOR MY

159
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:53,913
WHOLE LIFE.

160
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:55,114
THE WOMEN WHO HAVE KNOWN ME

161
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:56,482
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

162
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,451
THE 65 WHO OVERNIGHT SIGNED

163
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,019
A LETTER FROM HIGH SCHOOL

164
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,420
SAYING I ALWAYS TREATED THEM

165
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,489
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

166
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,190
STEVE: "THE WASHINGTON POST"

167
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,324
SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT

168
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:05,858
CALLED MR. KAVANAUGH

169
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,326
YESTERDAY TO WISH HIM GOOD

170
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:07,793
LUCK ON THAT.

171
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,829
"THE WASHINGTON POST" ALSO

172
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:10,696
SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

173
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:12,565
BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE

174
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,334
PACE AT WHICH THIS HAS BEEN

175
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,402
PROGRESSING IN THE SENATE ON

176
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:17,903
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND HE

177
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,572
SAYS THAT CHUCK GRASSLEY AND

178
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:21,373
MITCH MCCONNELL, ACCORD ING

179
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,241
TO "THE WASHINGTON POST HAVE

180
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,509
BEEN TOO ACCOMMODATING.

181
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,510
SAID THE REPUBLICANS HAVE

182
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,078
BEEN TOO EASILY MANIPULATED

183
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:27,279
BY THE DEMOCRATS, AND HE IS

184
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,948
SICK OF FORD'S ATTORNEYS

185
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:30,082
GETTING THEIR WAY AND DOES

186
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:31,651
NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

187
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:32,785
ACCUSATIONS ARE CREDIBLE.

188
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:35,421
>> YOU KNOW I LIKE TO NOT

189
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:36,155
USE "THE WASHINGTON POST" AS

190
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,189
MY SOURCE.

191
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,591
BUT, LOOK, THE PRESIDENT

192
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:41,060
WANTS THIS PROCESS TO COME

193
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,328
TO A VOTE.

194
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:43,863
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S

195
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,164
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN EVERY

196
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,432
SINGLE ONE OF THESE

197
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,934
INSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE IS

198
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:48,301
NOMINATED.

199
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:49,135
THEY GO BEFORE.

200
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,403
THEY HAVE A HEARING AND THEN

201
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:51,637
THE SENATORS VOTE ON IT

202
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:52,772
THAT'S WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO

203
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,006
HAPPEN.

204
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:54,640
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

205
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,208
EXPECTS TO HAPPEN.

206
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,643
HE HAS NOMINATED SOMEBODY.

207
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:58,711
SENATORS HAD AMPLE TIME TO

208
00:04:58,711 --> 00:04:59,412
QUESTION HIM.

209
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:00,646
HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO COME

210
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:03,883
BACK AND ANSWER THESE NEW

211
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,351
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

212
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:05,852
BROUGHT FORWARD.

213
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,186
AND HE WANTS A CHANCE TO BE

214
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,254
ABLE TO DO THAT SO THAT THE

215
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,689
SENATE CAN MAKE A DECISION.

216
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,023
I DO THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO

217
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,825
CONTINUE TO DRAG THE PROCESS

218
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,294
OUT AND CONTINUE TO PUT GOOD

219
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:16,929
PEOPLE THROUGH THE RINGER

220
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,564
FOR THE SAKE OF POLITICAL

221
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:19,165
GAMES THAT THE DEMOCRATS

222
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:20,700
WANT TO PLAY.

223
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,300
BRIAN: I KNOW "THE

224
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,935
WASHINGTON POST" AND WE GET

225
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,638
THE -- SOME OF THE PRESS

226
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:26,906
BRIEFINGS TELEVISED AT FOX

227
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,307
SO I'M ABLE TO WATCH THEM.

228
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,709
I KNOW THERE IS SOME TENSION

229
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,410
IN THE "THE WASHINGTON POST"

230
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,110
AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

231
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,744
"THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD

232
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:32,945
THIS STORY THAT SAID THAT

233
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:33,613
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

234
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,514
WAS CONSIDERING WEARING A

235
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:35,515
WIRE TO TAPE THE PRESIDENT

236
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:37,751
IN ORDER TO GET PROOF THAT

237
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:43,556
HE COULD ENACT THE 25TH

238
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,391
AMENDMENT.

239
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,359
ESSENTIALLY TOSSING THE

240
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,060
PRESIDENT OUT OF OFFICE.

241
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,928
DOES HE BELIEVE THE DEPUTY

242
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:49,896
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SEMI

243
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:51,498
DENIALS AND WHAT WILL THAT

244
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:52,699
DO FOR THURSDAY'S MEETING?

245
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,033
>> I THINK THAT'S A PART OF

246
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:54,734
THE CONVERSATION THAT WILL

247
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:57,570
TAKE PLACE ON THURSDAY I'M

248
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,905
NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF A

249
00:05:58,905 --> 00:05:59,539
CONVERSATION THAT HASN'T

250
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,340
HAPPENED YET.

251
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,543
THE PRESIDENT AND ROD

252
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:04,277
ROSENSTEIN HAD A BEGINNING

253
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,712
OF THAT CONVERSATION BY

254
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:06,813
PHONE YESTERDAY.

255
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,248
BOTH AGREED IT WAS BEST TO

256
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,783
SIT DOWN AND HAVE THAT

257
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,985
FURTHER AND LONGER AND MORE

258
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,920
EXTENDED CONVERSATION IN

259
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,320
PERSON.

260
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,221
BRIAN: WHAT WAS YESTERDAY?

261
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,623
>> IT WAS CONFUSING.

262
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:17,857
>> GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

263
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,493
JOHN KELLY IS THERE.

264
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:21,861
>> YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT WORK

265
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:22,662
IN THE ADMINISTRATION DO GO

266
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,097
TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRETTY

267
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:24,497
FREQUENTLY.

268
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:25,565
THAT'S NOT LIKE GROUND

269
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,132
BREAKING NEWS.

270
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:29,302
IN FACT, ROD ROSENSTEIN WAS

271
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:30,470
THERE A COUPLE TIMES LAST

272
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,037
WEEK, TOO.

273
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:31,971
IT SHOULDN'T PUT EVERYONE

274
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,573
INTO A TAIL SPIN WHEN

275
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:34,607
SOMEBODY THAT WORKS FOR THE

276
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:35,608
ADMINISTRATION SHOWS UP AND

277
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:41,815
COMES TO THE BUILDING IN

278
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,316
WHICH THEY WORK FOR.

279
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,718
BRIAN: WAS IT A BIG NONSTORY

280
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,319
FOR YOU OR WAS THERE SOME

281
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,554
PERIL IN HIS APPEARANCE?

282
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,222
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET

283
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:49,890
AHEAD OF THE CONVERSATION

284
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,624
THAT HE AND THE PRESIDENT

285
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:51,691
ARE GOING TO HAVE ON

286
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,058
THURSDAY.

287
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:52,792
OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT HAS

288
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,161
BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY A

289
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:56,196
NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT HAVE

290
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:57,364
TAKEN PLACE AT THE

291
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:58,064
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

292
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:01,001
AND HE WANTS SOME ANSWERS TO

293
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:01,701
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

294
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,169
HE HAS.

295
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,503
SOME OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH

296
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,504
ROD ROSENSTEIN.

297
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:05,639
SOME OF THEM HAVE NOTHING TO

298
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,473
DO WITH HIM.

299
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:07,474
BUT IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF

300
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:12,245
JUSTICE AND IT SHOULD WORK

301
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:16,783
TO ACTUALLY FIX AND HOLD UP

302
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:18,051
LAW AND ORDER NOT UNDERMINE

303
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,086
LAW AND ORDER AND THE

304
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:21,021
PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE SURE

305
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:21,588
THAT'S HAPPENING.

306
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:22,289
ANNA: FOLLOWING THIS MEETING

307
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,523
ON THURSDAY IF ROSENSTEIN

308
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:24,925
DECIDES TO RESIGN OR

309
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,560
RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES,

310
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,327
WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S NEXT

311
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:27,628
MOVE.

312
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:29,763
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO

313
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:30,364
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION.

314
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:30,998
WE WILL SEE HOW THURSDAY

315
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:32,299
GOES AND I WILL LET THE

316
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,433
PRESIDENT MAKE THAT

317
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:33,967
DETERMINATION.

318
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,102
STEVE: ONE OF PRESIDENT'S

319
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,070
ATTORNEYS JAY SEKULOW SAID

320
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,639
YESTERDAY THAT IF ROSENSTEIN

321
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,873
LEAVES ESSENTIALLY THE

322
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:40,807
MUELLER PROBABLY SHOULD BE

323
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,543
PUT ON PAUSE FOR A LITTLE

324
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:47,214
WHILE TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A

325
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,582
REVIEW AND STEP BACK AND SEE

326
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:49,483
WHERE WE'RE ON THE STAGE.

327
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,185
>> I WOULD PROBABLY GO A

328
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:51,618
STEP FURTHER.

329
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,619
>> THE MUELLER PROBABLY

330
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:53,387
SHOULD END.

331
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:54,555
THEY SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF

332
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:55,789
AND FOUND NOTHING BECAUSE

333
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:56,824
THERE WAS NOTHING.

334
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:57,358
THERE IS NOTHING.

335
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:58,659
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

336
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,593
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

337
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,996
READY FOR THIS TO WRAP UP.

338
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:03,364
WE HAVE SEEN ABSOLUTELY NO

339
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:04,298
SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT THE

340
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,433
PRESIDENT OR ANYBODY ON HIS

341
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,203
TEAM HAD ANY WRONGDOING?

342
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:10,104
N. THE CAMPAIGN.

343
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,305
I THINK IT'S TIME TO WRAP

344
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:12,806
THIS UP AND MOVE FORWARD.

345
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:13,774
BRIAN: I THINK THE WHOLE

346
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,109
COUNTRY WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT

347
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:16,543
BRAND UP NO MATTER WHERE YOU

348
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:17,945
STAND AND HOW VOTED FOR.

349
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:18,779
TODAY THE PRESIDENT GIVES

350
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,247
HIS SECOND AADDRESS TO THE

351
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:21,048
UNITED NATIONS.

352
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:22,783
I IMAGINE NO ROCKET MAN

353
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,250
REFERENCES.

354
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,620
STEVE: YOU NEVER KNOW YOU

355
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,621
NEVER KNOW.

356
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,723
HOW CLOSE IS ROCKET MAN TO A

357
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:30,624
SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN

358
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,826
AGAIN AND NUMBER TWO, HOW

359
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:33,059
HARD WILL HE BE ON IRAN?

360
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,428
>> I CERTAINLY THERE HAS

361
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:37,097
BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

362
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,164
PROGRESS IN JUST A SHORT

363
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,000
AMOUNT OF TIME WITH NORTH

364
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,601
KOREA.

365
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:41,235
YOU REFERENCED THE SPEECH

366
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:41,869
LAST YEAR.

367
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,736
THINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT

368
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,105
AT THIS POINT A YEAR AGO

369
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:45,940
WITH NORTH KOREA.

370
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,841
TENSION WAS HIGH.

371
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,375
BUT, DUE TOUT LEADERSHIP OF

372
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,744
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE HAVE

373
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:53,748
SEEN A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF

374
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:54,849
THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE

375
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:57,017
FIRST SUMMIT WENT VERY WELL

376
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:58,252
AND THE COMMUNICATIONS OVER

377
00:08:58,252 --> 00:08:59,587
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

378
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,721
HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG AND

379
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:04,125
VERY POSITIVE FROM NORTH

380
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,627
THE

381
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:03,924
TEE

382
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:06,661
KOREA.

383
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:07,628
TESTING HAVE STOPPED.

384
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:08,596
REMAINS HAVE COME HOME.

385
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,097
EVERY DAY THE PROGRESS

386
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:11,098
CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD.

387
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,166
WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE

388
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,434
THAT IS AND WE EXPECT A

389
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,202
SECOND MEETING TO TAKE PLACE

390
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:15,569

391
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:19,707
BRIAN: WOULD IT BE HERE OR

392
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,443
THE GALLOPIS ISLAND.

393
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:23,344
>> THE CONVERSATION HASN'T

394
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:23,811

395
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:24,879
THE CONVERSATIONS TO SET

396
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,247

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,685
SHORT ORDER.

399
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:31,652
ANNA: WILL THE PRESIDENT

400
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,354

401
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:34,322
AGENDA TODAY.

402
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,590
>> THE POINTS HE MADE LAST

403
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,391
YEAR AND MADE IT EVERY DAY

404
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,860
SINCE TAKING WAS CERTAINLY

405
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,894
AMERICA FIRST BUT NOT

406
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:40,361
AMERICA ALONE.

407
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:41,796
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK

408
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:42,530

409
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,464
I THINK YOU HAVE SEEN THE

00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:44,599
PRESIDENT DO THAT A LOT.

411
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,800
I THINK YESTERDAY WAS A

412
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,235
TREMENDOUS EXAMPLE OF THE

413
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,636
PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP ON

414
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:49,170
FULL DISPLAY.

415
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,838
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO GET

416
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:51,873
BETTER TRADE DEALS AND HE

417
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:54,675
HAS DONE EXACTLY THAT

418
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:55,877
MONUMENTAL MOMENT TO SEAT

419
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:57,979
TWO LEADERS PUFTD PEN TO

420
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,881
PAPER AND REALLY CHANGE THE

421
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,616
COURSE OF TRADE AGREEMENTS

422
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:02,683
AND SET THE STANDARD OF WHAT

423
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,085
THIS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO

424
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,553
DEMAND OUT OF THE

425
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,187
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN

426
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:07,555
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

427
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:08,823
BRIAN: WHY DIDN'T HE MEET

428
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:10,759

429
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,628

430
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:14,062

STEVE: DIDN'T MEET WITH

00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:18,466
CANADA.

435
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,200
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT

436
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,235
WAS EVER ACTUALLY SUPPOSED

437
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,771
TO BE ON THE SCHEDULE FOR

438
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,205
YESTERDAY.

439
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,639
THE PRESIDENT HAD

440
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,340
WALL-TO-WALL MEETINGS AND

441
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,641

00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,377
LAST NIGHT.

444
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,746
AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED

445
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,649
IF THEY DON'T SPEND SOME

446
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,117
TIME OVER THE COURSE OF THE

447
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:39,421
NEXT FEW DAYS.

448
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,956
CRAZIER THINGS HAVE

BOURBON CHOCOLATE PECAN PIE.

457

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,205
BOURBON COOKS OUT SO FEEL

459
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:58,040

ANNA: WHO MAKES THE CRUST
