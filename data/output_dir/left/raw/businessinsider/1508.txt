00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,500
ago was Julian Assange right um this was

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,029
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it was back when he was first</font>

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,220
arrested in the UK i went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit him</font>

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,860
in England when he was still free on

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,769
bail met him and his<font color="#CCCCCC"> lawyers office he</font>

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,550
was not yet seeking asylum but we were

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,710
obviously worried primarily about what

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,000
would happen if you were extradited to

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,340
the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stand trial here</font>

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,840
and I took the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> because for me it</font>

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Pentagon Papers case</font>

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,380
Assange was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York Times in the</font>

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Washington Post the person who gave him</font>

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information was like Daniel Ellsberg</font>

16
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,290
or a Snowden I think you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a</font>

17
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,210
sharp distinction between the thief who

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,739
engaged in civil disobedience you may

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,600
support that thief but they have

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">committed a crime and the publisher</font>

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">Assange the New York Times The</font>

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,910
Washington Post they've committed no

23
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,129
crime they've acted consistent with the

24
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,960
First Amendment to publish material that

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,340
was given to them it seems the US

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,420
government ultimately took that position

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,730
too well we don't know we don't know we

28
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,440
don't know whether there is a sealed

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,059
indictment we don't know whether there's

30
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a subpoena against them we don't know</font>

31
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,199
whether he could safely<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the</font>

32
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,060
United States these are all unknowns

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,740
what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made of his more recent</font>

34
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,630
activity I haven't liked it I have not

35
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,010
liked it I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you not</font>

36
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,659
withstanding the fact that I represented

37
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,220
him I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Assad should be</font>

38
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,479
interfering with an American<font color="#CCCCCC"> election</font>

39
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,330
and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me he's in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

40
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,299
one-sided way trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hurt Hillary</font>

41
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,130
Clinton that hurts his credibility hurts

42
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,680
the credibility of WikiLeaks and it

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,189
should not be permissible to interfere I

44
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,570
don't mean legally I mean morally

45
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,759
permissible<font color="#E5E5E5"> did interfere with an</font>

46
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,860
American<font color="#CCCCCC"> election do you do you think</font>

47
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,390
that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in some way an agent of the</font>

48
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,619
Russian government no I don't believe

49
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh first of all be very difficult</font>

50
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,570
to that to be arranged I mean there is

51
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,659
it in an embassy I don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

52
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,579
think he's an independent guy I think he

53
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,420
has strong views about things but I

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,759
think he's acting in what he thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best interest of WikiLeaks I just</font>

56
00:01:55,619 --> 00:00:00,000
disagree with him
