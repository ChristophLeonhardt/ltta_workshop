1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,390
we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of the companies</font>

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've built they've gone through</font>

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,939
these major we're transferring yes

4
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,650
double-click I think went from well over

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,410
a thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> people down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 700 from 2,000</font>

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,940
people down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a thousand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter got cut</font>

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,830
in half how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that you've been</font>

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,289
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evangelists you've persuaded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,000</font>

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,330
people to join their cause it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,550
tough and it's it's even easier if you

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,900
just got rid of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand people one</font>

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,879
day because then you're done with what

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,860
was even harder is that we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of</font>

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,710
you know 250 and then another 250 and

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,989
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another 250 and then another 250</font>

16
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:44,089
and so keeping morale the people

17
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:45,979
remaining is very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult so</font>

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,120
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just be out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,430
people do the best you can be perceived

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,580
to be as honest as possible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even so</font>

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,989
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were fundamentally</font>

22
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,370
unhappy and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably more people</font>

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">were two left if they could have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font>

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">jobs elsewhere but it was a terrible</font>

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,619
time so they stayed and everything

26
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:02,720
turned around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stabilized and</font>

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,979
ultimately we had a great business and

28
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,960
fair to say that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,299
entrepreneur who intends to not just

30
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,490
have the idea and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the incubation of the</font>

31
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,409
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> but wants to grow it to a big</font>

32
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,759
successful level like that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

33
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,770
simply have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that that's</font>

34
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,630
a core competency it is a core company

35
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,340
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about evaluating talent I</font>

36
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,780
mean if I you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started talking</font>

37
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the new york knicks you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

38
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,289
would say look they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

39
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,880
good unless they get some better players

40
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,100
just that is what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

41
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,659
right well a company is like that too

42
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,460
you know you've jotted look around

43
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,750
tables they look do we have the best

44
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,270
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better people and</font>

45
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,450
what if you have a good person is it

46
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,159
okay to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm sorry I need</font>

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,689
somebody great goodbye even though I

48
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,759
like you yeah yeah you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,859
the best people out there so now you're

50
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,600
taking a risk when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you change so you've</font>

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,579
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be pretty confident but i always</font>

52
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,200
look around and think is there someone

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,700
out there who could do a better job if

54
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,990
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end up</font>

55
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,700
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> be players and ultimately your</font>

56
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,859
company will do badly and look we've

57
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,420
seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet space lots of</font>

58
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,649
companies so we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font>

59
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,719
eventually went under and everyone lost

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,369
their job and so that's what you should

61
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:05,840
keep in the back of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind as CEO</font>

62
00:02:05,840 --> 00:00:00,000
that's the ultimate failure
