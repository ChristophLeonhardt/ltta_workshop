KINGDOM.
NO TWO COUNTRIES DO MORE 
TOGETHER THAN OURS TO KEEP THEIR
PEOPLE SAFE AND PROSPEROUS.
WE WANT TO DEEPEN THAT 
COOPERATION EVEN FURTHER TO MEET
THE SHARED CHALLENGES WE FACE 
NOW AND IN YEARS AHEAD.
THIS MORNING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
I VISITED SANDHURST WHERE WE SAW
A DEMONSTRATION OF JOINT WORKING
BETWEEN BRITISH AND AMERICAN 
SPECIAL FORCES, ONE EXAMPLE OF 
WHAT IS TODAY THE BROADEST AND 
DEEPEST SECURITY COOPERATION OF 
ANY TWO COUNTRIES.
WHETHER IT IS OUR PILOTS 
DETERRING THE USE OF CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS IN SYRIA OR DEFEATING 
DAESH, OUR NAVY IN THE PACIFIC 
ENFORCING SANCTIONS ON NORTH 
KOREA, OR OUR UNPARALLELED 
INTELLIGENCE SHARING PARTNERSHIP
THWARTS ATTACKS, OUR SECURITY 
COOPERATION IS SAVING LIVES HERE
IN BRITAIN, IN AMERICA, AND 
RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD.
THAT PARTNERSHIP IS SET TO GROW 
WITH OUR ARMIES INTEGRATING TO A
LEVEL UNMATCHED ANYWHERE AND FOR
THE UK SET TO SPEND $24 BILLION 
POUNDS ON U.S. EQUIPMENT AND 
SUPPORT OVER THE NEXT DECADE.
TODAY WE'VE ALSO DISCUSSED HOW 
WE CAN DEEPEN OUR WORK TOGETHER 
TO RESPOND TO MALIGNED STATE 
ACTIVITY, TERRORISM AND SERIOUS 
CRIME.
IN PARTICULAR ON RUSSIA I 
THANKED PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR HIS 
SUPPORT IN RESPONDING TO THE 
APPALLING USE OF A NERVE AGENT 
IN SALISBURY.
AND I WELCOMED HIS MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTIN IN 
HELSINKI ON MONDAY.
WE AGREED IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
ENGAGE RUSSIA FROM A POSITION OF
STRENGTH AND UNITY AND THAT WE 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO DETER OUR 
EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE OUR 
DEMOCRACY.
TURNING TO OUR COOPERATION WITH 
MUTUAL INVEST OF OVER $1 
TRILLION WE WANT TO GO FURTHER.
WE AGREED TODAY AS THE UK LEAVES
THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL PURR 
SOON AN AMBITIOUS U.S./UK FREE 
TRADE AGREEMENT.
THE AGREEMENT REACHED LAST WEEK 
PROVIDES THE PLATFORM FOR DONALD
AND ME TO AGREE AN AMBITIOUS 
DEAL FOR BOTH COUNTRIES ACROSS 
OUR ECONOMIES.
IT BUILDS ON THE UK'S 
INDEPENDENT TRADE POLICY, 
REDUCIN
REDUCING TARIFFS AND TWO OF THE 
WORLD MOST ADVANCED ECONOMIES 
SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF NEW 
TECHNOLOGY.
ALL OF THIS WILL FURTHER ENHANCE
OUR ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
CREATING NEW JOBS AND PROSPERITY
FOR OUR PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS 
TO COME.
THE UK/U.S. RELATIONSHIP IS ALSO
DEFINED BY THE ROLE WE PLAY ON 
THE WORLD STAGE.
DOING THIS MEANS MAKING TOUGH 
CALLS AND SOMETIMES BEING 
PREPARED TO SAY THINGS OTHERS 
MIGHT RATHER NOT HEAR.
FROM THE OUTSET PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HIS HE SEES
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND ON 
MANY WE AGREE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEED TO DEAL 
WITH THE LONGSTANDING NUCLEAR 
THREAT OF DPRK WHERE THE 
AGREEMENT IN SINGAPORE HAS SET 
IN TRADE THE PROSPECT OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION OR THE NEED TO 
ADDRESS THE DESTABLE STABILIZING
THE INFLUENCE OF IRAN IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST IN YEMEN.
OR THE NEED FOR NATO ALLIES TO 
DECREASE SPENDING OR CAPABILITY 
ON WHICH WE SAW INCREASES AT THE
SUMMIT.
THIS WEEK I ANNOUNCED A FURTHER 
UPLIFT OF 440 UK TROOPS, A 
COMMITMENT TO A MISSION THAT 
BEGAN AS NATO'S ONLY USE OF 
ARTICLE FIVE ACTING IN SUPPORT 
OF THE U.S.
FINALLY LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT 
THE WIDER TRANSATLANTIC 
RELATIONSHIP.
IT IS ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
TO ENSURE THE TRANSATLANTIC UNIT
ENDURES FOR WHICH HAS BEEN 
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PROTECTION 
AND PROJECTION OF OUR INTERESTS 
AND VALUES FOR GENERATIONS.
WITH U.S. LEADERSHIP AT ITS 
FOUNDATION, ITS BEATING HEART 
REMAINS OUR DEMOCRATIC VALUES 
AND OUR COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE, 
THOSE VALUES ARE SOMETHING THAT 
WE IN THE UK WILL ALWAYS CHERISH
AS I KNOW THE U.S. WILL TOO.
IT IS THE STRENGTH OF THESE 
VALUES AND THE COMMON INTERESTS 
THEY CREATE THAT WE SEE ACROSS 
THE BREADTH OF OUR SOCIETY IN 
NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE AND 
THAT IS WHY I'M CONFIDENT THAT 
THIS TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE WILL
CONTINUE TO THE BED ROCK OF OUR 
SHARED SECURITY AND PROSPERITY 
FOR YEARS TO COME.
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
PRIME MINISTER, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH.
IT IS MY TRUE HONOR TO JOIN YOU 
AT THIS REMARKABLE SETTING.
TRULY MAGNIFICENT AS WE 
CELEBRATE THE SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO 
COUNTRIES.
ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR VERY GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THERESA.
LAST NIGHT MELANIA AND I WERE 
DELIGHTED TO JOIN YOU AND 
PHILLIP FOR DINNER AT THE 
PALACE.
IT WAS A WONDERFUL AND MEMORABLE
EVENING THAT WE WILL NOT SOON 
FORGET.
IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING VERY 
SPECIAL.
TODAY IT'S A TRUE PRIVILEGE TO 
VISIT HISTORIC CHECKERS THAT 
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT AND 
READ SO MUCH ABOUT GROWING UP IN
HISTORY CLASS AND TO CONTINUE 
OUR CONVERSATION WHICH HAS 
REALLY PROCEEDED ALONG RAPIDLY 
AND WELL OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.
FOR GENERATIONS OUR PREDECESSORS
HAVE GATHERED AT THIS STUNNING 
RETREAT TO STRENGTHEN A BOND 
THAT IS LIKE NO OTHER.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO
NATIONS IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE 
CAUSE OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE AND
PEACE.
THE NIUNITED KINGDOM AND UNITED 
STATES IS BOUND TOGETHER.
THE TRADITIONS OF FREEDOM, 
SOVEREIGNTY AND THE TRUE RULE OF
LAW WERE OUR SHARED GIFT TO THE 
WORLD.
THEY'RE NOW OUR PRICELESS 
INHERITANCE TO A CIVILIZATION.
WE MUST NEVER CEASE TO BE 
NIGHTED IN THEIR DEFENSE AND IN 
THEIR RENEWAL.
BEFORE OUR DINNER LAST NIGHT, 
MELANIA AND I JOINED PRIME 
MINISTER MAY, MR. MAY, AND THE 
DUKE AND DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH 
FOR A TOUR OF THE WINSTON 
CHURCHHILL EXHIBIT.
IT WAS SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL.
IT WAS FROM RIGHT HERE THAT 
PRIME MINISTER CHURCHHILL PHONED
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AFTER PEARL 
HARBOR.
IN THAT HORRIFIC WAR AMERICAN 
AND BRITISH SERVICE MEMBERS 
BRAVELY SHED THEIR BLOOD 
ALONGSIDE ONE ANOTHER IN DEFENSE
OF HOME AND IN DEFENSE OF 
FREEDOM.
AND TOGETHER WE ACHIEVED A 
REALLY SPECIAL MAGNIFICENT 
VICTORY AND IT WAS TOTAL 
VICTORY.
PRIME MINISTER MAY AND I HAVE 
JUST COME FROM A VERY PRODUCTIVE
NATO SUMMIT THAT WAS TRULY A 
PRODUCTIVE SUMMIT WHERE MY TOP 
PRIORITY WAS GETTING OTHER NATO 
MEMBERS TO PAY THEIR FULL AND 
FAIR SHARE AND THE PRIME 
MINISTER WAS RIGHT THERE WITH 
ME.
I WANT TO THANK YOU, PRIME 
MINISTER, FOR THE UNITED 
KINGDOM'S CONTRIBUTION TO OUR 
COMMON DEFENSE.
THE UK IS ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF 
NATIONS, FIVE OUT OF 29, NOT 
GOOD, BUT IT'S GOING TO GET 
BETTER REALLY FAST, IN ADDITION 
TO THE UNITED STATES MEETING THE
2% GDP MINIMUM DEFENSE SPENDING 
COMMITMENT.
DURING THE SUMMIT I MADE CLEAR 
ALL NATO ALLIES MUST HONOR THEIR
OBLIGATIONS AND I'M PLEASED TO 
REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED 
SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENTS FROM 
MEMBERS TO INCREASE THEIR 
DEFENSE SPENDING AND TO DO SO IN
A MUCH MORE TIMELY MANNER.
IN OUR MEETINGS TODAY, THE PRIME
MINISTER AND I DISCUSSED A RANGE
OF SHARED PRIORITIES INCLUDING 
STOPPING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION.
I THANKED PRIME MINISTER MAY FOR
HER PARTNERSHIP IN OUR PURSUIT 
OF A NUCLEAR FREE NORTH KOREA.
IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS HELP.
THE PRIME MINISTER AND I ALSO 
DISCUSSED IRAN.
WE BOTH AGREE THAT IRAN MUST 
NEVER POSSESS A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
AND THAT I MUST HALT AND WE MUST
DO IT AND I'M GOING TO DO IT AND
SHE'S GOING TO DO IT AND WE'RE 
ALL GOING TO DO IT TOGETHER.
WE HAVE TO STOP TERRORISTS.
WE HAVE TO STOP TERRORISM AND WE
HAVE TO GET CERTAIN COUNTRIES 
AND THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY, I 
BELIEVE.
THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM HAS TO 
STOP AND IT HAS TO STOP NOW.
I ENCOURAGE THE PRIME MINISTER 
TO SUSTAIN PRESSURE ON THE 
REGIME AND SHE NEEDED ABSOLUTELY
NO ENCOURAGEMENT BECAUSE SHE, IN
FACT, ALSO ENCOURAGES ME AND 
WE'RE DOING THAT AND WE'RE DOING
THAT TOGETHER.
VERY CLOSELY COORDINATED.
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE 
UNITED STATES ARE ALSO 
STRENGTHENING COOPERATION 
BETWEEN OUR ARMED FORCES WHO 
SERVED TOGETHER IN BATTLEFIELDS 
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
TODAY WE VIEWED SEVERAL U.S./UK 
SPECIAL FORCES DEMONSTRATION.
WE SAW SOME DEMONSTRATIONS TODAY
FRANKLY THAT WERE INCREDIBLE.
THE TALENT OF THESE YOUNG, 
BRAVE, STRONG PEOPLE.
WE SAW IT AT THE ROYAL MILITARY 
ACADEMY.
SEAMLESS COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR
MILITARIES IS REALLY JUST VITAL 
TO ADDRESSING SHARED SECURITY 
THREATS.
WE HAVE THREATS FAR DIFFERENT 
THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE.
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN OUT THERE, 
BUT THESE ARE DIFFERENT AND 
THEY'RE SE VVERE AND WE WILL 
HANDLE THEM WELL.
WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF 
BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION 
CONTROL.
IN ORDER TO PREVENT FOREIGN ACTS
OF TERRORISM, WE MUST PREVENT 
TERRORISTS FROM GAINING 
ADMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE.
BORDER SECURITY IS A NATIONAL 
SECURITY PROBLEM.
IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE 
WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THE 
DEMOCRATS TO GIVE US A COUPLE OF
VOTES SO WE CAN PASS MEANINGFUL 
AND POWERFUL BORDER SECURITY.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK PRIME 
MINISTER MAY FOR PURSUING FAIR 
AND RESIP PRO CAL TRADE WITH THE
UNITED STATES.
ONCE THE BREXIT PROCESS IS 
CONCLUDED AND PERHAPS THE UK HAS
LEFT THE EU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, BUT 
WHATEVER YOU DO IS OKAY WITH ME.
THAT'S YOUR DECISION.
WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS 
OKAY WITH US.
JUST MAKE SURE WE CAN TRADE 
TOGETHER.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
THE UNITED STATES LOOKS FORWARD 
TO FINALIZING A GREAT BILATERAL 
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED 
KINGDOM.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR TWO 
COUNTRIES AND WE WILL SEIZE IT 
FULLY.
WE SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE 
BRITISH PEOPLE TO REALIZE FULL 
SELF-GOVERNMENT AND WE WILL SEE 
HOW THAT GOES.
VERY COMPLICATED NEGOTIATION AND
NOT AN EASY NEGOTIATION.
THAT'S FOR SURE.
A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT UNITED 
KINGDOM IS A BLESSING ON THE 
WORLD.
PRIME MINISTER MAY, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE HONOR OF
VISITING THE UNITED KINGDOM.
A SPECIAL PLACE.
MY MOTHER WAS BORN HERE, SO IT 
MEANS SOMETHING MAYBE JUST A 
LITTLE BIT EXTRA, MAYBE EVEN A 
LOT EXTRA, AND WE HAD AN 
WONDERFUL VISIT.
LAST NIGHT I THINK I GOT TO KNOW
THE PRIME MINISTER BETTER THAN 
AT ANY TIME.
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER 
OVER A YEAR AND A HALF, BUT LAST
NIGHT I WAS REALLY EMBARRASSED 
FOR THE REST OF THE TABLE.
WE TALKED ABOUT LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
TO THOSE PROBLEMS AND IT WAS A 
GREAT EVENING.
AS WE STAND TOGETHER THIS 
AFTERNOON, WE CONTINUE A LONG 
TRADITION OF FRIENDSHIP, 
COLLABORATION AND AFFECTION 
BETWEEN OURSELVES AND ALSO 
BETWEEN OUR PEOPLE.
THE ENDURING RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN OUR NATIONS HAS NEVER 
BEEN STRONGER THAN IT IS NOW.
SO MADAME PRIME MINISTER, THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH.
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR.
>> THANK YOU.
NOW WE WILL -- WE'RE GOING TO 
TAKE FOUR QUESTIONINGS EACH.
I'LL START OFF WITH LAURA.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRIME 
MINISTER AND MR. PRESIDENT.
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SEEM RATHER 
TO HAVE CHANGED YOUR TUNE FROM 
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK 
WHEN YOU SAID THAT ON THE 
CURRENT BREXIT PLAN THAT WOULD 
PROBABLY KILL THE POSSIBILITY OF
A TRADE DEAL WITH THE UK.
OUR COUNTRIES ARE MEANT TO HAVE 
A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, YET YOU 
PUBLICLY CRITICIZED THE PRIME 
MINISTER POLICY AND HER 
PERSONALLY FOR NOT LISTENING TO 
YOU THIS WEEK.
IS THAT REALLY THE BEHAVIOR OF A
FRIEND AND AND PRIME MINISTER, 
ISN'T THE PROBLEM FOR YOU THAT 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MR. 
TRUMP HAS SAID ABOUT YOUR BREXIT
PLAN ARE RIGHT?
IT WILL LIMIT THE POSSIBILITIES 
OF DOING TRADE DEALS EASILY IN 
THE FUTURE.
CAN YOU ALSO TELL US HOW IT FELT
FOR HIM TO CRITICIZE YOU IN THE 
WAY HE DID IN THAT INTERVIEW?
>> MAYBE I'LL GO FIRST BECAUSE I
DIDN'T CRITICIZE THE PRIME 
MINISTER.
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE 
PRIME MINISTER.
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS A STORY
THAT WAS DONE WHICH WAS, YOU 
KNOW, GENERALLY FINE, BUT IT 
DIDN'T PUT IN WHAT I SAID ABOUT 
THE PRIME MINISTER.
AND I SAID TREMENDOUS THINGS.
FORTUNATELY WE TEND TO RECORD 
STORIES NOW, SO WE HAVE IT FOR 
YOUR ENJOYMENT IF YOU'D LIKE IT,
BUT WE RECORD WHEN WE DEAL WITH 
REPORTERS.
IT'S CALLED FAKE NEWS AND WE 
SOLVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE
GOOD OLD RECORDING INSTRUMENT.
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER AS I REALLY JUST SAID, 
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE A DECISION 
AS TO WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO.
THE ONLY THING I ASK OF THERESA 
IS THAT WE MAKE SURE WE CAN 
TRADE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY 
RESTRICTIONS, BECAUSE WE WANT TO
TRADE WITH THE UK AND THE UK 
WANTS TO TRADE WITH US.
WE'RE BY FAR THEIR BIGGEST 
TRA
TRADING PARTNER AND WE HAVE A 
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO 
DOUBLE, TRIPLE, THAT.
SO IF THEY'RE GOING A SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT ROUTE AND THEY WANT 
INDEPENDENCE.
IT'S JUST THE DEFINITION.
IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO A CERTAIN
ROUTE, I JUST SAID I HOPE YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TRADE WITH 
THE UNITED STATES.
I READ REPORTS WHERE THAT WON'T 
BE POSSIBLE, BUT I BELIEVE AFTER
SPEAKING WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S PEOPLE AND 
REPRESENTATIVES AND TRADE 
EXPERTS IT WILL ABSOLUTELY BE 
POSITIVE.
SO BASED ON THAT, AND BASED ON 
JUST TRADE IN GENERAL, AND OUR 
OTHER RELATIONSHIP WHICH WILL BE
FINE, BUT THE TRADE IS A LITTLE 
BIT TRICKY.
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRADE AND 
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRADE 
AND I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO 
THAT.
OKAY?
AND I THINK SHE'S DOING A 
TERRIFIC JOB, BY THE WAY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
JUST TO CONFIRM WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID, LAURA, THERE
WILL BE NO LIMIT TO THE 
POSSIBILITY OF US DOING TRADE 
DEALS AROUND THE REST OF THE 
WORLD ONCE WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN
UNION ON THE BASIS OF THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE HERE.
JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT IS AN 
AGREEMENT THAT DELIVERS ON THE 
BREXIT VOTE THAT WE HAD IN 2016 
HERE IN THE UK THAT DELIVERS 
WHAT I BELIEVE IS AT THE 
FOREFRONT OF THE PEOPLE'S MINDS 
WHEN THEY WERE VOTING TO LEAVE 
THE EUROPE UNION.
SO AT THE END OF THESE 
NEGOTIATIONS, WE WILL ENSURE 
THAT FREE MOVEMENT WILL COME TO 
AN END.
THE JURISDICTION OF THE EUROPION
COURT OF JUSTICE HERE IN THE UK 
WILL COME TO AN END.
THE SENDING OF VAST SUMS OF 
MONEY WILL COME TO AN END.
WE WILL COME OUT OF THE POLICY 
AND WE WILL ENSURE BY NOT BEING 
IN THE CUSTOMS UNION THAT WE ARE
ABLE TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT 
TRADE POLICY AND DO THOSE TRADE 
DEALS AROUND THE WORLD.
AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE 
PRESIDENT, THE UNITED STATES IS 
KEEN FOR US.
WE'RE KEEN TO WORK WITH THEM.
WE WILL DO A TRADE DEAL WITH 
ZMEM
THEM AND WITH OTHERS AROUND THE 
REST OF THE WORLD. 
>> JONATHAN, GO AHEAD.
>>> MR. PRESIDENT, TWO 
QUESTIONS, IF I MAY.
THE FIRST ONE, NOW YOUR BRITISH 
TRIP IS COMING TO A CLOSE.
COULD YOU TELL US THE THREE OR 
FOUR THINGS YOU HOPED TO ACHIEVE
IN YOUR MEETING WITH VLADIMIR 
PUTIN.
AND THE SECOND QUESTION, WHAT'S 
THE BENEFIT TO AMERICA OF HAVING
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN 
TROOPS STATIONED IN EUROPE?
THANK YOU.
>> SO I'LL BE MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN ON MONDAY.
WE GO INTO THE MEETING WITH A 
TREMENDOUS MEETING THAT WE HAD 
WITH NATO.
MOST OF YOU HAVE REPORTED IT 
CORRECTLY.
IT WAS CERTAINLY TESTY AT THE 
BEGINNING, BUT AT THE END 
EVERYBODY CAME TOGETHER AND THEY
AGREED TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO
AND ACTUALLY WHAT THEY'VE 
COMMITTED TO DO, WHICH YOU FULLY
ADHERE TO.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM, BUT 
SOME PEOPLE DID.
WE LEFT THAT MEETING I THINK 
PROBABLY MORE UNIFIED AND 
WEALTHIER AS A GROUP THAN EVER 
BEFORE.
SO WE GO IN STRONG.
WE'LL BE TALKING TO PRESIDENT 
PUTIN ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS.
UKRAINE.
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SYRIA.
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OTHER 
PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST.
I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR 
PROLIFERATION.
BECAUSE WE ARE MASSIVELY, YOU 
KNOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING, WE 
HAVE BEEN MODERNIZING AND FIXING
AND BUYING AND IT'S JUST A 
DEVASTATING TECHNOLOGY.
AND THEY LIKEWISE ARE DOING A 
LOT.
AND IT'S A VERY, VERY BAD 
POLICY.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
BUT WE ARE MASSIVELY BIG AND 
THEY ARE VERY BIG AND I'LL BE 
TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR 
PROLIFERATION.
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING IF 
WE COULD DO.
IT'S NOT ONLY US.
IT'S NOT ONLY RUSSIA AND THE 
UNITED STATES.
IT'S OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO.
BUT WE'RE THE TWO LEADERS.
WE WOULD BE THE LEADER.
THEY WOULD BE SECOND I GUESS 
CHINA WOULD BE THIRD.
I THINK WE'LL ALL BE TALKING 
ABOUT THAT.
TO ME, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A 
TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT IF WE 
COULD DO SOMETHING ON NUCLEAR 
PROLIFERATION.
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OTHER 
THINGS.
I KNOW YOU'LL ASK WILL WE BE 
TALKING ABOUT MEDDLING AND I 
WILL ABSOLUTELY BRING THAT UP.
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE ANY, 
GEE, I DID IT, I DID IT, YOU GOT
ME.
THERE WON'T BE A PERRY MASON 
HERE I DON'T THINK.
I NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT I WILL ABSOLUTELY FIRMLY ASK
THE QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WITH RUSSIA.
THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD AGREE 
.
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH
RUSSIA AND CHINA AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES IS A GOOD THING, NOT A
BAD THING.
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAPPEN.
>> THE TROOPS WHERE?
WELL, LOOK, THERE IS A BENEFIT.
THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFIT 
AND A MILITARY BENEFIT.
THERE'S ALSO A BENEFIT NOT TO DO
IT.
I WAS PREPARED TO DO SOMETHING 
SOMEWHAT HARSH BUT PEOPLE CAME 
TOGETHER IN THE END.
IT WASN'T A THREAT.
TFG
IT WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION.
WE WERE PAYING 90% OF THE COST 
OF NATO AND NATO IS REALLY THERE
FOR EUROPE MUCH MORE SO THAN US.
IT HELPS EUROPE NO MATTER WHAT 
OUR MILITARY PEOPLE OR YOUR 
MILITARY SAY, IT HELPS EUROPE 
MORE THAN IT HELPS US.
THAT BEING SAID, IT IS A GREAT 
UNIFIER.
WE HAVE 29 COUNTRIES AND THERE 
WAS A LOT OF LOVE IN THAT ROOM.
WHEN YOU SAY 10,000 TROOPS, WE 
HAVE A LOT MORE THAN 10,000 
TROOPS. 
>> TENS OF. 
>> OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID 10,000
IN GERMANY WE HAVE 52,000 
TROOPS.
THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE HELPING 
EUROPE, THEY'RE HELPING US, 
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER AND I'M FINE 
WITH IT. 
>> AND BY THE WAY VERY 
IMPORTANTLY THEY'RE NOW PAYING 
THEIR WAY IN A MUCH MORE RAPID 
FASHION.
>> FRANCIS.
>> PRIME MINISTER, I WONDER 
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
THAT IMMIGRATION HAS DAMAGED THE
CULTURAL FABRIC OF EUROPE.
AND PRESIDENT, PERHAPS YOU COULD
ELABORATE ON THAT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY BAD 
FOR EUROPE.
I THINK EUROPE IS A PLACE I KNOW
VERY WELL AND I THINK THAT WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED IS VERY TOUGH.
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION.
YOU SEE THE SAME TERROR ATTACKS 
THAT I DO.
WE SEE THEM A LOT.
WE JUST LEFT SOME INCREDIBLE 
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AT SANDHURST
AND THEY WERE SHOWING US CELLS 
AND SHOWING US THINGS THAT 
FRANKLY 20 YEARS AGO NOBODY EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT, PROBABLY A LOT 
MORE RECENTLY THAN THAT.
I JUST THINK IT'S CHANGING THE 
CULTURE.
I THINK IT'S A VERY NEGATIVE 
THING FOR EUROPE.
I THINK IT'S VERY NEGATIVE.
I THINK HAVING GERMANY AND I 
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH 
ANGELA MERKEL.
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH GERMANY.
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH HER 
GERMANY.
I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH HER OTHER
PARTS OF EUROPE.
AND I KNOW IT'S POLITICALLY NOT 
NECESSARILY CORRECT TO SAY THAT,
BUT I'LL SAY IT AND I'LL SAY IT 
LOUD.
AND I THINK THEY BETTER WATCH 
THEMSELVES BECAUSE YOU ARE 
CHANGING CULTURE.
YOU ARE CHANGING A LOT OF 
THINGS.
YOU'RE CHANGING SECURITY.
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
YOU TAKE A LOOK.
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT NEVER 
HAD DIFFICULTY, NEVER HAD 
PROBLEMS.
IT'S A VERY SAD SITUATION.
IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE.
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT'S GOOD FOR
EUROPE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S 
GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY.
WE'RE AS YOU KNOW FAR SUPERIOR 
TO ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED 
BEFORE, BUT WE HAVE VERY BAD 
IMMIGRATION LAWS AND WE'RE -- I 
MEAN, WE'RE DOING INCREDIBLY 
WELL CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT 
WE VUIRTUALLY DON'T HAVE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS.
WE HAVE LAWS SO BAD I DON'T EVEN
CALL THEM LAWS.
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU WALK ACROSS 
THE BORDER AND YOU PUT 1 FOOT ON
THE LAND AND NOW YOU'RE TIED UP 
IN A LAWSUIT FOR FIVE YEARS.
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING ANYONE'S
EVER SEEN.
I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT 
RECOMMENDATION TO EUROPE.
I'VE MADE IT VERY LOUD AND 
CLEAR.
I MADE IT YESTERDAY.
29 COUNTRIES TOTAL.
AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL.
>> THE UK HAS A PROUD HISTORY OF
WELCOMING PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING
PERSECUTION TO OUR COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A PROUD HISTORY OF 
WELCOMING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
COME TO OUR COUNTRY TO 
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY AND 
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY.
AND OVER THE YEARS, OVERALL 
IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN GOOD FOR 
THE UK.
IT'S BROUGHT PEOPLE WITH 
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, DIFFERENT
OUTLOOKS HERE TO THE UK.
AND HAS -- WE HAVE SEEN THEM 
CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOCIETY AND 
OUR ECONOMY.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE 
HAVE CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS.
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE 
HAVE A SET OF RULES THAT ENABLES
US TO DETERMINE WHO COMES IN TO 
OUR COUNTRY AND OF COURSE THAT 
IS WHAT AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE 
BEEN DOING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
AND WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO 
DO IN THE FUTURE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT.
>> YOU SPENT THE WEEK TAKING ON 
NATO ALLIES, CRITICIZING PRIME 
MINISTER MAY ON HER OWN SOIL AND
I I WONDER ARE YOU GIVING 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN
THE UPPER HAND HEADING INTO YOUR
TALKS GIVEN THAT YOU ARE 
CHALLENGING THESE ALLIANCES THAT
HE SEEKS TO BREAK UP AND 
DESTROY?
>> THAT'S SUCH DISHONEST 
REPORTING, BECAUSE OF COURSE IT 
HAPPENS TO BE NBC WHICH IS 
POSSIBLY WORSE THAN CNN, 
POSSIBLY.
POSSIBLY.
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING.
WE HAVE LEFT NATO WITH MORE 
MONEY, WITH MORE UNITY, WITH 
MORE SPIRIT THAN NATO PROBABLY 
HAS EVER HAD.
WE HAVE A STRONG AND POWERFUL 
NATO.
WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT, WE 
DIDN'T.
WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T 
PAYING THEIR BILLS.
WE HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE WAY 
DOWN, THAT WEREN'T FOLLOWING 
THEIR COMMITMENTS.
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE BECOME AN
OIL EXPORTER WHICH WOULD NOT 
HAVE HAPPENED UNDER THE PAST 
REGIME OR A NEW REGIME IF IT 
WEREN'T US.
WE HAVE BUILT UP OUR MILITARY 
$700 BILLION AND THEN NEXT YEAR 
AS YOU KNOW $716 BILLION.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA, WHOEVER
IT IS IN RUSSIA ARE SAYING GEE, 
WE RWISH TRUMP WAS NOT THE 
VICTOR.
WE HAVE BEEN FAR TOUGHER ON 
RUSSIA THAN ANYBODY.
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO GO DOWN 
100 YEARS, BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE
BEEN EXTREMELY TOUGH ON RUSSIA, 
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT WHEN THE
PRIME MINISTER CALLED, WHEN THEY
HAD A HORRIBLE THING HAPPEN 
RIGHT HERE VERY CLOSE BY, SHE 
ASKED WOULD I DO SOMETHING AND 
I -- MAYBE I'D LET YOU TELL THE 
NUMBER AND IT WAS FAR GREATER 
THAN ANYBODY ELSE, INCLUDING THE
PRIME MINISTER.
WE EXPELLED HOW MANY PEOPLE?
AND GERMANY DID THREE AS AN 
EXAMPLE.
SO GERMANY, BIG COUNTRY, 
POWERFUL COUNTRY, THEY DID 
THREE.
THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT IT.
SO IT REALLY IS.
WE HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG ON 
RUSSIA.
WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID, IF I 
HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN, I
DON'T KNOW HIM.
I MET HIM TWICE, MAYBE THREE 
TIMES, TWO AND A HALF TIMES.
MOST OF YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE 
DID.
WE MET HIM AT THE G 20.
IF WE COULD DEVELOP A 
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS GOOD FOR 
RUSSIA, GOOD FOR US, GOOD FOR 
EVERYBODY, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
IF I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CHINA, YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A BIG 
TRADE SITUATION WITH CHINA AS AN
EXAMPLE WHERE WE'RE BEHIND EVERY
YEAR FOR MANY YEARS, $500 
BILLION.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
ANYMORE.
SO IF WE GOT ALONG WITH 
COUNTRIES, THAT'S A GOOD THING.
IF WE GOT ALONG WITH CHINA, 
RUSSIA, THAT'S A GOOD THING, NOT
A BAD THING.
>> I TAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE 
NATO -- 
>> THE HEADLINE YOU SEE ISN'T 
THE HEADLINE.
YES, THERE'S FIGHTING.
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT UP MORE MONEY.
WE HAVE TO BE STRONGER.
WE HAVE TO BE HEADLINED.
THE HEADLINE HE SEES ISN'T 
WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THE 
MORNING.
THE HEADLINE HE SEES IS WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE AFTERNOON WHERE 
WE CAME TOGETHER AS ONE.
THEY'RE PUTTING UP BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARINGS.
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
YOU KNOW THIS IS A CONFIRMED 
NUMBER.
$34 BILLION MORE WAS RAISED 
SINCE I BECAME PRESIDENT IN 
NATO.
THAT MEANS THAT THE OTHER 28 
COUNTRIES HAVE PUT IN $34 
BILLION MORE INTO NATO.
DO YOU THINK PUTIN IS HAPPY 
ABOUT THAT?
I DON'T THINK SO.
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF FALSE 
REPORTING IN THIS COUNTRY.
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THAT IN 
COUNTRY, DO YOU, PRIME MINISTER?
GO AHEAD.
ASK THE PRIME MINISTER.
>> THE QUESTION IS WHILE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IT WILL "THE 
SUN" I THINK THE DEAL SHE IS 
STRIKING ON BREXIT IS NOT WHAT 
THE PEOPLE VOTED FOR.
IS HE WRONG?
AND I WONDER IF HE COULD GET 
YOUR REACTION TO HIM SAYING 
BORIS JOHNSON WOULD BE A GREAT 
PRIME MINISTER. 
>> THE AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE PUT 
ON THE TABLE, AS I SAID EARLIER 
IN RESPONSE TO LAURA'S FIRST 
QUESTION, THIS DOES DELIVER ON 
THE VOTE OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE.
THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTED TO 
LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I 
HEARD THE TURN OF PHRASE THE 
PRESIDENT USED EARLIER, BUT LET 
ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS.
HE WILL BE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN 
UNION AND WE ARE LEAVING ON THE 
29th OF MARCH, 2019.
AS WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
WE WILL BE DELIVERING ON WHAT 
PEOPLE VOTED FOR, AN END TO FREE
MOVE PENT, AN END TO SENDING 
VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE 
EUROPEAN UNION EVERY YEAR AND AN
END TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF 
JUSTICE EVERY YEAR COMING OUT OF
THE COMMON FISHERY POLICY, 
COMING OUT OF THE COMMON 
ALCULTURE POLICIES AND ENSURING 
BY COMING OUT OF THE CUSTOMS 
UNION THAT WE CAN HAVE AN 
INDEPENDENT TRADE POLICY THAT 
ALLOWS US TO NEGOTIATE TRADE 
DEALS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND
OTHER COUNTRIES.
THAT'S WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE 
VOTED FOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE 
WILL BE DELIVERING.
PEEL DELIVER IT IN A WAY THAT 
PROTECTS JOBS AND LIVELIHOODS 
AND MEETS OUR COMMITMENT TO THE 
BORDER IN BETWEEN NORTHERN 
IRELAND AND IRELAND.
AND ROBERT?
>> I'LL RESPOND.
THEY SAID UNRELATED.
WE HAVE THE TAPE YOU CAN GET IT 
FROM SARAH.
WE TAPED THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW.
THEY ASKED ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON 
AND I SAID HE WOULD BE A GREAT 
PRIME MINISTER.
HE'S BEEN SAYING VERY NICE 
THINGS ABOUT ME AS PRESIDENT.
I THINK HE THINKS I'M DOING A 
GREAT JOB.
I AM DOING A GREAT JOB I WILL 
TELL YOU IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T 
NOTICED.
BORIS JOHNSON WOULD BE A GREAT 
PRIME MINISTER.
I ALSO SAID THAT THIS INCREDIBLE
WOMAN RIGHT HERE IS DOING A 
FANTASTIC JOB, A GREAT JOB.
AND I MEAN THAT.
AND I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE 
GOTTEN TO KNOW THERESA MAY MUCH 
BETTER OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS 
THAN I'VE KNOWN HER OVER THE 
LAST YEAR AND A HALF.
YESTERDAY I HAD BREAKFAST, LUNCH
AND DINNER WITH HER AND I SAID 
WHAT ARE WE DOG TOMORROW?
OH, YOU'RE HAVING BREAKFAST AND 
LUNCH WITH THERESA MAY AND I'M 
GOING TO SEE YOU LATER ON AGAIN.
I'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN TO KNOW 
HERBERT THAN EVER.
I THINK SHE'S A TERRIFIC WOMAN 
AND SHE'S DOING A TERRIFIC JOB.
THAT BREXIT IS A VERY TOUGH 
SITUATION.
THAT'S A TOUGH DEAL BETWEEN THE 
BORDERS AND THE ENTRIES INTO THE
COUNTRIES AND ALL OF THE THINGS.
SHE'S GOING TO DO THE BEST.
THE ONLY THING I ASK IS THAT SHE
WORK IT OUT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE 
VERY EVEN TRADE BECAUSE WE DO 
NOT HAVE A FAIR DEAL WITH THE 
EUROPEAN UNION RIGHT NOW ON 
TRADE.
THEY TREAT THE UNITED STATES 
HORRIBLY AND THAT'S GOING TO 
CHANGE.
AND IF IT DOESN'T CHANGE, 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A 
VERY BIG PRICE AND THEY KNOW 
WHAT THAT PRICE IS.
THEY'RE COMING OVER ON JULY 25th
TO SEE ME AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN 
WORK SOMETHING OUT.
THEY HAVE BARRIERS THAT ARE 
BEYOND BELIEF, BARRIERS WHERE 
THEY WON'T TAKE OUR FARM 
PRODUCTS.
THEY WON'T TAKE MANY OF OUR 
THINGS INCLUDING OUR CARS.
THEY CHARGE US TARIFFS ON CARS 
FAR GREATER THAN WE CHARGE THEM.
YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS.
LAST YEAR, THERESA, WE LOST $151
BILLION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION.
SO WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT ANY
LONGER.
THANK YOU.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, HOW WOULD YOU 
CHARACTERIZE YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM?
MORE SPECIAL THAN ANY OTHER 
COUNTRIES?
BY THE WAY, ON FARM PRODUCTS, I 
THINK ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S 
DEAL, YOU WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
EXPORT MANY FARM PRODUCTS TO THE
UK.
WOULD THAT BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU?
PRIME MINISTER, THE PRESIDENT 
SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE GAVE YOU 
ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO NEGOTIATE 
BREXIT.
THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT 
ADVICE.
I WONDERED WHAT THAT ADVICE 
SKWAS 
AND WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS
ABOUT NOT TAKING. 
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE GIVE ME 
ADVICE ABOUT HOW YOU TO 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE EUROPEAN 
UNION.
MY JOB IS GETTING OUT THERE AND 
DOING IT AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE 
DONE.
AS WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH 
THESE NEGOTIATIONS, THERE BEEN 
SKEPTICAL VOICES FROM YOU ABOUT 
WHAT WE WOULD ACHIEVE IN 
DECEMBER.
WE'VE GOT THAT JOINT AGREEMENT 
ON CITIZENS RIGHTS AND THOSE 
OTHER ISSUES.
WE'VE GOT THE IMPLE MEMENTATION 
PERIOD IN MARCH.
WE'VE PUT FORWARD THE TWO 
PROPOSALS.
THE TWO THAT WERE PUT FORWARD 
WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE.
WE SAID NO AND THAT'S WHY WE 
HAVE PUT OUR OWN PROPOSAL ON THE
TABLE.
IN ANSWER TO ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS, IT DELIVERS ON THE 
BREXIT DEAL BUT ALSO ENSURES 
THAT WE CAN HAVE SMOOTH TRADE 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE 
FUTURE.
IN TERMS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
IN TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES,
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS ON SOME 
OF THE TRADE ISSUES ABOUT THE 
STANDARDS WE HAVE HERE FOR 
CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND HOW WE WANT
TO DEAL WITH THOSE IN THE TRADE 
DEAL.
THAT WILL BE A MATTER FOR THE 
NEGOTIATIONS.
>> SO I WOULD SAY I GIVE OUR 
RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF GRADE 
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPECIAL.
WE START OFF WITH SPECIAL.
I WOULD GIVE OUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE UK OKAY.
NOW ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS TWO 
DAYS WITH YOUR PRIME MINISTER, I
WOULD SAY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 
SPECIAL.
AM I ALLOWED TO GO HIGHER THAN 
THAT?
I'M NOT SURE.
IT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF 
SPECIAL.
THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE.
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL COUNTRY.
AS I SAID, I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN 
SCOTLAND.
SO VERY IMPORTANT.
AS FAR AS THE ADVICE, I DID GIVE
HER A SUGGESTION.
I WOULDN'T SAY ADVICE.
I THINK SHE FOUND IT TOO BRUTAL.
I CAN SEE THAT.
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.
I DID GIVE HER A CERTAIN AMOUNT 
OF -- I GAVE HER A SUGGESTION, 
NOT ADVICE.
I WOULD GIVE HER A SUGGESTION.
I COULD FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY SHE
THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT 
TOUGH.
AND MAYBE SOME DAY SHE'LL DO 
THAT.
IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE RIGHT 
DEAL, SHE MAY VERY WELL DO WHAT 
I SUGGESTED SHE MIGHT WANT TO 
DO.
IT IS NOT AN EASY THING.
LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES HOW 
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE SYSTEMATICALLY OF THE 
UNITED STATES ON TRADE.
IT'S A DISGRACE.
IT'S NOT AN EASY NEGOTIATION.
>> JOHN, GO AHEAD, JOHN.
NO.
JOHN ROBERT, GO AHEAD.
CNN'S FAKE NEWS.
I DON'T TAKE QUESTIONS FROM CNN.
CNN IS FAKE NEWS.
I DON'T TAKE QUESTIONS FROM CNN.
JOHN ROBERTS OF FOX.
LET'S GO TO A REAL NETWORK. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THE 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND RUSSIA ARE AT THEIR 
LOWEST POINT SINCE THE END OF 
THE COLD WAR.
YOU HAVE STATED MANY, MANY TIMES
THAT YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH 
RUSSIA.
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
RUSSIA TO IMPROVE AS LONG AS 
PUTIN CONTINUES TO OCCUPY 
CRIMEA?
>> YES, I THINK SO.
I THINK I HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN IF WE SPEND TIME TOGETHER.
I MAY BE WRONG.
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT, BUT I'M DIFFERENT THAN
OTHER PEOPLE.
I THINK WE'RE BEING HURT VERY 
BADLY BY I WOULD CALL IT THE 
WITCH HUNT.
I WOULD CALL IT THE RIGGED WITCH
HUNT AFTER WATCHING SOME OF THE 
LITTLE CLIPS.
I DIDN'T GET TO WATCH TOO MUCH.
I'M HERE.
IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE.
AFTER WATCHING THE MAN THAT WAS 
TESTIFYING YESTERDAY, I'D CALL 
IT THE RIGGED WITCH HUNT, I 
THINK THAT REALLY HURTS OUR 
COUNTRY AND IT REALLY HURTS OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA.
I THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE A 
CHANCE TO HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND A 
VERY GOOD CHANCE, A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN.
I WOULD HOPE SO.
>> WHAT IS YOUR THINKING ABOUT 
IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA 
WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO ILLEGALLY
OCCUPY ANOTHER COUNTRY?
>> YES, THEY DO.
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CRIMEA, 
AGAIN, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA 
FAILED VERY BADLY WITH CRIMEA.
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE DONE
THAT IF I WERE PRESIDENT.
HE TOOK OVER CRIMEA DURING THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION I THINK YOU
WILL ADMIT.
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
I'M NOT BAD AT DOING THINGS.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT I'VE DONE 
COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE 
HAVE DONE 160 DAYS IN, THERE'S 
NOBODY EVEN CLOSE I DON'T 
BELIEVE.
SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT THIS WAS AN OBAMA DISASTER 
AND I THINK IF I WERE PRESIDENT 
THEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN 
OVER CRIMEA.
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
HE ESSENTIALLY TOOK OVER CRIMEA.
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE DONE
THAT WITH ME AS PRESIDENT, JOHN.
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW-UP, YOU 
HAVE TAKEN ON MANY THINGS YOU 
SAY YOUR LEFT WITH BY THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION THAT YOU SAY YOU 
HAVE FIXED.
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU INHERITED 
FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, 
THE OCCUPATION OF CRIMEA.
HOW DO YOU FIX IT?
>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS.
IT'S A PROCESS.
IF I KNEW, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU 
BECAUSE THAT WOULD PUT US AT A 
DISADVANTAGE.
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT ALL COMES OUT.
I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT CRIMEA WAS ANOTHER BAD HAND
I GOT HANDED NORTH KOREA.
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL.
YOU SAW THE LETTER YESTERDAY.
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL.
WE HAVEN'T HAD NUCLEAR TESTING.
WE HAVEN'T HAD MISSILE LAUNCHES.
WE HAVEN'T HAD ROCKET LAUNCHES.
SOME SITES WERE BLOWN UP.
WE GOT BACK MORE HOSTAGES, OUR 
PRISONERS EVEN BEFORE I LEFT.
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ARE 
HAPPENING.
THERE'S SOME GOOD FEELING.
IT'S PROBABLY A LONGER PROCESS 
THAN ANYBODY WOULD LIKE, BUT I'M
USED TO LONG PROCESSES TOO.
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN OFF THE 
SANCTIONS.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CRIMEA, 
THAT'S SOMETHING I TOOK OVER, 
JOHN.
THERE'S NOTHING MUCH I HAVE TO 
SAY ABOUT IT OTHER THAN WE WILL 
LOOK AT THAT JUST LIKE I'M 
LOOKING AT MANY OTHER DISASTERS 
THAT I'VE TAKEN OVER.
I'VE TAKEN OVER A LOT OF BAD 
HANDS AND I'M FIXING THEM ONE BY
ONE.
I KNOW HOW TO FIX THEM.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THAT HE 
MADE SUGGESTIONS TO YOU ON WHAT 
TO DO BREXIT.
CAN WE ASK IF YOU WOULD MAKE A 
SUGGESTION ON HIM HOW TO HANDLE 
HIS MEETING WITH PUTIN?
>> WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS
TODAY WHICH
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT GOES INTO THIS AS HE 
IS DOING, FROM A POSITION OF 
STRENGTH.
AND ALSO FROM A POSITION OF 
UNITY IN NATO.
I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE
ACTIVITY OF RUSSIA.
INCLUDING THE USE OF A NERVE 
AGENT HERE ON THE STREETS OF THE
UNITED KINGDOM AND THE IMPACT 
IT'S HAD.
I WELCOME THE STRONG RESPONSE 
THE UNITED STATES GAVE TO THAT.
WE HAD RESPONSE FROM AROUND THE 
WORLD.
I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING, IN 
PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE NATO 
SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT IS GOING 
INTO THIS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
PUTIN FROM THE POSITION OF 
STRENGTH AND UNITY AROUND THE 
NATO TABLE.
JASON?
>> THANK YOU, JASON GROSS, THE 
DAILY MAIL.
PRIME MINISTER, IN THE COMMENTS 
YESTERDAY, YOUR OWN MPs SORT OF 
SIDED WITH DONALD TRUMP, REALLY,
AND SAID THIS DEAL THAT YOU 
SIGNED HERE AT CLERKS IS GOING 
TO BE BAD FOR TRADE.
WHY CAN'T YOU CONVINCE YOUR OWN 
MPs IT'S A GOOD IDEA?
AND MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE SAID
BREXIT IS A TOUGH SITUATION.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO NOW?
WOULD YOU BE AT THE POINT TO 
WALK AWAY FROM TALKS TO SHOW 
THEM THAT YOU MEAN BUSINESS?
>> FIRST OF ALL, ON THE ISSUE OF
TRADE DEALS, AS I'VE SAID 
EARLIER, WHAT WE'RE -- 
NEGOTIATING AND WHEN WE COME OUT
OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, I WANT TO 
SEE AND WE WILL HAVE OUR ABILITY
TO HAVE INDEPENDENT TRADE 
POLICY.
SET OUR OWN TARIFFS.
TO BE AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF 
THE WTO.
TO NEGOTIATE AROUND THE WORLD.
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UNITED 
STATES AND OTHER AREAS.
WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE, 
THE -- POSSIBILITY OF SOME TRADE
DEALS AROUND THE PACIFIC AREA, 
TOO.
WE WILL KNOW GAUCHE YAT THOSE 
TRADE DEALS.
I WANT TO HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN 
UNION.
THE UNITED KINGDOM IS LOOKING 
FOR AND CAN KNOW NEGOTIATE A GO 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AND AROUND THE REST OF 
THE WORLD AS WELL.
THAT IS WHAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 
JOBS, PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS, 
PROSPERITY HERE IN THE UK.
>> WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER, I WAS 
OPENING TURNBERRY, THE DAY 
BEFORE BREXIT.
WE HAD AN UNBELIEVABLY LARGE 
NUMBER OF REPORTERS THERE.
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS THERE, I 
GUESS, BECAUSE OF BREXIT.
AND THEY ALL SHOWED UP ON THE 
9th HOLE, OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.
AND I SAID, WHAT'S GOING ON?
ALL THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT 
WAS BREXIT.
THEY ASKED MY OPINION.
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE, I SAID 
THAT I THINK BREXIT WILL HAPPEN.
AND IT DID HAPPEN.
WE CUT THE RIBBON.
THE REASON I FELT IT WOULD 
HAPPEN IS BECAUSE OF 
IMMIGRATION.
ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT ELECTED
WAS BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION.
I FELT BREXIT HAD THE UPPER 
HAND.
BARACK OBAMA SAID, WELL, YOUR 
COUNTRY WILL HAVE TO GET ON THE 
BACK OF THE LINE IF THAT 
HAPPENED.
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A TERRIBLE 
THING TO SAY, FRANKLY.
BUT I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS 
GOING TO HAPPEN.
AND IT DID HAPPEN.
AND I ALSO THINK THAT -- AS FAR 
AS NEGOTIATING THE DEAL, I 
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT MY
SUGGESTION WAS TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER.
BUT SHE CAN ALWAYS DO THAT.
SHE CAN DO THAT AT SOME POINT.
SHE CAN DO WHAT I SUGGESTED TO 
HER.
>> WOULD YOU WALK AWAY?
>> YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY.
IF SHE DOES THAT, SHE'S STUCK.
YOU CAN'T WALK AWAY.
YOU CAN DO OTHER THINGS.
SHE CAN DO WHAT MY SUGGESTION 
WAS.
AND MY SUGGESTION WAS 
RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.
SHE WILL DO VERY WELL.
THINK SHE'S A VERY TOUGH NE 
GAUCHE JYATER.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING HER.
SHE'S A SMART AND DETERMINED 
PERSON.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
LOOKING UP NOW SAYING, GEE, 
WHIZ, SHE LEFT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
IN HER WAKE.
SHE'S A VERY SMART, VERY TOUGH, 
VERY CAPABLE PERSON.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE HER AS 
MY FRIEND THAN AS MY ENEMY.
THAT, I CAN TELL YOU.
>> AND WE E ARE FRIENDS.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> JEFF MACE FRN REUTERS.
>> I LIKE YOUR HAT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> YOU WOULD LOOK GOOD WITHOUT 
IT.
>> THANK YOU, SIR.
GOING INTO YOUR MEETING.
>> TAKE IT OFF, JEFF.
PLEASE?
>> OH, BOY.
OKAY.
>> I LIKE YOU BETTER WITHOUT THE
HAT.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> THERE WE GO.
GOING INTO YOUR MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN ON MONDAY, SIR, 
YOU MENTIONED DENUCLEARIZATION 
AND SYRIA.
CAN YOU SAY WHAT YOUR MESSAGE 
WILL BE TO HIM ON SYRIA?
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE HIM TO SAY 
GIVEN ASSAD'S GAINS.
AND ON DENUCLEARIZATION CAN YOU 
SPELL OUT HOW YOU EXPECT IT TO 
HAPPEN?
>> IT WILL BE A SLOW PROCESS.
WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT 
HAVE NUKE.
IT WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS.
FOR US, OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO 
COME ALONGSIDELE TAN USELY.
I THINK THAT WHEN THE MEETING 
WAS ARRANGED, AND WE BOTH WANTED
THE MEETING, WHEN THE MEETING 
WAS ARRANGED, IT WAS FROM MY 
STANDPOINT, I DIDN'T GO IN WITH 
HIGH EXPECTATIONS.
YOU MAY COME OUT WITH SOMETHING 
EXCEPTIONAL.
BUT, THE PRO LIFE VAGS A 
TREMENDOUS -- I MEAN, TO ME, 
THEst THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE
WORLD.
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE WORLD.
I UNDERSTAND NUCLEAR.
LOOK UP DR. JOHN TRUMP AT M.I.T.
HE WAS MY UNCLE.
MANY, MANY YEARS A PROFESSOR.
I USED TO TALK NUCLEAR WITH HIM 
MANY H, MANY YEARS AGO.
IT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN MY 
OPINION, THIS WORLD HAS.
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING TO 
SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THEM?
I MEAN, IDEALLY GET RID OF THEM.
MAYBE THAT'S A DREAM.
BUT CERTAINLY, IT'S A SUBJECT 
I'LL BRING UP WITH HIM.
AND IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIEXPEN.
THAT'S THE LEAST IMPORTANT.
SO, IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING.
BUT, I DIDN'T GO IN -- I WAS 
TELLING THE PRIME MINISTER 
BEFORE.
I DIDN'T GO IN WITH HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS.
WE DO HAVE A -- A POLITICAL 
PROBLEM WHERE, YOU KNOW IN THE 
UNITED STATES, WE HAVE THIS 
STUPIDITY GOING ON.
PURE STUPIDITY.
IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DO 
SOMETHING WITH RUSSIA.
ANYTHING YOU DO, IT'S ALWAYS 
GOING THE TO BE, OH, RUSSIA, HE 
LOVES RUSSIA.
I LOVE THE UNITED STATES.
BUT I LOVE GETTING ALONG WITH 
RUSSIA.
AND CHINA.
AND OTHER COUNTRIES.
AND, IT WILL CERTAINLY BE, JEFF,
SOMETHING WE BRING UP AND TALK 
ABOUT.
I THINK, TO ME, IT'S SUCH A BIG 
PROBLEM.
SYRIA, OF COURSE, I'LL BRING 
THAT UP.
AND YUKRAINE.
AND OTHER SUBJECTS.
>> CAN YOU SPELL OUT WHAT YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM HIM ON 
SYRIA?
>> THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE.
THE RED LINE IN THE SAND WAS A 
PROBLEM FOR US.
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE PRESIDENT
PUTIN TO DO NOW UNDER YOUR 
WATCH?
>> I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM 
ABOUT THAT.
BEFORE I TALK TO YOU.
AND, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, IT 
WILL BE GREAT.
IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
I'M NOT GOING IN WITH HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS.
WE MAY COME OUT WITH VERY 
SURPRISING THINGS.
BUT RELATIONSHIP IS IMPORTANT.
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH 
RUSSIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES, I'VE
SAID A NUMBER OF TIMES.
FOR YEARS, I HAVE BEEN SAYING 
IT.
I SAID IT DURING MY CAMPAIGN.
HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES IS REALLY A GOOD 
THING.
I THINK THAT -- I CAN'T -- 
REALLY OVERESTIMATE HOW BIG THE 
MEETING WAS YESTERDAY WITH NATO.
WE WENT WITH SOMETHING THAT 
REALLY WAS AN UNFAIR SITUATION 
TO SOMETHING THAT IS UNIFIED.
I MEAN, THEY HAD SPIRIT.
THOSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING UP AND
WHERE WE ARE COMMITTING.
THEY CAN'T GO -- NOT LIKE THEY 
CAN GO IMMEDIATELY BACK.
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
PARLIAMENTS AND CONGRESSES AND 
REPRESENTATIVES.
WHATEVER FORUM THEY HAVE.
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN 
APPROVAL PROCESS.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, EVERY SINGLE
PERSON IN THE ROOM WAS GUNG HO 
TO GET IT DONE TO GET THE MONEY 
IN.
AND EVEN BEFORE THAT, AS YOU 
KNOW, $34 BILLION.
I THINK THE SECRETARY GENERAL 
WHO IS DOING A TERRIFIC JOB, BY 
THE WAY, HE SAID YESTERDAY THAT 
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE 
HAVE TAKEN IN $34 BILLION MORE 
FOR NATO.
I THINK THE NUMBER IS ACTUALLY 
MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT.
BUT $34 BILLION MORE, AT LEAST.
AND AGAIN, THAT'S NOTHING THAT 
MY OPPONENT WOULD HAVE DONE.
MY OPPONENT WOULD HAVE -- IT 
WOULD HAVE KEPT GOING DOWN.
IT WAS GOING DOWN.
YOU SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OVER 
THE YEARS.
THE NUMBERS WERE GOING DOWN.
NOW THE NUMBER'S WAY UP.
IT'S GOING WAY UP HIGHER.
AND THAT WAS, HE WILL TELL YOU 
THAT, THAT WAS BECAUSE OF ME.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP -- 
>> PRIME MINISTER MAY, THE 
PRESIDENT IN HIS TIME IN 
BRUSSELS EXPRESSED A CONCERN 
ABOUT A PIPELINE BETWEEN RUSSIA 
AND GERMANY.
DO YOU SHARE THOSE CONCERNS?
TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTIONING 
FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THE 
BRITISH PRESS AND THE AMERICAN 
SIDE, DID YOU FEEL UNDERMINED BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS IN 
THE SUN ABOUT THE BREXIT PLAN 
AND ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON?
>> NO, I'M VERY CLEAR THAT OUR 
BREXIT PLAN WILL DELIVER ON WHAT
THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE VOTED 
FOR.
WE HAVE HAD AN EXCELLENT 
DISCUSSION HERE.
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY AND THE 
INTENT THAT WE BOTH HAVE TO HAVE
AN AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL GOING 
FORWARD.
THAT'S WHERE WE'LL BE GOING.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH 
OF OUR COUNTRIES.
ACTUALLY.
WE STAND, WE HAVE STOOD SHOULDER
TO SHOULD WE ARE THE UNITED 
STATES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
OVER THE YEARS AS A RESULT OF 
OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP.
WE'LL SHOW THAT FURTHER THROUGH 
THE TRADE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE 
WOULD PUT IN PLACE IN THE 
FUTURE.
>> AND I HAVE TO JUST TO FIN IR 
OFF, JEFF, I HAVE TO SAY, I SAID
TO THE PAPER, "THE SUN," AND 
THEY SEEMED LIKE TWO VERY NICE 
PEOPLE.
BUT I SAID THAT -- THERESA 
MAY -- 
>> ONE OF THEM IS NICE?
>> ONE OF THEM IS SITTING HERE.
>> WHERE IS THAT PERSON?
DID I SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT 
THERESA MAY, PLEASE?
OH, GOOD.
IF YOU REPORTED THEM.
WHERE, ON THE INTERNET?
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
NO, I SAID VERY GOOD THINGS 
ABOUT HER.
I DIDN'T THINK THEY PUT IT IN.
I WISH THEY PUT THAT IN THE 
HEADLINE.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
AND SHE'S A TOTAL PROFESSIONAL.
I SAID THIS MORNING, I WANT TO 
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I SAID SUCH 
GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU.
SHE SAID, DON'T WORRY, IT'S ONLY
THE PRESS.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY 
PROFESSIONAL.
I MIGHT ADD, I MIGHT ADD -- IT'S
CALLED BEING -- THEY'VE BEEN 
DOING IT TO ME.
I'VE BEEN DOING TO IT THEM.
I DO SAY THOUGH THE PIPELINE.
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE PIPELINE.
TO ME, SIT A TRAGEDY.
I THINK IT'S A HORRIFIC THING 
THAT'S BEING DONE.
WHERE YOU'RE FEEDING BILLIONS 
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM 
GERMANY, PRIMARILY, AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES, BUT PRIMARILY FROM 
GERMANY INTO THE COFFERS OF 
RUSSIA.
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO 
SOMETHING SO THAT THERE IS PEACE
IN THE WORLD.
I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE THING 
THAT GERMANY IS DOING.
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.
AS MUCH AS I LIKE ANGELA, I WAS 
VERY OPEN IN SAYING IT.
I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE THING 
THAT YOU HAVE A PIPELINE COMING 
FROM RUSSIA.
AND I BELIEVE THAT GERMANY IS 
GOING TO BE GETTING 50, 60, I 
HAVE HEARD NUMBERS OF 70% OF 
THEIR ENERGY COMING IN FROM 
RUSSIA.
AND HOW CAN YOU BE -- WORKING 
FOR A PEACE AND WORKING FROM 
STRENGTH WHEN SOMEBODY HAS THAT 
KIND OF POWER OVER YOUR COUNTRY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD.
YOU'RE NOT WORKING FROM 
STRENGTH.
YOU HAVE GIVEN UP ALL OF YOUR 
STRENGTH.
IT'S BAD FOR GERMANY.
BAD FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE.
IT'S BAD FOR NATO, IF YOU WANT 
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
>> WE SAID WE WOULD TAKE FOUR 
QUESTIONS EACH.
WE HAVE TAKEN FOUR QUESTIONS 
EACH.
JUST ON THE PIPELINE ISSUE ON 
THE NORTH STREAM.
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE 
GERMANS ABOUT THIS.
TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITHIN THE 
EUROPEAN UNION ABOUT THIS.
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SIT AROUND 
THE EU TABLE, THIS IS MANAGER 
THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE 
EUROPEAN UNION TABLE.
WE'LL MAKE OUR VIEWS KNOWN 
THERE.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.
>> CAN YOU SHARE YOUR VIEWS WITH
US?
YOUR POSITION?
>> WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS 
WITH GERMANY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR HIS
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS 
HAPPENING.
ANGELA MERKEL MADE HER POSITION 
CLEAR.
WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THERE
ARE DISCUSSIONS TO BE HELD ON 
THE ISSUE OF NORTH STREAM TWO.
WE'RE TALKING TO OTHER COUNTRIES
WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION.
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT SAID 
EARLIER IN RESPONSE TO A 
QUESTION ABOUT A MEETING HE WAS 
GOING TO HAVE, THAT HE WOULD 
TELL YOU WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
AFTER THAT MEETING.
AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT COMES OUT 
FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION.
WHILE WE'RE A MEMBER OF THE EU.
WE STILL ARE UNTIL THE 27th OF 
MARCH, 2019.
AND THEN WE'RE LEAVING.
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALONGSIDE 
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA 
MAY.
A REMARKABLE 24 HOURS.
STANDING ALONGSIDE AFTER THE 
INTERVIEW WITH THE SUN, SAYING 
THAT THERESA MAY'S STANCE ON 
BREXIT WAS WRONG.
SHE WRECKED IT.
HE GAVE HER ADVICE HE SAYS SHE 
DID NOT TAKE.
OFFERED PRAISE FOR HER MAIN 
RIVAL, BORIS JOHNSON, AND SAID 
HE COULD HAVE HANDLED BREXIT 
BETTER.
THE FIRST QUESTION, MR. 
PRESIDENT, YOU CHANGED YOUR TUNE
HERE THIS MORNING.
IS THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF A F
FRIEND?
HE SAID, I DIDN'T CRITICIZE HER.
HE POINTED TO A RECORDING OF THE
INTERVIEW.
HE SAID TRADE IS TRICKY.
WHATEVER YOU DO, I SUPPORT IT.
IT'S UP TO YOU WHEN IT CAME TO 
BREXIT.
HE ALLUDED TO ADVICE.
THE SUGGESTION HE GAVE TO HER.
SAYING AT SOME POINT, PERHAPS, 
SHE'LL TAKE IT.
HE DID SAY THAT WHEN HE SAW HER 
THIS MORNING, HE SAID, I WANT TO
APOLOGIZE FOR THE HEADLINES THAT
GREETED THE FOLKS IN THE UK THIS
MORNING AFTER THAT INTERVIEW.
HE SAID THAT SHE TOLD HIM DON'T 
WORRY, IT'S JUST THE PRESS.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO OUR CHIEF 
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT TERRY 
MORAN.
THIS WAS SOMETHING TO SEE.
STANDING SIDE BY SIDE.
THEY MADE IT APPEAR THE 
RELATIONSHIP IS QUITE STRONG.
THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE 
JUXTAPOSITION OF THE INTERVIEW 
AND STANDING BESIDE HER TODAY 
SAYING SHE'S A GREAT LEADER.
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S BEEN 
HEAD-SPINNING, DAVID.
THE ENGLISH PEOPLE GOT A GOOD, 
LONG LOOK AT THE TRUMP SHOW.
WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING 
CONTROVERSIAL.
PUTS SOMETHING WAY OUT THERE.
THIS IS ALL ANYBODY IS TALKING 
ABOUT.
MAY WRECKED BREXIT.
U.S. DEAL IS OFF.
AND HE DID SAY THOSE THINGS IN 
THAT INTERVIEW.
TODAY WAS DAMAGE CONTROL.
TRYING TO GET BACK ON THE SAME 
PAGE.
AND YOU COULD SEE HOW THEY BOTH 
DECIDED TO HANDLE IT.
ALL IS GREAT.
IT MAY BE BETWEEN THE LEADERS 
AND THE GOVERNMENTS.
THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN TODAY ARE 
GOING TO HEAR THIS AND LOOK AT 
IT AND SAY, HE'S HUMILIATED OUR 
PRIME MINISTER.
SHE'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO 
ANSWER HIM BACK IN A WAY THAT 
BACKS HIM OFF FROM THESE KINDS 
OF COMMENTS.
WHILE MANY PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT 
HIS CALL FOR HARSHLY RESTRICTED 
IMMIGRATION, OTHERS WILL SAY 
IMMIGRATION HAS MADE BRITAIN 
STRONGER.
HE LEAVES A COUNTRY THAT THEIR 
HEAD IS SPINNING HERE FROM THE 
KINDS OF COMMENTS THAT HE'S 
MADE.
THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP HE PUTS
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SPECIAL.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING, WITH SPECIAL FRIENDS 
LIKE THIS -- WELL, YOU KNOW THE 
REST.
>> I WANT TO BRING?
JONATHAN KARL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIRLY 
STUNNING.
I DON'T RECALL A MOMENT LIKE 
THIS.
PERHAPS YOU DO.
WHERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES WOULD STAND NEXT 
TO THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
AND SAY THAT ANOTHER PERSON 
WOULD MAKE A GREAT PRIME 
MINISTER OF BRITAIN, BORIS J
JOHNSON, HER MAIN RIVAL.
HE SAID SHE'S A GREAT LEADER.
BORIS JOHNSON WOULD BE, TOO.
>> Reporter: THIS ENTIRE TRIP IS
UNLIKE ANYTHING WE WOULD SEE FOR
A U.S. PRESIDENT.
IN NATO, COMES IN, GUNS 
ABLAZING.
SAYING SOME OF THE MOST UP 
DIPLOMATIC THINGS WE HAVE SEEN A
U.S. PRESIDENT SAY.
LEAVING THE SUMMIT, PROCLAIMING 
EVERYBODY IS UNITED AND MORE 
UNITED THAN EVER.
THE SAME PATTERN HERE.
THIS EXTRAORDINARY BREACH OF 
PROTOCOL WITH "THE SUN" 
INTERVIEW THAT HE DID HOURS 
BEFORE SITTING DOWN WITH THERESA
MAY.
NOW COMING OUT AND SAYING OUR 
RELATIONSHIP IS THE MOST SPECIAL
ORM OF SPECIAL, SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIPS.
AN EXTRAORDINARY VISIT BY A 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT.
AS HE WAS LEAVING, HE WAS ASKED 
DIRECTLY, WILL YOU TELL PUTIN TO
STAY OUT OF U.S. ELECTIONS.
THE PRESIDENT LOOKED BACK AND HE
SAID, YES.
>> HE DID, IN FACT, SAY YES.
THANK YOU FOR ADDING THAT.
I SHOULD MENTION THAT DURING THE
PRESS CONFERENCE, JON, HE WAS 
ASKED WOULD HE BRING UP RUSSIAN 
MEDDLING.
HE SAID, DON'T E EXPERT A PERRY 
MASON MOMENT WHERE PUTIN SAYS, 
OH, YOU GOT ME THERE.
TRYING TO USE HUMOR.
HE GOES TO MEET WITH THE QUEEN 
NEXT TO SHARE TEA.
NO INTERVIEW ABOUT THE THE 
QUEEN.
HE WON'T HAVE TO CLEAN UP AFTER 
THAT.
>> I IMAGINE HE'LL BE ON HIS 
BEST BEHAVIOR WITH THE QUEEN.
>> FOR MORE OF YOU, "GOOD 
MORNING AMERICA" CONTINUES HERE 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
AND OF COURSE, I'LL SEE YOU FOR 
A COMPLETE WRAPUP TONIGHT ON 
"WORLD NEWS" TONIGHT.
I'M DAVID MUIR IN NEW YORK.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
>> Announcer: THIS HAS BEEN A 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
