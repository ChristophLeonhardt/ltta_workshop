1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,070
IT'S THE SECOND WEEK OF THE
REPUBLICAN ROLLOUT OF A NEW

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,620
TAX PLAN.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,830
AS WE TOLD YOU LAST WEEK, BEFORE
IT WAS REVEALED IT WAS WILDLY

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,290
UNPOPULAR.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,090
I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT 32%.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,350
IS EVEN WORSE NOW AND THERE ARE
A FEW REASONS FOR THAT.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,070
PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH THE
PROPAGANDA, THEY KNOW THIS IS

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,070
LARGELY A GIVEAWAY.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:31,730
60% OF 
AMERICANS SAID THIS

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,320
FAVORS THE WEALTHY.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,530
>>THEY DIDN'T READ IT IS THE
TRUTH OF IT.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,460
>> REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE
SOME OTHER PROBLEMS TO BECAUSE

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,690
THEY WERE REALLY HAVING TO
STRETCH THE MEANING OF WORDS.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,519
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE
TERM MIDDLE-CLASS.

15
00:00:55,519 --> 00:01:07,829
YOU SEE THERE IS A BENEFIT FOR
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES.

16
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:16,740
THEY 
SAY WE KEEP THE HIGHEST ONE

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,390
THE SAME, WHICH ISN'T TRUE,

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,520
THEY CHANGED HOW MANY PEOPLE
QUALIFY FOR THAT.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,860
THEY DROP DOWN THAT 35 FROM 39,

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,530
AND THEY INCLUDE IN THE LOW AND
MIDDLE INCOME CATEGORIES.

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,710
THE QUALIFY FOR THAT YOU HAVE TO
MAKE MORE THAN $450,000 WHICH

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,670
WOULD PUT YOU IN THE TOP .5% OF
ALL AMERICANS.

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,710
THAT IS MONEY WHERE YOU CAN LOOK
DOWN ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE

24
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,619
1%, THOSE BROKE BASTARDS.

25
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:56,380
I 
AM

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,310
DESTITUTE BY THOSE STANDARDS.

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:08,669
I CAN AFFORD TO SIT AT THIS
DESK.

28
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:17,920
>>MOST PEOPLE NEVER SEE $450,000
AS AN ANNUAL INCOME EVER.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,490
YOU HAVE THE STATISTICS.

30
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,990
99.5% WON'T SEE IT.

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,170
>> THE DEMOCRATS FINDING THIS,
THEY HAVE TO USE THIS STUFF.

32
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,160
IT IS SORT OF IN OUR DNA IS A
COUNTRY THAT WE ARE

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
ASPIRATIONAL.

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,280
WE'VE CONVINCED OURSELVES THAT
WE HAVE THIS AMERICAN DREAM

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,850
AND IF WE WORK HARD AND STUDY
AND SAVE, WE TOO CAN BE WEALTHY.

36
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,190
IT HASN'T BEEN TRUE IN 70

37
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,720
YEARS BUT WE STILL BELIEVE IT
AND THINK IT IS POSSIBLE.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,860
SO YOU CAN GET A LOT OF VAGUE
LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD JUST

39
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,650
SLIDE OVER THE ARMOR OF OUR
AMERICAN DREAM.

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,740
YOU CAN CONVINCE A GUY THAT HE
IS MIDDLE-CLASS BUT YOU

41
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,310
CAN'T CONVINCE HIM THAT HE MAKES
$450,000 A YEAR IF HE DOESN'T.

42
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,730
HE KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HIS SALARY AND THAT.

43
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,210
>> WE ARE DISTRACTED BY A LOT OF
THE RUSSIA CONVERSATION AND

44
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,400
THERE IS SOME FRESH MEAT SERVED
UP ALL THE TIME ON THAT.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,910
INDICTMENTS AND MORE RUMORS OF
INDICTMENTS.

46
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,530
IT TAKES US OFF THE TRAIL
BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE FRONT AND

47
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,530
CENTER.

48
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:39,190
IT IS A REAL MONEY GRAB.

49
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,070
WE DON'T HEAR ENOUGH ABOUT IT,
WE NEED TO DO MORE WITH THIS.

50
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,170
OPPOSITION NEEDS TO PLAY THIS
CARD IN A BIGGER WAY.

51
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,750
>> LAST FRIDAY WE BROKE DOWN THE
LIKELIHOOD THAT THE ENTIRE THING

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,850
COULD CRUMBLE BECAUSE OF HOW
AGGRESSIVELY GREEDY THEY ARE

53
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,270
BEING TAUGHT THEIR DESIRE TO NOT
JUST CUT CORPORATE TAXES DOWN BY

54
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,710
FIVE OR 8%, WHICH WOULD BE HUGE
FOR THOSE CORPORATIONS, BUT THE

55
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,310
NEED TO CUT IT EFFECTIVELY AND
HALF MEANS THEY WILL DRIVE

56
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,261
UP THE DEFICIT SO MUCH THAT THEY
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PASS

57
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:12,880
THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE OF THE
BIRD RULE.

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,480
THEY ARE JUST SO BRAZEN.

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,640
IS AMAZING WE ARE NOT ONE
MONTH INTO THIS NEW POWER

60
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,060
STRUCTURE WE HAVE OF THE
COUNTRY.

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,840
THE INCOMPETENCE MONTH AFTER
MONTH, AND THEY STILL THINK

62
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,400
WE GOT THIS.

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,460
IT MIGHT BE THE END FOR THEM.

64
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,260
BUT WE DO STILL HAVE TWO AS YOU
SAY KEEP ON IT BECAUSE IF THIS

65
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,340
PASSES IT IS NOT JUST A DISASTER
NOW, IT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR

66
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,190
THE NEXT FIVE OR 10 YEARS
BECAUSE WHEN YOU START RACKING

67
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,410
ON TRILLIONS MORE DOLLARS IN
DEFICITS PER YEAR, THINK OF

68
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,630
ALL THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS THAT
WILL HAVE TO BE CUT.

69
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:59,240
THEY WILL BE JUSTIFIABLY CUT TO
BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE.

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,380
WE CAN FORGET ABOUT THE
ASPIRATIONAL STUFF, EVEN

71
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,440
KEEPING WHAT WE HAVE NOW WOULD
BE IMPOSSIBLE IN MANY CASES

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,990
IF THIS TAX CUT GOES THROUGH.

73
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,440
>> THE FACT THAT IT IS GOING TO
BE A DEFICIT MAKER MAY BE

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,070
OUR ONLY HOPE FOR IT NOT
PASSING.

75
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,350
AS JOHN SAYS, THAT AUDLEY MAY BE
THE SAVING GRACE OF THIS BECAUSE

76
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,340
APART FROM THAT, IT IS LIKELY
THEY WILL PUSH IT THROUGH.

77
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,910
THEY DON'T CARE IF IT HAS
POPULAR SUPPORT.

78
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,380
THIS IS A CLEVER CREW.

79
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,750
THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS GOP
LEADERSHIP WHICH IS NOW IN BED

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,630
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION â€“ THEY
DON'T NEED TO SELL IT BECAUSE

81
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,220
THEY'VE GOT THEIR CADRE, WHICH
IS JUST THE GOP IN CONGRESS

82
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,310
AND THEY WILL PUSH THROUGH
WHATEVER.

83
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,450
THE MESSAGING THEY WILL LEAVE TO
DONALD TRUMP.

84
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,710
THAT MIDDLE-CLASS MESSAGING, IT
WILL JUST BE SPOONFED TO HIS

85
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,620
FOLLOWERS AND THEY WILL
REGURGITATE IT.

86
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,980
THAT IS WHY THAT HAS TO GET OUT
THERE.

87
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,570
THEY OUT MESSAGE US EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY.

88
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:18,430
>>BETWEEN US AND THAT AT THE
MIDDLE- 

89
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,430
YOU ARE RIGHT THEY

90
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,700
DON'T CARE THAT IT IS NOT
POPULAR, THEY DON'T EVEN

91
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:28,650
SEEM TO ACCEPT IT IS NOT
POPULAR.

92
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:36,170
ONE SET IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
POLLS THAT ONLY TALKS TO 1000 OR

93
00:06:36,170 --> 00:00:00,000
2000 PEOPLE?
