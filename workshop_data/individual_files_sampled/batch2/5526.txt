the President of the United States is now officially a subject of special prosecutor Robert Molly's investigation according to a breaking news report tonight in the Washington Post one of the authors of that report will join us in a moment Robert Costa your staffs in a federal criminal investigation is often clarified by your lawyers when investigators want to question you as we know Robert Muller has been seeking to question President Trump for months now and there are three possible status levels for someone prosecutors want to interview they are witness subject and target witness is the least dangerous status target is the most dangerous status target is exactly what it sounds like witness means you have something useful to say but are not implicated in a crime you're the driver for a limo service and you drove OJ Simpson to the airport at a particular time and it's very important to the investigators to know exactly what time you picked up Oh J that's all they want to know they are not investigating anything about you the driver they just want to know what time you picked up OJ that's the most innocent status witness subject is the middle status subject is more than a witness subject is someone whose conduct is being investigated but at this time is not apparently guilty of a crime but subject is a very dangerous dangerous status because when subjects go in to testify under oath they sometimes become targets because they end up giving prosecutors the kind of information that changes their status from subject to target they could also instantly become targets of perjury investigations if they don't tell the truth under oath so you don't ever want to hear that you are a subject of an investigation because subjects can can always become targets which is the only thing worse than being a subject targets then usually become accused defendants and so far in Robert Moses investigation that usually means they plead guilty the Washington Post is reporting tonight in private negotiations in early March about a possible presidential into you Muller described Trump as a subject of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election The Washington Post tonight contains other news that could be much more damaging to the Trump presidency it is this the special counsel also told Trump's lawyers that he is preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice according to two people with knowledge of the conversations if the special prosecutor believes that president Trump committed obstruction of justice in the presidency he might decide that the best way to deal with that is to leave it to Congress to consider as a possible cause for impeachment and the way special prosecutors deliver their findings to Congress for impeachment is through a written report The Washington Post has more motors investigators have indicated to the president's legal team that they are considering writing reports on their findings in stages with the first report focused on the obstruction issue according to two people briefed on the discussions under special council regulations Muller is required to report his conclusions confidentially to Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein who has the authority to decide whether to release the information publicly they've said they want to write a report on this to answer the public's questions and they need the president's interview as the last step one person familiar with the discussion said of Muller's team hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
