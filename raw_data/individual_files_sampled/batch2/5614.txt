we are back just as an exercise think for a moment about the top two top three issues facing this president and this White House just today just this week Robert Muller's Russia investigation the controversy let's not forget over White House security clearances that has now targeted his own son-in-law and let's not forget the issue of gun violence after last week's school shooting on top of that bad numbers for the president today in the latest Quinnipiac University poll 58% in other words most respondents disapprove of the president's job performance the other way of putting that 37 percent approval rating 57% don't like the president's policies 61% even said they don't like the president as a person the numbers get worse on the subject of Russia 76% think the Russian government tried to influence the 2016 presidential election 68% are very are somewhat concerned Russia could attempt to influence the upcoming 2018 midterms and most voters said they disapprove of President Trump's response to the threat of Russian interference in the upcoming elections with that we want to welcome to the broadcast to Lu Olo Renee Poe White House correspondent for Bloomberg and Vivian Salama our own national political reporter for NBC News - Lou the numbers it can be argued are going to suppress action because politicians with with depressed numbers have less traction when trying to get things through for starters in Congress yeah that's one argument when we have to remember that a lot of the traditional arguments about politics do not seem to apply to President Trump he tries to break the mold at times he does watch his poll numbers very closely and he cannot be happy with the fact that 58 percent of the country disapproves of the way he's handling his office and if you look even deeper into those numbers 52 percent of those people strongly disapprove so there's a there's a very intense dislike for the way the president is handling his job and that may force him to try to change his ways and maybe even buck his own party but what we've seen from the president so far sort of doubling down on his face the Republicans of which about 81 percent are still in support of what he's doing he really tried to consolidate that base not reach out and not really expand that base and that's caused him to continue embracing policies that are not very popular and it seems like that's the path that he wants to continue to go on even though he's starting to open up the possibility of doing some type of gun control he does seem to be still focusing on his base and yet vivian having covered him for so long a pattern you may find familiar you heard the russian numbers how bad they are he continues to go on offense that's right he he has yet to acknowledge the fact that the Russians may have influenced this election to the point that the outcome may have been influenced and this is something that now has been at the source of great controversy where the president has constantly said that the the any mention of a Russia investigation is a hoax essentially masquerading by the by the mainstream media and pushed by the Clinton supporters he and and look at the results Brian as some 18% of those who were polled agree with him and that is really astonishing after the intelligence community has come out and said that they believe the Russians have influenced the elections after President Trump's own National Security Adviser HR McMaster just last week said it and yet we still have a segment of the population that does side with the president that believe that it is not the case and that this is actually something that has just been made up by the media and by Democrats hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
