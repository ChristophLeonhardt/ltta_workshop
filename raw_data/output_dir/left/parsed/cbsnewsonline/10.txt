STATES SENATE, JACKY ROSEN.  
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD AND TAKE A 
SEAT. 
I'VE GOT A LOT TO SAY. 
NOW, FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO 
SAY THAT -- I MISS YOU, TOO! 
I DO. 
FIRST OF ALL, LOOK. 
I'M NOT ALONE IN SAYING I ENJOY 
COMING TO LAS VEGAS. 
OTHER AMERICANS ALSO ENJOY 
COMING TO VEGAS. 
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT 
RIGHT HERE IN VEGAS. 
SOME THINGS YOU SHOULDN'T WANT. 
A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOOD 
FOR YOU. 
OUTSTANDING FOOD. 
GREAT SHOWS. 
YOU NAME IT. 
AND THEN, WE BROUGHT SOME SHOWS 
HERE TODAY. 
WHO DOESN'T LOVE SALT N PEPA? 
WHO DOESN'T LOVE JAKE BALDWIN 
AND  REGGAETON? 
I WAS BACKSTAGE.  
FORTUNATELY THERE WERE NO 
CAMERAS WHEN I WAS GOING. 
SO, LAS VEGAS IS KNOWN FOR ITS 
HOSPITALITY. 
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS SPIRIT OF 
FUN. 
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS OUTSTANDING 
PEOPLE. 
IT'S KNOWN FOR ITS SUNNY 
WEATHER. 
BUT, THERE IS ONE OTHER THING 
THAT I WANT LAS VEGAS AND ALL 
OF NEVADA TO BE KNOWN FOR. 
AND THAT IS FOR VOTING. 
I WANT THIS TO BE THE CAPITAL OF
VOTING. 
I'M HERE JUST TO GET ONE THING  
FROM YOU. 
AND THAT IS FOR YOU TO VOTE. 
LOOK. 
THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTIONS ARE 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY I CAN 
REMEMBER IN MY LIFETIME. 
AND THAT INCLUDES WHEN I WAS ON 
THE BALLOT. 
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. 
POLITICIANS SAY EVERY TIME, 
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
ELECTION. 
THIS ONE IS REALLY THAT 
IMPORTANT. 
THE STAKES ARE HIGH. 
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANYBODY HERE
NOT TURNING OUT, AND DOING 
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET YOUR 
FRIENDS NEIGHBOR'S FAMILY TO 
TURN OUT, THE CONCERT IS -- 
CONSEQUENCES OF YOU STAYING 
HOME WOULD BE PROFOUNDLY 
DANGEROUS TO THIS COUNTRY, TO 
OUR DEMOCRACY. 
WE'VE HAD CHALLENGING MOMENTS 
BEFORE. 
DEMOCRACY HAS NEVER BEEN EASY. 
OUR FOUNDERS ARGUED ABOUT 
EVERYTHING. 
WE WAGED A CIVIL WAR FOR 
FREEDOM. 
WE OVERCAME A GREAT DEPRESSION. 
WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR WORKERS 
RIGHTS AND NEIGHBORS RIGHTS AND 
CIVIL RIGHTS AND LGBT RIGHTS. 
AND, THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE
WE WENT INTO EREZ OF 
CONSERVATIVE TREACHERY. 
AND, WE HAD TO FIGHT THAT MUCH 
HARDER FOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. 
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE 
TRAJECTORY OF AMERICA HAS BEEN 
ONE OF CONGRESS. 
BUT, THAT PROGRESS DID NOT 
HAPPEN BY ITSELF. 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY. 
IT WAS MADE BY  FOLKS   LIKE 
YOU.  
IT WASN'T MADE BY FOLKS WHO SAT 
BACK AND LET HISTORY JUST KIND 
OF HAPPEN. 
IT WAS MADE BY ORDINARY 
AMERICANS, WHO MARCHED, AND 
MOBILIZED, AND VOTED TO MAKE 
HISTORY HAPPEN. 
IT WAS MADE BY STUDENTS. 
HEADING SOUTH FOR FREEDOM RISE. 
IT WAS MADE BY UNION WORKERS, 
DECIDING, WE ARE GOING TO 
COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN TO HAVE A 
BETTER FUTURE. 
IT WAS MADE BY PEOPLE WHO TOOK 
RISKS, AND THEY DID NOT GET 
THEIR NAME UP IN LIGHTS. 
BUT THEY KNEW THEY WERE DOING 
THE RIGHT THING. 
IF NOT FOR THEMSELVES, THEN AT 
LEAST FOR THEIR KIDS. 
AND, EVERY TWO STEPS FORWARD 
THAT WE TOOK, SOMETIMES WE ARE 
TAKING A STEP BACK. 
YOU KNOW, YOU WIN THE RIGHT TO 
CREATE A UNION. 
AND THEN SUDDENLY, FOLKS COME 
UP WITH NEW WAYS TO TRY TO BUST 
UNIONS. 
YOU WIN A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE, 
THEN CONGRESS DOESN'T RAISE THE 
MINIMUM WAGE FOR MORE THAN A 
DECADE.  
YOU WIN THE RIGHT TO VOTE?  
PEOPLE TRY TO TAKE IT AWAY. 
EVERY TIME WE HAVE GOTTEN 
CLOSER TO OUR IDEAS, A COUNTRY 
THAT RECOGNIZES THAT ALL PEOPLE 
ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT WE ARE 
ALL ENDOWED WITH CERTAIN 
INALIENABLE RIGHTS BY OUR 
CREATOR. 
EVERY TIME WE HAVE TRIED TO 
MAKE THAT MANIFEST, MAKE THAT 
REAL, THE STATUS QUO PUSHES 
BACK. 
THE POWERFUL, THE PRIVILEGED. 
THEY FIGHT HARD TO KEEP WHAT 
THEY'VE GOT. 
AND, THEY LIKE TO TRY TO DIVIDE 
US. 
AND, THEY TRY TO MAKE YOU 
CYNICAL BECAUSE THAT HELPS YOU 
KEEP YOUR POWER AND KEEP 
PRIVILEGES. 
AND, WE ARE IN ONE OF THOSE 
MOMENTS RIGHT NOW. 
WE ALL RECOGNIZE IT. 
LOOK, WE DID NOT GET HERE 
OVERNIGHT. 
THE WORLD IS GOING THROUGH BIG 
CHANGES. 
ECONOMIC CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC 
CHANGES, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. 
IT'S CHALLENGE TO WE ARE AND 
WHAT WE STAND FOR AND HOW WE 
ADAPT TO THESE NEW 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
AND THE FACT IS, IS THAT SOME 
OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE BIG, 
AND THEY ARE TOUGH, AND THEY 
ARE HARD. 
AND WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED ALL OF 
THESE CHALLENGES. 
AND SO WHAT HAPPENSIS, PEOPLE 
GET SCARED. 
AND WHEN THEY GET SCARED, YOU 
SEE BACKLASH AGAINST PROGRESS. 
WHEN I WALKED IN THE OFFICE 10 
YEARS AGO, WE WERE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC 
CRISIS OF OUR LIFETIMES. 
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THE 
OTHER PARTY WAS IN CHARGE OF 
THINGS. 
I DO THINK IT'S INTERESTING. 
I JUST HOPE PEOPLE KIND OF 
NOTICE THAT EVERY TIME THERE IS 
A PATTERN, WHERE THEY KIND OF 
-- THEY RUN THINGS INTO THE 
GROUND AND WE HAVE TO COME BACK 
AND CLEAN THINGS UP. 
BUT, NEVADA WAS HIT AS HARD AS 
ANYPLACE. 
EVERYBODY HERE REMEMBERS. 
WILL NOT EVERYBODY, BECAUSE 
SOME OF YOU GUYS ARE REALLY 
YOUNG. 
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OLDER THAN 
15 REMEMBER. 
SORT OF. 
BUT, BECAUSE OF THE WORK WE 
DID, WORKING WITH PEOPLE LIKE 
HARRY REID, WHO I LOVE, WE GOT 
THE ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN. 
WE STARTED THE LONGEST STREAK 
OF JOB CREATION ON RECORD. 
WE COVERED ANOTHER 20 MILLION 
PEOPLE ON HEALTH INSURANCE. 
WE BROUGHT HOUSING BACK HERE IN 
NEVADA. 
WE CUT OUR DEFICITS BY MORE 
THAN A HALF. 
PARTLY BY MAKING SURE THE 
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, FOLKS 
LIKE ME, PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE 
OF TAXES. 
SO BY THE TIME I LEFT OFFICE, 
WAGES WERE RISING. 
UNINSURANCE RATES WERE FALLING. 
POVERTY WAS FALLING. 
AND THAT'S WHAT I HANDED OFF TO 
THE NEXT GUY. 
SO WHEN YOU HEAR ALL OF THIS 
TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC MIRACLES 
RIGHT NOW, REMEMBER. 
WHO STARTED IT? 
REMEMBER WHO STARTED IT. 
COME ON! 
NOW, THAT'S IMPORTANT TO 
REMEMBER. 
NOW, WE -- NOW LISTEN, THOUGH. 
THE FACT IS, EVEN FOR ALL WE 
DID, WE COULDN'T REVERSE FORTY-
YEAR TRENDS IN ONLY 8 YEARS. 
BECAUSE PART OF WHAT HAPPENED 
IS, REPUBLICANS TOOK OVER 
CONGRESS. 
THEY DECIDED TO BLOCK 
EVERYTHING I TRIED TO DO. 
EVERYTHING. 
EVEN STUFF THEY USE TO SUPPORT. 
THEY DIDN'T SUPPORT IT. 
NOW SUDDENLY THEY SUPPORT IT 
AGAIN. 
SO, WE PULLED THE ECONOMY OUT 
OF CRISIS. 
BUT YOU STILL HAD PEOPLE WHO 
WERE STRUGGLING. 
YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO ONCE 
FELT SOLIDLY MIDDLE-CLASS, AND 
NOW FELT MORE INSECURE. 
BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY AND LOSS 
OF MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
AND ALL OF THAT STUFF WAS STILL 
GOING ON. 
AND THAT WAS IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
OVERSEAS, WE TOOK OUT BIN 
LADEN. 
AND WE WOUND DOWN THE WORDS IN 
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND GOT IT 
TO HALT ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  
BUT THERE WERE STILL A LOT OF 
THREATS OUT THERE AND THAT MADE 
PEOPLE NERVOUS. 
AND SO, WITH ALL THESE 
CHALLENGES, A LOT OF FOLKS 
STARTED FEELING, YOU KNOW WHAT? 
CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN FAST 
ENOUGH. 
AND PEOPLE FELT MAYBE NOBODY 
WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. 
AND THEN THERE WAS ALL THIS 
MONEY BEING PUMPED INTO 
CAMPAIGNS BY THESE BIG 
BILLIONAIRE PACKS WHO WERE 
TRYING TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THE DEMOCRATS COME UP THEY 
DON'T REALLY THINK LIKE YOU OR 
LOOK LIKE YOU, OR BELIEVE THE 
SAME THINGS YOU DO. 
AND, WE'VE SEEN THAT PLAYBOOK 
BEFORE. 
AND SO, PEOPLE GOT CYNICAL. 
AND REPUBLICANS IN POWER WANT 
YOU TO FEEL CYNICAL. 
THEY WANT YOU NOT TO VOTE. 
INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE 
CHALLENGES THAT EXIST, THEY 
EXPLOIT SOME OF THE HISTORY 
THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, 
OF RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND 
RELIGIOUS DIVISIONS. 
AND, THEY TRY TO GET PEOPLE 
ANGRY. 
YOU KNOW? 
AND, THEY APPEAR -- APPEAL TO 
FEAR AND THEY TRY TO PIT ONE 
GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER. 
AND THEY TELL US THAT ORDER AND 
SECURITY IS GOING TO BE 
RESTORED AS LONG AS WE DON'T 
LET THOSE PEOPLE TAKE OVER, THE 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US 
OR SOUND LIKE US OR PRAY LIKE 
WE DO. 
THEY START TALKING ABOUT REAL 
AMERICANS, AS IF SOME OF US 
AREN'T REAL AMERICANS. 
NO, NO, NO. 
I MEAN, IT'S AN OLD PLAYBOOK. 
AND YOU SEE, THE CLOSER WE GET 
TO ELECTION DAY, THE MORE YOU 
ARE SEEING FOLKS RESORT TO THAT.
NOW, IN A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, 
THAT KIND OF STUFF DOESN'T WORK.
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS, PEOPLE 
OF GOODWILL IN BOTH PARTIES 
START CALLING OUT BIGGEST AND 
FEAR MONGERS AND THEY WORK TO 
COMPROMISE. 
THEY WORK TO GET THINGS DONE. 
THE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS CAUCUS. 
YOU KNOW? 
-- STARTS KICKING IN. 
BUT WHEN THERE IS A VACUUM IN 
OUR DEMOCRACY, WHEN WE DON'T 
VOTE, WHEN WE TAKE OUR RIGHTS 
FOR GRANTED, WE TURN THE OTHER 
WAY TO POLITICS BECAUSE WE 
THINK IT'S UGLY AND MESSY AND 
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. 
THAT'S WHEN THE VOICES FILL IN 
THE VOID. 
AND DEMAGOGUES START PROMISING 
SIMPLE FIXES TO LOOK INTO 
PROBLEMS. 
THE PROMISE TO FIGHT FOR THE 
LITTLE GUY AND THEN THEY TURN 
AROUND AND ARE HELPING 
CORPORATIONS AND BILLIONAIRES 
AND THE MOST POWERFUL DO THEIR 
BIDDING. 
NO PLACE TO TAKE ON CORRUPTION, 
AND THEN THEY JUST PLUNDER AWAY.
AND THEY START UNDERMINING SOME 
OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE 
ESSENTIAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. 
THEY MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOUNG 
PEOPLE AND MINORITIES AND THE 
POOR TO VOTE. 
AND THAT ENTRENCHES THEIR POWER 
FURTHER. 
THERE ARE STATES WHERE 
REPUBLICANS ARE ACTIVELY 
PURGING VOTER ROLLS RIGHT NOW. 
WHERE THEY HAVE TRIED TO SAY 
THAT STUDENTS, AND COLLEGE 
STUDENTS OPERATE UNDER 
DIFFERENT RULES THAN OTHERS AND 
MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO 
VOTE. 
AND, LOOK, I HAVE TO SAY THAT, 
THIS KIND OF POLITICS, IT'S NOT 
ACTUALLY CONSERVATIVE. 
IT'S A RADICAL. 
IT'S A VISION THAT SAYS, WE ARE 
GOING TO PROTECT OUR POWER NO 
MATTER WHAT. 
EVEN IF IT HURTS THE COUNTRY. 
WE ARE GOING TO DIVIDE THE 
COUNTRY AND MAKE EVERYBODY 
ANGRY, EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW 
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO 
HELP CREATE JOBS OR PUT FOOD ON 
THE TABLE OR PAY THE RENT OR 
MAKE SURE THAT HEALTHCARE IS 
PROTECTED. 
IT'S A VISION WHERE THE FEW 
PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD THOSE 
HIGH-PRICED LOBBYISTS AND 
UNLIMITED CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTIONS, THEY SET THE 
AGENDA. 
AND RATHER THAN BE A CHECK OR A 
BALANCE ON THIS KIND OF CORRUPT 
POLITICS, YOU'VE GOT 
REPUBLICANS WHO BEND OVER 
BACKWARDS TO SHIELD IT FROM 
SCRUTINY AND A BAND-AID OF 
CONSEQUENCES. 
JUST LIKE JACKY WAS SAYING. 
THE CURRENT SENATOR,  HE GOES 
ALONG WITH THIS EVEN WHEN HE 
GETS THE SENSE THAT IT'S NOT 
RIGHT. 
BUT IT'S OKAY. 
HE JUST GOES AHEAD AND GOES A 
LONG. 
SO, THAT'S THE MOMENT WE ARE 
IN. 
BUT, HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS 
TODAY. 
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT A CHANCE 
TO RESTORE SOME SANITY TO OUR 
POLITICS. 
RIGHT NOW, WE CAN TIP THE 
BALANCE OF POWER. 
BACK TO YOU, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, THERE IS 
ONLY ONE REAL CHECK ON ABUSES 
OF POWER. 
THERE IS ONLY ONE CHECK ON BAD 
POLICY. 
AND THAT IS YOU AND YOUR VOTE. 
YOU. 
AND, YOU KNOW, THE GREAT THING, 
IN NEVADA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
WAIT TWO WEEKS. 
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND VOTE RIGHT 
NOW. 
IN NEVADA, EARLY VOTING IS 
ALREADY UNDERWAY. 
YOU CAN VOTE AT ANY EARLY 
VOTING SITE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT 
IS, JUST GO TO VOTENVDEMS.COM.  
FIND OUT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE. 
SO, THERE IS NO REASON TO 
OVERCOMPLICATE STUFF. 
SOMETIMES I THINK DEMOCRATS DO. 
JUST, LIKE, THEY'RE ANALYZING 
STUFF. 
JUST VOTE! 
AND, IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO VOTE, LOOK AT WHAT 
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE THESE 
PAST 2 YEARS. 
LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 
THEY ARE GOING TO DO IF YOU 
SEND THEM BACK TO DO MORE. 
HERE IS JUST ONE SIMPLE FACT. 
THIS IS A FACT. 
THIS IS NOT -- UNLIKE SOME, I 
ACTUALLY TRY TO STATE FACTS. 
I BELIEVE IN FACT. 
ALL RIGHT? 
I BELIEVE IN A FACT-BASED 
REALITY. 
AND, A FACT-BASED POLITICS. 
I DON'T BELIEVE IN JUST MAKING 
STUFF UP. 
I BELIEVE IN ACTUALLY JUST 
SAYING TO PEOPLE WHAT'S TRUE. 
SO, HERE'S WHAT'S TRUE. 
THEY HAND IT OUT. 
$1.5 TRILLION IN TAX CUTS. 
AND COMING TO BILLIONAIRES AND 
CORPORATIONS. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
IT WAS NOT DONE FOR YOU. 
$1.5 TRILLION. 
THEY DIDN'T EVEN PRETEND TO PAY 
FOR. 
DEFICITS SHOT UP. 
WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT, AND I WAS 
TRYING TO FUND EARLY CHILDHOOD 
EDUCATION, OR TRYING TO FUND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY WOULD SAY, 
NO, NO. 
WE CAN'T DO THAT. 
DEFICITS ARE TOO HIGH. 
IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. 
THEN SUDDENLY, WHEN IT COMES TO 
GIVING 1,000,000,000,000 1/2 
DOLLARS, FOR FOLKS WHO ARE 
ALREADY SITTING PRETTY,DON'T 
NEED IT, WEREN'T EVEN ASKING 
FOR IT, SUDDENLY   DEFICITS ARE 
NO PROBLEM. 
DON'T EVEN TRY TO PAY FOR IT. 
DON'T PRETEND TO PAY FOR IT. 
EXCEPT JUST LAST WEEK. 
THE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICANS 
IN CONGRESS -- 
>> AND WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA 
AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN LAS 
VEGAS, IN SUPPORT OF NEVADA 
DEMOCRATS. 
CHIEF AMONG THEM JACKY ROSEN 
WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST  GOP AND 
COMPANY SENATOR DEAN HELLER. 
AND WE HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN FOR HIM, FOR HELLER ON 
SATURDAY, WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
WAS IN NEVADA. 
LOTS OF FEVERISH CAMPAIGNING 
GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH  
MIDTERMS RIGHT AROUND THE 
CORNER. 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT BLASTED 
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION FOR 
MANY THINGS, INCLUDING FEAR 
MONGERING AND PITTING GROUPS 
AGAINST EACH OTHER. 
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE 
ON THIS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE BREAK. 
SO STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
