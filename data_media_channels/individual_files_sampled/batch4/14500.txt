so now we have the brexit checkers plan what happens next let me try and break this down after multiple government resignations the brexit Chequers plan seems to be just about hanging in there but this isn't the end this still isn't the end of breaks it the House of Commons has to pass this Agreement again in order for it to come into effect and there are questions about whether it will even happen now I reported on Monday that Cabinet Office minister David Livington was briefing members of parliament from Labour s MP and the Liberal Democrats on the checkers deal while the resignations from the Tories were taking place and I don't know about you but it sounds to me that to reason May is concerned about getting votes from even her own party and is now looking across to the other side of the Commons for support the question is whether she can get enough support in her own party to pass the bill and whether the DUP will be on her side as well remember the DUP of safety brags it a few times already and this might be another sticking point for those conservatives in Northern Ireland who are basically propping up two resumes government so Theresa May is concerned about support in their own party and I think she has good reason to the Financial Times reported on the 9th of July the upheaval is at an early stage and much hangs on events later today most notably the Prime Minister's personal performance in the House of Commons on her meeting the Tory MPs but the initial impressions are that mrs. may should survive the storm at Westminster for now the much bigger doubt arising out of the past 24 hours is whether a brexit deal on the lines mrs. May is proposing can possibly be passed by the Commons this autumn furthermore The Times reported that a tiny number of Tory rebels would be enough to sink drags it in a vote in the House of Commons they reported as few as 6 Tory MPs voting against mrs. Mays final deal would defeat it in the autumn assuming that the DUP voted with the government but the opposition is united in rejecting it one cabinet minister told The Times quote I think that the checkers compromise is going to be voted down the Commons I can't see how labor don't reject it outright I think there's a quite a good chance nobody gets what they want and it's not clear where that leaves us end quote another cabinet minister acknowledged that this was a real chance they said that mrs. Mays best hope was to warn brexit ears that voting against her deal would result in chaos and no deal would allow Jeremy Corbyn into power quote we need to convince the breaks of tears that we've left and that we will diverge but this will take 15 years not 1 we can't do it in one leap but we will get what they want did you hear that 15 years not 1 year 15 years are we really meant to believe that actually if we just pass through the checkers deal it's fine don't worry guys let's just pass it for now and then within the next 15 years the politicians are going to start making changes so that we actually get Briggs it if they're not gonna give us Briggs it now they're not gonna give us Briggs in the next 15 years so what happens next it really depends some Pro brexit Tories are giving Theresa May a week to drop the plan or face a no-confidence vote so not only is the checkers deal at risk great but there might be a change in leadership the checkers deal isn't the end of Bragg's it the final agreement still has to be voted on in the Commons this autumn as part of the withdrawal agreement and implementation bill that's the name of a future bill that will enshrine the withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU into domestic law now the question now is can the Tory rebels bring down to resume in a vote of no-confidence or can enough of them vote against the checkers deal to force them to do better and actually implement Bragg's it and there's another question if the House of Commons does vote down the checkers deal this autumn assuming that Theresa May hasn't stepped down by then will the government be brave enough to redraft the entire thing and implement a real bragg's it and will the House of Commons vote in favor of that one as well there's also the question of what will we just face a No Deal situation where we trade on WTO rules that would be favorable for many breaks or tears but will it even happen the next step for brexit is yet another vote in the Commons with MPs battling to either improve the checkers deal to something that resembles breaks it or make it even worse and essentially keep us in the EU if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
