so in the midst of Rex Tillerson getting fired there was an undersecretary at at the State Department his name was Steve Goldstein and he pointed out something that was true oh that's not a good idea on the Trump administration so let's go that story Ken Meier reporting at meteorite shortly after Tilson's Aleister was publicly confirmed State Department undersecretary public diplomacy Steve Goldstein released a statement saying Tillerson never spoke to Trump about today's decision and had every intention of remaining in his position now that's uncomfortable for the Trump administration they wanted to pretend that Trump was a decent person and actually called Tillerson instead of just sending a public tweet and having him find out that way well when Goldstein exposes that live and not happy about that so as Maya continues to explain this directly challenges the notion that the White House told the secretary he would be phased out and it also rebukes what Trump said about how he until should have spoken about this for a quote a long time so the tweet might have been previewed by chief staff John Kelly earlier Friday and Saturday that's reporting out today as well so Tillison might have known that it was coming but Trump never actually did the decent thing of picking up the phone and telling him no he just sent the tweet after tilson made the comments about how Russia almost certainly poisoned their ex-agent in the United Kingdom and then he angrily Trump sends out the tweet later wants to pretend that he did the right thing Goldstein exposes that so what happens to Goldstein Associated Press braking officials white house fires top Tillerson aide who contradicted account of Secretary of State's dismissal and then go see confirms it so Dave Clark at AFP reporting under Secretary of State Steve Golson confirms he was sacked quote this has been the honor of my lifetime I look forward to getting some rest and he will so god help you if in the Trump administration you ever make the mistake of telling the truth what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it and you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
