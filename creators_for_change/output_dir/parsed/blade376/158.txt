hi guys miles here how's it going you
might know it's st. different about me
oh you haven't well I'm wearing a horse
head on right now yeah awkward basically
the reason why is i have sent to reveal
to you know over the years i received
lots of hater comments you know your
 get haircut go kill
yourself might get a bit of a
theme running there but yet the reason
I've never had my hair show over the
past few years is because it always
makes me look five years younger so when
I was 18 I didn't want to look 13 but
now i'm 23 i get i guess it doesn't
matter so much so without further ado I
perhaps I'm a but I definitely
did go and get a haircut and this is
what it looked like yeah this is my hair
right now so it's going to take a bit of
getting used to I'm still trying to get
used to it I do look a bit younger right
I don't know I think it was an
insecurity thing because the other
reason I had long hair was it covered a
bit more of my face and I never really
liked the way that's when I was younger
but I guess now I'm a bit more confident
in myself like my last video I don't
mind showing a bit more of my face so I
did get my hair cut and hopefully I'd
you know you guys can what oh I'm still
a and my hair's still
we would have like this I made an effort
for you for you guys
