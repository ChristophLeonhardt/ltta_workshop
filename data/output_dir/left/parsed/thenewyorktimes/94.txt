This is Buenos Aires.
Hundreds of thousands
took to the streets
as the Senate prepared
to vote on a proposed law
to legalize abortion.
Argentines are
starkly divided.
Supporters of the bill wear
green scarves, the color
of the feminist movement.
Opponents wear blue, the
color of the national flag.
After 16 hours of
deliberations in the Senate,
the bill was
narrowly rejected.
Still, the fact
that the discussion
came this far signals a real
shift in public opinion.
Activists like Marta Dillon
say it’s progress that
cannot be undone.
Marta is a leader of
“Ni una menos,”
a feminist campaign that
started three years
ago and has grown
into a nationwide movement.
Feminist organizations
pushed to legalize abortion,
and against all odds,
nearly succeeded.
But Argentina’s overwhelmingly
Catholic and conservative.
Even among people
who are not religious,
many reject abortion
on moral grounds.
The persistence of the
abortion rights movement
has forced its opponents,
including church officials,
to confront an
uncomfortable reality:
Criminalizing the issue
does not make it disappear.
In the slums of
Buenos Aires,
Hernan Martín is
helping to start
maternity houses
for pregnant women
to curb the number
number of abortions
in poor neighborhoods.
Abortion is illegal here,
except in cases of rape
or when a pregnancy
threatens a woman’s health.
According to the government,
there are nearly 350,000
clandestine abortions per year.
And they are the
principal cause
of maternal death
in Argentina.
But many women
still take the risk.
We met this patient at
a clinic in Buenos Aires.
She was unemployed
with two children when
she got pregnant and
started looking for a way
to have an abortion.
It took her 20 weeks.
The go-to method
for abortion in Argentina
is misoprostol,
a drug that was
originally developed
to treat stomach ulcers.
Helping women
access this drug are
so-called socorristas,
or first responders,
like Diana.
Diana is part of
an expansive network
of doctors, hospitals
and activists —
some working covertly —
to help women get around
legal obstacles.
But outside of
metropolitan areas,
it becomes more difficult for
women to access these groups.
We went to Salta, a region
in the northwestern corner
of Argentina, where life
is more traditional.
Monica Gelsi worked for
30 years as a gynecologist here
and never once considered
performing an abortion.
Abortion laws
in Latin America
remain some of the most
restrictive in the world.
But the drama
of the vote here
reveals a broader
cultural struggle
unfolding in Argentina
and across the region.
