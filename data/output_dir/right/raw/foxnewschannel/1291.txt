1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:01,582
MESSAGE TO THE YOUNG LEADER.

2
00:00:01,582 --> 00:00:04,252
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:06,954
COLONEL, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

4
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:08,589
COLONEL BOB SERVED OUR COUNTRY

5
00:00:08,589 --> 00:00:09,390
NOTABLY HERE.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,427
THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS

7
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:15,296
NOBLY GREETED IN THE FINANCIAL

8
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:15,630
MARKETS.

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,697
THE PRESIDENT MAKING GOOD ON

10
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:18,266
TARIFF THREATS WITH COUNTRIES

11
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,635
THAT SEND US A LOT OF STEEL AND

12
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,269
ALUMINUM.

13
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,738
25% TARIFF ON STEEL-RELATED

14
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:25,006
PRODUCTS.

15
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:25,973
10% ON ALUMINUM.

16
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:28,042
THIS ISN'T REALLY AN OPENING

17
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,311
SALVO TO CHINA.

18
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:34,315
IT'S MEANT MORE TO HURT THE

19
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:35,349
MEXICANS AND CANADIANS.

20
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:37,418
NONE OF THEM LIKE IT.

21
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:39,020
GERMANY PLANNING A RESPONSE.

22
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,055
THE MEXICANS HAVE BEEN QUIET BUT

23
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:42,290
THEY'RE NOT GOING QUIETLY WHEN

24
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,393
IT COMES TO A RESPONSE.

25
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:48,763
THE FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT

26
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:51,966
OFFICIAL, ANYET EMANUEL.

27
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:57,271
THE MARKETS FELL OFF ON THIS

28
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:57,572
NEWS.

29
00:00:57,572 --> 00:01:00,308
IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE WAS WAS

30
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:03,377
GOING TO DO IT.

31
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:04,578
NOW HE DID WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:08,015
>> SLAPPING TARIFFS ON YOUR

33
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:12,820
CLOSEST ALLIES IS NOT A SMART

34
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,154
POLICY.

35
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:14,622
THE CHINESE ARE CHEATING.

36
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:15,890
THEY'RE PLAYING A HUNDRED YEAR

37
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,190
GAME.

38
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,358
THEY'RE FOCUSING ON INDUSTRIES

39
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:29,337
OF THE FUTURE,

40
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:30,071
THEY'RE FOCUSING ON INDUSTRIES

41
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:30,638
OF THE FUTURE, ROBOTS,

42
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:32,073
AEROSPACE.

43
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:33,641
WE NEED TO PUSH BACK ON CHINA.

44
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:36,577
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO GO.

45
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:37,745
>> Neil: MAYBE THERE'S A METHOD

46
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,013
TO THIS THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING

47
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:40,882
OR I'M NOT SEEING, THAT THE

48
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:43,351
PRESIDENT HOPING TO GET THESE

49
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:49,490
COUNTRIES OF MEXICO AND CANADA,

50
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,424
EUROPE, BACK TO THE TABLE WITH

51
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:50,791
SOMETHING.

52
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,360
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

53
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,862
>> I HOPE THAT'S THE CASE.

54
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:57,164
FROM THE FOLKS THAT I SPEAK TO

55
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:59,033
IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO

56
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,501
IN THE GOVERNMENT AND EUROPE AND

57
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,436
CANADA AND MEXICO, THAT DOESN'T

58
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:05,206
SEEM TO BE THE CASE.

59
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,375
THEY ARE PUSHING HARD TO FINISH

60
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,577
THE NAFTA NEGOTIATION.

61
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:10,945
THAT IS QUITE GOOD.

62
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:14,982
IT WOULD BE REALLY WORRYING IF

63
00:02:14,982 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR BRINKSMANSHIP ON TRADE IN
