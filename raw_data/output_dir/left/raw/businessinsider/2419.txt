00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:14,750
first of all is innovation dead are we

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,759
in trouble it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> country no I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

3
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:18,590
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at all you know the</font>

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,970
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the US has going forward</font>

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,529
certainly in the technology space I

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,060
don't want to speak for biotech or other

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,400
areas but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology space there's a</font>

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of innovation there are a lot of</font>

9
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,250
startups there's a tremendous amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,849
money available in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> venture capital</font>

11
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,070
portfolios in their funds so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,150
worried about that the US has been a

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,820
leader in digital media by far and I

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think will continue to be now you go</font>

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago though there was a</font>

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,210
frenzy of investment and suddenly it was

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,760
the dot-com bubble<font color="#E5E5E5"> was back tons of</font>

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,049
venture capital money going into this

19
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,750
now it seems like venture capitals or in

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,100
the fetal position they're not investing

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,629
anything and yet you're saying there's

22
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:54,979
tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money available or how do you</font>

23
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,070
reconcile that well there's investing is

24
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,900
always cyclical and it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to</font>

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">be so and it's partly for economic</font>

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,739
reasons and it's partly for technology

27
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,030
development reasons sometimes our little

28
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,770
breakthroughs and people say oh yeah

29
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,030
there's a sector being created here

30
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be worth hundreds of</font>

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,610
millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars or billions of</font>

32
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,720
dollars so it makes sense that money

33
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,490
would go into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can have</font>

34
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,010
low periods but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,540
money available you know we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

36
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">process of raising money for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gilts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

37
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,650
found it very easy five term sheets took

38
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,900
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks able to raise about 40</font>

39
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,430
million dollars so there's money out

40
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,840
there even if it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit less</font>

41
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,730
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was last year and Marc</font>

42
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,830
Andreessen who obviously has done a huge

43
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,300
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovation on his own has</font>

44
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,680
recently said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a</font>

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,420
third of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the venture capital business is</font>

46
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,940
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business again that's</font>

47
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,320
not going to threaten us where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

48
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,460
actually a good thing because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

49
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,780
suddenly starts to rational do you mean

50
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,040
the venture capital firms actually

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely yeah why that's another way</font>

52
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,340
of saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a lot of money</font>

53
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there actually and so there's no</font>

54
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,690
shortage of money there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no shortage of</font>

55
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,060
startups you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find actually as an</font>

56
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,159
entrepreneur the challenges often if I

57
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,050
start something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there are five</font>

58
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,240
or eight or nine other companies doing

59
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,430
the same thing so it may be a problem

60
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,170
for venture capitalists because it's

61
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,930
hard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to make money on all those</font>

62
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,310
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> good from an innovation point</font>

63
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,720
of view there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of competitors</font>

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,919
they'll be consolidation over time

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,930
that's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case nothing has</font>

66
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,280
really changed that much in 20 years

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,590
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of competitors a lot of</font>

68
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,150
them go out of business and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

69
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the day</font>

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,520
of that crucible we end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

71
00:02:20,520 --> 00:00:00,000
the best companies
