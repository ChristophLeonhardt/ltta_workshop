1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,862
- Do you think Democrats
on the national level,

2
00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:03,195
some of which you have
said were committed to

3
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:06,094
more open borders, are willing to find

4
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:09,635
a middle ground in a rational approach?

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,786
- Jessica's approach
certainly sounds rational,

6
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:13,883
as do the Democrats
when they talk about it,

7
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,367
but when it actually comes
to enforcing immigration law

8
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,808
they fail.

9
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:19,469
They refuse to do it because we know that

10
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,008
they rely on these votes right
now in the United States.

11
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,248
Donald Trump has
identified a simple issue,

12
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,739
which is that illegal
immigration is illegal.

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,167
We know that this is a winner
with the American people,

14
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,904
we know that the majority of Americans,

15
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,758
including the majority of Democrats,

16
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:37,538
do not think that giving
amnesty to illegal aliens

17
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,322
should be a priority for Congress.

18
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:41,909
And yet, Democrats rely on these votes

19
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,487
as an electoral strategy.

20
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:45,927
We know the Center for American
Progress admitted this,

21
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:48,616
we know that between three, excuse me,

22
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:52,746
and 8.75% of illegal aliens
and Hispanic immigrants

23
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:55,401
identify with Democrats over Republicans

24
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:56,606
so you're gonna see Democrats

25
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,378
continue to push this strategy.

26
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:00,691
They push for wholesale
importation of foreigners,

27
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,635
they push for enfranchising felons,

28
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,263
they push for lowering the voting age.

29
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:05,450
The Democrat base has become

30
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,070
felons, foreigners, and children

31
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,068
that's a winner for Democrats
if they can get it through

32
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:12,328
but the American people, I
think, can see through it.

33
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:13,161
- Jess is a political...

34
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,568
- Michael, it's Sunday
morning, there's so many

35
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:16,325
offensive things to be saying so early.

36
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:17,555
I don't understand how illegal...

37
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:18,388
- But what's offensive about that?

38
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:19,221
- How illegals, what?

39
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,371
- Is it offensive or is it
just politically incorrect?

40
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,549
- Oh, calling the Democratic base felons?

41
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,732
It's so wrong.

42
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,288
- Well, I think he's referring to...

43
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,547
Jessica, what he's referring
to is criminal justice reform.

44
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,380
He's putting it differently.

45
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,213
- Which is a good thing.

46
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:32,271
That Republicans and Democrats...

47
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:33,584
- Well, not all Republicans support that.

48
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:35,353
- Oh, well, a lot of them do actually,

49
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:37,153
and you have actually
been leading the way there

50
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:38,538
if you look at what Tim
Scott and Newt Gingrich

51
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:39,371
are doing.

52
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,068
But when you say that the
Center for American Progress

53
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,802
has admitted that our strategy is to have

54
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,918
illegal aliens vote, what
are you talking about?

55
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:46,355
There's no massive voter
fraud scheme in here.

56
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,617
- I'm talking about the
leaked memorandum that said...

57
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:49,761
- That said what?

58
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,544
- I'm talking about a
leaked memorandum that said

59
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,348
that it is key to the
electoral strategy of Democrats

60
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:58,566
to provide amnesty, particularly
for young illegal aliens...

61
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,399
- [Brian] It was an admission.

62
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,232
- So they can vote?

63
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:01,231
- And because we know that
they identify with Democrats.

64
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,722
- Are you saying that illegal aliens

65
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,390
are voting in this country?

66
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,727
- No, but they will vote,
and if they do vote...

67
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,777
- Amnesty and citizenship are different.

68
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,518
- If they are given pass to
vote they'll vote for Democrats.

69
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:12,520
- Amnesty and citizenship are different...

70
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,649
- Amnesty and citizenship
are very different,

71
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:15,431
first of all, and majority...

72
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,457
- Most Democrats, Jessica,
would seek citizenship

73
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:21,065
as an eventual result of
amnesty if they could, correct?

74
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,226
- I'm sure, down the line,

75
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,069
but when you look at the
programs that are in place,

76
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,185
when you're talking about amnesty

77
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:26,846
for asylum seekers that are coming here

78
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,298
from Central and South America,

79
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:31,438
I think you guys are completely off base

80
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:32,706
and you're just trying to
scare people about this...

81
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:33,603
- But Jessica,

82
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:34,560
this is an honest question.

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,393
- Yeah.

84
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:36,226
- This is an honest question.

85
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:39,429
If you're an asylum seeker
and you're from a country

86
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:40,262
where you don't want to live

87
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:41,472
and you want to come to America

88
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:42,305
- Mhm.

89
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,563
- Shouldn't we ask you to go
through the proper channels,

90
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,853
and do it, you know, submit that way

91
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,500
and not scale a fence, or...

92
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,333
- Yeah.

93
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,566
- Or do so in nefarious ways?

94
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,399
- I think so.

95
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,818
It's an incredibly complicated issue

96
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:54,615
when you consider the fact
you should be applying

97
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:56,281
for amnesty in your home country

98
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,910
I've heard 75%, or upwards
of 75% are denied that,

99
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,526
so then because they can't
live at home anymore...

100
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:02,552
- Jessica.

101
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:04,576
- They then carry on and they
end up scaling that wall.

102
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,169
I don't think that this is the right way,

103
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,610
but I also don't think
that there's necessarily

104
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,524
a good solution to this
since we are a country

105
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,467
that wants to help others
who have bad circumstances

106
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,750
where they're coming from.

107
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,876
- Michael?

108
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,874
- Jessica, this isn't a complicated issue.

109
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:19,484
Illegal immigration is illegal.

110
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:22,359
We have, right now,
record high percentages

111
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,281
of the foreign born population to

112
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,766
the U.S. population as a whole,

113
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,764
it hasn't been this high since 1890.

114
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:30,094
Every single day we arrest 1,000 people,

115
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,263
illegal aliens, crossing into our border

116
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:34,892
and then we release them
into the general population.

117
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,932
We know that 60 to 80% of women and girls

118
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,408
who cross the borders illegally,

119
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,262
are raped and sexually assaulted.

120
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,457
If the suggestion here
is that all of these

121
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:44,338
illegal aliens are asylum seekers,

122
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:46,445
that's the new euphemism that we're using

123
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:48,621
for people flouting our immigration laws

124
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:49,454
and crossing illegally.

125
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:50,287
- No it's not, but...

126
00:03:50,287 --> 00:00:00,000
- What percentage would you advocate?
