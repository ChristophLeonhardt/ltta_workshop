by the way the Syrian civil war it's ending the mighty city of Mosul in Iraq more than a million people large it was a the greatest prize controlled by the Islamic state for above three years that was reconquered just a couple months ago when we were in Iraq actually and just this week Isis's official capital city called Raqqa in Syria was reconquered - at great cost the city is destroyed it's really like Stalingrad but that would be like conquering Berlin in the final days of world war ii conquering the capital I'm not saying the threat of Isis is over we just had an Isis terrorist attack in Edmonton just a few weeks ago but the Islamic state is a geographic entity with the landmass the size of the United Kingdom which it was at its height carved out of Syria and Iraq that actual country is coming to an end now I know this from my own observations I stood in the Christian town of benaiah in Iraq that was held by Isis for two years until it was finally liberated as you can see it's a lot of rubble there - so yeah I think Syrians well they can go home now to rebuild their country I don't think we need to put them up in hotels in Toronto especially during our coming Canadian winter who would want to live in a hotel for months on end anyways especially if he had a family he'd go nuts the kids would go nuts you know I don't listen to George Clooney about much but I mean he's he's politically a leftist of course he's a pro Muslim migrant activist so is his wife Amal Clooney but he refused to let any Muslim migrants live in any of his many mansions I mean he's not that Pro Muslim migrant but look at this he and his wife donated more than two million dollars to help Syrian migrants not to move them into his luxury homes not to put them up in a hotel in Hollywood he donated money for them in Lebanon which is adjacent to Syria to give schooling for 3,000 Syrian kids who are in Lebanon you couldn't teach 3,000 kids in Toronto for two million bucks you couldn't teach 300 kids Toronto for 240 million bucks and that's the thing spending the money in the area in the region makes sense not only in terms of cost but in terms of a cultural fit you don't need to hire special translators for the teachers the teachers in Lebanon all speak Arabic you don't need to make the kids learn a second language instead of math and things like that you don't have to make up for a lack of a social infrastructure from Arabian style food to even mosques and you know culturally appropriate entertainment I guess no that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
