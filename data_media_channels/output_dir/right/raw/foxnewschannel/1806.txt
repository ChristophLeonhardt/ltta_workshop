HERE.

14
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,393
ERIC: LET'S START WITH THE

15
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:24,296
CRITICS, THEY SAY THIS WAS

16
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:25,197
ILL-ADVISED OF THE PRESIDENT TO

17
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:28,867
PULL OUT, PROVOCATIVE AND IRAN

18
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:31,937
HAS BEEN ABIDING BY THE DEAL, IE

19
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:34,206
HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT AND

20
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,208
THIS PREVENTS IRAN FROM GETTING

21
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,509
NUCLEAR WEAPON?

22
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,677
>> THEY HAVE BEEN ABIDING BY THE

23
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:40,645
DEAL BECAUSE THE DEAL IS FLAWED

24
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:43,081
AN ONE-SIDED IN THEIR FAVOR THAT

25
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,084
THE DEAL GAVE IRAN EVERYTHING

26
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,587
THEY WANTED, COMPENSATION

27
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:49,654
$150 BILLION THAT THEY COULD USE

28
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,922
FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES IN THE

29
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:54,860
MIDDLE EAST AND SO FORTH AND DID

30
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,862
NOT CHECK IRAN'S DEVELOPMENT OF

31
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:58,997
BALLISTIC MISSILES, ITS EXPORTS

32
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:00,766
OF BALLISTIC MISSILES AND LOOK

33
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:02,501
AT THE REGION IN THE PAST TWO OR

34
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:05,537
THREE YEARS, SYRIA IS MUCH MORE

35
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:07,706
IN PLACE THAN EVER BEFORE, THEY

36
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:09,508
ARE FUELING THE ACTIVITIES OF

37
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:11,977
THE HOUTHIS IN YEMEN, SO WHY

38
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:13,178
WOULDN'T THEY STICK WITH THE

39
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,013
DEAL, WHY WOULDN'T THEY ABIDE BY

40
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:16,515
THE DEAL?

41
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:17,949
IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR THEM.

42
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,618
ERIC: YOU THINK IT WAS

43
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:20,051
ONE-SIDED?

44
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,520
>> IT WAS BASICALLY FLAWED.

45
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,854
IT WAS DEEPLY FLAWED.

46
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:25,457
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLA

47
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:25,490
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLE

48
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,524
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLD

49
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:25,557
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLI

50
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:25,690
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLN

51
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:25,724
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLT

52
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:25,991
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLE

53
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:26,024
IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLS

IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLE

IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLI

IT WAS THROUGH AD THROUGH -- FLN

58
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,692
MORE THAN ONE WAY.

59
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:30,128
FIRST, IT GAVE IRAN A LEGITIMATE

60
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:31,863
PATH TOWARDS NUCLEARIZATION ALL

61
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:37,936
BE ET IT A FEW YEARS LATER AND 5

62
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:41,039
YEARS IN HISTORY IS 5 SECONDS.

63
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,608
SECONDLY, BECAUSE IT DID NOT

64
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,709
ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES THAT

65
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,079
ARE CONCERN TO THE WORLD AND THE

66
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,683
REGION, FINANCING TERRORISM,

67
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:54,152
ACTIVATING REBEL MOVEMENTS,

68
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:57,422
ARMING HEZBOLLAH, SUPPORTING

69
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:58,890
BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND SO FORTH, SO

70
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,793
A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WERE VERY

71
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,727
IMPORTANT TO THE REGION AND THE

72
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,529
WORLD WERE SIMPLY NOT ADDRESSED.

73
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,631
ERIC: THE CROWN PRINCE HAS

74
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,501
CALLED THE AGREEMENT LIKE 1938

75
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:12,037
MUNICH AGREEMENT WITH THE NAZIS.

76
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:13,905
HOW FEARFUL ARE YOU, HOW

77
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:16,508
CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT IRANIAN

78
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:16,975
INTENTIONS?

79
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,411
>> WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

80
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,546
IRANIAN INTENTIONS, THEY ARE

81
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:28,687
CLEAR, THEY DO NOT -- THEIR

82
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,255
OBJECTIVE IS TO CONVERT MANY OF

83
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:33,492
THE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN THE

84
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:39,264
WORLD, THEY HAVE USED OLD

85
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:42,334
TENSIONS BETWEEN SHIITES AND

86
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:42,667
SUNNIS.

87
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,704
WE HAVE BEEN LIVING FOR HUNDREDS

88
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,072
OF YEARS.

89
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:49,374
MADE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO

90
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,076
EXPORT REVOLUTION AND IDEOLOGY.

91
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,978
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED

92
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,013
WITH THAT AND WE HOPE THAT ONCE

93
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:58,216
THE WORLD TAKES STAND, ONCE THE

94
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,619
WORLD DRAWS THE RED LINE ON --

95
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:05,257
ON THESE ISSUES THAT IRAN --

96
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,225
ERIC: YOU SAW PRIME MINISTER IN

97
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,460
CHINA AND HE'LL BE GOING TO

98
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,562
EUROPE NEXT WEEK TRYING TO LOBBY

99
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:11,463
FOR THE DEAL.

100
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:13,198
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL EUROPEAN

101
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:14,399
ALLIES LIKE GERMANY, FOR

102
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,701
EXAMPLE, THE NATION THAT IS DEAL

103
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:18,537
WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM

104
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:19,771
TEHRAN, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL

105
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:20,138
THEM?

106
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:26,344
>> I WOULD TELL THEM THAT HAS

107
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:27,746
NICE WORDS BUT STILL REPRESENTS

108
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:29,848
THE SAME REGIME THAT HAS BOMBED

109
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:35,520
BERLIN, THAT HAS BOMBED MUNICH,

110
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,990
THAT FUEL IT IS WAR IN SYRIA AND

111
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,595
IN LEBANON, INSTABILITY IN YEMEN

112
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:46,565
AND IN IRAQ AND OTHER PLACES, SO

113
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,033
THIS IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR

114
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,534
OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS, THEY

115
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:52,571
EITHER TAKE THE SIDE OF SAYING

116
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:53,805
LET'S CORRECT THIS ONCE AND FOR

117
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,441
ALL OR THEY TAKE THE SIDE OF

118
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,809
APPEASEMENT IN WHICH CASE WE

119
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:59,811
WOULD HAVE MORE YEARS OF THE

120
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,613
SAME IRANIAN BEHAVIOR.

121
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:02,948
ERIC: DO YOU REALLY SEE THEM

122
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:03,915
GIVING UP ALL OF THE RICH THAT

123
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:05,917
IS THE EUROPEAN COMPANIES GET BY

124
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,852
DEALING WITH TEHRAN AND BEING

125
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,387
ABLE TO TRADE UNDER THIS DEAL

126
00:04:09,387 --> 00:04:11,089
WHICH MAY NOW AS WE HEARD FROM

127
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:13,525
JOHN BOLTON COULD BE POTENTIALLY

128
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,161
IN DANGERED IF THE U.S. IMPOSES

129
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,331
MORE STRICTER SANCTIONS?

130
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,298
>> SAUDI ARABIA IS LARGEST

131
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:21,666
ECONOMY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IF

132
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,701
YOU'RE TALKING BENEFITS AND

133
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,235
DEALS AND SO FORTH, THERE'S NO

134
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:25,637
OTHER PLACE TO LOOK AT OTHER

135
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:27,606
THAN SAUDI ARABIA AND THE REST

136
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:33,311
OF THE -- AND THE UNITED STATES,

137
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,213
BUSINESS PARTNER FOR MANY

138
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:35,880
EUROPEAN COMPANIES.

139
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,283
IF IT'S A MATTER OF CHOICE WHERE

140
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:40,385
INTERESTS ARE, THE CHOICE IS KEY

141
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:43,555
WHICH IS WITH THE SIDE OF

142
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,523
ABORTING AND ABANDONING THE

143
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:47,058

144
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,426
ERIC: DO YOU THINK OR HOPE THAT

145
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:49,961
AN ECONOMIC STRANGULATION OF

146
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,463
TEHRAN COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO

147
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:55,500
THE FALL OF THAT REGIME?

148
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,968
>> WELL, THE FALL OF THE REGIME

149
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,837
OR NOT IS THE BUSINESS OF

150
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:00,672
IRANIAN PEOPLE BUT SENDING A

151
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:02,607

00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,344
POLITICAL AND MORAL SANCTIONS I

154
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:07,879
THINK IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

155
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,481
TO COMMUNICATE TO THE IRANIAN

156
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,882
PEOPLE THAT THIS REGIME IS

157
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,450
LEADING THEM IN THE WRONG

158
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,685
DIRECTION AND THEN IT'S UP TO

THEM TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,887
IT.

THE FEELINGS AND ASPIRATIONS OF

00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,346
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND IT

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,619
JERUSALEM IS FINAL ISSUE, SHOULD

00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:56,594
ACCEPTED BY THE ENTIRE WORLD.
