hmm Tiger Aldous or play video games I don't I don't think he very good because he he he wanted to build a wall and that's not really nice because the people in Mexico reserves have something why he build a wall that don't make no sense I read it for him I think it's a good present it's not really like him hitting keeping me around something very unpredictable because he wants to keep the other people from coming in the u.s. though bombers or whatever he's cranky he is crazy he is on horrible things and in my opinion as president he shouldn't have been elected as president he's not kind to everyone he only treats people fairly if they look like him I don't think he's a very good president I mean he might use a decent businessman but he I don't think he's exactly fit for the presidency he's married to a hon him - and he has a lot kids he yelled at a baby she lives in the White House she lives in New Jersey he's an old grandpa he wants to make the world grid again I never watched the politics I never watched anything I just saw was Donald Trump and I rooted for him and then Sony Clinton was on the chase kids for Mike last election really liked him some other people think he's like him some other people thinking why some people like him a lot so that kind of happened I think we probably made the mistake of letting him then people are realizing that now
