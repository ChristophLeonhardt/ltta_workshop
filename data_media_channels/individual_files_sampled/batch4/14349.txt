new data by the mail shows that over a period of a year one-third of those arrested in London were foreign nationals I've been saying on this show for quite a while that there's a serious cultural problem in the UK I think there's a cultural issue to talk about here when it comes to crime and obviously everybody can commit a crime obviously British people commit crimes but it always seems to be that the most diverse areas of the country tends to see higher rates of crime especially violent crime and I think there's an issue to talk about there and new data proves this to be the case even because the mail on Sunday has obtained internal police data which showed that in London one-third of all arrests were foreign nationals and that's just London by the way here's what the rest of the data showed almost 1/5 of crime suspects arrested by the police are foreigners 170 2732 out of 930 1155 arrested between 2016 and 2017 that's 19% and then this was really increased by the way of 16% over the year previously so it's getting worse it also found that in London a third of suspects are from overseas as I mentioned but it also found that 11% of the prison population in England and Wales are foreign nationals now the mail has previously reported also on criminals who've come to Britain after serving time in prison in their own country only to come to the UK thanks to our open borders and free movement in the European Union to come over to the UK commit more crime and spend more time in prisons how is does this make any sense because this begs the question doesn't it why exactly is free movement such a good idea and will Tereza mais nous free movement plan because that's what it is it's a new plan for free movement it's free movement under a new name under the checkers deal will this deal change any of this will this new free movement system change it I don't suspect it will now the male discuss the issue with free movement movement as well and they explain the risks of free movement for convicted criminals were starkly Illustrated in the case of lift-away nyan builder harnesses Elkins he had been jailed for murdering his wife in his homeland but was still able to move to London without anyone knowing his background in 2014 he killed schoolgirl Alice cross whose body was found in a canal in West London before hanging himself in response police are developing the first national strategy for dealing with the growing threat of F n O's foreign national offenders every forces undergone a health check to assess how well they are dealing with problems such as establishing a suspects identity or criminal record they also say that from now on they're going to be recording the nationalities of the offenders which is interesting because for a long time when I've tried to obtain data on the nationality of offenders in particular crimes it's not recorded the only thing they've been recording is the nationality of the victims and that's going to change data obtained by the male shows that a third of people arrested in London are foreign nationals and a fifth of those arrested across the whole country are also foreign nationals now here's why that matters so technically around a third of London's population is foreign-born witches is crazier foreign nationals meaning a third of those arrested being foreign-born it kind of expected but now that the nationality of offenders will be recorded universally which wasn't the case previously we'll get to see whether this is distributed evenly across people from different foreign nationalities so once we have this new data when the nationality of offenders is universally recorded the offenders who are being arrested in London what do you think is going to happen do you think that those being arrested will be evenly distributed across the many different countries represented in London or do you think some common themes might start appearing now striking data that we can see now shows that well it's the comparison between foreign-born offenders arrested in the UK compared to the number and the proportion of people living in the UK who are foreign nationals this is way more striking the last census showed that twelve point seven percent of the UK population was foreign-born but the latest stats show us that one fifth of a vendors are coming from abroad 12.7% compared to 1/5 around 19% to be specific so that's quite significant and again if we were given data on specific nationalities the data wouldn't be skewed and we would be able to analyze it properly because rather than saying that this is people from abroad we could be saying these are predominantly people from certain parts of the world so there's a sign here this is a sign that there are cultural problems in the UK and they do relate to crime and once new data is revealed with the nationalities of offenders I think we'll see a pattern and a theme from the country of origin pack up with all the rebel stories
