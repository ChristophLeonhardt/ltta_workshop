our celebrity social media influences have a new set of online followers advertising standards authorities online celebrities and vloggers have millions of followers across platforms like Instagram and Facebook that's why they're called influences but many of these stars do not reveal if they have been paid to promote fashion or beauty products or even services like plastic surgery and that is something authorities in the UK and in the u.s. are starting to examine and prosecute according to a study by media kicks and influencer marketing agency 93% of sponsored posts made by the top followed celebrities on Instagram are not disclosed the fashion industry is one of the biggest sponsors of social media advertising but many beauty tutorial creators for example neglect to mention that they're being paid to promote products big brands such as tobacco companies use social media influences to promote their products consumer watchdogs in the US and in the UK say they have started looking more closely at social media marketing practices one of the reasons is because influencer marketing has become extremely popular for targeting Generation Z that is the demographic roughly aged 11 to 18 the message is clear social media stars who don't come clean about being paid to promote certain brands could find themselves in court along with their sponsors which only mean now from London is Roopa Shah and influencer marketing regulatory consultant and founder of hashtag thanks very much for being with us so for the uninitiated among us just explain to us broadly what what exactly is influencer marketing sure it's at its most simple it's where a brand's will partner with a somebody with a large social media following to promote their products and that might be through just a single sponsored post or through a long-term campaign so people like the Kardashians for example they would be they will be a good example of influencer marketers yes they are example they're an example of a celebrity but actually quite a lot of influencer marketing happens with someone with people with much smaller followings so for example 10 to 100,000 followers they might not be celebrities we know them you might not see them on TV but they will have big for example Instagram or Facebook or Twitter followings and some of these celebrities are getting a little bit more scrutiny now aren't they because of the products that they're pushing and the fact that many people are not aware that a lot of them are being paid to do this are we reaching a point now where the that they are going to get more scrutiny from from advertising authorities and so on absolutely yes I think it's been described as the Wild West previously where you know the average person couldn't actually tell it if a post had been sponsored or paid for in some way so the advent of investigations from the FTC the aasa' in now the CMA it's definitely the influences are much more aware of what they need to be doing and brands are also a lot more aware of how they need to ensure that posts are clearly disclosed why is this so important what does this mean to so-called Generation Z or Generation Zed that's coming up now well it's important because you know Generation Z we are consuming much more social media content than we ever have before so the markets you know the market for influencer marketing is growing exponentially and we're immersed in it so traditionally we've always been able to tell the difference between advertising for example on TV and editorial content there's been a clear distinction between the two whereas with social media marketing sometimes it's very difficult for an consumer to be able to tell what is paid for and what isn't and it's important for consumers to know this because it will make a difference to their decision as to whether they actually believe that influencer cares about that product and makes a decision difference as to whether they actually want to purchase that product so being very clear as to whether something is an advert and when it isn't is important for consumers world and how big an industry are we talking about here at the moment I mean how big is the influencer market in the UK and around the world it's huge so globally we're talking billions of dollars and it's growing exponentially so I think some forecasts are estimating potentially twenty billion dollars in by 2020 so it's a it's a massive market and one in which brands and advertisers are fully aware that there there can be some gains huge gains to be made from from using influencer marketing so it fits arise certainly and how big a budget do two companies themselves allocate for something like this thing that can really vary so it can go from anything from very little some brands still don't use influencer marketing to up to 40 percent or 100 percents certainly some products I've seen are actually the you know the whole premise of that product is to be sold via influencer marketing only and you will only ever seen it complete marketed on Instagram or you know Twitter or IG TV for example now one of the news platforms so it's it depends on the brands but if you know if it's a brand that continually markets most of them will have allocated a budget certainly by 2020 a large proportion of their project to influence the marketing Rupesh ah thanks very much for being with us you're welcome thank you
