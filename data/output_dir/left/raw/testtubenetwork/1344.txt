1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,529
From Soviet spy to the highest elected office
in Russia, Vladimir Putin has now served as

2
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:10,820
President of Russia for 14 years — and by
all accounts he’s about to make that 20.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,439
Putin is now the second longest-serving leader
in modern Russian history, coming in at #2

4
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,689
behind Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

5
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:24,210
He has been in power in Russia since 2000,
when he was first elected President.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,590
Although he took a break from the Presidency
in 2008-2012 in order to serve as Prime Minister,

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,870
many saw Putin as still holding most of the
power.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,100
Hey guys, I’m Versha, and today we want
to take a closer look at Putin’s rise to

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,750
power and his ambitions for Russia.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,890
Putin was born in 1952 in Leningrad, as it
was known during the Soviet Union.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,969
Today, it’s called St. Petersburg.

12
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,030
He had a rough childhood: his two brothers
died very young from infections and complications,

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,879
and he ended up growing up in a tiny, communal
apartment shared by 6 people.

14
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,989
Putin’s mother was a factory worker and
his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy.

15
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,210
As a young boy, Putin became enamored with
the idea of being an intelligence officer.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,430
But reportedly, he was too impulsive and undisciplined
- he still had a lot of growing up to do if

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,790
he was going to achieve his dream.

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,250
By many accounts, the maturing process began
in about the sixth grade.

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,100
Young Putin began to take his studies more
seriously and also became interested in extracurricular

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,510
activities like martial arts.

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,880
But his goal was still to become a secret
agent.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,070
When he was in the 9th grade, he quote “approached
the local branch of the KGB, asking for an

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,490
appointment to discuss his career prospects.”

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,440
A senior agent told young Putin that he should
join the military or study law, but quote

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,160
“in any event, not to contact the agency
again.”

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,780
And study law is just what he did.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,720
In 1970, Putin enrolled at Leningrad State
University.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,220
By this time, Putin had reinvented himself
into a disciplined, hard working, and athletic

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,650
young man.

30
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,750
He also joined the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union while he was there.

31
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,120
Then he got the call he had been waiting on...
the KGB.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,440
The KGB contacted Putin when he was in his
fourth of his five years at Leningrad State.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:17,230
And after a probationary period, the 22-year-old
Putin finally became a KGB agent in 1975.

34
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,520
After years of training, he was assigned to
monitor foreigners and people who worked at

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,110
consulates in Leningrad, before he was sent
to Dresden, East Germany.

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,400
Dresden was widely considered a backwater
station for KGB agents, which casts doubt

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,150
on Putin’s own claims of being a super-spy.

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,220
Masha Gessen, a Putin biographer and well-known
critic, says the KGB agents’ jobs during

39
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,770
this time was “mainly collecting press clippings.”

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,930
Putin says when the Berlin Wall came down,
he burned KGB documents so that protesters

41
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,510
couldn’t get to them.

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,820
Regardless of what Putin actually did during
this time, we know being a KGB agent strongly

43
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,990
influenced his political way of thinking - both
in terms of strategy and execution.

44
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,180
As a KGB officer working in East Germany,
Putin saw firsthand the effects of the end

45
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,900
of the Cold War and the fall of communism.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,530
He once said in an interview that "few people
understand the magnitude of the catastrophe

47
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,550
that happened late in the 1980s when the Communist
Party had failed to modernize the Soviet Union."

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:25,030
The breakup of the USSR really impacted Putin
in terms of his worldview and his ambitions.

49
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,010
His focus shifted to politics.

50
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,100
After returning from East Germany, he would
go on to work in local St. Petersburg government

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,840
for the mayor’s office.

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,940
During this time, people said he preferred
to remain in the background, still operating

53
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,460
more on a behind the scenes basis as he did
in the KGB.

54
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,160
But he eventually moved to Moscow where he
would work his way up and become a more public

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,880
politician - almost accidentally.

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,500
Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the
new Russian Federation, took notice of him

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,300
and appointed him to his presidential staff
in 1997.

58
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,421
By 1998, Putin had earned Yeltsin’s trust
enough for him to make him director of the

59
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:06,390
FSB, which was basically the KGB’s post-Soviet
successor.

60
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,470
The Federal Security Service, or the FSB,
is the main intelligence agency of Russia,

61
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,840
covering national security, counter-terrorism
and surveillance.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,320
The external circumstances of global politics
helped change Putin’s goals - he became

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,970
a politician who wanted to fix things in Russia,
as he saw the struggling post-Soviet economy.

64
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,900
He wanted Russia to remain a global power.

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,470
In 1999, Yeltsin announced that he wanted
Putin to be his successor.

66
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,410
He made him Acting Prime Minister and then,
Acting President, when Yeltsin unexpectedly

67
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,880
resigned on New Year’s Eve 1999.

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,470
So Putin ushered in the 21st century as Russia’s
acting leader, which was cemented in a presidential

69
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,669
election held a couple months later.

70
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:55,070
It was during these early years of his presidency
that we learned Putin was still focused on

71
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,460
how the break-up of the Soviet Union had negatively
affected Russia.

72
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,830
It’s objectively true that the disintegration
of the USSR led to a rough transition period

73
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,910
for many of the former republics, including
Russia.

74
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,250
His new goal became establishing Russia as
a world power -- again.

75
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,660
To that end, he wanted to consolidate power:
Putin’s Russia has since become increasingly

76
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,090
authoritarian, including limitations on free
speech and the media and the arrest and sometimes

77
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,620
murder of political opponents and journalists.

78
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,120
Also, Putin sees post Soviet countries like
Estonia and Ukraine gravitating toward liberal

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,830
democracy, as seen in the European Union,
as a real threat to Russia’s power and world

80
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,830
standing.

81
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,900
And Putin believes Russia has a rightful claim
to territories in the former Soviet republics.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,430
In 2008, Russia sent troops into Georgia in
an attempt to annex breakaway regions in the

83
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,430
country, according to experts.

84
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,400
Those regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
both have a significant ethnic Russian population.

85
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,479
But this quickly came to an end when the French
brokered a ceasefire that dictated the removal

86
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,580
of most Russian troops from Georgia.

87
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,270
Crimea was a different story.

88
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,510
Russia successfully annexed Crimea from Ukraine
in 2014.

89
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:15,250
In fact the first round of the Russian presidential
election in 2018 is on March 18 - the exact

90
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,400
date that Russia annexed Crimea, which Putin
saw as a huge victory and which boosted his

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,050
approval ratings domestically - even if it
caused great concern to the rest of the world.

92
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,740
Putin’s main goal now is to continue to
expand Russian power globally - at home, in

93
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,520
neighboring countries, and abroad.

94
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,840
He certainly doesn’t want to see former
republics from the USSR becoming more European

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,170
or Western.

96
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,720
In fact, the word “Western” today is often
considered a dirty word in Russian politics.

97
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,610
So what can we look forward in Putin’s likely
fourth term?

98
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,419
First - he’s ensured he will be in power
longer - Russian presidential terms have changed

99
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,661
from 4 years to 6.

100
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:01,760
So he will likely now serve as President until
2024, when he will be 71 years old.

101
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,000
We should also be on the lookout for his goal
of broadening Russian influence around the

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,270
world - while news of Russian interference
in the U.S. elections has dominated American

103
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,670
media, experts say we should pay attention
to what Russia is doing politically in Venezuela

104
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,880
and Libya, as well as the Middle East and
Europe.

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,270
Putin still wants Russia to rival the U.S.
as a superpower, and he’s stepping in where

106
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,860
the Trump administration is stepping out.

107
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,919
This is sure to have an significant impact
on the world.

108
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,850
So, you just watch the story of how Vladimir
Putin became the powerful figure that he is

109
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,850
today.

110
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,479
But who are some other world leaders you’d
like us to profile next and why?
