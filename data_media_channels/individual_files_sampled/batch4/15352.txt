president Donald Trump is called the EU a foe at this point president Trump is doing more for the UK and more for brexit than any of our politicians ever have done he's doing way more to hold the politicians to account and make them fulfill the outcome of the brexit referendum and I think that's wonderful it's brilliant isn't it and there was of course that amazing Sun News interview that he did during his trip here that the media were going insane about yeah how could he do something so miscalculated but really I thought it was genius and in that interview that caused so much outrage he said that if May went ahead with the soft brakes it deal essentially the checkers deal then it would mean that America will be dealing with the EU and not dealing with the UK and it would quote probably end a major trade relationship with the United States I think that's a fantastic thing to do it's really smart it's it's not actually just operating in a way that defends the brexit referendum outcome but also in a way that protects America because a trade deal between the US and the UK is it's mutually beneficial it makes a lot of sense and if Theresa May goes ahead with this drags it light deal which still let's be honest ties us to EU regulations as I've outrun outlined in one of my previous videos and then it's gonna make it difficult for the u.s. to trade with us Trump even said at a NATO press conference that breaks it is brexit nice one and that the people voted to break it up so I would imagine that's what they would do but maybe they're taking a different route I don't know if that's what they voted for you know Trump is calling out the prime minister made a mistake he's calling her out on the fact that they are betraying the results of the brexit referendum even said I don't know if you've seen this but buried in that really long press conference between Trump and mrs. May over the weekend he actually called her out in a slight way saying you know whether eggs it might happen it might not we'll see what happens um it's fantastic that he's doing this I think it's really important but today I saw a video in she called the European Union a foe I mean he's he's defending brags it so far but now he's calling the EU a foe which I just think is brilliant take a quick look at this what's your biggest competitor the biggest foe globally right now well I think we have a lot of foes I think the European Union is a foe what they do to us in trade now you wouldn't think of the European Union but they're a foe a lot of people might be surprised to hear you list the EU as a foe before China and Russia no I look at them all look EU is very difficult I want to tell you maybe the thing that's most difficult don't forget both my parents were born in EU sectors okay I mean my mother was Scotland my father was Germany and you know I love those countries I respect the leaders of those countries but in a trade sense they've really taken advantage of us and many of those countries are in NATO and they weren't paying their bills and you know I guess an example have a big problem with Germany because Germany made a pipeline deal with Russia where they're gonna be paying Russia billions and billions of dollars a year for energy and I say that's not good that's not fair you're supposed to be fighting for someone and then that someone gives billions of dollars to the one that you're you know guarding against I think it's ridiculous so I let that be known also this time and I'll tell you what there's a lot of anger at the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars there's a lot of anger I also think it's a very bad thing for Germany because it's like what are they waving a white flag I've been really enjoying Trump's interventions on brakes yeah of course it's funny it's funny to watch this man basically throw a political hand grenade into the political arena it's great but actually he's doing something really important it's and also by the way a lot of people might say to me and it would be fair enough well Jack don't you hate it when politicians come to one country and tell the people what to do and yes I would if Trump was coming here and telling us to do something that we'd never spoken about or voted on then yeah absolutely there'd be a problem but here's the difference Trump's coming to the UK and reminding the politicians to do something that we the British people have already told them to do this isn't Trump intervening to tell them to do something that he wants them to do he's intervening and saying hey didn't your voters already tell you to do something maybe you should do that I think that's fantastic and it really puts our politicians in their place reminding the politicians what they've already been told chumps one of the most important allies for this country America is one of the most important allies but it's not just for the country it's specifically an important ally for the British voters at this point and if he continues to speak out and represent us represent the outcome of the braggers it referendum in 2016 then Trump in my mind will have done more for this country than any of our modern politicians if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
