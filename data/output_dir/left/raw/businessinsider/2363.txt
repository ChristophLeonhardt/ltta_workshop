00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,570
with this today<font color="#E5E5E5"> kanda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tori vp of finance</font>

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,439
and notorian company can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're November</font>

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,330
sales as bad as all the reports depicted

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,189
you know I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really depict them</font>

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,689
as bad I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is</font>

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,920
really look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're comparing</font>

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">year over year so in November of 2008 we</font>

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,380
had a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation department</font>

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,549
stores at least at the high end where we

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had placed big orders in that</font>

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,079
spring and between spring in November

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,579
the world basically fell apart so what

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,469
did they do they had bloated inventories

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,790
and they had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they knew</font>

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,770
wasn't going to come their strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,270
november of last year was really you

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">know let's get all this stuff out the</font>

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,090
door which meant marking stuff down as

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,739
county discounts as much as they can

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,270
they said this stuff is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,190
sell for full price let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out the</font>

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,039
door the situation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> November</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2009</font>

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,600
is obviously much different we had very

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,699
cautious orders in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spring of 2009</font>

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,500
and if anything right now inventory

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,210
levels are or may be too low and what

27
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,949
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing from our department stores</font>

28
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,830
is they want more stuff so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,970
they're obviously not trying to push

30
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,960
stuff out the door because they don't

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,130
have enough meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're being</font>

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,380
much more much more cautious in terms of

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,030
their markdowns and really being much

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,070
more disciplined as well so to compare

35
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">two thousand eight to two thousand nine</font>

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,369
in say 2009 was a disaster really i

37
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,560
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a fair assessment i think</font>

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,580
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at this from a</font>

39
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,930
bigger perspective let's look at gross

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,060
margins at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

41
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">other day saw the end of the world</font>

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,939
coming exactly or not exactly i mean

43
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,049
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with such a long lead</font>

44
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,360
times it's hard to forecast and they've

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,159
made some<font color="#CCCCCC"> errors both in 08 and 09 i</font>

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,600
think if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess how</font>

47
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,250
businesses let's look at gross margins

48
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,420
from the department source at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

49
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,560
the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let's look to see what</font>

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,689
their orders are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> spring of 2010 for</font>

51
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,979
next fall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see you</font>

52
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,060
know a much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more optimistic picture</font>

53
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,100
great so how are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> trending in to</font>

54
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,899
December now you know we think they're

55
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,840
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> once again I think at the end of</font>

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,880
november we didn't see the mark down so

57
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,189
the sales numbers weren't as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

58
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we saw mostly customer at the end</font>

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,799
of you know for Black Monday and for us

60
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">I started Black Friday and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for cyber</font>

61
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,040
monday that was sort of trained to look

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,229
at discounts and they didn't maybe react

63
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,310
as well to the full-priced merchandise

64
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,288
as people at<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

65
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,130
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Optimus</font>

66
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,080
you know despite<font color="#CCCCCC"> double-digit</font>

67
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,730
unemployment we do see people with jobs

68
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,680
continuing to spend so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,270
while the numbers aren't great so far

70
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,950
they definitely could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot worse and</font>

71
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,180
we're feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good that the next</font>

72
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,170
couple weeks are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shape up</font>

73
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,490
pretty well so you having to offer

74
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,050
deeper discounts now to meet those

75
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,120
expectations so we you know our business

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">model we really say so you're in the</font>

77
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,450
high end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the market we're in the high</font>

78
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,650
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the market we sell to the</font>

79
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,150
department stores and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

80
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,730
how they mark stuff down<font color="#E5E5E5"> our only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> direct</font>

81
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to consumer outlet for us is Natori calm</font>

82
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
which we which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate ourselves and</font>

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our model where we're really</font>

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
dependent on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> retailers we don't</font>

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,740
discount aggressively right we don't

86
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">want that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to upset them so</font>

87
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,030
you know we it's not our decision to

88
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,440
mark stuff down but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have seen</font>

89
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the department stores who do mark</font>

90
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,990
stuff down is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're being much</font>

91
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,400
more disciplined about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,900
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> disciplined than they were</font>

93
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,430
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year so what is your</font>

94
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">outlook into 2010 you know we're feeling</font>

95
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,810
pretty good you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I help run the</font>

96
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,700
finance part of our business in terms of

97
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,960
modeling our business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be</font>

98
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,020
responsible we're sort of modeling 2010

99
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,500
expecting flattish sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you</font>

100
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,480
asked us all internally how things will

101
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
actually pan out I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd be a</font>

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,290
little more optimistic but you know just

103
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be responsible we're medium-sized</font>

104
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,100
family-run business we're modeling our

105
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,600
expenses and everything based on flat

106
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,390
place based on flat sales for 2010 but

107
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,620
hopefully you know we'll see we're

108
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,330
feeling definitely much better than we

109
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,880
did compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to earlier this year yeah</font>

110
00:03:32,880 --> 00:00:00,000
great thanks good
