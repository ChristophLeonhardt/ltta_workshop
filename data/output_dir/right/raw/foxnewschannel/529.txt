1
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,441
>> Tucker: A PRESIDENT TRUMP

2
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,543
HAD A BIZARRE EXCHANGE OF WITH

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,545
JIM ACOSTA OF CNN TODAY.

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,379
ACOSTA SUGGESTED THE PRESIDENT

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:15,214
HAD A DUTY OF SOME KIND OF TO

6
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:18,350
TAKE ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,251
A FEMALE REPORTER, JUST AS SOON

8
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,922
AS JIM ACOSTA GOT TO ASK THE

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:23,289
QUESTION.

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,759
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND AFTER I'M

11
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,327
FINISHED, IF ONE OF OUR FEMALE

12
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:29,595
COLLEAGUES COULD GO AFTER ME,

13
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:33,332
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

14
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,634
MR. PRESIDENT, TO FOLLOW UP ON

15
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:36,202
THESE ALLEGATIONS --

16
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,803
>> President Trump: WHAT DOES

17
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:38,537
THAT MEAN?

18
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:40,206
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

19
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:44,343
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY IF A FEMALE

20
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:45,578
REPORTER WOULD ASK A QUESTION

21
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,546
ABOUT THAT ISSUE.

22
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,080
IF YOU DON'T MIND --

23
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,814
>> President Trump: I WOULDN'T

24
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:49,915
MIND THAT AT ALL, IT WOULD MAKE

25
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:53,953
ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME.

26
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,888
>> Tucker: JIM ACOSTA, A BIG

27
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:58,758
FOR WOMEN.

28
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,192
AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST OF MARK

29
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,727
STEYN JOINS US TONIGHT.

30
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:03,462
SO LET'S JUST BE LITERAL FOR A

31
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,030
MINUTE.

32
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,233
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

33
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,136
>> I'M NOT SURE.

34
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,337
IN PRESS CONFERENCES THOUGH IF

35
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,371
JIM ACOSTA IS IN THE ROOM, I'M

36
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:21,748
IN FAVOR OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN,

37
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,551
AND IT IS ACTUALLY FAR MORE

38
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:26,352
CONDESCENDING AND SEXIST THAN

39
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,756
ALL THE OLD, DEAD, WHITE

40
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,524
REPUBLICAN MEN ON THE SENATE

41
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,160
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

42
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,329
ORRIN HATCH IN THEIR WORST

43
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,030
NIGHTMARES COULDN'T BE MORE

44
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,766
SEXIST AND CONS A CONDESCENDING

45
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,767
THAN THAT.

46
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,901
WOMEN REPORTER REPORTERS

47
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,970
GENERALLY ARE TOUGH, THEY DON'T

48
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,238
NEED GENTLEMAN JIM ACOSTA TO

49
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,306
HOLD THE DOOR FOR THEM TO LET

50
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,942
THEM THROUGH SO THEY CAN GET A

51
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,342
QUESTION IN.

52
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:55,014
ROSLYN RUSSELL, IN HIS GIRL

53
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,083
FRIDAY, ROSE RUSSELL PLAYED A

54
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,385
TOUGH NO-NONSENSE REPORTER AND

55
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,053
SHE WOULD HAVE PUNCHED HIS

56
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:00,453
LIGHTS OUT.

57
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,555
>> Tucker: I'M NOT MAKING ANY

58
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,524
SPECIFIC CLAIMS AGAINST ANYBODY

59
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,761
BUT, HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT THE

60
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,728
PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE LOUDEST

61
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,164
NOISE IS WHAT FEMINISTS THEY ARE

62
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,899
TEND TO HAVE A MORE SPOTTY

63
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,167
RECORD WITH WOMEN IN THEIR OWN

64
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:14,968
LIVES?

65
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,303
>> I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

66
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,642
TRUE.

67
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,310
PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE       HE

68
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,344
PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE       HO

69
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:19,739
PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE       HR

70
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,377
I THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF

71
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:24,611
PROJECTION IN THE WHOLE       HT

72
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:30,350
MEDIA SAVAGERY.

73
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,253
THEY HAVE HAD A HARD YEAR AND

74
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:39,459
LOST THE SENATOR, AND WHETHER

75
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,995
IT'S CHARLIE ROSE OR MATT LAUER

76
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,364
OR HEIDI WEINSTEIN, AND MAYBE

77
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:49,302
ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT JELL-O

78
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,505
BRAND HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED WIT

79
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:52,806
WITH.

80
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,541
>> Tucker: SHEET THROUGHOUT

81
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,241
THE COURSE OF THIS KAVANAUGH

82
00:02:55,241 --> 00:03:00,413
STORY HAS SIMPLY NOT JUST

83
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,182
IGNORED PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

84
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,150
BUT SHE'S BRAGGED ABOUT IT.

85
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,785
>> TO THOSE WHO I HEAR YOU SAY

86
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,789
OVER AND OVER, THIS ISN'T FAIR

87
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,959
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE'S

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,528
ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS, WHAT

89
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,764
ABOUT PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

90
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,732
UNTIL HE'S PROVEN GUILTY?

91
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,167
HE'S NOT ENTITLED TO THOSE

92
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,234
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY

93
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,571
THINKING TO CONVICT HIM.

94
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,006
>> Tucker: SHE BASICALLY SAYS

95
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,174
IF YOU SUPPORT DUE PROCESS AND

96
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:27,941
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, YOU'RE

97
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,843
PART OF THE PROCESS, PROBLEM SO

98
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:36,717
SHUT UP.

99
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:41,355
AND   >> IT'S ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.

100
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,757
LORD CHANCELLOR IN ENGLAND DID

101
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,825
THE THING THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME

102
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,360
THE U.N. DECLARATION OF HUMAN

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,161
RIGHTS, THE PRESUMPTION OF

104
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,997
INNOCENCE ISN'T JUST A CRIMINAL

105
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,933
COURT VALUE, IT'S ACTUALLY A

106
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,471
CIVIL RIGHT.

107
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:03,176
IT'S WHAT VISCOUNT SANKEY CALLED

108
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:10,550
THE GOLDEN LAW.

109
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,219
AND, IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL COURT.

110
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:17,925
IT'S BEYOND THAT, IT'S A U.S.

111
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,194
EQUIVALENT OF THE LORD

112
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,264
CHANCELLOR.

113
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,134
AND WHEN THE STATE ACTUALLY SAYS

114
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,736
IT'S A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE,

115
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,604
ONE OF AMERICANS OUT OF

116
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,840
300 MILLION GET TO BE U.S.

117
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,576
SENATORS, AND NOT SOMETHING THAT

118
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:39,046
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE

119
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:39,747
CONCERNED ABOUT.

120
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,282
THE MOST POWERFUL FIGURES IN THE

121
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,018
LAND LIKE CARSON MILLER KNOW

122
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,586
MIKE GILLIBRAND, ARE WILLING TO

123
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,821
TRASH -- YOU MENTIONED MARK

124
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,622
JUDGE, FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS

125
00:04:48,622 --> 00:00:00,000
WHEN PEOPLE GOOGLE HIS NAME WAS
