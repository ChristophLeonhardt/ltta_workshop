1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,020
A long, long time ago
back in the late 1991s

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,750
we put Anita Hill before
our esteemed committee.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,360
“In fact, he never did
ask you to have sex.”

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,220
And boy oh boy,
we learned a lot.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,310
“As one of those 98 men
in the United States Senate,

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,370
I say we owe you a
debt of gratitude.”

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,100
Back then we only had
two women in the Senate.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,760
So, the only way to understand
or empathize with a woman

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,900
was by proximity.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,000
“I couldn’t help but think
of my own four daughters.”

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,030
“I thought too of my daughter.”

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,610
“I just remember as a young
boy and my mother telling me about …”

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,020
These were serious accusations

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,600
and we took them seriously.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,930
“This F.B.I. investigation, which
was a very right thing to do,

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,410
and it was a good
investigation.”

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,990
Our sensitivity at the
hearing captured the nation.

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,310
“… do solemnly swear …”

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,560
And as a result, we inspired
the 1992’s “Year of the Woman.”

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,780
And wouldn’t you
know, a wave of women

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,300
ran for office in 1992.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,080
And incredibly, we tripled
our female representation

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,630
from two to six.

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,880
Some of us never give up.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,910
Thirty years on the front
lines of progress.

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,980
And look at us now.

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,750
We’ve heard the people 
and learned from history.

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,510
“I want to treat Dr. Ford 
as if she were my daughter.”

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,420
“Or my mother.”

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,710
“I think she’s mistaken.”

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,810
“Why didn’t somebody call
the F.B.I. 36 years ago?”

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,580
“Unless there’s something more,

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,760
no, I’m not going to ruin
Judge Kavanaugh’s life

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,450
over this.”

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,579
“He’s a gem.”

36
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,120
“We’re going to plow
right through it.”

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,230
We even found a way to avoid
embarrassing internet mash-ups

38
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,980
of us looking foolish.

39
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:45,000
“We have hired a female
assistant to go on staff

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,850
and to ask these questions in a
respectful and professional

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,250
way.”

42
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,510
Today, we’re proud of our 23
female senators, ranking us

43
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,330
103rd worldwide 
in terms of women

44
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,960
in national legislature.
Look out, Sudan!

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,040
If you’re impressed
by our progress,

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,250
remember, we have
no term limits.

47
00:02:04,250 --> 00:00:00,000
So keep voting us in.
