Mimi we don't yet know if the judge is gonna rule on appointing a special master to go over this information as opposed to just allowing a filter team I'm not going to use the word tank team because it's just kind of weird I'm the used filter team going forward instead of allowing a filter team just to go through it alone and then hand it over to the clean team there could be a special counsel that a special master that that comes in with this but Michael Cohen's lawyers wanted not just that they would themselves wanted to be able to review all of the material all of it and decide for themselves what is attorney-client privilege is there precedent for that absolutely not and it sounds like judge wood has essentially rejected that notion I know there's sounds like there's some open issues there some details we don't know about her ruling she's left open the possibility of the Special Master but it sounds like she's pretty much ruled out the possibility that these are going to go over to the target of the investigation first to look at before the government even gets to which would really just you know eviscerate the purpose of a search warrant and I think not only as judge would recognizing you know that in this case that's not warranted but judges are afraid of slippery slopes and if you did that in this case there are many other cases where targets of Investigations are going to try to invoke some kind of privilege to say that they should get to look at the documents before a search warrant and remember that's because this search warrant was approved by a judge ahead of time and they went through all of the proper procedures and judge wood knows that and I think she showed today that she's a no-nonsense judge and she's gonna cut through a lot of this circus atmosphere and she's gonna treat this not like any other case because it's obviously not but she's going to treat this in a judicial way and it looks really like that's what she's doing it wasn't just approved by a judge it was approved by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as well so you have Michael Cohen arguing for attorney-client privilege and you have the president's lawyers arguing that they should be able to see all the material first in order to potentially assert executive privilege is there any precedent for not that I'm aware of where they would look at it in the first instance it doesn't mean that they don't at some point get to make motions and assert privileges but this idea that they get to do it first that's what's so unprecedented and it sounds like I mean I'm learning the facts as you are about what happened in court today but it sounds like the judge is sort of asking the government to do some kind of what we call rolling discovery usually discovery you turn over evidence in your case after charges are filed but here are given the privilege issues it sounds like she's saying you know that the government should give over some of those materials starting now it doesn't mean that they get to look at it first meaning the President or the or mr. Cohen and it doesn't even necessarily mean that anyone's looking at it yet it just means she's going to let them start identifying what materials were seized and give those over so that maybe the parties can either work something out or this Special Master can be appointed or she will go ahead and approve the filter team hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
