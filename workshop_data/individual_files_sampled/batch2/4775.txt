well today the president of the United States switched from insulting his Director of National Intelligence yesterday by name and the thousands of intelligence personnel in Washington and around the world who supply the president with the very best intelligence that they can provide the president went from insulting all of them yesterday to insulting his voters today the president told one of those Trump lies that no one else in the history of public life in America would ever attempt to tell Donald Trump and everyone in the Trump White House know that most Americans know that Donald Trump is an uncontrollable liar the president knew he had no hope of convincing most voters today that he didn't mean to say what he said yesterday the president knows that most voters most Americans most children are way too smart to fall for the lie that Donald Trump told today but Donald Trump must not see his voters that way former CIA director John Brennan yesterday said that President Trump's comments yesterday were imbecilic and today Donald Trump took imbecilic to a whole new level Donald Trump gave his voters an intelligence test that he seems to be very confident they will not pass can not pass he said that he forgot to say one word yesterday that would completely reverse the meaning of one sentence that he said yesterday the line that Donald Trump changed today came in the middle of his response to this question which definitely was not an actual answer to the question would you now with the whole world watching it's helped President Putin would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again so let me just say that we have two thoughts you have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server why haven't they taken the server as the whole world knows Donald Trump did not have the courage or the integrity to denounce what happened in 2016 yesterday and he did not have the courage to warn Vladimir Putin standing right beside him to never do again instead Donald Trump rambled through a response in which he ended up saying this all I can do is ask the question my people came to me dan coates came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia I have president putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be but I really do want to see the server but I have I have confidence in both parties the president very clearly just said I don't see any reason why it would be it would be Russia what he meant was it would be Russia that mounted a cyber war on the American election in 2016 and today the president tried to repair all of the damage that he did yesterday by simply inserting one word in that sentence I got a transcript I reviewed it I actually went out and I realized that there is a need for some clarification it should have been obvious I thought it would be obvious but I would like to clarify just in case it wasn't in a key sentence in my remarks I said the word would instead of wouldn't the sentence should have been I don't see any reason why I wouldn't or why it wouldn't be Russian so just to repeat it I said the word would instead of would and the Senate should have been and I thought I would be maybe a little bit unclear on the transcript or unclear on the actual video the sentence should have been I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia did the self-described stable genius come up with that all by himself obviously not that's why he had to read a written statement we know Donald Trump doesn't write anything and Donald Trump is not reluctant to share his idea that his ideas that's why he tweets around the clock and this was an easily tweetable fix 24 hours ago 24 hours ago now Trump was at home in the White House watching television and seeing the massive onslaught of criticism he was getting including from Republicans for saying what he said yesterday and the line that he decided to change today was quoted many times last night so obviously yesterday and last night Donald Trump didn't think there was anything wrong with saying that he couldn't see any reason at all why Russia would attack our election in order to help Donald Trump but it took a full 24 hours for Donald Trump to try and insert that one new word into that sentence and whose idea was that NBC News national correspondent Peter Alexander is reporting tonight that a source familiar with the conversation confirms to NBC News that vice president Mike Pence and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo had a private conversation with President Trump to urge him to make clarifications on his comments from the news conference with firemen Putin in Helsinki and so the two mics came up with the one-word solution just changed that one word and everything's gonna be okay Donald Trump will not survive the Muller investigation or an impeachment investigation if his lawyers are not much much better than the two mics there were many problems in what the president had to say yesterday but the one the one that the two mics were trying to solve was the spot where the president seems to equate the integrity and judgment of Dan coats his Director of National Intelligence with the integrity and judgments of his new friend Vladimir Putin the president said my people came to me dan coats came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia I have President Putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be that is what the president said yesterday and changing that one word changes only the meaning of that one sentence it doesn't change the meaning of any other sentence that the president said yesterday it doesn't change the part where he equates dan coates and Vladimir Putin let's listen to that one more time all I can do is ask the question my people came to me dan coates came to me and some others they said they think it's Russia I have President Putin he just said it's not Russia I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be but I really do want to see the server but I have I have confidence in both parties but I have I have confidence in both parties that sentence came after after the sentence that the two mics tried to change the two mics did not change that sentence I have confidence in both parties to make the two mic story work they would have had to change that sentence too they would have to change that sentence to I do not have confidence in both parties that have put another knot in there I do not have confidence in both parties and then they would have had to invent a sentence that Donald Trump never said which is I have confidence in Dan Coates who told me the truth about what Russia did and I have no confidence in president Putin's denial the one word fix fixed nothing the two mics failed but they obviously engaged in a mighty struggle with Donald Trump because it took him 24 hours to go along with their plan but then even after executing their plan Donald Trump ruined their plan by taking his eyes off the words they had written for him and adding a few words of his own let me be totally clear in saying that and I've said this many times I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 to the play could be other people also a lot of people out there I accept their conclusion but I don't could be other people also as soon as he takes his eyes off the words that the two mics had written for him Donald Trump destroys what the two mics sent him out there and do he says it could be anyone who did it anyone what does Dan Coates know he's just the Director of National Intelligence well Trump doesn't have confidence in him it could be anyone no confidence in the FBI no conference in the CIA no conference in the NSA no conference in anyone involved in the American investigation of what happened in 2016 and certainly absolutely no conference in Robert Muller's indictment on Friday giving the names the names of the 12 Russian military officers who were launching the cyber missiles into our presidential campaign to hurt the Clinton campaign and help the Trump campaign no one believes what Donald Trump said today no one not know not one member of Congress believes if not one elected Republican in Washington believes what Donald Trump said today today's comments were aimed at Trump voters and no one else because Donald Trump knows no one else will believe a word of what he said today and so the question for the remaining Trump voters tonight is just how many insults can they take from Donald Trump the question for Trump voters tonight is is Donald Trump right above them will they believe anything that he says anything will Trump voters believe Donald Trump's ridiculous lie today which Donald Trump himself contradicted in things he said yesterday and again in things he said today after he told the lie only an imbecilic audience can fall for an imbecilic performance Donald Trump proved once again today that he firmly believes that the voters who he once affectionately called the poorly educated will believe anything he wants them to believe and will accept any insult to their intelligence as long as that insult to their intelligence comes from Donald Trump as it did today leading off our discussion now Ned price I'm a senior director and spokesperson for the National Security Council in the Obama administration results of a former CIA analyst Jill wine bags former assistant Watergate special prosecutors here and Tim O'Brien executive editor of Bloomberg view and the author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald they are all MSNBC contributors and yet I want to go to you on on what Donald Trump did again today he once again today publicly said he does not believe the American intelligence community does not believe Dan coats it could be anyone who did this and he said that in a mission he was obviously primed for by others in the White House apparently Mike Pompeo and Mike Pence he said that in the middle of that mission where he was supposed to go out there and express confidence in the intelligence community well that's right wrote Lawrence if you think our heads are spinning trying to disentangle trying to fathom how the White House could think we are so in basilic to use your words just imagine how this is playing out at Langley how this is playing within our national security workforce you know as I was digesting all of this yesterday and reflecting upon what has to be one of the most shameful days of the Trump presidency I heard from a former colleague from who's still currently at CIA and this person started his message with what in the hell are we doing what in the hell are we doing and he wasn't talking at a policy level he wasn't talking about bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington it was an existential question an existential question that has to be on the mind of all of those or at least many of those who have dedicated their careers with little pay and even less recognition risking in some cases life and limb to protect their country for a commander-in-chief a first customer who is willing to trash them on the world stage and to trash them in front of their nemesis no less and you know we talk a lot about workforce morale and the federal government and the implications therein you know there may be less productivity of worker or unhappy if they don't get their annual pay increase but there are real implications when it comes to our national security workforce and especially our intelligence community and what scares me about all of this Lawrence is that sometimes we don't see those implications until it's far far too late Joanne banks we saw again today a demonstration of why Donald Trump's lawyers don't want him to go anywhere near a grand jury or anywhere near an interview with Robert Muller here he is trying to correct a statement that he made yesterday and trying to do it in the most unbelievable possible way by trying to insert this one word and then in that process of trying to fix it he says the thing again that he wasn't supposed to say it is a big mistake on his part but even the idea of correcting one word is absurd because it isn't just the one sentence or the one word that was upsetting to the American people yesterday it was the whole context it was his standing side by side with President Putin and ignoring first of all he said that Coates said he thinks it's Russia Coates did not say he thinks it's Russia he said it is Russia all of the intelligence agencies have said that a detailed indictment was issued and it's being prosecuted now by the National Security Division of the Department of Justice that names twelve GRU Russian military intelligence officers as defendants and it lays out very clearly the acts that were done by the Russians under the leadership of Putin and when Donald Trump stands there and says well there is nothing I could do except ask the question that is not true he is the President of the United States he could say I will not meet with you I will not negotiate with you I will not cooperate with you unless and until you extradite these twelve men to stand trial in America and even Putin said it's up to our justice system to resolve these things if that's truth and he should be grateful for the opportunity to send these people to America to stand trial and for people to see exactly what Putin and the GRU to interfere with our election and we need to protect our election we need to take action to stop this from happening four months from now so Tim O'Brien Mike Pence is one of the co-authors of the new version of the Trump statement so I think it could be interesting to listen to what Mike Pence said yesterday about Donald Trump and this is after Donald Trump had completed the press conference Mike Pence seemed to think yesterday that every word Donald Trump said was great let's listen to this and earlier today President Trump completed what he described as a direct open and deeply productive dialogue with President Putin in Helsinki what the world saw what the American people saw is it President Donald Trump will always put the prosperity and security of America first so that's the guy yesterday he saw nothing wrong with what Donald Trump said yesterday well and then obviously walked into the same world when the Trump did after all this at the news which is that everyone watching that show globally saw Trump behaving exactly the same way he's been behaving over the last year he has repeatedly been a pop an apologist for Vladimir Putin he is repeatedly tried to absolve the Russians from any involvement in this and and and nothing was really new about that conference got for two things he was standing next to Putin and it was and it was televised and I think they all realized when they came back home that they had to somehow try to roll this back but you can't roll Donald Trump back as you saw he even even scripted he could not stay on script because we know already there's a voluminous record about how he thinks about this and he is not going to going to acknowledge that Russia played a role sabotaging the 2016 election because it cuts to the core of a couple of things he's deeply concerned about one of which is the Muller investigation jeanne Shaheen and other Democratic senators are now calling on how the interpreter the us interpret who was involved to participate in the hearing jeanne Shaheen said I'm calling for a hearing with the u.s. interpreter who was present during president Trump's meeting with Putin to uncover what they discussed privately this in sure can help determine what POTUS shared promise Putin on our behalf and a net price that is unprecedented but the meeting was unprecedented and we've already seen that Donald Trump can't keep his story straight from one day to the next in terms of dealing with Vladimir Putin and these translators do often take notes because the state as we saw yesterday for example with Larry Putin he can speak at length and for a translator to translate it all they have to write down certain notes about what if I were Putin said what do you make of this democratic demand and the Senate to hear from the translator well you're right Lawrence that this would be unprecedented but all of this is unprecedented I think we have to throw this quaint notion of precedent out the window when it comes to the motion that senator Shaheen put forward look the fact of the matter is that this translator if I'm not mistaken is a State Department employee at the very least is a US government employee and this translator not only has information that could well be relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries but is certainly relevant to our national security is certainly relevant and is in fact what was agreed to behind closed doors between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump and just today the Russians as we expected all along have started to roll out statements about oh yes this agreement that the two presidents reached well we didn't hear about any of these agreements the two presidents reached only one other person on our side did and it's this translator it's incumbent upon the US Congress to perform this oversight role because the White House is not interested in being candid with the American people Congress must Congress must get to the bottom of what exactly was agreed to for our own national security sake Jill will Robert Muller subpoena the translator to testify to a grand jury I'm not sure that there's anything directly relevant to the Muller probe in this except if he did actually talk about anything to do with the interference in the election and although he says that he raised the question he doesn't say that they had any lengthy discussion about it with all the things facing Muller I would say that the translator is not going to be high on his list nor do I think actually subpoenaing Donald Trump should be high on the list because we've seen time and time again that his answers do not have any relationship to the truth or the facts and so why bother asking him any questions that you will not get truthful answers to we need to have more interviews of people who don't have a preconceived notion of what they're going to say regardless of what the facts are and there's a lot that still needs to be done I hope that Muller can be left alone and that we can stop attacking him this was another attack on the Department of Justice he Donald Trump ignored the indictment which is so detailed that it's hard for anyone to read that and not see that President Putin was in charge of interfering in our election that is a big threat to our democracy and it's something that it should have been the number one thing on Donald Trump's agenda in protecting America he took an oath to protect our laws and to see that the rule of law took place and he is absolutely not doing that and that concerns me the most of all thank you to everyone for getting us started on our first panel
