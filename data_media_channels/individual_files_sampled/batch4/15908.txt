hey guys Hilary Duff's boyfriend here fiance I think my name's Chris Hemsworth but I'm kind of known for that gal and I would like to take a moment out on this fun festive day to apologize you see I was the lone ranger last year and when I was choosing this costume I thought I know I'll be an Indian that'll be a fun juxtaposition and I spent a boatload on this costume I got real buckskin real leather and I rented this headdress from the place was 240 bucks and Hillary here got her beautiful pilgrim outfit you can't see her little short shorts now but she is whoo and I thought that'd be fun pilgrims Indians that's what we do on Thanksgiving right we all get together and then the backlash happened and I realized oh yeah there's tons of rules about Halloween they don't want you dressing up as something you're not I should have gone as Hilary Duff's fiance or whatever I am but I screwed up so here I am making a formal apology to everyone out there hoping that this does not hurt her career because we just put some money down on a house in Malibu and her offending you stupid babysitter's could cost us literally millions and millions of dollars um I was stupidly unaware of the offense this may have caused and the sensitivity around this issue you see I'm Hilary Duff's boyfriend neither of us are really known for our intellect I sincerely and unreservedly apologized to all First Nations people for this thoughtless action I now appreciate that there is a great need for a deeper understanding of the complex and extensive issues facing indigenous communities I hope that in highlighting my own ignorance I can help in some small way Jesus Christ it's Halloween you're supposed to dress up what you can't be something you're not that's what a costume is every year we go through this crap did you see the backlash they got cowboys and Indians on the lawn ring what about the Cowboys I didn't know that a lot of Cowboys were so hungry during the pioneer days that they had to dig up their grandmother and eat her face that must have been super gross and I'm sorry for my insensitivity there's thousands of tribes they they represent a colorful history of America by the way I think half of this stuff trivializes Indians and makes them look like pussies we fought them for 400 years that's astounding good work guys we beat the Nazis in an hour and a half you are a worthy adversary that's why we're sports teams Redskins I tomahawks we're impressed by this but check out the backlash that our sweet little Hilary Duff got now Hilary Duff has to be well-versed in all this crap or should I go over here see if you can scroll down John at some of these tweets they really are I can't read them they're too small can you blow them up yeah there we go what Hilary Duff wasn't controversial she was racist there's a difference she wasn't going for controversial you dumb bitch she was going for fun she's a silly cute pop star that we all like because she's a silly cute pop star and now she's not well-versed on your made-up religion so she's racist who she dressed up as an Indian they're not doing great you can't dress up like anyone that's not doing great who can you be Warren Buffett thoughts and prayers this morning to everyone who weirdly believed Hilary Duff wouldn't eventually wear a racist Halloween she what you can't be a pilgrim now what is Hilary Duff in trouble that's very pussy-whipped by the way to assume that he's this cuck that wears whatever she tells him to he may well be nothing wrong with that by the way when you're married to Hilary Duff do whatever you can to keep it going I can't believe Hilary Duff looked at her boyfriend and thought yes this costume is perfect and not offensive I can believe it because it is perfect that it's not offensive pilgrim Indian Thanksgiving is Thanksgiving bad you killed Columbus Day now do we have to kill Thanksgiving why do you people keep ruining everything fun is Santa next Halloween is a dumb holiday we're not literally scared of ghosts it's not a day when the dead comes out it's a day where we just fuck around and we wear a dumb costume we have to look like someone different Indians have a distinct look despite all the tribes they tend to have a common vain here that's easily identifiable hey dress up as them don't put them in a little pedestal safety box that's actually the worst thing you can do for any culture that's how cultures die hey Indians if you're at a powwow and there's a bunch of German sycophants going what would I know I understand that you originally were called the people of the great voice listen to that guy interest is what keeps you going there's problem with the left is they say oh don't say retard I want to put this person away in a little box where I don't discuss them they're too taboo that's not the way I grew up I grew up in the 70s there was retards everywhere you know why cuz we didn't abort them we didn't commit genocide every gang had one or two kids with Down syndrome and you know we did to them nothing we shared our licorice and hung out with them because it was normal you people want to ruin everything you want to kill everyone look at this insane chart that CNN put out on what you can wear and this is a great example by the way of how insatiably complicated these people are we gave them pronouns they said there's only gonna be three then there was 70 they change every day you have to tune in with them and make it the whole screen because it doesn't even matter what they say but you start out with something like you have a hilarious visual is that allowed I mean look at this thing you literally need a flow chart to understand what the hell you're supposed to do does it involve blackface yes don't of course not remember and when I was a kid in the 70s what her named Joni Mitchell not only did she dress up in blackface for Halloween she had this black guy she used to do at parties and everyone thought well that's whatever that's funny it's just fucking skin colored makeup we had Fred Armisen on SNL he wouldn't wear darker makeup when he was Obama so you're like oh it's Obama with food poisoning or Obama just saw his dead grandmother walk by Obama finally saw his dad again effect that's why he was so pale his father showed up ok go all the way down now on this side this is my favorite part of this ridiculous chart it says you probably shouldn't wear that ok where are we here you probably shouldn't wear that I don't care it's a free country by the way do you sense an element of disdain with that comment it's like a comedian the other day said I don't want appear on your show it's a free-for-all I go free-for-all is meant to be a good thing but anyway I don't care it's a free country right that's a dumb thing to say so then they go hey it's a suggestion not a command the end no no no you have to go back up the dotted line over back to me repeating you probably shouldn't wear that so again I say I don't care it's a free country and you just get caught in this loop around and around and around and around we go yeehaw laughs ooh the loop of capitulation round and round and round we go as I keep telling you hey man I'm just suggesting I'm just trying to get you fired I'm just trying to ruin your life I'm just making you issue an apology Hilary Duff do you have her apology she gets out there and she says that she's so sorry meanwhile this is big money when these idiot babysitters get involved they cost you millions of dogs what does you say here I mean everything is the opposite I'm so sorry to people I offended with my costume I would it was not properly thought through and I'm sure you don't have to think it through it's Halloween I'm so sorry the way I did those body shots I didn't realize that alcohol can give someone a rash it's body shots it's a stupid thing we're partying I'm not the Lone Ranger okay I'm not saying it's okay to kill Indians we're having fun here look at how sexy Hilary Duff is by the way this is really what you're against you're against sexy fun people having sexy fun times you're really you pretend it's about equality and justice I've never seen you on the rez I never saw you at a powwow I never saw you with the the Winnebago Wellness Center trying to help out the hashtag nd ends you don't get involved in that because you don't really care you're just a vindictive shitty captain bring-down you're a busybody you're a horrible strain on everything that is Western and if there's one thing that's more Western than anything else it's fun stop shitting on our party just because you're not invited you
