young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcasts of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio what in the end will end up happening to Paul Manafort he is in jail right now he's awaiting two different trials but Donald Trump has recently been thinking about pardons quite a bit thanks to Kim Kardashian and so there's the possibility that Donald Trump will get involved Rudy Giuliani who is Donald Trump's lawyer or spokesman or bro I don't know at this point what formal role he holds but he was talking about this today and he said when the whole thing is over things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons and Donald Trump was asked about this earlier today and he said that he didn't want to talk about it but that he thought that Paul Manafort had not been being treated fairly and he's previously said that he would use pardons to make things fair not necessarily specifically with Paul Manafort but you can figure out eclis connected to it I think this is scary because the charges that Manta Ford is facing are in you know directly tied to this Russia investigation so if he pardons Paul Manafort it sets a precedent that he's gonna continue pardoning you know he started small he started with Sheriff Arpaio thank you and and he's slowly moved up the ladder dinesh d'souza now if he pardons Manta Ford it's not that disconnect he's slowly entering this world of like okay well now I'm gonna pardon people that are directly associated to me now I'm gonna pardon people who are directly associated to the investigation I think it's a terrifying precedent if he pardons him even so Jules I think you're being too soft on no look there's no question about it at newer times I'm sorry New York Daily News in one of the stories that I read bothered to talk to a bunch of former federal prosecutors criminal defense attorneys and they're like well you can't read Giuliani's mind if he has intent to obstruct justice then it would be obstruction but without that he probably is not obstruction but it's it's certainly seems to be a signal that hey man afford even though you're in prison hang in there we're gonna pardon you to which I say of course of course now why would Giuliani say though when the whole thing is over we might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons in regard to manna port they clearly obviously for any sane human being telling that oh fort don't worry don't flip on us and because we're gonna pardon you it's like the first time ever that a head of a criminal organization has the power has the power of the pardon I mean can you imagine if the mob boss could be like hey Donny hang in there don't worry about it okay I'll pardon you and the ironic thing about this is that Manta Ford is going to jail for witness tampering he needs to take some lessons from Donald Trump on witness tampering because he did it through a private encrypted app whereas Donald Trump just says his witness tampering out in the open you know through his lawyers he does it during tweets he does it constantly and you know and I think that's maybe he's found a legal loophole for that but you know it's just another example of him setting this kind of culture at the top of his organization and I'm not surprised at all that it's finally starting to catch up with them Trump himself when asked about whether he would met a pardon mana Ford and Cohen said I don't want to talk about that no I don't want to talk about that if he left it at that that's totally fine but he continued but look I do want to see people treated fairly that's what it's all about so when asked if he would pardon this particular guy I want people to be treated fairly might as well have added a giant wink to that look it only people who think that Giuliani and Trump talking about pardoning mana Ford doesn't have to do with protecting themselves yeah are people that are wildly disingenuous or maybe work in the mainstream media and have to go oh he says this and she says this and what would I know what am i a reporter right but even the manga guys you know what that's about it's not it's not about something else not about a plumber it's not about a dentist they're saying hey well pardon you don't talk which by the way for the first time I've never been sure that mana Ford had anything on Trump I'm positive Michael Cohen things has things on Trump he was panicked when Michael Cohen was had his stuff that was seized etc etc quarter-page there's good reason there's a lot of its varying degrees of what we can guess from the outside based on publicly available evidence but now Giuliani coming out Trump hinting at him and Julie just flat-out saying don't look will pardon you means oh that she talked to trump and Trump said oh he's got terrible stuff on me make sure he doesn't flip he's in prison now make sure he doesn't flip promised a port yeah and I think I understand that there's probably some people there's a certain percentage of Americans that either think that talking about possible pardons is too esoteric or too inside baseball or they don't really care about Paul Manafort specifically or maybe they don't care about these investigations more broadly they think you're focusing too much on what's going on in Washington why are you talking about this but I think that we are at an incredibly important point in our country with huge possibility for precedent to be set in the future if you care about any oversight or consequences for what presidents do what governments do you can rest assured that right now every other politician in the country is waiting to see what's gonna happen with Donald Trump because we all say the president can do this so the president can't do that all of that is hypothetical and it only means something if there are consequences when they take an action we say they can't do and I'm telling you right now when it comes to parting man afford or Flynn or his son or himself the Republican Party will do absolutely nothing if he does it so I don't care what a DOJ memo from the 70s said or what the Constitution has to say about it from the Republican Party there will be zero consequences no matter who he pardons and what he pardons them for and if he is allowed to get away with that there will be no consequences for any president for any action for the rest of time and for progressives that is not a state that we can allow to come about and so even if Paul Manafort bought like bores you or frustrates you or you think that we talk too much about Trump if you care about the future and holding future politicians accountable you cannot afford to stay silent on this issue you cannot afford to check out on this issue you have to make your voice heard you have to make sure that there are consequences if Donald Trump does what he is apparently promising he's going to do and you know this is one other reason that's why it's so important that we flip the House of Representatives to Democrats because Democrats will then have investigatory power over the Trump administration subpoena power we need to get to the bottom of this I don't trust the Republicans that are running Congress right now to do anything about that and the people deserve answers this is the most powerful this is the man that runs our country that one of the most powerful people in the entire world and you know we need to get to we need to get to the bottom of so much of this to Easi wasteful Young Turks want
