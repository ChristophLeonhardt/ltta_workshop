00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:02,999
IS THIS TINA FOR SOME KIND OF

27
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:03,433
TERRORISM?

00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:00,824
AND HE DID IT.

47
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:01,625
I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE

48
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:01,992

WHENEVER AND SAID THEY WERE AND

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,314
HE DIDN'T.

>> TRUMP?

58
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:33,623
>> JEANINE: WHAT DO YOU THINK

59
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,357
THAT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY WILL

60
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:34,924
BE IN JERUSALEM?

61
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:35,659

68
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:49,673
EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT TALKED

69
00:02:49,673 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT IT BUT NOBODY DID IT.
