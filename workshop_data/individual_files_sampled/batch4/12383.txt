the White House know the top Trump aide Rob Porter had allegedly beaten not one but two of his ex-wives and when did they know about it what did they know about it and when do they know about it right those are the two questions Shawn Kelley is the White House chief of staff he's the one who stood by Porter as late as Tuesday afternoon he was saying the Rob Porter was his man he was standing by Rob Porter Rob Porter was just great they're a bunch of defenders inside the Trump administration and it now turns out that Trump is angry at those defenders because there's a photo of one of this guy's ex-wives and one of this guy's ex-wives actually has a photo of a big shiner on her face we showed it to you yesterday well one of the big questions that has arisen is there are questions now about hope Hicks hope Hicks is the beautiful young staffer who works at the White House you very close to the president you start off I believe as a PR flack for Ivanka's fashion line and then moved into the Trump campaign and now is at the top levels of the White House apparently very nice person but has terrible taste in men and she is now dating Rob Porter and Rob Porter's ex-wife says listen hope if Rob hasn't been abusive with you yet don't worry he will reporters now in our relationship with the White House press secretary Hope Hicks do you think he's changed I don't think he's changed does that worry you it worries me for a lot of reasons I mean it definitely worries me because if I'm being Frank with you if he hasn't already been abusive with hope he will and particularly now that he's under a lot of stress and scrutiny that's that's when the behaviors come out and if he hasn't already he will so hope Hicks is under a lot of fire from the White House she's under a lot of fire from outside the White House and for pretty good reason here because what we have on our hands here is indeed a soap opera yes hope Hicks a young woman looking for love in all the wrong places she dated Corey Lewandowski the Trump campaign manager who was married at the time during the campaign was spotted yelling at him on the street by the Nira post Corey Lewandowski of course had a penchant for grabbing women and bruising them and then lying about it for three weeks hope Hicks then moved on from Corey Lewandowski to rob Porter who it turns out has a penchant for allegedly punching women in the face kopecks then helped co-write the memo and that memo that would exonerate Brad Porter that memo basically was written for Kelly and said that Rob Porter was a wonderful man so not only does hope Hicks have some problems in choosing dudes hope excess from Robins in defending that bad dudes and president Trump is rightly angry saying why in the world are you defending a staffer over me your job is to protect me from Bad staffers Trump apparently didn't know about the statement that had been drafted in order to help exonerate Rob Porter he didn't know about any of that stuff until it came out it was too late for him to do anything so he's spitting mad at hope Hicks as well he should be so that is the soap opera portion of the what's going on at the White House we also have the John Kelly portion of what's going on at the White House so Kelly it now turns out testified in 2016 on behalf of a marine who is alleged to have committed some sort of sexual abuse or sexual assault and he went on to go according to our times he was this marine went on to abuse a child sexually so there there's a lot of problems inside the Trump administration with defending some pretty bad folks Raj Shah is out there defending the White House response yesterday why was he out there as opposed to hope X well because hope is at the center of the of the soap operas and is any of this good for the White House the answer of course is no but we've had a lot of bad staffing decisions right in the first year of the Trump administration we had Steve ban a piece-of-crap was in and then he was out we had Anthony scare Moochie who was in it for five minutes and then out we had Mike Flynn who's now under indictment he was in and then he was out we've had 37 people inside the Trump administration who were in and then they were out it not good so Raj Shah was out there trying to explain this yesterday because hope Hicks couldn't come front and center and defend what she'd done cuz she's involved with the man by the way the Lewandowski the the other elements the soap opera that I forgot the other element is that Corey Lewandowski allegedly is one who leach to the media all of the information about Rob Porter apparently yeah we can play the music that's right Corey Lewandowski the hope picks his ex-boyfriend who was married at the time was apparently suspected by the White House of being the guy who leaked out all the information about Rob Porter in the first place so the ex-boyfriend going after the current boyfriend and the girlfriend of the abusive boyfriend two ex-wives defending that person instead of the president so ok enough with soap opera ok so Raj Shah defending the White House yesterday it was not a particularly good look the allegations made against Rob Porter as we understand them involve incidents long before he joined the White House therefore they are best evaluated through the background check process it's important to remember that Rob Porter has repeatedly denied these allegations and done so publicly that doesn't change how serious and disturbing these allegations are ok the problem is now a lot of people move about this at the time the Washington Post reporting today quote in January 2017 right is a year ago White House Donna counseled on McGavin learned of the allegations and he wanted to stay put because he saw the Harvard Law Train Capitol Hill veteran is a studying professional voice in the White House according to people familiar with the matter his view didn't change in June when the FBI flagged some of its findings to the White House nor did he act in September when he learned that domestic violence claims were delaying Porter security clearance or in November when Porter's former girlfriend contacted him about the allegations according to these people that's four separate times in a year that the White House Counsel was told that this guy was a real problem and had some serious issues in his past and the White House Counsel did nothing about it which raises some questions what exactly is the White House looking for they're looking for good staffers capable staffers is the White House looking for people who are good at their jobs where's the White House looking for loyalty because you look at Rao's response to yesterday saying well the process sort of had to play out and now look at the white response to Omarosa okay let's look at the White House response to Omarosa so uh morosely yesterday did two to go back for a second Omarosa Manigault is a person who is on trump's reality TV show she was fired three times on a separate reality TV shows then he hired her for the campaign and then she was working in the White House basically walking around doing stuff that nobody knows what she was doing and then she came out yesterday and on TV she said that everything in the White House is awful I here's what she had to say not there I don't it's not like it's not my circus not my Luckies you know I'd like to say not my problem but I can't say that because oh it's so bad okay so she says all this stuff on and people oh my goodness the crying and yes Trump picked this person to be in the White House solid staffing picked by the president she then came out and she said that she would not vote for Trump again if she were given the opportunity would you vote for him okay I'm billionaires okay so how did the White House respond to that the White House ripped the crap out of amaurosis oh you have a guy in the White House who's credibly accused by two ex-wives of beating them and the White House quasi defends until the last minute Omarosa says that I won't vote for the guy again she's a reality star was this non predictable right and the way here was the White House ripping on the rosa she described the situation inside the White House as bad and said it is not going to be okay not very seriously Omarosa was fired three times on the apprentice and this is the fourth time we let her go she had limited contact with the president while here she has no contact now okay so I love that they fired her three times when they brought her back the fourth and then they fired her fourth time but they're really pissed at Omarosa but Rob Porter you know that really dicey about which demonstrates it when it comes to the Trump administration loyalty matters a lot more than competence and that's a serious problem that should not be the case in any business loyalty matters competence matters more particularly the level of the White House right people who made one anti-trump remark during the campaign have been banned essentially from the White House or at least were when they originally staffed it up and that rules out a lot of pretty competent people because they weren't quote-unquote loyal and so you end up with loyalists who may not in fact be particularly competent there's a bunker mentality at the White House and it came to bear here and it's really nasty and there is no excuse for it it is disgusting that anyone was defending Rob Porter after these allegations were known it is particularly disgusting that people were defending Rob Porter after you know after there were reports on Tuesday again all of that there's just no excuse for it and you have to wonder whether whether the people in charge who knew about it ought to be fired and I am talking about John Kelly if John Kelly knew and he was defending this guy for a year if McGann knew for a year front they they've missed served the President of the United States okay so I do want to talk about a piece of even bigger news that is the the Republicans deciding that fiscal conservatism is no longer a thing first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blinds at comm so

hours on the East Coast the Republican Congress along with a bunch of Democrats voted in favor of a two-year funding bill this is not a budget okay it's not technically a budget the reason that makes a difference is if you don't pass a budget you can't use reconciliation processes to pass new bills I discuss this a little bit yesterday but in order for you to pass a bill under reconciliation meeting with 51 votes in the Senate in order for the filibuster not to apply you have to pass a bill that is budget neutral well that doesn't apply if there is no budget you cannot have a budget neutral bill if there is no budget so they essentially passed a funding bill but no budget so that prevents them from passing any new legislation that really affects spending so they can pass something on daca maybe but that's about it right there will be no further movement on Obamacare there'll be no further movement on taxes there will be no further movement significant movement on regulation in all likelihood you know that's a serious problem the bigger problem however is they just blew out the budget I mean blew it out they they're spending more money now than Barack Obama was spending they're spending about the same amount of money actually so Bob was saying they've got a trillion dollar debt yesterday a trillion dollar deficit in the budget they blew a hole in it Rand Paul wanted to stand up and say something about it yo Rand has a knack for standing and talking at these times and that's something you got to appreciate about the senator from Kentucky here is Rand Paul saying listen you know we campaigned on fiscal responsibility and then we lie about it and you know the thing is is we think when Democrats are in charge that the Republicans of the conservative party the problem is when the Republicans are in charge there's no conservative party and that's kind of where we are now someone is to stand up and say you should spend what comes in we should balance our ledger and that used to be what it meant to be conservative but a lot of so-called conservatives lose their mind once it becomes a partisan thing and they say we must govern now so they've governed by giving is massive new debt and I don't think that's good for the country I think ultimately it threatens our security not only our external security but also the internal foundation of the country is threatened but so so large a debt he's exactly right here the real problem with the debt is not that we're gonna go bankrupt immediately we're still the strongest economy on planet earth that means people are gonna continue buying our bonds but one of the problems you have is that over time as you accrue more and more debt we're gonna keep getting people to buy into that right now our the American debt to GDP ratio is growing and growing so I want to look it up right now the United States American debt to GDP ratio let's see what is it here in the United States is let's see it is 106 point one percent of the countries at GDP we have a government debt equivalent to more than the entire country GDP okay that is not a good thing that is not a good thing okay we've reached a record low in that number in 1981 under Reagan when our government debt was only 32 percent of GDP but that is not a healthy number okay if you look at debt to GDP ratio by country we are we are starting to climb those charts and they are not good in the slightest right in Japan of course Japan is basically bankrupt their public debt is now 243 percent of GDP but China's really looks like 23 percent of GDP using just tax the crap out of their own citizens but if you look at some of the more healthy countries like Germany they have a 70% GDP to debt ratio or debt to GDP ratio even France ranks below us the UK ranks below us we have been selling our debt at ridiculous rates for a long time and eventually that's gonna come around to buy II can't just borrow on the credit card interminably in the end somebody's going to stop lending you that line of credit when that happens they're going to have to be austerity measures nobody wants to look at that however because they're afraid of the political blowback should that happen Rand Paul suggests that it is hypocrisy for Republicans who talk deficit for years and years and years and then under Obama and then Trump becomes president suddenly we stop talking deficit anymore how government's taking off and this new stimulus of deficit spending will be as big as President Obama stimulus don't you remember when Republicans how to high heaven that President Obama was spending us into the gutter spending us into oblivion and now Republicans are doing the same thing and so I ask the question whose fault is it Republicans yes whose fault is it Democrats yes it's both parties fault you realize that this is the secret of Washington the dirty little secret is the Republicans are loudly clamoring for more military spending but they can't get it unless they give the Democrats welfare spending so they raise all the spending it's a compromise in the wrong direction okay and he is he is correct about this he is wrong by the way about military spending as a general matter this is one of the problems with Rand Paul's that Rand is very anti military spending I'm fine with the idea that we don't have to radically revamp our military spending and jet and jigger it upward in any in any tremendous way but Rand action wants to cut it tremendously because he thinks that we should just bring our troops home from Afghanistan for example which is quasi delusional but when he talks about the fact that Republicans have ceased to care about the budget he's a hundred percent correct here's what is in this bill okay according to ABC News two-year budget deal would lift caps on defense and non-defense spending by three hundred billion dollars over two years it includes six billion - phylla to fight the opioid crisis five point eight billion for child care Development Block Grants four billion for veterans medical facilities two billion for medical research 20 billion to augment existing infrastructure programs four billion for college affordability is College gonna get more affordable no it's not gonna get more affordable the measure would extend government funding at current levels until March 23rd to allow lawmakers to finalize details on the spending in a separate measure lawmakers would also raise the nation's debt limit into 2019 so we'll have no more government shutdowns until past the congressional elections which was part of the goal here she has chod hot air is fulminating over this he says listen everyone who is fighting for conservative principles okay this means that you no longer get to talk about fiscal conservatives in the future you can't talk about fiscal conservatism about fiscal responsibility when you're blowing out budgets to the tune of trillion-dollar deficits with an entirely Republican Congress by the way they told me if I didn't vote for Trump we get trillion-dollar deficits and daca and apparently they were right I mean this is pretty amazing stuff and they're a bunch of fiscal conservatives of days past you voted for this thing right Speaker of the House Paul Ryan senator Ted Cruz right both of these people voted for the new budget Cruz said he had to for the disaster funding most of the disaster funding already taken place it's like 51 billion dollars of disaster funding had already been funded this adds a bunch of boondoggle on top of it Paul Ryan was interested in raising the the military spending okay well then get your own people in line sir then get your Republicans in line there are 16 Republicans who didn't vote for it including Rand Paul and Mike Lee right Michael Lee was really angry because he said this process is completely corrupt which it is the way of propriate SAR supposed to be done are not in the 700 page omnibus packages that are rolled out at midnight and no one reads that's not the way this is supposed to be done Appropriations packages are supposed to be done by apartment and by Department the way it was supposed to work is that if you have a Department of Defense bill you of a defense spending bill the defense authorization bill they have a Health and Human Services authorization bill and you have a commerce authorization bill then you have a Department of Education authorization bill and then we can debate what should be in and what should be out of each one of those bills the house by the way a hundred days ago past 12 authorization bills for each of the departments the Senate didn't move on any of them instead the Senate moves into the site of the back room and they negotiate an omnibus package and they said you get to vote up or down that is not a way to be fiscally responsible but Republicans don't care about that anymore you know why Republicans don't care here's the dirty little secret there's our little secret is that Trump's populism works because politically speaking Trump is recognizing a truth that fiscal conservatives are gonna have to come to grips with that is voters lie okay voters say they want fiscal conservatism voters say they want cuts voters say they want the government to spend within its limits but the minute you say to voters guys we're gonna have to restructure Social Security voters balk and then they voted Democrat in other words we like to pretend the word of the child who's capable of delayed gratification there's a very famous delayed gratification experiment where you can actually tell IQ of children in a very basic way through this experiment if you take a four-year-old and you say to them I'm gonna put this cookie in front of you right now you can either eat that cookie right now or if you wait three minutes you will get a second cookie all right you get two cookies kids who have lower IQs tend to pick the cookie up and eat it right away kids with higher IQs tend to sit there and wait for the second cookie okay well we all like to pretend that we're the kid with the second cookie there were the higher IQ kids in reality we are not we like to think of ourselves as smart but we're dumb so when it comes to action like we say yeah let's cut the spending but the minute that it comes to something we want then all of a sudden we don't care about the spending anymore and we're always saying it's an emergency situation john cornyn and yesterday he ripped into policy and I know he wants to make a point he has that right I agree with many of the concerns about deficits and debt but we are in an emergency situation when's the last time we weren't in an emergency situation when's the last time we actually had a full-throated debate about government spending and we weren't in a quote/unquote emergency situation not as far as I can recall last time I remember is when Bush was president when Obama was president then you know we had significant debates over spending the budgets that the Democratic Congress passed were abysmal once Republicans get in control for Congress has been emergency measures all the way down here's the problem if you're never willing to shut down the government if you're never willing to actually have these hard-headed contacts if you're never willing to actually have conversations about what needs to stay and what needs to go you're never going to get to anything remotely approaching fiscal responsibility just a disaster and the fact that so many supposed fiscal conservatives are looking the other way on this demonstrates that some of the tea party was a lie there are a lot of people who are tea partiers who were saying they wanted lower government spending but they only wanted lower government spending when they thought Democrats were doing it the minute it's Trump in charge and the Republicans in charge they're willing to look the other way because after all tax cuts and defense spending and if we have to get those things that I guess we can blow out spending like it's like it's 2009 just ridiculous a ridiculous deal there is no reason that Republican should have signed off on it and it is a disgrace to a Republican party that does it no longer represents anything it no longer represents anything that that means anything when it comes to government when it comes to smaller government or go limitations just terrible okay so in just a second I'm gonna give you the latest update on memo fights 2018 but first I wanna say thank you to our sponsors over at

certain point you can only say memo fight so many times before you start to get a sore throat but there is more information on memo fight okay so Devin Nunez has essentially uncovered their then the new memo that's going to come out is going to cover the fact that apparently Hillary State Department was funneling information to Christopher Steele via a few of Hillary Clinton's special allies but basically Christopher Steele was making a Trump dossier based on Hillary sources providing the information to the the John Kerry State Department which was staffed by Hillary holdovers and Hillary friends and they were passing that information on to the spy Christopher Steele to pass it on to the FBI right that's the chain of events well now the guy who was in the middle of that the guy at the State Department got and Jonathan Winer he is writing about this in the pages of the Washington Post here's what he writes he writes House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunez announced last week that the next phase of his investigation of the events that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Muller will focus on the State Department his apparent area of interest is my relationship with former British intelligence professional Christopher Steele and my role and materials still ultimately shared with the FBI so he says here's the real story in the 1990s I was a senior official at the State Department and he worked on Russian matters after 1999 I left the State Department developed a legal and consulting problem practice that involved Russian matters in 2009 I met and became friends with Steele after he retired from British government service focusing on Russia Steele was providing business intelligence on the same kind of issues I worked on at the time in 2013 I returned to the State Department at the request of Secretary of State John Kerry over the years Steele and I had discussed many matters relating to Russia he asked me whether the State Department would like copies of new information as he developed it I contacted Victoria Nuland a career diplomat and Hilary hack who's an Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs and shared with her several of Steele's reports she told me they were useful asked me to continue to send them so in other words Steele was providing the State Department with information that had nothing to do with Trump but did have to do with Russia this is the guy's contention in the summer of 2016 Steele told me he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump his campaign and senior Russian officials he did not provide details but made clear the information involved active measures of Soviet intelligence term for propaganda and related activities to influence events in other countries in September 2016 Steele that I met in Washington and discussed the information now known as the dossier Steele sources suggested that the Kremlin not only had been behind the hacking of the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but had also compromised Trump and developed ties with his associates in campaigns and now Steele wasn't just blabbing to the FBI he was blabbing to the State Department which has no power to really do anything in this matter the FBI presumably should be the one telling the State Department what it needs to know right it's their job to do that it's not Christopher Steele's job to do that he says he was allowed to review but not to keep a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department I prepared a two-page summary and shared it with Newland who indicated that she felt the Secretary of State needed to be where it made aware of the material and then here's where it gets good in late September says it Jonathan Winer the State Department hack I spoke with an old friend Sidney Blumenthal whom I met there years ago when I was investing the iran-contra affair right Sidney Blumenthal is the lead Hillary axe person in the Western world I mean he was the dirty muckraker he went after you remember the background in Clinton administration Sidney Blumenthal sued Matt Drudge there's a big deal while talking about the hacking apparently all right well then he got to talking about the hacking and Blumenthal discussed steals reports he showed Winer notes gathered by a journalist I did not know Cody Shearer another Blumenthal Hillary hack that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature what struck me was how some of the material echoed steals but appeared to involve different sources on my own I shared a copy of these notes with Steele to ask for his professional reaction he told me his potentially collateral information I asked what that meant them and then it was confirmatory information so in other words this guy at the State Department was funneling information to steal now here's the question let's say that he knew there was that there was terrible stuff going on why was he funneling it to steal and not directly to the FBI right he works for the government why didn't Joe Nathan whiner just take the information he was receiving from Hillary's flax and forwarding that on to the FBI as opposed to funneling it through steel the answer is that he sent it to steel because if he had sends it directly from the State Department to the FBI the FBI would have said where did you get a Jonathan and he would have had to say Sidney Blumenthal and the FBI would have go on you got to be kidding me we're not even taking a look at this what does it be funneled into Christopher steel steel could obscure the source of the information and then the FBI would take that for a FISA warrant right that's the most plausible possible explanation here so there is something dirty going on maybe wine or since I'm in no position to judge the accuracy of the information generated by steel or sure but as alarmed at Russia's role in the 2016 election I believe all Americans should be alarmed and United in the search for truth but this wasn't about the search for truth of the war you would have provided it to the government not to Christopher steel who has at best an ancillary spy on Russian issues so yeah and this is it this is a serious problem that's not the only serious problem apparently there's a story out today people I think are taking this a little bit too much I think that I think they're reading too much into this there's a story today out from ed Henry at Fox News he says that Senator Mark Moore a top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee who've been leading a congressional investigation into president Trump's alleged ties to Russia had extensive contact last year with a lobbyist for Russian oligarch who's offering Warner access to former British spy and dossier author Christopher Steele the text messages obtained exclusively by Fox News so Warner texted this lobbyist who was in the pocket of the Russians we have so much to discuss you need to be careful but we can help our country Walden says I'm in he had ties to Hillary Clinton as well as to Russia so that was not the extent of the of the text according to the text exchanges Warner seemed particularly intense I'm connecting directly with Steel without anyone else on the Senate Intelligence Committee being in the loop at least initially in one text to the lobbyist Warner Road who'd rather not have a paper trail of his messages an aides Warner confirmed to fox news that the messages were authentic the messages were obtained by a Republican source marked confidential and are not classified they're turned over to the Senate panel by Waldman last September Waldman is best known for signing a 40,000 dollar monthly retainer in 2008 and 2009 to lobby the US government on behalf of a controversial Russian billionaire who's connected with the Russian government so an aide to Richard Burr who's the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee he told Fox News that Burr was aware of the contact Warner had made with Steele's representatives he said I don't believe he was aware of the content of the text messages initially now Bert is defending this okay sobre here's the part where I say Republicans could read too much into this so the way they could read too much into this is by ignoring the fact that Richard Burr says this isn't a big deal so Morris text messages were quietly given to the Intelligence Committee after he and burr signed a joint request for the messages last June Warner and burr privately informed the rest of the Democratic and Republican senators on the panel of Warner's text messages in a meeting last October a Warner aide acknowledged that Warner and Burr revealed the text to their colleagues on the panel because quote they realized out of context it doesn't look great but aides to warn remember both stressed the chairman was kept apprised of Warner's effort so in other words it looks like the Republicans knew about these text messages that said you know if they didn't you know and this is where I say you can reach much into this if they didn't then that would be troublesome Marco Rubio suggesting that it's not a big deal he tweeted out today senator Warner fully disclosed this to the committee four months ago has had zero impact on our work the real question is whether the Republicans were being kept contemporaneously advised of Mark Warner reaching out via Russian sources - Christopher Steele if the answer is yes if the Republicans were aware then it's not a big deal if however they were not aware then it could theoretically be a big deal it looked like the Democrats were fishing for information from Christopher Steele without knowledge of the Republicans which is not a particularly great thing okay so there's a little bit more here here's another story as well that that is I think troubling and this one is not really about Trump it's more about Hillary Clinton it's gotten dramatic under play in the media I'm gonna get to that in just a second but first you're gonna have to go over to Daley wire calm and subscribe for $9.99 a month

this final story that you need to know about today in the news roundup of scandal so an FBI informant according to the hill connected to the uranium one controversy told three congressional committees in a written statement that Russia routed millions of dollars to America with the expectation it would be used to benefit Bill Clinton's charitable efforts well Secretary of State Hillary Clinton quarterbacked a reset in us-russian relations the informants name is Douglas Campbell he said in a statement obtained by the hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm a PCO worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration and more specifically Hillary Clinton Democrats have cast doubt on Campbell's credibility so they're gonna have a big battle over all of this so again it sounds like there's more to the Iranian one scandal than the media were willing to cover or let on early on we will follow that as it as it continues okay so time for a couple things I like then a couple things I hate and will mailbag it up so things I like so today there's a good book out by Douglas Murray it's called the strange death of Europe it talks all about in a not unsympathetic way the problems with mass migration into Europe particularly Islamic mass migration into Europe failures of assimilation inside Europe and how this is posing threats the future of the of the continent and Western civilization as a whole it is well worth the read it is sobering for sure check it out Douglas Murray's the strange death of Europe okay so a couple of things that I hate so thing that I hate number one all right thing that I hate number one so on Siena and Alison camerata had on a Nazi why did she have on a Nazi because this Nazi won a GOP primary in Illinois now this schmuck wins a primary in Illinois every couple of years and the Republicans will refuse to sponsor him and throw him off the ballot that's gonna happen again this year but since the media are fully informed that they are the since the media are fully cognizant that they are trying to turn Republicans into Nazis it behooves them to find any Nazi who calls himself Republican and put them on TV they would never put Louis Farrakhan on TV or any member of the Congressional Black Caucus and ask them about Louis Farrakhan but they will do this with the subscribe for militant that said it does demonstrate the stupidity of Nazis she does a good job of grilling him for what that's worth are you a Nazi well for the past fifteen 20 years I have not had anything to do with any national socialist organization on a formal basis but do you call your side you'd have a ID I don't call myself and I say I call myself an American patriot and statesman okay well let me give our viewers some details about this just so they can decide for themselves you've been part of anti-semitic groups since the 1970s you go to neo-nazi rallies we have pictures of you there you are we're part of the white people's party you dressed in Nazi garb and you celebrate Hitler's birthday you're a Nazi well yes I mean I do love the one your first response I haven't been I haven't been like a formal Nazi for like 15 20 years okay well done dude so I Nazis stupid and bad thing I hate okay other things that I hate a woman is now claiming that the they choose force to flush her emotional support hamster down the toilet I am not kidding apparently an employee for Spirit Airlines allegedly demanded a young woman either let her pet hamster free outside the airport or flush it down the toilet leading her to choose the latter which is just yuck a 21 year old college student Florida native Belen Alda cocea informed the Miami Herald she'd ensured the emotional support hamster would not be a problem by contacting the airline prior to coming to the airport however once she tried to board the plane an employee for spirit allegedly told her to get rid of the animal as she could not board the flight otherwise with friends and family too far away and her age restricting her ability to rent a car she opted to flush the animal down the toilet which is like what wait what now like if you have it in a cage you couldn't just like leave it there or find a mailing depot you flush it you killed the animal okay so there's that number number two an emotional support hamster like we've seen emotional support peacocks how about this you know children like small children like my children they have what they call love ease right we're talking about like blankies or little stuffed animals how about that do that what is this emotional support hamster nonsense I can't wait for them to have emotional support snakes just so we can have snakes on the plane I'm really excited about that I want somebody have an emotional support Cobra and then we can actually there's snakes on the MFM plane I'm looking forward to that okay final thing that I hate so I have to go through this in detail because it is astonishing ly stupid astonishingly terrible so there is a piece that is out at a public called the forward the forward is a radical left publication every so often they asked me to write something for them sometimes I do sometimes I do not the publisher is pretty good about letting opposing views appear there but there's no question that it is a far left no it's it's a far left publication well they have a piece out today from a woman named Tamara Colton she's a female rabbi and psychologist in Birmingham Michigan now number one when most people say female rabbis there are some female rabbis who are knowledgeable but most female rabbis are in the Reconstructionist a reform movement and they're not very knowledgeable like is a is a lay Orthodox Jew and not a member of the priestly caste not another rabbi know a lot more than somebody like Tamara Colton just because I read the Bible on a regular basis how do I know I know more than she does because my god dude but here's what she wrote she wrote a piece basically saying that Adam and Eve is the first case of me - of hashtag me - and I have to explain this because it's so insane this execrable journey into biblical exegesis goes so far off the rails that actually starts running Harrison Ford down Harrison Ford actually has to run to avoid the engine of stupidity turning the ground up after him he has to dive into a ravine to avoid it and only later does he find out that he can get rid of his leg chains I mean it's just terrible anyway here is Tamera Colton so she says quote as a 47 year old woman rabbi I've become emboldened by these brave young women to speak a truth that I've known in my heart for a long time but have been hesitant to share the time has come for me to step forward - it's time we all acknowledge an overwhelmingly powerful source of shame and silence in the Bible okay now you'd expect her to go from here to like the stop in Leviticus about virginity until marriage or like the stuff in Leviticus about homosexuality or the stuff in Leviticus about forbidden sexual relationships mail order the stuff in Jewish tradition about modesty right yeah that's where you would expect her to go it would be stupid but that's where you would expect her to go but that's not where she goes instead she goes to Adam and Eve now you ask how does Adam and Eve have anything to do with with me - oh well let rabbi Colton tell you quote the story that begins the Bible the first one that we learned in Sunday school the founding story of man and woman upheld for thousands of years by judeo-christian religion is actually the first is actually the story of the first sexual assault of a woman the woman's name is Eve and the perpetrator is God does she read like English or Greek or Hebrew or any human language okay here are a few words that describe this stupid fatuous harebrained doltish preposterous asinine ridiculous ludicrous imbecilic there's just a few words that come to mind the story of Adam Adam has literally nothing to do with sexual assault it has to do with Eve disobeying a direct command from God not to eat from a certain tree she eats from the tree at the behest of the snake who tells her that nothing bad will happen and the God has been lying to her it turns out God is not in fact lying to her and then he says what did you do and then she makes an excuse for it and then he curses her with pain and childbirth and curses Adams have to till the ground with the sweat of his brow okay that's the story what in the world does that have to do with sexual assault nothing nothing but here's what she says quote I want you to think about this here is a young beautiful intelligent naked woman living in a state of grace she's hungry so she does the most natural thing in the world and eats a piece of fruit for following her instincts trusting herself and nourishing her body she is punished her punishment she will never again feel safe in her nakedness she'll never again love her body she will never again know her body as a place of sacred sovereignty but to to paraphrase Shakespeare what the f there is no way to read that story and come away with that here is the relevant verbiage from the book of Genesis quote for God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be open and you will be like God knowing good and evil right this is what the snake says when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it she also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it then the eyes of both of them were open and they realized they were naked so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves you notice anything there about like horrific pains of hunger that she had to be sated with only this fruit as opposed to all the other trees in the garden which God has said she can eat from is there anything there about God shaming her for her nakedness or is it that she eats a piece of fruit realizes she's naked and then feels ashamed because she feels that she has misused her purpose in the world which is what the story is really about right none of this makes any sense but Colton's not done she says what have you done God thunders Eve wants to defend herself but she's too ashamed to speak Eve our first mother whose name means the mother of all living things is silence much the way the patience of dr. Delany Nassar were no here's the actual Bible quote then the Lord God said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent deceived me and I ate where was she silenced exactly he asked her a question and she answered the question but this is so I mean it's just so stup the story is not about men violating women God commands Adam that commands Eve he punishes them both he punishes the snake the end that's the whole story you have to be a moron to come up with this with this pathetic interpretation but I guess when you are a hammer everything looks like a nail and when you're a meat you hammer everything including stories that have nothing to do with me to look like a nail my goodness the stupidity Wow high-level stupidity okay time for some mail bag let's mail bag this up alright so if you have live questions now is the time to ask them in daily wear chat box and no I will not answer questions about pudding or Michael Moses evening attire just horrifying okay Lowell says I feel modern libertarianism is gaining popularity after seeing Gary Johnson's gain from the 2012 to 2016 elections and when I feel is a growing popularity from Rand Paul libertarian leanings why in your opinion is the Libertarian Party not prominence in the government today because they suck at everything as the answer okay the libertarian party convention was a crap show it was a guy running out naked with an iron cross there's a bunch of people like John McAfee talking about legalizing acid okay that's not what you'll lead with if you're the libertarians if you're the libertarians why you go get some decent candidates who can talk in conservative slash libertarian tones about the necessity for small government and how that leads to freedom why is it that I'm better representative of libertarian than Gary Johnson why is it that I'm a better representative liberal of libertarianism than anyone who's on the stage at the libertarian party convention it makes you think that the libertarian party is actually a giant scam to get you to give them lots of money and then not earn enough of the vote to actually be put under severe government scrutiny because my goodness how else could you explain the supreme incompetence at every level of the libertarian party plus again they've elevated members of the libertarian party who are soft defense libertarians which is not smart and people who say that are sort of almost anarcho-capitalists to the top levels of the libertarian party well that is a that is not an electoral position for victory now that says hi Ben I'm a Christian but I don't believe in original sin I have to pay for what Adam did wrong what is the Jewish Vilnius so the Jewish view is that original sin is not about you have a sin that must be relieved by God's grace that is imbued in you because of original sin there is no concept of original sin in Judaism in that sense what original sin is is that Adam committed the sin of disobeying God and this led us to I think there are a few interpretations obviously of this story but I think that the one that I like the best is the interpretation that essentially says that before man ate from the tree of knowledge there was a full identity between what things were for and what they were meaning that just as in the Aristotelian notion if a watch is is made for telling time then man was made to do certain things and fruit worm was made to fulfill certain needs and animals were made to fulfill certain tasks right everything was made for its purpose and we could see that but we didn't necessarily have our own logic as to morality right God's morality was our morality once we supplanted our morality for God's morality that led us to an inordinate number of conflicts that prevented us in any real sense from seeing paradise because the world around us started to look malevolent as opposed to looking like what it was the world is just the world and the world fulfills a purpose that is not our own right the world that fills a purpose that is God's the idea of original sin that has to be expiated I don't think that's right the the Judaism doesn't it does right you do some things that human beings are human beings and that the capacity for sin is comes along with the capacity for freewill and that that cannot be expiated by the sacrifice of another person or a person in the form of God that that's not a thing sacrifices that you bring in Jewish tradition are to expiate your own personal sin not to expiate sins of the past Kevin says with all of the bombshells about the FBI and at DoD at Obama's DOJ coming bout well Hillary Clinton finally be indicted or has the time passed a bit jaded with our government I seriously doubt she'll be indicted I seriously doubt she'll be indicted as well number one you'd have to have such strong evidence to indict her at this point after the FBI basically cleared her last year that I think that the impetus for inciting her would be would be pretty weak I also think that even if there's a political argument and an argument from a country basis then inciting her might not be the smartest move just because I could see this really quickly leading to a situation where whoever runs in an election and loses gets indicted by the other side as sort of Banana Republic stuff even though everyone should be held accountable to the law and I think Hillary should have been indicted last year I think that now it looks more to the public like a revenge play by Trump's DOJ or FBI then it would look like a real investigation I mean nobody trusts the DOJ and the FBI on the right nobody trusts the DOJ and the FBI on the left I'm not sure this would restore that trust Ricky says hey Ben my listen you speak about the memo released and how your major qualms with that is the idea it shows a target of Donald Trump you don't agree necessarily shows that the question I than is this how does it dossier that is almost exclusively about tunneled from justify a warrant against Carter page unless the thing they're investigating page four is related to Donald Trump well we haven't actually seen the FISA application according to the reports of the FISA application they're not really about Trump the stuff that Papadopoulos might be so it's possible that some of it involves Trump Russia collusion and they think Carter page is a part of that because he was part of the Trump campaign but the stuff in the steel dossier is not just about Trump right I mean it is about Trump Russia campaign collusion but the stuff that was specifically referencing Carter page also had to do with Carter page making specific outreach moved toward the Russian government so if it was entirely about Trump then you could say that the FISA warrant was I guess targeting Trump in ancillary fashion but let me let me let me backtrack for just a second if the question is was the FBI only targeting Trump what the carter page warrant the answer is maybe but the investigation started before carter page so it's actually two separate questions you can believe that the FBI was was targeting Trump with the Carter page warrant the question is was that legit or not or was the Carter page weren't trumped up in order to get Trump and the answer is not supremely clear if there was independent evidence to go after Trump anyway and this was just part of that general investigation as opposed to Carter page initiated the investigation and that's the only evidence that we have that Trump did anything wrong so if I if I made the implication that the FBI was quote-unquote not out to get Trump at all or that they thought Trump was not involved at all I don't think that the FBI thought Trump was not out that Trump was not involved at all the FBI probably did think that Trump was involved in some way but out to get Trump and thinks Trump involved is involved in some way are two separate contentions it's two separate contentions okay so let's see Joseph says hey mr. Shapiro having listened to your discussion a few weeks ago with Sam Harris it brought to my attention that some atheists believe there's no such thing as free will can you in a simple words as possible explain this to me am i incorrect they believe they're just balls of meat floating through the cosmos and that everything supposedly happens due to random chance I may be off wouldn't those circumstances be essentially the epitome of free will okay so there's two ways to read free well there is the but for choice that you actually have the capacity to make a choice this is how people traditionally thought of free well I can choose right now to say the next sentence I can choose not to say the next is up to me it's not determined by my environment it's not determined by by genetics that I do have but for free well we don't understand how it works but that's the way that it works right that you do control your own action you have the capacity for change then there is the version of free will that is essentially passive free well suggesting that random chance governs human behavior and that there's no way to fully predictably say what exactly you're gonna do next right I think that sam Harris's version of free will which isn't really free will at all as he is correct as he correctly points out it's just suggesting that random chance has a role in what we say and what we do but if you can't control that random chance then it's not freewill right there the words free and will neither of them apply you're talking about random chance governing that is the significant difference and so the question for me is how can you propose that human beings be active in the universe when activity is formally banned by your definition of free well Isaac says what is your patient opinion on the house of Israel are they forever removed from the Covenant or will God someday bring them back in well I'm Jewish so I don't think that they were ever removed from the Covenant right in the Christian viewpoint you have to ask drew and Michael because they're Christian what they what they think of the house of Israel and where it stands in the Covenant but from the Jewish perspective we are still the covenant and that covenant is it was never broken that so end of story that Ryan says hey man I'm currently in grad school in New York to be a teacher so is there a lot of conversation about racism toward people of color I recall you saying on one of your shows Jewish people became white as soon as we became successful can you give me some examples of discrimination against Jewish people in American history sure the Harvard Law School for a long time had quotas on Jewish students at the law school country clubs around the country used to ban Jews there restaurants that ban Jews there were housing projects that banned Jews there were there stores that banned Jews there's an entire movie about this called gentlemen's agreements about hotels that ban Jews with Gregory Peck I mean won Best Picture in 1948 so you can check that out as well my house has been who is your favorite singer of all time well opera singer Pavarotti non opera singer you have to go with Sinatra for his phrasing although I do have a sneaking fondness for Mel Torme now Patrick says hey Ben I recently went to a facility that give me the to give plasma and was able to get paid for my contribution if you can call it that that got me thinking what would be the ethical implications of offering to sell parts of our own bodies should an organ be able to be sold if the owner is willing to take money for it what would be the impact on the organ donation system so I always been in favor of an Oregon market I'm in favor of the idea that you should be able to sell your kidney or a cellular or cell a lobe of your liver if they can do a liver transplant that the there'd have to be some stringent regulations about like you're not allowed to kill yourself for the money you're not allowed to kill a family member for the money there'd have to be some actual stringent regulations with regard to this but it seems to me it is a much better solution to the organ shortage then attempting to determine if somebody is dead or not and then harvesting their organs now I know says you spoke of your favorite sci-fi books what are your top three sci-fi movies so I actually named these the other day I'm trying to remember what I said about it so I'm not gonna count fantasy in my sci-fi rankings here and I'm not gonna give you three I'm gonna give you a bunch okay because there there are a lot of sci-fi movies that I love so obviously Star Wars is up there all boats slash fantasy probably in just in terms of pure sci-fi I think Blade Runner 2049 was really good this year I thought that it was top-notch I liked interstellar a lot I liked a lot of these are modern films Planet of the Apes is the oldest sci-fi film that's really good plan of the ages terrific the original with Charlton Heston let's see the was the one I what's the one Tom Cruise edge of tomorrow thank you the worst title in human history where they had actually retitled didn't really set his live repeat die because that was a live die repeat well is what it was and so so and then in case that that's a very very good sci-fi movie there been a bunch of them recently I thought arrival was quite good they're a Close Encounters of the Third Kind I'll have to make a complete list and put it up on Twitter but they're a bunch of them et is a really good movie yeah I love sci-fi and I love sci-fi flicks Tommy says Ben how important do you think it is for all Americans to read the memos everyone seems to have an opinion but few seams of Reddit is this folly yes everyone should read the memos and please if you want to solve the question as to whether the FBI was explicitly targeting Trump with the Carter phage the Carter page FISA ward again by the way quick note on what I said before about the the page warrant I think it's worthwhile noting that none of that stuff leaked until after the election and also it is worth noting that when it comes to the Carter page FISA warrant that the application for the warrant still has not made been puttan didn't made public by President Trump who can do it right now we can declassify it right now I wish he would so that we can find out what exactly was in it and what exactly wasn't in it mark says hi Ben if you had complete control of the process how would you fix Social Security I would privatize the entire thing I'd say to people it's your money maybe you have make it an opt-out system where default is that a certain amount of your money goes into a Social Security trust fund just for you but you actually get to opt out now what I would do to finance the remaining Social Security that's on the books is you would have to presumably sell bonds and borrow to finance Social Security but you can have to cut up a cut-off point now or there's not gonna be any cutoff point later basically everyone who's already on Social Security gets paid what they're owed on Social Security and when I say what their Oh Timon what they've been promised and people who are maybe five ten years away from Social Security get to opt into an optional system or not and below that we're going to encourage you to to take your money out and put in the stock market and they'd says why can't the Democrats point to something that Trump actually did as an example of the alleged collusion or as collusion just a meaningless term at this point it's a meaningless term at this point it means anything that they don't like that there there are a couple things here that are problematic george papadapolis going to london and soliciting information from a Russian source about Hillary Clinton emails and the Donald Trump jr. meeting at Trump Tower those are the two big ones other than that I have seen no I've seen no evidence of Russian collusion whatsoever at this point okay Jim says with all this talk of Russia Russia Russia could you please explain these areas in which US Russian interests coincide and come into conflict well the real answer is Russia sometimes once you take out Islamic regimes that threaten them sometimes Russia wants to crack down on Islamic radicals in Chechnya for example but aside from that we do not have a lot of cons coinciding interests with the Russian regime it is a an incredibly self-interested regime it is a regime that is interested in maximization of Vladimir Putin's personal power so there there's not a lot of crossover there other than maintaining status of non nuclear war I would think gabe's has been I'm in law school and leave every class in despair because the Supreme Court seems to have trampled the Constitution had every available opportunity at least since the 1930s should we as conservatives and originalist be worried that we are past the point of no return when it comes to judicial review and the super legislative function of the courts yes I mean we should have been worried about that back in the 30s which is why as I have stated repeatedly I've been trying to hold to this paper for years I wonder if Harvard actually has it I have to call them up I wrote my third year law paper on why judicial review should essentially be undone the idea that judiciary gets to overrule the legislature on behalf of an Oleg our key of those chosen not elected seems supremely anti-republican to me Nate says hey Ben I'm a Christian I attend and one of the topics that the world beats Christians up on so much his evolution pretended Li toured the ISM on this topic I think God can be the creator and evolution can still exist where do you stand on this issue of course I think that that's the case I think that God can use whatever natural mechanism he chooses and God tries to in order for God to assume your faith he's not going to show you miracles every day unless you're looking for them when unless you see miracles in the natural world and in the system of God's laws in fact Newton was more likely to see miracles in the systematization of the universe than he was to see miracles in you know the splitting of the Red Sea I think that God can use whatever mechanism he chooses in order to in order to forward the possibilities of humanity and that's what he did with evolution in my opinion there's a great book called God in the Big Bang and by a Gerard wives were escaping me today Gerald Schroeder journal Schroeder I can check that out it's all about the the consonants between the Bible and evolutionary theory and the theories of the Big Bang really fascinating stuff okay so we've reached the end of today's nearly endless mailbag we'll be back here on Monday to discuss all of the latest have a wonderful weekend please don't ruin things or there will be no Disneyland for you I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
