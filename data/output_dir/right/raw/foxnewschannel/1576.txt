1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,537
EYE SOMETHING CROOKED AT THE

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,438
FBI.

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:07,007
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,910
ANGLE.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,845
ON SUNDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,648
HAD ENOUGH.

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,782
HE POINTEDLY TWEETED I HEREBY

8
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,485
DEMAND AND WILL DO SO OFFICIALLY

9
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,653
TOMORROW THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:20,754
JUSTICE LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:26,493
THE FBI, DOJ INFILTRATED OR

12
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,294
SURVEILLED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

13
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,328
FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES AND IF

14
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,897
ANY SUCH DEMANDS OR REQUESTS

15
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,798
WERE MADE BY PEOPLE WITHIN THE

16
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,301
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

17
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,504
WELL, TRUMP HAS A GOOD SENSE.

18
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,640
THIS IS NOTHING NEW IN A WAY.

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,908
ON MARCH 4TH 2017, MORE THAN A

20
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,577
YEAR AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP

21
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,046
CONTENDED THAT HIS PHONES WERE

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,680
TAPPED JUST PRIOR TO THE

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,815
ELECTION AND OF COURSE THEY GET

24
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,051
TRUMP MEDIA IN THE DEEP STATE

25
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,852
ALL DISMISSED IT.

26
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,254
IT WAS ALL A BUNCH OF NONSENSE.

27
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,022
WHILE OF COURSE WE NOW KNOW THAT

28
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:59,259
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SOUGHT

29
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,294
AND SECURED PERMISSION TO

30
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,028
SURVEILLED TRUMP ADVISOR CARTER

31
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:01,795
PAGE, WHOM YOU WILL HEAR FROM

32
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,030
THEM JUST A MOMENT.

33
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,468
THE PROBLEM WAS THE 2016 PAGE

34
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,437
FISA WARRANT WAS OBTAINED IN

35
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,004
PART USING FRAUDULENT

36
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,840
INFORMATION FROM THAT INFAMOUS

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,741
STEELE DOSSIER PAID FOR BY THE

38
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,877
CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

39
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:17,844
RESET YOUR BRAIN FOR A MOMENT.

40
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,047
THINK ABOUT THAT.

41
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,050
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL

42
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,118
ELECTION, WHEN A MAN WHO IS

43
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:25,852
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS BOWING

44
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,255
TO DRAIN THE SWAMP, THERE COULD

45
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,590
HAVE BEEN A PLOT HATCHED AT THE

46
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,860
SENIOR LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENT

47
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,594
TO ENTRAP SECONDARY FIGURES IN

48
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,297
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO ULTIMATELY

49
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,335
GET TO DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF.

50
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,069
THEN THOSE FIGURES WERE TARGETED

51
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:46,573
AND SURVEILLED, AGAIN, EVEN

52
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,708
POSSIBLY TRUMP HIMSELF.

53
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,877
WHILE OF COURSE DEMOCRATS

54
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,514
LAUGHED, LAUGHED ALL OF THIS OFF

55
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:58,852
AS CONSPIRATORS.

56
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,520
>> THIS CLAIM, THAT THERE IS A

57
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,521
POLITICAL SPY EMBEDDED IN THE

58
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,190
TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NONSENSE AND

59
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,891
YOU HEAR IT IN THE SAME TERMS

60
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,193
THAT TRUMP OFTEN SPEAKS, WHICH

61
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,894
IS PEOPLE ARE SAYING OR I'M

62
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,862
HEARING OR WE ARE BEING TOLD,

63
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,031
THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING

64
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,199
THIS IS PATENTLY UNTRUE, BUT WE

65
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,036
WOULD LIKE TO SPREAD IT ANYWAY

66
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,904
AND IT IS SINGLE HE DESTRUCTIVE

67
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,873
OF OUR INSTITUTIONS, BUT THEN,

68
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,807
THAT'S THE POINT.

69
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,541
>> Laura: NO.

70
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,910
THE POINT IS DAY BY DAY WE LEARN

71
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,713
MORE INFORMATION THAT SEEMS TO

72
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,815
INDICATE THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY

73
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,651
HAVE USED ITS PROSECUTORIAL AND

74
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,853
INVESTIGATIVE POWERS FOR A

75
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:33,653
POLITICAL END.

76
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,087
TO DO WHAT?

77
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,823
WELL, TO STOP CANDIDATE TRUMP,

78
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,059
AND WHEN THAT FAILED, TO DERAIL

79
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,295
HIS PRESIDENCY.

80
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,064
THIS IS THE DEEP STATE IN

81
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,699
ACTION.

82
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,167
I THINK IT'S REALLY UNWISE TO

83
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:47,901
DISMISS OUT OF HAND THE NOTION

84
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,704
THAT THE FBI COULD HAVE FOUND IT

85
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:51,371
WITHIN ITSELF TO SPY ON THE

86
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,172
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

87
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,074
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.

88
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,577
WHILE AS THE FEDERALIST DAVID

89
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,945
REMINDS US, JOHN BRENNAN SPIED

90
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,248
ON THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND

91
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,450
LIED ABOUT IT TO THE AMERICAN

92
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:03,784
PEOPLE.

93
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,619
JAMES CLAPPER SPIED ON THE

94
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,953
AMERICAN PEOPLE THROUGH A

95
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,789
DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM

96
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,058
AND LIED ABOUT IT TO CONGRESS.

97
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,660
AND ALTHOUGH THE OBAMA

98
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,394
ADMINISTRATION NEVER TWEETED ANY

99
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,029
NASTY ATTACKS ON JOURNALISTS, IT

100
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,433
DID SPY ON AND PROSECUTE THEM.

101
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,569
IT'S COMPLETELY PLAUSIBLE THAT

102
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,770
THOSE IN THE UPPER ECHELON OF

103
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,473
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOUGHT TRUMP AS

104
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,841
A THREAT, THEN USED WOBBLY

105
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,911
EVIDENCE AS THE PRETEXT TO

106
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,247
INVESTIGATE HIS CAMPAIGN.

107
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,715
A GREAT PIECE, BY THE WAY.

108
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,050
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW THE

109
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,251
PRESIDENT AND THE HOUSE INTEL

110
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,986
COMMITTEE LED BY DEVIN NUNES HAS

111
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:44,891
SOUGHT THE INITIAL UNREDACTED

112
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,559
DOCUMENTS THAT SPARKED THIS

113
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,260
COLLUSION BROKE.

114
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,695
WELL TODAY, THE FBI DIRECTOR AND

115
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,532
THE DEPUTY AG HAVE AGREED TO

116
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,600
GIVE CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS

117
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,035
ACCESS TO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED

118
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,903
DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE RUSSIA

119
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,337
PROBE.

120
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,406
NOW THEY WANT TO SEE THE

121
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,309
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE FBI

122
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,043
INFORMANT WHO REPORTEDLY COZIED

123
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,179
UP TO AT LEAST THREE TRUMP

124
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:06,613
ASSOCIATES.

125
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:11,885
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS GUY, A

126
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,786
SPY, AND INFORMANT OR JUST A

127
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:13,086
MOLE?

128
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,055
WHO CARES?

129
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,890
THAT'S JUST SEMANTICS.

130
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,858
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THE FBI

131
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,226
SENT THIS INFORMANT OUT TO MAKE

132
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,697
CONTACT WITH CARTER PAGE, GEORGE

133
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,267
PAPADOPOULOS AND SAM CLOVIS.

134
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,168
THIS INFORMANT REPORTEDLY HAD A

135
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,971
SITDOWN WITH CARTER PAGE IN

136
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,874
EARLY JULY OF 2016.

137
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,675
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING,

138
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,011
BECAUSE THAT UNDERMINES FORMER

139
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,280
FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY'S

140
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,047
CONTENTION THAT THE FBI DIDN'T

141
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,316
BEGIN ITS INVESTIGATION UNTIL

142
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,520
LATE JULY.

143
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,089
INCIDENTALLY, BETWEEN 2012 ALL

144
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,891
THE WAY UP TO 2018, NOW,

145
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,127
ACCORDING TO PUBLIC RECORDS,

146
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,328
THIS SAME INFORMANT RECEIVED

147
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,731
MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS.

148
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,600
WHAT KIND OF GENERAL FOREIGN

149
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,736
POLICY RESEARCH.

150
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,171
AND HE CONDUCTED THIS ALL

151
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:05,939
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

152
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,506
DEFENSE.

153
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,474
THAT'S ANOTHER INTERESTING

154
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:07,774
POINT.

155
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,375
THAT'S ALL VERY FISHY.

156
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,877
COME ON.

157
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:11,645
MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THIS

158
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,246
AND THEY ARE UNANSWERED.

159
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,014
TODAY FOLLOWING THAT WHITE HOUSE

160
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,049
MEETING, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

161
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,651
HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THE JUSTICE

162
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,188
DEPARTMENT TO AUTHORIZE ANOTHER

163
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,356
INSPECTOR GENERAL PROBE INTO

164
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,459
THESE SPY ALLEGATIONS.

165
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,295
THE PROBLEM WITH REFERRING THIS

166
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,296
INVESTIGATION TO THE

167
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,063
INSPECTOR GENERAL, AS GOOD OF A

168
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,767
GUY AS HE IS, HE HAS NO

169
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:39,172
PROSECUTORIAL OR OFFICIAL

170
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,074
DOES FIND RANK ABUSE BY OBAMA

171
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,542
OFFICIALS OR PERHAPS, WHO KNOWS,

172
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,511
EVEN OBAMA HIMSELF, IF HE KNEW

173
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,212
ABOUT IT, THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

174
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,616
WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO REFER THAT

175
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:53,086
INFORMATION TO THE JUSTICE

176
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:53,486
DEPARTMENT.

177
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,187
WHAT GOOD DOES THAT END UP

178
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,989
DOING?

179
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,791
THE PRESIDENT AND ALL OF US DO

180
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,361
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE NAMES

181
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,028
OF ANY AND ALL AMERICANS WHO

182
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,665
WERE SURVEILLED AS PART OF THIS

183
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,467
ANTI-TRUMP HIT SQUAD OVER AT THE

184
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,668
DOJ.

185
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,703
AND WHEN WE FINALLY GET TO THE

186
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,804
BOTTOM OF ALL OF THIS WE SHOULD

187
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:14,240
HAVE THE NAMES OF ANY OFFICIALS

188
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,208
CURRENT OR FORMER WHO WERE PART

189
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,611
OF WHAT I BELIEVE WAS AN OBSCENE

190
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,179
ABUSE OF POWER.

191
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,549
THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE,

192
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,584
ALL OF THEM, TO THE FULLEST

193
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,453
EXTENT OF THE LAW.

194
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:30,090
AND OF COURSE THE $64,000

195
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,157
QUESTION IS WHO ELSE IN THE

196
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,125
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OTHER THAN

197
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,326
JIM COMEY, THE PEOPLE OF OTHER

198
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,795
HAVE ARTIE BEEN IDENTIFIED,

199
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,231
SIGNED OFF ON THIS, APPROVED OF

200
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,532
THIS?

201
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,201
HOW MUCH DID ATTORNEY GENERAL

202
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:41,801
LORETTA LYNCH KNOW ABOUT

203
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,471
CROSS FIRE HURRICANE?

204
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,505
AND WHILE THERE IS HISTORICAL

205
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,874
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE

206
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,476
AND THE DOJ ON ONGOING CASES,

207
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,879
KIND OF INDEPENDENT, YOU THINK

208
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,648
ABOUT IT, IT KIND OF IS

209
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,350
UNFATHOMABLE THAT JIM COMEY AND

210
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,984
COMPANY WOULD CONDUCT AN

211
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:03,790
OPERATION LIKE THIS ONE WITHOUT

212
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,357
AT LEAST INFORMING THE

213
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,091
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

214
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,060
OF COURSE THAN BARACK OBAMA.

215
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,162
AS LONG AS THESE QUESTIONS HANG

216
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,699
OUT THERE, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT

217
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,933
AMERICANS, MORE AND MORE OF THEM

218
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,902
ARE GOING TO THINK THAT OUR

219
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,104
GOVERNMENT TRIED AND MAYBE IS

220
00:07:18,104 --> 00:00:00,000
