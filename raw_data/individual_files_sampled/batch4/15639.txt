former Prime Minister Tony Blair says he doesn't think the moderates can take back the Labour Party Tony Blair is back he's sticking his neck in politics again it's always weird seeing him isn't it since it ever since he stopped being Prime Minister all those years ago and he just occasionally comes back looking a bit more old a bit older a bit more orange and infinitely more sinister and this time he's done an interview with Nick Robinson for the BBC and he said that he doubts that labour could be taken back by the moderates now my first issue with this is moderates I mean Blair really does consider himself a moderate so he must think that by scaling back Labour's tend socialist tendencies and embracing captors and a little bit more and not hating the Jews quite as much as kolben makes him a moderate but I'm sorry may though it doesn't really work like that because opening the borders which is what Tony Blair did and is what his speechwriter andrew neither admitted to have having done just to rub the noses of the right and diversity quote that's what he said that's not what a moderate does is there I don't think that's a moderate thing for politician to do neither is brushing aside the working-class as racist something that a moderate does I think a moderate considers the needs of the working class the middle class and working classes and works alongside them to maintain policies that actually represent them Tony Blair didn't do that he opened the borders destroyed society and created a whole new system that now has left this country looking pretty unrecognizable I don't think that's what I'll moderate does but whatever you want to call the anti Corbin labor rights the Blair eyes basically but the new era of Blair Rights Blair doesn't think that they can win back the party and I think that he's probably right on this the BBC reports the former Labour leader told the BBC's Nick Robinson labour had been through a profound change under Jeremy Corbyn it's a different type of Labour Party can it be take him back I don't know he said remarks provoked a backlash on Twitter and Corbin supporter Chris Williamson MP told the BBC the party had quote never been more United never been more United I got I don't know what else to say other than just a laugh at that never been more United okay mate sure John Landsman founder of the pro Corbin momentum movement said the party would never return to mr. Blair's policies well know they'll never return to Blair's capitalist policies or at least a middle ground sort of capitalist mixed economy policies but they will maintain these open borders policy that's something they'll definitely do now something that Corbin and Tony Blair share that's the thing this new breed of socialist in Corbin's Labour Party they're not following in the footsteps of the likes of Tony Benn now they're a totally new breed because these guys are internationalist socialists and I'm not sure how they think that is going to work because they want a big state they want high tax they want high immigration it's not going to work it's utterly confusing Tony Blair is right to say that the New Labour faction within the Labour Party won't be able to take the party back from jeremy corbyn's new old labour now this corbin movement is a movement that reflects the party's historic socialism but it's combined with Tony Blair's policy on open borders and they share a multicultural vision for the country despite the differences they do share that profound vision for what Britain should become and this new movement this new old labour is crazy it's extremist it's violent and it's aggressive and it's not going to stop more Labour MPs are losing votes of no confidence in their local parties these are the quote moderates that Tony Blair talks about as far left extremists come out of the woodwork emboldened by Corbin many of these people have been there lying waiting for their moment in the Labour Party and many of them have actually just come over in recent years to support Jeremy Corbyn John Ryan Labour MP for Enfield North lost a vote of no-confidence and so did Gavin shuka from Luton the far left of the party is attacking Blair's old guard and I suspect that many anti Corbin MPs are going to be deselected before the next general elections catch up with all the rebel stories on our brand new app which you can download now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
