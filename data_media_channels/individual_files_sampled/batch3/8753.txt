THEY DON'T MENTION IMPEACHMENT. THEY USE ON USE UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS WITH GUNS TO CROSS THE PRESIDENCY. THE WORST PART IS THAT IT'S WORKING. BYRON YORK FOR THE "WASHINGTON EXAMINER." JONATHAN TURLEY, THEY BOTH JOIN US TONIGHT. PROFESSOR, FIRST TO YOU, WHY NOT JUST SAY WE WANT TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, WE THINK WE'VE COMMITTED HIGH TIME, CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, THEY DO THINK THAT. WHY SHOULD THAT BE EMBARRASSING, IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURE? THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD BE OPEN ABOUT IT IF THAT IS THEIR MOTIVATION. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE PREFERRED ROUTE FOR THE CONSTITUTION IS TO HAVE A TRIAL IN THE SENATE AFTER IMPEACHMENT IN THE HOUSE, TO HAVE THAT DECISION. YOU CAN ALWAYS STILL IMPEACH SOMEONE ONCE THEY ARE REMOVED FROM OFFICE. THERE IS AN ONGOING ACADEMIC DEBATE WHETHER ANY SITTING PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED BUT MOST PROSECUTORS YIELD TO THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. Tucker: THERE'S NO DEBATE OVER WHAT'S THE MOST DEMOCRATIC MECHANISM FOR DEALING WITH THE PRESIDENT WHO'S DONE SOMETHING WRONG, IT'S BY USING THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT VOTERS ELECTED, CORRECT? THAT'S THE PREFERRED WAY. THE FACT IS THAT THE FRAMERS GAVE US A PROCESS BY WHICH WE COULD FIRST IMPEACH AND THEN REMOVE THE PRESIDENT. AS LONG AS YOU CAN PROVE HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, CLEARLY SOME DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS ARE RUNNING ON THAT. I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM, FRANKLY WITH TRUMP ALSO RUNNING ON THAT. I THINK FOR HIM TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT MY IMPEACHMENT, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT IS AN UNDERLYING NARRATIVE FOR THE OTHER SIDE. BUT I THINK WHAT WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN FIRST IS MUELLER WILL HAVE TO ISSUE A REPORT AND THEN IF CONGRESS CHANGES HANDS, PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUSE, YOU COULD VERY WELL SEE THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. Tucker: THE QUESTION OF THE SUBPOENA, WE SAW YET ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION LEAKED IN THE PRESS RECENTLY THAT THE MUELLER PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING SUBPOENAING A PRESIDENT. AT THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING WE MAY REJECT THAT. WHERE DOES IT STAND? THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T KNOW IF MUELLER IS REALLY GOING TO DO THIS. WE HAVE NEVER HAD THIS COME TO A CONFLICT IN HISTORY. THE NIXON CASE WAS ABOUT SUBPOENAING DOCUMENTS ABOUT EVIDENCE, NOT ACTUALLY TESTIMONY EVIDENCE, NOT ACTUALLY TESTIMON TESTIMONY. WITH BILL CLINTON, KEN STARR SUBPOENAED BILL CLINTON AND THEN THEY WORK SOMETHING OUT SO THAT KEN STARR WOULD WITHDRAW THE SUBPOENA WHILE BILL CLINTON TESTIFIED, BUT HE DID GET A FEW THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NOT GET IT, HE GOT TO KEEP HIS LAWYERS IN THE ROOM WITH HIM. IF HE DID IT ON VIDEO. HE DIDN'T GO TO A GRAND JURY ROOM, AND THE TIME WAS LIMITED. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE ACTUALLY DID TESTIFY. I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW WITH THIS CASE IS THAT TRUMP IS REALIZED, PERHAPS THAT THIS IS MORE OF A POLITICAL FIGHT, THIS IS AN IMPEACHMENT FIGHT MORE THAN ANYTHING. WHILE HIS LAWYERS TALKED ABOUT WHETHER A PRESIDENT CAN OR CANNOT BE SUBPOENAED OR CALLED TO TESTIFY, RUDY GIULIANI, WHO IS REALLY MORE OF A SPOKESMAN RIGHT NOW, AND OTHERS, ARE WORKING TO DISCREDIT THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, OR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IF IT DOES COME TO THE HOUSE BY THE WAY, THE REASONS DEMOCRATS ARE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE A MINORITY. Tucker: THEY ARE ALSO NOT TALKING ABOUT IT, MOST OF THEM. SOME FRINGE MEMBERS ARE. WERE MEMBER THE 2006 EXAMPLE WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH'S NUMBERS WERE JUST TERRIBLE. THE IRAQ WAR WAS GOING TERRIBLY. THE DEMOCRATS WERE RUNNING TO TRY TO WIN BACK CONGRESS IN THOSE MIDTERMS. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, BUT THE PUBLIC REALLY DIDN'T WANT IT. NANCY PELOSI CAME OUT ABOUT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR IN 2006 AND SAID IMPEACHMENT IS OFF THE TABLE. TODAY, 71% OF DEMOCRATS IN A RECENT POLL SAID THEY WANT TO SEE TRUMP IMPEACHED IF DEMOCRATS TAKE THE HOUSE. THE LEADERS KNOW THAT. Tucker: THAT'S WHY IT'S SO DISINGENUOUS TO DENY IT. IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM, AND YOU SHOULD BE, I WOULD SAY, WOULD YOU ALLOW HIM TO SPEAK TO ANYONE FROM ROBERT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION? THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION, BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE DEAL TO GO SOME TIME AGO AND SAT DOWN. I WROTE A COLUMN MONTHS AGO THAT SAID IT'S A GOOD DEAL IF THEY STICK WITH THE FOUR CATEGORIES THAT DOWD AND TY COBB NEGOTIATED THAT DOWD AND TY COBB NEGOTIATE NEGOTIATED. COULD YOU PREPARE THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT? I THINK YOU COULD. I THINK THAT WAS THE QUICKEST WAY TO DEFUSE THIS. THE QUESTION IS REALLY THE END GAME. IF YOU BASICALLY DEFY THE SUBPOENA, I THINK THAT HE WILL LOSE. THE EXISTING CASE LAW FAVORS MUELLER AND ONCE HE WINS IN THAT PROCESS YOU GIVE HIM A COURT ORDER WHERE YOU CAN NEGOTIATE WITH HIM BUT HE'S IN A MUCH STRONGER POSITION. HE COULD DEMAND AND A COURT COULD VERY WELL GO ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL GRAND JURY THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE END GAME THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO LAY OUT? I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT PEOPLE KEEP ON SAYING HE'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER, HE'S GOING TO BURST INTO FLAMES. I DISAGREE WITH THAT. I'VE DONE A LOT OF DEPOSITIONS THAT WERE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS AND I THINK YOU COULD PREPARE THIS PRESIDENT FOR THIS. TRUMP HAS DONE A LOT OF DEPOSITIONS HIMSELF BURIED HE HAS AN EXPERIENCE ON SIDE. Tucker: VERY PRECISE PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO JAIL HAVING FALLEN INTO PERJURY TRAPS BY EXPERTS. THAT'S TRUE. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
