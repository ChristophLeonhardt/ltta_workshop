“I am here because I
believe it is my civic duty. ...”
“This confirmation process has
become a national disgrace.”
“Early in the evening,
I went up a very
narrow set of stairs
leading from the living room
to a second floor
to use the restroom.
When I got to the
top of the stairs,
I was pushed from behind
into a bedroom
across from the bathroom.
I couldn’t see who pushed me.
Brett and Mark came
into the bedroom
and locked the door
behind them.
There was music
playing in the bedroom.
It was turned up louder
by either Brett or Mark
once we were in the room.
I was pushed onto the bed
and Brett got on top of me.
He began running his
hands over my body
and grinding into me.
I believed he was
going to rape me.
I tried to yell for help.
When I did, Brett put his
hand over my mouth
to stop me from yelling.
This is what
terrified me the most
and has had the most
lasting impact on my life.
It was hard for me to breathe,
and I thought that
Brett was accidentally
going to kill me.”
“Dr. Ford, with what degree
of certainty do you believe
Brett Kavanaugh
assaulted you?”
“One hundred percent.”
“What is the strongest
memory you have?”
“Indelible in the hippocampus
is the laughter —
the uproarious laughter
between the two,
and they’re having
fun at my expense.”
“You’ve never forgotten
that laughter,
never forgotten them
laughing at you?”
“I was underneath one of them
while the two laughed —
two friends having a really
good time with one another.”
“Are you aware that
the three people
at the party besides yourself
and Brett Kavanaugh
have given statements
under penalty of felony
to the committee?”
“Yes.”
“And are you aware of
what those statements say?”
“Yes.”
“Are you aware that they say
that they have no memory
or knowledge of such a party?”
“I don’t expect that
P.J. and Leland
would remember
this evening.
It was a very
unremarkable party.
It was not one of their
more notorious parties.
Because nothing remarkable
happened to them that evening —
they were downstairs.
And Mr. Judge is
a different story —
I would expect that he would
remember that this happened.”
“I categorically and
unequivocally deny
the allegation against
me by Dr. Ford.
This whole two-week effort
has been a calculated and
orchestrated political hit,
fueled with apparent
pent-up anger
about President Trump
and the 2016 election,
fear that has been
unfairly stoked
about my judicial record,
revenge on behalf
of the Clintons
and millions of dollars
in money
from outside, left-wing
opposition groups.
The other night, Ashley
and my daughter Liza
said their prayers.
And little Liza,
all of 10 years old,
said to Ashley, we should
pray for the woman.”
“Was there ever a time
when you drink so much
that you couldn’t remember
what happened
or part of what happened
the night before?”
“I – no. I remember
what happened.
And, I think you’ve probably
had beers, Senator, and so —”
“So you’re saying there’s
never been a case
where you drank so much
that you didn’t remember
what happened the night before,
or part of what happened?”
“That’s — you’re asking
about yeah, blackout.
I don’t know, have you?”
“Could you answer
the question, Judge?
And just — so you —
that’s not happened?
Is that your answer?”
“Yeah, and I’m curious if you have.”
“I have no drinking
problem, Judge.”
“Yeah, nor do I.”
“O.K., thank you.”
“In your yearbook,
you talked about drinking
and sexual exploits,
did you not?”
“Senator, let me take a step
back and explain high school.
I was No. 1 in the class,
freshman —”
“And I thought —”
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.”
“I thought only the Senate
could filibuster.”
“I’m going to talk
about my high school —”
“I thought only the
Senate could filibuster.”
“No, no, I’m going to talk —”
“Let him answer.”
“I’m going to talk about
my high school record
if you’re going to sit here
and mock me.”
“You said, ‘I welcome any
kind of investigation.’
I quote you.
‘I welcome any kind
of investigation.’”
“I welcome whatever the
committee wants to do,
because I’m telling the truth.”
“I want to know
what you want to do.”
“I’m telling the truth.”
“I want to know what
you want to do, Judge.”
“I’m innocent.
I’m innocent of this charge.”
“Then you’re prepared
for an F.B.I. investigation?”
“They don‘t reach conclusions.
You reach the conclusions, Senator.“
“No, but they do
investigate questions.”
“If you wanted
an F.B.I. investigation,
you could’ve come to us.
What you want to do is
destroy this guy’s life,
hold this seat open
and hope you win in 2020.
You said that, not me.
You’ve got nothing
to apologize for.
When you see
Sotomayor and Kagan,
tell him that
Lindsey said hello.
Because I voted for them.
I would never do to them
what you’ve done to this guy.
This is the most
unethical sham
since I’ve been in politics.
And if you really wanted
to know the truth,
you sure as hell
wouldn’t have done
what you’ve done to this guy.
Are you a gang rapist?”
“No.”
“I cannot imagine what you and
your family have gone through.”
