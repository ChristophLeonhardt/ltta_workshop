HE OR SHE, I COULDN'T TELL FROM 

188
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:00,439
THE BACK. 

189
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,708
BUT LET'S SAY IT WAS SHE WAS 

190
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,778
VERY EASY TO GET OUT, RIGHT? 

191
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,414
<font color="#00FF00">UT THIS WEEK AMERICA ALSO SAW </font>

192
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:09,781
SOMETHING ELSE. 

193
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,986
ON THURSDAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

194
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,155
SAW THE BRILLIANT AND REALLY 

195
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,623
INCREDIBLE CHARACTER, QUALITY 

196
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,326
AND COURAGE OF OUR NOMINEE FOR 

197
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:31,370
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT 

198
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:34,941
A VOTE TO CONFIRM BE JUDGE 

199
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,944
KAVANAUGH IS A VOTE TO CONFIRM 

200
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:41,881
ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED 

201
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,115
LEGAL MINDS OF THEIR TIMES. 

202
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,217
A RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE. 

203
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,052
YOU KNOW, FOR TEN YEARS HE'S A 

204
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:47,352
YOUNG GUY. 

205
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,955
BUT FOR TEN YEARS THEY HAVE 

206
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,957
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIM. 

207
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:52,357
LONGER THAN THAT. 

208
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:53,759
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM, BUT I 

209
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,327
HEARD ABOUT HIM A LOT, ALL 

210
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,396
SAYING HE SHOULD BE ON THE 

211
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,096
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 

212
00:09:58,096 --> 00:10:00,199
THAT'S WHY I PUT HIM UP.  

213
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,401
AND I WILL TELL YOU, I WILL 

214
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:08,774
TELL YOU, I WILL TELL YOU HE 

215
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,476
HAS SUFFERED THE MEANNESS, THE 

216
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,913
ANGER.  

217
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,882
AND NOW WEST VIRGINIA, THEY DID 

218
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,417
A POLE, JUST CAME OUT. 

219
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,553
OVERALL TOTAL SUPPORT FOR JUDGE 

220
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:25,324
KAVANAUGH, 58%.    

221
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:32,498
TOTAL OPPOSED, 28%.    

222
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,933
AND SO IT'S 58%, 28% OPPOSED. 

223
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,602
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT? 

224
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,005
I THINK THAT'S GOOD. 

225
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:40,505
THAT'S WEST VIRGINIA. 

226
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,208
REPUBLICAN 81% VERSES 8%, BUT 

227
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:50,182
THAT IS WHAT WE EXPECTED.    

228
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,549
WOW. 

229
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,751
WOMEN, 52% TO 35%.  

230
00:10:51,751 --> 00:11:00,259
THAT'S NOT BAD.    

231
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,364
MEN, WEST VIRGINIA 65% TO 21%. 

232
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:05,898
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? 

233
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,033
HEY, IT'S A POLL, BUT WE LOVE 

234
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,034
THOSE POLLS, DON'T WE? 

235
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:09,802
I LOVE POLLS. 

236
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,870
ONLY WHEN THEY ARE GOOD, WHEN 

237
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,538
THEY ARE NOT GOOD, I WON'T TALK 

238
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:12,804
ABOUT IT. 

239
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,173
BUT THEY WILL DO A LOT. 

240
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,042
YOU SEE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA? 

241
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:21,947
THEY WILL DO A LOT. 

242
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,684
THEY DO A LOT OF PHONY POLLS. 

243
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,622
A LOT OF PHONY POLLS.  

244
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,291
AND THEY DO A LOT OF POLLS, 

245
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,093
SUPPRESSION POLLS. 

246
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,227
THEY WILL MAKE THEM BAD BECAUSE 

247
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,597
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF GOOD WORK, 

248
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,901
BUT THEY MAKE THEM BAD SO YOU 

249
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,369
GO TO A MOVIE INSTEAD OF 

250
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:43,636
VOTING. 

251
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,104
LET'S GO TO A MOVIE AND THEN 

252
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,840
WE'LL COME HOME AND WATCH THE 

253
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,141
RETURNS. 

254
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,110
BUT -- BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. 

255
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,679
IN 2016 NOBODY WENT TO A MOVIE, 

256
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,784
NOBODY.    

257
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,987
I THINK THE MOVIE THEATERS WERE 

258
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,989
VERY EMPTY THAT NIGHT, DON'T 

259
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,289
YOU THINK? 

260
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:07,259
SO SOME GREAT THINGS ARE 

261
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:07,559
HAPPENING. 

262
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,029
BUT A VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

263
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,099
IS A VOTE TO REJECT THE 

264
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,168
RUTHLESS AND OUTRAGEOUS TACTICS 

265
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:16,701
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

266
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,169
MEAN OBSTRUCTIONISTS, 

267
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:17,903
RESISTERS. 

268
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,638
FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS, 

269
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,740
DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT EVERY 

270
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,743
MINUTE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE 

271
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,143
RESULTS OF THE LAST ELECTION. 

272
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,179
WE HAD ONE OF THE GREAT. 

273
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,848
WE HAD ONE OF THE GREATS. 

274
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,784
EVERY DAY IT'S LIKE A JOB, LIKE 

275
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,151
A PART OF YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION. 

276
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,154
GET UP AND FIGHT THEM.    

277
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:48,501
GET UP AND FIGHT THEM.    

278
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,871
THEY TRY TO SHUT DOWN OUR 

279
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,738
GOVERNMENT. 

280
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,638
THEY'RE HOLDING UP 360 MEN AND 

281
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:57,910
WOMEN WHO WANT TO WORK FOR THE 

282
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,677
GOVERNMENT THEY ARE NOT 

283
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,144
APPROVING. 

284
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,714
AND HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND NOT 

285
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,383
EVEN CALLED NOMINEES. 

286
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,751
THEY ARE NOT EVEN 

287
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,118
CONTROVERSIAL. 

288
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,053
YOU KNOW THE WORD SLOW WALKING? 

289
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,155
THEY ARE SLOW WALKING.    

290
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,558
AND THEY LEFT THEIR JOBS.    

291
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,626
SCHUMER AND ALL THE GROUPS THAT 

292
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:18,697
YOU READ ABOUT.    

293
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,832
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING THESE 

294
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,800
PEOPLE TO COME INTO GOVERNMENT 

295
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,135
AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT 

296
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,271
A PEOPLE WITH A CERTAIN VIEW. 

297
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:31,676
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE 

298
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,013
THAT ARE INCLUDING JUDGES WHERE 

299
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,581
THEY GO MAXIMUM 30 DAYS, 30 

300
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,017
DAYS. 

301
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,652
IF SOMEBODY WILL BE APPROVED, 

302
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,052
THEY TAKE THEM. 

303
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,021
WE'RE UP TO 365 PEOPLE AND IT 

304
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,722
HAS BEEN THAT WAY, THE LONGEST 

305
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,457
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 

306
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,058
BY FAR. 

307
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,794
THE MOST PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY, 

308
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,162
THE LONGEST AND THE MOST IN 

309
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,496
HISTORY. 

310
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,531
HONESTLY THE DEMOCRATS ARE A 

311
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:52,964
DISPLACE, THEY ARE. 

312
00:13:52,964 --> 00:14:00,472
THEY ARE A DISGRACE.    

313
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,941
AND THE NUMBER ONE ENABLER OF 

314
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,208
THE DEMOCRATS IS THE FAKE NEWS 

315
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,911
MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE.    

316
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:23,162
I'LL TELL YOU.     

317
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,669
AND THEY REALLY DO, THEY SHOW 

318
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:36,875
YOU THE CHAOS AND THE 

319
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,910
RESENTMENT. 

320
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:45,184
THEY REPORT INCORRECT NEWS, 

321
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:45,484
PHONY NEWS. 

322
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,286
WHEN I SAY ABOUT MEDIA, I'M 

323
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,955
TALKING ABOUT THE FAKE NEWS 

324
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,188
MEDIA. 

325
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,024
THEY ARE TRULY AN ENEMY OF THE 

326
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:52,257
PEOPLE. 

327
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,925
FAKE NEWS, ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 

328
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:54,359
THEY REALLY ARE. 

329
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:59,098
THEY ARE SO BAD.    

330
00:14:59,098 --> 00:14:59,898
YOU DON'T EVEN GET IT. 

331
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:03,101
YOU THINK THEY WOULD LIKE A 

332
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:03,569
STRONG MILITARY. 

333
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,537
NO CRIME, STRONG BORDERS.    

334
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:05,837
THEY DON'T. 

335
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:07,906
THEY DON'T.    

336
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:12,444
THIS NOVEMBER 6, YOU'LL HAVE A 

337
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,481
CHANCE TO REJECT THESE 

338
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,081
DISGRACEFUL POLITICAL HACKS. 

339
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,519
BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT, YOU 

340
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,421
NEED TO VOTE REPUBLICANS. 

341
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,658
I MEAN WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE.    

342
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,094
I WANT TO GET ALONG WITH THEM, 

343
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,864
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IN MANY 

344
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,999
WAYS, JUST REALLY TOUGH. 

345
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:34,800
IT REALLY IS. 

346
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,003
THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING SO MUCH 

347
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,472
THAT POCAHONTAS IS CONSIDERED A 

348
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,140
CONSERVATIVE IN THE DEMOCRAT 

349
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,708
PARTY, LIKE A CONSERVATIVE 

350
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,444
PERSON.    

351
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,880
POCAHONTAS, ELIZABETH WARREN IS 

352
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,714
CONSIDERED LIKE A CONSERVATIVE 

353
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,015
PERSON. 

354
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,649
THESE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE GOTTEN 

355
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,553
CRAZY, LOCO.    

356
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,822
WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY MANY 

357
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,257
TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS.  

358
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,558
INCLUDING A FRIEND OF MINE AND 

359
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,293
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HE'S THE 

360
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,996
BIGGEST HUMAN BEING THAT I HAVE 

361
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,532
EVER SEEN.  

362
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,500
DO WE LIKE HIM? 

363
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:20,145
HE'S OUR GREAT GOVERNOR.    

364
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,579
THE HIGHEST. 

365
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,182
NOW LISTEN, THIS IS WEST 

366
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:23,449
VIRGINIA. 

367
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,750

00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,542
ALREADY AND FIXED A LOT OF 

733
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,912
WALL, BUT WE'RE GETTING IT.  

734
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,014
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING 

735
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,148
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT'S 

736
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:12,815
THE THING WE REALLY WANT. 

737
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,217
IT'S VERY MUCH OF A SIGNATURE, 

738
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,820
A VERY BIG PART OF WHAT WE 

739
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,321
TALKED ABOUT. 

740
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,556
THEY GET IN THE WAY. 

741
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,292
I KNOW IT FOR A FACT. 

742
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,460
THEY SAID WE CAN'T -- WE'LL GET 

743
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,797
THINGS IS THAT ARE ACTUALLY 

744
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:29,033
MILITARY, $700 BILLION AND $716 

745
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:29,299
BILLION. 

746
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:32,003
WE GET THAT, A WALL IS A TINY 

747
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:32,637
THING BY COMPARISON, BUT THEY 

748
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:36,007
WANT TO FIGHT THAT WALL FOR 

749
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,440
POLITICAL PURPOSES. 

750
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,875
BUT WE'RE BUILDING IT AND I 

751
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,911
LOVE THE SIGNS, FINISH IT. 

752
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:45,815
WE'LL GET IT FINISHED.  

753
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,886
THEY WANT TO KILL AND THIS WILL 

754
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,120
HAPPEN AS SURE AS YOU'RE 

755
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,587
STANDING OR SITTING. 

756
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,222
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS A BETTER 

757
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,591
SEAT. 

758
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:59,730
YOU OR YOU?    

759
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,398
THIS IS A GUARANTEE. 

760
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,268
YOUR COAL MINES AND YOUR MINERS 

761
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:04,601
ARE WORKING. 

762
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,003
THEY WILL KILL WEST VIRGINIA 

763
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:06,203
COAL. 

764
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:08,372
THAT'S A GUARANTEE.    

765
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,909
AND THEY WANT TO TURN OFF 

766
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,011
FEDERAL COURTS INTO THE 

767
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,146
POLITICAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT 

768
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:16,447
RESISTANCE. 

769
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,448
YOU SEE IT. 

770
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,351
YOU SEE IT.    

771
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,020
NOW JOE MANCHIN VOTED NO ON TAX 

772
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,321
CUTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. 

773
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:24,788
HE JUST VOTED NO. 

774
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:28,059
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? 

775
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,296
HE VOTED NO ON REMOVING OBAMA'S 

776
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:32,829
JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. 

777
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,066
BIT WAY WE'VE CUT MORE 

778
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:35,399
REGULATIONS. 

779
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:39,070
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE ALL THESE 

780
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,171
JOBS, RECORD SETTING JOBS. 

781
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:40,937
MORE REGULATIONS THAN ANY 

782
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,774
PRESIDENT EVER IN THE HISTORY 

783
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,609
OF OUR COUNTRY. 

784
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,447
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.    

785
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:49,914
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 

786
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,715
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR 

787
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,819
TWO YEARS, BUT TIME IS FLYING, 

788
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,086
ISN'T IT? 

789
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,120
TIME IS FLYING. 

790
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,955
WE'VE CUT MORE THAN ANY 

791
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:58,589
ADMINISTRATION, WHETHER IT WAS 

792
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,692
FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS, OR IN 

793
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,029
ONE CASE MUCH MORE THAN THAT. 

794
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:05,396
WE'VE CUT MORE. 

795
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,098
JOE ALSO VOTED TO ON REPEALING 

796
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:11,669
AND REPLACING OBAMACARE, WHICH 

797
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,405
WE ALMOST HAD DONE, BUT I'LL BE 

798
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:14,672
NICE NOW. 

799
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:20,544
IF WE DID, WE WOULD HAVE KILLED 

800
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:22,013
IT, BUT WE'RE GIVING YOU A LOT 

801
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,349
OF GREAT HEALTH CARE ANYWAY. 

802
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,317
IF YOU LOOKING AT THE PLANS, 

803
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,253
AND IT WILL BE THE WORSE PART 

804
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:53,377
OF OBAMA.    

805
00:36:53,377 --> 00:37:08,759
THE BORDER DAMS, PELOSI 

806
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,362
>>> THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL 

807
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,730
STOP AT NOTHING BUT RUN YOUR 

808
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,067
LIVES, RUN DOWN YOUR VALUES, 

809
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,035
AND RANSACK OUR NATION'S 

810
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:18,268
WEALTH. 

811
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:19,804
WE HAVE NEVER DONE LIKE THIS. 

812
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,439
THEY WILL TURN IT AROUND, MAKE 

813
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,540
IT BAD SO FAST. 

814
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,443
GETTING MONEY FOR THE MILITARY. 

815
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:25,910
WE'RE SO TOUGH. 

816
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,978
AND TO DO THAT, WE HAD TO GIVE 

817
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:30,781
THEM MONEY FOR THINGS THEY 

818
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:31,349
DON'T WANT. 

819
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,450
WE WOULD NEVER WANT. 

820
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,685
NOW WE HAVE OUR MILITARY 

821
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,018
REBUILDING. 

822
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,555
WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF OUR 

823
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:37,955
MILITARY. 

824
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:41,959
WE ORDERED MASSIVE NUMBERS OF 

825
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,162
FIGHTER JETS AND PLANES. 

826
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:46,563
SHIPS, ROCKETS, AND MISSILES. 

827
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:48,065
WE MAKE THE GREATEST MILITARY 

828
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,034
EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. 

829
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,635
WE HAVE ORDERED SO MUCH THAT 

830
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,704
OTHER COUNTRIES LOOK AT US AND 

831
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,906
THEY SAY, LET'S FORGET ABOUT 

832
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:56,207
THEM. 

833
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,475
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. 

834
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,043
WE DON'T WANT WARS. 

835
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,745
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU DON'T HAVE 

836
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,446
WARS IS IF YOU HAVE A MILITARY 

837
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,914
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

838
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,250
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF 

839
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,952
BUILDING THE STRONGEST MILITARY 

840
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:15,960
WE'VE EVER HAD BY FAR. 

841
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,796
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 

842
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,196
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

843
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,564
YOU NOTICE I SAY DEMOCRATIC 

844
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:20,797
PARTY. 

845
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:27,304
I HATE THE WAY IT SAYS. 

846
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,939
IT FLOWS NICER. 

847
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:29,573
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

848
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,343
BUT YOU KNOW, THE REAL NAME IS 

849
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:32,810
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. 

850
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,311
I HATE THE WAY IT SOUNDS AND 

851
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:36,614
THAT'S WHY I USE IT. 

852
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,982
IT'S THE REAL NAME. 

853
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,618
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, SO WHEN YOU 

854
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,319
SEE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IT'S 

855
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:42,853
WRONG. 

856
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,688
THERE'S NO NAME DEMOCRATIC 

857
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:44,921
PARTY. 

858
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,190
THAT'S A GREAT NAME. 

859
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,191
THEY SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE THE 

860
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,693
NAME, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. 

861
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:52,429
CALL THEM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

862
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,866
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RADICAL 

863
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,804
SOCIALISM, VENEZUELA, AND OPEN 

864
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:00,071
BORDERS. 

865
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,540
IT'S NOW CALLED, TO ME, YOU'VE 

866
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,675
NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE. 

867
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,609
THE PARTY OF CRIME. 

868
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,646
IT'S A PARTY OF CRIME. 

869
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:13,784
IT'S WHAT IT IS. 

870
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,419
AND TO PAY FOR THEIR SOCIALISM, 

871
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,989
WHICH IS GOING TO DESTROY OUR 

872
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,859
COUNTRY, DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAID 

873
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,727
MEDICARE AND DESTROY SOCIAL 

874
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:24,061
SECURITY. 

875
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,930
THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 

876
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,699
DEMOCRATS WANT TO COMPLETELY 

877
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,034
DESTROY MEDICARE WITH SO-CALLED 

878
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,934
MEDICARE FOR ALL. 

879
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,236
YEAH, FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS 

880
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:35,039
BEFORE THE COUNTRY GOES OUT OF 

881
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,306
BUSINESS. 

882
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,441
ROBBING OUR SENIORS OF THE 

883
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,410
BENEFITS THEY PAID INTO FOR 

884
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,144
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. 

885
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,613
GIVING IT TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T 

886
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:42,913
DESERVE IT. 

887
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,449
GIVING IT, BY THE WAY, TO 

888
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:52,556
ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO COME INTO 

889
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,891
OUR COUNTRY. 

890
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,660
OKAY. REPUBLICANS WANT TO 

891
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,396
PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT 

892
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,398
SENIORS WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND 

893
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:00,964
PAID FOR IT. 

894
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:07,471
AND I WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR AND 

895
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,273
ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH 

896
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:09,773
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. 

897
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:10,875
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 

898
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:17,548
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 

899
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,049
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S NOT A 

900
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,317
REPUBLICAN THING TO DO. 

901
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:20,851
I DON'T CARE. 

902
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,419
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ALL OF 

903
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,054
THE REPUBLICANS ARE COMING INTO 

904
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,589
THAT POSITION NOW. 

905
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,989
ALL OF THEM. 

906
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:31,495
AND WE'LL DO IT THE RIGHT WAY, 

907
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:31,996
TOO. 

908
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:35,099
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS ARE 

909
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:35,299
SAFE. 

910
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:35,499
OKAY. 

911
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:35,933
JUST REMEMBER THAT. 

912
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,701
PREEXISTING, TELL THAT TO THE 

913
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:46,510
FAKE NEWS MEDIA WHEN THEY 

914
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:46,743
WRITE. 

915
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:47,043
THE FAKERS. 

916
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:48,812
BUT WE ALL HAVE A GOOD TIME. 

917
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:50,614
THEY WILL ALL ENDORSE ME FOR 

918
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,715
THE NEXT ELECTION. 

919
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,918
HAVE YOU HEARD? 

920
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,920
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T, AND SOME 

921
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,622
REASON I DIDN'T WIN, EVERY 

922
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,224
SINGLE MEDIA OUTLET GOES 

923
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:00,691
BANKRUPT. 

924
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,157
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 

925
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:03,727
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY HAD TO 

926
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,730
COVER CRAZY BERNIE? 

927
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,332
WHO WILL WATCH? 

928
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,100
OR ANY OF THEM. 

929
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,002
HOW ABOUT CORY BOOKER. 

930
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:18,475
DID YOU WATCH THE PERFORMANCE? 

931
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:19,410
HE RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, INTO 

932
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,948
THE GROUND AND NOW HE WANTS TO 

933
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:24,548
BE PRESIDENT, RIGHT? 

934
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:31,322
WHAT WAS THE MOMENT HE SAID HE 

935
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,490
HAD? 

936
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,492
I DON'T THINK SO. 

937
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,162
I THINK WE TAKE KIRK DOUGLAS IN 

938
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:38,462
HIS PRIME. 

939
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,965
I THINK WE DID. 

940
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,666
NO, HE RAN NEWARK INTO THE 

941
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:42,899
GROUND. 

942
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:44,468
NOW HE'S ACTING HE'S SO 

943
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,970
WONDERFUL, GREAT, I DREAM OF 

944
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,073
THESE PEOPLE EVERY NIGHT. 

945
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,543
THE ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT IS 

946
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,979
THAT SOME TOTAL UNKNOWN THAT NO 

947
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,615
ONE HEARD OF COMES ALONG. 

948
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,416
HONESTLY, WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE 

949
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,752
ON JOBS, ON OUR COUNTRY, ON OUR 

950
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,387
MILITARY, WE'RE GOING TO TALK 

951
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,056
ABOUT OUR VETERANS AND WHAT 

952
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:06,590
WE'VE DONE. 

953
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,958
IN YOUR CASE, ENERGY. 

954
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,160
ENERGY, LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE ON 

955
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,393
ENERGY. 

956
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,763
WHO THE CAN BEAT US? 

957
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,031
WHO CAN BEAT US? 

958
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:18,869
WHO CAN BEAT US? 

959
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,271
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE SAID 

960
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:23,841
RECENTLY AND THEY HATED TO SAY 

961
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:24,975
IT. 

962
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,744
TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY FULFILLED 

963
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,381
MORE PROMISES THAN HE PROMISED. 

964
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,283
IT'S TRUE. 

965
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:37,921
LOOK WHAT WE'RE DOING. 

966
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:38,188
4.2% GDP. 

967
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:41,025
EVERY POINT IS $3.5 TRILLION 

968
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:41,792
AND 10 MILLION JOBS. 

969
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,961
WHEN I TOOK IT OVER, OUR 

970
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,496
COUNTRY WAS HEADED SOUTH. 

971
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,998
WE WERE GOING DOWN. 

972
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:52,002
WE WERE GOING DOWN. 

973
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,405
INSTEAD OF 4.2, YOU WOULD BE 

974
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:54,738
NEGATIVE 4.2. 

975
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,641
THAT'S THE WAY WE WERE HEADED. 

976
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,710
PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE 

977
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,280
DANGEROUS THAN THE DEMOCRATS 

978
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,982
PUSH TO ABOLISH VERY BRAVE 

979
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,383
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR US AND 

980
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:11,221
THAT LOVE US AND TAKE CARE OF 

981
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,356
US CALLED ICE. 

982
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:17,227
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH 

983
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:17,961
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT 

984
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:18,228
ENTIRELY. 

985
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,997
AND THEY WANT NO BORDERS. 

986
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:26,637
LET EVERYBODY JUST POUR INTO 

987
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:26,970
OUR COUNTRY. 

988
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,772
YOU HAVE SOME BAD DUDES COMING 

989
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,975
IN, BUT THEY ARE NOT COMING IN 

990
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:31,308
WITH US. 

991
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,244
WE SET RECORDS AT ARRESTS AT 

992
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,245
THE BORDERS. 

993
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,213
NOBODY EVEN CLOSE. 

994
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,449
AND THAT'S WITHOUT THE WALL IN 

995
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,550
THOSE SECTIONS WHERE WE HAVEN'T 

996
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,952
BEEN ABLE TO GET THE MONEY 

997
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,253
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WON'T 

998
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:43,587
APPROVE. 

999
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,924
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, WE HAVE 

1000
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:47,625
VERY SMALL MARGINS. 

1001
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,126
THEY SAY WE ARE THE MAJORITY? 

1002
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,563
IF SMALL HAS A COLD, WE CAN'T 

1003
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,130
TAKE A VOTE. 

1004
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,232
IF SOMEBODY IS NOT FEELING 

1005
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,567
WELL, WE SAY LET'S DELAY THE 

1006
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,035
VOTE FOR THREE DAYS. 

1007
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,036
WE DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY. 

1008
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:01,205
IT'S SO CLOSE. 

1009
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:01,671
IT'S SO CLOSE. 

1010
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:04,842
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO GET MORE 

1011
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:05,275
REPUBLICANS IN. 

1012
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,744
WE WILL DO SOMETHING THAT 

1013
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:14,417
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. 

1014
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:17,955
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY SUPPORTS 

1015
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,257
TOTALLY, THEY LOVE THEM, 

1016
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,225
SANCTUARY CITIES, WHERE CRIME 

1017
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,095
POURS IN AND THEY ARE 

1018
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:25,395
PROTECTED. 

1019
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:27,264
THAT UNLEASH VIOLENT PREDATORS 

1020
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,933
LIKE MS13 INTO AMERICAN 

1021
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:30,266
COMMUNITIES. 

1022
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:32,336
LEAVING INNOCENT AMERICANS AT 

1023
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,738
THE MERCY OF REALLY, BY THE 

1024
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,841
WAY, REALLY RUTHLESS ANIMALS. 

1025
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:40,543
REALLY RUTHLESS ANIMALS. 

1026
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:41,879
NANCY PELOSI SAID, HOW DARE HE 

1027
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,983
CALL A HUMAN BEING AN ANIMAL? 

1028
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:46,583
I'M SORRY, NANCY. 

1029
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,852
THEY DON'T LIKE GUNS, THEY LIKE 

1030
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,320
TO USE KNIVES BECAUSE IT'S MORE 

1031
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,389
PAINFUL AND IT TAKES A LONG 

1032
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:52,589
TIME. 

1033
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:53,991
THESE ARE REAL BAD PEOPLE. 

1034
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,392
WE'RE BRINGING THEM OUT SO 

1035
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:55,592
FAST. 

1036
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,394
YOU KNOW WHO IS LEADING THE 

1037
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:57,928
CHARGE? 

1038
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:58,695
WHO LOVES DOING IT? 

1039
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,129
ICE. 

1040
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,931
WHO THE WANTS THAT JOB? 

1041
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:06,970
ICE IS DOING THE JOB. 

1042
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,639
RIGHT? 

1043
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,777
RIGHT. ICE IS DOING THAT JOB. 

1044
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,212
THESE ARE BRAVE PEOPLE. 

1045
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,680
THEY GO INTO TOWNS IN LONG 

1046
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,081
ISLAND WHERE I GREW UP. 

1047
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:19,616
RIGHT NEXT TO THESE PLACES. 

1048
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,184
I KNOW THEM ALL. 

1049
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:24,721
IT USED TO BE, YOU LEAVE YOUR 

1050
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,989
WINDOW OPEN, YOU LEAVE YOUR 

1051
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:26,490
DOOR OPEN. 

1052
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,259
YOU GO TO SLEEP. 

1053
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:29,593
NOT ANYMORE. 

1054
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,028
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY GO IN 

1055
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,695
LIKE THEY ARE LIBERATING A 

1056
00:45:32,695 --> 00:45:32,962
COUNTRY. 

1057
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:35,098
IT'S LIKE THIS IS THE UNITED 

1058
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:35,933
STATES. 

1059
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,569
AND ICE GOES IN AND MS13, THEY 

1060
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,803
ARE AFRAID OF ICE. 

1061
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,572
ICE IS MUCH TOUGHER THAN THEY 

1062
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:41,905
ARE. 

1063
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,375
THAT'S ALL THEY FEAR. 

1064
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,277
AND THEY GO IN AND THEY GRAB 

1065
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,547
THEM BY THEIR NECKS AND THROW 

1066
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,983
THEM INTO A PADDY WAGON AND 

1067
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,785
TAKE THEM TO JAIL OR THROW THEM 

1068
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,119
OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 

1069
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:57,020
IT'S VERY SIMPLE. 

1070
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,925
AND THEY CLEAN OUT TOWNS. 

1071
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,728
THEY CLEAN OUT TOWNS OF TRULY 

1072
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:05,028
BAD PEOPLE. 

1073
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:05,529
DANGEROUS PEOPLE. 

1074
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,630
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. 

1075
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,432
I GOT TO KNOW MOTHERS THAT HAVE 

1076
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:12,502
DAUGHTERS, FATHERS THAT HAVE 

1077
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:12,802
DAUGHTERS. 

1078
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:14,571
IN MANY CASES DAUGHTERS AND IN 

1079
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,439
MANY CASES SONS. 

1080
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,975
BUT WHAT THEY DO TO THESE 

1081
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,176
INCREDIBLE KIDS WALKING HOME 

1082
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:19,509
FROM SCHOOL. 

1083
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:22,880
GOING HOME WITH BOOKS TO STUDY, 

1084
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,148
DO HOMEWORK AND THEY INTERCEPT 

1085
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,483
THEM AND THEY ARE HORRIBLE. 

1086
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:26,850
IT'S HORRIBLE. 

1087
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:32,356
WE ARE GET TING THEM OUT. 

1088
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,391
THE DEMOCRATS, IT'S LIKE THEY 

1089
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,960
DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT 

1090
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,594
THERE'S A PROBLEM. 

1091
00:46:38,594 --> 00:46:39,329
IT'S INCREDIBLE. 

1092
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,664
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA 

1093
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,333
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-

1094
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:52,376
ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL 

1095
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:52,910
ALIENS. 

1096
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:53,677
SO, REPUBLICANS, NOT DEMOCRATS, 

1097
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:54,911
THEY WANT TO END ICE. 

1098
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:58,181
THEY WANT TO END A LOT OF 

1099
00:46:58,181 --> 00:46:58,414
THINGS. 

1100
00:46:58,414 --> 00:46:59,016
OPEN BORDERS. 

1101
00:46:59,016 --> 00:46:59,816
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 

1102
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,252
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THIS 

1103
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:02,586
PLATFORM? 

1104
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,923
WE WANT OPEN BORDERS, HIGH 

1105
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,424
TAXES, WE WANT CRIME. 

1106
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,394
BECAUSE BASICALLY, THEY ARE 

1107
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:10,828
SAYING CRIME. 

1108
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,130
SO THEY HAVE CRIME, HIGH TAXES, 

1109
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,431
OPEN BORDERS, AND BY THE WAY, 

1110
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,400
WE DON'T WANT TO FUND THE 

1111
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:16,667
MILITARY. 

1112
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,035
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS 

1113
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,137
TO GET MONEY FOR THE MILITARY. 

1114
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:21,738
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. 

1115
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,007
THAT WAS LIKE A FULL TIME JOB. 

1116
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,209
BUT WE GOT THAT MONEY. 

1117
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:32,015
WE GOT A LOT OF MONEY. 

1118
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,917
IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT 51 VOTES 

1119
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:37,220
IN THE SENATE, THEY WOULD OPEN 

1120
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,921
OUR NATION'S BORDERS. 

1121
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,624
THEY WOULD STARVE OUR LAW 

1122
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:40,957
ENFORCEMENT. 

1123
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:42,793
THEY WOULD STARVE -- DO WE LOVE 

1124
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:48,031
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT? 

1125
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:48,498
SERIOUSLY. 

1126
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,201
I GOT A TREMENDOUS PERCENTAGE 

1127
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,337
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT VOTE, BUT I 

1128
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:58,575
THINK I MIGHT HAVE -- DID I GET 

1129
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:58,775
100%? 

1130
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,044
WHO WOULDN'T VOTE FOR ME FROM 

1131
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,444
LAW ENFORCEMENT? 

1132
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:02,412
WE'VE DONE A LOT. 

1133
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,348
WE HAVE GOTTEN THEM A LOT OF 

1134
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,216
MATERIAL FROM THE MILITARY. 

1135
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,552
WE HAD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 

1136
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,921
DOLLARS OF SURPLUS MATERIAL. 

1137
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,389
AND OUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 

1138
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,724
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DID THEY 

1139
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,526
WANT TO GIVE THIS TO LAW 

1140
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:16,859
ENFORCEMENT. 

1141
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,328
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT 

1142
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:18,628
EQUIPMENT. 

1143
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:20,797
IT KEEPS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1144
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,900
SAFE, LIKE TRUCKS THAT ARE 

1145
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,201
ARMORED AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 

1146
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,969
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT. 

1147
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,406
THEY THOUGHT IT PRESENTED A 

1148
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:29,973
WRONG IMAGE. 

1149
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:30,707
I GAVE IT. 

1150
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,374
IT'S ALL OUT. 

1151
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:34,177
THEY ARE ALL HAPPY. 

1152
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,446
WE HAD IT. 

1153
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:36,947
IT'S MILITARY. 

1154
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,616
WE HAD IT SITTING IN STORAGE 

1155
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,951
ROOMS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 

1156
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:41,952
GETTING OLD AND PROBABLY 

1157
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,353
COSTING US A LOT OF MONEY. 

1158
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,922
WE GAVE IT OUT TO LAW 

1159
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:46,255
ENFORCEMENT. 

1160
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:47,724
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES LIKE 

1161
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:47,890
US. 

1162
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,727
IF YOU WANT TO SECURE OUR 

1163
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:50,960
BORDER. 

1164
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,031
IF YOU WANT TO STOP SANCTUARY 

1165
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,365
CITIES, WHICH EVEN IN 

1166
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,333
CALIFORNIA NOW, THEY DON'T WANT 

1167
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,668
TO BE SANCTUARY CITIES ANYMORE. 

1168
00:48:58,668 --> 00:48:59,302
THEY WANT OUT. 

1169
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:00,403
YOU SEE IT. 

1170
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:01,304
THEY ARE REBELLING IN 

1171
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:05,842
CALIFORNIA OF ALL PLACES. 

1172
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,910
THEY ARE REBELLING. 

1173
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,445
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT AMERICAN 

1174
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,647
COMMUNITIES FROM REALLY BAD, 

1175
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:15,319
BAD CRIME, THEN YOU NEED TO 

1176
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:15,719
VOTE REPUBLICAN. 

1177
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:24,861
PATRICK MORRISEY, HAVE TO VOTE 

1178
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:25,762
REPUBLICAN. 

1179
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:29,766
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SECURITY 

1180
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:30,767
AND IT'S ABOUT PROSPERITY. 

1181
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,103
HERE ARE SOME OF OUR 

1182
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:33,703
EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENTS. 

1183
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:35,238
WE HAVE DONE THINGS THAT NOBODY 

1184
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:35,571
CAN BELIEVE. 

1185
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:37,174
IF I WOULD HAVE USED THESE 

1186
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,875
NUMBERS DURING THE CAMPAIGN, 

1187
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,912
THE FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID 

1188
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,414
OH, IT'S SO RIDICULOUS. 

1189
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,348
IT'S SO RIDICULOUS. 

1190
00:49:45,348 --> 00:49:46,717
HOW CAN HE SAY THAT? 

1191
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:50,420
I USE MUCH LOWER NUMBERS THAN 

1192
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:50,720
THEY SAID. 

1193
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,489
ECONOMIC GROWTH LAST QUARTER 

1194
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:58,962
WAS 4.1 AND IT WAS JUST 

1195
00:49:58,962 --> 00:49:59,963
ADJUSTED UPWARD, 4.2%. 

1196
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,065
IT'S GOING A LOT HIGHER, FOLKS. 

1197
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:07,337
IT'S GOING A LOT HIGHER. 

1198
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,906
JOBLESS CLAIMS, THAT'S A 

1199
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:10,139
BEAUTY. 

1200
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:10,406
JOBLESS. 

1201
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:11,574
THINK OF THAT. 

1202
00:50:11,574 --> 00:50:13,909
JOBLESS CLAIMS JUST FELL TO A 

1203
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,213
NEARLY 50 YEAR LOW. 

1204
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,814
IS THAT GOOD? 

1205
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,450
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? 

1206
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,018
50 YEAR LOW. 

1207
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,286
WE HAVE CREATED OVER 4 MILLION 

1208
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:26,489
NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. 

1209
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:26,756
4MILLION. 

1210
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:27,690
NOBODY WOULD HAVE SAID THAT. 

1211
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,726
IF I WOULD HAVE SAID, WE'LL 

1212
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,361
CREATE IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, 

1213
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,297
THEY WOULD SAY, YOU HAVE TO BE 

1214
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:34,564
KIDDING. 

1215
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,065
LOOK AT THIS. 

1216
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:39,703
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE. 

1217
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,537
WE LIFTED ALMOST 4 MILLION 

1218
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:49,112
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 

1219
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:49,513
WOW. 

1220
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:49,846
PRETTY GOOD. 

1221
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,114
NOW NUMBER ONE, WE'RE TAKING 

1222
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,182
CARE OF PEOPLE. 

1223
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,718
NUMBER TWO, IT DOESN'T COST US 

1224
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,052
ANYTHING. 

1225
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,954
4MILLION PEOPLE, THAT'S A LOT 

1226
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:58,454
OF MONEY. 

1227
00:50:58,454 --> 00:51:00,957
WE ADDED NEARLY, IT WILL SOON 

1228
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,759
BE 600,000 NEW MANUFACTURING 

1229
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:02,959
JOBS. 

1230
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:06,797
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE 

1231
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:07,798
ADDING JOBS. 

1232
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,933
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE 

1233
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:10,500
ADDING MANUFACTURING JOBS. 

1234
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,737
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE MOST 

1235
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,074
INCREDIBLE OF EVERYTHING, IS WE 

1236
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,576
ARE DOING THINGS WITH 

1237
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:19,943
MANUFACTURING. 

1238
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:20,743
COMPANIES ARE POURING BACK INTO 

1239
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:22,612
OUR COUNTRY AND THEY ARE COMING 

1240
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,780
BACK INTO YOUR STATE. 

1241
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,148
THEY ARE GOING TO MICHIGAN. 

1242
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,018
THEY ARE GOING TO OHIO RIGHT 

1243
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:28,218
HERE. 

1244
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,388
THEY ARE GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA 

1245
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,558
AND NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH 

1246
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:34,825
CAROLINA. 

1247
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,528
I WAS WITH PRIME MINISTER, ABI, 

1248
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:38,795
OF JAPAN. 

1249
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,964
HE HAS MANY COMPANIES MOVING 

1250
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:41,130
IN. 

1251
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,800
I SAID LOOK, WE HAVE A BIG 

1252
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,367
DEFICIT WITH YOU. 

1253
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,769
WE TAKE CARE OF YOUR MILITARY 

1254
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,537
AND WE HAVE A DEFICIT. 

1255
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,638
THEY SAID WE ARE MOVING MANY 

1256
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:49,606
COMPANIES INTO THE UNITED 

1257
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:49,839
STATES. 

1258
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,409
AND HE IS, AND HE HAS BEEN. 

1259
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,411
AND IF YOU LOOK, JUST TAKE A 

1260
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:54,611
LOOK. 

1261
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,346
MANY COUNTRIES ARE DOING THAT. 

1262
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:59,015
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HAVING 

1263
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,750
DEFICITS WITH EVERY COUNTRY. 

1264
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,488
AND CHINA, WE'RE TAKING THEM ON 

1265
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:04,855
VERY STRONGLY. 

1266
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:09,492
FIRST TIME EVER. 

1267
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:09,892
VERY STRONGLY. 

1268
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:12,462
AND THEY EITHER OPEN IT UP TO 

1269
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,331
MAKE IT FAIR AND DON'T CHARGE 

1270
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,165
US WHAT THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE 

1271
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:18,502
THAT'S NO GOOD OR WE JUST DON'T 

1272
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,070
DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. 

1273
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,139
IT'S A SIMPLE THING. 

1274
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,909
AND IN FOUR MONTHS, THEY HAVE 

1275
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:26,543
GONE WAY DOWN. 

1276
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,447
I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO WAY 

1277
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:30,647
DOWN. 

1278
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,348
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR CHINA. 

1279
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:34,016
THEY HAVE NOT TREATED US WELL. 

1280
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:46,596
WE LOST OVER THE YEARS, $500 

1281
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,330
BILLION. 

1282
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:47,764
400, 500. 

1283
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,097
$523BILLION. 

1284
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:48,531
WE REBUILT CHINA. 

1285
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,933
HOW STUPID ARE WE? 

1286
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,103
HOW STUPID ARE WE? 

1287
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,105
WE BUILD A CAR AND WE SEND IT 

1288
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,607
TO CHINA AND THEY CHARGE A 

1289
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,076
TARIFF OR A TAX OF 25%. 

1290
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,978
THEY BUILD A CAR AND THEY SEND 

1291
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,549
IT TO THE U.S. AND IT IS 2.5%, 

1292
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,250
BUT WE DON'T CHARGE THEM. 

1293
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,853
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY. 

1294
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,621
AND I SAID WHY DON'T THEY HAVE 

1295
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,491
TO PAY AT LEAST THE 2.5? 

1296
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,493
NOBODY COULD TELL ME WHY. 

1297
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:16,826
NOBODY. 

1298
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:20,096
SO THINK OF IT. 

1299
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,731
THEY CHARGE US 25%, RIGHT? 

1300
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:22,766
WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING. 

1301
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:26,469
OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A VERY 

1302
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,571
FAIR DEAL. 

1303
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,271
HOW STUPID IS IT? 

1304
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:33,943
SO THE STUPID DAYS ARE OVER, 

1305
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:34,176
FOLKS. 

1306
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:38,215
I'M SORRY. 

1307
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,920
I LOVE SAUDI ARABIA. 

1308
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,890
THEY ARE GREAT. 

1309
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,691
KING SOLEMN. 

1310
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,557
I SPOKE TO HIM THIS MORNING. 

1311
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:53,964
I SAID TO HIM, KING, YOU HAVE 

1312
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:54,998
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 

1313
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,334
WITHOUT US, WHO KNOWS WHAT IS 

1314
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,134
GOING TO HAPPEN. 

1315
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,603
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE 

1316
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,638
ABLE TO KEEP THOSE AIRPLANES, 

1317
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:02,672
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1318
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,874
THEY WOULD BE ATTACKED. 

1319
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,812
WITH US, THEY ARE SAFE. 

1320
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:09,112
TOTALLY SAFE. 

1321
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,381
ÃºBUT WE DON'T GET 

1322
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,148
BE GETTING. 

1323
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,283
WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THEIR 

1324
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:13,550
MILITARY. 

1325
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,618
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, WHY 

1326
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:17,920
ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THE MILITARY 

1327
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,789
OF THESE REALLY WEALTHY 

1328
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,089
COUNTRIES? 

1329
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,791
IT'S ONE THING WHERE COUNTRIES 

1330
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,327
ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE AND DANGER 

1331
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,929
AND IT COULD BE SOMETHING 

1332
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,831
REALLY UGLY AND HUNDREDS OF 

1333
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:28,765
THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

1334
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,833
COULD BE KILLED. 

1335
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,266
THAT'S ONE THING. 

1336
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,901
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE WEALTHY 

1337
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,970
COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA, 

1338
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,106
LIKE JAPAN, LIKE SOUTH KOREA, 

1339
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,575
WHY ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THEIR 

1340
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:38,842
MILITARY? 

1341
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,142
THEY WILL PAY US. 

1342
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:43,480
THE PROBLEM IS, NOBODY EVER 

1343
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:43,713
ASKED. 

1344
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,015
NOBODY EVER ASKED. 

1345
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:55,992
THEY DON'T ASK.

1346
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,827
I MEAN, WITH SOUTH KOREA, WE 

1347
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,130
ARE PAYING ABOUT 60% OF THEIR 

1348
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,031
MILITARY COSTS. 

1349
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:03,500
THEY BUY A MISSILE SYSTEM, BY 

1350
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,201
THE WAY, WE'RE DOING GREAT WITH 

1351
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:05,534
NORTH KOREA. 

1352
00:55:05,534 --> 00:55:12,208
I HAVE TO TELL YOU. 

1353
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,276
WE'RE DOING GREAT. 

1354
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,644
YOU KNOW, THESE DISHONEST 

1355
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,879
PEOPLE BACK THERE. 

1356
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,913
WHAT DID I DO? 

1357
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:19,949
WAS I THERE THREE MONTHS AGO? 

1358
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,818
FOR 80 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN 

1359
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,485
WORKING WITH THIS. 

1360
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,654
FOR 25 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN 

1361
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,589
WORKING ON MISSILES AND 

1362
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:26,856
NUCLEAR. 

1363
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:27,624
THEY GOT NOWHERE. 

1364
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,292
THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER OUR 

1365
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,161
PRESIDENT'S PHONE CALLS. 

1366
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,997
WHEN THEY CALLED, THEY TOLD HIM 

1367
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,165
DON'T CALL US. 

1368
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,001
AND YES, I AGREED, THE RHETORIC 

1369
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,336
WAS UNBELIEVABLY HARSH AT THE 

1370
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:40,636
BEGINNING. 

1371
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:43,006
BUT WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 

1372
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,339
RELATIONSHIP. 

1373
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:46,576
WE WERE GOING TO WAR WITH NORTH 

1374
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:46,809
KOREA. 

1375
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:50,280
THAT WAS WHAT WAS GOING TO 

1376
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,513
HAPPEN. 

1377
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,749
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

1378
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:53,082
BEEN KILLED. 

1379
00:55:53,082 --> 00:55:54,884
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOLD ME WHEN I 

1380
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,686
SAT JUST BEFORE TAKING OFFICE. 

1381
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,088
HE SAID THE SINGLE BIGGEST 

1382
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:00,723
PROBLEM THIS COUNTRY HAS IN 

1383
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:01,124
NORTH KOREA. 

1384
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,759
HE SAID HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO 

1385
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,260
GOING TO WAR. 

1386
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,063
BUT FORTUNATELY, HIS TIME WAS 

1387
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,631
UP. 

1388
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,533
HIS TIME WAS UP. 

1389
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,435
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A WAR. 

1390
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:17,207
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

1391
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:17,540
BEEN KILLED. 

1392
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,143
I MEAN, 30 MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT 

1393
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,043
OFF THE BORDER. 

1394
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:22,712
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

1395
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,046
BEEN KILLED. 

1396
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,982
YES, I CAME IN AND TOOK A VERY 

1397
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:26,682
HARD POSITION. 

1398
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:27,282
VERY HARD POSITION. 

1399
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:28,651
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1400
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,120
NOW WE HAVE THIS GREAT 

1401
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,788
RELATIONSHIP AND LET'S SEE WHAT 

1402
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:32,622
HAPPENS. 

1403
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:37,761
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

1404
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,963
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

1405
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:44,033
IF YOU THINK -- SO THE FAKERS 

1406
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,568
ARE SAYING THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT 

1407
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:45,801
TO DO. 

1408
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:49,806
I HAVE THE HOSTAGES BACK FOR 

1409
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:50,073
NOTHING. 

1410
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,606
OBAMA PAID $1.8 BILLION. 

1411
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:53,442
I GOT THEM BACK FOR NOTHING. 

1412
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:53,676
RIGHT? 

1413
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,745
WE GOT THE REMAINS OF OUR GREAT 

1414
00:56:55,745 --> 00:57:02,819
HEROS BACK FOR MANY, MANY 

1415
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:03,052
YEARS. 

1416
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,988
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYMORE NUCLEAR 

1417
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:05,255
TESTING. 

1418
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,556
IN FACT, THEY ARE CLOSING UP A 

1419
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,991
LOT OF THE SITES. 

1420
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,959
YOU DON'T HAVE ROCKETS GOING 

1421
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:10,125
UP. 

1422
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,962
YOU DON'T HAVE MISSILES GOING 

1423
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:13,196
UP. 

1424
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,697
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE. 

1425
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,598
I LIKE HIM. 

1426
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,399
HE LIKES ME. 

1427
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,500
I GUESS THAT'S OKAY. 

1428
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,702
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? 

1429
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,572
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? 

1430
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,441
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE EWE 

1431
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:26,376
KNOW THE TERM, RIGHT? 

1432
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,279
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. 

1433
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,813
BUT WE COULD HAVE BEEN IN 

1434
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:31,113
SOMETHING. 

1435
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:32,916
I'M NOT SAYING WHAT'S GOING TO 

1436
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:33,149
HAPPEN. 

1437
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,685
WHO KNOWS, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER 

1438
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:36,886
MEETING, KIM WOULD HAVE ANOTHER 

1439
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,721
MEETING, WE'LL HAVE A MEETING. 

1440
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,556
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID? 

1441
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:42,892
I HAD ONE OF THE ANCHORS SAY, 

1442
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,627
WHY HAS PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVEN 

1443
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,395
UP SO MUCH? 

1444
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,664
I DIDN'T GIVE UP ANYTHING. 

1445
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:48,998
REALLY. 

1446
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,500
I DIDN'T GIVE UP ANYTHING. 

1447
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,836
WHAT DID I GIVE UP? 

1448
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,204
I GAVE UP NOTHING. 

1449
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:56,573
WHY HAVE I GIVEN UP? 

1450
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,175
THE ONLY THING I GAVE UP, I 

1451
00:57:59,175 --> 00:57:59,642
AGREED TO MEET. 

1452
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,911
BOY, WE LOST A LOT, RIGHT? 

1453
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,180
IN OTHER WORDS, I AGREED TO 

1454
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,481
MEET. 

1455
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,515
I GAVE UP NOTHING. 

1456
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,749
THEY ARE JUST FAKERS. 

1457
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,951
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. 

1458
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:11,253
IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY. 

1459
00:58:11,253 --> 00:58:12,922
IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY. 

1460
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:17,627
WE GAVE UP SO MUCH. 

1461
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:22,532
NOW OBAMA WITH THE IRAN DEAL 

1462
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,335
GAVE HIM $150 BILLION AND GAVE 

1463
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:29,172

1464
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,006
IN CASH. 

1465
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:30,273
IN CASH. 

1466
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,376
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THAT 

1467
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:33,542

1468
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,878
AND NOBODY SAID HE GAVE UP TOO 

1469
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:36,078
MUCH. 

1470
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:36,546
EXCEPT ME. 

1471
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,682
THAT'S WHY I ENDED THE DEAL. 

1472
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,618
OKAY. 

1473
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:45,955
I ENDED THE DEAL. 

1474
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,291
GAVE IT TO THEM IN CASH. 

1475
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,627

00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,795
WHERE YOU HAVE $100 BILLS. 

1477

YOU HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS. 

1478
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:55,932
IT'S LIKE TWICE THE SIZE OF 

1479
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:56,132

1480
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:59,702
THAT'S LIKE A MILLION BUCKS IN 

1481
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,169

WHERE THE DO YOU GET $1.8 

1485
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:10,012
BILLION IN CASH. 

1486
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:12,081
DON'T SAY IT WAS FOR THE 

1487
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,917
HOSTAGES, OR MAYBE HE HAD 

1488
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,019
SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND. 

1489
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,453
WE ARE DOING GREAT. 

1490
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,956
THAT WAS A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. 

1491
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,625
AND YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING, 

1492
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,560
WHEN I DID IT AND I WAS BEING 

1493
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,562
TOUGH, AND SO DID HE. 

1494
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:27,830
WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH, 

1495
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,900
THEN WE FELL IN LOVE, OKAY? 

1496
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,200
NO REALLY.

HE WROTE ME BEAUTIFUL LETTERS 

1498
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,704
AND THEY ARE GREAT LETTERS. 

1499
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,606
WE FELL IN LOVE. 

1500
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,174
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1501
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,108
THEY'LL SAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID 

1502
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:42,078
THEY FELL IN LOVE, HOW 

1503
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,680
HORRIBLE. 

1504
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,150
HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT. 

1505
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:47,583
SO UNPRESIDENTIAL. 

1506
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,686
AND I ALWAYS TELL YOU, IT'S SO 

1507
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,086
EASY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL. 

1508
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,221
INSTEAD OF HAVING 10,000 PEOPLE 

1509
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:55,525

01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,692
THEY ARE TREATING US UNFAIRLY 

1543

THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 

1558
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,250
THEY ARE WARRIORS, BUT NOT INTO 

1559
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,518
THE WORLD OF FINANCE. 

1560
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:31,387

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? 

1570
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,837
I'M TELLING YOU, BIG 

1571
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:48,304

THEY HAVE ALL REACHED THEIR 

1602
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,295
LOWEST LEVELS IN THE HISTORY OF

IF HE WAS PLAYING TODAY, HE 

1616
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:09,685

1617
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,921

01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,196
WAS KILLING YOU. 

1638
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:56,532
IT SOUNDS SO BEAUTIFUL. 

1639
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,801
THE EPA IS SO-CALLED A KILLER. 

1640
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,036
IT WAS A KILLER. 

1641
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,570
IT WAS COSTING THIS COUNTRY A 

1642
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:01,904
FORTUNE. 

1643
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,207
IT WAS A TOTAL KILLER. 

1644
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:07,276
HAS SUCH NICE NAMES, SUCH A 

1645
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:07,609
NICE TITLE. 

1646
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:08,644
IT PUT EVERYBODY OUT OF 

1647
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,746
BUSINESS AND IT TOOK AWAY OUR 

1648
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:11,013
STRENGTH. 

1649
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,615
IT TOOK AWAY OUR WEALTH. 

1650
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:13,916
I WENT THROUGH THE UNITED 

1651
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,485
STATES FROM THE JOB KILLING 

1652
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:20,623
VERY UNFAIR AND VERY, VERY 

1653
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:26,261
EXPENSIVE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. 

1654
01:04:26,261 --> 01:04:27,129
A KILLER. 

1655
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:27,796
THESE ARE KILLERS. 

1656
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:30,533
THEY WERE PUTTING OUR COUNTRY 

1657
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,199
OUT OF BUSINESS. 

1658
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:37,273
WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON 

1659
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,208
BEAUTIFUL CLEAN COAL. 

1660
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,911
AND IN JUST THE LAST YEAR, OUR 

1661
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,845
COAL EXPORTS HAVE SKYROCKETED. 

1662
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:47,917
THIS IS EXPORTS TO OTHER 

1663
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,385
COUNTRIES BY 60%. 

1664
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:53,923
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? 

1665
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,258
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE 

1666
01:04:56,258 --> 01:04:58,461
NUMBER ONE ENERGY PRODUCER IN 

1667
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:58,761
THE WORLD. 

1668
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:02,431
THAT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY. 

1669
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:05,434
A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT. 

1670
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,003
WE'RE FIXING THE ONE SIDED 

1671
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:11,774
TRADE DEALS THAT HAVE STOLEN 

1672
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:12,141
AMERICAN JOBS. 

1673
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,009
DRAINED AMERICAN WEALTH. 

1674
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,911
IT'S BEEN A MASSIVE TRANSFER OF 

1675
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,478
WEALTH OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 

1676
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:19,982
WE'RE BRINGING IT ALL BACK. 

1677
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,918
THEY'RE ALL COMING BACK. 

1678
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:26,956
WE'VE REACHED A DEAL TO REPLACE 

1679
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:27,523
THE HORRIBLE NAFTA. 

1680
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:33,295
ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS 

1681
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:33,930
EVER. 

1682
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,998
WITH A BRAND-NEW U.S., MEXICO 

1683
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,233
TRADE DEAL AND WE'LL SEE WHAT 

1684
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:41,404
HAPPENS WITH CANADA, IF THEY 

1685
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:41,704
COME ALONG. 

1686
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,039
THEY HAVE TO BE FAIR. 

1687
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:47,009
THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE 

1688
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,010
TARIFFS. 

1689
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,012
OVER 300% ON DAIRY PRODUCTS. 

1690
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,079
THAT'S LIKE A BARRIER. 

1691
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:52,381
THEY HAVE TO BE FAIR. 

1692
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:54,183
WE MADE THE DEAL WITH MEXICO 

1693
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:57,386
AND IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR BOTH 

1694
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:57,686
COUNTRIES. 

1695
01:05:57,686 --> 01:05:58,720
NAFTA WAS THE WORST DEAL. 

1696
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,123
JUST THIS WEEK, I SIGNED A 

1697
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,425
GROUND BREAKING NEW TRADE DEAL 

1698
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:05,594
WITH SOUTH KOREA THAT WILL 

1699
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:06,929
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE EXPORTS 

1700
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:07,730
OF AMERICAN MADE GOODS. 

1701
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:15,171
I SAID YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR 

1702
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:15,438
COUNTRY. 

1703
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,472
NOW THE DEMOCRATS WILL LOOK AT 

1704
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,707
ANY OF THESE DEALS. 

1705
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:20,009
THEY WON'T READ THEM. 

1706
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,577
THEY WON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 

1707
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:21,777
THEM. 

1708
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,114
I GUESS I WOULD DO IT IF I WAS 

1709
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:25,781
THEM AS WELL. 

1710
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,883
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

1711
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:28,417
IT'S NO GOOD. 

1712
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:28,784
IT'S TERRIBLE. 

1713
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,019
HAVE YOU READ IT? 

1714
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,386
THESE DEALS ARE UNBELIEVABLE. 

1715
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:33,121
THESE DEALS ARE SO GOOD FOR US. 

1716
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:35,758
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE 

1717
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,259
COMPANIES LEAVING OUR COUNTRY, 

1718
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,727
FIRING EVERYBODY, AND THEN 

1719
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:40,229
SELLING THEIR PRODUCT BACK INTO 

1720
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,997
THE UNITED STATES WITH NO 

1721
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:42,230
TAXES. 

1722
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:50,005
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. 

1723
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:53,075
AND THANKS TO OUR VERY STRONG 

1724
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,643
POSITION ON TARIFFS, BECAUSE I 

1725
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:58,013
WANT THEM TO NEGOTIATE WITH US. 

1726
01:06:58,013 --> 01:06:59,582
WE HAVE SAVED AMERICAN ALUMINUM 

1727
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:02,318
AND AMERICAN STEEL COMPANIES. 

1728
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,618
THEY ARE THRIVING. 

1729
01:07:03,618 --> 01:07:05,654
AMERICAN STEEL IS BUILDING 

1730
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,557
PLANTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 

1731
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,427
STEEL WORKERS ARE BACK, AND THE 

1732
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:19,502
MINERS ARE SUPPLYING THE METAL 

1733
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:19,702
COAL. 

1734
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,302
WE DON'T NEED FOREIGN STEEL. 

1735
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,971
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE'RE IN A 

1736
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:22,238
CONFLICT? 

1737
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,339
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? 

1738
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:26,976
GET OUR STEEL FROM SOME FOREIGN 

1739
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:27,443
COUNTRY? 

1740
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,410
WE NEED STEEL. 

1741
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:28,810
WE NEED ALUMINUM. 

1742
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:31,413
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU 

1743
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:31,613
NEED. 

1744
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:33,448
WE'RE HIRING A LOT OF PEOPLE. 

1745
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:34,149
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1746
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:36,118
OUR TREASURY IS GETTING LOADED 

1747
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:36,652
UP WITH MONEY. 

1748
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,187
BECAUSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

1749
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,257
WILL BE FLOWING IN BECAUSE WE 

1750
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,159
CHARGE 25 WHEN THEY DUMP. 

1751
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,259
WHEN THEY DUMP STEEL, WHAT THEY 

1752
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:46,028
WANT TO DO IS PUT OUR STEEL 

1753
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,529
COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. 

1754
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:49,165
THEN THEY SELL US STEEL AT 

1755
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,666
PRICES THAT ARE SO HIGH NOBODY 

1756
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:51,867
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT. 

1757
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,270
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE 

1758
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,337
JOBS CREATED. 

1759
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,506
AND NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT 

1760
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,509
ALL THE MONEY THAT IS FLOWING 

1761
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:04,513
IN TO THE UNITED STATES OF 

1762
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:04,780
AMERICA. 

1763
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,348
THEY DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT 

1764
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:06,715
IT. 

1765
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,385
AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST 

1766
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:10,753
IT ARE USUALLY HAVING, YOU 

1767
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,222
KNOW, YOU GO TO THESE OTHER 

1768
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:13,555
COUNTRIES. 

1769
01:08:13,555 --> 01:08:14,957
THEY HAVE COMPANIES THERE. 

1770
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,393
AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE, WE 

1771
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,160
LIKE FREE TRADE. 

1772
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,895
SO I'LL SAY, EVEN TO 

1773
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:20,729
CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS, LET 

1774
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,264
ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. 

1775
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,934
SO WE HAVE A COUNTRY, TAKE 

1776
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:25,167
INDIA. 

1777
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:25,600
GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 

1778
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,236
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL NOW 

1779
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:28,504
BECAUSE THEY DON'T ME TO DO 

1780
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,104
WHAT I HAVE TO DO. 

1781
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:31,807
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A DEAL 

1782
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:32,841
WITH ANYBODY ELSE. 

1783
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:35,010
I SAID, SO TAKE INDIA. 

1784
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,511
YOU TALK ABOUT FREE TRADE. 

1785
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:39,215
SO LET'S SAY THEY CHARGE US 60% 

1786
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,317
TARIFF ON A PRODUCT. 

1787
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,252
AND FOR THE SAME PRODUCT, WHEN 

1788
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,386
THEY SENT IT IN, WE CHARGED 

1789
01:08:45,386 --> 01:08:45,720
THEM NOTHING. 

1790
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,157
SO NOW I WANT TO CHARGE THEM 

1791
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,626
25% OR 20 OR 10 OR SOMETHING. 

1792
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,961
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

1793
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:52,794
THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE. 

1794
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,261
WE DON'T LIKE IT. 

1795
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:56,631
I SAID WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE 

1796
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:57,066
COMING FROM? 

1797
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,367
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM? 

1798
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,703
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW DIFFICULT 

1799
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:00,969
THAT IS. 

1800
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:03,439
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM? 

1801
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,407
SO, INDIA, JUST TO USE AS AN 

1802
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,674
EXAMPLE. 

1803
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,643
I COULD GIVE YOU OTHERS THAT 

1804
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:07,943
ARE BRUTAL. 

1805
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:09,611
JUST BRUTAL WHAT THEY DO TO US. 

1806
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:13,549
HOW THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 

1807
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:13,849
STUPIDITY. 

1808
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,283
WE NEVER HAD PEOPLE NEGOTIATED. 

1809
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:19,121
THEY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. 

1810
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:19,520
TAKE INDIA. 

1811
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,788
THEY CHARGE US 60%. 

1812
01:09:20,788 --> 01:09:21,656
WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING. 

1813
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:24,126
WHEN I SAY I'M GOING TO PUT A 

1814
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,362
25% TARIFF ON JUST TO MAKE IT A 

1815
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,696
LITTLE BIT FAIRER, THEY SAY 

1816
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,598
THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE. 

1817
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,167
I SAID WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? 

1818
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:32,533
REMEMBER THIS. 

1819
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:34,737
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 

1820
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,372

HAVE OWNERSHIP OF COMPANIES IN 

1822
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:41,243
THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. 

1823
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,377
REMEMBER THAT, PLEASE. 

1824
01:09:43,377 --> 01:09:43,578
OKAY. 

1825
01:09:43,578 --> 01:09:43,944
REMEMBER THAT. 

1826
01:09:43,944 --> 01:09:46,081
OR THEY ARE REPRESENTED BY 

1827
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:46,348
LOBBIES. 

1828
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,683
SO THE STEEL PEOPLE LOVE ME. 

1829
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,218
THE COAL PEOPLE LOVE ME. 

1830
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,118
MANY PEOPLE LOVE ME. 

1831
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:52,254
YOU KNOW WHO LOVES ME? 

1832
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:54,156
OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER DONE 

1833
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,658
BETTER. 

1834
01:09:55,658 --> 01:10:01,029
THAT'S WHO LOVES ME. 

1835
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:01,263
CRAZY. 

1836
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:04,500
SO TO GIVE OUR WORKERS AND 

1837
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,935
BUSINESSES JUST IN FINISHING 

1838
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,704
UP, A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 

1839
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,539
REPUBLICANS PASSED THE BIGGEST 

1840
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:14,610
PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS 

1841
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,746
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 

1842
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,581
WE PASSED SOMETHING ELSE THAT I 

1843
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:20,015
LOVE. 

1844
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:20,382
RIGHT TO TRY. 

1845
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,619
YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT TO TRY IS? 

1846
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:24,586
SOMEBODY IS TERMINALLY ILL. 

1847
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:26,722
WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF SOME OF 

1848
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,357
THE GREATEST PRODUCTS AND WE 

1849
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:28,790
COULDN'T USE THEM. 

1850
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,426
THE PERSON WILL DIE IN FOUR 

1851
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,228
MONTHS, WE COULDN'T USE THEM. 

1852
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,329
FOR 45 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN 

1853
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,764
TRYING TO GET THIS PASSED. 

1854
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:36,198
NOT THAT EASY. 

1855
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,166
I GOT IT PASSED. 

1856
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,201
RIGHT TO TRY. 

1857
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,936
SOMEONE IS TERMINALLY ILL, THEY 

1858
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:43,505
HAVE TO SIGN THE CLAUSE AND 

1859
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,707
THINGS AND NOW THEY DON'T HAVE 

1860
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:48,944
TO TRAVEL TO PARTS OF THE 

1861
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:49,345
WORLD. 

1862
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:53,916
WE PASS VETERANS CHOICE, GIVING 

1863
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,351
OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT TO SEEK 

1864
01:10:56,351 --> 01:10:57,820
A PRIVATE DOCTOR IF THEY ARE 

1865
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:05,928
STANDING IN LINE FOR FOUR 

1866
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:06,161
WEEKS. 

1867
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,762
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED. 

1868
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:10,466
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 45 

1869
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:10,699
YEARS. 

1870
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,634
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED. 

1871
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:15,170
VETERANS ARE OUR GREATEST 

1872
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,006
PEOPLE. 

1873
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:20,376
ANY VETERANS HERE? 

1874
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:20,709
VETERANS. 

1875
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,845
IT WAS VERY TOUGH. 

1876
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:23,112
45 YEARS. 

1877
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,279
WE GOT IT PASSED. 

1878
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:25,681
SO NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING IN 

1879
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,316
LINE FOR THREE WEEKS AND DYING 

1880
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,719
IN MANY CASES, BELIEVE IT OR 

1881
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,654
NOT, THEY WAIT SO LONG TO SEE A 

1882
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,589
DOCTOR, THEY END UP BECOMING 

1883
01:11:34,589 --> 01:11:35,190
TERMINAL. 

1884
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,892
THEY END UP DYING. 

1885
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:40,162
THEY NOW GO OUT AND SEE A 

1886
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,431
DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL, IT'S 

1887
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:42,664
GREAT. 

1888
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:43,999
WE PASSED IT. 

1889
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,368
WE ALSO PASS A LANDMARK 

1890
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,870
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO ALL THESE 

1891
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,708
BAD PLAYERS IN THE VA, WE FIRE 

1892
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:53,842
THEM SO FAST. 

1893
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:57,045
THEY COULD DO ANYTHING. 

1894
01:11:57,045 --> 01:12:01,183
I JUST SIGNED LEGISLATION TO 

1895
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:01,817
COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY REBUILD 

1896
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:02,951
ALL OF OUR MILITARY. 

1897
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,087
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT AND YOU 

1898
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:05,387
KNOW WHAT? 

1899
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:07,021
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME. 

1900
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:09,858
SO IMPORTANT TO ME. 

1901
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:10,191
SO IMPORTANT. 

1902
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:11,527
WE HAVE TANKS. 

1903
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:14,029
WE HAVE SHIPS. 

1904
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,398
WE HAVE EVERYTHING. 

1905
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:16,865
SO IMPORTANT. 

1906
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,667
AND THE PENTAGON IS WORKING 

1907
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:22,538
RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK TO CREATE 

1908
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,773
A 6th BRANCH OF THE UNITED 

1909
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:29,912
STATES ARMED FORCES CALLED THE 

1910
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:34,550
SPACE FORCE. 

1911
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,017
RIGHT? 

1912
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:35,350
SPACE FORCE. 

1913
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,419
I WENT THROUGH THE UNITED 

1914
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,388
STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE 

1915
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,156
SIDED IRAN DEAL, AND IRAN IS 

1916
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,993
NOT THE SAME COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, 

1917
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:45,226
FOLKS. 

1918
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:49,298
AND THEY BETTER NOT DO NUCLEAR. 

1919
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:49,698
THEY BETTER NOT. 

1920
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,901
IT'S NOT THE SAME COUNTRY. 

1921
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:57,005
WE HAVE ALL RECOGNIZED THE TRUE 

1922
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,108
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. 

1923
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:02,010
RECENTLY, WHEN I OPENED THE 

1924
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,079
AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 

1925
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:09,385
AND I JUST COME FROM A 

1926
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:09,985
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL TRIP. 

1927
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:13,122
I'VE DONE A LOT OF TRIPS FROM 

1928
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,757
THE UNITED NATIONS TO SAUDI 

1929
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:19,061
ARABIA TO CHINA, TO UK, 

1930
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,629
EUROPEAN UNION, ALL OVER THE 

1931
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,097
WORLD, AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE 

1932
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:24,633
MEANS A LOT OF JOBS AND A LOT 

1933
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,868
OF INCOME COMING INTO OUR 

1934
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,436
COUNTRY NAY NOBODY EVER DID 

1935
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:27,903
BEFORE. 

1936
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:28,970
NOBODY EVER DID IT. %

1937
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:32,607
I MADE CLEAR WE WILL NEVER 

1938
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:35,010
SACRIFICE AMERICA'S SOVEREIGNTY 

1939
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,412
TO AN ELECTED, UNACCOUNTABLE, 

1940
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,012
FOREIGN BUREAUCRAT. 

1941
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:41,283
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. 

1942
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:45,387
WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY OF 

1943
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:50,025
GLOBALISM AND WE EMBRACE THE 

1944
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:52,461
DOCTRINE OF, LET'S PUT IT THIS

WAY, WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 

1946
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:57,099
THAT'S OUR DOCTRINE. 

1947
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,334
YOU CAN CALL IT PATRIOTISM, BUT 

1948
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,069
IT'S REALLY THE DOCTRINE OF WE 

1949
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,604

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

1982
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:36,999
THIS GREAT STATE WAS BUILT BY 

1983
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:43,338
TOUGH PIONEER MEN AND STRONG 

1984
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:43,839
PIONEER WOMEN. 

1985
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,274
THESE BRAVE WEST VIRGINIA 

1986
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:48,877
PATRIOTS VENTURED OUT INTO THE 

1987
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,013
WILDERNESS AND UP INTO THE

01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,116
MOUNTAINS TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL 

1989
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:54,316
HOME. 

1990
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,484
A LIFE, AND A DREAM. 

1991
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:56,952
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1992
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:57,185
MONEY. 

1993
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,989
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1994
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:01,222
LUXURY. 

1995
01:16:01,222 --> 01:16:04,359
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 

1996
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,027
COMMON. 

1997
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:05,993
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES. 

1998
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:08,397
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.

2000
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:18,607
TRUE. 

2001
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,943
WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 

2002
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:24,412
THESE COURAGEOUS AMERICANS. 

2003
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:26,381
YOUR ANCESTORS DID NOT POUR OUT 

2004
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,417
THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS, 

2005
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,553
SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT HOME 

2006
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:36,525
WHILE OTHERS TRY TO ERASE THEIR 

2007
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,694
LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR PROUD 

2008
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:39,127
AMERICAN HERITAGE. 

2009
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,562
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

2010
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:43,899
TRYING TO DO WITH THEIR CRAZY 

2011
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:44,633
POLICIES. 

2012
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,702
JUST LIKE THE PIONEERS AND 

2013
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,803

2014
01:16:48,803 --> 01:16:50,205
WE ARE GOING TO WORK. 

2015
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,174
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT. 

2016

REVOLUTION AND EVEN THESE 

2022
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,326
PEOPLE WILL ADMIT THAT. 

2023
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,095
THAT WAS A REVOLUTION LIKE THEY 

2024
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:15,230
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. 

2025
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,931
THAT WAS A REVOLUTION THAT WAS 

2026
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:19,968

2027

2028
01:17:20,101 --> 01:17:21,703
THEY CAME FROM EVERYWHERE. 

2029
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,973
AND AT THE END OF THAT EVENING, 

2030
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,043
THEY SAID, I HATE TO TELL YOU 

2031
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:29,911
THIS, A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE 

2032
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:33,482
HAPPENING TONIGHT FOR THE 

2033

HAPPENED.

>>  Reporter: THIS IS A 

2088
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,956
TERRIBLE STORY THAT DECADES AGO 

2089
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,225
CAUSED THE DEATHS OF UP TO 

2090
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,860
3,000 BRITISH PEOPLE AND MAYBE 

2091

TENS AND THOUSANDS MORE IN THE 

2092
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:16,031
FUTURE. 

2093
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,398
THIS IS FACTOR 8. IT'S PRODUCED 

2094
01:22:17,398 --> 01:22:19,601
FROM HUMAN BLOOD AND IT HELPS 

2095
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,969
THE BLOOD TO CLOT. 

2096
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,338

2098

MAINLY FROM AMERICA. 

2099
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,643
IT WAS USED TO SAVE THE LIVES 

2100
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:30,578
OF HEMOPHILIACS AND THOSE GIVEN

2103
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,216
IT WAS A PROBLEM. 

2104
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:35,716
A TERRIFYING PROBLEM. 

2105
01:22:35,716 --> 01:22:40,721
MUCH OF THE BLOOD THAT PRODUCED 

2106
01:22:40,721 --> 01:22:44,659
FACTOR VIII WAS INFECTED WITH 

2107
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,794

THE FIGURES ARE STAGGERING. 

2111
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:52,667
BECAUSE AS ALL THE BLOOD WAS 

2112
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,636
MIXED TOGETHER, IT ONLY TOOK

IT WAS EXCITING TO BE DREAMING 

2237
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:05,219
OF BUILDING SOMETHING NEW 

2238
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:07,255
RATHER THAN TO BE COLLABORATING 

2239
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,023
IN THE DESTRUCTION OF A PROUD 

2240
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:09,323

DID THEY HELP YOU WITH THE 

2244
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:14,762
MONEY AS WELL? 

2245
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:17,097
>>  YES, MONEY DOES COUNT. 

2246
01:27:17,097 --> 01:27:18,866
CIVIL HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS 

2247
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:19,934
WITH US SO FAR. 

2248
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:21,903
THEY PROVIDED ENOUGH RUNWAY TO

2250
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:24,906
PEOPLE OF COLORADO, BECAUSE AT 

2251
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,441
THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE NOT 

2252
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,910
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COUNT ON

2254
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:30,511
AND EVER. 

2255

COLORADO'S GOVERNOR FORMED A 

2257
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:39,020
PACK, AS A POSSIBLE RUN FOR 

2258
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,320
PRESIDENT. 

2259
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,155
A CLIMBER REMAKING HIS LIFE 

2260
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,924
AFTER A DEVASTATING FALL AND A 

2261
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:43,324
DOZEN SURGERIES. 

2262
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:46,394
AND A PIECE ON THE SOUTH PLATT

SIMPSON. 

2265
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,064
ON THIS DAY, HE WAS DOING 

2266
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,265
INTERVIEWS FOR HIS STORY, MUCH 

2267
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:52,900
LIKE HE DID AS A VETERAN 

2268
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,036
REPORTER FOR THE DENVER POST, 

2269
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,605
WHERE HE SPENT 33 YEARS AND 

2270
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:57,972
BATTLED CANCER. 

2271
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:59,740
THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENCES. 

2272
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,009
HE WORKS FROM A HOME OFFICE, 

2273
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:03,177
NOT A NEWSROOM. 

2274
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,613
AND ANOTHER BIG CHANGE, THE JOB 

2275
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:06,881
IS FUN AGAIN. 

2276
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,850
>>  HAS THIS ENERGIZED, 

2277
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:11,319
REENERGIZED YOU TO BE A 

2278
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:11,686
JOURNALIST? 

2279
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:15,089
>>  IT ABSOLUTELY HAS. 

2280
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,457
IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

2281
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,659
WORKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE AND 

2282
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:20,228
WORKING FOR YOURSELF. 

2283
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,095
THIS IS OUR BABY. 

2284
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:23,998
IT WILL RISE OR FALL ON OUR 

2285
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:26,033
EFFORTS AND THAT IS ENERGIZING. 

2286
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:29,103
IT'S ALSO A LITTLE FRIGHTENING. 

2287
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,271
BUT OVERALL, IT'S A GREAT 

2288
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:30,605
FEELING. 

2289
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:33,174
>>  JOURNALISM IS EXPENSIVE. 

2290
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:36,177
AND THE SUN INSISTS ON PAYING 

2291
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:36,710

PASSIONATE ABOUT JOURNALISM, 

2294

2298
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:49,390
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT 

2299
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,159
THE COLORADO SUN HAS BEEN ABLE

WHAT WE WERE MAKING AT THE 

2303
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:56,697
DENVER POST OR IN SOME CASES 

2304
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:58,566
EVEN MORE THAN WE EARNED AT THE 

2305
01:28:58,566 --> 01:28:58,899
DENVER POST. 

2306
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:01,302
>>  TO PAY ITS WAY AS CIVIL 

2307

FUNDING TAPERS OFF, IT WILL 

2308
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,371
DEPEND ON COMMUNITY AND
