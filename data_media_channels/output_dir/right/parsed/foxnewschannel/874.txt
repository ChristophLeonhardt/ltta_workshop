AND NOT TURN AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT.
>>  WELL, HE'S GOT A LOT OF TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DURING TODAY'S SPUR OF THE
MOMENT MEDIA BLITZ, HE CALLED
KIM JONG-UN A STRONG HEAD OF
STATE.
THEN HE MADE THIS COMMENT THAT
RAISED SOME EYEBROWS.
>>  I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE
SAME
>> WHAT DID YOU MEAN JUST NOW
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WISHED
AMERICANS STOOD UP AT ATTENTION?
>>  I'M KIDDING.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SARCASM.
>>  HE DOES SPEAK OFTEN IN
HYPERBOLE AND SARCASM.
>>  HE DOES.
HE HAD A CHANCE TO ANSWER THAT
ONE WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT.
HE SAID HE WAS JOKING.
HE DOES OFTEN MAKE COMMENTS THAT
ARE POSITIVE OR PRAISING OF
DICTATORS AND HARDLINE LEADERS,
AND THAT COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF
WHERE HE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE
IN MANY CASES ABOUT U.S. ALLIES.
>>  THERE IS NOW TALK ABOUT
WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL SIT DOWN
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE HF
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE H
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-T
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-TO-
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-TO-FA
WITH PUTIN FOR A FACE-TO-FACE
MEETING.
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.
>>  IT'S POSSIBLE.
AND I THOUGHT THIS ALL STARTED
BECAUSE ONE OF YOU ASKED, SHOULD
PUTIN BE IN THE G7.
HE SHOULD BE IN THE G8.
A FEW YEARS AGO, PUTIN WAS IN
WHAT WAS CALLED THE G8.
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE
RUSSIA IN THAN OUT.
>>  THEY ARE MAJOR PLAYERS IN
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING FROM
SYRIA, TO NORTH KOREA, THE
MIDDLE EAST.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON
SOLVING THOSE KINDS OF PROBLEMS,
HE WANTS THEM TO BE AT THE
TABLE.
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE NEGOTIATING IN
VAIN.
>>  HE'S TAKEN A LOT OF HEAT FOR
SOMETIME FOR THE RELATIONSHIP HE
HAS WANTED TO BUILD WITH RUSSIA.
HE HAS THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION
GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL
RISK AND HEAT FOR HIM THERE
ANYWAY.
AND THERE'S THE FACT THAT PUTIN
WAS KICKED OUT OF THE G8.
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS FOR
RUSSIA NOT TO BE AT THAT TABLE.
BUT AS YOU SAID, HIS VIEW IS HE
WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN.
HE WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH KIM JONG-UN.
HE WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THESE LEADERS BECAUSE HE
THINKS THAT WILL BE PRODUCTIVE
FOR THE UNITED STATES.
>>  HE DOES TALK ABOUT THESE
DIFFERENT COALITIONS IN TERMS OF
RELATIONSHIP.
EVEN WHEN ASKED ABOUT GOING INTO
NORTH KOREA AND SITTING DOWN AND
BEING CRITICIZED FOR NOT DOING
PREPARATION.
WE WERE TOLD HE WAS BRIEFED
REPEATEDLY, BUT HE KEPT TALKING
ABOUT THE FACT THAT, FOR ME IT'S
A RELATIONSHIP.
I WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN CONNECT.
AND NOW HE SAYS WE DID.
>>  EXACTLY.
HE WAS A LEADER BOTH BEFORE HE
BECAME A POLITICIAN AND NOW IN
THE WHITE HOUSE HE OPERATES VERY
MUCH ON INSTINCT AND BUILDING
THAT RELATIONSHIP.
NOW NOT EVERYONE THINKS THAT'S
GOOD ENOUGH, BUT THAT'S A LOT OF
WHERE HIS CONFIDENCE COMES FROM.
>>  WERE YOU SURPRISED AT ALL BY
THIS TODAY?
HE TALKED ABOUT HE WAS GOING TO
BE ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN.
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK HE PREFERS
OFF THE CUFF.
AND YOU CAN GET GOOD STUFF FROM
HIM, AT LEAST INTERESTING STUFF.
>>  HE LIKES TO SURPRISE PEOPLE
AND REPORTERS.
HE DOES COME AND TALK TO
REPORTERS OFTEN, WHETHER IT'S
WHAT HE DID TODAY, WHICH WAS
UNUSUAL FOR SURE, OR WHEN ON HIS
WAY TO THE HELICOPTER.
WE GET CHANCE TO ASK HIM
QUESTIONS.
>>  THE SHOUTED QUESTION WITH
HIM USUALLY PAYS OFF, EVEN AS
THE HANDLERS ARE SAYING, "THAT'S
IT, GET OUT."
