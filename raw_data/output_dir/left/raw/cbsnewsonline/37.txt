WE CAN SEE THE HAND OF THE I O

WE WILL HOLD IRAN RESPONSIBLE

17
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:49,249
FOR ANYTHING PERPETRATED BY THE

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:49,582
MILITIA.

19
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,717
THE LATEST DESTABILIZING ACTS

20
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:56,289
ARE ATTEMPTS TO PUSH BACK ON OUR

21
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,457
EFFORTS TO CONSTRAIN ITS

22
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:57,724
BEHAVIOR.

23
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,193
CLEARLY THEY SAY OUR CAMPAIGN AS

24
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:00,827
SERIOUS AND SUCCEEDING.

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,428
WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THEM TO

26
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,765
CONTINUE THEIR ATTEMPTS TO HIT

27
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,168

SANCTIONS ARE REIMPOSED ON THE

29
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,303
4TH OF NOVEMBER.

30
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,538
THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE

31
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,207
TO STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ

32
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,810
AS THEY CHART A FUTURE BASED ON

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,747
IRAQI INTEREST, NOT THOSE

34
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,981
DICTATED BY IRAN.

35
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,984
WE ARE SUPPORTING THE DELIVERY

36
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:31,291
OF CLEAN WATER TO THE 750,000

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:31,857
RESIDENTS IN BASRA.

38
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,227
NOW LET ME TURN TO THE RULING OF

39
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:34,494

40
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,764
I'M ANNOUNCING THAT THE UNITED

41
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:43,002
STATES IS TERMINATING THE 1955

42
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,370
TREATY OF AMNITY WITH IRAN.

43
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,473
THIS IS A DECISION THAT IS 39

44
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,310
YEARS OVER DUE.

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,013
IN IRAN, THEY BROUGHT A CASE

46
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,350
ALLEGING INJUSTICE OF THE

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,583
TROETY.

48
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,520
THEY SEEK TO CHALLENGE UNITED

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,892
STATES' DECISION TO NOT BE A

50
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,859
PART OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL.

51
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,397
THEY HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE

52
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,901
ACTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TO

53
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,401
PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.

54
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,938
THEIR CASE AS YOU CAN SEE FROM

55
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,706
THE DECISION LACKED MERIT.

56
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,275
GIVEN IRAN'S HISTORY OF

57
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,443
TERRORISM, BALLISTIC MISSILE

58
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,146
BEHAVIOR, THE CHAMZ UNDER THE

59
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:27,546
TREATY ARE ABSURD.

60
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,949
THE COURT'S RULING TODAY WAS A

61
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:30,817
DEFEAT FOR IRAN.

62
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,787
IT RIGHTLY REJECTED ALL OF

63
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,488
IRAN'S BASELESS REQUESTS.

64
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,523
THE COURT DENOID THEIR MEASURES

65
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:40,460
TO INTERFERE WITH U.S. SANCTINS

66
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,762
AND RIGHTLY NOTED THE NONE

67
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,431
COMPLIANCE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS

68
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,268

69
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,435
NONPROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR

00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:49,668
WEAPONS.

71
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,570
WITH REGARD TO THE COURT'S

72
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,740
OUTDOOR ON HUMANITARIAN ISSUES,

73
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,374
WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR.

74
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:58,011
EXISTING EXCEPTIONS AND

75
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,778
LICENSING POLICIES FOR

76
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,780
HUMANITARIAN TRANSACTIONS AND

77
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,415
SAFETY OF LIFE WILL REMAIN IN

78
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:02,882
EFFECT.

79
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,284
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN

80
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:08,955
ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON ISSUES

81
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,324
WITHOUT WITH REGARD TO ANY

82
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:11,991

83
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,293
WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

84
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,230
DEPARTMENT OF TREASUREY TO MAKE

85
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,865
SURE THAT THE ACTIONS INVOLVING

86
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,799
IRAN CAN AND WILL CONTINUE.

87
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:21,934
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE

88
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:24,737
COURT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IT HAS

89
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,472
NO JURISDICTION TO ISSUE ANY

90
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,074
ORDER RELATING TO THE SANCTION

91
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,510
MEASURES WITH THE UNITED STATES

92
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,745
WHICH IS DOING ITS WORK ON IRAN

93
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:38,451
TO PROTECT ITS OWN ESSENTIAL

94
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:38,884
SECURITY INTERESTS.

95
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:41,721
IN LIGHT OF HOW THE ACJ HAS BEEN

96
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,455
ABUSED AS A FORM OF ATTACKING

97
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,957
THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED

I HOPE THE LEADERS WILL

101
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,298
RECOGNIZE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO

102
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,902
SECURE A BRIGHT FUTURE IS TO

103
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,037
CEASE THE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND

104
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,573

108
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,249
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT

00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:13,966
ENORMOUS OPERATIONS KEEPING OUR

192
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,769
PEOPLE SAFE AROUND THE WORLD DO

193
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,673
NOT HAVE A SENIOR LEADER.

194
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,408
THEY ARE REAL, DIRECT IMPACTS OF

195
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,377
OF NOT HAVING THE PEOPLE

196
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:24,677
CONFIRMED.

197
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,779
I IMPLORE THE UNITED STATES

198
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,880
SENATE TO TAKE THE QUALITY

199
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,915
TALENTED PEOPLE AND ALLOW THEM

200
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,716
TO DO WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE

201
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,786
AGREED TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE

202
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,119
UNITED STATES.

203
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:40,960
WITH THAT, I AM HAPPY TO TAKE

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,327
SOME QUESTIONS.

205
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:41,727
>> THANK YOU.

206
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,062
MR. SECRETARY, DOES THE RULING

207
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,767
OF THE COURT HAVE ANY PRACTICAL

208
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:51,370
IMPACT ON WHAT THE U.S. -- ON

209
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,639
U.S. SANCTIONS?

210
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,640
AND NUMBER TWO, WHAT ASSURANCES

211
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,979
CAN YOU GIVE THAT THIS WILL NOT

212
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,746
IMPACT ANY HUMANITARIAN AID?

213
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:06,585
BEFORE YOU SAID IT WAS NOT

214
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:14,393
ENOUGH, THAT THE U.S. ASSURANCES

215
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,294
WERE NOT ADEQUATE?

216
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,232
>> WE WILL MAKE SURE WE ARE

217
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:19,799
PROVIDING HAD HUMANITARIAN

218
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,034
ASSISTANCE THAT DELIVERS FOR THE

219
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,936
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT.

220
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,404
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE WE CARE

221
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,073
ABOUT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO

222
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,241
AFFORD THE FLEXIBILITY SO THE

223
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,810
ASSISTANCE CAN BE NEEDED.

224
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,044
HAVING SAID THAT THE CHOICES

225
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,780
THAT ARE BEING MADE INSIDE OF

226
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,416
IRAN TODAY TO USE MONEY TO HAVE

227
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,652
TERROR AROUND THE WORLD TO

228
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:45,524
LAUNCH, MISSILES AT AIRPORTS

229
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,892
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST,

230
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:50,496
THOSE ARE DOLLARS THAT THE

231
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,998
IRANIAN LEADERSHIP IS

232
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,900
SQUANDERING.

233
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,602
THEY COULD BE PROVIDING

234
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,703
HUMANITARIAN ASESTANCE TO THEIR

235
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,573
OWN PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE CHOOSING

236
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,507
ANOTHER PATH OF REVOLUTIONARY

237
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,542
EFFORT AROUND THE WORLD SHOWING

238
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,779
NO REGARD FOR THE NEEDS OF THEIR

239
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,513
OWN PEOPLE.

240
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:15,454
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT NORTH

241
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:15,921
KOREA, MR. SECRETARY.

242
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:21,127
THEY HAVETHE END OF WAR

243
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:21,527
DECLARATION, WILL

244
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,029
IT BE RESOLVED THIS WEEKEND AND

245
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,765
IF NOT, WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON

246
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,265
AGAINST OFFERING THIS?

247
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,534
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON

248
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,069
THE PROGRESS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS

249
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:35,541
ON THE END OF WAR DECLARATION

250
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,811
ONLY THAT THEY ARE HAPPY TO GO

251
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,845
BACK AND GET THE COMMITMENT BACK

252
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,113
THAT KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT

253
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:46,652
TRUMP MADE IN THE SECOND WEEK OF

254
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:46,885
JUNE.

255
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,320
I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL COME

256
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,489
AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF

257
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,724
DEEPER PROGRESS AND A PLAN

258
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,059
FORWARD NOT ONLY FOR A SUMMIT

259
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,593
BETWEEN THE LEADERS BUT FOR US

260
00:09:54,593 --> 00:10:02,034
TO CONTINUE THE EFFORTS TO BUILD

261
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,102
OUT A PATHWAY FOR

262
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,502
DENUCLEARIZATION.

263
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,440
>> RUSHSIA HAS DELIVERED 300

264
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,906
SYSTEMS TO SYRIA.

265
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:10,976
YOU SAID IN THE PAST THAT IT IS

266
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:11,911
A SERIOUS ESCALATION.

267
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,946
ARE YOU PLANNING TO TAKE ANY

268
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,514
MEASURES WITH THIS REGARD?

269
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,850
AND MY SECOND QUESTION ON IRAQ,

270
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,286
ANY COMMENT ON THE ELECTION OF

271
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,088
THE PRESIDENT AND THE

272
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:22,955
DESIGNATION OF THE PRIME

273
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,222
MINISTER?

274
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,857
>> I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK

275
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,525
WITH THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE

276
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,426
HOUSE AND THE NEW PRESIDENT.

277
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,530
I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK

278
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,865
WITH THE PRESIDENT DESIGNEE.

279
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,334
I HOPE TO DO SO.

280
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,103
I AM EQUALLY HOPEFUL THAT THEY

281
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,671
WILL FALL THROUGH ON THE

282
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,439
COMMITMENTS THEY MADE WHEN WE

283
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:40,840
SPOKE.

284
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,742
THESE ARE PEOPLE WE KNOW PRETTY

285
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:42,942
WELL.

286
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,411
THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND THE IRAQI

287
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,778
GOVERNMENT SCENE FOR SOME TIME.

288
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,714
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT

289
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,984
BUILDING OUT ON IRAQI GOVERNMENT

290
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,286
THAT WAS AN IRAQI GOVERNMENT OF

291
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,055
NATIONAL UNITY THAT WAS

292
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,723
INTERESTED IN THE FUTURE GOOD

293
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:02,028
FORTUNES OF THE PEOPLE, NOT

294
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,499
CONTROLLED BY THE ISLAMIC

295
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,266
REPUBLIC OF IRAN.

296
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:11,537
I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN SPEAK

297
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:12,337
WITH THE PEOPLE.

298
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:14,607
YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS ABOUT

299
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,778
THE S300, I WILL NOT COMMENT ON

300
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,447
OUR INTENTION ON HOW WE WILL

301
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,047
ADDRESS THAT.

302
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,250
MY COMMENTS BEFORE WERE TRUE,

303
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,951
HAVING RUSSIANS DELIVER THE S300

304
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:26,985
INTO SYRIA PRESENTS A GREATER

305
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,455
RISK TO ALL OF THOSE IN THE AREA

306
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,324
AND TO STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE

307
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,559
EAST.

308
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,696
WE CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS

309
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:37,963
ESCALADE.

310
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,499
>> QUESTION, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO

311
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:45,504
US A LITTLE BIT THE PRACTICAL

312
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,940
REALITY OF THE U.S. TERMINATING

313
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,376
THE AMNITY WITH IRAN AND HOW

314
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,043
THAT WILL PLAY OUT?

315
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,378
AND SECONDLY, BECAUSE WE ARE

316
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,113
GOING TO NORTH KOREA, IS THERE

317
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,684
ANY TIME FRAME FOR WHAT THE U.S.

318
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,286
WANTS TO ACHIEVE GIVEN THAT LAST

319
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,420
WEEK WE HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP

320
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,955
SAY THE U.S. IS NOT PLAYING A

321
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:07,726
TIME GAME BUT YOU SAID THAT YOU

322
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,462
WANT RAPID DENUCLEARIZATION OF

323
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:13,399
NORTH KOREA COMPLETED BY JANUARY

324
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,233
2021.

325
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,601
>> THEY ARE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT

326
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,069
WITH EACH OTHER.

327
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,639
WE WANT IT FAST BUT WE WILL NOT

328
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,306
PLAY IT TIME GAME.

329
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,374
THAT COMMENT WAS NOT MINE.

330
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:27,613
THAT WAS THE LEADERS WHO HAD HAD

331
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,715
THE SUMMIT IN PYONGYANG.

332
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,684
I WAS SIMPLY REITERATING THIS AS

333
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,921
A TIMELINE THAT THEY WERE

334
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,189
POTENTIALLY PREPARED TO AGREE

335
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:37,423
TO.

336
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,958
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS ARE

337
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,525
RIGHT.

338
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,594
THIS IS A LONGTERM PROBLEM.

339
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,231
THIS HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR

340
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:45,564
DECADES.

341
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,933
WE HAVE MADE MORE PROGRESS THAN

342
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,735
HAS BEEN MADE IN AN AWFULLY LONG

343
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:49,935
TIME.

344
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,871
AND WE HAVE DONE SO IN A

345
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,205
CONDITION WHICH CONTINUES TO

346
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,406
GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

347
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,275
ACHIEVE THE FINAL GOAL, THAT IS

348
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,311
THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS CONTINUE

349
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,679
TO REMAIN IN PLACE.

350
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,647
THE CORE PROPOSITION, THE THING

351
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,584
THAT WILL GIVE US THE CAPACITY

352
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,752
TO DELIVER DENUCLEARIZATION IS

353
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,085
NOT CHANGING.

354
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:15,661
IF YOU HEARD THE COMMENTS AT THE

355
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,897
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL, COMPLETE

356
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,300
UNIENIMITY FOR THOSE TO STAY IN

357
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,500
PLACE.

358
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,335
THERE COULD BE A TIME TO REDUCE

359
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,038
THEM BUT THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF

360
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,640
MAINTAINING THE SECURITY COUNSEL

361
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,708
RESOLUTIONS AND THE SANCTIONS

362
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,642
THAT UNDERLAY THEM.

363
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,778
THAT IS A GLOBAL COMMITMENT THAT

364
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,380
I'M NOT SURE THERE ARE MANY

365
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:43,589
ISSUES THAT YOU CAN FIND HAD THE

366
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,559
UNIMTY ON THAT.

367
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,331
>> AND THE PRACTICAL FALL OUT OF

368
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,365
WITHDRAWING THE TREATY?

369
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,199
>> I DON'T SO ANY.

370
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,069
WE OUGHT TO HAVE PULLED OUT OF

371
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,103
IT DECADES AGO.

372
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,738
THE IRANIANS HAVE NOT BEEN

373
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,573
COMPLYING FOR YEARS.

374
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,942
IT WAS A DECISION MADE THIS

375
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,110
MORNING FROM THE ICG THAT MARKED

376
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:11,050
A USEFUL POINT FOR US TO

377
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,017
DEMONSTRATE THE UBSURDITY OF THE

378
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:20,492
TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES

379
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:20,759
AND IRAN.

380
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,192
>> THANKS, EVERYONE.

381
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,194
>> ALL RIGHT.

382
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,463
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO

383
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,099
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

384
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,634
DELIVERING REMARKS THERE IN

385
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,002
FRONT OF THE PRESS.

386
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,737
THE NEWS IS THAT THE SECRETARY

387
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,506
HAS DECIDED TO REMOVE THE UNITED

388
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,542
STATES FROM A TREATY BETWEEN THE

389
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:44,016
UNITED STATES AND IRAN DATING

390
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,651
BACK TO 1955.

391
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:50,789
IT IS THE AMTY TREATY.

392
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:56,695
POMPEO SAID THAT IRAN HAS

393
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:01,065
CONTINUED TO VIOLATE THE TREATY

394
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,033
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

395
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:02,700
THE SECRETARY SAYING THEY ARE

396
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,104
REMOVING THE UNITED STATES FROM

397
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:05,370
THE DEAL.

398
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,740
ALSO GETTING QUESTIONS THERE

399
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,741
ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

400
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,875
THERE IS STILL OUTSTANDING

401
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,944
DETAILS TO BE WORKED OUT

402
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,213
INCLUDING THE MOST IMPORTANT

403
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,080
DETAIL, THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

404
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,320
NORTH KOREA N. THAT SEEMS TO BE

405
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,553
STALLED.

406
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,588
AT ONE POINT, WE ASKED A

407
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,525
QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THERE IS

408
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,726
A TIMELINE OUT THERE THAT

409
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,495
SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE IN 2021

410
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,632
BUT THE SECRETARY SAYS HE WANTS

411
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:34,732
IT TO HAPPEN QUICKLY.

412
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,035
POMPEO SAID YES QUICKLY BUT THAT

413
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,936
WAS THE TIME LINE ESTABLISHED BY

414
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,906
THE NORTH KOREAN AND SOUTH

415
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,641
KOREAN LEADERS AND HE JUST

416
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:46,111
REITERATED HE WANTED THAT AS

417
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,344
WELL.

418
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,413
A FAIRLY ROUTINE PRESS

419
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,381
CONFERENCE THERE BUT HITTING ON

420
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,451
THE TWO KEY ISSUES THAT PEOPLE

421
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,985
CONTINUALLY HIT HIM ON.

422
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,256
WHAT HAPPENS WITH IRAN, IT STEPS

423
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:04,663
UP THE DLIJERANCE BETWEEN THE

424
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,099
TWO -- BELLIGERENCE BETWEEN THE

425
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:07,966
TWO COUNTRIES.

426
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,537
>> WE ARE STILL SEEING THE GAP

427
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,741
BETWEEN THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE

428
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,308
TWO COUNTRIES.

429
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,777
NORTH KOREA FEELS IT IS MOVING

430
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,548
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THE

431
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,882
DISMANTLING OF SOME NUCLEAR

432
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,349
FORCES.

433
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,685
AND I THINK THEY THOUGHT THEY

434
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,254
WOULD SEE SOME SANCTIONS LIFTED.

435
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,723
AND RECENTLY THEY VOICED THEIR

436
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,024
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE U.S. HAS

437
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,626
NOT MOVED IN THEIR FAVOR CALLING

438
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,727
THE U.S. A BULLY.

439
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,030
PERHAPS IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT

440
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,733
POMPEO IS SCHEDULED TO RETURN TO

441
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,767
NORTH KOREA AND RESUME TALKS.

442
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,703
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TALK A FEW

443
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,405
WEEKS AGO AND THE PRESIDENT

444
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,306
PULLED HIM BACK.

445
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,108
PERHAPS THIS IS AN INDICATION

446
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,174
THAT THINGS ARE MOVING FORWARD.

447
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,945
>> I THINK THERE IS A WORRY THAT

448
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,313
PERHAPS THIS TRIP THAT POMPEO

449
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,316
WILL BE TAKING SOON TO NORTH

450
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:02,221
KOREA IS GOING TO BE DELAYED

451
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:02,421
AGAIN.

452
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,021
AND CLEARLY NOT THE CASE.

453
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:06,523
HE WILL TRAVEL THERE ON FRIDAY.

454
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:07,693
OUR ERROL BARNETT IS THERE AND

455
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,828
WE ARE TRYING TO GET HIM IN

456
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,128
FRONT OF A CAMERA TO BREAK DOWN

457
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,332
SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN

458
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:13,699
TALKING ABOUT.

459
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,300
>> I THINK THIS TREATY IS REALLY

460
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,601
INTERESTING.

461
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:20,739
I THINK IT INDICATES A NEW LINE

462
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,108
OF FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD,

463
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:24,342
ATTACK.

464
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,778
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT FROM

465
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:27,945
THE SECRETARY OF STATE

466
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:29,314
ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE IN IRAN

467
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,350
THAT IF THEY ARE UPSET ABOUT THE

468
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,051
ECONOMY BECAUSE IT IS FALLING

469
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,920
APART, THEY SHOULD BLAME THEIR

470
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,353
OWN LEADERS.

471
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:39,324
THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BEEN

472
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,826
ENCOURAGING IF YOU WANT

473
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,460
INSTABILITY WITHIN IRAN.

474
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,096
THAT HAS BEEN THE FOLKS AFTER

475
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,631
PULLING OUT OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL.

476
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,866
NOW WE SEE THIS.

477
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,101
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING HOW

478
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,204
THE U.S. IS TURNING UP THE HEAT.

479
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,140
THEY ARE PUTTING PRESSURE ON --

480
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,974
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

481
00:17:55,974 --> 00:18:01,613
MAYBE PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE

482
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,513
OTHER SITUATION ISN'T WORKING.

483
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,750
PERHAPS WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS A

484
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,818
PIVOT, PERHAPS WE WILL TRY

485
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:07,319
SOMETHING ELSE.

486
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,221
>> AND WE ARE IN A NEW PARADIGM.

487
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:12,224
THE UNITED STATES IS NO LONGER

488
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,725
CONSIDERED, BECAUSE OF THE

489
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,594
THINGS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID,

490
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,197
HE WANTS HIS ADMINISTRATION TO

491
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,667
BE MORE INWARDLY FOCUSED, IT IS

492
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,170
A SOVEREIGN NATION AND OTHER

493
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,738
NATIONS SHOULD FEEL FREE TO DO

494
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,207
THE SAME, IT STRIKES ME THAT

495
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,775
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA ARE

496
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,211
MOUFBING AHEAD WITH THE PLANS

497
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,044
THEY HAVE IN PLACE.

498
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:36,515
CHINA HAS BEEN A PLAYER IN THE

499
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,516
DISCUSSIONS AS WELL.

500
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:42,254
IT SEEMS WHAT IS HAPPENING IS

501
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,756
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT MADE THE

502
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,858
EARTH TRANSFORMING DECISION TO

503
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,493
MEET WITH A NORTH KOREAN

504
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,129
DICTATOR, THAT WAS HUGE AND A

505
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,764
BIG WIN FOR THE TRUMP

506
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:53,532
ADMINISTRATION.

507
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,466
HAVING DONE THAT, NOW NORTH

508
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,034
KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA ARE MOVING

509
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,103
ALONG WITH WHATEVER TIMELINE

510
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,506
THEY HAVE IN MIND.

511
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,442
I SUSPECT FOR THE LEADER OF

512
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,310
SOUTH KOREA, HE IS IN TUNE TO

513
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,478
WHAT THE UNITED STATES IS DOING

514
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,914
AND WANTS THE UNITED STATES AS A

515
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,682
PARTNER BUT IS ESTABLISHING

516
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,386
RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS NORTH

517
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,088
KOREAN COUNTERPART THAT MAY IN

518
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,489
ESSENCE ECLIPSE WHAT WE DECIDE

519
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:17,755
TO DO.

520
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:22,594
>> THAT IS THE FALL OUT OF AN

521
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,429
AMERICAN FIRST FOREIGN STRATEGY.

522
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,531
WHEN AMERICA PULLS BACK, OTHER

523
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,667
COUNTRIES WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH

524
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,872
THEIR OWN AGENDAS AS THE

525
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,440
PRESIDENT IS SUGGESTING.

526
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,376
THE OTHER SIGNETITARIES OF THE

527
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,679
IRAN DEAL, WILL THEY MOVE

528
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,648
FORWARD WITH WHAT THEY WANT?

529
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,150
WE DO HAVE ERROL BARNETT IN

530
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,651
WASHINGTON COVERING THE MEETING

531
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:47,018
AND CONFERENCE.

532
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:48,020
ERROL, WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU

533
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,289
ABOUT WHAT THE SECRETARY HAD TO

534
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:50,889
SAY?

535
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:58,297
>> THE BIG NEWS OUT OF TODAY'S

536
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,966
PRESS CONFERENCE IS MIKE POMPEO

537
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,870
ANNOUNCED THE U.S. IS PULLING

538
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,773
OUT OF THE TREATY OF AMTY THAT

539
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,673
DATES BACK TO 1955.

540
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:13,178
IT WAS SIGNED UNDER THE

541
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:13,745
EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION.

542
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,514
EFFECTIVELY, IT WAS AN AGREEMENT

543
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:22,087
THAT ESTABLISHED A POSITIVE

544
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:22,988
RELATIONSHIP AND RECIPROCAL

545
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,388
TRADE.

546
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,058
THE U.S. WILL WITHDRAW FROM THAT

547
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,095
TROETY IN ADDITION TO ORDERING A

548
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,196
TEMPORARY EVACUATION OF THE

549
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,599
DIPLOMATIC STAFF IN SOUTHERN

550
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,370
IRAQ BECAUSE OF IRAN'S MALINE

551
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,205
ACTIVITY ACCORDING TO THE

552
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,373
SECRETARY OF STATE.

553
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,975
AND QUICKLY RELATED TO THE U.N.

554
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,711
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, IRAN HAS

555
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,880
COMPLAINED TO THE LEGAL BODY

556
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,550
THAT MEDIATES DISPUTES BETWEEN

557
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,386
MEMBER NATIONS THAT THE AMERICAN

558
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,721
IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS

559
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,856
VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER

560
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,089
ISSUES.

561
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,157
THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF

562
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:03,495
JUSTICE RULED THAT THE YOOUPS

563
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:09,501
SHOULD WITHDRAW ANY RESTRICTIONS

564
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,036
OF EXPORTING HUMANITARIAN TO

565
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:11,737

00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:55,480
LOCATIONS.

585
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,749
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

586
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,417

587
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:07,425
IT IS ONE OF THE MISSING

591
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,199
SAUDI ARABIA FOR DECADES.

00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:18,803
ACTIVISTS AND PROMINENT

594
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,572
BUSINESSMEN AND OTHERS IN THE

595
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,073
WAKE OF ITS REFORMS.

596
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,441
WE KNOW THAT THEY PERMITTED

597
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:26,011
WOMEN THE ABILITY TO DRIVE FOR

598
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,480

00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,982
THIS JOURNALIST WAS CRITICAL OF

601
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,415
THAT DECISION.

DETAINED UNDER THEIR RULE AS

608
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,231
WELL AS JOURNALISTS.

609
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,568
ACCORDING TO OUR PARTNERS AT THE

610
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:55,874
BBC, THE JOURNALIST WAS GOING TO

611
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,775
THE CONSULATE FOR ROUTINE

612
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,242
PAPERWORK.

613
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,844
HIS FIANCE WAS TOLD TO WAIT

614
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,077
OUTSIDE.

615
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,779
HE DID NOT HAVE HIS MOBILE PHONE

616
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,747
WITH HIM AND THAT WAS LATE

617
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:02,980
TUESDAY.

618
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,549
THERE HAS BEEN NO WORD FROM HIM

619
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,385
AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING

620
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,856
OFFICIALLY YET FROM SAUDI

621
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,389
ARABIAN OFFICIALS.

622
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,925
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT

623
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,328
SAID ANYTHING ON BEHALF OF HIM

624
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:16,561
YET.

625
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,596
THE WASHINGTON POST IS BEING

626
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,464
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW

627
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,701
BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL SO MANY

628
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,168
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

629
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,436
THAT IS A KEY PUBLICATION IN THE

630
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:26,204
U.S..

631
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:31,943
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT

632
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,577
HAPPENS.

633
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,080
IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 24 HOURS

634
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,019
SINCE HE WAS LAST SEEN IN ISTAN

635
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,888
BOULE.

636
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,956
>> I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

637
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,725
REPORT ON THIS AS WE HAVE SEEN

638
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:52,731
AN ATTACK ON JOURNALISTS IN THE

639
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,433
PAST SEVERAL YOURS -- YEARS.

640
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,668
WE THANK YOU, ERROL BARNETT.

641
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,237
>> IT IS NOT JUST THAT.

642
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,774
WHEN WE LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA,

643
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,577
THE CROWN PRINCE HAS BEEN MAKING

644
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,878
MOVES THAT LOOK LIKE LIBERAL

645
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,681
MOVES BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER,

646
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,382
HE IS STILL JAILING ACTIVISTS.

647
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:13,685
THERE WAS THE BIG FIGHT BETWEEN

648
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,822
CANADA AND SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE

649
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,991
THE FOREIGN MINISTER CRITICIZED

650
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:20,725
HIM FOR JAILING ACTIVISTS.

651
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,761
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THINGS

652
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,731
THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED ABOUT THE

653
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:26,964
KINGDOM.

654
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:30,335
>> IT IS A MONARCHY.

655
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,870
THE IDEA AND CONCEPT OF HUMAN

656
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,672
RIGHTS AND FREEDOM AND LIBERTY

657
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:38,109
IS NOT ONE THAT REALLY EXISTS

658
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,610
UNDER AN ABSOLUTE MONARCHY.

659
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,880
THEY CAN PUT IN REFORMS AND DO A

660
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,848
WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT

661
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:48,687
APPEAR TO SHOW A LOOSENING OF

662
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,721
RESTRICTIONS, THE REALITY IS

663
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,490
UNDER THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,

664
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,626
IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO WHOEVER

665
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,559
IS RULING THE COUNTRY.

666
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,862
>> RIGHT.

667
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,396
>> NOT PEOPLE AT THE BALLOT BOX.

668
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:02,601

669
00:25:02,601 --> 00:00:00,000
