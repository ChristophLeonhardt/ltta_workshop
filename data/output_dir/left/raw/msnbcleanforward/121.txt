00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,448
THAT WE HAVE HERE, THE FACT THAT THEY’RE CHANGING UP A LITTLE

118
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:03,518
THEY’RE CHANGING UP A LITTLE BIT, BEFORE THE RUSSIANS WENT SO

119
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,053
BIT, BEFORE THE RUSSIANS WENT SO HARD AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN

120
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:06,855
HARD AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN THE SPRING OF 2016 RIGHT THROUGH

121
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:08,023
THE SPRING OF 2016 RIGHT THROUGH THE ELECTION, THIS WAS THE TYPE

122
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,658
THE ELECTION, THIS WAS THE TYPE OF STUFF THAT THEY WERE STARTING

123
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,260
OF STUFF THAT THEY WERE STARTING TO DO, PICK ON HOT TOPIC ISSUES,

124
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:13,628
TO DO, PICK ON HOT TOPIC ISSUES, THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

125
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:14,762
THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DIVISIVE IN THE UNITED STATES,

126
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,431
DIVISIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND JUST START TO MESS WITH THE

127
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,933
AND JUST START TO MESS WITH THE WAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT THINGS TO

128
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,135
WAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT THINGS TO TRY TO INJECT DIFFERENT POINTS

129
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:22,170
TRY TO INJECT DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW, EXTREME POINTS OF VIEW

130
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:22,937
OF VIEW, EXTREME POINTS OF VIEW INTO THE DEBATE.

131
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,239
INTO THE DEBATE. AT SOME POINT THEY MADE THE

132
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,573
AT SOME POINT THEY MADE THE TURN.

133
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,841
TURN. ALL THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES

134
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,576
ALL THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES CAME AROUND TO THE FACT THAT THE

135
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:28,276
CAME AROUND TO THE FACT THAT THE EFFORTS WERE TO HELP DONALD

136
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:29,144
EFFORTS WERE TO HELP DONALD TRUMP WITH THE ELECTION.

137
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:31,379
TRUMP WITH THE ELECTION. BUT RIGHT NOW WE’RE SEEING THEM

138
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:32,180
BUT RIGHT NOW WE’RE SEEING THEM MAKE THAT SHIFT BACK TO SOME OF

139
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:33,248
MAKE THAT SHIFT BACK TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE

140
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,182
THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE STARTING TO DO BEFORE, WHICH IS

141
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:36,051
STARTING TO DO BEFORE, WHICH IS TO PICK ON THESE ISSUES AND TO

142
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,052
TO PICK ON THESE ISSUES AND TO PUT INFORMATION OUT ON SOCIAL

143
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,453
PUT INFORMATION OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT GETS PEOPLE TALKING

144
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,288
MEDIA THAT GETS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT, GETS PEOPLE SHARING

145
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:41,723
ABOUT IT, GETS PEOPLE SHARING IT, AND IN THE PAST WE HAD

146
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:42,991
IT, AND IN THE PAST WE HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW LOW COST THIS

147
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:43,492
TALKED ABOUT HOW LOW COST THIS WAS, CHRIS.

148
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,394
WAS, CHRIS. TODAY WE’RE SEEING ACCORDING TO

149
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:48,463
TODAY WE’RE SEEING ACCORDING TO THIS CRIMINAL COMPLAINT THAT IN

150
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,864
THIS CRIMINAL COMPLAINT THAT IN 2016, JUST THIS COMPANY, AND

151
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:50,966
2016, JUST THIS COMPANY, AND REMEMBER, THEY WERE KIND OF ONE

152
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,901
REMEMBER, THEY WERE KIND OF ONE PART OF WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE

153
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,971
PART OF WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING, THAT THEY WERE EXPENSING

154
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:58,207
DOING, THAT THEY WERE EXPENSING $12 MILLION IN I.T. AND IN

155
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,508
$12 MILLION IN I.T. AND IN ONLINE ADVERTISING THEY WERE

156
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,943
ONLINE ADVERTISING THEY WERE DOING THROUGH THE SOCIAL MEDIA

157
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:01,310
DOING THROUGH THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES.

158
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,645
WEBSITES. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY

159
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,779
I THINK THIS IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

160
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,813
SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL COMPLAINT THAT’S BEEN UNSEALED TODAY THAT

161
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,515
THAT’S BEEN UNSEALED TODAY THAT WE’RE LOOKING AT ON SCREEN.

162
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,050
WE’RE LOOKING AT ON SCREEN. AND I THINK IT’S SOMETHING THAT

163
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:09,118
AND I THINK IT’S SOMETHING THAT REALLY DESERVES OUR ATTENTION TO

164
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,386
REALLY DESERVES OUR ATTENTION TO KNOW THAT THEY’RE STILL DOING

165
