investigate themselves and the you know

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,429
the inspector general I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what's</font>

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,620
important to note here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the CIA's</font>

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,889
own inspector<font color="#E5E5E5"> general said hey this was</font>

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,520
sort of deals more with just sort of

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,829
process and you know the story behind

23
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,110
the story and so I'm just sort of

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,040
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in how you even learned that</font>

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,229
these documents existed in the first

26
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:15,700
place how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this store and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort</font>

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you know what was the thread that led</font>

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,369
to the unraveling of sure what resulted

29
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,990
in such a lengthy and you know a serious

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,080
man one piece of journalism yeah it's

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,510
definitely a lengthy story so thank you

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,530
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking the time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,549
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know that's a great</font>

34
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,440
question last year last<font color="#CCCCCC"> March in 2014</font>

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Senator Dianne Feinstein</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave an</font>

36
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,360
extraordinary floor speech on this on

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,600
the Senate floor she said that the CIA

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,420
had spied on the Senate the Senate

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,520
Intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> Committee which she is the</font>

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,939
chairwoman of while their staffers while

41
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,460
the committee staffers were conducting a

42
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,229
review and writing a report about the

43
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,470
CIA's torture program she talked about

44
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,970
how the this this spying violated an

45
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,008
agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the Senate Intelligence</font>

46
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Committee entered into in 2009 with the</font>

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,480
CIA that would allow them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to access</font>

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,730
millions of pages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of CIA documents about</font>

49
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,790
the torture program she rattled off a

50
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,900
number of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of different letters</font>

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,720
dates and various agreements after she

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,670
gave that speech it was obviously I

53
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,920
wanted to learn more about what was

54
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,290
happening but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult to</font>

55
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,180
get anyone to discuss it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> record</font>

56
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,579
the next best thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to try to</font>

57
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,090
get the documents if any existed to see

58
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,250
if we can you know learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about what</font>

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,260
was taking place behind the scenes so

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,260
along with a doctoral student over at

61
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,780
MIT named Ryan Shapiro who I've done a

62
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,290
number of Freedom of Information Act

63
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,010
lawsuits with we together filed a

64
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,019
Freedom of Information Act request with

65
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,769
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA asking for any and all records</font>

66
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,700
that they have about the spying about

67
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,889
what was you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> dianne feinstein</font>

68
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:15,409
had discussed any emails letters you

69
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,150
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what took place behind the</font>

70
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,290
scenes between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Senate Intelligence</font>

71
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Committee in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CIA that would shed</font>

72
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,329
light on this so we filed that request

73
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,769
it pretty aware that the CIA would not

74
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,790
respond in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeframe that they</font>

75
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,560
should so we moved to file a lawsuit and

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,030
about a year it took a year to actually

77
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">get these records and just about a month</font>

78
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,389
ago we you know we we obtained hundreds

79
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,989
of pages of documents and these

80
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,139
documents do lend credibility and

81
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,659
significant way to everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diane</font>

82
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,199
Feinstein and many other members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

83
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,250
Intelligence Committee had said about

84
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,859
what you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the CIA did it</font>

85
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,290
undercuts the CIA's own narrative about

86
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,560
it so you know this story it's a story

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,280
that is heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on documents and</font>

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,829
you know one of the difficult things was

89
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,959
to actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a narrative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,729
was challenging i should say very

91
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,290
challenging to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a narrative</font>

92
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,668
based on on documents but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would not</font>

93
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obtain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

94
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,909
information if it wasn't for the fact

95
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:28,190
that you know that that we obtain these

96
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,930
records interesting thank you thank you

97
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,680
at and then so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh my other question it</font>

98
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,759
just sort of has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with sort of the</font>

99
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">implications in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fallout of these</font>

100
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:47,450
disclosures and the this you know this

101
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know persuasive corroborating</font>

102
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,980
evidence

103
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,770
to what um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Feinstein had said</font>

104
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">right had occurred and um you know I it</font>

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,390
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you nothing is going to</font>

106
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,520
change that you know like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know John</font>

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,210
Brennan like you know ii-if if he didn't

108
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,610
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know perjure himself before Congress</font>

109
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,190
like he came you know awfully awfully

110
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,860
darn close and I mean just like

111
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,780
comparatively um you know he still has

112
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,840
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> job he still is you know a very very</font>

113
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,110
powerful person in you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font>

114
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the executive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> branch and like you</font>

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
just compare that to the likes of you

116
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,070
know Barry Bonds who you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

117
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,910
avoided prison for pouring himself

118
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,980
offensively in Congress because you know

119
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,380
his case got thrown out on appeal and so

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,350
it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just interested in</font>

121
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,690
any perspective you have on what sort of

122
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">fallout implications what you know</font>

123
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,780
whether anything will happen to Brennan

124
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,640
given sort of you know what these

125
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,550
revelations show just about this you

126
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,340
know culture of a disrespect between the

127
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,860
branches<font color="#E5E5E5"> of government yeah again that's</font>

128
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,300
a you know that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

129
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm glad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you noted that the fact is</font>

130
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,760
is that there is there has not been any

131
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,320
accountability for these actions in fact

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,150
senator dianne feinstein when you know

133
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,390
she weighed in on this story and on

134
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,520
these documents and what they reveal you

135
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,200
know she noted as well that that there

136
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,970
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a lack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of accountability she's</font>

137
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,690
disappointed that the CIA has<font color="#CCCCCC"> not held</font>

138
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,990
anyone accountable for the actions or

139
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,380
the actions of its officers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

140
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,740
officers who were involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the with</font>

141
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the intrusion into senate computers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

142
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,480
mean the reality is is that no there

143
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,840
will not be you know accountability<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

144
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,700
don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that you know that</font>

145
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,830
that will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think Brennan is</font>

146
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,490
certain certainly safe in his position

147
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">President Obama had expressed support</font>

148
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,129
for John Brennan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know</font>

149
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,409
but other members<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Congress are still</font>

150
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,029
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expecting you know a written</font>

151
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,789
apology or an apology of some sort I

152
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,369
mean the relationship between the CIA

153
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,319
and certain members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Intelligence</font>

154
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,269
Committee is still somewhat chilled as a

155
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,039
result of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a couple of</font>

156
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,769
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago Senator Ron Wyden you know</font>

157
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,219
wrote to John Brennan and said you still

158
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:31,379
owe an apology for the spying and in

159
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,330
hacking of Senate computers you know

160
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,669
Brennan has has not responded yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

161
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,309
you know senator right why didn't wanted

162
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,550
Brennan to a promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this would</font>

163
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,860
never happen again so right now what all

164
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have is just an exchange of letters</font>

165
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,929
despite<font color="#CCCCCC"> that however it's still really</font>

166
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,059
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the public record you know</font>

167
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:56,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> historical record to have this</font>

168
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,329
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately you know the</font>

169
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,099
Justice Department was involved the

170
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,599
Justice Department took a look at this

171
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,539
the we have a letter from the Justice

172
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,789
Department where they decline to you

173
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,919
know to prosecute then they said there

174
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,519
was insufficient evidence so you know

175
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,979
the the the form of accountability that

176
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,559
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in comparison to</font>

177
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,839
sort of some more high-profile figures

178
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,939
like Perry bonds that's uh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

179
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,259
not going to happen I mean that that's

180
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not something you will see okay</font>

181

thank you thank you appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if</font>

Peter thank you for coming on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

183
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,229
we've got a couple more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in skype</font>

184
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,448
but for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at this</font>

185
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,880
tweet that we got from Joseph Cox wants

186
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know I'm when you appeal a FOIA</font>

187
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,279
request that's been denied what

188
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,750
strategies<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you use to convince the</font>

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,180
agency to release documents are

190
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,880
reconsider the request is there some

191
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,130
grand strategy or what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you</font>

192

know that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are great questions with</font>

193
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,050
regard to appeals of foyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font>

194
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,860
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is this belief</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

195
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,269
have to put together some sort of legal

196
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,930
argument that's not the case generally

197
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I do in my appeals is I try when I</font>

198
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,980
file appeals is I try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case for</font>

199
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,130
why the records are in the public

200
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest why these records</font>

201
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,600
be released there are certain instances

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
when I appeal to the FBI and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

203
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I appeal all of the</font>

204
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,910
withholdings period or I appeal the

205
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,670
integrity of the search go back and

206
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,120
search again but in some of the more

207
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,060
high-profile FOIA requests that I file

208
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least at the appeal stage you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

209
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">really go out of my way to try and</font>

210
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,440
demonstrate why these records should be

211
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,670
released and I think that's you know

212
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,780
that that's important it's it's proven

213
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be beneficial it's resulted in the</font>

214
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,470
release of<font color="#CCCCCC"> records so in doing so it may</font>

215
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,630
mean doing a google search trying to

216
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,230
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the information that may</font>

217
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,230
already be out there to show that this

218
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,210
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm seeking or the</font>

219
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,970
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm seeking no longer to</font>

220
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,790
a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remain secret all right well</font>

221
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks for the question just if I hope</font>

222
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a good answer for you Thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> having me on the line thanks</font>

228
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,740
for being here what's your question I

229
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,260
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to this issue of an</font>

230
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">apology to me that seems like kind of</font>

231
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,570
just a slap on the wrist frankly for

232
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is kind of a gross violation of the</font>

233
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,640
system of checks and balances is just ok

234
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,860
we want an apology or in a promise but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

235
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,650
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if you haven't any ideas</font>

236
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,990
about what actions Brennan or the CIA as

237
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,570
a whole could take to restore the

238
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,490
relationship not just with the Senate

239
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,590
but with the American public and to um

240
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,020
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit more persuasive</font>

241
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,360
and saying that this will not happen

242
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,160
again or this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even happening right</font>

243
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,650
now sure that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question i think</font>

244
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> american public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's far</font>

245
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,460
more complex issue and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the CIA</font>

246
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,360
is involved in all sorts of covert

247
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,260
activities intelligence activities and

248
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,500
and the public certainly looks is very

249
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,770
skeptical of anything that the CIA says

250
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,480
yes certainly even<font color="#E5E5E5"> an apology you know</font>

251
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,480
does it does it carry any weight so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,570
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the CIA can restore trust</font>

253
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,450
with the public is is just difficult and

254
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,670
perhaps you know part of a larger

255
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,440
discussion you know with regard to the

256
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,270
apology that the Senate wanted from the

257
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,220
CIA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know as you read the</font>

258
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,740
story John Brennan actually wrote an

259
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,840
apology letter there was a draft apology

260
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,970
letter in there that the CIA mistakenly

261
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,330
turned over to us here advice news and

262
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,970
then you know requested that we refrain

263
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,400
from from posting this which we

264
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,390
obviously declined to do but the you

265
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,710
know the letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apology was certainly</font>

266
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,130
important for senators and I understand

267
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">why because it's something that they</font>

268
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,060
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have on the record you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

269
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,010
was part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the record you know here's</font>

270
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,310
an official apology and it meant

271
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,960
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you know there was the</font>

272
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,610
part of it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit personal</font>

273
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,020
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CIA had referred some Senate</font>

274
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,200
staffers for prosecution based on the

275
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,790
fact that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> claimed that the you know</font>

276
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,980
that that Senate staffers exploited a

277
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,830
loophole or a tool on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computer</font>

278
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,990
network that allowed them to gain access

279
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,090
to documents that they weren't allowed

280
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,210
to see it turned out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was you</font>

281
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that the information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that was</font>

282
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,830
baseball was completely inaccurate so

283
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,230
there was no accountability for that at

284
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,880
all and you know the CIA is obviously

285
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,040
they took steps to investigate

286
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,650
themselves and the you know the

287
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,030
inspector general I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

288
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,310
important to note here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the CIA's</font>

289
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,490
own inspector general said hey this was

290
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,050
wrong and that's what John what

291
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,850
Brendan's apology letter was<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

292
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,620
was wrong they the CIA officers and and

293
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,170
tech employees should not have done this

294
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,890
they violated an agreement and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> John</font>

295
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brennan should figure out how you intend</font>

296
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold them accountable and what John</font>

297
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,880
Brennan ultimately did

298
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,060
took a course of action that as i noted

299
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause strife with</font>

300
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,620
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Intelligence Committee and he</font>

301
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,210
basically stood up an accountability

302
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,320
Review Board that completely overturned

303
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,670
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the CIA's own internal</font>

304
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,270
watchdog found and absolved everyone so

305
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,370
there was actually a moment where there

306
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,580
would have been more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a slap on the</font>

307
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,380
wrist perhaps and but ultimately you

308
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,910
know it was the CIA that you know

309
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,510
investigated itself and absolved itself

310
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,990
as well so why do you think Brennan

311
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,400
decided just to leave the letter as a

312
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,680
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not to send it just to kind of</font>

313
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,820
absorb himself of that accountability uh

314
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something I'm to try to figure</font>

315
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,810
out actually and you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

316
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,790
explanation from the CIA is that John

317
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,470
Brennan decided to apologize in person

318
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,510
to Senator Dianne Feinstein and the

319
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,690
ranking minority member saxby chambliss

320
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,950
so he didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a letter you</font>

321
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,210
know but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was important for other</font>

322
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,890
members as I noted because they want to

323
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it on the record and in addition</font>

324
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,770
because the CIA had wrongly referred

325
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,440
Senate staffers for the four they filed

326
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a criminal referral with the Justice</font>

327
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,140
Department so their explanation you know

328
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,570
the CIA's official on on the record

329
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">explanation is Oh Brendan did apologize</font>

330
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,660
but he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in person you know the the</font>

331
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,120
the letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he ultimately did send</font>

332
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,960
to to the committee to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dianne Feinstein</font>

333
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,090
and Saxby Chambliss was strikingly

334
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,580
different in tone than the one that he

335
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">was that had been a draft and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm unsure</font>

336
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,660
of at this point whether you know he may

337
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,860
have had discussions with the White

338
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,280
House perhaps who was in who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was aware</font>

339
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,970
of what was happening perhaps they you

340
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,190
know talked him out of it or someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

341
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,380
know talked him out of actually you know

342
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,810
going forward with it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe he looked</font>

343
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,910
at it and said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not something you</font>

344
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,740
know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put down on the record</font>

345
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,380
but that's a lingering question it's

346
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,810
it's one that remains unanswered and

347
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,430
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

348
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,370
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more answers to in the</font>

349
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">future it's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well because</font>

350
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,210
it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a written apology might</font>

351
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,100
reach a wider audience than<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

352
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,870
apologizing to two or three specific

353
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,089
people because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think an apology is</font>

354
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,220
deserved by a wider<font color="#CCCCCC"> group than that as</font>

355
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,930
well yeah that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I heard</font>

356
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">from some of you know some of the Senate</font>

357
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,640
staffers is that you know the apology

358
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he gave was was only to you know</font>

359
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,839
Dianne Feinstein and Saxby Chambliss but

360
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,370
it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> include anyone else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and didn't</font>

361
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,230
include any of the staffers you know

362
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,200
nobody else was present and so it really

363
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't mean anything you know Dianne</font>

364
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,860
Feinstein noted that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was very</font>

365
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,040
appreciative<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know to receive</font>

366
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,980
the apology but<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people who are</font>

367
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously involved in this and and saw</font>

368
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,279
themselves being referred for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal</font>

369
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,959
referral being filed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CIA were</font>

370
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,670
were disappointed because it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

371
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

372
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,180
demonstrated that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was apologizing to</font>

373
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,720
the entire committee itself sure well

374
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,370
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one more</font>

375
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,080
question I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the Senate</font>

376
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,120
ever apologize for breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the common</font>

377
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,130
understanding by removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Panetta</font>

378
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,100
review documents uh no actually that's

379
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,839
uh that's that's another good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

380
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,980
so obviously you know there was an

381
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,290
agreement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know the Senate would</font>

382
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,059
Senate Intelligence Committee the

383
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:15,640
staffers would run documents by CIA

384
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,140
before they removed him from the

385
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,730
building and so this Panetta review

386
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,780
which is the internal CIA report on its

387
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,849
own torture program which apparently is

388
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,359
harshly critical of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the program</font>

389
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,300
itself the that's what ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> led to</font>

390
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,610
the spying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google search that the</font>

391
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,040
staffers conducted in which they found

392
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,679
this report and when they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they</font>

393
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,510
you know they copied it and removed it

394
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,880
and and no one knew about it because

395
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,470
they brought it to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Senate</font>

396
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,020
building but they you know their their

397
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,920
justification for doing that was that

398
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,190
the CIA sort of has a history of

399
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,530
destroying documents and and and in

400
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,000
evidence and and the ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> will led</font>

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this to the Senate's own</font>

402
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,320
investigation was a destruction of two

403
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,779
tapes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> interrogation video tapes if</font>

404
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,269
you will interrogation tapes that you

405
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,700
know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which showed a detainee</font>

406
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,320
being waterboarded and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font>

407
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,259
they ended up here but as far as I know

408
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,600
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was no you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know real apology there</font>

409
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,909
was more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a justification for removing</font>

410
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,509
it from the you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building</font>

411
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so much that was really</font>

412
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting thank you I appreciate you</font>

413
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,070
taking the time again to read the story

414
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,809
yeah Anna thank you very much for coming

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,700
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

422
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,080
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier was the Freedom of</font>

423
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,179
Information Act or for your request yes

424
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:47,590
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've been</font>

425
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,600
working with the fellow on<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing these</font>

426
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,700
sorts of things as it seems there's a

427
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,190
trend to keep things not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israeli from</font>

428
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,539
the public but maybe over-classification

429
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,720
we might say do you think that FOIA is a

430
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,029
very important tool in the journalists

431
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,389
arsenal these days it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say it's</font>

432
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:06,159
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important tool in my arsenal</font>

433
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,809
and I think that it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

434
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:10,779
essential for for democracy that you

435
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:14,500
know that this law works unfortunately

436
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,279
it doesn't work the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should I</font>

437
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,299
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to</font>

438
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,820
see I'll say over the past year you know

439
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">a rapid increase in the use of FOIA by</font>

440
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,230
journalists to obtain information

441
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,659
because of the fact that or because the

442
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:34,299
government itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is so highly</font>

443
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,019
secretive you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> over classification</font>

444
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,960
is a huge huge problem in fact with the

445
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,409
Hillary Clinton emails I'm sure as you

446
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,419
heard the you know the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she may</font>

447
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,080
have had some classified information in

448
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,179
her emails that were you know that were

449
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">centered that she received on an</font>

450
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,259
unsecured server and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence</font>

451
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:00,070
community you know inspector general who

452
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,009
weighed in on this and did a sample

453
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,889
review of some of these emails you know

454
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,629
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really been discussed is that</font>

455
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,470
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is government official who pretty</font>

456
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,779
much believe that over-classification

457
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,490
you know does not exist that it's you

458
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:15,700
know

459
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,149
not an issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it's a you know</font>

460
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:21,909
it's a it's it's one of the reasons why

461
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:24,429
you know it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's so</font>

462
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:26,740
difficult to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you know</font>

463
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">obtain documents and obtain certain</font>

464
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,710
records from various government agencies

465
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,860
but you know I this story as I noted

466
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,159
it's really based on FOIA and then and

467
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:40,389
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

468
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,799
incredibly patient and having also<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

469
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,289
incredible attorney and you know we have

470
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,899
an attorney who represents us<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeffrey</font>

471
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:53,080
light is a FOIA attorney in in DC and

472
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,179
and we've been so fortunate to you know

473
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,059
to have these successes with you know

474
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,250
with FOIA but you know part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

475
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes from using it regularly using it</font>

476
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,039
aggressively and you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

477
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,100
we've demonstrated that we do that here

478
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,769
right now it seems that the Senate

479
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:17,590
Select Committee on Intelligence it

480
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,669
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the same type of</font>

481
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:21,159
FOIA<font color="#E5E5E5"> request that it can give two</font>

482
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,649
minutes activate branch agency so could

483
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you speak to the relationship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

484
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,370
those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are providing oversight on</font>

485
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,679
these executive branch agencies and the

486
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,029
desire of these executive branch

487
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,830
agencies to keep their activities hidden

488
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,639
from their overseers you know that

489
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true by the way and that you know</font>

490
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recently testified before</font>

491
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,409

493
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,010
noted that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> during that</font>

494
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,029
testimony that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> if Congress ever</font>

495
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:53,260
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make itself subject to FOIA</font>

496
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,559
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fully support that and because</font>

497
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,600
they are obviously or not they've exempt

498
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,019
themselves from<font color="#CCCCCC"> foia the you know the</font>

499
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,630
relationship between you know the Senate

500
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA obviously or at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

501
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,470
Intelligence Committee and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA you</font>

502
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,389
know Dianne Feinstein noted that this

503
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,990
this breached this intrusion undermine

504
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,649
separation of powers constitutional

505
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:21,010
framework related to oversight of

506
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,470
intelligence activities I mean basically

507
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it's a at least in terms of the</font>

508
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,810
transparency part<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's very</font>

509
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,310
difficult to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any</font>

510
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,890
information in the form of documents out

511
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Senate unless they decide to</font>

512
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,380
release it what was really fascinating

513
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,460
about this cache of Records was that you

514
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,040
know a lot of bulk of it actually were

515
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,100
letters were letters from Congress from

516
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,070
or from the Intelligence Committee to

517
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA that were classified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as top</font>

518
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,460
secret you know secret confidential and

519
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were just basically letters sort of</font>

520
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,930
you know discussing what went on behind

521
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,020
the scenes and and disagreements so I

522
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,270
was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know really obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy</font>

523
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,920
to get those letters get them

524
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,270
Declassified but you know to your your

525
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,700
your question was essentially what what

526
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,540
is the oversight relationship like or

527
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,700
let me do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of</font>

528
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,230
incident has strained the relationship

529
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,020
between the CIA and the Intelligence

530
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,790
Committee and if the intelligence

531
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,720
committees are supposed to give

532
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
oversight what does this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

533
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,640
strained relationship imply for how much

534
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,930
accountability there might be in the

535
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,650
future well at least as it stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

536
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,190
now we have a new chair of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Senate</font>

537
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,540
Intelligence Committee and this is

538
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Senator Richard burr and Richard burr is</font>

539
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,780
far different a far different chairman

540
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,940
than a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diane Feinstein and he wants he's</font>

541
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,650
actually gone on the record saying he

542
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,500
wants all of the hearings to be held in

543
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret he doesn't think that there</font>

544
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,840
should be any you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know public hearings</font>

545
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,270
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence related to the</font>

546
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,130
CIA he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lawmaker who</font>

547
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,020
is whose oversight<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think should be</font>

548
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,600
called into<font color="#E5E5E5"> question because he it's you</font>

549
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,930
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a seems to be too close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

550
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,060
a relationship I mean he is also the one

551
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,460
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted this so-called Panetta review</font>

552
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,940
that I discussed earlier returned you

553
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,870
know to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA so I think that</font>

554
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,790
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of demonstrates what you can expect</font>

555
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,130
in terms of oversight now that the

556
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,950
chairmanship

557
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,510
changed hands I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diane Feinstein was</font>

558
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,929
also very you know supportive of the CIA

559
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,169
one of the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the letters that one</font>

560
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,399
of the internal emails that the that

561
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">John Brennan sent to CIA staff actually</font>

562
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,049
noted that you know Diane<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine so you</font>

563
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,460
spoke for it was very complimentary of

564
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,620
her he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Diane Feinstein is you</font>

565
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,779
know has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very supportive but she</font>

566
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,490
also you know has asked you know some

567
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,309
tough questions and that was shown in

568
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,700
many of these documents so you know

569
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,860
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to see a far</font>

570
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,090
different approach to oversight then you

571
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,409
know we've seen previously in the past

572
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:25,120
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and I and people have been</font>

573
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,110
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very critical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know a</font>

574
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,049
Feinstein<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the oversight at her own</font>

575
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:35,559
oversight activities but as this you

576
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,179
know torture report makes clear and I

577
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:40,350
think now that these documents show that

578
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,700
there was a lot going on behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

579
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,019
scenes I mean she was you know

580
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:48,190
performing far more oversight than we

581
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,019
the public knew at the time and two more

582
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions char you one is as a</font>

583
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,029
journalist you know you the do's<font color="#E5E5E5"> such</font>

584
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,860
excellent reporting is able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

585
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,450
stories that we the<font color="#CCCCCC"> American public</font>

586
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,159
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about if it were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not for</font>

587
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> diligence of the FOIA requests and</font>

588
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:07,120
the ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> still these documents</font>

589
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,059
into something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can digest do you</font>

590
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:14,350
have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that legislation that</font>

591
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,820
wants to do restrictions on FOIA

592
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,760
requests could preclude<font color="#E5E5E5"> us as the public</font>

593
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,289
from knowing internal workings of

594
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,019
government absolutely in fact there was

595
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,510
a legislation I believe if I'm not

596
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,820
mistaken it was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> National Defense</font>

597
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,649
Authorization Act a provision in there

598
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:33,190
that would have added further

599
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,340
restrictions to FOIA even add another

600
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,429
FOIA exemption one of the cyber bill or

601
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,289
the cyber security bill that was being

602
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:45,669
discussed also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had provisions that would</font>

603
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:47,919
have would have impacted negatively

604
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,940
impacted FOIA so yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that and by</font>

605
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you know didn't</font>

606
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,520
fly and

607
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,370
hasn't passed but yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

608
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past year we've</font>

609
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,900
seen you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Congress take you know</font>

610
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,470
take some steps that one would would you

611
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,490
know further undermine and weaken you

612
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,820
know the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spirit of what FOIA was</font>

613
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,730
all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at the same time you know</font>

614
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,010
there have been hearings as i mentioned

615
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,010
i was invited to one in to testify about

616
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">FOIA in which members of Congress you</font>

617
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,170
know discussed how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to ensure</font>

618
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the agencies are abiding by the law</font>

619
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,990
and carrying out their duties<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

620
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,430
right now I'm less concerned about

621
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,380
Congress and more concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

622
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that all government agencies for</font>

623
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most part are terrible at FOIA</font>

624
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,970
they're they're just not abiding by the

625
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,980
guidelines that then Attorney General

626
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,780
Eric Holder had issued back in 2009 so

627
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,060
my beef you know my fights are with

628
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,190
these agencies and and then the

629
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,710
government attorneys but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

630
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,960
time I do think that you know Congress

631
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">could do more to strengthen FOIA and</font>

632
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,770
make it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

633
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,250
these these agencies are are are being

634
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">as transparent as Obama said that they</font>

635

should be and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know with</font>

636
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,910
recent issues we've seen with Hillary

Clinton in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email classifications</font>

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,460
when it was received or stamps were

640
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,380
removed obviously a government official

641
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,690
has different kind of standards than a

642
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,450
normal citizen but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">concerns as a journalist in some of the</font>

work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're doing excuse me that</font>

645

you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be under some kind of</font>

monitoring or do you have concerns<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

647
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,120
they may kick in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your door like they had</font>

648
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,440
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past to some journalists I</font>

649
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,420
don't have concerns that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kick in</font>

650
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,480
my door to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you and you</font>

652
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,320
should say I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean certainly</font>

653
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">with regard to my communications</font>

654
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,010
absolutely i mean i use encrypted emails

655
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,760
i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have all this sort of wide</font>

656
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,430
range of encrypted communications and

657
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,820
that's how I you know

658
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,490
communicate certainly with when it comes

659
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,539
to you know my work but and I think

660
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,429
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the world we have to live</font>

661
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:21,179
in now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've we've learned so much</font>

662
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,279
over the past five years in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of how</font>

663
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,610
easy it is to access you know our

664
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,139
communications how easy it is for you

665
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:32,519
know for emails to just sort of leak out

666
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,399
so you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's important</font>

667
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know operate that way but</font>

668
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,539
with with regard to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font>

669
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:43,830

<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not i'm not fearful that you know</font>

00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:59,129
safe I feel like I throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some vinyl</font>

676
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,960

677
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe I play dead kennedys</font>

682
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:19,049
we literally just got this in right has

683
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,509
there ever been any major backlash from

684
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:24,750
officials from the FOIA<font color="#E5E5E5"> request from</font>

685
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,129
your work like you know what what did

686
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">the CIA say for example about you</font>

687
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,730
publishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that letter yeah well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

688
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,009
CIA basically said that they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

689
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,360
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to publish its letter they did</font>

690
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,909
not they were ok with me quoting from it

691
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,559
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the letter to come out</font>

692
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,509
this was an apology<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter this was a</font>

693
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:48,990
letter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Brennan drafted but but</font>

694
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,659
didn't sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he didn't send and the</font>

695
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:55,769
there was no national security

696
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:57,750
information and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> or anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

697
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">would hurt national security this was</font>

698
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,309
simply to you know protect the agency

699
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,620
perhaps from some embarrassment and

700
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,379
there was no basis to withhold it I

701
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:10,309
certainly could just could not do that

702
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:14,279
you know the letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was mistakenly</font>

703
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,049
turned over because under the Freedom of

704
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:19,200
Information Act these type this type of

705
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,299
letter where it's in draft form could be

706
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:22,410
withheld under what's know

707
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,480
is the deliberative process it's an

708
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,230
exemption called the b5 exemption and so

709
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,550
the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIA I could have</font>

710
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,920
withheld it but the fact that they

711
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,280
mistakenly turned it over was so much in

712
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,800
and of itself a part of this story a

713
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,040
part of the larger story about what led

714
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,460
the CIA to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spy on the Senate you know</font>

715
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,040
the Senate says they obtained a document

716
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,650
known as the Panetta review the CIA is

717
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">one internal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review of its torture</font>

718
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,880
program and they obtained it through a

719
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,940
google search that these documents that

720
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">i obtained that Ryan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shapiro and I</font>

721
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,080
obtained certainly show that in fact it

722
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,160
was a misconfigured Google tool google

723
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,540
search tool that led the CIA or<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather</font>

724
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,100
that that resulted in in in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> senate</font>

725
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,660
accessing documents that the CIA said

726
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,620
you know was<font color="#E5E5E5"> off-limits so the fact that</font>

727
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,630
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it was mistakenly turned over</font>

728
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,730
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though the Senate would</font>

729
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,440
dispute that because they would claim

730
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they you know they have the</font>

731
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,870
authority to look at all of this and

732
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,240
then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time that this document</font>

733
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,480
was turned over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us mistakenly I think</font>

734
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,340
that was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much it in and of</font>

735
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,520
itself a part of this story<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>
