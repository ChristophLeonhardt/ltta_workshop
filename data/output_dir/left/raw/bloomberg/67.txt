1
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,420
London - it’s easy to recognise…

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,389
but look closely at a map

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,639
In the very centre there’s a one square mile
cut out

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,500
This is The City of London which lives in
a city named London

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,300
The City has its own mayor, laws, and police
force. In fact it behaves more like a separate

6
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,899
country within the United Kingdom

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,309
This is because The City’s been around for
much longer than than the UK

8
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,899
It was built by the Romans.

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,260
And has remained semi-autonomous even since

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,519
To embody its fiery independence, the city’s
emblem is a dragon… not a bad choice

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,680
You’ll spot these statues - they guard the
boundary of the Square Mile

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,760
Nowadays The City is arguably the financial
capital of the world

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,340
And London is the world's biggest foreign
exchange market

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,000
But The City has a tiny residential
population

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,380
Every weekday workers flood into the banks,
law firms and offices which fill the Square Mile

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,700
But it’s not all work. This is 1pm

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,480
You might say no surprise here, City work’s having a
drink, but attitudes are changing

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,340
The legendary long lunch at the pub is now
seen as a bit of a macho relic

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,580
In 2017 Lloyd's of London, the legendary insurance
market, told it’s employees the party was over

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,820
No more drink during office hours

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,590
But, as you can see, not everyone got the
memo

22
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,100
Because here’s the rub of it, The City had
a reputation… when the after work crowd

23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,790
go home, the place becomes a ghost town

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,580
But that is changing and leading are some
high flying dining spots

25
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,559
Sitting on top the Heron Tower is the duck
and waffle

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,540
it offers 24/7 service with a hell
of a view

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,900
This is about as refined as
a 24 hour waffle house gets

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,760
But the most talked about new guest, who’s
reinventing The City’s reputation, is call The Ned

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,870
Over 500 million pounds has been spent turning
this old bank into a private members club

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,170
and hotel

31
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,120
With 8 restaurants in the lobby and a bar
that stay open till 4am - The Ned has injected

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,440
some late night atmosphere into The City

33
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,520
This is after all the oldest part of London.
And following an injection of fun and flavour

34
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,430
it’s throwing down a
challenge to the rest of the city and shaking

35
00:02:53,430 --> 00:00:00,000
off its stuffy reputation
