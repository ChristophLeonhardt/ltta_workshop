AGREEMENT, ON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ROSEANNE BARR'S CAREER-ENDING TWEETS. WATCH. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS ELECTED AFTER TRAFFICKING IN BARELY, BARELY CLOAKED RACIAL ANIMUS. A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN MANY WAYS MIMICS THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE. THIS KIND OF STUFF IS A DIRECT BY PRODUCT OF HOW DONALD TRUMP BEHAVES AND THINGS HE HAS SAID. TO THAT POINT. THINGS HE DOES NOT CONDEMN. WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THAT HE IS NOT EMBOLDENING RACISTS AND RACISM AND GIVING THEM A PLATFORM AND MAKING IT OKAY. Tucker: RICHARD GOOD STEIN LAWYERS WHO ADVISED BOTH OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGNS JOINS US TONIGHT. RICHARD, I DON'T BEGRUDGE ANY POLITICAL PARTY OR ITS SURROGATES IN THE MEDIA AN OPPORTUNITY TO GRAB AN ADVANTAGE WHEN YOU SEE ONE. ON THE SUBJECT OF TWEETS, WHICH NO NORMAL PERSON WOULD DEFEND. THEY'RE AWFUL. WHY THE IMPULSE TO IMMEDIATELY MAKE IT A PARTISAN POLITICAL ISSUE WHEN THERE IS A HUMAN MESSAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION WHICH IS DON'T ATTACK PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE. LIKE IT'S THAT SIMPLE. WHY THE IMPULSE TO MAKE IT PARTISAN? CERTAINLY WHAT ROSEANNE BARR DID WAS PATHETIC NOT JUST TO SAY IT BUT TO BLAME IT ON AMBIEN. SHE ALSO SAID IT WAS MEMORIAL DAY. IT WAS AND THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO HAD SAID THE EXACT SAME THING ABOUT SUSAN RICE. WHO HAD BASICALLY DEFENDED THE WHOLE Tucker: YOU DON'T NEED TO CONVINCE ME THE TWEET WAS BAD. I'M THERE ALREADY. ACTUALLY THERE ARE PEOPLE I SUSPECT WHO ACTUALLY ARE KIND OF JOINING TO HER DEFENSE. RIGHT? OH, THIS IS SOMEHOW HER FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE BEING INFRINGED. NONSENSE. Tucker: WHAT I'M SAYING, LOOK, FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE THE SENIOR DEMOCRAT IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WAS A FORMER CLAN RECRUITER. OKAY? ROBERT BYRD. A LOT OF THINGS NAMED AFTER ROBERT BYRD. I'M NOT EVEN ATTACKING ROBERT BYRD. HE APOLOGIZED. BUT LET'S GET A LITTLE PROPORTION HERE. THE OUTRAGE IS SELECTIVE. I'M NOT DEFENDING THE ROSEANNE CRAP, BUT I ALSO THINK WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUMPING UP AND DOWN ACTUALLY TRUMP DID THIS, IT'S PURELY POLITICAL. LET'S BE HONEST. ACTUALLY I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR VIEW BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING. DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN LICENSE TO PEOPLE BY SAYING THEY ARE GOOD NAZIS BY MOCKING HANDICAP PEOPLE. BY BASICALLY, YOU KNOW. Tucker: MOCKING HANDY CAP PEOPLE. REMEMBER HE WENT LIKE THIS BY "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER. Tucker: WAS HE MOCKING ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. IT WAS THAT GUY. IT WAS PATHETIC. THE LIST IS ON AND ON. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THOUGH, WHEN DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT AND PEOPLE SAY WELL, HE WON, SO HIS STAFF CAN GO WELL I CAN MIMIC PEOPLE AND MAKE FUN OF JOHN MCCAIN WHO IS DYING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THEN PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTERS THINK AT HIS RALLIES PEOPLE WHO COVER HIS RALLIES SAY THESE PEOPLE WERE LOVELY AND THEN THE RALLY WOULD START AND THEY WOULD SAY THE MOST ANTI-SEMITIC. Tucker: I HAVE BEEN ON TELEVISION FOR 1020 YEARS THE NASTINESS OF HATE MAIL I RECEIVE REMAINS CONSTANT. I DIDN'T BLAME OBAMA FOR THE HATE MAIL AND DEATH THREATS I GOT. I DIDN'T BLAME OBAMA. THIS IS A LARGER QUESTION. PART OF THE QUESTION IS, DO PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN RACISM, LIKE AL SHARPTON, HAVE THE RIGHT TO LECTURE THE REST OF US ABOUT RACISM? DO THEY? IS AL SHARPTON THE SPOKESMAN YOU WANT AGAINST RACISM, REALLY? NO, HE IS NOT. I AGREE WITH YOU. BUT I DO THINK IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP SPEWS WHAT HE DID ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND AS PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT GOOD NAZIS IS SOMETHING THAT SENDS A SIGNAL LIKE I BASICALLY AM DRAWING SUCKER FROM THESE PEOPLE. AND IT'S WHY HE TWEETS ABOUT EVERY STUPID THING UNDER THE SUN. NFL PLAYERS KNEELING. CAN'T Tucker: DRAW ME IN DEFENDING EVERY DUMB TRUMP TWEET WHICH I'M NOT. WE ARE AGAINST RACISM, I HOPE. I CERTAINLY AM. WE DO A LOT OF SHOWS ON IT. OF COURSE. Tucker: IS IT WRONG TO DISIM NATE AGAINST DISCM NATE AGAINST DISCRINATE AGAINST DISCRIMITE AGAINST DISCRIMINA AGAINST DISCRIMINATEGAINST DISCRIMINATE AINST DISCRIMINATE AGAST DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE ON SKIN COLOR. THAT'S GIVEN THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. NO I'M TALKING ABOUT RACISM. IS IT WRONG TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE BASED ON SKIN COLOR? IF IT'S NOT, THEN WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT ROSEANNE SAID. IF THERE IS. YOU SHOULDN'T BASE PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF CHARACTERISTICS, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK ROSEANNE BARR AND PEOPLE LIKE HER TO HO TALK ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AS APES IS WRONG. Tucker: I AGREE. IT'S DISGUSTING. IS IT WRONG TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE ON THE BASIS OF A SKIN COLOR, TO HOLD THEM BACK ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SKIN. IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE ANSWER. CAN YOU ANSWER IT. OF COURSE, BUT, YOU ARE ACTING LIKE SOMEHOW SLAVERY DIDN'T HAPPEN. Tucker: I DIDN'T SAY THAT. THAT'S THE INTIMATION YOU ARE GETTING AT. Tucker: PLEASE. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AT. Tucker: THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GETTING AT. I AM A STRAIGHTFORWARD PERSON. DON'T ATTACK ME. I'M ASKING YOU ABOUT A PRINCIPLE. WHICH IS IT WRONG TO HURT PEOPLE, TO HOLD THEM BACK, DENY THEM THINGS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE GET BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE? IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE QUESTION YES OR NO. I AGREE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. Tucker: NO. PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. THEY SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THEIR FACE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A COLORBLIND SOCIETY. ERIC HOLDER AND OTHER BLACK CABINET OFFICIALS HAVE TROUBLE HAILING A TAXICAB. Tucker: BY THE WAY, I'M NOT DENYING THAT. I'M MERELY SAYING IS IT WRONG TO PRACTICE RACISM AGAINST PEOPLE? OF COURSE. Tucker: IT. YES. Tucker: YOU WOULD SAY IT'S TOTALLY WRONG TO SAY TO A CHILD BECAUSE OF YOUR SKIN COLOR WE'RE HOLDING YOU BACK? THERE IS A MASSIVE LAWSUIT AGAINST HARVARD RIGHT NOW BY ASIAN STUDENTS WHO ARE BASICALLY PROVEN THAT HARVARD DIDN'T LET THEM IN BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. RIGHT. Tucker: IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU. JEWS USED TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE EXACT SAME THING. Tucker: WITH T. WAS WRONG. LIBERALS SUPPORT IT NOW. RIGHT. Tucker: THOSE PEOPLE LECTURE ME ABOUT RACISM. VIRTUE IN DIVERSITY. Tucker: VIRTUE NEW DISCRIMINATION? CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT TUCK TONGUE I'M CALLING IT WHAT IT IS. WE BOTH AGREED THAT PENALIZING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE IS IMMORAL YOU AGREED WITH THAT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW FULL SUPPORT OF LIBERALS SAME ONES LECTURING US ABOUT RACISM IT'S TOO MUCH. I'M SAYING THERE IS A QUILT INVOLVED AND, YES, DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SKIN COLOR IS WRONG. BUT PEOPLE WERE HELD BACK FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. Tucker: I AGREE. TO BASICALLY ACT LIKE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. Tucker: I'M NOT ACTING LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I THINK IT'S THE CENTRAL SIN OF AMERICA. I HAVE THINK IT'S OUR ORIGINAL SIN. I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE. BUT, I DON'T THINK THAT RACISM IS OKAY. AND LIBERALS DO. AND I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THAT HURTING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE IS A-OKAY? NO. THE POSITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE FACT THAT WHAT HAPPENED FOR 200 YEARS AND IF WE ACT LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND THAT SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER. Tucker: I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT NO. ACT LIKE SKIN COLOR DOESN'T MATTER. THAT SIGNATURE NORIEGA THE OBVIOUS. Tucker: THE CHINESE KID WHO ARRIVED HERE 20 MINUTES AGO. RIGHT. Tucker: SUFFERS FROM THAT BECAUSE OF HIS RACE. NO. THAT'S OKAY, THE DEMOCRATS. NO. Tucker: SAME ONES US LECTURES ANTIRACISM
