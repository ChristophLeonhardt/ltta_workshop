there are three steps I think to really enjoy your work more number one first and foremost instead of thinking what can go wrong here today at work think about what is in my control in other words my actions and my thoughts not outcomes what can I do well in this moment to deal with this challenge having that focus the other thing that you can do well is think about enjoyment as a practicing skill not just thinking about it as oh I'm going to as a result I enjoyed today maybe you experiment maybe your goal for today is actually to go out there and do something different like and make contact with a different person at work the third thing is having an attitude of gratitude rather than focusing on what's wrong at work focus on one thing you're grateful for that could be a person that you feel like provides value on your team or that you're supervising or even or a supervisor it could be something that happened at work that was funny those people that are grateful that fine that gratitude an appreciation for some aspect of their life do well whether they're in a slump or they're doing great and that's the goal
