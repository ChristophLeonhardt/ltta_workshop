1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,080
FLYNN.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,484
HE SHOWED NO SIGNS THAT HE WAS

3
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:05,784
LYING.

4
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:11,089
HERE NOW FOX NEWS SENIOR

5
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,424
TRADITIONAL ANALYST JUDGE

6
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:12,824
NAPOLITANO.

7
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:14,192
I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD TO THIS

8
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:15,394
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" PIECE.

9
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:17,829
IF THERE'S SOME VERY SENSITIVE

10
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,799
LANGUAGE AT PLAY IN ALL OF THIS.

11
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:22,701
WHAT HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR IS THAT

12
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,604
THE AGENT WHO INTERVIEWED

13
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:27,906
MICHAEL FLYNN, SAID HE SHOWED NO

14
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:30,275
SIGNS OF DECEPTION.

15
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,411
THAT'S BEING TAKEN TO UNDERSTOOD

16
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:35,147
AS THEY BELIEVE HE DIDN'T LIE.

17
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:35,981
>> AGENTS WELL TRAINED AND

18
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,416
LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF DECEPTION.

19
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,517
TURNED OUT HE DID LIE.

20
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:39,184
WE KNOW THAT.

21
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:41,086
IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS.

22
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,688
LOT OF AFFECTION AND RESPECT FOR

23
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:45,490
THE CAREER OF GENERAL FLYNN.

24
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,992
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I WOULD

25
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:49,194
HAVE INDICTED HIM IF I WAS

26
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:49,795
MUELLER.

27
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:51,597
WE KNOW HE LIED, THERE'S A

28
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:52,331
RECORDING OF THE CONVERSATION

29
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:54,600
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN ELICIT

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:54,967
RECORDING.

31
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,101
IT'S A RECORDING.

32
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,103
WE KNOW IT OCCURRED.

33
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:00,772
WE KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT.

34
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:02,674
>> UNMASKED CONVERSATION?

35
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:03,709
>> CORRECT.

36
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,110
UNMASKED BY OBAMA

37
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,577
ADMINISTRATION.

38
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:06,478
IT WAS PUTTED IN "WASHINGTON

39
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:08,313
POST" IT WAS INTENDED TO

40
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:10,015
EMBARRASS THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT

41
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:10,916
TRUMP.

42
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,618
THE QUESTION IS WHY DID THEY

43
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,753
INDICT HIM FOR SUCH A MINOR

44
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:16,021
INSIGNIFICANT LIE?

45
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,457
I'M NOT DOWN PLAYING --

46
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:19,124
>> UNDERLYING CONVERSATION,

47
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:20,258
THERE'S A VERY GOOD ARGUMENT

48
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:21,426
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH HIM

49
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,494
HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.

50
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:23,261
>> ABSOLUTELY.

51
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,197
>> THE PROBLEM WAS HE DISCUSSED

52
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:26,398
THE POTENTIAL FUTURE ACCORDING

53
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,700
TO THIS, OF WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP

54
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,203
ADMINISTRATION WILL BE OPEN TO

55
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,604
LIFTING SANCTIONS.

56
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:34,206
WHICH IS NORMAL CONVERSATION TO

57
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:35,073
HAVE.

58
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,475
>> UNDERLYING CONVERSATION WAS

59
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:39,711
NOT ONLY LAUREL -- LAWFUL AND

60
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,078
WHOLESOME.

61
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,414
I WANTED TO GET A HOOK IN

62
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:51,023
GENERAL FLYNN JUST LIKE A HOOK

63
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:52,524
IN PAPADOPOULOS AND SWEDISH

64
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:53,025
LAWYER.

65
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,126
THEY THINK THEY CAN GET

66
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,127
INFORMATION FROM THESE FOLKS.

67
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:57,329
IN RETURN FOR NOT GOING AFTER

68
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,897
GENERAL FLYNN FOR EVERYTHING

69
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:02,734
UNDER THE SUN, FAILING TO

70
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,836
REGISTER, THEY CUT A DEAL, YOU

71
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:07,539
HELP US OUT, PLEAD GUILTY TO

72
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:07,839
LYING.

73
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:12,811
MAX SIX MONTHS.

74
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,379
DID HE HELP THEM OUT WITH

75
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:14,746
ANYTHING.

76
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:17,015
WE DON'T KNOW.

77
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:18,583
DEPENDS ON WHO'S INDICTED.

78
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,152
>> THE OTHER THING THAT I FOUND

79
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:21,920
REALLY INTERESTING IN THIS

80
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,122
EDITORIAL TODAY.

81
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,625
IS THIS SECTION FROM ANDREW

82
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:26,958
McCABE.

83
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,126
TALKING ABOUT THE CASE.

84
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,127
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT HERE IS THAT

85
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,829
THIS IS FROM THE HOUSE INTEL

86
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,563
REPORT.

87
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:32,731
INITIALLY THEY REDACT ALL OF

88
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,265
THIS STUFF.

89
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:36,034
THEN THEY RELEASED A NEW VERSION

90
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:37,636
AND YOU WOULD ASSUME, THEY

91
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,137
REDACTED THINGS THAT ARE

92
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:39,738
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

93
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:44,743
IT TURNS OUT WHAT THEY HAD

94
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:47,446
BLACKED OUT WAS STUFF THAT MADE

95
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:48,914
McCABE LOOK BAD.

96
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:50,615
>>   THIS IS WHAT DEVIN NUNES

97
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,718
HAS BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT LOUD

98
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:53,819
AND LONG.

99
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,925
THESE REDACTIONS ARE PROPORTEDLY

100
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:03,195
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSES.

101
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:06,431
>> THAT'S WHAT -- WE PUT IT UP.

102
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,632
DEPUTY DIRECT McCABE

103
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:08,433
CONDITIONALLED THAT THE TWO

104
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,435
PEOPLE WHO INTERVIEWED FLYNN

105
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,437
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS LYING WHICH

106
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:15,240
WAS NOT A GREAT BEGINNING OF A

107
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,410
FALSE STATEMENT CASE.

108
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,279
WHY WOULD THAT BE REDACTED?

109
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,115
>> THE POWER TO REDACTS A

110
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:23,849
CORRUPT POWER.

111
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,317
IT SHOULDN'T BE IN THE HANDS OF

112
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,718
THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THE

113
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:27,085
DOCUMENT.

114
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,820
IT SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF

115
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,756
SOME NEUTRAL ENTITY TO DECIDE

116
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,424
WHAT IS SO SENSITIVE THAT

117
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,459
CONGRESS CAN'T SEE IT.

118
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,827
WHAT WOULD CAUSE THE DEATH OF A

119
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:36,528
SOURCE.

120
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,530
WHAT WOULD CAUSE WITNESS TO FLEE

121
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,034
A DEFENDANT TO GET OUT OF THE

122
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:43,602
WAY

123
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,204
>> THAT MAKES THEM LOOK BAD.

124
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:46,905
>> MEANTIME, GENERAL FLYNN IS

125
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:47,839
STILL STUCK WITH THIS.

126
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,474
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING

127
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:50,776
TO GO.

128
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,144
HE PLEADED GUILTY UNDER OATH.

129
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:55,147
HE CAN'T TAKE THAT BACK WITHOUT

130
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,815
ANOTHER CHARGE OF PERJURY.

131
00:03:56,815 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE HANGING
