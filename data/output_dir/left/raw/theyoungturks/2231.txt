1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,670
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
HAS OFFICIALLY FILED A LAWSUIT

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,229
AGAINST THE STATE OF FLORIDA
FOLLOWING RICK SCOTT'S DECISION

3
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:13,260
TO SIGN LEGISLATION THAT
REGULATED GUNS A MINIMAL AMOUNT.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,730
NOW, THE NRA TOOK ISSUE WITH THE
FACT THAT FLORIDA HAS NOW BANNED

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,490
PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 FROM
PURCHASING FIREARMS.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,180
ACCORDING

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,370
TO THE NRA, THEY SAY THEY FILED
A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STATE FOR

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,409
VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS OF 18 T0 21-YEAR-OLDS,

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:38,129
THEY ALSO SAID THAT THIS BAN
VIOLETS THE RIGHTS OF

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,699
LAW-ABIDING FLORIDA CITIZENS.

11
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,969
THEY ALSO ARGUE THAT IT IS BAD

12
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:54,350
FOR WOMEN, IT INFRINGES ON
WOMEN'S RIGHTS EVEN MORE BECAUSE

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,920
WOMEN POSE LESS OF A RISK WHEN
IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
SHOOTINGS.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,309
THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS IN 1000
DIFFERENT WAYS.

16
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,789
FIRST OF ALL,

17
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,130
WOMEN ARE LESS PRONE TO BE
ALCOHOLICS, SO DOES IT IMPINGE

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,729
UPON THEIR RIGHTS THAT THEY
CAN'T BUY A BEER BEFORE 21?

19
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:11,729
I

20
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,259
THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO BUY A BEER AT 18, BUT THAT'S

21
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,460
NOT THE LAW WE HAVE AND IT'S NOT
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,460
THEY ARE GOING

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,570
TO SAY SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT MY
POINT THERE IS WE DON'T DO LAWS

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,280
BASED ON, WELL, WHO IS MORE
LIKELY TO DO X OR Y?

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
THAT'S A

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,320
BAD IDEA OVERALL, I KEEP HAVING
TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE RIGHT

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
WING.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,530
IN THIS CASE THEY ARE
HIDING BEHIND WOMEN TO TRY TO

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,530
MAKE THEIR CASE.

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,869
LIKE POOR
WOMEN, YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THEIR

31
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,210
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS -- I'M
SURE THESE NRA GUYS ARE ALWAYS

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,340
BASHING MEN ON A REGULAR BASIS.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,810
NO, IT'S JUST A WAY TO HIDE

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,070
BEHIND THEM.

35
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:55,320
BUT TO ME THE HEART
OF THE STORY IS THE NRA SAYING

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,499
WE ARE ABOVE THE LAW, WE DON'T
CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS.

37
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,499
WE

38
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:01,499
ALREADY CONTROL THE POLITICIANS.

39
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,499
AND THESE GUYS STEPPED OUT OF

40
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,869
LINE FOR A SECOND ON A TINY
LITTLE ISSUE, SO WE ARE GOING TO

41
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,360
GO BREAK THEIR BACK AND SERVE
EVERYONE ALSO LESSENED, AND WE

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,030
DON'T CARE WHAT 97% OF THE
COUNTRY THINKS, WE ARE IN CHARGE

43
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,040
AND YOU AREN'T. THIS IS THE
ARROGANCE OF POWER.

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,190
AND WHEN THE NRA KIND OF
ENCOURAGES A FRAMING OF STATES'

45
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,360
RIGHTS, THE STATES MADE THEIR
DECISION.

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
THE STATE MADE ITS

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,890
DECISION, AND YOU ARE GOING TO
COMPLETELY GO AROUND THAT AND

48
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,940
SUE THE STATE?

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,780
WHICH JUST
REVEALS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

50
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,170
IDEOLOGY, THERE IS NO
IDEOLOGICAL FRAMING, YOU AREN'T

51
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,410
THERE TO PROTECT THE SECOND
AMENDMENT, THE NRA, THE SECRET

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,950
DECODER RING YOU PLUG IN THERE
IS THE NRA JUST WANTS TO SELL

53
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,402
MORE GUNS, THAT'S ALL THEY ARE
THERE FOR.

54
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,530
THERE ARE PARTS OF

55
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,200
THE FLORIDA BILL THAT MAKE IT
MORE LIKELY THAT TEACHERS WILL

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,560
BE ARMED, THERE IS LANGUAGE
SETTING DOWN THE FOUNDATION FOR

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,210
THAT CHANGE, SO I THOUGHT THEY
MIGHT NOT COME AFTER IT.

58
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,650
BUT THEY GOT A LOT OF LAWYERS
SITTING AROUND AND A LOT OF

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,930
MONEY TO SPEND ON THEM, SO THEY
WILL DO IT.

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,560
HOW MANY KIDS YOU THINK GET
SHOT THE FIRST YEAR?

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
HOW MANY

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
WILL TEACHERS SHOOT?

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,260
BECAUSE
THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

64
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,210
THEY WILL BE AFRAID FOR THEIR
LIFE.

65
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,960
SOME TEACHERS HAVE ALREADY
BEEN FOUND SAYING WEIRD STUFF,

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,300
LIKE WEIRD, SUPER RACIST STUFF
ABOUT KIDS.

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
I SAW THAT STORY.

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
THERE'S
ANOTHER STORY I DON'T KNOW IF

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,760
YOU COVERED, THERE WAS A TEACHER
FREAKED OUT IN SCHOOL WITH A

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,030
GUN, DID YOU COVER THAT?

71
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,390
HE
BARRICADED HIMSELF IN A

72
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,040
CLASSROOM, THE PRINCIPAL TRIED
TO GET IN WITH THE KEY, HE SHOT

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,710
THE GUN, AND SO NOBODY GOT HURT
THANKFULLY, BUT WE ALL KNOW

74
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,790
THOSE TEACHERS THAT ARE -- WE
ALL HAD TEACHERS THAT WERE RIGHT

75
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,440
ON THE EDGE, AND GUYS LIKE ME
TRY TO PUSH THEM OVER.

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,260
THAT'S HOW COMICS ARE BORN.

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,260
THAT'S RIGHT.

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,740
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

79
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,690
LET ME JUMP IN REAL QUICK
ABOUT A POINT YOU MADE, CENK,

80
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,210
AND HOW THE ALCOHOL THING, THE
ALCOHOL ARGUMENT YOU MADE IS A

81
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,340
LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE
SECOND AMENDMENT, THE SECOND

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,850
AMENDMENT DOESN'T PROTECT
ALCOHOL RIGHTS, IT PROTECTS GUN

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,850
RIGHTS.

84
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,960
BUT EVERY AMENDMENT IN
THE CONSTITUTION HAS

85
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,310
LIMITATIONS, AND THE SECOND
AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS

86
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,850
A WELL REGULATED MILITIA.

87
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,630
SO TO
SAY -- LIKE, UNDER THE NRA'S

88
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,220
LOGIC JIMMY'S EXAMPLE OF THAT
TEACHER WHO LOST IT AND

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,470
BARRICADED HIMSELF, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE HIS GUN TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE

90
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,320
THAT'S VIOLATING HIS SECOND
MOMENT RIGHTS.

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
NO, THERE ARE

92
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,340
LIMITATIONS TO EVERY
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

93
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,340
BUT

94
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,290
THE NRA KEEP SPREADING THIS
NONSENSE PROPAGANDA MAKING IT

95
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,280
SEEM AS THOUGH EVERYONE, YOU ARE
ON THE TERRORIST WATCH LIST, YOU

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,340
GET GUN RIGHTS, YOU ARE ON THIS
LIST, THAT LIST, YOUR BRAIN

97
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,450
HASN'T FULLY FORMED YET YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY AN AR-15.

98
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,820
THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO EVERY
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, PERIOD.

99
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:07,130
WAIT, IF AN 18-YEAR-OLD HAS A
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A GUN,

100
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,260
WHY DOESN'T A 17-YEAR-OLD, OR A
THREE-YEAR-OLD?

101
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
WE HAVE TO DRAW

102
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,900
THE LINE SOMEWHERE AND THE STATE
IS ALLOWED TO DRAW IT IN A

103
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,620
REASONABLE PLACE.

104
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,940
SO 21 IS THE
BARRIER FOR A LOT OF THE AGE

105
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,650
LIMITS IN THE COUNTRY, AND HENCE
WHY I BRING UP ALCOHOL, SO OF

106
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,770
COURSE YOU CAN SAY YOU HAVE TO
BE 21 BEFORE YOU CAN BUY A GUN

107
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,560
IF IT'S ALSO THE SAME AGE FOR
YOU TO BE ABLE TO BUY A BEER.

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
SO

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
THAT'S A REASONABLE PLACE FOR
THE GOVERNMENT TO DRAW THAT

110
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
LIMITATION.

111
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,120
AND IF YOU SAY THERE
ARE NO LIMITATIONS, THAT'S NOT

112
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,990
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT ALL.

113
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,080
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SAYS EVERY

114
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,210
AMENDMENT HAS SOME LIMITATIONS.

115
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,830
YOU CAN'T YELL FIRE IN A CROWDED

116
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,710
THEATER, AND YES YOU CAN TAKE
THE GUNS AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO

117
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,400
HAVE USED GUNS IN VIOLENT CRIMES
BEFORE, AND YES YOU CAN LIMIT IT

118
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,510
SO THAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS CAN'T
HAVE THEM, OR IF THEY WANT,

119
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,960
19-YEAR-OLDS CAN'T HAVE THEM.

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,830
WHAT ELSE GETS ME IS THE
TIMELINE WHERE THEY FILED THIS

121
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,250
LAWSUIT.

122
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,740
AFTER GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SIGNED
THIS LAW INTO EFFECT, THE

123
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,250
NRA HAD THEIR LAWSUIT FILED
WITHIN ONE HOUR.

124
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,230
THAT'S A GREAT POINT BY BRETT,
BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

125
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,500
DO IS TEACH POLITICIANS A
LESSON.

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,981
NEVER, EVER CROSS US, WE

127
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:27,560
DON'T CARE HOW MANY KIDS DIED IN
YOUR STATE, WE DON'T CARE HOW

128
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,940
MANY MASSACRES THERE WERE, WE
DON'T CARE WHAT THE PUBLIC

129
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,150
POLLING SHOWS, REMEMBER, WE ARE
IN CHARGE.

130
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,150
SO THAT'S WHAT THEY

131
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,590
ARE TRYING TO DO HERE, AND ONE
LAST THING THAT MAKES ME SICK

132
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,270
ABOUT THIS WHOLE SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES IS NOW RICK SCOTT

133
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,700
IS PUT IN A POSITION WHERE HE
HAS TO DEFEND THIS LAW, WHICH

134
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,270
WAS ONLY A TINY, TINY PIECE OF
REGULATION, AND IT MAKES RICK

135
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,500
SCOTT, A BARBARIC RIGHT-WINGER,
LOOK MODERATE.

136
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
BECAUSE ATTILA

137
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,760
THE HUN IS TO THE RIGHT OF HIM
NOW.

138
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
SO IT'S A WIN/WIN FOUR

139
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,060
CONSERVATIVES IN THAT SENSE.

140
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,340
BUT
AT SOME POINT I THINK THEY ARE

141
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,620
GOING TO MUSKOKA LATE AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY

142
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,620
YOU KNOW WHAT?

143
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,380
I'M NOT JUST FOR
FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, NOT

144
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,020
JUST FOR GUN CONTROL, WHICH 97%
ARE FOR FEDERAL BACKGROUND

145
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,093
CHECKS, 70% ARE FOR GUN CONTROL
OVERALL -- BUT I HAVE TO GET

146
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:23,510
MONEY OUT, BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE
ARE RUBBING OUR FACES IN IT

147
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,400
SAYING I OWN YOUR POLITICIANS, I
OWN THE COURTS, OUT EVERYTHING,

148
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,700
AND YOU ARE POWERLESS, YOU WILL
HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WAIT UNTIL

149
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,230
THERE IS A SCHOOL SHOOTING
WHERE YOUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL.

150
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:41,370
AND AT SOME POINT 
THEY WILL HAVE

151
00:07:41,370 --> 00:00:00,000
A REBELLION ON THEIR HANDS.
