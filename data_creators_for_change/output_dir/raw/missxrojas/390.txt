00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
hey guys so it's been ages since I saw

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,449
you last it actually does feel like it's

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:04,859
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really long time I'm used to</font>

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,000
getting up in the morning and checking

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,710
the challenges or checking member second

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,840
the midnight click<font color="#E5E5E5"> 'add Dixon but now</font>

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new years revolution is over I mean</font>

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,360
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest there's nothing to live</font>

9
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,280
for I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that much in</font>

10
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,379
the past 48 hours I really capture the

11
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,510
castle I also rarely bought in turn by

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">Antonio forest it's definitely a kids</font>

13
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,510
book 70 something that you'd read if you

14
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,680
i don't know like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight-year-old girl</font>

15
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

16
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,289
brilliant and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one of those stories</font>

17
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,519
about a garland boarding school I'd

18
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,500
never read anything by had before and I

19
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,390
I really wish I discovered these books

20
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,679
when I was younger brilliantly written

21
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">really exciting girls at school stories</font>

22
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,430
and a lot of the stuff even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

23
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,930
didn't go to boarding school or even a

24
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,250
private school<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot the stuff was</font>

25
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,350
really familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiarity of girls in</font>

26
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,090
school I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and I capture the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> castle</font>

27
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,829
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more wonderful each time I</font>

28
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,600
read it so yeah that was a delight and I

29
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,250
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see shame with my friend Georgia</font>

30
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,870
with whom I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see you probably most</font>

31
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> films</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i see at university partly</font>

32
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i enjoy her company and don't</font>

33
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to see her as much anymore but also</font>

34
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,780
partly because we have some of the only

35
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,190
people who heap scorn on you if you

36
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,809
don't order popcorn I feel like there's

37
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:58,949
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> horrible trend going on at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

38
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,020
where people bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a raw carrots and</font>

39
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,730
cucumber with hummus to the cinema I

40
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,290
love her miss and I love real cucumber

41
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,729
and all of that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the cinema</font>

42
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to have popcorn at least some</font>

43
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,670
sort of unhealthy equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font>

44
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,049
though the popcorn ends up costing like

45
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,820
double the price of my ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still</font>

46
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,619
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do without it it is</font>

47
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,180
integral<font color="#E5E5E5"> Georgia understand 'this so</font>

48
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,890
this is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> gated cinema together anyway</font>

49
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,240
so we saw Shane which was a Steve

50
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,740
McQueen film starring Michael Fassbender

51
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,680
and my love Carey Mulligan every time

52
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,880
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> release photos from the great</font>

53
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
gatsby film by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get so</font>

54
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">excited she's the perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> daisy</font>

55
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">buchanan's she's a daisy buchanan from</font>

56
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,630
my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> just much shames quite intense</font>

57
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,820
it has a beautiful soundtrack generally

58
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,439
not unlike hard to film and not want to

59
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,970
go see with your parents the way it shot

60
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,439
there something strangely claustrophobic

61
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,210
about it so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always in kind of these</font>

62
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,220
glass flats in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or these glass</font>

63
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,619
offices or you know the subway ways in

64
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,930
enclosed grass spaces almost like

65
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,490
screens against which to perform so

66
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,869
there's lots of screens as a cinema

67
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,369
screen and there's these glass screens

68
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,170
and as yet all the stuff all of these

69
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,100
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> were having it once when I was</font>

70
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,420
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it really beautifully made</font>

71
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,250
film and as I say the school just added

72
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,500
so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> because so much of the film was</font>

73
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,020
silent and so the score just brings in a

74
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,759
whole new level of tension<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a whole</font>

75
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,469
new level of everything in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way I</font>

76
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,659
suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all schools do but this</font>

77
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,340
just did it so well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't want to</font>

78
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much about the film's the</font>

79
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,370
cinema going experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> georgia and i</font>

80
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,000
were amongst the first anderson

81
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there were like five or six</font>

82
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people but it became more and more</font>

83
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,380
obvious that this was a film that a lot

84
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of sixty plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your old men were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

85
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,400
see by themselves and they SAT by

86
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,690
themselves around the edges of the

87
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,910
cinema there were also four or five

88
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,310
different elderly couples<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

89
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,330
see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> together and I didn't know</font>

90
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,530
whether this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like crazy West</font>

91
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,850
Country couples or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this</font>

92
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,260
just doesn't seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me like a granny</font>

93
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Grandpa sort of folk I was honestly</font>

94
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,930
really surprised that none of the old

95
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,520
ladies walked out so yeah there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

96
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,959
of kind of creepy guy sitting by

97
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,550
themselves more than you'd expect a

98
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,620
nerve in a daze screening and because it

99
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,730
was in the middle of day it was like

100
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,750
through or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were even</font>

101
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,130
fewer students than they normally would

102
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so we were even more aware of</font>

103
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,860
it and they just scared us and I

104
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,330
wondered<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much that was unfair and</font>

105
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,160
ages but I can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the fact</font>

106
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,690
that it really creeped me out one thing

107
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,800
I was quite entertained by there were

108
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,150
also two guys who were listening with

109
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,920
audio described headphones every now and

110
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,390
then when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a quieter scenes when</font>

111
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,620
you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hear the school</font>

112
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,700
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit a little kind of fuzzy</font>

113
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,230
bits coming from their headphones and

114
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,550
occasionally I found myself wondering

115
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,080
how exactly are they describing the

116
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,239
scene<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how what what they doing but</font>

117
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:08,260
yeah I thought was really good it's

118
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,820
definitely one of those artsy films if

119
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,290
you don't like this sort of film then

120
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,510
stay far far away they feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like under</font>

121
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,400
18 stay far far away it's kind of it

122
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,570
with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> life I'll leave it there for now</font>

123
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,040
i'll try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a video every other day</font>

124
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,060
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not gonna promise anything</font>

125
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,830
but it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a rosy anima two days</font>

126
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,540
it won't be a community channel two days

127
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,340
I checked Natalie trans youtube channel

128
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,440
like a daily basis I'm like why you said

129
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,739
two days then I cry I really should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

130
00:03:29,739 --> 00:00:00,000
used to it by now bye<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>
