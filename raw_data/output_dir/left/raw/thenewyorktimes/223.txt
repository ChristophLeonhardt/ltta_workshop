1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,990
“It’s shocking how much
time into one song was put

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,540
from so many different people.”

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,070
“A year of work,
15 different vocalists,

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,170
everyone getting the song
to sound as good

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,540
as everyone knew it could be.”

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,040
“Hey.”

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,720
“Hey.”

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,660
“Hey. How's it going?”

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,580
“I know we meant all good intentions.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,550
Yeah. I feel like that's 
my quota of singing for the day.

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,520
I’m so bad at singing in front of people.”

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,530
So do you remember
the first session

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,990
that you guys had where you
worked on “The Middle”?

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,750
“The day before the session, we were
kind of just going through ideas.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,070
And there was this sound.”

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,120
“We were kind of like, you know,
this feels really special.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,100
Let’s save it for tomorrow with Sarah.”

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,610
“I’m this guy.

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,530
I sit in the back and I'm like, ‘Cool.’ ”

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,320
“Is she on Instagram?
Is she on Twitter?

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,580
Or is she writing?
But she’s writing.

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,580
She actually is.”

23
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,140
“I only really put the voice memo on

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,530
if I think I’m
getting something good.”

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,930
“She just wrote for 10
minutes and she’s like:

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,180
‘I’m going to go in the
booth and let me sing it.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,570
Let me know what you guys think.’

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,720
That was literally the
first thing we heard.”

29
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,030
“All three of us literally just
screamed with excitement.”

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,820
And when you heard that,

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,530
I mean, it sounds crass, but, like, do you see dollar signs?

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,350
“I mean, it’s hard
sometimes in the room,

33
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,110
you write songs so much,

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,200
but it definitely felt special.”

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,060
“So we get sent a lot of demos.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,349
But there’s a few writers
where we really love basically

37
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,140
everything they do.

38
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,140
And Sarah’s one of them.

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,390
We were instantly, like,

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,200
‘We’re definitely going to 
try a version of this.’ ”

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,260
“We are, like, obsessed with these,
like, cinematic sound samples

42
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,870
that we have.”

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,930
“Yeah, that’s like a
medieval ax whipping noise.”

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,497
“Everyone watches ‘Game
of Thrones,’ or whatever.

45
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:32,788
But you never hear it in songs.”

46
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,120
“We had something
that we like, but it

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,039
wasn’t, like, absolutely perfect.”

48
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,080
“So they played it for me and were 
like, ‘What do you think?’

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,204
I felt if done right

50
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,780
this could be huge smash.

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,490
So we start working
on it together,

52
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,810
and everybody started loving it.

53
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,880
Let’s just find a vocalist.

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,660
Which is something that
ended up taking,

55
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,120
as you know, quite a long time.”

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,670
“It’s not very often that

57
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,020
that many high-level artists cut a song.”

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,320
“I’m looking for somebody to
sing it with the same intention

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,090
as Sarah sang it.

60
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,500
But I’m looking for
somebody to do it better.”

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,790
“There’s been months 
where we, like, almost gave up

62
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,550
because nobody
can sing it properly.”

63
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,290
“He kept cutting vocals
and comping and flying

64
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,460
to go see the artists.

65
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,830
And it’s just, like, so grateful
that he didn’t give up.”

66
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,120
“I didn’t really know
about all the drama

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
of finding a vocalist.”

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,000
“I had never heard her music

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,690
until I heard her demo.

70
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,570
So I was like, 
‘Who is Maren Morris?’ ”

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,100
“She sounds really good.”

72
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,960
“The rhythm is so interesting.
‘Looking at you I can't lie.’

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
It’s like walking up stairs.”

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,510
“She was in Nashville.

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,870
So I flew in and had to
fly out that same night.”

76
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,320
“I recommended, like,
a hot chicken place

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,269
that he could check out.”

78
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,300
“She sounds the most like
Sarah of anybody

79
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,640
because she has this rasp
that Sarah has.”

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,910
“We had the final
product, which I sent to everybody,

81
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,400
and I’ve never had a
song where everybody

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,740
felt, like, it was perfect.”

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,455
“Hey, guys.

84
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,330
It’s that time again.

85
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,850
I wanted to show you a
preview to my brand-new song.

86
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,921
Check it out.”

87
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:41,620
“All right.

88
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,330
All right. Thank you, guys.”

89
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,870
“I saw, like, the name come up
in my car, like, before it started playing.

90
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,860
And then was like: ‘Oh my God! Oh my God!’ ”

91
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,040
“ ‘The Middle’ has been like the
fastest-rising song for me

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,540
I think I’ve ever had.”

93
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,765
“See everyone just start to scream
and shout along with it.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,490
It looks like an ’80s concert.”

95
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,120
“This seems crazy.

96
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,910
Like, bits of it were made
in my small apartment.”

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,210
“After it came out,

98
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,270
I went to New York
for the Grammys,

99
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,070
and at the afterparty I
saw her, like, walk past.

100
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,000
And I was, like, never — it’s never
in me to go up to anyone ever,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,450
but I’m, like, ‘I feel like
I’m an idiot if I don’t.’ ”

102
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,767
“And this little girl stopped me.

103
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,350
I hate calling her,
like, a little girl.

104
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,020
She’s 23 years old.”

105
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,360
“I was like, ‘I’m so
sorry to annoy you.’ ”

106
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,430
“In her sweet Australian accent

107
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,760
she’s, like, ‘I’m Sarah, 
I wrote 'The Middle. ’ ”

108
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,750
“And she was, like: ‘Wait.

109
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,140
You’re, you’re the girl in the demo!’

110
00:05:48,140 --> 00:00:00,000
And I was, like, ‘Yeah, that's me!’ ”
