MORNING ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY." NOW TO MY OPENING STATEMENT. YOU KNOW, AMERICANS ELECTED THE OUTSIDER BUSINESSMAN PRESIDENT. WHY? TO BORROW A PHRASE FROM THE MAN HIMSELF. WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE? FACTORIES WERE CLOSING DOWN, JOBS AND MANUFACTURING WERE BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS, AND IN TRADE, CHINA WAS SUCKING US DRY. THE OBAMA FOLKS CALLED IT A HEALTHY ECONOMY BUT THERE WAS BARELY A PULSE. 1% ANNUAL GDP GROWTH WAS THE NEW NORMAL AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WARNED DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION WOULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR ALL AMERICANS. SOME OF THOSE JOBS OF THE PAST ARE JUST NOT GOING TO COME BACK. AND WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS LIKE THE PERSON YOU JUST MENTIONED WHO I'M NOT GOING TO ADVERTISE FOR THAT HE'S GOING TO BRING ALL THESE JOBS BACK. HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING TO DO THERE IS NO ANSWER TO IT. HE JUST SAYS I AM GOING TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL. WHAT MAGIC WAND DO YOU HAVE? AND USUALLY THE ANSWER IS HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER. I WANT TO YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS, DON'T LET A FRIEND VOTE TRUMP. SO HERE IS THE DEAL. HE CAN'T ESCAPE THE MATH. MATH CAN BE KIND OF AND ECONOMISTS LEFT, RIGHT, IN THE MIDDLE, ALL SAY THE SAME THING. THAT TRUMP'S POLICIES WOULD THAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. IN THE EVENT DONALD WINS I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THE MARKETS TANK. HIS TAX PLAN IN COMBINATION WITH HIS REFUSAL TO REFORM ENTITLEMENTS AND HONESTLY ADDRESS SPENDING WOULD BALLOON THE DEFICIT AND THE NATIONAL DEBT. SO EVEN THOUGH DONALD TRUMP IS OFFERED VERY FEW SPECIFIC ECONOMIC PLANS, WHAT LITTLE HE HAS SAID IS ENOUGH TO KNOW HE WOULD BE VERY BAD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. JUDGE JEANINE: THEN WAS PAUL KRUGMAN, A NOBEL PRIZE WING ECONOMIST. HE SAID THE STOCK MARKET WILL PLUMMET AND NEVER RECOVER FROM THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. SO WE ARE VERY PROBABLY LOOKING AT A GLOBAL RESPECIAL NO END IN HATRED OF DONALD TRUMP, THEY FORGET DECADES OF TRAINING IN THEIR OWN FIELD. AS AMERICA SURGES FORWARD WITH MORE JOBS THAN PEOPLE TO FILL THEM, WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND OFF FOOD STAMPS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WORK. THE LEFT, THEY RANT AND PROTEST AND CREATE CHAOS. THP. THEY THROW PEOPLE OUT OF THEY EVEN GO TO CHURCH AND SAY GOD SENT THEM TO DESTROY DONALD ECONOMIC SUCCESS. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS MAKE NOISE. BUT IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN BACKGROUND NOISE. WHITE NOISE. THE TRUTH? NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM. HIS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND HIS POPULARITY JUST KEEPS GOING UP. AFTER HE MET WITH PUTIN AND WAS PUNISHABLE BY DEATH, HIS NUMBERS THEIR YELLING AND SCREAMING IS NOTHING BUT A DISTRACTION, NOBODY CARES. WE CARE ABOUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, PAYING THE RENT, THE MORTGAGE, PAYING FOR KIDS CLOTHING FOR SCHOOL. BUT NO, THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHORES AND PORN STARS OR A LAWYER THEY ARE SQUEEZING SO TIGHT HE'LL CONFESS TO SINKING WHACK-A-MOLE RUSSIA COLLUSION NONSENSE AND THE HATERS CONTINUE TO HATE, THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 45th OUTSIDER PRESIDENT OFTEN WORK WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF HIS OWN PARTY HAS PRODUCED A GDP THAT NO ONE THOUGHT POSSIBLE, 4.1%. AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO HIT THE HIGHEST AVERAGE GROWTH RATE IN OVER 13 YEARS. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY TO THAT, BARACK, HILLARY AND ALL YOU GENIUSES? WE ARE FLYING FOLKS. THIS IS THE AMERICA DONALD TRUMP HAD IN MIND WHEN HE ASKED US,
