YESTERDAY WE PRESENTED THE
EVIDENCE THAT ATTY.
GEN.
JEFF SESSIONS HAD LIED ABOUT HIS
KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNICATIONS
BETWEEN RUSSIAN OFFICIALS AND
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DURING
THE LAST ELECTION.
THAT LIE CONSTITUTED A FEDERAL
CRIME BECAUSE IT HAPPENED WHILE
HE WAS UNDER OATH AND TESTIFYING
BEFORE THE SENATE.
THEN WE HAVE THE VIDEO OF AL
FRANKEN TALKING WITH JEFF
SESSIONS WHERE HE SAYS HE HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE OF COMMUNICATIONS
DESPITE THE FACT HE WAS THE ONE
WHO VEHEMENTLY SHUT DOWN THAT
DISCUSSION AT A NATIONAL
SECURITY MEETING BACK
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
WAS INTERESTING WHEN IT WAS
REVEALED THAT THROUGH AN
INTERMEDIARY WE LEARNED THAT
SESSIONS RECALLED 単 THAT SOURCE
LATER CLARIFIED 単 IT'S NOT
IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO ME IF THAT
IS A BACKTRACK BECAUSE OF THE
REACTION TO SESSIONS SAYING
I DID ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT.
THEY SEEM TO BE TRYING TO MUDDY
THE WATERS A LITTLE BIT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LEARNED IN
THE INTERIM THAT THAT IS A
FEDERAL CRIME.
>>
IT IS WONDERFULLY PREPOSTEROUS,
THE LAST STATEMENT.
WAIT, HOW DOES HE KNOW HE DID SO
IF HE DOESN'T RECALL IT?
>>I'M NOT SURE THAT SOURCE KNOWS
WHAT THE WORD CLARIFIES MEANS.
>> THAT IDEA OF POON AND TRUMP
MEETING, I SPITE THAT, BUT
I DON'T REMEMBER IF I DID.
THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.
THAT MEANS I LIED AND HENCE I
CAN BE THROWN OUT OF OFFICE.
>>UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE
FIRST TIME HE HAS HAD A
PROBLEM WITH HIS MEMORY.
HE INITIALLY DURING
SOME OF HIS EARLY 単
BACK WHEN HE WAS TRYING
TO BECOME ATTY.
GEN.
SAID HE HAD HAD NO CONTACT.
THAT IT WAS I MET WITH THE
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR BUT I DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN, THEN I
DID MEET WITH THE RUSSIAN AMB.
AND WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT
INTERFERENCE.
THE GOALPOST KEPT MOVING.
NOW AL FRANKEN HAS A RESPONSE
SAYING THIS.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY
WOULD'VE IN THE PRESENT
FIRST PLACE, BUT THAT ISN'T THE
POINT.
NORMALLY WHEN I START WITH
THAT TONE OF
VOICE I AM BEING SARCASTIC.
HE
IS ON THE OLDER SIDE, MAYBE HIS
MEMORY IS SKETCHY?
WHEN YOU
VEHEMENTLY SHUT DOWN DISCUSSION
DURING ONE OF THE FEW
HIGH-PROFILE MEETINGS OF THIS
GROUP, 単 I WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT
AS HE IN JAIL.
ACTUAL CREDIT WE SHOULD GIVE US
ALL FRANKEN FOR DOING A GOOD JOB
AND QUESTIONING.
GREAT JOB THERE.
IF YOU DON'T RECALL THE
REPUBLICANS THINK THAT LYING
UNDER OATH IS ONE OF THE WORST
CRIMES AND YOU SHOULD BE
IMMEDIATELY IMPEACHED FOR IT.
THEY IMPEACHED BILL CLINTON FOR
LYING UNDER OATH.
BY THEIR OWN STANDARDS JEFF
SESSIONS SHOULD IMPEACH HIMSELF.
