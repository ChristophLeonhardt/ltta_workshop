yeah I was always<font color="#E5E5E5"> that teacher's pet</font>

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,130
little twerp in class loved to be called

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,740
on to read out loud from the textbook

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,599
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was different when mrs.</font>

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,550
Nord shout out to mrs. Nord<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me to</font>

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,110
read this particular passage from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,230
textbook I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feel that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heat on</font>

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,539
the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neck from everyone just</font>

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,269
staring<font color="#CCCCCC"> at me because of course when we</font>

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,090
turn to page 50 whatever it was the

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,730
slavery chapter it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slavery</font>

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,560
chapter and I think that was the first

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,440
time that I just awash in a sea of beige

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 year olds felt so keenly aware that I</font>

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person of color in the room</font>

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,030
I mean by now I had years of experience

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,890
being the only black kid in the class

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,930
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> young buck friend and the friend</font>

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,730
group even when I got to college and

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,250
finally got a chance to befriend Latinas

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> filipinas and otherwise non-white</font>

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,680
people I still was often the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only black</font>

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,780
girl there I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend transferred to</font>

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,820
another school because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was so sick</font>

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,180
of being a sassy black friend of being

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,129
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the room now in middle</font>

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,510
school the Urban League chapter in my

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,310
honor high-achieving kids of color I was

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,930
long as invited which I actually

31
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,450
resented a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I hated getting</font>

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,950
called out for being a person of<font color="#E5E5E5"> color</font>

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,380
at that point in my life but no can't

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't stop getting those good</font>

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">go my dad made an offhand kind of joke</font>

37
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,520
about how he was probably gonna be the

<font color="#CCCCCC">only white face in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and my</font>

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,409
still is the only one in the room more

41
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,159
often than she is not shut it down she's

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">been in the reverse situation a million</font>

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,700
times and nobody thought that that

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,110
should be weird when we talk about

45
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,820
representation I feel like there's a

46
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,490
backlash in certain circles like that we

47
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,320
have enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> by now right you get too</font>

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,000

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,930
