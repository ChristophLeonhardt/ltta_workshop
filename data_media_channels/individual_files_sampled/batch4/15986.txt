first of all she's a woman a 39 year old vegan vegetarian bodybuilder those two don't go together often animal rights activists from Iran so while she posed in ominous outfits that might look like this one might be a Muslim terrorist or this one in camouflage gear I don't think that's what motivated her at all I think she was quirky to the point of being kooky and if she was an extremist it was in her animal rights activism like this here she is that's her on the right there wearing a wig I think at a PETA rally that's says her People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals as an animal rights extremist group she really is dramatic and weird I mean I'm an e Iranian vegan bodybuilder animal rights YouTube models are there in the world just one I thinking and now there's none so she attacked YouTube because she hated YouTube even though she was a YouTube star at least in her own mind this is her this is her very soon after the attack YouTube deleted her channel and so did Facebook and other social media but not before some people managed to grab all these videos some of them are heard doing exercises like this one some of her dancing some of our animal rights videos they're all really so quirky so unselfconscious I actually found myself riveted because they're so bad and she's so earnest about them - does she know how bad they were I don't know I don't think it was meant to be a joke but but here take away this deep discharge off this does one on this side you should you laugh oh boy you look stunning I don't know what to make of her she had biceps look at that she had bunnies look at that she had okay beef probably the wrong word to use for vegetarian isn't it but she loved YouTube and she hated it too I mean you've got me pretty hardcore to literally protest against YouTube's policies out on the street she said they were suppressing her truth and they were discriminating against her and what she was saying in her videos and she had some proof by the way she showed it detailed reports that YouTube was playing her videos hundreds of thousands of times but only paid her a grand total of ten cents in ad money I know the feeling of course YouTube demonetised our videos here the rabble - as they did the most conservative political commentators they just won't sell ads on our videos they claim the materialists offensive this really bothered this woman because I think she truly believed she could be some sort of a star and maybe even make a living off it and I think it bothered her ideologically - she was a kook about her ideas but she did believe in them and she thought YouTube was censoring her ideas and it absolutely wouldn't surprise me if they actually were listen they're just for a moment on that they it restricted my ab workout video a video that has nothing bad in it nothing since well why did it add because it's got famous and was getting many views I contacted support team and they also said the same thing they are some inappropriate things in your video videos many singers like Nicki Minaj Miley and many others have since well since so inappropriate for children to watch don't get edgy restrictive but my videos my Warcraft video gets it restricted there's a weird video including what looks like a Star of David she obviously was not Jewish but was rather from Iran not Persian she was of the Azaria's ethnicity and almost certainly Muslim - anyways I I'm in no way endorsing her violence of course I'm just showing you what she claims motivated her that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
