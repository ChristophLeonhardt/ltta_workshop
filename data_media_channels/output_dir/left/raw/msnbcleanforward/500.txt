189
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,460
working around the clock now

190
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">interviewing people taking the results</font>

191
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,570
of those interviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> chronicling them</font>

192
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information is going through the</font>

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,640
week to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare a report and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then send</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">investigations these interviews</font>

198
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,620
contemporaneously they're being

199
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,750
submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there may be direction and</font>

200
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,220

202

203
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to conduct their</font>

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">investigation the parameters may change</font>

205
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,380
as the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes back in into the</font>

206
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,520
White House through the Department of

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,650
Justice so somewhere tell me there is a

208
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">whiteboard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a map</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the nation and</font>

209
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,670
there's a red<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin on New Haven</font>

210
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,590

213
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Maryland and the environs there's a red</font>

216
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,890
re-interviewing her and that kind of

00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,479
thing imagine this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being worked out</font>

218
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,549
of FBI headquarters as a central nucleus

219
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,349
for this and there are leads that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">when results of interviews come back if</font>

222
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
the agents have the authority and the

<font color="#E5E5E5">answer all the questions then</font>

227

263
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:21,060

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,920
illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Cavanaugh and his team got</font>

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,470
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's how close did he come</font>

277
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,589
to helping them refresh their memory he

278
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:03,810
shouldn't have reached out directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

279
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,699
should have left<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legal team</font>

280
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

281
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,860
extraordinary for a sitting federal

282
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,630
judge it would but it sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

283
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">might have happened that he might have</font>

284
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,860
reached out<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly I mean we're based</font>

285
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,890
on the reporting it says that her<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

286
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">referred to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brett</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reaching out to her so</font>

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,900
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> look we don't know for sure but</font>

288
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something that needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

289
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,010
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if he did that's highly</font>

290
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,580
highly inappropriate and could border on

291
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,850
illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his team doing that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

292
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,100
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they said if they were</font>

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,010
simply asking questions what do you

294
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,660
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are perfectly</font>

295
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">legitimate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if they were</font>

296
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,790
pressuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in any way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they</font>

297
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,280
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to refresh their memories or</font>

298
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,830
get their<font color="#E5E5E5"> story straight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a big</font>

299
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">no-no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it simply and the</font>

300
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,900
allegation<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes out in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the New Yorker</font>

301
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,730
he says<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when he first learned</font>

302
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but any of these texts would</font>

303
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,740
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doubt it would I mean again</font>

304
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,080
it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know we're hearing</font>

305
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this from someone who has the text this</font>

306
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is why this investigation is so</font>

307
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,170
important and someone needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

308
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,630
speak directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the person who has the</font>

309
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,070
text which it sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they've been</font>

310
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to reach the FBI and it hasn't</font>

311
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened yet</font>

312
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's a little troubling and my</font>

313
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,330
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

314
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,770
limits<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were put on the FBI</font>

315
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,630
initially so now hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be</font>

316
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,730
free to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these witnesses directly</font>

317
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,720
but yes if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did know about</font>

318
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">this ahead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but testified that he</font>

319
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,530
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until the time of</font>

320
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the New Yorker look that's definitely</font>

321
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,410
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> true could you prove</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a perjury case</font>

322
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,090
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

323
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,010
that case but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the standard</font>

324
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">here the standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is as we've all been</font>

325
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,600
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this a person who is being</font>

326
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,030
forthright and honest and should be on

327
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,370
the Supreme<font color="#CCCCCC"> Court and I think the</font>

328
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,710
growing impression over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and over is that</font>

329
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was not completely forthright in his</font>

330
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,160
testimony
