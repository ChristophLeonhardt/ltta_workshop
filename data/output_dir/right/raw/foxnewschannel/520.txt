00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,789
WHAT THEY HAVE ENDURED OUGHT TO

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,126
BE CONSIDERED BY ALL OF US AS

24
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,630
UNACCEPTABLE AND A POOR

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,833
REFLECTION ON THE STATE OF

26
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,901

69
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,881
MS. FORD FIRST RAISED HER

70
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,786

84
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:13,560
THIS LETTER WAS SECRET FROM JUL,

85
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,399
JULY 30TH -- SEPTEMBER 15, WHEN

86
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,000
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,535
THE RANKING MEMBER TOOK NO

00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:21,869

00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,003
THE LETTER WASN'T SHARED WITH ME

90
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,071
YOUR COLLEAGUES OR MY STAFF.

91
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,341
THESE ALLEGATIONS COULD HAVE

92
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,478
BEEN INVESTIGATED IN A WAY THAT

93
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,482
MAINTAINS THE CONFIDENTIALITY

94
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,118
THAT DR. FORD REQUESTED.

95
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:39,153
BEFORE HIS HEARING, JUDGE

96
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,423
KAVANAUGH MET PRIVATELY WITH 65

97
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,158
SENATORS, INCLUDING THE RANKING

98
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:44,759
MEMBER.

99
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,594
BUT THE RANKING MEMBER HE DIDN'T

100
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,561
ASK JUDGE KAVANAUGH ABOUT THE

101
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,262
ALLEGATIONS WHEN SHE MET WITH

102
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,464
HIM PRIVATELY IN AUGUST.

103
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,767
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

104
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,536
HELD HER THERE FOR A FROM

JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED FOR

107
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,411
MORE THAN 32 HOURS IN PUBLIC.

108
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,280
WE HELD A CLOSED SESSION FOR

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,916
MEMBERS TO ASK SENSITIVE

110
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,086
QUESTIONS ON THE LAST EVENING,

111
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:12,987
WHICH THE RANKING MEMBER DID NOT

112
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:13,320
ATTEND.

113
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,757
IT JUDGE KAVANAUGH ANSWERED

114
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,728
NEARLY 1300 WRITTEN QUESTIONS

115
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:21,495
SUBMITTED BY SENATORS AFTER THE

116
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,298
HEARING.

117
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,267
MORE THAN ALL PRIOR NOMINEES.

118
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,370
THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD, WE DID

119
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,338
NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RANKING

120
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:33,141
MEMBERS OF SECRET EVIDENCE.

121
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:35,109
THEN, ONLY AT THE 11TH HOUR, ON

122
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,946
THE EVENING OF HIS CONFIRMATION

123
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,081
BOARD, DID THE RANKING MEMBER

124
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,850
REFER THE ALLEGATIONS TO THE FB

125
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,951
FBI.

126
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,120
AND THEN, SADLY, THE ALLEGATIONS

127
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,256
WERE LINKED TO THE PRESS.

128
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:53,561
THAT IS WHERE DR. FORD WAS

129
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:53,962
MISTREATED.

130
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,431
THIS IS A SHAMBLE WAY TO TREAT

131
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:58,499
OUR WITNESS, WHO INSISTED ON

132
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:02,670
CONFIDENTIALITY.

133
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,241
AND OF COURSE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH,

134
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,675
WHO HAS HAD TO ADDRESS THESE

135
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:11,412
ALLEGATIONS, IN THE MIDST OF A

136
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:12,413
MEDIA CIRCUS.

137
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,148
WHEN I RECEIVED DR. FORD LETTER

138
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:14,983
ON SEPTEMBER THE 13TH, MY STAFF

139
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,318
AND I RECOGNIZED THE SERIOUSNESS

140
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:21,156
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AND

141
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:21,723
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN OUR

142
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:25,560
COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION WITH

143
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,761
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE HAS

144
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,697
HANDLED SUCH ALLEGATIONS IN THE

145
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:29,764
PAST.

146
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,567
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY IT, THE

147
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,935
DEMOCRATIC SIDE REFUSED TO

148
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,770
PARTICIPATE AND WHAT SHOULD HAVE

149
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,338
BEEN A BIPARTISAN INVESTIGATION.

150
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,874
AS FAR AS I KNOW ON ALL OF OUR

151
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:40,975
JUDGESHIPS THROUGHOUT AT LEAST

152
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,377
THE LAST FOUR YEARS OR THREE

153
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:44,379
YEARS, THAT HAS BEEN THE WAY IT

154
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,647
HAS BEEN HANDLED.

155
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:48,717
AFTER DR. FORD'S IDENTITY BECAME

156
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:49,451
PUBLIC, MY STAFF CONTACTED ALL

157
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:53,521
THE INDIVIDUALS SHE SAID I

158
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,124
ATTENDED THE 1982 PARTY

159
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,125
DESCRIBED IN

160
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,293
"THE WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE.

161
00:05:58,293 --> 00:05:58,993
IT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IMMEDIATELY

162
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,663
YOU SUBMITTED IT TO AN INTERVIEW

163
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:05,033
UNDER PENALTY FOR ANY KNOWINGLY

164
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,568
FALSE STATEMENTS.

165
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,936
HE DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS

166
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:08,370
CATEGORICALLY.

167
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,972
DEMOCRATIC STAFF WAS

168
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:11,840
PARTICIPATING, AND COULD HAVE

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,941
ASKED ANY QUESTIONS THAT THEY

170
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:16,478
WANTED TO, BUT THEY DECLINED,

171
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:23,685
WHICH LEADS ME THEN TO WONDER IF

172
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:24,386
THEY ARE REALLY CONCERNED WITH

173
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,120
GOING TO THE TRUTH, WHY WOULDN'T

174
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,155
YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE ACCUSED?

175
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:27,923
THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURE IS

176
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,359
WHAT THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS DOES

177
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,695
WHEN WE RECEIVE ALLEGATIONS OF

178
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:34,529
WRONGDOING.

179
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,064
MY STAFF REACHED OUT TO OTHER

180
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:39,167
INDIVIDUALS ALLEGEDLY AT THE

181
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,436
PARTY, JUDGE PATRICK SMITH,

LELAND KAISER, ALL THREE

183
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:44,206
SUBMITTED STATEMENTS TO THE

184
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:49,378
SENATE UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY,

185
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,979
DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE

186
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,449
EVENTS DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD.

187
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,319
DR. FORD'S LIFELONG FRIEND

188
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:57,986
STATED THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW

189
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,923
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND IT DOESN'T

190
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:01,924
RECALL EVER ATTENDING A PARTY

191
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,692
WITH HIM.

192
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:07,529
MY STAFF MADE REPEATED REQUESTS

193
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,866
TO DR. FORD IT DURING THE 11

194
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:11,166
DAYS.

195
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:17,473
TAKING TESTIMONY.

196
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:20,075
PRESENTING ALLEGATIONS TO

197
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,143
CONGRESS.

198
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:23,145
I NEVERTHELESS HONORED HER

199
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:24,947
REQUEST FOR A PUBLIC HEARING.

200
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:25,914
SO DR. FORD TODAY HAS THE

201
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:28,050
OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT HER

202
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,320
ALLEGATIONS UNDER OATH.

203
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,554
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE JUDICIARY

204
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,723
COMMITTEE WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT

205
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:38,127
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS INTO

206
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:41,130
ALLEGATIONS.

207
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,830
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS INTO

208
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,231
ALLEGATIONS.

209
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,600
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES STATED

210
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,069
THEIR DESIRES TO OBSTRUCT

211
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,971
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION BY ANY

212
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:53,942
MEANS NECESSARY.

213
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:56,478
FBI INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE

214
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:57,112
ALLEGATIONS.

215
00:07:57,112 --> 00:08:00,282
BUT I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO FORCE

216
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:05,855
EDGE.

217
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,623
MOREOVER, ONCE THE ALLEGATIONS

218
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:11,527
BECAME PUBLIC, IT WAS EASY TO

219
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,194
IDENTIFY ALL OF THE ALLEGED

220
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:15,664
WITNESSES AND CONDUCT OUR OWN

221
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,166
INVESTIGATIONS.

222
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:17,933
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS

223
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:21,637
BEEN LED TO BELIEVE, THE FBI

224
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:24,140
DOES NOT PERFORM CREDIBILITY

225
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,508
ASSESSMENTS OR VERIFY THE TRUTH

226
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:27,243
OF ANY OF THE EVENTS IN THESE

227
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:31,881
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS.

228
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:35,885
THE CHAIRMAN, JOE BIDEN, DURING

229
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:36,586
JUSTICE THOMAS' CONFIRMATION

230
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,322
HEARING, THIS IS WHAT THE

231
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,923
SENATOR SAID.

232
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:41,823
"THE NEXT PERSON WHO REFERS TO

233
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:47,063
AN FBI REPORT AS BEING WORTH

234
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:49,131
ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T

235
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:49,665
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

236
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,635
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN

237
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:56,205
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE REACH A

238
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:59,509
CONCLUSION, PERIOD.

239
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:06,349
THEY SAY HE SAID, SHE SAID, THEY

240
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:06,649
SAID.

241
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,817
SO WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AN FBI

242
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:11,788
REPORT FOR YOU, UNDERSTAND THEY

243
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,156
DO NOT.

244
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,724
THEY DO NOT.

245
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:16,859
THEY DO NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS.

246
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:23,166
THEY DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATION

247
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:23,633
RECOMMENDATIONS.

248
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:24,367
THE FBI THEN PROVIDED US WITH

249
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:26,569
THE ALLEGATIONS.

250
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:27,937
NOW IT IS UP TO THE SENATE TO

251
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:30,907
ASSESS THEIR CREDIBILITY.

252
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:33,776
WHICH BRINGS US TO THIS VERY

253
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:34,310
TIME.

254
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,579
I LOOK FORWARD TO A FAIR AND

255
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:37,180
RESPECTFUL HEARING.

256
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,148
THAT IS WHAT WE PROMISED

257
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:40,149
DR. FORD.

258
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:40,783
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

259
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:43,152
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

260
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:46,522
AN EXPERT ON THIS SIDE IS

261
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:48,892
INVESTIGATING SEX CRIMES WILL BE

262
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:49,592
QUESTIONING THE WITNESS.

263
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:53,530
I SEE NO BASIS FOR COMPLAINT,

264
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,533
OTHER THAN JUST PLAIN POLITICS.

265
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,467
THE TESTIMONY WE WILL HEAR TODAY

266
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:01,704
CONCERNS ALLEGATIONS OF

267
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:06,309
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

268
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:06,976
A VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS.

269
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:07,677
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX

270
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:08,778
AND SENSITIVE SUBJECT TO

271
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,246
DISCUSS, AND IS NOT AN EASY ONE

272
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:10,647
TO DISCUSS.

273
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,582
THAT IS WHY THE SENATORS ON THE

274
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:16,653
SIDE OF THE DICE AND BELIEVE AN

275
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,755
EXPERT WHO HAS DEEP EXPERIENCE

276
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:19,456
AND TRAINING IN INTERVIEWING

277
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:21,257
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

278
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:24,294
INVESTIGATING A SEXUAL ASSAULT

279
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:27,697
ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE ASKING

280
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:28,965
QUESTIONS.

281
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,100
THIS WILL BE IN STARK CONTRAST

282
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,402
TO THE GRANDSTANDING AND CHAOS

283
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,271
THAT WE SAW FROM THE OTHER SIDE

284
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,506
DURING THE PREVIOUS FOUR DAYS IN

285
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,976
THIS HEARING PROCESS.

286
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,244
I CAN THINK OF NO ONE BETTER

287
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:44,381
EQUIPPED TO QUESTION THE

288
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:44,881
WITNESSES.

289
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,917
MS. MITCHELL IS A CAREER

290
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,386
PROSECUTOR, CIVIL SERVANT, WITH

291
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:51,321
DECADES OF EXPERIENCE,

292
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:55,659
INVESTIGATING SEX CRIMES.

293
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:58,195
SHE IS DEDICATED TO SEEKING

294
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:02,232
JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF THESE

295
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:02,566
CRIMES.

296
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:08,539
SHE WAS A DIVISION CHIEF IN THE

297
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,307
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, WHICH IT

298
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:11,842
PROSECUTES SEX CRIMES AND FAMILY

299
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:13,277
VIOLENCE.

300
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:18,882
THEN DEMOCRATIC SENATOR

301
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:19,550
SENATOR NAPOLITANO, WE

302
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,584
PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE HER AS THE

303
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:21,251
OUTSTANDING ARIZONA

304
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:25,055
SEXUAL ASSAULT PROSECUTOR.

305
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,291
AND SHE HAS SPENT YEARS

306
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,994
INSTRUCTING PROSECUTORS AND A

00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,466
TO PROPERLY INTERVIEW VICTIMS OF

309
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:39,536
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE.

310
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:41,338
I LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE

311
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:41,672
HEARING.

312
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:44,541
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO

313
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,943
OTHER PUBLIC ALLEGATIONS.

314
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:49,113
AT TODAY'S HEARING WAS SCHEDULED

315
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,749

TESTIMONY WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF

318
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,753
THIS HEARING.

319
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:58,355
WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

320
00:11:58,355 --> 00:11:59,156
INVESTIGATE OTHER ALLEGATIONS.

321
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:02,359
AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE NOT HAD

322
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,927
COOPERATION FROM ATTORNEYS

323
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:04,728
REPRESENTING OTHER CLIENTS.

324
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:07,331
THEY HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO

325
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:11,268
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CLAIMS.

326
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:12,970
SHE HAS TRIED TO SECURE

327
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,908

338
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:42,166
INTERVIEWS.

339
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,201
THE COMMITTEE CAN'T DO AN

340
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,136
INVESTIGATION IF THEY ARE

341
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:46,570
STONEWALLING.

342
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,573
I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT

343
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:52,977
WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SEEK

344
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:56,914

00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:04,488
CALL THE BI REPORTS.

347
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:05,756
THE WITNESSES SHOULD KNOW, WHEN

348
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:08,526
