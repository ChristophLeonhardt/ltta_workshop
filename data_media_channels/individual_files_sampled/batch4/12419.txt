let's talk about some of the potential nominees that President Trump is considering so according to Fred Barnes over at the Weekly Standard the White House is now narrowed down its list of potential Supreme Court nominees to a top five Brett Kavanaugh who's 53 on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals I'm Wolf APAR who is 49 on the Sixth Circuit Amy Barrett who's 46 on the Seventh Circuit Thomas Hardiman 52 on the Third Circuit and Raymond Catholic 51 on the Sixth Circuit so all these folks are relatively young you figure that all of them will spend probably 30 years on the court barring serious health problems this is why the idea that Trump gets to shape the court for a full generation here is exactly right now all of that assumes of course that Chief Justice Roberts isn't going to become a Kennedy like swing vote which i think is the dubious assumption but it's possible that you may actually have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the first time in legitimately generations so here is what we know about the people who are being discussed Brett Kavanaugh is apparently the front-runner he is also the person who is the most I see okay so I do not think the president should select Brett Kavanaugh of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals he's a former clerk for Justice Kennedy he was elevated to the federal bench in 2006 after a three-year delay the reason his nomination was delayed was because Democrats were upset over the fact that Cavanaugh used to work for Ken Starr in the office of the Solicitor General and he had the temerity to say that the Clinton administration targeted a Ken Starr so Cavanaugh has been on the court for quite a while his long record he's offered about three hundred decisions he recently dissented when the circuit decided that a seventeen-year-old the legal immigrant detainee had a right to an abortion he said that the decision was quote based on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong he held in 2011 that the Washington DC ban on semi-automatic rifles and its gun registration requirement were unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's Heller decision which recognized that the Second Amendment to the Constitution was an individual right all of these are good decisions he also held that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau structure was unconstitutional which of course is true as well and holds administrative decision making to a minimum okay Kavanagh here here's where it starts to get a little bit a little bit dicey Cavanaugh like Chief Justice Roberts is known for working across the aisle he is on the downside apparently a general believer in Chevron deference Chevron deference is the idea that you have these administrative courts these administrative law courts they get to decide your fate and you can't appeal that directly to the judiciary so administrative law courts exist in the executive branch there's a whole branch of thought that says Chevron deference is stupid that if something is decide by for example the EPA that is reviewable by a judge because the EPA is not a judicial system the EPA is a regulatory system Cavanaugh reportedly does not use textualist methods nearly as much as conservatives might wish and worst he upheld Obamacare and sisal versus Department of Health and Human Services as well as seven Skye versus holder in which he may have actually crafted the rationale that Chief Justice Roberts eventually used in calling the Obamacare penalties attacks remember that Chief Justice Roberts rewrote Obamacare to make it constitutional suggesting that it was a tax rather than a penalty and it appears that Cavanaugh may have actually created that may have actually created that rationale so I'm not saying the Kavanagh it would certainly be another Chief Justice Roberts but I think it's more likely he would be another Roberts than another Gorsuch hey now a mullah par he's relatively he's relatively new to the appellate courts he voted to uphold Ohio's method of legal and injection lethal injection and a Michigan Government's meetings opening with the Christian prayer he said that's legal as well he's ruled that monetary donations our form of protected speech under the First Amendment now because the powers record is relatively thin on the court of appeals he's only appointed in the last year and a half there's not much to go on with regard to issues like abortion and religious freedom with that said Professor Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt Law School described the part is very Scalia like and very Thomas like and sipar has criticized Richard Posner as pragmatism Posner is on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and is a terrible judge he criticized Posner's pragmatism in judicial theory because using pragmatism rather than text would quote elevate judges to the position of Co legislature which is exactly right judges should not be legislating they should be interpreting the law as it is written he has is it textualist was praised scalia himself so if i have to choose between the par and Cavanaugh I choose the par the best of the bunch it seems to me is Amy Barrett
