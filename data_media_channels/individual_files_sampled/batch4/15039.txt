welcome to two classified live the best live streaming show on the Internet as voted by well me and you I think we are the best live streaming show on the web alright we're gonna have a really really you know I already like how this show is starting off today John space already has what looks like a scotch on the rocks or a bourbon on the rocks for me that is awesome that is absolutely absolutely awesome I love this I love starting a show with somebody who's got a bourbon on the rocks for me how can you beat that well big day big big day yesterday here in the United States cuz I don't we have a lot of international people tuning in every day president Trump picks Brett Kavanaugh from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals nominates him to fill the seat of Justice Anthony Kennedy who retired on the United States Supreme Court this is big this is big and it has the left absolutely hysterical hysterical hello say my name cat of the year thanks for watching I bet you are the cat of the year that you are native engines as good morning brothers and sisters in Canada peace and love from the south of you yeah good morning to the world we had yesterday we had Australia New Zealand the UK France Canada the United States we had one other I can't remember where but I know we had a pretty good international audience and we had South Africa last weekend well Oh Kavanagh is nominated to the Supreme Court has liberals absolutely hysterical and this is pretty priceless because Cavanaugh was about the most moderate the Trump had that list if you remember from the Federalist Society Heritage Foundation also chimed in on that early on this goes back to the 2016 campaign and the list was the brainchild of White House Counsel Don McGann he was then being your counsel to the Trump campaign now I haven't always been a Dan McGann fan but I think on this one he knocked it out of the park with proposing this list because there were a lot of people who were concerned about Donald Trump's conservative bona fides and whether or not he would have appointed true conservatives to the Supreme Court well to put that to bed to alleviate those concerns McGann and Trump came up with a strategy whereby the Federalist Society heritage and other conservatives people like Senator Michael Lee from Utah the senator Ted Cruz from Texas would all be able to chime in and give their input on who should be on the list of those Trump would nominate to the Supreme Court should there be a vacancy well Trump had two vacancies of course the tragic vacancy when Anthony Scalia died a legal conservative legal giant and now Anthony Kennedy retiring just as a matter of course an older guy it was just he's been on the court decades just time to go it appears from appointed to very conservative people now gorsek gorsek has been called scalia 2.0 people like Hugh youatt are calling Cavanaugh Roberts 2.0 that concerns me having a does seem like the most moderate of the bunch however dr. slappy says good morning Johnny company good morning John Zeeland good morning and Cavanaugh seems like the most moderate of using communications for Donald Trump jr. and he's a good buddy of mine and he put out a tweet this morning that I thought was outstanding let me find it and I will read it to you see if I could find it but he really was he said Cavanaugh's Gorsuch part two Great Scott is pick he's an originalist and a textualist he's a super superstar on deconstructing the administrative state and I hate to break at the Democrats and their friends in the media no matter what you do he will be our next Supreme Court justice that from a nice Arabian who left the White House political shop only about a year or so so uh he this is what he did for a living he studied these people he worked on these issues now the the pic of Cavanaugh has conservatives well excited they know they're getting somebody that'll protect the Second Amendment they know they're getting somebody that will uh protect the sanctity of life he's going to be an ardent supporter of religious liberty if his prior decisions are indicative of his future decision he's been a pretty conservative guy the concerns too many are that he clerked for Kennedy Kennedy was appointed by Ronald Reagan as a conservative but really became a centrist judge came the the well the dependable swing vote on the court I know many conservatives were a little bit concerned when last night if you didn't watch the nomination of Judge Cavanaugh last night when Trump announced him really not the nomination but if you didn't watch the press conference the event I you should watch it because Trump is a master showman better than PT Barnum he built the suspense and built the suspense and built the suspense in about five minutes before the 9:00 p.m. Eastern announcement last night we pretty much knew it was Cavanaugh his parents were in the audience whereas the families of none of the others that were mentioned were the Associated Press began a report report Cavanaugh NBC Nightly News and they've got somebody inside the White House it's Cavanaugh Cavanaugh is in the White House many many people out there who were hooked in the know in DC we're saying they saw Cavanaugh go in and his parents are there and the same stuff so we knew about five ten minutes before that it was definitively Cavanaugh but Trump still kept the suspense going and then his family kind of popped out a side door never know where they came from but in Cavanaugh's remarks he's seeing tepid he seemed moderate now many on the right hook that as a matter of concern he especially thanked elena kagan far left remember the supreme court because she was the dean who hired him at harvard university i read it differently i read it much differently Cavanaugh's a guy with a young family he's 53 years old very young in judicial terms his wife appears to be his age couple years younger he's got two young daughters there were little kids his girls he wants to be confirmed he wants to present himself as confirmable look he's got 12 years on the deepest 11 or 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals he has a lot the Democrats can use against it he he wrote he authored something like I think the president said last night 300 opinions while sitting on that bench and so the Democrats now have a lot of ammunition against him that was a but to me that's a plus somebody was a long judicial track record has a plus and Wow a brand or just just logged in from Holland so we've got Holland today we've got Canada we've got Holland our friends from Australia New Zealand I'm sure gonna pop on soon enough we had France the UK yesterday I'm sure we'll have those as well but back to the judge so authoring 300 opinions means you've got a long history you can bet your bottom dollar that the Democrats are going to pour through their staffers last night about 11 seconds after Kavanagh was nominated their staffers Democrat staffers went to work they went to work trying to find something wrong with him something to knock him out the Democrats will be spending millions on negative ads they'll be spending millions some of those millions on private investigators digging into every aspect of his life now the FBI I'm sure already done that on behalf of the Trump administration u.s. marshals have helped they provide security they were providing security yesterday to the four finalists and the the vetting process has been going on for quite a while so it's I doubtful the Democrats are gonna find anything plus Cavanaugh appears to have lived a pretty simple and very clean life he and his wife went on their first date he said September 10 2001 they both worked in the White House the next morning after their first date experience of course the 9/11 attacks I coaches basketball for his two young daughters how long CYO basketball Catholic Youth Organization I played in those games a kid in Catholic school how how long until the Democrats start falling on the CYO to eliminate him as a coach out of the year is from Australia great to have you great to have you what time is it knows that I always get confused of that whole thing yeah our old friend Timmy Houten's yeah me too I see your name right Putin's zendo hi Tammy Frankie is it piss of colic good morning Frank but how long until the attacks on Kavanaugh start how long until liberal parents in CYO basketball start pulling their kids out because it's 9:38 in Australia p.m. thank you very much it's um we've gotten to a point where someone isn't allowed to have political views their political views they have to be attacked personally Enoch greetings again from the sunny Golan Heights I love it I love the internationalism of our audience it's awesome and so we've got this guy who appears by all rights and accounts to be a really good guy but for this legal opinions aside for a moment you've got a guy who is a dad a husband a by all accounts are really good one you you've got a guy who is um 908 p.m. I'm sorry Frank is from Canada hey Frank mind all my friends in Canada good morning you've got a guy who by all rights and accounts is a coach he mentors kids he feeds the homeless that's not enough for the left no the left has to viciously attack this guy and watch what's coming now the New York Post editorial board really liked the pic and they said Brett Kavanaugh is an excellent pick for the Supreme Court I thought that you did a great job so I'm gonna read you some of the excerpts they start by saying something it's very true Donald Trump is once again keeping his campaign promises he floated names on a list as to who he would pick for the Supreme Court he's so far picked two names off that list for such and now of course Cavanaugh host rights judge Cavanaugh 53 is widely seen as one of the top legal minds of a generation so much so that now justice Elena Kagan recruited him the teacher Harvard Law where students across the spectrum rave about him though firmly committed to interpreting the Constitution is written he's no ideologue which is why senator Ted Cruz and other hard rightists had been urging Trump to pick someone else but now Democrats will proceed with their preset strategy for fighting any Trump picks charging that confirmation of Cavanaugh 18 guarantees the end of roe v wade and Obamacare well as it should as it should dami says I watched President Trump's announcement last night and it looks like a very normal family the cavanaugh family yeah it does I mean they do that these are just regular people hmm Anthony Emmerich says he's a devoted constitutionalist right people I trust say yes they say they say Anthony it's a great question they say despite his appearing to be conciliatory and moderate that's just his temperament he's a nice guy he's a mild guy but they said he is an obstructionist I'm sorry a constructionist and a textualist he's a constitutionalist he interprets the words as written much like Scalia much like Clarence Thomas much like Alito and so in hills of VA says 53 he'll be there a lifetime look yeah I mean he could be could conceivably have 35 to 40 years on the court medical science getting better it looks like he's a guy in good shape he plays basketball with his kids III think we've got him for at least 30 years got him for at least 30 years and so I I feel pretty comfortable that he'll shake out to be a good judge Hill's the vacc a rhino I don't think he is I don't think he is I've been now now granted the man rode 300 opinions I was doing a lot of research last night insofar as I could I got to be up early to get show ready for you guys but I'm comfortable with what I see so far now the left is losing their mind and the only way Trump could make the left lose their minds even more as if he renames the Department of Defense the War Department and forget about it well Tammy even just mentioned it when he when he replaced his Ruth Bader Ginsburg because I believe that's gonna happen she's 85 years old the woman's been on the bench a long time it's just maybe she wants to relax it seems to be in pretty good shape she falls asleep a lot on the bench and congressional in State of the Union speeches but for an 85 year old she appears to be really sharp and in good shape but don't you just want to retire and take a breather and go relax 1085 and so I think that's what's gonna throw the left over the edge now a couple of things happen last night that are very unsettling outlets like ABC News we're calling the pic controversial before they knew who Trump picked they were doing that about an hour and a half before Senator Bob Casey a Democrat said he was going to vote against the nominee before he knew who the nominee was very troubling when you have the Democratic Party more interested in politics and it was good for the country Janan Breen from Fox News after the announcement was going to do a live shot from the steps of the Supreme Court where people had gathered he was gonna talk to the crowd and do a live event however when she got there he said the mood was sold volatile the aggressive leftist protesters were so volatile he had to cancel he had to cancel let me see if I can find Shannon's reats from last night without getting too sidetracked here because I found that to be yeah she said he said the Democrat activists became so volatile after Trump's nomination she had a cancel live shot and she said she had to go back to in a subsequent tweet got to go back to the safety of her studio and it was the same mobs of leftist protesters illegal illegal immigration activists same story same crazies same stories same crazy and Anthony Emmerich says those for those willing to sacrifice freedom security deserve neither one and Ben Franklin the actual quote was closer to those who are willing to sacrifice essential Liberty for a bit of temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety either a couple of iterations the gist of it though is if you're going to tell government protect me don't cry foul when government takes away your rights don't cry foul now the left like I said we knew they were gonna be unhinged we knew that we knew that but it's a sad day when you've got sitting Democratic senators who are losing their minds before before they even know who they're voting against now you can Bank Harry Reid the former Democratic majority leader in the US Senate for Cavanaugh's confirmation and I say that to Democrats Harry Reid is the one who went nuclear with confirmations that was all him wasn't Republicans who did that right was Democrats who did that when they wanted to ram through Democrat appointees for Barack Obama don't cry foul now Kevin was gonna be approved he's gonna be confirmed that's there's nothing nothing that's gonna stop that we have the majority even John McCain who's on his death bed at this point even John McCain is calling him an impeccable choice impeccable credentials look you can't argue with the guy's background Yale College yeah law school teaches at Harvard Yale and I think it was Princeton Law School's or another guy could be Princeton or Stanford I forget the guy is impeccable impeccable credentials can't attack him on that but what are the Democrats doing well they're parading out the furthest left faction of the party now in my former show off the company classified here on the rebel I had a guy on Christopher Reid chris is an attorney down in birmingham alabama who worked for heritage press is a guy who worked on these lists early on in the Trump campaign he was one of the people who was tasked with doing the research on the judges to put on a list and Chris told me several weeks ago that it was going to be Cavanaugh well last night I spoke to Chris and he has very very well-placed sources in democratic senator Doug Jones's office down in Alabama and Chris told me that Doug Jones is gonna vote for Cavanaugh press also had information that said that Joe Manchin was gonna vote to confirm Cavanaugh the more moderate Democrats the ones from red states like Alabama and West Virginia now is a red state they're gonna break ranks with Chuck Schumer and the crazies in the party and they're gonna vote to confirm Cavanaugh because they know if they don't they're very religious they're evangelical voters in West Virginia and in Alabama will rebel against them they'll rebel against them it was very interesting once we have an overwhelmingly Catholic a premium court now you've got Cavanaugh so too may or Alito there was a list put out this morning I'm gonna try to find that list it was very very interesting and I want to find that for I believe it was Ryan Saavedra over at the Daily Caller who put out a list of who was let me find it was very very interesting hmm and it listed all of the Catholic justices but I'll dig it up I'll find it I don't waste too much time scrolling Twitter could have been Ryan it could have been Josh Kaplan over at Breitbart I read both of them pretty often and the court is now overwhelming Catholic and I think that means very good things for religious liberties now the liberal faction is a soda may or as the Kagan's and the Ginsburg's they're gonna the Breyers they're always gonna vote on a long liberal political line they're not going to vote they're not going to cast their votes their decisions in line with the gun you now Anthony Emmerich says this is an interesting point I will admit that I felt it was wrong the stall and Obama's pick now that I wanted him to choose so I still feel it is wrong Dems are trying to do the same thing now but it wasn't Obama was a lame-duck president historically lame-duck presidents don't get to nominate far leftists in their last few months in office it was the absolutely appropriate thing for the Senate to do this is different this is the first year and a half of Trump's first term Democrats should not be stalling the way the right did install on Kagan and Sotomayor they simply didn't and and you have to look at this in that context not in the context of Merrick garland now interestingly I believe I believe that Merrick garland I had an item here is Cavanaugh's boss over at the Alvar at the DC Circuit over in the DC Circuit so Senator Susan Collins is is also one of the Republicans we've got to be careful of we've got to be really careful of because senator Susan Collins senator Susan Collins is one of those Republicans that might as well have addy behind your name you minded lobby Dee Dee's saying she's gonna do a very careful and thorough review here's the problem for Senator Collins from Maine he voted to confirm him for the DC Circuit now Cavanaugh one of the places I really like them is on the second amendment he said quote gun bans and gun regulations that are not long-standing or sufficiently rooted in text history and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right that is a pretty definitive statement and makes me very very comfortable with judge cabin on an issue I care deeply about the Second Amendment the Second Amendment it's uh it's sad day but let's look at what the Liberals or from The Associated Press liberal liberals rally on court steps against Cavanaugh now here are the Democratic lawmakers who we who addressed this crowd of lunatics who scared off Fox News Gannon Breen first and Gillibrand of New York Cory Booker of New Jersey Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont four of the farthest left morons i I think mansion doe mansion will vote for him North Dakota and Heidi Heitkamp says she's gonna thoroughly review in vet Cavanaugh's record Joe Donnelly of Indiana is gonna review his record in qualifications that's code for their Democrats who are gonna break rank with the for lab break ranks the far left end vote to confirm have enough now Mike Pence is supposed to meet with Cavanaugh today you know the vice president United States is also the president of the Senate but I don't see any problem with Cavanaugh his confirmation none whatsoever the Democrat hysterics are only going to get worse the the I think Trump administration appointees are gonna be harassed more I think judge Cavanaugh and his family are probably gonna be harassed it's uh it's pretty tragic but this is just the way the New Left acts right they don't act like human beings act like savages and I get so many comments this though many comments let me run through some of it was gonna start going to comments in a few minutes here you know Matt Kate Mac Michael kid 12 says Mike Lee would have been better no he wouldn't have I want him in the Senate I want Mike Lee in the US Senate I want Ted Cruz in the US Senate I don't I want to judge who's track record I can see I don't like these wild cards because they're conservative in the Senate they're gonna be conservative as judges doesn't work that way Jeff Sessions was a pretty damn good senator he has been an absolute disaster as Attorney General I want people in these critically important jobs who have a track record a track record we can see we can vet we can review now uh mmm let me see let me see some of these comments here they're coming fast and furiously somebody asked a question we go little off-topic Anthony I'm gonna set I know it's off-topic but how do you feel about Hillary Rodham Clinton supposedly claiming she's gonna run I think Hillary is like that guest at the party is still cracking beers when everyone else has left and the guests are exhausted and just want her to leave and she doesn't realize she's not wanted there anymore he thinks they still want to hang out with her they don't nobody wants Hillary the Democrats don't want her America doesn't want her she's a two-time loser she lost to Obama she lost a trump she needs to go away she probably won't but I hope she doesn't she spells death for the Democrats in 18 and 22 and in 20 he's that hopefully in 22 as well on those midterm he is disastrous but for them great for us now we've got this situation where Ruth Bader Ginsburg like I said is 85 she may very well retire and that's why many many people are speculating that Trump didn't nominate a me koni Barrett I love people love Barrett she's a staunch Catholic she's this she's that I don't know where Barrett stands on anything I don't know why I'm giving she might have been good I don't know he's been a judge for like seventeen months before that she was a law professor at Notre Dame law and another Dame conservative school but the Faculty's pretty liberal student bodies more conservative in the faculty but it's moving left I don't know where she stands toric : Kony was strong on abortion we think but how about everything else I don't like one issue anything one issue anything and I didn't know where koni koni Barrett stood because he didn't really render that many opinions and decisions however if Ginsburg sticks around another three or four years we'll have a much better picture of who Barrett is she's still young she's 46 could be 49 50 at that point still very young for Supreme Court appointee Barrett has time yes time and I think the president did the right thing and not appointing her hmm and he said the Clintons are now flying commercial didn't see security detail in the video yeah they were on a Delta flight apparently Bill Clinton was friendly talking to people they said Hillary was miserable in a corner off to the side but really really the Clintons are just characters of themselves at this point but Benguet thank the Lord I mean imagine imagine if we had Hillary Clinton imagine if we add Hillary Clinton imagine if Hillary Clinton just nominated through Supreme Court justices there go your gun rights I mean imagine a court imagine a court led by Hagan Sotomayor Breyer Ginsberg and two of Hillary's appointees in the burgh fix fix whoo Alito Roberts poor second wooden five actually five you would have had we would have had Roberts Alito Borsig and Thomas and we would have had Sotomayor Ginsburg Kagan and two of Hillary's it would have been a 5-4 court left irreversibly left I don't think Hillary would have gotten an appointment on the right beyond that you'd have replaced here to replace Ginsburg I think Ginsburg would've retired much sooner we would have had a hardcore liberal on the court for much longer and then we risked a Democratic president after Trump second term when Alito and Thomas probably would have retired and then the court would have gone irreversibly left now the two oldest are I believe Breyer and Ginsburg though we might we might very well have we might very well have our own super majority on the court got to play these long games you got to play the math you have to hmm don't tread on me like my analogy of Hillary at a party but I mean that's really that's really who she is that's who she is she's that annoying guy with his feet up on your couch eating Doritos at four o'clock in the morning when all you want to do is clean up nobody nobody even wanted him at the party nobody wanted him there he'd come like to other parties he completely screwed him up it was terrible he's annoying was all about him he made it a disaster he talked about stuff you didn't care about he hangs out with a bunch of people you don't like and then he's got his face stuff with Doritos cracking beers and you just want to clean your house up and go to sleep that is who Hillary Clinton has become and the sad part is at the glorious part I don't know is she really not yet it I mean does she really not get it I don't know Anthony Emmerich says so let's go to some of your questions now why does Trump keep surrounding himself with the same never Trumper Madden if he has Bolton and Pompeyo the Warhawks I like Bolton Pompeo I think you need guys like that in a world like this libertarianism is a great philosophy until it hits the non-interventionist non-interventionism is a wonderful concept but in reality impractical we live in a very dangerous and technological world there are bad actors out there you got to do it to them before they do it to us because they're gonna do it to us and non-interventionism is almost liberal in its naivety ideologically liberalized iva t the belief that if we just leave the terrorists alone they're gonna leave us alone they're not they're not if we don't hack Russia they won't hack us we don't hack China they won't hack us if we don't saber rattling North Korea they'll leave us alone it's not the way the world works it's just not the way the world yeah Tammy I think Hillary would steal your Doritos and and all your booze I think she'd be more interested in the booze Peterhouse says the court could eventually be 7 to 2 in the conservatives favor I agree and I agree I think if we look at Breyer and Ginsburg right so now we'll have Korsak we have Roberts Alito Thomas gorsek and Cavanaugh if we get Breyer and Ginsburg if Trump's able to replace them then we've got our 72 we've got our 72 with all relatively young justices we might lose two on the right it'll still keep us at 5-4 and if that were the case hmm then let's hope Clarence Thomas is in a 70s might step down before the end and a trump second term and give us somebody younger so that we at least keep it 6-3 there's a lot of math a lot of math goes into this but I think right now the math is on our side Anthony Emmerich says it's concerns you that Soros is close to you do you mean Kushner Jared Kushner hi mm-hmm that's who you mean yeah but you know here's a problem in New York money circles you can't help but cross paths with Soros you just can't help but do it he's got big hedge funds and money is like nah stick to political party money is agnostic a political part well do I see any other now is what you three says though I see any of the justices retiring over the next few yeah with Brady Ginsburg I see retiring I think troubled easily win a second term and I see Ginsberg leaving leaving before the end of that second term yeah Enoch says yup libertarianism is an ideal like classic liberalism yeah I mean it really is you know it's wonderful but you also have to live in reality i I remember on my radio show a couple of years back during the election I was talking to Austin Peterson when he was a libertarian presidential candidate now he's running for then it as a Republican in the state of Missouri and Austin's a nice guy and he's a pretty smart guy but he told me he doesn't believe in the concept of borders he doesn't believe in the concept of controlling immigration not everyone is a free man and you should be able to move across borders on the earth freely and and and we shouldn't have a military we should go after terrorists with letters of marque and reprisal with privateers and mercenaries and a lot of their their theories only sound cool but they're not practical and frankly the lack of sovereignty the abolition the nullification of sovereignty and borders to me sounds terrifying terrifying El Dorado says Netflix is now stopping reviews because of Obama and his liberal agenda I will tell you one thing I thought Netflix hit a new low with that unfunny comedian Michaele Wolf's salute to abortion centered around independence that thought it was one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard of it was absolutely terrible though Jimmy Johnny colt says this is the most censored live chat ever why what's being censored I'm not being said I'm not censoring myself the rebels not censoring me hmm let's say a Special K says we should all be thankful because imagine if it was crooked Hillary picking a judge for the Supreme Court Absolut don't tread on me well liberalism is what's causing the downfall of our country the viber survival of the fittest works in society as well if you give people things that didn't work for no reason to work no there isn't there isn't right and that but I talk about it every day that's exactly what the left wants I want to give you things they want to be responsible for you and they want you really dependent upon them for food clothing and shelter I want to take your guns so you're dependent upon them for your safety and then they own you then they own you Wayne Marion says Europe is finding out what countries without borders are like yeah they are and it's not going well for them and the citizens don't like it do they no they don't and why would they Runk just tweeted new poll over 90% most popular Republican in the history of the party Wow among Republicans I didn't see that I checked that tweak right now I'm figured Trump would be tweeting like a maniac this morning let's see what he said where is our president there he is he said thank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals economy is roaring Supreme Court pick getting great reviews new poll says Trump at over 90% is the most popular Republican in the history of the party yeah yeah I I believe that and and he's the most popular Republican in the history of the party for the simple reason that he's actually doing what he said he would do when he got elected that's it really not a difficult concept I'm gonna do this and I'm doing it yeah we got to build a wall but now we're starting to see that more and more ranchers along the border Texas and Arizona are getting letters telling them the border wall construction is coming it's coming it's a process yeah just start putting fence poles there's got to be environmental impact studies and permitting and request proposals and contractors picked all that fun stuff easton guy says should roe v wade be overturned in my opinion well here's the thing I think roe v wade needs to be re-examined there have been tremendous advances in medical science since roe v wade came down roe v wade on its face I feel is unconstitutional the Constitution doesn't discuss abortion the founding fathers I don't believe wanted abortion to be the law of the land didn't even think about it it was created out of thin air by activist liberal judges on the Supreme Court and so yes I think the constitutionality over oh v Wade the the foundation a roe v wade only to be looked at and yes I believe it should be overturned I believe it should be overturned and I think it should as El Dorado asked go back to the states it should be a states rights issue Lulu Bob's donated and remember soup you could super chat I forgot to mention that with that to little dollar sign there you can super chat and donate your question I'll pop up Lulu Bibb says why do you guys have a mid turn election who votes a big turn election who votes is it just an indicator as to who will win at the end of the term no the reason we have midterm elections is because our Congress members member of the House members of the House of Representatives and members of the Senate have two and six year terms so often they come up for reelection midterms so think of it as said 2000 and in the year 2000 the president selected for four years Congress people for two senators for six and so when you got to 2004 when when you got 2002 you at your House of Representatives folks up for reelection when you got 2000 for your president and your House of Representatives up for reelection again and then when you got to 2006 you had your senators up for reelection but that's why we have midterms because certain elections fall in those two years and that second year between the general presidential elections and that's why we have midterm elections here it's just the nature of Congress having two-year and six-year terms that overlap the four-year terms of presidents the general election being four-year that's why we call it the midterm that two years in the middle that second year in the middle for a congressional election and it's a great question actually I'm sure there a lot of people around the world that didn't understand that many do but thanks for that question it was a great question let's say you're Enoch was a bit confused about whether Trump is an independent or a Republican I think I think you and the rest of the country are a bit confused about that but whatever we whatever he's doing is working let's leave it alone don't tread on me says rebel media should be on national TV I agree call your cable provider give us some free time there that would be awesome and don't tread on me thank you very much for your donation as well I appreciate that do I think Trudeau's groper gate scandal Tammy asked has reached the ears of the president I'm sure it has but the president added States has no control over what happens in Canada or what the president of Canada Prime Minister of Canada let's see mmm Special K Trump is a president for all Americans he's in the middle neither left or right in my opinion and Easton says Easton guy I don't even think Trump has a philosophy or belief look I don't think Trump is a political idea lot I think the guy's a doer he's results-oriented and what's shaking out is very interesting what it's what what's happening is that you realize when somebody is not a political ideologue when they're just results oriented and those results are doing what's best for the country what's best for the bottom line and for national security well those results tend to skew conservative that to me is the most interesting part of Trump's presidency he's not a political idea lot he's not a rightist he's not a leftist but he looks at what's best for the country what's gonna give me the best ROI the best return on investment and when those policies are enacted they seem to be the more conservative policies they really do seem to be mb so sorry I'm late John I hope I didn't miss anything on Project Cassandra operation reciprocity or the Scott Israel you did it I'm gonna do those this week cuz we're talking about Supreme Court pick today that's the big news we're gonna be talking about that with

think needle will be abolished or at least renegotiate no I think Europe's gonna start paying their fair share that's what I think I think Europe's gonna start paying their fair share because they need us far more than we need them in NATO they need US troops keeping Russia at bay and they know that they know that we'll go to bat for Poland before we go to bat for Germany at this point because of Angela Merkel and her leftist leanings let's say what is Tami asks me what is taking the governor so long Scott Israel governor's waiting for the report from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Tammy there's also a commission convened of sheriff's from other counties were independently giving their input through the governor and FDLE and the state Senate that would ultimately remove Scott Israel they're giving their input on his performance it's being done right it's being done properly because at the end of the day he is an elected official and when you when you remove somebody put into office by the voters you've got a really cross all your T's and dot all your eyes so I'm a fan of the way they're going about his removal and I do feel I'm being told by sources but my opinion I do feel Scott Israel will be removed from office very very soon the way it works here in Florida again I've explained it the governor suspends him the state Senate then votes to remove him I was told by two state senators on background they're expecting a special session to be convened this summer they end in early spring the state of the session they're expecting a special session a convene reconvene this summer up in Tallahassee to remove Scott Israel and nothing's changed I was told that last month I think Enoch says I think the best representation of the political spectrums and axis is an x-axis from conservative to progressive and a y-axis with authoritarian anarchy I've seen that graph it's pretty accurate pretty good I like it now that Trump and Putin will team have teamed up in a space race well Trump still keep his word to arm Ukraine yeah I believe he will I believe you will you guys think the space force will accept my application I want to join the space for cuz it just sounds so cool hmm John Zeeland says Trump has got mama Merkel to drop tariffs on cars winning on NAFTA well not yet but I think that's gonna happen I think that's gonna happen Wayne Marion says sure Scott Israel's arrogance is enough to remove him in my opinion and mine to wane in mine too but he is elected so there is a process believe me he has no fans anymore even Democrats where I live in Broward County I only live about oh geez seven minutes from the sheriff's office about 25 minutes from Stoneman Douglas High School in parkland I work very closely with many of the political people there I would look just because I'm active in politics even Democrats my neighbor very very nice woman good friend of mine she's a very prominent democratic political strategist who helped get Scott Israel elected it's the worst she tells me it's the biggest regret of her career he's a terrible guy she can't stand him even the Democrats want him done even the Democrats want him God pammi base force does sound cool as a profession but I don't think they'll take me MD asks any thoughts on Teresa BAE's brexit Fiasco and her cabinet melting out from under her in protest yeah I think Teresa may is really botching it yesterday I said I didn't know if she'd survive not looking too good and now there are whispers of what a great Prime Minister Boris Johnson would make so things are getting very interesting politically over in the UK very interesting politically Roger stone called Robert Jackson says Roger stone called the new Supreme Court pick a globalist do you think he's correct I think Roger stone I know Roger he's a nice guy he's local Roger lives in South Florida we have we have a lot of mutual friends I think Roger will say whatever roger has to say to keep himself relevant in the media I think Roger is uh he's a very smart guy but I do think Roger steps in it sometimes and but I will say this about Roger stone he's colorful it keeps everybody talking he knows how to generate buzz but though I think Kevin was a globalist no I I don't I know now when I look at his decisions and his rulings and quite frankly even if he is not gonna have much bearing on the Supreme Court because he seems to be a constitutional originalist Anthony Emmerich I think people with dual citizenship should not be allowed to hold office elected or appointed why why I have a problem with that if you're a citizen you're a citizen and if both nations allowed dual citizenship you're legal you're legal Enoch says progressives almost always regret their uninformed decisions yep they do rogue one says Roger stone is dead on the money well not really because it was Roger stone who pushed Donald Trump hire Paul Manafort as campaign manager for like 50 days forget all amount of Ford's problems he almost lost Trump the election because he wanted Trump to be more establishment though Roger stone remember something about Roger stone he's also been a consultant for Democrats and for establishment candidates research Roger stones whole history before you think he's this hardcore right winger he's really not he's really not Roger says what he has to say to appease his audience and the candidates he's working with I think he's a nice guy I think he's colorful I think he's interesting but Roger stone is not an ideologue Roger stone is a an entertainer and a strategist in many regards let's say md asks locally have I been watching the Broward School Board elections coming up and following Andrew Pollock in his support for Mendelssohn I have been and I've been interacting with Andrew Pollak through a mutual friend I haven't had a chance for both of us have been very busy we're supposed to speak I am NOT a fan of Robert Runcie Robert Runcie remember the current Broward schools chief who is just as guilty as Scott Israel in all this he was a good friend of Arne Duncan he comes out of the Rahm Emmanuel Arne Duncan Obama's education secretary missing in Broward County nobody knows where that money went rogue one says I was talk I was talking about what stone said about the new Skoda spec I didn't say it was dead on the money about everything geez okay and I don't know if he's right about that because he also thought Paul Manafort was a great choice for campaign manager Roger stone is not infallible he's not infallible I'm gonna trust heritage and Federalist and many conservatives I know real conservatives I know who like Kavanagh who have dealt with him who have dug far deeper into and I have hmm Heath Allen says dual citizenship could cause conflict of interest interest real or perceived in making decisions not really look I've got a very good friend who holds dual citizenship u.s. in Poland he was born here his parents were born in Poland therefore he's entitled to dual he is the most rapidly hardcore conservative patriotic American you would ever meet but it helps them do business in Poland his alliance isn't to the u.s. so I have to disagree with you on that one I have to disagree with you on that one holding dual citizenship there's not many people have dual alliances declan black says you should only have allegiance to the country that you are serving it simply means they took advantage of the ability to travel a bit more easily because a parent or grandparent was born in another country very few people I know who hold dual citizenship have allegiance to the European countries they typically have allegiance to the US and it just makes it easier to travel there I'm back in fourth let's see not sure anyone outside of Hardin oh you're talking about the County politics MD yeah we're gonna get into that in another show it only gets two side tracks I want to say on the national issue and rogue one says that on truss roger stoner alex jones much in general Rogers is right sometimes I have zero respect for Alec Jones I think he's a reprehensible guy because of his Sandy Hook and his 9/11 conspiracy theories that lost me forever when you insult dead heroes and dead children me you're trash and how many people love Alex Jones I won't watch him I won't entertain him I won't retweet him maybe he's gotten a couple of things right when he realized that you can't be a lunatic your whole life but what he did with real tragedies to garner views for himself was disgusting and I find that only a reprehensible human being would do something like hmm Edie Cole 54 colt 50 vs. who I think will be the next kotas judge to retire my money's on my money's on Ginsberg my money's on Ginsberg now it's you know well Declan black says I'm wrong on the issue because my opinions don't mean anything in my experiences don't mean anything well Declan neither do yours by that using that logic do they oh that's a pretty sharp knife that cuts both ways and if we don't look at life to the lens of our experiences and we're gonna be doomed to rely on other people which is the core tenets of liberalism and as a conservative I like to make my own decisions based on my own research and my own experiences yours with respect is a well it's a pretty liberal position a pretty liberal position but Ginsberg is not long for this mortal guy actually Ginsberg is Anthony Emmerich said it Briggs in pretty good shape I'm pretty good shape I think she should just go and retire poor lady's been working for a lot a lot of years and she's on the wrong side of thing in the raw on the wrong side of things hmm Frank physicalist Alex Jones a fruitcake yeah that's a nice way to describe him I think he's just a pretty disgraceful guy I think it's a guy who will step on the bodies of murdered children to create a conspiracy theory for views and revenue terrible terrible classless fact ethics and morals not a knot away I'd ever wanna never ever want to handle my career Danny says Ginsberg sleeps at work time to retire exactly I pray I agree I couldn't agree more I couldn't agree more that's the problem too you know she's a much older woman who clearly despite there was a moronic I suggest you go research politico's Twitter feed they were saying how one of their twenty seven-year-old reporters couldn't do Ginsburg eighty five-year-old Ginsburg's workout that's what great shape she's in in addition of being a chill inducing embarrassment of a piece that twenty seven-year-old needs to get to a doctor very quickly if he can't compete with an 85 year old in the gym yeah Declan black is very angry at me Declan I look at life through my own experiences if you choose to be guided by what others tell you that's perfectly fine that's your right it's also the way liberals live their lives the state tells them what's good and what's bad academia tells them what's good and what's bad and they listen they don't look at their own experiences you they don't look at it and you're anecdotally picking one Chinese dual citizen and if that person's first citizenship was Chinese and that's where their loyalties lie I doubt Poland would ever elect my friend president knowing he was born here and has a long history of being a red-blooded patriotic Trump supporting America you're looking at the reverse it seems special case as it seems the left has lost its mine they were resisting Trump's coat is picked before he made it yeah I was talking about that earlier I was talking about that earlier they were resisting his go to speak before they knew who it was they were calling to pick controversial before they knew who it was I wish Trump would have just screwed them and said okay I'm gonna pick Merrick garland and then watch the left go oh my god the pick is great no psyche just wanted to see if you were still resisting I'm gonna go with Cavanaugh that would have been epic trolling that would have been epic trolling Trump would have done that let's say let's see what we got hmm we what's most scary to me Matthew Malan says politicians think now when I thought when I was 12 that's a great great comment they really do especially the Liberals bush hog is mad at me too about dual citizenship if you are going to hold off your alliance should only be in the country you are serving look there is a big difference with holding a document and having allegiance big difference plenty of Americans hold dual citizenship to travel to Europe more easily they would never never never give allegiance to those nations over the United States looking at life so myopically is what the left wants you to do they give you a broad sward a very broad concept and tell you to subscribe to it tell you that's the way things are and like lemmings people follow I don't do that I do my own research and and I look at life through my own experiences through their own conclusions I draw through the research and that's how I make decisions Tammy says the woman's marchers complaint letter left space for the nominee they sent it without adding the name yeah they did they put two little X's they put two little X's it was awesome Declan black is telling me my arguments are completely anecdotal and I'm telling you they're not because I can give you instant upon instance of elected official down here in Florida who also happen to hit dual citizenship to travel other countries and who are some of the most patriotic conservative people you will ever meet I know two federal agents who have it they are rock solid patriotic Americans putting themselves in a line of fire daily many members of our military have it so no it's not anecdotal it's not anecdotal you've taken two or three anecdotal incidents from Australia and are trying to paint them as global fact you're accusing me of that which you're doing Declan do some more research let's see I just don't trust globalists in general Anthony says no neither do i neither do i but I'm not well I don't like what you say especially Zionists because let's face it that sounds like a concocted term somebody wanting the State of Israel persevere and survive well there right there right there strategic excuse me a strategic ally in the region we need them yes Declan was very upset with me today but that's okay this show wouldn't be fun if we didn't disagree a little bit now if you Malan give me a fist bump from Wales on Trump popularity numbers a fist bump from Wales and the Trump is pump from Wales I'm sorry yeah the 90 percent among Republicans is pretty substantial easton guy says he's I'm on the losing side in regards to dual citizenship on the right look you gotta you're not gonna agree on everything we're not gonna agree on everything I just personally don't have a problem if somebody was Chinese and got us is and chipper remember it wouldn't be natural born it couldn't run here because we don't just have a citizenship requirement for president in the United States we have a natural-born requirement not for anything other than the presidency but we have a natural birth requirement for the presidency so in the United States with regards to our executive office we already have an insurance policy in place we already have one in place and members of Congress in the house well you know they don't they they're one of four hundred and some-odd in the house and one of a hundred in the Senate and in state legislatures depending on the sides of the state those numbers become pretty similar Declan uh well your premise you're telling me that my premise that having dual citizens causes no problems is wrong Declan it took two examples from Nations of millions and millions of people buying typically speaking that's not indicative of a problem not indicative of our problem he gave maybe one anecdotal example one anecdotal exam if you show me you show me scientific research that says 15,000 dual citizenship holders were were acting subversively toward the nation in which they live you might have something one Chinese guy you know that's the epitome of anecdotal let's see what we got Oh Butch Hagen 63 says I sound a lot like controlled opposition yeah that's me yeah got me yeah got me the reality is in America we double citizenships allowed it's the law you can't be elected president if you were born there and we're naturalized here yeah do that but if you're born here and you had a grandparent over there in Italy and you get an Italian passport I can't even do that my great-great grandparents and born there and you get an Italian passport because you like to travel to in front easier no I'm not worried I'm not worried that you're going to be subversive to the United States if you're ever elected to office I'm worried at all and I'm sure the new Supreme Court the conservative Supreme Court would uphold that because it's already the law of the land you're allowed to do it allowed to do it yeah Robert Jackson says controlled opposition wouldn't read the comments and try to answer them the best they could be pushing it narrative exactly Robert if I were controlled opposition but I read would I read the opposition's comments and debate them openly on a live stream critical thinking Robert Jackson outstanding more people should do it it's awesome but we're gonna move on from the we're gonna move on from from Declan not liking dual citizen just to be a bit obsessed with that and I'm gonna summer I'm gonna sum up Wow an hour but burned an hour already how awesome is this I mean Kavanagh is a good choice for Supreme Court maybe three percent more moderate than I would like and again I could be proven wrong like where he is on the second amendment he seems to be an absolutist on individual firearms rights which to me there's a lot about where he stands on everything else so I'm optimistic more than cautiously optimistic I'm not enthusiastically optimistic I'm optimistic I am however enthusiastically optimistic that he will be confirmed by the Senate there's nothing the Democrats can do and watching their tantrum so the rest of the day are going to be glorious I suggest you do the same and I really suggest you join me back here tomorrow morning 7:30 a.m. for another Declassified live I'll see you guys to-morrow
