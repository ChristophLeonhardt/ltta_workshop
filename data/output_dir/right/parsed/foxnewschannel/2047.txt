>> Dana: IT'S MIDTERM
MONDAY.
G.O.P. VOTERS IN FOUR KEY
STATES -- INDIANA, WEST
VIRGINIA, NORTH CAROLINA,
OHIO -- ARE HEADING TO THE
POLLS TOMORROW FOR PRIMARIES.
AS THE REPUBLICANS TRY TO HOLD
ON TO THE MAJORITIES IN
CONGRESS.
JOINING ME NOW, CHRIS
STIREWALT, EDITOR OF "HALFTIME
REPORT."
SIX DAYS AGO FOX NEWS HOSTED A
DEBATE IN WEST VIRGINIA FOR
THE REPUBLICANS TWO ARE VYING
TO TAKE ON JOE MANCHIN, THE
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT SENATOR.
AND TELL ME ABOUT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED SINCE THEN.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS MORNING
WE GET A TWEET FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP THAT SAYS TO THE GREAT
PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA, WE
HAVE TOGETHER A REALLY GREAT
CHANCE TO KEEP MAKING A BIG
DIFFERENCE.
THE PROBLEM IS DON BLANKENSHIP
CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR SENATE
CAN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION
IN YOUR STATE.
NO WAY.
REMEMBER ALABAMA.
VOTE REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS OR
ATTORNEY GENERAL MORRISEY!"
HE WEIGHED IN.
>> HE HALFWAY DID.
I WAS CAUSED TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ROMNEY AND SO
MANY OTHERS DID WITH TRUMP IN
2016 WHEN THEY SAID WHATEVER
YOU DO, DON'T VOTE FOR THIS
GUY.
FOR WHOM SHOULD WE VOTE?
I DON'T CARE.
JUST NOT HIM.
YOU KNOW HOW THAT WORKED OUT.
>> Dana: MM-HMM.
>> IF THE PRESIDENT WAS
SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING TO STOP
BLANKENSHIP HE PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE PICKED, RIGHT?
HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAID.
HE KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT TO PICK
BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH FLAWED
IN THEIR OWN WAYS.
JENKINS IS PROBABLY A BETTER
GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE
THAT MORRISEY BUT HE IS MORE
ESTABLISHMENTARIAN FIGURE
WHICH WOULD UPSET FOLKS.
MORRISEY LOOKING LIKE HE HAS A
TOUGHER POLL AGAINST JENKINS
AGAINST MANCHIN.
DIFFICULT CHOICE SO HE IS
CHOSE NOT TO CHOOSE.
AS A CONSEQUENCE BLANKENSHIP
IS PROBABLY HELPED IN THAT IF
THE SUPPORT DRIVES OFF IN BOTH
DIRECTIONS AND BLANKENSHIP CAN
KEEP HIS SOLID CORE, MAYBE HE
CAN PULL IT OFF.
>> Dana: THEN WHAT, YOU
KNOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS,
"REMEMBER ALABAMA."
CERTAINLY, BLANKENSHIP MIGHT
REMEMBER ALABAMA.
AND THAT ROY MOORE WAS
EXPECTED NOT TO BE ABLE TO WIN
THAT PRIMARY.
OR THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE
WANTED HIM NOT TO, BUT HE DID
ANYWAY.
PRESIDENT IN A CONTROVERSIAL
MOVE WE HAVE ALL TALKED ABOUT
FOR A LONG TIME ENDORSES ROY
MOORE.
AND ROY MOORE ENDS UP LOSING.
SO THE PRESIDENT COULD CHANGE
HIS MIND AND PERHAPS PEOPLE
THAT SUPPORT BLANKENSHIP WHO
WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO GO
IN THERE AND FIRE UP
WASHINGTON.
MAY REALIZE THE PRESIDENT WILL
COME AROUND IF HE HAS TO.
>> I'M SURE HE WOULD.
I'M SURE IF THEY NOMINATED
BLANKENSHIP THAT THE
REPUBLICANS -- LOOK, IF THE
REPUBLICANS COULD GET BEHIND
SOMEBODY WHO WAS CREDIBLY
ACCUSED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT TOWARD
TEENAGER GIRLS I ASSUME THEY
COULD FIND IT WITHIN
THEMSELVES TO COME AROUND FOR
A FELLOW WHO WAS CONVICTED OF
WHITE COLLAR CRIMES.
THOUGH THEY WERE CONNECTED
ULTIMATELY TO VERY TRAGIC
INCIDENT.
I SUPPOSE IF THEY COME AROUND
FOR ROY MOORE THEY COULD COME
AROUND FOR BLANKENSHIP.
THE OTHER THING HERE, THIS IS
UNFAIR COMPARISON.
BLANKENSHIP IS NOT ROY MOORE.
>> Dana: RIGHT.
>> ROY MOORE COULDN'T WIN AS
IT TURNS OUT THE ALABAMA
GENERAL ELECTION.
THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK
DON BLANKENSHIP WOULD DO
SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THAN
EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO.
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THE
OTHER TWO MADE A CONCLUSIVE
CASE THEY ARE THE BEST NOMINEE
FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION.
I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE HERE
IS OVERCOOKING THE BROTH A
LITTLE BIT.
MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO
LET IT PLAY OUT ON ITS OWN.
>> Dana: TAKE US TO NORTH
CAROLINA.
I WANT TO READ YOU A QUOTE
FROM STEVE BANNON.
HE IS SAYING ABOUT THE
MID-TERM ELECTIONS YOU HAVE TO
MAKE IT UP OR DOWN VOTE
NOVEMBER 6.
YOU WANT TRUMP ON THE TICKET
IN EVERY DISTRICT.
YOU HAVE TO PUT TRUMP ON THE
TICKET.
YOU ARE NOT VOTING FOR
CONGRESS.
YOU ARE VOTING FOR DONALD
TRUMP.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
PRESIDENTS IN FIRST MIDTERM
TRY TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES TO
SAY THIS IS NOT A REFERENDUM
ON THE PRESIDENT.
THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON
CONGRESS.
BUT BANNON IS SUGGESTING THE
EXACT OPPOSITE.
GOOD STRATEGY OR NO?
>> I ASSUME COMMENTS LIKE THAT
IS WHY STEVE BANNON IS MAKING
THE PHONE CALL FROM AN INDIES
CLOSED LOCATION -- UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION DEEP IN THE POLITICAL
WILDERNESS.
YOU CAN'T TRUMP THE DECIDING
ISSUE IN EVERY RACE.
SOME DISTRICTS THE REPUBLICANS
DO WANT TO MAKE IT ABOUT
TRUMP.
IF YOU ARE IN WEST VIRGINIA
WHERE THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY
HAS 70% JOB APPROVAL RATING
YOU WANT A REFERENDUM ON
TRUMP.
BUT A LOT OF THE DISTRICTS,
PARTICULARLIES THE DOZENS OF
DISTRICTS WHERE THE PRESIDENT
IS NOT PARTICULARLY POPULAR
AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE
FIGHTING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE,
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT TAX
CUTS.
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ISSUES.
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE
THINGS.
THEY DON'T WANT IT TO BE A
REFERENDUM ON TRUMP.
IF IT'S A REFERENDUM ON TRUMP,
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE
IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO SAY IS
SEND ME TO WASHINGTON SO THAT
I CAN PUT A CHECK ON THIS
RUN-AWAY PRESIDENCY.
IT HAS WORKED IN MANY CYCLES
IN THE PAST.
I WOULD WORK AGAIN FOR THEM
THIS TIME.
THEY HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE
WHERE YOU USE THE PRESIDENT
AND WHERE YOU KEEP HIM AT A
DISTANCE.
>> Dana: SO WE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT WEST VIRGINIA, INDIANA
AND OHIO THE PAST COUPLE OF
WEEKS.
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT NORTH
CAROLINA AND THE NINTH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.
WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE?
ARE THE REPUBLICANS IN DANGER
OF POSSIBLY HAVING ANOTHER
CONOR LAMB MOMENT THERE?
>> IT IS POSSIBLE.
WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT THE
PRIMARY YOU HAVE AN INCUMBENT
REPUBLICAN U.S. MEMBER OF
CONGRESS.
VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE
DOWN THERE.
NOT THOSE PEOPLE BUT OTHER
PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE.
ROBERT PITTINGER IS A
CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF
CONGRESS.
YOU WOULD NEVER THINK HE WOULD
GET OUT-CONSERVATIVED.
THIS IS A VICIOUS PRIMARY
WHERE YOU COULD END UP WITH AN
INCUMBENT U.S. MEMBER OF
CONGRESS GET KNOCKED OUT OVER
WHO LOVES DONALD TRUMP THE
MOST.
THAT IS THE KIND OF DISTRICT
WHERE STEVE BANNON IS QUITE
RIGHT.
YOU WANT TO BE THE TRUMPIEST
TRUMPER OF ALL TRUMPS.
>> Dana: IS THAT TRUE IN THE
GENERAL?
IT'S TRUE FOR THE PRIMARY.
