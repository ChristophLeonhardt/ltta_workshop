IDENTIFY AND TRACK DRONE
STRIKES COULD BE USED FOR
LETHAL PURPOSES.
PETE, TAKE IT AWAY.
PETE: THANKS, ABBY.
THE CULTURE WARS CONTINUE
ACROSS THE GLOS GLOBE AS
THEY DO EVERY WEEK.
THERE ARE CRUCIAL STORIES
THAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
THIS WEEK.
HERE TO FILL US IN AND GIVE
US HER TAKE IS THE
CONSERVATIVE MILLENNIAL AND
CR-TV HOST ALLIE BETH
STUCKEY.
ALLI, THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE THIS MORNING.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
PETE: NEWS MOVES SO FAST.
THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF WE
MISS.
WE WILL GO THROUGH THREE
STORIES HERE.
THE FIRST IS OUT OF
AUSTRALIA.
I WANT TO READ THIS HEADLINE
FOR YOU.
IT IS NO BOYS ALOUD, NO
GIRLS EITHER.
AUSTRALIA IS ACTUALLY
AUDITING KIDS' BOOKS TO MAKE
SURE THEY AREN'T TOO GENDER
SPECIFIC.
TELL US ABOUT THIS.
>> NOT JUST KIDS BOOKS, BUT
ALSO TOLD.
THEY ARE TRYING TO ALITTLE
BIT RATE ANY KIND OF GENDER
DISTINCTION IN ORDER TO
ADVANCE THE BALL DOWN THE
GENDER EQUITY COURT.
OF COURSE THIS IS SOCIAL
ENGINEERING.
WE SAW THIS IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN HAS GENDER NEUTRAL
PRESCHOOLS IN WHICH BOYS ARE
TAUGHT TO BE MORE LIKE GIRLS
AND GIRLS ARE TAUGHT TO BE
MORE LIKE BOYS.
WHAT THEY FOUND OVER MORE
THAN A DECADE OF STUDYING.
BOYS AND GIRLS ARE NO LONGER
FOLLOW ALONG GENDER
STEREOTYPES.
THAT'S BECAUSE GENDER AND
SEX ARE SCIENTIFICALLY
ERNESTO TWIND FG TWINSD.
THE MORE WE ADVANCE THIS
ANTISCIENCE AGENDA THE MORE
CONFUSED OUR KIDS WILL BE
AND UNSTABLE THEY WILL BE AS
ADULTS.
PETE: THEY GET CONFUSED AND
DOESN'T WORK.
HYPER FEMINIZED TOYS SUCH AS
BARBIES.
>> WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
PETE: NO BARBIES OR TRUCKS
ON EITHER SIDE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE HAVE WE GONE?
SECOND STORY HERE, LOUISIANA
PASSED SOME OF THE MOST
STRICT ABORTION LAWS IN THE
COUNTRY, I BELIEVE.
THEY ARE SETTING THE LIMIT
AT 15 WEEKS.
TELL US ABOUT THIS.
>> WELL, WHAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT THIS, IS THIS WAS A
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR THAT
ACTUALLY SIGNED THIS BILL
WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT
THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT REALLY
SHOULDN'T BE A RIGHT OR LEFT
ISSUE.
IT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE.
UNBORN RIGHTS ARE HUMAN
RIGHTS.
15 WEEKS AN UNBORN CHILD IS
ALREADY STARTING TO LOOK
LIKE HIS OR HER MOTHER.
THEY MIGHT ALREADY START TO
FEEL PAIN AT THIS POINT.
SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE
DECENT HUMAN RIGHTS LAW.
AND I WISH THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY WOULD FOLLOW SUIT.
PETE: ALLEY, IT'S GREAT TO
SEE STREETS TAKING THE
PREROGATIVE.
YOU LIVE THERE AND VOTE FOR
THAT AND VOTE FOR PEOPLE WHO
SUPPORT THAT GOOD FOR YOU.
>> EXACTLY.
PETE: THANK YOU FOR
HIGHLIGHTING THAT STORY.
THIRD STORY HERE.
SO, CALIFORNIA KEEPS ACTING
LIKE A COUNTRY.
IT HAS NOW BANNED STATE
FUNDED TRAVEL TO OKLAHOMA
BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS THE
POLICIES THERE
DISCRIMINATORY TOWARD LBGT
FOLKS.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> LET'S LOOK AT THESE
DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES.
SO OKLAHOMA HAS SIMPLY SAID
THAT PRIVATE ADOPTION
AGENCIES CAN OPERATE OUT OF
THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
BY SAYING HEY, SAME SEX
COUPLES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO
ADOPT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH
THAT PARTICULAR ADOPTION
AGENCY TO AGREE WITH THEIR
RIGHT TO DO SO.
LIKE YOU SAID, CALIFORNIA IS
OPERATING LIKE A COUNTRY.
THEY OPERATE IN A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T HONOR RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM OR THE FIRST
AMENDMENT OR THE
CONSTITUTION FOR THAT
MATTER.  THIS IS THE SAME
STATE THAT SAID PRO-LIFE
ADOPTION AGENCIES OR
PRO-LIFE HEALTH CENTERS YOU
HAVE TO ADVERTISE FOR
ABORTION.
THEY ALSO SAID THAT HEY,
WE'RE GOING TO BAN SERVICES
THAT PROMOTE ANY TYPE OF
SEXUAL ORIENTATION REFORM.
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A
STATE THAT HONORS FREE
SPEECH OR FREEDOM OF
RELIGION.
I'M NOT SURPRISED TO SEE
THEM OPERATING THIS WAY.
PETE: NOT EVEN A STATE THAT
FORCES ITS OWN LAW.
STATES WHERE YOU CAN'T GO
AND DOESN'T ENFORCE THEIR
OWN IMMIGRATION LAWS.
