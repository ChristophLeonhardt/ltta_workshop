TONIGHT, THOUGH, TOP GEO

00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,962
"MY POSITION REMAINS UNCHANGED.

TARIFFS ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM

IMPORTS ARE A TAX HIKE ON

30
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,402
AMERICANS AND WILL HAVE DAMAGING

MANUFACTURERS, AND WORKERS."

33
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,040
DO YOU THINK HE HAS IT WRONG?

34
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,975
>> I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS.

35
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,076
I DO APPRECIATE WITH THE

36
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:58,544
PRESIDENT IS DOING BRADY'S

37
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:00,479
BRINGING DISRUPTIVE POLICIES TO

38
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,048
THE TRADE AGENDA TO SEND A

39
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:04,083
MESSAGE TO NOT ONLY OUR

40
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,051
ALLIES, MOST IMPORTANTLY TO

41
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,552
CHINA, WE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH

42
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:07,386
AND PUTTING AMERICAN INTEREST

43
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:08,254
FIRST.

44
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:09,655
THAT IS OF HER MESSAGE THAT YOU

45
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:10,923
HAVE NOT HEARD ON THE TRADE

46
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:11,257
AGENDA.

47
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,426
WHAT I SEE OUT OF THIS

48
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:14,093
ADMINISTRATION, EXACTLY WHAT

49
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:15,461
THEY PROMISE TO DO.

50
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:16,796
DISRUPT THE TRADE POLICY TO PUT

51
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:18,965
AMERICAN INTEREST IN THE SAME

52
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:19,665
EQUAL LEVEL PLAYING FIELD OF

53
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:22,468
FAIR TRADE, NOT TRADE THAT IS AT

54
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:22,835
OUR COST.

55
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,637
>> Shannon: MEXICO AND CANADA

56
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:25,438
BASICALLY SAYING, MEXICO SAYS IT

57
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,173
WILL BE TIT-FOR-TAT, THEY TALKED

58
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,041
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL GO

59
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,710
AFTER, WITH REGARD TO AMERICAN

60
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,444
PRODUCTS.

61
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,046
STEEL, LAMPS, PORK SHOULDERS,

62
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:36,415
SAUSAGE, YOU KNOW, APPLES, ALL

63
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:36,882
KINDS OF THINGS.

64
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:37,917
THOSE INDUSTRIES TONIGHT ARE

65
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:38,617
SOUNDING THE ALARM.

66
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:40,386
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS,

67
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:41,087
THOSE ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES

68
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:44,623
THAT DO YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL

69
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:45,424
DOWNSIDE TO THIS WHOLE

70
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:45,791
ISSUE.

71
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,426
WHAT YOU SAY TO THEM TO REASSURE

72
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:47,827
THEM?

73
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,395
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

74
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:50,696
THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THESE

75
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:52,631
TARIFFS, IN ORDER TO BE LEGAL.

76
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,734
THEY HAVE A PROCESS TO GO

77
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:55,368
THROUGH IN REGARD TO OUR

78
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,636
AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL

79
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:58,070
IMPLICATIONS.

80
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,672
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK

81
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:00,973
WHAT THIS SENSE, WHEN CANADA

82
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:03,676
WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE, THEY

83
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:04,343
BETTER UNDERSTAND, THERE'S

84
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:04,910
CONSEQUENCES TO THAT.

85
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,946
THEY NEED TO STAY AT THE TABLE,

86
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:08,447
NEGOTIATE THIS, JUST LIKE BRAZIL

87
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:09,681
AND SOUTH KOREA NEGOTIATED

88
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:11,317
THROUGH THIS, THE PRESIDENT SAT

89
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,852
WITH THEM AND NEGOTIATED A

90
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:13,919
RESOLUTION NETWORK FOR BOTH

91
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,589
SIDES TO MAKE IT A FAIR

92
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:17,423
AGREEMENT GOING FORWARD.

93
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:18,624
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CANADA AND

94
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:19,658
MEXICO SHOULD BE DOING AS WELL

95
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:20,426
AS THE E.U.

96
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:21,193
WE ARE GOOD ALLIES, WE CAN WORK

97
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,562
THIS OUT.

98
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:24,997
YOU GOT TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD

99
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,966
FAITH TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN

100
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,800
INTERESTS AS WELL AS THE ROLE

101
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,167
INTERESTS.

102
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,035
>> Shannon: HERE IS FOR THE

103
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,970
HOUSE SPEAKER HAS TO SAY ABOUT

104
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,270
THIS.

105
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,305
PAUL RYAN SAYS "I DISAGREE WITH

106
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:34,373
THE DECISION.

107
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:35,107
INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE REAL

108
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:36,609
PROBLEM IN THE INTERNATIONAL

109
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,277
TRADE OF THESE PRODUCTS, IT

110
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:39,311
TARGETS AMERICA'S ALLIES WHEN WE

111
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,647
SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THEM TO

112
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,449
ADDRESS THE UNFAIR TRADING

113
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:44,183
PRACTICES OF COUNTRIES LIKE

114
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:44,517
CHINA."

115
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:45,651
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

116
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:48,254
REPORTED THAT FROM A NUMBER OF

117
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,488
PEOPLE, SAYING, THE REAL BAD

118
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,289
ACTOR IS CHINA.

119
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:52,458
WE NEED TO TEAM UP WITH MEXICO

120
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,294
AND CANADA TO TAKE ON THAT FACT.

121
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:56,729
>> THAT IS WHY CANADA SHOULDN'T

122
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,831
BE LEAVING THE ROOM, THEY SHOULD

123
00:02:58,831 --> 00:02:59,598
BE STAYING ON THE ROOM, AND WORK

124
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:00,366
IT OUT.

125
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:02,568
I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN.

126
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:03,969
IF NOT WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE

127
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,204
TO CHINA.

128
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:07,206
IF WE ARE WILLING TO STAND FIRM

129
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,808
IN REGARDS TO OUR ALLIES, WHEN

130
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,476
WE GO AFTER TO CHINA, THE BIG

131
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:11,177
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, THE ONE

132
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:14,180
THAT IS THE MOST EGREGIOUS

133
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,947
OFFENDER OF OUR TRADE POLICIES

134
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:16,148
THAT ARE AGAINST AMERICAN

135
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:17,483
INTERESTS, WE ARE GOING TO SEND

136
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,518
A MESSAGE TO CHINA THAT WE ARE

137
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,586
NOT MESSING AROUND ANYMORE.

138
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,021
IT IS TIME TO PUT AMERICAN

139
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,422
INTEREST ON THE SAME PLAYING

140
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:24,390
FIELD OF OTHERS TAKING ADVANTAGE

141
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,791
OF US FOR YEARS.

142
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,525
>> Shannon: A LOT OF FOLKS WHO

143
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,027
VOTED FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT

144
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:29,395
VERY REASON, A STRONG MESSAGE OF

145
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,363
HIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN.

146
00:03:31,363 --> 00:00:00,000
NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED.
