558
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,265
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE SOME 

559
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,032
OF THAT SURVEILLANCE CAMERA 

560
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:43,902
FOOTAGE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY 

561
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,337
LINKS OR IF THERE IS ANY SORT 

562
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,138
OF CLUE THAT THEY CAN GET FROM 

563
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,573
THAT. 

564
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,642
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT THE 

565
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:52,477
COMPONENTS OF THESE SUSPICIOUS 

566
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,778
DEVICES TO FIND A LINK. 

567
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,446
WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY 

568
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,848
INFORMATION TO THIS POINT OF 

569
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,851
ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS OUT 

570
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,285
THERE. 

571
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:00,919
INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING HARD 

572
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,088
TO TRACK SOMEONE DOWN TO 

573
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,823
PREVENT THIS FROM ESCALATING TO 

574
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,358
A POINT WHERE SOMEONE GETS 

575
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,092
INJURED. 

576
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,327
>> THEY ARE NOT SAYING THIS IS 

577
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:09,694
OVER. 

578
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,229
EVERYONE CAN JUST RELAX. 

579
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,898
THIS IS AN ON-GOING SITUATION. 

580
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,765
>> Reporter: YEAH. 

581
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,933
THIS IS A TENSE, ON-GOING 

582
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:16,234
SITUATION. 

583
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,369
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS 

584
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,105
POINT WHERE THE NEXT SUSPICIOUS 

585
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:20,805
DEVICE MIGHT POP UP. 

586
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,273
>> THEY HAVE NO FURTHER 

587
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:29,147
INFORMATION AS TO WHO MIGHT 

588
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,016
ALSO BE TARGETED? 

589
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:34,085
>> Reporter: THEY DON'T. 

590
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:35,587
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE BEING 

591
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,089
ASKED TO HANDLE ANY SUSPICIOUS 

592
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:38,890
PACKAGE CAREFULLY. 

593
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,759
THE WORD IS GETTING OUT, NOT 

594
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,160
JUST TO AVERAGE JOES, BUT 

595
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,029
MEMBERS IN CONGRESS AND OTHER 

596
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,563
PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. 

597
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:47,098
CLEARLY, WHOEVER IS BEHIND 

598
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,667
THIS, IS TARGETING PEOPLE WHO 

599
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,001
ARE FAIRLY PROMINENT PEOPLE. 

600
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,037
I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY. 

601
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:53,638
AND PROMINENT ORGANIZATIONS, 

602
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,276
GIVEN WHAT WAS SENT TO THE TIME 

603
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,479
WARNER CENTER WHERE CNN IS HEAD 

604
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:01,779
QUARTERED. 

605
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:02,781
THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION 

606
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,848
THERE FOR INVESTIGATORS TO GET 

607
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,150
THE WORD OUT WIDE SO NO ONE 

608
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,721
MAKES THE MISTAKE OF 

609
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:17,362
MISHANDLING ONE OF THESE 

610
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:17,829
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES. 

611
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:25,470
>>  LET'S BRING IN RON HOSKO 

612
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:25,870
FROM WASHINGTON. 

613
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,605
WHAT IS THE NEWS THAT MAXINE 

614
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:28,840
WATERS RECEIVED A PACKAGE? 

615
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,177
>> Reporter: NOT A SURPRISE ON 

616
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,178
BOTH COUNTS. 

617
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,380
BOTH THAT SHE WAS A RECIPIENT 

618
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,181
OR INTENDED RECIPIENT. 

619
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,649
SECONDLY THAT THE PACKAGE ENDED 

620
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,187
UP AT THE MAIL PROCESSING 

621
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,922
FACILITY FOR CONGRESS. 

622
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:49,127
I THINK IT IS THE CAPITOL 

623
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:49,794
HEIGHTS IN MARYLAND. 

624
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,295
THAT'S A GOOD THING. 

625
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:51,996
CERTAINLY THE CAPITOL POLICE 

626
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:54,265
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE 

627
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:54,598
THREAT HERE. 

628
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:57,469
HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE 

629
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,437
OF THEIR PARTICIPATION ON THE 

630
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,907
JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES OF 

631
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,142
WHAT THESE PACKAGES LOOK LIKE. 

632
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,478
THEY CAN ALERT THEIR MAIL 

633
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:06,911
PROCESSORS THERE. 

634
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:11,249
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY 

635
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,518
REFINED CAPABILITY TO INGEST 

636
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,252
THAT PACKAGE AND PROCESS IT SO 

637
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,756
IT GETS INTO THE EVIDENCE CHAIN 

638
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,058
WITH THE FBI FOR COMPARISON 

639
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:24,128
AGAINST THE OTHER DEVICES. 

640
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:26,698
THAT PROBABLY IS THE LEAST 

641
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,366
DISRUPTIVE OF THESE PACKAGES SO 

642
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,034
FAR. 

643
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,502
>> LET'S DO A COUNT NOW. 

644
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:35,573
ARE WE UP TO SIX CONFIRMED 

645
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:35,840
DEVICES? 

646
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,675
>> Reporter: SOUNDS LIKE THAT 

647
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,209
MAY BE A GOOD NUMBER. 

648
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:39,244
IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO 

649
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,778
FIND OUT THERE ARE MORE BY THE 

650
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:41,579
END OF THE DAY. 

651
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,383
>> IT TAKES A LOT OF SUSTAINED 

652
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,217
EFFORT AND ENERGY TO GET SIX 

653
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:50,021
DEVICES MADE AND OUT IN THE 

654
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:50,222
MAIL. 

655
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,824
THAT WOULD SUGGEST THIS 

656
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,892
INDIVIDUAL WAS DETERMINED. 

657
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,626
>> Reporter: UNQUESTIONABLY. 

658
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,828
LOOKING AT I FROM ANOTHER 

659
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,296
PERSPECTIVE, EACH DEVICE 

660
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,700
CREATES ANOTHER OPPORTUNITIES 

661
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,002
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETRIEVE 

662
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,903
FORENSIC INFORMATION, WHETHER 

663
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:08,073
IT IS DNA, 

664
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,443
FINGERPRINTS, A FIBER, AN 

665
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,678
IMAGE, ALL OF THOSE REPRESENTS 

666
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,281
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW 

667
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,383
ENFORCEMENT TO SUCCEED TO 

668
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,051
IDENTIFY THE OFFENDER. 

669
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,018
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS RETURN 

670
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:21,418
ADDRESS STRATEGY? 

671
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:25,256
WE CAN SEE THE RETURN ADDRESS 

672
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:27,525
OF ONE IS DEBBIE SCHULTZ. 

673
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,593
DOES THAT SUGGEST THE SENDER 

674
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:32,030
HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF 

675
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,263
HUMOR? 

676
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:36,768
>> Reporter: YEAH. 

677
00:25:36,768 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S MY
