more than 1.4 million Afghans are expected to lose the right to stay in Pakistan after the government said it'll no longer extend their refugee status their legal status officially expired on December the 31st but the Pakistani cabinet extended their stay by one month some have spent the last 35 years living in Pakistan kamal Haider has more from a refugee camp near the main city in the area of Peshawar ongoing tensions with the United States and worsening relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan has created a new problem for the of one refugees the Pakistani said that these refugee camps spread across the country catering to about 1.4 million registered of one refugees and an equal number of unregistered refugees have become a security risk Pakistan is pushing pressure now that they these refugees should be taken back into Afghanistan and so that once that is done then we will be more able to say that we are not allowing any sanctuaries within its own territory more than 3.5 million upon refugees who have been living in Pakistan for the last 30 or 40 years now and often Taliban and other actors which are militarily active against the Afghan government are part of that whole refugee community that lives and they go back and forth and that pulls in Pakistan into this because it is from here that infiltrators are able to use as a safe sanctuary and then carry out attacks across the country the Interior Minister and the intelligence chief of Afghanistan are already here in Pakistan to discuss the rising tensions between the two countries the Pakistani will be telling their f1 counterparts that it is time for these refugees to go back but it entails huge logistical issues the biggest problem at the moment is that there's the winter break all the centres are temporarily suspended and catchment centres in Afghanistan and repatriation centres in Pakistan as far as funds are concerned there donor fatigue there are competing priorities so yes that does prove to be a challenge that UNHCR faces and yes it does appeal to the international community to continue to provide assistance to the on refugee situation as well the Pakistani government is likely to give a few more months for the repatriation of the Afghan refugees but these people complain that they cannot go back to a country torn apart by conflict and go back to a country which has nothing to offer to them with Illig wassalamu Delarue alta we can't afford to go back to a war-torn country where we have no shelter no jobs and above all no peace so how we are going to survive we want to go back happily one situation allows many of one refugees have already come back from Afghanistan complaining that their government is not doing enough
