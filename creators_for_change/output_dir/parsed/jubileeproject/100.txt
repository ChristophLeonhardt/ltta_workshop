it's been like an adventure and she
shared half that adventure and I've
shared half of her adventure in our life
because we're old or older my name is
Candice I've been with my husband 37
years one long day I'm Howard I would
say it's been a learning experience
and I hope that I can graduate before
it's all over with
I was visiting a friend who was a
paparazzi who was trying to get the
money shot of Loni Anderson and Burt
Reynolds never did and we just happened
to bump into each other 37 years ago and
we clicked
are you hearing him through that no not
on anything at all no not at all
I'm listening to Bob Marley I'm jamming
at the time I had a Corvette Stingray
and I had my own personal license plate
miss Bowen he was there with a friend of
his who was a paparazzi not a fan and I
see these guys surrounded my car so I go
so what's up and so they said oh really
like the personal by simply so I said
really he said yeah I miss Bowen he says
I think that's cool ice all right I said
how'd you like to meet her he says yeah
I just reach my hand out I said how you
doing I'm miss Bowen you're gonna take
off by Marty now I came out of the north
and I said I need a woman who I cannot
intimidate and I wanted a tattoo and I
wanted a new nickname and the day before
I met her
I had the tattoo guy down in Skid Row
put this on my arm how has well at the
beginning it was rough you know I'm
saying mom Candis and I are engaged
she said if a turtle and the bird falls
in love where are they going to build a
house that's what she said to me and as
the years went by
and they I guess they realized that we
weren't an in-and-out burger but they
start coming around anyway and my mom
didn't think twice he's a man who loves
my daughter he just happens to be a Jew
I had a tremendous amount of adjustment
I fell in love with a woman who was from
a whole different culture it was hard to
adjust sometimes to it I didn't
understand it at all and I had to live
through it and sometimes I'd get angry
for behind it and sometimes I would get
dumbfounded behind it and sometimes I
laugh at it you know I mean it's just
it's been a strong part of the journey
that Candis and I have been on for these
many many decades Bob Marley no woman no
cry
go ahead oh you and I want to know what
mr. well they can edit they can edit
anything you know and they wanted
losing our parents and supporting each
other through that that process the
passing of my mom and my dad and my
sister lost their life I think those are
the difficult times you're in so much
pain and physically emotionally someone
can be there for you you know we've
buried a lot of our people
her parents my parents my step parents
that's the worst thing that can happen
to a you know to a human being is to
lose you know a loved one and certainly
they were all loved how do you think
we're orphans we start laughing at each
other but going through it going through
it was you know when I lost my mom cuz
my mom was very young 62 you know
that was a shock to me you know when the
other person is in distress you come
close to the dying from it yourself you
know you got to take all the pressure
off that a person and make it happen
to get get it resolved if I were to ask
you to the other person what they mean
to you that was my best friend
Kandice is my best friend and also
occupies a very large part in my heart
