LAWYER. I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME. Shannon: I DO TOO. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU BACK. THIS CASE IS NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON. PLEASE COME BACK, JULIAN AND JOHN. HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN TRYING TO QUIET THE REBILLING WITHIN THE RANKS, GROWING NUMBER OF MODERATE REMOVAL OF THE TRYING TO FORCE A VOTE ON FOUR DIFFERENT IMMIGRATION MEASURES THINK IT'S TIME TO SETTLE THE DACA ISSUE. CONGRESSMAN JEFF DENHAM SAYS IT'S HE IS LEADING THE CHARGE TO FORCE BRYAN'S HAND THAT WOULD GIVE DREAMERS A PATHWAY TO LEGAL STATUS. IT'S A 12 YEAR PROCESS. I BELIEVE THE EARNED PATHWAY, THE EARNED PROCESS, WOULD PUT YOU AT THE BACK OF THE LINE BUT CERTAINLY SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN HERE WHO'S GRADUATED FROM OUR SCHOOLS THAT'S BEEN IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER UNDER OBAMA SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. Shannon: JEFF DENHAM HAS THE SUPPORT OF MINORITY LEADER DEMOCRAT NANCY PELOSI. G.O.P. LEADERS ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM SAYING THAT MOVING FORWARD COULD HURT REPUBLICANS IN THE FALL ELECTION. JIM JORDAN IS A REPUBLICAN FROM OHIO AND MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS. YOU GUYS MADE A BOLD MOVE TODAY. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. THE FARM BILL IS A HUGE DEAL. YOU GUYS ARE SAYING I'M A CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, YOU DON'T WANT TO VOTE ON THAT UNTIL YOU GET A VOTE ON SOMETHING RELATED TO IMMIGRATION WHICH IS THAT THE CHAIRMAN GOODLETT BILL. IS THERE GOING TO BE A VOTE ON THE FARM BILL TOMORROW? WE WILL SEE. A COUPLE THINGS TO START, THE GOODLATTE BILL IS THE BILL THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE MANDATE OF THE 2016 ELECTION ON IMMIGRATION. IT DOES THINGS IN THE RIGHT ORDER. IT SAYS BUILD THE BORDER SECURED A WALL. END CHAIN MIGRATION, STOP ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LIST. AND THEN IT SAYS AFTER REDO IT, WE WILL DO IT THE DACA SITUATION. THE CONCERN AND I HAVE WITH WHAT MR. DENHAM IS DOING IS THAT IT'S FINE TO USE THE RULES ANYWAY YOU CAN TO GET SOMETHING DONE BUT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE RULES I THINK TO ACCOMPLISH A GOAL THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE MANDATE OF THE ELECTION, NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WE ARE GOING TO DO. THAT'S OUR PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE KIND OF LINK TO DO THE FARM BILL BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE RIGHT THING DONE ON IMMIGRATION AS WELL. Shannon: HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER REPUBLICAN KEVIN McCARTHY SET I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THEM A VOTE ON GOODLATTE'S SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTY. IT IS ONE THING TO BE TOLD SOMETHING. IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR IT TO HAPPEN. RIGHT NOW THE DEMOCRATS AREN'T VOTING FOR THE FARM BILL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN TIE INTO THIS IMMIGRATION DEBATE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WE WERE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ON IMMIGRATION. I LIKE THE WELFARE REFORM IN THE FARM BILL, FOOD STAMP REFORM, I THINK IT'S NEEDED, THE WORK REQUIREMENTS. I LIKE THAT BUT I ALSO WANT TO GET IMMIGRATION RIGHTS. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A GROUP OF COLLEAGUES, WELL-INTENTIONED MEMBERS WHO ARE PUSHING SOMETHING DIFFERENT, THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE MANDATE OF THE ELECTION. THAT'S A CONCERN AND THAT'S MY WEEK IN THE FREEDOM CAUCUS ARE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE. TIMEOUT. I ALWAYS HATE US. WE MAKE THIS JOB WAY TOO HARD. IT. SIMPLE. WHAT DO WE TELL THE VOTERS WE ARE GOING TO DO? WE DIDN'T TELL THEM WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME KIND OF BILL ALONE WHICH WILL BE THE RESULT OF WHAT THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER ON THIS DISCHARGE POSITION AND THE PROCESS THEY ARE USING. WE DID TELL THEM WE WOULD BUILD THE BOARD OR SECURITY WALL, END CHAIN MIGRATION OF A DEAL WITH THE VISA LOTTERY AND WHEN WE DO ALL THAT WE WILL ALSO DEAL WITH DACA. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. Shannon: TO THE RIGHT OF YOU, YOU COULD ARGUE CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING TWEETING "HOLY COW. FREEDOM CAUCUS IS LINKING AMNESTY BILL TO FARMVILLE. DO I HAVE TO START AN ANTI-AMNESTY CAUCUS? " CONSERVATIVES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNDERSTAND THE GOODLATTE LEGISLATION IS CONSERVATIVE AND THE KIND OF LEGISLATION WE NEED AND DOES WHAT I DESCRIBED. IT'S GOT 20 SOME DIFFERENT POLICY AREAS THAT THOSE DOWN. WE HAVE ASKED OUR LEADERSHIP FOR A VOTE ON THAT. THEY HAVE PROMISED TO GET THAT. IT IS YET TO HAPPEN. THAT PROMISE WAS GIVEN MONTHS AGO. ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE IT DOES IN FACT ACTUALLY HAPPEN. Shannon: I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ASK YOU ABOUT THE TOUGHEST STORY TOP STORY ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS. THE MUELLER TEAM TURNED OVER THE MEMO THAT OUTLINES HIS POWERS, THE AUTHORITIES THAT HE WAS TASKED TO DO. FEDERAL JUDGE DEMANDED HE TURNED IT OVER UNREDACTED. SO THE FEDERAL JUDGE HAS IT. YOU DON'T HAVE IT. YOU ARE A COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. I KNOW YOU HAVE ASKED FOR. CONGRESS IN MEADOWS AND I SENT A LETTER ON APRIL 9TH AND WE ACTUALLY ASKED ROD ROSENSTEIN A COUPLE IS LATER. HE SAID NO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW IT TO YOU. THEY SENT US A LETTER SAYING TAKE A HIKE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW TO YOU. THEN THE SAME WEEK THEY TOLD US THAT, THE JUDGE SAYS I WANT TO SEE IT AND HE GOT TO SEE TODAY. HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THE ENTIRE SCOPE, THE ENTIRE PERIMETER THAN FRAMEWORK OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE GUY THEY ELECTED PRESIDENT. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT. IN THE INITIAL SCOPE WAS ONE YEAR AGO THIS DAY, MAY 17 LETTER, MAY 17 MEMORANDUM, ROD ROSENSTEIN ALTERED, AMENDED, CHANGE, CLARIFY THAT IN SOME FASHION ON AUGUST 2. AND ALL WE HAVE GOT TO SEE IS A LITTLE BIT OF THAT THAT DEALT WITH PAUL MANAFORT. WE WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE THING, JUST LIKE THE FEDERAL JUDGE. MORE PORTLY, YOU IN THE PRESS NEED TO SEE IT AND MOST IMPORTANT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO SEE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ELECTED THIS PRESIDENT. AND THE PART THAT JUST DRIVES ME CRAZY IS BROAD ROSENSTEIN WAS NEVER ELECTED TO ANYTHING. I AM ON THE BALLOT EVERY TWO YEARS. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED. THIS IS A SEPARATE AND EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS THING WE NEED TO SEE IT ON A WHOLE HOST OF DOCUMENTS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET OUR HANDS ON. MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO GET OUR JOB DO OUR JOB. Shannon: I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN COOPERATING WITH YOU ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. THIS NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS. LET US KNOW IF YOU GET THE SCOPE
