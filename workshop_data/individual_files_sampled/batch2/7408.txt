after the election Donald Trump couldn't handle the fact that even though he won the electoral vote he did not win the popular vote in fact Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the millions and Trump's response to that was that there was voter fraud that millions of people voted illegally as a result he created something known as the as the election integrity Commission which wanted to investigate this so-called fraud part of their investigation included the collection of voter rolls in every state now of course that brings up some privacy concerns and as a result an organization known as the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a lawsuit now there is some pretty devastating news in regard to this lawsuit because an appeals court in Washington has just ruled against epic or the Electronic Privacy Information Center now in its ruling the three-judge panel said the following that the Electronic Privacy Information Center is not a voter as far as the record shows it has no traditional membership let alone members who are voters unsurprisingly then it does not claim standing on behalf of any voter whose data is likely to be collected the nonprofit group sued the panel in July to halt its attempt to gather publicly available voter data from States which by the way includes people's names addresses birthdays birth dates and also their social security numbers the four final digits of their social security numbers yeah so look this is an arguable decision they they're not judging the merit of the case at all they're just saying that you don't have standing meaning the you're not the person who can sue them there might be other people who could sue the administration but it's not you because you're not directly affected because you're a group and you're not a voter okay so I hope a voter Sue's so they're the problem with authoritarian governments and we've now seen this across the world is that once they win in a kind of a democracy they almost always don't get a majority of the vote and in as you know famously Donald Trump did not get a majority of the vote and so they sneak in through whatever means that in this case its are incredibly antiquated and preposterous electoral college system and then they go oh well now that we're in let's now start to rig the system so that even though we're grossly unpopular Donald Trump's popularity is f32 percent here to win any election that way right but all of a sudden to get all your the voter information god knows what they can do with that right so one of their main goal is to fight voter fraud it's a Kris Kobach is the leader of that witch hunt and and it's a lie it's a lie it's infinitesimally small every single news organization that has looked into it has shown you that it is it barely negligible what is gigantic is voter suppression when they get like a hatchet man like Kobach to go and try to eliminate a bunch of voters so that hey look you might have the majority of the country but I eliminated a lot of your voters and and Donald Trump talked about rigging the system why cuz every conservative does projections whatever is in their head they attributed to their opponents he wants to rig the election so he said Oh beforehand when he thought he was gonna lose its rank this rigged afterwards he's like oh it's awesome yeah it's wonderful right right now trading it right well and he's so egotistical that he can't handle the fact that he lost the popular vote and won't take any responsibility or ownership of the fact that he is an unpopular president and goes ahead and says oh it's it's fraud it has nothing to do with me okay but here's the thing that I have an issue with is anyone comfortable whether you're a Democrat or Republican liberal progressive conservative is anyone comfortable with the federal government or the Justice Department in this case collecting all of this information on every voter in the United States without telling us what they plan on doing with that information without telling us how they plan to safeguard that information some of that information sure is is publicly available but are you comfortable with you know the last four digits of your social security number your address your phone number all things being collected and and monitored by the federal government that is literally that's the definition of big government that is Big Brother watching so for all of those conservatives out there who are always arguing for smaller government you should be really concerned about the fact that they're doing this right now that they're fighting tooth and nail to collect all of this information about every voter and they plan on monitoring them that's not okay know that if Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama did it you'd be losing your mind if you're concerned and you know it's not fair Jake we would be losing our mind if Obama or Hillary did it we would be losing our mind we wouldn't be sitting at this desk right now arguing about this we would be you know talking about how it needs to stop immediately we would be in favor of those who were suing them but we're not in a fair fight and that's the frustrating part about it right you have one side that wants to play fair you have the other side that has no interest in playing fair whatsoever right as long as it's a person from their tribe a person from their party they will support what that individual does tooth and nail but you got to keep in mind that Republicans won't be in power forever and when Democrats come into office and they get to utilize these same strategies are you gonna be in favor of it well that's another problem with the uneven playing field look if it's a establish from a Democrat I have no idea what they're gonna do and they might abuse it and so good luck with that okay but I don't want them doing that I don't but if it's a progressive they know it's there well like what is Bernie Sanders going to abuse this to rig elections it's inconceivable and they know it they know that by and large the right wing's are our guys are the only cheaters so they're like well let's set up a system where we can cheat we know the other suckers won't do it because they're honest so look god help us all if you got an establishment Democrat who wants to do stuff like this - because I don't put it above them you probably don't put it above them and I don't want people cheating but look in so that you're clear on this local governments have voter rolls because you have to know if the person voting is a citizen has it lives there and can vote that is normal that happens all across the country that is no problem this is the federal government collecting this information for what and they won't tell you why if it was Obama you would say it was to set up FEMA camps if they wanted to get information about your guns you'd be in the streets yeah but they're getting it about you it's a little bit more personal than your gun and you're like oh yes as long as it's my orange leader I'm fine with it it's not fine it's intrusions into our privacy and anti-democratic moves like this are not fine no matter who's
