The day before inauguration,
I was at the White House.
We're doing hair and make up, and
the first lady, she looked at me and said,
“Hervé, do you know that tomorrow your
name will be all over the news?”
I didn't realize the scale until
suddenly my phone was going ballistic.
Before, I was under the radar.
Nobody really knew who I was
except the people in fashion.
Not under my name, but I dressed
all the other first ladies.
My mother, the
other day, she said,
“I cannot find a picture
of you in a bad mood.”
I'm always like — I'm
always happy, I guess.
When I came to New York, I
worked for Oscar de la Renta.
It was fascinating for me to already
work on an inauguration dress.
Afterwards, when I was
at Carolina Herrera,
I worked with Mrs. Bush a lot.
And then, there was a state
dinner for Mrs. Obama.
But now I am on my own.
It's a new beginning for me.
When you're on your own, I go for
like different kind of customers.
That's what I really,
really, really enjoy.
I love the stork.
I don't know why.
What changed a little bit in
January is when I designed
the dress for the first lady
for the inauguration ball.
I never, never, never,
never met her before.
And it was 10 days
before inauguration.
I received a phone call at
8 o'clock in the morning, in my PJs.
And I had to deliver sketches
at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
And I was not prepared for that.
It was around noon.
And I touched this for good luck.
And I said, please, please,
I was begging for the muse to come.
And eventually, they came.
Because I remember I gave —
I believe it was six options.
When she saw the sketches, 
she said,
“Well, what is appealing 
with you is like,
I will be able to have
something specifically made
for a specific occasion.
Would you like to do that?”
And I said, “Absolutely.”
For me, it was a big honor
to dress the first lady,
this time under my name.
Well, about the controversy
of this White House,
I don't have so much to say.
I'm here to speak about fashion.
The thing that I would say, is that's
the beauty of New York and this country.
It's a democracy.
So some people want to
work with certain people.
Some people don't want to.
I choose to —
I choose to do it.
If you forget about
political whatever —
the very specific needs
are so interesting.
When you have a customer who
is telling you, who said,
“OK. I have a visit — a state visit
next week with the queen of Jordan.”
Or to see a pope.
I mean, who — for a designer
to create a dress to go to see
the pope, it doesn't
happen to you every day.
It's a very unusual request
for a very specific customer.
You see? That's nice.
Oh, yes. Yes. That's very good.
We do have a mannequin
for the first lady. Of course.
But I won't show it to you.
That's really like
the naked body, you know?
There is no —
I'm still naive about it.
The scale of a decision that
is made between two people is
going to spread like ink —
it's like huge.
Even if I'm not
creating the clothes,
what is creating is to see
what kind of message and how
it's going to be perceived.
Suddenly, this picture is
forever in the newspapers,
in history.
You really have to answer the
wardrobe of a woman who is
going to be photographed
all over the world.
You walk on eggs.
God knows you walk on eggs
because you never know.
When you're 6 years old,
you think that you just need
to sing and snap your finger,
and the dress is
going to be made.
You will learn the hard way a
little bit later that it's not so easy.
But I took the challenge.
