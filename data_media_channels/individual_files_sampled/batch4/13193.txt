all right the Andrew Clavin show is on the air I'm not gonna do an open today I'm not feeling all that funny after the events in Las Vegas and we'll skip the song because the Clavin last weekend's would have got a little bit more serious than we'd like it to and I'm not feeling actually all that hunky dunky as I'm speaking I'm not going to be talking about this all day and I'll explain why in a couple minutes but you know as I'm speaking the death count in this Las Vegas shooting is up to 58 was the last I heard the injuries are over 500 worst mass shooting in American history worse than the Orlando shooting a while back here's the president addressing the nation hundreds of our fellow citizens are now mourning the sudden loss of a loved one a parent a child a brother or sister we cannot fathom their pain we cannot imagine their loss to the families of the victims we are praying for you and we are here for you and we ask God to help see you through this very dark period scripture teaches us the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit we seek comfort in those words for we know that God lives in the hearts of those who grieve to the wounded who are now recovering in hospitals we are praying for your full and speedy recovery and pledge to you our support from this day forward you know when I first saw this I woke up I didn't know about this until I woke up this morning and might the first words that went through my mind were of some evil clown has opened fire on on people and I immediately was struck by the irony of that because obviously there's this hit movie it now it actually features an evil clown based on the Stephen King book and I was suddenly thinking oh but that evil is not actually an evil clown that evil clown is a creation of an artist who's trying to entertain you a bunch of movie makers trying to amuse you entertain you scare you in the in the good way that evil clown was actually a work of art which is always a good thing this evil clown is actually an evil clown and that's one of the things that is very tough when we are in this divided state in this partisan position that we're in now where everybody's so angry all the time we're constantly using that word evil and you know behind the scenes the people here at the Daily wire where most of us have become very close friends and we have these political arguments all the time because we have all these differences and we want to iron them out and obviously we all want to hear what the other person has to say and try and convince one another and one of the things that people are always hammering me about is that I won't let them use the word evil unless it describes evil you know when they talk about Barack Obama I always say Barack Obama is not evil that's not what evil looks like and you know Donald Trump is not evil if you whether you agree with them or not on any given day whether you like his behavior and if in any given day that's not evil and the reason I feel that that's important even though it annoys people because they want to use that word they want to go to that word is when you get to the level of evil you're now talking about extreme action that Guy'd like the guy who opened fire in Las Vegas you want to kill him that's really the only thing there is to do but with the rest of us you want to talk you want to argue you don't want to use words like oh this is a war I don't want to say oh this guy is evil because even if the consequences of something a politician is doing or bad that doesn't necessarily mean he intends evil to anybody and I don't think Barack Obama who I obviously didn't like very much and thought he was an incompetent I don't think he intended evil to people I don't think Donald Trump intends evil to people that's one of the reasons I get so annoyed with the way the press covers this and the way people talk about it I'll explain in a moment why we're not going to talk about this all day long but we're not going to talk about all day long I have a lot of want to say about Puerto Rico and the way the coverage is coming and Michael Noel's host of the Michael Noel's show we'll be with us to discuss the developments about the NFL and other things and a lot of people say to me you know why Michael Knowles and the reason is we didn't use zip recruiter com you know I was just sitting in a bar I'd had a few and I said does anybody want a podcast at the Daily wire and Noel's was you know there was this kind of cloud of smoke and I saw a figure moving through the cloud of smoke and Knowles came out of it and I thought oh all right you know you do a podcast because look you look nice but if you're smart see if you want great talent for your business and you're short on time the better thing to do is to go to zip recruiter comm with zip recruiter you can post your job to over a hundred of the web's leading job boards with just one click so you can rest easy knowing your job is being seen by the right candidates and then what the zip recruiter does is it puts it's smart matching technology to work it actively notifies qualified candidates about your job within minutes of the posting so you receive the best possible matches and that's why zip recruiter is different you know it's 80% of employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate through the site in just one day that really is different unlike other hiring sites as a recruiter doesn't depend on the right candidates finding you it finds them zip recruiter is the smartest way to hire and you can find out today why is it recruiter has been used by growing businesses of all sizes and industries to find the most qualified job candidates with immediate results and right now my listeners can post jobs on zip recruiter for free so that's an easy choice to make right it's free just go to zip recruiter comm slash daily Wire zip recruiter comm slash daily wire and one more time to try it for free go to zip recruiter dot-com slash daily wired don't let Michael moles happen to you all right now the reason I'm not gonna talk about this all day is that there's not that much to say you know the common commentating is something that you do when things need comment but when somebody opens fire on people this was a three-day Country Music Festival they were in an open area in Las Vegas this madman went to the hi room in a nearby hotel hammered out the windows and then opened fire with what sounded to me like automatic weapon I mean it just say yeah was I fired semi-automatic weapons and this didn't sound like that it sounded like fully automatic weapons and he he then killed himself as the police were going in his here's his brother the guys name is Steven Patek and his brother Eric paddock has no idea why he did this Isis is claiming credit for this I'm not Bob wait and see I'm not buying that that's like me claiming credit for like writing Shakespeare's plays I think Isis at this point Isis is about the Islamic state is about to be like an outhouse in a desert you know after our military gets through with them so they're gonna claim as much damage as they possibly can here's the shooters brother just saying he doesn't know what happened he looks as baffled as anybody I mean he's never even drawn his gun it makes no sense he's never hit anybody he's never done enthusiasts or just yeah you know he had a safe with a couple handguns he might have had one long rifle but he didn't have any I mean he had no automatic weapons when that I know that I knew over at any time I there's no it just just makes no sense that's now being reported that the guy's father was a bank robber who was on the FBI's most wanted list so there's some kind of history there but again it's just too early to know so I don't want it go off speculating here's the reason I don't want to talk about this all day when you at this point like I said this is a job for the police not for a commentator this is a job where the police go and gather information and do the actual job of gathering information this is a job for the terrific people who work in the hospital's who take care of people who were injured people who are in shock so many I mean over 500 they've you know obviously these were people who went out to party that you know they some of them that probably didn't even know they were hurt until much later and some of them may not even know whether they're hurt they're in such shock when I see people trying to politicize these things and and because the left owns the media it does it starts with the left right we know how it works if a Muslim does it well it's not all Muslims but if a white supremacist does it then everybody in the GOP is somehow guilty of being a white supremacist i if it's a Bernie bro like it was at the softball game in Washington well we can't blame Bernie bros but you know obviously it you know if it has anything to do with the right wing then suddenly all right wingers are to blame and if they can do nothing else they it's the anti second amendment agenda Hillary Clinton tweeted this morning oh you know the people were running because they heard the gunfire imagine how bad it would be if the NRA had its way and you could buy silencers as if this guy was limited in his actions by the law I feel there you know I would like to put a silencer on Hillary Clinton so that like when she opened her mouth nothing came out but like that's that's neither here nor there so what happens we fight back we fight back and we say no you know this is the you know it's not about guns it is about Bernie it's not about you know it is about Muslims whatever and and then and we become part of it and we become part of it all the while all I can think is there's some the mom and dad sent their kid off to a concert yesterday to a concert and the kids not coming home you know and like god that's all I can think about is like you're standing next to your wife having a good time suddenly your wife is gone suddenly your husband's gone you know that's all I can think about no I can't bring myself to get into that conversation I cannot bring myself I don't want to allow myself to be dragged down into that conversation the fact is the fact is whether Islam is a problem or white supremacist or is a problem or not a problem is something that you look at over time that's something you see over time if there's one incident that illustrates that using that to as the as the building block of a larger narrative is kind of despicable the narrative is going to be there after the incident is gone after these people are healed you know the the wounded are healed after the debt or mourned that believe me the landscape is going to be there the political landscape is going to be what it is and I don't I don't want to be dragged dragged down in it you know this is something that's happening all over that in in our entire society is that you feel like you have to fight back the voices of the left especially have so much power they have so many is so much of the media they have so much of the entertainment media they have so much of the educated education classes the academies and all that stuff that you always feel like you have to get fight back and and and that is a lot of what's going on so so let's let's turn from this now because there's not that much more to say about it but but let's turn things now to take a look at what I mean when we're talking about this hurricane that's hit Puerto Rico right first we had the Russians you know Donald Trump was a Russian spy baloney then we had the Charlotte ville you know Donald Trump is a racist baloney where it was that Donald Trump said that there were good people among the neo-nazis which I will get back to that and I will show you that that is not what he said and they are intentionally twisting that now we have Puerto Rico is Katrina yeah it's like CNN is basically reporting its daydreams at this point they're having they're having trouble getting supplies and relief to proto Rico in ways they didn't have trouble getting supplies and relief to when the Hurricanes hit there and some of this most of this is because FEMA is not that the federal government didn't get the supplies and the people there on time it did okay but FEMA was not prepared for the level of a corruption the Union corruption that is in Puerto Rico and it was not prepared for the level of just absolute destruction you know the infrastructure there is not any good you know and now the entire place is shut down without electricity so FEMA is kind of bungling some of this it's not that you know Trump didn't make sure that all the people got there it's that the logistics on the ground are really difficult Trump did make I think one mistake there's an act at what's called the Jones Act I think that it requires that you use American shipping to send stuff to Puerto Rico and at first he didn't suspend it and then he suspended it for 10 days which is not gonna be enough he should just suspend it I mean I know that the shippers don't want this to happen they like their little monopoly tough tough you know get the stuff to the people so now the mayor of San Juan which is the only city in Puerto Rico anybody knows about the mayor of San Juan far-left this Carmen cruse her name is she starts criticizing Trump and obviously trying to build up this Katrina narrative she shows up on TV with a path that says help us or t-shirt I'm sorry this has helped us we are dying and she starts saying the Trump doesn't do a good job and Donald Trump responds his usual grace by just opening up on her he says you know the problem is that he says such poor leadership there's a tweet such poor leadership ability by the mayor of San Juan and others in Puerto Rico who are not able to get their workers to help they want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort obviously a graceless thing to say when people are in trouble but you know we're so tired of the politicization of everything and it seemed clear it seemed clear that this very very left-wing mayor of San Juan had been positioned told to go out because before this happened the people in Puerto Rico were saying no Donald Trump is helping us out he's sending us the stuff we need and suddenly you know suddenly they're criticizing him it did seem a political thing so now Trump as he always does he overreacts especially when he's personally attacked and the media goes nuts and what's their narrative yes guess what the narrative is the problem is that the people in Puerto Rico are brown right that is the problem as if there were no black people in trouble in Texas you know that's that wasn't a thing as nothing like that nothing nothing like that in Louisiana but here's ears just brian Stelter just - just as a sample of what CNN is selling this week in their garbage sale at best the president's tweets are insensitive today I think it worse Fred they are a racist dog whistle a disgraceful reaction to what he's seen on television he he's clearly watching the mayor of San Juan on CNN and other channels calling for more help begging for more help and in reacting this way I think it's personally beyond the pale and I'm presidential I think it's a tough situation for journalists because we've got a call at that we could identify what we're seeing I'm so glad that all of our reporters there and in in Puerto Rico are describing what's actually happening on the ground and I hope the president in between his golf game today watches more of those reports from the ground rather than just impulsively reacting to what he's seen from the mayor of San Juan thanks Brian for pouring oil on the troubled waters of the country but I sure q no come on so of course this is the two-step right it's not just the new it's not just the media the left-wing media which it all is it's ice also the politicians then know that they can show up and say these outrageous things I mean come on does anybody think does anybody think truly think that Donald Trump woke up and said we're not gonna send anything to Puerto Rico those people are brown you know I mean it's come on I mean come on so Bernie Sanders right who should be hiding away on any day when a a mad shooter goes nuts he comes out and he hammers the narrative home the White House denies it but there are a lot of critics who say that race or ethnicity might be playing a factor here what do you think well look given the president's history on race given the fact that he a few months ago told us that there were good people on both sides when neo-nazis will watching in Charlottesville yeah I think we have a right to be suspect that he is treating the people of Puerto Rico in a different way than he has treated the people of texas or Florida okay now let's just stop here for a minute because this is part of what happens in the media and this is part of the way it works they start with a lie we on the right debunk the lie they kind of back off it but then they circle back around and then the lie becomes enshrined in the narrative so now Bernie Sanders can go and speak the lie about Charlottesville as if it were just part of what we all accept to be history all right let's go back for a minute because this has really bothered me for a while let's go back and look at what Trump said that day all right he was speaking as the reporters as they constantly do were interrupting him not letting him get a word in because they are so it is so important for us to hear the reporters voices and opinions that we don't want to listen to the President of the United States you know we just want to hear them and he's saying I want to read this I don't want him to say it because I want to be able to analyze it as I go Trump is talking over them he says excuse me they didn't put themselves down as neo-nazis and you had so any and you had some very bad people in that group in other words the people who came to protest the tearing down of statues were not all neo-nazis but yes there were some of them who were neo-nazis there were bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides who had people in that group and then he says excuse me excuse me because he's being shouted down he says excuse me I saw the same pictures you did you had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a part from Robert II lead to another name so when he said they were fine people in that group he was not speaking about neo-nazis and if the press didn't want wanted to clear that up they would ask him do they ever ask him no why because they want it like this they want us to be divided they want us to hate one another the right and the left you know not that far look the far right the far left are always gonna be a daggers drawn but I am talking about conservatives and liberals they want us to hate one another so that we don't communicate because they are Democrats and they can sell as long as they can sell the the narrower that the right is evil they can sell you the crappy policies of the Democrats the non-working failed policies of the Democrats if they ever had to assume if I say you know if I say gee I disagree with tearing down the statue of Robert Ely if they ever have to assume well maybe he has some good reason for saying that maybe has some positive reason maybe it may be as he likes his fellow Americans and he says that why would he say that when it seems so strange to me they ever would say that they would destroy their own narrative just to add to this just to say you know I've told you what I think about what's going wrong in Puerto Rico but here is a colonel in the United States Army Michael a valet I think his name is VA ll e he's a commander of the hundred and first Air and Space Operations Group and director of the joint air component quarter coordination element first air force responsible for hurricane Maria relief as the hurricane in in Puerto Rico and the efforts to to bring you know the relief there he is a first-hand witness of the US Department of Defense response supporting FEMA in Puerto Rico and he is a pretty Rican himself with family members living in the debt devastation he says his passion for the people is second for none and of the criticism he says it's just not true I have family here my parents home is here my uncles aunts cousins are all here as a Puerto Rican I can tell you that the problem has nothing to do with the US military FEMA where the DoD the aid is getting to Puerto Rico the problem is distribution the federal government has sent us a lot of help moving those supplies in particular fuel is the issue right now and and they just can't get the generators and all this stuff so it this is part this is part of what I'm talking about when I'm talking about the shooting in Vegas what I'm talking about this we feel like we have to strike back they lie they pour lie on lie on lie they even even offhanded things where they just say oh in Charlottesville he said this a lie and making a lie part of the narrative he didn't say it he didn't say it so we feel we have to strike back and then we're brought down to that level and not only do we feel we have to strike back in many ways I feel that we have elected a president who will strike back I've been saying this again and again and we're gonna take a break in a minute but I've been again and again that Trump was elected he was elected to fight back against these people and his rudeness and is sometimes bullying and sometimes he's saying things that are untoward are part of the fact part of the reason the people who love him love him is because they've been hammered by these people they get hammered on the late-night comedy shows they get hammered at the movie award ceremonies they get hammered in their rock songs they get hammered in the news shows they get hammered every day and this is the only way they could get anyone powerful enough with a big enough voice to strike back but what does it do to us and that's what I'm gonna deal with at the end of today's show when we get to our crappy culture but first we're gonna go to Michael Noel's but first before we go to Michael Noel's we are going to talk about how beautiful my head looks you know I was watching I was watching Noel's I could see him on the camera noses in the studio next where he's in his studio right yeah so he's in his studio and our wonderful makeup lady Jess who I just you know obviously just was the reason I'm sitting here today if word for just this face you know it looked like the last reel in a vampire movie after the Sun comes up it's like but I was watching just spray stuff on noses here because Noel's actually has hair now not many people know it's a toupee but no it's not I'm jealous you know you spray stuff on noses head but she doesn't have to spray stuff on because I am a member of

Knowles Knowles hey hey your hair looks marvelous I can't believe you told them about the toupee I've managed to keep it under wraps for 27 years but but it's a good one I gotta say so this week I didn't want to just keep talking about the NFL I'm a big NFL fan and I could just go off on it every week and I I have just been first of all I wrote a piece at PGA meteor that you can go over and look at it Clavin on the culture where I just say I thought Trump was 100% right about this I thought he got it exactly right absolute I've said it on the show is it still going on I mean I'm not I'm not gonna watch until they stop doing it so is it still going on you may be a big NFL fan I am NOT a big NFL fan it will not surprise you to find out I was not the quarterback of my high school or college team you know the waterboy this is the most NFL I've ever had to watch South Park actually joked about this that everyone's just tuning in to see if they stand or kneel or not and then I do now which their ratings seem to bear out but it's gone on again we have a little run I actually we don't have enough time for me to read everybody who knelt and stood but just a quick run down six Seattle Seahawks at 30 49ers knelt drunk hit and run driver Marshawn Lynch of the Oakland Raiders wore in everybody versus trumps shirt one York giant now Baltimore Ravens and Steelers all knelt to massive boos and then they stood up when the national anthem was actually sung trying to have their cake and eat it too okay doesn't work fellas six Buffalo Bills knelt one Tennessee Titan stayed in the locker room New Orleans Saints took in a three dolphins knelt the Jacksonville Jaguars knelt before the anthem - boos - Detroit Lions knelt everybody else tap-dance derp did a little sachet I don't know it's very complicated that I will say that the LA Rams I tuned them in just to see and they did not kneel one guy raised his fist or something yeah there were some raised fists around but it is true the LA Rams all stood yeah good on a my or any - I thought so but so so what's the reaction I mean you know what I love about this by the way I get this on my iPad they send me the news and it is the it basically is si ranting about Trump and so what a bad week Donald Trump had because he criticized the NFL and I thought and I'm not so sure what are the people saying I first of all I loved Byron York had this piece out today the headline was on game day new polls show that Americans what Americans think about NFL protests and Trump and I thought he was actually joking he is referring to real polls but the polls are that nobody is watching these games this is drew I mean of course all of these polls the kneeling protests have massive disapproval across the American people and Donald Trump's handling of it is basically 50/50 people are split on whether they like that he's weighing in but they despise the protests there is this phenomenon going on now which is that people NFL fans are holding public burnings of their memorabilia out of their season tickets you know this is just before but I laugh when you say that but but just before you go on with this I don't know if you ever saw the movie called silver lining playbook it's a great movie it's a terrific movie but it is about the passion with which NFL supporters support their team so when people go out and burn their memorabilia this is like it's like me going out and burning pictures of my kids you know I mean like they they really love these teams so this is no small thing it's so beautiful because it turns out the people love their country more they don't like it when these criminals you know one NFL player is arrested on average once a week every 77 days really yeah every seven days and these are like you know they didn't pay a traffic ticket these are like rape murder you know it's very serious crime but which is no punishment whatsoever yeah these absolutely empty-headed people who make tens of millions of dollars a year to run around and make us giggle when those people criticize the country and spout off on things they know nothing about turns out the fans don't like it so Ronnie rebar the owner of a bar and grill who's a big Steelers fan he hosted a burning of his memorabilia and he posted it on Facebook he got hundreds of likes and shares Steelers fan Robert Smith got it posted a video of himself burning over $1000 of memorabilia two groups of Ravens fans posted videos burning merchandise a couple weeks ago New York Giants fan posted a video of himself burning season tickets his real future value is really making a statement Indiana and Indianapolis Colts fans same thing New Orleans Saints fans had a big Facebook video where they poured lighter fluid all over their jerseys and and flags well lit it all on fire 100 Patriots fans showed up to a guy's house in Massachusetts they weren't actually it's against the law to burn anything other than wood in Massachusetts so they just symbolically burned a few caps throughout the rest or donated it to charity did you see they showed up at a guy's house you mean a player selves edit no no no at a fan says so it hosted the gathering either included 100 people Wow and they burned all of it and then they sang the national anthem as it burned the thing I notice about this I mean there are people who are quitting their positions some guy left the Buffalo Bills after 30 years he was a staff member there he just thought it was disgusting what is interesting about all of this is sure the burning of the memorabilia the reaction but what they all have in common is they all post this on face yeah yeah they're all posting videos of this and it's because it the silent majority of Americans finally can break a media stranglehold we've been seeing this for two years we've seen this with the way that Donald Trump has interacted with the political establishment with the American people we're seeing that the mainstream media which now ESPN might as well be CNN or MSNBC they no longer tell us what reality is we we can see for ourselves that huh I'm not the only person who thinks that this is drivel and they now have their own new media platform the right-wing exuberance that we're seeing in culture and new media they're expressing that to the players have a right to express their opinion well now the fans have a right to express theirs and broadcast it to millions of people you know it's funny Bob Schieffer the veteran reporter I mean he must be almost the 80 at this point he has a new book out called overloaded about how we're getting too much information and he complaining he said you know yeah okay they can get the news on on social media but they don't have our standards and I think the thing is their standard it's pretty good compared to the media you know speaking of young folks using the using the media new social media I have to I have to say that you and I I think we finally have had a breakthrough on our our proposed podcast for my new novel another Kingdom we finally are getting the episodes together and we're hoping to launch this on October 13th well the devil does not want us to do this swear I swear no leave it has been it's been uncanny the way opposition has come it is bizarre parts of episodes disappearing sound not working people drop it I mean it has been really strange which is why we are we are going to do this look that's look it's a it's a great story but it's also by I mean it is evidence that conservatives get to use the new media to get stories at that would never be made but it's not even that it's a conservative story it's just that it's a story that doesn't tell political correctness you know I mean there I don't want to give away too much of the story I think people are gonna probably tune in we're gonna release on Friday the 13th but another Kingdom has a presents a transsexual killer you could never get that made in Hollywood not now and I have to say I mean it's not a comment on transsexualism it's not you know that's not what it's about it's just that's the character and it's a very and it's an old tough guy truck it's not you know it's not a political story but you know yesterday I went to see American assassin which is based on one of the late Vince Flynn's novels and Vince I know was a staunch pro-american conservative okay and it's it's I won't go into it it was the original novel took place in the past it was the backstory of his character mitch rap but they've updated it so it takes place in the president and one of the guy with the top screenwriting credit on it is a guy named Stephen Schiff and this is not to knock Stephen but he did one of the major drafts on the base that was based on my novel true crime which became a Clint Eastwood picture and Stephen and I went to lunch and he said to me listen true in centers around a white man on death row who may be there because of political correctness he may have been sentenced to death because nobody wanted to say that it was a black guy who did this thing all right Stephen sat there and said I cannot do that politically we're making him a black guy and they made the guy on death row in the movie a black guy which made a lot of the movie not make sense because the whole point of the movie was only a jerk like the reporter in the movie could see the truth because he wasn't constricted by this so Stephen is writing American assassin and sure enough it's a pro-american story it's got evil Islamists and at which I really appreciate it but it's got a lot of dialogue suggesting that the Iranian nuclear deal was a great thing and it's only the evil the moderates in Iran had supported but it's only the evil doers in Iran who are against is the the screenplay was written by Ben Rhodes or I don't want to speak for Vince Flynn the guy died way way too young it's not for me to say what he would have thought but I'm pretty sure that he was not sitting there going mmm that near a nuclear deal that was a good thing so the point is it's not that the story we're telling is a conservative story it's just the story we're telling we just don't think about political correctness I mean that's why I as well that's why the devil doesn't want us to make certainly but it's I do find it pretty funny that the blank book I think could destroyed it 90% of any shot I'll ever have in a Hollywood career and then the immediately the next thing we do is this which is like a sledge it's it's such a joy and that that is the way to put it there's nothing about this story where you would say oh yeah that's a trump voter who wrote you but you do get the sense that it was a conservative who wrote it because you read the story and you think oh yeah that's reality oh yeah that's a that's a reality it's sad the reality has become a conservative principle you know it's like do you think that we could actually agree on that all right that's coming out Friday the 13th of October another king 13 absolutely it's good to talk to you the Michael Noel's show comes up after you are gonna do a show today right I'm doing a show and then I am flying out to the UK and but we will also have one Columbus Day show oh good I'm gonna I'm gonna pre-record one because all of this anti Columbus Day stuff is driving me so crazy we can't let it go away without mentioning excellent excellent and I know Shapiro has got a the Jewish holiday so he's taking some time off so basically I am the daily why it's all yeah it's better than the alternative though because if you were the one on vacation we'd be plunged into a clav unless we can never survive alright the Michael no show will be on today after this good to see you those I'll talk to you later see it our crappy culture all right I want to go back to this idea of what the media and is doing to us and how we responded to the media with Donald Trump and how that gets some of us I think most of us into a bit of a bind I want to start the the poet WH Auden one of the last great poets I I've always thought he was a very good poet but he was actually borderline great Auden he wrote a famous poem on September called September 1st 1939 which is that's the day that Germany invaded Poland and World War 2 began and he's he was just so depressed I'm sure you all know it like the way I felt when I was reading about this Las Vegas shooting today let me just read you a little bit of it he starts out by saying I sit in one of the dives on 52nd Street uncertain and afraid as the clever hopes expire of a low dishonest decade waves of anger and fear circulate over the bright and darkened lands of the earth obsessing our private lives the unmentionable odor of death offends the September night that's a very famous line that it was a low dishonest decade and now he starts to talk about all the things that have unraveled and and war has come and he one of the final stanzas he says something that people like me I know feel all the time all people who care about what they're doing and are speaking and have an audience he says all I have is a voice to undo the folded lie all right and he goes on and on and he says he says there is no such thing as the state no one exists alone hunger allows no choice to the citizens or the police we must love one another or die and this is another of the most famous lines in the poem we must love one another or die and the story goes that Auden later wanted to change that line because people don't know this about poets but poets are usually the most realistic people in the world they want to describe everything very exactly and if you sometimes if you look at old-fashioned romantic poetry and then look up this the science of what they're describing they got it exactly right and all I didn't want is to change this line because he said it doesn't matter whether we love one another we die anyway but of course as so often with poets his muse was smarter than he was when he said we must love one another or die after the war Auden to his Catholic roots and became a believer again I believe I can't speak for his inner life but he did return to his Catholic roots and and I think that the the story of the Gospels tells the story of the Bible as read by Christians tells us that in fact we must love one another or die you know when when Adam and Eve we were in the garden God said to them don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or thou shalt surely die and the devil or the serpent came to Eve and said thou shalt not surely die he which is Charlton Heston used to read that line he used to say was one of his favorite lines in the Bible it was so insinuating that I'm not surely thy and and a lot of people say well Eve eats the apple and she doesn't die but in fact that's not the case in in the Gospels and the Gospel of John Jesus says this is eternal life that they that this is eternal life that they know you he's speaking to God that they know you the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent so in that sense so in that sense right in the sense that life true life eternal life is to know God when they disobeyed God when they turned away from God they did die they did surely die okay and so it is true that we must love one another die and I know how hard this gets as I said before the left has been hammering us now for 50 years and it's one thing from it is one thing for me you know I have a voice you know I can I can write things people read them I could say things people listen to them but but most of us in this country you know what Knowles was saying about Facebook is true social media has given us a voice but it's not like a voice of the media the mainstream media is like the German tanks you know it just rolls over everything it rolls over everything and you turn on the TV and the comedians are making fun of you you turn on the news and they are slanting the news away from your point of view you turn you turn on to watch them stupid award show all you want to do is see the women and their pretty dresses and you know the good-looking actors that's all you want to do and they stand up there with their statuettes that they're feeding to one another patting each other on the back their million-dollar you know high jinks and then looking in the camera and telling you you're an idiot you know and it's offensive and they don't understand how offensive it is and they don't understand that a lot of the reason that Donald Trump was elected president even though he's so rude and sometimes bullying is because he's so rude and sometimes bullying and it's that's the people talking back talking back to George Clooney talking back to Meryl Streep talking back to Stephen Colbert and all these people who spend every single day hammering the left you don't like it guys that's what it feels like that's what the Stephen Colbert show feels like to people on the right you don't like the Donald the stuff Donald Trump says well that's what it feels like and and you know if you wanted to see I just brought in a couple of incredible examples of the bubble people are looking at living in Bret Stevens who is a guy I don't always agree with but I respect him he's independent he's smart he's now works for the New York Times he's kind of was so it he hates Donald Trump so much that he was alienated from the Republican Party he wrote an article called the dying art of disagreement and it was on the Chuck Todd show and Chuck Todd says how long has this been going on and Brett Stevens talks about how we lost the part of disagreement in the last 20 years one of the things that has happened is that too easily we inhabit our kind of social media filter bubbles in which we only hear and have reflected the views that we agree with to begin with and the second thing is that too much of television has become a kind of Rage Factory for one side or the other when there's never any actual meeting of minds you simply caricature what the other side has to say or think you know unpatriotic liberals or Neanderthal conservatives and then you attack the straw man so I think a lot of I mean this has been going on for a long time I think one thing though is that it part of the problem is on campuses I don't think we are teaching students as well as we ought the arts of persuasion and of learning how to handle a contrary point of view okay so now Chuck Todd offers his theory I mean this is an amazing moment Chuck Todd now offers theory on how we lost the art of disagreement this is cut number eight well let me ask you this I think a lot of people would point to cable television as well talk radio as well I'll give you one example and and some may fire at me for this but I don't think it was healthy that we had a cable news channel run by a former political operative it's the problem it reject Todd and Chuck Todd's life is the cable news and talk radio all conservative and when he says a political operative running a cable news channel he's talking about Roger Ailes at Fox right that's who he's talking about a political operative George Stephanopoulos is the chief anchor on ABC News one of the biggest networks news networks in the country what is he talking about the kind of blindness you know I was talking about Bob Schieffer before you know that same thing that kind of blindness that there in this bubble the bubble is made of iron so what happens so we send Donald Trump and Donald Trump like he says stuff that drives me crazy sometimes he's so rude he's so bullying and all this stuff but I understand I do get it it is you know they're talking back to the people and Trump by the way loves a Trump it was said to tell his aides to say you know just tell him that crazy guy in the White House he's gonna do something really bad like he said he said Rex Tillerson is off negotiating with with the North Koreans and Trump says he's wasting his time yeah they're not gonna listen well Trump does this on purpose this is part of his negotiating technique and part of the reason the people who love him love him the problem is the problem is we have to fight back we have to strike back against this incredible incredible monolith of the news and the entertainment media and the academies we have to make our voices heard and Trump is one of the only ways we can do it but if everybody is stooping to everybody else's level we should just keep going down and down and down when do we stop hating one another the fact is I believe that 70% of this country could get in a room together and talk face-to-face and and start to make changes start to go forward here's the thing that is not going to happen on the news that is not going to be I love Glenn Beck he's a great guy he's a terrific commentator a brilliant man but it glenn back going to the new york times and talked to the new york times isn't gonna solve anything because not because of them not because back isn't a good guy but because the people who are opposed to one another look at that and think oh you know beck is selling us out or or the new york times why are they talking to him you know back just once the new york times are like whatever they say that the conversation is not going to be you are not going to be led back to a unified america i'm not gonna do it rush limbaugh is not gonna do it the new york times is not gonna do a chuck todd it's not gonna do it this is gonna happen this is on you it's on you guys it's gonna happen in your dorm rooms you know it's gonna happen in your dorm rooms when you don't tell the other guy to shut up or when you invite you don't you do invite him in to talk it's gonna happen in emails it's gonna happen in coffee shops it's going to happen in town halls and in churches where people who disagree speak to one another in a civilized way you know the other day I have a friend an email friend obiano Jew iki OCHA I just call her a Jew because I can that's her nickname and I cannot pronounce her name and she has written a wonderful book and I'll bring her on to talk about it book about what's happening in Africa and she's a cultural conservative than a Catholic a devout Catholic and I wanted to praise the book and put a blurb on the book cuz I think everybody should read it's called target Africa it doesn't come out yet but like I said will have her own when it does but but I wrote her a note saying you know I just want you to know I'm not as culturally conservative as you is I think the book is wonderful and here's the reason I think the book is wonderful but these are the places where I disagree and she wrote me back this wonderful note saying oh you know I listen to your show every day I know you don't agree with me on all this stuff that has nothing to do with it we have to have these discussions and all this stuff that is where this is gonna begin it is not going to be any couldn't be getting with wonderful people like uh drew you know who will talk to people who even when they disagree and it's not gonna happen it's not gonna be Trump it's not gonna be the news media we cannot sit around and wait for them we have to start talking to one another because this this moment has to pass it has to pass we have to get to a point where the gears of government can move we have to get to the point where we're not hating one another we have to get to the point where we can all agree that a guy who goes and opens fire on a concert is evil no matter what he thinks I don't care if he says he's anti I don't care if he says he's anti plaque I don't care if he says he's anti white I don't care if he says he's Pro Muslim he's evil and that once we can decide what the evil is and that you and I are not evil then you and I can start to talk to each other we will continue to talk to each other tomorrow I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show be here because this is all the Daily wire has left
