00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:05,489
Look at this note. It's from the Blue
Book Modeling Agency in 1945.

2
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:11,960
It says Norma Jean, who you might also know as Marilyn Monroe, was in fact, a size 12.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,800
LYNN BOORADY: She was.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,520
but back in the 50s, a size 12 was very thin.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,070
That was a model.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,490
You know, a size 12 then would be about a size 6 now.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:29,679
Well, to be exact, she would be a size 8 at
Topshop, 6 at Zara, and 4 to 6 at American Apparel.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,590
..to actually show you the inconsistencies,
I went shopping.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,050
I bought 3 jeans at 3 different stores, all
in the same size.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,780
We’re already off to a bad start.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,340
These all look different.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,740
This is not a 4.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,660
This one is the one in the middle.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,880
This one fits!

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,320
Hold up.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,880
It won’t zip.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,180
I give up.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,060
Let’s wind back a little bit.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,220
It was the Napoleonic wars and later
the Civil War in the US that demanded a sizing

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,960
system for the mass production of clothing for the first time.

21
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,800
It was for men’s uniforms.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,250
After that, men’s suit sizes were based
on the chest measurement and the rest was

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,270
calculated accordingly, assuming that their bodies were in proportion.

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,870
The demands for mass production of uniforms escalated and ready-made clothing became really popular.

25
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,060
By the end of the nineteenth century, most
people were wearing ready-made clothes.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,470
In 1939, the US government funded statisticians
to collect the weight and 58 measurements

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,360
of 15,000 women.

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,260
LYNN BOORADY: They only used white women, even
though they took measurements of women of

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,840
color, they didn’t include them in the study
or the calculations.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,120
The women who would’ve turned out for these studies were the poor women because they would be paid.

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:04,300
So the data set even back then was possibly malnourished women, certainly poor women, and not very

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,840
diverse group of women… and that’s what
we started with.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,750
They were looking for key measurements that
could predict the sizes of other parts of

34
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,220
the body, the way chest sizes had for men.

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,120
But women’s bodies, with variable breast
and hip sizes, were much harder to summarize with

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,190
a single number.

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:27,560
So, the data was used to create a
system in 1958 with sizes from 8 to 42,

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,670
an arbitrary number based on bust size, combined
with a letter for height and a plus or minus

39
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,670
for hips.

40
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,290
The sizing chart was really unpopular, so
they made some updates, but finally in 1983

41
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,650
it was completely withdrawn.

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,360
In the 1970s and 80s, companies started labeling

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,909
the sizes down, and adding lower numbers like
2, zero and now even double zero.

44
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:55,790
So the waist measurement that used to be a
size 12 became an 8.

45
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,560
LYNN BOORADY: Vanity sizing specifically, is when the size on the label is lowered artificially,

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,340
in order to tempt to get somebody to buy
the garment.

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,380
So you’re appealing to the person’s vanity.

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,540
Sizing has become a marketing tool.

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,200
LYNN BOORADY: I think it’s done because

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,780
the women are getting bigger,
we’re just addressing that.

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,280
When the first standardizing chart came out
in 1958 it was mostly built out of malnourished,

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,420
white women.

53
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,019
Now, that there’s such a wide group of people
to cover, the retailers are picking a certain

54
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,099
group of people to sell to, honing in what
works with that group and what doesn’t.

55
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,800
LYNN BOORADY: I think we’re more aiming for our own target markets.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,510
So, when Abercrombie & Fitch does their sizing,
they’re sizing to their target market not

57
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,510
to me.

58
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,210
We kept tweaking that information
until we sold more garments and could lower the return rate.

59
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,240
That means, even brands owned by the same company will have inconsistent sizes.

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,760
A size 8 at Banana Republic will have the
same hip size as a size 2 at the Gap.

61
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,300
So if you get frustrated while shopping….

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,299
LYNN BOORADY: It’s not you, it’s the industry, it’s not women’s bodies, we’re fine

63
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,419
the way we are.

64
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,700
They are just random numbers, they don’t
mean anything.

65
00:04:13,700 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you don’t like your size just cut
it out of your clothes.
