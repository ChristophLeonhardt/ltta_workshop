LET’S NOT FORGET. HE WAS PUT ON THE COURT OF APPEALS IS A BUSH NOMINEE. PANEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE GOT A GOOD EXCLUSIVE REACTION WE GOT A GOOD EXCLUSIVE REACTION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, MERCEDES SCHLAPP. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE FEELING AFTER THAT INTERVIEW WITH MARTHA MacCALLUM AND THE PROTESTERS DESCENDING, THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PRINTED T-SHIRTS ON, "BE A HERO" COME OUTSIDE OF SUSAN COLLINS OFFICE. I DON’T KNOW WHY THEY WERE ALLOWED TO HANG OUT IN THE CAPITAL, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT. HOW DOES WHITE HOUSE FEEL TONIGHT? WE ARE SO PROUD OF BRETT KAVANAUGH AND ASHLEY. THEY WENT OUT THERE TONIGHT, THEY SPOKE FROM THE HEART, AND THEY SENT A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE. BRETT SAID HE’S GOING TO FIGHT. HE’S GOING TO STAND STRONG. HE’S NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED HE’S NOT GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THOSE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE PLACING FALSE CLAIMS ON HIM. HE IS STRONG IN DEFENDING HIS CHARACTER AND HIS INTEGRITY, AND CHARACTER AND HIS INTEGRITY, AND I THINK THAT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR TONIGHT. AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR TONIGHT. THE PAIN THAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH, THE VILE THREATS IN OUR THROUGH, THE VILE THREATS IN OUR FAMILY, AND THE MERE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING POLITICS WITH THIS FAMILY, WITH THIS MAN’S LIFE, SOMEONE WHO HAS THIS MAN’S LIFE, SOMEONE WHO HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO PUBLIC SERVICE, LAURA, AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THESE DEMOCRATS, AND WHEN THEY SAY, THE VERDICT IS INCOME OF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS GUILTY, THEY BELIEVE HER, THEN WHY THE HECK ARE WE HAVING A HEARING IF THEY ARE BELIEVING HER AND NOT EVEN GIVING BRETT KAVANAUGH THE FAIR PROCESS THAT HE DESERVES, ESPECIALLY AFTER SIX WEEKS THAT THEY HAD THESE LENGTHY HEARINGS, THAT THEY’VE ASKED HIM TO OVER 1,000 QUESTIONS, AND YET THE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO TRY TO DESTROY BRETT KAVANAUGH’S REPUTATION. Laura: MERCEDES, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO JEFF FLAKE TONIGHT? WAY ALL MY SOURCES, IT’S NOT SO MUCH SUSAN COLLINS WHO IS WAVERING HERE. I THINK SHE HAS BEEN SOLIDIFIED IN HER VIEW IN FAIRNESS, GIVEN THE ACTIVISTS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED HERE AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST WEEK OF MY DELAYING MR. TRY TO GET WAIT FOR THIS REPORT TO COME OUT. WHAT’S THE MESSAGE FOR HIM TONIGHT GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN? TONIGHT GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN? I THINK THE METHOD FOR ALL THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS IS THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH STANDS READY TO TESTIFY. HE’S READY TO CLEAR HIS NAME. HE WAS READY TO DO THAT LAST WEEK. Laura: MERCEDES, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOU. I DON’T THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR I DON’T THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH TO GO UP THERE, AND THIS ATMOSPHERE, AND BE EXPECTED WE KNOW HE SAYS HE CATEGORICALLY DENIES THIS. HE HAD SAID THIS REPEATEDLY, AND HE HAD SAID THIS REPEATEDLY, AND LETTERS ENDED STATEMENTS TONIGHT. I THINK IT’S A MISTAKE TO KEEP GIVING INTO THESE TACTICS. THE TACTICS OF THE LEFT ARE COME THE TACTICS OF THE LEFT ARE COME ALIKE THIS IS LIKE POLITICAL TERRORISM, INTIMIDATION, EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL, EXTORTION, WE’VE ALL SEEN IT IN DIFFERENT FORMS IN OUR LIVES. THIS IS HIDEOUS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE RIGHT DOMINIC RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION, NOT COMING OUT OF YOU BUT COMING NOT COMING OUT OF YOU BUT COMING OUT OF SOME OF THE OTHER SENATORS ON CAPITOL HILL. THIS IS BEYOND THE PALE. USE OF THE MAJORITY LEADER STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARC STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARM STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARA STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARG STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEAR STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARY STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEART STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARE STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARD STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARM STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARC STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARA MITCH McCONNELL COME OUT STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEARS STRONG, TALKING ABOUT THE SMEAR DEMOCRATS. THERE WILL BE A VOTE. WE WILL MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. WE ALL AGREE IT’S TIME FOR A VOTE. THIS IS ALL THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DO TO BUY TIME. THEY WANT TO FIGURE OUT, WHAT OTHER STORY THEY CAN TRY TO FABRICATE BRAID Laura: THEY WILL COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE. EXACTLY. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IT’S NOT THE RIGHT VENUE FOR THIS. THE PROOF OF IT IS, THE SENATORS THE PROOF OF IT IS, THE SENATORS DON’T EVEN WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS. Laura: SIMONE SANDERS SPEAKING OF WHAT THE PUNDITS WERE SAYING, SHE WAS ON CNN TODAY ABOUT WITH THE MAJORITY LEADER SAID ABOUT THE SMEARS. SPEAK OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LEA SPEAK OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LEE LET’S WATCH. SPEAK OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LER SPEAK OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LER CALLING THIS A SMEAR CAMPAIGN IS A SMALL DOG WHISTLE TO THE BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MAY BE TRAUMA SPACE, TALKING ABOUT SUGGESTING HE DOESN’T BELIEVE THESE WOMEN. Laura: MERCEDES, "IS JUST ANOTHER DOG WHISTLE." IF YOU CALL SOMETHING A SMEAR, I IF YOU CALL SOMETHING A SMEAR, I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT’S ABOUT BUT DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT’S ABOUT BUT THAT IS WHERE THE POND AND CLASSES GOING. FINAL THOUGHTS. THERE IS NO QUESTION. I THINK WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS ASKING FOR IS A FAIR PROCESS. HE HAS SPENT TIME TALKING TO THE HE HAS SPENT TIME TALKING TO THE SENATORS, BASICALLY MAKING HIS CASE AS TO WHY HE IS THE MOST QUALIFIED JUDGE TO BE IN THE SUPREME COURT. NT DESERVES HIS TIME, HE DESERVES THAT VOTE Laura: HE ALREADY HAD HIS TIME. MERCEDES, I THINK THEY SHOULD NEVER IT’S TOO LATE NOW BUT THE PROCESS WAS FAIR AND THEY REOPENED THE PROCESS. KEN STARR SAID THEY NEVER SHOULD KEN STARR SAID THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT. I’M GOING TO KEEP CITING CAN’T START BECAUSE HE SAID THERE IS A START BECAUSE HE SAID THERE IS A AGO ON RADIO AND TV WITH ME HE WAS SO RIGHT. GRASSLEY AND FLAKE AND ALL THOSE GRASSLEY AND FLAKE AND ALL THOSE GUYS GRASSLEY IS TRYING TO DO GUYS GRASSLEY IS TRYING TO DO HIS BEST. JEFF FLAKE, YOU NOW SEE WITH GOING ON HERE. JEFF FLAKE HAS GOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND ALL THE OTHER SENATORS.
