♪ ♪ Bret: TONIGHT, HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE DEALING WITH MORE INTERNAL STRUGGLES OVER IMMIGRATION, A FARM BILL, AND A LAME DUCK SPEAKER WITH RAPIDLY DIMINISHING INFLUENCE. ALL OF THIS COMES AT A PIVOTAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. PETER DOOCY SETS THE TABLE FOR US TONIGHT FROM CAPITOL HILL. THIS SPEAKER KEEPS GETTING TURNED DOWN BY MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY. THIS YEAR WILL BE MY LAST ONE. RETIRING HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN COULD BE SQUEEZED OUT THE SUMMER BY HIS HANDPICKED SUCCESSOR, MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY.
