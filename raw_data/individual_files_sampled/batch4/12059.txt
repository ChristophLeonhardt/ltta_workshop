people on the left and even some on the right are going after Donald Trump for going after football players who disrespect the flag I am going to tell you why Trump has got this one 100% right plus is the Pope Catholic some conservatives actually don't think so father Michael all Knowles who you remember from his role in going my way will be here to discuss at all and do you remember when Berkeley was the home of the free-speech movement well neither do they will talk about what went wrong but first NFL football which used to be the most popular sport in America way back oh about 20 minutes ago is suddenly playing to half filled stadiums and getting much lower ratings on TV I wonder could it be because some of us don't want to watch a group of muscle-bound multimillionaires exercise their right to disrespect a flag for which many of their fellow Americans died so that millionaires would have the right to disrespect the flag for which many of their fellow Americans died now that can't be it maybe people are just busy doing something more important on Sundays like picking the dirt out from between their toes and then shaping it into tiny animal sculptures and what about the recent Emmy Awards another gathering of wealthy people only here they get together and give each other statuettes for playing let's pretend then they stand at a podium and send a message to half of America that translates roughly do we hate you you stink get stuffed now for some reason a lot of people don't want to watch this show either I know it's a head scratcher it's almost as if a lot of people would rather not listen to the half informed political monitoring's of a group of thrice divorced genetic jackpots many of whom measure the depth of their wisdom by how many times they've been in rehab and what about our academies college attendance has dropped every year since 2010 and some colleges where raucous left-wing demonstrations have taken place have seen their in tendance fall as much as 35% oh it's almost as if people don't want to spend their life savings and go into debt in order to have their children turned into raving lunatics who think they're oppressed because they have to go wee-wee in pee pee in the wee wee room or vice versa now I don't know about you but I'm beginning to notice a pattern here in sports in showbiz and in the Academy leftists have scored tremendous victories infiltrating once beloved institutions and transforming them into mega phones for their cramped and censorious ideologies and in the aftermath of those victories these once titanic institutions are shrinking and shrinking until soon the only person watching Stephen Colbert will be Colin Kaepernick it's almost as if Americans have better things to do than to watch the most privileged people on earth indulging in champagne socialism and Limousine radicalism while disrespecting the hard-working people who make their shabby little lives possible better things to do like braiding their nose hairs or being free trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show see Topsy no Elizabeth easing its all right this NFL thing has got me so worked up I think I need to come to I need some single nostril breathing in but you know you do hold and you breathe through one and you hold it and then you exhale through the other and you keep going I feel so much better now all right we're gonna discuss this NFL thing I'm going to explain to you point by point why Donald Trump is a hundred percent right about this no matter what anybody says and we have father Michael Knowles will be here how many people know that he's an actual you know I hate pretty stuff it was a good one but I'm gonna leave it leave it go uh no he actually is a practicing Catholic and he's gonna practice until he gets it right Wow meanwhile you know you may save yourself where you know where were you during the Cleveland last weekend while one of our beloved institutions the NFL

stalk about the NFL we just have to take a brief this was breaking news as I was coming in Anthony Weiner got sentenced you know I was thinking is a hard time to be Anthony Weiner because he's gonna be doing hard time history ex-congressman broke down crying as he was sentenced I know I know Anthony that's sad he was sentenced to 21 months in prison that's nearly two years for convincing a high school student to undress and touch herself by a Skype in 2016 she told him in the phone call that she was 50 no I know you know the guy must be the compulsion in him must be so bad he must have wanted to get caught at some level because he's doing it again and again somewhere Andrew Breitbart is probably laughing uproariously after the courtroom cleared the one-time mayoral hopeful sat crying silently in his chair alongside his tearful mother I mean the one thing they taking his homes with is that at least he got to read Hillary Clinton's emails Abbadon was copying classified emails into anthony Weiner's computer oh man what a what a crew what a crew all right you know over over the weekend I had a chance to look at some of the comments not just on this show but also on my blog over at PJ Media and it's hilarious I get called everything I get called a trump bot I get called an anti-trump person I get called a secret liberal I get called a right-wing white supremacist and sometimes within ten comments within ten comments I will be called on every side and I thought like what what on earth you know like how are they all reading then listening to the same thing somebody called me an establishment Republican I felt like yeah that's that's me alright on the but you know what it is he said I do not think they know the sound of realism anymore I don't think they think they understand what it is to play politics as if politics were a process with a goal it's not an expression of your morality you know your morality forms your principles forms your political principles but politics is the means by which you get to where you want to go and you have to be realistic and rev√© the field you can't always get a hundred percent wins all the time and there's sometimes settling for what you can get is okay sometimes it's not sometimes you got to stand on principle so that is why that's why I wanted to say this first so that when I tell you that I think president Trump is 100% right about the NFL there's a reason I say it there's a reason I say it and I will explain it all so first of all starts out Friday I guess it was he's an Alabama he's backing this guy Luther strange was kind of the establishment you know there's a pro Trump candidate running against Luther strange but Trump doesn't care he's backing Luther strange and he says you know Luther strain shares our values believes in the flag and then he interrupts himself and and says this there's a couple one wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a chop the field right now out he's fired fired you know some owners gonna do that he's gonna say that guy that this respects our flag he's fired and that owner they don't know it they don't know if their friends are mine many of them they don't know they'll be the most popular person for a week they'll be the most popular person in this country because that's a total disrespect of our heritage that's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for okay everything that we stand and I know we have freedoms and we have freedom of choice and many many different freedoms but you know what it's still totally disrespectful okay so now the NFL goes nuts right first Roger Goodall the Commissioner he responds he puts out a statement he says the NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country in our culture divisive comments like these the president's comments demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL our great game and all of our players and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities and there are many many NFL players who do a lot of good things but when he says we help create a sense of unity in our country remember it's not Trump we started doing this it's the players of Colin Kaepernick and then a couple other players so then all the players get together and where before it was just a few players who were kneeling basically in a black lives matter protest against you know against police what they consider police brutality they were kneeling during the national anthem now they a lot of them do it and the Pittsburgh Steelers in one of the to me like maybe I'm the only person seeing this but I thought what are the great miscalculations right there is soldiers field Soldier Field in Chicago the plan the Bears and the entire Steelers team stays in the locker room during the national anthem right one of them comes out Alejandro Villanova who is one of is that how you pronounce it fluent Villeneuve of Villanueva sorry Alejandro Villanueva comes out and he's an offensive lineman who is one of three I believe veterans in the NFL and he's an Army Ranger I think he did three tours overseas and he comes out and he stands and does the now to me to me maybe I'm all fashion to me that makes the rest of the team look like trash they look like garbage here's the guy who served here's the guy who did it you go out with that guy and the coach of the team is saying well we wanted more unity we wanted more unity you know what oh you look bad you look bad and just so you know just so you know it's against the rules the rules of the of the NFL page a 6263 of the league's game operations manual this is what it says the national anthem must be played prior to every NFL game and all players must be on the sidelines for the national anthem these are the rules that you sign up for when you sign a contract during the national anthem players on the field and bench area should stand at attention face the flag hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking the home team should ensure that the American flag is in good condition it should be pointed out to players and coaches that we continue to be judged by the public in this area of respect for the flag and our country failure to be on the field by the start of the national anthem may result in discipline such as fines suspensions and/or the forfeiture of draft choices for violations of for violations of the above including first offenses okay so that's those are the rules right those are the rules and John Nolte points out that the NFL has no problem shutting down free speech okay John Nolte says he points out it says the NFL threatened finds in September of 2016 three NFL players plan to wear cleats in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks on America the NFL put a stop to it with threats of fines in July 2016 in honor of five police officers murdered in cold blood by a black lives matter activists the Dallas Cowboys wanted to honor the slain officers with a small helmet decal the NFL put a stop to that NFL find players in 2015 they fought they find William gay for wearing purple cleats meant to raise awareness for domestic abuse and of course the NFL doesn't want to raise too much of awareness for domestic abuse because they'll start to notice that a lot of NL players are domestically abusing their wad so the NFL players are going nuts and they attack Trump and the big thing is oh heas divisive he's politicizing everything Tom Brady who is a pal of trumps and a friend of his own oven voted for him he can't set this on radio I mean I certainly disagree with you know what he said and and you know I thought it was divisive and and you know like I said it's you know I just want to support my teammates and now I always have I'm never one that says oh that's wrong or that's right or that's but I do believe in what I believe in and I believe I'm bringing people together and respect and love and trust and and you know those are the values that my parents instilled to me and that's how I try to live every day so you know Brady obviously he's in there with these other players he's the leader of the team he can't you know go against his team but when he says I'm not one of the people to say this is right or this is wrong I am you know I do think that something that all of us have to actually do is determine right and wrong ratings the audience went away ratings dropped and that this is a this is from an article posted on Drudge on a day full of criticisms from Donald Trump political protests linked arms players taking a knee or not coming on the field during the national anthem and renewed pleas for unity from the league NBC and the NFL took a hit last night on Sunday Night Football in a metered market numbers the primetime matchup between the Redskins and the Oakland Raiders was the worst Sunday night football has performed this season so far an 8 percent dip from the early numbers and Trump is calling for a boycott he's saying boycott the NFL and this will change in a big hurry all right I'm gonna get to why I agree with Trump in just a minute but first if you are a small business you know if you're in a big business and you have to go and travel there's usually a department that handles travel and they handle everything you need if there's probably somebody you got to contact 24 hours a day if you run a small business you don't do that you may be doing it yourself and you know that you're gonna suffer wins and losses you know maybe you get a hotel room that's in a quiet quiet place and that's a good thing but maybe you don't have Wi-Fi that you need and that's a bad thing but if you buy your business trip at upside calm it's a triple win it's not just a win it's not a win win it's a win win win number one win upside has the absolute best available prices for flights hotel and rental cars when number two upside will reward you with a gift card to places like amazon.com every time you buy a business trip the kind of thing you get if you are part of a big corporation but you don't get if you're a little guy so you use upside comm and you will get a gift card to place like Amazon every time you do buy a business trip number three the amazing six star treatment you will get from up sized customer service special specialists who are called navigators like for instance one recent upside customer had a flight delayed for two hours so a navigator arranged for him to have complimentary access to the airline's executive lounge to pass the time which is great by the way I get into those things a lot and they're just terrific that's one example the navigators are accessible 24/7 by voice chat email or message so it's just like having your own department on the up side app I will start I personally will start your up side six star treatment right now you go to up side comm use my code Andrew and you'll get a minimum hundred dollar gift card to amazon.com you can send me a book by way of thanks that's code Andrew for a minimal hundred dollar gift card to amazon.com when you buy your next business trip at upside comm upside comm you deserve a better business trip there's a minimum purchase required and you have to see the site for complete details but it's a good way to make up for the fact that you're a small business and on a major corporation alright first this is not a free speech issue do not listen to any of the free speech thing as I said before the NFL is perfectly happy to find people and stop them from exercising their free speech we all agree that they have a right to do this we all agree that the these millionaire athletes have a right to disrespect the flag you know that that's not the point the point is if you're gonna go into the end zone and dance around like a little girl for five minutes and we're supposed to think you're so great even though you didn't do something like for instance go to Afghanistan and fight for our freedoms or go to Iraq and fight for our freedoms or run into a collapsing building to save people all you did was carry a ball across the line and now we have to watch you dance around you have the right to disrespect the flag but you might consider what you look like you look like a jerk okay that is the first thing plus I will not I will not be lectured to by the left on free speech the left who shuts down free speech these cuddlers of an tyfa these people who think that hate speech isn't protected by the First Amendment these guys who go after and Sue and fine a baker because his religious beliefs will not let him cater a gay wedding even though he'll serve gay people he can't cater a gay wedding because it's against his religious beliefs they'll go after him I will not listen to the left on free speech they have nothing to say but that we all agree they have the right ii this thing about the visib nests as it has actually pronounced I believe divisive miss total garbage okay it's divisive when you disrespect the flag the NFL started this it was divisive right away their ratings are already down the polls show that they're down in large measure because of the disrespect for the flag so it has nothing you know it has nothing to do with Donald Trump being divisive he's just calling them out he's calling them out on what they're doing divisive this only becomes a problem when the right does it it only you know we had Barack Obama in office eight years tore this country apart made us all hate each other made race relations worse all that stuff divisive miss was never a problem now suddenly it's a problem bite it it's just ridiculous third and this is the one you sometimes get from high-minded people they say well you know the flag is just a piece of cloth and kneeling is not disrespecting it it's not like turning your back on the flag it's not like all baloney all baloney the flag is a symbol of the country the flag represents the country it is symbols are important in human life we're all just human beings we are not like floating minds in a test tube we're human beings with hearts and souls when we see the flag it represents our country you stand for the flag that is what you do okay now here are three reasons why you don't respect the flag no matter what you believe okay because I understand you know I disagree with the black lives matter people I think the cops do a pretty good job even in their neighborhoods but I'm not there and I understand that the experience of being a black guy in these neighborhoods dealing with the cops is different than experience being a white guy like me driving around I get stopped by a cop he's like hello sir I say yes officer I give him my license he gives me slaps over the $500 ticket or whatever it is in LA now I understand that this is a different experience and I understand the emotions I disagree with them politically it's not a disagreement of hate or wanting to see their you know them be abused it has nothing do with that but but three reasons you don't respect this respect the flag but you will have the right to protest because you live in this country because people died for that right and are dying now and die every day and fight for your right to do that and the flag represents your right to do it so when you are exercising that right you don't exercise it against the flag it makes no sense you exercise within the context of the flag you salute the flag because you have the right to make the protest that you want to make secondly the very thing that you're demanding is an American value you are demanding equal justice under the law you are demanding to be treated by the police as if you were the important person in an exchange with the police which you are it is not the cop who's important it's you who's important and your rights are important you know whether even even when you're guilty your rights are important the justice you're demanding is represented by that flag so when you disrespect the flag you're actually sending this incredible mixed message the American justice system that you want is represented by the flag you know it's it's like Martin Luther King had this said the smartest thing about this he said he called on America to live up to the meaning of its Creed okay what to call on an America to be more American is an American thing to do when the left says it's patriotic to protest I don't believe it's patriotic necessarily but it is American to protests that we've been protesting from the very beginning the flag represents that in three the only reason we give a crap about you at all is because you're an American because you live with us under that flag it's not because Oh black people were held slaves you weren't there that didn't happen I didn't do it I got no interest in that it's not because I agree with you I don't agree with you it is not because you're some multi-millionaire who throws a ball around work 16 days a week a year all right that's a little unfair but still you know it's still you know you're one of the privileged people in the world it is not because I care about you because you are my fellow American because we are both protected by that flag and by this country and so when you disrespect that you disrespect me you disrespect my concern for you you disrespect the reason the only reason I care about who you are and it is just absolutely insulting this apps insulting now let's talk about Donald Trump for a minute I'm gonna stay on just to get through this and then we'll go over to go to Knowles but you won't be able to see Knowles unless you come on over to the Daily wire calm because we'll have to leave Facebook and YouTube but if you subscribe you could just watch the whole thing if use my cell allows you 10 bucks a month and for a year it's a hundred bucks a month and you get the leftist tears tumblr but let me just finish this thought all right Donald Trump Donald Trump pulls the same trick on these clowns every single time I keep hearing how stupid he is how ignorant earning is it pulls the same trick they keep falling for it me think maybe it's them who be stupid okay because what he does is he takes something that most normal everyday Americans agree with okay I think the I think the number is 72% of people believe that you shouldn't you should stand during the national anthem 72% of Americans disagree you know you can't get 72 percent of Americans to agree about anything sugar is sweet maybe you'll get like 68 percent but 72 percent so he takes an issue where he knows he's safest not just with his base but all with most normal human beings and then he expresses it in this kind of grotesque over-the-top wedding so it's like instead of saying you know well I have faith in God he'll say I have faith in God anybody who doesn't have faith in God is an idiot you know it says they gotta go out and say you're fired they honest I tell that sob this and that so he get so people instantly reacting instantly seized up and immediately he has his opponents opposing the flag he these clowns the Democrats sitting around going now they're yeah let's disrespect the fly I mean the other day he goes into the UN and he delivers that speech against North Korea and Kim Jong un and they were left as commentators Chelsea Handler she's saying I'd rather have kim jeong-hoon is my president yeah like yeah so now nothing she says means anything ever again so it's a brilliant it's a brilliant political tactic I don't see why he shouldn't use brilliant political tactics Obama trolled us for eight years you know Trump is trolling us back so now this is what comes from the right okay and I and I sympathize with this people say oh everything is political the wall street journal' have this tutorial today Oh everything is political can't we just have our sports can't we just have our showbiz why is everything political Donald Trump is making everything political nonsense Donald Trump did not make everything political everything is political because the left took over our communications industry and our and our news industry that's why everything is political every for for 10 years 15 years I've been going to conservative conferences to Cruz's conservative cruising abusing take back the culture take back the culture this is how you take back the culture and people say well the president shouldn't do it because he represents all of us but that's garbage every Hollywood actor attacks us every mainstream news show attacks us every late-night comic who's gonna speak for us who has a voice loud enough to speak for us except for the president he is in the right on this he did the right thing he is taking back the culture American culture is not opera American culture is reality TV and football and all the you know movies and all this stuff and the only person who has a voice loud enough to counter the steady stream of leftist garbage that we get buried under every day is Donald Trump and he's doing it and you know what I'm for it I'm for it do it you know these guys these privileged guys dancing in the end zones that their own achievements they should salute the damn flag I love the NFL I love football I will stop watching it if they keep doing this I will stop it will not kill me to stop I'll watch college football if they do it I'll stop watching that I'll just do crossword puzzles all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube subscribe and you can watch the whole thing on The Daily wire com subscribe for a year you get the leftist tears tumblr plus you can be in the mailbag and the mailbag just you know just my answering the questions in the mailbag actually makes the leftist to your tumblers fill up with leftist tears we got Michael Knowles coming up right now all right Knowle said we got you hey hey yeah all right so the you know it used to be an old joke is the Pope Catholic you know that was like this whole joke but no yeah now you you are father Michael moles right you were you you were a priest before the I think the scandal right isn't that father plays dominoes better than your father plays dominoes I believe that's how the latter speak you speak the ancient tongue of your kind so you know a lot of conservatives have been worried about this Pope I mean the Pope says stuff and you know conservatives sit and listen to it and say well wait a minute that's not Catholic doctrine as I know it but now there are actual conservative theologians who are attacking them is that have I got the story right well you know we do live in a time that has transcended parity so the question is the Pope Catholic is now no longer a joke it's actually a question raised by dozens of Catholic theologians and priests so these this group of priests and one bishop though it's important to note the bishop in question here is the Bishop of the Society of st. Pius the tenth this society broke away and was excommunicated by the Vatican thirty years ago it was recently brought back into communion with the Vatican by Pope Benedict they are a little more old-school a little more conservative they prefer the Latin Mass as I do they prefer the traditional liturgy as I do the Pope Benedict began a reform of the reform a kind of reform to the Vatican two changes that gave us all of those god-awful acoustic guitars and so but the only the only bishop that signed on to this was the Bishop of sspx which has no standing in Rome the rest though were priests and theologians and academics and they formally accused to the Pope of heresy the reason that they've accused him of heresy is that in particular his apostolic exhortation Amore's leticia the joy of love seemed by many interpreters to have opened the door for civilly divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to have communion and to loosen the rules about alternative living situations such as cohabitation and all the stuff that Catholics do but to say that they don't do it in the United States okay now now a lot of a lot of non Catholics believe that the Pope when that when the when the Catholic Church says the Pope is infallible that every word out of his mouth is infallible but that's not right right it's so the uses yeah not at all like many things in the Catholic Church it's you can't really understand it and I don't mean that flippantly the the I think one of the good arguments for the catholicity of the church is that nobody really gets the thing it isn't a man-made ideology so when people try to pin it down it eludes being pinned down okay this letter is worth reading it's 25 page letter and it quotes the first Vatican Council which defined papal infallibility and this what it said the Holy Spirit was not promised to the successors of Peter that they might by his revelation make known some new doctrine but that by his assistants they might religiously guard and faithfully expand the revelation or deposit of faith transmitted by the Apostles so papal infallibility has only been invoked a handful of times in history when the Pope is speaking ex cathedra to defend religiously is some doctrine that's been around forever it is not invoked when the Pope decides that he fancies one thing or the other that doesn't count okay so they're not attacking him on any in any place where he's infallible they're not actually attacking the doctrine of it it's amazing to read this I think people conservatives even American conservatives and certainly non Catholics really should read the tone of this because it's called a filial correction it's a correction as a son writes to his father it's deeply respectful it's in its a real turn it's a real impressive act to formally accuse somebody of heresy while still being quite respect but the piece says we you're still the Pope we believed that you were the Pope we believe that you're infallible on matters in which you're infallible but you're miss guiding a lot of people and what this is really about this is a small group of Catholic theologians it won't make a blip but what they refer to here are much more prominent theologians and Archbishop's Cardinals bishops who have sent in letters to the Pope called Dubya saying you know this was a little unclear Papa Francesco maybe you ought to clear up what you think about this that or the other thing he has not responded to those things so does the Pope have the power to declare that for instance you know cohabitate cohabitating living together outside of marriage is now okay does give the power to just change that rule the short answer is no okay it could be left to theologians to debate whether infallibility could be invoked in some way but the short answer is absolutely not it would be a very hard case to make the Pope can't all of a sudden decide that gay marriage is protected by the church or expanded upon by Christ or that abortion is just fine all of these things that I think the left to read Huffington Post headlines believe that is just around the corner for Pope Francis right now one of the other really interesting aspects of this filial corrective is that it comes in the five hundredth anniversary of Martin Luther and half of the letter takes issue with Pope Francis's quote unprecedented sympathy for Martin Luther and in particular on the sacraments Martin Luther did not have much care for the sacraments particularly the sacrum of marriage he said that the sacrament of marriage was simply there to quench the fire of concupiscence and he was reading st. Paul as he said that that has never been the position of the Catholic Church and the fear among conservative theologians and conservative Catholics is that the Pope is taking a Lutheran view while he's allowing Lutheran's to accept the Eucharist at Catholic masses he's saying very nice things in their churches and about Martin Luther and they're worried that the sacrament is being watered down and that the that rocksteady incredible immovable authority of the church will be watered down eroded and left to become some liberal squishiness like all the mainstream protestant churches well here's the weird thing that's a non Catholic the weird thing this to me is that I'm watching here in the States they're the left has been hammering can't a judge you know candidates for judgeships the Trump is appointed because they're Catholic basically saying you know just the very fact that you're Catholic is disqualifying which is unconstitutional but they're saying that just the very fact that you're Catholic disqualifies you for being a judge does that phase that fair yeah I I actually pulled this clip this reminds me of Chesterton who said that the reason he knew the Catholic Church was legitimate is that it gets attacked for opposite reasons oh it's too far left it's too far right do we have this clip of Senator Dianne Feinstein why is it that so many of us on this side have this very uncomfortable feeling that you know Dogma and law are two different things and I think whatever a religion is it has its own dogma the law is totally different and I think in in your case professor when you read your speeches the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you and that's of concern does the dogma live loudly within you it's the Curious Incident of the dog m''e and the nighttime is there like they expect it not to bark but amazing an amazing religious test by absolutely empty-headed Senator Dianne Feinstein believe it but but it does raise this question okay because a lot of the conservative judges maybe on all of them but a lot of the conservative judges justices on the Supreme Court are in fact Catholic that's right it was formally Scalia and then Alito right now missus Catholic I believe Roberts is Catholic and then some are nominally Catholic but or not so in a recognizable West so we on the right thing tend to look a little bit to the Catholic Church to be a stalwart voice for a lot of kinds of conservatism not all kinds of conservatism as economic Pope has never been any good on economics they don't know anything about economics but but on kind of social conservative conservatism the right kind of looks to the Catholic Church is that fair I mean where does this a Venn diagram of Catholicism and conservatives and where does it intersect absolutely and I do think pope john paul ii was in his own time quite good on economic matters only and so much is he opposed constant but it is true that the church you know that it isn't a one-to-one it isn't a perfect overlap right but i don't think it's any coincidence that the founder of the modern american conservative movement William F Buckley Jr was a Catholic and he was he was a he was a Shiite Catholic you know he was yeah devoutly Catholic he was Catholic before he was a conservative even and his priest in New York pointed out that because Buckley's Catholicism informed his conservatism it kept his from his conservatism from being narrow or nostalgic it kept it from the shallowness that we see in various forms of libertarianism were fiscal conservatism and social liberalism and yadda-yadda-yadda and it was the the French writer Hilaire Belloc said a man who does not accept the Catholic faith writes himself down as suburban that is when a Frenchman calls you suburban man that's just cruel yeah it's pretty brutal yeah I think that's why American conservatives look toward and admire the Catholic Church because of that because it has a depth of conservatism that isn't simply captured by free markets and guns and capitalism and things like that and and and I think that's rightly why the left in America fears it so one one last question and then I will let you go to prepare your show because the Michael mole show comes on after this and I know you actually do an occasional bit of work I do about seven or eight minutes ago yeah as as a Catholic and a conservative when you look at this Pope who has given you know people like me he kind of gives me a headache I mean time he opens his mouth I think like you know part part of it is the whole South American thing they've never experienced real capitalism they've never experienced honest capitalism so they have perfectly good reasons to hate it but but I look at him and he gives me kind of a headache what is your experience of this boat you know we've just had two of the greatest men in the history of the church serve his Pope's negatively thank you we had st. John Paul the second and Pope emeritus Benedict to men who worked together in the same rooms by sheer Providence so by that standard if he falls a little short I can understand it on some issues he's quite good and those issues are not and I'm speaking politically because he makes political statements sometimes he's quite good on matters of social conservatism and on some matters he can be completely out of left field on matters of environmental regulation right or on matters of economics but a priest once told me that the good Lord sometimes sends us bad Pope's to remind us that the Pope is fallible except when he's infallible and the nice thing is if this were some Protestant sect or some denomination that doesn't have the weight of history and the weight of glory behind it then it could turn the whole thing right off the rails and certainly the Catholic Church has been pulled off the rails before by some of the craziness surrounding Vatican 2 which Benedict said was downright Pelagian it can be pulled off but because it has the weight of two millennia and because Catholics believe it was instituted by Christ on earth then you know we believe it has this spiritual steadiness to it then the it's much harder to move the bark of Peter and we can survive even the hypothetical not very good Pope right the semi infallible a father Michael no there will be no Michael no show after this great to see why I will say just as a filial corrective to you drew yeah I am infallible on all matters that are not spiritual cigars I'll give you cigars you're infallible let's see you later thanks Michael all right if that weren't low enough talking to Michael Knowles's and crappy enough here's our crappie culture so we have to talk about the fact that the week of free speech week in Berkeley was canceled it was canceled by the student group sponsoring the event this was you know Milo you nah police was gonna go and speak and I think Ann Coulter was gonna be there and a couple of other right Winx speakers Milo went to the quad I think where that you know that quad is their free speech area it's kind of like that place in England they have a park where if you stand on a soapbox you can't be arrested no matter what you say because you're not standing on English soil it's it's true you know then you go there and there's always some crazy guy standing on a soapbox declaiming but they cancelled this and of course you know we've all talked about the irony of the fact that the free speech movement started in Berkeley and now you know the the administration says a spokesman for the university says claims that this cancellation is somehow the outcome desired by the campus or without basis in fact the university was prepared to do whatever was necessary to support the First Amendment rights of the student organization but as we know from Ben Shapiro's recent appearance they're just having him go there cost thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars it had we needed an infrastructure of young America the young America Foundation had to provide this tremendous infrastructure security all kinds of you know coordination with the police it shouldn't take that for somebody like Shapiro who is basically your you know conservative in the great American tradition it should not take that kind of effort for this to happen even though Milo is a provocateur and definitely and as a prophetess in some way that you know they shouldn't need that kind of structure to surround them and when you say that the university is not to blame the New York Times a former newspaper had a an article called let right-wing speakers come to Berkeley the faculty is design is divided says students looking to the faculty and administration for guidance on how to interpret the free speech issue are seeing deep divisions among their leaders at Berkeley there are both unequivocal voices championing the importance of free speech no matter how inflammatory and professors who say lines need to be drawn on campuses so you know the one that one person who was stood up by the way is is Carol Crist who is the who was now the Chancellor the university's nor Chancellor I took an English class from Carol Crist when I was at Berkeley and and she was she was very good but she was still she was very young and just kind of still being formed and all this stuff and and I think that it's it's just interesting that she's gone on to become a fairly stalwart defender of free speech you know a lot of this has to do with there was a piece by Jeanne twins who I think is gonna come on the show soon who writes about generational differences and she says members of i gen the ipod ipad generation have spent more time with screens and less time interacting with each other than any previous generation and because they communicate primarily online most of the threats they experience come through social media or text and not in person for ijen danger tends to take the form of words not physical altercations so these people think they are in danger when people are speaking to them and i obviously think that a lot of this is not it's not just the iPhones and the social media it is also these professors who have been preaching professors and the news media who've been preaching all this time that there's their opinion their left-wing opinions and there's hate right there's no other way there's not it's not oh you wanted you want good for the black community through leftist means oh you want black good for the black community through right-wing means let's see which one is actually good for the black community for this you know neighborhood you know there's nothing like that on the news there's nothing like that on CNN nothing like that on the network something like that in the New York Times nothing like that in the Academy it's all their way and hate and the left has also done this important thing blurred the line between process and content okay because you have the right doesn't make it right this is what we're talking about with the NFL you know something is you have the right to do things that are wrong that is the way rights work so for instance and the way things are done the way things are done is the way your freedom is preserved the way things are done this way your freedom is preserved so it is processed to allow free speech but that doesn't mean you can't criticize the content of the speech and the left constantly blurs these things they say well gay marriage is right and therefore it's good that the Supreme Court decided that gay marriage should be legal everywhere but it's bad no matter what you think of gay marriage it is bad that the Supreme Court stripped the states of their rights to do this there's nowhere in the Constitution that says the federal government has the right to say anything about marriage like this so it is bad when you lose the process when you lose the process when the process is eroded your freedom is eroded that doesn't mean you can't debate the content and they're constantly confusing this and they do it on purpose they say well what do you mean the NFL like football players can't disrespect the flag they have a right to do it we know that we're debating whether it's right or wrong and we also have the right to boycott and we should debate whether that is right or wrong and this is the thing that the left has done because this is why the left no longer understands free speech because they have they are so convinced of the justness of their cause the Justice of their cause that they have decided that process doesn't matter but process is all because process is what defends your freedoms and that's the way we hope we can get to the good the good content you know tomorrow christian todo are our conservative movie critic is going to be any is just put out an article which features me I think me and Ben are both in it about whether you should boycott movies so we're gonna be talking about that be here the clayvin filled week has just begun enjoy it why you got it I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we will talk to you again tomorrow
