STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.
NEARLY 800 GERSTS ARE EXPECTED
TO ATTEND THE OPENING CEREMONY
WHEN THE U.S. EMBASSY IS MOVING
FROM TEL AVIV TO VERSACE
TOMORROW.
JOINING US AGAIN FROM JERUSALEM
LIVE, PASTOR AT THE FIRST
BAPTIST CHURCH IN DALLAS, TEXAS
AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ROBERT
JEFFRESS GIVING THE OPENING
PRAYER TOMORROW.
I'D LOVE TO YOU TALK US THROUGH
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TOMORROW, WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING
TO SAY?
HOW'S IT GOING TO SHAPE UP?
REPORTER: IN MY PRAYER, STEVE,
I'M GOING TO THANK GOD FOR HIS
FAITHFULNESS TO ISRAEL.
ISRAEL IS THE ONLY NATION IN
HISTORY THAT GOD HAS PROMISED
WILL NEVER BE DESTROYED.
HE'S FULFILLED THAT PROMISE.
SECONDLY, I'M GOING TO THANK
GOD FOR THE GREAT LEADERS WE
HAVE IN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IN
ISRAEL AND PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT
JUST FOR AMERICA.
HE HAS BECOME A WORLD LEADER
FOR PEACE.
AND FINALLY, I'M GOING TO BE
PAYING FOR PEACE IN JERUSALEM.
WE OUGHT TO BE WORKING TOWARD
PEACE.
THIS IS WHY THIS IS SO
IMPORTANT.
THE MOVING OF THIS EMBASSY
SYMBOLIZES THAT WE RECOGNIZE A
HISTORICAL TRUTH FOR 3,000
YEARS AND THAT IS JERUSALEM IS
THE LEGITIMATE CAPITAL OF
ISRAEL, AND IF THAT'S TRUE, IT
BLOWS APART THE MYTH
PERPETRATED BY THE LEFT THAT
THE ISRAELIS, THE JEWISH PEOPLE
CAME IN AND STOLE THIS LAND
FROM THE PALESTINIANS 70 YEARS
AGO.
YOU KNOW, NETANYAHU SAID LAST
NIGHT PEACE CAN NEVER BE BUILT
ON A LIE.
PEACE HAS TO BE BUILT ON TRUTH.
AND THE TRUTH IS THE JEWISH
PEOPLE HAVE OCCUPIED THIS LAND
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
JERUSALEM IS THEIR CAPITAL.
THAT IS THE STARTING PLACE, NOT
THE ENDING PLACE, BUT IT'S THE
STARTING PLACE FOR A TRUE PEACE
PROCESS.
STEVE: I THINK IT'S SUCH A
SIGNIFICANT DAY FOR SO MANY
PEOPLE, I REALLY APPRECIATE
THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO JOIN US
