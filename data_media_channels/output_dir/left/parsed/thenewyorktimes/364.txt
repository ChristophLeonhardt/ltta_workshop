The United Nations General
Assembly is basically 193
countries gathered together.
They meet continually, all year.
But this time of year is
basically a summit meeting
of their top leaders or senior
representatives that they send.
It is still the preeminent place
for diplomacy and the biggest
single place where it happens.
Trump is the newest thing.
This will be the first time that
President Trump is in a venue
with representatives of
so many other countries.
It's the most prominent place
for diplomacy in the world.
He's certainly socialized
with other leaders,
but never on the
scale like this.
Our withdrawal from the
agreement represents
a reassertion of
America's sovereignty.
This will be the
first time where Mr.
Trump and the proponents
of the climate agreement,
including the Secretary
General of the United Nations,
are in the same place where
this issue will be discussed.
It also comes against a backdrop
of these extreme weather events
that we've seen in Texas, and
Florida, and the Caribbean,
that some have linked
to climate change.
And that's created another
emotional undercurrent
to the debate.
A ballistic missile
launch failing just--
The North Koreans are on a
path to attain the capability
to strike the United States with
a ballistic missile that has
a nuclear warhead on it.
There is every expectation that
they will continue to do that
until they reach that point.
It's a crisis.
Of course, President Trump has
threatened North Korea in ways
that we hadn't seen
other leaders do,
and that's elevated tensions.
It's probably the
most serious thing,
from a conflict point of view,
that's confronting the United
Nations this year at
the General Assembly.
We're absolutely reducing
funding to the UN
and to the various
foreign aid programs,
including those run by
the UN and other agencies.
The Trump administration has
signaled that it wants to cut
its funding to a lot
of things overseas,
including what the United
Nations does in many parts
of the world.
The United States is the biggest
single contributor to the two
UN budgets--
the regular budget and
the peacekeeping budget.
And that hasn't changed.
We don't know a lot about what
else may be cut at the United
Nations because of US
voluntary contributions.
Trump has said-- he's said
insulting things about the UN.
He's called it a club for
elitists who sit around
and have a good time.
But at the same time, he's shown
a lot of respect for the UN.
Clearly he wants to make a
good impression at the UN.
That's interesting.
We want to see what
he says and does,
and how other leaders
respond to that.
So that, to me, is one reason
why this General Assembly will
stand out, because of Mr Trump.
