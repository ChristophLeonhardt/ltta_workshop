the CBO has finished their initial analysis of Donald Trump's budget proposal from earlier this year and so far it's looking like the numbers are not quite adding up both in terms of his claims about how it would cut the deficit and also and whether in the house they'll be able to get enough members of the freedom caucus to actually sign onto it so in this video we're gonna be breaking down both of those the budget projected this is under the CBO that by 2027 the economy would achieve a small budget surplus I think it was like 17 billion dollars but according to the CBO the deficit would remain at 720 billion dollars so small little rounding error there almost a trillion dollars a year difference but something to take note of for the future it's said that the average gross domestic product growth over 10 years is currently 1.8 percent and then under mr. Trump's plan it would be 1.9 percent a small raise so good news for mr. Trump but lower than the 3 percent the administration assumes and they do just assume it and they've been saying that throughout the campaign but I doubt any serious economic minds on the Trump team if there is one actually thinks that they can sustain that I don't know why they would believe they could get to those numbers but they do need it to make their budget sound plausible no in response all these numbers really fast Mick Mulvaney the White House budget director has called for the offices influence to be diminished and said recently that's time at gum and gone yeah so if you're gonna bother bringing facts here your time is is at an end so look the reason they promised a 3% is they know that it's not that's not realistic they promise it so that their numbers line up the rich will get their tax cuts and later when it doesn't happen they'll blame Obama or Hillary Clinton who cares Trump's full of a thousand excuses a million excuses yeah so you know what the Republicans are doing now they're like if you want to keep talking about this Donald Trump jr. story we're gonna restart an investigation on Hillary Clinton what she's in the woods dude she's totally irrelevant what a bizarre spiteful thing to say also okay yeah have at it Hoss yeah fine investigate difference yeah and by the way John Quincy Adams don't think I forgot what you did okay I love that we're now tracking down like we're doing hit jobs on failed candidates from the past like Jer and the meeting is like Mitt Romney what's he hiding okay Al Gore you bastard we're coming for you yeah you think they won't today well anyway so in this case they this is the thing that they care most about because that's why the freedom caucus is saying freedom caucus what a preposterous name by the way anyway it's the freedom for the rich that never pay taxes yeah so they're saying look if we're gonna do any kind of budget my boys meaning the rich need Ted tax cuts first yeah okay so you got a guaranteed me tax cuts I don't care about the budget I've never cared about the budget deficit that's all a marketing ploy so it's all a trick right yeah so yeah blow a trillion-dollar hole in it who cares I my guys my donors neither tax cuts and they need it right now yes we're not sure what's gonna have more truck well glad that you brought that up their lack of concern for what the budget would actually contain what effect it would have on real Americans because earlier today I saw on Bernie Sanders Twitter account he put out a really interesting chart a scary chart we should do the scary chart time thing about Medicaid cuts combined from the little bit of information we have from the budget proposal combined with the the Republican Senate health care bill let's bring this up and show the reduction in Medicaid spending year by year you're seeing that between 2017 and 2027 it would end up with a more than half of it cut away fifty two point two percent cut combined in those two proposals it's just that's just one issue area but think about the effect that we'll have in human terms on an actual American families what you're looking at in that chart is wealth redistribution the reason that they don't like Medicaid along with Medicare and Social Security and they call them entitlements the reason Medicare and Social Security are called entitlements is because you paid into them and hence you are entitled to your own money back when you retire or care when you get above the age of 65 in the case of Medicaid they're like oh like this is just going to the poor you mean Social Security Medicare at least also go to the middle class and the rich right this just goes to the poor no we need to take all the money from the poor and redistribute it to the top so the Medicaid is number one on their hit list so you know what their agenda is and this is what they've been trying to do since they passed Medicaid over 50 years ago it's trying to kill it and eventually it might take a long time but they can't eventually come for it it's one of the reasons a small side note but let's say hypothetically we get lucky and at some point we get single-payer across the country it'll be amazing a lot of people think that then that's the end of history that's not the end of history you can have legalized abortion for 40 years and they'll still try to kill it you can have Medicaid and Social Security for literally lifetimes and they will still try to kill it and so even after great success you do still have to be vigilant but I want to go over a couple of the numbers that you are alluding to that the the freedom caucus is going to require in terms of tax cuts but also cuts in spending this is from Mark Meadows chairman of freedom caucus saying if a budget is put forward today at 200 billion dollars on mandatory spending and without decisions on tax reform there would not be enough votes to pass it in the house because of the conservative concerns they would be willing to tank Trump's budget on those issues earlier in the week the freedom caucus said that it would be willing to support a 250 billion dollar package of cuts in exchange for supporting a hike to the nation's borrowing limit so are they not merciful that they would that they would give that and allow the government to continue to function so I look these guys are so draconian and so dysfunctional that I can't you know you know I love predictions but I cannot tell you right now what they're going to pass when it comes to the budget and even on on Obamacare I'm not I'm not positive and let alone anything else but there is one thing that you could write down in stone before Trump leaves by hook or by crook they are going to pass the biggest tax cuts for the rich and for corporations you have ever seen that this country has ever seen that's the one guarantee if you liked this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
