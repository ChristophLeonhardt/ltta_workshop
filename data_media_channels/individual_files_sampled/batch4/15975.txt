joining me now to discuss the deadliest terror attack in New York City since 9/11 this one committed by a Muslim convert from Uzbekistan is former CIA station chief in CIA Russia expert not you linger who's also a candidate for US Congress in Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district Scott thanks for joining me this morning thanks a lot not just all right just got your station chief in Moldova which was a former russian republic but you've operated in uzbekistan so you understand not just the lay of land there but the the terror problem and there there is Islamic terror conversion or Islamic terror cells will call them starting to proliferate in his beckus man correct oh yeah that's right there's been a problem out in Central Asia for a while I was I spent a year stationed in Tajikistan that's a real garden spot it's located it's the country directly north of Afghanistan so I was like you know peripherally involved in right after the post 9/11 environment so and I went into spec a Stan a lot and all of the stands as we call them all of the Central Asian countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union and they were all Muslim let's talk about whose Bekaa Stan so which terror groups are operating in Uzbekistan is that the usual suspects al Qaeda Isis where do they have their own offshoot splinter groups right they actually the main the main unit there is called the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan so it's the IMU and they've actually been around for a while since like the late 90s they started and what's happened lately is that they've morphed into an affiliate of Isis so they got started in about 99 and they were dedicated at the time to you know basically converting the Uzbek government which was run by a Korean Karima of an ex-soviet kind of guy they were into creating basically a a Sharia law country and so there was a big terrorist movement against the us-backed government that continued from not from basically 99 on and then it bled also into Tajikistan because Tajikistan had a bloody civil war in like the mid-90s so they participated in that as well and then what happened is shortly before 9/11 they actually got involved with bin Laden and they moved and a lot of these people moved south into Afghanistan okay so so we were so what you're saying is there were Taliban al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan from Uzbekistan from today that's right that's right I guess one thing one thing to remember with all this stuff it sounds really confusing is that you have to remember that the borders in Central Asia are artificial in other words it's not like only use Beck's live in Uzbekistan believe it or not there is Becks who live in Afghanistan and of course all of the other countries around them that the Soviets deliberately put minor minority groups in each of the countries to basically keep them in line because that way they'd be too busy fighting their local people then rather than thinking about revolting against the Soviet government but what happened was in the post-soviet environment it just creates all kinds of problems because each country has its own minority group that's ticked off at the majority right I'm gotcha so so let's go to what happened in New York the guy's name is a fool oh say UPOV he's 29 years old he came here to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010 on a diversity visa on a diversity visa quick digression Jeff Flake the neocon who's getting crushed in his Arizona Senate primary who had to drop out of the race actually tweeted at President Trump either this morning or last night that the gang of eight ended the diversity visa program which is easily disprovable it's still very alive and very active on the State Department's website I want to get into that a second but New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo a far left guy the guy who implemented the SAFE Act to prevent New Yorkers from being able to protect themselves said that say UPOV was radicalized here in the United States I personally have a hard time believing that Cuomo has that information already because this investigation is in its early stages that that seems political to me but let's talk about that for a second do you think a guy a 29 year old guy from Uzbekistan would have more likely radicalized there and potentially became more violent see see the way I see does this Scott I feel he was Muslim he was an adherent Muslim there but he weaponized here I think it's I think it's unfair to say he converted and radicalized here I think by interfacing with Isis here he weaponized I'm just curious to get your you're a Russia expert you're a former CIA station chief I'm just curious to get your thoughts on that I think that you're right John that's exactly it you know it's it's hard to believe that a 29 year old Jews Beck and especially depending on what part of Rebecca Stan he came from I'm willing to bet he came from the Fergana Valley and the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan is famous for radicalism so I bet you that is actually where he came from in other words he had a lot of this in him I'm sure that he had friends who were radicalized or maybe a relative or people in his neighborhood who had already been radicalized and then maybe once he got here then it grew but it's not like the guy suddenly decided to do this I think in the United States the problem with the diversity visa is that there's very little there's apparently very little vetting done with that they allow it was started under Ted Kennedy in like the mid 80s I think 86 and they basically let they let 50,000 people and and I don't know how much attention they paid to screening and so it's very it's very possible that you know he was let in despite having maybe a murky past or past that the embassy one was unable to confirm and so that he was let it let's let's go there because this is something you I've spoken about on air before and and you know vetting was a big part of what I did both in long right after and it's it's not you operated in these regions but it's nearly impossible to vet someone's background from these regions because they don't have the same type of data repositories and public record repositories that we do it's nearly impossible in fact I had one senior CIA case officer tell me that in many instances if they're trying to vet someone in Syria Afghanistan Iraq you know they drive out with a photo and they find a chief of a tribe or someone in a village and they say hey you know is this Mohammed he said he was you know there's the son of huazi and he was born somewhere 20 miles outside of Damascus in 1979 and they hope to get verbal and visual confirmation and they told me in many cases and a couple of special operators told me this that's as good as it gets was that your Experian as well that's right that's exactly right that kind of thing happens all the time and it's something that a lot of Americans they just don't understand the rest of the world does not live the wet like we do they're not digitized in Uzbekistan I mean literally I remember I met a guy who I was actually trying to recruit in he was an Uzbek and and and he had he knew Beck's who literally did not even know the year in which they were born they knew that they would say things like I was born the year that the watermelon crop was really good literally they didn't even know the year in which they were born so how can you perform due diligence on someone like that you're literally gonna drive out to the village and if you're talking about the Fergana Valley it's really far from the capital which is Tashkent and you could endanger your life by going out there maybe to verify one guy and so what are you gonna do you're probably just gonna hit the hit the button saying okay you're not because it's it's just impossible to verify these guys right and this is a perfect segue and where I wanted to go because you know the media is doing a pretty good job at giving us details of the incident I really wanted to dig into some inside baseball with you and and talk about things like vetting like extreme vetting now this is where these buzzwords bother me right because what extreme vetting really means is that once they get here they're asked a bunch of questions but like we just noted they can lie about them because we don't have any historical and empirical background information upon which to reconcile what they're telling us which leads us to where the progressives I think have completely fallen down with regards to national security I think at this point their policies are dangerous and deadly and that's in eliminating the profiling and monitoring programs and the one that always comes to mind again you and I've spoken about this was the confidential informant program that the NYPD was running in mosques around New York City that yielded just a treasure trove of actionable intelligence in a way it worked just for the audience's thatif occation was it didn't even have a religious test the NYPD would look at the arrest reports the NYPD intelligence division would look at arrest reports from the day before and if an arrest fee was from a nation of terror concern they would go down and interview that arrest day and if they would say a minor drug charge and that person could give them information or attended a mosque where there was sufficient of radicalism they would turn them as and maybe give him a break or completely dismiss the minor charge and it worked incredibly incredibly well and then they came in and eliminated that program and I can't help I did a hit on Canadian TV right before where we'd this segment and the reporter said well we would never know you know we can never detect these things and and it she clearly had a bit of a left-wing bent and she said well you know we still would know and I said well sure we would if we had a confidential informant in this guy's mosque who posed as another radical he may very well have cozy up to him but if we don't put those intelligence-gathering mechanisms in place we'll never know we're gonna be chasing around rentals on trucks from Home Depot which is a very reactive wait I think to investigate and it doesn't protect future it doesn't protect lives from future attacks I mean did let's talk about that a little bit hey do you think the programs are effective your expertise and B if you were elected to Congress what would you do to reinstate them right I mean there's no question right the forces of progressive liberalism you know basically and political correctness put a real clamp down on that I think maybe the New York Police decided to do this on their own it was a political decision on their part to curtail that and that's and that's a damn shame because like I said it's it was a very effective program you're using mosque crawlers we used to call them you know other countries certainly did it a lot I worked with other intelligence services Muslim intelligence services in fact that did this and other places like Azerbaijan but there's aliens I know do it because that's absolutely or a great cooperative partner in fact I was told they thought we were insane when we ended it that's right of course because it's it's common sense to them and they they find it difficult to understand like the forces of political correctness that you know have our country by the throat but this is the type of thing that I would look into in Congress because it's it's simply good police work it's good operational work it's you know the main responsibility of any government is to protect the lives of its people and clearly we've fallen down on that now looking looking at what happens and these are constitutional programs people need to understand these these programs operated under the oversight of judges they operate under oversight of you know the NYPD has a very robust legal Bureau they have dozens upon dozens of lawyers working for them that vet all of these in it her constitutionality before they're deployed it's not just some random police sergeant he says to his guys hey going to that mosque and start gathering information layer upon layer of oversight what it really tells us is that I don't believe progressives have any interest in protecting people because they knew this information yielded actionable intelligence that saved lives and here's the other part that bothers me Scott I'm an italian-american the La Cosa Nostra the Italian mob was tracked for years by profiling MA during Italian Americans nobody cared I didn't care Italian American cops an agent signed up to be on those details we profile Mexicans who might be cartel members we profile African Americans might belong to the Bloods and the Crips and no one cares but when you talk about profiling and monitoring monitoring mosques and Muslims all of a sudden it's off limits even in the wake of eight dead bodies on a New York City Street eight five of them argentinian tourists just coming to enjoy the city it's it's mind-blowing the stupid to me right exactly I mean it's just another example like as you said I mean the liberal progressives they don't care about security or they at least it's it's a backseat to their political agenda and you know I'm a case officer you were NYPD and I'm concerned with what works I'm a pragmatist okay if this is an effective program we continue it period if it's saving lives we continue it I mean it's pretty much black and white because you know that's the way we look at the world I mean not everything is black and white but something like this is black and white if it's an effective program you continue it and that other stuff is just background noise but the Liberals would have us you know trash all of these programs so we can feel good and then we have a situation like living in Sweden or in Paris so that's we go to Sweden because Sweden was an Uzbek as well correct that's right Sweden was um a guy named aquila and he was also in an ethnic respect I believe he was also brought in only maybe a few years before people have to confirm that I'm not sure it was brought in as a refugee and he hijacked the beer truck and ran over four people so again this shows you the necessity of you know by the way you know the the diversity lottery is one of the programs that President Trump was planning on getting rid of trashing the entire program because it deserves to be thrown away and it was blocked by these judges in Hawaii and stuff that we've heard about in the last few months I mean I mean I was reading a little bit about it on the State Department's website today when I when I hammered Jeff Flake on Twitter for lying about the program being ended and it was pretty shocking to me it's almost hey if you come from certain countries come on in we're not gonna ask you too many questions we're gonna give you carte blanche we're gonna roll out the red carpet we don't really care who you are or what you're into we you know that this progressive mindset Obama day is want you here it seems at this point just suicidal to me it does it really it really does I mean it shows you and it shows you you know the predisposition toward liberalism that is the State Department I mean right they're willing to rule a little at the rate but you know and this point this there is an open lottery right now as we're speaking here on air there's an open lottery until November 22nd for diversity visa applications and so these people are coming in as we sit here this is not even hearted an incredible right it's 50,000 people a year that's a lot how many people does that come out to be a day that's it's you know it's a 100 150 people 130 150 people a day roughly right exactly and then the very end the very purpose is it does tend to target countries that are known to harbor terrorists that like countries like Mali in you know in basically Arabic North Africa and and also in Central Asia in places I think it includes Eastern Europe too but I'm sure you'd find a very small percentage coming from you know Orthodox yeah and you were a conspiracy theorist you'd almost think there was an agenda on the part of the previous and it's just very weird that these things are but these things are going down and that we're still but but then again you raised an interesting point I was gonna say that we're still so dense about it but the State Department now CIA has a lot of interaction with the State Department the department is institutionally progressive is it not absolutely there's no question about it it's been that way for 75 years in that way since at least world war ii know why and it's just because you know i guess your classic old-school liberals tended to gravitate toward that government department and so readily softer they were generally generally speaking they were saw they're on the communist threat there were some notable people who were not but the but you know there were a number of officers found spying for the Soviet Union who were in the State Department because they had a natural predisposition to that and it's not just true of our service the British Foreign Service was a hotbed of pro-communist activity for instance um you know and this end the Russians targeted that you know he targeted Cambridge and we talked to start talking about kim Philby and all who was in the british intelligence but also had an affiliation with the British Foreign Service these people who went to Cambridge and all the right schools in the 30s had a predisposition toward communism based on I suppose the effects of the depression in the 1930s and we saw the same thing in our country it's similar to the State Department today where they've got this predisposition or globalism because they come out of schools with diversity applicant process exactly and things of that nature alright let's end on this note if today we hang up on this interview you go your way I go mine the president United States calls you and says Scott I need your back you're a Russia expert give me your top three ideas to mitigate this threat I mean first is obviously the diversity lottery has to be absolutely scrapped there's no question about it and then also we need to redouble our efforts to target mosques it's very clear we have eight dead people proving that that must be continued and we just have to keep on fighting the liberal progressive mindset that that you know basically ties the hands our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies it has to be done unlike you know we have to fight back this political correctness on a massive front using everything and that's why I think the president is very effective with a lot of his tweets and things like that he is fighting the cultural war because a lot of what we're talking about now it's based on the cultural war ironically that you know we know this cultural issue you're 107 is this is as much a culture war is it is a law enforcement issue a military war on terror an intelligence war on terror we've gotta fight this ridiculously far-left mindset at home that's telling us I mean it wouldn't nothing bothers me more than when we have eight dead innocence and the first narrative coming from the left is Jake Tapper on CNN he said allahu akbar is beautiful CNN is saying god is great they've got the killer said god is great in Arabic that's how the reporter started the segment with me earlier they are deliberately sanitizing the narrative to protect a terrorist it's mind-blowing last word a news guy right well just let's we need to fight this why because if we don't we're gonna wake up and we're gonna find out that we are Western Europe a continent that is at this point almost incapable of naming the true enemy and almost incapable of fighting it on anything like even terms and I don't want to wake up and find out that I'm living in a country like Germany or France because they're they're on a long slide downward because they fail to address these issues when they came up I could not agree more this was Scott you linger former CIA station chief retired u.s. naval commander and now candidate for United States Congress Pennsylvania's 15 congressional district my friend and also one of my favorite go-to expert Scott thanks a million for being here we're gonna speak about this very very soon again sure thanks Alicia you got it you
