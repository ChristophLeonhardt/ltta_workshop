so Billy Graham is dead the Avenger Jellicle preacher he was 99 years old so a lot of you probably only know him as you know an old guy who would occasionally come out of the shadows and and you say something or people would talk about him but when I was a kid he was eight he was like the Pope of America he was like a fixture on television he knew all the presidents he was on talk shows and if he made a comment about the news it was news I mean he was that kind of important person out in my family which was a family of liberal East Coast Jews I think we always looked at him as a little bit threatening he was that part of America that was different from us and maybe excluded us and maybe was not welcoming to us my father I wrote about this in my memoir the great good thing that my father was a GI during World War two and the news of the Holocaust the news that six million Jews had been exterminated in this kind of mechanistic way scarred him for life it scarred my father for life he was paranoid and anything that he saw in politics he was a liberal in anything he saw it was conservative that was religious that was overly patriotic he immediately thought that the Holocaust was coming again and I don't mean that it wasn't like like you know liberals now oh you're literally Hitler he literally thought it was Hitler you know so I mean when he would see a character like Billy Graham preaching the gospel talking to presidents talking about Jesus Jesus Jesus he just found it very very threatening and that was kind of the atmosphere in my house it took me a long time to realize how entirely nuts this was and to understand that many ways it was people like Billy Graham who kept this country sane it was people like him who brought it back to itself who reminded it where it came from you know of what the underlying ethos of our country was he is the guy that the right that the left he usually hated and yet and yet even people like Dan Rather said when they went to investigate him as an investigative reporter and then they heard him preach they would all they almost came to Jesus they almost came down and and gave themselves to the Lord and and I think that he you know when I get a letter as I occasionally do that says something that I said or that maybe my memoir helped someone find God in his life that's probably the the letter that makes me feel best because it's not like oh I enjoyed your show it's not like oh I enjoyed your novel it's like an eternal wind you know it's like an infinite infinite win and I always joke that if I have enough of those when I get to heaven not only will they let me to happen but they'll give me a toaster you know that he can get an extra little bonus but he did thousands upon thousands of thousands of people I'm gonna tell them a little bit about that all week long we've been talking about what I think are fake crises this gun crisis the school shooting crisis it's not that that's not a tragedy it's not like it's not a terrible thing but a crisis or something different a crisis is something that if you don't get on it if you don't stop it right away it's going to lead to a disaster that's what a crisis is a crisis is something that if you don't turn it around it's gonna lead to a disaster I do not think guns are a crisis in this country and I certainly don't think the Russian trolling of our election was a crisis we've been talking about crisis after crisis that doesn't exist it is simply a tool that the media which is the left is using to take your rights away to gain more power in the case of the guns it's to take your god-given right to defend yourself away in the case of the Russians illegitimate Ahnold Trump who they hate but but there actually is a crisis in this country that's real and I think the passing of Billy Graham gives us good reason a good pretext to talk about that real crisis trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show hurray arise mailbag

and the crises cNN has now crossed over you know remember when Donald Trump said that these people are the enemy of the people they're the enemy of the people they have crossed over into a kind of disgusting craziness they are using the traumatized children of this disaster disaster to push gun control they're feeding them lines let's just take a look at that montage as I send you that montage yeah let's just play as montage of them coaching these poor kids to sell their agenda do you have a message for the lawmakers you have a message for Congress for the president here David we wanted to have you back because your interview yesterday got a lot of attention with us because you may this personal appeal you just looked at the camera and you said to everybody listening we're children you're adults figure this out children are dying did you hear from any leaders did you hear from anybody in power after that yesterday people who say there's nothing you can do to stop somebody if they want to kill they're gonna find a gun no matter the law as a 16 year old student who just went through this in your community with your friends and what would you say to the adults I want to read one of the president's tweets from over the weekend he wrote me what do you think of this tweet and others from the president this week's look we have examples of other countries that have done more and have passed national gun control laws and guess what gun violence went down shocking do you think that you and your friends are going to finally do what it takes to make a difference on this issue you know what I what I would like to do is I would like to bring in some traumatized kids from the ghettos of Chicago and Baltimore and st. Louis and New Orleans cities that haven't been run by a Republican since the Jurassic age I'd like to bring in some of the kids of the relatives of the kids were being killed there every single night by stolen guns by guns gotten illegally and I'd like to ask them you know shouldn't we have a city that's run by Republicans wouldn't you want and prefer to have your city run by Republicans what you prefer if your mom had married your dad wouldn't you prefer if the culture of drugs weren't sweeping over your neighborhoods you know it's disgusting it is disgusting what they are doing and it's not the kids fault obviously and their and their I'm sure their parents and their are hearing from psychologists saying well it's good that they're talking about it it makes me talking about it but not on CNN and not being used to express an opinion you know people's opinion has changed between the time they're 16 and the time they're 25 they may not want to go back and see that they went on TV saying something that they no longer agree with and remember it's it's not it's not that people don't have a right to be opposed to the Second Amendment and the god-given right to defend yourself they do have a right to be opposed to that it's that they're not giving them a chance to hear the other side of the argument to hear the side about freedom I mean this is the same CNN is the same place where they told us that the lady in North Korea was winning PR victories over Mike Pence a vice president of a free country I mean they're saying stuff about Donald Trump there was an article in The Washington Post by an assistant professor at the University of Richmond where he was comparing Trump to Peron you know the Argentine dictator Juan Peron and we've seen Evita you know this is like this communist dictator and say Oh Trump is much worse Trump is much worse you know Peron did some good things he did some good things and as I was saying yesterday we know that fascists can do some good things they used to say the Nazis made that no they said Mussolini the fascists made the trains run on time and fascists do good things Kings do good things communists do good things but you're not free when you have those people running your country so this is a question of freedom versus slavery and as long as we got people like CNN who think freedom is slavery we want our guns and that the other thing about this is again they're using emotion to tell us there is a crisis and I'm sorry you know but I'm taking this from an article today in the Wall Street Journal by John Carlson the number of guns in America rose nearly 50% between 1993 and 2013 during the same period gun homicides fell by nearly 50 percent the notion that more guns mean more crime is simplistic and false and the fact that that crime is going up that these shootings are going up here's from USA Today since 1990 there have been 22 shootings at elementary and secondary schools in which two or more people were killed not counting those perpetrators who committed suicide whereas five of these incidents have occurred over the past five plus years since 2013 claiming the lives of 27 victims 17 at Parkland the latter half of the 1990s decade whispers seven multiple fatality shootings with a total of 33 killed 13 at Columbine so it's not a crisis it's a tragedy and they're using the tragedy your emotions that are naturally ginned up during a tragedy as they should be they're using those emotions to make you feel it's a crisis because they know that in a crisis you might do something stupid like give up your right to defend yourself and the other crisis about Russia I'll talk about that in a minute but first let us talk about Boland branch if there's something I know about it is bed sheets why because I never sleep but I do go to bed I lie awake all night and you want real if you're gonna do that you want really really comfortable sheets and same thing is true if you're gonna go to sleep

the Russian crisis and I'm going back to CNN because they are jet this is criminal CNN did something so despicable yesterday they they went to a ordinary human being who voted for Trump and basically accused her of colluding with the Russians this is after rod Rosenstein said that in the 13 in the indictment of 13 Russian trolls no Americans including Donald Trump wittingly sided with the Russian czar colluded with the Russians they go to this ordinary woman they show her house they tell her name they docks her basically and listen to this bullying piece I mean this guy this he's gonna have to answer for this at some point in the big court upstairs you know let's listen to what this guy does to her what part of it the missus that cover up what you saying that's not true the Russians I don't care if they were involved or not that's that to me is the least important but they were involved with you did you guys know that they weren't involved yes you know just make sure that you would put it correctly that you know what you guys were involved with being patriotic right very very patriotic but 19 patriotic was the group that contact it and helped organize some of these activities that you posted on your own Facebook account those were legitimate those were Russians but not Russians I don't go with the Russians that route was Russians I have nothing to do with the Russians fool apparently you did know maybe you didn't know it yes when you're talking like this I don't want to have anything to do with you well I'm talking what so well with me were all Trump supporters very very much so and all apparently following the direction of groups that were associated with Russians who were actually infiltrating yeah please please report that I don't believe that that's I know all the people that were with me okay they were at my meetings they're all Trump supporters okay mm-hmm it's guy ought to go home and look in the mirror if you want to system wants to see what a low-life looks like because yesterday we played CNN covering an anti Trump rally ginned up by the Russians that the Russians had done and they were covering it like it was it was a revelation like it was expressing the will of the people why did we get this guy's address here John Nolte once said to me John you know note the overt Breitbart the late John Knoll because he used to be here you know we were having dinner one night and he said every time every time these guys come out and expose something about an ordinary American we ought up we have a have an organization that researches them and finds out who they're sleeping with and finds out what porn the user you know because this is a it's an obscene thing to do but it's all to tell you that your vote was helping the Russians that voted for Donald Trump you know you are a bad guy so because of the death of Billy Graham I want to talk about something that has been on my mind for a while it's about what is a crisis in this country because you know steven pinker who's a writer that i like us he's I think he's a psychologist or psychiatrist but he he writes science books and he's got this new piece about the Enlightenment and I'm gonna come back to Pinker and the reason I want to make it clear that the reason I'm using Pinker's he's an entertaining writer he's an intelligent man and I as far as I know in the public sphere I don't know him privately but as far as I know in the public sphere he's a man of goodwill and I think he's doing things that are wrong and I'm gonna point that out but I think he's a person of goodwill and you know somebody that I would I'd love that him on the show we can get him if we can get him on the show I'd love to debate him about but he wrote this piece in the in The Wall Street Journal I guess kind of promoting his new book about the enlightenment and he says things are going great he says consider the u.s. just three decades ago our annual homicide rate was eight point five four hundred thousand that's three decades ago eleven percent of us fell below the poverty line is measured by consumption and we spewed 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide and thirty four point five million tons of particulate matter into the atmosphere that's thirty years ago fast-forward to the most recent numbers available today the homicide rate is 5.3 a blip up from 4.4 and 2014 three percent of us fall below the consumption poverty line and we emit four million tons of sulfur dioxide in 20 points six million tons of particulate despite generating more wealth and driving more miles and this is you know fantastic news I mean going around the world poverty is falling disease those horrible plagues that almost wiped out humankind they are falling hunger all these things are all going away all these predictions that we were going to become overpopulated they were all overtaken by science now Pinker says this is due to the Enlightenment and one of the things that really gets me not just about Steven Pinker but it gets me about a lot of these atheist science writers is they really know their science but they don't know their history and they don't know their theology and that when they start talking to me Pinker writes a whole one of the books he read he wrote he writes the whole thing about how there's no ghost in the machine well the ghost in the machine is an idea I don't have time to go into its history right now but it's an idea that came came of age after the Renaissance as a reaction to certain kind of scientific thinking it is not the way most people have thought about the soul forever I mean Plato wrote about the fact that there's no ghost it's not like your soul can blow away after you die if there's a high wind you know there's that so so in other words he's arguing with things that most Christians most believers don't believe because he doesn't study theology he studies science and then he thinks oh boy you know this is like really good now I want to compare him so so he's talking about he gives credit to the Enlightenment but the thing is there were many Enlightenment s' there was the French enlightenment which was all based on rationality and reason and it ended with the terror it ended with people tearing each other apart in the name of Reason behaving each other in the name of Reason then there was the British enlightenment and remember the British crackdown on revolutionary that is they did not want the French Revolution to spread and so they started jailing writers they have a big crackdown about it but they maintained a liberalisation of policies they moved into the future burying their traditions with them and they owned the next century they invented the steam engine they basically guided the Industrial Revolution it came out of England they invented America right they invented the Constitution those guys who were based in Britain those Anglo Americans invented the Constitution it was from them many many of them people of faith and an atmosphere of faith and a country of full of faith was many of them that guided us into into the present now here it is them so things are going great but here's another thing I just this is why I say it's a crisis life expectancy in the u.s. fell for the second year in a row in 2016 now think about that for a minute I mean if that is not a guide to how well things are going scientifically life expectancy in America fell two years in a row now it may be a blip two years is not you know a trend but it's still it's an important statistic and the life expectancy was nudged down by what opioid overdoses people are killing themselves they're killing themselves trying to stop some kind of internal pain now the House Republicans are taking this up today and good for them but I think that you know I am a deep believer in trying to solve your problems without drugs altogether I'm not a doctor so don't go off your meds cuz I said so I'm just saying that you know even even when you take antidepressants it should be in order to get off antidepressants you should take them unless you have a strictly scientific imbalance and it's not caused by the events in your life you should you know try to get off the antidepressants through therapy and if the antidepressants help you do that that's fine so what I'm talking about is I'm talking about a world where things are going great and everybody is miserable louis c.k that our routine about that everything's fantastic everything's amazing and everybody's miserable and that seems to be really true in this country and throughout the West and Europe they're not even having children anymore in Japan they're not having children anymore they're dying out and then they the elites say well we have to bring in more immigrants and you think well why don't you just have more children you know I said this to somebody the other day I said he said this we have to bring in immigrants he was from another country I won't say which because it was a private conversation but he was he said we have to bring in immigrants because we're not having children I said well why don't you get people to have more children and he said well we're already we've got all kinds of benefits for people with children I thought well maybe that's not giving people benefits is not what makes them have children you know maybe it's hope and a sense of themselves in a sense of a mission in life and a sense of purpose I want to play for you Billy Graham at his at his peak and I want to compare him to Pinker and some of these other guys and again I think picker is a wonderful writer and a man of goodwill but I just think he's wrong I think the way he thinks is wrong oh I read the book unbroken wonderful wonderful book and if you just saw the movie you shouldn't go go read the book about Louie Zamperini he was an Olympic distance runner and he ran in the Jesse Owens Olympic in 36 he shook Hitler's and afterwards and all this and he and he became an American soldier and he was captured by the Japanese and he was tortured I mean the scenes of torture in this book she writes the book so well that it's not unbearable but it's horrible it is horrible he was tortured beyond the ability of a normal human being to imagine and he came back and he was of course he was of course broken the fact that he lived through the things he lived through just the time he was on the raft before he was rescued by the Japanese and then the torture he went through afterwards that anybody could live through this is a testimony to his internal fortitude but after that he was broken he became a drunk he loved his wife and one day he woke up with his hands around her throat because he thought he was strangling the guy he had a dream that he was strangling the guy who tortured him he was filled with rage he was unreachable his wife even though he loved his wife he was gonna lose her he was unreachable and he walked in and he heard one of Billy Graham's early sermons he would set up this tent and so many people showed up that Graham even though he was losing his voice kept pushing on kept going out and he went there and he was saved and when I say he was saved never mind what happens to him after death you know let's put that aside for a minute he was saved in this life too because God came into his life and his the last half of his life was just as beautiful as the first half had been more so because he was suddenly helping other people that anger fell away from him he forgave the man who tortured him which is an amazing thing to have done I don't think I could have done that but it transformed him you only have to do that once you only have to do that once as far as I'm concerned to get the toaster when you get to heaven Billy Graham did this tins and tens of thousands of times I don't know how many times probably millions of times let's just play his his the second tape number 13 Billy Graham preaching and his heyday about the fact that the the truths of the Bible are revealed not to the wise old fashioned you know fire and brimstone kind of style of preaching it's kind of gone out of fashion but this thing brought people he's I think he's in Madison Square Garden he would he would fill the garden like the Beatles he would fill the garden and people would find themselves coming to Christ and you know he's the guy who talked to George W Bush when when W was using drugs and drinking we don't know exactly what he was doing but we know it was bad he took a walk with Billy Graham and he came and changed life this was a powerful powerful guy now let's compare this to Pinker talking about why he doesn't believe in in God and why it's not a scientific idea I think that using the word God or or the attitude of faith toward that what you don't know is is a cop-out it's a way of slapping a label onto something rather than trying to understand it or since we may not not understand everything just say there's some things we don't understand to invent stories that sound as if they were true or could be true to pretend that they're true just so that we can have a story I think is is unsatisfying and it could even be immoral because it could lead you to mistaken policies to getting in the way of your best understanding of how the world works to doing things that could that lead to more harm than good and this is a narrative that a lot of these guys Sam Harris to Chris Christopher Hitchens a guy whose prose I just love sell and they the way it works is they compare the best of science with the worst of religion so they compare you know a cure for diseases from science and then they compare a Christian bigoted or who goes out and hurt somebody in the name of his religion if instead they compared the atom bomb to the Christian charity then they would have a harder argument to make no science there is no science for taking the rage out of Louie Zamperini heart and the thing the other thing they talk about is they talk they'll point to the brain and they'll say here's a light that goes off when you experience God so therefore that's where God lives and I say well here's a light that goes off in your brain when you experience rain you know I could touch that and make you experience rain but you wouldn't get wet because it wouldn't be true the question is not whether you experience God in your brain the question is are you experiencing something real now how do you know that how do you know that's something you experience that's subjective is real when I first met my wife I picked her up hitchhiking she got in my car I knew exactly that I had found the woman of my dreams 40 years later without it we've had an argument for yours I adore her to this day obviously I was right but I can only know that through lived experience there's nothing in my brain that they can look at to know that over the course of 40 years I'm sure I felt a million things about my wife but I never stopped loving her so I was right when I saw her that subjective experience related to something true when louisa when the anger and the rage fell from Louise Zamperini heart when the tendency to depression fell from my heart I was experiencing something real that nobody can do they can give you a pill that stops you feeling your depression but they cannot give you a pill that improves your life and suddenly gives you an understanding of who you are why you were made weary and where you come from it is a different thing you know they all the arguments the thing the thing that gets me about the arguments of the atheists is not that they don't have the right to make them not that they're bad for people for making them none of that is true what gets me is their arguments are not very good I've heard Sam Harris Sam Harris would say well they're books that disagree you know the Quran says you can't believe that Jesus is the Son of God the Bible says you have to well there are books on science that disagree too and science has changed his mind and science has been wrong that's a ridiculous thing to say I mean I'm just saying it's not that Harris is a bad guy you know and then it has nothing to do with it I'm just saying it's not a good argument where is the argument that of Louie Zamperini Zinner life is an argument that actually is an argument it's circumstantial you know when you go in people watch TV and they hear somebody say that's just circumstantial evidence so they think circumstantial evidence is no good but if you go into a court of law law and you serve on a jury they will explain to you that some circumstantial evidence is dispositive is proof if you look out the window and there's snow and you walk away and you come back in their footprints in the snow somebody walked in the snow that's circumstantial evidence the evidence of what God does in people's life is evidence it lasts over time it just like my love for my wife that lasts over time and it can be experienced these guys without meaning to without being bad guys are contributing to this crisis in America when you tell people that they're just a bunch of chemicals and they can solve their problems by opiates they're gonna die of opiate overdoses when you tell them that there's no purpose to their life that nobody made nobody loves them there's their sense of right and wrong comes is just a kind of random relative idea you take away from them every single thing they have of value everything they have of value their house is not valuable their love is not valuable nothing is valuable if they themselves are not there if you tell them they have no free will they have no soul they have no spirit these guys all the best with all the best wishes in the world thinking that they're saving us are really starting a crisis and it is what so what makes it a crisis I know I always come back to the media but it's the media's fault but makes it a crisis is when they make these bad arguments the media makes them famous because they are saying what the media wants you to believe that there's no god there's no purpose you have to depend on the state for everything you're going nowhere they are wrong and that's a crisis Billy Graham is silence God is still speaking if America stops listening that will be the real crisis we got the mailbag coming up I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come to the Daily wire and subscribe it's a lousy ten bucks a month you can be in the mail bag and I can solve all your problems as well for a lousy hundred bucks you get the leftist tears tumblr which fills up like magic every time I speak come on over to the Daily wire calm we got the mailbag coming up all right mailbag all right so we gotta get to her baby in here to do it you know like mail back whatever baby say all right from James Clavin from a new subscriber welcome our Republicans afraid to address the national debt because in order to do so they would need to make cuts that would make it impossible for them to be reelected basically yes that's they you know that is the thing is it is the nature of government to get bigger it is the nature of people to want to be taken care of it is the nature of people to not want to give up anything that they've been given anything that anything they feel is free that they've been given never mind that it eats into their freedom it is the nature of people not to notice that their freedom is being eaten away there is never any incentive never any incentive for politicians to make more free accept the will of the people and the understanding of the people that's why when the left invades our universities when they take over our TV stations when they take over our entertainment industry that's why it's so powerful because there's always incentive for the government to grow bigger and crush and the bigger the government the smaller the human being you know and and it it does you know the the welfare state does make people's lives better until it stops until you become Europe and you're not having children anymore until you've become Japan and nothing matters anymore because everything's being taken care of so you don't need children you don't need purpose you don't need life if the Muslims come in and take over your country you don't even know how to fight anymore you don't even know how to stamp because they took your guns away so it is really a matter of philosophy that is why conservatives are always fighting against the Thai that is why conservatives are always the minority in the Republican Party and they have to have big voices loud voices angry voices to get anything done it is the nature of government to grow and so then the debt it goes against these guys nature gives them everything make every penny they spend buys them votes buys them power why would they cut the debt all right from Richard dr. Clavin you have shared in the past criticism you've received from evangelicals for various reasons I believe it's because I believe when was the fact that you disprove the story of Samson by being Jewish and not losing your strength after shaving your head that's very good all right we Christians can be very hard on our own occasionally causing converts to subsequently leave the faith how has it been for you and has it caused you to have similar thoughts love your personal theology and podcast well thank you you know the thing is you have to find God first and then find a church you can't you know maybe maybe it works if you walk into a church I am part of the I was baptized into the Episcopalian Church I hate the Episcopalian Church I love the liturgy you know I have philosophical differences with the Catholics but I'm basically a Catholic in theology and I have I can't join the Catholic Church for a lot of reasons because of some of the things I disagree with and I don't want to pledge to something that I'm not going to fulfill but if you find God first and you find Christ and you read the Gospels and you root yourself in the gospel and in good theology then a church that things that happen in church don't matter as much so I can go to a church and listen to some liberal sermon and it just goes right past me because I know that guy he's not Jesus he's speaking from the pulpit of Christ but he's abusing that that privilege you know I don't like it when people you know denounce me as nobody likes to be denounced and I really dislike it when I say something like I believe the Bible should be somebody wrote in the other day and so the Bible should be read literally not literally and that's what I believe I believe there are different genres in the Bible meant to communicate different things every time I say that somebody says you're calling God a liar because it's the Word of God it's not the Word of God know how I know the Bible says it's not the Word of God it says Jesus is the word of God so you know yeah I don't like that stuff but I'm rooted in Christ I'm rooted in the Gospels I'm rooted in two thousand plus years of theology some of which is excellent and I read a lot of it and I pay attention it's up to you it's up to you to have this relationship with God the church I think can really help I'm having I'm struggling right now because I can't find a church where I feel comfortable it's bad not to be surrounded by my fellow Christians but I work here at the Daily wire where there are a lot of them running around even Knolls it's kind of a Christian right I think what is he a Catholic or something that's almost a Christian like oh I'm joking but anyway that's the that's the thing fine God first when Christ first and then the church will fall into place and the things that people do will kind of roll off your back a little bit from Benjamin greetings clay Vinnie whose intellect rivals that of Socrates I have a dilemma my college is having a racial unity day on Monday the school wants everyone to wear black and solidarity for our schools racial diversity I really don't want to do it because it seems idiotic and divisive should I wear black that day and go against my Christian beliefs and be accepted by society or not wear black and fear being rejected and chastised by my peers I can't tell you what you would do I would never do it I would just not do it I mean you know I take the heat because it's worth it and then if you know if they really come down on you you'll see what they're made of if they discuss it with you that will give you a chance to calmly and quietly explain why you're not doing it so make sure you have that or you ready but before you do it that's just I'm just telling you what I would do I can't tell you what you should do because there will be a cost for it so you got to decide whether you want to take that cost from mmm Clark dear Clavin god of tough-guy protagonists my sister has gotten in a position where she is making romantic and career decisions against her better judgment I will warn her beforehand she will do it anyways and when it inevitably ends horribly as warned she comes back and my wife and I console her she agrees with our warning completely before she makes her terrible decisions but doesn't anyway this has been going on for years and I'm going to lost what I can do for her or myself thank you yeah I've been in this situation probably a lot of you have here's the thing you got two things we got to do one is you have to detach and when I say that that I think it's Alan on one of those alcoholic places they say detach with love you know loving detachment when I say detach it means you have to take yourself out of the equation you know that you you can't put your happiness your life at risk or you can't tie your happiness and your life to what she does she obviously is self-destructive that's the first thing and the second thing is maybe you can change the nature of the conversations you have with her a lot of people and I've worked on hot lines and I've run into this a lot of times a lot of people thrive off this exchange you know the that they like the warning and the disaster and coming back hangdog they want you to do that that's part of some kind of neurotic cycle that they're in so maybe you can just break you or part of that cycle by starting to listen to the deeper issues of why she's trying to hurt herself which what is she trying to do what is it that makes her feel that she's unworthy you know I I mean I have sat with I've literally sat with women who I knew were marrying a some disastrous guy and they'll say well that's what I deserve you know this is your whole life you know your photo you know so so people have these things in them that that make them self-destructive maybe you should be talking about that maybe you should stop giving warnings me you know she already knows she's obviously thriving off that system that system is working for her in some ways so the first thing I would detach emotionally I would stop getting angry stop getting dire stop being urgent and then sit and talk to her and see where she's coming from and why we've tried to find out maybe why some of this is going on that would be what I would do dear Lord Clavin stopper of the hammering and master of single nostril breathing how do they know that I that's something I tried to do in private my girlfriend and I are two years into our relationship as of tomorrow but I'm having a hard time with her whenever she brings up any political matters I am a conservative libertarian while she is a moderate progressive as far as I know late lately she has gotten more outspoken about how much he hates Trump and conservative media while she's preaching the Young Turks and so on as gospel I've tried to discuss where she is wrong in the tactful way by making her follow her own reasoning out yeah that's always a bad move with women but she shuts staff and dismisses everything I say we've been happy for the past few years and it's just gotten increasingly difficult of late should I continue trying to make it work by holding my tongue or should I break it off alright so you know this has gotten very difficult in the age of Trump because Trump sets women off and one of the things about women you will notice is that sometimes when they are set off the difference between their emotions and reality disappears okay so if you say to somebody is say to a woman you know your life has actually gotten better under Donald Trump they don't care because he sets them off and I can see why he does he said things about women they're disgusting you know he's done things I suspect he's accused of doing things that are disgusting and they just feel like why is this guy being elevated some reason didn't bother as many of them with Clinton or JFK all of these guys did these things but some reason Trump is just so open about it and so he lacks the hypocrisy to cover it up and the press of course wants to expose every little thing and so it just sets them off so here's the thing the question is are you happy are you happy together is is this a problem that is just kind of expressing some deeper conflict between you this is making you miserable I you know I feel incredibly blessed to be in the marriage I'm in but one of the things that before I got married before I met my wife I just thought to myself as I'm not living in a fractious home I am NOT living in a place where we argue every day where you know I have to have a power struggle every day I'm setting down some guidelines from the start I'm gonna let you know my wife know how I'm going to live and that's an important thing to go into so the question is here you know if this becomes a permanent relationship if it becomes a marriage and just goes downhill you're going to be deeply deeply unhappy so the politics are secondary the first thing is are you happy is this the woman you want to be with that's the first thing if the answer is no well then this problem is solved you just break it off if the answer is yes you do want to stay with her then you have to find a new way to deal with this I mean she is having an emotional experience about Donald Trump she is having this emotional experience as a big deal in women's lives I think in men's lives emotional experiences are kinda like yeah whatever you know ask my emotions I'm done you know but I think in women's lives emotional experiences are a bigger deal you know you might want to listen to what she's saying without arguing with her you might want to just tell her you disagree with her you might want to just let her vent from time to time you might want to use opportunities to say what you think is good without making it an argument you know back off basically back off and let her have her experience and accept that it's her experience and that doesn't mean you shut up that doesn't mean you don't express your opinion that doesn't mean you let her browbeat you into changing your mind it simply means that you don't have to argue with her every time she says something that sets you off don't let her set you off but that's if you just first you get to decide whether you actually want to be with her that's just not a question I can I can handle I'm running out of time but I'll take one more from the name seems to be Sylvia Andrew I'm an aspiring screenwriter who grew up with 80s Hollywood movies and they're unapologetic patriotism and optimism when I came from Austria to Los Angeles to attend film school I was surprised by the rampant anti Americanism and pessimism do you think there's a chance of Hollywood ever coming back to the same optimism and patriotism as depicted throughout the 80s yes and no I think that there is a chance of Hollywood becoming more diverse if if conservatives start to realize that this is an important vehicle not just for entertainment but also for ideas and attitudes so when conservatives the problem with Hollywood is yes do they lock out conservatives yes but the conservatives go and storm the doors and buy the studios and start studios no and conservatives are constantly you know first they make trashy kind of g-rated positive rah-rah movies without having without any depth and without any kind of artistic scope artistic vision but also also they just don't put the kind of energy into it there's no think tanks about entertainment think tanks don't have any people who are expert in popular culture they don't have any people they don't have any awards there are no review venues that where people who really know movies and TV can review them they'll give the you know most of the conservative magazines will give a review to some guy who's a political writer and then wonder why he didn't do a good job reviewing the movies so that's on us if conservatives come to their senses then Hollywood will become more diverse Hollywood will never become again I shouldn't say never but it doesn't look anytime soon like they will become again what they were at their peak in 1939 because they had the studio system which was essentially a form of you know indentured servitude and that has been broken up and that meant that the businessmen ruled right now which have got as a system where a lot of the talent rules and talent is stupid and talented as leftist and talent that you know doesn't really know as much as businessmen and they don't react to profits and since profits have now become so diverse I mean I'm getting into the high weeds but they don't they make their money no matter what they do basically so I think it's very possible that Hollywood will get more diversification scum to their senses I don't think it's ever gonna go back to being a unified voice in favor of America which it was at its greatest moment alright I'm out of time I wish I had there's a couple more when it's answer but I can't let's do some tickety-boo news how long is this Daily Mail TV we have a clip from Daily Mail TV about a woman who is a Exorcist in Hollywood whether
