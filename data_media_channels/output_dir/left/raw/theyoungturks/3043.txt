1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,890
ALABAMA'S SPECIAL ELECTION
FOR A NEW SENATOR GAVE US

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,400
RESULTS WE WERE HOPING FOR, DOUG
JONES DID BEAT ROY MOORE BY A

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,530
SMALL MARGIN,
1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,789
HOWEVER, ROY MOORE BELIEVES THAT
GAP IS A LITTLE TOO SMALL

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,570
AND HE REFUSES TO CONCEDE.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,210
HE'S CALLING FOR A RECOUNT.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,250
LET'S HEAR IT FROM HIM.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,930
>>THANK YOU.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,600
I REALLY WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT AND

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,160
REALIZE WHEN THE VOTE IS THIS
CLOSE THAT IT'S NOT OVER, AND WE

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,810
STILL GOT TO GO BY THE RULES
ABOUT THIS RECOUNT PROVISION,

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,860
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS
EXPLAINED IT TO US, AND WE ARE

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,480
EXPECTING THAT THE PRESS WILL GO
UP THERE AND TALK TO THEM TO

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,059
FIND OUT WHAT THE SITUATION IS.

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,080
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT GOD IS

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,079
ALWAYS IN CONTROL.

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,260
>>APPARENTLY GOD DECIDED, I
LIKE DOUG JONES A LITTLE BETTER.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,360
I LIKE HIM ABOUT 1.5 POINTS
BETTER THAN I LIKE YOU, ROY.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
I

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,209
KNOW IT'S A GOOD MOMENT AND A
FUN MOMENT AND A LOT OF THE

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,420
PRESS HAS DONE THIS TO RUB IT
INTO ROY MOORE AND SAY SORE

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,990
LOSER AND THEY LOVE TO SAY THAT,
I'M NOT IN THAT CAMP.

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,990
I LOVE

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,810
RECOUNTS, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THEY
ARE SO EXPENSIVE -- NO THEY

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,000
AREN'T. THE MONEY WE LOSE TO
CORRUPT POLITICIANS DOING

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,850
GIVEAWAYS TO THEIR DONORS IS 1
BILLION TIMES MORE THAN A SIMPLE

27
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,850
RECOUNT.

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,430
IF A RECOUNT IS IN ANY
WAY MERITED I WOULD BE IN FAVOR

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,180
OF IT, AND IN THE BEGINNING OF
THE NIGHT WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE

30
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,880
THE MARGIN WAS UNDER ONE POINT,
I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED A

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
RECOUNT.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,570
IF YOU WON, YOU WON,
IT'S OKAY.

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,570
UNLESS THEY THINK

34
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,280
THEY WILL SOMEHOW CHEAT IN A
RECOUNT, BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,070
OF THAT, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
WILL WEIGH IN AND A SECOND, BUT

36
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,340
AS IT TURNS OUT IN ALABAMA IF IT
IS WITHIN HALF A POINT YOU HAVE

37
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,530
TO DO A RECOUNT AND THAT'S
GREAT, YOU SHOULD.

38
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,530
I WOULD

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,540
SUPPORT A RECOUNT FOR ANYTHING
UNDER A POINT.

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
AS IT TURNED OUT

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,390
THIS WAS 1.5 POINTS, REALLY WELL
OUTSIDE OF THE RULES.

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,390
ROY MOORE

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,650
SAYS HE RESPECTS THE RULES, HE
GOT KICKED OFF THE ALABAMA

44
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,508
SUPREME COURT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
RESPECT THE RULES, SO IF HE

45
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,209
RESPECTED THE RULES OF ALABAMA
IN THIS CASE HE WOULDN'T

46
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,220
ASK FOR A RECOUNT.

47
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,480
>>EXACTLY, BUT HE IS ASKING FOR
ONE.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,140
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER

49
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,579
DISAGREE WITH YOU MORE, I THINK
THE MEDIA SHOULD RUB IT IN HIS

50
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,299
FACE AND I DO ENJOY IT, AND I
INTEND ON CONTINUING TO RUB IT

51
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,299
IN HIS FACE.

52
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:31,279
THE ALABAMA
SECRETARY OF STATE WAS SPEAKING

53
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:36,150
TO THE PRESS AFTER ROY MOORE
MADE THOSE STATEMENTS AND I

54
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,989
ENJOYED THIS EXCHANGE, LET'S
TAKE A LISTEN TO JOHN MERRILL.

55
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,739
>>WHAT DO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT THE CONVERSATION THAT WILL

56
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:47,950
TAKE PLACE WHEN HE ARRIVES?

57
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,559
>>I DON'T KNOW THAT THE JUDGES
COMING HERE, I'M INSPECTING

58
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:54,749
OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE MEDIA TO
COME HERE, I'M NOT VERY

59
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:58,029
COMFORTABLE IN VISITING WITH
JUDGE MOORE OR ANYBODY IN

60
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:00,019
HIS CAMPAIGN TONIGHT.

61
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,230
THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA HAVE
SPOKEN TONIGHT, THEY MADE

62
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,819
THEIR VOICE HEARD LOUD AND
CLEAR.

63
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,689
>>I LOVE THE PART WHERE HE'S
LIKE, NO, PLEASE DON'T COME

64
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,689
HERE.

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,129
>>PLEASE DON'T COME TO MY
HOUSE.

66
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,129
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS

67
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:16,099
DAUGHTERS BUT HE'S LIKE, I
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT ROY MOORE

68
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,339
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS HOUSE.

69
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,489
HE
WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE THINKS A

70
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,779
RECOUNT IS UNLIKELY AND THAT A
CHANGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS

71
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:32,579
UNLIKELY, SO DOUG JONES WILL BE
THE NEXT SENATOR FROM THE GREAT

72
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,209
STATE -- NOW I CAN SAY IT -- THE
GREAT STATE OF ALABAMA.

73
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,129
>>DOUG JONES TOOK A MOMENT TO
THANK THE BLACK COMMUNITY

74
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,870
FOR RALLYING AND SUPPORTING HIM.

75
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,540
>>IT WAS EVERY COMMUNITY.

76
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,779
I KEEP
HEARING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

77
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,650
COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE.

78
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,499
THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY,

79
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:57,010
THANK YOU!

80
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,079
>>YES. AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER,
BLACK VOTERS ACCOUNTED FOR 28 OR

81
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,029
29% OF THE ELECTORATE, A
SLIGHTLY HIGHER FIGURE THAN

82
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,779
THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION.

83
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,879
THEY ARE MOTIVATED TO SUPPORT

84
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,719
DOUG JONES, WHO CONVICTED KLAN
MEMBERS WHO MURDERED INNOCENT

85
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,720
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN ALABAMA,
AND PROBABLY MOTIVATED TO OPPOSE

86
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,710
ROY MOORE, WHO THOUGHT THE 14TH
AMENDMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY.

87
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,639
WHICH IS -- EVERY PART OF ROY
MOORE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

88
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,759
WHO SAYS

89
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,099
THAT?

90
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,150
THAT IS SO INSANE.

91
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,000
THANK
GOD THEY STOOD UP AND GOT

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
VICTORIES.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,490
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS, FIGHT, IF YOU FIGHT

94
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,780
YOU WIN.

95
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,460
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T
LOSE ENERGY AND THINK YOU CAN'T

96
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,900
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

97
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,960
IN ALABAMA
YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE, AND NOW

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,639
THAT MONSTER ROY MOORE LUCKILY
ISN'T GOING TO GO TO THE SENATE,

99
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,419
HOPEFULLY A PROSECUTOR SENDS HIM
TO JAIL BECAUSE THERE IS NO

100
00:04:54,419 --> 00:00:00,000
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON CHILD
MOLESTATION IN ALABAMA.
