with me can use their democratic right

49
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,340

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,940
well good<font color="#E5E5E5"> on him like maybe he's cool to</font>

what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have to remember and be</font>

people views go against those in

125
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,860
mainstream society and can quite often

126
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,830
be offensive I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should</font>

127
