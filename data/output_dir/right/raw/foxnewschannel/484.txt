1
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:06,525
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING.

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:07,192
WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON

3
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:07,559
TONIGHT."

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,394
THIS IS THE TENTH DAY IN A ROW

5
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:10,796
THAT WE HAVE DEVOTED A LARGE

6
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:14,399
PORTION OF THE SHOW TO BRETT

7
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:15,033
KAVANAUGH'S SUPREME COURT

8
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:15,434
NOMINATION.

9
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:16,435
WE HAVE DONE THAT BECAUSE THE

10
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:17,469
STORY MATTERS.

11
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,171
NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SUPREME

12
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:20,005
COURT ITSELF MATTERS.

13
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,406
THE WAY KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN

14
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,441
TREATED BY THE DEMOCRATS IN

15
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,775
THE SENATE AS WELL AS BY THE

16
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,078
MEDIA AND THE LEFT WING

17
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:27,145
INTEREST GROUPS WHO DO THEIR

18
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:28,614
BIDDING IN CONCERT GETS THE

19
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:29,748
MOST BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

20
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:31,250
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT

21
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,752
TO LIVE IN.

22
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:34,987
DOES EVERY AMERICAN DESERVE

23
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:35,420
DUE PROCESS?

24
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,257
ARE THE ACCUSED PRESUMED

25
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,591
INNOCENT RATHER THAN GUILTY?

26
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,059
DOES FAIRNESS STILL MATTER IN

27
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,027
THIS COUNTRY?

28
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:45,030
WELL, TO ALL OF THOSE WE

29
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,731
ANSWER YES.

30
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:47,733
THE LEFT ARGUES NO.

31
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,434
TO THEM ACQUIRING POWER

32
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:50,202
JUSTIFYING ANYTHING.

33
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:51,803
THAT IS THE REAL DEBATE HERE.

34
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:52,671
WE THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW

35
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:53,038
THAT.

36
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:54,206
AFTER THE DEVELOPMENTS AND

37
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,007
THERE ARE MANY.

38
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:58,710
AFTER YESTERDAY'S HEARING, THE

39
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,945
DEBATE MUST BE DRAWN TO A

40
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:00,279
CLOSE.

41
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,480
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WATCHING

42
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,115
WHAT KAVANAUGH SAID TO THE

43
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,382
SENATE YESTERDAY WITHOUT FEEL

44
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:04,983
PROGRESS FOUND SYMPATHY.

45
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,852
THIS IS A DEEPLY SINCERE MAN

46
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:08,186
WHO BELIEVES HIS FAMILY HAS

47
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:09,922
BEEN DESTROYED BY FALSE AND

48
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:11,323
UNSUPPORTED ALLEGATIONS.

49
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,091
MANY WEPT AS THEY WATCH HIM

50
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:13,692
SPEAK.

51
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,627
DEMOCRATS REMAINED UNMOVED.

52
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:17,496
SOME ARGUE THAT KAVANAUGH'S

53
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:18,363
ANGUISH WAS ITSELF EVIDENCE

54
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,165
THAT HE IS A MONSTER.

55
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:22,000
AS IF ONLY A SEX CRIMINAL

56
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,404
WOULD RECOIL AT BEING CALLED A

57
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:33,378
SEX CRIMINAL.

58
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:36,515
>> A CALENDAR AND A DIARY.

59
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:41,920
VERY ORGANIZED GUY TO PUT IT

60
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,021
MILDLY.

61
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,923
>> Tucker: WELL, THAT WAS

62
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:46,158
THE WRONG SOUND BITE BUT YOU

63
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,192
GET THE POINT.

64
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,760
BARBARA BOXER EXPLAINED TODAY

65
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,563
HIS ANGER ON STAGE MADE HER

66
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:52,231
THINK HE WAS CAPABLE OF

67
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:52,598
VIOLENCE.

68
00:01:52,598 --> 00:01:53,699
WOULD YOU BE ANGRY IF THEY

69
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:54,433
SAID IT ABOUT YOU?

70
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,901
NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, THE

71
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:56,969
DEMOCRATS DON'T MEAN ANY OF

72
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:57,737
THIS PERSONALLY.

73
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:58,971
THEY DON'T HATE KAVANAUGH OR

74
00:01:58,971 --> 00:01:59,839
HIS FAMILY.

75
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,207
THEY DON'T SEEK TO DESTROY

76
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:02,275
EITHER ONE.

77
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:04,810
THEY ARE JUST IRRELEVANT.

78
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,078
DEMOCRATS JUST WANT TO BE IN

79
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:06,412
CONTROL.

80
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:07,380
SO YESTERDAY THEY IMMEDIATELY

81
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,580
BEGAN STALLING FOR TIME AND

82
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,049
THEY DID THAT DEMANDING A

83
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,152
SEVENTH F.B.I. INVESTIGATION

84
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:14,020
INTO KAVANAUGH'S LIFE.

85
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,856
THE POINT IS RUN OUT THE CLOCK

86
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:17,623
ON HIS NOMINATION.

87
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:18,724
THEY CONTINUED THE TACTIC

88
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,159
TODAY AT TWO HEARINGS,

89
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,927
ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON

90
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,029
WHEN THE SENATE JUDICIARY

91
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:23,863
COMMITTEE RECONVENED.

92
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:24,697
WATCH THIS.

93
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:25,731
>> I CANNOT SIT HERE.

94
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,134
I CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN WHAT I

95
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:30,903
KNOW HISTORY WILL LOOK BACK AS

96
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:32,271
A DARK MOMENT AGAIN IN THE WAY

97
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,141
WE LOOK AT THE ANITA HILL AND

98
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:35,741
CLARENCE THOMAS HEARING.

99
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:38,177
I CAN'T PARTICIPATE AGAIN

100
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:40,212
RELEGATE OURSELVES TO WHAT I

101
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:41,447
BELIEVE IS A DARK, DARK

102
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,848
ELEMENT OF THE SOCIETY.

103
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:45,084
TO THAT, SIR, I WILL LEAVE.

104
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:46,085
>> Tucker: THAT WAS NEW

105
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,920
JERSEY SENATOR CORY BOOKER, A

106
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,523
MAN SO OILY HE QUALIFIES AS AN

107
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:51,324
ALTERNATIVE FUEL.

108
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:52,625
ALMOST NOBODY WHO KNOWS BOOKER

109
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,526
TAKES HIM SERIOUSLY.

110
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,628
BUT TODAY HE FOUND AN ALLY,

111
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:56,128
SURPRISINGLY AMONG

112
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,529
REPUBLICANS.

113
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,297
THAT WAS JEFF FLAKE OF

114
00:02:58,297 --> 00:02:58,631
ARIZONA.

115
00:02:58,631 --> 00:02:59,899
FLAKE DECLARED HE WOULD BE

116
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:01,200
VOTING FOR KAVANAUGH'S

117
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,934
NOMINATION.

118
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:05,571
THEN HE WAS CONFRONTED BY A

119
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,139
MOB OF PROTESTERS, THE YOUTH

120
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,207
WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

121
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:08,641
WATCH.

122
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:09,909
>> YOU ARE ALLOWING SOMEONE

123
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,711
WHO IS UNWILLING TO TAKE

124
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,912
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN

125
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:13,246
ACTIONS.

126
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:15,915
TO SIT IN THE HIGHEST COURT OF

127
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:16,482
THE COUNTRY.

128
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:18,718
AND TO HAVE THE ROLE OF

129
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:20,086
REPAIRING THE HARM THAT HAS

130
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:22,722
BEEN DONE IN THIS COUNTRY TO

131
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:23,656
MANY PEOPLE.

132
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:24,290
NO THANK YOU.

133
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,725
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

134
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:28,228
YOU HAVE THE POWER.

135
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,429
>> MA'AM, DO YOU WANT --

136
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:30,630
>> I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

137
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,632
DON'T TALK TO ME.

138
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:33,533
I UNDERSTAND.

139
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,268
BUT TELL ME I'M STANDING RIGHT

140
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,336
HERE IN FRONT OF YOU.

141
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,771
WHAT DO YOU HAVE -- DO YOU

142
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,342
THINK HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH?

143
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:43,109
>> Tucker: WOW!

144
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,512
THAT MAN LOOKS AFRAID AND

145
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:46,513
ASHAMED.

146
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:47,780
YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE SENATORS

147
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,548
LOOK LIKE THAT.

148
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,983
THIS KIND OF THING HAS BEEN

149
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,050
HAPPENING A LOT IN WASHINGTON.

150
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,986
I HAPPENED TO TED CRUZ WHEN HE

151
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:55,355
FOUND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY

152
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:57,991
PEOPLE AT DINNER AND LEFT THE

153
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:58,391
RESTAURANT.

154
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,059
JEFF FLAKE CRUMBLED AND

155
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,561
ANNOUNCED HE WOULD NOT APPROVE

156
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,062
THE NOMINATION WITHOUT

157
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:03,563
ADDITIONAL F.B.I.

158
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:03,997
INVESTIGATION.

159
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:04,964
DEMOCRATS CHEERED HIS CHANGE

160
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:05,865
OF HEART.

161
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,800
I APPLAUD SENATOR JEFF FLAKE'S

162
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,835
DECISION TO RISE ABOVE THE

163
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,270
PARTISAN CIRCUS ON DISPLAY IN

164
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,273
THE ENTIRE PROCESS.

165
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,541
JOE MANCHIN.

166
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,842
BUT IN WASHINGTON WHEN THEY

167
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,410
CONGRATULATE YOU ON LEAVING

168
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,012
THE PARTISAN CIRCUS, CHANCES

169
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:20,779
ARE YOU ARE NOW THE RING

170
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,485
MASTER OF THE FOR -- MASTER OF

171
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:26,686
THE CIRCUS.

172
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:27,387
JEFF FLAKE IS THAT.

173
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:28,254
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

174
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,222
IT DOESN'T MEAN A LOT.

175
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:30,623
THE F.B.I. DOES NOT WANT THE

176
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:31,224
CASE.

177
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:32,158
THERE IS NOTHING TO

178
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,626
INVESTIGATE HERE AND THEY SAID

179
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,028
THAT DEFINITIVELY ALREADY.

180
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:36,362
WEEKS AGO DIANNE FEINSTEIN

181
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:37,564
SENT THEM CHRSTINE BLASEY

182
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:38,731
FORD'S ORIGINAL LETTER AND

183
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:39,632
THAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE.

184
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:41,101
THIS IS NOT A FEDERAL CRIMINAL

185
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:41,534
INVESTIGATION.

186
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:43,636
IT CANNOT BE.

187
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:45,605
NO FEDERAL CRIME HAS BEEN

188
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:45,972
ALLEGED.

189
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,941
ONLY POLICE THE MARYLAND CAN

190
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:48,708
CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO

191
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,042
THIS.

192
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,510
THEY ARE NOT BECAUSE STRANGELY

193
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,378
CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD NEVER

194
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,079
FILED CHARGES AGAINST BRETT

195
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,347
KAVANAUGH IN THE JURISDICTION

196
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:57,450
WHERE SHE SAID IT TOOK PLACE.

197
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,451
INSTEAD THE F.B.I. WILL

198
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,921
CONDUCT WHAT IS CALLED A

199
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:01,655
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION.

200
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,290
AGENTS WILL INTERVIEW ONLY

201
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,858
THOSE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO

202
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,026
CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD'S

203
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:06,760
ORIGINAL ALLEGATION.

204
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,195
IN THIS CASE, THAT WOULD

205
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:09,362
AMOUNT TO CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD

206
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,530
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH, OF

207
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,932
COURSE, ALONG WITH THE THREE

208
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,133
PEOPLE FORD SAYS WERE PRESENT

209
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,836
WHEN SHE WAS ATTACKED IN 182.

210
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:18,772
THAT WOULD BE JUDGE, P.J.

211
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,440
SMITH AND LEYLAND KAISER.

212
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,775
THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL FIVE

213
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,276
OF THE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY

214
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:24,277
GIVEN SWORN TESTIMONY.

215
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:26,079
YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT THEY

216
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,947
HAVE SAID.

217
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:28,782
FOUR CATEGORICALLY DENIED

218
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,183
UNDER OATH FORD'S VERSION OF

219
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:30,984
THE STORY.

220
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:33,487
IF THEY DEVIATE FROM THE

221
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:34,888
PREVIOUS TESTIMONY, THEY COULD

222
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:36,823
FACE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

223
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:39,192
SO WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY LEARN

224
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,127
FROM HAVING THE F.B.I.

225
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:41,228
INTERVIEW THEM?

226
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,063
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE F.B.I.

227
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:44,197
MAKES NO JUDGMENTS IN THE

228
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:44,631
INVESTIGATION.

229
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,266
IT'S NOT ASSESSING CREDIBILITY

230
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,868
OR RENDER ANY CONCLUSION.

231
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,736
IT JUST DOES INTERVIEWS AND

232
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:52,039
SUMMARIZES THEM FOR LAWMAKERS.

233
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:53,240
THE F.B.I. NO MATTER WHAT THEY

234
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,975
TELL YOU IS NOT A TIE-BREAKER

235
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:55,776
IN THIS OR ANY OTHER

236
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:56,276
INVESTIGATION.

237
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:57,244
IT'S AN INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY

238
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:58,745
THAT WILL PROVIDE THE SENATE

239
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:01,214
WITH INFORMATION THAT SENATORS

240
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:02,249
ALREADY HAVE.

241
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:03,517
SO BRETT KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO

242
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,685
GET INTERVIEWED AGAIN.

243
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:05,986
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GET A

244
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,754
PROSTATE EXAM TO BE MORE

245
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:08,555
THOROUGHLY VETTED THAN

246
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:09,923
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN IN THE NEXT

247
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:10,490
20 YEARS.

248
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,458
THEY MAY TRY THAT, TOO.

249
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,693
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TRUTH

250
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:15,229
THIS IS A POINTLESS EXERCISE.

251
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:15,996
YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT.

252
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,197
BUT THE TRUTH IS NOT WHAT

253
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:18,498
ANYONE IS LOOKING FOR HERE AS

254
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:19,566
YOU MAY HAVE FIGURED OUT.

255
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:20,968
DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING MORE

256
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:21,835
BASELESS ALLEGATIONS WILL

257
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:23,437
EMERGE IN THE DELAY, DURING

258
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:24,738
WHICH THE F.B.I. IS

259
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,240
INVESTIGATING THINGS THAT HAVE

260
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,741
LONG BEEN INVESTIGATED.

261
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,612
PERHAPS ANOTHER REPTILIAN PORN

262
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:34,515
LAWYER WILL COME FORWARD WITH

263
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:38,385
ANOTHER CLIENT WITH FANTASIES

264
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:41,422
OF GANG RAPE OR MAYBE RITUAL

265
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:42,256
SATANIC ABUSE.

266
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:43,657
WHO KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BE?

267
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,226
WHEN THE CHARGES EMERGE, THE

268
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,493
DEMOCRATS WILL DEMAND NEW

269
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,295
PUBLIC HEARINGS ON EVERY ONE

270
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:48,862
OF THEM.

271
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:49,797
DEMOCRACY HANGS IN THE

272
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,532
BALANCE, THEY WILL TELL US.

273
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,033
MEANING THE ACCESS TO POWER

274
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,836
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

275
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,404
IT'S NOT A COMPLICATED

276
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:57,838
FORMULA.

277
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:58,873
EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNOWS

278
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:00,574
EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

279
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,510
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A POOR JEFF

280
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,244
FLAKE.

281
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,679
PEOPLE WHO KNOW FLAKE SAY HE

282
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,347
MAY BELIEVE DEMOCRATS ARE

283
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:07,448
ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

284
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,749
MAYBE HE IS AUDITIONING FOR A

285
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:09,884
NEW EMPLOYER.

286
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:11,452
HE IS LEAVING THE SENATE EARLY

287
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:12,753
NEXT YEAR.

288
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:14,555
EITHER WAY YOU HAVE TO BE AN

289
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:16,223
IDIOT TO THINK CAVING TO THIS

290
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,358
DEMAND WILL INDUCE THE

291
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,627
DEMOCRATS TO CALL OFF THE

292
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:20,361
SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST BRETT

293
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,262
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY.

294
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:21,862
THEY WON'T.

295
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:23,297
THEY WILL ACCELERATE.

296
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,231
WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

297
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,066
IT'S WORKING.

298
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,267
BUT THERE IS A COST.

299
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,436
ESPECIALLY FOR REPUBLICANS.

300
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:29,804
AT THIS POINT KAVANAUGH ISN'T

301
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:31,739
JUST A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.

302
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,507
HE IS A FOLK HERO TO MANY

303
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:34,141
PEOPLE.

304
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,777
INSPIRATION TO MILLIONS.

305
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,646
PEOPLE WHO SPENT THE LAST TWO

306
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:40,214
YEARS BEING BROWBEATEN AND

307
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:43,184
BULLIED BY THE MORAL

308
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:46,187
INFOREYOURS WERE BUOYED --

309
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:47,688
INFERIORS WERE BUOYED BY WHAT

310
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:48,322
HE SAID YESTERDAY.

311
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:50,024
THEY ARE UNFAIRLY MALIGNED

312
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,325
BECAUSE THEY IN THE WAY OF

313
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:53,127
OTHER PEOPLE GAINING POWER AND

314
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,195
HAVE BEEN COMMANDED TO SHUT UP

315
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:55,496
AND OBEY.

316
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:56,330
KAVANAUGH STOOD UP FOR THE

317
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,231
PEOPLE YESTERDAY AND HE RAISED

318
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,500
A MIDDLE FINGER TO THE

319
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,534
TORMENTERS AND THEY LOVE HIM

320
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:01,102
FOR IT.

321
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,436
KAVANAUGH IS FAR MORE POPULAR

322
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,938
WITH THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS

323
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,307
TONIGHT THAN ANY SINGLE

324
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,141
REPUBLICAN SENATOR.

325
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:09,844
HI IS MORE POPULAR THAN THE

326
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,312
SENATE AS A WHOLE.

327
00:08:11,312 --> 00:00:00,000
KAVANAUGH WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT
