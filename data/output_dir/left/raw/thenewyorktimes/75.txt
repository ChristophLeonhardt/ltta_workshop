1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,680
Coal mining isn't coming back,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,170
and it’s time to get
real about it.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,560
I'm a fifth-generation coal
miner and a ninth-generation

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,510
Appalachian from Virginia.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,029
I spent four years
in the coal industry.

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,320
The work was
dangerous and came

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,340
with a lot of long-term health
impacts.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,960
We love our coal miners.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,980
And they're not being mistreated anymore.

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,560
Miners are going back to work, folks.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,210
Those are false
promises that are only

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,600
going to line the pockets
of coal executives

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,920
while delaying the inevitable.

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,960
If Trump really wants to
help Appalachian mining

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,530
communities that support him,
lowering emissions standards

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,450
is not the way to do it.

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,270
The industry has never been
on the side of the coal miner.

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,980
The coal companies
were quick to create

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,740
a culture around coal
mining, around the hard work

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,670
and patriotic duty and
sacrifice for families.

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,910
But they did it with a total
disregard for our safety.

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,250
We’re still having to fight
for things like black lung

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,190
benefits, workman’s
compensation and disability

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,960
from injuries in the mines.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,840
You might think of Appalachia
as a very conservative place.

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,290
But in 2000, the majority of
Appalachia's coal-producing counties

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,760
voted for Al Gore.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,800
Our families used to vote
Democrat for labor rights.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,230
But economic desperation
has driven us to vote otherwise.

30
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,140
We’re defending ourselves

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,970
against liberal elite
stereotypes that

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,860
we're unintelligent deplorables.

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,050
And beautiful clean coal,

34
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,210
clean coal, really clean coal.

35
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,820
Coal cannot be clean.

36
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,250
We know that firsthand.

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,170
Acidic mine drainage is real.

38
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,670
It’s coming out of our
family spring.

39
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,650
Coal slurry impoundments are real.

40
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,680
They’re leaching into
our creeks, our rivers

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,340
and our lakes.

42
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,060
Miners don’t want to be told about
climate change.

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,740
But at some point,
we have to realize

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,680
that the environmental
impacts of the industry

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
aren’t a partisan
issue.

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
They're a matter of life and death.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,760
We don’t need short-term
revivals of an industry that

48
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,740
has always mistreated us.

49
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,879
We need long-term investments
into our communities.

50
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,170
This is the only way to give
justice to the communities

51
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,720
who have sacrificed so
much to provide the energy

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:00:00,000
and steel that has
made this nation so great.
