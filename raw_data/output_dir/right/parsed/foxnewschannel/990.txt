MAJORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE SAYS
EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON KIM
JONG-UN FOLLOWING STEPS.
NOW WE GO TO TARA MALLER.
THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Shep: THE FIRST THING THAT
HAPPENED IS WE LEARNED FROM THE
PARTIES ABOUT THE DISCUSSION IN
SINGAPORE THAT THE PRESIDENT
TOLD HIM YEAH, THE PROVOCATIVE
WAR GAMES ARE OVER.
MEANING THE DEFENSIVE DRILL
EXERCISES WON'T HAPPEN ANYMORE.
WE LEARNED THAT HE HADN'T TOLD
THE SOUTH KOREANS.
THEN WE KNEW THAT WOULD GET TO
WASHINGTON.
THEN WE KNEW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
TO START EXPLAINING, CONGRESS
EXPLAINING, WHAT IT WAS THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAD DONE.
NOW STEVE SCALISE IS APPARENTLY
DOING A LITTLE CONGRESS
EXPLAINING.
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW, DO WE,
WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?
>> WE DON'T KNOW.
>> Shep: NO ONE KNOWS BUT THE
PRESIDENT.
>> IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL IN THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
THAT YOU SEE OFFICIALS
SCRAMBLING AFTER THE FACT.
ONE OF THE TROUBLING THINGS
RELATED TO THE SUMMIT -- I WANT
TO PRAISE THE SUMMIT.
THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED, YOU
HAVE DIPLOMACY IN PLAY, THAT'S
POSITIVE.
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK IT
WAS PROBLEMATIC THAT WE DON'T
HAVE A TRUE RECORD OF WHAT
TRANSPIRED BETWEEN THE TWO
LEADERS, PARTICULARLY --
>> Shep: WE DON'T HAVE ANY
RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED.
>> NO RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED IN
THE ROOM, WHAT WAS SAID, WHAT
WAS PROMISED AND WHAT WASN'T
PROMISED.
IN THE DISCUSSIONS AFTER,
THERE'S NO OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT
OR DISCOVERY.
I JUST FIND THAT SOMEWHAT
PROBLEMATIC.
NOT JUST FROM THE --
>> Shep: SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE STRAIGHTFORWARD USUALLY.
>> I THINK I UNDERSTAND THERE
ARE REASONS YOU WANT TO KEEP
SOME DISCUSSIONS PRIVATE.
BE THERE NEEDS TO BE A REPORT
EVEN IF IT'S A SUMMARY.
PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE
LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED IS VERY
IMPRECISE IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT
BOTH SIDES SIGNED.
IT WAS VAGUE.
DIDN'T EVEN REALLY MEET THE BAR
OF PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LANGUAGE ISN'T
ALL THAT PRECISE ABOUT STOPPING
THE WAR GAMES, HALTING THE WAR
GAMES.
THEY'RE SCHEDULED TWICE A YEAR
WITH OTHER EXERCISES IN BETWEEN.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT SHOULD BE
OFF THE TABLE.
HAVING SAID THAT, THERE SHOULD
BE THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TO DO
X
X, Y AND Z BY THIS TIME FRAME
AND THEN WE'LL CHANGE AROUND THE
DRILLS.
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
THE PENTAGON WAS CAUGHT OFF
GUARD AND JAPANESE AND THE SOUTH
KOREANS.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE
SEE THE PRESIDENT WALK IT BACK
ONCE EVERYBODY SEES WHAT HAPPENS
AND WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS WILL
DO GOING FORWARD.
>> Shep: AS YOU MENTIONED, THE
PROCESS IS DIFFERENT THAN IT
USED TO BE.
IN THE WORLD YOU'RE DISCUSSING,
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD LAY OUT
SOME SORT OF VAGUE IDEAS AND
MIKE POMPEO COULD GO IN THERE
AND REALLY GET SOME DIPLOMACY
GOING AND MAYBE MAKE SOME
PROGRESS, WHICH WOULD BE THE
BEST THING IMAGINABLE.
SO NOW IT'S UP TO MIKE POMPEO.
>> IT IS AND THE HARD WORK OF
INDIVIDUALS BEHIND THE SCENES AT
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
ALL OF THESE RESOURCES NEED TO
COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF
LAYING OUT A STRUCTURED
TIMETABLE OF PHASED NEGOTIATION.
WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE HERE IS
SOMETHING THAT LAYS OUT IF WE DO
X, THAT I FOLLOW WITH Y AND VICE
VERSA OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD CONFIDENCE
AND TRUST.
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT KIM
JONG-UN SAID TO TRUMP IN THIS
MEETING.
IT MATTERS WHETHER OR NOT HIS
ACTIONS ALIGN WITH THAT AND WE
CAN VERIFY THAT.
