BAKER AND FOR MY RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES AROUND THE COUNTRY. NEIL? Neil: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, RIGHT AFTER THIS BROUHAHA JUST STARTED IN 2015, I HAD A CHANCE TO CATCH UP WITH THE BAKER IN QUESTION, JACK PHILLIPS THAT WOULD PROMPT THIS COURT DECISION TODAY. HE WAS ARGUING ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS AND MORE THAT HE JUST WANTED TO DO WHAT HE SAID THE LORD WAS TELLING HIM TO DO. TAKE A LOOK. WHEN YOU HEARD THE SUPREME COURT RULED AND TO YOUR LAWYER'S POINT, THE 5-4 DECISION IN FAVOR OF GAY MARRIAGE IS APPARENTLY DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN, HOW DID YOU FEEL? I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE COURT'S DECISION BUT STILL IT'S A DIFFERENT DECISION THAN WHAT MY CASE IS. MY CASE IS THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO FORCE ME TO VIOLATE MY PERSONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CREATE CAKE. CREATE A CAKE FOR A CEREMONY THAT I HAVE OBJECTIONS TO. Neil: LET'S SAY YOU LOSE THIS CASE ON APPEAL. WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, A HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE COMES IN AND YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM, NO DIFFERENCE. WHAT DO YOU DO? THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. I TREAT ALL OF MY CUSTOMERS THE SAME. Neil: I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU WON'T MAKE A CAKE FOR A GAY WEDDING, CORRECT? YOU WILL FOR A HETEROSEXUAL ONE? RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY WEDDING CAKES. THAT'S TAKEN A GOOD CHUNK OF MY BUSINESS AWAY. ALL RIGHT. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, AT THE TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS THE DUST UP OVER MAKING A CAKE FOR A SAME SEX COUPLE, HE JUST STOPPED, THE BAKER IN QUESTION, FROM DOING CAKES FOR ANYONE, HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES. ALL OF THAT STOPPED TODAY OR HE CAN RETURN TO MAKING CAKES FOR ANYONE TODAY, MOST LIKELY HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES. TO THE ATTORNEY THAT ARGUED THIS CASE AMONG THE WINNING TEAM BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT, JEREMY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANKS, NEIL. Neil: HOW WAS THIS DECIDED AND HOW DID TWO LIBERAL JUSTICES GO ALONG? ON WHAT GROUNDS? WELL, THE COURT BASICALLY SAID LOOK, GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T BE HOSTILE TO PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. THAT HOSTILE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY. ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS IN THE CASE AND THIS IS WHAT CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT, CERTAINLY DID OF JUSTICE KENNEDY, SAID AT ONE OF THE HEARINGS IN JACK'S CASE THAT SHE FOUND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO BE RHETORIC. JUSTICE KENNEDY ARGUED THAT. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE HOSTILE TO PEOPLE OF FAITH. THEY SHOULDN'T PUSH PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS ABOUT MARRIAGE. THAT GARNERED SEVEN VOTES IN FAVOR OF JACK PHILLIPS. I HEARD YOU QUESTION WHERE YOU ASK HIM WHAT IF YOU LOSE? SO GLAD WE DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. JACK PHILLIPS WON AND HE WON IN A WAY THAT RE-AFFIRMS THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS TARGETING PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. Neil: THEY STILL DID GO OUT OF THE WAY, THE JUSTICES, ESPECIALLY ANTHONY KENNEDY'S RULING, TO NOT INTERPRET THIS MORE BROADLY THAN WAS THE CASE. THIS WAS ISOLATED AND NOT A PRECEDENT SETTER. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT? YOU CAN'T SAY THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY SAYS IT ONLY APPLIES TO JACK PHILLIPS. THERE'S OTHER CASES THAT WILL HAVE THE FREE SPEECH ISSUE. THAT WILL RESERVE FOR ANOTHER DAY. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RULING. IT RE-AFFIRMS THE PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNMENT HOSTILITY HAS NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY. IT ALSO TALKED ABOUT UNEQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT FAVORS SOME VIEWS OVER OTHERS. THAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE, TOO. THREE COLORADO BAKERIES WERE ASKED TO CREATE CAKES OPPOSING SAME SEX MARRIAGE. THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CREATE THEM BECAUSE THEY SUPPORTED SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND THE COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, WHEN THEY RECEIVED THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SITUATION SAID YOU'RE EXONERATED. YET THEY'RE PROSECUTES YET THEY'RE PROSECUTE YET THEY'RE PROSECUTIN YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING J YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING JAC YET THEY'RE PROSECUTING JACK PHILLIPS TO THE FULLEST EXTEND OF THE LAW. HE OPPOSES SAME SEX MARRIAGE. THERE HAS TO BE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR FREE SPEECH. THAT'S THE IDEA OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THERE'S NOT JUST THE RELIGIOUS HOSTILITY THAT PLAYED A PART IN THE RULING. IT'S THE FACT THAT THE STATE OF COLORADO IS UNEVENLY APPLYING ITS LAW FAVORING SOME VIEWS, THOSE THAT SUPPORT SAME SEX MARRIAGE OR THOSE THAT OPPOSE SAME SEX MARRIAGE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS PLAYING THOSE FAVORITES IN THE FREE SPEECH CONTACT. Neil: I'M NOT SO SURE IT'S THAT BLACK AND WHITE. I KNOW IT WAS BALANCING THE RESPECT FOR SINCERE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS VERSUS PRACTICES THAT COULD TARGET PERSONS WITH FURTHER INDIGNITIES IN THE GAY COMMUNITY. SO IT'S THE EXACT SAME CASE WERE TO BE BROUGHT UP IN A SEPARATE SITUATION, IS IT A GIVEN THAT THE JUSTICES WOULD RULE IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL? THERE CAN'T BE A GIVEN BECAUSE THE COURT SAID WE RESERVE THAT ISSUE FOR ANOTHER DAY. WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THE COURT'S DECISION ISN'T AS NARROW AS SOME PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU. THERE'S PLENTY OF PRINCIPLES IN THAT DECISION THAT EXPAND FAR BEYOND JACK PHILLIPS. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T BE HOSTILE TOO PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THAT REAFFIRMATION FROM THE COURT. Neil: HOW DO WE KNOW SOME PEOPLE WON'T SEIZE ON THIS AND SAY I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A CAKE FOR A MIXED MARRIAGE COUPLE? I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A CAKE FOR, YOU KNOW A MIXED RELIGIOUS COUPLE? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THE COURT SAID RACE IS UNIQUE, IT'S DISTINCT, IT'S SPECIAL. RACE HAS NO PLACE FOR DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SOCIETY. IN THE RACE CONTEXT, THAT WON'T BE TOLERATED. THE JACK PHILLIPS CASE DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE HYPOTHETICAL CASE THAT ARISES IN THE RAISE CONTEXT. IT'S NOT LIKE WE DIDN'T FACE THAT ARGUMENT THROUGHOUT THE CASE. IT WAS IN THE OPPOSING BRIEFING, IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE COURT. THE COURT STILL RULED IN FAVOR OF JACK PHILLIPS. SO THAT ANALOGY DIDN'T CARRY TODAY AND SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE RACE IS DIFFERENT. IT'S DISTINCT. IT'S UNIQUE. OUR SOCIETY HISTORICALLY AN CONSTITUTIONALLY WANTS TO ERADICATE RACE DISCRIMINATION IS A SPECIAL THING THAT IS PRESERVED FOR THAT ISSUE. JACK PHILLIPS WINNING HIS CASE IS NOT GOING TO UPSET THAT AT ALL AND SHOULDN'T. Neil: HAS MR. PHILLIPS TOLD YOU WHAT HE INTENDS TO DO? HE STOPPED MAKING CAKES PERIOD, HOME SEXUAL OR HETEROSEXUAL. WHETHER HE WOULD GET BACK IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING CAKES FOR THE HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE? JACK NEEDS TO GET BACK IN THE WEDDING CAKE INDUSTRY. WHEN THIS RULING CAME DOWN FROM THE COMMISSION, HE HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM THE WEDDING CAKE INDUSTRY. THAT WAS 40% OF HIS BUSINESS. HE HAS SUFFERED FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. THE TOLL THIS HAS TAKEN ON HIS FAMILY, THE DEATH THREATS, HE'S WIFE. HE'S TOLD ME STORY ABOUT HOW HIS WIFE COUNTS BRING HERSELF TO COME TO THE SHOP BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID FOR HER LIFE. SO TO HAVE HIS SITUATION VINDICATED BY THE COURT IS SO RELIEVING TO JACK. HE WILL GET BACK IN THE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE TO EVALUATE THIS DECISION AND ADVISE HIM ON THE BEST APPROACH TO DO THAT. WE'RE CONSIDERING ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS RIGHT NOW. JACK HAS EVERY INTENTION OF
