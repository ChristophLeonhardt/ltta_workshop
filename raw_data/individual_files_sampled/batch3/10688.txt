but Russia's not alone in demanding answers after a number of online activists who cast doubt over the West's narrative are being called Kremlin controlled now two people in particular have been singled out in claims that they're not even real people but rather automated accounts run by the Russian government something that's become known as a Russian bot yeah according to the UK government's analysis their accounts grew in popularity after skeptical posts on the Salisbury poison attack and for their views on the chemical attack in Syria being falsified now one man accused of being a bot spoke out on UK TV they are singling out or attack anyone who calls out the UK government lies on what has been happening recently alright that's Ian a political activist who often posts up anti Western views on Twitter he says accusations that he's a Russian bot are total of fabrication here's the other count that's called the eye of the British authorities it belongs to an Australian blogger of Syrian descent now in the UK government accused her of being a Russian bot over her posts on the scribbled case her response was that she is indeed human Meryem says Lee joins us live now Meryem good to see you well you look real to me you sure you're not a Russian bot last time I checked I'm a real human being you know the British government if they can't even confirm that I'm not an automaton how can we believe anything they have to say about the evidence they have poor scruple and serious chemical attacks the UK government argues that one reason to doubt use being a real activist is that the number of posts that you wrote or reposted more than 2,000 tweets in just 12 days and that around 200 posts a day where did you find the time to do all that how can you explain that large number well I I can explain it because the number is in fact false I checked my analytics and I've only posted 900 tweets in 30 days that number comes from the Atlantic Council's DFR lab in particular a man called Ben Nemo I mean he's obviously been fudging these numbers because that's not my analytics show and perhaps he's fudged them in order to insinuate that I'm ultimately you know and this Atlantic Council it's not a neutral organization it's actually funded by the Syria campaign which is an organization which is behind the white helmets group and of course this organization has a vested interest in making sure that anyone who exposes the fact that the white helmets are connected to al-qaeda are attacked and of course their attack dogs have been the Atlantic Council and the TFR lab and this guy Nemo so another interesting thing about the CFR lab is it's one of the other members of it which has only ten members and one of the other new members is Eliot Higgins and Eliot Higgins in the past you know he has a reason to have a vendetta against me because I exposed the fact that his chemistry knowledge wasn't so great in his analysis in the chemical attack in 2013 I happened to be a chemist by training and as a result of me exposing this he had one of his associates Dan Quezada write an email to my University accusing me of experimenting with sarin I mean this is the DFR lab we're dealing with they're fudging numbers they have personal vendettas they have no credibility and these are the people that Theresa May is using as evidence to suggest that I'm automated if there are certain things that you're tweeting there are raising a flag for people who are then sort of accusing you of being a Russian but do you expect more activists to be treated that way for expressing views that if someone's comes out with something pro-russian that therefore you've been bought and you're now an algorithm rather than a human well actually as a matter of fact it wasn't just me and it wasn't just Ian who you just had recorded from Sky News it was actually a coordinated attack upon against a bunch of academics activists including Vanessa Billy Tim is a as a professor as well anyone who is basically coming up against the mainstream media lies and the UK government lies the lies that they are using to start wars overseas and to basically intimidate Russia United Nations is particularly the war in Syria and the chemical attack bogus claims that the UK government are making the same as the dodgy this does here they used in the Iraq war and you know the interesting thing is that these attacks all happen within the frame of two days you had the BBC coming out against Vanessa Billy The Sunday Times coming out against these academics so it's clearly a smear campaign to try to intimidate people into silence and to try to smear anti-war activists as somewhat of a biased voice you know related to Russia somehow yeah and as well as apart from this have you felt any other pressure from any government agencies over what you're posting online not yet I have had the media attacked me multiple times in the past but I haven't had any direct government intervention into what I'm doing yet but I think that unfortunately these are dangerous times these are times of war we're going heading closer to perhaps worse than what the Cold War was so I expect things to get worse and I've seen the censorship I mean I have been shut down my Facebook account has been shut down they've tried to shut down my YouTube account so I'm not sure how long I'm gonna be staying online but I'm gonna continue as long as I can yeah and they're blogging to your business we can confirm you are human you're not CGI definitely not a Russian boss okay Maura Mosely thanks for staying up I know it's late where you are in Australia but I really appreciate you talking to us on RT thanks for having you
