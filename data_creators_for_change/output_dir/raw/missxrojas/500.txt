to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue the trend of not actually</font>

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,959
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that i say i'm</font>

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,040
going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in my last video</font>

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,330
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to actually talk about</font>

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">mockingjay i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this</font>

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,090
weird state of mind I'm in right now I

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,700
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm disagreeing with everyone</font>

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,710
especially when it comes to books<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,230
films and television shows and I feel

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,539
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just being contrary for the</font>

11
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,710
sake of it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether it's</font>

12
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone else or it's me it's more</font>

13
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,519
likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> than it's me but we'll see so</font>

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,350
Mockingjay is this book Whitey's on

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,849
Collins normally I'd have the orange

16
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,060
color because I'm in America you and we

17
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,260
have the blue cover which is quite nice

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,520
and i have to say that i was quite

19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,649
disappointed didn't love the second one

20
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,780
to be honest Catching Fire found at the

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,820
first two thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rick we're just dry</font>

22
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,710
and boring in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the haight sailors and</font>

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,390
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably aim to get shop for it but</font>

24
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,280
reminded me of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I really hated</font>

25
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,079
about the twilight series<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think also</font>

26
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,550
wasn't really sure who our<font color="#E5E5E5"> characters</font>

27
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,190
were and I just I didn't enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I love</font>

28
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,960
the first book I was really about it I

29
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,760
forced everyone to read it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> book sure</font>

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,219
my workout it's one of the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> books i</font>

31
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,980
pull out if the 13 year old girl for

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,570
example comes up and says I really like

33
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,820
exciting books whatever you got back to

34
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,709
mockingjay I didn't like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all</font>

35
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,990
I'm not the world's biggest fan of

36
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,299
first-person narration it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> taste</font>

37
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing I just I don't tend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like it's</font>

38
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,390
in the books in I do like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

39
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,970
first person they deserve like a Medal

40
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,650
of Honor or something because they've

41
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,229
gotten me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore that that a glitch</font>

42
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I don't really like how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

43
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">first third person and for some reason I</font>

44
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,820
felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the narration of this book</font>

45
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,950
intruded a lot more I feel like there

46
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">were some parts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it for example when</font>

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,380
she says my name is Katniss Everdeen why

48
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,420
am I not dead I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be dead I just</font>

49
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,579
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like that's what she</font>

50
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,740
actually felt I felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this which is</font>

51
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,210
words on a page<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I just kind of read</font>

52
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">season was like yeah whatever on board</font>

53
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,689
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> just jump right to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

54
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,130
the book I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it was a cop out</font>

55
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,259
and I know that other people didn't feel

56
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,369
like this because I have friends who

57
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,720
will cry I have friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,850
incredibly touched by it like you can

59
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,140
watch my friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katie's video for</font>

60
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,659
example to me it but rushed it veer back

61
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,939
into catching fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it veered back</font>

62
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,250
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of romantic choice and</font>

63
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,840
resolution being the center of the plot

64
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that doesn't interest me I don't</font>

65
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,500
read these books because I want romantic

66
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,240
fiction to me it shouldn't be the

67
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,250
priority but again that's just my taste

68
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,449
the way I'm reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

69
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,038
when I got really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited which was when</font>

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">pizza came back and he was horrible to</font>

71
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,990
Katniss I loved that I don't know why I

72
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just appeals every</font>

73
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,340
self-loathing Adam and every person's

74
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,290
body somewhere having a confirmation

75
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the protagonist isn't perfect I</font>

76
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,770
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always great but then I got</font>

77
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,959
disappointed when all of a sudden Peter

78
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,970
came over all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like sake and</font>

79
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,740
boring I just wasn't interested anymore

80
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,570
and then you get about a sentence on

81
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,790
white hat is dis mrs. Gale and realized

82
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she could never be with him but</font>

83
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,300
anything is fair to the character of

84
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">girl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who I was most interested in</font>

85
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,959
actually feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like he was just some</font>

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,880
thrown by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wayside it wasn't so much</font>

87
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,800
that that made me know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katniss it</font>

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,180
was more that it made me nor do the

89
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,280
writing which I know he sounds like a

90
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,630
really arrogant mean to say because I

91
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,830
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I could ever write a series</font>

92
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,930
that has had as much success in touch as

93
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,550
many lives as the hunger games series

94
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,530
has I've increasingly found myself

95
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,080
frustrated with every part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the book</font>

96
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,970
and with the plot I only feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terror</font>

97
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,650
when Captain I've found the roses from

98
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,360
presidents now I didn't feel any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

99
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,590
and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with me</font>

100
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,480
now I've started to class again so it's

101
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,390
back to meeting Paradise Lost and books

102
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,400
about critical race<font color="#CCCCCC"> theory reading the</font>

103
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">iliad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just watched hailey do</font>

104
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,630
Hoover's recent video and you know if

105
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,980
you watch us for a while or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

106
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,780
look at my twitter unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> massive</font>

107
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,209
crush on the energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> either but her most</font>

108
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,760
recent video really reminds me of this

109
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,380
comics for a base to read call the

110
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skulls so you should check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

111
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,810
you shouldn't watch a video go if you

112
00:03:33,810 --> 00:00:00,000
will have a lovely<font color="#E5E5E5"> evening goodbye</font>
