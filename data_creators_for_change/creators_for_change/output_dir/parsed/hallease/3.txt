- Hi, I'm Hallease Beast.
I'm a digital storyteller
and video producer.
- Hi I'm Mr. Hallease.
I got 99 problems, but
a podcast ain't one.
That's was bad.
And I'm a nurse.
Wow, okay.
And this is,
this is the Beast Cast your
favorite aunt and uncle
talking about all things
married and things
like such as what's our intro?
And things like such as.
- I forget.
- We'll figure it out.
- Roll intro music.
(upbeat electronic music)
- Alright so
today's episode we're
talking about conflict.
- Yes, I think this stems from me
looking and listening
to some of the podcasts
and thinking that like
we're not coming at this
from like a place of expertise
only experience
and that we are not the defacto experts.
So take everything that we
tell you with a grain of salt.
And also, like any other relationships
we
have issues.
We present not even intentionally but
we present a certain level of relationship
and interaction between each other,
but even we
experience conflict.
- Yeah.
I think something I don't ever want people
to think is that we've got it figured out.
We're a well oiled.
We've found a common ground for sure.
But we still definitely have issues.
We don't want you all to ever listen/watch
and think oh they just always
got it together #goals.
And it's like no.
We definitely still have struggles.
For example,
today.
And I'll let you actually tell it.
Cause I'm still working trough how I feel.
So, yeah.
- So I was acting in
typical Mr. Hallease fashion
which is a little bit annoying.
I will admit.
If I was friends with
myself I'd probably only
spend like one day a week
with some exposure.
- You're so hard on yourself.
- I mean I'm, whatever.
So woke up in the morning.
We had discussed whether
or not we were going to get
up early today.
Because if it's later
in the day I get sleepy
and I need more caffeine.
And I'm not as coherent in the podcast.
So we got up relatively
early today actually.
But I went to let the dog out
and then when I came back
you were on your phone
and I thought you were just on your phone
but you were looking at the Will Smith
and Jada Pinkett Smith Red Table podcast.
- Yes, I was trying to
pull selects from it
for a podcast episode for us.
I did not realize she was doing that.
Second, I did not realize that the capture
app or software whatever you were using
on your phone picks up
whatever is on the mic.
- Not just whatever is
playing on the phone,
the environment.
- Right.
So, and I didn't know that.
So I came over and just
did like a normal yawn
and she didn't snap but she said,
I forget what you even said.
- I was like, can you not.
- Yeah, can you not right now.
And then like went back to your phone
and I was like okay.
I'm just.
First off you do loud
yawns all the time too.
Frequently.
It was like okay.
Not sure how I feel about
that but I feel a certain
type of way.
Whatever we're just.
Got dressed, did all this stuff.
Went to breakfast.
We're not plugging the restaurant.
- No.
- Yeah, sponsor us first.
Mystery restaurant.
Figure it out.
So we get to the restaurant.
And we sit down.
Man I can't even remember the second part
of this but.
- Oh we sit down.
And I was like, oh okay what
episodes are we doing today?
- And then I was just kind of like well,
no you said I guess we're
doing the Jada Pinkett Smith
or whatever Red Table thing.
It's like we should take notes.
And you were getting ready
to take notes on your phone
and I said, oh the time for
taking notes was yesterday
or last night.
Cause I wanted to come home
have a drink,
and then make notes on my computer.
But I got lazy.
And so I was like oh the
time for making notes
the artistic mindset it's gone.
It's gone for me.
So I don't know if I can do it.
And then your response was.
- Why can't we just take notes now?
While we're waiting for the food.
- But with a tone.
It's like.
It's like one of those tones
that is only audible either to dogs
or to like that's it's
annoying to like teenagers.
Like only teenagers can hear.
You know.
Where it's like oh, what?
Why can't we take notes now.
You know.
Even that's a bad like reenactment but.
So I was like okay you're right.
We can take notes.
We started taking notes and some stuff
and I started feeling
a certain type of way
and then knowing we we're
going to be in front
of the camera making a podcast.
I'm just gonna admit it.
I cannot hide things
like hide my emotions.
No.
No.
They just come tumbling out,
just diarrhea of the mouth.
And so I'm not gonna be all
butthurt in front of the camera
leaning back away from the mic
it's like,
yeah.
Yeah.
What does it mean to be in a relationship?
Just having.
Having like an attitude about it.
So I brought it up at breakfast.
- You did.
- And said, I feel like
there is a type of.
- You said, I feel like
there's an abrasion.
- In the relationship.
Not in the relationship but just like
in the reactions that
we're having right now.
- Yeah.
- And you said oh really?
- And I was like oh really?
- And I said yes.
- I don't feel the abrasions.
But if you say there is abrasions
then okay.
- Feel like someone is taking
a little bit of sandpaper
and just going right across the eyelids,
It's not painful but it's
like it's not pleasant.
- Yeah.
- So we talked about that.
- Yes.
- And we figured out
as I look up on my phone.
Pay no attention to the man
looking at his phone.
- We figured out a few things.
- So the first immediate
thing that you mentioned
was that you felt
like you were in work mode.
And so that's another aside.
Because there is Hallease.
There is like beautiful strong willed
even normal Hallease is strong willed.
- Yes.
- Intelligent.
Loving.
Wife, friend, whatever.
Like she's all of these things right?
When she goes on set,
or she knows that she's gonna do something
she is of a single
mind.
She has like laser like
focus and she does not deal
with your garbage.
She does not deal with anybody's garbage.
She is solely focused
again,
on the job and the task at hand.
- Yeah.
Which makes me good at my job but.
- No, that just makes
you good at your job.
- Yeah.
- Like I've been on set with you
ad you're like, stop messing around
because we need to get the job done.
And it's like oh okay.
And then I get back into
we're not husband and wife right now.
We're just like,
we're doing the thing.
And then we can peel back the layer
and be husband and wife afterwards.
That's what you mentioned.
- I did mention that yeah.
- And I didn't know
that
this whole podcast thing
was like
it had manifested into work.
To me it was more like oh.
We're just shooting this little thing.
It's coming up on your channel.
Excuse me.
And it's going to these
other platforms and stuff,
as a podcast.
But I didn't know it was a thing.
- What did you think we were doing though?
- I just didn't know that it was work.
This is not really work.
To me.
- Right.
Yeah I guess to you.
For me it's not work.
But it is
and this ties back into I feel like
how I'm perceived or how
being in this industry
is perceived by even those closest to me
where it is like,
oh it just seems like you're
just shooting this shit
and you just kind of.
- Are we cursing in the podcast?
- I don't know.
- Maybe we're not.
I don't know.
But it seems like you're
just kind of hanging out
and then you kind of make up a podcast.
And it's like no.
It takes things.
It takes thought.
It takes effort.
I'm very focused on quality,
always as well.
So we're.
So yeah we're hanging out.
We're shooting.
We're just kind of like,
you know recording conversations
we would have anyway.
But, my name is on it so
there has to be
polished.
I don't get the
I don't get the privilege of just
throwing something out there.
- You also mentioned
all the analytics
and the data and the numbers and like
looking at subscribers and
all this other stuff like.
That's adding on to it too.
The pressure of.
- Yeah.
- One ,the quality.
But making sure that
we're putting out content
that people are actually gonna digest.
- But then also balancing that too
with a level of authenticity
that I don't want to ever lose
for the sake of numbers.
So, you know.
I like doing this because.
I like having these conversations with you
with the podcast because this
is authentic to me of like.
If people want to see you more,
this is the way that I
would want to frame them
to see you.
Because it's a very real version of you
rather than me just like
look at my beige bag.
On the channel and it's like that's not.
- I'm so white skinned too.
- Yeah.
That's not what I'm trying to do.
You know, so.
That's the other thing.

and funding this channel.
If the spirit moves you
check that out.
- Yeah.
- Back to the Beast Cast.
- That's a weird aside.
- It is a weird aside.
- We're just a weird aside
to like some of the comments
where people like oh
are we not acknowledging those?
- Oh yeah.
Like some of the comments
we'll get on the videos,
where we're both in them and they're like,
I don't understand why he's with her
cause she's so dark skinned,
it's very like colorism based.
And it's like oh.
- Well, first off.
Like I didn't realize that
I come off as so light
in pigmentation on the camera.
But it's like.
- It's because you're
in juxtaposition to me.
- It's like.
- I'm beautifully melaninated.
You know what I'm saying.
- And there is nothing
wrong with being white
but it's like I am not white.
I'm dark.
I'm a light mocha.
You're pretty fair love.
Coming from
me.
- I run outside in the sun
shirtless to gain as much,
just drink up as much of the sun as I can.
- And you do.
Again, it's the direct contrast.
I mean if you were out
in the world by yourself,
sure.
- It's just weird how like
how much people.
- Fixate on it?
- Well they just fixate on different
like facets of it.
It's like oh you're light enough.
- Yeah, a lot of it is
just like self hate.
Cause usually the women that
I see that say those comments
are like oh I can't believe he's with her
and it's like the tone
of it is very much like,
oh yeah it's cause I'm dark.
You know.
For me those comments usually hurt more
than some white person
dropping in and dropping
the n bomb and then peacing out you know.
Because to me,
they don't hurt because they
actually hurt my feelings
they hurt because I know it's coming from
a place of like they
don't love themselves.
Like they've had so much time in people
their cultures surrounding saying.
You're not beautiful
because you're darker.
You're not deserving of
a good partner because
you're darker.
That when I see those comments
I can see like dang.
Whether you're light skinned,
dark skinned whatever you are.
They're just projecting that.
- Yeah.
- Unto me.
Makes me sad.
- You had all that on your mind and then
in addition to that.
- Yes.
- There was also this thing
that I innocuously brought up
and didn't know that it
was gonna bother you.
- Yeah.
- Which was.
- Yeah.
- This gig that a co-worker had
like tagged me on Facebook,
which I never get on Facebook anyway.
But it was just like a photography gig
for a race that's coming up.
It's the American Heart
Association Heart Walk.
It's nationwide and stuff.
You should support it.
And I said oh okay maybe.
She tagged me because I assumed.
- To go running.
- Cause I already signed up.
- Oh okay.
- Sorry hit the mic.
But to see if you wanted to shoot it.
- Ah yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I didn't realize
that that brought.
- That brings it's own level of,
frustration if you will
because.
- And it seemed like
I was projecting stuff
which I wasn't.
- Right.
So in the past
when you've brought up things like that
it was usually because
I think there was just
a lack of understanding
of the work ethic that I was putting in.
The focus I was putting into
whether it be,
usually just like the
channel specifically.
Because you're not quite seeing,
again, and this is
another thing that people
have talked about like,
oh, well you've got the
support of a spouse so
it's not that hard for
you to succeed at this
YouTube thing because you've got support.
And it's like that's true to a degree.
That is very much true.
But people also have to remember
it's not just my life.
Like if I fail,
it's not just me that's failing.
- And all of this is tying together
with anyway.
- Yeah.
So if I fail it's not
just me that's failing.
I'm letting someone else's life down too.
I would have gone freelance
not even freelance.
I would've done YouTube full-time
a lot sooner
if it was just me.
If I knew that I was
only letting myself down
if I didn't make it.
But I waited a lot longer
because I knew it wasn't just my life
I was affecting if I did that.
- Right.
- And so, yeah you sending me
hey here is a gig,
it's like, one I understand
where it's coming from.
But at the same time
I know that I can feel that
call it divine if you will
that I need to focus on this.
All the time.
And nothing else.
And I know for other creatives
that are probably watching or listening
it can be very disheartening
when your family or your friends
don't quite understand that focus.
And why that focus is necessary.
And they kind of project on to you
this thing of like,
well,
do this safe alternative that
gets you temporary gains.
You know so.
I was all of that was in my mind too
when you sent that.
- Well to give more concrete context.
- Ah okay.
Yeah I'm speaking very abstractly I guess.
- Right.
In the past I was concerned about money
because there is,
if you've been listening
to some of the podcasts
or you know what we've been
going through as far as
financial and housing
and all this other stuff
I just, I get a neurosis
and it's again like a pearl.
My Brian just slowly
starts building and adding
more thoughts to it and like oh my God
what if we did this and this and that
and then yes.
So I just think like,
oh my God we need money.
And so I'll suggest oh you know.
Like maybe you could do this
or maybe you could do this
or maybe I can go and earn more money or
something,
So I've mentioned stuff like that
and that was again
a point of contention
between the two of us
a little bit.
Ans I've stopped doing that.
And I am not
or I've at least tried to stop doing it.
And so this one thing I just thought oh.
Well they do need pictures
at the Heart Walk.
At this event.
She has a camera.
- And I'm always bringing my camera
with me anywhere anyways.
So it's like.
After you explained yourself I was like.
Oh yeah, that does make sense.
I would have taken photos anyway.
- But I didn't understand
that it was gonna have that effect on you.
- Right.
Yeah.
- Anyway.
So I had breakfast.
I said oh,
well that makes sense.
And then I was also thankful
that we were able to
talk about it.
- Yeah.
- And again, the difference
between the two of us
and you mentioned this at breakfast.
- So something for me
that I'm still working through
and trying to get better
about doing is
I'll let things slide a lot
that I should actually just
bring up right at the time.
So much so that eventually,
like I excuse, I recuse myself
a lot from situations.
Even when we were dating I'm
embarrassed to do this to you,
like we'd get into a bit of a tiff
and I would literally leave the apartment.
And like go get a donut or something.
- I remember that
- I would make, what do you call it?
A French exit.
Just leave.
Juts bounce.
Which is not good when
you're trying to communicate
effectively with a partner.
Whereas Mr. Hallease
actually on the other hand
is not like that.
He immediately, when he feels
that there has been a rift
or the shift, a change
in like the equilibrium
of the relationship that is a good one,
he immediately brings it up.
So much so that sometimes it's stuff that,
the stuff that you were
bringing up this stuff
and to me I didn't even
think anything of it.
- Right.
- I was just kind of like.
I just need you to be quiet
so I can record this thing.
Or I just want to take notes
because I want to always
put out the best product I can put out.
And thinking oh,
last night was the time to take notes.
And this morning isn't is like,
I mean you're right,
ideally we would do it last night,
but nothing is ideal.
And we're waiting for food so let's like,
do what we can now.
- Right.
- You know.
And so I'm just gonna
not bring anything up
until it builds up so
bad that I just blow up
at somebody.
That's how I roll.
Whereas Mr. Hallease just
brings it up immediately.
He squashes it before
it can ever be a thing.
- Well no, so that's not true.
I'll do the same thing
of just blowing stuff off
if it's jut like a little minor annoyance,
but if in my brain if it feels so big
that it comes to the
forefront of my thoughts
and I can't push anything
else in front of it,
and this happens at work.
like I'll try to do work,
but I keep thinking about that
then it's like you've done before.
There is no point to working.
Like I need to address this.
- Yeah.
- Otherwise it's gonna take
up the entirety of my day
and I will not be constructive.
- Right.
But I guess for me the level,
like the way we gauge those perspectives
is very different.
So like I said, I didn't
anything I was doing
was that crazy.
But then he brought it up,
so I was like oh.
And we know enough about
each other where it's like
oh you brought it up so
obviously it is something.
- Well I mean it's,
if you watch a series,
we watch Bob's Burgers all the time
on Hulu, sponsor us Hulu.
We can spout lines.
We know which episode is which.
So when you see something
or you've read a book enough
then if there is a small change
so let's say like I'm
watching a YouTube video
of Bob's Burgers or something
and like someone had done an edit
and I know that's off.
You just recognize it.
And it's not to say that we're
like in a rut or anything,
but it's like if I were to know that
there was something wrong with anybody
it would be you.
I don't have that some
emotional intelligence
that you do.
But yeah if I should know
that something is wrong
I should know that
something is wrong with you.
- I will notice,
actually this is a prime
example, last night,
last night you were working out
negotiating some stuff,
right?
Was it last night?
The night before.
Night before you were working
out and negotiation some stuff
and you brought your laptop into,
here for me to look at
read it and critique right?
And so, I remember as I was critiquing it
I started using language
that I could tell offended
you, a little bit.
Just in the way your tone shifted.
- Hm hm.
- And I noticed that
and I just pulled back.
Right?
I said it again but I
tweaked the language.
- Softened it a little bit.
- Softened it a Little bit, yes.
- At least, you softened it enough
but again it's like,
I know that you're not
saying it to hurt me.
- Right.
like the two things that
you did this morning
I know that you're not doing them
with malicious intent.
- Yeah, I'm not trying to
make you feel terrible.
- Right.
So I just know that there
must be something else
that's working behind that.
So with the comments that you made with me
negotiation stuff,
I knew you were trying to make a point
and so I was trying to see it
from a different perspective
and then once I re-read it
having heard what you said
I was like oh yeah that's.
We can just delete this whole thing.
- Right.
Yeah, but it's like, it takes
it takes a certain level of like
almost I guess trust in the other person.
- Yeah.
- Cause I still like,
now that, once you made me sit
there and think about it
at breakfast I was like yeah I guess,
what's bothering me is this.
Or this is just a frame
of mind that I get in
when this is happening.
Or when someone mentions this.
And then I project a frustration
on to you
sorry about that.
- People's emotions are like an egg right?
So like in a marriage
you have an egg with each
other's like emotions.
Like essentially like,
so it's very,
like an egg is strong right?
- Ish.
- Well it can take some abuse,
but
knowing
what to do in certain situations.
If I were to grab the egg and pick it up
and hold it,
I'm using just enough force
to move the egg around
and get it to where I want it to be
to manipulate it.
But if I were to grab it and
throw it against the wall
- Right.
- Or like grab it and crush it.
- Yeah.
- It's like, you can
you just need to know
what to do with your partner
in certain situations.
And that takes time.
- You also, you have to
grant yourself some patience.
Like grant yourself
some grace and patience.
And then also grant your partner that too.
So, something I appreciate about you
is that now I've gotten to the point
where when you do pull me aside,
and it's like something is wrong,
even if I don't think something is
I hear you out because
it's more about
understanding my own
ish if you will.
And realizing that oh he
can see something in me
that I'm not seeing,
that's problematic.
And should be addressed.
Because again it's kind of
like what we talked about
in the last episode
with like you going home to your parents
and then me saying no you
need to deal with this now.
Cause then you come home
cause we come back and what you bring back
into the relationship
is toxic.
Right.
And I don't want to be around it.
So for you, that's kind of like
what you were doing this morning.
I don't know what's going on with you
but something is happening
and you're being toxic right now.
- But I also know that the podcast.
So you have made it
clear that the podcasts
were important to you.
- Yeah.
- Right, like they don't
directly influence me
but I know the podcast
are important to you.
And so if I were to carry this
this burden, this emotional like baggage
all throughout the podcast,
so it's going to affect the podcast one.
- Right.
- Secondly, it's going to
put me in a really bad mood.
- Yeah.
- And thirdly like,
the whole day is gonna be gone.
- Yeah.
- Concerning A and B or one and two.
- Yeah, yeah.
- So I just knew that it
just needed to be addressed,
so I can get in a better mindset.
And be better for these podcasts.
- That's true.
Maybe it comes down to
there is a certain
level of not selfishness
but like set yourself up to succeed.
If you know you're gonna
be a certain type of way
with your partner set it
up so you're not a certain
type of way with your partner.
You know, take what you need.
And I think it gets easier to come at.
I gets easier to come at
into situations of conflict
from a loving place.
- Right.
- As you spend more time together.
- That's this episode I guess.
- We are not perfect.
- We are not perfect.
- Stuff happens.
- Whoo.
We'd be working through
conflicts just like
the rest of y'all.
- Yeah, I mean.
We're not trying to be butterfly farts
and unicorns giggles.
- Do butterflies fart?
- I think it's unicorn
farts and butterfly giggles
is what I've said, but anyway.
- Do butterflies giggle or fart?
I'll Google that later.
- They might.
Anyway, we're not trying to present
like the Instagram
life right?
Where you're curating every little thing.
- No we ain't gonna do that.
- That you put in front of the camera
or the mic or whatever.
- That ain't what this is.
- But we do love each other.
- We do.
- Sometimes.
- I like looking in the left direction.
Looking at you to the right
of me was just kind of weird.
- Really?
- So this should be the way we're set up.
- And also I feel more comfortable.
- Okay.
- If this is your strong side.
- This our cage.
- Ahh.
- I am comfortable in the cage.
This is my den.
- Alright.
- That's how you train a dog.
