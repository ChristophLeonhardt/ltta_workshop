an actress calls for Trump's assassination 94 year old actress Carol cook has joked about the assassination of Trump telling a TMZ interviewer where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him she was of course referencing the American actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater which means this joke from Carroll leaves a particularly nasty taste in the mouth considering she's an actress an actress calling on historic actor to assassinate the president this is a normal political discourse how can tolerance and compassionate people talk and behave like this I mean back when JFK was assassinated it didn't matter whether you were a Democrat or Republican the whole country mourned people turned on their television sets and mourned with their families and people came out in huge numbers to pay respects to him do you think that would happen today nope I don't think so a significant chunk of the country would be jubilant and celebrating this Kooks comments about Trump came as a response to a Broadway show that was recently interrupted by someone holding a trump 20:20 sign as an artist I do think that's unnecessary and disrespectful I don't think Trump supporters need to be rude we need to be civilized and decent and interrupting someone's show is not something I would endorse if somebody interrupted one of my shows I would be furious and rightfully so we should be like pence was at the Hamilton show polite and gracious even when getting attacked we don't need to give the left any help looking ridiculous they can do that all by themselves Cook was questioned about her comments and asked so we need to kill President Trump and she said why not she said why not so she went from saying something she could technically brush off as a joke to saying simply that she would like to see the president killed and then asked will that get me in trouble well maybe it will and I think it should the Secret Service are aware of her comment but who knows if anything will happen cook even asked will this get me on the enemies list my god I hope so just keep me out of jail or maybe not well in all honesty Carol I suspect you'll be just fine the left gets away with practically anything these days no matter how disgraceful or even unlawful if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
