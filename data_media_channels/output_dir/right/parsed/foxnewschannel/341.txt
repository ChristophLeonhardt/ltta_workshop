NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE,
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS PREPARING
FOR HIS FIRST WEEK ON THE JOB.
HOUSE DEMOCRATS SAY THEY ARE
NOT FINISHED YET.
DONALD TRUMP JR. WARNING IN A
TWEET, QUOTE - TRUMP
SUPPORTERS, YOU BETTER BELIEVE
THE DEMOCRATS WILL DO
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO
IMPEACH KAVANAUGH FROM SUPREME
COURT IF THEY TAKE CONTROL OF
CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER.
YESTERDAY, THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON
THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
VOWED TO INVESTIGATE KAVANAUGH
IF DEMOCRATS WIN CONTROL OF THE
HOUSE.
COUNCILMAN JERRY AND -- TELLING
YOUR TIME THIS.
QUOTE WILL NEED TO DO SOMETHING
TO PROVIDE CHECK AND BALANCE TO
PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW AND TO
PROTECT THE LEGITIMACY ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT
INSTITUTIONS.
IN A SPLIT INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW,
ROY BLUNT, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE
SENATE REPUBLICAN OF CONFERENCE
.
GOOD TO SEE THIS MORNING THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, MARIA.
MARIA: DO YOU AGREE THAT THE
FIGHT IS NOT OVER YET?
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHERE THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN WITH FROM
DAY ONE.
SENATOR SCHUMER SAID HE WOULD
DO ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP
BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM GOING ON
THE COURT.THEY ARE MAKING A
BIG MISTAKE.
HOLDING THIS INFORMATION,
ROLLING IT OUT IN THE MOST
UNFAIR WAY TO EVERYBODY
INVOLVED AFTER THEY HAVE HAD IT
FOR MONTHS.
NOT TALKING ABOUT IF WE GET IN
CHARGE WE WILL LOOK AT THIS IN
SOME OTHER WAY.
FRANKLY WHAT THEY'VE MANAGED TO
DO IS LEGITIMIZE THE REPUBLICAN
BASE IN A WAY THAT USUALLY THE
PARTY JUST WON A PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, IS NOT ENERGIZED IN
THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE.
BUT THE WAY REALLY CONTINUED TO
DO IS THIS UNFAIR, REALLY
TOTALLY UNREALISTIC BEHAVIOR OF
GUILTY ON UNTIL PROVEN
INNOCENT.
WHAT WE CAN DO TO STOP
POLITICAL OPPONENTS FROM BEING
ABLE TO DO WHAT VOTERS PUT THEM
IN PLACE TODAY.I JUST DON'T
THINK IT WORKS.
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM.
FRANKLY, I THINK THE MORE THEY
TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT THE CONGRESSMAN APPARENTLY
HAS SAID, THEY CANNOT STOP THEM
AND THEY OBVIOUSLY, THINK THIS
IS A POLITICAL TACTIC THAT
WORKS FOR THEM.
I DON'T THINK IT WORKS AT ALL.
MARIA: WHAT DO THE MIDTERMS
LOOK LIKE AT THIS POINT FROM
YOUR STANDPOINT?
HAVE THINGS CHANGED, GIVEN THE
LEVEL OF HATE AND HACK ON THE
LEFT?
>> THINGS HAVE CHANGED, WE WILL
SEE IN FOUR WEEKS AND A COUPLE
OF DAYS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE
CHANGED.
IT IS CLEAR THAT THINGS HAVE
CHANGED AGAIN, CONSERVATIVE
VOTERS, REPUBLICAN VOTERS,
CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVES
ARE ENERGIZED LIKE THEY WERE
NOT BEFORE.
IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT IS HOW
SHORT THE NEWS CYCLE IS AND WE
WILL SEE WHETHER THIS IS
SUSTAINED OR NOT.
I BELIEVE IT WILL BE.
I THINK THE TACTICS USED BY
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE, THE
OBVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS,
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THAT
COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE WERE
PURSUING, JUST LOOK LIKE THE
POLITICS DOESN'T EVER END, IT'S
GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL AND NOW
THEY WANT TO CARRY IT INTO
DEARLY GOVERNING.
I THINK IT IS NOT GOING TO
WORK, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS
PROBABLY THE MOST INVESTIGATED,
VETTED PERSON MAY BE IN HISTORY
OF CONFIRMATION PIT SEVEN
CONFIRMATIONS.
NOTHING THAT, AND BY THE WAY,
EVERY ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS,
EVERY ONE OF THOSE SEVEN
BACKGROUND CHECKS, QUESTIONS
ABOUT DRINKING OR HAVE THEY
EVER HEARD ANY THING THAT THEY
SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON.
ONE REASON ACTUAL BACKGROUND
CHECKS THEMSELVES NEED TO
REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL IS, YOU
NEVER WANT PEOPLE TO BE
HESITANT TO SAY, I DO NOT KNOW
IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT BUT I
HEARD THIS.THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENED WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH
SEVEN TIMES.
NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD ANYTHING.
MARIA: MEANWHILE, WHERE DOES A
CYNICAL NOW IN TERMS OF LACK OF
CIVILITY AND THESE ATTACKS?
SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN FLOODED
WITH HATE TWEETS.
I WILL READ YOU ONE OF THEM.
I HOPE SOMEONE KILLS YOU.
I WILL NOT MOURN YOUR DEATH.
ANOTHER ONE SAYS.
I CANNOT EVEN READ THE REST, IT
IS ACTUALLY DISGUSTING!
HERE'S CHUCK GRASSLEY THAT
JOINED ME LAST WEEK WITH
MORNINGS WITH MARIE ON FOX
BUSINESS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS
TAKEN PLACE HERE.
LISTEN.
>> I ALSO THINK THAT THAT
RESISTANCE THAT HAS BEEN IN
EXISTENCE SINCE NOVEMBER 2016,
IS HEADQUARTERED ON CAPITOL
HILL WHEN YOU HAVE
CONGRESSWOMEN SAY THAT YOU GET
IN THE FACE OF ANYBODY THAT IS
IN THE CABINET.
WE HAVE SENATORS SAY, GET IN
THE FACE.
WE OUGHT TO BE SETTING AN
EXAMPLE OF CIVILITY AS LEADERS
IN PUBLIC SERVICE, THAT THE
RESISTANCE IS VERY MUCH, THE
MODUS OPERANDI.
MARIA: DOES LOOK LIKE GETTING
THINGS DONE EXECUTING AN AGENDA
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS DIVISION AND
HATE?
>> WE BACK TO GOTTEN A LOT DONE
THIS CONGRESS.
MARIA: YES, YOU HAVE!
>> THE BILLS AT THE RIGHT TIME,
THE FAA EXTENSION, THE OPIOID
BILL, INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE
FUNDING.
WE ARE GETTING A LOT DONE BUT
NO ONE IS ABLE TO SEE THAT
BECAUSE OF SO MUCH NOISE AND SO
MUCH COVERAGE OF THAT NOISE.
CLEARLY, I CHAIRED THE
INAUGURATION.
I WAS THERE AND IN CHARGE OF
THAT DAY.
I SAID, WHAT WE ARE REALLY GOOD
AT THE COUNTRY WHERE WE SET A
STANDARD FOR EVERYONE ELSE IS
THE TRANSFER OF POWER.
BUT THIS IS AN ELECTION WITH
THE SIDE THAT LOST, HAS NOT
BEEN WILLING TO ACCEPT THE
TRANSFER OF POWER.
TO BE THE RELIABLE QUESTIONER
OF WHAT IS GOING ON, BUT NOT TO
CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE.
YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING TO GET
UNDER SECRETARIES OF THIS AND
THAT OF THE OTHER CONFIRMED FOR
THE SENATE HAS BEEN ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE AND THE SUPREME
COURT JUST SHOWS HOW FAR THINK
THE OTHER SIDE IS PREPARED TO
TAKE THIS.
MARIA: AND BY THE WAY, IT SEEMS
LIKE THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT HAS
BROUGHT THE NEVER TRUMPERS --
EVEN THOSE THAT DID NOT ACCEPT
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
INSIDE GOT TOGETHER WITH HIM
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT KAVANAUGH
WAS CONFIRMED.
IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS IMPROVED
RELATIONS.
IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT?
>> I THINK WE SEE WITH THE
PRESIDENT GETS DONE AS OPPOSED
TO MAYBE, THE WAY HE DOES IT,
IT IS UNBELIEVABLY STRONG
ECONOMY, TRADE BILLS SEEM TO BE
COMING TOGETHER.
THE ABILITY TO PUT PEOPLE ON
THE COURT THAT WILL LOOK AT THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW AND
SEE WHAT IT SAYS.
I THINK THERE IS A SENSE AMONG
REPUBLICANS THAT THIS FIGHT IS
BETTER THAN YOUR PERSONAL
FEELINGS ABOUT ANYBODY IN IT.
MARIA: SURE.
>> I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A
CONSOLIDATION AND THE PRESIDENT
HIMSELF, I THINK IS BEGIN TO
APPRECIATE WAYS HE IS NOT
BEFORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT
YOU SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WHO
SUPPORT YOU AND WORK WITH THEM
