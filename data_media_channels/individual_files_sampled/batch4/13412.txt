exactly president Trump would pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court and Trump did a great job of holding that secret all the way up until the last minute was only about 45 minutes before the event that those of us in the know know began to figure out that it was definitely Brett Kavanaugh does when Judge Amy Coneybear was discovered back in Indiana so she wasn't in Washington DC and Catholics had basically been ruled out and and then there were rumors that that Cavanaugh was headed over to the White House and that basically sealed the deal the White House pitched this thing like a reality show because that's what President Trump does best they actually put out a little 15 second clip of a camera moving toward the White House podium and then scrolling up toward the microphone before it cut to black and then it said 9 p.m. Eastern tonight and then the question was who would get the robe not the Rose the robe and it turned out to be Judge of Brett Kavanaugh so president Trump announced the pick obviously having a fantastic time doing it will talk about Kavanagh what he means for the court in just a second here was president Trump suggesting that when he picks a Supreme Court justice he does not act out asked that justices opinions on on the law in keeping with President Reagan's legacy I do not ask about a nominees personal opinions what matters is not a judge's political views but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and the Constitution require and of course that's exactly true for a lot of people on the right there are a lot of rulings where it doesn't go the way you would want it to go politically but it is the way that the Constitution protects things and Trump is exactly right to say that about cabinets also smart to say that obviously because people think that Trump asked Kavanagh he'd overturn roe v wade and Cavanaugh said yes and then Trump picked him there's also a rumor going around today put out by I believe who's ABC News completely unverified that Brett Kavanaugh was basically chosen by Anthony Kennedy that Anthony Kennedy when he decided that he wanted to step down from the court when to the Trump administration and said I'm only going to step down while you're president so long as you make Brett Kavanaugh my success that the mainstream media are pushing that like crazy today suggesting that it's it was all a corrupt bargain that Kennedy was appointing somebody who had who had continued to promulgate his legacy even if that were true I'm not sure I the left would be upset about that considering that Kennedy was a left-leaning judge on a lot of the key issues including same-sex marriage and abortion if you were appointing his own successor you would think that the left would take solace in that fact but in fact there's no evidence that any of this ever happened the reporter who originally repeated the story said she had no evidence that it happened she had just heard rumors to that effect doesn't matter the left ran with it anyway well then Brett Kavanaugh gets up Brett Kavanaugh of course from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals we've discussed his credentials in the past we've also discussed some of the shortcomings in his record we'll talk about what he's going to do for the Supreme Court in just a second he did a little speech the president assured him up to the podium and then Brett Kavanaugh came forward and everybody went oh my god that's pretty Cavanaugh's music and then he sort of charged for the microphone and then he proceeded to give a speech about his background and his past and then his judicial philosophy here's what he had to say about his judicial philosophy my judicial philosophy is straightforward a judge must be independent and must interpret the law not make the law a judge must interpret statutes as written and a judge must interpret the Constitution as written informed by history and tradition and precedent okay the reason that he adds precedent right there is because precedent is a fudge word if you just said a judge must interpret the Constitution as written informed by history and tradition we'd all say great that's Thomas's standard that Scalia standard by adding the word precedent he allows himself a little bit of wiggle room so when people on the Left say well you do overrule roe v wade wouldn't you he'd say well listen precedence is still precedent precedent is a legal fudge horde and Kavanagh is is fond of using it you know III think that Kavanagh is in short a stand-up double for the president I'm not sure that he's a homerun for the president I think there are a lot of good things about Kavanagh I think that Trump could have gone for broke he decided not to but what Cavanaugh had to say in his in his speech last night was exactly right he talks about how he taught at Harvard Law School who's actually appointed well Lena Kagan was Dean there she of course is on the Supreme Court now he's 53 years old he says that he teaches about the Constitution separation of powers I each that the Constitution's separation of powers protects individual liberty and I remain grateful to the Dean who hired me justice Elena Kagan hey so he's dropping Elena Kagan's name right there because he's trying to win over some some wavering Democrats also when he says that he teaches that the separation of powers protects individual liberty that is him slapping at the so called Chevron defense so as I've explained on the program before there's a very famous Supreme Court case called Chevron in which the Supreme Court essentially declared that administrative agencies ought to be given almost complete deference when it comes to the decisions that they make about individuals so the EPA decides that your toilet is now a protected federal waterway and they decide to find you based on that and you sue the EPA and the EPA has an Administrative Procedure you have to go through the Administrative Procedure and then it comes out against you so you decide to go to the judiciary branch right the EPA is in the executive branch you decide instead to sue in federal court Chevron deference would suggest that the EPA could make the final decision on all of that the the more conservative judges like like Kavanagh people who believe in separation of powers believe that Chevron deference is a mistake and that you can't give executive agencies the power to rule on the rules that they make themselves this is exactly right and finally Kavanagh says that he believes in an independent judiciary I believe that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic if confirmed by the Senate I will keep an open mind in every case and I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law okay so all of this sounds good and he's saying all the right things to get through a confirmation hearing what does his record actually say so there are a couple of areas where he's really good one is on administrative law and one is on guns he's excellent on guns so there's an article over a recent magazine by Jacob Selim who follows this stuff and he points out that in a 2011 decision in which a three-judge panel upheld the District of Columbia's ban on so-called assault weapons and its requirement that all guns be registered Cavanaugh dissented and he said instead that an analysis based on text history and tradition is consistent with the Supreme Court's Second Amendment precedents he suggested that assault weapons bans should actually be forbidden by the Constitution of the United States this of course has left up in arms no pun intended he says that when when the assault weapons ban was formulated it included a bunch of different features of the of the guns that ought to be been he says the list appears to be haphazard to ban certain semi-automatic rifles but not others there's no particular explanation or rationale for why some made the list and some did not and then he concluded that the assault weapons ban in DC was inconsistent with DC versus Heller he said in Heller the Supreme Court held that handguns the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic are constitutionally protected because they've not traditionally been banned or in common use by law-abiding citizens there's no meaningful or a persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles so he's good on that he also has ruled in favor of people being able to spend money in elections and corporations being able to spend money in elections in Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission's he wrote an opinion rejecting FEC rules that made it harder for advocacy groups to raise money said because donations to these hard money accounts are capped at five grand annually for individual contributors the FEC allocation regulations substantially restrict the ability of nonprofits to spend money for election related activities and he says that can't be reconciled with the First Amendment now where he's a little weaker is on fourth amendment right so if you are a civil libertarian and you're deeply concerned with the government violating search and seizure and reasonable search-and-seizure Cavanagh is not a justice you're gonna like very much in 2010 he dissented from the DC Circuit's decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealers Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant he said the tracking did not constitute a search because of the quality and quantity of information so putting a tracker on somebody's car doesn't require a warrants according to Brett Kavanaugh that rationale is is interesting at the very least but it shows that he is more of a law-and-order sort of William Rehnquist a type judge Rehnquist of course was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court all the way up to the point at which Justice Roberts became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court if I'm not getting that wrong in any case I think Cavanaugh has been very Pro police he is he is not a big fan of Terry versus Ohio he's not a big fan of a lot of these sort of civil libertarian decisions that some on the right are fond of he also is very anti Chevron deference as I mentioned he does not believe that the administrative agencies ought to have complete power everything that you do he says chevron has been criticized for many reasons there's a 2016 book review to begin with it has no basis in the Administrative Procedure Act Chevron itself is an a textual invention by the courts in many ways Chevron is nothing more than a judicially orchestrated shift of power from Congress to the executive branch moreover the question of when to apply Chevron has become its own separate difficulty so Kavanagh is very anti Chevron deference so on guns and on administrative state stuff Kavanagh is really really good he's a little bit weaker when it comes to religious freedom stuff maybe although that's not completely clear in praise for life for example he said that the government had a compelling government interest in providing contraceptive care to people he said that even that compelling government interest could not overcome the religious presumption on behalf of priests groups on behalf of religious groups that wanted to have health care done in coordination with their with their First Amendment rights but he said that the government did in fact have a compelling government interest when it comes to contraception and of course in seven sky he was the the creator of the rationale that suggested that Obamacare was a tax and not a fine now in just a second I want to talk about what Kavanagh is impact on the actual court is going to be because I don't think that he's going to be the kind of break it all down shatter every window destroy wholesale the left view of the law guy that some of them left fear and some on the right hope but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over illegal Zim so

use promo code been at checkout for special savings that's legalzoom.com promo code then at checkout okay so what does all of this mean for the court so I said at the very outset I think the Kavanagh is a double I do not think he's a homerun on the political side he's a double because the left is gonna go nuts no matter whom and Trump appoints doesn't matter who Trump appoints Trump could appoint a chicken and the left would go completely insane Trump could inform appointed Merrick garland and what would have said there's some nefarious reason he's an appointing Barack Obama spec he really it must be the Merrick garland has secretly been body-snatched and replaced with an evil right winger that's how much the left hates Trump the reality of the situation however suggests that Cavanaugh is not going to be this this wild right-wing figure that everybody thinks he's going to be and that's why if President Trump was gonna get the flack anyway he may as well have gone for Amy Coneybear I think he should have gone for Mike Lee Amy Cohn you buried someone you know is going to vote a hundred percent of the time in the most robust fashion on constitutional issues I use the word robust advisedly they're the reason I'm using the word robust is because I think Cavanaugh will vote the right way on a lot of these cases but I think the opinions of what she will be part the opinions that he will help write the opinions that he'll write himself I think those are going to be very narrowly tailored opinions and that makes a difference for the creation of precedent that makes a difference for the creation of the law now if you're gonna get in the fight you may as well go for broke and by the way it would've been great to see Democrats attacking a 46 year old mother of seven with two adopted children including one from Africa I believe and attacking her as some sort of evil fall back to barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen that would have been delicious television and it would have really hurt Democrats in the midterm elections as it is I think the Democrats will be jazzed up about Cavanaugh's appointment I think Republicans are saying win with it and they'll go through no problem but I don't think it'll necessarily fire up the base all that much I think a lot of Republicans are gonna be satisfied now okay so what does this mean in terms of the actual decision-making well why does it matter no decision is written it matters how a decision is written because if you write a very broad decision then that gives you the capacity to knock down a bunch of laws at one stroke if you read a very narrow decision you can only knock down a certain narrow subset of laws at one stroke so to take a particular example in the last the last judicial term there's a case called masterpiece cake shop we discussed it at length here the program the masterpiece cake shop case is a case where a religious Baker in Colorado did not want to create a custom cake for a same-sex wedding and there's a law in the state of Colorado created by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission that said that you have to service anybody who comes into your restaurant or into your into your establishment and the ruling that came down from the Supreme Court said that that law was unconstitutional but not because the law itself was unconstitutional it was only unconstitutional because the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had applied the law unequally in fact they had targeted the religious person but they had allowed seculars to go free basically that if you were an atheist and he didn't want to cater a religious cake then you didn't have to but if you were a religious person you didn't want a kid or a same-sex wedding then you had to and they said that's discriminatory well that narrow grounds for ruling means that there is still the possibility that a state could pass a law basically forcing religious people to cater same-sex weddings and that the Supreme Court would allow that to go forward that's the problem of the masterpiece cake shop case well in just second I'm gonna explain why I think having it will be more of that so Kavanaugh is very much like Justice Roberts in the sense that when you read his decisions they're always very carefully tailored to the law that's in front of him it's very rare that he uses a particular law in front of him in order to go after an entire body of law now maybe that's just because it's on the appeals court maybe because you're on an appeals court that means that you're not at the Supreme Court level so you actually have to take into account what the Supreme Court says and you have to use what the Supreme Court says as precedent maybe now that he's on the Supreme Court he'll be a little bit more audacious about striking down bad laws in the name of the Constitution but if we're gonna get a lot of masterpiece cake shop cases if we're gonna get a lot of cases that are very narrowly tailored where he's very careful about how exactly those cases are decided and he doesn't go to the root issue what you're gonna end up with is a lot of confusion at the court of appeals level and this is most obvious when it comes to abortion so a lot of folks on the right are very convinced the Kavanagh because Trump pictum is going to step in and strike down roe v wade tomorrow I am very very skeptical that Cavanaugh and Roberts gonna strike down roe v wade in fact I'm very skeptical that a case even allowing them to strike down roe v wade makes the Supreme Court the reason is because here is the process of how a case reaches the Supreme Court let's say that the state of Montana decides that it wants to pass a law banning abortion except to save the life of the mother and that is appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals applying roe v wade says this is unconstitutional there's a right to an abortion yada yada yada now people on the right would say well good let them do that then it'll elevate to the Supreme Court and then the Supreme Court will knock down roe v wade itself and the law will be protected there's only one problem it takes four votes to actually determine whether a case reaches the supreme court so the way that the supreme court determines whether to take a case in the first place is that somebody appeals on what's called the writ of certiorari and in order for the in order for the supreme court to grant a hearing on the case four justices have to vote to hear the case I don't think there are four justices that would vote to hear a case overturning roe v wade I think that if it'd been Kony Barrett if it'd been Mike Lee I think there would have been four votes to hear the overturning of roe v wade I think that because it is it is not because it's Kavanagh I think Kavanagh will work with Roberts to create a sort of new middle of the court now that middle of the court is not going to be Justice Kennedy it's going to be justice Souter it's not gonna be a wild left middle of the court where they're establishing rights to ridiculous it's nonsense just out of the box where it's not gonna be that but it is gonna be is them refusing to take really big broad huge cases and instead it's going to be them gradually scaling back the application of roe v wade so instead of them just striking down roe v wade letting the chips fall where they may saying this is a bad decision it's gone instead what they probably will do is they will look to a follow-up case to roe v wade called Planned Parenthood versus Casey Planned Parenthood versus Casey it was a case that in which Justice Kennedy wrote the decision it was it's a really crazy case because there were about 83 different opinions on the case the case was decided in 1992 and basically it was a plurality opinion and it decided that roe v wade it is a opinion by O'Connor and Kennedy and Souter right which is why it's a garbage opinion it basically decided that a state could pass a law that restricted abortion so long as it did not create an undue burden an undue burden for the for the woman attempting to get an abortion so the actual standard is the undue burden standard I'm find the exact language they say quote we begin with the standard as described in Casey we recognize the state has legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion like any other medical procedure is performed under circumstances that ensure maximum safety for the patient they say unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right that's what Planned Parenthood versus Casey says now when that was decided it there were a lot of folks on the right who thought maybe this is the first step toward curbing Roe that basically you get a bunch of laws that carved back the ability to get an abortion and the court would just say well yeah it carves back the ability to get an abortion but it's not an undue burden on the right you can still get an abortion in a variety of other ways that's not what happened it's not what happened but now there's the suggestion that maybe that's what's going to happen maybe the Supreme Court won't take a case overtly overruling roe v wade but the Supreme Court will take cases where let's say there's a fetal pain bill that says that you can't abort a baby after the tenth week and the Supreme Court takes that case and they say well that doesn't present an undue burden a woman can still get an abortion she just has to do so in the first ten weeks you could see that happening so would that mean that the right has lost that that the Constitution has lost well the Constitution lost in the sense that the Constitution ought to be the guiding standard in roe v wade is a bad case and you oughta just overrule it but these sort of circumspect way in which I think Cavanaugh and Roberts are going to approach the law jointly suggests that they will rule the right way but they will do so slowly and gradually they're much more concerned with doing things slowly and gradually and incrementally than they are and simply overruling things outright now there's another problem with incrementalism that I'm gonna explain in just a second so the big problem with incremental ism is that once you create broad standards right the left likes to create broad standards obergefell saying that same-sex marriage is now legal across the country abortion saying that not just legal that that states can't can't not perform same-sex marriages across the country Roe versus Wade saying that abortion is legal across the country the left is never afraid to use a bat when it comes to creating judicial opinion they're never afraid to go as broad as humanly possible the right tends to pair that stuff back kind of gradually but that means that anytime the left gets control of the court they immediately establish a new right that the right only tends to chip away at the edges regarding and that to me is is always a net loss for the right over time let's say that this Court is solidly conservative or at least solidly non liberal for the next 20 years well in that time are they how much are they gonna pair back row v Wade they're not gonna overrule it I don't think how much are they gonna pair back row v Wade how much are they gonna pair back challenges to religious freedom plus you only you really do have to make hay while the Sun shines to a certain extent remember Justice Clarence Thomas who's the best justice on the Supreme Court Bar None I love Clarence Thomas's reasoning I think it's a terrific judge Clarence Thomas is seven years old he's gonna be 72 when Donald Trump is up for reelection in that means that if Donald Trump loses he could be 80 by the time a Democrat serves two terms god forbid so that means that Thomas is now gonna have to make some decisions because you got four votes on the Supreme Court that are solidly originalist maybe if you count Cavanaugh and then he got Roberts he's kind of a swing vote if Thomas goes and he's replaced by somebody on the left well that means that you've now got five solid leftist votes to do anything that they want to do so all the people on the right who are saying well we're gonna rule the court for a generation not quite so fast not quite so fast right depends what Clarence Thomas does because Clarence Thomas is right at that weird age where he's still got probably five to ten years in him but at the same time you never know right Justice Scalia died prematurely at 76 so you never know I and that the court has become sort of this ghoulish death watch with regard to all this sort of stuff you know we'll see how Cavanaugh rules I don't think that Cavanaugh is gonna be the gung-ho Gorsuch figure that so many people wanted but is it a win for president Trump certainly a political win for President Trump because Cavanaugh is widely respected he's somebody who's gonna pass through pretty easily he's more reminiscent of Justice Roberts than he is of Clarence Thomas in this respect the Democrats were going nuts over this whole thing are demonstrating just how radical they are now the Democrats didn't even wait to attack as a part of this that's hilarious so Mitch McConnell yesterday came out before Trump had picked Cavanaugh and he said in his inimitable boring fashion that Democrats are going to attack no matter what he's of course right but decades later our Democratic colleagues still haven't tired of crying wolf whenever a Republican president nominates anyone anyone to the Supreme Court tonight President Trump will announce his nominee to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy we don't know who he will name but we already know exactly what unfair tactics the nominee will face and the left is already jumping into unfair tactics with regards to Cavanaugh cocaine Mitch exactly on point right there the fact is that they've already started accusing Cavanaugh of wanting to prevent Trump's impeachment there's no legal basis for this number one if Trump's impeached by a Congress he's going to stay in page number two all Cavanaugh said is that in 2009 Congress should pass a law preventing the active prosecution of the president while he's in office because the impeachment process is the way that the president ought to be impeached it shouldn't be done through legal means basically through suing the president or or through a prosecution of the president but that's not a Supreme Court issue and they're also going after Kavanaugh for his involvement in the Kenneth Starr case there's a piece from from a David Brock book he can't believe David Brock on anything David Brock of course is a liar who worked for sort of Republican constituencies until he flipped and started working for Hillary Clinton he suggested that at one point in the late 90s Brett Kavanaugh mailed the word bitch about Hillary Clinton if that's a reason to if that's a reason to bar somebody from the Supreme Court there won't be a judge left in America I mean seriously that's that's that's ridiculous stuff but this is this is the the level to which the left has sunk on all this and you knew the left is gonna go nuts no matter what so Jimmy Kimmel of course he didn't know who was going to be picked any films before the pic so he suggested that Trump was going to pick Voldemort because no matter who Trump's pick it had to be evil in fact it turns out to be a Catholic father of two who volunteers at a soup kitchen but he's actually Baltimore none of the experts predicted this today I'm keeping another promise to the American people by nominating okay some yeah there it is anybody that term nominates is gonna be Voldemort Ron Perelman who is just an idiot and was also a terrible bike gang leader on sons of anarchy just really didn't fulfill his responsibilities on that show in any case he tweeted out okay ladies and gentlemen who care for and respect ladies it is official the move back to medieval values Sharia law even where old bitter men get to tell women what is best for their bodies lives and well-being as is done and well-being is as done a deal as this is Twitter unless we say no no oh those are all caps then no one to know so a few problems with this tweet besides the fact that we're reading around Perelman tweet on-air huh so there are a few problems number one under Sharia law he would be jailed for the sweet I assume second of all I love it when people say things like bitter old men are gonna decide what women get to do their bodies row v Wade was decided 72 the seven who voted in favor of roe v wade were all men so there's that and then also I like when he says that women's bodies are going to be controlled you see all these idiots who are walking around in the red cloak and the potato chip hat and the bonnet from from had maids tail and I really think that I'm gonna go into business I need to go into business I I want a government contract to be the sole provider of red cloaks and bonnets for the for the rest of this term and hopefully for the next term as well I think if I get a monopoly on that I could become very wealthy indeed and and you know I may as well make this into a capitalistic enterprise as well as an evil patriarchal one if we're if we're gonna go this far I also love when Ron Perlman says all this is going to happen unless we say no no well guess what Ron you just said no no it's gonna happen anyway because bahahahahahaha okay that's why because you lose okay you rubes trump drinks your milkshake that's what just happened right there and the entire life cannot the entire life cannot accept any of this I mean no no millions will die terry mcauliffe a government former governor of virginia who now wants to run for president of the united states after being hillary clinton's waterboy for most of his career he tweeted out the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come and more far Supreme Court into a political arm the right-wing Republican party yeah I woke up this morning and I was driving around and I thought for a second Terry McAuliffe is red because there was no one on the roads I thought maybe ever been raptured and they left me behind and then it turns out it was just like 4:45 in the morning cuz I was on Fox and Friends so it wasn't that but I have been told that I'm going to die because of the Paris Accords I serve I have a t-shirt that says this I survived the the renegotiation of the Paris Accords I survived net neutrality I mean look at me man I survived the tax cuts I survived it I survived night one of the Cavanaugh collapse I survived night one ok this purge like state in which we all live we're a DC white-shoe lawyer who went to Harvard Law School and has worked with a bunch of lefties on the court for years and years and years I survived it and you did too it's just the most Hardy of us just the bravest of us so I don't know whether I've just developed an immunity to all of these horrible things happening in our country because I've been working out or something and really taking my meds or maybe it's that the left has completely lost their mind on all of this stupid garbage but it's whatever it is really you're gonna get exercised over Brett Kavanaugh like I got a honestly I understood when the left is getting all mad about Charlottesville I got it because I think that Trump was wrong about Charlottesville but when they go like nuts over a guy who was endorsed by a killer Itamar in the pages of the New York Times the killer Itamar is a left-wing legal scholar from Yale give me a break

you'll recall tried to filibuster Neil Gorsuch because that was gonna end the world - that failed and now he's gonna try and filibuster and fail Brett Kavanaugh that's gonna fail - here is here's Chuck Schumer saying the freedom of women is at stake women are about to be arrested they are about to me made handmaidens they're about to be enslaved they really are they because weird I'm not seeing any of those things happening but here's Chuck Schumer everyone orders understand what it means for the freedom of women to make their own healthcare decisions and for the protection for Americans with pre-existing conditions those rights will be gravely threatened gravely threatened by the fact that people can vote on them ooh ooh people might vote better not have that let's get some justices on there who will ensure that we can never vote on any of the crucial issues of our time and then Schumer says in precise contravention of what Trump said about personal views on the judiciary Trump had said I don't care about personal views I care about enforcement of the Constitution Schumer says we need to know your personal views your personal views are all that matters and this is because the left believes the personal is political they believe that any opinion you hold as a judge actually comes out in how you rule so if you are anti-abortion but you believe Rovi ways rightly decided it matters more that you are personally anti-abortion this is nonsensical of course and the left doesn't even believe that what they really want is guarantee that the right is not going to rule according to the Constitution they're not going to get that guarantee the left was so all-fired angry over this preemptively so protesters arrived early last night at the Supreme Court Trump had not even appointed his guy they were out there protesting and they didn't know who had been appointed yet okay here's some audio of them making fools of themselves and then the weird and there's always that one weird guy who's got like the anti circumcision sign which is like I don't even realize that was something being appealed to the Supreme Court's that's that's good to know good to know that the chop-chop is definitely going to be is gonna be at the tip of everybody's mind that's it I'm just I'm so confused but the left is now so they've done denial now they are in the middle of anger so anger involves conspiratorial thinking so Cory Booker who is just a wild man Cory Booker the senator from New Jersey and the man with a fictional best friends who is a gang member so Cory Booker he says that Trump is choosing Brett Kavanaugh not because Brett Kavanaugh is a well-established legal mind inside the DC Beltway and was pushed by Leonard Leo and Dom McGann the White House Counsel know the reason that Trump is choosing Brett Kavanaugh is because Brett Kavanaugh is going to help Trump avoid impeachment by what hijacking the marshal of the US Supreme Court and arresting Cory Booker or Brett Kavanaugh actually is Voldemort he's gonna take out his magic wand and lose his nose and somehow save President Trump here's Cory Booker being a complete whack job he has a lot of other legal trouble and the challenges that this president could have caused for himself now he's got it that insurance policy he's got this get-out-of-jail-free card if you if you will Brett Kavanaugh as he got out of jail what's their legal theory is that there's an impeachment hearing Trump gets impeached and it goes to the Supreme Court in the supreme court overrules that cuz a Kavanagh yeah yeah that's gonna happen and aurora's his legal theory that Muller will come down with an indictment and then Cavanaugh will rule then no indictment can move forward except that there aren't the votes on the Supreme Court for that and Cavanaugh doesn't even agree with that and the piece that he wrote in 2009 about prosecution of President suggested that Congress should make the law protecting the president not that the judiciary could protect the president from such prosecution but never mind the conspiracies have to rule so Blumenthal Richard Blumenthal the senator from Connecticut he says that the same thing right Trump is going to let the next justice pardon himself Rudy Giuliani raising the possibility of a pardon this next justice will sit on the issue of whether or not the president can pardon himself or others okay so it's going to be that he's going to trump's gonna pardon himself and cavanaugh will help hold this stuff the conspiracy theories from the left are just out of control my favorite conspiracy theory is this one from Neera tanden Neera tanden is one of the foolish leaders of the women's march and the head of the Center for American Progress and she tweeted out Justice Kennedy's son made a billion dollars in loans to trump from the Russia infested and sanction Deutsche Bank so now I'm not even I'm so confused about what this conspiracy theory even is the conspiracy theory is that Justice Kennedy's son made a loan to Trump and therefore Trump leveraged Kennedy into leaving so that he could bring on Brett Kavanaugh when I loan you money you don't then get to leverage me into anything because I loaned you the money and also if I were gonna loan you money and then you were going to exercise leverage over me wouldn't the leverage mostly involve you telling me how to decide cases not to resign why would you give up that none of this makes any sense but the left is not interested in making sense they're interested in screaming as loudly as possible at the moon convinced that in doing so they will somehow transform themselves into werewolves and thereby bring about the the the thwarting of the Cavanaugh collapse so it's it's all it's all insanity meanwhile to show how extreme left is Michelle wolf continues to make a fool of herself so this of course is the comedian from from Netflix alleged comedian I should say because I don't want to be sued for libel by calling her a comedian I don't think that she she fits the bill so Michelle wolf the only person in America with more annoying voice than mine she goes on the Netflix and she's talking about abortion remember she already said abortion was the sacrament yesterday she said god bless abortion now she says that abortion is not killing a baby don't you understand abortion doesn't kill babies abortion merely stops a baby from happening some people say abortion is killing a baby it's not it's stopping a baby from happening okay some people say the Michelle wolf is killing comedy she's not she's just stopping comedy from happening she's prematurely terminating comedy hey it's it that comedy was never it was never alive that comedy it was it was just a of words before and she got rid of it before it could ever form itself into an actual joke she actually just terminated the joke a little bit early to prevent it from ever taking full form and you can't really accuse sort of killing the joke per se she really just stopped the formation of the joke now you may say Michelle wolf why weren't you just abstinent from comedy why didn't why didn't you just use a little bit protection why did you wait until the joke started to be formed before you carved it apart in the womb and flushed it down the toilet why didn't you just do that but that would be patriarchal to suggest that you are in control of Michelle Wolf's comedic decisions right Michelle wolf gets to be as promiscuous with comedy as she could possibly want to be and then she gets to terminate the results of that comedy before it forms into comedy because after all it's just the same as a polyp it's basically the same as any other sentence that comedic joke okay so Michelle wolf but she is indicative of a mindset that is said in among people on the Left which is that abortion is the ultimate good and that's why they're so imagining the reason they're so mad today is because for folks on the Left abortion has taken on an actual morally positive hue it's not just that abortion is something we need in cases of something going wrong it's something we need in terrible horrible cases you know that's that's an old-fashioned argument you know there used to be people who argued that abortion was necessary because of rape and incest right this was always the argument that was used now as a pro-life person I don't believe that rape and incest are actually in an excuse for an abortion I believe that rape ought to be punishable by a castration death life imprisonment and I believe that incest ought to be punishable by force of law but that doesn't mean that you get to actually kill a baby because the creation of the baby was something horrible and evil that said they used to be the left use those are the excuses they said well you know they're they're really hard moral situations where you have to make compromises now the left says if you have not had an abortion then you are doing something wrong you aren't you're living by the stereotype that you ought to be pregnant and by doing so you are reinforcing the patriarchy it's men making decisions over your body the best kind of woman the most empowered kind of woman is the woman who's had an abortion the woman who's had an abortion is better a better version of the woman and the woman who's never had an abortion because the woman who's never had an abortion you know she really has has not accepted that her body is under her own control it's a sign of female empowerment just the same way that the left has decided that women who part paetynn pornography or prostitutes are actually avatars of female empowerment because they are empowered with their own body well being pregnant and then killing the baby that is another way of feeling proud of your own body because after all the baby who's not an independent human being that's just a part of your body and so when you kill it you're not actually killing it you're just stopping it from happening and I love the euphemisms the left uses stopping it from happening right oh gee Simpson didn't kill Nicole Nicole Brown Simpson he just stopped her from happening and he just he just stopped her I mean he she was there and then she wasn't but it was mostly that she was happening and then suddenly she just stopped happening it was a thing that wasn't happening anymore was Nicole Brown it's just the the levels of lie that the left will tell about abortion in order to maintain it as a sacrament are truly astonishing and that's why when I see people you know on the right who continue to maintain that the right should not engage in this particular battle I say this may be the only important moral battle that's gonna matter a thousand years from now a thousand years from now people aren't going to care about what the tax rate was in the United States in 2018 a thousand years from now people are not truly going to care very much about environmental policy in the United States and the Minor differentiations between cave standards what people are definitely going to care about is whether we as a society decided to green light and not only green light celebrates the murder of the unborn and this is why I think that I wish Kavanaugh would overrule roe v wade I think that we're gonna move in the direction of curbing roe v wade which is better than nothing but I think it would be better if we just got rid of it and and stopped killing you know thirty five hundred babies a day in the United States it seems to me the dad should have been the unending ol here I hope the Cavanaugh proves me wrong maybe he will we'll find out okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like today I speaking of the Supreme Court William Rehnquist was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court until Justice John Roberts was appointed back in 2005 he wrote this is the first book I ever read on the Supreme Court I actually bought it at the Supreme Court it's called the Supreme Court by William Rehnquist and it is it is a good guide to how everything works at the Supreme Court it also has some it has some good content on the history of the Supreme Court and what it's like to work at the Supreme Court and it's a really good kind of primer for anybody who's interested in the basics of how the Supreme Court operates Rehnquist himself is an interesting judge he wasn't an originalist he wasn't really a textualist he was of a conservative if you were gonna say that he was politically oriented and sort of law and order conservative who believed that all of the attempts to undermine law and order the liberal interpretation the Constitution were misguided he tended to vote consistently you know with conservative positions on the court but his opinions were never Scalia or Thomas rooted in the history and context of the Constitution per se but he did move the court in a more conservative direction I think that if you were gonna find a somebody who you're gonna liken to Cavanaugh I think the Rehnquist is probably the best comp in baseball or basketball you say okay you're drew you have a draft pick who does that draft pick pencil out - who's that draft pick become is it Anthony Davis or does this person pencil out - celebrant or does this person pencil out - Brian Scalabrine well when it comes to Justice Roberts you know I said that he was gonna pencil out a lot more like Souter he penciled out somewhere between Souter and and Rehnquist I think that the chances are pretty good that cabinet ends up as a Rehnquist figure which is something conservatives should be happy with I wouldn't say ecstatic about okay time for a couple of one more thing that I like so I don't know why it is that Colton has decided to bring me a weird story today but he's decided to bring me a weird story every day this is a story from w ng o ABC in New Orleans where nard Mathews was killed in New Orleans two weeks ago he was young 18 years old and while the tragedy of losing him so young weighs heavily on his family they chose to have his body prepared for Sunday's afternoon's wake in a way that they want to remember him when the Charbonnet labott Glapion funeral home in dream Matthews was sitting in a chair video game controller in hands surrounded by his favorite snacks and his beloved Boston Celtics on the television screen and if you can't see this folks this is literally a dead guy who's sitting in the chair with a game controller on his lap and a box of chip crunch beneath his chair and and a video of the Golden State Warriors playing the Boston Celtics on television and it's it's video game is is it a video game of the Warriors playing the Celtics well the Celtics are losing because presumably he can't actually move the controller so that's a game he is destined to lose right there he seems rather unenthusiastic about the game perhaps that is because he is dead I will give it to the family at least hehe was posed to doing what he loved so that's that's exciting he he's he's it's full weekend at bernie's over there and in New Orleans and it does make you think like if this were Bill Clinton you probably couldn't pose him in public doing what he loved right would be it'd be a real problem he'd just be Bill Clinton with his zipper down holding a cigar and then just sitting in a chair and then Hillary presumably Hillary Clinton screaming at him screaming at his corpse I could imagine the various the various public figures what like what would you do it Kevin Spacey's funeral you just do it doing what you loved Harvey Weinstein's funeral like just I think we should probably not do this I think that just as a general rule societally we probably should not do this we probably should just stick you in a box yeah this is some well to move it's a move I'll give him that it's a it's a thing that happened in the United States yep and it's gotta be kind of weird because you walk into that funeral you're like do I go over and say hello like do I congratulate him on how the game is going and I like that they have velvet ropes that actually block off the crowd from the body to make sure that people don't go there and like repose him right they're gonna go there and like put his hand on his crotch or something or they or they're going to or they're gonna put like a pom pom in his hand because he's rooting for the team it's a yeah yeah this seems like this seems like not a not a great thing okay so time for some things that I hate the thing that I hate today is the Louvre the Louvre what are you doing okay first of all your barn second of all I don't understand why it is that you are paying homage to jay-z and Beyonce so a couple of weeks ago I did a deconstructing the culture in which I went through the the ape bleep video ape crap video a poop video right because it's a video okay so we went through that a couple of weeks ago because it's ridiculous Rolling Stones did a whole analysis of why Beyonce thrashing about in her undergarments in the middle of Louvre somehow outclasses the work of Leonardo da Vinci and how Western art had been completely put to shame by jay-z standing there like a catatonic idiot while his wife flounce is about in these giant drapes that look like they were bought at the bed bathroom beyond from next door right so for so it's a really bad music video the Louvre has decided that they are going to actually now do a tour of the Louvre based on a video called ape poop about have you ever heard a crowd going ape poop and a bunch of half-naked people doing gyrating motions in front of great art the Louvre you suck so here is the New York Post here's what they say everything is love between the Carters and the Louvre beyonce and jay z's ate bleep video has racked up 61 million views and Counting in just the past three weeks because in large part because the music video is showing the power couple dancing among masterpieces such as da Vinci's Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo and the Parisian Fine Arts Museum is a visual feast a visual feast really more like a visual Last Supper because afterward somebody is going to get it okay now the Louvre is capitalizing on its new street cred by offering a free self-guided tour of 17 paintings and statues featured prominently in the first video off of the carters new album everything is love including the winged victory of samothrace statue the Beyonce Vogue's in front of while wearing a hundred and forty thousand dollars to fan rollin wedding dress that sucker crossed a hundred and forty thousand dollars I have a question these are these are the people of the people is like what the people want the lady thrashing about in front of winged victory of samothrace wearing a hundred and forty thousand dollar wedding dress she's aren't even married for several years like he couldn't give him that to charity and just going to the Salvation Army picked up a tablecloth lady my goodness and she apparently also Murray Ben West's portrait of a negress the 90-minute self-guided audio tour gysi at the people saying oh who is currently only in French but other languages will eventually be available or you can translate the torn your internet browser using plugins like Chrome's translate feature the guide identifies each work of art and gives its historical context well I'm sure that I'm sure that jay-z and Beyonce knew the full historical context and I'm sure that when they were screaming about going ape bleep amongst the half nude bodies gyrating in front of these paintings they were they're really thinking about how can I get more tourists to see the winged victory of samothrace by the way well in forget forget like a hundred years in five minutes when no one cares about this video that statue will still be there because that's what statues are made for permanence and it's an amazing piece of art the Louvre wasn't hurting for attention eight million people visited the world-class cultural institution last year 1 million of them came from the US more than half were under the age of 30 but the Carters are one of the world's most powerful couple says the New York Post with a 1.6 billion dollar combined net worth last year so why can't they afford better clothes may they spend a hundred and forty thousand dollars I'm not gonna get over the fact that that dress cost 140 thousand dollars I'm just not it looks like she was it was like she was swamped by a by a an opaque jellyfish beyonce boasts more than 113 million Instagram followers and one social media post from her is worth 1 million dollars in advertising because everything is not love everything is stupid so there's celebrity endorsement inspires their fans who haven't crossed the Atlantic to consider making the trek to the Louvre and the video also showcases works of art apart from the Mona Lisa which those who visited the museum already may have missed so this can encourage them to return syracuse university professor and pop culture expert Robert Thompson told money ish Beyonce and jay-z have essentially become backdoor curators of one of the world's greatest art collections because they've taken those 17 works and suddenly escalated them to the top of the Louvre it's true nobody had heard of the Mona Lisa or the winged victory of samothrace until Beyonce and jay-z it wasn't like they were in the world's most famous be oh yeah it turns out that 8 million people a year saw those things because they're in the world's most famous Museum yeah the Louvre 17 must-see pieces are now the ones that they chose their own Greatest Hits marketing expert mark sab Lau CEO cogent entertainment marketing agreed the Louvre is already a massive tourist attraction now it is an Instagram attraction for all pop culture junkies great I want more idiot Millennials taking selfies in their sunglasses while gyrating in front of great statues that's what Western art is all about says the Carters are the new framers that would be the series of guidebooks but their songs acting as travel guides to must-see cultural experiences well technically something solely acting as a Travel Guide it's more than music video the song itself acts only as a Travel Guide to actual ape crap so there's that and they are apparently making the museum accessible to a wider audience because no one had heard of the Louvre before they've made it accessible says the Carters could potentially bring in a whole new audience of people by the way I don't know that um that would actually be what the Carters intended considering that I thought according to Rolling Stone the whole thing was supposed to be mocking the insularity an archaic nature of Western art that all this Western art was based on white people but here are brown and black bodies and of the art and therefore drawing a contrast between the live bodies and the dead portrayals of those bodies on the walls of the Louvre that was Rolling Stones take so I guess there's a different take which is that apparently Beyonce and juicy love Western art the Louvre has benefited from star power before of course it was featured in The Da Vinci Code and and of course it was in Night at the Museum as Museum of Natural History was in Night at the Museum right the difference is that none of it was really about like mocking the art itself the Brooklyn Museum is in the middle of the David Bowie is exhibit of a exhibition of 400 objects including 60 custom-made performance costumes handwritten lyrics sheets and drawings from the late music icons a personal archive okay I guess all advanced tickets are sold out like people have nothing to do I think that this is the conclusion I've come to people have nothing to do that you gotta go see David Bowie's costumes you know what honey I've got nothing to do it's a Sunday morning let's go see David Bowie's costumes okay or I could shoot myself in the face I mean what okay okay I get it some your David Bowie fans all right all I'm saying is that the the attempt to turn great art into a backdrop for bad art and then use that bad art as oh look at them they're patrons of the Arts Oh Louvre Louvre now the French what can you do with them all right we'll
