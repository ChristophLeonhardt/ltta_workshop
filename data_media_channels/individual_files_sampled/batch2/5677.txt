day four five five of the Trump administration brings major developments in the Russia investigation another wild one a lot of them breaking just tonight over these past few hours chiefly we now have the 15 pages of memos that former FBI director James Comey drafted about his interactions with President Donald Trump earlier tonight the Justice Department sent those memos to Congress and as things so often do they ended up minutes later in the hands of the news media they do confirm that on February 14 the president asked Comey this with regard to the investigation of now former national security adviser Mike Flynn I hope you can see your way to letting this go to letting Flynn go we also learned that on january 28th remember fewer than 10 days into his presidency Donald Trump told Comey he had quote serious reservations about Mike Flynn's judgment that's the National Security Adviser in the West Wing and later on February 8th former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus asks this of James Comey do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn the president was also concerned about the political impact of the Russia investigation Comey writes on March 30th the president says quote he said he was trying to run the country and that the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult he says he would have won the health care vote but for the cloud well tonight the president's legal team is making a big play they are bringing in former New York City Mayor and one-time Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani before he was mayor Giuliani made a name for himself as let's call it a very aggressive US Attorney for the Southern District of New York the same office that ordered the FBI raid on Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen Giuliani has links to the two key people in this investigation the fired FBI director James Comey he worked under Giuliani in the Southern District and Special Counsel Robert Muller was you'll recall director of the FBI during an after 9/11 Giuliani was New York mayor the Giuliani hire comes as the president has escalated his attacks on Muller tonight Giuliani told The Washington Post quote I hope we can negotiate an end to this for the good of the country and because I have high regard for the president and for Bob Muller Giuliani did did not say whether a final decision has been made on a potential Trump Muller sit-down interview that may be determined by the strength of Giuliani's personal connection to trump Giuliani spent a lot of time on the campaign trail with the president and was a tireless surrogate for the president his remarks about Trump during the Republican National Convention may encapsulate their relationship I am sick and tired of the defamation of Donald Trump by the media and by the Clinton campaign I am sick and tired of it this is a good man and America should be sick and tired of their vicious nasty campaign what I did for New York Donald Trump will do for America I have known Donald Trump for almost 30 years and he has created and accomplished great things in my city and all over the world so let's put him down as pro Trump in addition to Giuliani Trump has hired the husband-and-wife legal team of Jane serene Raskin and Marty Raskin former federal prosecutors both of whom with experience in organized crime cases who run a Florida based law firm all three of these new legal additions will be reporting working with Jay Sekulow and Whitehouse lawyer Ty Cobb Bloomberg News also reports that investigators started scrutinizing Paul Manafort because they suspected the former Trump campaign Chairman might have been serving as a back-channel to Russia this revelation came out in federal court today during a hearing in which mana forts lawyers argued that Muller overstepped his authority in the Russia investigation by indicted Manta fort for financial fraud and other charges bloomberg reports that a senior Justice Department prosecutor told the judge Muller's team was entirely justified in investigating Manta fort because of his role on the campaign saying quote he had long-standing ties to Russia back politicians did they provide back channels to Russia investigators will naturally look at those things well that's a lot and it's the point at which we bring in our leadoff panel for this busy Thursday night we're joined once again by Kimberly Atkins chief Washington reporter for the Boston Herald and an MSNBC contributor Frank fig Lucy's back with us former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence who in the past has worked for Robert Muller also an MSNBC national security analyst and Mimi Roker returns to the broadcast former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York now a distinguished fellow in criminal justice at the Pace University School of Law Mimi home-field advantage goes to you I'll start with you what stands out to you here I have we all have a copy of these memos with big black marks for redactions the stuff we really want to read and aren't allowed to see well what happened tonight when these were released look what stands out to me is that this just bolsters the credibility of Jim Comey I was not one to doubt it in the first place but for those who might have been on the fence about it I mean you don't make this up this is not made-up stuff this reads like real life happening and him recording it and so to the extent that this was you know orchestrated released at a time that somebody thought politically it might help them I don't think it did that help someone on the Republican side help the Trump backers I don't think it did that at all I think it really shows how Jim Comey's mind works and that is to absorb information in a very detailed way and record it in a very detailed way and that is the hallmark of a truth teller and in my view we urge people to on your device or your laptop find a way to read these because it does speak to the process those of us who are lay people and not in law or law enforcement can't imagine taking notes like this but he says in here that within five minutes of leaving Trump Tower within minutes of leaving the White House he gets in a vehicle or in a corner somewhere and just dumps out everything that happened for posterity quoting wherever he feels is accurate and this is a guy this is his process by the way his life's work exactly this is this is what FBI agents are trained to do from day one you know the recording of events and statements and observing things in a way that that others might not that a lay person might not the the attention to detail and and I just think that that is you're right it's hugely important for people to see themselves because we've heard about the Comey memos for so long now and even in reading his book it reads differently because as you know that that's that's a novel in a way that's you know literature this is more like an FBI agent report you know they're they're called FBI 302s but that that's how this reads and I think it shows his training and how it comes through Frankfurt loozy I'm coming to you next before I do I want to play James Comey was a guest on Rachel Maddow actually in this very studio earlier tonight and he talked about this very process you explained to Congress that you didn't write memos like this after other interactions with other presidents what trained you or told you or made you believe that you should write a memo like this after interactions with President Trump well the first meeting in particular I was concerned that I needed a record to show the other intelligence agency Chiefs who had been with me but didn't stay behind for the second private meeting and also was worried that I was meeting alone with the President to talk about things that were relating to him into the FBI's core responsibilities and given the nature of the person as I understood the president-elect he might not tell the truth about those if it ever became an issue and so I needed a written record so Frank let's agree on the process let's agree that it would be near impossible and damn unlikely for a guy like him to exit the White House and make up a fiction as if to assume where the future is going to take us on how that fiction would help out someday so that said as a as a career investigator when you look at these Comey memos what stands out to you so so Mimi's right first they are consistent with someone who's been in the law and around investigations for decades and that's exactly what you do is you have this you gain this incredible ability to absorb large amounts of information understand where people said some certain things in certain conversations and then quickly recount all of them and you learn that in part because you don't want to sit in front of subjects a lot and take notes or tap out on a laptop you completely distract any interview you're doing so it's consistent with that it adds to his credibility now what I what I see let's look at it from the other lens which is what it tells us about the White House I read the memos and I see dysfunction I see a bunch of newbies and rookies who just don't understand how government works I mean at one point Reince Priebus asks Comey if he's an attorney I mean there's there's no whole work done on anybody they leave that the FBI director alone with the president the president asks Comey if he can investigate the hooker allegation in Moscow just to make it kind of go away continually asks if mccabe has a problem with him it's it's it's odd and you know you reported earlier that we've we've heard that the president's hired a couple of organized crime attorneys from florida i got to tell you from from what we see in these memos maybe that's the right way to go I worked in the FBI in South Florida there's a lot of Russian mobsters down there and maybe these two attorneys know how to deal with that for the record they were on the prosecutorial side and not the defense attorney side but to your point they have been in the business a long time hey Kim you have the dual burden of being an attorney and a reporter how about the reporter side of you I'll make a suggestion that maybe a president so few days into his administration having doubts about his national security adviser is a story what else do you find what does the journalist in you find to be the stories in this collection of documents yeah I mean he gave us just a few more details of what we already saw I agree with what was said about James Comey and his consistency it really shows that he has been consistent from his testimony before Congress through his book and now his book tour in the story that he tells but we do get additional nuggets about the the concern that President Trump was expressing about his own national security adviser someone who he publicly defended even after he was fired for some time but privately really expressed concern about we also saw the president really backing the idea of jailing journalists who published reports based on leaks saying how a couple days in jail and they'll start talking Ampera phrasing and James Comey even laughing after that I don't know if it was out of discomfort let's hope so because clearly that's not the way our First Amendment works here in America but just more details about these conversations that they have that really paints the president as somebody who was concerned about people in his own team who was consistent who would sell tell James Comey one thing and a few minutes later tell him the exact opposite for example he told him that rights Reince Priebus then the chief of staff didn't know that they were having dinner and then later said that he did just a lot of inconsistency that is a stark contrast to the consistency in statement that you see coming from Comey himself hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
