MICHAEL MOORE: Can a Broadway
show bring down a sitting

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,840
president?

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,820
It was a theory I
had, a question.

5
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,930
I thought.

6
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,930
well, why not?

7
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's give it a try.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,245
We've tried everything
else since January.

9
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,943
Here's hair and makeup.

10
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:13,442
[LAUGHTER]

11
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:13,941
OK.

12
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm done.

13
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,400
"The Terms of my Surrender"
is a one-man show.

14
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,980
It's a piece of theater that
I've written that I wanted

15
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,144
to perform live.

16
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:24,032
[BOMBASTIC MUSIC PLAYING]

17
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:26,890


18
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,780
A lot of things I talk about
are necessarily about Trump,

19
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,860
per se.

20
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,110
I don't think there's
anything really new to say,

21
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,950
at this point.

22
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,540
I think we get the drill.

23
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,890
But I do have a lot to say about
us and how I think we ended up

24
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,000
with him, and maybe how to
prevent something like this

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
from ever happening again.

26
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,036
I'm not going
through it in 2018.

27
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:48,410
I'm not going
through it in 2020.

28
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,710
So you have to join me here.

29
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,430
To do it in the city where
the Clinton campaign was,

30
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,980
where so much of liberal America
has its base, it's like I,

31
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,460
as a Midwesterner, want
to say to the base, here,

32
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,540
come out of the bubble.

33
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,349
We can win.

34
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,459
We can do this.

35
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,240
But you've got to understand
what's going on between

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,050
the Hudson River and
La Cienega Boulevard.

37
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,732
You know?

38
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:17,110
I-- it's-- there's a
lot going on out there.

39
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,510
It's a daily [MUTED]
show hitting us, right?

40
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,000
Like a firehose of
[MUTED] every day,

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,970
just one piece of [MUTED]
after another, coming.

42
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,660
Did I say every day?

43
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,870
Every hour!

44
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,680
Filming takes a while, and the
show is happening right now,

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,100
as you see it.

46
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,130
There's no editor.

47
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,800
The producers, even though
they may be in the house,

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,200
they can't edit me or tell
me what to say or whatever.

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,260
- Did he ask for-- is
this a new question now?

50
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,790
MICHAEL MOORE: Any time I'm let
loose, every night at 8:03 PM--

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,434
- Let me fact-check it quickly.

52
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,600
MICHAEL MOORE: You know,
anything could happen here.

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,980
That makes a lot of
people nervous here.

54
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,810
But-- but it'll be fine.

55
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,780
It's-- so far, no one has died.

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,930
What's the latest today?

57
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,250
That Steven Bannon is thinking
of-- he's trying to convince

58
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,830
to name that Stephen Miller
guy from Mars as the new White

59
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,260
House communications director.

60
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,980
I enjoy the conversation
with my fellow Americans.

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,310
I'm-- it's a privilege
to live in this country.

62
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,430
But the rights I have
are not privileges.

63
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,980
They come to me by the very
power and the very fact that I

64
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,060
am an American.

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,010
And I have these rights
to speak my mind,

66
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,880
to encourage others to rise
up to either take this country

67
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,190
back or take us into
a better direction.

68
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,070
And I have a lot of faith that
my fellow Americans who feel

69
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,564
the same way are
going to do that.

70
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:49,230
Are you with me?

71
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,688
Who's going to do
the [INAUDIBLE]??

72
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,180
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:02:53,180 --> 00:00:00,000
