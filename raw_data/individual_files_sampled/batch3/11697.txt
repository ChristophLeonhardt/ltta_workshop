Kurdish forces fighting in Syria said that they quote to have no problem joining the government army if they're allowed to form a federal state in the north of the country the statement comes after Turkey claimed that the US President had promised to stop arming Kurdish forces however there's apparently no clear position in the White House on the matter once we started winning the campaign against Isis the plan and part of the process is to always wind down support for certain groups now that we're continuing to crush the physical Caliphate that we're in a position to stop providing military equipment to certain groups Kurdish forces have been successfully fighting Islamic state in northern Syria you can see who controls what areas on this map the US has long been providing the Kurds with military equipment something that's been irritating Washington's NATO ally Turkey as our T's Moorhead Garcia explains as the proverb says you can't ride two horses with one backside makes sense right unfortunately it doesn't stop people from trying we support turkey in the first fight against terror and terror groups like Isis and the PKK the president authorized the Department of Defense to equip Kurdish elements of the Syrian democratic forces whatever the reason is it is not something that is acceptable for our friends and NATO ally turkey is an ally obviously a strong partner certainly with respect to ISIL and a friend here's how it is to u.s. allies the Turks and the Syrian Kurds as sworn enemies Washington has on the Kurds to the teeth saying they need these weapons to fight the jihadists and Turkey sort of understood since when do you need to cooperate with one terrorist organization to fight another terrorist organization it's not the way a serious State should behave and it does not suit the United States so what next does the u.s. abandon one of its most trustworthy partners try to take back those guns the Kurds aren't stupid can play that game too there is no problem for our forces to join the Syrian army if a new Syrian Constitution is drafted on a federal basis and the rights of all Syrians are reserved this is a two-pronged approach it's a warning to the US we can dump you before you dump us and a message to Assad give us what we want autonomy and we will need the Americans has occurred I can say that our people want to build a Syria for all Syrians of no force or ethnic group dominating any other group I believe it is in the interests of the Kurds as the second largest ethnic group in Syria to build a new multi-party and federal Syria where the interests of the Kurdish people would be enshrined in a constitution allowing Kurds to participate in Parliament and join the army in all other state institutions a new constitution for Syria is on the horizon Russia Iran and Turkey are backing the initiative but what the Kurds get out of it is still up for debate the US has never viewed the Syrian democratic forces as partners unfortunately the US has only been using them to fight ISIL and destroy Raqqa I believe the alliance between the US and forces on the ground including the SDF in Syria and Kurdish groups in Iraq has never been a true partnership the u.s. provided assistance and weapons for self-defense purposes and for combating ISIL but these agreements have never been linked to military action which leaves us with the US and its two horses betrayed the Turks a valuable NATO ally will betray the Kurds their ace in Syria alternatively wait for them to betray the States well it was a turkish foreign minister who said the donald trump had promised president Erdogan to cut military aid to the Kurds we asked the us-led coalition about the issue and this is the response we received the Coalition says it's committed to providing the Syrian democratic forces the support they need in order to defeat Islamic state offer and Nicholas Davies says Washington's pronouncements on the issue of arming the Kurds shouldn't be taken at face value I think we have to wait wait and see exactly what this means but but at the same time we should be very conscious that most of the arming of rebel groups in Syria by the US and its allies was done covertly so whatever they are saying publicly is not necessarily the whole story there's a lot of holes in that story that are big enough to drive you know ships planes and trucks loaded with weapons through
