does the SodaStream actually save you money I have the pure model which cost one hundred and thirty dollars but this includes canister of co2 worth fifteen dollars and I want to know how long it'll take me to recoup by a hundred and fifteen dollar investment in this machine if I make sparkling water at home the only cost is the co2 one bottle of carbonation makes 60 liters according to SodaStream which means that each liter sparkling water costs me about twenty-five cents to make to make flavored soda I have to add the cost of the flavoring so it cost me a sixty-seven cents for each liter I sent my mom to the grocery store in Chicago to do some comparison shopping Joyce found one liter of sparkling water for 79 cents and a liter of generic Cola for 89 cents it turns out that I save 54 cents and every liter of sparkling water I make so I would need to make 213 liters to recoup by a hundred and fifteen dollars this would take over four years if I only drink a liter of milk I only save 22 cents per liter of Cola which means it would take me 513 liters or about ten years to break even I like fizzy er soda and tend to use twice the recommended number of pumps if you adjust the numbers for someone like me the cost goes way up I would need to drink a liter of sparkling water a week or over seven and a half years break even I'm losing money on every leader and a flavored soda I make there are a few universal benefits of the SodaStream it eliminates the waste of all those bottles and means a lot less weight to carry home from the grocery store whether or not you save money depends on how much you spend on your soda now and how much of it you buy if you drink tons of soda and the SodaStream is still a great deal
