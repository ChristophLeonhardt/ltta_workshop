the idea that draught beer or bottled beer that one or the other is better is a complete misconception a lot of people seem to think that draught beer is better and it's not necessarily true it's sort of a complicated answer that really boils down to it depends draft beer can sometimes be fresher certainly often because of the way it's packaged it's not exposed to light it's kept cold the entire time in this country those are things that help maintain the freshness of the beer on the other hand depending on how the retailer dispenses the beer the cleanliness of their lines how well their system is set up all those can be factors that can negatively affect the beer potentially whereas with the bottle you know once it leaves the brewery as long as it's not you know treated to some extreme exposure you open the bottle and it goes either out of the bottle right in the glass to the consumers there's not that intermediate step of traveling through a draft beer system that can possibly change the flavor of the beer a well treated bottle and a well treated draft beer can both be equally good but it just sort of matters on what's happened to them in between
