IT'S OPEN.

6
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:20,752
>> I DON'T GO ON DATES WITH GUYS

7
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:23,521
THAT DON'T OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME.

00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,522

00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,583
THIS IS THE HUSBAND WRITING TO

39
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,085

44
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:35,693
AISLE.

MY LOVE FOR YOU, HENRY.

47
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,134
SUZANNE YOU SAW ON FACEBOOK THIS

48
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:44,836
VIDEO SAYING CHIVALRY WAS

49
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,437
HARMFUL TO MEN AND WOMEN BECAUSE

50
00:01:46,437 --> 00:01:48,273
IT REINFORCES THIS IDEA THAT

51
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:49,874
WOMEN NEED TO BE HELPED OR SAVED

52
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:52,610
BY A STRONGER MAN, IT TAKES AWAY

53
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,512
FROM WOMAN'S AGENCY.

54
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:56,047
YOU SAW THESE TWO CONTRASTS.

55
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,783
YOU STARTED TO WRITE THE OP-ED,

56
00:01:58,783 --> 00:01:59,784
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE FOR US.

57
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,785
>> SURE.

58
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:03,087
IT JUST STRUCK ME AS JUST WOW, I

59
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,490
MEAN THE STARK CONTRAST BETWEEN

60
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,324
THIS BEAUTIFUL LETTER THAT

61
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,893
REALLY MOVED ME TO SEEING THIS

62
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,461
MESSAGE FROM THIS WOMAN,

63
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:12,330
BASICALLY SELLING THE SAME TIRED

64
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,464
MESSAGE THAT MEN HAVE BEEN

65
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:15,066
HEARING FOR DECADE WHICH IS, I

66
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,467
CAN DO IT BY MYSELF.

67
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:17,435
I'M STRONG ENOUGH.

68
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:18,870
YOU DON'T NEED TO HOLD THE DOOR

69
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,904
OPEN FOR ME.

70
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,006
YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY MY WAY.

71
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,675
BASICALLY ANYTHING THAT IS SORT

72
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,376
OF TRADITIONALLY MALE AND FEMALE

73
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,712
IN TERMS OF THE COURTSHIP IS

74
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,513
JUST GONE.

75
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:29,981
AFTER SOME YEARS OF HEARING

76
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:33,251
THAT, MY ARGUMENT IS THAT MEN

77
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,186
HAVE EFFECTIVELY SAID, OKAY, YOU

78
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,088
SAID YOU DON'T WANT IT, SO I

79
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:38,489
GUESS I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT.

80
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:41,559
IF I DO IT I WILL BE INSULTED.

81
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,294
THEY ARE REALLY LOST AND CONFUSE

82
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,262
WHAT WOMEN WANT.

83
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:45,897
WOMEN ARE JUST AS CONFUSED

84
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:47,465
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD THIS

85
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,034
MESSAGE THAT, THAT CHIVALRY IS

86
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,437
BAD OR SOMEHOW DESTRUCTIVE TO

87
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,738
WOMEN IT IS NOT AT ALL.

88
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:55,173
SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

89
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:56,841
AINSLEY: WENDY, WHAT DO YOU

90
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:57,141
THINK?

91
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,543
ARE WE TO BLAME, WOMEN.

92
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:01,312
>> I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR TO SAY

93
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,714
WOMEN KILLED CHIVALRY.

94
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,415
WHETHER YOU LOOK FROM CARD DID

95
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:04,782
I.

96
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,985
ABOUT, TO BEYONCE,WORKING MOMS

97
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,753
OR COUNTLESS OTHERS WHAT WE HAVE

98
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,188
DONE WE EVOLVED THE CONVERSATION

99
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:12,156
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A WOMAN IN

100
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,191
TODAY'S SOCIETY.

101
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,892
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS, WE'RE

102
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:17,629
DOING IT ALL, AND IT IS

103
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,063
BASICALLY MEAN MEN HAVE TO

104
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,098
BASICALLY RISE TO THE OCCASION

105
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:21,366
TO MEET US WHERE WE ARE.

106
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,901
WE ARE NOT THE MOTHERS OF OUR

107
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:24,202
PAST.

108
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:28,806
THERE WAS FOG WRONG WITH THAT

109
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,375
PAST -- NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT

110
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,176
WE'RE DOING JUGGLING MILLIONS OF

111
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:32,844
THINGS.

112
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,746
CHIVALRY IS NOT DEAD, IN ESSENCE

113
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:36,214
WE DON'T WANT MEN TO OPEN DOORS

114
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,116
FOR US, WHAT WE ARE SAYING WE

115
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:40,518
HAVE TO HANDLE US AND HANDLE A

116
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,886
FULL-TIME JOB AS WELL.

117
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:43,321
AINSLEY: YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT

118
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:46,024
IN THE OP-ED, SUZANNE, NOT THAT

119
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:47,792
WE CAN'T OPEN OUR OWN DOORS, TO

120
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,894
THE THAT WE CAN'T PAY FOR OUR

121
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:53,631
OWN FOOD, BUT YOU SAY THAT, IS

122
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,967
IT, IS THIS SHOW OF SIGN OF

123
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,334
RESPECT?

124
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,735
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO LET A

125
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,003
WOMAN DO THOSE THING?

126
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,171
>> RIGHT.

127
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:03,441
SO WHAT'S BEEN LOST IN THIS

128
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:06,644
WHOLE, 40-YEAR EXPERIMENT REALLY

129
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:07,979
OR, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DEFINE

130
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,214
IT IS THE YIN AND YANG THE DANCE

131
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:11,215
BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN.

132
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:13,484
MEN AND WOMEN NOW ARE COMPLETELY

133
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,353
CONFUSED AND LOST ABOUT WHO IS

134
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,321
SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT.

135
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,057
WHO WANTS WHAT AND WHAT WOMEN

136
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,926
SPECIFICALLY ARE CONFUSED ABOUT,

137
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:25,730
IS MEN AND HOW THEIR, IT IS IN

138
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,732
THEIR DNA TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT

139
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:28,132
WOMEN.

140
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:29,033
THAT IS WHO THEY ARE.

141
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,535
THAT IS THEIR IDENTITY.

142
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,104
WE'VE ESSENTIALLY RIPPED OUT OF

143
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:33,404
THEM.

144
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,506
WHEN THEY BECOME UNMOORED.

145
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,508
IF YOU DON'T LET THEM DO WHAT IS

146
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,444
IN THEM TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO

147
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:40,778
DISRUPT THAT DANCE.

148
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,347
SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

149
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:46,784
MASCULINITY AND FEMINITY ARE

150
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,753
WONDERFUL THINGS IN AND OFF

151
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,455
THEMSELVES, WHEN THEY WORK IN

152
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,090
TANDEM, SPARKS FLY.

153
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:52,857
IT IS AWESOME.

154
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:54,025
WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THAT TO

155
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,593
HAPPEN PAUSE WE ARE INFUSED WITH

156
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:58,563
THIS MESSAGE ABOUT EQUALITY, THE

157
00:04:58,563 --> 00:04:59,764
IDEA MEN AND WOMEN ARE THE SAME

158
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:00,698
WHEN THEY ARE NOT.

159
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,667
THAT GESTURE OF HOLDING THE DOOR

160
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,836
OPEN I WAS USING AS ONE EXAMPLE

161
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,938
IS TO THE MEN TRYING TO OPEN

162
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:07,638
PRESS WOMEN.

163
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:08,806
THEY WANT TO PLEASE THEM.

164
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:10,541
THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

165
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,777
THEY WANT TO SHOW THEM HONOR

166
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:13,144
REALLY.

167
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:14,479
WE KNEW THIS IN THE PAST.

168
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,913
EVERYBODY KNEW THIS THIS HAS

169
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,749
GOTTEN COMPLETELY LOST IN THE

170
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:18,516
LAST 40 YEARS.

171
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,485
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE TELEGRAM

172
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:23,054
HOW DEEPLY THAT WAS FELT AND

173
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:23,488
UNDERSTOOD.

174
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:24,355
WOMEN TODAY WANT.

175
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,656
YOU READ AT THAT TELEGRAM.

176
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,558
WHO WOULD TO THE WANT THAT,

177
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:27,859
RIGHT?

178
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,994
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET

179
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,997
THERE, YEAH, GOT TO GET BACK TO

180
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:33,464
UNDERSTANDING --

181
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:34,799
AINSLEY: WENDY, WE'RE ALL, I

182
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,168
HEARD IT SAID THAT WE ARE

183
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:39,103
CREATED THE, WE ARE BOTH EQUALLY

184
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,472
AS IMPORTANT BUT CREATED THE

185
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,207
DIFFERENTLY IN OUR NEEDS AND OUR

186
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:43,508
WANTS.

187
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:44,542
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

188
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,778
