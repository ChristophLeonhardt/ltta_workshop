this is a big weekend for the World Cup we turn now to our sister network and daily wire to sports correspondent Jeremy the god-king boring scaramouche scaramouche will you do the Fandango Michael enormous news from the bear of the north as for the second time in less than a century Germany's dreams of global conquest collapse in western Russia with their 2o defeat at the hands of South Korea a nation with roughly half of Germany's GDP speaking to the BBC former German champ Jurgen Klinsmann said quote it's always difficult when you win to repeat it four years later an admittedly strange declaration from a nation that has made failure look easy in every generation since the franco-prussian war of 1870 of course Germany who brought us the fall of Rome the Dark Ages nihilism Nazism two world wars trance music and the failed project that is the EU is never truly defeated and will undoubtedly rise again from the ash heap of history and prove that they can in fact put a small ball roughly the size of a human head through an enormous net without the use of the hands that God gave them as well as any third world nation for France in other world cup news this week marks the close of the tournament's group stage and the beginning of the quarterfinals what this means is frankly anybody's guess this sportscaster for one stopped reading the Wikipedia entry pretty early on if I'm being honest because as a god-fearing American I just couldn't be moved to give a flip about what kind of archaic rules govern this socialist non-sport I having far more exciting things to do with my time like dozing lightly in my armchair or literally anything else I did ask several people in my office who have repeatedly assured me that I'm wrong to criticize so beautiful a game if they could give me a quick rundown of how it all works before airtime but they all reluctantly confess to never having actually watched a match before the current World Cup started even though they think it's hugely important cultural event and I should be ashamed of myself for blowing it off as nothing more than a deliberate attempt to reduce America from its status as shining city on a hill down to parity with the lowest common denominator equatorial hellhole from which the soul of man used to try out for freedom and deliverance to so great a nation as this but who now see that we're not really all that great if you really think about it because without our hands and the complexity with which we conquered war poverty disease and death since the last world war were really just like everybody else also men are not stronger than women the Millennium Falcon was never all that fast and Batman could totally take Superman in a fight even though the ladder is invincible and can literally shoot laser beams at the speed of light from his eyes from space a place that none of the country said if ever one the world cup have ever been to probably probably because they haven't figured out how to use their hands to be clear however it's not the position of this self entertained journalist that the admittedly handsome men who run around and fake injuries on the soccer field are not athletes on the contrary they are clearly quite fit and able to run around if aimlessly for long periods of time with no breaks the issue is not that they aren't athletes it's at soccer is not a sport it's an admittedly mesmerizing bit of choreography in which colorful objects move back and forth across your screen and then nothing happens here's a clip of one of the weekends more interesting matches by way of example mesmerizing that's it for this week's world cup recap Michael scaramouch scaramouch will you do the Fandango back to you Jeremy that was such an informative recap of the World Cup I really appreciate that you know we were talking a little bit there about a Germany's strategy I was underrated about that I was under the impression that a Germany strategy was to have their competition in the World Cup last a thousand years but it seems to have been cut short should we fear the the the German soccer team rising up again within say I don't know four to seven years well Michael historically they always have fortunately for us the brave men and women of Western Europe who formerly gave the world the British Empire and complex manly sports such as cricket and wealthy sports such as polo will undoubtedly seek a peace for our time and appease Germany all the way to future catastrophe the one does wonder if we should just dismantle the German soccer team once and for all but it seems to me that the international community just no no no they have the right to pride as a nation and we shouldn't stand in their way all they're looking for is a little breathing room mm-hmm that's absolutely right you know Jeremy we've heard a lot of from the left about how awful Russia is these days and and the United States colluded with Russia but they're hosting this most wonderful and important international sporting event should we just give them a free pass well obviously this sportscaster doesn't know much about politics but I will say that of all the things that Donald Trump has done that have offended those in the former never Trump contingent perhaps winning the World Cup for the United States America eight years hence is the worst and the greatest proof that he seeks to follow in the footsteps of mass murderer flaten amir putin in reducing the world down to a sort of pre civilizational hell from which even jordan be Peterson's philosophy may not be able to save us i'll have to reread alexander solzhenitsyn it's been a while since I've gone into Gulag Archipelago jeremy the god-king boring from daily wire to a very important update and basically has convinced me now to go nevertrump jeremy thanks for being here we'll talk to you soon scarab mooch
