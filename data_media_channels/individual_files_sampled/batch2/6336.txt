so there's a lot of folks calling for resignations including myself I thought there should be mass resignations in the Trump White House after he said there were good people on the neo-nazi side I show you some of those good people in a second and and he said well I mean both sides are culpable when a Nazi ran over protests counter protesters injured 19 people and murdered Heather hire those were unconscionable comments from a man who is clearly bigoted and racist and at what point do you draw the line well apparently a lot of Stephen hooches classmates from back in the day at Yale are asking him that question privately so he did a public post where he answered them he said I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way shape or form believes that neo-nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful unlawful ways well first of all when you have to remind people that the president is not a neo Nazi sympathizer you're already in a world of trouble that should not have to be clarified but in this case it does have to be clarified and by the way he's absolutely not correct when he says in no way shape or form does the president believe that because he had a giant press conference where he blamed the other side and he did draw a moral equivalency as clear as day we covered a lot to show you can go back and watch the videos both sides he said to word fault he said there's very very violent people among the counter protesters the people who were actually killed it's absolutely outrageous so minuchin is lying there try to save his own ass and he points out he says look I'm an American of Jewish heritage and background and so I wouldn't stay in the administration if I thought he was with neo-nazis so you claim but that power mmm it is addicting he went on to say I don't believe the allegations against the president are accurate and I believe that having highly talented men and women in our country sir I'm the president his administration should be reassuring to you that's a subtle hint to those guys hey if you think it's bad with me and the rest of the folks inside the administration imagine what would happen if we left then the idiot would be on his own too even more damaged boy really reassuring that that's the guy you're working for so minuchin says that the president was not equivocating we know he was I just wanna give you a sense of why his classmates are concerned remember Donald Trump said there are very good people on the side of the original protestors the white nationalist protestors so I want to show you a piece from a vice documentary we'll have the link to the full documentary below and it is great where they were chanting on Friday night yes they've got the torches at a white nationalist get-together that already should have been a giant clue if it wasn't they did this okay you guys you see the guys in the Nazi haircuts and the Nazi Flags the symbols maybe you don't know what those symbols stand for and you certainly don't know what the haircut stands for then they hand you a torch at a white nationalist parade if you're anywhere near abusive person you've already exited the building but maybe you're the dumbest person aligning you don't know what those torches represent when in the context of white nationalism then they start chanting you will not replace this you're confused by that chant what do you mean who's you and who's us and then they start chanting blood and soil well that's an old Nazi Champa maybe you're ignorant of that as well well when they get to Jews will not replace us and you're still in the March man I don't think it becomes a little harder to make the case even if you're the dumbest person alive that you were a very fine person and you happen to go there and now okay man we were just having fun chanting Jews a lot of places no we know exactly who was on that side and Trump is still defending those guys to this day so minuchin not leaving will be a great stain on his record which already has plenty of stains let alone everyone involved now Axios broke down after talking to a lot of Trump staffers and including senior staffers why they're staying so here's one excuse that we're using general mattis needs us so that's not an actual quote by somebody but it's the idea that they're trying to convey many talk about their reluctance to bolt on their friends and colleagues who are fighting the good fight to force better Trump behavior decisions they rightly point out that together they have learned how to ignore Trump's rhetoric and at times collectively serum to more conventional policy responses in other words same thing as Steve minuchin intimating if you think he's bad with us you should get a load of him without us the guy's a total idiot and without Jim mattis the Secretary of Defense and all of us to contain him he'll even be more childlike more of a Aaron and more of a danger to the Republic Wow very comforting okay and now they're excused now there's a full-blown excuses shrubs not as evil as portrayed all of them talk up the president is more reasonable off Twitter and TV than on it this gives them hope though almost all increasingly say it's a fleeting hope he will listen to his better angels or at least the police of evanka hope against hope now that is the audacity of hope' no Trump is not going to listen to his better angels he doesn't have any better angels he is a white nationalist at heart himself he's always been racist what he did to the Central Park five and what he continues to them is an outrage let alone Obama let alone all the racist things that he is back let alone charlottesville in his response to it there are no better angels he's not a better person off of TV or Twitter he's the same kind of madman in fact there's a thousand reports about how he's even worse to his staff behind the scenes and yells out of non-stop for problems that he created so that's nothing but nonsense all right excuse number three you have no idea how much crazy stuff we kill the most common response centers on the urgent importance of having smart seeing people around Trump to fight his worst impulses if they weren't there they say we would have a trade war with China massive deportations and a government shutdown to force construction of a southern wall if you have to explain to a reporter that if we leave our president will destroy the country there's a good chance you're working for the wrong guy that you hurt you have a much better chance of serving the country not by helping that guy but coming out and declare openly what you know about the president what you've been hiding about the president the whole time and telling people this guy is a danger to the Republic so don't give me any BS about oh no you all want you're trying to help the country by working for this madman there's a much better way of helping the country it's by getting rid of that madman of course in legal and political ways and finally there is a little bit of honesty some said in essence we like the power it's not a direct quote but listen to what they had to say summarize by Michael Annett Axios well no one comes out and says that this blatantly but working the white house even this one is intoxicating an ego stroking they have enormous say over regulations and rules invites and implementation government jobs and access to the Oval they also know they are one step away from an even bigger job in government so it's hard to just walk away by the way there's so much attrition and for Trump fire so many people that if they stick around they might get promoted higher and higher and higher and then digging when they become a lobbyist they can say do you know what kind of senior position I had at the White House now pay me let me just assure you that's actually the number one reason that they're staying at the Trump White House everything else is ancillary and besides which doesn't help their cause of the rest of it is basically an admission that they work for an incompetent madman and they've still to this they have not resigned in great shame which is exactly what they should do Young Turks if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT
