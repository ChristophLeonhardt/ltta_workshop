STEVE: IT HAS BEEN ONE OF
THE DEMOCRATS' RALLYING
CRIES SINCE DAY ONE.
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT.
NOW ONE HARVARD LAW
PROFESSOR TAKING IT TO A
WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.
>> YOU CAN'T BE THE BOY WHO
CRIED WOLF AND EXPECT TO
HAVE A VIABLE IMPEACHMENT
POWER.
YOU CAN'T USE IT OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.
AGAINST THE SAME PRESIDENT.
>> RIGHT.
>> IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT
HIM, HAVE YOU GOT TO SHOOT
THE TAIL.
STEVE: WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE?
HERE TO WEIGH IN COLUMNIST
FOR THE HILL JOE CONCHA.
JOE, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
>> HOW ARE YOU?
STEVE: DOING BETTER THAN HE
IS HE WAS OUT PROMOTING NEW
IMPEACHMENT BOOK AND HE
REALLY STEPPED IN IT?
>> IT APPEARS SO.
WHAT HE HAS STEPPED IN IS
BASICALLY NOT A LOT OF
CONTROVERSY IN TERMS OF
PRESIDENT PRESS HOLDING HIM
TO ACCOUNT FOR MAKING THAT
REMARK.
THERE IS AFFLICTION, STEVE
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS
SWEEPING THE ENTIRE NATION
AND THAT THE INFLICTION OF
SELECTIVE OUTRAGE.
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS I GO
BAG TO AUGUST OF 2016.
CANDIDATE TRUMP.
HE BRINGS UP THE RIGHT TO
BEAR APARTMENTS.
HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED
THE JUDGES SHE APPOINTS TO
THE SUPREME COURT CAN TAKE
THAT SECOND AMENDMENT AWAY
OR AT LEAST CHANGE IT AND HE
SAYS AND I QUOTE.
IF SHE GETS TO PICK HER
JUDGES, NOTHING TO DO.
SECOND AMENDMENT PEOPLE
MAYBE THERE IS.
HE LATER SAYS PRO-SECOND
AMENDMENT CITIZENS MUST
ORGANIZE AND GET OUT TO VOTE
TO SAVE OUR CONSTITUTION.
HERE ARE THE HEADLINES THAT
WERE A RESULT OF TRUMP JUST
SAYING THAT.
STEVE: THAT WAS BIG.
>> MY GOSH.
HUFFINGTON POST DONALD TRUMP
SUGGESTS SHOOTING HILLARY
CLINTON, HER SUPREME COURT
PICKS OR BOTH.
SECOND AMENDMENT COMMENT CAN
NONT EXCUSED.
THE POINT IS IF A REPUBLICAN
OR A CONSERVATIVE SAYS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
THE CONDEMNATION IS
OVERWHELMING, IF IT HAPPENS
WITH SOMEBODY LIKE LAWRENCE
TRIBE WHO IS A HARVARD LAW
PROFESSOR.
STEVE: FRIENDS WITH THE
OBAMAS AND SELECTIVE
OUTRAGE.
>> SWEEPING THE COUNTRY LIKE
THE MACARENA 1996.
MACARENA.
STEVE: HE DID TO HIS CREDIT
APOLOGIZE.
HE WROTE THIS ON TWITTER
OTHERWISE GOOD INTERVIEW I
MADE A TERRIBLE WORD CHOICE
SAYING IMPEACHMENT BULLET
CAN ONLY BE SHOT ONCE.
SO, ONE MUST SHOOT TO KILL.
I WASN'T SPEAKING LITERALLY
BUT HARD TO REDUCE GUN
VIOLENCE.
THIS WAS INEXCUSABLE VERY
SORRY.
>> VERY TRUMPIAN AND
OTHERWISE GOOD INTERVIEW.
YOU COULD LEAVE THAT PART
OUT WHEN DOING THE APOLOGY.
STEVE: I REMEMBER THE TIME
SARAH PALIN GOT IN TROUBLE
SELECTIVE OUTRAGE GRAPHIC
CAMPAIGN THINGS BEFORE
GABRIEL GIFFORDS WAS SHOT
DOWN IN ARIZONA.
NONETHELESS, THE OUTRAGE WAS
INTENSE.
>> TO THE POINT WHERE WHEN
GABRIEL GIFFORDS AND THE
HORRIBLE SHOOTING THAT
HAPPENED IN ARIZONA, SARAH
PALIN WAS BLAMED DIRECTLY
BECAUSE SHE HAD CAMPAIGN
FLIERS OUT SAYING THAT THESE
DISTRICTS ARE IN THE
CROSSHAIRS.
STEVE: TO YOUR POINT THE
OUTRAGE WAS THERE BECAUSE
SHE WAS A CONSERVATIVE.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
LOOK, WE SEE KATHY GRIFFIN.
REMEMBER, SHE HELD UP A
LIKENESS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
STEVE: RIGHT.
THIS WAS EXACTLY A YEAR AGO.
SHE IS ON THE VIEW JUST TWO
WEEKS AGO GETTING A STOPPING
OVATION WHILE MOST OF THE
HOSTS ON THAT SHOW WERE
APPLAUDING HER FOR WHAT SHE
DID.
REMEMBER SHAKESPEARE IN THE
PARK JUST LAST SUMMER?
GRAPHICALLY MURDERING THE
PRESIDENT BASICALLY ON
STAGE?
STANDING OVATIONS EVERY
NIGHT AND THE PRESS
DEFINITED IT.
THE POINT IS THIS IS THE NEW
NORMAL IT NEVER WOULD HAVE
BEEN IN A BILLION YEARS A
NEW NORMAL UNDER THE
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IF
THIS WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA.
STEVE: EXIT QUESTION, IS IT
PART OF THE PROBLEM THE FACT
THAT SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA ARE
DEMOCRATS?
OR LEAN THAT WAY?
>> OH, WELL, THEY DEFINITELY
LEAN THAT WAY AND JUST TO
WRAP UP HERE, 91% OF ALL
COVERAGE OF THIS PRESIDENT
HAS BEEN NEGATIVE SINCE HE
HAS TAKEN OFFICE.
THAT'S PEW, THAT'S MEDIA
WITH THIS SORT OF RHETORIC
BECAUSE OF HOT TARGET, NO
PUN INTENDED IS.
