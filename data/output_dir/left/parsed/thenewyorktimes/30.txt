When I started my brief
and sloppy drag career
as Anita Lane Bryant
in Madison, Wis.,
back in 2009, you could find
some drag tutorials online.
But the best way to learn how
to apply a fake lash, glue
down your eyebrows, or make hip
pads out of couch cushions,
was to head to the
nearest gay bar
and try to get into a drag
queen’s good graces.
“Simply go up to them and say,
oh my gosh, you’re amazing.
Can you be my drag mother?”
But since then, drag has
exploded on the internet.
Tucking used to be something
that drag queens whispered
about to one another.
But today, searching
how to tuck on YouTube
yields 2.4 million
search results.
If you’re trying to figure
out how to tuck in your shirt
or do flips on a
trampoline, those videos
are buried under these videos.
“The tucking panty holds
everything in place.”
Drag queens are no longer
just club performers
or titillating
talk show guests.
Online, they’re makeup
instructors, dance coaches,
storytellers and
international ambassadors
of being yourself.
“Just be yourself.”
“Be yourself.
It’s so easy.”
“Don’t you think I
should just be myself?”
It’s easy to see
the upside here.
“It gets better.”
“It actually does.”
And feel good video content
marketed to queers and allies
promotes the idea that drag
isn’t just for cis gay men,
it’s open to people of all
genders, all sexualities
and all ages.
But if internet has changed
how drag is produced —
“Work diva.”
— it’s also changing
how it’s consumed.
Queer internet
culture promotes drag
as an art form that’s
available to anyone.
“Anyone can do any
type of drag, no matter
what gender or anything.”
Which also means an
unprecedented number
of straight people are
consuming a queer art form.
Of course, queens have
performed for and profited
from straight
audiences for as long
as there have been queens.
“Well, you said you
wanted to go to slumming,
so I picked a place to
eat in the Village.”
But curious
straight folks used
to have to schlep to
a gay bar or drag club
if they wanted to
walk on the wildside.
Now, the world’s most
popular drag show
is no longer at a gay bar.
It streams on VH1.com, if
you happen to know someone
with a cable password.
“RuPaul’s Drag Race” has been
on the air for 10 seasons —
13, if you count “All
Stars” — and has launched
the careers of
126 drag queens,
spawned spin-offs, won
Emmys and subjected us
to dozens of dance anthems
by its contestants.
It’s hard to say whether
“RuPaul’s Drag Race” is
a cause or a consequence
of the rise of drag
on the internet, but
RuPaul has become
the online avatar for drag.
When queer culture can
exist without queer space,
it can reach more people.
But when queer
culture is entirely
stripped of queer context,
it becomes something else.
“Ew.
Get off of me.”
In some ways, the
internet has allowed drag
to thrive more than ever.
“My friend Julie is turning
me into a drag queen.”
Along the way, doing
drag has become
a social experiment or a fun
stunt to post on socials.
“All the
single furries.
All the single furries.”
When any group develops
an online community,
it means that insiders can
connect to that subculture
more easily.
“What the hell is
that supposed to be?
The one on the right’s
not even synced.”
But so can outsiders.
That means that, you know,
professional internet critics
can make online
videos about you
for major news publications.
It also means that people
can admire, commodify,
ridicule and, uh, demonize
your subculture just as
handily.
“This drag queen demon
reading to the kids.”
“This man dressed
like a female demon — ”
“These drag queens,
man, just destroying
the whole wide world.
You can’t even tell if
that’s a man or a woman,
but that’s a man
dressed like a woman.”
The good news is that drag
has never been so accessible.
“Does anyone know
what a drag queen is?”
“A drag queen is someone
who express themselves.”
The bad news is that drag
has never been so accessible.
“The hips on the drag queen
go swish, swish, swish,
swish, swish, swish.”
“Hey, this is Amanda.”
“This is Shane.”
“He edits the videos.”
“She writes the videos.”
“Except for this video.”
“I wrote this video.”
“And if you like this video,
like, comment and subscribe.”
“And tell us, how much should we tolerate 
bachelorette parties at drag shows?”
“Answer in the comments.”
“We are very thirsty.”
