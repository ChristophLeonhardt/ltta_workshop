on Wednesday night 17 Democrats joined with almost every Senate Republican to pass what's being called the bank lobbyist act it's a bill that would raise the threshold under which banks are subject to certain requirements of dodd-frank from fifty billion dollars up to two hundred and fifty billion dollars and when you move it up to two hundred fifty billion dollars that means that almost every bank in the country except the very biggest ones are no longer going to be given stress tests and and and put under the other kinds of regulatory pressure that dodd-frank applied to try to prevent the next financial crisis now of those seventeen Democrats it turns out that seven of them stand to personally profit through their investments in some of those banks and we know this because of the investigative reporting of TYT contributor Alex Koch who's who's joining us here today to talk about this Alex what what what did you find when you started looking through the personal finances of some of these Democrats who ended up voting for this Bank lobbyists Act yeah well I mean I started with Heidi Heitkamp because she was the chief Democratic architect of the bill she worked with Mike Crapo and several others on both sides to craft this bipartisan bill and wasn't didn't take me too long digging into her financial records to find that she and her husband collectively owned about two hundred and fifty up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in JPMorgan stock and up to about six hundred thousand dollars in Berkshire Hathaway stock that's the the company owned by Warren Buffett which operates numerous subsidiaries including one that makes manufactured homes and another that a couple others that actually give the loans to to buyers of these types of homes they're also going to benefit from the bill and I should say that you know JP Morgan BEC like that is they have more than two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of assets but are there other provisions that you know you guys revealed at the intercept that are going to help banks that size - so how exactly is Berkshire Hathaway been in here so you said that they aren't they that there are the owners of a company that makes mobile homes that makes trailer homes and that makes for people to buy these these trailer homes so what does the bill do that will help that would help warren buffett's fund here right well so it first of all it may it lets manufactured home or mobile home sellers steer customers towards their own lending businesses and into some of the types of bad loans that led to the 2008 financial crash so that's one thing another thing is for smaller banks but it's also it also has to do with these mortgage issues smaller banks that give 500 or fewer loans for these types of mortgages per year are going to be allowed to not report some key data including racial data that the consumer financial section bureau since the dodd-frank act in 2010 has been using to try to make sure there's not discrimination in housing all right so after a year in which the media has been talking about the narrative of the white working-class elevating populism into the White House you're telling me that Congress is responding by screwing people who own trailer homes and squeezing every last drop of money out of a person whose situation has put them in a place that they that they're moving to a trailer park anyway I mean it sure sounds like that and you have financial experts like Elizabeth Warren who really was the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau saying that there's literally nothing redeemable about this legislation and you have people like Tim Kaine who doesn't have investments in these companies but is from the purple or even blue state of Virginia who voted for the bill who in the past has spoken out against racism signing onto this bill that isn't almost encouraging more racism in the mortgage business yeah and not not just speaking out about it Tim Kaine and on the campaign trail he talked about this a lot he's very proud of this his his legal career began as a as an attorney fighting for fair lending and fighting against discrimination in in the mortgage market it's kind of his his touchstone achievement in his in his political career to see him voting for this bill that undermines the ability to to enforce fair lending laws is quite remarkable heidi heitkamp who was one of the lead authors of the bill you laid out pretty well what about some of some of the other six Democrats what kind of investments do they have right so Claire McCaskill of Missouri she's another vulnerable Democrat in other words she's running for reelection this year and in a kind of a red state but she and her husband collectively owned over a million dollars of stock in Berkshire Hathaway so that's a pretty large investment you've got Gary Peters of Michigan who owns up to 250,000 dollars worth of stock and five of these big banks including the Bank of America BB&T the Swiss bank UBS which has a lot of billions of dollars of US assets etc you've got Joe Manchin of West Virginia who whose spouse owns 100 up to $100,000 worth of Huntington Bank share stock that's another bank that's in this threshold between 250 billion and excuse me between 50 billion and 250 billion in total assets a so-called stadium bank doug jones you know the latest addition to the Senate on the Democratic side he owns up to $100,000 of Regions Financial Corporation stock it's another one of these stadium banks the independent angus King of Maine owns up to 50,000 in US Bancorp stock and Tom Carper of Delaware owns up to 45,000 in Bank of America Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo stock so and they call them stadium banks because they're there they're not not big enough to be the kind of the JP Morgan's or the or the city groups but they are big enough that that you see their names on on stadiums PNC or M&T Bank and so the congressional staff have taken to calling them stadium banks to kind of distinguish them from community community banks but Alex why is this legal what what what what are that the ethics and the laws in place that would allow members of Congress to hold investments and then cast votes that would benefit their their investments I'm sure people watching might think that sounds like get ought to be illegal right it sure does and if you if you kind of some of the ethics rules you might still come out thinking that it's it's it's illegal but in fact it's perfectly legal what they did what the Senate Ethics manual says is that you know if you're a legislator and you're working on a bill or you're voting on a bill you're not supposed to participate if you the principal purpose of the bill is to benefit a specific limited class of people which generally can be interpreted as you yourself or your family so a very small number of people or one one sole company so you can't have you can't appropriate money directly to yourself but otherwise you're good well yeah because the the loophole here is that this bill like like the tax bill before it which had a similar situation with these financial conflicts of interest applies to larger classes of banks larger classes of businesses larger classes of people clearly the upper classes of an economic ladder so so it's fine what they're doing because they're not the only beneficiaries of this legislation and one way out of this might be to not have so many rich people in Congress and maybe we'll get there eventually michael kinsley a long time Washington reporter once once said that the the scandal is not what people are doing that's illegal the scandal is what people are doing that is perfectly legal and I think your story here is a perfect example of that Alex Koch thanks so much for joining us great reporting here on TYT investigates if you're watching this make sure to subscribe to t whitey investigates share this with
