Amnesty International is accusing the us-led coalition of committing potential war crimes during last year's operation to liberate the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic state the rights group says the strong evidence that America and its partners used indiscriminate and disproportionate force and that the impact was catastrophic let's go live to our correspondent Anastacio Churkin has got more on this nasty hi there I've just looked through the precis of what amnesty got in its 70 page report what happened last June to October just sounds cataclysmic well indeed Colin this Amnesty International report dubbed war of annihilation devastating tolls and civilians in Raqqa Syria is a very highly critical analysis of the airstrikes that were carried out by the us-led coalition that involved Britain and France on the city of Raqqa from June to October 2017 in their fight against Isis and this Amnesty International report talks of decimated families and neighborhoods says that not enough was done to protect civilians and that some of the attacks resulted in violation of international humanitarian law and indeed talks of potential war crimes as a result of the these strikes the report finds that hundreds of people died and thousands were injured despite the coalition saying they did everything they could to minimize casualties you know when you're you're fighting an enemy that uses non-combatants as collateral damage you know it's very difficult when you when you fight an enemy like that to to completely avoid any casualties of war like that but I can tell you we have a process that we go through it's is to minimize you know civilian casualties at all cost the coalition's claims that it's precision air campaigns allowed it to bump Islamic state out of Raqqa while causing very few civilian casualties do not stand up to scrutiny on the ground in Raqqa we witnessed a level of destruction comparable to anything we've seen in decades of covering the impact of worse well while while seeing that level of destruction Amnesty said they went to as many as 42 sites and into a hundred and twelve civilians that were witnesses to those strikes and focused particularly on four families and one of those families eight people for eight family members died in one single airstrike 16 in another 18 and another and there was a family that lost 39 members as a result of those strikes so as the coalition forces indeed do say that they did all they're all the best they could and try to do whatever was possible to minimize casualties indeed we're seeing in this report that basically says that was just not good enough and they have called for investigations and justice for the victims of those strikes I'll be reading through it just looking through the military terminology the legal terminology is what those families say they went through that really is that the toughest parts to read in that report okay will be a cross reaction be back with you if we get any for now though anastacio Churkin in London thanks for that
