a critical requirement to actually prosecute an individual it's this notion of mens rea uh they have a guilty mind and prosecutors need to show that there was that intent to actually do something wrong simply being reckless or having oversight is in most instances the United States not something that's going to land you in prison you can you can overlook wrongdoing what they need to show you the show is that you had the intent to actually do something wrong and the best way to nail someone is an email mocking as in the case of one one person from Goldman Sachs mocking from the investors who is selling it to that makes prosecutors like very very easy
