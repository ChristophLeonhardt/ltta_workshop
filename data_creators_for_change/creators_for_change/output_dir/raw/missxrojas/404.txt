00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,259
wilderness there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a few animal</font>

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,109
sightings so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> but very very few and</font>

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,359
far between and they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> keen to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bridge because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

look of some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's kind of</font>

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,740
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're at right now I've identified</font>

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,150
all of the water sources such as this

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,800
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems to be yeah signs of other</font>

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,329
life but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really encountered it</font>

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,610
so far so we'll be seeing you know how

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,290
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes and I'd really like to see</font>

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,180
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these natural creatures of this</font>

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,980
environment in their natural habitat I

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,870
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get the feeling just from the</font>

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ye'd just the isolation this is a</font>

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,730
closely guarded environment where you

22
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">know strangers maybe are not quite so</font>

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,420
welcome Hugh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and faces not quite so</font>

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,960
desirable etc the hostility of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,730
environment exemplified by these dead

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,590
flowers ground the natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by some</font>

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,359
beast is what struck me most the

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,709
creatures were unfriendly or perhaps

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,140
fearful with good reason every facet of

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,479
life seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be agitated stressed even</font>

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,890
observe for example the squirrel

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,689
creature at war with this tree

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,470
so teams as land has them so far got a

34
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,420
reputation for trickery because i was

35
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,720
using their<font color="#E5E5E5"> their drinking devices there</font>

36
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,149
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> their quenching devices in order to</font>

37
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:34,220
get myself something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drink in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub</font>

38
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">something native to the land and I press</font>

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,440
the d8 coke option and it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,710
something called sprite doesn't start

41
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,600
diet coke the representative of society

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,950
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trickery kind of leads down</font>

43
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,310
into into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machinery really like</font>

44
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,189
maybe it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> country where it's a</font>

45
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:57,259
man versus machine don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know during</font>

00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,179
this expedition<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also had the privilege</font>

47
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,250
of observing the cat yet another

48
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,929
struggle against the demands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

49
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,720
machine to fuel itself this<font color="#E5E5E5"> rarely cited</font>

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,030
creature devoured orange fruit what

51
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,440
looked like some sort of book also

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
appeared to be a source of some great

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:00:00,000
anxiety why we can only hazard a guess
