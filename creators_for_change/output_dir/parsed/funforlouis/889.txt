hi guys my name is shanece and I live in
Charleston South Carolina and you're
watching fun for Louie boom good morning
guys so I slept in today it's it's gone
midday so actually it's not morning
these guys have been waiting down at the
lobby for me for ages and I kept them
waiting anyway we're heading for
breakfast now but as we came out the
hotel and there's this big procession
going on it's apparently Palm Sunday I
don't know but we've just missed there's
like guys marching and they just like
walked off down there how old are you
blue Klux Klan II did these costumes
I'm fascinated by what this is I
thankfully understand is anyone know the
tradition here and why people are
dressed up wonder in the cake okay
please let me know I hope it isn't
related
it looks very similar
now whether or not this is a harmless
religious tradition or not
this
dodgy he's left me feeling very uneasy
I know there's you know there's such
thing about preserving culture tradition
guys caught her address
well I certainly don't blame these guys
for leaving in that position
we've sat down to have some lunch and
I've been researching up on this whole
procession thing apparently it's been
happening in Bilbao since 15:53 it's a
medieval tradition and it was later
adopted by the KKK which is just really
unfortunate the people involved here I
think but maybe in Spain it's not a big
deal but I just think globally it's it's
definitely something identified with an
extremely racist group kind of bashing
them right
Matt's got an something estate thing me
and David are showing this massive
paella
well that looks yummy dessert has
arrived white chocolate chocolate mousse
and that pie which they called apple
cake in the menu but you know close
enough
we go back in lunch and we're all
feeling pretty tired we've got a few
hours to kill so we thought would just
come and cheer in the hotel lobby and
play some cards
the procession are coming past again
all right time to head off that's it
alright man is off Oh miss miss his
flight we were just sitting in chatting
and then he realized he's like wait I
think maybe that was my flight but
luckily people are still boarding so I
think he's fine

London I've just grabbed from dinner
bloggers rendering and my flight is

and then me and Darcy are about to do
some cooking some baking hey Darcy what
we making Darcy
I love to Lawrence
check in there stop wait there's only a
200 a up
there's different textures in there boyo
could it be if you can be bothered to
juice an orange to do that are you
voting we just pour some of this in
there these are just some extra
flavorings to kind of enhance the cake
but we've got the essentials like orange
for the chopper orange cake and vanilla
but then we're maybe gonna go in to do
some caramel and honey this is my weapon
of choice to attack these oranges
so I googled what the equivalent amount
you can't pour it back now okay there's
got flour in it yes that's very true
I'm finished listing the oranges and
dots you can add some glazed mixed peel
yeah guys I forgot to show you in the
post I got this fluffy things but my
camera saw Roman Atwood had one so I'm
gonna try it because then I can be
outside in the wind and you'll be able
to hear me
because there's so many times I can't
vlog cause it's too windy
this smells incredible smell that we've
got some chocolates we just have to
break this very very delicately into
some small little chunks
and if you have to chop okay with a
knife check this out guys this is our
chocolate chunks I'm gonna hurt ya we
are almost done I just need to taste
this Darcy is preheated the oven at 180
degrees Celsius just to let you guys
know it is past 2:00 a.m. the perfect
time to do some baking I think amazing

gonna screw it on this well I've had a
very enjoyable night hanging out with
