00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,280
BORDER, WERE YOU ABLE TO GET ANY ANSWERS AS TO WHY THEY’RE

49

50
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:31,381

00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,417
>> NO. I MEAN, OUR TRIP TO THE BORDER

53
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,385
I MEAN, OUR TRIP TO THE BORDER WAS REALLY TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT’S

54
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,387
WAS REALLY TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT’S HAPPENING.

55
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,556
HAPPENING. BUT WE DID HAVE A BRIEFING, A

56
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,757
BUT WE DID HAVE A BRIEFING, A CLOSED DOOR BRIEFING THE OTHER

57
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,091
CLOSED DOOR BRIEFING THE OTHER DAY.

58
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,261
DAY. AND WE DID NOT GET ANSWERS FROM

59
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,896
AND WE DID NOT GET ANSWERS FROM CVP AND I.C.E. AND HOMELAND

60
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,466
CVP AND I.C.E. AND HOMELAND SECURITY AND HHS OTHER THAN TO

61
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,802
SECURITY AND HHS OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT THEY ARE DECIDING

62
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:52,503
SAY THAT THEY ARE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT THESE CHILDREN

63
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,706
WHETHER OR NOT THESE CHILDREN GET TO GO BACK TO THEIR PARENTS,

64
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,308
GET TO GO BACK TO THEIR PARENTS, WHICH IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS.

65
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,244
WHICH IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS. BECAUSE THESE KIDS WERE RIPPED

66
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:00,912
BECAUSE THESE KIDS WERE RIPPED FROM THEIR PARENTS’ ARMS.

67
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:01,979
FROM THEIR PARENTS’ ARMS. THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT THEY

68
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,680
THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT THEY BE REUNITED.

69
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,482
BE REUNITED. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ALREADY

70
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:05,917
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ALREADY MISSED THE FIRST DEADLINE FOR

71
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:06,417
MISSED THE FIRST DEADLINE FOR CHILDREN UNDER 5.

72
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,319
CHILDREN UNDER 5. AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKELY THAT

73
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,754
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKELY THAT THEY’RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

74
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,222
THEY’RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE ALL OF THESE FAMILIES

75
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,990
REUNITE ALL OF THESE FAMILIES AND SO PART OF THE ARGUMENT THEY

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,326
AND SO PART OF THE ARGUMENT THEY SEEM TO BE MAKING IS WELL THERE

77
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,329
SEEM TO BE MAKING IS WELL THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF FAMILIES,

78
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,030
ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF FAMILIES, PARENTS WHO DON’T DESERVE TO

79
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,931
PARENTS WHO DON’T DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN BACK FOR ONE

80
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,399
HAVE THEIR CHILDREN BACK FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER.

81
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,001
REASON OR ANOTHER. I CAN TELL YOU JOY, THAT IT WAS

82
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,837
I CAN TELL YOU JOY, THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING.

83
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,272
ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING. I WILL TELL YOU THAT FAMILIES

84
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,407
I WILL TELL YOU THAT FAMILIES ARE STILL BEING SEPARATED.

85
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:32,043
ARE STILL BEING SEPARATED. I WENT WITH A GROUP OF EIGHT

86
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:36,047
I WENT WITH A GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND WE WENT

87
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,349
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND WE WENT TO THE PROCESSING CENTER, THE

88
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:39,817
TO THE PROCESSING CENTER, THE EPICENTER OF WHERE THE KIDS ARE

89
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:40,952
EPICENTER OF WHERE THE KIDS ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR

90
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:41,319
BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS.

91
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:41,953
PARENTS. THAT IS STILL HAPPENING.

92
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:43,922
THAT IS STILL HAPPENING. IN THE PROCESSING CENTER, WHICH

93
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,557
IN THE PROCESSING CENTER, WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE 16,000 SQUARE

94
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,358
IS SOMETHING LIKE 16,000 SQUARE FEET, A HUGE FACILITY, THIS IS

95
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,227
FEET, A HUGE FACILITY, THIS IS WHERE THE KIDS ARE IN CAGES.

96
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,562
WHERE THE KIDS ARE IN CAGES. THEY’RE STILL IN CAGES, FIRST OF

97
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,164
THEY’RE STILL IN CAGES, FIRST OF ALL, IMPORTANT THAT THE AMERICAN

98
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,565
ALL, IMPORTANT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

99
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,134
PEOPLE KNOW THAT. SECONDLY, IF THE CHILDREN ARE

100
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,969
SECONDLY, IF THE CHILDREN ARE OVER TEN, THEY ARE PLACED IN

101
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,138
OVER TEN, THEY ARE PLACED IN CAGES ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE

102
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,073
CAGES ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE FACILITY SEPARATED FROM THEIR

103
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:02,407
FACILITY SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS.

104
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,375
PARENTS. THEIR PARENTS ONLY HAVE ONE HOUR

105
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:05,944
THEIR PARENTS ONLY HAVE ONE HOUR A DAY THAT THEY’RE ALLOWED TO

106
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,278
A DAY THAT THEY’RE ALLOWED TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN AND WE WERE

107
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:09,213
SEE THEIR CHILDREN AND WE WERE TOLD, ACTUALLY, THAT THAT HOUR

108
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,750
TOLD, ACTUALLY, THAT THAT HOUR IS SOMETHING LIKE 6:00 IN THE

109
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,083
IS SOMETHING LIKE 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

110
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,685
MORNING. IN ADDITION, IF YOU’RE NOT A

111
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,086
IN ADDITION, IF YOU’RE NOT A PARENT, THEN THE COURT ORDER

112
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,621
PARENT, THEN THE COURT ORDER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.

113
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:19,891
DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU. SO WE SAT ON THE FLOOR WITH A

114
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:21,826
SO WE SAT ON THE FLOOR WITH A SOBBING GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD COME

115
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,796
SOBBING GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD COME HERE WITH HER GRANDSON,

116
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,398
HERE WITH HER GRANDSON, 7-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON, HAD NOT

117
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:27,799
7-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON, HAD NOT SEEN THAT CHILD FOR FOUR DAYS,

118
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,567
SEEN THAT CHILD FOR FOUR DAYS, WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER.

119
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:31,369
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER. DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THAT CHILD

120
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,872
DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THAT CHILD IS AND SHE RAISED HIM.

121
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,707
IS AND SHE RAISED HIM. SHE’S EFFECTIVELY BEEN HIS

122
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:36,107
SHE’S EFFECTIVELY BEEN HIS PARENT.

123
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:38,176
PARENT. WE SAW SIBLINGS, IF YOU’RE OVER

124
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:39,377
WE SAW SIBLINGS, IF YOU’RE OVER 18 YEARS OLD AND THEN YOU COME

125
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,380
18 YEARS OLD AND THEN YOU COME WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD, YOU ARE

126
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,814
WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD, YOU ARE SEPARATED AS WELL.

127
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:45,083
SEPARATED AS WELL. SO THIS TRAGEDY, THIS CRISIS

128
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,318
SO THIS TRAGEDY, THIS CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT ON BY THE

129
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,121
THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT ON BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S CRUEL AND

130
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,557
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S CRUEL AND INHUMANE ZERO TOLERANCE, ZERO

131
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,125
INHUMANE ZERO TOLERANCE, ZERO HUMANITY POLICY IS STILL GOING

132
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:55,394
HUMANITY POLICY IS STILL GOING ON EVEN AS THE COURT IS ORDERING

133
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:56,929
ON EVEN AS THE COURT IS ORDERING FAMILIES TO BE REUNITED.

134
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,632
FAMILIES TO BE REUNITED. IT WAS HORRIFIC AND WE -- IT’S

135
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,334
IT WAS HORRIFIC AND WE -- IT’S HARD TO FIND THE WORDS, JOY.

136
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:04,636
HARD TO FIND THE WORDS, JOY. WE MET WITH ONE SET OF PARENTS

137
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:06,438
WE MET WITH ONE SET OF PARENTS WHO HAD JUST BEEN REUNITED WITH

138
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:07,239
WHO HAD JUST BEEN REUNITED WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

139
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,240
THEIR CHILDREN. THEY WERE IN A SHELTER THAT’S

140
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,342
THEY WERE IN A SHELTER THAT’S RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHARITIES.

141
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,977
RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHARITIES. THE SISTER ALLOWED US TO GO IN

142
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,445
THE SISTER ALLOWED US TO GO IN AND SPEAK WITH THEM.

143
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:15,414
AND SPEAK WITH THEM. THIS BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES

144
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,648
THIS BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES EVEN AS I THINK ABOUT IT.

145
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:20,051
EVEN AS I THINK ABOUT IT. THE CHILD TOLD US, 7-YEAR-OLD

146
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,387
THE CHILD TOLD US, 7-YEAR-OLD BOY, TOLD US HE WAS TOLD BY

147
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,755
BOY, TOLD US HE WAS TOLD BY GOVERNMENT AGENTS THAT HIS

148
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:25,658
GOVERNMENT AGENTS THAT HIS MOTHER HAD ABANDONED HIM.

149
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,359
MOTHER HAD ABANDONED HIM. THAT IS WHY SHE WAS NOT THERE.

150
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,461
THAT IS WHY SHE WAS NOT THERE. AS THEY SPOKE TO US, MOTHER AND

151
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,129
AS THEY SPOKE TO US, MOTHER AND CHILD WERE WEEPING AND SO WERE

152
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,931
CHILD WERE WEEPING AND SO WERE THE REST OF US.

153
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,467
THE REST OF US. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE CHILD ABUSE

154
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:36,601
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE CHILD ABUSE GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED VIOLENCE

155
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:38,036
GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED VIOLENCE THAT WE’RE DOING TO THESE

156
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,972
THAT WE’RE DOING TO THESE CHILDREN AND TO THESE PARENTS BY

157
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,173
CHILDREN AND TO THESE PARENTS BY TELLING THEM THINGS LIKE THAT.

158
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:42,541
TELLING THEM THINGS LIKE THAT. >> THAT IS THE WORD THAT WAS

159
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:42,875
>> THAT IS THE WORD THAT WAS USED.

160
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:48,481
USED. A LOT OF THE TOX PSYCHOLOGISTS

161
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,882
A LOT OF THE TOX PSYCHOLOGISTS SAID THIS IS CHILD ABUSE.

162
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:50,649
SAID THIS IS CHILD ABUSE. IT’S BEEN DECIDE.

163
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:51,984
IT’S BEEN DECIDE. TO REITERATE, YOU’RE SAYING THAT

164
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:54,720
TO REITERATE, YOU’RE SAYING THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

165
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:55,955
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS STILL SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM

00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,957
STILL SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND STILL CAGING

167
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:58,691
THEIR PARENTS AND STILL CAGING MIGRANT CHILDREN?

168
00:04:58,734 --> 00:04:59,759
MIGRANT CHILDREN? >> ABSOLUTELY.

169
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:00,393
>> ABSOLUTELY. THESE ARE CAGES.

170
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,094
THESE ARE CAGES. WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE

171
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,331
WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS INSIDE.

172
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:05,965
PHOTOGRAPHS INSIDE. UNFORTUNATELY.

173
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,800
UNFORTUNATELY. BUT THERE ARE PICTURES THAT HAVE

174
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:08,734
BUT THERE ARE PICTURES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN.

175
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:11,204
BEEN TAKEN. THE CHILDREN ARE SEPARATED BY

176
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:11,470
THE CHILDREN ARE SEPARATED BY AGE.

177
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,007
AGE. 0 TO 10, 11 TO 15, LIKE THAT.

178
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,108
0 TO 10, 11 TO 15, LIKE THAT. BUT THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM

179
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:16,909
BUT THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS.

180
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:18,210
THEIR PARENTS. THESE PARENTS ARE NOT SEEING

181
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,480
THESE PARENTS ARE NOT SEEING THEIR CHILDREN EXCEPT FOR, YOU

182
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,782
THEIR CHILDREN EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW, AN HOUR A DAY IN THAT

183
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:23,516
KNOW, AN HOUR A DAY IN THAT FACILITY.

184
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,151
FACILITY. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN HELD FOR

185
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:28,020
MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN HELD FOR UP TO A WEEK AND PERHAPS EVEN

186
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,321
UP TO A WEEK AND PERHAPS EVEN LONGER.

187
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,490
LONGER. MOST OF THE PARENTS THAT WE MET

188
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,425
MOST OF THE PARENTS THAT WE MET WITH THAT HAD EITHER JUST BEEN

189
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:34,427
WITH THAT HAD EITHER JUST BEEN REUNITED OR WERE ABOUT TO BE

190
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:35,995
REUNITED OR WERE ABOUT TO BE REUNITED, WE ACTUALLY WATCHED

191
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,232
REUNITED, WE ACTUALLY WATCHED SOME OF THESE REUNIFICATIONS AND

192
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:41,267
SOME OF THESE REUNIFICATIONS AND IT WAS SO -- OF COURSE, JOYFUL

193
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,836
IT WAS SO -- OF COURSE, JOYFUL THAT THEY WERE BEING FINALLY

194
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,203
THAT THEY WERE BEING FINALLY REUNITED.

195
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,638
REUNITED. BUT TO SEE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT

196
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,573
BUT TO SEE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT PUT THESE FAMILIES THROUGH THIS,

197
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:48,808
PUT THESE FAMILIES THROUGH THIS, IT WAS HORRENDOUS.

198
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:50,743
IT WAS HORRENDOUS. MANY HAD NOT SEEN THEIR CHILDREN

199
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:51,410
MANY HAD NOT SEEN THEIR CHILDREN FOR TWO MONTHS.

200
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,812
FOR TWO MONTHS. THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR OVER TWO

201
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:53,146
THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR OVER TWO MONTHS.

202
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:54,247
MONTHS. DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR

203
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:54,914
DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR CHILDREN WERE.

204
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,649
CHILDREN WERE. MOST OF THE STORIES I HEARD WERE

205
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,718
MOST OF THE STORIES I HEARD WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STORIES I

206
00:05:58,728 --> 00:05:59,819
VERY SIMILAR TO THE STORIES I HEARD OVER A MONTH AGO WHEN I

207
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,722
HEARD OVER A MONTH AGO WHEN I WENT TO VISIT THOSE 176 WOMEN

208
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:03,857
WENT TO VISIT THOSE 176 WOMEN THAT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM

00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:08,895
PRISON SOUTH OF MY DISTRICT. ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:09,262
ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME. DECEPTION.

213
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:10,630
DECEPTION. THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN AWAY

214
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,366
THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN AWAY WITHOUT ANY NOTICE, NOT ALLOWED

215
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,268
WITHOUT ANY NOTICE, NOT ALLOWED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

216
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:16,569
TO SAY GOOD-BYE. WE HEARD THOSE THINGS AGAIN.

217
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:18,905
WE HEARD THOSE THINGS AGAIN. >> OH, MY GOODNESS.
