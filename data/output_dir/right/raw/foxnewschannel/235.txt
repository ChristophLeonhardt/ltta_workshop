YEARS WILL SOON BE HEADING HOME.

00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,180

14
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:28,089
JOINING US BY PHONE SENATOR

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,556
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

16
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:31,192
THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN.

17
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:32,827
THIS HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY

18
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:33,161
FOR YOU.

19
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:36,364
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE NEWS?

20
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:38,199
>> WELL, I'M PLEASED.

21
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,501
I WON'T CELEBRATE UNTIL HE GETS

22
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:39,801
HOME.

23
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:41,803
I THINK THE TRUMP

24
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:44,005
ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP

25
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:48,109
AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND

26
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,277
TRULY BIPARTISAN, SENATORS

27
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:52,047
TILLIS, LANGFORD AND SHAHEEN WE

28
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,681
VISITED PASTOR BRUNSON MONTHS

29
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:54,849
AGO IN TURKEY.

30
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,784
ALLOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

31
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:57,619
THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY TO

32
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,622
IMPROVE AND HE IS A FINE MAN,

33
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:02,057
PASTOR BRUNSON AND HIS WIFE,

34
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:04,125
AND I'M JUST GOING TO WITHHOLD

35
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:05,794
COMMENT UNTIL HE GETS HOME BUT

36
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:08,329
THIS IS A GREAT DAY AND IT

37
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,832
MAYBE STARTS A NEW BEGINNING

38
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,399
WITH THE U.S./TURKEY

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,833
RELATIONSHIP.

40
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:15,270
>> Jon: CAN YOU SAY, WAS HE

41
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,338
SIMPLY A PAWN IN THIS BATTLE

42
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:19,874
OVER THE ATTEMPTED COUP THAT

43
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,476
TRIED TO DISLODGE PRESIDENT

44
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:23,111
ERDOGAN THERE?

45
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:25,313
>> I THINK HE GOT CAUGHT UP IN

46
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:29,084
SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST NOT OF

47
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,518
HIS OWN MAKING.

48
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,387
I'VE NEVER BELIEVED ONE MINUTE

49
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:34,923
THAT PASTOR BRUNSON HAD ANY ILL

50
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:36,091
WILL TOWARD THE TURKISH

51
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:36,591
GOVERNMENT.

52
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:41,229
THERE WAS A COUP AGAINST

53
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,729
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN.

54
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,931
THE MILITARY DID TRY TO TAKE

55
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:45,400
HIM OUT AND PHYSICALLY DETAIN

56
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:45,667
HIM.

57
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:48,169
IT IS A TENSE TIME IN TURKEY

58
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,805
AND PRESIDENT BRUNSON HAS BEEN

59
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:51,639
THERE FOR 25 YEARS PREACHING

60
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,107
THE GOSPEL.

61
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,275
A SITUATION WHERE HE GOT CAUGHT

62
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:56,344
UP IN A SITUATION THAT NOT OF

63
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,213
HIS MAKING AND IT'S BEEN TWO

64
00:01:58,214 --> 00:02:00,748
LONG YEARS.

65
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,383
I VISITED HIM IN JAIL AND

66
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:05,320
TALKED TO PRESIDENT ERDOGAN

67
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:05,820
ABOUT IT.

68
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,721
THE RELATIONSHIP NEEDS TO

69
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:09,491
IMPROVE AND A GREAT STEP

70
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:09,857
FORWARD.

71
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:10,558
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE

72
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,328
PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE BEEN ALL

73
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:14,262
OVER THIS.

74
00:02:14,263 --> 00:02:15,763
SENATOR LANGFORD, TILLIS AND

75
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:16,731
SHAHEEN HAVE BEEN PUSHING HARD

76
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:18,032
FOR A LONG TIME.

77
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,667
WHEN HE GETS HOME I'LL FEEL

78
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:20,001
BETTER.

79
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:21,469
HE IS NOT HOME YET.

80
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,072
>> Sandra: SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

81
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:24,806
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC UNTIL HE

82
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:26,141
SETS FOOT ON AMERICAN SOIL.

83
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,676
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

84
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:29,711
COMMUNICATION WITH TURKEY TO

85
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,246
ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

86
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:34,215
WHAT WILL THE DISCUSSIONS AND

87
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:34,949
NEGOTIATIONS BE TO ACTUALLY

88
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,985
FACILITATE HIS RETURN?

89
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,187
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COURT

90
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:40,255
PROCEDURES ARE ALL ABOUT.

91
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,557
I THINK HE HAS BEEN CONVICTED

92
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,459
AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO BEING

93
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,528
ALLOWED TO COME HOME FOR TIME

94
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,596
SERVED.

95
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:49,764
I KNOW OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL,

96
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,866
MIKE POMPEO HAS BEEN TERRIFIC.

97
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,135
I WENT THERE SEVERAL MONTHS

98
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:56,504
AGO, TALKED TO THE NATIONAL

99
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,106
SECURITY ADVISOR, TALKED TO

100
00:02:58,107 --> 00:03:00,241
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN DIRECTLY.

101
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,076
I KNOW MIKE POMPEO'S TEAM IS

102
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:04,479
HANDLING THE DETAILS AND I HOPE

103
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,049
THAT WE CAN GET THIS BEHIND US.

104
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,417
I TOLD PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IT

105
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:11,486
WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO GO

106
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:12,887
FORWARD IN A PRODUCTIVE FASHION

107
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,756
UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED

108
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:19,694
AND TURKEY IS A STRATEGIC ALLY.

109
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:23,665
IT'S AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP.

110
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,066
WE HAVE AN AIR BASE THERE.

111
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,801
THEY HELPED US IN SYRIA.

112
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:28,770
KEEP OUR FINGER CROSSED AND I

113
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,405
HOPE HE WILL COME HOME SOON AND

114
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,105
POMPEO'S PEOPLE ARE WORKING

115
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:31,806
HARD.

116
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,975
>> Jon: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

117
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:35,610
SLAPPED SANCTIONS ON THE

118
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:36,978
INTERIOR AND JUSTICE MINISTER

119
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,247
OF TURKEY IN PART AS A RESULT

120
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:40,448
OF THE BRUNSON CASE.

121
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,851
WOULD YOU EXPECT THOSE NOW WILL

122
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,420
BE DROPPED?

123
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,554
>> I WOULD HOPE SO.

124
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,789
I WOULD THINK SO.

125
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,695
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT

126
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:53,995
TRUMP.

127
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,563
HE HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN

128
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:55,863
THIS.

129
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,232
TRIED TO GIVE TURKEY THE SPACE

130
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,734
THEY NEED TO GET A RESULT GOOD

131
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:00,268
FOR BOTH COUNTRIES.

132
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:02,737
HE HAS BEEN VERY PRACTICAL AND

133
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:03,204
FIRM.

134
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:06,441
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF, I THINK,

135
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,276
PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP WORKING

136
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:10,612
WITH AN ALLY OVER A VERY

137
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:11,312
CONTENTIOUS EVENT.

138
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:12,447
TRYING TO FIND THE SPACE

139
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:16,184
NECESSARY TO GET A GOOD OUTCOME

140
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,118
BUT BEING TOUGH.

141
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,354
AND SO POMPEO'S PEOPLE ARE

142
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:21,322
WORKING AS WE SPEAK.

143
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:26,027
THIS WILL GIVE US A NEW LIFE IN

144
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,028
THE U.S./TURKEY RELATIONSHIP.

145
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:27,895
>> Sandra: FASCINATING TO WATCH.

146
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:29,597
AS FAR AS THE ECONOMIC

147
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:31,232
SITUATION IN TURKEY IS

148
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,634
CONCERNED, WE ALL KNOW IT HAS

149
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:35,937
BEEN A DETERIORATING SITUATION

150
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:36,237
THERE.

151
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,039
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS

152
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,840
ADMINISTRATION SEEM UNMOFSHD BY

153
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:41,075
THAT IN EFFORTS TO GET PASTOR

154
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:41,776
BRUNSON HOME.

155
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:44,045
>> THEY HAD A GOAL TO MAKE SURE

156
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,680
THIS FINE MAN WOULD COME BACK

157
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:45,980
HOME.

158
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:48,316
HE GOT CAUGHT UP INTO SOMETHING

159
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,717
NOT OF HIS MAKING AND WHERE DO

160
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:52,220
WE GO FROM HERE?

161
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,388
WE GET PASTOR BRUNSON HOME

162
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,322
OTHER PEOPLE ARE BEING DETAINED

163
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:56,424
THAT WORK FOR THE U.S. EMBASSY.

164
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,059
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM, TOO.

165
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,695
WE AREN'T GOING TO FORGET ABOUT

166
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:01,929
THEM.

167
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,563
THEY'RE TURKISH NATIONALS.

168
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,032
A DEA AGENT THERE.

169
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,667
PEOPLE STILL BEING DETAINED WE

170
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:06,868
THINK INAPPROPRIATELY AND WE

171
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,002
AREN'T GOING TO FORGET ABOUT

172
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:08,503
THEM.

173
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:09,671
IF THEIR FAMILIES ARE LISTENING

174
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:11,172
WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.

175
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,041
HOW DOES THIS MOVE FORWARD?

176
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,576
I HOPE ONE DAY TO HAVE A FREE

177
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,378
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH TURKEY.

178
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,546
THEIR ECONOMY IS IN DECLINE.

179
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:20,181
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEIR

180
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:22,083
ECONOMY AND OUR ECONOMY TO HAVE

181
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,518
A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND SHOW

182
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,386
WE'RE WORKING AS A PARTNER AND

183
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:25,720
A TEAM.

184
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,322
THAT'S A WAYS OFF.

185
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:27,989
THAT'S MY GOAL.

186
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,126
>> Jon: THERE WAS A TIME TURKEY

187
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:39,233
WAS DEMANDING THE U.S.

188
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:40,601
EXTRADITE INTO TURKISH CUSTODY,

189
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:41,869
AN ISLAMIST PREACHER WHO THE

190
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,837
GOVERNMENT THERE, ERDOGAN,

191
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:43,638
CONSIDERS AN ENEMY OF THE

192
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,038
GOVERNMENT.

193
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:44,672
DID THAT EVER COME INTO

194
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:45,406
CONSIDERATION, THAT KIND OF

195
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:45,973
EXCHANGE?

196
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:52,547
>> WE HAVE A PROCESS TO LOOK AT

197
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:53,981
-- WE'RE AN EVIDENCE-BASED,

198
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:55,783
LEGAL-BASED COUNTRY, NOT JUST

199
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:56,984
POLITICAL TRADES HERE.

200
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,353
THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OF I

201
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:01,055
THINK THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE

202
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,423
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT WHAT HIS

203
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,157
ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN.

204
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:05,626
HAVE THEY BEEN AGAINST THE

205
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:06,227
GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY?

206
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,996
HAVE THEY BEEN CRIMINAL?

207
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,231
THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OF

208
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:12,066
THE PERSON YOU ARE TALKING

209
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:12,367
ABOUT.

210
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,402
AND WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT TAKES

211
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:14,869
US.

212
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,838
WE NEVER LINKED THE TWO.

213
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,339
THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE.

214
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,875
THAT WAS REJECTED FROM THE

215
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:21,609
START.

216
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,777
TURKEY UNDERSTOOD THAT.

217
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,512
THEY HAVE A LEGAL SYSTEM, WE

218
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:26,314
HAVE A LEGAL SYSTEM.

219
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:29,083
I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP

220
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,017
AND SECRETARY POMPEO FOR

221
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:30,485
WORKING HARD.

222
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:33,020
BUT THIS IS A TIME WHEN

223
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,123
CONGRESS HELPED.

224
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:38,126
WE WERE PRETTY TOUGH ABOUT THE

225
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:39,761
S-400 MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM

226
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:40,361
FROM RUSSIA.

227
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,729
THEY'RE A NATO ALLY.

228
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,897
THAT'S AGAINST EVERYTHING WE

229
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:43,231
BELIEVE.

230
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:48,636
WE'RE TRYING TO SELL THEM THE

231
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:51,172
F-35 AND HAVING AN S-400 SYSTEM

232
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:53,574
SOLD TO THE TURKEY BY RUSSIA IS

233
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:54,409
A VERY BAD SITUATION.

234
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,511
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

235
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:57,011
THAT COMES LATER.

236
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,313
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO

237
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,181
HAVE A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

238
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:00,515
TURKEY.

239
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:03,918
>> Sandra: I HAVE TO ASK YOU

240
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,019
MEANWHILE BECAUSE PASTOR

241
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,721
BRUNSON'S RELEASE, SENATOR

242
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:09,056
GRAHAM, COINCIDES WITH THE

243
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:10,858
DISAPPEARANCE OF JAMAL GASH

244
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,393
GASH, THE SAUDI COLUMNIST FOR

245
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:16,297
THE "WASHINGTON POST" WHO WAS

246
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,699
INSIDE THE SAUDI CONSULATE IN

247
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,967
INSTAN BULL.

248
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:23,471
TURKEY SAYS THEY HAVE VIDEO AND

249
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:25,106
AUDIO EVIDENCE THAT KHASHOGGI

250
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:26,040
WAS KILLED.

251
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,575
WHAT IS YOUR LATEST THINKING ON

252
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:28,609
WHAT WE'RE LEARNING HERE?

253
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,445
BECAUSE WE DID NOT KNOW MUCH AT

254
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,513
FIRST AND CONTINUE TO LEARN

255
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,214
MORE.

256
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:34,615
>> WELL, WITH EVERY PASSING DAY

257
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,017
IT'S MORE LIKELY HE IS DEAD.

258
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:38,519
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SHERLOCK

259
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,121
HOLMES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

260
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,088
HAPPENED HERE.

261
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,458
HE GOES INTO THE CONSULATE AT

262
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:44,525
1:15 IN THE AFTERNOON.

263
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:46,294
GIVES HIS CELL PHONE TO HIS

264
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,562
FIANCE AND NEVER COMES OUT.

265
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:49,630
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT

266
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,364
SAUDI ARABIA HAD TARGETED HIM

267
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,200
IN THE PAST.

268
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:54,502
HE HAS BEEN A DISSIDENT IN THE

269
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:54,936
MILDEST FORM.

270
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:57,104
IF THIS IS TRUE THAT HE WAS

271
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:58,973
ABDUCTED AND KILLED AT THE

272
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,141
DIRECTION OF THE SAUDI

273
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,976
GOVERNMENT, IT WILL DESTROY THE

274
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:04,078
RELATIONSHIP AS WE KNOW IT.

275
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,814
I'VE BEEN THE BIGGEST DEFENDER

276
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:07,748
OF SAUDI ARABIA.

277
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:10,117
I'VE BEEN A BIG CHAMPION OF THE

278
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:10,551
RELATIONSHIP.

279
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:12,119
I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES

280
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,855
USUALLY WITH SENATOR MCCAIN.

281
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,789
THE CROWN PRINCE TALKED ABOUT

282
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,757
REFORMING THE COUNTRY IN A WAY

283
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,059
THAT IS PLEASING AND

284
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,526
APPROPRIATE.

285
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:20,995
BUT IF HE AND OTHERS WERE

286
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,530
INVOLVED IN THIS, THAT WOULD BE

287
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:24,632
AN OFFENSE TO ME, TO OUR VALUES.

288
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:28,336
IT WOULD BE CONTEMPT FOR THE

289
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:29,470
U.S./SAUDI RELATIONSHIP AND IT

290
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,105
WOULD DESTROY IT IN MY EYES.

291
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:34,609
AND I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I

292
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,244
COULD TO PUNISH THE SAUDI

293
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:38,312
REGIME IF THEY DID, IN FACT,

294
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:40,648
KILL THIS MAN BECAUSE OF HIS

295
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:41,115
DISSIDENT VOICE.

296
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,184
THAT WOULD BE A COMPLETE

297
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:44,150
DISRESPECT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

298
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:46,954
AND I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

299
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,122
OTHERS UNDERSTOOD WHO WE ARE AS

300
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:48,489
AMERICANS.

301
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,691
>> Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE ON

302
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,760
CAPITOL HILL ARE TALKING ABOUT

303
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:54,128
THE POSSIBILITY OF CANCELING

304
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,496
$110 BILLION WORTH OF ARMS

305
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,598
SALES TO THE SAUDIS.

306
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,233
WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR?

307
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,434
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO

308
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:02,036
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

309
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,905
>> HE MAY BE RIGHT BUT I DON'T

310
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:04,805
KNOW.

311
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:07,041
I FEEL USED AND ABUSED, QUITE

312
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,143
FRANKLY PERSONALLY.

313
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,245
I'VE STOOD WITH THE SAUDIS

314
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:12,413
AFTER THE 9/11 ACTIONS HERE,

315
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,315
I'VE TRIED TO HELP THE

316
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:14,715
GOVERNMENT.

317
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:15,917
THEY'VE BEEN A STRATEGIC ALLY.

318
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,585
THEY HELP US WITH TERRORISM.

319
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:19,453
THEY'VE BEEN STANDING UP TO

320
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:19,921
IRAN.

321
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:22,857
THEY'VE BEEN BETTER TOWARD

322
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:23,291
ISRAEL.

323
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,393
BUT IT MUST BE TAKING US FOR

324
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:25,726
GRANTED.

325
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,962
TO THINK THAT A GUY LIKE ME AND

326
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:28,963
MY COLLEAGUES WOULD ACCEPT THIS

327
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:32,433
AND JUST GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS

328
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:33,000
USUAL IS COMPLETELY

329
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,502
MISUNDERSTANDING WHO WE ARE.

330
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:37,738
OUR FOREIGN POLICY HAS A

331
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:40,608
COMPONENT OF OUR VALUES AND OUR

332
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:41,542
HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES.

333
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:43,377
AND WE DON'T BELIEVE IN

334
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,279
MURDERING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY

335
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,249
ARE DISSIDENT AND YOU HAVE TO

336
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,984
DO BUSINESS WITH UNSAVERY

337
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:50,885
CHARACTERS IN THIS BUSINESS BUT

338
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,086
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ALLY YOU HAVE

339
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,956
TO LET THEM AND THE WORLD KNOW

340
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:55,356
WHO YOU ARE.

341
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:56,057
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW

342
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:57,658
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE AND

343
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,994
IF THE CROWN PRINCE WAS

344
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:01,362
INVOLVED WITH THIS IN ANY

345
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,330
FASHION, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

346
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:04,865
FOR HIM TO BE A LEGITIMATE

347
00:10:04,866 --> 00:00:00,000
LEADER ON THE INTERNATIONAL
