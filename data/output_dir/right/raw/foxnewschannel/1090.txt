I AM GLAD THE LEFT FOUND A CAUSE

140
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:03,905
THEY CAN RALLY TO.

141
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,974
I DON'T REMEMBER THEM STANDING

142
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:12,347
IN SUPPORT OF ANOTHER SISTER.

143

THEY WERE SEX CRULL

150
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:29,631

THEY WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED BY

PRESIDENT CLINTON.

161
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,238
JENNIFER FLOWERS MADE THIS

162
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:36,571
CHARGE.

>> HE CAME ON TO ME THAT NIGHT.

164
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,876
I TOLD HIM TO KNOCK IT OFF.

HE PROCEEDED TO CONTINUE TO COME

166
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:47,415
ON TO ME FOR 3 MONTHS.

167
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:51,353
IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS DEFINITELY

168
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,688
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

169
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:59,961
I WOULD LIKE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT

170
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,697
TO RECOGNIZE AND OTHERS WHO CAME

171
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:11,673
OUT WITH CLAIMS OF SEXUAL

172
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:12,440
HARASSMENT FROM BILL CLINTON.

173
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,608
>> Laura: THE WOMEN ON THE

174
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:17,179
"VIEW" HAD NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT

175
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,013
THAT.

176
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,315
WHEN CHRIS CUOMO BROACHED THE

177
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:21,650
TOPIC LAST NIGHT.

178
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,785
HERE'S THE RESPONSE HE GOT.

179
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,187
>> BILL CLINTON, ME TOO.

180
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,354
>> NOT GETTING INTO THAT.

181

WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

184
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:35,530
IT'S NICE NEWS BUT DOESN'T HELP

185
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,865
THE CAUSE.

186
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:37,532

00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:50,912
THE ONLY WOMAN WORTHY OF THE

00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:56,518
NEWS IS A PORN STAR.

192
00:06:56,518 --> 00:07:00,288
THESE WOMEN WERE UNDONE BY HIS

193
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:00,655
COMMENTS.

194
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,391
>> WHAT A PIG.

195
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:05,660
I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THESE

196
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,027
COMMENTS.

197
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:11,499
THEY MADE MY BLOOD BOIL.

198
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,803
THIS IS A BAD DAY FOR THE

199
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:17,505
PRESIDENT IF THIS IS THE PERSON

200
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,174
THE PRESIDENT WANTS SPEAKING TO

201
00:07:19,174 --> 00:07:19,441
HIM.

202
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,910
>> THIS IS A BAD DAY FOR

203
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,277
HUMANITY.

204
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:25,313
>> Laura: COME ON, GUYS.

205
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:27,449
IMAGINE IF AFTER 4 YEARS OF

206
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,417
COLLEGE, YOU SLOG TO PUT YOUR

207
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,418
DAUGHTER THROUGH SCHOOL.

208
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,120
AND OUR DAUGHTERS ANNOUNCED SHE

209
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,689
WANTED TO BE A PORN STAR OR A

210
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,056
STRIPPER.

211
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:37,259
WHAT MOTHER WOULD NOT BE MAKING

212
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,828
A VALUE JUDGMENT ABOUT THAT

213
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:40,528
VOCATIONAL CHOICE?

214
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,364
OH, GREAT, HONEY.

215
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:43,632
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

216
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:46,034
HANGING OFF A STRIPPER POLE IS A

217
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,770
MUCH BETTER CHOICE THAN BUSINESS

218
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,471
SCHOOL.

219
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:49,804
YAY!

220
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,707
THE SELECTIVE OUTRAGE AND THE

221
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:55,210
TWISTED MORALITY OF THE LEFT

222
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,145
NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE ME.

223
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:59,147
THROUGH ALL OF THIS, THE

224
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,316
DEMOCRATS HAVE REVEALED

225
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:01,716
THEMSELVES.

226
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,919
WITH NONETHELESS TO RUN ON, THEY

227
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:14,195
ARE THE PARTY OF MS-13 NOT

228
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:16,097
ANIMALS.

229
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,632
TRANSGENDER BATHROOM.

230
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:20,235
NFL PROTESTS AND LET'S THROW IN

231
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:21,336
POT AND THE PORN INDUSTRY.

232
00:08:21,336 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU CAN PUT THAT ON A BUMPER
