SOME ARE COMPLAINS ABOUT HOW

87
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:12,004
THIS WILL GO.

88
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:14,040
JIM AND ANOTHER MEMBER SAID THEY

89
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,808
HAVE BEEN BLOCKED.

90
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,476
>> WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE

91
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:20,012

FORWARD TO US AND THIS IN FACT

94
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:26,485

OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ANY QUESTION

99
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,732
THAT NEEDS TO BE ASKED AND NOT

101
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:50,743

102
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,878
>> DID HE SET UP THE IDEA IT

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,714
COULD ONLY BE YOU AND A FEW

104
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:57,283
OTHERS IN THE RADIO.

105
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:57,950
>> OH, NO.

106
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,152
THAT WAS OUR PROPOSAL.

107
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:00,953
>> OKAY.

108
00:04:00,954 --> 00:04:02,722
>> JIM IS CONCERNED ABOUT A

109
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:03,923
NUMBER OF THINGS.

HE JOINED US LAST WEEK.

111
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,462
WE HAVE TO GET YOUR REACTION.

112
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:13,232
>> WE NEED HIM TO ANSWER

113
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:18,471
QUESTIONS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF

114
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:18,970
ISSUES.

115

WAS HE WORRIED ABOUT WEARING THE

124
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:49,168
MIC.

125
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,936
>> WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE

00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,272
HAVEN'T TALKED TO ANYBODY IN THE

127
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:54,473

WE ALSO KNOW, AS YOU KNOW, HE

00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:09,121
MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND IT'S

134
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:14,193
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS IS

135
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:17,129
SOMETHING THE CONGRESS AS

136
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,631

00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:22,034
WE'LL BE ASKING THOSE SAME

00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,939
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

142
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,212
CONVERSATION OR THE PRESIDENT

143
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:33,546

INTERVIEWS HE TWEETED OUT THERE.

150
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,198
AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH JAMES

NUMBER TWO LEAKED INFORMATION TO

155
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:04,343
THE MEDIA.

156
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,880
THEY VIOLATED THEIR OWN RULES.

157
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,317
THEY HAD A BUNCH OF TRUMP HATING

158
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:12,985
AGENTS AND LAWYERS TELLING

159
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,821
PRESIDENT TRUMP HE WASN'T UNDER

160
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,823
INVESTIGATION WHEN HE WAS.

161
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:18,791
YOUR THOUGHTS?

162
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,460
>> THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO

163
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,761
SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT.

164
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:26,498
WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK MR.

165
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:27,933
ROSENSTEIN ABOUT THIS MATTER.

166
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,769
HE WAS INVOLVED WITH THE

167
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,608
APPROVAL OF THE THIRD RENEWAL OF

168
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:38,344
THE FISA WARRANT APPLICATION.

169
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:42,781
THIS IS REQUESTING A COURT IN

170
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:47,720
SECRET TO APPROVE AWARE

171
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:47,753

SECRET TO APPROVE A WIRETAP ON

173
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:50,155
AN INDIVIDUAL.

174
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,091
THIS WENT ON FOR A FULL YEAR.

175
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:55,127
THE LAST THREE MONTHS HE WAS

176
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:57,162
INVOLVED IN THE APPROVAL.

177
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,565
WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND

178
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:03,135
BE SURE TO ASK PLENTY OF

179
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:03,702
QUESTIONS.

180
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,971
>> WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THEY HELD

181
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:06,672
BACK INFORMATION.

182
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,807
THEY DIDN'T PRESENT IT.

183
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:11,110
THEY REFUTED COLLUSION BUT

184
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,778
DIDN'T GIVE IT TO THE COURT.

185
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,413
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW?

186
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:20,019
>> I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO

187
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,921
SUGGEST WHAT HE'S SUGGESTING IS

188
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:23,956
A SERIOUS CONCERN AND THAT'S WHY

189
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,991
WE WANT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

190
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:31,031
GENERAL TO RESPOND

191
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,499

ENOUGH TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC IN

THAT.

243
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,069
IT'S MY EXPECTATION HE WILL DO

00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,709

WIRE AND WHAT ELSE?

248
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,682
>> IT'S THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

249
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,318
HAD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WHICH

250
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,654

WE SAID NO, YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER

255
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:48,127
OATH.

256
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:51,197
IT HAS TO BE A TRANSCRIBED

257
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,865
INTERVIEW WITH QUESTIONS AND

258
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,400
ANSWERS GIVEN.

259
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:58,103
WE ALSO HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS

00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,773
WHERE HE REFUSED TO ANSWER

261
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:01,974
QUESTIONS.

263
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,611
OPPORTUNITY IN THE APPROPRIATE

264
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,746
SETTING TO ASK ALL OF THOSE

265
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,582
QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CONDUCT

266
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,817
OF AN INVESTIGATION THAT BEGAN

267
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:14,420
LONG BEFORE HE BECAME INVOLVED.

268
00:11:14,421 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WAS AT THE CRUX OF IT WHEN
