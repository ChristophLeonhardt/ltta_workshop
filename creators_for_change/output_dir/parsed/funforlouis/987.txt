we're walking up 120 steps to get these
caves so just found out a little bit
about these caves they were built 1400
years ago and they were carved out of
the solid rocks of the man-made caves so
these caves were made as a monument to
Shiva the Hindu god the destroyer she
guys this bats in here it fats in the
case and flying around there
then they live up there look at it so is
this a shrine to see but there's a lot
of respects we've got to take our shoes
off and we're in the Shiva shrine

those cases were incredible guys
mind-blowing hand-carved took him a
hundred years to carve into the solid
rock and build this sculptures is
