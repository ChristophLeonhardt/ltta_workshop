THEY'RE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY
BEHIND THAT THOUGHT, DESPITE
NOT SERVING IN OR RUNNING FOR
THE UNITED STATES SENATE NANCY
PELOSI IS THE FAVORITE FOIL IN
REPUBLICAN SENATE RACES.
LOOK AT THE ADS ON THE AIR NOW
IN WEST VIRGINIA, MISSOURI,
NEVADA AND NORTH DAKOTA.
>> DEMOCRAT LEADER  NANCY
PELOSI ELECTED JACKIE ROSIN.
>> CLAIRE MCCASKILL HAS JOINED
WASHINGTON
SUPPORTING A NATIONAL ENERGY
TAX.
>> VOTES AGAINST WEST VIRGINIA
IN WASHINGTON, MANCHIN SIDED
WITH BARACK OBAMA AND NANCY
PELOSI VOTING TO GIVE AMNESTY
TO MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.
>> THE ADS ARE PAID FOR BY
AMERICAN CROSSROADS CO-FOUNDED
BY KARL ROVE WHO TOLD ME PELOSI
IS THE BEST FOIL THEY COULD
POSSIBLY ASK FOR.
>> NOT WELL LIKED.
THERE IS A HUGE VITRIOL
REACTION TO HER.
A HIGHER PROFILE AS CHUCK
SCHUMER AND MORE IN THE CENTER
OF THINGS LIKE SOMEBODY LIKE
JOE BIDEN AND SHE CERTAINLY FAR
LESS POPULAR THAN SOMEBODY LIKE
BARACK OBAMA OR MICHELLE OBAMA.
>> THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
IT'S BEEN DONE.
IN 1996 THEY TIED BOB DOLE TO
NEWT GINGRICH HELPING IN BILL
CLINTON'S REELECTION.
>> Bill: NANCY PELOSI CAN RAISE
MONEY, THAT'S ONE THING SHE CAN
DO.
THAT'S A BIG PART OF HER.
>> EXACTLY.
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'RE SO
WILLING TO KEEP HER AROUND WHEN
SHE HAS SUCH HIGH UNFAVORABLES
AMONG INDEPENDENTS.
THE NUMBERS, PELOSI RAISED
$34.2 MILLION FOR DEMOCRATS IN
THE THIRD QUARTER.
250 FUNDRAISING EVENTS, 29
CITIES.
TOTAL HAUL FROM NANCY PELOSI
FOR THE 2018 CYCLE $121.7
MILLION FOR DEMOCRATS, BILL, AS
YOU NOTE THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
IT BRINGS UP THIS IMPORTANT
QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS.
HOW MUCH IS THAT MONEY WORTH
WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE
DEMOCRATIC HOUSE CANDIDATES
