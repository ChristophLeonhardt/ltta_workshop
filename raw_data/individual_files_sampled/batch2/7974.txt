this week a poll was released showing that Republican party identification had dropped by I believe four points of the course of the past year which is certainly significant at the same time democratic party identification had stayed steady for the past year now you might say overall trends like that okay that says something but we've got a new survey that might even say more about everyday politics especially when it has to do with Trump so Trump's favorability not amongst everybody not amongst Republicans but specifically Fox News viewers those who get the most Pro Trump outside maybe Breitbart idea of what's going on possible let's take a look at the effects of polls over the course of the past year coming from Suffolk University let's bring this up you're gonna see the back in June he had a ninety percent favorability among Fox viewers dropping to 74 in October and down to 58 in December now I'm not great at math or anything but that is a big drop over the course of less than six thirty to thirty two points not for everybody not like people who watch Fox right know he's in a world of trouble well the other thing that just spoke to me the other day when they're the exit polls out of Alabama is that only forty eight percent of voters that day had a favorable opinion of Donald Trump forty eight had a negative opinion of him they were Alabama in Alabama where he won by 26 points in Alabama I've got one more number to throw on top of that obviously regardless everything else that's a huge drop but let's take a look at this Fox viewers who strongly approved a Trump's job performance dropped from 55 percent in March to 32 percent in October almost losing a half of his strong approvers The Post notes that what's interesting is that the president's favorability dropped even though Fox viewers from october/november were slightly more inclined to say the US was going in the right direction so their view of Trump is changing in the opposite direction of their view of the country and probably the Republican Party generally they seem to be able to see Trump distinct from the rest of it which is incredible and I think John - right that's why they do it two years ago back to the bama thing think about the Republicans that were coming out to say that they were you know that they had a favorable opinion of Trump most of those were the Roy Moore supporters who were you know the big Trump supporters so it's it's really like 48% of Roy more supporters having it you know not entirely met and I'm but it's it though these are numbers that if you're the president you got to be very very worried about if he dips below 50% of Fox viewers he's probably gone well he's gone because he'll lose Republicans yeah which means no Republican wants to go to the but to the polls next year no sitting member of Congress is a Republican with the president at 32% with you know that these people are were they're losing all of this support among their masses and it becomes easier to go against him if you were running for Congress - so the right way sometimes a little slower to the take right so and and so it takes him a little while but but what my thesis was wrong forever on the throne truth forever on that scaffold but the scaffold sways the future and I guarantee you I didn't come up with that okay that's one of more brilliant things yours it's good reason for that I liked your moral arc of the universe it's like went rogue said I came up with this great word fake so and that goes actually to the point I'm making here which is that look one of my thesis was that he's gonna lose moms in Kansas and in five he's lost five points in one year among Republican Women they're down there you know they keep dropping a drama among women overall he's down to 32% I think in approval but that's not that surprising he's down to 32 for the whole country in some of the polls so he's he's losing them and in an Alabama 34 percent of women voted for white women voted for doug jones you may think that's a low number but they used to only be 16 percent that voted for the Democratic candidate in Alabama in Alabama in previous elections right so it hit now the number of white women voting for Democrats is doubled in Alabama okay so and then the second part of it is the problem that the Trump has is him he speaks people hear it right it's one thing to cover up what else right and you could say like if he says out Rush is not true most of us the guys on Fox watch Fox News go it's not true etc but you can't cover up what an idiot he is because he tweets he gets on camera and he says things like Puerto Rico's surrounded by water big water ocean water and like sign a little embarrassing those people hurt him though I will argue against that for a year and a half running for the president - right well I guess so I mean he did say that I also think that the me to thing has hurt this guy a ton I think that you know this year was punctuated at the beginning by the women's March in Washington by the at the end by Time magazine saying that me too is is the person of the year and that only works against the president so I think you're seeing a little bit of that come to fruition - and whether we're right or wrong on why it's happening the fact that it's happening is really really important because if he goes to pardon F win or fire mulher or does anything outrageous like that he absolutely positively needs to Republican politicians to hold otherwise they're gonna throw him out of office right and if Republican politicians think that they will lose popularity with people like Fox News viewers rather than gain popularity then they're gonna throw them under a bus because they're politician completely so if he falls below the water line TVs gets less than half of Fox News viewers he's in a world of trouble and we're this close you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
