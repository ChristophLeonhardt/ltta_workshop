but he also spoke in very brash terms criticizing what he called a new level of unfairness as his personal attorney found himself under an FBI raid and or knocked down today I want to bring in Washington Post Jennifer Rubin who's been reporting on this story Jim Messina was a former White House deputy chief of staff in the Obama administration as well as max boot a former adviser to Mitt Romney and John McCain and former federal prosecutor Paul Butler who was with me before all of this news broke still with me for the federal prosecutorial view Jennifer I start with you as someone who has been eyeing the stormy Daniels case not so much for what happened between miss Daniels and Donald Trump but for everything that happened afterward I wonder your view of both what the president just said his apparent criticism of Bob Miller's boss as well as the raid which he was reportedly watching on television the rate of his longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen today well it's been a remarkable few hours hasn't it as far as the president goes that was about as incoherent and pugnacious as he has been in recent days and the implication that rod Rosenstein did something wrong by signing off on that FISA warning and that entire rant against the Justice Department should be very disturbing and this goes back to a point that I've made many times which is the Congress here is completely delinquent in not moving to protect Muller and Rosenstein and the rest of them and if something does happen and we find ourselves in a constitutional crisis it will largely be because of Congress I also want to make one point about his insistence that they have found a no collusion that is false it's a lie in fact there have been 72 contacts by 22 different members of the Trump campaign with Russian individuals now have we found a smoking gun of Donald Trump picking up the phone and calling Vladimir Putin no but we have a lot of evidence we have indictments we have people who are cooperating with the special prosecutor we are far away from exonerating mr. Trump and whenever he says this my mind goes to the other problem he has and that is obstruction of justice if not for all of this evidence that mr. Muller is collecting if not for the indictments Donald Trump perhaps would not be so concerned about getting rid of the special prosecutor so why is it that he is so bothered if there's nothing there why did he fire mr. Comey why did he seek to smear mr. Comey why did he seek to let lean on the the FBI to exonerate until they off of Michael Flynn this is all of a piece and what happens in these fascinating situations is Donald Trump becomes a witness against himself this is the typical admission against interest because every time he speaks in this way he confirms number one he has a guilty conscience number two he wants to interfere and stop the FBI number three he wanted Jeff Sessions to be his protector none of that is helpful and there I am sure will be Muller and his team taking notes writing this all down fitting the pieces of the puzzle if it takes that let me take that to max boot because it could be a guilty conscience or it could just be a strategic conscience that he knows there are certain things that he has to hide blasting rod Rosenstein molars boss at the end there was was pretty fascinating given that Rosenstein is signing off on the rate of his of trumps personal attorney today it seems a max that rod Rosen sign is now facing what other law enforcement officials have faced which is the evolution from Donald Trump saying nice things when it suits him to to pitting a lot on him well it's pretty clear that Trump is trying to intimidate sessions and Muller into his sessions and Rosen Stein into raining and Muller and that's what this diatribe is all about I mean my my initial reaction frankly watching this was he was so unseemly on so many levels my my initial reaction was while Bashar Assad better watch out there's going to be a few extra airfields added to the targeting list because Trump is so perturbed he's going to take it on and Assad probably in the next 24 hours which is fine by me but what was really I thought truly outrageous about this diatribe that Trump went into was this was ostensibly a national security meeting this is with the Joint Chiefs this was with his so-called war cabinet they're discussing the most serious issues in the world issues of war and peace and American military action in Syria and instead of all of that he's going on a diatribe against the Department of Justice against the dedicated you're a former foreign policy adviser to to some pretty heavy hitters in the Republican Party you're making a point that goes to the opposite of what usually happens there's often a complaint about wag the dog using military to distract this was the opposite it was it was not the country being distracted focused on Syria it was the president being distracted it was almost as if he couldn't hold in a day to gather the facts he had to comment on the FBI rate of Cohen immediately right and he has no sense of propriety propriety he has no sense that these national security issues need to be decided above the level of politics and in fact he's surrounded by these Joint Chiefs these generals who have dedicated their lives to the service of the country and guess what they are very similar to the kind of FBI agents and prosecutors that Trump is now attacking these are all a political civil servants dedicated to our country and so I can't imagine what these generals are thinking knowing how dedicated these FBI folks are how dedicated that Justice Department prosecutors are and Trump is trying to throw them under the bus and so what happens with the military if something goes wrong he's gonna throw the generals under the bus he has just no sense of the way a president is supposed to act Paul Butler as I often emphasized when we interview participants who bring a great deal primary knowledge Paul the issue that he raises may be true and accurate even though for him it's in his interest to say this do you share that view that we were discussing earlier that the key here is not that they grab the docks because then they have to go through them the key is depending on what's in there they might be able to get this secret info and use it absolutely so you cannot use the attorney-client privilege to evade your own criminality we already know there's been a very high showing by the prosecutors just to get this no-knock warrant done at the president's lawyer's office in that press conference you just show we saw the President of the United States becoming unhinged as soon as this raid happened his lawyer whoever he or she may be now would have had to destruct them don't talk hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
