hi i'm femi okay and i'm Malika Bilal and you're in the stream allegations of anti-asian bias at one of the most selective colleges in the u.s. Harvard University will look at an ongoing lawsuit and what the case could mean for the future of race faced university admissions policies you can share your thoughts with us through our live YouTube chat or via Twitter does Harvard University discriminate against Asian American applicants and that is the question being asked in a lawsuit currently being heard in a US federal court the plaintiff students for fair admission says Asian Americans are held to a higher standard in the admissions process they argue that Harvard admissions officers scored academically qualified asian-americans lower on personality and character rankings Harvard has denied any form of discrimination and defends its criteria which it says uses race as one of many factors including academics geography and social economic background so to what degree should race be a factor in college admissions and what else is at stake in the Harvard case we're joining us to discuss these issues in Boston jangly a senior at Harvard he has been assisting with the anemy kiss brief in support of affirmative action in Harvard admissions in Boston swanly co-founder of the Asian American Coalition for education that's a group that believes affirmative action discriminates against asian-americans in New York Gini Park head of the Harvard asian-american Alumni Alliance one of the Harvard affiliated groups campaigning in support of affirmative action policies and in New Haven Connecticut Roman Kondik are a high school senior who was against affirmative action welcome everyone to the stream I want to start with a voice from Harvard this is Kelly she's a student a junior at Harvard University and here's what she had to say about this hot-button issue this isn't a case of potential discrimination this is a case of real discrimination these affirmative action policies are negatively impact asian-americans and unfairly treating them simply because of their race discrimination on college campuses isn't something new this is something that organizations such as the leadership Institute's campus or forum have been reporting on for years and this discrimination is really happening right now as Chief Justice John Roberts once said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race and that's exactly what affirmative action policies do right now and the only way to change that is to get rid of them Jeanne's strong perspective there from Kelly so break this down for us what is Harvard's admission process and why do people like Kelly find it so problematic I think the reason that some people have issues with it I mean the process is a holistic admissions process a whole person and missions process and I think that you know we've all learned a lot about Harvard's admissions process over the last few weeks and one of the things that we've learned is it it is how carefully the admissions office considers each person as an individual and and in terms of considering race it's only one factor among many many many factors I've considered and we were told that it is it is only considered as a plus factor for a for a candidate but we've seen many files of applicants now and what's clear is that admission is not at all determined by scores and grades it's determined by a full consideration of what the admissions office believes is that student's potential the potential to make the most of their education at Harvard and to go on and and make a difference in the world with that education oh it's still a it's a little bit of what it might be like to get into Harvard or how difficult it is to get into Harvard have a look here on my laptop this is what Harvard College Admissions and financial aid have actually shared with the general public and this is a profile of the admitted class of 2020 to look at the applicants 42,000 look who was admitted or who will be omitted mm it is incredibly difficult to get into Harvard jangly you're you're one the few people who managed to do that and you saw your admissions file and what was written on it what did you learn from that mm-hmm yeah so I think the biggest thing I learned is that again Harvard takes a very holistic perspective and omitting applicants right so it's not just the grades and test scores that Harvard is admitting students on either it shouldn't be right so from my own experience here as a undergraduate here at the college the defining experience isn't that we have a lot like really really smart students right it's also that they are like so passionate all these other things so I think that Harvard is right to take a holistic perspective when deciding whether or not to the merit applicant and I think that's really the biggest takeaway I learned from being my admissions file and you've also been helping the court understand what that application process is like what it's like to be a Harvard student and you gave them information what can you tell us about the information you gave the court to help them understand the situation better yeah so I talk a lot about my own personal experiences with diversity here so I come from a very white suburb of Texas I grew up with that much diversity most of my students most of my peers were white right and so after sort of my time here I really realized just how necessary and crucial diversity is to my Harvey experience if it hadn't been for a diversity of perspectives on the different people of color in my classes my experience here would have been completely different in the worst way um so I think I just like really want to put in that student perspective of why diverges diversity is so important why a action is so important Jeanne what's your biggest issue with this current court case saying that Harvard discriminates against asian-americans my biggest issue with this case is that it is being brought by someone who or who has never been an advocate for the asian-american community who has been fighting against race-conscious admissions policies at multiple universities he's suing multiple universities he's taken us to the Supreme Court and failed twice and after he failed the last time in the fish case he went out looking specifically for asian-american applicants so the this case is about ending affirmative action and his only remedy that he seeks is for admissions to be completely raised blind and I think what's really important to remember is that race blind is not race neutral you know this is a country that is not where race is a factor in so many parts of our lives especially in educational achievement and educational opportunity it factors into the way that teachers and counselors look at you it factors into the kinds of schools you have the kinds of access you have to things like test prep that is why the you know race ethnicity should be a factor that can be taken into account so tight admissions office yeah the person that you mentioned is called Edward bloom he is a conservative activist and his aim is to get rid of affirmative action in the United States here he is talking to Fox News in December have a listen college administrators and bureaucrats and admissions officers are Wed to the idea that your race should be used to help you or your race should be used to harm you in your admissions process racial preferences that favored whites back in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s what's wrong it's now racial preferences that favor African Americans and Hispanics that's wrong as well you cannot you cannot remedy past discrimination with new discrimination that's what so our audience and people online as well have a lot to say about ed bloom this is Natasha who says giving us a little reminder and history a lesson here if you will she says he funded Fisher versus Texas which is what an affirmative action case which he lost then he turned to Asian American plaintiffs he's never cared about racial discrimination this case is purely about dismantling affirmative action with Asian Americans as cover another person also weighing in that same theme there and Swan I will give this to you see Joe says II D says he's suing Harvard to fight racial discrimination at Asians but anti-affirmative action Crusaders like bloom never attack legacy admissions which are effectively affirmative action programs for wealthy white kids we know what this is about hashtag not your cover matter what your take is on that yeah obvious is actually misrepresentation by many of the academics and special interest groups if they go to Harvard trials at the Boston federal court they won't know the real situation I was there and actually the SFF a did fight against admissions they asked to remove legacy admissions and Lex admissions and the racial consideration are often tied together in ten American states after they banned the so-called African accent which is not a real kind of reduction which was already legislated into the Civil Rights Act 1964 title six so Edward bloom and s FFA is using the real affirmative action to fight the fake production which is really just discrimination and the current state is mostly anti-asian action because ancient africans even though they are just five percent of the high school graduates every year they are high-performing that they are often punished in most of the american colleges they suffer from the lowest acceptance rates so when people are picking on Edward bloom skin color without looking at the situation of Asian Americans being discriminated all over the country that means they really don't have a case they have nothing to pick on so they have to pick on a legal consultant skin color and that is very simplistic and just not found it I hope make her pay more attention to asian-americans their state of indiscriminate against it shows the moral paradises people are having right now just one the reason that I wanted to share with our audience a clip of Edward bloom was not free skin color but also he's very well-known campaigner against affirmative action and this goes back many many years so nothing about his color but definitely about his platform of what he's keen to do so do you mind that there's this collaboration between you and a activist who wants affirmative action to go away you're not necessarily concerned about asian-americans and how they are being viewed by Harvard application process but affirmative action for stop to end it is actually I'm to claim that he is fighting against affirmative action because if you read his Washington Post opinion he clearly said he supports socioeconomic status based affirmative action and actually you don't have a friend action on the page where everyone can look at and critique critique every action there's no terms that actually act what he really is at the current state is racial consideration setting Bakke case and facial to case and there is no way to control how much colleges use this in their admission process so the most vulnerable members of society often may get made the collateral damage which is the h numeric and applicants when you treat a whole group of people millions of people as just one type of person you are really doing injustice to most of the working class or income applicants the asian-american students are really tribal are just really struggling to make a limit a to work out with their family you know with their i so you're sure this movie this is a pie chart have a look at this pie chart we put it together using the statistics from harvard for their class or 2022 admissions gonna leave it on screen for a little while row man have a look at this so the minority of students in terms of a block would be white american students and then we can look at fifteen percent of african-americans going to be in the class of 2020 to asian americans are 22 percent a little over 22 percent and we have s panics at twelve percent and Native Americans at one point 90 percent and then Native Hawaiians just a tiny tiny little sliver 0.4 percent there so looking Asian Americans 22 percent of this class of 2020 to is that problematic it's that a figure that you'll think this is for Roman Roman is that problematic do you see anything in this pie chart that you're thinking this is not diversity that I'm seeing right here and this is for Roman Roman hello coming to the conversation hey okay so if we really look into what's been happening throughout the history for the race-based affirmative action is again fake affirmative action it is important that we figure out a way to make it into race neutral what we see currently right now is not made race neutral at all it is pure discrimination when we look at that pie chart all we're looking at is just a bunch of numbers you're just putting people into groups as in we have certain number of people as this ethnicity we have certain number people at this ethnicity it's not what we want to look at what is a holistic review a holistic review is to make sure you look at someone in every way possible but when you look at the race and automatically creates some sort of discrimination and we don't want that at all well Jiang and Jeanne both said that with the application process there is a holistic review John go ahead yeah I don't I think maybe there's some like fundamental misunderstanding of what a holistic admissions process is right so you're not emitting an applicant exclusively because there why right we are taking you are not a mission officer a facial at all have you had you're never involved in says I love you I love John to finish his thought and then you can you can look but you say why you have an issue with a process but the whole thing is about students so you can't say just a student John go ahead and there's one then you can come back experiences you're not admitting applicants just because they're black just because they're a different race right you're taking into consideration all these different factors like social and economic status where they're from etc and likes want your earlier point about how is a race-based afferent we should have apparent action based that's based on socioeconomic economic status I don't think that that's an adequate replacement of race-based action because that totally ignores the fact that racism still exists race still really matters in how we live our lives right if you have a white applicant and you have a black advocate and all things are equal these two people are still gonna have very different experiences because institutional racism so exist etc and even if you look at the numbers although people of color black and brown students might be more just for fortunately poor you have the actual number of white applicants our report is going to be extremely more high so in reality this is again only a policy that is going to affect only going to benefit white happens it's not a matter of who will benefit I don't bloom and s FFA it's not just do it for Asian Americans but for all Americans especially the working-class Americans because right now when they use the racial approach it allows upper class students to snatch opportunities from lower income students and that's not fair I went to the corner aisle at Boston federal court and I listened to the defense how they are justifying their racial consideration and everything I said about how a Vietnamese student using pencils to practice English our African American applicants you know has certain kind of career goal and I listened to all those evidence they use to justify racial consideration and none of them is racial consideration it's all flag the applications package the material the information is all there even the even though they don't consider resettle all that information is already in the applicants package all that information is there what they're not saying is the really show people should associate with their identity maybe you want to get in their family image I want to bring in a couple of tweets from our community this really was brought up in my mind when I heard a couple of phrases from Swann this is an op-ed by a member of our community this is the title affirmative action Harvard doesn't hurt most Asian Americans because we more often go to community colleges and the idea behind this he writes in this tweet Ryan says the main point of this op-ed was always to emphasize how our community should remain dubious when folks like Edward bloom also best known for challenging voter rights laws claimed that they suddenly and solely care about our success as a group but moving on from that point though keeping that in mind but moving on just a little bit I want to bring you to this tweet this is from Janelle who says spending my life conducting a research on and teaching about Asian Americans has made me aware of how race has shaped the experiences of Asian Americans and made more aware of how Asian Americans fit into the larger u.s. racial landscape I don't buy charges of discrimination at IV's Asian Americans many who are chinese-american like me are enrolled at Yale at a rate three times greater than their numbers in the population this is not lack of inclusion so I bring that up Jeannie because I wonder and what she's saying is there not a danger that there might actually be discrimination here that will be swept under the rug because of the larger issue of affirmative action I think that it's important definitely for the admissions office to be to be carefully monitoring their processes at all times I hope that the admissions office has very strong training around implicit bias you know that's something we haven't quite discussed yet and there has been some evidence that there may be implicit bias that creeps into the process for instance when teachers and counselors write recommendations and how do you how do you work against against that I think that you know again there are I'm sure there are always ways for an admissions office to be improved and to guard against any kinds of discrimination I have to go back though and again challenge the assertion that Edward bloom is Pro affirmative action that is absolutely not true he is very much said he is against it and in terms of as Jiang mentioned socioeconomics if you know the research has shown that if you just try to admit based on socio economics you decrease the diversity of the class dramatically so if you're going in that direction again that is a solution that is taking us back in time to becoming a less diverse college community and and a society that is you know less educated around issues of diversity and you know one of the things that Harvard tries to do is build leaders for all different communities and that means that they need to admit a class that that include students from all those communities who are committed to those communities who have experience in those communities and they are going to go on to serve those communities that includes students from Chinese American immigrant communities that includes students from Vietnamese communities from South Asian community American communities from Puerto Rican American communities I mean this is why Harvard is trying to create diversity and also this diversity benefits asian-americans I mean the asian-american students at Harvard and at colleges need to learn in diverse environments so that they can go on to work in and lead this incredibly you know diverse society that we live in that's becoming more and more diverse and I think what universities like Harvard are is trying to do are trying to do is to you know build that leadership for the future okay so on I just want to share this Sean if I may let me just let me share this with you this comes from Kirk kopazar who is flowing the the court case that's happening right now regarding Harvard and its application process and Kirk says that it's day eight in the Harvard discrimination case on the stand mark Hanson who previously worked University's office of institutional research in his sworn testimony Hanson says asian-americans are at a disadvantage in Harvard's admission process and then the daily student magazine newspaper the Harvard Crimson also says internal Harvard review showed disadvantage for Asian applicants nobody has spelled out in this conversation so far what are these disadvantages one can you say them for us in a sense I've been very clear what is this it's racial stereotyping racial bigotry and visual profile in the college admissions process not just for you but for everybody I want to come down while Jenny Park just pointed out how they are trying to bring in representative different communities but that's really just visual profiling students of any racial group are good enough to lead any racial group and all the racial groups they are not just limited to community in terms of their own ethnicity I think the fake affirmative action racial consideration is just a tool for white supremacy to perpetuate racism and look down the power and just spiritual defeat and centrally subjugate non-white students and eighty-two colleges I think that's really about very problematic and just morally wrong it's a diversity right now so I like that you sparked something there but I want to bring in our community member another Harvard student this is Daniel he sent us a video comment on the way forward pushing this conversation a bit ahead this is what he told the stream when people talk about finding a solution to the alleged cap on asian-americans and Harvard admissions my first point out that it's not actually clear whether or not discrimination is actually happening that's still being contested in court but if it is I think it's much more likely that a solution would be found looking at other admissions programs like athletic recruitment legacy admissions the Dean's List and children of faculty all of which have been shown to disproportionately favor white students over Asian students and keeping in mind that Harvard is still around half white I think maybe cutting back on legacy and recruitment could do more to get at the heart of the problem rather than cutting back on affirmative action some people also think socio-economic class work is an alternative I don't think that's viable at least on a loan given that race still hurts your opportunity in America regardless of your class jiaying in a sentence what do you make of your classmates thoughts there yeah so I mean I completely agree with all while all that icing right like socioeconomic status is it a good replacement for action the kinds of things that I've raised the case that action is trying to get at because race still matters and how we live our lives I'm Robin know everybody I know man yeah so when it comes to this I've always said the same exact thing when we look back in history when we looked at race that's exactly what caused discrimination that's what's causing discrimination right now I want to go back to the topic of diversity oh man we've got 30 seconds left so thank you so much I really appreciate your input for our conversation we will take it online and continue the conversation now and continue to watch this court case between talking about the application process for asian-americans at Harvard University so Swann Roman Jeanne and Jiang thank you for being part of the converse Monica and I've no see you online so on we'll continue to debate but we have to wrap up the show thank you everybody take care
