hi everybody I'm Amanda head and this is your Oscar edition of The Hollywood conservative for the rebel alright I'm not going to bore you with details or even all of the highlights because I think that if you actually cared enough to know all of those things you probably watched it yourself so and it simply would take too long since the whole thing was around four hours so yeah seriously they mentioned that the first Oscar ceremony was only 15 minutes can you imagine that today oh my gosh how glorious but let's be real fat chance producing Hollywood's best performances to an award show lasting a quarter hour so first let's just talk about the fact that LAPD had about 500 law enforcement officers present in and around the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood to protect those celebrities so there's that yeah okay so for pre awards show the red carpet pandering blah blah blah I tuned in for a short time there was some guy I think he might have been from Hamilton talking about Puerto Rico saying you should go there and spend money hotels are open for business they need that economic boon then the Lady Bird director was interviewed and was asked what advice she would give her high school self and she said be nice to your mom which is actually some really decent advice I think coming out of Hollywood for ones we also found out from the pre-ceremony stuff that Gary Oldman proposed to his wife on set which is kind of weird maybe sweet I don't know they showed us also some of his spectacular dance moves and suspenders that was great he won for Best Lead Actor so that's fantastic all right Jimmy Kimmel hosted of course it took about two minutes to start poking fun at the President and Vice President I guess when they said they wouldn't get political they meant that they weren't going to target any of their own except for those who have been purged from Hollywood but anyone in the Trump administration is totally fair game so Kimmel made the joke poking fun at the elderly I I guess saying Oscar he said Oscar is 90 years old which means he's probably home watching Fox News so okay so old people watch Fox News because there and wise okay of course they brought the pay gap into the conversation which might exist in Hollywood but you all have heard my rants about it and I really think that it is near non-existence in most workplaces Kimmel also mentioned that whoever gives the shortest speech would win a brand new Kawasaki jetski which was Vanna whited by Helen Mirren who looked spectacular as always all right for awards Guillermo del Toro won for Best Director for shape of water he got a little bit political talking about being an immigrant but not really to a degree that he could have I really don't understand what's so hard to comprehend the legal immigration we love that the president loves that legal immigration okay Best Supporting Actress was Allison Janney for I Tanya totally on board with that when I was a singing waitress in Hollywood Allison used to come into the restaurant all the time and she's a freaking awesome person so I'm very very happy for that Best Actress went to Frances McDorman for three billboards but not for those Sabo billboards posted around Hollywood during her speech she asked for all of the female nominees to stand she said hey finance our projects don't talk to us tonight at the parties invite us to your office admirable but only if you have a decent and lucrative project sorry ma'am it's still about the quality of the project not about the gender of the person behind it final award for Best Picture went to the shape of water Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway gave it a second go at announcing the winner it went off without a hitch although we assume that maybe they'll be announcing soon that it was wrong I was bummed I was rooting for Dunkirk or darkest hour but it was shape of water gilma guillermo del toro spoke again his speech was directed to young filmmakers talking about being a kid in Mexico dreaming about being there it was nice now to be candid I reject the notion of telling children that they can be whatever they want to be but I will rant about that another day if you watch the Oscars please let us know what you thought about it thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the Robo if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at app for the ruble media on the app store you download it and you'll have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel you
