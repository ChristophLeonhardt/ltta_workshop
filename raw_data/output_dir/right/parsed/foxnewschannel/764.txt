PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT THEY
HAVE THE FACTS RIGHT, WHY DO
FACTS IN THE DEBATE.
PETE: GOOD POINT.
ED: STICK WITH THE FACTS.
ABBY: SPEAKING OF FACTS,
ACCORDING TO A
ACCORDING TO GALLUP POLL.
MISINFORMATION AND NEWS
COVERAGE.
62% OF THE COVERAGE THAT
THEY SEE IS BIASED.
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED IT'S
NOT HIGHER.
WHERE DO YOU GO TO ACTUALITY
JUST GET THE FACTS TODAY?
JUST GET THE STORY.
ED: OTHER THAN "FOX &
FRIENDS," OF COURSE.
ED: 44% IT'S BELIEVE IT'S
INACCURATE AND 39%
MISINFORMATION.
"TIME" MAGAZINE WITH THE
COVER FEEDING RIGHT INTO IT.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG
REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT
TRUSTING THE NEWS.
TO BE FAIR POINTS OUT THE
PRESIDENT'S ATTACKS, TOO.
PRESIDENT OUT THERE DAY
AFTER DAY SAYING THIS IS
FAKE NEWS.
SOMETIMES IT IS.
AND SOMETIMES IT'S A STORY
HE DOESN'T LIKE, IS HE
UNDERMINING.
PETE: YESTERDAY I WAS IN THE
AIRPORT.
I WAS FORCED TO WATCH CNN.
GO TO MY TWITTER FEED IF YOU
WANT TO SEE IT FORCED TO
WATCH CNN AT THE AIRPORT
BECAUSE THEY PAY FOR THAT SO
I WATCH.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THE TRUMP
HATRED ON THAT CHANNEL.
THE BANNERS ARE IF WE COULD
IMPEACH HIM WE WOULD.
THAT'S WHY IT'S BIASED
INACCURATE AND UNINFORMED.
EVERYONE HAS A PERSPECTIVE.
JUST GIVE ME BOTH SIDES
FAIRLY MAYBE, KINDA, SORT
IT'S A.
CNN IS GOOD WE ARE BIASED WE
ARE LIKE "NEW YORK TIMES,"
STRAIGHT ROLLED JOURNALISTS
HERE.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.
WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN BIASES.
I'M A CONSERVATIVE.
I TELL YOU THAT.  THAT'S
WHERE I'M COMING FROM.
BE HONEST ABOUT IT AND THEN
WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION.
THAT'S WHY THE MEDIA IS NOT
TRUSTED.
ED: VERY BRIEFLY YOU MENTION
SINGAPORE.
I WAS THERE I WAS STUNNED BY
THE COVERAGE BACK HERE ALL
NEGATIVE ABOUT THE IDEA
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT WAS
BRINGING PEACE TO THE WORLD
AND DIFFUSE
AND DIFFUSING NUCLEAR WAR.
