hi my name is Henry Langston and I'm a
report at the vice news last week we
spent time with Amon Bundy's militia who
are occupying the melava Wildlife Refuge
in burns Oregon the people need to be in
control their own land and not have
people clear 3,000 miles away dictating
how their own land works this week I'll
be joining on the line to talk about the
occupation and the bigger issues so if
you want to ask us some questions
message vice news on skype or on twitter
using the hashtag on the line
