a year on since the Berlin Christmas
market attack the German justice
minister has admitted the country's
government was not sufficiently prepared
for the consequences of such an atrocity
particularly in terms of addressing the
needs of those affected
Arty's Peter Oliver now looks back at
the tragic event and speaks to the
husband of one woman killed in the
attack a year on from the Berlin
Christmas market attack tributes to the
victims mix in with the usual joy of the
season this year concrete blocks ring
the Christmas market intended to make
sure that no one could repeat the
atrocity
Nadia cheese Madhava had stopped by the
Christmas market like many others that
evening she was killed when Amory plowed
the stolen truck into the crowd leaving
behind a grieving husband and young son
it was when I called the hotline that
was only information that she's not on
the list so I didn't know anything that
she okay the official statement was that
she was missing but of course it was
known to the police that she was dead
it was pretty detrimental you know not
to have any information at all this is
really bad you lose your power actually
how are you telling your son about what
happened how are you preparing him for
ultimately when he's old much older he
will understand a lot more about this
how does of course this is not easy
because he doesn't understand it fully
yet this will change differently he will
ask questions so I'll try to answer all
his questions as best time I can that's
probably the only thing I can do but
maybe we can try to look into it find
out what happened actually then I would
be interested myself
but the question is how successful can
we be in this quest it was too painful
to go to Berlin for this anniversary so
we prefer to commemorate our girl here
where she was born and grew up there is
no amount of money that could offset the
death of my daughter
no amount new documents have emerged in
the German press that show the security
services new amry was a potential terror
threat back in 2015 and may have allowed
him to remain at-large in the hope of
using him to catch bigger fish
an open letter to angle a Merkel the
families have asked why help promised to
them hasn't been forthcoming and why
Amory had been free to carry out his
attack in the first place
what I'm really angry about is actually
what happened before the terrorist
attack that it was pretty known that
this person is dangerous and still the
authorities didn't arrest him didn't
deport him for some reason and what bugs
me also is that nobody actually
actually took the responsibility it's
still you know everybody is doing their
own work still all the time
as if nothing happened Germany's
Christmas markets remain on high alert
but for the families of those killed and
injured during last year's terror attack
it's left an indelible sadness on the
festive period Peter Oliver RT Berlin
