JESSE: NBC NEWS AND MSNBC HAVE BEEN RUNNING THIS SOUND BITE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP ALL YESTERDAY AND ALL TODAY, AND IT'S TOTALLY TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. THIS IS WHAT NBC NEWS HAS PLAYED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR AND THEN I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THEY CUT OUT AFTERWARDS. PRESIDENT TRUMP: ROBERT E. LEE WAS A GREAT GENERAL. ABRAHAM LINCOLN DEVELOPED A PHOBIA. HE COULDN'T BEAT ROBERT E. LEE. HE WAS GOING CRAZY. ROBERT E. LEE WAS WINNING BATTLE AFTER BATTLE AFTER BATTLE, AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN CAME HOME AND SAID I CAN'T BEAT ROBERT E. LEE. HE HAD ALL OF THESE GENERALS WHO LOOKED GREAT, THEY WERE TOP OF THEIR CLASS AT WEST POINT. THEY WERE THE GREATEST PEOPLE. THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM. THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE HELL TO WIN. JESSE: THEN HE GOES ON DURING THE SPEECH AND SAYS YOU HIS SEES GRANT THEY FOUND OUT HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM, DIDN'T LOOK GREAT, THEY PICKED HIM, HE KNEW HOW TO WIN AND GOT THE JOB DONE. NOW THEY ARE JUST SAYING DONALD TRUMP PRAISES CONFEDERATE GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE AS GREAT. THIS IS THE NARRATIVE THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA ALWAYS WANTS TO DO. 92% OF COVERAGE OF THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN NEGATIVE. THAT WOULD BE FINE IF WE WERE AT 25% UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE WORST CRIME IN HISTORY. BUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS BEING SELECTIVE OF THEIR COVERAGE OF TRUMP. THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE FULL STORY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE VERY SMART. THEY ARE TIRED OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA LYING TO THEM. THE BEST THING WE HAVE IS DONALD TRUMP DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GIG HIS MESSAGE. HE WENT ON TO SAY, WE FOUND THIS GUY, HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB. ULYSSES H. GRANT WENT ON TO WIN THE WAR AND HE BECAME A PRETTY GOOD PRESIDENT. JESSE: HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ROBERT E. LEE MILITARILY WAS GOD AT KILLING PEOPLE. HE WASN'T PRAISING THE GUY FOR WHAT HE STOOD FOR. DO THEY HAVE EDITORS AT NBC SAYING YOU DECEPTIVELY EDITED THE PRESIDENT'S SOUND BITE? I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE SETTING THIS STRAIGHT. HE 10 MINUTES TODAY, THEY ARE JUST DOING THIS OUT OF THE BLUE. TRUMP JUST STARTED PRAISING ROBERT E. LEE. BY THE WAY, HE WAS A GREAT GENERAL AND IS STUDIED THE WAY THAT WAAT WAY THE WAY NAPOLEON IS STUDIED. HE WAS CRUSHING THE UNION A QUARTER OF THE SIZE OF THE FORCE. HALF OF HIS SOLDIERS WERE BAREFOOT BUT HE WAS STILL BEATING THE UNION ARMY. JESSE: I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. THANKFULLY BECAUSE OF THIS SHOW THEY CAN'T. JESSE: AT CNN THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THE RIGHT RIGHTLY SO HAS CALLED THESE ALMOST ANTIFA-TYPE PEOPLE, LEFT WING ACTIVISTS A MOB. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ON CNN. WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE TED CRUZ GETTING CHASED OUT OF THE RESTAURANTS LIKE A MOB OH, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE THE MOB WORD. IT'S TOTALLY A MOB. MATT, MATT, MATT. A MOB? STOP. JESSE: THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE MEANS OF THE WORD TO FIT THEIR NARRATIVE. THEY FORGOT TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST. THESE GUYS ARE SO LIBERAL THEY LOST ALL THEIR VIEWERSHIP. NOW THEY HAVE LOST ALL OF MIDDLE AMERICA. WHAT HAPPENED? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE ON TELEVISION TED CRUZ BEING CHASTISED IN A RESTAURANT. THEY SEE THIS FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE, FROM A MOB. THIS WASN'T ONE PERSON. THIS WAS A MOB OF PEOPLE. WHAT'S AMAZING, IT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME, I KIND OF LOOK FORWARD TO THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT THE MOB MENTALITY IS DESTROY PROPERTY AND THROW ROCKS THROUGH WINDOWS AND LIGHT CARS ON FIRE, DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HEADQUARTERS. NOBODY WANTS TO COVER THOSE. THEY ARE NOT JUST ANGRY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DESTROY YOUR PROPERTY AND GRAFFITI. JESSE: COREY SAYS HE WELCOMES THE MOB. HE'S NOT AFRAID OF THE MOB. YOU I HAVE A BOOK ON THE MOB YOU
