RELEASED AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF
THAT RECORD.
VERY PROUD AND WE HAVE OTHERS
COMING.
TRISH: JOINING ME RIGHT NOW
GORDON CHANG THE AUTHOR OF
NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN AND THE COMING
COLLAPSE OF CHINA BOY A LOT TO
TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY BUT LET ME
START ACTUALLY WITH VENEZUELA
AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JOSH
HOLT BEING BACK HOME IN AMERICA
RIGHT NOW AND WHAT DOES THAT
TELL YOU.
>>  WELL THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
THIS MONTH THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS SECURED THE RELEASE OF
AMERICANS AND I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE I THINK THE
BAD ACTORS TOOK ONE LOOK AT THIS
PRESIDENT AND SAID HE'S REALLY
REGAINED HIS FOOTING AND NOW IS
NOT THE TIME TO MESS WITH THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
TRISH: SO THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
EVERYTHING HE DOING RIGHT NOW
MAY BE IN FACT A LITTLE BIT
CALCULATED FOR THAT WORLD STAGE,
GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT THESE
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON WITH NORTH
KOREA DO YOU THINK THE SUMMIT IS
GOING TO HAPPEN?
>>  I THINK SO.
THE NORTH KOREANS NEED THIS
SUMMIT THEY NEED SANCTIONS
RELIEF, THEY CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE
OUT THEIR NIKE AND THEIR MISSILE
FACILITIES AND KIM WANTS
LEGITIMATE ANY STATION OF COURSE
MEETING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ALSO
HE NEEDS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE
CHINESE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS NO
TERRITORIAL DESIGNS ON THE
KOREAN PENINSULA AND THE CHINESE
HAD A REALLY ROUGH RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE KOREANS SO I THINK KIM
REALLY WANTS TO MEET TRUMP AND
WE SAW THAT ON THURSDAY, WHEN
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT CANCELS
THE SUMMIT AND WITHIN HOURS, THE
NORTH KOREANS COME OUT WITH THIS
STRING OF USUALLY CONCEALED
MESSAGES AND SAYING WE EVEN WILL
GO FOR THE TRUMP FORMULA ON
DENUCLEARIZATION.
THIS IS REALLY QUITE STUNNING.
TRISH: SO WHY DID THEY PULL WHAT
THEY DID AND HAVE SO MANY
AGGRESSIVE STATEMENTS IN THE
DAYS BEFORE THAT LED US TO HAVE
TO SAY OKAY GUYS, ENOUGH.
>>  WELL I THINK A NUMBER OF
FACTORS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT
ONE IS THAT THE CHINESE WERE
REALLY STARTING TO SAY TO THE
KOREANS ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT
SECOND SUMMIT WHERE KIM WENT TO
CHINA TWO TIMES IN A ROW I THINK
THE CHINESE BASICALLY SAID LOOK
PULLBACK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE AMERICANS BECAUSE WE
CHIN EASE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT
YOUR ECONOMY AND WE SAW IN THE
FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THIS MONTH,
THE PRICE OF GAS AND DIESEL IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF NORTH KOREA
FELL DRAMATICALLY AND THE ONLY
REASON THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
IS BECAUSE THE CHINESE ARE
PUMPING MUCH MORE OIL THROUGH
THE FRIENDSHIP PIPELINE.
TRISH: I ALSO HEARD THAT COAL
MAY ACTUALLY, THE COAL TRADE MAY
HAVE BEEN RESUMED AS WELL WHERE
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE ABLE TO
SEND THE CHINESE COAL SO IN THAT
CASE THEY'RE IN VIOLATIONS OF
THE SANCTIONS.
>>  FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS NOW,
MAYBE TWO AND A HALF, THERE'S
BEEN REALLY BLATANT CHINESE
SANCTIONS BUSTING AND IT'S A
NUMBER OF THINGS, NORTH KOREAN
WORKERS ARE NOW BACK IN CHINA,
CHINESE INVESTMENT INTO NORTH
KOREA, THERE'S ALL THOSE GIFTS
THAT THEY GAVE TO KIM AT THE END
OF MARCH AT THEIR SUMMIT THAT'S
A VIOLATION OF U.N. SANCTIONS
AND THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS,
TRISH IS NOT ONLY THAT THE
CHINESE VIOLATED THE SANCTIONS
BY GIVING ALL THOSE LUXURY ITEMS
THEY PHOTOGRAPHED IT AND WERE
SAYING LOOK WE'RE VIOLATING
SANCTIONS U.S. WHAT YOU GOING TO
DO ABOUT IT?
TRISH: WELL WE CAN DO SOMETHING
BELIEVE ME WE CAN DO A WHOLE LOT
ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW, AND DON'T FORGET AND I
KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A
LOT AND I APPRECIATE THIS
BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE TOGETHER
ON THIS ONE.
WE HAVE ECONOMIC LEVERAGE SO
BEFORE WE START SENDING TROOPS
WE OUGHT TO BE DOING EVERYTHING
ECONOMICALLY WE POSSIBLY CAN
WITH CHINA TO INFLUENCE WHAT
THEY'RE DOING WITH NORTH KOREA
AND BY THAT I MEAN --
>>  WE HOLD ALL HIGH CARDS FOR
INSTANCE WE CAN FOR INSTANCE
DECLARE FOUR OF THE BIGGEST
CHINESE BANKS TO BE PRIMARY
MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERNS USED
TO BE JUST BANK OF CHINA.
NOW THERE'S EVIDENCE COMING OUT
THAT THE THREE OTHERS OF THE BIG
FOUR HAVE ALSO BEEN HANDLING
NORTH KOREA'S MONEY.
TRISH: LIKE IT'S IN OPERATION
RIGHT DOWN THERE.
IT'S CLOSED TODAY BECAUSE IT'S
SUNDAY BUT IT'S IN OPERATION
OVER THERE ON MADISON.
>>  IT'S EIGHT BLOCKS FROM HERE
SO WE CAN DO THAT.
WE ALSO GOT ZTE THAT CHINESE
EMBATTLED TELECOM MANUFACTURE
ITS GOT A DEATH SENTENCE RIGHT
NOW FROM THE TRUMP ADMINITRATION
AND THE CHINESE NEED RELIEF FROM
THAT.
TRISH: BUT WE'RE LETTING IT
EXIST GORDON.
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BECAUSE
IT FEELS LIKE A MIXED SIGNAL.
>>  I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL LOOK THE
ZTE DEAL THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
NEGOTIATED IS A GOOD ONE BUT THE
POINT IS THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE OF
WHETHER IT'S A GOOD DEAL OR NOT
R US OR THEM.
THE CHINESE IS THE CHINESE MADE
THIS AN ISSUE OF POLITICAL WILL
SAYING YOU HAVE TO GIVE RELIEF
TO ZTE SO ANY DEAL NO DEAL NO
MATTER HOW GOOD IS A GOOD DEAL.
WE NEED TO SHOW CHAIN THAT WE
HAVE POLITICAL WILL AND THAT WE
WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO MESS WITH
IRAN SANCTIONS, NORTH KOREA
SANCTIONS YOU NAME IT.
TRISH: OKAY SO MAYBE NOT TRADE
SO MUCH.
>>  NOT TRADE SO MUCH.
TRISH: I MEAN THE WHOLE TRADE
THING IS A WHOLE OTHER
CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE IDEA
THEY'RE LIKE OKAY, WE'RE GOING
15% ON CARS.
>>  THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.
THAT TARIFF HAS TO GO DOWN TO
WHAT OUR TARIFF IS ON CHINESE
CARS.
TRISH: 2.5%.
OR HOW ABOUT 0 FOR EVERYONE?
>>  0 FOR EVERYONE.
TRISH: GORDON IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU THANK YOU.
