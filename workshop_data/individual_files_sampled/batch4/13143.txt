Ben just was just talking about Jefferson and Bradley asked so long those lines and he says that Jefferson wrote that our unalienable rights are self-evident but are they and if so wouldn't all societies naturally realize them this is a great question so so the answer is important so right so the well the answer is of course they're not self-evident but Jefferson didn't mean they were self-evident to any person on earth he meant to any right-thinking person who had grown up in the context of judeo-christian values right that's the real answer right the real answer is that of course Jefferson wasn't a fool he knew the most people on earth did not see these rights as self-evident he meant that these rights were self-evident given a certain set of premises including the idea that all people were created in the image of God and the idea that Englishmen had rights then it was self-evident to the rest of this follows but if you don't have visit this is where we make a mistake when we think that we can just take the the rights that were generated over the course of two thousand years of judeo-christian history and a thousand and a half years of Greek theorizing you can take those interests and plant them anywhere in the world without any sort of military force that if you just take that if you just spread the seeds then the roots will grow it's just not true you have to actually acknowledge that there is a cultural history that pre-exists the founding of the United States and that is the soil from which all of this grows and without that soil you're spreading seeds out in cement it's just not gonna go anywhere and I think Jefferson Jefferson knew that he wasn't a foolish man III think that when he said self-evident I don't think he meant actually readily apparent I think he meant axiomatic that the only evidence for the Muslim the only evidence necessary for them was themselves that once you saw them I mean something can be self-evident yeah and nobody discovers it for 2,000 years but then once you discover it you know it and you're absolutely right that the that the culture and the custom has to be there the underlying principles have to be there to lift you to that place where you see it but it doesn't mean that it's self-evident doesn't mean Oh anybody can see it it means once you see it it doesn't have to be proved
