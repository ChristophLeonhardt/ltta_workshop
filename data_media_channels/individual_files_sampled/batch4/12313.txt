maybe you heard about this the astronaut scott Kelly tweeted a Winston Churchill quote a couple of days ago the tweet got him into some trouble this is what the tweet said the tweet was this is what he said one of the greatest leaders of modern times Sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over and that was a very controversial you hear that that tweet and you say wow that's controversial I that's some controversial stuff that's pretty edgy there Scott Kelly now this was I'm assuming an attack on Republicans who were celebrating the Cavanaugh confirmation because that's who tweeted it when I assume that's what he was doing there so he was agreeing with it should have made liberals happy he was agreeing with them he was criticizing Republicans they should have been pleased with that but they weren't they came after Scott Kelly apparently on the basis that Churchill was a racist imperialist etc so then Kelley followed that tweet with possibly the most embarrassing tweet ever published even amidst the daily deluge of embarrassing tweets this is what he said he said did not did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I do not support my point was we need to come together as one nation we are all Americans that should transcend partisan politics now there is so much to unpack here there's so much in this one little incident because it's emblematic of where we are as society so first you see again as I frequently remark you see the way that the left is just never satisfied ever with anything even if you agree with them even if you take their side they'll still go after you if you don't agree and take their side in the right way using the right words avoiding all the various different landmines that are set out if you don't do that then that they'll attack you and they'll attack you in the same way that they would have if you were all the way on the other side on the opposite side from them so you're either 100% on there so we talked about this yesterday it's the way the left operates either you're 100% on their side with everything and in everything that you say or you're the enemy there's no in-between at all right
