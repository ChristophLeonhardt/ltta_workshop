the liberal mainstream media has gone beyond fake news there now outright communist propaganda I often say just when you think the fake news mainstream media can't surprise you disgust you disappoint you any more than they do every day while they come along and say hold our beer and prove us wrong but they have really really outdone themselves at the Olympics with this disgraceful I mean disgraceful mooning over North Korean dictator Kim jong-un sister I mean they're swooning over Kim's sister doesn't border on communist propaganda it is communist propaganda let me read you a headline from The Washington Post on my screen here the Ivanka Trump of North Korea captivates people in the south at the Olympics no she's not no she's not CNN Kim jong-un sister is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics they're not swooning over our athletes and they call the sister of a murderous dictator a guy who starves his own people a guy who tortures and beats you if you're a North Korean citizen for the heinous crime of watching a movie on a flash drive a movie from outside North Korea because I don't have movies inside North Korea for that you're tortured you're beaten I was reading an interesting story yesterday about accounts from those who have been able to escape North Korea the police are completely corrupt in fact the police go easy on the drug dealers the methamphetamine the ice dealers they call it ice as the format then said I mean crystal meth over in North Korea that's most prevalent because it's the easiest to synthetically make well the police go easiest on those dealers because the cops are stressed out as everybody else so they go to the dealers houses to smoke meth so that they can relax a little bit it's absolutely dysfunctional inside North Korea this woman is part of the regime causing that dysfunction TNN the in post the New York Times all of them mooning over her all of them acting as if the world owes North Korea something but see this has nothing to do with North Korea and everything to do with the media's disdain for Donald Trump and conservatives they know that by swooning over the dictator the murderous the torturing dictator Kim sister that they're gonna jab us a little bit that's them saying we're the media elites we're the coastal elites we are so enlightened we are so open-minded we're so much more well educated than you then you prod Luddites you don't see Kim's sister for what she is you don't see the beautiful diplomacy she's engaging in all you you brutal conservatives think about his war you war mongering pigs you don't see what she's doing there and how the world is willing to accept her and have us the enlightened media intelligentsia are willing to go in lockstep with the globalists and accept this wonderful young woman except she's not a wonderful young woman she's not captivating anybody she's not stealing any shows the only thing she steals is food from the North Korean people their money their economy their freedom their well-being that's all she's ever stolen alongside her psychopathic brother but this takes us to a whole new level this is an enemy of the United States this is equivalent to CNN and the Washington Post having swooned over Ava bran or Leni Riefenstahl up in 1936 Olympics swooning over Hitler's girlfriend saying she's she's captivating the world and she's stealing the show you know what Americans would have done you don't Americans would have done even as recently as 2001 with the New York Times and CNN have said or the Washington Post and CNN have said bin Laden's wife is captivating bin Laden's wife is stealing the show you know they just might've if there were Olympics at that point and she was the national of a particular nation one of bin Laden's wives he was a polygamist but one have been with Laden's wives they might very well have swooned over her they tried to do it with bin Laden's daughter but they got shut down if you I don't know if you remember this but going back about 15 years they were trying to make bin Laden's daughter in New York City socialite and they were shut down pretty hard when people didn't want to hear it and Minh Laden daughter came out crying crocodile tears and American said too bad your dad is a mass murdering terrorist we're not gonna make you a socialite because the left thinks it's cool but encouragingly there are some shining stars in journalism there are some good ones left and they have come out against their industry in a pretty ferocious way naming names and calling people out and
