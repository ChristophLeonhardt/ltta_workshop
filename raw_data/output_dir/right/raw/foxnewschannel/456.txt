THEY SAID DON'T GO

12
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:24,006
THROUGHOUT WITH THAT HAT ON.

13
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:26,876
90% OF NEWS ARE LIBERAL.

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,833
NEXT GUEST IS SOMEONE KANYE

00:01:06,449 --> 00:01:08,951
>> I HAD TEARS IN MY EYES.

29
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:10,019
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HAPPY

30
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,788
I HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST 24

31
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:13,089
HOURS.

32
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,957
MUCH NEEDED DEBELIEVE FROM

33
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:16,659
THE KAVANAUGH I DO BACK KEL

34
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,461

00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,063
TO BE SAID FOR A VERY LONG

37
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:21,364
TIME.

38
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:22,365
THERE IS NO DOUBT IS HE ONE

39
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,599
OF THE BRAVEST MEN IN

40
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,567
AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

41
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,269
THE LEFT HAS DECLARED WAR ON

42
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,970
OUR AMERICAN VALUES.

43
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,506
AND KANYE IS FIGHTING THE

44
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,174
CULTURAL FRONT.

45
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:31,607
BRIAN: YEAH.

46
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:32,575
HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT

47
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,910
TWEETED OUT AFTERWARDS LIKE

48
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,212
MANY I DON'T WATCH SNL EVEN

49
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:37,513
THOUGH I PAST HOSTED IT.

50
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:38,581
NO LONGER FUNNY.

51
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,749
NO TALENT OR CHARM.

52
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:40,917
IT IS JUST A POLITICAL AD

53
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:44,921
FOR DEMS.

54
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,123
WORD IS KANYE WEST, WHO PUT

55
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,925
ON AUTO MAGNA HAT AFTER THE

56
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,193
SHOW, DESPITE BEING TOLD NO,

57
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,160
WAS GREAT.

58
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,495
HE'S LEADING THE CHARGE.

59
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,230
THE CROWD STARTED HISSING

60
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,732
AND THE CAST WAS ROLLING

61
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,301
WITH YOU

62
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:58,501
BUTH YOU

63
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:58,535
BUT HYOU

64
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:55,365
BUT HEOU

65
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,635
THEIR EYES.

66
00:01:58,635 --> 00:01:59,335
BUT HE HAS NOT

67
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:01,070
PAID A PRICE AT THE I GUESS

68
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,739
WHAT I WOULD SAY THE RECORD

69
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:03,039
STORE.

70
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,274
BUT IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

71
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:05,808
YET.

72
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,410
HE IS STILL SELLING WELL.

73
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,745
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

74
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,113
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS SO

75
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,915
SPOT ON WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT

76
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,450
THIS SHOW BEING LEFTIST

77
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:13,850
PROPAGANDA.

78
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,518
I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES.

79
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,420
I ONLY WATCHED IT BECAUSE

80
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,488
KANYE WEST WAS PERFORMING

81
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:19,789
AND HE IS MY FRIEND AND I

82
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:20,824
WANTED TO SEE WHAT HE DID

83
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:21,291
WITH THE SHOW.

84
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,692
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS GOING

85
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,528
TO PUT ON A MAGA HAT.

86
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,830
QUITE LITERALLY THERE WAS A

87
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,497
SEGMENT WHERE THEY WERE

88
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:28,965
SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN

89
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,433
BRETT KAVANAUGH CANNOT BE

90
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,134
CONFIRMED.

91
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,035
GIVING PERMISSION FOR THE

92
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:33,703
PEOPLE TO WATCH THAT SHOW TO

93
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:35,138
BE VIOLENT, TO PROTEST THESE

94
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:36,272
HEARINGS AND TO FEEL THAT

95
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:37,474
THEY WERE JUSTIFIED IN THEIR

96
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,541
ACTIONS.

97
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,843
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, SO WHAT

98
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,611
KANYE IS DOING IS

99
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:43,113
UNBELIEVABLY BRAVE TO STAND

100
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,280
UP TO THE MOB.

101
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,116
TO PUT ON A MAGA HAT AND SAY

102
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,050
I SUPPORT THIS PRESIDENT.

103
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,385
AND BEYOND THAT I'M NOT SURE

104
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,520
IF YOU SAW HIS INSTAGRAM

105
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,454
POST YESTERDAY WHERE HE WORE

106
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:52,856
THE HATS BEGIN AND HE SAID

107
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,424
THIS HAT REPRESENTS BRINGING

108
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,126
JOBS BACK HOME TO AMERICA.

109
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:57,995
IT REPRESENTS MAKING SURE

110
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,196
THAT AMERICANS ARE TAKEN

111
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:02,065
CARE OF FIRST.

112
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:03,367
AINSLEY: HE WAS TWEETING OUT

113
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,269
ABOLISH THE 13TH AMENDMENT.

114
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,238
13TH AMENDMENT ABOLISH

115
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,040
SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY

116
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,942
SERVITUDE AND ALLOW

117
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,845
PRISONERS TO BE USED AS

118
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:15,846
SLAVE LABOR HE WALKED IT

119
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,714
BACK IN THE NEXT FEW TWEETS

120
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:18,115
AFTER THAT.

121
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:18,649
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

122
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:19,616
HE WALKED IT BACK IT GOES

123
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,885
BACK TO WHAT KANYE SAID

124
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,320
ABOUT SLAVERY BEING A

125
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,854
CHOICE.

126
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:24,454
KANYE BELIEVES THAT THE

127
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,523
AMENDMENT DID NOT ABOLISH

128
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,258
SLAVERY WHATSOEVER AND WE

129
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,393
VERY MUCH ARE STILL SLAVES.

130
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:30,260
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE HAS

131
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,361
BEEN FIGHTING AND HAS BEEN

132
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,463
SAYING THAT I'M NOT SURE

133
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,065
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID ABOLISH

134
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:35,799
THE 13TH AMENDMENT.

135
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,334
I DO KNOW HE BELIEVES AS I

136
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,535
DO BELIEVE THAT BLACK PEOPLE

137
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,138
TODAY ARE STILL ENSLAVED

138
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,873
TODAY MENTALLY AND IN THE

139
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,474
PAST IT WAS OUR BODIES THAT

140
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,577
WERE ENSLAVED.

141
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,444
BRIAN: RECONSTRUCTION WAS A

142
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:47,811
DISASTER.

143
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,546
IF WE DID IT RIGHT IN THE

144
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,381
1860S WE WOULDN'T HAVE A

145
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,349
1960S BUT WE DIDN'T.

146
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,483
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.

147
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,818
AND HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT

148
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,287
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS FOR THE

149
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:58,689
LONGEST TIME WERE THE PLACE

150
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:59,122
TO GO FOR THE

151
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,791
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.

152
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,260
BUT SOMETHING SWITCHED IN

153
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,660
THE 1960'S.

154
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,194
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

155
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,929
I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS ALL

156
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,498
THE TIME WITH LINDEN BAINES

157
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,966
JOHNSON WHICH IN OUR SCHOOL

158
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,334
SYSTEMS IT IS TAUGHT TO US

159
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,368
THAT LINDEN BAINES JOHNSON

160
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,569
IS THE BEST PRESIDENT THAT

161
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,804
EVER HAPPENED TO THE BLACK

162
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:14,938
COMMUNITY WHICH COULD NOT BE

163
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:15,973
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

164
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,207
GREAT SOCIETY ACT

165
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,841
PROLIFERATED THE WELFARE

166
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,142
STATE.

167
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,277
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT'S

168
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,612
BROUGHT AMERICANS TODAY

169
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:22,479
$22 TRILLION PAID INTO THE

170
00:04:22,479 --> 00:00:00,000
WELFARE SYSTEM AND BLACK
