MAY BE HE WOULD.

163
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:51,568
BUT HE DID SAY THOSE BOLD THINGS

164
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,004
THAT CHANGED THE PAIR DIME

165
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:57,174
AND -- MAY BE IT SHOULD BE NOW.

166
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,209
>>  THE THING IS THEY SAID HE

167
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,278
WAS A CALIFORNIA COWBOY AND HE

168
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,181
WOULD START WORLD WAR THREE AND

169
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:07,451

170
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,952
