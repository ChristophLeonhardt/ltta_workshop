1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,300
- I'm Jim Howey.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,560
Was in the NFL from 1999 until 2018.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,560
My position was a back judge

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,168
for many years then I
went to field judge. 

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,210
To get in the NFL,

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,640
it's kind of a long process.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,240
Almost everybody's story is the same.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,420
We start working pee-wee games, JV games,

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,960
we join a local high school association.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,000
I got in the ACC in '91,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,583
worked there until I
went in the NFL in '99.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,510
I was pretty successful in Europe

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,270
and they felt like I could
do the job in the NFL.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,000
I was then the principal at
a local elementary school.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,290
I told my secretary,

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,970
if two people call,

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,850
you get me on that radio immediately.

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,770
The first one is my wife,

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,723
and the second one is Jerry Seeman.

20
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,810
Jerry Seeman was the
supervisor of officials.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,390
He was the one that was gonna call you

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,320
and let you know you gonna be in the NFL.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,867
My secretary, she said,

24
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,740
"Jerry Seeman is on the phone."

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,360
I said, "I'll be there!"

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,780
So I ran up the hall.

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,177
He went on to say,

28
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,257
"We've been watching you
for the last couple years"

29
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:28,340
"and we want to invite
you to come into the NFL."

30
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,470
You have seven guys on
the field on each crew.

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,890
All of us have different responsibilities.

32
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,110
There's a little bit of frustration there

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,384
sometimes on the coaches,

34
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:39,830
you know, not necessarily
knowing where we're looking

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,090
and who's looking at what.

36
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,900
The line judges and down judges,

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,270
we're counting the offense,

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,930
we signal to each other we've
got 11 offensive players,

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,577
and then we go into the false starts,

40
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,130
encroachments, offsides.

41
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,713
There's a lot of communication.

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,980
I would try to let them
have an opportunity

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,490
to tell me in a gentlemanly way

44
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,880
what their concern was.

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,000
And I would try to respond to
that in a very low-key way.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,752
Not lose my cool.

47
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:13,640
I always thought that I
had a pretty good rapport

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,650
with these coaches.

49
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,330
Kind of the same way, I would
let them have their say,

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,930
I'd respond, and hopefully
we could talk it out.

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,850
I'm not gonna convince him that
I'm right most of the time.

52
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,847
Now, I have told them,

53
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,447
"I understand, but that's enough."

54
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,322
"I don't want to hear about it anymore."

55
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,930
During the game, the
players have an opportunity

56
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,500
to go over to the bench and sit down.

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,560
Referees never sit down.

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,210
We're up the whole game.

59
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,993
Three times a week, I would
ride the stationary bikes,

60
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,993
and then twice a week, I would swim.

61
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:54,340
It is very lucrative.

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,500
We have our own union that helps us

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,510
in our contract negotiations.

64
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,837
We have a 401k.

65
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:02,160
It's a lot like teacher pay.

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,460
Teachers are on a scale.

67
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,540
You start off as a starting teacher,

68
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,970
and you bump up every year.

69
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,387
And that's the same way it is in the NFL.

70
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,950
It's a part-time, full-time job.

71
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,100
When the season is over,

72
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,760
I would start first of
February or middle of February

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,380
studying the rules, looking at video.

74
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,601
So it really never stops.

75
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:26,230
One of my good buddies, Tony Steratore,

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,740
he summed it up pretty good.

77
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,717
He said, "Even when you're in church,"

78
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,987
"you're thinking about
something that's going on"

79
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:33,530
"in the NFL."

80
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,713
That's a pretty good
description of the way it is.

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,270
- [Interviewer] Have you ever
been in a situation where

82
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,250
you really had to go to the bathroom

83
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,237
in the middle of the game?

84
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:45,630
- (laughing) Everybody does!

85
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,560
The players, the coaches, the officials.

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,707
You tell somebody on your crew,

87
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,870
"I'm going to the restroom.
Don't start until I get back."

88
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,500
I think I was in Cleveland one time,

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,030
I went running in there,

90
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,170
and the door was locked.

91
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,659
Somebody was in there and
it was just the one stall.

92
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,270
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh!"

93
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,440
So I'm standing out there,

94
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,670
waiting, waiting, waiting,

95
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,910
looking at my watch, timing the time-out,

96
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,010
the guy came out with
about 30 seconds left

97
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,499
and I actually was able to go in,

98
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,549
get out, and I literally
came running back in

99
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,940
on the field as the
referee was getting ready

100
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,779
to mark the ball ready.

101
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,719
The other six guys out there with me

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,011
were just laughing and carrying on.

103
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,337
"That's the fastest you've run in years"

104
00:04:23,337 --> 00:00:00,000
"to get back out here," and you know.
