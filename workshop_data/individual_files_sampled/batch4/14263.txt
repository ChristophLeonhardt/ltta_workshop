in this case this pipeline extension was approved by the Trudeau government they sought the support of the local communities they used existing Canadian law and they followed the extended due diligence process to ensure this pipeline extension was approved so you know what I'm seeing and what I did in preparation for this interview is reach out to some of the contacts I have within the senior ranks of the RCMP and they're demoralized over the charges that are being laid and the sentences that are being or or what charges they're limited to Lane they're demoralized over the fact that officers are being injured and they're not seen the risk or the support from the federal provincial or county level you know so we're moving into an area where you have civil disobedience getting out of hand to the point of willful violence and damage and the authorities not being respected by either side by the protest side or by those in government that are supposed to back them up isn't that interesting so the local RCMP are telling you off the record that they feel like they're being ignored as namely wrong isn't even the right word that that they're not being supported that when people physically assault them like in one case and our CMP officer was kicked in the head the officer here I mean this weekend he wasn't badly injured but he's got to take two weeks off because of an injury to his knee that's bad enough I've never taken two weeks off work for an injury no statement from the premier no statement from the mayor no statement from the Prime Minister and and not even from the Public Security Minister or the head of the RCMP your rights as if they're it's as if the cops are the pariahs here that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Azrael avance show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
