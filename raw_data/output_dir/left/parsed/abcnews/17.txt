>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING TO YOU WITH MAJOR 
BREAKING NEWS FROM THE WORLD OF 
POLITICS.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTHONY M.
KENNEDY ANNOUNCING HE WILL 
RETIRE THIS LEAVES A MAJOR 
OPENING ON THE SUPREME COURT OF 
THE UNITED STATES FOR PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP TO FILL.
KENNEDY A KEY JUST OIS THE 
SUPREME COURT.
LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO OUR CHIEF 
ANCHOR GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS 
WITH WHAT THIS MEANS.
GEORGE, BREAK IT DOWN FOR US.
>> THIS IS TITANIC, DAN.
THIS IS BIG BREAKING NEWS, AS 
YOU SAID.
NOT ONLY HAS JUSTICE KENNEDY 
BEEN A KEY SWING VOTE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT.
HE HAS BEEN THE SWING VOTE, THE 
DECIDING JUSTICE IN SO MANY 
CLOSELY HELD, 5 TO 4 DECISIONS.
ONE OF THE FEW JUSTICES EXCEPT 
PERHAPS JUSTICE ROBERTS ON A 
COUPLE OF CASES WILLING TO SIDE 
WITH THE DEMOCRATS, A JUSTICE 
APPOINTED BY DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTS ON THE SUPREME COURT 
ON ISSUES LIKE GAY RIGHTS, GAY 
MARRIAGE, ABORTION, SO MANY 
OTHER KEY SOCIAL ISSUES, JUSTICE
KENNEDY HAS BEEN THE KEY VOTE.
THIS IS SETTING UP A MASSIVE 
BATTLE FOR THE SUPREME COURT.
IT GIVES PRESIDENT TRUMP A 
CHANCE TO PUT A DECISIVE STAMP 
ON THE SUPREME COURT, BUT YOU 
CAN EXPECT DEMOCRATS TO LOOK AT 
ANYONE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
APPOINTS TO THE SUPREME COURT 
WITH A C CLOSE EYE OF SCRUTINY, 
FIGHTING IT ALL THE WAY.
WHAT THEY REMEMBERS WHEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A CHANCE TO 
APPOINT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
IN HIS LAST YEAR REPUBLICANS 
BLOCKED IT, DID NOT LET THEM 
FILL THE VACANCY.
THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT THIS 
HARD. 
>> GEORGE, LET'S PUT UP A LIST 
OF THE CURRENT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES.
YOU CAN SEE VIEWERS AT HOME WILL
BE ABLE TO SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE 
OF THE SCREEN, THOSE WHO LEAN 
LIBERAL AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
THOSE WHO LEAN CONSERVATIVE.
KENNEDY OCCUPYING THAT KEY, 
CENTRAL, MIDDLE SPOT THERE.
TALK TO US, AGAIN, ABOUT HIS KEY
ROLE AND WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR 
THE COURT GOING FORWARD IF 
DONALD J. TRUMP CAN PLACE HIS 
PICK IN HIS STEAD?
>> WELL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
LIST OF JUDGES THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS CONSIDERING TO THE 
SUPREME COURT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
NEIL GORSUCH, HIS FIRST PICK OF 
THE SUPREME COURT WITH THE 
VACANCY HE WAS ABLE TO FILL LAST
YEAR.
HE IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO 
APPOINT SOMEONE WHO IS MUCH MORE
IN THE MODE OF JUSTICE ALITO, 
JUSTICE TOM A A SOLID 
CONSERVATIVE ON THE COURT RATHER
THAN SOMEONE LIKE JUSTICE 
KENNEDY WHO HAS BEEN SOMEONE WHO
HAS MOVED BETWEEN THE 
COALITIONS, MOVED BETWEEN THE 
LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES ON 
DIFFERENT ISSUES IN ORDER TO 
FORM THOSE 5 TO 4 MAJORITIES.
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS HIS WAY 
WITH WHOEVER HE APPOINTS, HE IS 
GOING TO HAVE A SUPREME COURT 
THAT IS DECIDEDLY CONSCONSERVAT 
THAT IS ABLE TO FORM A MUCH MORE
DECISIVE MAJORITY AROUND SOME OF
THESE BIG ISSUES. 
>> LET'S GIVE IT TO ABC NEWS 
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 
JOHN CARL WHO IS STANDING BY IN 
THE WASHINGTON BUREAU.
GIVE US A SENSE, I KNOW THIS IS 
EXTREMELY EARLY AND THIS NEWS IS
MINUTES OLD AND HOW LIKELY IS IT
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BE ABLE TO 
GET HIS PICK THROUGH?
>> I THINK IT WILL BE AN EPIC 
BATTLE AS GEORGE JUST MENTIONED,
BUT I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE 
INVOLVED ON THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM
ON THIS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO 
PUSH TO GET A PERSON NOMINATED 
AND CONFIRMED BEFORE THE MIDTERM
ELECTIONS.
THAT WILL BE A MONUMENTAL TASK.
DEMOCRATS WILL DO EVERYTHING IN 
THEIR POWER TO PREVENT THAT FROM
HAPPENING.
REMEMBER, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 
RIGHT NOW, DAN, SIMPLY A 
ONE-SEAT MAJORITY IN THE SENATE 
THANKS TO THE WAY THEY HAVE 
CHANGED THE RULES, THEY CAN 
CONFIRM A JUSTICE ON A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY AND THEY WILL WANT TO 
GET THIS DONE BEFORE THE MIDTERM
ELECTIONS, BEFORE THERE IS ANY 
CHANCE THAT THAT MAJORITY GOES 
AWAY, AND I AM TOLD ALSO THAT 
THAT LIST THAT YOU HEARD GEORGE 
MENTION, THE LIST OF 
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES THAT THE 
PRESIDENT-ELECT BACK IN 
NOVEMBER, AFTER THE ELECTION PUT
OUT IS THE LIST THEY'LL BE GOING
FROM TO LOOK FOR A REPLACEMENT 
FOR KENNEDY.
IN OTHER WORDS, A HARD-LINE 
CONSERVATIVE.
THE PEOPLE ON THE PRESIDENT'S 
TEAM INVOLVED IN THIS DO NOT 
BELIEVE IN THE TRADITION OF YOU 
REPLACE A MODERATE WITH A 
MODERATE.
THERE WILL BE AN EFFORT TO 
REPLACE KENNEDY WITH SOMEBODY 
THAT WOULD DECISIVELY SWAY THE 
BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE U.S. 
SENATE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT 
WILL ALL COME DOWN TO THE UNITED
STATES SENATE AND AS YOU SAID, 
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A ONE-VOTE 
MAJORITY THERE.
SO THERE ARE REPUBLICAN SENATORS
WHO HAVE CONTENTIOUS 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES, JOHN 
McCAIN COMES TO MIND, JEFF FLAKE
FROM ARIZONA COMES TO MIND.
SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD 
SEE MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
OWN PARTY STOP HIM ON THIS?
>> NO QUESTION.
ALSO, THERE IS A QUESTION OF 
JOHN McCAIN HAS NOT BEEN IN 
WASHINGTON FOR A VOTE FOR SOME 
TIME, OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING FROM 
BRAIN CANCER.
HE'S BEEN BACK IN ARIZONA.
THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR
NOT HE WOULD EVEN BE HERE TO 
CAST A VOTE, A VOTE WHICH THEY 
WOULD NEED POTENTIALLY, AND ALSO
YOU HAVE SUSAN COLLINS WHO 
HASN'T HAD AS OPENLY A 
CONTENTIOUS A RELATIONSHIP AS 
SOMEONE LIKE JEFF FLAKE OR JOHN 
McCAIN, BUT WHO IS VERY MUCH A 
MODERATE PRO-ABORTION RIGHTS 
REPUBLICAN WHO COULD POTENTIALLY
BALK AT THE IDEA OF SOMEBODY 
THAT WOULD DO AWAY, FOR 
INSTANCE, WITH ROE V. WADE, THE 
DECISIVE VOTE TO DO AWAY WITH 
ROE V. WADE.
EVEN IF THE REPUBLICANS, EVEN IF
THE PRESIDENT CAN MANAGE TO GET 
SOMEBODY NOMINATED, TO GET 
THROUGH A CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 
AND GET TO A VOTE ON THE U.S. 
SENATE BEFORE THE MIDTERMS WITH 
THE ONE-SEAT MAJORITY, IT WILL 
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET 
SOMEBODY FROM THIS LIST OF 
JUDGES THAT THEY'RE WORKING 
FROM.
>> LET'S BRING BACK IN OUR CHIEF
ANCHOR GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ON 
THE PHONE WHO WANTS TO WEIGH IN 
ON THIS SCORE.
GEORGE?
>> LET ME PICK UP THAT.
JOHN IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
THERE WILL BE ENORMOUS PRESSURE 
ON EVERY REPUBLICAN TO HANG 
TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 
APPROVE HIS NOMINEE.
JUDGES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE 
POLICY ISSUES THAT'S BEEN A GLUE
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH THE 
ONE-SEAT MAJORITY THAT JOHN IS 
TALKING ABOUT, EVERY SENATOR, 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR WILL HAVE 
TREMENDOUS LEVERAGE.
YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE LIKE JEFF 
FLAKE, YOU MENTIONED HIM, BOB 
CORKER, FROM TENNESSEE, BOTH 
WILL BE RETIRING FROM THE SENATE
AND SENATOR FLAKE ESPECIALLY HAS
TALKED ABOUT HOLDING UP JUDICIAL
NOMINATIONS IF HE DOESN'T GET 
HIS WAY, IF THE PRESIDENT IS 
IMPOSING TARIFFS AND OTHER 
REPUBLICAN ISSUES AND BOB CORKER
HAS BEEN QUITE CRITICAL OF THE 
PRESIDENT.
AS JOHN MENTIONED, ALSO SENATOR 
LISA MURKOWSKI WOULD BE ANOTHER 
SEN
SENATOR WHO WOULD BE RELUCTANT 
FOR A JUSTICE THAT WOULD 
OVERTURN ROE V. WADE.
THIS WILL BE A MONUMENTAL BATTLE
AND THERE IS A QUESTION ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE.
YOU'VE GOT DEMOCRATS IN RED 
STATES WHO ARE UP FOR 
RE-ELECTION.
JOE MANCHIN IN WEST VIRGINIA, 
AND HEIDI WHO WILL VOTE AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENT AND AGAINST THEIR 
PARTY AND THIS IS THE KIND OF 
ISSUE THAT TENDS TO GALVANIZE 
PARTIES AND TENDS TO BRING THEM 
TOGETHER.
I REALLY CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW BIG
A BATTLE THIS IS GOING TO BE. 
>> AS IF WE DID NOT ALREADY LIVE
IN INTERESTING TIMES.
LET'S BRING IN ABC NEWS SUPREME 
COURT REPORTER TERRY MORAN WHO 
HAS BEEN COVERING THEM FOR MANY,
MANY YEARS.
WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY,
IN PARTICULAR, HE MADE HIS MARK 
ON GAY RIGHTS.
>> HE DID.
HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A 
GREAT JUSTICE AT THE VANGUARD OF
THE GAY LIBERATION MOVEMENT IN 
THE LAW, AND AN UNLIKELY 
CANDIDATE.
HE WAS ORIGINALLY, 30 YEARS AGO 
NOW, HE CAME TO THE COURT AFTER 
THE NOMINATION OF ROBERT BORK, 
THE STAUNCH CONSERVATIVE FAIL 
AND THAT WAS THE MOST EPIC 
BATTLE TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT
ANYONE HAD SEEN UP TO THAT TIME 
AND IT MAKES SENSE IN SOME WAYS 
THAT KENNEDY'S REPLACEMENT WILL 
FACE A SIMILAR EPIC BATTLE, BUT 
IN ADDITION TO GAY RIGHTS, 
JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT IN OTHER FIELDS, AS 
WELL.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE CAME ON THE
COURT THERE WAS A BATTLE TO 
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE AND 
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT AT THE TIME 
THAT HE WOULD BE THE VOTE TO 
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE.
HE HELPED PRESERVE THE CORE OF 
THAT DECISION AND NOW IF HE 
LEAVES IT IS ONCE AGAIN AN OPEN 
QUESTION ABOUT THAT DECISION AND
OTHER, BUT HE LEAVES A LEGACY OF
A LIBERTARIAN BEND AND A GENTLE 
APPROACH, IN MANY WAYS THAT IS, 
FRANKLY, OUT OF STEP WITH THE 
TIMES THAT WE'RE IN TODAY. 
>> TERRY MORAN, JOHN KARL AND 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, THANK 
YOU.
>>> JUSTICE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY 
STEPPING DOWN FROM THE SUPREME 
COURT AT THE AGE OF 81 YEARS OLD
AFTER 30 MONUMENTAL YEARS ON THE
COURT.
THIS IS A HUGE BREAKING NEWS 
STORY.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO COVER IT ALL
DAY LONG ON ABC NEWS RADIO AND 
ABCNEWS.COM.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE COMING UP 
ON "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" WITH 
DAVID MUIR.
FOR NOW, I'M DAN HARRIS IN NEW 
YORK.
THANK YOU.
>>> THIS HAS BEEN A SPECIAL 
REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
M ABC  AN E
JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME
COURT AND TAKING SENIOR STATUS
EFFECTIVE JULY 31.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO
PAUSE AND EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE
FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE
THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY HAS OFFERED
OUR NATION.
HE SERVED ON THE FEDERAL BENCH
FOR 43 YEARS.
IN PARTICULAR, WE OWE HIM A DEBT
OF THANKS FOR HIS ARDENT DEFENSE
OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE
FIRST KENNEDY CONCLUDES HIS
TENURE ON THE COURT, WE WISH
HIM, HIS WIFE MARY AND THEIR
FAMILY EVERY HAPPINESS IN THE
YEARS AHEAD.
THE SENATE STANDS READY TO
FULFILL ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE
BY OFFERING ADVICE AND CONSENT
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO
FILL THIS VACANCY.
WE WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM JUSTICE
KENNEDY'S SUCCESSOR THIS FALL.
AS IN THE CASE OF JUSTICE
GORSUCH, SENATORS WILL HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE,
EXAMINE HIS OR HER
QUALIFICATIONS, AND DEBATE THE
NOMINATION.
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY'S CONDUCT IN
THE PROCESS OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE BE
CONSIDERED FAIRLY AND NOT
SUBJECTED TO PERSONAL ATTACKS.
THUS FAR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS HAVE
REFLECTED A KEEN UNDERSTANDING
OF THE VITAL ROLES THAT JUSTICES
PLAY IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL
ORDER.
JUSTICES MUST APPLY THE LAW
FAIRLY AND APPLY IT
EVENHANDEDLY.
JUDICIAL DECISIONS SHOULD NOT
FLOW FROM A JUSTICE'S
PHILOSOPHIES OR PREFERENCES BUT
FROM THE WORDS AND ACTUAL
MEANING OF THE LAW.
THIS BEDROCK PRINCIPLE HAS
CLEARLY DEFINED THE PRESIDENT'S
EXCELLENT CHOICES TO DATE.
SO WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO YET
ANOTHER OUTSTANDING SELECTION,
BUT TODAY THE SENATE AND THE
NATION THANK JUSTICE KENNEDY FOR
HIS YEARS OF SERVICE ON THE
BENCH AND HIS MANY YEARS OF
CONTRIBUTION TO JURISPRUDENCE
AND TO OUR NATION.
I SUGGEST THE ABSENCE OF A
QUORUM.
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE CLERK
WILL CALL THE ROLL.
QUORUM CALL:
