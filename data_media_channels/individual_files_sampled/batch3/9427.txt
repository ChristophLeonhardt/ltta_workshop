Tucker: GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT." THIS IS THE TENTH DAY IN A ROW THAT WE HAVE DEVOTED A LARGE PORTION OF THE SHOW TO BRETT KAVANAUGH'S SUPREME COURT NOMINATION. WE HAVE DONE THAT BECAUSE THE STORY MATTERS. NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF MATTERS. THE WAY KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN TREATED BY THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AS WELL AS BY THE MEDIA AND THE LEFT WING INTEREST GROUPS WHO DO THEIR BIDDING IN CONCERT GETS THE MOST BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO LIVE IN. DOES EVERY AMERICAN DESERVE DUE PROCESS? ARE THE ACCUSED PRESUMED INNOCENT RATHER THAN GUILTY? DOES FAIRNESS STILL MATTER IN THIS COUNTRY? WELL, TO ALL OF THOSE WE ANSWER YES. THE LEFT ARGUES NO. TO THEM ACQUIRING POWER JUSTIFYING ANYTHING. THAT IS THE REAL DEBATE HERE. WE THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. AFTER THE DEVELOPMENTS AND THERE ARE MANY. AFTER YESTERDAY'S HEARING, THE DEBATE MUST BE DRAWN TO A CLOSE. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WATCHING WHAT KAVANAUGH SAID TO THE SENATE YESTERDAY WITHOUT FEEL PROGRESS FOUND SYMPATHY. THIS IS A DEEPLY SINCERE MAN WHO BELIEVES HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY FALSE AND UNSUPPORTED ALLEGATIONS. MANY WEPT AS THEY WATCH HIM SPEAK. DEMOCRATS REMAINED UNMOVED. SOME ARGUE THAT KAVANAUGH'S ANGUISH WAS ITSELF EVIDENCE THAT HE IS A MONSTER. AS IF ONLY A SEX CRIMINAL WOULD RECOIL AT BEING CALLED A SEX CRIMINAL. A CALENDAR AND A DIARY. VERY ORGANIZED GUY TO PUT IT MILDLY. Tucker: WELL, THAT WAS THE WRONG SOUND BITE BUT YOU GET THE POINT. BARBARA BOXER EXPLAINED TODAY HIS ANGER ON STAGE MADE HER THINK HE WAS CAPABLE OF VIOLENCE. WOULD YOU BE ANGRY IF THEY SAID IT ABOUT YOU? NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T MEAN ANY OF THIS PERSONALLY. THEY DON'T HATE KAVANAUGH OR HIS FAMILY. THEY DON'T SEEK TO DESTROY EITHER ONE. THEY ARE JUST IRRELEVANT. DEMOCRATS JUST WANT TO BE IN CONTROL. SO YESTERDAY THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN STALLING FOR TIME AND THEY DID THAT DEMANDING A SEVENTH F.B.I. INVESTIGATION INTO KAVANAUGH'S LIFE. THE POINT IS RUN OUT THE CLOCK ON HIS NOMINATION. THEY CONTINUED THE TACTIC TODAY AT TWO HEARINGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RECONVENED. WATCH THIS. I CANNOT SIT HERE. I CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN WHAT I KNOW HISTORY WILL LOOK BACK AS A DARK MOMENT AGAIN IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE ANITA HILL AND CLARENCE THOMAS HEARING. I CAN'T PARTICIPATE AGAIN RELEGATE OURSELVES TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS A DARK, DARK ELEMENT OF THE SOCIETY. TO THAT, SIR, I WILL LEAVE. Tucker: THAT WAS NEW JERSEY SENATOR CORY BOOKER, A MAN SO OILY HE QUALIFIES AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL. ALMOST NOBODY WHO KNOWS BOOKER TAKES HIM SERIOUSLY. BUT TODAY HE FOUND AN ALLY, SURPRISINGLY AMONG REPUBLICANS. THAT WAS JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA. FLAKE DECLARED HE WOULD BE VOTING FOR KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. THEN HE WAS CONFRONTED BY A MOB OF PROTESTERS, THE YOUTH WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WATCH. YOU ARE ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO IS UNWILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS. TO SIT IN THE HIGHEST COURT OF THE COUNTRY. AND TO HAVE THE ROLE OF REPAIRING THE HARM THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS COUNTRY TO MANY PEOPLE. NO THANK YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU HAVE THE POWER. MA'AM, DO YOU WANT I WANT TO TALK TO HIM. DON'T TALK TO ME. I UNDERSTAND. BUT TELL ME I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE DO YOU THINK HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH? Tucker: WOW! THAT MAN LOOKS AFRAID AND ASHAMED. YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE SENATORS LOOK LIKE THAT. THIS KIND OF THING HAS BEEN HAPPENING A LOT IN WASHINGTON. I HAPPENED TO TED CRUZ WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE AT DINNER AND LEFT THE RESTAURANT. JEFF FLAKE CRUMBLED AND ANNOUNCED HE WOULD NOT APPROVE THE NOMINATION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL F.B.I. INVESTIGATION. DEMOCRATS CHEERED HIS CHANGE OF HEART. I APPLAUD SENATOR JEFF FLAKE'S DECISION TO RISE ABOVE THE PARTISAN CIRCUS ON DISPLAY IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS. JOE MANCHIN. BUT IN WASHINGTON WHEN THEY CONGRATULATE YOU ON LEAVING THE PARTISAN CIRCUS, CHANCES ARE YOU ARE NOW THE RING MASTER OF THE FOR MASTER OF THE CIRCUS. JEFF FLAKE IS THAT. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT DOESN'T MEAN A LOT. THE F.B.I. DOES NOT WANT THE CASE. THERE IS NOTHING TO INVESTIGATE HERE AND THEY SAID THAT DEFINITIVELY ALREADY. WEEKS AGO DIANNE FEINSTEIN SENT THEM CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD'S ORIGINAL LETTER AND THAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE. THIS IS NOT A FEDERAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. IT CANNOT BE. NO FEDERAL CRIME HAS BEEN ALLEGED. ONLY POLICE THE MARYLAND CAN CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS. THEY ARE NOT BECAUSE STRANGELY CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD NEVER FILED CHARGES AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE SHE SAID IT TOOK PLACE. INSTEAD THE F.B.I. WILL CONDUCT WHAT IS CALLED A SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION. AGENTS WILL INTERVIEW ONLY THOSE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD'S ORIGINAL ALLEGATION. IN THIS CASE, THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD AND BRETT KAVANAUGH, OF COURSE, ALONG WITH THE THREE PEOPLE FORD SAYS WERE PRESENT WHEN SHE WAS ATTACKED IN 182. THAT WOULD BE JUDGE, P.J. SMITH AND LEYLAND KAISER. THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL FIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN SWORN TESTIMONY. YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT THEY HAVE SAID. FOUR CATEGORICALLY DENIED UNDER OATH FORD'S VERSION OF THE STORY. IF THEY DEVIATE FROM THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY, THEY COULD FACE CRIMINAL PENALTIES. SO WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY LEARN FROM HAVING THE F.B.I. INTERVIEW THEM? KEEP IN MIND THAT THE F.B.I. MAKES NO JUDGMENTS IN THE INVESTIGATION. IT'S NOT ASSESSING CREDIBILITY OR RENDER ANY CONCLUSION. IT JUST DOES INTERVIEWS AND SUMMARIZES THEM FOR LAWMAKERS. THE F.B.I. NO MATTER WHAT THEY TELL YOU IS NOT A TIE-BREAKER IN THIS OR ANY OTHER INVESTIGATION. IT'S AN INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY THAT WILL PROVIDE THE SENATE WITH INFORMATION THAT SENATORS ALREADY HAVE. SO BRETT KAVANAUGH IS GOING TO GET INTERVIEWED AGAIN. YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GET A PROSTATE EXAM TO BE MORE THOROUGHLY VETTED THAN KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THEY MAY TRY THAT, TOO. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TRUTH THIS IS A POINTLESS EXERCISE. YOU WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT. BUT THE TRUTH IS NOT WHAT ANYONE IS LOOKING FOR HERE AS YOU MAY HAVE FIGURED OUT. DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING MORE BASELESS ALLEGATIONS WILL EMERGE IN THE DELAY, DURING WHICH THE F.B.I. IS INVESTIGATING THINGS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN INVESTIGATED. PERHAPS ANOTHER REPTILIAN PORN LAWYER WILL COME FORWARD WITH ANOTHER CLIENT WITH FANTASIES OF GANG RAPE OR MAYBE RITUAL SATANIC ABUSE. WHO KNOWS WHAT IT WILL BE? WHEN THE CHARGES EMERGE, THE DEMOCRATS WILL DEMAND NEW PUBLIC HEARINGS ON EVERY ONE OF THEM. DEMOCRACY HANGS IN THE BALANCE, THEY WILL TELL US. MEANING THE ACCESS TO POWER HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IT'S NOT A COMPLICATED FORMULA. EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A POOR JEFF FLAKE. PEOPLE WHO KNOW FLAKE SAY HE MAY BELIEVE DEMOCRATS ARE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. MAYBE HE IS AUDITIONING FOR A NEW EMPLOYER. HE IS LEAVING THE SENATE EARLY NEXT YEAR. EITHER WAY YOU HAVE TO BE AN IDIOT TO THINK CAVING TO THIS DEMAND WILL INDUCE THE DEMOCRATS TO CALL OFF THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY. THEY WON'T. THEY WILL ACCELERATE. WHY WOULDN'T THEY? IT'S WORKING. BUT THERE IS A COST. ESPECIALLY FOR REPUBLICANS. AT THIS POINT KAVANAUGH ISN'T JUST A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. HE IS A FOLK HERO TO MANY PEOPLE. INSPIRATION TO MILLIONS. PEOPLE WHO SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS BEING BROWBEATEN AND BULLIED BY THE MORAL INFOREYOURS WERE BUOYED INFERIORS WERE BUOYED BY WHAT HE SAID YESTERDAY. THEY ARE UNFAIRLY MALIGNED BECAUSE THEY IN THE WAY OF OTHER PEOPLE GAINING POWER AND HAVE BEEN COMMANDED TO SHUT UP AND OBEY. KAVANAUGH STOOD UP FOR THE PEOPLE YESTERDAY AND HE RAISED A MIDDLE FINGER TO THE TORMENTERS AND THEY LOVE HIM FOR IT. KAVANAUGH IS FAR MORE POPULAR WITH THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS TONIGHT THAN ANY SINGLE REPUBLICAN SENATOR. HI IS MORE POPULAR THAN THE SENATE AS A WHOLE. KAVANAUGH WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT
