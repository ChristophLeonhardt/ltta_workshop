we can ask a lot of questions but this
one question gets asked the most and
that's how to have a successful family
well there's a lot of factors one of the
first and most important factors is
communication so how is school
fine what did you learn nothing you want
to go outside and play no okay good talk
another factor for successful family is
respect mom I sit over at my friend's
house tonight whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
how come you don't ask me for permission
anyways as I was saying mom can I sleep
over at my friend's house tonight and
most importantly if you can't trust one
another you can't have a successful
family so Trust is very important can I
trust you yeah
yeah y'all
