well for weeks there's been a staring contest between Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump on the issue of tariffs in trade whether it's steel the auto sector or dairy things seem to be in hand until the g7 meeting in Quebec where they went off the rails so through a nun misunderstanding or a few careless comments and tweets oh my god it looks terrifying don't take it from me from a political point of view take it from two different Canadian banks that have run the numbers I have in front of me a report from TD Bank that says if this trade war actually comes to pass 160,000 Canadian jobs would be in jeopardy the Scotiabank says that such a trade war would shrink Canada's GDP by 1.8% we're talking about a recession is this going to happen and can we survive these aren't just hyperbole hyperbolic questions they're real-life now I think joining us now via Skype to talk about this is our friend Professor Ian Lee he's with the Sprott School of Business an associate professor at Carleton University professor Lee aye I'm sounding dramatic it's not me that's dramatic these numbers are terrifying there's also predictions that our dollar will fall into the 60 something cent range tell me how bad it would be if this Trump Trudeau trade war actually happened excellent question good to speak with you Ezra there's two separate issues the issue is how likely is it going to happen and if it did happen how bad will it be I'm actually of the view that it's the consequences are so bad that it won't happen you know this is almost like the logic of mutual assured destruction back in the in the old days between the United States and the Soviet Union the consequences of nuclear war were so awful to both sides the devastation of life was so awful it ensured he didn't happen but in that instance there was a rough equivalence both sides had enormous numbers of nuclear warheads in this instance my analogy falls and that falls down because we don't have lots and lots of nuclear warheads and something to continue my metaphor what I'm trying to say is the United States is ten times bigger and people say that ten times you know that's that big well it's sort of like a person who plays peewee hockey you know at the age of five or six saying I'm gonna get into a fight with an NHL professional hockey player that's not a contest I mean it wouldn't shouldn't even be allowed to be child abuse abuse because that small child would just be you know it would be horrible what happened in the maybe oh gotta fight with a huge hockey player the the numbers in these two studies are showing a that were one-tenth the size of the United States they also show the incredible dependence of our economy on the United States to put this as bluntly as at Cannon I know it's very politically incorrect right now but we need the United States far far more than the United States needs Canada and I know it's you know where there's a lot of people you know pounding their chests and and saying you know let's stand up that that bully Donald Trump you know and poke him in the eye because he's rude and all those you know things my late mother who was a very very practical person never went to university grew up in depression Saskatchewan actually and she used to tell me over and over and over when I was a kid you know you don't cut off your nose to spite your face yeah and if we get into a trade war with the United States we are truly cutting off our nose to spite our face and we are going to hurt ourselves we're not going to hurt the United States yeah well and there's those are the two opposing forces politically it's like catnip to politicians especially those on the left to demonize Trump it's it's the easy thing Hollywood's behind it the media are generally behind it is so you get applause from certain quarters but so that's tempting to a politician applause and moral support and maybe Saturday Night Live will cheer for you but on the other hand that economic devastation here's what I think is different about Trump and you can love him or hate him but I think Professor when he taught about trade wars this is not something he's just discovered in the last year I've seen interviews of Trump in the 80s on The Oprah Winfrey Show talking about trade barriers so I this isn't some casual thing he's trying out he's been thinking about it for decades and I see he just got tough with Chinese tariffs besides an enormous scale here's my here's my question people who think Trump is bluffing in a poker game that he would never do it because of you know like you say the mutually assured destruction Trump not only do I not think he's bluffing on Canada we see he's not bluffing with Mikey China and so here's my question I'm sorry I'm I'm just giving you some of my thoughts but my question is do you think there are cooler heads in Ottawa who would say whenever you think of Trump this man has ice in his veins on tariffs and if he's willing to fight China he'll fight us too Azariah I completely agree I've been saying this for two years just let me deal with quickly with your first point Trump did not just suddenly wake up one morning you know and and say gee whiz I think I'm gonna start you know yelling and bluffing blustering the neighbors over trade I went back and read just after it became the candidate for the Republican Party I read every economic speech that he had given to that point and I've read every economic speech he's given since that it could be classified as at a speech on trade and investment this is his issue this I believe it's not so much immigration I'm not suggesting immigration is unimportant what I'm saying is the the trade file this sense that America has been taken advantage of by by its allies and its enemies or the last 30 40 50 years is deep in Donald Trump's psyche point one point to this is not all by itself in Donald Trump's head there are large numbers of Americans I have traveled on road trips across many states as Lia's last summer to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame went to Canton Ohio and went to Cleveland Ohio went across upstate New York and upstate Pennsylvania and we drive down there every year to help them head and we peach speak spoken to people in rural South Carolina or rural North Carolina if you get outside the big cities the San Francisco's the Chicago's the New York's where the very well-educated and high income wealthy and opera middle class and elites live they're doing fine but you get out to the small towns the rural the semi world the burbs the exurbs and there's it's a completely different America and he resonates because they feel that they have been exploited that they have been taken advantage of and so Trump is absolutely sincere and real on this whether we hate him or not whether we like him or not he is absolutely authentic he is going to deliver on this because he is too convinced this is going to get yeah he's gonna maintain control of the of the Congress of the US House this fall and ensure his reelection in 2020 so yes he has ice in his veins the second part of your question very quickly Ezra are there people in the Ottawa bubble and I'm obviously being a bit you know sarcastic when I say that are other people in the Ottawa bubble understand that I'm not sure and I've lived here all my life but you know the there's such a contempt towards and dislike towards Trump that I think it is clouded the thinking of people many people in Ottawa for some say Oh will stand up to the bully not having any sense that we don't have the capacity to stand up to an economy that's ten times larger then there's others who don't think that Trump is going to do it that he's just bluffing and so we've backed ourselves into a corner I believe that mr. Trudeau went into the NAFTA negotiations and mr. Eiland making a huge strategic mistake they went in saying we're going to protect those six or seven or eight protected industries we're going to defend them to the death instead of going in and saying we must have access for all 36 million Canadians to the totality of the American economy without tariffs and with the dispute mechanism and to a that and we everything is on the table Telecom Canadian Telecom Dairy Supply Management's banking airlines etc instead they didn't they went in and said we're gonna stand up to the bully and we're gonna keep protecting our protected industries I think that this was an enormous strategic mistake and and there are all those strange obsessions with gender analysis and global warming things that you know I'm against some substantive lis but even from a prosperous has point of view put them in another treaty not a trade treaty you want to talk about gender what's that doing in and after let me ask you what is what scares me Detroit Michigan Ohio these places you mentioned they're hurting they were called the Rust Belt for so long as in the used to be the steel belt but it got worn out and obsolete trumpet said I'm bringing the factories back yes it's focused with Mexico but now we're on his radar screen and that's bad I think I understand that Canada exports many more cars to the States than we import if Ontario hates trumpet I don't think all Ontarians do but the leadership does what does Trump care he doesn't have any votes in Ontario if he moves some of those big factories from Windsor from Oakville back into Detroit and Ohio he'll have a lock on those states forever and yeah people in Ontario and Quebec will be very upset with that but they don't vote in the electoral college I am truly were I don't think we were on his radar I think he was focused on China and Mexico and we just sort of flicked his nose once too many times what do you think the likelihood is the Trump is saying the heck with it if I bring a million or even a half a million more car production a year to Ohio Michigan people will say he did it Trump did it he brought industry back and he'll be assured of a reelection I think that's so tempting Trudeau doesn't have anything to offer that's more tempting I agree and that's my real fear I have said over and over he doesn't care what the voters of Mexico or Canada or Germany or France or UK or anywhere else they say or think they're not going to vote for him he knows that he knows that he was elected by the thinnest of margins in three states that put him there I'm referring to Michigan I'm referring to Ohio I'm referring to Pennsylvania and in and I have driven through those states I mean as recently as only two months ago and there is again it's not I don't think Canadians really have this full accurate sense of what's going on he is popular in these blue-collar and neighborhoods and communities Scranton Pennsylvania for example where you know they are not as prosperous I mean it's obvious with the eye you don't have to look at statistics you can see it you know just in the housing and the cars and and so forth and they like him they respect him because they think he is standing up for them and and this is what people in Canada don't realize and that's why again I I said I think that mr. Trudeau has made a serious mistake with miss Freeland in negotiating instead of saying what can we offer up in order to assure as much as possible guaranteed access to the entire US market of 20 trillion dollars instead we got so focused on defending 9,000 dairy farmers and and several thousand workers in the telecom industry that he's lost sight of the grand prize which is that our economy is completely dependent on the US and we must have access to the entire US economy and we risk losing that because of our I think in intransigence in negotiating after yeah I tell you I wish there was some elder statesman even if it was from a different party I know I just sense in my bones that Brian Mulroney would help if asked I think that he even John Craig Chen I mean he's he's a proud Canadian and he's poked to the US and his day I think Gretchen's a deal maker by Nature I actually think he could even help and I'm not a super fan of his I think even Stephen Harper in his own way is trying to smooth things over I put this out on Twitter the other day Conrad black former personal friend of Trump who did business with him in Chicago there are elder statesman type characters who don't have the Trump derangement syndrome in them and who understand what's at stake I just don't know if there's anyone in Trudeau's circle that could let go of the steering wheel and let a grown up take over last word to you professor I listen I'm a critic of Trudeau's for partisan reasons but God forbid we lose Canada's auto industry in ain't never coming back and we've already lost so much of our oil and gas industry is there a way that some elder statesman even if he's from another party even if it's Frank McKenna who I think did a good job as as an ambassador down there is there someone that can maybe help straighten things out I do believe there is and again it goes back to a mistake I'm not a partisan I don't belong to any political party I do not donate money to any political party but I think that mr. Trudeau when he did after he became the leader as we all know he famously threw out the elders in the Liberal Party many of them were blue liberals which is the word we give for business liberals whom I do respect I include Frank McKenna in that I include Josh RA who I have enormous respect for Robert Bourassa the late Robert Burris a manly maybe John manly there are I'm hoping that a group of senior elder liberal and genre chess approached mr. Trudeau very privately quietly and say look mr. Trudeau you you've had 24 months to try out that progressive agenda of yours and it has failed miserably and we're at risk were risking the entire economy of Canada and they could provide to call it a back room kitchen cabinet to him or this crisis and then give him the advice that he's clearly not receiving from his aides of the PMO or his cabinet ministers well I tell you for the sake of so much of our industrial economy I hope we get it back on track professor you've been very generous with your time thanks so much for your point of view and God willing one of those elder statesmen in the Liberal Party at least will be able to get through to Trudeau and pull him off his collision course thanks for your time today professor my pleasure Ezra thanks very much all right there you have a professor Ian Lee he's with the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
