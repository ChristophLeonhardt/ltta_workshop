well Donald Trump and his minions were quick to claim that James commis testimony last week cleared him that there's no story anymore there's their comments since then about Bob Muller's status as the special counsel indicate that they might well not be as confident as they're letting on newt gingrich who we know has an interesting relationship with donald trump tweeted this republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair look who is hiring check FEC reports time to rethink he's apparently been doing some rethinking because earlier he tweeted this Bob Muller is superb choice to be special counsel his reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity media should now calm down knew you might well want to calm down because asking tweeted earlier yeah things come at you fast on Twitter sometimes put those next to each other I mean we're basically talking about less than a month you Bertha sex but from a guy who is obviously has so much honesty and integrity that people cannot attack him to dear God get this guy out of here as quick as possible I have a feeling Newt Gingrich was familiar with Muller before the first tweet was sent I don't think it was a new name to him necessarily but he then went on I believe on Sunday he was on a radio show and he said this key thing to me was that I think Congress should now intervene and should abolish the independent counsel because Comey makes so clear that it's the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking the New York Times deliberately set up this particular situation I think very sick why does he matter honestly why do we matter anymore I mean he his name comes up when positions are possible rings in the Trump administration I'm not entirely sure I don't know where he opens his mouth and he's a compelling talking exactly he's an articulate spokesman for the right and he is showing up a lot in media and in this environment showing up a lot in media makes a difference or I think really that is you universe yeah yeah I I sort of used him as a shorthand for Media Matters has a great compilation that they put out a day or two ago of this sort of talking point there was a meet law news had an editorial over the weekend that obviously Muller has to recuse himself on anything having to do with James Comey in any number of right-wingers on the radio or online are now pushing this idea that he is obviously flawed he's obviously biased both call me but but also Muller uh and I don't think that they would be saying that again all this behavior from Donald Trump before the firing of Comey how he's responded after the firing and now the way his defenders are protecting him this is not the behavior of people who believe there's nothing to be found that think that if this investigation continued there'd be no they're there they're acting like people who are walking the plank and they're trying to talk their way out of it before they have to step off that's what it seems like to me I know you're thinking Jake what do I get if I'm a Young Turks member well I'm glad you asked not only to get the whole two-hour show on the man anytime you want and free but you get six podcasts on top what I think a join up find out they're amazing you're gonna love these shows TYT Network dot-com slash join
