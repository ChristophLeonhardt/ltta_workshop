1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
so in response to president Trump's
firing a ban and you tweeted quote glad

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,080
to see ban and gone he never belonged in
the White House but the problem persists

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,429
since the most profound source of
division cannot be fired your position

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,750
on President Trump and ban and clear
there but let me ask you is there anyone

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,939
else in the White House that you think
should not be there you know there's

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,840
certainly a lot of people on the White
House staff and NSC staff that shouldn't

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,340
be there people like Miller and Gorka
and others who not only I think

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,549
represent the same thing that's the
abandoned did but aren't capable of

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,809
doing the job well so yes I think
there's more cleaning house that ought

10
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,460
to take place but as I mentioned in that
tweet Jake the more fundamental problem

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,480
is at the very top I think what the
President had to say about the

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,760
demonstrations in Boston else or was
perfectly fine perfectly unobjectionable

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,100
but also perfectly inadequate after that
debacle of a press conference he had

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,449
supposedly on infrastructure you know
the real I think challenge and job for

15
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,989
the chief executive in a country where
race has always been such a difficult

16
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,070
conversation is to do everything
possible to bring our country together

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,530
to help make us a more perfect union and
what the president did this week was as

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,600
if he stood on a line dividing the
country and pushed it to separate one

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,860
American from another with all this Mike
and that is not what this country needs

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,729
after President Trump's comments
appearing to equate white supremacists

21
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,180
and the counter protesters your fellow
Democrat on the House Intelligence

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,500
Committee Jackie Speier tweeted quote
POTUS is showing signs of erratic

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,850
behavior and mental instability that
place the country in grave danger time

24
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,540
to invoke the 25th amendment that's the
amendment that would allow the removal

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,250
of the president do you agree that
President Trump is mentally unstable

26
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,939
well I certainly think that there's an
issue with the president's capability

27
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,560
there's some attribute of his character
that makes him seemingly incapable of

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,700
introspection and and and a broad
understanding of what the country really

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,740
needs and I think it's a question that
people are asking you know what is going

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,099
on with this president what could
explain this kind of behavior you know

31
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,480
it began at the very beginning
I remember when he had won the election

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,480
and within days seemed to suggest that
the only reason he didn't win the

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,670
popular vote was that millions of people
illegally came to the country and voted

34
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,319
and I thought to myself oh my god this
man is not only going to not grow with

35
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,909
the job but is willing to state things
that are just patently untrue I'm

36
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,299
convinced you if you took somebody off
the street of America and you said

37
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,900
you've just become president but here's
the deal you didn't win the popular vote

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,129
they would have the common sense to say
look I'm going to do everything I can to

39
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,400
win over everyone I realized that many
people indeed most people didn't vote

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,430
for me
but but he didn't do that he's not

41
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,750
capable of doing that and I don't
understand why but I do recognize what a

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,560
serious problem it is and I think more
than when I say it or when Jackie Speier

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,510
says it the fact that bob Corker now
says things along the same lines shows a

44
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,400
broadening recognition that there were
some serious issues with our president

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,909
that aren't going to go away that aren't
going to get better and indeed with the

46
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,900
pressures of the job may very well get
worse and I think for that reason at a

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,000
minimum we need the very best people
around him in the White House and and

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,449
that means that not people like bana and
not people like Miller not people like

49
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,359
Gorka but rather some more adults in the
room it sounds like you're saying that

50
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,680
you don't disagree with jackie speier
who said that president Trump is showing

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,849
signs of erratic behavior mental
instability and it so it sounds like

52
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,549
you're not disagreeing with that what
about the 25th amendment part which

53
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,159
would call for the removal of the
president are you you agree with that

54
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,879
you know I don't think we're at a point
of thinking about the 25th amendment you

55
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,759
know for one thing this is something
that the vice president cabinet would

56
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,900
need to come together on I think what
the authors of that amendment

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,280
principally had in mind was some kind of
physical incapacitation or serious

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,799
mental illness or a breakdown an
inability to function in office and I

59
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,540
think we're still far from concluding
that that's the case even though we find

60
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,899
many of us his conduct anathema and
there to be a serious problem here but I

61
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,460
don't think it you know particularly at
this point in time makes a lot of sense

62
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,710
to focus on the 25th amendment
I do think

63
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,889
means that we have to put real
constraints on this president we have to

64
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,970
make sure that our system of checks and
balances in Congress work I think

65
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,810
frankly the most powerful thing we could
do rather than pursue the 25th amendment

66
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,940
at this point is make sure that one
house or the other and ideally both are

67
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,800
in democratic hands frankly the hands of
a party not in the white house to be a

68
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,150
more effective check on on some of the
damage this president can do congressman

69
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,300
let me ask you President Trump was
obviously widely condemned for his

70
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,419
comments in which he seemed to be
equated both sides for the violence and

71
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,410
hatred in Charlotte so but obviously
let's remove the idea that there's any

72
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,370
moral equivalence is there any
legitimacy to the argument that the

73
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,800
violent tactics of groups like an tyfa
make matters worse and that democrats

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,370
and progressives need to condemn them
you know anyone that's committing a

75
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,479
violence
ought to be condemned anyone there's no

76
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,520
justification for it whatsoever but I do
think that that cannot be allowed to

77
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,169
obscure the fact that millions of people
are gathering around the country and

78
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,070
have since this president was
inaugurated in the most peaceful form of

79
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,509
protests and we can't allow the
commander-in-chief to somehow equate the

80
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:45,460
handful of people that would make those
protests violent with any kind of

81
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,180
sentiment that condones white supremacy
or neo Nazism and I think it all gets

82
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,830
back to the point you made earlier Jake
and I think it the fundamental problem

83
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,849
here is that the President of the United
States can't bring himself to repudiate

84
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:08,650
a part of his support and that is that
small group of bigots that are

85
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,969
supporters of his he's taken a pigeon
essentially that if you're with me you

86
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:17,530
can do no wrong and I won't condemn you
practically anything what that you do

87
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,229
his difficulty during the campaign in
your interview to condemn David Duke is

88
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,729
not at all unlike the difficulty he said
this week in an full-throated

89
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:33,940
unequivocal repudiation of sentiment and
ideology that we not only find repugnant

90
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,310
but we fought a world war over so I
think that's the root of the problem

91
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,500
congressman
Schiff democratic California thank you

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:00:00,000
so much good to see as always sir Thank
You Jake
