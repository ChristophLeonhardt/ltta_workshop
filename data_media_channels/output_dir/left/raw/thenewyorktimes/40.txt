1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,194
President Trump wants Special
Counsel Robert Mueller fired.

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,860
“The entire thing has
been a witch hunt.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,260
These people have the
biggest conflicts of interest

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,070
I’ve ever seen.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,670
I wanted to stay out.

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,970
But at some point, if it
doesn’t straighten out

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,830
properly, I will get involved.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,200
And I’ll get in
there if I have to.”

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,480
But the man who’s
overseeing Mueller’s probe

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,830
says that’s not likely.

11
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,651
“If there were not good cause,
it wouldn’t matter to me

12
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:22,565
what anybody says.”

13
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,740
The Times has reported that
Rosenstein discussed ways

14
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,490
to remove Trump from office.

15
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,790
Now they’re in a
face-off — the president,

16
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,000
who demands loyalty, and
Rosenstein, the subordinate,

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,060
whose job requires
independence.

18
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,430
“Are you afraid of
President Trump firing you?”

19
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,810
“No, I am not, Congressman.”

20
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,520
So how does
Rosenstein defend one

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,100
of his boss's biggest targets?

22
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,820
“If President
Trump ordered you

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,440
to fire the special
counsel, what would you do?”

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,390
“Senator, I’m not going
to follow any orders

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,490
unless I believe those
are lawful and appropriate

26
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,270
orders.

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,430
Under the regulation,
Special Counsel Mueller

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,440
may be fired only
for good cause.

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,640
And I am required to put
that cause in writing.”

30
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,670
“And Director Mueller
is going to have

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,211
a full degree of
independence that he

32
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,890
needs to conduct that
investigation appropriately.”

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,535
“Yeah, there have
been people who

34
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:19,170
have been making threats,
privately and publicly,

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,764
against me.

36
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,180
And I think they
should understand

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,864
by now the
Department of Justice

38
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,030
is not going to be extorted.

39
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,590
We’re going to do what’s
required by the rule of law.

40
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,330
And any kind of threats
that anybody makes

41
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,359
are not going to affect
the way we do our job.

42
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,400
We have a responsibility.

43
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,233
And we take an oath.

44
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,670
That’s the whole point.”

45
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:39,750
“If it were appropriate
for me to recuse,

46
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,537
I’d be more than
happy to do so and let

47
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,620
somebody else handle this.

48
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,309
But it’s my
responsibility to do it.”

49
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,100
But when it comes down
to it, the president

50
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,800
could have the last
word, firing Rosenstein

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,625
and appointing someone else,
who will then fire Mueller.

52
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,040
“And many people have
said you should fire him.

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:00:00,000
Again, they’ve found nothing.”
