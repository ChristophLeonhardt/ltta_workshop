MANY CONSERVATIVES AFTER HE WAS 
INSTALLED. 
>> WELL, HE FRUSTRATED 
CONSERVATIVES. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS THE THIRD 
NOMINEE TO FILL THE SEAT BACK 
WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED IN 1987 
BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO NOMINEES, 
ROBERT BORKE WAS VOTED DOWN IN 
THE SENATE AND DANIEL GINSBURG 
HAD TO WITHDRAW HIS NOMINATION. 
SO IN SOME WAYS HE WAS SEEN AS 
A CONSENSUS PICK. 
HE WAS CONFIRMED IN 1988. 
AND THEN HE GOT ON THE COURT 
AND HE BEGAN ISSUING A NUMBER 
OF CONSERVATIVE DECISIONS. 
HE WAS CONSERVATIVE THIS TERM, 
BY THE WAY. 
HE DID WRITE THAT I AM 
PASSIONED DISSENT IN THE 
OBAMACARE CASE WHEN THE COURT 
VOTE TODAY UPHOLD PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT. 
THE MESSAGE HERE AND THE TAKE 
AWAY IS HE IS CONSIDERED A 
SWING VOTE. 
HE WAS THE KEY VOTE IN REFUSING 
TO OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE. 
HE WAS WITH LIBERALS ON A 
NUMBER OF SOCIAL ISSUES. 
IF NOT VOTING WITH LIBERALS ON 
THE SOCIAL ISSUES, HE WOULD 
SORT OF CONSTRAIN THE BOLDER 
CONSERVATIVES ON THE COURT. 
THEY MAY BE WILLING TO GO 
FURTHER. 
LET'S END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS THERE 
PULLING THEM BACK A LITTLE BIT. 
THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING HIM, 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE SPECULATED 
THAT HE WOULD NEVER SAY NEVER 
ON SOME OF THOSE SOCIAL ISSUES. 
NOW WE WILL -- WE MAY WELL HAVE 
A NOMINEE THAT IS WILLING TO BE 
A LITTLE MORE BOLD. 
>> SO, JEN, THE SCALIA SEAT WAS 
OPEN FOR 14 MONTHS. 
HOW LONG WOULD YOU EXPECT THIS 
SEAT TO REMAIN VACANT FOR? 
>> NOT THAT LONG. 
I WOULD EXPECT YOU WILL SEE A 
NEW JUSTICE NOMINATED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONFIRMED 
BY THE SENATE OVER THE SUMMER 
AND IN PLACE TO HEAR ARGUMENTS 
WHEN THE JUSTICES RETURN FROM 
THEIR RECESS THE FIRST MONDAY 
IN OCTOBER. 
AND THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE 
DEMOCRATS CAN DO ABOUT IT. 
>> OKAY. 
JEN CRAWFORD FROM D.C. WE WILL 
SEE YOU TONIGHT ON THE CBS 
EVENING NEWS. 
SO MUCH TO DISCUSS WITH THE 
SEISMIC NEWS FROM THE SUPREME 
COURT THIS AFTERNOON. 
THE RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE 
KENNEDY. 
LONG, LONG A SWING VOTE. 
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THIS 
ON YOUR LOCAL NEWS. 
ALSO ON OUR STREAMING NETWORK 
CBSN AND ON THE CBS EVENING 
NEWS. 
THE NEWS FROM THE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE KENNEDY IS RETIRING. 
CBS NEWS IN NEW YORK. 
YORK.
>> FOR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, GO 
TO CBSNEWS.COM. 
>>> SHE IS A CONTRIBUTING 
EDITOR AT NEWS WEEK AND A 
SENIOR EDITOR AT SLATE. 
DALIA, WHAT IS YOUR 
INTERPRETATION OF THIS NEWS? 
ARE YOU SURPRISED? 
THERE WERE RUMORS THAT THE 
JUSTICE MIGHT RETIRE. 
>> YEAH. 
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A 
SURPRISE. 
I THINK WE KNEW HE WANT TODAY 
GO A YEAR AGO -- HE WANTED TO 
GO A YEAR AGO. 
WE WERE RAMPED UP, READY FOR 
THAT. 
THERE WERE A FEW ISSUES THAT HE 
WANT TODAY RESOLVE THAT HE HAD 
BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR 
DECADES. 
HE HUNG OUT TO RESOLVE THEM. 
IT IS NOT A SURPRISE AT ALL. 
HE IS 81. 
IT IS FAIRLY CLEAR FROM HIS 
DECISION THAT THE END OF THIS 
TERM JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS THAT HE'S DONE WHAT HE 
NEEDS TO DO AND HE IS READY TO 
GO. 
SO I THINK IN SOME SENSE THE 
SURPRISE WAS THAT HE STAYED A 
YEAR BEYOND WHEN HE TOLD US HE 
PRETTY MUCH WANTED TO GO. 
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WERE THOSE 
UNRESOLVED ISSUES THAT HE 
WANTED TO ADDRESS BEFORE 
RETIRING? 
>> INTERESTINGLY THE BIG ONE 
WAS GERRYMANDERING. 
HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR DECADES 
TO FIND WHAT HE CALLED A 
STANDARD FOR WHAT WOULD BE AN 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL PARTISAN 
GERRYMANDER. 
AND INTERESTING IN THE GILL 
CASE HE DECIDED NOT TO DECIDE. 
HE HAD TWO VEHICLES THIS TERM 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT. 
THE COURT KICKED THOSE AWAY. 
AND SO IF THAT'S THE THING THAT 
HE WANTED TO GET SORTED AFTER 
DECADES OF WAITING AND SEEING, 
WAITING FOR THE PERFECT 
VEHICLE, HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET 
THAT DONE. 
I ALSO THINK HE PROBABLY WANT 
TODAY STAY ON -- WANTED TO TRY 
TO STAY ON A YEAR TO RESOLVE 
THE TRAVEL BAN THAT CAME DOWN 
YESTERDAY AND HE WAS THE FIFTH 
CRITICAL VOTE TO UPHOLD THE 
TRAVEL BAN. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO HOLD YOU 
RIGHT THERE. 
IF YOU COULD STAND BY FOR US. 
WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN JAN 
CRAWFORD JOINING US FROM 
WASHINGTON. 
NOT ENTIRELY A SURPRISE. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 
FUTURE OF THE COURT, GIVEN THE 
FACT THAT HE WAS SUCH A 
CRITICAL SWING VOTE. 
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO 
OVERSTATE THE IDEA THAT KENNEDY 
WAS SOME MODERATE CONSERVATIVE, 
YOU KNOW, WHO WAS KIND OF -- WE 
NEVER KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO 
DO. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE WAS A 
CONSERVATIVE. 
BUT HE HAD THAT LIBERTARIAN 
STREAK. 
SO HE MADE A NUMBER OF KEY 
RULINGS ON SOME OF THE SOCIAL 
ISSUES, SIDING WITH LIBERALS. 
SO AS A RESULT, YOU SAW HIM 
VOTING AS HE DID ON ABORTION 
AND GAY RIGHTS AND HE WOULD 
RESTRAIN SOME OF THE BOLDER 
CONSERVATIVES. 
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO 
GET A NOMINEE WHO IS LIKE THAT. 
I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
GOING TO PUT ON A STRONG 
CONSERVATIVE, SOMEONE WHO IS IN 
THE MOLD OF A JUSTICE SCALIA OR 
NOW A JUSTICE THOMAS. 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS GOING TO BE 
LOOKING FOR. 
THOSE ARE ALL OF THE NOMINEES 
ALREADY WE BELIEVE WHO ARE ON 
THE SHORT LIST THAT. 
WILL CHANGE THE SUPREME COURT. 
IT WILL MOVE THE COURT MORE 
SOLIDLY TO THE RIGHT FOR A 
GENERATION. 
>> HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY DO 
YOU THINK A JUSTICE WILL BE 
CONFIRMED, A NOMINEE WILL BE 
CONFIRMED, ESPECIALLY GIVEN 
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME WHEN -- 
WHEN SENATE DEMOCRATS TRIED TO 
BLOCK GORSUCH. 
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY EASY 
TO GET A NOMINEE CONFIRMED AND 
IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY. 
THERE IS NOTHING THAT DEMOCRATS 
CAN DO IT. 
THEY MADE THE DECISION TO 
FILIBUSTER NEIL GORSUCH WHO WAS 
REPLACING SCALIA ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
THAT ENABLED MITCH MCCONNELL, 
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, TO 
KIND OF BLOW UP THE FILIBUSTER 
WITH REPUBLICANS ON BOARD, EVEN 
MODERATE REPUBLICANS ON BOARD. 
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN AS EASY TO BLOW UP THE 
FILIBUSTER FOR THIS NOMINEE. 
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS THIS 
NOMINATION IS GOING TO TURN ON 
THE -- KIND OF THE HANDS OF THE 
MODERATE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE 
IN THE SENATE F IT IS OKAY WITH 
SUZANNE COLINS, THAT IS WHO THE 
NOMINEE IS GOING TO BE. 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE RESTRAINING 
VOICES FOR THIS NOMINATION, NOT 
THE DEMOCRATS. 
>> DO YOU EXPECT THIS 
CONFIRMATION TO HAPPEN BEFORE 
THE MID TERMS, BEFORE -- 
>> YES. 
>> MORE DEMOCRATS MAY COME IN? 
>> YES. 
ABSOLUTELY. 
WE CAN SAY THAT WITH CERTAINTY. 
AND I DO BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE 
A NEW JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT FOR THE FIRST MONDAY IN 
OCTOBER. 
>> JAN CRAWFORD, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
MAJOR GARRETT JOINS US NOW FROM 
THE NORTH LAWN OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
MAJOR, THE PRESIDENT WILL NOW 
HAVE A CHANCE TO NOMINATE A 
SECOND JUSTICE TO THE COURT. 
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS, 
ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED 
DURING THE GORSUCH NOMINATION? 
>> WELL, IT IS ENORMOUSLY 
SIGNIFICANT. 
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
POWER THAT'S ANY PRESIDENT 
POSSESSES. 
WITH NEIL GORSUCH, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP INDICATED THAT HE WOULD 
LOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE 
JURORRISTS IN THE MOLD OF 
SCALIA. 
BE THAT PERSON A MAN OR A 
WOMAN. 
AND AS JAN ACCURATELY 
SUMMARIZED JUST A SECOND AGO, 
THAT NOMINEE IS LIKELY TO 
RECEIVE A VERY FAVORABLE 
EMBRACE BY THE SENATE 
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND THE 
SENATE REPUBLICAN RANK AND 
FILE. 
THOSE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 
WILL BE SCHEDULED RAPIDLY. 
THEY WILL BE CONDUCTED AND A 
VOTE WILL BE HELD IN THE MID 
TERM ELECTION ATMOSPHERE. 
THAT WILL HAVE TWO 
CONSEQUENCES. 
BOTH OF THEM POLITICAL. 
WE WILL GET TO THE LEGAL 
CONSEQUENCES IN A SECOND. 
BUT THE POLITICS OF THIS IS 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. 
THE SECOND TRUMP NOMINEE TO THE 
HIGH COURT WILL BE A 
GALVANIZING CALL TO REPUBLICANS 
TO SUPPORT REPUBLICANS ON THE 
BALLOT IN SENATE AND HOUSE 
RACES IN THE MID TERMS. 
THIS IS IN ESSENCE FROM JUSTICE 
KENNEDY A POLITICAL GIFT TO THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
BECAUSE ONE ISSUE HAS BEEN A 
GALVANIZING AND MOTIVATING 
COMPONENT FOR BASE REPUBLICANS 
THROUGHOUT. 
AND IT HAS BEEN THE FUTURE OF 
THE SUPREME COURT, THE FUTURE 
OF THE FEDERAL BENCH GENERALLY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP REFERS TO IT 
REPEATEDLY. 
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF 
HIS VICTORY IN 2016. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLING 
DATA ABOUT HOW MANY TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS IDENTIFIED THE 
SUPREME COURT AS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT OR AMONG THE MOST 
IMPORTANT ISSUES, THOSE NUMBERS 
DEPENDING ON THE STATE RANGED 
FROM 20 TO 25 IN SOME CASES 
30%. 
IT WAS A BIG MOTIVATING FACTOR 
THEN. 
IT WILL BE IN 2018. 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
POLITICAL AISLE, WE HAVE KIND 
OF A CONSTELLATION OF LEGAL 
ISSUES LATELY THAT HAVE GRABBED 
THE ATTENTION OF DEMOCRATS AND 
THE FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT 
WILL MOTIVATE THEM EVEN MORE. 
THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS 
PRESSURE ON DEMOCRATS TO DO 
WHAT THEY CAN TO RESIST AND 
THEY WILL PROBABLY FAIL IN THAT 
RESISTANCE T WILL BE USED IN 
THE MID TERMS FOR VOTERS LOOK 
AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE 
LEGAL CONSTRUCT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. 
YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE DEMOCRAT IF 
YOU WANT TO SLOW THAT DOWN AND 
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK MORE 
HOLISTICALLY, IF YOU WILL, 
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE FEDERAL 
BENCH IN NOT JUST MID TERM 
ELECTIONS IN 2018 BUT FOR THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2020. 
SO ONE THING THAT JAN KNOWS ALL 
TOO WELL IS THAT THE COURT 
ITSELF AND ITS FUTURE IS NO 
LONGER LIMITED TO DEBATES ABOUT 
LEGALISMS, PRECEDENT AND ALL OF 
THOSE SORTS OF OTHER LEGAL 
TERMS. 
IT IS ALSO ABOUT POLITICS. 
MOTIVATIONAL POLITICS, BASE 
POLITICS ON BOTH SIDES. 
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY'S ANNOUNCED 
RETIREMENT WILL BE A 
GALVANIZING FORCE FOR 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN 
THE MID TERM ELECTIONS. 
>> HOW MUCH WILL THIS VALIDATE 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF? 
WE SAW YESTERDAY WHEN THE 
SUPREME COURT SIDED WITH THE 
PRESIDENT ON THE TRAVEL BAN. 
THAT REALLY PUMPED THE 
PRESIDENT UP IN TERMS OF HIS -- 
HIS BELIEF THAT HE WAS RIGHT 
ALL ALONG. 
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER JUSTICE THAT 
WAS NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT 
ON THE BENCH WHO MAY SIDE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE EACH 
JUSTICE LOOKS AT THE LEGAL 
CONSTRAINTS ON EACH DECISION. 
BUT IF WE SEE ANOTHER NOMINEE, 
ANOTHER JUSTICE ON THE BENCH 
THAT WAS NOMINATED BY THE 
PRESIDENT, HOW WILL THAT AFFECT 
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND HIS 
-- HIS FEELING OF HIS -- 
FEELING BEHIND HIS OWN 
DECISIONS? 
>> WELL, THE TRAVEL BAN, IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER, WAS 
OKAYED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN 
ITS THIRD VARIATION. 
I DON'T THINK IT IS CLEAR BASED 
ON READING THE COURT'S 
DECISION, EVEN BY THAT NARROW 5-
4 MAJORITY OPINION, THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN AN ENDORSEMENT FROM 
THE SUPREME COURT'S POINT OF 
VIEW CONSTITUTIONALLY OF EITHER 
TRAVEL BAN 2 OR TRAVEL BAN 1. 
SO THE PRESIDENT HAD TO 
SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER HIS 
ORIENTATION TO THAT ISSUE TO 
WIN SUPREME COURT APPROVAL. 
THAT IS OF COURSE WHY THEY DID 
IT. 
SO THAT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING 
WORTH UNDERSCORING IN THE 
TRAVEL BAN CASE. 
YES, IT WAS VINDICATION BUT IT 
CAME AFTER THE THIRD VARIATION, 
TRYING TO INTERPRET WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANT TODAY 
ACCOMPLISH. 
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT'S POINT OF 
VIEW ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT IS 
VERY MUCH CONSISTENT WITH THAT 
OF JUDICIAL CONSERVATIVES WHO 
WANT JURISTS ON THE FEDERAL 
BENCH, AT THE DISTRICT COURT 
LEVEL, THE APPEAL AT COURT 
LEVEL AND THE SUPREME COURT 
THAT HAVE A NARROW 
INTERPRETATION OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION. 
THEY WANT THINGS CONSISTENT 
WITH PRECEDENT BUT THEY'RE NOT 
INTERESTED NEXT PANNING THE 
REACH OR DEFINITIONS OF WHAT IS 
LEGAL UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 
INTRODUCING NEW PROTECTED 
CLASSES OR NEW PROTECTED 
BEHAVIORS. 
THEY WANT TO BE VERY 
CONSTRAINED. 
AND AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE AS 
THEY WOULD ARGUE IT TO THE 
ORIGINAL -- WHAT THEY CALL THE 
ORIGIN TENT OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
FRAMEWORK. 
HE HAS, IF YOU WILL, 
SUBCONTRACTED MOST OF THAT WORK 
TO SOMETHING CALLED THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY WHICH HAS 
BEEN IN WASHINGTON FOR MORE 
THAN 30 YEARS. 
JAN IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT, 
AS ARE THE LEGAL EXPERTS IN 
WASHINGTON. 
THEY HAVE THIS VIEW, THEY HAVE 
SPENT 30 YEARS QUIETLY 
CONSISTENTLY AT LAW SCHOOLS, ON 
FEDERAL BENCHES, ON STATE 
BENCHES TRYING TO RECRUIT THOSE 
WHO HAVE A LIKE MINDED APPROACH 
TO THE LAW AND THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
THIS ORGANIZATION, THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY, HAS NOW 
PROVIDED MANY, IF NOT MOST OF 
THE NAMES SUBMIT TODAY THIS 
WHITE HOUSE FOR NOMINATION 
EITHER TO LOWER FEDERAL COURT 
APPOINTMENTS AND NOMINATIONS OR 
TO THE HIGH COURT. 
AND THE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, HAS ESSENTIALLY INVESTED 
THIS GROUP ALMOST SOLELY WITH 
THE POWER TO JUDGE WHO IS AND 
WHO IS NOT SUITABLE FOR 
NOMINATION BY THIS WHITE HOUSE. 
IT IS NOT A DIRECT CONDUIT FROM 
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY TO THE 
FEDERAL BENCH, BUT IT IS A VERY 
INFLUENTIAL CONDUIT. 
AND THAT ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE 
A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE ON 
SHAPING THOSE ON THE SHORT LIST 
FOR THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY 
AND WHOEVER IT IS THE PRESIDENT 
ULTIMATELY NOMINATES. 
>> SPEAKING OF THAT SHORT LIST, 
THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST SAID 
WHILE APPEARING WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF PORTUGAL THAT HE 
WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE 
SEARCH FOR A NEW SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE. 
HE SAID THAT PERSON WILL COME 
FROM THE PREVIOUSLY RELEASED 
LIST OF 25 CANDIDATES. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS LIST 
AND WHO IS ON IT, MAJOR? 
>> WELL, YOU CAN EASILY FIND T 
I CAN'T GIVE YOU ALL 25 NAMES. 
IT IS EASILY LOCATEABLE. 
JUST GOOGLE IT. 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE 
LIST IS THAT IT IS THE THIRD 
VARIATION OF A LIST THAT 
CANDIDATE TRUMP PROPOUNDED 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 
AND IT WAS A NOVELTY. 
IT WAS BRAND-NEW FOR SOMEONE TO 
SAY I'M DEVELOPING A LIST FOR 
SUPREME COURT. 
AS THE SECOND LIST CAME OUT, 
THAT CANDIDATE, DONALD TRUMP, 
UNLIKE ANYONE FOR EITHER PARTY 
SAID THAT'S THE LIST. 
I WILL PICO OWE IF I'M ELECTED, 
I WILL PICK FROM THAT LIST AND 
I WILL INTRODUCE NOBODY ELSE. 
SO YOU CAN APPRAISE ME AS A 
POTENTIAL PRESIDENT AND THE 
SUPREME COURT BASED ON THIS 
LIST I'M GIVING YOU TO 
EVALUATE. 
THAT WAS A SIGNAL DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN FROM DONALD TRUMP TO 
JUDICIAL CONSERVATIVES AND ALL 
REPUBLICAN MINDED VOTERS WHO 
CARED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE 
SUPREME COURT, HERE IS MY LIST. 
I'M TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. 
I VETTED THIS LIST. 
YOU CAN VET THE LIST. 
AND IF YOU LIKE IT, MAYBE YOU 
WILL SUPPORT ME. 
IT WAS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH 
TO COMBINING POLITICS AND THE 
FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT. 
AND IT WORKED. 
AND FROM THAT LIST, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DEVELOPED 
CREDIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE WITH 
THE BASE REPUBLICAN VOTERS. 
THAT LIST IS A REINFORCING 
MECHANISM IN HIS CONVERSATION 
WITH HIM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF 
THE COURT. 
LIKE I SAID, YOU CAN FIND ALL 
25 NAMES ONLINE THAT. 
IS EASY TO DO. 
THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS 
THIS LIST IS REAL. 
IT HAS BEEN THE WELL SPRING 
FROM WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAS 
CHOSEN NOT JUST NEIL GORSUCH 
BUT OTHERS TO THE HIGH POSITION 
ON THE FEDERAL BENCH. 
IT IS PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT 
THEN CANDIDATE CREATED AS A 
UNIQUE CONVERSATION ON THIS 
TOPIC AND A REAL TIME POLITICAL 
CONTEXT. 
HE DESERVES YOU ARE LOOKING IN 
THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN 
POLITICS CREDIT FOR INNOVATION. 
NOBODY HAD EVER DONE THAT 
BEFORE. 
I HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS WHO CAN'T IMAGINE A 
SCENARIO AFTER DONALD TRUMP HAS 
LEFT THE POLITICAL STAGE IN 
AMERICA IN WHICH A REPUBLICAN 
WILL NOT DO A SIMILAR THING, 
HAVE A SUPREME COURT LIST AND 
SAY I VETTED IT. 
NOW YOU CAN VET THAT LIST. 
AND IN THE PROCESS VET ME AS A 
WAY OF DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT 
I'M WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT. 
IN THIS ONE RESPECT, ON THE 
POLITICS OF THE LAW AND THE 
POLITICS OF THE JUDICIARY, 
DONALD TRUMP WAS INNOVATIVE AND 
IT WORKED FOR HIM. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAJOR 
GARRETT. 
WE JUST SHOWED THAT LIST OF 
OTHER POTENTIAL NOMINEES. 
AND WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM 
THE PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING 
REMARKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
WHILE HE MEETS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF PORTUGAL. 
LET'S BRING BACK ILIA SHAPIRO. 
HE IS A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE 
KATO INSTITUTE. 
>> HOW CRITICAL IS THIS TIMING, 
ESPECIALLY AHEAD OF THE MID 
TERMS. 
>> WELL, YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON 
IT. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A 
CALCULATION THIS WAS FOR 
KENNEDY BUT CERTAINLY GIVEN THE 
CHANCE DEMOCRATS COULD TAKE THE 
SENATE IN NOVEMBER, THIS ALLOWS 
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE 
SENATE TO FILL THAT SEAT. 
AND SO THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT 
THAN HAD HE WAITED ANOTHER 
YEAR. 
BECAUSE I THINK GIVEN THE 
GORSUCH PRECEDENT, I DON'T 
THINK WE WILL EVER SEE A 
JUSTICE CONFIRMED TO A SEAT BY 
A SENATE OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
CERTAINLY NOT THE LAST YEAR 
BEFORE ELECTION AND PROBABLY 
EVEN LONGER THAN THAT. 
SO THE TIMING IS AWES PISHES. 
AND MITCH MCCONNELL ESPECIALLY 
THE LAST WEEK OR TWO HAS BEEN 
GIVING A LOT OF INTERVIEWS 
TALKING ABOUT HOW JUDGES IS THE 
BIGGEST PART OF HIS LEGACY. 
I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY 
RIGHT. 
AND HERE HE GETS A CHANCE TO 
GUILD THAT LILY. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD GO 
DOWN AS VERY INFLUENTIAL, NOT 
FOR ANYTHING THAT HE MAKES NEWS 
FOR, TWEETS ABOUT BUT SIMPLY 
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPOINT 
WELL NOW A SECOND JUSTICE AND A 
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE LOWER 
COURTS. 
AND THAT IS FOR LIFE. 
THAT IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER 
HE LOSES THE WHITE HOUSE NOW IN 
TWO YEARS, SIX YEARS OR 
ANYTHING ELSE. 
>> WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING 
EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
THE LETTER THAT THE JUSTICE 
GAVE TO THE PRESIDENT 
ANNOUNCING HIS RETIREMENT. 
THE DECISION IS EFFECTIVE JULY 
31st THIS YEAR. 
THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT HE WILL 
WAIT UNTIL THERE IS A 
REPLACEMENT IN PLACE. 
HOW TYPICAL IS THIS FOR HIM NOT 
TO EXTEND HIS RETIREMENT, 
REALLY MAKE IT DEFINITIVE? 
>> IT IS DEPENDENT. 
DIFFERENT JUSTICES HAVE DONE IT 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS. 
JUSTICE O'CONNOR ANNOUNCED SHE 
WOULD LEAVE WHEN HER SUCCESSOR 
WAS CONFIRMED. 
THAT ALLOWED A SEAMLESS 
TRANSITION TO JUSTICE ELIDO IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THAT PARTICULAR 
TERM. 
OTHER JUSTICES HAVE SAID 
IMMEDIATELY I THINK WHEN 
MARSHALL ANNOUNCED HIS 
RETIREMENT, HE WAS ALLOWED TO 
ANNOUNCE IT IN OPEN COURT THE 
LAST DAY OF THE TERM, WHICH 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS MORNING 
WHEN THEY WERE ANNOUNCING THEIR 
OPINION, ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS 
RETIRING IMMEDIATELY. 
HERE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN THE 
TWO OPTIONS SAYING I'LL GIVE IT 
A MONTH. 
BUT THAT REALLY GIVEN THAT IT 
IS THE SUMMER, IT IS NO 
DIFFERENT THAN IF HE WOULD HAVE 
ANNOUNCED HE WAS RETIRING 
IMMEDIATELY. 
THE DIFFERENT JUSTICES DO IT IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS. 
BUT THIS GIVES THE WHOLE SUMMER 
AND THE COURT IS NOT DUE TO 
PICK UP AGAIN UNTIL EARLY 
OCTOBER. 
GIVES ALL OF THAT TIME FOR -- 
TO PICK A NOMINEE, TO HOLD 
HEARINGS AND HAVE A 
CONFIRMATION VOTE. 
SO THERE IS TIME TO HAVE THE 
NORMAL KIND OF PROCESS THAT WE 
DID NOT OBVIOUSLY SEE AFTER 
JUSTICE SCALIA'S DEATH. 
>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT 
THIS SEAT WILL BE VACANT LIKE 
IT WAS AFTER SCALIA DIED OR IS 
THAT CHANCE GONE NOW THAT THE 
FILIBUSTER MECHANISM HAS BEEN 
DISMANDED. 
>> IT DEPENDS ON PURE CHANCE 
AND NUMBERS. 
WHOEVER PRESIDENT TRUMP PICKS, 
HE WILL FIRST RUN IT BY THE 
MOST MODERATE MEMBERS OF THE 
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. 
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE. 
JOHN MCCAIN'S HEALTH. 
WOULD HE BE ABLE TO MAKE IT 
BACK. 
OR WILL -- YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT 
INCONCEIVABLE THAT MIKE PENCE 
MAY HAVE TO BREAK A TIE VOTE. 
ASSUMING THAT THOSE MORE 
MODERATE SWING, IF YOU WILL, 
REPUBLICAN SENATE VOTES ARE ON 
BOARD, THEN GIVEN THE NO 
FILIBUSTER, THIS IS -- SHOULD 
BE SMOOTH SAILING. 
AND HOW DO YOU THINK HIS 
DEPARTURE WILL IMPACT CHIEF 
JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS. 
>> WELL, ROBERTS WILL GAIN IN 
POWER. 
THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS OF COURSE 
ONLY ONE OF THE NINE VOTES. 
HE DOESN'T GET MORE VOTES THAN 
THAT. 
HE DOES HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT 
POWER WHEN HE'S IN THE 
MAJORITY. 
HE CAN PICK WHO GETS TO WRITE 
THE OPINIONS AND THERE ARE 
ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS. 
NOW HE WILL BECOME THE VERY 
MIDDLE OF THE COURT. 
MEANING FOUR JUSTICES WILL BE 
TO HIS LEFT. 
FOUR WILL BE TO HIS RIGHT. 
IDEOLOGICALLY NOT JUST 
LOGISTICALLY HOW THE COURT 
SITS. 
IF SOME PEOPLE HAD BEEN CALLING 
THE COURT THE KENNEDY COURT 
BECAUSE THE RETIRING JUSTICE 
KENNEDY HAS BEEN THE SWING VOTE 
ON SO MANY ISSUES, NOW THE 
ROBERTS COURT NAMED AFTER THE 
CHIEF JUSTICE WILL ALSO BE THE 
ROBERTS COURT IN TERMS OF WHO 
HAS THE POSITION OF POWER. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> JUST TO RECAP WHAT WE HAVE 
BEEN LEARNING OF COURSE JUSTICE 
ANTHONY KENNEDY HAS ANNOUNCED 
HIS RETIREMENT. 
THIS IS THE LETTER THAT HE SENT 
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THAT 
HIS -- BEFORE WE DO THAT, LET'S 
LISTEN IN TO MITCH MCCONNELL 
WHO IS MAKING REMARKS. 
I SUGGEST THE ABSENCE OF A
QUORUM.
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE CLERK
WILL CALL THE ROLL.
>> MR. ALEXANDER. 
>> THIS ALL HAPPENS THE DAY 
THAT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA -- 
I'M SORRY, JUSTICE ANTHONY 
KENNEDY ANNOUNCES HIS 
RETIREMENT. 
THIS IS A LETTER THAT HE GAVE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP EFFECTIVE 
IMMEDIATELY JULY 31st, HE IS 
RETIRING. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN 
RUMORED. 
BUT THE TIMING IS VERY 
INTERESTING. 
LET'S BRING IN A CONTRIBUTING 
EDITOR AT NEWS WEEK AND A 
SENIOR EDITOR AT SLATE. 
DALIA, HOW KEY WAS HIS VOTE? 
HE WAS CONSIDERED THE JUSTICE 
MOST LIKELY TO BE A SWING VOTE. 
>> YES. 
HE WAS WITHOUT DOUBT TO THE 
EXTENT THAT ANYBODY SWUNG, IT 
WAS HIM. 
HE KIND OF INHERITED THAT 
MANTLE FROM O'CONNOR. 
HISTORICALLY SHE HAD BEEN THE 
FIFTH DECIDING VOTE ONE WAY OR 
THE OTHER. 
WHEN SHE RETIRED, HE WAS 
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE PERSON ON 
THE COURT MOST LIKELY TO MAKE 
UP THE 5-4 IN ONE DIRECTION OR 
ANOTHER. 
I THINK JAN CRAWFORD MADE THE 
POINT AND I THINK IT IS RIGHT 
THAT DIDN'T MAKE HIM A 
CENTRALIST. 
IT MADE HIM A CONSERVATIVE 
JUSTICE WHO ON OCCASION, 
PARTICULARLY ON AREAS THAT WERE 
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIM, GAY 
RIGHTS, WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE 
RIGHTS, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, 
WOULD SOMETIMES ALIGN HIMSELF 
WITH THE FOUR JUSTICES ON THE 
LEFT. 
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DON'T 
HAVE THAT PERSON AFTER  JULY 
31st, I THINK THAT IS ACCURATE. 
IT IS A BIG, BIG SEAT TO FILL. 
>> NOW, HE WAS NOMINATED BY A 
CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT. 
IS THIS A BLOW TO DEMOCRATS? 
>> WELL,I THINK IT IS A 
TREMENDOUS BLOW TO DEMOCRATS, 
BOTH INSOFAR AS HE WILL WITHOUT 
A DOUBT BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE 
FAR TO HIS RIGHT. 
SOMEONE MUCH MORE LIKE NEIL 
GORSUCH THAN LIKE JOHN ROBERTS. 
SO I THINK IT IS A BLOW IN THAT 
SENSE. 
I THINK IT IS ALSO A BLOW IN 
THAT THERE'S A LEGACY HERE. 
THERE'S AN ENORMOUS LEGACY IN 
WHICH ANTHONY KENNEDY HELD THE 
COURT IN CHECK. 
IN TERMS OF OVERRULING ROE V. 
WADE. 
IN TERMS OF NOT ALLOWING 
MARRIAGE EQUALITY. 
THERE WAS AN AREA AFTER AREA 
THAT HE WAS THE DECISIVE VOTE. 
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS 
OVERSTATEMENT TO SUGGEST THAT 
ALL OF THOSE AREAS OF THE LAW 
IN WHICH HE WAS THE DECISIVE 
FIFTH VOTE ARE NOW GOING TO BE 
UP FOR GRABS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
WE WANT IT TAKE YOU NOW TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE WHERE MOMENTS AGO 
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE 
RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE KENNEDY. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> I HAVE RESPECTED FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
HE'S BEEN A GREAT JUSTICE OF 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
HE -- HE IS A MAN WHO IS 
DISPLAYED GREAT VISION, 
TREMENDOUS VISION AND 
TREMENDOUS HEART. 
AND HE WILL BE MISSED. 
BUT HE WILL BE RETIRING. 
AND WE WILL BEGIN OUR SEARCH 
FOR A NEW JUSTICE OF THE UNITED 
STATES SUPREME COURT. 
THAT WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. 
AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO 
PICK SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE AS 
OUTSTANDING. 
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK JUSTICE 
KENNEDY FOR THE YEARS OF 
TREMENDOUS SERVICE. 
HE'S A VERY SPECTACULAR MAN. 
HE REALLY IS A SPECTACULAR MAN. 
AND I KNOW THAT HE WILL BE 
AROUND HOPEFULLY FOR A LONG 
TIME TO ADVISE AND I BELIEVE 
HE'S GOING TO BE TEACHING AND 
DOING OTHER THINGS. 
SO THANK YOU SO JUSTICE 
KENNEDY. 
OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, EVERYONE. 
>> WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY NUMEROUS 
PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE A LIST OF 25 PEOPLE 
THAT I ACTUALLY HAD DURING MY 
ELECTION. 
I HAD 20 AND THEN I ADDED FIVE 
A LITTLE WHILE AGO. 
WE HAVE A VERY EXCELLENT LIST 
OF GREAT TALENTED HIGHLY 
EDUCATED, HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, 
HOPEFULLY TREMENDOUS PEOPLE. 
I THINK THE LIST IS VERY 
OUTSTANDING. 
WHEN I WAS RUNNING, I PUT DOWN 
A LIST OF 20 PEOPLE. 
BECAUSE NOT BEING A POLITICIAN, 
I THINK PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR 
WHAT SOME OF MY CHOICES MAY BE. 
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE. 
AND I THINK YOU SEE THE KIND OF 
QUALITY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT LIST. 
BUT I DID ADD -- I ADDED FIVE 
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO THE LIST. 
SO IT WILL BE SOMEBODY FROM 
THAT LIST. 
SO WE HAVE NOW BOILED IT DOWN 
TO ABOUT 25 PEOPLE. 
>> NO. 
I WILL TELL YOU WE FOUGHT VERY 
HARD TO GET IT HERE. 
I THINK THEY'RE DOING A 
FANTASTIC JOB WITH THE WORLD 
CUP RIGHT NOW. 
IT IS IN RUSSIA. 
AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS 
EXCITING. 
MY SON LOVES SOCCER AND HE 
LOVES WATCHING THE WORLD CUP. 
AND THEY HAVE REALLY DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB WITH THE WORLD 
CUP. 
IT IS EXCITING. 
EVEN IF YOU'RE A NON-SOCCER 
FAN. 
I'M A SOCCER FAN A LITTLE BIT 
BUT I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. 
>> WHO ARE YOU ROOTING FOR. 
>> I'M ROOTING FOR EVERYBODY TO 
DO WELL. 
BUT I THINK THE VENUE HAS BEEN 
FANTASTIC. 
THEY REALLY HAVE SHOWN 
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. 
I FOUGHT VERY HARD TO GET IT 
FOR THE UNITED STATES, MEXICO 
AND CANADA. 
AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD. 
AND WE WERE HONORED TO BE 
CHOSEN. 
AND THIS IS A GREAT GENTLEMAN 
AND A GREAT SOCCER FAN TOO. 
BUT WE -- WE WERE VERY HONOR TO 
BE CHOSEN FOR THE WORLD CUP. 
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. 
>> MOST LIKELY. 
JOHN BOLTON IS OVER IN RUSSIA 
RIGHT NOW. 
I JUST SAW WATCHING MEDIA THAT 
HE'S -- HE'S MET WITH PRESIDENT 
PUTIN. 
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE FULL 
REPORT YET. 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE 
MEETING SOME TIME IN THE NOT 
TOO DISTANT FUTURE. 
I SAID IT FROM DAY ONE, GETTING 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA AND 
EVERYBODY IS A VERY GOOD THING. 
IT IS GOOD FOR THE WORLD, IT IS 
GOOD FOR US, IT IS GOOD FOR 
EVERYBODY. 
SO WE WILL PROBABLY BE MEETING 
SOMETIME AROUND MY TRIP TO 
EUROPE. 
>> WHERE. 
>> IT HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED 
YET. 
PROBABLY I WILL KNOW WITHIN AN 
HOUR. 
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE 
INJUNCTION ON IMMIGRATION. 
WILL YOU FIGHT THAT. 
THE JUDGE SAYS FAMILIED SHOULD 
BE REUNITED. 
>> WE BELIEVE FAMILIES SHOULD 
BE TOGETHER ALSO. 
THERE'S NOT A LOT TO FIGHT. 
WHAT WE REALLY DO IS WE BELIEVE 
IN VERY STRONG BORDERS. 
NO CRIME. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN 
OPEN BORDERS AND PLENTY OF 
CRIME. 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU GET 
WITH THE OPEN BORDERS. 
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE 
HOWEVER THE PRESIDENT OF 
PORTUGAL. 
AND I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, 
BUT IN OUR COUNTRY, THE 
SELECTION OF A JUSTICE OF THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS 
CONSIDERED I THINK WE CAN ALL 
SAY ONE OF THE -- ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS, ONE OF 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR 
OUR COUNTRY. 
I MEAN YOU SEE THE DECISION 
THAT'S JUST CAME DOWN, HOW BIG 
THEY ARE, HOW VITAL THEY ARE. 
AND THEY CAN SWING DIFFERENT 
WAYS DEPENDING ON WHO IT -- WHO 
THEY MIGHT BE IN THE COURTS. 
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
CONSIDERED A TREMENDOUS -- A 
TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT THINGS. 
SOME PEOPLE THINK OUTSIDE OF 
WAR AND PEACE OBVIOUSLY IT IS 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT 
YOU CAN HAVE. 
BUT ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT 
THING IS INTRODUCING THE 
PRESIDENT, THE HIGHLY 
RESPECTED, I MUST SAY, 
PRESIDENT OF PORTUGAL. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT. 
AS A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 
PROFESSOR, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT 
IT IS WHEN A JUSTICE IN YOUR 
SUPREME COURT RETIRES. 
BECAUSE IT IS A KEY 
INSTITUTION. 
SO I JUST HEARD THE NEWS. 
AND I IMAGINE HOW IMPORTANT IT 
IS FOR YOU AND FOR ANY IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 
ANYWAY, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL 
YOU THAT WE HAVE A VERY LONG 
LASTING FRIENDSHIP AND 
PARTNERSHIP. 
>> YES. 
>> THAT STARTED. 
WE R■ECOGNIZED YOU. 
WE WERE THE FIRST NEUTRAL 
COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. 
OUR OLDEST ALLY ENGLAND. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, 
BUT YOUR FOUNDING FATHERS 
CELEBRATED INDEPENDENCE WITH 
OUR WINE, WITH MADERA WINE. 
>> GOOD TASTE. 
>> LONG, LONG STARTED OUR 
FRIENDSHIP, PARTNERSHIPPED 
BASED ON COMMON VAL -- 
PARTNERSHIP, BASED ON COMMON 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 
FELLOW CITIZENS THAT ARE BOTH 
AMERICAN AND PORTUGUESE. 
THEY LOVE PORTUGAL. 
THERE ARE AROUND 1,500,000 
PORTUGUESE AMERICANS LIVING 
HERE. 
IT IS NOT JUST A POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC ALLIANCE. 
IT IS MORE THAN THAT. 
IT IS SOMETHING VERY HUMAN. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE SPEAKING OF 
ONE MILLION AND 400,000 PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE LOVE FOR TWO 
COUNTRIES AT THE SAME TIME. 
AS YOU SPOKE OF SOCCER, LET ME 
ASK YOU, MAKE A SUGGESTION. 
>> OKAY. 
>> IF YOU'RE GOING TO MEET MR. 
PUTIN. 
I WAS WITH HIM LAST WEEK. 
>> GOOD. 
>> HE ASKED ME TO GREET YOU. 
OF COURSE HE WAS EXPECTING YOUR 
VISIT. 
BUT ANYWAY, DON'T FORGET THAT 
PORTUGAL HAS THE BEST IN THE 
WORLD. 
I'M SURE THAT YOUR SON KNOWS 
IT. 
>> HE KNOWS IT WELL. 
>> DON'T FORGET IF YOU EVER GO 
TO RUSSIA DURING THE 
CHAMPIONSHIP, DON'T FORGET 
PORTUGUESE WANTS TO WIN. 
>> YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL. 
>> HE IS DOING VERY, VERY, VERY 
WELL. 
>> HOW GOOD A PLAYER IS HE? 
>> I'M VERY IMPRESSED. 
HE IS THE BEST PLAYER OF THE 
WORLD. 
IN A SENSE, WELL, I THINK HE 
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK -- 
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT FOR THE 
WORLD. 
>> WILL CHRISTIAN EVER RUN FOR 
PRESIDENT AGAINST YOU? 
HE WOULDN'T WIN. 
>> I MUST TELL YOU -- IT IS A 
LITTLE DIFFERENT. 
>> WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT 
JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS RETIRING. 
>> ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO. 
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED. 
>> HE CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
WE HAD A WONDERFUL DISCUSSION 
JUST PRIOR TO MEETING THE 
PRESIDENT. 
AND REALLY HAD A VERY DEEP 
DISCUSSION. 
I GOT HIS IDEAS ON THINGS, 
INCLUDING I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD 
CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT HE HAD 
GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT 
POTENTIALLY COULD TAKE HIS 
SEAT, WHICH IS A VERY HARD SEAT 
TO FILL. 
SO WE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT 
THINGS. 
AND HE WAS HERE FOR ABOUT HALF 
AN HOUR. 
I DON'T THINK YOU FOLKS SAW HIM 
COME IN AND OUT, DID YOU? 
I'M SHOCKED. 
BOY, THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT 
JOB. 
THAT IS A SHOCKER. 
THAT'S A SHOCKER. 
BUT YEAH WE HAD A -- HE JUST 
LEFT A LITTLE WHILE AGO, JUST 
PRIOR TO MEETING THE PRESIDENT. 
>> WOULD YOU TELL US WHO HE 
RECOMMENDED. 
>> NO. 
I WON'T DO THAT. 
BUT HE HAS -- YOU KNOW, THERE 
ARE CERTAIN NAMES THAT ARE JUST 
OUTSTANDING. 
NAMES THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW, TO 
BE HONEST WITH YOU. 
THEY ARE NAMES THAT YOU KNOW, 
OUTSTANDING, HIGHLY RESPECTED. 
NAMES YOU THAT WOULD KNOW, 
PRESIDENT. 
WE WILL BE LOOKING ATHE THEM 
AND OTHERS BUT THEY WILL COME 
FROM THE LIST OF 25 PEOPLE. 
OKAY. 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IT IS AN 
ELECTION YEAR. 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER HOLDING THAT 
SPOT OPEN UNTIL THE MAKEUP OF 
CONGRESS IS DETERMINED COME 
NOVEMBER. 
>> I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT 
ABOUT THAT. 
I THINK YOU NEED TO GO AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
IT IS A PROCESS. 
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. 
WE HAD A BIG DAY YESTERDAY. 
VERY BIG. 
WE HAD A GREAT DECISION TODAY 
IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS JUST 
RELEASED BY THE SUPREME COURT 
YESTERDAY. 
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE TRAVEL BAN 
IT WAS EXTREMELY BIG. 
AND WE HAD SOME TREMENDOUS 
ELECTION. 
SOUTH CAROLINA FROM MY OWN 
STANDPOINT, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE 
GOVERNOR, McMASTER WAS A BIG 
WIN. 
AS YOU KNOW, I WAS VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED IN NEW YORK WITH THE 
CONGRESSMAN, DONOVAN. 
SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY. 
WE'RE -- THIS WAS A GOOD FEW 
DAYS. 
NOW I GET TO TAP IT OFF WITH 
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
PORTUGAL. 
AND PORTUGAL HAS BEEN ACTUALLY 
VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR NATION. 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE HAVE ABOUT 
A MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE 
FROM PORTUGAL HERE. 
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
>> NO. 
I WANT THEM TO DO WHAT THEY 
WANT. 
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WE HAVE 
-- AND I TOLD THEM THIS 
MORNING, I SAID, PASS IT IF YOU 
CAN. 
I ALSO WANT HEM TO DO WHAT THEY 
WANT. 
WE HAVE A BIG IMMIGRATION BILL, 
LIKE YOU DO. 
AND EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT 
IMMIGRATION. 
NOW I THINK MORE THAN EVER 
BEFORE. 
I TOLD THEM A FEW HOURS AGO, I 
SAID, LOOK, PASS SOMETHING OR 
COME BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT 
WOULD -- BUT GET SOMETHING YOU 
WANT. 
WE NEED DEMOCRAT VOTES IN THE 
SENATE. 
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GET OVERLY 
EXCITED WITH THE HOUSE BILL 
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT WON'T PASS 
IN THE SENATE. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE 
DEMOCRATS TO VOTE ANYTHING. 
IF WE GAVE THEM 100% OF WHAT 
THEY WANTED AND THEN DOUBLED 
IT, THEY STILL WOULDN'T PASS IT 
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS A GOOD 
ELECTION POINT. 
I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR US. 
BECAUSE I THINK STRONG BORDERS 
-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW YOU 
FEEL ABOT THAT. 
BUT I THINK STRONG BORDERS AND 
NO CRIME, THAT IS US. 
THAT WILL BE A GREAT ELECTION 
POINT FOR US. 
SO I TOLD THEM TWO HOURS AGO, I 
SAID, YOU KNOW, DO WHAT YOU 
WANT. 
AND ULTIMATELY WE WILL COME TO 
SOMETHING. 
AND PERHAPS IT WILL BE AFTER 
THE ELECTION. 
MAYBE IT WILL BE BEFORE. 
AS OF THIS MOMENT, DEMOCRATS 
ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR 
ANYTHING. 
THEY REALLY ARE RESISTING OR 
OBSTRUCTING. 
OKAY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> DO YOU EXPECT AN OUTCOME. 
>> I THINK WE WILL BE TALKING 
ABOUT SYRIA AND UKRAINE. 
I THINK WE WILL BE TALKING 
ABOUT MANY OTHER SUBJECTS. 
AND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
YOU NEVER KNOW ABOUT MEETINGS 
WHAT HAPPENS. 
I THINK GOOD THINGS CAN COME 
WITH MEETING WITH PEOPLE. 
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF CHINA A EVERY 
PLACE THAT I HAVE BEEN WE HAVE 
HAD GREAT MEETINGS. 
MAYBE SOMETHING POSITIVE WILL 
COME OUT OF IT. 
>> MEAN YOU GET COMPLACENT AND 
HE LOST. 
THAT'S A BIG LOSS. 
THAT WAS A SHOCKING LOSS. 
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THEY'RE DOING GREAT. 
BY THE WAY, THE STEEL INDUSTRY 
IS ABSOLUTELY DOING GREAT. 
THE TARIFFS HAVE BEEN 
INCREDIBLE. 
AND THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS DOING 
GREAT. 
AND OUR COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT. 
YOU'RE SEEING THE RESULTS. 
THE NUMBERS COMING OUT FROM THE 
COMPANIES ARE FAR BEYOND WHAT 
ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 
WE'RE DOING REALLY GOOD. 
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE FAIR TRADE 
DEALS AND WE'RE WORKING ON 
REALLY FAIR TRADE DEALS. 
WE'RE WORKING WITH YOUR 
REPRESENTATIVES ON FAIR TRADE 
DEALS. 
>> YES. 
YES. 
>> THAT IS GOOD NEWS. 
>> THANK YOU EVERYBODY. 
>> IT HAS TO BE VERY GOOD. 
>> PROBABLY AFTER. 
>> THANK YOU, SIR. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> COULD BE. 
IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED. 
>> LET'S GO. 
LET'S KEEP GOING. 
>> SIR, LET'S GO. 
>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESS 
REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HE GAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT 
ANTHONY KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT. 
HE SAID JUSTICE KENNEDY DID GO 
INFORM THE WHITE HOUSE TO MEET 
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
THEY SPENT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR 
TALKING. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE 
ASKED THE JUSTICE FOR HIS 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A 
REPLACEMENT. 
THEY DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT 
THERE IS A LIST OF 25 POTENTIAL 
CANDIDATES. 
THAT WAS CREATED DURING THE 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN. 
LET'S BRING IN MAJOR GARRETT, 
OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT. 
MAJOR IS JOINING US FROM THE 
NORTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE. 
MAJOR, FOR OUR VIEWERS JUST 
JOINING US, TELL US ABOUT THIS 
LIST AND ITS ORIGINS. 
>> SO IT STARTED OFF AS A 
GENERAL LIST OF PREFERENCES. 
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT 
NUMBER WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. 
IT WAS LIKE 13, 14, 15. 
THEN IT BECAME A DEFINED LIST 
OF 20. 
THEN A NAME WAS ADDED IN 
SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER OF 2016. 
THAT'S WHEN CANDIDATE TRUMP 
SAID THIS IS MY LIST. 
IF I'M ELECTED THE PERSON I 
NOMINATE TO FILL THE SEAT OF 
SCALIA WILL COME FROM THIS 
LIST. 
JUDGE ME. 
JUDGE MY CANDIDACY. 
AND IF YOU WILL, JUDGE THE 
FUTURE OF THE COURT BASED ON 
THIS LIST. 
AS HE WAS PRESIDENT, THAT LIST 
GREW TO 25. 
AND THE PRESIDENT REAFFIRMED 
THAT THAT LIST IS CENTRAL TO 
HIS ALREADY ESTABLISHED VETTING 
PROCESS. 
AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT IN THE 
EAST ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
VERY EARLY IN HIS PRESIDENCY, 
BEFORE THE END OF JANUARY, 
ANNOUNCED NEIL GORSUCH AS HIS 
NOMINEE, HE DESCRIBED HIS 
SELECTION PROCESS JUSTIFIABLY 
AS THE MOST TRANSPARENT IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY. 
WHY? 
BECAUSE NEVER BEFORE HAD THERE 
BEEN A LIST. 
AND THAT LIST WAS FOLLOWED. 
NEIL GORSUCH WAS ON THAT SECOND 
LIST OF 20, THEN 21. 
SO WHOEVER THIS NOMINEE IS AND 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE PROCESS 
OF VETTING THE NEXT PERSON HAS 
BEGUN IMMEDIATELY. 
I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT NAME 
BEING PUT FORTH WITHIN A WEEK 
OR TWO AT THE MOMENT IS COMING 
FROM THIS LIST OF 25. 
AND THEN AS THE PRESIDENT WAS 
ASKED, WELL, WHY NOT WAIT TO 
HAVE AN INTERVENING ELECTION. 
NO. 
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. 
THERE IS NOT ONE CHANCE THAT 
THIS WHITE HOUSE OR THE 
SYMPATHETIC AND IN SOLIDARITY 
SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP 
WILL WAIT. 
AS SOON AS THE NOMINEE IS 
ANNOUNCED THE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS WILL BEGIN EXAMINE YOU 
CAN BE CERTAIN THERE BE A 
CONFIRMATION VOTE BEFORE THE 
MID TERM ELECTIONS TO FILL THE 
SEAT. 
NOW, JUST MEDEVAC HABIT BY THE 
RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE ANTHONY 
KENNEDY. 
>> WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
MENTION THERE ARE FRONTRUNNERS 
THAT ARE WELL KNOWN. 
HE EVEN SAID THE PRESIDENT OF 
PORTUGAL MAY KNOW THE NAMES OF 
THE FRONT RUNNERS. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT 
THE UPCOMING SUMMIT WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA. 
I'M WONDERING, MAJOR, HOW MUCH 
IS RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 
U.S. ELECTION GOING TO BE 
HANGING OVER THIS SUMMIT. 
>> IT WILL HANG OVER IT FOR 
CERTAIN. 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT? 
SYRIA, UKRAINE, ANOTHER GOLDEN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT 
TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 
ELECTION, THOROUGHLY 
ESTABLISHED. 
THERE IS A BODY OF EVIDENCE 
GROWING IN SIGNIFICANCE THAT 
THERE IS AT THE MARGIN SOME 
MECHANISMS BY WHICH USING THE 
SAME TACTICS RUSSIANS ARE 
TRYING TO INTERFERE WITH THE 
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE 2018 
ELECTION. 
NOT A WORD SAID FROM THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
THIS IS JUST THE LATEST IN 
WHICH HE SERVED UP ON A PLATTER 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY 
SOMETHING, JUST RECOGNIZE IT 
FIRST, CRITICIZE IT SECOND, 
ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN 
AMERICAN POLITICS. 
THE PRESIDENT, AGAIN, LET THAT 
OPPORTUNITY LAPSE AND GO BY THE 
WAYSIDE. 
SO WHETHER THEY DISCUSS IT 
DIRECTLY OR NOT, IT WILL 
OVERHANG BECAUSE IT IS A 
SERIOUS ISSUE. 
IT'S GOT BIPARTISAN CONCERN. 
THERE ARE NUMEROUS ONGOING 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
SOME OF THEM JUST TECHNICAL AND 
TACTICAL. 
HOW DID IT HAPPEN, WHAT WERE 
THE METHODS. 
SOME WITH POTENTIAL CRIMINAL 
ASPECTS TO THEM. 
THE ROBERT MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION CERTAINLY ABOUT 
THIS ISSUE. 
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE GENERALIZED 
AND VERY SHARP CONCERNS ABOUT 
THIS. 
AND GIVEN OPPORTUNITY AFTER 
OPPORTUNITY AFTER OPPORTUNITY 
SO BOTH NOTE THAT AND TO 
CRITICIZE IT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS LEFT EVERY ONE OF THOSE 
OPPORTUNITIES PASS HIM BY. 
WHAT IS INTERESTING, IT WILL 
HAPPEN SOMETIME IN MID JULY ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRIP TO 
THE NATO SUMMIT. 
THE TWO PLACES MOST LIKELY TO 
BE THE HOST, AUSTRIA AND 
FINLAND. 
PEOPLE BELIEVE IT WILL BE IN 
FINLAND FOR GEOGRAPHIC 
PURPOSES. 
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO GET THERE 
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN TO GET 
THERE AND GET BACK FOR THE 
WORLD CUP. 
I WOULD THINK THAT FINLAND WILL 
PROBABLY BE THE PLACE THAT IT 
WILL BE. 
>> THE ONE THING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DID SAY ON THE TOPIC 
OF RUSSIA WAS SIMPLY THEY'RE 
DOING A GREAT JOB WITH THE 
WORLD CUP. 
NOTHING WE HEARD THERE ABOUT 
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. 
NOW, COMING BACK TO JUSTICE 
KENNEDY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER 
MITCH NOT -- MITCH MCCONNELL 
SAID THEY WILL PROCEED 
IMMEDIATELY. 
>> THERE ARE PROCEDURAL THINGS 
THAT YOU CAN SLOW THINGS DOWN 
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU IF 
REPUBLICANS INTO TOWED HAVE 
OVERNIGHT SESSIONS OR WEEKEND 
SESSIONS JUST TO RUN OUT THE 
CLOCK, THEY WILL DO IT. 
WHAT EVER IS REQUIRED UNDER 
SENATE PROCEDURES TO GET THE 
HEARINGS HELD, THE VOTE THROUGH 
THE COMMITTEE, WHICH IS THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND THEN 
THE FLOOR VOTE TO HAVE 
CONFIRMATION, SENATE 
REPUBLICANS WILL DO IT TO GET 
THIS JUSTICE ON THE BENCH. 
TO REPLACE KENNEDY, AND TO HAVE 
A SECOND TRUMP PERSON ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
THEREBY ESTABLISHING A 
SUBSTANTIAL LEGACY ALREADY 
BEFORE THE END OF HIS SECOND 
YEAR IN OFFICE, NOT ONLY ON THE 
SUPREME COURT BUT I THINK JAN 
MADE REFERENCE TO THIS. 
IF SHE DIDN'T, I WILL MAKE THE 
POINT NOW. 
NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN 
HISTORY HAS NOMINATED AND SEEN 
CONFIRMED MORE APPELLATE 
JUSTICES ON THE FEDERAL BENCH 
THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
THAT IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH HE 
IS RESHAPING THE FEDERAL 
JUDICIARY. 
NOT JUST AT THE SUPREME COURT 
BUT AT THE APPEAL AT COURTS. 
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF TRUMP 
NOMINEE THAT'S HAVE BEEN 
SUBMITTED AND APPROVED FOR 
DISTRICT COURT POSITIONS AS 
WELL. 
SO ALREADY THERE IS A TRUMP 
LEGACY ON THE FEDERAL BENCH. 
A SECOND SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 
WILL EVEN MORE. 
>> DO YOU THINK THIS WILL 
EMBOLDEN, KNOWING THAT TWO 
JUDGES WERE HAND PICKED BY HIM. 
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL SUGGEST. 
YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
HOW THINGS SHAKE OUT. 
THE PRESIDENT AND THE SUPREME 
COURT DECISION ON THE TRAVEL 
BAN SAID SOMETHING THAT I THINK 
WAS IMPORTANT. 
SEPARATE FROM WHO DONALD TRUMP 
IS AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID 
ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICY. 
THE SUPREME COURT SAID LONG 
BEFORE DONALD TRUMP THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES INVESTED TREMENDOUS 
AUTHORITY IN THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
AND THE OFFICE OF THE 
PRESIDENCY TO DEAL WITH 
IMMIGRATION POLICY GENERALLY 
AND VERY SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE 
WIDE LATITUDE ON QUESTIONS OF 
IMMIGRATION POLICY AS THEY 
RELATE TODAY NATIONAL SECURITY. 
THE SUPREME COURT WENT OUT OF 
ITS WAY TO SAY THIS WAS A 
PREEXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL 
PREROGATIVE OF EVERY PRESIDENT. 
REGARDLESS OF WHO THE OCCUPANT 
IS NOW AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT 
THAT OCCUPANT SAID AS A 
CANDIDATE OR AS PRESIDENT, THIS 
AUTHORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
THERE. 
SO THE QUESTION FOR THE SUPREME 
COURT WAS, DID TRAVEL BAN 3.0 
FALL WITHIN THAT LONG 
ESTABLISHED LEGAL AUTHORITY. 
THE SUPREME COURT BY A 5-4 
NARROW MAJORITY, I GRANT YOU, 
SAID YES, IT DID. 
SO TO ASK THE QUESTION, WAS THE 
PRESIDENT EMBOLDENED IN THE 
FIRST PLACE? 
KNOW THOUGHT HE HAD THAT POWER. 
IT TURNS OUT UNDER THE THIRD 
VARIATION OF THE TRAVEL BAN IN 
FACT HE DID. 
IF HE TRIED THAT ON TRAVEL BAN 
1 AND 2, HE WOULD HAVE FAILED 
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT'S 
DECISION MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR, 
EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T SAY 
EXPLICITLY, NEITHER ONE OF THE 
FIRST TWO TRAVEL BAN VARIATIONS 
WOULD HAVE PASSED 
CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY. 
SO THAT IN ITSELF IS AN EXAMPLE 
OF HOW THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 
NECESSARILY FEEL EMBOLDEED AND 
HAD TO REWORK HIS OWN POLICY. 
SO EVERY PRESIDENT HAS TO LOOK 
AT EXISTING LAW AND THE WAY 
THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS 
HISTORICALLY DEALT WITH CASES. 
AND PLENTY OF PRESIDENTS HAVE 
LEARNED JUST BECAUSE YOU 
NOMINATE AND SEE CONFIRMED ON 
YOUR WATCH SOMEONE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT DOESN'T MEAN 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE AND IT 
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY OUGHT TO 
BE A RELIABLE VOTE ON BEHALF OF 
YOUR AGENDA. 
LOTS OF PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN 
BURNED BY THAT. 
MORE OF THEM REPUBLICAN THAN 
DEMOCRAT IN RECENT TIMES. 
BUT THAT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING 
THAT PRESIDENTS HAVE IN THE 
BACK OF THEIR MINDS. 
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT I WOULD BE 
PREPARED TO SAY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD OR WOULD NOT 
FEEL EMBOLDENED. 
IT WILL BE UP TO THE VOTERS TO 
DECIDE. 
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT ANALYSIS. 
FOR NOW A QUICK BREAK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
