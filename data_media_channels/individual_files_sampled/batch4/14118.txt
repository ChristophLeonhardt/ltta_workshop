so David Egan the Alberta Education Minister for Rachel Notley says that parents knowing about their kids is dangerous joining us now via Skype from northern Alberta is Robert a bureau chief Sheila gun Reid she'll I don't even think I properly characterized this issue I mean I think kids should learn about sex I think that's a very private personal thing that's informed by religion philosophy customs cultural values parents norms the fact that this is being done in secret in school classes of young as elementary school and that David Eggen says not only will the schools teach it in their own way but it is dangerous of parents even know about it they're insane and it's not even that the schools get to talk about it in their own way because that's another contentious issue with the gay straight alliances is that the schools have to talk about it in the government way in Alberta we have a very diverse education system we have a lot of faith-based schools and the government has said that schools can't teach sex ed through the lens of the faith that the school is based on they have to teach it in Rachel notley's way and I mean that's just I mean these GSA's on some level violate religious freedom but now they're making it illegal for teachers to tell parents what is going on with their child I mean think about that if two parents are divorced the two parents have to tell each other what the kids are doing and what sort of extracurricular activities they're involved in but this new law will make teachers more important in a child's life and has more authority in a child's life with regard to what's going on then the parents themselves that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
