1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
unfortunately it continues to be quite
strong in fact it's even grown in

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,309
strength in the last couple of hours
sustained winds 165 and now the National

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,080
Hurricane Center does believe it will
make landfall in Puerto Rico most likely

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,460
just before that with these winds at 165
that would make this the strongest

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,710
hurricane in history to make landfall
the last time they had a category 4 1932

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,840
in 1928 they had a category 5 but
sustained winds were 160 so the cemetry

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,040
is what concerns me wolf the bright
purple it's got a well-defined core now

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,290
the only thing that could help us out to
lose any strength whatsoever is if this

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,770
system would undergo an eye wall
replacement cycle we talked about that

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,760
all the time with Irma and Harvey and if
it would do that then maybe you could

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,440
drop a good 15 miles per hour but that's
just 15 miles per hour we'll take it

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,039
devastated Dominica is that moved
through it was a tighter eye sometimes

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,090
those tighter eyes are more ferocious
and they're just wind makers this system

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,039
carries it very close to st. Croix could
put them in that eye wall in that front

15
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,820
white right quadrant where you do not
want to be but it looks like conditions

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,540
not only deteriorate in st. Croix we're
looking at a landfall around 8:00 or

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,369
9:00 in the morning tomorrow morning by
late tomorrow the tropical storm force

18
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,630
winds will have exited Puerto Rico and
we do have more warnings now in fact the

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,479
northern coast of Dominican Republic now
under a warning moments ago we have

20
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,380
watches now in effect for the Turks and
Caicos in the southeast Bahama Islands

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,670
so we do expect this storm system to
progress in this direction staying away

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,869
from the US coastline for now but the
warnings are in effect and again after

23
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,740
making landfall in Dominica we had
problems there are some power outages in

24
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,970
Guadalupe Montserrat as well but our big
concern tonight it's going to be st.

25
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,170
Croix and then conditions deteriorating
take a look at the storm surge it's

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,729
higher for the Lesser Antilles islands
for the US and British Virgin Islands

27
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,110
getting up seven to even 11 feet while
they're only looking at 69 I only say 6

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,070
to 9 feet in Puerto Rico some of that
has to do with the gradual sloping of

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,899
the ocean floor when you have a slow
slope it creates larger winds and of

30
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,500
course our waves that are pushed by
those winds the amount of rainfall could

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,780
be staggering and this high terrain as
well wolf we could easily see

32
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,800
up to 18 inches in some areas many live
along the coastline they don't want to

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,350
go to the mountain areas where the winds
are stronger and the rain will be

34
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,040
heavier so well this is definitely going
to pack a punch and we're watching it

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:00:00,000
every hour by hour
