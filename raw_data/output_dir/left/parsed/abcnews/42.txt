>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, WE'RE COMING
TO YOU LIVE FROM PARKLAND 
FLORIDA, AT THIS HOUR.
WE'RE INTERRUPTING REGULARLY 
SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING TO BRING 
YOU BREAKING NEWS.
AUTHORITIES BEFORE THE CAMERAS 
IN PARKLAND TO UPDATE US ON THE 
SHOOTING WHERE THE INVESTIGA%-P 
MIGHT EXPECT A MORE DETAILED 
TIME LINE.
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.
17 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
AT LEAST 15 INJURED, SEVERAL OF 
THE INJURED ARE FIGHTING FOR 
THEIR LIVES, THE 19-YEAR-OLD 
NIKOLAS CRUZ IS EXPECTED IN 
COURT THIS AFTERNOON.
THE NEWS CONFERENCE BEGAN HOURS 
A
MOMENTS AGO, MICHAEL LEONARD OF 
A NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY WHEN HE 
DECIDED TO JOIN THE SEARCH FOR 
THE SUSPECT.
HE DESCRIBED WHAT IT WAS LIKE 
COMING UPON IT.
LET'S LISTEN.
>> I WAS THE FIRST OFFICER TO 
MAKE CONTACT WITH THE SUSPECT.
SPELLING OF MY NAME 
L-E-O-N-A-R-D.
CITY OF COCONUT CREEK, RIGHT 
NEXT TO CORAL SPRINGS, PARKLAND.
JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE 
INSIGHT AS TO WHAT HAPPENED IN 
MY DAY THAT I WAS AT THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS IN 
COCONUT CREEK WHEN THE CALL CAME
OUT.
I DECIDED TO COME OVER AND HELP 
IN ANY WAY THAT I COULD.
WHEN I ARRIVED TO THE AREA THERE
WAS A HEAVY PRESENCE OF 
OFFICERS, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL 
AND I DECIDED TO EXPAND MY 
SEARCH FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT 
WAS STILL ON THE LOOSE.
WE HAD BEEN GIVEN INFORMATION 
VIA THE RADIO AS TO WHAT HE HAD 
BEEN WEARING.
THIS INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED 
THROUGH THE RADIO DISPATCH.
I DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO SOME OF 
THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS LOCATED 
NEAR THE SCHOOL.
AND AS I TRAVELED DOWN ONE OF 
THE BACK ROADS, IT'S A HEAVILY 
RESIDENTIAL AREA, I HAPPENED TO 
COME ACROSS, JUST MYSELF -- NOT 
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT, COUPLE OF 
PEOPLE WALKING DOGS IN THE AREA.
AS I CONTINUED DOWN THIS 
ROADWAY, I DISCOVERED AN 
INDIVIDUAL WALKING ON THE 
SIDEWALK THAT WAS WEARING THE 
CLOTHING DESCRIPTION THAT HAD 
BEEN GIVEN OVER THE RADIO.
HE LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL HIGH 
SCHOOL STUDENT.
AND FOR A QUICK MOMENT, I 
THOUGHT COULD THIS BE THE 
PERSON -- IS THIS WHO I NEED TO 
STOP?
TRAINING KICKED IN AND I PULLED 
MY VEHICLE OVER IMMEDIATELY AND 
ENGAGED THE SUSPECT.
HE COMPLIED WITH MY COMMANDS AND
WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WITHOUT 
ANY -- ANY ISSUES.
>> DID HE HAVE A WEAPON WITH 
HIM?
>> I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT.
THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
ONGOING.
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME RIGHT 
NOW TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR 
MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, EMERGENCY SERVICES 
THAT HAVE PUT ALL OF THEIR HART 
AND SOUL INTO THIS.
THIS IS WHAT WE TRAIN FOR AND 
HOPE NEVER HAPPENS.
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR ALL 
THEIR SERVICES AND EVERYTHING 
THAT THEY DO AND MY CONDOLENCES 
TO THE FAMILY THAT HAVE LOVED 
ONES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MY NAME IS FRANK B-AB-NAC, 
BEFORE I START OFF WITH HOW THIS
WENT FOR US YESTERDAY, I'D LIKE 
TO TELL ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF 
PARKLAND AND CORAL SPRINGS THAT 
FROM ALL OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF
OUR DEPARTMENT THAT WE ARE VERY 
SORRY FOR WHAT THEY ARE GOING 
THROUGH.
OUR FIREFIGHTERS SHARE IN THEIR 
GRIEF.
THEY FEEL FOR THEM.
THEY FEEL WITH THEM.
WE ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND
WE ARE HERE TO PROTECT THEM 
DURING THE EVENT AND WE'LL BE 
HERE TO PROTECT THEM AFTER THE 
EVENT.
YESTERDAY JUST BEFORE 2:30 P.M.,
WE RECEIVED A CALL FOR A 
POSSIBLE ACTIVE SHOOTER EVENT.
AS WE STARTED OUR RESPONSE, WE 
REALLY AREN'T SURE IF IT WAS A 
REAL EVENT OR NOT.
WE GET CALLS LIKE THIS ONCE IN A
WHILE AND TURN OUT TO BE NONREAL
CALLS, WHICH IS A GOOD THINGS.
AS WE BEGAN TO RESPOND, WE GOT 
MORE AND MORE INFORMATION THAT 
MADE THIS MORE AND MORE REAL FOR
US.
MYSELF ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER 
CHIEF OFFICERS AND FIRE 
PERSONNEL WERE RESPONDING TO THE
SCENE.
AS WE GOT TO THE SCENE, WE HAD 
TO SETD UP AN APPROPRIATE 
COMMAND POST AND TRIAGE AREA TO 
DEAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF POSSIBLE
PATIENTS THAT WE WERE GOING TO 
HAVE.
AS WE APPROACHED THE SCENE AND 
GOT SET UP, WE GOT INFORMATION 
THERE MAY BE PATIENTS ON THE 
WEST SIDE OF THE BUILDING SO I 
WENT AROUND TO INVESTIGATE THAT 
WHERE WE DID LOCATE ONE VICTIM 
AND REMOV REMOVED HIM FROM THAT.
AND I RETURNED TO THE COMMAND 
POST.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ALL OF THE 
FIRST RESPONDERS TRAIN FOR 
EVENTS LIKE THIS.
WE HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT.
WE HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO USE 
THAT TRAINING.
THIS IS A HORRIBLE EVENT.
BUT I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF ALL 
OF THE FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS 
AND ALL OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS 
AND E.R. FOLKS AND EVERYBODY 
THAT TREATED THESE PATIENTS DID 
IT WITH SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF 
PROFESSIONALISM AND READINESS 
THAT I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT.
I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR 
ALLOWING THIS OPPORTUNITY AND 
OUR FIREFIGHTERS CAN NEVER -- 
OUR FIRST RESPONDERS CAN NEVER 
UNSEE WHAT THEY SAW YESTERDAY.
SO WE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO 
MAKE SURE THEY GET THE RESOURCES
THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS AS
PART OF THE COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.
>> SO THERE YOU HEAR AUTHORITIES
ON THE SCENE JUST MOMENTS AGO.
THAT'S THE CORAL SPRINGS FIRE 
DEPARTMENT AND OF COURSE MICHAEL
LEONARD, OFFICER LEONARD WHO 
ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE THE CAMERAS 
THAT HE WAS THE FIRST OFFICER 
FROM A NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY WHO
ACTUALLY CAME UPON THAT SUSPECT 
ASKING TO HIMSELF COULD THIS BE 
THE STUDENT.
WE NOW KNOW HE LEFT THOSE 
BUILDINGS WITH ALL OF THE OTHER 
STUDENTS WHO WERE LEAVING THE 
SCHOOL CAMPUS TRIED TO BLEND IN 
WITH THEM.
IT WAS SOME HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE
WAS ACTUALLY DISCOVERED.
THAT SUSPECT OF COURSE IS 
NIKOLAS CRUZ, 19 YEARS OLD, WE 
HAVE IMAGES FROM A SHORT TIME OF
AGO IN COURT THIS AFTERNOON FOR 
A BOND HEARING.
WE LEARNED SEVERAL THINGS FROM 
THIS HEARING.
IN ADDITION TO ALREADY BEING 
CHARGED WITH 17 COUNTS OF 
PREMEDITATED MURDER, THEY TALKED
IN COURT ABOUT SOME OF HIS TRIS 
TRI, HE LOST HIS FATHER WHEN HE 
WAS YOUNG AND MOTHER RECENTLY TO
THE FLU, IT'S BELIEVED.
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ALSO TALKED 
ABOUT A HISTORY OF MENTAL 
ILLNESS.
HE TALKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE, 
POSSIBLE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM AND
THAT WOULD BE LOOKED INTO.
COURT ACKNOWLEDGED THERE COULD 
BE ADDITIONAL CHARGES COMING AND
SAID THAT THE SUSPECT IS ON 
SUICIDE WATCH.
IT IS BELIEVED HE HAS 
COMMUNICATED PERHAPS GIVEN SOME 
SORT OF STATEMENT TO 
AUTHORITIES.
ALL HE DID IN COURT WAS 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IN FACT 
WAS HIS NAME.
ALSO THIS AFTERNOON, AN IMAGE 
COMING IN OF THE ASSAULT RIFLE 
THAT AUTHORITIES FOUND, THEY 
BELIEVE THIS WAS THE WEAPON USED
AN AR-15, WEAPONED WE NOW KNOW 
LEGALLY.
THIS SPRAWLING CAMPUS OF MARJORY
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL IS 
CLOSED TODAY AND TOMORROW.
I SPENT TIME THIS AFTERNOON WITH
A FAIRLY LARGE GROUP OF STUDENTS
THAT SURVIVED THIS AND TALKED 
ABOUT THE HORROR IN THE 
HALLWAYS, WENT DOWN THE HALLWAYS
SHOOTING INTO THE WINDOWS BESIDE
THE CLASSROOM DOORS, DESCRIBING 
THE HORROR OF THOSE SCENES, 
WATCHING STUDENTS DROP NEXT TO 
THEM IN THOSE CLASSROOMS.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS I BRING IN
OUR CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT,
PIERRE, THESE STUDENTS YOUNG 
JUNIORS AND SENIORS IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, TALKED ABOUT MENTAL 
HEALTH BUT ALSO TALKED ABOUT 
WEAPONS SAYING THAT OUR 
LAWMAKERS IN WASHINGTON AND THEY
WERE -- VERY STRONG WITH THEIR 
OPINIONS, THESE STUDENTS SAYING 
OUR SCHOOL IS JUST THE LATEST 
SCHOOL AND NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE AND THEY HAVE EXPECTATIONS 
THAT SOMETHING, SOMETHING WILL 
BE DONE TO TRY TO KEEP THE 
SHOOTINGS FROM HAPPENING AND 
YOU'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE 
WEAPON AND HE DID FIND THAT 
WEAPON, PURCHASE IT LEGALLY. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT, DAVID.
HE BOUGHT THIS WEAPON LEGALLY 
FROM A FEDERAL LICENSED GUN 
DEALER, PASSED WITH FLYING 
COLORS.
THE GUN DEALER WE'RE BEING TOLD 
DID EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.
NOTHING IN HIS RECORD INDICATED 
THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A THREAT
IN TERMS OF A CRIMINAL RECORD AT
THAT POINT.
BUT DAVID, AS YOU POINT OUT, ALL
OF THESE DIFFERENT RED FLAGS 
THAT WERE KNOWN TO PEOPLE, 
STUDENTS TALKING ABOUT HIM 
TALKING ABOUT VIOLENCE.
WE HEARD THE SUPERINTENDENT 
TODAY DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT 
HE WAS A PERSON WHO HAD ISSUES 
AND WHO HAD BEEN GETTING SUPPORT
AND COUNSELING.
AND THE FBI TODAY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT THERE WAS A YOUTUBE POSTING
THEY WERE MADE AWARE OF WHERE 
THE SUSPECT OR SOMEONE WITH A 
NAME LIKE HIS, THE NOTION THAT 
HE WANTED TO A PROFESSIONAL 
SCHOOL SHOOTER.
THE FBI SAID THEY COULD NOT 
IDENTIFY HIM, DAVID.
AND DID NOT TAKE ADDITIONAL 
ACTION AS FAR AS WE KNOW.
BUT CLEARLY, THOSE STUDENTS 
UNDERSTOOD THAT WE'RE SEEING 
MORE AND MORE OF THESE KINDS OF 
INCIDENTS, STRIKING THEY KNEW 
WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF RUN, 
HIDE, SEEK SUPPORT, IT'S 
REMARKABLE.
>> NOT ONLY IS IT STRIKING 
PIERRE, IT'S ALSO A SIGN OF THE 
TIMES AND STUDENTS TALKED ABOUT 
THAT.
THEY KNEW THEY HAD A FIRE DRILL 
WHEN THIS ALARM WENT OFF THEY 
THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD 
ABOUT THAT BUT THEY HAD BEEN 
TRAINED WHAT A CODE RED WAS.
THAT'S WHAT THEY HEARD FROM 
AUTHORITIES AFTER THE SECOND 
ALARM WAS FLIPPED OFF.
NOW THEY SUSPECT THAT THE 
SUSPECT IT'S BELIEVED ACTUALLY 
SET OFF THE SECOND ALARM LATE IN
THE AFTERNOON TO GET PEOPLE IN 
THE HALLWAYS SO HE COULD TAKE 
AIM.
A STAGGERING NUMBER.
THIS WAS THE 18th SCHOOL 
SHOOTING BY ONE COUNT AT A 
SCHOOL JUST THIS YEAR AND O
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY 
THROUGH FEBRUARY.
WE'LL HAVE TEAM COVERAGE TONIGHT
AND IF NEWS WARRANTS, WE'LL 
BREAK BACK ON IF WE LEARN 
ANYTHING MORE FROM THE SHERIFF 
ABOUT THE TIME LINE AND PEOPLE 
STILL AT THE HOSPITAL IN THIS 
COMMUNITY FIGHTING FOR THEIR 
LIVES.
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M DAVID MUIR,
I'LL SEE YOU FOR WORLD NEWS 
TONIGHT.
UNTIL THEN, GOOD DAY.
