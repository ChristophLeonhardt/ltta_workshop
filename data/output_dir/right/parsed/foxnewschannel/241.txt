>> BONKERS.
>> THAT WAS AN ASSAULT ON
OUR WHITE HOUSE.
>> I THINK THE TRUMP WHITE
HOUSE NEEDS TO BE PUT ON
TRIAL FOR THIS SPECTACLE.
>> THIS IS WHITE SUPREMACY
BY VENTRILOQUISM.
BLACK MOUTH IS MOVING BUT
WHITE IDEAS ARE FLOWING FROM
HIS MOUTH.
>> THIS WAS EMBARRASSMENT.
COUNCIL YEA'S MOTHER IS
ROLLING OVER IN HER GRAVE.
STEVE: SOME OF THE MEDIA
REACTION LAST NIGHT TO
COUNCIL YEA WEST LUNCHTIME
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
LET'S BRING IN CANDACE
OWENS.
SHE IS THE COMMUNICATIONS
DIRECTOR FOR TURNING POINT
U.S.A. OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF MONTHS SHE HAS BECOME
FRIENDLY WITH KANYE.
CANDACE, WHAT DID YOU MAKE
OF SOME OF THOSE SOUND
BITES, FOR INSTANCE, TALKING
ABOUT HOW HIS APPEARANCE WAS
AN ASSAULT ON THE WHITE
HOUSE?
>> LOOK, ALL THE COMMENTARY
THAT I HAVE HEARD
SURROUNDING THIS MEETING HAS
BEEN ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE.
UTTERLY RACIST ESPECIALLY
COMING FROM CNN.
DON LEMON BRINGING UP
KANYE'S DEAD MOTHER TO DRAW
BLOOD FROM THIS MAN BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T AGREE WITH
LIBERAL IDEAS.
HE UNDERSTANDS DEMOCRATIC
POLICIES HAVE HARMED THE
BLACK COMMUNITY.
IS HE BOLD ENOUGH TO MOVE
THE BALL FORWARD AND SPEAK
ABOUT PUBLICLY.
IT'S DESPARTICULAR CABLE.
KANYE WAS BUILT FOR THIS.
>> WHAT IS HE LIKE?
>> I MET WITH HIM FOLLOWING
HIS MEETING.
HE IS JUST IN A VERY, VERY
POSITIVE STATE.
HE IS OPTIMISTIC.
HE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY WHAT
HE IS DOING.
I MEAN, THERE WAS A LOT OF
HAPPINESS AND EUPHORIA IN
THE ROOM.
I SIMPLY SAID THE PARADIGM
HAS SLIFTDED BECAUSE IT HAS.
BLACK CONSERVATIVES WILL NO
LONGER BE FEARFUL.
BLACK CONSERVATIVES ARE
WILLING TO SPEAK OUT.
WE ARE EXCITED.
IT FINALLY FEELS LIKE IT'S
OUR TIME.
AND THE COMMENTARY MEANS
NOTHING.
IT WILL NOT DISSUADE US FROM
SPEAKING OUT.
BRIAN: KIND OF DRUG.
THE BACKLASH HAS BEEN SO
ENORMOUS.
YOU WOULD THINK THAT MAYBE
THE WORD IS KEEP YOUR MOUTH
SHUT BECAUSE WHO WANTS THIS
BLOW BACK, CANDACE.
CAN YOU BLAME SOMEBODY FOR
NOT COMING FORWARD WHEN YOU
GET THIS TYPE OF
RETRIBUTION?
>> I DON'T BLAME THEM.
I THINK IT'S ALL SORT OF
COME TO A HEAD.
IN THE PAST WE HAVE SEEN
THAT.  THAT'S WHY BLACK
CONSERVATISM WAS SO SHUNNED
AND SAW THEIR TREATMENT OF
DR. BEN CARSON, LARRY ELDER,
DR. CONDOLEEZZA RICE.
THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME.
WE ARE AUDACIOUS.
WE ARE STANDING UP.
AT TURNING POINTS U.S.A. WE
HAVE OUR FIRST EVER YOUNG
BLACK LEADERSHIP SUMMIT.
BLACK CONSERVATIVES ARE
GOING TO HEAR THESE IDEAS TO
MEET THE FIRST FAMILY.
TO SAY HAVE THE PRESIDENT
SPEAK TO US.
WE ARE FEELING INSPIRED.
WE ARE FEELING BOLD AND
OPTIMISTIC AND FEELS LIKE AT
LONG LAST THIS IS OUR TIME
TO SPEAK OUT.
BRIAN: I KNOW YOU SPEAK TO
THE PRESIDENT OFTEN.
YOU KNOW DARRELL SCOTT AND
OTHERS.
WE HAVE HAD THEM IN HERE.
BEN CARSON.
THEY ARE MAKING SOME MAJOR
MOVES IN THE INNER CITIES.
WE KNOWED ABOUT NEW
OPPORTUNITY ZONES THAT'S IN
THE NEW TAX REFORM.
THEY ARE NOT DOING A GOOD
JOB GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT.
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
DOING.
I FEEL LIKE IN SO MANY WAYS
THAT'S WHAT YOU I'M HERE FOR
TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE DOING THE
SUMMIT TO BRING OUR
COMMUNITY TO THE IDEAS.
I MYSELF AM LAUNCHING A
PROJECT NEXT WEEK WHICH I'M
NOT GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT
TODAY.
REALLY EXCITING.
WE WILL TARGET THE INNER
CITIES AND HAVE THESE SORTS
OF RALLIES AND CONVERSATIONS
TO KEEP THIS GOING.
KANYE HAS BUILT US A RUNWAY
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO
SQUANDER THAT OPPORTUNITY
WHATSOEVER.
STEVE: CANDACE, WHAT'S YOUR
MESSAGE TO THE SOUND BITERS
WHO WERE ON TELEVISION LAST
NIGHT AND WILL BE ON TODAY
TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT
WHAT KANYE SAID THERE IN THE
OVAL OFFICE IN THAT 10
MINUTE SOLILOQUY REGARDING
HIM AS CRAZY?
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO HIM.
>> MY MESSAGE IS I CAN HEAR
THEIR FEAR.
I CAN HEAR THEIR INSECURITY
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE
IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEY
CAN SAY.
THERE ARE NO WORDS STRONG
ENOUGH THAT IS GOING TO STOP
THIS MOVEMENT OF BLACK
CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT.
STEVE: WHAT IS THE FEAR?
>> THEY ARE FEARFUL THAT
THEY ARE LOSING CONTROL AND
THAT THEY ARE LOSING POWER.
ONE THING SURPRISED BY
DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY.
THEY WERE SURPRISED BY THAT
THEY THOUGHT HILLARY HAD
THIS.
THEY HAD DONE SO MUCH AND
INVESTED SO MUCH INTO HER.
AMERICA SURPRISED THEM.
THEY NEVER EVER EVER SAW
THISSING COMING.
THEY NEVER SAW AN AWAKENING
IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT
WE MIGHT START TO UNDERSTAND
OUR HISTORY AND UNDERSTAND
THEY ARE OUR OPPRESSORS THEY
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OUR
OPPRESSORS.
WE WILL NO LONGER LET THEM
OPPRESS US.
AINSLEY: HOW BIG IS THAT
MOVEMENT?
>> IT'S HUGE.
I CANNOT STRESS TO YOU
ENOUGH WHAT MY INBOX LOOKS
LIKE FROM THE BLACK
COMMUNITY SAYING I NEVER
EVEN UNDERSTOOD.
THIS I NEVER HEARD THIS
PERSPECTIVE.
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME TO
THIS.
I WANT TO GET INVOLVED.
HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED.
WE ARE TELLING THEM EXACTLY
HOW THEY CAN DO THAT.
STEVE: ISN'T THERE A FEAR ON
THE PART OF SOME IF THEY
COME FORWARD AND SUPPORT
THIS PRESIDENT THEY ARE
GOING TO GET THE KANYE
TREATMENT?
>> NO.
IT FEELS A BIT PUNK ROCK.
A BIT ROCK AND ROLL.
WEARING THE MAGA HAT AS
KANYE STRESSED YESTERDAY.
THERE IS SOMETHING
EMPOWERING ABOUT THAT.
I WEAR IT THROUGH AIRPORTS
ALL THE TIME TO LET PEOPLE
KNOW LIBERALS CANNOT BULLY
ME.
THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU
CAN SAY THAT DISTRACTS ME
FROM KNOWING I AM CORRECT
AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO WEAR
THIS HAT AND SUPPORTS THIS
PRESIDENCY.
AINSLEY: WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY
IN THE AIRPORT WHEN YOU WEAR
THE HAT?
DO YOU EVER GET BULL IDEA.
>> LACY WEEK I WAS ON AN
AMERICANS AIRLINE FLIGHT.
A WOMAN WALKED OVER AND SAID
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
YOUR HAT OFFENDS ME AS A
WOMAN.
I SAID I WANT TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT THAT IS NONE OF MY
BUSINESS.
HAVE A SEAT.
STEVE: HAVE A SEAT.
LET'S GO.
CANDACE OWENS WHO HAS A BIG
