side in terms of sector own small cap

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,070
again we're very growth-oriented fund

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,900
and right now nearly a third of the

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">portfolio's in technology where we we</font>

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of growth there another twenty</font>

percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare and literally almost</font>

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,300
twenty percent consumer discretionary so

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,390
probably get some some results here

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,910
Friday as I max you know if you're

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,699

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,629
doing very well and they've changed

23
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,220
their business model from several<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago they used to sell cameras and and</font>

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,460
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you know make some films</font>

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,140
but now they're actually joint venturing

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,330
with a lot of the large theater change

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,400
you can go to theater chains in several

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,799
areas now and see an imax theater and

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really altering their</font>

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,549
business model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really like what</font>

32
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,710
they've done there and and with avatar

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,460
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> james cameron we we think there's</font>

34
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,710
a catalyst that come in this friday with

35
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,960
their grand with the opening of avatar

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,780
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my background is being on the</font>

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,579
south side and when in a when a stock

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,079
out to a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> market cap you had to</font>

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,640
drop coverage there was just no interest

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,100
re i mean obviously small cap stocks

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,500
have done really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well i'll perform the</font>

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">mid cap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and large-cap names is their</font>

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
interests are people buying ETFs the

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,740
indices how are they playing the small

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,360
cat names well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there has been</font>

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,780
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know certainly interest</font>

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,399
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> really went down the tubes</font>

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,369
about a year ago because small cap

49
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,990
stocks are by definition the riskier

50
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,270
asset class so there was a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

51
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">know flight to quality but as that's</font>

52
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,220
come back small cap stocks are risky

53
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,650
people are playing them broadly using

54
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,450
fund managers like myself or<font color="#E5E5E5"> others i</font>

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,680
mean that's certainly one way to do it

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other way is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF that</font>

57
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,610
invests in funds or even sub sectors of

58
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the SmallCap market so there are a</font>

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,450
couple ways that investors are taking

60
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,400
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the SmallCap universe so</font>

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
how are you positioning this portfolio

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,159
going into 2010 have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed your</font>

63
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas from this year to what what's</font>

64
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,359
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next year yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

65
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,900
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we are in a mode I</font>

66
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,310
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the hedge funds do play</font>

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,989
a lot in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small cap universe and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

68
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,810
think the the the leadership of the

69
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,370
market certainly has been technology

70
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,609
this year but I wouldn't doubt there may

71
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:52,639
be kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> control alt delete</font>

72
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,389
environment when we start the new year

73
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,120
where leadership everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete reset</font>

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,829
everyone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

75
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:02,129
know the you know the back from the

76
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,109
ashes is done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what and you know what</font>

77
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,430
are we going to see in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year so</font>

78
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,109
we're being fairly diversified kind of

79
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:08,489
barbell like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we have some health</font>

80
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">care have some technology have some</font>

81
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,299
companies that are high flyers and we

82
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:13,439
have some companies that have some

83
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,599
steady Eddie very visible earning

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,989
streams or maybe benefiting from the

85
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,030
stimulus so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> were kind of doing a</font>

86
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,709
little barbell approach right now right

87
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,530
feeling out the waters yep you had

88
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,000
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hedge funds like to play</font>

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,250
the small<font color="#E5E5E5"> cap names obviously with the</font>

90
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,220
Galleon incident earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year is</font>

91
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,769
there easier access to management on

92
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,389
these smaller cap names it seems like

93
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,889
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do more road shows or</font>

94
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,359
more marketing just to get their story

95
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,400
out there are they more accessible I

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,220
think they're more accessible and also

97
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,810
you know if i get if someone calls to

98
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,290
try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CEO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of GE yeah</font>

99
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,659
odds are getting through on to write but

100
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,040
I mean there's many companies in our

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,780
portfolio I'll call the number and the

102
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,030
CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers or maybe his assistant</font>

103
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,620
answer but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do get you have much</font>

104
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,209
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the management teams</font>

105
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,680
and that's important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,090
management teams are so much more

107
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,040
important to the success of a small

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,209
company unlike GE I mean ml ml can alter

109
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,970
a little bit the trajectory but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

110
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">cap you're going to have a bad</font>

111
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,639
management team can make a company go

112
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,108
away so it is very important and

113
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,668
unfortunately we get quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

114
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:18,870
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the management team it's</font>

115
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,608
important part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our strategy great</font>

116
00:04:20,608 --> 00:00:00,000
thanks
