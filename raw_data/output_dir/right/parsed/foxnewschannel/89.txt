>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTING TO
COLUMNIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI WAS
KILLED IN A FISTFIGHT.
THE EXPLANATION IS WITH
WIDESPREAD DEBATE ON HOW THE
U.S. SHOULD RESPOND.
ESPECIALLY SINCE SAUDI ARABIA IS
A IMPORTANT MIDDLE EAST ALLY.
GOVERNOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SITS ON
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW.
SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> YOUR REACTION TO THE
EXPLANATION.
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S CREDIBLE
AT ALL.
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO BELIEVE 18
PEOPLE WOULD GO TO TURKEY TO
KILL MR.  KHASHOGGI AND NOBODY
IN THE GOVERNMENT KNOW ABOUT IT.
THIS IS ABUSE OF AUTHORITY.
HE WAS MURDERED IN A CONFLICT.
WE WILL FIND OUT MORE UNLIKE THE
PRESIDENT'S MEASURED RESPONSE.
I LIKE THAT HE CONSULTED WITH
CONGRESS.
THEY ARE AN ALLY AND THEY NEED
US MORE THAN WE NEED THEM.
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT
SENATOR?
>> I WOULD LIKE TO GO AFTER THE
PEOPLE THAT PUT US IN THIS BOX.
THIS IS THE MOST IN YOUR FACE
MOVE BY AN MIDDLE EAST ALLY.
TO CHILL A MAN IN A FOREIGN
COUNTRY.
I WOULD LIKE TO PUNISH THOSE
INVOLVED.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THE
CROWN PRINCE WASN'T INVOLVED.
I DON'T MIND MILITARY SALES BUT
I CONTENT DO BUSINESS WITH THE
CURRENT LEADERSHIP.
>> INITIALLY YOU SAID YOU WANT
NBS OUT.
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T TRAVEL TO
CINCO DE MAYO DIDN'T I
SANCO DE MAYO DIDN'T I
SAUDO DE MAYO DIDN'T I
SAUDI DE MAYO DIDN'T I
SAUDI AE MAYO DIDN'T I
SAUDI ARAMAYO DIDN'T I
SAUDI ARABIYO DIDN'T I
SAUDI ARABIAO DIDN'T I
SAUDI ARABIA UDIDN'T I
SAUDI ARABIA UNTDN'T I
SAUDI ARABIA UNTIL'T I
SAUDI ARABIA UNTIL T I
SAUDI ARABIA UNTIL THERE IS A
CHANGE THERE.
THIS MAN TEAMED UP WITH THE
UNITED STATES TO HAVE A UNIFIED
FRONT.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THEM YOU
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IRAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
>> SAUDI ARABIA IS THE NATIONAL
ENEMY OF IRAN.
THEY TALK ABOUT REFORMING THE
COUNTRY IN THE WAY ALIKE.
I NEVER FELT MORE USED.
HE EMBARGOED THE COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE HE IS RESPONSIBLE.
THIS IS WAY OUTSIDE THE
CIVILIZED NORMS.
I'LL NEVER GO BACK.
YOU WILL NEVER CONVINCE ME HE
DIDN'T DO THIS AND OUR VALUES
SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING.
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH
THE PRESIDENT TO FIND A SOLUTION
WITH THIS.
>> ARE WE SURPRISED THIS
BRUTALITY CAME OUT OF SAUDI
ARABIA.
THIS COUNTRY HAD 15 OUT OF THE
19 HIJACKERS?
>> YEAH, I'M SURPRISED.
I'M SURPRISED A COUNTRY THAT
CALLS HIMSELF AN ALLY OF THE
UNITED STATES.
IT SHOWS COMPLETE CONTENT FOR
OUR VALUE OR THIS IS NOT
INFORMING SAUDI ARABIA.
THEY WILL CUT UP SAUDI ARABIA AS
AN ALLY.
THIS BEHAVIOR IS OUTSIDE THE
NORM TO THE POINT THAT THE
PEOPLE INVOLVED NEED TO BE
REMOVED IN MY VIEW.
SAUDI ARABIA IS A COUNTRY AND
MBS IS A PERSON.
I'M WILLING TO SEPARATE THE TWO.
I WOULDN'T ACCEPT THIS.
IF WE ACCEPT THIS EVERY OTHER
PERSON WHO COULD DO THIS WILL.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW OUR ENEMIES
WILL LOSE RESPECT FOR US.
>> BOTTOM LINE HERE, THERE IS AN
ARMS DEAL ON THE TABLE.
$100 BILLION WORTH OF ARMED
SALES.
SHOULD THE U.S. GO THROUGH WITH
THAT?
>> I'M OKAY GOING THROUGH THE
DEAL IF THEY SHOW THEY ARE GOING
TO CHANGE.
THE PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE IN A
FASHION CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
HAPPENED HERE.
I'M NOT DOING BUSINESS UNLESS
THEY CHANGE.
MY BEEF IS NOT WITH SAUDI ARABIA
THE COUNTRY BUT THE LEADER
TAKING THE LAW IN HIS OWN HANDS
SHOWING NOTHING BUT CONTENT IN
HIS RELATIONSHIP AND ACTING IN A
BARBARIC FASHION.
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ARM
SALES WITH REGARD TO RUSSIA.
THE U.S. WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE
TREATY WITH RUSSIA.
YOUR THOUGHTS, RIGHT MOVE?
>> ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT MOVE.
THEY HAVE BEEN COMMITTING.
THE CHINESE ARE BUILDING UP
THEIR MISSILES.
I LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP BEING
TOUGH.
HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE IRAN
DEAL BECAUSE IT WAS A JOKE OF A
DEAL.
OBAMA TRIED TO IGNORE THE
IRANIANS.
I DON'T WANT TO IGNORE AND
APIECE THE SAUDIS.
THE MIDDLE EAST NEEDS TO BE
CHANGED.
THE RUSSIANS NEVER HONORED THEIR
BARGAIN.
>> THERE IS THE OTHER NUCLEAR
POWER WHICH IS NORTH KOREA.
WHAT DO WE KNOW HERE IN TERMS OF
THE PRESIDENT'S UPCOMING MEETING
IN CHINA AT THE G 20.
CHINA IS CRITICAL TO THAT
RELATIONSHIP.
WHAT CAN YOU DELL US ABOUT THAT
RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW?
>> WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO
NORTH KOREA IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE
OF DONALD TRUMP'S STRAIGHT.
HE COULD THEM WE WON'T LET YOU
BUILD A WEAPON TO HIT AMERICA.
WE HAVE A DIALOG WITH NORTH
KOREA THAT'S HOPEFUL.
IT'S DUE TO THE PRESIDENT BEING
STRONG.
THEY BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP
WILL USE HIS MILITARY FORCE.
CHINA NEEDS TO HELP US.
I'M PLEASED WITH WHAT TRUMP HAS
DONE.
>>Reporter: CHINA HAS ALSO
BEEN HELPFUL THERE.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE IN TERMS OF
THIS FIGHT WITH CHINA.
THIS CAN GO ON FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU ARE DEALING WITH A DICTATOR.
CHINA STEALS INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY THEY STEAL YOUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PUSH BACK AND
TRUMP IS DOING IT.
I DON'T LIKE TARIFFS BUT THEY
ARE A TOOL TO GET CHINA TO
CHANGE.
THEIR ECONOMY IS WEAKER THAN
HOURS.
WAFFLED A STRONG LEADER IN THIS
WORLD.
I'M TIRED OF WEAK.
>> THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA
IS CRITICAL THE LARGEST
ECONOMIES ARE TRYING TO BE
NUMBER ONE THIS IS MORE THEN
JUST ECONOMIC.
THIS IS VICE PRESIDENT PENCE A
FEW WEEKS AGO.
>> AS WE SPEAK BEIJING HAS A
WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE.
THEY ARE EMPLOYING THE POWER IN
MORE PROACTIVE WAYS TO INTEGER
IN THE
INTEHE
INTEGER -- INTERFERE IN THE
DOMESTIC POLICIES AND POLICIES
OF THE UNITED STATES.
THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IS
AWARDING OR BACKING MOVIE
THEATERS, THINK TANKS, LOCAL AND
STATE OFFICIALS.
WORSE OF ALL CHINA HAS INITIATED
AN EFFORT TO INFLUENCE AMERICAN
PUBLIC APPEARANCE.
THE 2018 ELECTIONS, AND THE
ENVIRONMENT LEADING INTO THE
2020 ELECTIONS.
>> WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
CHINA WANT ADMIT WHAT THEY ARE
DOING.
THEY CREATE ISLANDS AND PUT
MILITARY BASES ON THEM.
WHAT DO WE DO?
>> THANK GOD FOR DONALD TRUMP
AND MIKE PENCE.
WE TELL THE TRUTH.
WE STAND-UP TO CHINA.
THEY ARE BUILDING ISLANDS
OVERLAND WE ARE A STRONGER
ECONOMY.
WE NEED TO WRITE RULES THAT
RECOGNIZE CHINA IS A DEVELOPED
NATION AND NOT DEVELOPING
NATION.
MIKE PENCE IS RIGHT.
WHEN WE STAND-UP FOR OUR VALUES
AND ENEMIES WE ARE BETTER OFF
THEN WHEN WE IGNORE THE PROBLEM.
I HAD EIGHT YEARS OF IGNORING
THE PROBLEM UNDER OBAMA.
IT'S TIME FOR SOMEONE SHOULD
TAKE
>>> SENATOR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CHINA.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CARAVAN
HEADED TO THE UNITED STATES FROM
GUATEMALA.
THE NUMBERS ARE INCREDIBLE.
4,000 PLUS PEOPLE CLAIMING
AMNESTY.
WHAT SHOULD THE U.S. DO?
GET MEXICO TO STOP THEM BEFORE
THEY GET TO THE UNITED STATES.
HAVE MEXICO WORK WITH THE UNITED
NATIONS AND UNITED STATES TO
DEAL WITH REFUGEES BEFORE THEY
GET TO OUR BORDERS.
I APPRECIATE THEM UPPING THEIR
GAME.
TRUMP IS TOUGH.
MEXICO IS LISTENING TO TRUMP.
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO
TOUGHNESS.
THESE CARAVANS NEED TO BE
STOPPED IN MEXICO.
I'LL BE PRACTICAL WITH ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN HERE
FOR DECADES.
I WOULDN'T TOLL MATE ANYMORE --T
I WOULDN'T TOLL MATE ANYMORE --L
I WOULDN'T TOLL MATE ANYMORE --R
I WOULDN'T TOLL MATE ANYMORE --T
I WOULDN'T TOLL MATE ANYMORE --E
ANYMORE COMING THROUGH.
WE NEED TO WORK WITH THEM AND
THE PRESIDENT IS.
>> WELL, LOOK, YOUR COLLEAGUE ON
THE HOUSE IS BRINGING A BILL TO
THE FLOOR TO FUND THE
PRESIDENT'S BORDER WALL.
HE'S PRETTY CONFIDENT HE WILL
PASS THE HOUSE, WHAT ABOUT THE
SENATE?
>> WE NEED $5 BILLION FOR THE
WALL.
THE SENATE NEEDS A BILLION AND
HALF.
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE DACA
PROBLEM.
THEY HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE THEY
WERE SIX YEARS OLD.
WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR LAWS.
IF YOU BRING YOUR KIDS THERE THE
WHOLE FAMILY GOOD EATS DEPORTED.
SOMEHOW THEY GET A BETTER DEAL.
MEXICO IS THE KEY.
THE CARAVANS HAVE TO GO THROUGH
MEXICO.
I REALLY APPRECIATE PRESIDENT
TRUMP BEING TOUGH.
WHEN IT COMES TO SAUDI ARABIA WE
NEED THE A -- ALLIANCE BUT NOT
THIS.
WE NEED A BETTER DEAL.
THE WHOLE APPROACH IS PAYING
OFF.
>> HOW IMPORTANT WILL THESE
ISSUES BE DISTURBING THE
ELECTION?
>> ON EVERYTHING.
PEOPLE WILL BE VOTING ON THE MOB
RULE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE DEMOCRATS TO
RUN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
WILL GET.
THEY WILL TRY TO IMPEACH THE
PRESIDENT OR KAVANAUGH.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
WALLET.
THEY JUST WANT TO GET IN YOUR
WALLET.
WE'LL KEEP THE ECONOMY MOVING
FORWARD.
WE'LL DEAL WITH OUR ENEMIES AND
REBUILD OUR MILITARY.
KAVANAUGH WAS A DESPICABLE
EPISODE IN THE HISTORY OF THE
SENATE.
WHEN IT COMES TO STANDING UP WE
NEED A STRONG LEADER LIKE
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SHOWED US
WILLIAMS WOULD DO FOR POWER.
>> THESE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT
ISSUES.
THE PRESIDENT IS HAND CAN
PICKING YOU TO GO OUT AND
CAMPAIGN FOR SOME OF YOUR
COLLEAGUES.
TELL US ABOUT THAT AND WHAT YOU
ARE PLANNING.
YOU WILL CAMPAIGN IN ALIZADE,
CALIFORNIA, MISSOURI, MONTANA,
AND NORTH CAROLINA.
>> RIGHT, 13 STATES IN 12 DAYS
WITH A SIMPLE MASSAGE.
I'LL WILL THE EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN CHARGE OF
THE CONGRESS.
YOU ARE UNDERCUTTING THE RULE OF
LAW.
DON'T GIVE THEM POWER.
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO TO
MAKE SURE KAVANAUGH DOESN'T
HAPPEN AGAIN IS PUNISH THEM FOR
WHAT THEY DID TO THIS GOODMAN.
GOOD MAN.
TWO WEEKS WE CAN DECIDE WHAT
COUNTRY WAS GOOD.
IF YOU WANT DELIVER FOR WORKING
FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT WILL PUT
GOOD JUDGES ON THE COURT.
THEY WILL STAND-UP TO THE
ENEMIES OF THE COUNTRY.
THEY WILL WELCOME THE CARAVANS
HERE.
DONALD TRUMP AND THE REST OF US
WILL STOP THEM.
>> THIS MOB LIKE ACTIVITY TOOK
PLACE THIS WEEKEND.
ELAINE GOT HARASSED AT A
RESTAURANT.
DOES THE PRESIDENT NEED TO SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
HE'S CRITICIZED ON THE LEFT FOR
THE BODY SLAM COMMENT.
>> NAME ONE DEMOCRAT WHO SAID
IT'S WRONG FOR THE MOB TO CHASE
US AROUND?
NAME ONE DEMOCRATIC LEADER THAT
STOOD UP TO THE THUGS.
I'M PROUD OF MY COLLEAGUES.
THEY STOOD IN THEIR AND WEREN'T
OVER RUN BY THE MUGS.
HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
IF YOU TAKE ME ON IT'S MOST OF
THE STATE.
I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT TO HAPPEN.
>> YOU ARE VOTING FOR THE AGENDA
TO CONTINUE.
WE ARE WORKING ON A NEW TAX CUD
FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THE
MIDDLE-CLASS.
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?
WILL SOMETHING LIKE THAT PASS
THE SENATE.
>> WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE TAX
CUTS PERMANENT.
THE MORE WE CAN GET IT DONE.
WE DID A LOT WITH 51.
WE DEREGULATED THE COUNTRY.
HER GREAT CONSERVATIVE IF WE
HAVE THREE OR FOUR MORE WE COULD
DO A LOT IN THE SENATE.
WE WANT TO REBUILD THE MILITARY
AND ASK OUR FRIENDS TO RESPECT
OUR VALUES AND IF YOU CAN'T
RESPECT OUR VALUES YOU ARE NOT
OUR FRIEND.
I LIKE WHERE THE COUNTRY IS
HEADED.
HERE IS THE QUESTION ON NOVEMBER
6th.
WE WANT TO CHANGE DIRECTION FOR
WHERE WE ARE GOING.
WE WANT TO TURN OUR GROUP INTO
MOB RULE PEOPLE, NOT ME.
>> HIS INVESTIGATION INTO HOW
THE TRUMP COLLUSION
INVESTIGATION WAS HANDLED AND
HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL
INVESTIGATION WAS HANDLED.
YOU HAVE ROD ROSENSTEIN SITTING
DOWN WITH THE JUDICIARY AND
DOING A TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEW.
IT SCHEMES LIKE ROD IS PUTTING
THE GROUND RULES IN PLACE ABOUT
WHO SHOULD BE THERE AND WHO
SHOULDN'T.
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH HOW
THIS IS GOING?
>> NOT REALLY, I WANT THE HOUSE
TO KEEP DOING WHAT THEY ARE
DOING.
SO, I LIKE WHAT GOODLATTE AND
THOSE GUYS ARE DUOING. DOING.
MUELLER WILL WRAP HIS THINGS UP.
>> THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST SIMPLE
CHOICE YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN
YOUR LIFE IF YOU ARE A VOTER.
>> I UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN WHERE IS THE
ACCOUNTABILITY.
WILL THERE EVER BE
ACCOUNTABILITY.
YOU HAVE NELLY SAYING SHE WILL
HIDE BEHIND SOME PRIORITY.
WILL WE GET TO THE BO THE TOM OF
THIS OR IF THE HOUSE FLIP WE
DON'T HERE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT
THE INVESTIGATION?
>> THE HOUSE PROMISES TO IMPEACH
THE PRESIDENT AND KAVANAUGH.
THEY WILL HOLD THE FBI AND
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
ACCOUNTABLE.
I PROMISE YOU.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FUSION
PROBLEM.
WE'LL GET TO THE BOB WITH HOW
THEY GET A WARRANT FOR AMERICAN
CITIZENS.
WE WON'T TURN OUR BACK ON THIS.
THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO BE
CHAIRMAN IS FOR US TO HOLD THE
SENATE.
>> WILL YOU DECLASSIFY SOME OF
THE DOCUMENTS.
WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT BE
CLASSIFIED?
SHOULD THE MUELLER REPORT BE
PUBLIC?
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T
DEP DIES
DEPUDIES
DEPUTIES
DEPUTIZE THIS.
WE WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY
WILL UNDERCUT TRUMP.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE WARRANT
WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THEM.
PAID FOR BY THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW THAT
HAPPENED.
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
