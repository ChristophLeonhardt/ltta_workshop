1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:01,100
GEORGE.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,969
AGAIN, THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL 

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:03,736
PROSECUTOR IN THAT THERE WERE 18

4
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:05,405
COUNTS THAT THIS MAN FACED.

5
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,907
HE'S NOW GOING TO HAVE JAIL TIME

6
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:13,312
ON AT LEAST EIGHT OF THOSE 

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,579
COUNTIES. 

8
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:14,447
>> PIERRE THOMAS TALKS ABOUT THE

9
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,181
POWER OF THE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR,

10
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,416
NOT A COMPLETE GRAND SLAM HOME 

11
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,185
RUN FOR THE PROSECUTORS BUT 

12
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,087
GUILTY ON EIGHT COUNTS, 

13
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,823
SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO PAUL 

14
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,692
MANAFORT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP.

15
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,260
>> Reporter: IT IS A SIGNIFICANT

16
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:27,960
DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY FOR 

17
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,329
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER.

18
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,063
THIS IS THE FIRST TEST BEFORE A 

19
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,465
JURY OF HIS INVESTIGATION AND IT

20
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:37,670
IS A PARTIAL SUCCESS ON THOSE 

21
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,271
TAX CRIMES THAT PAUL MANAFORT 

22
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,839
HAS JUST BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF 

23
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,006
AND BANK FRAUD AND THE FAILURE 

24
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:42,875
TO FILE OWNERSHIP OF A FOREIGN 

25
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,211
BANK ACCOUNT OR FOREIGN ASSET.

26
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,879
BUT THIS IS ALSO THE POWER OF 

27
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,580
THE JURY SYSTEM.

28
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,384
THEY WERE GIVEN A VERY DENSE, 

29
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,353
VERY DIFFICULT DOCUMENT-DRIVEN 

30
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:53,820
CASE.

31
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,154
THEY SORTED THROUGH IT, CAME TO 

32
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,656
AN AGREEMENT ON THE 

33
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,158
PROSECUTION'S STRONGEST CASE.

34
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,025
I'VE TALKED TO DEFENSE LAWYERS 

35
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,862
WHO DID THINK THAT THOSE CRIMES 

36
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,864
WERE PRETTY STRONG CASES FOR THE

37
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,164
PROSECUTION.

38
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:08,634
THESE OTHER ONES THOUGH THE JURY

39
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:08,901
THREW OUT.

40
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,336
SO HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THIS 

41
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,004
HAS POLITICALLY, IT PROBABLY 

42
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,606
DOES STRENGTHEN SPECIAL COUNSEL 

43
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,841
ROBERT MUELLER'S HAND.

44
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,775
HE DOES HAVE A VICTORY BUT IT 

45
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,278
ALSO SHOWS THAT THE JURY IN THIS

46
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,079
CASE SHUT ALL THAT OUT AND THEY 

47
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,714
WENT METHODICALLY THROUGH THE 

48
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:22,182
EVIDENCE.

49
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,416
THEY CAME TO THE AGREEMENTS THEY

50
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,151
COULD AND PUNTED ON THE REST. 

51
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,085
>> OF COURSE PAUL MANAFORT ALSO 

52
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,355
NOW FACES A SECOND TRIAL IN 

53
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,523
WASHINGTON D.C. ON SEVERAL 

54
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,092
CHARGES INCLUDING LYING TO THE 

55
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,893
FBI, CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE 

56
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,295
UNITED STATES, WITNESS 

57
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:35,562
TAMPERING.

58
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,796
SO HE IS FACING EVEN MORE LEGAL 

59
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,764
TROUBLE GOING FORWARD.

60
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,801
I WANT TO BRING IN CRHRIS 

61
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,035
CHRISTIE WHO WORKED WITH 

62
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,670
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS AN OUTSIDE 

63
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,005
ADVISER AFTER PAUL MANAFORT WAS 

64
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:46,272
CHAIRMAN.

65
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,474
CHRIS CHRISTIE, NONE OF THESE 

66
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,443
CHARGES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

67
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,246
HIS CAMPAIGN WORK FOR PRESIDENT 

68
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,047
TRUMP, PAUL MANAFORT'S CAMPAIGN 

69
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,848
WORK FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT 

70
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:56,716
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS RECENTLY AS 

71
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,917
FRIDAY CALLED OUT THIS 

72
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,018
INVESTIGATION, CALLED OUT THIS 

73
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,588
TRIAL AND CALLED PAUL MANAFORT A

74
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,689
GOOD MAN.

75
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,325
>> YEAH, LISTEN, GEORGE, ONE, 

76
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,260
THIS PART NEVER INVOLVES THE 

77
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,595
CAMPAIGN BUT THE IMPORTANT THING

78
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,363
IS THIS IS A MIXED BAG FOR THIS 

79
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,197
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

80
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,798
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTS, AT 

81
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:17,536
LEAST AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE 

82
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:18,471
GUILTY VERDICT HAD VERY LITTLE 

83
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,606
TO DO WITH GATES.

84
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,208
THE ONES THAT THE JURY HUNG ON 

85
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,244
WERE MUCH MORE DEPENDENT ON 

86
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,111
GATES' TESTIMONY. 

87
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,047
>> GATES WAS THE FORMER DEPUTY 

88
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,282
CAMPAIGN CHAIR, WORKED -- 

89
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,653
LONG-TIME COLLEAGUE OF PAUL 

90
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,187
MANAFORT WHO WAS ORIGINALLY 

91
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:35,821
CHARGED WITH PAUL MANAFORT BUT 

92
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,422
THEN TOOK A PLEA AND WAS THE 

93
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,089
COOPERATING WITNESS AGAINST HIM.

94
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:38,925
>> HE WAS THE MAIN VERBAL 

95
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,260
WITNESS, NONDOCUMENT WITNESS.

96
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,493
NOW, THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR 

97
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,195
THE NEXT TRIAL BECAUSE THE NEXT 

98
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,298
TRIAL I THINK WILL BE MUCH MORE 

99
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,601
DEPENDENT UPON RICK GATES THAN 

100
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,502
EVEN THE FIRST TRIAL WAS, 

101
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:49,735
GEORGE.

102
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,170
SO I THINK IF YOU'RE IN THE 

103
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,870
MUELLER TEAM YOU'RE HAPPY 

104
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,573
BECAUSE THIS IS A WIN.

105
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,675
THIS IS A WIN AND IT JUSTIFIES 

106
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,742
YOUR PROSECUTION BUT I THINK -- 

107
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,978
>> THAT MAY BE TRUE, CHRIS, BUT 

108
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,613
LET ME INTERRUPT YOU RIGHT 

109
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,414
THERE.

110
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,548
MUELLER'S TEAM IS SAYING THEY 

111
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,417
HAVE FAR MORE DOCUMENTS FOR THE 

112
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,686
SECOND TRIAL THAN THEY HAD FOR 

113
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:08,454
THE FIRST TRIAL. 

114
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,589
>> THEY MAY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

115
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,691
THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE SECOND 

116
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,259
TRIAL TO TELL REALLY THAT TO A 

117
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,560
JURY THEY'RE GOING TO NEED GATES

118
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,631
TO BE A NARRATER TO NARRATE THEM

119
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,498
THROUGH THAT IN ADDITION TO THE 

120
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,167
FBI AGENTS.

121
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,535
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A TIME 

122
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,870
WHERE MUELLER IS GOING TO LOOK 

123
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,805
BACK ON HOW THEY TRIED THIS 

124
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,341
CASE, HOW WELL THEY PREPARED 

125
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,241
GATES AND WHAT KIND OF WITNESS 

126
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:29,742
GATES IS. 

127
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,878
>> WE'RE SEEING RICK GATES THERE

128
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,578
BEHIND PAUL MANAFORT ON THE 

129
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:32,812
SCREEN.

130
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,681
HE'S THE MAN IN THE CIRCLE RIGHT

131
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:34,881
THERE.

132
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,750
ANOTHER QUESTION ON THIS, CHRIS 

133
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,784
CHRISTIE, ONE OF THE BIG 

134
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,753
QUESTIONS IS WAS THIS ALL AN 

135
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,722
ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE PAUL 

136
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,523
MANAFORT TO GIVE INFORMATION ON 

137
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,825
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

138
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,261
HE'S WITHSTOOD THAT SO FAR.

139
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,962
DOES THIS GIVE ANOTHER OPENING 

140
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:52,131
TO PROSECUTORS, OR IS THAT JUST 

141
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,465
GONE?

142
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,434
>> LISTEN, THERE'S ALWAYS AN 

143
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,601
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT WHEN YOU'VE

144
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,836
GOT A SECOND TRIAL THAT YOU'RE 

145
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,104
GETTING READY FOR AND MORE 

146
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,173
CHARGES FOR THEM TO FACE AND NOW

147
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,741
HE HAS THE CERTAINTY OF FACING 

148
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,110
SOME JAIL TIME.

149
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,714
SO NOW IT'S ALL IN AN EVEN MORE 

150
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,614
COMPLETE CONTEXT FOR MANAFORT, 

151
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,718
BUT I WOULD TELL YOU, GEORGE, I 

152
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,885
THINK IF HE HASN'T COOPERATED AT

153
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,519
THIS POINT HE'S PROBABLY NOT 

154
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,253
GOING TO.

155
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,555
THAT COULD MEAN ONE OF TWO 

156
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,856
THINGS, EITHER HE DOESN'T CARE 

157
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,591
TO COOPERATE OR HE'S GOT NOTHING

158
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,524
TO COOPERATE WITH. 

159
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:21,694
>> PIERRE THOMAS, JUSTICE 

160
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,796
CORRESPONDENT, BEFORE WE GO, A 

161
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,897
MISTRIAL ON TEN COUNTS.

162
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,432
PROSECUTORS WILL NOW ALSO FACE 

163
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,234
THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO TRY TO 

164
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:34,874
RETRY ON THOSE CHARGES.

165
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,609
>> GEORGE I THINK ONE OF THE 

166
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:41,981
THINGS WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN IS A

167
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,483
ASIDE FROM THIS.

168
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,017
PAUL MANAFORT WITH HIS EIGHT 

169
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,819
CONVICTIONS HE'S FACING YEARS IN

170
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,388
JAIL.

171
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:48,721
YEARS IN JAIL.

172
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,989
THAT IS THE SITUATION FOR HIM.

173
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,424
HE WON'T BE OUT IN THE PUBLIC 

174
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,593
ANY TIME SOON AND HE'S GOT TRIAL

175
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,261
AHEAD BUT HE'S NOW LOOKING AT 

176
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,095
CONVICTIONS THAT WOULD LAND HIM 

177
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,429
IN JAIL FOR YEARS. 

178
00:04:57,429 --> 00:05:01,167
>> AND CELIA VEGA AT THE WHITE 

179
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:01,367
HOUSE.

180
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,368
THE PRESIDENT CALLED PAUL 

181
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,337
MANAFORT A GOOD MAN ON FRIDAY AS

182
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,740
HE WAS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE 

183
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,341
MUELLER INVESTIGATION BUT THE 

184
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,742
WHITE HOUSE HAS HAD CONFLICTS 

185
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,811
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT PAUL 

186
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:13,078
MANAFORT.

187
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,047
AT FIRST TRIED TO PUSH HIM OFF 

188
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,716
AS SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A LOT

189
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,484
TO DO WITH THE CAMPAIGN EVEN 

190
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,786
THOUGH HE WAS THE CHAIR. 

191
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,255
>> A SMALL PLAYER.

192
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,257
RIGHT AND HE ROSE TO THE RANK OF

193
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,459
MANAGER AND COORDINATED THE ARE 

194
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,493
RUBL NATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE

195
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,227
TEAM.

196
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,329
HE WAS NOT A TWO BIT PLAYER.

197
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,764
AND AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING THE 

198
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,799
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, TRUMP 

199
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,166
HIMSELF WAS NOT A PART OF THIS 

200
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,868
TRIAL BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT 

201
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,570
THIS.

202
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,605
INDIRECTLY THIS WHITE HOUSE IS 

203
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,240
VERY MUCH LINKED TO PAUL 

204
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,975
MANAFORT AND THIS TRIAL TAKING 

205
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,210
PLACE RIGHT NOW.

206
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,212
SURPRISINGLY WE HAVE NOT HEARD A

207
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,213
COMMENT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP OR 

208
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:47,980
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

209
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,816
YET TO HEAR A COMMENT FROM 

210
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,819
ANYONE AFFILIATED WITH THE 

211
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,086
CAMPAIGN.

212
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,820
WE WERE GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS 

213
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,056
ABOUT THIS, ABOUT THE MICHAEL 

214
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,959
COHEN DEAL.

215
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,661
THEY CANCELED HIS SPEECH ON THE 

216
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,797
WHITE HOUSE TODAY.

217
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,399
THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE 

218
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,967
PRESIDENT QUESTIONS TODAY.

219
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,836
THEY SAY IT IS BAD WEATHER.

220
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,836
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE 

221
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,438
BEHIND ME THE SKIES ARE PRETTY 

222
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,441
SUNNY AT THIS POINT.

223
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,208
NO COMMENTS JUST YET. 

224
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:20,012
>> HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIR 

225
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,614
PAUL MANAFORT FOUND GUILTY ON 

226
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,050
EIGHT ACCOUNTS OF THE TAX 

227
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,283
EVASION.

228
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,752
FAILING TO FIRE FOREIGN BANK 

229
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:27,019
ACCOUNTS.

230
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,455
BANK FRAUD AND BANK CONSPIRACY.

231
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,691
MISTRIAL ON 10 OTHER COUNTS.

232
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,659
OPEN QUESTION WHETHER 

233
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,193
PROSECUTORS ARE GOING TO 

234
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,231
CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT.

235
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,632
PAUL MANAFORT FACES A HOST OF 

236
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,466
OTHER CHARGES AS WELL AND COMES 

237
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:47,540
ON A DAY THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER 

238
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,809
ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN HAS PLED 

239
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,111
GUILTY TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

240
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,746
CHARGES DEALING WITH THE 2016 

241
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,781
CAMPAIGN AND TAX EVASION AND 

242
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:56,081
BANK FRAUD.

243
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:59,351
AND EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM THE 

244
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,119
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY PROSECUTING 

245
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,920

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,688
AND WE'LL BACK ON AIR TONIGHT

NEWS TONIGHT.

249
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,415
>>> THAT'S THE HEADLINE OUT OF 

250
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:52,850
THIS PROCEEDING THAT HE DID THIS

251
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,021
QUOTE AT THE DIRECTION OF THE 

252
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,288
CANDIDATE.

253
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,256
THIS IS BOTH KAREN McDOUGAL AND 

254
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:00,257
STORMY DANIELS WITH AND AT THE 

255
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,593
DIRECTION OF THE SAME CANDIDATE,

256
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:03,294
OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT 

257
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:03,861
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

258
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,163
A WILD SCENE OUTSIDE OF COURT 

259
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,765
JUST NOW.

260
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,166
MICHAEL COHEN JUST LEFT AS 

261
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,669
PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING AT HIM AT 

262
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,639
THE UP THE OF THEIR LUNGS, "LOCK

263
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,841
HIM UP" CURSING AT HIM.

264
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,176
MICHAEL COHEN CAME IN THROUGH A 

265
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:19,510
SIDE ENTRANCE.

266
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,711
HE WAS PROTECTED IF YOU WILL BY 

267
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,514
THE POLICE AND FBI AS HE CAME 

268
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:23,681
IN.

269
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,182
GOT INSIDE.

270
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,083
HE WAS WEARING A DARK SUIT.

271
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,150
A YELLOW TIE.

272
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,118
HE WINKED AT ONE REPORTER.

273
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,387
HE WAS ASKED AT ONE POINT SINCE 

274
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,855
HE WAS PLEADING GUILTY IF HE WAS

275
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,323
UNDER ANY MEDICATION.

276
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,225
BY ANY CHANCE IF HE WAS 

277
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:34,525
INTOXICATED.

278
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:38,529
HE SAID ONLY HE HAD A DRINK LAST

279
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:38,930
NIGHT.

280
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,865
BUT IT GIVES YOU A SENSE WHAT 

281
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,467
WAS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD.

282
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,635
FOUR TAYS FROM HIS 52th BIRTHDAY

283
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:46,471
SO A ROUGH WEEK FOR HIM 

284
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:46,771
DEFINITELY.

285
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:50,041
AND THE MAX HE COULD FACE WOULD 

286
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:50,341
BE 65 YEARS.

287
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,710
THAT IS A MAXIMUM PRISON TIME.

288
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,778
SENTENCING IS DECEMBER 12th BUT 

289
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,714
HE DID WALK OUT ON A $500,000 

290
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:56,914
BOND. 

291
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,916
>> AND NO MENTION OF A 

292
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,985
COOPERATION AGREEMENT INSIDE THE

293
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,586
COURTHOUSE BUT THAT DOESN'T 

294
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,588
PRECLUDE HIS COOPERATION PERHAPS

295
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,223
WITH INVESTIGATORS GOING 

296
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:06,591
FORWARD.

297
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,959
>> THAT IS ININCREDIBLY 

298
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:09,560
IMPORTANT POINT.

299
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,261
THERE'S NO COOPERATION.

300
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:16,200
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO COOPERATE 

301
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,834
WITH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES BUT THE

302
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,501
PLEA DEAL DOESN'T PREVENT THAT 

303
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:20,638
IN THE FUTURE SO THAT VERY WELL 

304
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,038
COULD HAPPEN. 

305
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,610
>> PLEADING GUILTY.

306
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,945
FACING SOME COUNTS HAVING TO DO 

307
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:28,746
WITH HIS PERSONAL BUSINESS THERE

308
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,382
BUT DAN THE REAL NEWS HERE.

309
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,885
THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE PLEAS, 

310
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:36,187
ILLEGAL CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION.

311
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:36,887
EXCESSIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION 

312
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:38,656
AT THE DIRECTION OF THEED CAN 

313
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,023
FOR PRESIDENT. 

314
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,558
>> RIGHT.

315
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,294
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE IT OUT 

316
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,328
BECAUSE THE ONES WITH REGARD TO 

317
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:45,930
TAX FRAUD AND BANK FRAUD THAT IS

318
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,031
RELATED TO HIM PERSONALLY.

319
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,167
THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT ISSUE 

320
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,135
THAN WHEN HE'S SAYING I WAS 

321
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,671
DIRECTED TO DO SOMETHING BY THE 

322
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,171
PERSON THAT IS CLEARLY 

323
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:54,705
PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.

324
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,741
SO IN ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENT WE'D

325
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,542
BE SAYING WELL THE NEXT PERSON 

326
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,345
TO BE CHARGED HERE, LIKELY COULD

327
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,179
BE DONALD TRUMP.

328
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,713
BUT BECAUSE AS WE TALKED ABOUT 

329
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,882
MANY TIMES BEFORE IT IS UNLIKELY

330
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,285
THAT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL OR 

331
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:12,356
ANYONE WILL SEEK TO DIET A 

332
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:12,856
SIT

333
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:15,660
INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT.

334
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,861
BUT REGARDLESS MICHAEL COHEN IS 

335
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,162
MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE WAS

336
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,231
DIRECTED TO DO THIS BY THE 

337
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,833
PRESIDENT, WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES 

338
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,103
THE PRESIDENT'S CULPABILITY HERE

339
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,171
IF IT IS TRUE MORE SIGNIFICANT 

340
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,773
THAN MICHAEL COHEN WHO IS SIMPLY

341
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,207
SAYING I EXECUTED ON HIS ORDER. 

342
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,742
>> AND I WANT TO BRICK IN CHRIS 

343
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,844
CHRISTIE AS WELL.

344
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,212
ANOTHER FORMER PROSECUTOR.

345
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,346
CHRIS, THE QUESTION WOULD BE 

346
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,348
WHAT KIND OF DOCUMENTS OR OTHER 

347
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,149
EVIDENCE WOULD THE PROSECUTORS 

348
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,784
BE ABLE TO SHOW DO BACK UP THAT 

349
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:50,161
CONTENTION FROM MICHAEL COHEN?

350
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:54,331
LET ME GO TO CECELIA VAGUE GAT 

351
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:57,168
THE WHITE HOUSE.

352
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,969
THESE CLAIMS RUN RIGHT IN THE 

353
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:00,504
FACE OF PERSISTENT DENIALS WE 

354
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:02,339
SAW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FROM 

355
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,642
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AIDES OF ANY 

356
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,043
KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING HAVING TO 

357
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,978
WITH THE PAYMENTS TO STORMY 

358
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:11,782
DANIELS OR KAREN McDOUGAL AT 

359
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:12,449
LEAST INITIALLY. 

360
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,119
>> EXACTLY AND IS EXPLANATIONS 

361
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,154
HAVE BEEN HEAD SPINNING FROM THE

362
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,286
CAMPAIGN TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO 

363
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:18,621
THE TRUMP LEGAL TEAM AND REALLY 

364
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:19,723
WHAT PUT THIS ADMINISTRATION 

365
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:21,259
FACING SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF A 

366
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,360
CRISIS OF CREDIBILITY, GEORGE.

367
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,995
INITIALLY MICHAEL COHEN SAID 

368
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,362
THIS MONEY CAME FROM HIS 

369
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:26,063
PERSONAL FUND.

370
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,533
THEN WE ALL REMEMBER THAT SCENE 

371
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,934
ON AIR FORCE ONE WHERE THE 

372
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,034
PRESIDENT DENIED KNOWING 

373

ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAYMENTS TO

00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:36,206
SPIRALLED OUT OF CONTROL FROM 

376

PRESIDENT'S LAWYER ADMITTED THAT

378
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,077
THE PRESIDENT IN FACT DID USE 

379
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,213

380
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,880

ESSENTIALLY TO SAVE HIS MARRIAGE

384
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,356
NOT BECAUSE HE WAS ADMITTING ANY

385
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,090
WRONG DOING.

386
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,991

387
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:54,358
CASE.

388
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,494

00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:33,484
HAD HE BEEN CANDID AND HONEST.

461
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,585

ONE FOR CAUSING AN UNLAWFUL 

465
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,126
CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION, AND A 

466
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,328
SECOND ONE FOR PERSONALLY MAKING

467
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,464
AN EXCESSIVE PERSONAL

00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:54,605
PURPOSE OF INFLUENCING THE 2016 

470
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,272
ELECTION.

471
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,741
IN ADDITION WHAT HE DID WAS 

472
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:58,375
WORKED TO PAY MONEY TO SILENCE 

473
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,778
TWO WOMEN WHO HAD INFORMATION HE

474
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,813
BELIEVED WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO

475
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,681
THE 2016 CAMPAIGN AND TO THE 

476
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,852
CANDIDATE AND THE CAMPAIGN.

477
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,389
IN ADDITION MR. COHEN SOUGHT 

478
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,689
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT MONEY BY 

479
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:15,926
SUBMITTING INVOICES TO THE 

480
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,261
CANDIDATE'S COMPANY, WHICH WERE 

481
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,462
UNTRUE AND FALSE.

482
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,698
THEY INDICATED THAT THE 

483
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,001
REIMBURSEMENT WAS FOR SERVICES 

484
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,871
RENDERED FOR THE YEAR 2017, WHEN

485
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,339
IN FACT THOSE INVOICES WERE A 

486
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,039
SHAM.

487
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,007
HE PROVIDED NO LEGAL SERVICES 

488
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:33,144
FOR THE YEAR 2017.

489
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,911
AND IT WAS SIMPLY A MEANS TO 

490
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:36,313
OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE 

491
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,784
UNLAWFUL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.

492
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,686
A COUPLE OF POINTS I'D LIKE TO 

493
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:42,886
MAKE.

494
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,855
FIRST, THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS 

495
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,124
CHARGES AND REFLECT A PATTERN OF

496
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,493
LIES AND DISHONESTY OVER AN 

497
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,327
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

498
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,728
THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT IN THEIR 

499
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:52,496
OWN RIGHT.

500
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,430
THEY ARE PARTICULARLY 

501
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,997
SIGNIFICANT WHEN DONE BY A 

502
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:57,134
LAWYER.

503
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,370
A LAWYER WHO THROUGH TRAINING 

504
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,071
AND TRADITION UNDERSTANDS WHAT 

505
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:04,274
IT MEANS TO BE A LAWYER TO 

506
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:06,477
ENGAGE IN HONEST AND FAIR 

507
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,245
DEALING AND ADHERENCE TO THE 

508
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:08,546
LAW.

509
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,013
MR. COHEN DISREGARDED THAT 

510
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:10,448
TRAINING.

511
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,049
DISREGARDED THAT TRADITION AND 

512
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,383
DECIDED THAT HE WAS ABOVE THE 

513
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:15,719
LAW AND FOR THAT HE'S GOING TO 

514
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:19,857
PAY A VERY VERY SERIOUS PRICE.

515
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,824
WITH RESPECT TO THE CAMPAIGN 

516
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,693
FINANCE VIOLATIONS, THE CAMPAIGN

517
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,527
FINANCE LAWS ARE DESIGNED TO 

518
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:26,864
PREVENT THE USE OF ILLEGAL MONEY

519
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,698
IN ELECTIONS AND TO MAINTAIN THE

520
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,735
INTEGRITY OF THOSE ELECTIONS.

521
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:34,170
MR. COHEN MADE GUILTY PLEAS FOR 

522
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,773
THOSE CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS.

523
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,908
AND THOSE ARE CORE VIOLATIONS.

524
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:45,983
AND WHAT HE DID WAS REMIND US 

525
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,618
THAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR 

526
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,385
CORPORATIONS TO MAKE 

527
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,186
CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES.

528
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,954
AND IT IS ILLEGAL TO MAKE 

529
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:52,756
CONTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS OF THE 

530
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:55,459
AMOUNT THAT CONGRESS SET FOR 

531
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:55,792
INDIVIDUALS.

532
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,561
THAT IS A STRONG MESSAGE TODAY.

533
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:02,432
AND WE WILL NOT BE -- WE WILL 

534
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:05,903
NOT FEAR OF PROSECUTING 

535
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,703
ADDITIONAL CORPORATION -- 

536
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,005
CAMPAIGN FINANCE CASES.

537
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,574
AND LASTLY AND PERHAPS MOST 

538
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,376
IMPORTANTLY, THIS CASE IS UNIQUE

539
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:16,013
IN MANY WAYS.

540
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:16,613
JUST WITNESS THE GATHERING OF 

541
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:17,581
ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY.

542
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,383
AND IN OTHER WAYS IT IS UNIQUE 

543
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:19,717
AS WELL.

544
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,654
BUT IN THE REALLY IMPORTANT WAYS

545
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,323
THIS CASE IS NOT UNLIKE MANY 

546
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,892
CASES THAT MY OFFICE T YOUTH 

547
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:31,462
ATTORNEYS OFFICE BRINGS THAT THE

548
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,129
ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

549
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,697
BREAKS AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

550
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,198
AGENCIES DO AS WELL INCLUDING 

551
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:38,335
THE FBI AND THE IRS.

552
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,970
THIS CASE HAS MORE IN COMMON 

553
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,772
WITH ALL THE CASES BECAUSE THEY 

554
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,306
ALL SHARE THE SAME MESSAGE.

555
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,741
AND THAT MESSAGE IS THAT THE

MANY VIRTUES AND TALENTS.

608

BUT THE ONE IMPORTANT THING IS 

609
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,455
THEY ALL ARE SATISFIED WITH 

610
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:42,226

HE SAID CHRIS THIS CASE IS 

623
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,979
UNIQUE IN SOME WAYS BUT NOT 

624
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,614
UNLIKELY SO MANY OTHER CASES 

625
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:06,149
THAT U.S. ATTORNEYS FACE EVERY 

626
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:08,352

EVERY DAY.

636
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,001
BUT HE ALSO NOTED THAT THE PREPS

637
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,869
OF THE MEDIA IS THERE BECAUSE 

638
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,604
THIS INVOLVES NOW MICHAEL COHEN 

639
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:29,206
HAD SAID PUBLICLY HE'S DIRECTED 

640
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:34,277
TO DO THESE THINGS BY THEN 

641
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:35,145

PRESIDENT TRUMP.

643
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:37,548
THIS IS NOW GOING TO COME DOWN 

644
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,416
TO A CREDIBILITY ARGUMENT, 

645
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:39,783
GEORGE.

646
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,184
AND WHAT THING THEY HAVE TO 

647
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,720
PROVE THAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN 

648
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,055
FACT DIRECT MICHAEL COHEN. 

649
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,657
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU

650
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:46,957
ABOUT.

651
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,827
WE KNOW THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH 

652
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:50,327
HUN

653
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:51,161
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 

654
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:51,562
DOCUMENTS HERE.

655
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,097
MORE THAN A MILLION DOCUMENTS.

656
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,466
WE KNOW THERE IS NO -- THIS IS 

657
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,934
NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT.

658
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,002
WE'VE ALSO SEEN THIS BOMB SHELL 

659
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:00,571
CHARGE FROM MICHAEL COHEN.

660
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,706
AND ADMISSION.

661
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,274
AT THE COURT SAYING HE DID THIS 

662
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,910
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE 

663
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,311
PRESIDENT.

664
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:07,978
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR 

665
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,812
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW. 

666
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,347
>> LISTEN, ONE WE KNOW THIS IS 

667
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:12,348
ABNORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE I 

668
00:44:12,348 --> 00:44:14,384
THINK MOST PEOPLE, LEGAL EXPERTS

669
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:16,553
COULD WOULD AGREE THE PRESIDENT 

670
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,155
HIMSELF CAN'T BE INDICTED.

671
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:21,891
ANY CHARGES IN THAT THAT REGARD 

672
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:22,525
WOULD HAVE TO BE HANDLED BY 

673
00:44:22,525 --> 00:44:22,792
CONGRESS.

674
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:24,828
I WOULD ALSO SAY NOW WE 

675
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,996
UNDERSTAND PERHAPS WHY MOEB AND 

676
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,698
HIS SPOKESMAN PUTTING OUT THAT 

677
00:44:28,698 --> 00:44:30,634
TAPE OF HE CAN THEN CANDIDATE 

678
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,702
TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE SETTING 

679
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:34,838
UP OF SOME TYPE OF MECHANISM TO 

680
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,274
PAY STORMY DANIELS AND NOW THE 

681
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,508
SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT TAPE IN 

682
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,110
MICHAEL COHEN'S MIND.

683
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,712
I'LL SURE WE'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT

684
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:42,679
STORY FROM THE PRESIDENT IN THE 

685
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:43,713
WHITE HOUSE BUT I THINK THAT 

686
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:46,416
TAPE NOW BECOMES AND ANY OTHER 

687
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:46,983
TAPE BECOMES SIGNIFICANT. 

688
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:48,085
>> AND YOU MENTION THIS AS A 

689
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,320
CREDIBILITY CASE AT THIS POINT.

690
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,488
ISN'T THE PRESIDENT'S CASE HURT 

691
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,357
BY THE FACT THAT PRIOR TO THIS 

692
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,725
HE HAD DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF 

693
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:57,394
THOSE PAYMENTS AND WAS FORCED TO

694
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,730
ADMIT THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THEM?

695
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,598
>> CERTAINLY, GEORGE, EVERY TIME

696
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,766
HE FOUND TO NOT HAVING TOLD THE 

697
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,769
COMPLETE TRUTH, THE UNVARNISHED 

698
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:06,537
TRUTH ABOUT SOMETHING.

699
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,671
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ANY GROUP

700
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,105
OF FOLKS IN THE POSITION OF 

701
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:12,676
DECIDING THE FACTS OF A CASE, 

702
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,643
YOU KNOW, ARE GOING TO LOOK AT 

703
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,179
AND SAY THAT IS A FACTOR TO BE 

704
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:15,479
CONSIDERED.

705
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,115
IN THE END THOUGH, I THINK IT IS

706
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:18,749
VERY INTERESTING THAT MICHAEL 

707
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,350
COHEN IS NOT COOPERATING HERE.

708
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,019
A NON COOPERATING PLEA 

709
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:22,286
AGREEMENT.

710
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,354
HE LOOKS AT A HUGE SENTENCE HERE

711
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:24,654
POTENTIALLY.

712
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:27,156
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S LOOKING AT 

713
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:28,492
SOME SIGNIFICANT CRIMES.

714
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,426
MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS 

715
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,827
OF MONETARY AMOUNT, GEORGE ON 

716
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,462
THE STUFF THAT WAS HIS OWN 

717
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:33,497
PERSONAL CONDUCT THAN WHAT WE'RE

718
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,532
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE 

719
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,367
CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION, 

720
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,068
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CAN 

721
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:40,204
REALLY DRIVE HIS SENTENCE. 

722
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,139
>> THAT IS WHAT WILL DRIVE THE 

723
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:42,406
SENTENCE.

724
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,474
FINAL QUESTION TO DAN ABRAMS OUR

725
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:45,509
CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST.

726
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,810
ONE OF THE OPEN QUESTIONS I 

727
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,345
SUPPOSE, IF BOTH YOU AND CHRIS 

728
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:52,049
CHRISTIE AGREE IT IS UNLIKELY IF

729
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,016
THAT PRESIDENT WOULD BE 

730
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,852
INDICTED, WOULD NOT BE INDICTED.

731
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,587
THE QUESTION IS NOW WOULD THIS 

732
00:45:57,587 --> 00:45:59,623
INFORMATION GO BACK TO ROBERT 

733
00:45:59,623 --> 00:45:59,857
MUELLER.

734
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,425
THE INFORMATION HAVING DO WITH 

735
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:01,825
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

736
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:02,626
>> NO QUESTION THAT IT WILL.

737
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,194
AND THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK

738
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,428
YOURSELF IS IF COHEN ISN'T 

739
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:06,563
TELLING THE TRUTH, WHY WOULD HE 

740
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,999
MAKE THIS UP?

741
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,467
WHY WOULD HE IMPLICATE HIMSELF 

742
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,169
IN A CRIME THAT IS GOING TO ADD 

743
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:15,105
YEARS TO HIS SENTENCE?

744
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,075
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

745
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:18,775
IF THERE IS NO COOPERATION 

746
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,709
AGREEMENT THAT HE'S SORT OF 

747
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:22,412
GETTING THIS ENORMOUS BENEFIT BY

748
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,481
COMING CLEAN ABOUT, WHAT IS HE 

749
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:24,948
GETTING FROM THIS?

750
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,317
AND I THINK THAT THAT ADDS TO 

751
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,553
THE CREDIBILITY OF COHEN'S PLEA 

752
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:29,753
HERE.

753
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:33,023
AND OF THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT 

754
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:33,290
HAPPENED.

755
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,858
BECAUSE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TO BE

756
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,626
A LOGICAL ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER 

757
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:40,364
SIDE APART FROM WHAT I'M SURE 

758
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:40,898
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUDY 

759
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:41,565
GIULIANI WILL SAY IF HE'S JUST 

760
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,900
NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.

761
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,302
HE DID THIS ON HIS OWN.

762
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:45,936
HE'S TRYING TO BLAME PRESIDENT 

763
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:46,269
TRUMP FOR IT.

764
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:47,738
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE -- YOU

765
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,705
KNOW, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT 

766
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,341
IS YOU ADD ANYWAY TO THE PUBLIC 

767
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,143
STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN 

768
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,211
MADE BY GIULIANI AND TRUMP 

769
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:56,046
CONCEDING THE PAYMENTS.

770
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,547
AND YOU ARE IN A DIFFICULT 

771
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:58,682
POSITION HERE WITH REGARD TO 

772
00:46:58,682 --> 00:46:59,015
CREDIBILITY. 

773
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:01,484
>> AND I WANT TO BRING BACK OUR 

774
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,219
SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT.

775
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:07,357
THIS WAS GIVEN OVER FROM ROBERT 

776
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,892
MUELLER TO THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

777
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:09,726
OF NEW YORK.

778
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:13,063
THEY DID REPORT THIS BACK TO THE

779
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,665
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BEFORE 

780
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,265
BRIENGING MICHAEL COHEN INTO 

781
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:19,736
COURT TODAY AND THIS IS 

782
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,805
SOMETHING THEY WERE INFORMED OF.

783
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,206
>> ABSOLUTELY, GEORGE.

784
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:26,944
MULLER WAS AWARE OF ALL THIS 

785
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:27,211
GOING ON.

786
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,445
BUT ONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT 

787
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:28,645
HERE.

788
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:29,946
THIS CASE IS NOT POTENTIALLY 

789
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:30,213
OVER.

790
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:31,982
BECAUSE AS THE CHARGES MENTIONED

791
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,483
THAT COHEN COORDINATED WITH 

792
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,451
OTHER CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS.

793
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,686
THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIKELY GOING TO

794
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,454
GET A CALL FROM THE FBI.

795
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,589
A VISIT FROM THE FBI THAT WILL 

796
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:40,523
WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW 

797
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:41,692
ABOUT THIS.

798
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,859
THEY WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL 

799
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,159
COOPERATION.

800
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,294
SO THIS IS POTENTIALLY FAR FROM 

801
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:44,627
OVER GEORGE. 

802
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:45,495
>> THAT IS A CRITICAL POINT.

803
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:47,497
NOT ONLY THAT HE ACTED AT THE 

804
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,365
DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT BUT 

805
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,399
ALSO HE COORDINATED WITH OTHER 

806
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,768
MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN UNNAMED 

807
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,903
MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN.

808
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:55,772
FINALLY WANT TO GO TO CECELIA 

809
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:56,573
VEGA AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

810
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:57,874
WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM THE 

811
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,477
PRESIDENT BEFORE HE HEADED TO 

812
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,379
CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA AS HE 

813
00:48:03,379 --> 00:48:03,947
WAS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE.

814
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,749
NO DOUBT HE'LL SPEAK OUT 

815
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:06,016
TONIGHT. 

816
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,383
>> CERTAINLY NO DOUBT ABOUT 

817
00:48:07,383 --> 00:48:07,584
THAT.

818
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,086
THIS HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR

819
00:48:10,086 --> 00:48:11,755
THE PRESIDENT.

820
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,990
HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOUND 

821
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,124
GUILTY AND PERHAPS THE 

822
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:14,791
CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE, THE 

823
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,960
HEADLINE SAYS IT ALL.

824
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,395
GEORGE TRUMPS HELD HOUR.

825
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,798
THAT IS HOW THIS IS BEING 

826
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:22,065
DESCRIBED.

827
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:22,799
HELL HOUR.

828
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,234
>> CHARGES AGAINST HIS FORMER 

829
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:24,968
CAMPAIGN CHAIR.

830
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,137
HIS FORMER PERSONAL ATTORNEY.

PAUL MANAFORT CONVICTED ON 8 

832
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,540
CHARGES OF TAX EVASION AND BANK 

833
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:30,974
FRAUD.

834
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:31,874
MICHAEL COHEN PLEADING GUILTY 

835
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,677
TODAY ON CHARGES OF BANK FRAUD 

836
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,479
