1
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,583
ROB: USING FOSTER HOMES TO

00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,918
GET OUR VETERANS AROUND THE

3
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:23,120
CLOCK ASSISTANCE.

00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,321
JILLIAN: 27-MILLION-DOLLAR A

00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,656
YEAR PROGRAM PROVIDES

00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:26,824
HOUSING AND CARE FOR 1,000

7
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,192
VETERANS IN 42 STATES AND

THE V.A. ONLY ACCEPTS FOSTER

9
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,562
HOMES THAT MEET STRICT

10
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:32,029
QUALIFICATIONS.

11
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:33,230
SO, IS THIS A GOOD IDEA?

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,866
HERE NOW TO WEIGH IN IS

13
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:36,667
LIEUTENANT COLONEL JIM

14
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:36,967
REESE.

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:37,601
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US

16
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:38,068
THIS MORNING.

17
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:39,269
WE APPRECIATE IT WHAT DO YOU

18
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:39,570
THINK?

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,305
DO YOU LIKE THIS IDEA?

20
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:41,972
>> I DO.

21
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:46,243
I THINK THE V.A. RIGHT NOW

22
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:48,078
WITH EVERYBODY COMING BACK

23
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:49,913
FROM THE AFGHAN IRAQ WARS

24
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:50,981
AND INFLUX OF VETERANS WE

25
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:52,049
HAVE, I LIKE THIS IDEA.

26
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,319
I THINK IT'S A GREAT NEW

27
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:55,719
INITIATIVE.

28
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,588
I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

29
00:00:57,588 --> 00:01:00,090
IS WITH THIS BIG GOVERNMENT

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,657
BUREAUCRACY CALLED THE

31
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:01,258
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION.

32
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:02,392
WHY HAVE GOT TO DO SOME

33
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:03,026
CHANGE LEADERSHIP.

34
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,428
WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME NEW

35
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:04,894
PROGRAMS.

36
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:07,531
AND THIS IS NOT A NEW

37
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:07,865
PROGRAM.

38
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:09,099
THIS HAS BEEN A PILOT

39
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,334
PROGRAM THAT'S GONE ON FOR

40
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:11,134
SEVERAL YEARS.

41
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,603
IT'S HAD SOME GOOD SUCCESS

42
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:13,837
AND NOW THEY WANT TO EXPAND

43
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:15,472
ON IT SO I DO LIKE IT.

44
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:16,373
ROB: YOU SAY THIS WILL

45
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:17,741
RESULT IN BETTER, CLOSER

46
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,310
CARE FOR THESE VETERANS THAT

47
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,679
NEED IT IN THESE FOSTER

48
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:22,980
HOMES.

49
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,882
YOU SAY THIS WON'T COST THE

50
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:25,916
VETERAN THEMSELVES ANY MORE

51
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,519
MONEY TO GET THIS BETTER

52
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:28,819
CARE?

53
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,087
>> YEAH.

54
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,256
IT'S -- I TRULY BELIEVE THAT

55
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:33,223
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE

56
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,758
VETERANS THAT WOULD MAYBE

57
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:36,560
JUST SIT IN A FOSTER -- I'M

58
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,228
SORRY, THAT WOULD SIT IN A

59
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:41,231
HOME AND THEY GET PERIODIC

60
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,966
CARE BY, YOU KNOW, A NURSE

61
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,401
OR SOME TYPE OF MEDICAL

62
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,536
PROVIDER IN THESE HOMES,

63
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:47,304
WHAT THIS DOES HERE IS THEY

64
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,139
GET INTO A HOME, THEY MIGHT

65
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,607
ONLY HAVE ONE OR TWO OTHER

66
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:51,775
VETERANS THAT ARE WITH THEM

67
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:53,143
AND THEY GET TO BE PART OF

68
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:54,411
THIS FAMILY AND IT'S REALLY

69
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:55,946
SUPPORT OF A GREAT

70
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:56,847
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT.

71
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,616
SO I THINK IT BRINGS BETTER

72
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:00,984
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO MEDICAL

73
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:02,352
ASPECT FOR THESE PEOPLE.

74
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,420
JILLIAN: ARE YOU SEEING

75
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,087
IMPROVEMENT AND PERHAPS

76
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,188
BETTER WAYS OF VETERANS

77
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:06,223
BEING CARED FOR AND TREATED

78
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,891
RIGHT NOW?

79
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,759
>> YOU KNOW, I'M 80%

80
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,029
DISABLED VET.

81
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:13,297
I HAVE -- I DO UNDERSTAND

82
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:13,830
THE V.A.

83
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,732
I KNOW THE V.A. IS WORKING

84
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:17,868
VERY HARD DAILY TO TRY TO

85
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,036
IMPROVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING

86
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:19,703
FOR VETERANS.

87
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:21,772
BUT I STILL THINK IT CAN BE

88
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:22,139
IMPROVED.

89
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,775
I THINK PROGRAMS LIKE THIS

90
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,443
AND NEW CREATIVE IDEAS WILL

91
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:28,111
KIND OF BREAK UP THIS

92
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,013
BUREAUCRACY AND GIVE

93
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:31,682
VETERANS BETTER CARE,

94
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:32,716
ESPECIALLY AFTER LEARNING

95
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:35,252
FROM THE VIETNAM WAR WHAT

96
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,753
THESE NEW IRAQI AFGHAN VETS

97
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:37,754
WILL LEARN FROM ALL THE

98
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,323
YEARS OF SUPPORTING THE

99
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:40,691
VIETNAM WAR VETERAN.

100
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:41,658
ROB: WE HAVE HEARD THE

101
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:42,492
HORROR STORIES OF THE THINGS

102
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:44,528
THAT HAVE GONE ON AT V.A.

103
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:45,128
HOSPITALS.

104
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,697
WE SEEN THE STORIES TIME AND

105
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:47,297
TIME AGAIN.

106
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:48,332
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO

107
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:51,134
SIGN THIS VETERANS CHOICE

108
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:51,435
BILL.

109
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:52,302
ALLOWING VETERANS TO GET

110
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,637
PRIVATE CARE IF THEY CHOOSE

111
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:54,171
TO DO SO.

112
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,439
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR

113
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,573
PEOPLE COMING BACK TO THESE

114
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,241
WARS TO SEE THAT SOMEBODY

115
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:59,876
REALLY DOES CARE TO DO THIS,

116
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:02,546
TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS.

117
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:03,547
>> YEAH.

118
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,481
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

119
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,118
I MEAN, WE LIVE IN SUCH A

120
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:08,652
DIFFERENT TIME.

121
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:10,387
WITH THE INFORMATION AGE AND

122
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:11,655
VETERANS ARE ALLOWED TO COME

123
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,390
BACK AND, YOU KNOW, THE

124
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,825
TRANSPORTATION HUBS TODAY.

125
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,159
SO VETERANS ARE GOING

126
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,628
FARTHER AWAY FROM WHERE

127
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:18,495
THESE V.A. CENTERS ARE.

128
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,430
SO THIS WILL HELP VETERANS

129
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,500
THAT MIGHT BE 50 MILES OR

130
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,240
MORE OR HAVE TO FLY OR GET

131
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:30,674
SITE.

132
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:31,775
THIS WILL HELP THEM GET

133
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,342
BETTER CARE.

134
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,277
I'M A BIG PROPONENT.

135
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,646
I THINK YOU CAN BREAK DOWN

136
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:37,047
SOME OF THESE -- THE OLD

137
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,082
BRING AND MORTAR TYPE V.A.S

138
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:41,184
AND GET THEM PUSHED OUT TO

139
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,885
BETTER MEDICAL CARE WHICH

140
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,687
WILL REDUCE THE COST OF THE

141
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:44,855
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION.

142
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:48,925
ROB: THAT'S PART OF IT, TOO.

143
00:03:48,925 --> 00:00:00,000
SOME CAN BE REPAIRED.
