patience I go to Hyuna nothing actually tell you yeah yeah exactly so we we have all of this as a lurid backdrop to a chaotic week last week where you had the president of united states and raging conservatives with one of the most reckless omnibus spending bills ever it was actually this sort of omnibus spending bill that led us to drive Newt Gingrich out of town is Speaker of the House in 1998 you then have the chaos of tariffs and China saying okay you want to get into a tariff or great will go into a full-blown tariff or you had the the Dow and the SP fall a great bit on Friday and then you had perhaps most worrying for the international community and a lot of conservative Republicans who aren't neo-cons the pointment of John Bolton and David as we look at all the chaos that's moving forward the first question is what's the National Security Council going to look like after John Bolton fires two-thirds of his staff there and the other one-third quit in protest well I you know the the ones who were left will be talking about stormy Daniels we know that because they have a water cooler at the NSC yes I think that it's gonna be very tough to work for John Bolton at the NSC as it was at the State Department he's famously a difficult boss the NSC job historically is that the role is to be the honest broker to balance the different government agencies departments and give a consensus to the President to letting each each person each party speak their case in make in making policy Bolton is not a person who's ever shown any ability to do that so I think it's gonna it's going to be tough to make to make the process work I worry most when I think about Bolton about our allies we are depending now on on the strong alliances that we've got around the world especially to deal with North Korea Bolton is somebody who needs to keep South Korea on board as now I both needs to reassure Japan we're not gonna do anything crazy here the president is gonna meet and talk and we're gonna seek a resolution within the case of Iran and the Iran nuclear deal he has to reassure a Europe that increasingly fears that their security is gonna be put a greater risk by American moose he's bolting the person who can who can do that if he isn't he's gonna fail on a central piece of the job of being national security adviser so at the end of the week you know so many instances of chaos this is the one that I think allies look most closely at when David let's be very clear because there were a few conservative writers out there trying to defend well a few neo cons trying to defend the appointment of John Bolton saying that any suggestions of him being a war monger who is greatly greatly exaggerated this is a man who wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal not so long ago calling for pre-emptive first strike smilla Terry strikes against North Korea when just about every other military planner would tell you that that could lead to the death of half a million Koreans and within a week here's a man who's called for the bombing the pre-emptive bombing of Iran and still claims all these years later that his role in Jenning up support for the Iraq war was the right thing that in fact the Iraq war was a worthy cause and actually the only mistake that was ever made in that war are the greatest mistake was when Barack Obama brought the troops home this is a man who who seems to have a default switch that says use the military go to war whenever possible so I think he's the rear person and Washington around the world hasn't really learned anything from the experience of the Iraq war certainly our military has most policy makers have I'm also struck by the paradox of seeking to negotiate a nuclear agreement with a North Korea that's genuinely threatening where it's important to have that agreement at the same time that you're about to throw out the window an agreement that was so difficult to achieve to restrain Iran's nuclear program it just doesn't fit and I think that somehow they have the idea that getting tough on the one get makes it easier on the other I think it actually is going to work in the opposite direction but no question around the world this set of issues surrounding foreign policy the president heading toward the waterfall with this this new paddler on the side john bolton that's going to scare people people wonder is his general mattis still the go-to guy who can restrain the president as he as he makes these decisions boy that is going to be quite a dynamic the Secretary of Defense and the national security adviser we'll see how it works out Jonathan Turley thank you so much for being with us as always thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
