1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
I'd be lying<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I said that weren't</font>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,510
points on this trip when I wish I could

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,310
drive and I wish I could just kind of

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,470
pull myself out of situations and go

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,200
places and the main example of this was

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,410
that I took a bus and megabus wait dear

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,969
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I managed to put my tickets</font>

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,949
during the megabus 200,000 to get to

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,500
give away so my ride out<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pittsburgh was</font>

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,600
free my ride back was ten dollars so you

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,640
can't really complain about it but on

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,099
the way out unfortunately the bus broke

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,260
down and the trip from New York to

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pittsburgh is about eight hours or so</font>

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,520
and we were stuck at this gas station

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,350
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we broke down because the</font>

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,630
battery mounted for about six hours but

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,370
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhyme at Pittsburgh at seven</font>

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,570
in the morning and we arrived at midday

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,309
it was good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I'd allowed a lot of</font>

21
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,469
time just in case things happen and

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,730
that's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good plan if</font>

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,710
you're flying or if you're taking

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,210
coaches and taking public transportation

25
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,010
because you're not in control of your

26
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,539
journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same way that you would</font>

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,460
be if you're walking or if you're in a

28
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,190
car I must broke down and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

29
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,079
fine but it made<font color="#CCCCCC"> me realize that one</font>

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,850
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always pack with me when</font>

31
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,399
I travel is a blanket I've bought a nice

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,890
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 c1 which was very thin for</font>

33
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,750
seven dollars at the gas station as I

34
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,860
say it was thin but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of</font>

35
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,659
effective and<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just an extra layer on</font>

36
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,159
top I was wearing lots of layers anyway

37
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,710
water and snacks and chewing gum are my

38
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,110
big essentials for those kinds of trips

39
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,119
you go surprisingly quickly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

40
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,220
can look out a window and because you're

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">not flying high in the air do you all</font>

42
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,759
like on the ground for some reason for

43
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes the trip fuel so quicker I</font>

44
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,750
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> get quite not reading done but I</font>

45
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,430
never get as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> sun gate i think i'm</font>

46
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,799
going to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as kind of bus as a mode</font>

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,360
of transportation guys I think it's

48
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite good I was little bus from Boston</font>

49
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,840
to New York with a company like a star

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,729
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fifteen dollars great</font>

51
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,650
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to be quite on time</font>

52
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,970
they tend to know what they're talking

53
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,120
about they give you

54
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to get</font>

55
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">there I do pretend I wasn't worried and</font>

56
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> stressed out and it wasn't kind</font>

57
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of obsessed by the fact that the bus</font>

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,050
broke down for that said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't</font>

59
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,090
the end of the world and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> riving the</font>

60
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,000
way back was absolutely perfect also if

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this situation where your bus</font>

62
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,780
breaks down call up customer services if

63
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,370
you're not satisfied with<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they dealt</font>

64
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,230
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a situation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they should give</font>

65
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">you some kind of conversation for it</font>

66
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,740
like it should give you a refund and if

67
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,880
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should give you like a</font>

68
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,500
free trip or about or something like

69
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pastor I had wasn't aware of where</font>

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,630
the battery boards in the coach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

71
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned out to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem the battery</font>

72
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,450
mounted and he was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

73
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,190
mechanic I'm not mechanic I'm just a bus

74
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,930
driver I just drive the bus I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

75
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,510
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay you drive the bus but</font>

76
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,680
to a certain extent when you're

77
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,140
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for about 60 people you</font>

78
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,570
should know how you can jump-start the

79
00:02:31,570 --> 00:00:00,000
coach when it breaks down anyway
