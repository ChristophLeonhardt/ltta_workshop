YOU KNOW, I WISH WE COULD HAVE 
HAD THIS STAGE BACK ABOUT 100 
YARDS, YOU WOULD SEE HOW MANY 
PEOPLE -- THIS PLACE IS PACKED. 
>> 
>> THE ONLY THING MORE PACKED 
IS OUTSIDE, TRYING TO GET IN. 
HAVING A HARD TIME, THEY CAN'T 
GET IN. 
IT IS FULL. 
YOU KNOW, WE HAD THE CHANCE FOR 
A 24,000 SEAT ARENA. 
WE SHOULD OF TAKEN IT. 
>>  -- 
WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT. 
>> THE PROBLEM IS IF WE HAD TO 
EMPTY SEATS WHICH DIDN'T QUITE 
GET THERE WHICH WILL ALWAYS 
HAPPEN -- THEY WILL SAY, HE 
DIDN'T FILL UP THE ARENA. 
HE DIDN'T FILL IT UP. 
RIGHT? 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL SAY. 
HE DIDN'T FILL THAT ARENA UP, 
24,000 SEATS. 
WE WOULD HAVE FILLED IT UP VERY 
EASILY IN RETROSPECT. 
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE IN THE 
GREAT STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA 
WITH SO MANY HARD-WORKING 
AMERICAN PATRIOTS.

KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, I 
WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE NORTH 
DAKOTA STATE BISON. 
>>

SHOULDN'T TELL YOU THIS BUT 
WHEN I WAS COMING OUT, THEY 
WERE TALKING ABOUT BISON. 
I THOUGHT I SAID IT -- I 
THOUGHT IT WAS A S BUT THEY 
SAID IT'S PRONOUNCED "BIZON." 
WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET THAT 
WRONG. 
THAT IS SOME NATIONAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM, THAT'S A 
GREAT GROUP OF WINNERS. 
THEY ARE WINNERS. 
WE ARE HONORED TO BE JOINED BY

THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
ALL I CAN SAY IS, MR. PRESIDENT,
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS 
ARENA AND THE TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OUTSIDE OF THIS ARENA, WHO LIVE 
IN FLYOVER COUNTRY, THANK YOU 
FOR NOT FORGETTING US. 
>> 
>> AND FOR ALL THE FARMERS AND 
THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE 
FAMILIES AND THE ENERGY WORKERS,
THANK YOU FOR ROLLING BACK ALL 
OF THOSE REGULATIONS SO THEY 
CANNOT ONLY KEEP THEIR JOB BUT 
CREATE MORE JOBS. 
>> 
>> AND, MR. PRESIDENT, ON 
BEHALF OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS 
WORKING FAMILIES REPRESENTED IN 
THIS ROOM AND THROUGHOUT THE 
HEARTLAND, THANK YOU FOR 
CUTTING THEIR TAXES SO THEY CAN 
KEEP MORE OF THEIR HARD-EARNED 
MONEY! 
RIGHT HERE! 
>> 
>> AND, MR. PRESIDENT, ON 
BEHALF OF THE MOST VULNERABLE 
FORGOTTEN PEOPLE, THE UNBORN 
BABIES, THANK YOU FOR STANDING 
FOR LIFE! 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> AND ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT 
NORTH DAKOTA VALUES, YOU WILL 
NEVER HAVE TO WONDER WHERE I'LL 
BE. 
BECAUSE I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH 
THEM AND WITH YOU. 
100% OF THE TIME. 
THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU, 
WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA! 
>> 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT'S 
PRETTY GOOD. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
HE DID GOOD. 
HE LOVES YOU, I WILL TELL YOU 
THAT, HE LOVES THIS STATE, 
LOVES THE PEOPLE. 
AND WE NEED KEVIN CRAMER TO 
REPLACE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT HEIDI 
HEITKAMP. 
IN THE SENATE. 
WHEN HEIDI RAN FOR OFFICE, SHE 
PROMISED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT 
VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE OF NORTH 
DAKOTA. 
INSTEAD, SHE WENT TO WASHINGTON 
AND IMMEDIATELY JOINED CHUCK -- 
YOU KNOW WHO CHUCK IS -- AND 
NANCY -- 
>> 
>> AND NOW THEY HAVE A NEW 
LEADER, WHO IS THE NEW LEADER? 
MAXINE WATERS IS THERE NEW 
LEADER. 
>> 
>> MAXINE WATERS. 
I THINK SHE'S TAKING OVER, YOU 
KNOW THEY SAY TRUMP -- I NEVER 
BELIEVE I WAS TAKING OVER THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
THEY SAY THAT BECAUSE -- TO 
CAUSE PROBLEMS. 
BUT MAXINE WATERS IS TAKING 
OVER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
HEIDI VOTED NO, ON THE OBAMACARE
REPEAL. 
BY THE WAY IT WAS DONE -- IT 
WAS DONE, UNFORTUNATELY SHE 
WOULDN'T VOTE. 
AND ANOTHER PERSON DIDN'T VOTE, 
WE HAD IT DONE. 
ANOTHER PERSON CAMPAIGNED -- 
FOR EIGHT YEARS -- REPEAL AND 
REPLACE -- AND WE WERE A LITTLE 
SURPRISED WHEN THE SUN WENT 
DOWN BUT WE ARE DOING VERY 
WELL, YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING, 
WE ARE COMING UP WITH 
INCREDIBLE PLANS, WE'VE GOTTEN 
RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 
WHICH IS TERRIBLE. 
>> 
>> IT'S BEEN GUTTED. 
REMEMBER THIS. 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHERE YOU 
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF PAYING A 
LOT OF MONEY FOR THE SECOND 
PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO PAY 
FOR NOT GETTING HEALTHCARE. 
WHAT KIND OF DEAL IS THAT? 
SO YOU PAY IN ORDER TO NOT TO 
HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
WANT THE HEALTHCARE BECAUSE IT 
WAS NO GOOD ANYWAY. 
SO WE HAVE, THROUGH OUR 
SECRETARY OF LABOR, ALEX 
ACOSTA, WE JUST CAME OUT WITH 
THE ASSOCIAION PLAN WHICH IS 
PHENOMENAL. 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
ARE SIGNING UP AND WE ARE 
COMING UP WITH ANOTHER PLAN WITH
ALEX AZAR. WE ARE COMING OUT 
WITH THAT PLAN IN TWO WEEKS, WE 
ARE COMING OUT WITH SO MANY 
HEALTHCARE PLANS THAT ARE SO 
MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING 
YOU'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. 
COMPETITIVE. 
AND OBAMACARE IS ESSENTIALLY 
DEAD. 
>> 
>> I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER 
WITH A NICE YES VOTE INSTEAD OF 
A NO VOTE, BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
WE ARE DOING GREAT AND PROBABLY 
WE WOULDN'T HAVE COME UP WITH 
THESE TWO OTHER PLANS -- IT'S 
ACTUALLY THREE NOW OTHER PLANS 
-- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU WORK 
UNDER PRESSURE AND YOU DO 
BETTER, RIGHT? 
I THINK MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN 
THIS ROOM UNDER PRESSURE -- YOU 
END UP DOING BETTER. 
THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE. 
WE WANT TO KNOW THOSE PEOPLE. 
HEIDI VOTED NO. 
ON OUR MASSIVE TAX CUTS. 
FOR NORTH DAKOTA FAMILIES. 
SHE VOTED NO. 
NOT ONE DEMOCRAT VOTED TO CUT 
YOUR TAXES. AND THE OTHER DAY, 
NANCY PELOSI SAID, WE HAVE TO 
RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? 
SHE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
HEIDI VOTED NO ON LEGISLATION 
TO STOP LATE TERM ABORTIONS. 
>> 
>> HEIDI VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE 
DEADLY, VERY, VERY DANGEROUS, 
HORRIBLE SANCTUARY CITIES. 
>> 
>> YOU NEED A SENATOR WHO 
DOESN'T JUST TALK LIKE THEY ARE 
FROM NORTH DAKOTA. 
BUT VOTES LIKE THEY ARE FROM 
NORTH DAKOTA, THAT'S WHAT YOU 
NEED. 
AND THAT IS KEVIN CRAMER. 
>>  
>> SO A VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT 
IN NOVEMBER IS A VOTE FOR 
SCHUMER, PELOSI AND MAXINE. 
>> . 
>> MAXINE IS A BEAUTY. 
I MEAN, SHE PRACTICALLY WAS 
TELLING PEOPLE THE OTHER DAY TO 
ASSAULT -- CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I 
SAID THE THINGS SHE SAID? 
WE DEMAND THAT HE IMMEDIATELY 
DROP OUT OF THE RACE. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE SERIOUSLY -- IF 
I SAID THAT OR -- SOMEBODY ELSE 
SAID THAT? 
HORRIBLE, WHAT SHE SAID. 
NOW THEY WANT TO CENSURE HER. 
LET'S SEE WHERE THAT GOES, 
FOLKS. 
HER OWN PARTY WAS TALKING ABOUT 
CENSURE. 
LET'S SEE WHERE THAT GOES. 
HEIDI WAS ALSO AGAINST US FROM 
THE VERY BEGINNING. 
OF THE TRAVEL BAN -- A 
COMMONSENSE POLICY TO IMPROVE 
OUR VETTING AND OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
AND I'M PROUD TO REPORT THAT 
JUST YESTERDAY, THE SUPREME 
COURT UPHELD THE TRAVEL BAN. 
AND OUR AUTHORITY TO KEEP 
AMERICA SAFE! 
>> 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> AND BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, 
A LOT OF MEDIA BACK HERE. 
>> 
>> IF CROOKED HILLARY WOULD 
HAVE WON THIS ELECTION AND IF 
SHE CAME HERE, WHICH IS ABOUT A 
0% CHANCE, AFTER THE ELECTION --
SHE WOULD HAVE 200 PEOPLE IN A 
CONFERENCE ROOM IN A SMALL 
HOTEL. 
YOU KNOW THE SADDEST THING -- 
WE, I, WERE MAKING THEM RICH. 
THEY NEVER HAD RATINGS LIKE 
THIS. 
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE NFL IS DOWN 
20%, IT'S THE FLAG. 
BUT IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT 
EVERYBODY IS WATCHING US ON THE 
DIFFERENT CABLE NETWORKS. 
>>  
>> BECAUSE, FRANKLY, THEY FIND 
THIS MORE EXCITING THAN THE NFL 
AND A HELL OF A LOT MORE 
DANGEROUS. 
RIGHT? 
AND IS THERE ANY BETTER PLACE 
TO BE ON A NICE BEAUTIFUL 
EVENING IN NORTH DAKOTA THAN AT 
A TRUMP RALLY, RIGHT? 
WE ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME. 
>>  
>> AND I WISH THOSE CAMERAS 
WOULD CIRCLE THE ROOM TO SEE 
HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
ARE HERE. 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, ON THE 
SCREEN, I LOOK AND ALL YOU SEE 
ARE THOSE FEW BEAUTIFUL 
WONDERFUL PEOPLE. 
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL -- 
YOU'VE GOT A NICE GROUP OVER 
THERE, I KNOW YOU HAVE MIKE AND 
SOME OTHERS -- THEY'RE GOING TO 
BE SO FAMOUS. 
BUT YOU SEE, LIKE, THAT LITTLE 
GROUP, THAT'S ALL YOU SEE ON 
CAMERA. 
WOULD YOU PLEASE CIRCLE THE 
ROOM FOR THE FEW HONEST -- 
PLEASE CIRCLE. 
>> 
>>  USA! 
USA! 
>> I JUST LOOKED AT THE SCREEN. 
AND I SAID TO MY PEOPLE, HOW 
MANY PEOPLE ARE HERE? 
THEY SAID 6,000 IN THE ARENA, 
BUT WE ARE GOING TO -- 
UNFORTUNATELY WALK 15 OR 18,000 
PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T GET IN -- 
I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO BE 
KIDDING. 
ON THE SCREEN IT LOOKS LIKE 
THERE'S EXACTLY 30 PEOPLE. 
WHAT THE HELL IS IT? 
THE LATE, GREAT CECIL B. 
DEMILLE WOULD NOT HAVE SET UP 
THIS WAY, I WILL TELL YOU. 
THE TRAVEL BAN RULING 
UNDERSCORES JUST HOW CRITICAL 
IT IS TO CONFIRM JUDGES WHO 
WILL SUPPORT OUR CONSTITUTION. 
OUR GREAT, GREAT CONSTITUTION. 
>>  
>> JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY, A 
VERY SPECIAL GUY, ALSO JUST 
ANNOUNCED A LITTLE WHILE AGO 
HIS RETIREMENT. 
FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT. 
GREAT MAN. 
AND I AM VERY HONORED THAT HE 
CHOSE TO DO IT DURING MY TERM 
IN OFFICE. 
BECAUSE HE FELT CONFIDENT IN ME 
THAT -- TO MAKE THE RIGHT 
CHOICE AND CARRY ON HIS GREAT 
LEGACY. 
THAT'S WHY HE DID IT. 
>> 
>> AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A 
MOMENT TO SHOW OUR GREAT 
APPRECIATION FOR JUSTICE 
KENNEDY'S LIFETIME OF 
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE, TERRIFIC 
MAN. 
SERVICE TO OUR NATION, AND TO 
THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY. WE WERE 
THRILLED TO APPOINT ONE OF 
KENNEDY'S FORMER CLERKS TO THE 
SUPREME COURT, DID YOU EVER 
HEAR OF JUSTICE
NEIL GORSUCH? 
>> 
>> HE'S DOING GREAT. 
HE IS A STAR. 
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY IS A STAR. 
AND WE APPRECIATE IT, WE HAVE 
TO TAKE OUR HATS OFF TO JUSTICE 
KENNEDY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
AND REMEMBER THIS, SO WE HAVE A 
PICK TO COME UP, WE HAVE TO 
PICK A GREAT ONE. 
WE HAVE TO PICK ONE THAT'S 
GOING TO BE THERE FOR 40 YEARS, 
45 YEARS. 
WE NEED INTELLECT, WE NEED SO 
MANY THINGS TO GO -- THERE'S SO 
MANY ELEMENTS GOING INTO THE 
MAKING OF A GREAT JUSTICE OF 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
YOU'VE GOT TO HIT EVERY ONE OF 
THEM. 
HEIDI WILL VOTE NO TO ANY PICK 
WE MAKE FOR THE SUPREME COURT, 
SHE WILL BE TOLD TO DO SO. 
MAYBE BECAUSE OF THIS, SHE WILL 
BE FORCED TO VOTE YES, WHO 
KNOWS? 
I WILL TELL YOU, SHE WILL VOTE 
NO THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION 
ON EVERYTHING. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT 
MAKES THE ISSUE OF SENATE 
CONTROL ONE OF THE VITAL ISSUES 
OF OUR TIME. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN 
DO. 
DEMOCRATS WANT JUDGES WHO WILL 
REWRITE THE CONSTITUTION ANYWAY 
THEY WANT TO DO IT. 
AND TAKE AWAY YOUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT, ERASE YOUR BORDERS, 
THROW OPEN THE JAILHOUSE DOORS, 
AND DESTROY OUR FREEDOMS. 
WE MUST ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS. 
WE HAVE TO DO THAT. 
>> 
>> AND THE PROBLEM IS IN THE 
SENATE, WE HAVE 51. 
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. 
WE LOSE ONE, IF SOMEBODY GETS A 
BAD COLD, LET'S ASSUME THEY 
COME IN FOR A COLD, LET'S 
ASSUME IT'S WORSE THAN THAT, 
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 
ESPECIALLY IN THE SENATE. 
WE HAVE TO HOLD THE HOUSE AND 
MAYBE EVEN INCREASE IT AND I 
THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT. 
THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS 
BLUE WAVE. 
THEIR BLUE WAVE IS REALLY 
SPUTTERING PRETTY BADLY. 
THE RED WAVE IS HAPPENING. 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. 
>> 
>> RIGHT? 
FAMOUS PEOPLE. 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO FAMOUS 
TOMORROW. 
YOU WERE IN THAT LITTLE GROUP 
OF PEOPLE BEHIND THE PRESIDENT. 
YEAH. 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE FAMOUS 
PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE, YOU HAVE 
A BETTER LOCATION BUT THERE 
GOING TO BE FAMOUS. 
REPUBLICANS WANT STRONG BORDERS 
AND NO CRIME, VERY SIMPLE. 
NOT COMPLEX. 
DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN BORDERS, 
AND CRIME, CRIME, CRIME HAPPENS 
AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE 
THOSE OPEN BORDERS. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO LET THE 
COUNTRY BE OVERRUN, JUST TAKE A 
LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON, 
EVERYBODY COMES IN
INCLUDING THE VILE GANG MS-13, 
WHICH NANCY PELOSI HAS GONE OUT 
AND WANTS TO PROTECT. 
OKAY? 
WE DON'T WANT TO PROTECT THEM. 
TWO WEEKS AGO YOU REMEMBER 
THAT. 
REPUBLICANS LOVE OUR MILITARY. 
THEY LOVE OUR VETS. 
AND OUR POLICE. 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ALWAYS 
FIGHTING AGAINST FUNDING FOR 
THE MILITARY. 
AND FUNDING FOR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. 
DEMOCRATS ARE NOW LAUNCHING 
VICIOUS SMEARS AGAINST OUR 
INCREDIBLE I.C.E. 
OFFICERS AND OUR BORDER PATROL 
AGENTS. 
EVERY SINGLE DAY, THE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF I.C.E. 
AND THE CBC WORK LONG HOURS IN 
THE MOST DANGEROUS CONDITIOS 
YOU CAN IMAGINE. 
TO DEFEND OUR FAMILIES AND TO 
DEFEND OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO 
DEFEND OUR BORDERS AND DEFEND 
US. 
>> 
>> AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU 
KNOW, FAR FEWER PEOPLE ARE 
COMING THROUGH -- AS MUCH AS I 
COMPLAIN -- COMING THROUGH OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER. 
NOW IT'S GETTING WORSE BECAUSE 
WE HAVE SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY 
HERE. 
WE HAVE DONE SO WELL AND WE 
WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR 
COUNTRY, BUT WE WANT THEM TO 
COME INTO OUR COUNTRY BASED ON 
MERIT. 
MERIT. 
NOT PICKED OUT OF A JAR. 
>>  
>> AND WE ARE SENDING MS-13 OUT 
BY THE THOUSANDS! 
BY THE THOUSANDS. 
WE ARE LIBERATING TOWNS IN LONG 
ISLAND. 
WE ARE SENDING MS-13 OUT. 
YOU KNOW, OUR I.C.E. 
OFFICERS, THEY ARE TOUGH. 
I'VE GOT TO SAY IT, IT'S NOT 
NICE, BUT THEY ARE MEAN. 
BUT THEY HAVE HEART. 
BUT THEY GO INTO THESE TOWNS, 
IN LONG ISLAND, I GREW UP IN 
LONG ISLAND RIGHT NEXT TO LONG 
ISLAND, AND THESE ARE TOWNS 
THAT I KNOW ALL MY LIFE. 
THEY ARE BEING LIBERATED LIKE A 
FOREIGN POWER HAS TAKEN OVER 
THE TOWNS. 
I.C.E. 
GOES IN THERE, THEY GRAB THEM 
BY THE NECK, THEY THROW THEM IN 
THE PADDY WAGON, WE GET THEM 
THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>> 
>> AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING THAT WE 
ARE TOO ROUGH ON I.C.E. 
DO YOU BELIEVE IT? 
DO YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO? 
RIGHT? 
DO YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING? 
DO YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING? 
THEY DON'T NEED GUNS, THEY LIKE 
KNIVES BECAUSE KNIVES ARE MUCH 
MORE PAINFUL. 
THEY CUT PEOPLE UP IN SMALL 
PIECES. 
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN WALKING 
HOME FROM SCHOOL. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS COMPLAINED 
THAT WE ARE TREATING THEM TOO 
ROUGH. 
WE ARE GETTING THEM THE HELL OUT
AS I SAID. 
BY THE THOUSANDS. 
>> 
>> JUST DAYS AGO, A BRAVE 
BORDER AGENT WAS SHOT MULTIPLE 
TIMES WHILE PROTECTING OUR 
BORDER. 
EVERY DAY, BORDER AGENTS ARE 
KEEPING DRUGS, CRIME AND GANGS 
FROM ENTERING OUR COUNTRY. 
WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT WALL 
BUILT, WE'VE ALREADY STARTED 
IT. 
$1.6BILLION. 
WE ARE GETTING THE WALL BUILT. 
>>  BUILD THAT 
WALL! 
>> IT'S ALREADY BEGUN. 
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL. 
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY 
MAY NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT 
IN CALIFORNIA, BUT THOSE PEOPLE 
IN SAN DIEGO ARE VERY HAPPY 
WITH DONALD TRUMP, I'M BUILDING 
THAT WALL AND THEY ARE SO 
HAPPY. 
>>  
>> THEY ARE SO HAPPY. 
IN RECENT DAYS, WE'VE HEARD OF 
SHAMELESS ATTACKS ON THESE 
COURAGEOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS. 
EXTREMISTS, DEMOCRAT 
POLITICIANS HAVE CALLED FOR THE 
COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF I.C.E., 
WE DON'T WANT I.C.E. 
ANYMORE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED TO PARTS OF OUR 
COUNTRY? 
IT WOULD BE OVERRUN WITH THE 
WORST CRIMINAL ELEMENTS YOU 
HAVE EVER SEEN. 
LEFT-WING ACTIVISTS ARE TRYING 
TO BLOCK I.C.E. 
OFFICERS FROM DOING THEIR JOBS. 
AND PUBLICLY POSTING THEIR HOME 
ADDRESSES, PUTTING THESE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND THEIR 
FAMILIES IN HARM'S WAY. 
>> 
>> THESE RADICAL DEMOCRAT 
PROTESTERS, THEY REALLY WANT 
ANARCHY, BUT THE ONLY RESPONSE 
THEY WILL FIND FROM OUR 
GOVERNMENT IS VERY STRONG LAW 
AND ORDER. 
>> 
>> WE WILL NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS 
ON OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE WILL 
PROTECT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
LIKE THEY PROTECT US. 
>>  
>> WE WILL ALWAYS STAND PROUDLY 
WITH OUR BRAVE HEROES OF 
I.C.E., THE BORDER PATROL, THE 
SHERIFFS, THE POLICE, YES, THE 
FIREMEN, THE FIREMEN SOMETIMES 
ARE UNDER ATTACK IF YOU CAN 
BELIEVE IT. 
THE FIREMEN. 
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND WE HAVE THEIR BACKS. 
>> 
>> THANKS TO REPUBLICAN 
LEADERSHIP, AMERICA IS WINNING 
AGAIN AND AMERICA IS BEING 
RESPECTED AGAIN ALL OVER THE 
WORLD. 
WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN. 
>> 
>> ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE'RE 
RESPECTED AGAIN. 
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE RED HATS 
AND THE WHITE HATS, MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
RIGHT? 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY IN 
2 1/2 YEARS FOR THE NEXT 
CAMPAIGN? 
IT'S CALLED KEEP AMERICA GREAT, 
EXCLAMATION POINT! 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
WE'VE GAINED $7 TRILLION IN 
VALUE, TRILLION WITH A "T." 
I HAVE WEALTHY FRIENDS LIKE 
HAROLD HAMM, THEY DON'T EVEN 
KNOW WHAT A TRILLION 
REPRESENTS. 
I SAY, HAROLD, HOW MANY BILLION 
ARE IN A TRILLION? 
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT HAROLD 
COULD ANSWER THAT. 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'VE 
GAINED TREMENDOUS WORTH, 
ECONOMIC WORTH. 
AND OTHER WORTH. 
MORE IMPORTANT WORTH. 
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN, WE ARE 
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 
WE ARE MAKING GREAT TRADE 
DEALS. 
$7TRILLION, THINK OF THAT -- 
THINK OF WHAT THAT IS AND 
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS AND 
WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG WITH 
CHINA. 
AND WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG 
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH 
HAS BARRIERS FROM OUR FARMERS 
AND PEOPLE, SELLING PRODUCT 
INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
LAST YEAR, WITH THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, AND WE LOVE THE EUROPEAN 
UNION AND WE LOVE THE COUNTRIES 
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION -- BUT 
THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE 
WAS SET UP TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
TO ATTACK OUR PIGGY BANK, 
RIGHT? 
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE CAN'T LET 
THAT HAPPEN. 
LAST YEAR WITH THE EUROPEAN 
UNION WE LOST $151 BILLION ON 
TRADE. 
WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT OF $151 
BILLION BECAUSE THEY SEND THE 
MERCEDES IN, THEY SEND THE BMW 
IN, THEY SEND THEIR PRODUCTS 
IN, WE SEND THINGS TO THEM AND 
THEY SAY NO, THANK YOU, WE 
DON'T TAKE YOUR PRODUCT, THAT'S 
NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. 
FOR ALL THOSE FREE TRADERS OUT 
THERE, THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE, 
THAT'S STUPID TRADE. 
STUPID TRADE. 
SO I SAID TO THEM, AS THE GREAT 
HAROLD HAMM WOULD SAY, BECAUSE 
TO HIM IT'S A NATURAL THING, TO 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN HERE -- I 
KNOW SOME OF THE BOOK -- THEY 
ARE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE -- I 
SAID VERY SIMPLY, LOOK, IF YOU 
TREAT US THAT WAY AND YOU DON'T 
TAKE DOWN YOUR BARRIERS, THEY 
CALL THEM TRAIT -- YOU KNOW 
WHAT THEY CALL THEM, 
NONMONETARY BARRIERS. 
THEY'RE BARRIERS. 
JUST LIKE CHARGING A BIG TERRY. 
THEY CHARGE US MANY TIMES TARIFF
-- IF WE SEND THEM A CAR, WHICH 
THEY DON'T WANT, THEY 
PRACTICALLY DON'T TAKE -- BUT 
ON THE ASSUMPTION IT GOT 
THROUGH, THEY CHARGE US MANY, 
MANY TIMES WHAT WE CHARGE THEM. 
AND I SAID, LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO TREAT US FAIRLY, IF 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TREAT OUR 
WORKERS, COMPANIES, FARMERS 
FAIRLY, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 
TAKE OUR FARM PRODUCT LIKE WE 
TAKE YOUR FARM PRODUCT, WE'RE 
GOING TO TAX THOSE BEAUTIFUL 
MERCEDES BENZ COMING IN AND WE 
ARE GOING TO TAX BMWS THAT ARE 
COMING IN. 
>>  
>> AND WE ARE ALREADY TAXING 
THROUGH TARIFFS, THEIR STEEL 
AND THEIR ALUMINUM. 
AND BY THE WAY, DO YOU SEE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR STEEL 
INDUSTRY IN THE LAST FOUR 
MONTHS? 
IT'S BOOMING AGAIN, FOLKS. 
IT'S BOOMING. 
UNITED STATES STEEL IS OPENING 
UP SIX PLANTS THROUGH EXPANSION 
AND NEW -- I WAS IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA THE OTHER NIGHT. 
WHERE, BY THE WAY, A GREAT 
CANDIDATE WON VERY EASILY, YOU 
KNOW OUR TRACK RECORD IS 
EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD, RIGHT? 
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, FOR KEVIN, 
THAT'S WHY. 
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. 
BUT THEY JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY 
-- THEY HAVE A STEEL COMPANY 
CALLED GEORGETOWN, IT'S BEEN 
CLOSED FOR FOUR YEARS. 
THEY ANNOUNCED THE DAY BEFORE I 
GOT TO SOUTH CAROLINA THAT 
GEORGETOWN STEEL IS REOPENING 
AND HIRING 600 PEOPLE. 
NOT SO COMPLICATED. 
WE PUT TARIFFS ON SOLAR PANELS 
BECAUSE CHINA WAS FLOODING THE 
MARKET AND IT WASN'T GOOD 
STUFF. 
WE HAD 32 PLANTS, TWO WERE OPEN 
AND THEY WERE BARELY BREATHING. 
THEY WERE ON MOUTH-TO-MOUTH 
RESUSCITATION. 
WE PUT A 30% TAX ON SOLAR 
PANELS COMING INTO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
NOW THOSE TWO PLANTS ARE DOING 
GREAT. 
AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT 
OPENING AT LEAST TEN, 11 OR 12 
AND PROBABLY HAVE THEM ALL OPEN 
VERY SOON. 
AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE HIGH-
QUALITY PANELS AND A LOT OF 
JOBS. 
SAME THING WITH WASHING 
MACHINES. 
SOUNDS SORT OF TACKY, WASHING 
MACHINES, BIG BUSINESS. 
THEY WERE DUMPING -- DIFFERENT 
COUNTRIES -- I DON'T WANT TO 
TELL YOU THIS COUNTRY -- I 
ACTUALLY LIKE THIS COUNTRY BUT 
-- SOMETIMES OUR WORST ENEMIES 
ARE OUR SO-CALLED FRIENDS OR 
ALLIES, RIGHT? 
BUT THEY WERE DUMPING WASHING 
MACHINES. 
PUT A BIG TARIFF ON -- 30% -- 
WE ARE NOW MAKING WALKING -- 
WASHING MACHINES BACK IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING? 
THINK OF IT BECAUSE YOU NEVER 
HEAR THIS FROM THE FAKE NEWS. 
WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING? 
WHAT ELSE? 
WE ARE CREATING JOBS, NUMBER 1, 
AND TAKING IN BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR 
COFFERS. 
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME -- 
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE HAD 
TARIFFS. 
BECAUSE YOU HAD PRESIDENTS LIKE 
PRESIDENT McKINLEY AND ROOSEVELT
AND OTHERS -- ROOSEVELT WON -- 
WHO LIKED THE IDEA OF FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES WHEN THEY COME IN AND 
WANT TO TAKE OUR WEALTH, THEY 
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. 
THEY DON'T TAKE IT. 
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY 
TAKE OUR WEALTH AND WE PROTECT 
THEM WITH OUR MILITARY, WE 
PROTECT EVERYBODY. 
SO WE GET IT EVERY WHICH WAY. 
SO WE WANT TO JUST TELL THOSE 
PEOPLE, NUMBER 1, WE'VE CREATED 
A LOT OF JOBS, NUMBER 2, WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IS WE'RE TAKING IN 
BILLIONS -- LOOK AT THE STEEL, 
WE HAVE A 25% TARIFF, TAKING IN 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, CREATING 
JOBS AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
EVEN IF IT WASN'T PERFECT, WE 
NEED A STEEL INDUSTRY, WE WERE 
GOING TO HAVE NO STEEL PLANTS. 
IF SOMETHING EVER HAPPENED -- 
IF SOMETHING EVER HAPPENED -- 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
-- AND WE NEED STEEL TO MAKE 
THAT SOMETHING -- WE WOULDN'T 
BE ABLE TO MAKE STEEL. 
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME 
INDUSTRIES, STEEL AND ALUMINUM, 
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE IT. 
SO WE HAVE JOBS, WE HAVE A 
VIBRANT INDUSTRY -- THE HEAD OF 
UNITED STATES STEEL CALLED ME 
THE OTHER DAY, AND HE SAID, MR. 
PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU 
-- I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE IT -- WE HAVEN'T OPENED UP 
A NEW PLANT IN 32 YEARS. 
NOW WE ARE OPENING UP SEVEN OF 
THEM. 
SIX OF THEM EXTENSIONS, WE ARE 
GOING TO BUILD A NEW ONE. 
AND THAT'S JUST ONE COMPANY. 
THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION REPORTED
THAT IN JUST THE FIRST 500 DAYS 
OF OUR PRESIDENCY, NOT MY, IT'S 
OUR PRESIDENCY -- LET'S FACE IT 
-- NOT MY PRESIDENCY, YOU ARE 
THE ONE THAT DID IT. 
YOU ARE THE ONE THAT DID IT. 
ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN A GOOD 
STUDENT, I TOLD JOHN AND I TOLD 
THE WHOLE GROUP, WE HAD A GROUP 
OF POLITICIANS BEFORE -- AND 
SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN 
CONGRESSMEN LIKE FOR 25, 30 
YEARS. 
THEY ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS 
ABOUT POLITICS. 
I SAID HAVEN'T WE'VE BEEN DOING 
THIS FOR 2 1/2 YEARS? 
DON'T ASK ME A QUESTION LIKE 
THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN GOOD AND 
STUDENTS HAVEN'T WE? 
ALTOGETHER? 
HAVEN'T WE'VE BEEN GOOD 
STUDENTS? 
BUT THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION 
CAME OUT WITH A REPORT AND THIS 
WAS AS OF TWO MONTHS AGO, WE 
HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED 64% OF 
OUR TOP AGENDA ITEMS, AND 
THAT'S AT A MUCH FASTER PACE 
THAN EVEN RONALD REAGAN. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT? 
>> 
>> AND YOU DON'T HEAR THIS FROM 
THE FAKE NEWS. 
WE'VE CREATED 3.4 MILLION NEW 
JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY, 3.4. 
>> 
>> UNEMPLOYMENT -- THINK OF 
THIS ONE -- UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS 
ARE AT A 45-YEAR LOW AND IT'S 
GOING TO 63, I BELIEVE, PROBABLY
, NEXT MONTH. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
>> 
>> HISPANIC AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT, ALSO IS AT THE 
LOWEST POINT IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY. 
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN, 
WOMEN! 
REMEMBER WE WERE GOING TO DO SO 
POORLY WITH WOMEN? 
LOOK AT ALL THE WOMEN HERE 
TONIGHT, WOMEN FOR TRUMP. 
>> 
>> THEY NEVER TAKE THOSE 
CAMERAS OFF MY FACE. 
LOOK AT ALL THE WOMEN. 
REMEMBER WE WERE GOING TO DO SO 
POORLY WITH WOMEN? 
WE DID GREAT WITH THE WOMEN. 
I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE -- 
MY WIFE TOLD ME, SHE SAID 
YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT WITH 
THE WOMEN. 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT WITH 
THE KIND OF PRESS WE GET. 
DO YOU AGREE? 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY ARE SO SMART. 
WHEN THEY HEAR THOSE NUMBERS, 
THEY ARE HAPPY. 
WHEN YOU HEAR THE NUMBERS, I 
USED TO GO INTO ARENAS AND I 
WOULD READ THE HORRIBLE 
STATISTICS ON CRIME AND 
EDUCATION AND HOW BADLY PEOPLE 
ARE BEING TREATED IN THE 
HISPANIC COMMUNITIES, IN 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMITTEES, 
AND YOU REMEMBER, I WOULD SAY, 
YOU'VE BEEN VOTING FOR 
DEMOCRATS FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. 
YOU HAVE THESE HORRIBLE -- LOOK 
AT MY FRIEND RIGHT THERE --
>> 
>> GREAT GUY. 
MY FRIEND -- THANK YOU. 
YOU'VE HAD THESE HORRIBLE, 
HORRIBLE STATISTICS FOR YEARS 
ON CRIME AND THE EDUCATION, 
ABUSE AND ALL THE THINGS -- AND 
I WENT IN AND I'M READING A 
POINT AFTER POINT THAT I'M 
SEEING AND -- I LOOKED OUT AT 
THE AUDIENCE -- FOR A HUNDRED 
YEARS THEY WERE WITH DEMOCRATS. 
THE DEMOCRATS FELT THEY HAD 
AUTOMATIC VOTES AND I SAID TO 
THEM, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE 
TO LOSE? 
VOTE FOR ME. 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
AND I CAME OFF THE STAGE -- 
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT -- THE 
FIRST TIME I JUST SAID IT -- I 
DIDN'T CARE -- HONESTLY I WANT 
TO SAY WHAT'S RIGHT -- I DON'T 
CARE -- I CAME OFF THE STAGE 
AND MY POLITICAL PEOPLE SAID, 
THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING, WHAT A 
HORRIBLE THING? 
WHEN YOU SAY WHAT THE HELL DO 
YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
THAT'S HORRIBLE -- I SAID BUT 
IT'S TRUE. 
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO 
LOSE? 
NOW I JUST SAID AFRICAN-
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE 
LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY. 
VERY, VERY GREAT. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. 
SO WE KEEP GOING AND WE KEEP 
STRIVING. AND WHEN IT'S ALL 
OVER, NOBODY'S DONE THE JOB 
THAT WE'VE ALL DONE. 
WAGES ARE RISING, YOU KNOW, FOR 
THOSE OF YOU THAT WERE WITH THE 
CAMPAIGN WHICH I THINK WAS 
PROBABLY ABOUT 130% OF YOU -- 
YOU WOULD HEAR ME TALKING ABOUT 
WAGES. 
WHERE A PERSON WOULD HAVE A JOB 
21 YEARS AGO, 19 YEARS AGO FROM 
TWO YEARS WHEN WE WERE DOING 
THE CAMPAIGN -- AND THEY MADE 
MORE MONEY 19 YEARS AGO 
RELATIVELY SPEAKING BY FAR. 
THEN THEY MADE TWO YEARS AGO. 
AND ACTUALLY ONE YEAR AGO. 
THEIR WAGES WERE GOING ALONG 
AND THEY HAD ONE JOB, NOW THEY 
WOULD HAVE TWO AND THREE JOBS. 
THEY WOULD BE WORKING MUCH 
HARDER AND MAKING MUCH LESS 
MONEY. 
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
22 YEARS, WAGES ARE RISING 
AGAIN. 
>> 
>> EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN 
THAT, IS YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF 
JOBS. 
IT'S LIKE THE VA, WE APPROVED 
CHOICE, THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
DO IT FOR 45 YEARS. 
CHOICE! 
>> 
>> YOU HAVE CHOICE IN THE JOB. 
BUT THE VETS -- YOU HAVE GREAT 
VET'S IN NORTH DAKOTA -- VETS! 
VETS! 
VETS! 
REMEMBER I USED TO SAY ABOUT 
THE VETS -- I WASN'T A GREAT 
STUDENT OF THE VETS -- BUT I 
WOULD READ WHERE THE VETS WOULD 
BE ONLINE FOR 13 DAYS, 18 DAYS, 
THREE WEEKS, SEVEN DAYS -- AND 
THEY WOULD START OFF AND THEY 
WOULDN'T BE IN BAD SHAPE. 
AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD TAKE SO 
LONG BEFORE SEEING A DOCTOR 
THAT THEY WOULD BE TERMINALLY 
ILL. 
THINGS THAT COULD'VE BEEN TAKEN 
CARE OF. 
AND I SAID WITHOUT KNOWING 
ANYTHING, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE 
MOST BRILLIANT POLICY I'VE EVER 
HEARD -- I SAID, WHY DON'T THEY 
JUST GO TO A DOCTOR LOCAL 
THAT'S LOOKING FOR THE BUSINESS 
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD 
DOCTOR? 
SPECIFY CERTAIN GREAT DOCTORS, 
GO TO A DOCTOR, BE TAKEN CARE 
OF AND WE WILL PAY THE BILL AND 
WILL BE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND 
YOU'LL BE ALL SET, RIGHT? 
RIGHT? 
>> 
>> RIGHT? 
RIGHT? 
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO 
BRILLIANT. 
I SAID I AM SO SMART. 
I AM THE SMARTEST PERSON. 
MY UNCLE WAS A GREAT PROFESSOR 
AT M.I.T. 
FOR 40 YEARS. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE 40 YEARS? 
I SAID, BUT I'M SMARTER THAN 
HIM. 
I'M SMARTER THAN ANYBODY. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I'LL TELL YOU, I CAME IN AND I 
SAID THAT TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE 
THAT ARE PROFESSIONALS AND 
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE 
VETS FOR A LONG TIME. 
THEY SAID, WE KNOW ABOUT THAT, 
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT FOR 
30 YEARS. 
SO I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS MY 
IDEA BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I WAS 
GOOD AT, I WAS GOOD AT GETTING 
IT DONE. 
WE GOT IT DONE, I SIGNED IT. 
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOOD AT. 
>>  
>> WE GOT IT DONE! 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT 
DONE FOR 40 YEARS! 
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY IDEA. 
THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY IDEA. 
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE ANOTHER 
THING -- ACCOUNTABILITY. 
WITH THE VETS. 
THE VA -- THERE WAS NO 
ACCOUNTABILITY. 
WOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE 
PROJECTED WHETHER IT WAS CIVIL 
SERVICE UNIONS, WHO CARES, THEY 
WERE PROTECTED. 
YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. 
THEY COULD BE SADISTS AND WE 
HAD SADISTS, SICK PEOPLE, 
PEOPLE THAT WOULD STEAL AND 
ROB, WE HAD PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T 
WORK HARD. 
AND THERE WAS NO 
ACCOUNTABILITY. 
FOR 40 YEARS THEY TRIED TO GET 
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
PASSED. 
I GOT IT PASSED AND NOW YOU 
LOOK AT THE GUY THAT DID IT -- 
AND YOU SAY, JIM SMITH, YOU'VE 
DONE A HELL OF A
LOUSY JOB. 
YOU ARE LATE AND YOU DON'T 
TREAT OUR VETS RIGHT. 
JIM, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE FIRED, 
GET OUT OF HERE. 
>>  
>> RIGHT? 
RIGHT? 
YOU'RE FIRED. 
SO THOSE TWO THINGS -- JUST TO 
PROVE TO THEM -- THE 
ACCOUNTABILITY WAS A COUPLE OF 
MONTHS AGO. 
AND JOHN HELPED SO MUCH. 
I TELL YOU, JOHN HELPED SO 
MUCH. 
HE WAS A LEADER. 
THANK YOU. 
HE WAS THE LEADER ON BOTH. 
AND EVERYBODY SAID YOU COULDN'T 
GET ACCOUNTABILITY DONE. 
I SAID WHY? 
TOO MUCH POWER, TOO MANY PEOPLE 
THAT DON'T WANT IT DONE. 
YOU HAD PEOPLE IN ARIZONA THAT 
ROBBED $300,000 AND THEY -- 
THEY AGREED, EVERYBODY AGREED 
THEY ROB THE MONEY, THEY 
COULDN'T FIRE THE PEOPLE. 
SO YOU HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY IS 
DONE. 
AND I THINK EVEN MORE 
IMPORTANT, I'M NOT SURE, BUT 
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, THE VA 
CHOICE. 
SO NOW YOU GO, SEE YOUR DOCTOR 
WHEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT ONLINE, 
OKAY? 
>> 
>> OPTIMISM! 
AMONG AMERICA'S GREAT 
MANUFACTURERS. 
HAS HIT 95%. 
THE HIGHEST NUMBER BY FAR IN 
THE HISTORY OF THE SURVEY, 
WHICH IS A VERY OLD SURVEY. 
WE HAVE ELIMINATED RECORD 
NUMBERS OF JOB KILLING 
REGULATIONS. 
>> 
>> I THINK MAYBE AS IMPORTANT 
AS THE TAX CUTS, ARE THE 
REGULATIONS. 
OUR COUNTRY WAS CHOKING. 
AND LET ME TELL YOU, IF OUR 
OPPONENT, OUR WONDERFUL OPPONENT
-- WHEN IS SHE GOING TO GET 
OVER IT? 
WHEN DOES SHE GET OVER IT? 
OY, WHEN DO THEY GET OVER IT? 
IT IS PRETTY AMAZING, POINT 
AFTER POINT, GUILTY, GUILTY, 
GUILTY, OH, SHE'S OKAY AND THEN 
THEY GO AFTER US FOR A RUSSIAN 
WITCH HUNT HOAX. 
IT'S A HOAX. 
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU 
TALK ABOUT A DOUBLE STANDARD, 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A DOUBLE 
STANDARD, AND NOT EVEN
ET CETERA? 
NOBODY EVEN LOOKS. 
I DON'T THINK. 
UNLESS WE ARE GOING TO BE 
SURPRISED SOMEDAY. 
WE'LL SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT. 
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHAT'S 
HAPPENING IS SOMEWHAT OF A 
MIRACLE BECAUSE WE WEREN'T 
EXPECTED TO WIN. 
EVERY TIME I GO OUT, WE HAVE 
CROWDS LIKE THIS, WE WENT TO 
MICHIGAN, WE WENT TO WISCONSIN, 
BEEN DONE -- I THINK WISCONSIN 
WAS 1952. 
DWIGHT EISENHOWER. 
AND WE WON WISCONSIN. 
>>> I SAID WHY.
LOOK AT THE THE CROWDS, LOOK AT
THE PEOPLE.
LOOK AT THE SIGNS OUTSIDE OF THE
HOUSE.
LOOK AT THE SIGNS.
>> I HEARD.
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT SO THAT BILL
CLINTON, PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON
WENT BACK AND HE WENT THROUGH
MICHIGAN AND HE SAID YOU BETTER
GET PEOPLE OUT TO MICHIGAN
BECAUSE THERE'S A TRUMP-PENCE
SIGN ON EVERY HOUSE.
YOU BETTER GET PEOPLE OUT.
AND THEY SAID OH NO, OUR
STATISTICS SHOW THAT MICHIGAN
CANNOT BE WON BY THE
REPUBLICANS.
WELL LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S
HAPPENED.
CAR PLANTS ARE MOVING INTO
MICHIGAN.
JOBS ARE MOVING INTO MICHIGAN.
MICHIGAN EASE VERY HAPPY WITH
YOUR -- MICHIGAN GA'S VERY HAPPY
WITH YOUR -- MICHIGAN'S VERY
HAPPY WITH YOUR PRESIDENT.
THEY SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO
BILL CLINTON.
AND WE JUST HAD OUR HIGHEST POLL
NUMBERS.
WATCH THE FAKERS BACK THERE.
THEY'LL BE TALKING.
WELL, YOU SAW THE POLLS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE.
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THEY SAID
I WAS AN INTERLOPER.
HOW BAD IS THAT?
AN INTERLOPER.
AND NOW THEY SAY, A COUPLE OF
POLLS THAT HE'S THE MOST
POWERFUL, MOST POPULAR
REPUBLICAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE
PARTY.
AND A LITTLE WHILE AGO I WAS AN
INTERLOPER.
THEY CAME OUT MORE POPULAR THAN
A MAN I LIKE, RONALD REAGAN.
THINK OF IT, YOU GO FROM
INTERLOPER.
THAT'S A HORRIBLE TERM, RIGHT?
I WAS JUST DOING MY THING.
I'M NOT AN INTERLOPER.
BUT WE HAVE TREMENDOUS -- LOOK
AT THE PEOPLE WE ENDORSED.
DAN DONOVAN.
HE WAS BEHIND.
WE ENDORSED HIM.
HE WON BY LIKE 24 POINTS OR
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT IN STATEN
ISLAND, NEW YORK, AND NEW YORK
GENERALLY.
DAN DON VAN, CONGRESSMAN --
DONOVAN, CONGRESSMAN.
LAST NIGHT WE HAD A GREAT
EVENING BECAUSE WE WATCHED THAT
TELEVISION AND WE WERE WINNING
LEFT AND RIGHT.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED.
AND ONE OF MY BIGGEST CRITICS, A
SLOVENLY MAN NAMED JOE CROWLEY
GOT HIS ASS KICKED.
BY A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD A LOT
OF ENERGY.
SHE HAD A LOT OF ENERGY.
I GUESS HE DIDN'T SEE IT.
THEY COULDN'T FIND HIM.
HE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY.
HE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF MONEY
LEFT OVER.
HE WAS GOING TO TAKE NANCY
PELOSI'S PLACE.
AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED
BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP NANCY
PELOSI RIGHT WHERE SHE IS WITH
MAXINE WATERS.
I WANT TO KEEP NANCY PELOSI,
PLEASE, I WANT TO MAKE A PLEA TO
MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T
REMOVE NANCY PELOSI.
SHE SHOULD BE WHERE SHE IS.
AND PLEASE KEEP MAXINE WATERS ON
THE AIR AS YOUR FACE AND YOUR
MOUTHPIECE FOR THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY.
PLEASE.
MAXINE AND NANCY.
SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN A WAY
WHEN HE GOT BEATEN BECAUSE HE
WAS GOING TO TAKE HER PLACE I
THINK.
NOW HE'S JUST LOOKING AT US AND
SAYING DARLING, WHAT HAPPENED?
POLITICS IS A MEAN GAME, ISN'T
IT?
IT'S A MEAN -- IT'S A FLEETING
GAME.
SIX MONTHS AGO REPUBLICANS
PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND
REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
OUR PLAN DOUBLED THE CHILD TAX
CREDIT THANK YOU TO IVANKA
TRUMP.
SHE WANTED THAT SO BADLY.
SHE REALLY GOT TO BE A PEST.
DAD, YOU'VE GOT TO GET CHILD TAX
CREDIT.
I SAID, DARLING, NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT IT IS.
SHE SAID THE WOMEN KNOW, DAD.
THE WOMEN KNOW.
MY DAUGHTER AND MY WIFE,
MELANIA, THEY LOVE THE WOMEN.
AND THE WOMEN LOVE THEM.
THE WOMEN LOVE THEM.
AND THE MEN LOVE THEM.
CHILD TAX CREDIT.
PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT THAT
MUCH.
IT'S VERY SUBSTANTIAL.
AND YOU KNOW WE GOT IT FOR YOU.
WE SLASHED TAXES FOR WO
FAMILIES, MOST OF THEM IN HALF,
AND SAVED OUR FAMILY FARMS AND
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BY
ELIMINATING THE ESTATE TAX IN
ALMOST ALL CASES.
IT'S KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX.
AND NOW WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR
SMALL BUSINESS OR YOUR FARM YOU
LEAVE IT TO YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR
CHILDREN DON'T GO HAVE TO --
THEY DON'T GO TO THE BANK,
BORROW MONEY, AND END UP LOSING
THE FARM OR LOSING THE BUSINESS.
AND KEVIN AND JOHN, THE WHOLE
GROUP THEY HELPED US A LOT.
AND GUESS WHAT?
HEIDI VOTED AGAINST IT.
OKAY?
SHE VOTED AGAINST IT.
HEIDI VOTED AGAINST IT.
AND SHE'S ALWAYS GOING TO VOTE
AGAINST.
SHE MAY GIVE US A COUPLE OF
QUICKIE VOTES, YOU KNOW, BEFORE
THE ELECTION.
SHE MIGHT.
BECAUSE SHE HAS NO CHOICE.
BUT THE DAY AFTER THAT ELECTION
SHE'S VOTING PARTY LINE 100%.
MORE THAN 100 UTILITY COMPANIES
NATIONWIDE HAVE SLASHED PRICES
FOR CUSTOMERS.
SAVING THEM AND THIS COUNTRY
MUCH MORE THAN $3 BILLION WHICH
GOES AND REDUCES YOUR ELECTRIC
AND UTILITY BILLS.
HEIDI AND EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT
VOTED AGAINST OUR TAX CUTS.
WE'RE ALSO FIXING THE DISASTROUS
TRADE DEALS THAT HAVE PLUNDERED
OUR WEALTH, GUTTED OUR
COMMUNITIES, UNDERMINED OUR
GREAT FARMERS, TAKEN OUR JOBS.
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE TRADE FAIR
AND RECIPROCAL.
RECIPROCAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THEY DO IT TO US.
WE DO IT TO THEM.
AND WE ARE PLACING VERY BIG
TARIFFS ON SOME OF THESE
COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE
TARIFFS ON US.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
I WONDER WHERE THESE PEOPLE COME
FROM.
EVEN POLITICIANS.
SO WE'LL HAVE A COUNTRY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CAN ALMOST NAME ANY OF THEM.
THEY HAVE MASSIVE TARIFFS ON OUR
PEOPLE.
ON OUR WORKERS, ON OUR FARMERS,
ON OUR COUNTRY, ON OUR
COMPANIES.
SO WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO PUT
TARIFFS ON THEM.
AND I'LL HAVE POLITICIANS AND
OTHER PEOPLE COME TO ME, OH
PLEASE, WE WANT FREE TRADE.
HOW IS IT FREE TRADE?
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
CHINA, IF WE MAKE A CAR AND SELL
IT INTO CHINA THEY CHARGE US A
25% TAX.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, 25%.
WHEN THEY MAKE A CAR AND SELL IT
INTO THE UNITED STATES, AND
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM, WE
CHARGE THE GRAND TOTAL OF 2.5%
AND THEY DON'T PAY THAT.
AND THEN WHEN I WANT TO RAISE
THE GAME AND PLAY THE GAME OF
POKER, A GAME THAT WE CAN'T
LOSE, I'LL GET EVEN POLITICIANS,
MOSTLY DEMOCRATINGS, BUT EVEN A
COUPLE -- DEMOCRATS, BUT EVEN A
COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS.
THEY'LLSAY WE WANT FREE TRADE.
THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE.
IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.
JUST PLAY THE GAME FOR A LITTLE
WHILE.
IT'S A GAME WE CAN'T LOSE.
I'VE SAID A COUPLE OF TIMES,
WHEN WE'RE $500 BILLION DOWN
THEY SAY TRUMP IS STARTING A
TRADE WAR.
I SAY, NO, THE TRADE WAR ENDED A
LONG TIME AGO.
AND THE UNITED STATES LOST
BECAUSE OUR LEADERS DIDN'T TAKE
CARE OF OUR PEOPLE AND OUR
COMPANIES.
SO WE'RE NOT STARTING A TRADE
WAR, BUT WE'LL FINISH IT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IN THE END, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN?
AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING,
ALREADY HAPPENING.
THEY'RE GOING TO COME TO US.
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HEY,
LET'S WORK IT OUT.
AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK IT OUT.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
BUT REMEMBER, IT IS, IT'S THE
ART OF THE DEAL.
ANYBODY CAN DO THE DEAL.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
THIS ONE DOESN'T GET MUCH
SIMPLER.
REMEMBER, IT'S TRUE, WHEN YOU'RE
$500 BILLION DOWN YOU CAN'T
LOSE.
YOU ALREADY LOST.
BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO START
WINNING.
OR AT LEAST WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
IT FAIR.
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO -- WE
GOT TO MAKE IT FAIR.
AND THE FACT IS WE'VE HAD
PRESIDENTS AND WE'VE HAD LEADERS
THAT WORKED FOR THOSE PRESIDENTS
NEGOTIATORS, TRADE REPS, WHO
WERE MISSING IN ACTION.
THEY WEREN'T DOING THEIR JOB.
I WAS DEALT A LOT OF BAD HANDS.
I WAS GIVEN NORTH KOREA WHERE,
FRANKLY, WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO
GOING TO WAR.
YOU COULD HAVE LOST 30 MILLION
PEOPLE.
50 MILLION PEOPLE.
SEOUL IS 30 MILES OFF THE
BORDER.
THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL
CANNONS.
THEY HAVE CANNONS, THOUSANDS OF
THEM, POINTED.
I HAD THE MEETING.
WE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.
WE HAD A GREAT CHEMISTRY
TOGETHER.
THE FAKE NEWS WAS SO UPSET WHEN
I SAID WE HAD A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP.
WE HAD A GOOD CHEMISTRY.
THEY SAID THAT'S A HORRIBLE
THING.
NO, NO.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
GETTING ALONG WITH COUNTRIES.
GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA.
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA.
GETTING ALONG WITH THESE
COUNTRIES IS A GOOD THING.
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.
AND SO WE HAVE THINGS COOKING
NOW.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY.
BUT WHEN PEOPLE RUSH IT, YOU
KNOW, IT'S LIKE RUSHING THE
TURKEY OUT OF THE STOVE.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS GOOD.
THE WOMEN CAN TELL ME, AND SOME
OF THE MEN, SEE I HAVE TO BE
POLITICALLY CORRECT.
SEE IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULD HAVE
NEVER SAID -- I WOULD HAVE SAID
IT'S TOO HOKE KI.
BUT IT'S -- HOKEY.
BUT IT'S TRUE.
SOME OF THE MEN CAN TELL ME TOO.
SOME OF THE MEN.
BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO.
THE MORE WE RUSH THE WORSE IT'S
GOING TO BE.
THE LONGER WE TAKE THE BETTER
YOUR FARMERS, YOUR PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO BE GREAT.
YOU KNOW, JONG AND KEVIN GAVE --
JOHN AND KEVIN GAVE ME
SOMETHING.
CANADIAN WHEAT.
MARKETS CONSISTENTLY
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES WHEAT BY GRADING IT AS
FEED.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
THEY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THAT
MEANS.
I JUST KNOW THAT IT'S A BAD
DEAL.
WHAT IN THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
YEAH.
BUT IT'S TRUE.
CANADA CHARGES US ON DAIRY
PRODUCTS A TARIFF OF 275% FOR
YOUR FARMERS IN HERE.
200.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING WE DON'T WANT
YOUR DAIRY PRODUCT.
IT'S NO GOOD.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING WE DON'T WANT
NORTH DAKOTA, WISCONSIN, NEW
YORK STATE WE DON'T WANT YOU TO
-- 275%, AND I ACTUALLY HEAR
THAT'S AN OLD NUMBER.
THEY RAISED IT A NUMBER OF
MONTHS AGO TO 300%.
HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT?
AND THEN JUSTIN GETS UP.
HE SAID WE FOUGHT WORLD WAR I,
WORLD WAR II TOGETHER.
ALL TRUE.
WE LOVE CANADA.
BUT THEY'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
US.
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.
THE ERA OF GLOBAL FREE LOADING
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
UNITED STATES IS OVER.
IT'S JUST OVER.
IT'S OVER.
WE'RE ALSO RESTORING AMERICAN
SECURITY BY REBUILDING OUR
MILITARY.
WE'VE SECURED A HISTORIC $700
BILLION JUST GOT IT APPROVED.
$700 BILLION WE'RE REBUILDING
OUR MILITARY.
AND NEXT YEAR, ALREADY APPROVED,
$716 BILLION, WE'RE REBUILDING
OUR MILITARY.
IT WILL BE BIGGER AND STRONGER
THAN EVER BEFORE.
AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL NEVER HAVE
TO USE IT BECAUSE WHEN IT'S
BIGGER AND STRONGER, YOU TEND
NOT TO HAVE TO USE IT, OKAY?
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE GOT
$6 BILLION FOR DRUGS AND
FIGHTING OPIOID ABUSE.
$6 BILLION.
WE BELIEVE IN PEACE.
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE PEACE THROUGH
STRENGTH NOT WEAKNESS.
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.
AND I'VE DIRECTED THE PENTAGON
TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CREATING
A SIXTH BRANCH OF THE UNITED
STATES ARMED FORCES CALLED THE
SPACE FORCE.
THE SPACE FORCE.
SPACE FORCE.
BECAUSE SPACE IS THE NEW
FRONTIER.
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
GOING UP TO THE MOON AND GOING
TO MARS.
AND I WANT THE RICH GUYS.
WE HAVE RICH GUYS, THEY LOVE
THESE ROCKETS.
LEASE THEM TO LAND, CHARGE THEM
A LOT.
THEY WANT TO SEND ROCKETS.
I LOOK AT IT WITH BEZOS, ELON
MUSK.
THEY ALL LOVE ROCKETS.
I SAID THAT'S OKAY.
LET THEM SEND A ROCKET TO MARS.
I HOPE THEY GO FAST.
LET'S HELP THEM.
LET'S MAKE IT REALLY GOOD FOR
THEM.
AND IF THEY DO IT, WE'RE GOING
TO CLAIM IT ON THE BEHALF OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WE'LL GIVE THEM NO CREDIT.
LET THEM SPEND THE MONEY, I
THINK IT'S GREAT.
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF MILITARY
GUYS AND SPACE FROM A MILITARY
STANDPOINT IS REALLY THE NEW
FRONTIER.
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPACE
FORCE.
EVERY DAY WE ARE KEEPING OUR
PROMISES.
BUT TO KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING
WE NEED KEVIN KRAMER IN THE
SENATE.
ALL OF US TONIGHT ARE UNITED BY
THE SAME TIRELESS VALUES.
WE HAVE PRIDE IN OUR HISTORY,
RESPECT FOR OUR GREAT,
BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL AMERICAN
FLAG, RIGHT?
WE PUT OUR HANDS IN OUR -- ON
OUR HEARTS FOR THE PLEDGE OF
ALLEGIANCE, AND WE PROUDLY STAND
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM, RIGHT?
PROUDLY STAND.
IN EVERYTHING WE DO WE ARE
STANDING UP FOR OUR CITIZENS.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR AMERICA.
AND WE ARE STANDING UP FOR NORTH
DAKOTA, THANK YOU.
THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF
OUR COUNTRY ARE FORGOTTEN NO
MORE.
NO MORE.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ALL
CAME FROM.
AND BY THE WAY, OUR PEOPLE, THEY
CALL IT THE BASE.
THEY USED TO SAY IT'S 35%, THEN
THEY SAID IT'S 40%.
THEN THEY SAID IT'S 42%.
AND WE'RE DRIVING THEM CRAZY.
NOW THEY SAY IT'S OVER 50%.
AND THEN THEY SAID SOME GREAT
PEOPLE.
THEY SAID ANY TIME TRUMP GETS A
POLL ADD 12 TO IT.
AND DO YOU EVER NOTICE, I HATE
IT, I MEET THESE PEOPLE, THEY
CALL THEM THE ELITE.
THESE PEOPLE.
I LOOK AT THEM.
I SAY, THAT'S ELITE?
WE GOT MORE MONEY.
WE GOT MORE BRAINS.
WE GOT BETTER HOUSES,
APARTMENTS.
WE GOT BETTER BOATS.
WE'RE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE.
AND THEY SAY THE ELITE.
WE'RE THE ELITE.
YOU'RE THE ELITE.
WE'RE THE ELITE.
SO I SAID THE OTHER DAY, LET'S
KEEP CALLING THESE PEOPLE -- AND
LOOK, LET'S FACE IT.
THEY'VE BEEN STONE COLD LOSERS.
THE ELITE.
THE ELITE.
SO LET'S LET THEM KEEP CALLING
THEMSELVES THE ELITE.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO CALL
OURSELVES, AND REMEMBER, YOU ARE
INDEED, YOU WORK HARDER, BUT YOU
ARE INDEED SMARTER THAN THEM.
LET'S CALL OURSELVES FROM NOW ON
THE SUPER ELITE.
WE'RE THE SUPER ELITE.
WE ARE THE SUPER ELITE.
YOU ARE THE PEOPLE WHO FARM THE
PRAIRIE, TAME THE BADLANDS, AND
SQUEEZE OIL OUT OF ROCK.
IT'S TRUE.
YOU CELEBRATE YOUR HERITAGE, AND
YOU LIVE LIFE PROUDLY UNDER THE
BIG BEAUTIFUL SKIES.
AND YOU HAVE THE BIG BEAUTIFUL
SKIES OUT HERE.
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED
REBUILD THIS COUNTRY.

OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING POWER TO
THE EVERYDAY SMART, BRILLIANT,
WONDERFUL, HARD WORKING AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
WE ARE STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS
OF THE AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO
SETTLED THE FRONTIER, SCALED THE
ROCKIES, AND WON THE AMERICAN
WEST.
THESE ARE GREAT, INCREDIBLE,
STRONG, TOUGH, TOUGH PEOPLE.
THIS STATE WAS FORGED BY PIONEER
MEN AND WOMEN WHO BRAVE THE COLD
AND TAME THE WILDERNESS TO BUILD
A HOME ON THE PLAINS AND A LIFE
FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
AND IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE
LIFE.
THESE NORTH DAKOTA PIONEERS WERE
TOUGH AS HELL AND THEY WERE
STRONG AND THEY WERE SMART.
AND THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN
COMMON.
THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES.
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRIES.
AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD.
THEY NEVER GAVE UP.
AND THEY NEVER EVER GAVE IN.
AND NEITHER WILL WE.
WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR
OUR COUNTRY, OUR FAMILIES, AND
WE WILL NEVER EVER STOP FIGHTING
FOR OUR FREEDOM.
AS LONG AS WE ARE PROUD OF WHO
WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING
FOR, WE WILL NEVER EVER FAIL.
WITH YOUR HELP, WITH YOUR VOICE,
WITH YOUR VOTE WE WILL WIN, WIN,
WIN.
LIKE WE'RE DOING.
REMEMBER HOW I STARTED.
THIS COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY, OUR
FLAG.
WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN ALL OVER
THE WORLD THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
US.
LEADERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
THEY CALL ME OR THEY COME TO THE
OVAL OFFICE.
AND THEY SAY CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. PRESIDENT, ON THE INCREDIBLE
JOB WITH THE ECONOMY.
THE INCREDIBLE JOB YOU'RE DOING
WITH YOUR COUNTRY.

RESPECTED AGAIN.
CONGRATULATIONS, MR. PRESIDENT.

HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE, AND

AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
