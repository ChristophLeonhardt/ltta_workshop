DO WE TAKE HIM LITERALLY OR SERIOUSLY OR NEITHER?

148
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,551
SERIOUSLY OR NEITHER? BUT AT THE TIME HE WAS TELLING

00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,486
BUT AT THE TIME HE WAS TELLING US THAT DRAIN THE WATCH WAS A

150
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:45,187
US THAT DRAIN THE WATCH WAS A SLOGAN TO HIM.

151
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:48,858
SLOGAN TO HIM. HE WOULD TELL THE CROWDS AT THE

152
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:49,559
HE WOULD TELL THE CROWDS AT THE RALLIES I DIDN’T LIKE DRAINING

LIKED IT. MAYBE IT MADE SENSE TO PEOPLE

159
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,367
MAYBE IT MADE SENSE TO PEOPLE AND IT WAS BELIEVABLE BECAUSE HE

160
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,269
AND IT WAS BELIEVABLE BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING THE OUTSIDER’S
