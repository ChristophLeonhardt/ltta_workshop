00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,208
HERE'S ANOTHER.

8
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,910
MONEY IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF

POLITICS.

10
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:13,411

CAMPAIGN SEASON.

16
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,853
>> AS DEMOCRATS TRY TO MOUNT

17
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:23,855
A BLUE WAVE, SOME REPUBLICAN

18
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:24,856
STRATEGISTS ARE DEALING WITH

19
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:27,225
A RED ALERT.

20
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:28,359
THAT'S BECAUSE COMMITTEES

00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,402
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE FEWER

28
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:38,870
DEMOCRATIC SENATE HOPEFULS,

29
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,871
THEIR CAMPAIGNS ARE RAKING

30
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,172
IN MORE THAN REPUBLICANS.

31
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:42,640
SAME STORY IN HOUSE RACES

32
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,242
WHERE THE NATIONAL

FIGHT.

39
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:52,917
BUT THE G.O.P. KNOWS IT'S A

00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:03,361
BE CLOSE.

DEMOCRAT THROUGH TO THE

50
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:10,535
GENERAL.

51
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:12,136
>> A BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE

52
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:13,338

53
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:15,273
ALMOST DOUBLE THE DNC'S

54
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:15,573
TOTAL.

55
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,408
THAT'S A DEFICIT THE DNC

56
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:17,809

OUTRAISED OUR PARTY.

59
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:22,914
AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

60
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,816
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS,

61
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,184
IT'S ABOUT BEING CLEAR HOW

62
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:29,320
DO WE FIND MORE WAYS TO

63
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,921
MOBILIZE ITSELF.

64
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,622
THE REPUBLICANS OUTRAISE US
