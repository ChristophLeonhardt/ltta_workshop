Peter Wang would never ELISA all hada would never Jaime Guttenberg would never meadow Pollack would never and I say to them the real disruption to the educational process it's staring down the barrel of a gun we need change yes I am a parking survivor and an MST student but before this I was a regular black girl and after this I am still black and I'm still regular good morning and welcome to am joy we are live in Washington DC where on Saturday America witnessed one of the largest mass protests in US history emma gonzales amplified the voices of 800,000 of her peers gathered in front of her by standing in silence for 6 minutes and 20 seconds she said that that was the length of time it took for 17 of her classmates in school staffers to be killed on february 14th in parkland Florida for those six minutes and 20 seconds she made the nation stop and sit with the trauma of loss and absence her silence was deafening in part because for the last 39 days since the shootings in their hometown of parkland Florida Emma and her activist classmates have been so vocal in their demands for change and to local and national gun policy they organized they got a gun reform bill passed in Florida and they've begun chipping away at the power of the NRA all while making sure to include the voices and opinions of people whose suffering and trauma in the face of gun violence in their own communities four years has gone unheard despite the suggestions by some adults that they're too young or uninformed and not prepared to be on air or maybe even crisis actors are paid actors these kids assembled in hundreds of cities around the world to take the baton and give us all a message to the leaders skeptics and cynics who told us to sit down and say stay silent wait your turn welcome to the revolution since this movement began people have asked me do you think any change is going to come from this look around we are the change here with me now is Matt post a high school student from Montgomery County Maryland who spoke yesterday at the March in DC so Matt tell us um you know for those who may have missed it and this was incredible I mean it was you could just feel the energy there eight hundred thousand plus people just in Washington DC alone what was your mess which to that assembled crowd into the world we want change and if this Congress isn't willing to pass comprehensive gun control on November 6 2018 we will elect a new Congress to get it done yeah and you are a student member of the Board of Education of Montgomery County Schools we know that Maryland the Maryland area wasn't in Baltimore suffered a school shooting in the interim in these last 39 days so that it hasn't even stopped what concrete changes do you think would prevent another mass shooting or another shooting in schools or indeed anywhere because they're happening in theaters and concerts and nightclubs and everywhere else I think something really important to acknowledge that these shootings are not just happening in schools and they're not just mass shootings there are these silent tragedies that are happening every single day that aren't making the news but but we have a very specific list of demands we want a ban on semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines we want to raise the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and we want actual investments in our mental health supports as a country ya know so you're 18 right yes you seem pretty mature to me you're on your way to college I'm you theoretically could be drafted we were talking to break about John Bolton being our new national security adviser a lot of people on the nra side say why shouldn't mature young man like yourself be able to buy an ar-15 by a gun if you want because not everyone is at the the same level that I am or at the Parkland kids are any of these incredible kids and we need to put as many barriers as possible between crazy people and guns and I think raising the age is just one way to do that yeah and is this going to be a voting issue for you now that you are a voting age yes I'm gonna be taking out my anger and despair on the ballot and I will never cast a vote for anybody who's taken a cent from the NRA so you want politicians who are completely free of NRA in every money yep free of NRA money and any influence from the gun lobby do your parents and grandparents feel that way absolutely and do they feel that way because you have influenced them to feel that where were they were they already on that side I like to think that I push a little further to the left than they started off yeah because I mean we do know the kids have mind control over the grandparents complete control over your grandparents you know I because I wonder if there is a multiplier effect from kids like you because the reality is that you have a lot of gun owning families parents who are giving their guns kids as gifts as presents or sometimes a swaging what they think are their problems unfortunately that happened in the case of the Sandy Hook massacre that the mother had actually given him guns thinking that would you know a swage him so what do you say to those families who have a culture of gun ownership in them and are saying that we think that you are trying to oppose something that's for our family part of our culture is that enjoyment from guns more valuable than someone's life I just don't buy it I think what's powerful about students marching and protesting is that we are highlighting the the gross inhumanity of this issue we are putting it in concrete terms it's our life or your gun yeah all right well I want to say we're gonna bring in our panel we have AJ Dione of the Washington Post of course great columns of Washington Post Michelle Bernard president of the Barnard Center from women politics and public policy and in the remote Kate and Dawson our friend and national Republican consultant and I'll just I'll throw it out to everyone and just get your impressions of the March itself eg I know you and I were on the same flight coming over what were your impressions of the March and of these young people that are really sort of taking command well I was wandering around the whole crowd all that pretty much all day and it was one of the most moving experiences I've had in politics I mean he took young people to shake up a blocked and stale debate it took young people to move us off often very weird Second Amendment abstractions to say this is about thousands of deaths that did not have to happen and I thought you saw it in sort of the themes of this in different speeches Emma Gonzales reminding us of the seriousness why people were there that long silence was so powerful and they only Wadler an 11-year old saying that this is a multiracial movement reminding us of all the inner-city kids who were killed so gun control is no longer a suburban issue yet the way it was cast and then Cameron casket Matt again today laying out very concrete demands this is not about oh we want something vague no there were very specific demands about background checks and a ban on assault weapons and and the like and then lastly it was very political there is too much kind of false equivalence oh they're all to blame they're all the same no it was vote them out was one of the most popular Cheers and the them was anybody who stands against saying gun laws and the attacks on the NRA and their influence in the debate and just as matt said if they take out our a money we're not going to take them well that came up over and over again so there was a practical set of demands and a clear sense of what needed to be done politically to get it done yeah and Michelle it was an incredibly sort of intersectional argument that was being made what was interesting was that we had this sort of meta debate early on when the Parkland kids came forward because they appear to be white kids right but some of them are Hispanic I should say that in Florida and some of them are black right and we were you know able to meet some of those kids as well 25 percent of the school according to david hog is african-american so but that was all blurred yesterday that was all gone there were kids from Chicago there were kids from all over the country and the kids themselves have organized it that way and it was that's what I found to be so beautiful and extraordinary I got there about two hours before it started and we stayed the entire day I was there with both of my kids and some of their friends all day long and the the kids themselves are so egalitarian and standing in the crowd I thought this is the best of America the the racial divide that we have seen since this last election was completely non-existent yesterday I cannot tell you how many white people I saw holding signs and buttons that said black lives matter or the the young woman who was a white student who spoke yesterday from the stage and she's and she drew attention to the fact that it was the eighth floor of the kids at the school that drew this national attention but brought everybody back to Chicago and to all of the students who have been losing their lives for for many many years in Chicago I just thought was an absolutely extraordinary moment in history I was so honored to be able to be there yesterday and be with my kids and with children like you yeah absolutely and Katyn you know I have to ask you about the politics here because man has brought it up EJ brought it up as well this was a very political March results a huge March more people than were at the Trump inauguration the numbers have you arrived at healty he'll deny that I'm sure hidden tweet about the March but the numbers have been run about 800,000 people in DC versus maybe 600,000 who went to his inauguration about 1.8 million to Barack Obama's inauguration and they are being very pointed in their message no NRA money which means basically every Republican in Congress who take lots and lots and lots of NRA money are in the crosshairs about for Democrats is this a concern now that the Republican Party needs to take seriously I'm not sure if the concerns there yet first I applaud Matt and his friends and and and and and his compatriots there were 3,000 of them in Columbia South Carolina yesterday on the State House steps that's where politicians come from movements like this is where they come from it's it's say right we will join you and I we watched it during the Vietnam War you can study Civil Rights and see where these organic movements come from on issues and and they're on the right issue and they're over the right target is it going to matter in the 2018 election it'll matter when they show up and they hold up their parents to voting IDs and they hold up their ability to say I can move votes because the majority of the protesters yesterday are not 18 years old so will it impact the 2018 election will it stop people from taking contributions from the NRA I doubt that but but what it will do is spawn a new generation of folks who want to enter the political discourse most Republican and Democrats because that's it's I know we try to make this a partisan issue what I find energized and exciting is this many young people are coming out making a statement against something they believe and are passionate in they're putting a whole litany of choices of what they want as far as gun control and the move politicians are going to have to move votes and so I think it's organic I hope and ejl understand this I hope it doesn't become hostile in to a paid political campaigns where the money and the consultants get involved and all of a sudden they become more than one issue and double issues and get used for this effort that's all that's what the NRA literally is I mean the NRA marshals millions and millions and millions of dollars in paid political campaigns for their you know to sell more guns for the gun industry I mean the NRA is already doing that I want to let the panel in because it is already part is it and I have to say and I respectfully disagree in one sense when we were walking in yesterday I was watching I mean thousands you were there thousands of students walking in and there were kids there who were handing out stickers with the year that you are old enough to vote my children for the first time had to sit down and figure out what year they could vote and they put their stickers on they are generating thousands and thousands of new voters matt is 18 a lot of his classmates are 18 or 17 you can't exactly and they're gonna vote in the midterm elections and kids were registering to vote yesterday I think we're going to see an enormous title Matt really quick and then you do Matt really quick well I don't buy the the whole argument that Republicans shouldn't be scared because a lot of the people are under 18 those kids are gonna get to 18 eventually and Congress is they're gonna get it done now or we will vote them out later yeah I just want to say first god bless Katyn a political consultant calling out the sins of political kids those 3,000 people in Columbia South Carolina cuz one of the things it gets less attention because they're not media centers this wasn't just a blue state urban thing these marches all over the Oklahoma City there was this okay it was in I think it was in Oklahoma it was a huge crowd and these folks were very conscious of the election about every 20 feet when I was walking along there there was somebody with a registration clipboard and they were saying this is not about today this is about November and that's where I think the danger the Republican say yes simply because of where they have stood on this issue for the last twenty years I thought one of the most dangerous things I saw yesterday for a Republican in office was the student who said how much money Marco Rubio got from the NRA and did quick division and said how much each child's life was long one dollar five cent exactly and said you know you lot Marco Rubio we lost $17 on February 14th it was an arresting moment and if I were a member of Congress taking money from the NRA that would that alone we were absolutely shocked do you think about that one of the biggest marches was in Denver Colorado Colorado of course a very important swing state people are being very pointed about registering voters including voto Latino that's out there Tom Stiers group was out there registering young people to vote Florida which was the epicenter of this he had 15,000 people marching just in parkland Florida this is a voting issue and you know respectfully disagree with you my friend it is being directed squarely at Republicans the biggest recipient of NRA money is one Ted Cruz who's facing a guy named beta O'Rourke who is making this an issue this is going to be an issue in November for Republicans I answered the question would it be an issue in 2018 and I asked it analytically is will that is there enough time will there be enough people registered to vote will the the organic movement last until November it could it's a big 2020 and 2024 issue because what these young people are missing is if I don't vote you out guess what I'm gonna be running against you there's there's another talking point for them because we're gonna get some politicians out of these rallies and we're gonna get some future politicians but my question was is there enough time in 2018 to amass enough votes on the ballot to on this issue certainly it has already driven the issue into the public's conversation but my question professionally was will there be enough votes in 2018 for this to vote people out of office I don't think so Joey I think 2020 2024 there's a lot down the road and we'll be able to see when we have this conversation the third week in November I don't know about that I'm gonna give Matt the last word we have 226 days until November 6 2018 and the March was a beginning it was not the end we're just getting started all right thank you very much my post great to meet you EJ Michelle and Kate will be backing up next door me Daniels yes it is it's Trump ready for what she's gonna reveal hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
