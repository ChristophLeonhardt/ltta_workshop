00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
hi guys so in an effort to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible this year I just set up</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,109
automatic monthly contributions to my

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,019
Roth IRA but I kind of hate that I'm the

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,570
kind of person who thinks about my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roth</font>

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,790
IRA because saving for your retirement

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,630
is so not punk rock not that it's not

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,760
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because my account is making</font>

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that coin right now but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes being</font>

10
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,529
responsible kind of makes me feel itchy

11
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,660
all over and so in order to cleanse my

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,990
system I need to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stupidest i have ever spent</font>

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,870
money on first was a metallic silver

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,540
snap back<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on as a joke an</font>

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,370
American Apparel but then I thought hey

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,100
maybe I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of person who can</font>

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,050
rock this so I bought it and every time

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,000
I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in my apartment I thought only</font>

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,489
that time that I looked so freaking cool

21
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,230
then I put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head and I realized</font>

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,710
no i<font color="#E5E5E5"> am not that cool in any way</font>

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,530
whatsoever ward outside exactly zero

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,930
times in like the two years i had it

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,030
before it took it to Goodwill another

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,400
example when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,070
website recently got so panicked about

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,010
it that I made a multitude of stupid

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,229
decisions with my money the domain name

30
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,450
I wanted wasn't available but there's

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,460
like nothing on the page it's just blank

32
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,070
so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service but said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,630
they would try and track down the owners

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">and buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me i'm pretty sure i paid</font>

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,000
90 bucks for an automatic email to come

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,490
to me every week for two months saying

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,860
nothing had happened though for all I

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,049
know they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> even tried here's</font>

39
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one then the big picture was</font>

40
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,770
really minor but it still matters to me

41
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,150
because of how utterly gem it was once i

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,670
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in sephora and i decided to treat</font>

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,540
myself to a $12<font color="#E5E5E5"> lip balm twelve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

44
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,670
not a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but lip balm is</font>

45
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,040
something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get literally for</font>

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,549
like a dollar fifty and his lip balm

47
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,020
totally blew that wasn't the dumb part

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,440
though

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,900
the real ideas he came when like six

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,270
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> later I saw the lip balm again</font>

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,360
and I thought man maybe I was wrong

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,539
about it I mean the packaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so cute</font>

53
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,340
so it must be good right and i bought it

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,640
again and it was still terrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> sparrows</font>

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">148 dollars that it will never have back</font>

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,540
but thank God because if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to regret I guess I'm pretty</font>
