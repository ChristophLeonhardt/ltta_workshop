version of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was time</font>

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bring back the pigtails and yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font>

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize i look about five you talk about</font>

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,670
glacial activity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,710
with the weathering and erosion there

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,389
are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of fundamental things that</font>

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">was awry in erosion that you have to</font>

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,220
remember first is that water expands by

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,080
nine percent when it freezes and that's

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,119
really important for everything related

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,920
to grace's the second thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,210
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the erosion would even happen</font>

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,429
we're not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of vast shattering</font>

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,289
and for shattering happens when wood

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,630
enters a crack in a large bulk of rock

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,270
when it freezes and then expands by nine

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,710
percent strain and pressure is applied

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,690
onto the rock until eventually after

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,120
many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years rock itself will break</font>

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,129
apart and this weather drop feeds all

22
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,289
the processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of illusion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dilatation</font>

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,239
crash release also called stress and

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,010
loading is another form of weathering

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,840
after you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had loads and loads of</font>

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,879
years before shattering a lot of rock is

27
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,039
lost from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> surface of any given mass</font>

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,750
pressure is released on the underlying

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,270
layers which allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand</font>

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,370
due to the recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> oppression because of</font>

31
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,809
all the rocks they've been a Porsche at

32
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,309
it to the rock looks like it's peeling

33
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,530
and this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

34
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,360
elastic properties so it can't thank

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,549
since it just cracks brushed chattering

36
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,020
provides a material that allows the

37
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,030
process of abrasion to a car which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

38
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,970
process of erosion abrasion is works in

39
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,470
similar way as it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> in rivers it's</font>

40
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,990
all aware of like drainage basins in

41
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,180
general and stuff basically it's this

time a sandpapering effect driven by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

43
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">movement and the weight of glacial ice</font>

in this hair is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to annoy me on the</font>

45
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,479
whole it produces smooth surfaces but it

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,430
can also if there's a bit off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

47
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,009
and it kind of scraped along a bottom of

48
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,829
the observation and it scrapes longer

49
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,990
the bed it can produce striations which

50
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,990
are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a scar and the rock which</font>

indicate the direction of ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> float that</font>

52
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,680
sort of very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're trying</font>

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,329
in the original process<font color="#CCCCCC"> called clucking</font>

58
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,389
clucking is basically when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garcia</font>

59
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,910
freezes

60
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,130
outcrops of rocky outcrops it's just a

61
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,320
word for loosing rock and then pulls the

loading clucking creates a very jagged

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,040
know already I've already talked quite a

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,900
bit about extending and compression flow

82
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,300
but just to reiterate the original

83
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,890
effects of that when the eye scans

84
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,380
aren't there's less pressure and

85
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,060
regulation occurs around the loose rock

86
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,980
outcrops and the same ones plucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

as the grecia advances the rock<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

pulled from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> surface and that's</font>

extension flow for compression flow the

90
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,660
ice mass increases as its courses

91
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,820
together leading to increased pressure

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,690
the bottom of the glacier has an

95
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,400
abrasive effect on the surface again

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,470
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading to striations aversion</font>

97
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,570
and rotational flow the frost shattering

98
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,370
and claire's at the most exposed rock

99
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,820
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is most likely to do so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen from like above and all around</font>

101
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,530
this surface and the plucking claire's

at a release<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pressure which is</font>
