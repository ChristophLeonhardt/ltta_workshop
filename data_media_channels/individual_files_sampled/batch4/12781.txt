on Monday a columnist at salon.com named Brittany Tillich Rita's authored an article titled Trump era anti-semitism change in my family we started going to synagogue the author says that until recently she had quote considered myself a non-practicing Jew a reformed atheist who found my way back to some sort of spirituality and began to embrace the cultural history of Judaism that I was raised with but she hadn't stepped into synagogue in years until Trump Tillich reads house writes quote but then a news alert came across the screen of my phone three days before Trump's inauguration a Jewish Community Center a few miles from my home had been evacuated following a bomb threat I felt my palms begin to sweat as I stared at the notification and disbelief jaws slightly slack not here not now anti-semitism which until this time in my life has been only a theory instantly became incredibly real even here in the liberal bubble of Massachusetts hatred is alive and well the JCCC bomb threat suspects it turns out were leftist journalists in a Jewish teenager with mental problems but the JCC threats were merely an entree for Zilla krita's to target the real anti-semites quote anti-semitic hate crimes are at their highest levels and years Jewish community centers around the country are getting bomb threats at an alarming rate Steve been and an anti-semite is in the white house swastikas appear like hideous confetti decorating walls and buildings all over the country Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized and while President Trump may have reminded us about his Jewish family members and assured us at a recent press conference that we're going to see a lot of love under his administration so far I don't see it never mind we don't have any suspects in the cemetery vandalisms yeah never mind the Bandon isn't an anti-semite I should know since I'm an Orthodox Jew who worked with him for two years daily and think he's a garbage human being for other reasons now I'm not gonna pretend that I wasn't upset by the level of anti-semitic vitriol I received from some Trump supporters during the last election cycle according to the anti-defamation league I was the top journalistic recipient of anti-semitism on Twitter by a wide margin I received thousands upon thousands of overtly anti-semitic tweets during the campaign but that was not why I went to shul and kept kosher or turned off my computer for Shabbat I did all of those things because Judaism is my religion and my way of life I practiced Judaism not in opposition to anti-semites anti-semitism but because Judaism has real true value Zilla Caritas isn't actually interested in Judaism she's interested in redefining Judaism to mean leftism and then saying that she's rededicated to her left isn't because of Trump to her and social justice warrior stuff an excuse to virtue signal and push leftist values here how she's here's how she describes Judaism quote now more than ever I want to teach my children what it means to be Jewish our faith has a long history of resistance no matter how many times history has tried to erase us to wipe us out we have survived we have a resistor our own demise and we have fought for the rights of others our people were active in the civil rights movement and fighting alongside black folks in the 1950s and 60s today my family has black lives matter signs in our home and on our shirts before my oldest daughter could even walk she marched with me as a Jew for the Liberation of Palestine strapped to my chest in a sling it is through complacency that we can become perpetuators of the oppression we were once victims of via a vote for trump or belief in marginalized people's ability to bootstrap their way to success it is the returning towards instead of turning away that we connect to our roots as oppressed people and it is this Judaism the one that centers the fight for justice that I connect to it is the one that finally makes sense instead of turning away from our community we are choosing to become part of it for the first time in our adult lives unquote this is horse crap Judaism is about a particular set of beliefs and practices it's wonderful that Jews were active in the civil rights movement and they certainly called upon the Bible for support so did Martin Luther King jr. of course but marching for the Liberation of Palestine while Palestinians murdered Jews in the streets and Alexio mosque is not Judaic it's anti Judaic neither is marching for the black lives matter movement which castigates police and makes innocent black americans more vulnerable to the predations of crime and it's certainly not a Judea concept to shirk personal responsibility and suggest that people can't rise in a free society zulo krita's article is only important because it demonstrates that for the secular left religious practice is a charade it's just a way to claim marginalization and minority status rather than abiding by the dictates of a religion that actually demands something of its adherence if the what Creek says truly wants to participate in Judaism you should start with the synagogue and let it shape her rather than the other way around i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show this has turned into a very very busy news day president Trump has signed an executive order on religious freedom I thought I would be celebrating unfortunately I cannot because it's a crappy executive order honestly god president from do better than this he's also not doing a great job on the israeli-palestinian issue which I will talk about plus Trump care is gonna be rammed through the house and we'll go through the details and what this crap sandwich looks like but before we get to all of that enlightening and uplifting news we have to and I would like to say thank you to our advertisers over at wink so if you are somebody who doesn't know anything about wine if you're somebody who is you have to go over

everybody in the office has tried the wink wine and they say that it is excellent it's also why the production quality on the show has slipped markedly in recent days as we put Austin into a in any case let's it's there there's a lot breaking in the news today and let's start with the Trump executive order so yesterday I talked in sterling terms about this executive order that was going to come from President Trump on religious liberty bump-bump about giant fail so he things out the actual executive order the executive order if it looked like the one that they were looking at a couple of months ago would have attempted to protect religious bakers and photographers from people attempting to crack down on them for not operating for same-sex weddings baking cakes for same-sex weddings it would have tried to exempt religious organizations from the from the overt antipathy of the IRS trying to crack down on religious organizations because religious organizations aren't pro-lgbt enough that's what the original order was supposed to do instead this order only touches the so-called Johnson amendment the Johnson amendment is this amendment that basically says that it's a piece of legislation that says that the IRS is supposed to remove nonprofit status from churches that speak overtly politically and no one pays attention to the Johnson amendment it hasn't really been enforced in decades it's not something that has a long history of brutal repression attached to it it's not great but it's not a huge thing and Trump in that that's all Trump has done so as I say the originally drafted executive order would have attempted to get rid of a lot of these regulations that stopped religious people from operating in the public sphere so there are federal anti-discrimination laws that say that grants is something that Obama did that grants from the federal government and and contracts from the federal government can only go to firms that do not quote discriminate against the LGBT community this would have stopped that for religious business owners because if you're a Christian and you own a business that's like a defense contractor and you don't want to pay for somebody same-sex wedding or somebody's same-sex health benefits that should not be your fault you're a religious person you have the ability to do that in the United States nobody has a right to health care from you because this is a free country still I never understood why this is a religious argument as opposed to a freedom of association argument you should be allowed to do business with whoever you want to do business with and not allowed to do business with whoever you don't want to do business with that's what the free market is for if you discriminate against people they will form their own businesses there are other businesses out there to take care of them honestly if you can't find a baker that will cater your gay wedding then you're not living in the real world well there are lots of Baker's and a lot of them are gay themselves and the vast majority of Baker's will provide for your gay wedding the same thing is certainly true of wedding gown designers and and photographers and florists it's all ridiculous but in any case Trump comes forward with this executive order and it's garbage so CBS News reports the executive order allows the IRS when IRS officials choose okay so now they've got selective prosecution going on not to enforce the Johnson amendment which prohibits nonprofits such as churches and charities from directly or indirectly directly engaging in a political campaign but the order does not provide blanket relief for tax-exempt religious organizations opening the possibility the IRS could pick and choose whom to penalize ad Morrissey who's sort of a fan of President Trump he explains that this policy is actually the worst of both worlds he says which churches will have to worry about the IRS in a trump administration which churches will have to worry about the IRS and a future Democratic administration this arbitrariness does not provide stronger religious liberty it takes us further from the rule of law and closer to the rule of executive whim Trump is out there today talking about how his Cardinals love it that's his words he says my Cardinals they're not his Cardinals but this again is just a bad piece of policy pushed by President Trump so that's bad and other bad news I want to talk about the the Trump Care thing in just a second because that of course is the big news of the day in other bad news President Trump has now announced that he's going to Israel he's gonna visit us for a while he's in Israel he's gonna visit with Mahmoud Abbas the terrorist leader of the Palestinian Authority his long history of associating with promoting promulgating partnering with terrorists he wrote his entire thesis when he was a young man on I believe his Holocaust denial in any case Mahmoud Abbas is one of the grosser figures in the world and Trump is going to meet with him in Bethlehem which is a propaganda coup for Abbas he met with him at the White House yesterday and when he met with him at the White House he flew the Palestinian flag which is really gross he shouldn't be flying the flag of a state that doesn't exist and if it were to exist would be a terrorist State and the fact is that meeting with him in Bethlehem this is one of the propaganda things that Abbas and the Palestinians try to say is that Jesus was a Palestinian Jesus was a Jew gang Jesus was not a Palestinian and the idea that the that the Jews in Israel are just like the Herodian villains in in the New Testament is asinine Trump is forwarding that propaganda by visiting with Abbas it really is quite gross Abbas totally played Trump yesterday it's obvious that he played Trump castor day again I wish that I had good things to say about Trump today but he needs to do a good job in order for me to say good things about him so Malcolm hoon Abbas the Palestinian terrorist leader he he sits with Trump and he says that the Palestine children are raised in a culture of peace when ananassa lia issue BM nahariya was an Mittal Bertie at far the lion home one at fall and Israeli mr. president I affirm to you that we are raising our youth our children our grandchildren on a culture of peace and we are endeavoring to bring about security freedom and peace for our children to live like the other children in the world along with the Israeli children in peace freedom and security and Trump replies to that here's a trump ass to say about it yeah it is the direction it's say something that I think is frankly maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years but we need to willing parties we believe Israel is willing we believe you're willing and if you both are willing we're gonna make a deal this is absolute horse crap it's not so hard okay the Middle East is not so hard you mean a religious conflict that is now been going on for over a millennium is not that hard that I'm so glad that President Trump is here just like Andrew Jackson to solve the Civil War I'm glad the president Trump here to solve Middle East peace by the way I boss is totally playing him this is from Palestinian TV last year okay if you haven't seen this from Palestinian TV this is an indication these are young teenagers we're talking yeah because it's your children so far you are still we must not write probably others and wise guys do knives on and stuff this is what's on Palestinian TV okay this garbage is what's on Palestinian TV and the fact that President Trump is sitting there going well I think we can solve it I think it's easy to solve no it's not easy to solve and he says well we have to willing parties and I believe you're willing what makes you believe that they're willing what makes you believe that why are you even having a BAS to the White House Abbas is clearly presiding over terrorist regime Hamas Islamic Jihad and Palestinian Authority are in a joint government but Trump because he thinks that he's smarter than everybody else and in fact is really really dumb on these kinds of issues is getting himself in trouble it's very very frustrating well that's a Trump care in just a second but first I want to say thank you to some new sponsors that we have so did you know

out okay so the really big story of the day beyond these kind of smaller fails from the Trump administration is of course Trump care so Trump care is supposed to be up for a vote today it is unclear whether it is going to pass it is very very close right now it's coming down to one or two votes is it something people should vote for you know I'm split on this on the one hand I agree with the National Review crowd that says that it's better than Obama care on the other hand it's still piece of garbage legislation and now you own it I don't think that you should vote for this I think the way you should do is you should vote for in a straight repeal of Obamacare and then a piecemeal replacement of Obamacare having these omnibus packages where you redo the entire health insurance system and then suggest that it's yours this is a big big big mistake so the fact that you have the the fact that you have them voting for a couple of good things like Medicaid reform and eliminating some but not all of Obamacare taxes those are good things but that's outweighed by the fact that you're not getting rid of the key Obamacare regulations those stay in place about pre-existing conditions you are not getting rid of the mandate everybody who talks about the individual mandate goes away it doesn't really go away there's a backdoor mandate if you miss a year of coverage and then you want to re-enroll the federal government forces insurance companies now to charge with 30 percent surcharge in order to punish you so that you don't drop off your insurance plan until you're sick and then rebuy it when you're healthy it retains that new Ryan trump entitlement program this of course is the refundable tax credits to buy health insurance so if you're poor then we just give you some money to buy health insurance which is basically an entitlement program and it funds people not to buy health insurance while healthy so one of the new provisions in this particular bill was comes from representative fred Upton it's an amendment that gives states eight billion dollars over the next five years to fund high-risk pools but essentially what it's for is people who are trying to who have who have preexisting conditions didn't buy healthcare didn't buy health insurance and now want to re-enroll and they're gonna pay that 30% fine now we're gonna pay that for them so we're now incentivizing people to stay out of the marketplace so they can be eligible for that sort of grant it's not gonna be enough it's a fig leaf it's just there's so much wrong with this and it's all because the reality is that Republicans lost this issue the minute that they lost the argument about the government's involvement in health care to begin with a free-market health care system is still the best option here but nobody is willing to say that because a free-market health care system in says that you are responsible for your own health insurance and that your community and not the government is going to help you out if you come up short on all of this that has lost the argument and the reason that that has lost the argument is because of this emotional argument that everyone quote-unquote has a right to health care now Jimmy Kimmel made that case the other night I talked about it at length on the show Sean Spicer at the White House responded to that and he said well Jimmy Kimmel is why we're fighting to improve Trump care well I think we share that concern for the kimmells child as well as any child that needs care and that's frankly why the president fought so hard to improve the bill like he did this morning to make sure that there was an extra layer of protection for anybody with a pre-existing condition no matter of their stage in life that's that's why we're fighting so hard for this but I think most importantly and I think at the end of Jimmy Kimmel is a monologue he said that there is no you know we need to have some of these things that aren't Republican or Democrat and that they're American policies and I think that's what the president is fighting for right now okay the president is not really fighting for the for what conservatives would like he's certainly not fighting for a free market in health care he has always made promises that are not true and the minute that you say that the government is responsible for your health care you're in trouble the left has successfully made the case that free market health insurance which is the way that the vast majority of people in the United States still get their health insurance that it doesn't work MSNBC's jason Johnson's a good example of this here's what Jason Johnson said about about health care in the government be honest I talked about elitism right you want to talk about all those Jimmy come on Ali you're an elite if you don't have to depend on the government at some point in your life there are sick people out there there are seniors who need federally funded you know cars to take them to and from places there are people who have student loans there is cancer research from the NSF that helps people throughout the entire country so you can say I don't care about the government that must be great and fine for you if you're that rich and maybe the people in the White House feel that way but regular people Republicans and Democrats we realize how stupid this is I can't wait for them to make this mistake so they get wiped out in 2018 we can have some competent Republicans and Democrats run in the country okay so this is the idea the left wants to push that we are all inherently dependent on government this is not even true in the health care fear so all the talk about pre-existing conditions ignores one rather crucial point is appointed avec Roy who is an expert on health care policy has made his basic point is that 90% of healthcare policies already covered pre-existing conditions you know this because if you're covered by your employer health care how many of you actually had to get physicals in order for you to get health insurance at this company the answer is no if you are an employee of this company then you did not have to take a physical in order to get health insurance that's because employers bargain with health insurance companies for group coverage right this is why you have group coverage group coverage covers pre-existing conditions ninety percent of people have health insurance in this country are getting it through their employer and those people do not have to worry about pre-existing conditions because of this collective bargaining arrangement that employers have with insurance companies that's basically a backdoor pre-existing conditions ban that exists in the free market the free market does work it does work and when it comes to the individual market first of all Medicaid already covers pre-existing conditions but there's no evidence that Medicaid actually increases people's life span or health outcomes so the idea that Medicaid is what we should have Medicaid for all as Bernie Sanders likes to say Medicaid for some isn't even that good so I'm not sure exactly why you would want Medicaid for all again it's bad policy but because Republicans lost the conversation they're now going to lose the policy and the fact is they're coming up with this sort of Frankenstein's monster of legislation that keeps the central provisions of Trump of Obamacare it turns them into Trump care so somehow the Republicans have come up with a magic trick that turns Obama that turns Obama's crap into Trump's cap crap they've now done it with the budget and now they're doing it with Obamacare as well again conservatism would be a nice a nice response to all of this but unfortunately I'm not sure we're gonna get it I do want to talk about some stuff that was kind of bombshell that the James Comey dropped at the hearing yesterday plus we have the mailbag coming up but for that you're gonna
