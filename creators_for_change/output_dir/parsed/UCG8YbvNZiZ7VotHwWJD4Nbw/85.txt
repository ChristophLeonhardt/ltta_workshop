hey guys what's up it's super early
right now but it's kind of worth it cuz
check out my view isn't it amazing also
I have to wake up early to get the
breakfast buffet so I had to do that so
I'm just gonna explore the docks a bit
before I eat so beautiful look at that
so we're done with breakfast as you can
see I just had you know a light
breakfast I'm just kidding
that was a buffet it was really good so
now we're gonna go kayaking so that
should be fun
so we just got back from kayaking and
swimming a bit in the pool and now we're
gonna check out soon so I think we have
about 10 minutes the shower and pack and
then we're gonna head back to Manila so
I'll see you guys
