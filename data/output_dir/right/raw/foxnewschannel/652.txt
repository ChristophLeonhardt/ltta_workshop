JESSE: A TALE OF TWO TOURS.

00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,975
BEFORE BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED

00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:29,723
THE WORLD.

17
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:31,491
JESSE: YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER

00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,894
AFTER HIS ELECTION HE EMBARKED

19
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,329
ON THE APOLOGY TOUR.

20
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,733
>> IN AMERICA THERE IS A FAILURE

21
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,635
TO APPRECIATE EUROPE'S LEADING

22
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:42,836

29
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:11,865
JESSE: THE MEDIA ATE THIS UP.

30
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:15,335
OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY WAS A

31
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,938
DISASTER, THE VOTERS REJECTED

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,372

TO PAY THEIR BILLS.

37
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:29,716
PRESIDENT TRUMP: MANY COUNTRIES

38
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:32,686

39
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:34,554
THEY OWE US A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,528
COUNTRIES AND THEY MAKE A FIVE

41
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:44,698
LINE DEAL WITH RUSSIA WHERE THEY

42
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:48,101
PUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE

43
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,503
COFFERS OF RUSSIA.

44
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:51,671
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU

45
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:53,340
FROM RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE PUTTING

46
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,910
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO RUSSIA.

47
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,980
GERMANY WILL HAVE 70% OF THEIR

50
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:14,227
AMERICA IN ACTUAL NUMBERS IS

51
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,630
PAYING 4.2%, AND I THINK THAT'S

52
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,201
ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I

53
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,636
DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD IT

54
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:26,506
OR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET

55
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:26,873
INVOLVES.

56
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:37,651

00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:41,121
BUYING ENERGY WHY AMERICA, NOT

58
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,189

FROM INVADING UKRAINE.

79
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:06,673

CHAOS HE MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

81
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,446
PRESIDENT TRUMP: IT WAS A

82
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:15,749
PRODUCT IDEA SUMMIT WHERE MY JOB

83
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,918
