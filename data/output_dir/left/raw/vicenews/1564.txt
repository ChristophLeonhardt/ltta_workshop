television that why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,000
there would be content and context to

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,610
works of props when it was on the air

50
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,500
Melrose Place drew an average of

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,169
thirteen million viewers now that it's

restaurants you have the Double

Happiness<font color="#E5E5E5"> their prosperity this is a</font>

that a billion people read Chinese

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,010
eventually the gala committee even

68
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,739
convinced melrose places writers to add

69
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,930
a character who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an artist no no</font>

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,150
problem I'm digging this exhibit the

71
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,250
story became a meta-narrative about the

72
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,709
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of public art to elevate the most</font>

73

she bombing a Baghdad so talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,450
about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you've seen any</font>

76
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,370
copycats like other people attempting

77
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,190
this kind of art on TV shows I have not

78
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I'm not a super watcher but are</font>

79

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any other sort of spores that</font>

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,260
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been planted in other media that</font>

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,209
will detonate in our future well now

82
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,010
have I told you that would be totally

83
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,350
improper of me if we were doing our

84
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,560
covert operation and then all sudden but

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,940
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of project is open for anyone</font>

86
