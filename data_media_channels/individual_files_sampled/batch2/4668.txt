day 439 of the Trump administration and the Washington Post has just dropped a major story tonight on the muller russia investigation Carole Lennon and Robert Costa report the Special Counsel told president Trump's attorneys that the president remains under investigation but is not a criminal target quote in private negotiations in early March about a possible presidential interview Muller described Trump as a subject of his investigation into Russia's interference in our 2016 election prosecutors view someone as a subject when that person has engaged in conduct that is under investigation but there is not sufficient evidence to bring charges the special counsel also told Trump's lawyers that he is preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice according to two people with knowledge of the conversations Muller also reinforced the need to interview Trump to understand whether he had any corrupt intent to thwart the Russia investigation and complete this portion of the investigation the special counsels description of president Trump's status has also sparked debate within the president's inner circle the report goes on to say quote the President and some of his allies seized on the special counsels words as an assurance that Trump's risk of criminal jeopardy is low other advisers however noted that subjects of investigations can easily become indicted targets and express concern that the special prosecutor was baiting Trump into an interview that could put the president in greater legal peril Ty Cobb an attorney for President Trump told NBC News just tonight that ethically he has declined to comment on this Washington Post report another of the president's attorneys Jay Sekulow told NBC News quote we do not discuss real or alleged conversations between our legal team and the Office of Special Counsel and as if this news wasn't enough we also saw the first sentencing today in the Russia investigation attorney Alex vanderzwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison fined $20,000 for lying to investigators about contacts he had with former Trump aide Rick gates and a Ukrainian businessman with alleged ties to Russian intelligence well for more and because of the news we're covering tonight we bring in our expanded leadoff panel for a Tuesday night Robert Costa whose byline appears on tonight's breaking news from The Washington Post he is the papers national political reporter and moderator of Washington week on PBS also back with us Ashley Parker White House reporter for The Washington Post who also contributed to tonight's reporting also with us Jennifer Rogers former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York and Jeremy bash former chief of staff at CIA and Pentagon also former counsel to house Intel well I guess I start with you mr. Costa this feels like a moment in this investigation in this ongoing story what was your key takeaway from the work you contributed to one of the challenges of reporting on this story is to figure out what mr. Muller is saying behind the scenes because he has been so quiet publicly so has have his colleagues in the special counsel's office but we have reported and confirmed that in early March mr. Muller had a conversation with president Trump's attorneys on the Russia probe and he walked through the president's status at this time that he is now someone who is being he's not a witness in the investigation but he is someone who they would like to interview to learn more about his intent when it came to some of his key decisions in his presidency because they're trying to finish a report on potential obstruction of justice and the president's conduct in office Ashley Parker I'm going to read you a portion of tonight's reporting in your newspaper quote the president has privately expressed relief at the description of his legal status which has increased his determination to agree to a special counsel interview that people said he's repeatedly told allies that he is not a target of the probe and believes an interview will help him put the matter behind him friends said however legal experts said Butler's description of Trump as a subject of a grand jury probe does not mean he's in the clear Ashley you're not trying to tell me that mr. Muller would play with the president's emotions well is the legal experts we talked to said there's sort of a stunningly thin line between a subject which is what the president currently is and a target which is what he is at risk of becoming and no one wants to be a target and basically if the president goes and sits down before Muller and his investigators someone like mr. Trump is taking a real risk in part because he's someone who we know has a penchant for misleading statements and false statements and that's the very sort of thing that makes you move from a subject to a target so while the president has expressed relief and has we know been going around telling friends and allies he's not a target he has nothing to worry about right now he doesn't in this immediate moment doesn't necessarily have something to worry about but the concern from some but not all in his legal team is if he does go and he does sit down he could sort of dance right over that line into quite dangerous territory Jennifer I talked to a veteran Washington lawyer tonight who told me this for a sitting president to be the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation is frightening this confirms Muller is investigating obstruction this confirms he will write a report this only magnifies the stake of an interview switching from subject to target in an instance so the question to you what is the difference in your mind between subject and target well a subject is someone whose conduct is within the scope of the investigation so someone who might ultimately be charged but they're not sure yet basically a target is someone against whom they have substantial evidence that a crime has been committed and the guidelines also used the term putative defendant as in almost you know you've made that decision already so this is the problem for the president he really could move from subject to target very quickly and it doesn't have to be because he sits down and says I did it i obstructed justice it could be that in his denials as he's maybe unable to explain some inconsistencies the special counsel decides that his testimony or his the conversation that they're having not credible so it doesn't have to be that he admits something or that they catch him in something necessarily but if they decide that what he is saying does not jive with what the rest of the evidence is that they're hearing they could decide that that kind of puts them over the edge Jeremy bash how do you read tonight's story in The Washington Post yeah I think the President may try to take some cold comfort from the fact that he's not a target Brian but he shouldn't for the following reasons first of all his conduct is under investigation there's no mere criminal investigation it's the most significant national security investigation in our nation's history second is Bob Miller is going to write a report and that's something new we haven't heard that before and that could be of course the basis upon which Congress makes decisions about impeachment and removal from office and finally Brian there was a suggestion in Bob's reporting which I'd love to hear more about in which the lawyers for Donald Trump believe that Bob Moore may be playing rope-a-dope this is all strategy to get the president to sit down for that elusive interview with the special counsel during which the president may incriminate himself hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
