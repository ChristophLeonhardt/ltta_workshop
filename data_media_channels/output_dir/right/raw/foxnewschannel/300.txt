1
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:03,995
DECISION THAT WOULD HINGE ON A

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:04,629
NEW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,763
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE

4
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:08,266
FUND-RAISING IS FIERCE RIGHT NO

5
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:08,533
NOW.

6
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:09,066
>> IT IS FIERCE.

7
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,802
WE HAVE SEEN A 500% INCREASE IN

8
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:14,238
OUR FUND-RAISING AT THE END OF

9
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,474
THIS MONTH HAS TENSIONS HAVE

10
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,441
BEEN BOILING OVER IN WASHINGTON

11
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,877
AND VOTERS HAVE STARTED TO PAY

12
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:20,511
ATTENTION, REPUBLICANS ARE

13
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:22,280
SAYING WE WANT TO SEE RESULTS IN

14
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,114
WASHINGTON.

15
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:24,682
WE DON'T WANT THIS DYSFUNCTION

16
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,217
AND IS CHAOS IN THE RESIST AND

17
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:27,518
THEY OBSTRUCT THAT THE DEMOCRATS

18
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,319
ARE PUTTING FORWARD.

19
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,287
WE LIKE WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE

20
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:32,290
GETTING DONE, 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT

21
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,928
ALONE SINCE WE PUT A MAN ON THE

22
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:44,302
MOON.

23
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:45,536
>> Harris: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

24
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:46,571
HAVE SEEN THIS POLLING BUT I

25
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:49,440
WANT TO SHARE WITH HER VIEWERS,

26
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,809
THE POLITICS OF SUPPORTING A

27
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,711
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE ARE

28
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:54,846
PLAYING OUT AMONG INDEPENDENT

29
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:55,479
VOTERS.

30
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,881
DEMOCRATS HANDLING OF THE

31
00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:57,882
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION, THIS IS

32
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,885
HOW THEY SEE IT.

33
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:03,254
58% DISAPPROVE OF THE WAY THE

34
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,522
DEMOCRATS HANDLED THAT

35
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,121
NOMINATION.

36
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,291
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY FROM

37
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:07,692
THAT?

38
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,061
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED.

39
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,362
LOOK AT DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO

40
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,129
RECEIVED THE DOCTOR FOR LETTER

41
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,198
AND HELD IT IN HER BACK POCKET,

42
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,566
DIDN'T TAKE IT TO A COLLEAGUE

43
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,869
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND SAID LET'S

44
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,073
CONDUCT A PRIVATE INVESTIGATION.

45
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:23,674
USING IS VERY IMPORTANT STORIES

46
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:25,476
TO NOT BRING THESE ALLEGATIONS

47
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,310
FORWARD TO THEIR COLLEAGUES.

48
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,778
IT HAS BEEN SHAMEFUL AND THEN

49
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:28,813
THE CONTINUING OF DISRUPTION

50
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:31,048
DURING THE HEARINGS.

51
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,217
AS IS AND WHAT WANT FOR OUR

52
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,485
COUNTRY.

53
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:35,753
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A

54
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:39,790
CIVILIZED DISCUSSION WITHOUT

55
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,491
WRITING OR ATTACKING THE OTHER

56
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,693
PARTY AND IS NOT WHAT THEY HAVE

57
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:43,694
DONE DURING THIS PROCESS.

58
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:45,529
>> Harris: THE MIDTERM

59
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,664
ELECTION 28 DAYS AWAY FROM

60
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:46,964
TODAY.

61
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:48,900
HOW DOES THE KAVANAUGH

62
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,968
CONFIRMATION FIT INTO THE

63
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,203
REPUBLICAN SIDE FOR THE

64
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:52,904
REPUBLICAN NARRATIVE TO VOTERS

65
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,705
RIGHT NOW?

66
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,941
>> IN THAT FIRST MIDTERM OF A

67
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,509
SITTING PRESIDENT, THE PARTY IN

68
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,410
POWER USUALLY LOSES ON AVERAGE

69
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,479
30 SEATS.

70
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,115
BARACK OBAMA LOST 63 BECAUSE THE

71
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:04,882
PARTY BECOMES COMPLACENT.

72
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:06,517
THEY THINK WE WON BACK THE

73
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:07,218
WHITE HOUSE, WE DON'T NEED TO

74
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,886
GET OUT AND ABOUT.

75
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,721
THESE HEARINGS HAVE WOKEN UP OUR

76
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:11,289
VOTERS.

77
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,490
THEY NOW RECOGNIZE WHAT'S AT

78
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:13,691
STAKE.

79
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,493
THEY ARE SEEING TWO VERY CLEAR

80
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:15,893
CHOICES.

81
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:17,094
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE DELIVERING

82
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,896
RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

83
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:20,364
JOBS, HIGHER WAGES, AN ECONOMY

84
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:23,868
THAT IS BOOMING.

85
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:26,337
AND DEMOCRATS WHO ARE RUNNING ON

86
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,872
RESIST, OBSTRUCT, THE SPRING

87
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:30,074
MORE DYSFUNCTION TO WASHINGTON,

88
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:32,710
MORE INVESTIGATIONS, IT'S VERY

89
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,511
CLEAR AND REPUBLICANS AND

90
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,712
INDEPENDENTS ARE SAYING WE DON'T

91
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:35,379
LIKE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE

92
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,515
OFFERING RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE

93
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:38,382
GETTING MORE ENERGIZED AND I

94
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:39,116
THINK THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR US

95
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,218
GOING INTO THESE MIDTERMS.

96
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,255
>> Harris: I WANT TO STEP AWAY

97
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,623
NOW TO THE EXIT BY AMBASSADOR

98
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,057
NIKKI HALEY.

99
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,591
AND I KNOW THE INDEPENDENT'S IN

100
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:49,727
OTHERS ARE SAYING IT.

101
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,262
THE DEMOCRATS HAD BETTER WATCH

102
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:52,396
OUT BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER

103
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,532
POINT THAT THEY MAY MISS READ IN

104
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:55,132
TERMS OF HER DEPARTURE.

105
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,269
HOW DO YOU SEE A?

106
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,004
>> AMBASSADOR HALEY IS A

107
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,706
CHAMPION AND FOR WOMEN ACROSS

108
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:02,473
THE COUNTRY, FOR YOUNG GIRLS AND

109
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,876
IT DOES SHOW THE STRONG WOMEN

110
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:06,610
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BROUGHT

111
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,213
INTO HIS ADMINISTRATION AND AS

112
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:09,847
U.N. AMBASSADOR, SHE HAS

113
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,549
RESTORED THE UNITED STATES AS A

114
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,483
GLOBAL LEADER, SHE HAS TAKEN ON

115
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,953
IRAN AND SYRIA AND RUSSIA AND

116
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:16,487
NORTH KOREA.

117
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,755
SHE HAS BEEN DECISIVE, SHE'S

118
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:18,489
BEEN TOUGH.

119
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,491
SHE HAS NOT APOLOGIZE FOR

120
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,492
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST SO IT'S A

121
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:21,892
LOSS.

122
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,761
BUT I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL BE

123
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,262
PUTTING SOMEBODY GREAT IN HER

124
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,664
PLACE AND I'M SURE SHE IS GOING

125
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,965
TO BE STICKING AROUND TO HELP

126
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,634
THAT PERSON ANYTIME THEY NEED T

127
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:31,736
TO.

128
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,804
>> Harris: JOHN ROBERTS

129
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,206
REPORTING ABOUT MENENDEZ NOT

130
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,707
EVEN MENTIONING THAT PLACE OF A

131
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,675
WOMAN AT THE TOP.

132
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,677
AND THEN BRAD SHERMAN ON MY

133
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,678
SHOW, THE CONGRESSMAN EARLIER

134
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,313
DIDN'T MAKE THAT POINT TO THE

135
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:44,281
PARTY OF WOMEN LAST WORD FROM

136
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:44,548
YOU.

137
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,484
>> WE ARE A PARTY OF WOMEN.

138
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:47,485
I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE NOTICE,

139
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:50,321
I'M THE HEAD OF THE RNC, A WOMAN

140
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:52,423
RUNNING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, I

141
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:53,457
AM A SUBURBAN COLLEGE EDUCATED

142
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:53,758
WOMAN.

143
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,825
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE

144
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:55,993
NARRATIVE THAT ALL WOMEN ABOUT

145
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:56,694
THE SAME.

146
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,695
I'M SURE YOU DON'T.

147
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,330
AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT THIS

148
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:00,931
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE, IT HAS

149
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,100
MADE MY FAMILIES LIFE BETTER,

150
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:04,301
FAMILIES LIVES BETTER ACROSS

151
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:05,102
THIS COUNTRY.

152
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:06,570
WHEN WE HAVE ECONOMIC

153
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:07,405
PROSPERITY, IT LIFTS THAT'S WHAT

154
00:04:07,406 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN TO THE
