Scott your company brain candy obviously deals a lot with user-generated content how is allowing user-generated content important or influential when it comes to branding or entertainment well the interesting thing about this is that this user generated content from fans in the creative community is already happening and has been happening for decades if not centuries around properties that they like so the question the property owners have to ask themselves is what am I going to do about that do I ignore it do I legislate it to death or do I find a way to give these fans a official path to creating cannon content and potentially making money from the content they create around the properties that they love we're at a crossroads at the entertainment section as far as what do we do about this thing called the internet digital piracy basically drowning in a sea of content where users have so many choices what does an entertainment property and they do and one of the things they can do under our model is figure out a way to harness the interest the attention by the community at large and give them ways to participate meaningfully with the property in ways that the property and the benefits beyond simple advertising and marketing benefits so you can either sue like Viacom did youtube or you can learn to collaborate with an audience that's already there and it's already doing this it basically boils down to a partnership how do you view your consumers are they an opponent that you have to take the court or are they potentially a peer partner where you can co-create with them and if you open the model up and the property up under the right conditions the proper dinner doesn't have to give up branding or editorial control everybody can make and that's sort of the model that you have found it under brain candy correct correct what are the various ways that studios or networks can incorporate user-generated content I mean there's got to be a slew of ways what are some of the examples out there well what you'll see right now right for example a orgies alternate reality games are very popular as a marketing device in a pre-launch campaign up to a particular product could be in you could be a video game they've been around for about a decade they were started by Jordan Weissman with the beast for Steven Spielberg's AI they are essentially cost centers and they are one-time playable entities they cannot be repeated or they really won't be repeated by the player because they saw the puzzle and the mysteries already done or the products been released so one of the things that I think can happen is that user-generated content can be used as a way to create a persistent ongoing monetizable growing property where both the property owner and the community large contribute to it so being in the community and being a co-creator of content or participating what is the value proposition for me is it just fun well I would say that the value proposition is different depending on who you are because lots of people are creating content for free and throwing it up on the internet with with no expectation of monetization some people are doing it hoping that they'll be monetization down the road whether it be in the form of my script got bought or my company got bought or I got funding some people are my advertisement correct now advertising obviously is a huge component and is probably the first thing people think about when they're talking about online content the more content I have the more I buzz I'll get the more advertising dollars I'll have this obviously allows a new revenue stream for property owners beyond what they're currently doing so who is a forward thinker in this space in terms of allowing your audience to co-create certain aspects or riff off of what's already out there are there any studios or in the networks that are actually trying this i would say that at the industry level there still seems to be a strong reticence based I think purely on legal frameworks that the current model with the litigious in this environment that we have the current model basically wants the entertainment property owners to say I don't want to have to give credit or money to anyone and I want to retain full ownership because if I don't I'm opening up the door to a huge slew of lawsuits however what I'm seeing is that certain companies are beginning to explore with this and say we're going to release our content and we're going to encourage and invite people to play with the content to repurpose it remix it remash it make it their own and then contribute that back to the internet most of them still stopped short of monetary compensation most of them stopped short of some type of a credit or type approach but a few companies are beginning to do this however at the industry level there still seems to be a large reticence to do that and I view it mostly from a legal perspective it's not a creative issue per se its major roadblock is legal legality of it that's what I keep hearing when I talk to the large media companies it is the lawyers will never go for this this will never get past legal there are creative concerns but the biggest robot that I see right now to true collaboration is the legal aspect so say I'm a writer i right TV show if the studio opens up that platform to people contributing and whatnot doesn't that put my job at jeopardy it certainly can that's a good incentive for you to be the best writer you can do we can we can basically talk about the internet and say this is bad digital piracy is bad things are changing descender me imeem these these types of arguments have been going on for ten years or you can say we're going to reinvent ourselves we're going to my knowledge correct we're going to leverage the strengths of the internet and what the user community is already doing when you look at youtube and this is not to disparage what's on youtube the most popular videos are not necessarily the ones that most entertainment companies would want to create themselves and offer to the public and yet they're getting lots of hits so that tells you that there's a there's a draw by the creative community and by the people around the world to certain content that could be monetizable through ad dollars or some other model that would not normally find its way through the entertainment properly okay thanks dad thank you
