and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicate with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do senator Franken I'm not aware of any of those activities I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have to not have communications with the Russians and I'm unable to comment on well I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaign and those remarks are unbelievable to me and false and I don't have anything else to say about that was I give well I've said that out whenever it's appropriate I will refuse myself there's no doubt about that this allegation that surrogates and I had been called a surrogate for Donald Hawk had been meeting continuously with Russian officials and that's what I struck me very hard and that's what I focused my answer on and in retrospect if I should have slowed down and said what I did meet one Russian official a couple of times that would be the ambassador thank you all take care we also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia related investigation problematic and so we were we were convinced in fact I think we'd already heard that the career people were recommending that he recused himself that he was not going to be in contact with Russia related matters much longer
