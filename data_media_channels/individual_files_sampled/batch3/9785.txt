CHRIS? SHANNON: JOINING US NOW, MITCH McCONNELL. MR. LEADER, WELCOME. ANY DOUBTS IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU WOULD GET TO THIS POINT TODAY AND HOW DO YOU MOVE FORWARD THROUGH A PROCESS A LOT OF FOLKS SAY IS SAY DS SAY DAMAGED. THIS HAS BEEN A NASTY PROCESS INITIATED IN THE BEGINNING BY SENATE JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS AND CARRIED OVER INTO THE PUBLIC. WE'VE LITERALLY BEEN UNDER ASSAULT BY A MOB THAT'S GOING TO OUR HOMES, BRUSHING UP AGAINST US IN THE HALLS, REQUIRING ENHANCED SECURITY. LOOK, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE MOB DIDN'T WIN. JUSTICE WILL BE DONE. WE PROTECTED THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT APPLIES IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND CERTAINLY IN SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATIONS. SHANNON: WELL, YOU KNOW, SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OBVIOUSLY MADE THE MOMENT AND MADE THE BIG TURN A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK YESTERDAY WHEN SHE TOOK TO THE FLOOR AT 3:00 P.M. AND LAID OUT IN DETAIL FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES HER CASE FOR WHY SHE WOULD VOTE YES FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. BUT SHE HAS SPLIT WITH AT BUT SHE HAS SPLIT WITH LT BUT SHE HAS SPLIT WITH LISA MURKOWSKI AND OTHER COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE. WILL THOSE RELATIONSHIPS TAKE TIME TO HEAL FOLLOWING THIS FIGHT? I DON'T THINK SO. AT THE TIME WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT WE PASSED AN OPIOID BILL AND FAA BILL BY OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN MAJORITY. WE COMPLETED MOST OF THE APPROPRIATION BILLS. THIS HAS BEEN A BIG FIGHT, LARGELY PARTISAN. THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS WE'RE DOING ALONG BESIDE IT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. CHRIS: I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO USED TO WORK FOR YOU AND IS A GREAT ADMIRER. HE SAID MITCH McCONNELL HAS A NARROW EMOTIONAL BANDWIDTH, BY WHICH HE MEANT YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN TOO HOT OR TOO COLD WHICH IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING AS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. IN THIS FIGHT THERE TIMES IN THIS FIGHT WHERE TIMES IN THIS FIGHT WERRE TIMES IN THIS FIGHT WEREE TIMES IN THIS FIGHT WERE TTIMES IN THIS FIGHT WERE THEMES IN THIS FIGHT WERE THERES IN THIS FIGHT WERE THERE TIMES WHEN YOU BEGAN TO RUN PRETTY HOT. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WONDERED WHETHER WE WOULD WIN. I NEVER CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT QUITTING. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH. HIS REPUTATION WAS DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD FOR TWO WEEKS. HE NEEDED TO HAVE A VOTE. WE NEEDED TO HAVE A VOTE. THE PRESIDENT AND I HAD TALKED ABOUT IF WE CAME UP SHORT WE WERE GOING TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THIS YEAR. AND SO WE WERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO GO ON FOR A MULTITUDE OF REASONS. IT WAS NOT GETTING BETTER. THERE WAS UNCORROBORATED, OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THROWN AT YOU, TRYING TO GET THEM ON THE AIR. THIS WASN'T GOING TO GET BETTER WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME. WE NEEDED TIME IF PER CHANCE WE CAME UP SHORT. THE HEROES OF THE STORY ARE SUSAN COLLINS AND JEFF FLAKE. THEY WANTED THIS ADDITIONAL ONE WEEK INVESTIGATION. THEY REALIZED IT COULDN'T BE A FISHING EXPEDITION. THEY DEFINED THE PARAMETERS OF IT, NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THE SENATORS IN DOUBT. WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IN ADEQUATE TIME. THEY READ IT, REVIEWED IT AND REACHED A DECISION. I'M THRILLED THAT TWO OF THE THREE WHO WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS ARE VOTING YES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO PUT A NEW OUTSTANDING JUDGE ON THE SUPREME COURT TODAY. CHRIS: YOU SAY THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN YOU REALLY HAD DOUBT WHETHER OR NOT THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH. WHAT WAS YOUR MOMENT OF DEEPEST DOUBT? WELL, OBVIOUSLY DR. FORD WAS VERY CONVINCING. I REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT AND I TALKED AFTER THAT AND AGREED THAT SHE HAD MADE AN EFFECTIVE PRESENTATION. I SUGGESTED AND HE AGREED THAT THAT WAS HALF TIME, WE NEEDED TO WAIT UNTIL THE SECOND HALF WAS OVER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE. WE TALKED AGAIN AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S PERFORMANCE. WE THOUGHT IT WAS SPECTACULAR. HE KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US EVER DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWAL. BUT IF THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN YOU MIGHT WONDER WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO WIN, IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AFTER DR. FORD'S CREDIBLE TESTIMONY. SHANNON: YOU MENTIONED THE INFORMATION THAT STARTED TO COME THROUGH THE FLOOD GATES ONCE THEY WERE OPENED. MANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS WERE ANONYMOUS. THEY BECAME MORE DISTURBING AS WE WENT ALONG. DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY, SHOULD THERE BE ANY FOR ANY OF THE CASES FOR WHAT WAS ALLEGED THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE. WE DON'T GET TO POLICE THE MEDIA. A LOT OF FOLKS, IN YOUR WORLD, NOT YOU, NECESSARILY, WOULD PRINT THIS STUFF OR PUT IT ON THE AIR WITH NO CORROBORATION WHATSOEVER. UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT, WE DON'T GET TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SENATE DEMOCRATS MAY HAVE DONE, I THINK SENATOR GRAHAM IS ON THE COMMITTEE, INDICATED THEY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. SHANNON: THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH RIGHT NOW. YOU GOT SCORES OF OTHER NOMINEES. YOU'VE HAD VERY GOOD SUCCESS IN GETTING A NUMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HIS LOWER COURT NOMINEES ONTO THE BENCH. WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE STILL WAITING, DO YOU WORRY THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS WILL IMPACT THOSE NOMINATIONS IN. NO, WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM ALL. THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM THING IS CONFIRM THE PRESIDENT'S JUDGES, NOT JUST TO THE SUPREME COURT, TWO NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, 26 CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES. THERE ARE MORE THAT WILL BE DONE AT THE CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT COURT LEVEL BY THE END OF THE YEAR. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WIRE DOING WITH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY. CHRIS: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MOB AND THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T WIN. THERE WAS QUITE SOME EXTRAORDINARY SCENES OF PROTESTERS AND WE ALL VALUE THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS BUT AS YOU WERE COMING THROUGH THE AIRPORT, THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK, YOU WERE SURROUNDED BY PROTESTERS. SOMETIMES THEY WERE BEING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THEY WERE TRYING TO TALK TO REPORTERS, THEY WERE TRYING TO SHOUT THEM DOWN. THEY CAME TO YOUR HOUSE, OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES. ARE YOU WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT THE POTENTIAL NOT FOR FAIR STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES BUT THIS COULD BECOME A SECURITY RISK. WELL, LOOK, IN RETROSPECT I'M GLAD THEY DID IT. WHAT IT'S DONE, IT'S FIRED UP OUR OWN BASE GOING INTO THE ELECTION A MONTH FROM NOW. NOTHING TURNS REPUBLICANS OF ALL STRIPES, WHETHER BUSH REPUBLICANS OR TRUMP REPUBLICANS, ON LIKE A COURT FIGHT. AND THEY PLAYED RIGHT INTO OUR HANDS IN RETROSPECT, TURNED THIS INTO A BIG ISSUE, PUT IT FRONT AND CENTER GOING INTO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, UNDERSCORES HOW IMPORTANT KEEPING THE SENATE IN REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONFIRM THE PRESIDENT'S JUDGES FOR TWO MORE YEARS. SO AS UNPLEASANT AS IT'S BEEN, IT'S BEEN WORTH IT. THEY MADE A TACTICAL MISTAKE THAT HELPED ME UNIFY THE CONFERENCE AND TURN OVER THE REPUBLICAN BASE GOING INTO THE ELECTION. MAYBE I OUGHT TO SAY THANK YOU. CHRIS: JUST REAL BRIEFLY, BECAUSE HAVE YOU TO GET TO THE FLOOR, ANY THOUGHT OF NEW SECURITY MEASURES BECAUSE THE FEAR, AND THIS COULD GO EITHER WAY, CONSERVATIVES TO DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, LIBERALS TO REPUBLICAN SENATORS, OF A SECURITY THREAT? I THINK IT'S BEST NOT TO TALK ABOUT SECURITY ON THE AIR. CHRIS: SENATOR McCONNELL, WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE AND YOU WILL JOIN ME ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY TOMORROW. I'LL HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
