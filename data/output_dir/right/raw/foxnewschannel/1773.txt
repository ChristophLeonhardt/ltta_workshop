1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,830
A FULL RECOVERY SO SHE CAN

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,232
CONTINUE HER WORK ON BEHALF OF

3
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:04,300
CHILDREN EVERYWHERE.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,067
THAT'S THE OFFICIAL STATEMENT

5
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:07,069
FROM THE FIRST LADY'S OFFICE.

6
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:08,771
DR. SEAGLE IS ON THE LINE WITH

7
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,472
US, A MEMBER OF THE FOX NEWS

8
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:11,407
MEDICAL A TEAM.

9
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:15,811
DR. SEAGLE, THIS WAS KEPT UNDER

10
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,246
WRAPS, PRIVACY AS IS SOMEWHAT

11
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:17,613
STANDARD.

12
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:19,315
I'M SURE THIS IS A MATTER THAT A

13
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:20,883
LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE GOOGLING.

14
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:22,251
A GOOD MOMENT FOR US TO LEARN

15
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:23,018
MORE ABOUT IT.

16
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:24,253
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US,

17
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:24,987
DR. SEAGLE?

18
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:27,423
>> SHEP, LISTEN, THE FIRST THING

19
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:29,291
IS THAT THIS TYPE OF A THING --

20
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,895
I DON'T HAVE THE INSIDE MEDICAL

21
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:33,729
INFORMATION.

22
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,765
COMMONLY IT'S SOMETHING CALLED A

23
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:39,401
FATTY TUMOR, WHICH IS BENIGN.

24
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,503
THERE'S TWO WAYS YOU CAN REMOVE

25
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:42,037
IT.

26
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,473
ONE IS TO REMOVE IT SURGICALLY.

27
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:48,110
THE OTHER IS TO BLOOD OFF THE

28
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,011
BLOOD SUPPLY.

29
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,346
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO UNDERSTAND

30
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,414
THAT WE HAVE ADVANCED WITH

31
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:54,483
MODERN SURGICAL TECHNIQUES WHERE

32
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:57,386
WE CAN ISOLATE AND CUT OFF THE

33
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:00,189
BLOOD SUPPLY TO SOMETHING THAT

34
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:06,829
IS BENIGN AND SHRINK IT SO YOU

35
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,566
DON'T HAVE TO REMOVE IT

36
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:10,966
SURGICALLY.

37
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:11,934
>> Shepard: WHAT IS SHE

38
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,335
UNDERGOING RIGHT NOW?

39
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:15,170
>> A LITTLE PAIN IN THE AREA,

40
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,804
SOME DISCOVERED.

41
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:21,143
A LOT LESS IF YOU REMOVED IT

42
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:21,543
SURGICALLY.

43
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:22,711
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

44
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,913
YOU GO IN THROUGH AN ARTERY AND

45
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:27,783
A SMALL INCISION.

46
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,918
CATHETER, ARTERY.

47
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,253
NOT A LOT OF PAIN.

48
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:32,221
RAPID RECOVERY.

49
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,856
>> Shepard: THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

50
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:35,557
WILL THE PAIN DIMINISH?

51
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:36,592
ARE THERE THINGS A DOCTOR WOULD

52
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:39,094
TELL HER TO DO OR NOT DO?

53
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:41,597
>> THEY'LL OF COURSE BE WATCHING

54
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:42,297
HER URINE.

55
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:45,567
THEY'LL WATCH THE AREA WHERE THE

56
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,302
THEY'LL TELL HER NOT TO DO A LOT

57
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:49,772
HOFF EXTENSIVE ACTIVITY.

58
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:50,806
TAKE IT EASY.

59
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,674
SHE PROBABLY WANT HAVE MORE THAN

60
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:55,310
A DAY OR SO OF BED REST.

61
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,312
PROBABLY WILL SEE HER BACK ON

62
00:01:57,312 --> 00:02:00,883
HER FEET IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

63
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:03,952
A MODERN MIRACLE OF A

64
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:04,887
NONSURGICAL APPROACH.

65
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:06,789
>> Shepard: DR. SEAGLE -- PLEASE

66
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,222
FINISH.

67
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:09,458
>> SHEP, WE CALL IT MINIMALLY

68
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,693
INNOVATIVE NOW.

69
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:13,295
AGAIN, YOU USE THE OPPORTUNITY

70
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:15,197
TO SHRINK THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO

71
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:16,799
SOMETHING THAT IS BENIGN.

72
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,034
YOU WOULDN'T USE THIS TECHNIQUE

73
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,035
IF YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS A

74
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:22,004
CHANCE IT WAS MALIGNANT.

75
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:23,972
SOMETHING LIKE A FATTY TUMOR,

76
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:26,175
YOU CAN DO THIS.

77
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:29,144
IT REQUIRES A LOT OF BLOOD.

78
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:32,281
YOU CUT OFF THE BLOOD AND IT

79
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:32,648
SHRINKS.

80
00:02:32,648 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Shepard: THE FIRST LADY LOOKS
