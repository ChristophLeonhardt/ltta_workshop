this is great moments in Republican
presidential history these are the boys
of when to vote
these are the men who took the cliffs
these are the champions who helped free
a continent these the heroes who helped
end a war that this nation under God
shall have a new birth of freedom and
that government of the people by the
people for the people shall not perish
from the earth
he's a war hero because he was captured
I like people that weren't captured okay
I hate to tell you this has been great
moments in Republican presidential
history
