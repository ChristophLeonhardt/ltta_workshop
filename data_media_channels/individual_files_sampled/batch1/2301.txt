50% of the stuff you buy it stores is not on your shopping list so how do you end up spending all that hard-earned cash we spoke to a retail analyst who let us in on some of the secrets and it all begins when you walk in the door stores are organized counterclockwise because around 90% of people are right-handed this is called the flow your program to push the cart with your left hand and interact with products with your right hand clearance racks are hidden away in the back they want you to get through the entire place to get there so you can buy the expensive stuff first and when you do get there they're designed to be messy and disorganized so good luck finding anything you might want stores are also tuned into who you shop for for example a mother walks into a department store she's probably shopping for her kids first right that's why the perfumes and cosmetics are in the back of the store so she can reward herself when she's done with a personal frill at the end of the trip and it's a cash cow perfume is marked up 50 to 60 percent another tactic stores uses tailoring music to their customers age stores try and match customers to music of their generation because studies show when they don't match people feel like they're spending more time shopping than they actually are and that's bad it gives people a negative experience which can lead to less spending and then that tempting checkout aisle this is where stores have their largest profit margins customers pounce on stuff like magazines candy sunglasses lipgloss stores called them impulse buys so the next time you walk through those doors you'll have a pretty good idea what you're up against and that all-important battle for your cash is it the supermarket just to get the essentials don't hold your breath these staples eggs bread milk they're spread out in the stores remote corner
