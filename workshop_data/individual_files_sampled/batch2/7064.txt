the three UCLA basketball players who were facing up to a decade in the Chinese prison after shoplifting have actually now been released and it's apparently at least in part and thanks to Donald Trump who wants a very particular type of credit for this development he tweeted this do you think the three UCLA players will say Thank You president Trump they were headed for ten years in jail exclamation point there so like he let's say he did it it seems like he did it it's within his power to do it it's the sort of thing you'd expect the President to do he could say you know was glad to be able to help out the players but in this he's saying you think I'll get a thank you yeah you know the crazy thing is I know that we're very critical of Trump but we're not I don't think that we're critical needlessly like we're critical when it matters so when he actually did intervene and then it was reported yesterday that the players would be released and sent back home to the US I thought to myself okay good Trump did something yeah you know that's awesome now let's see if he can ruin it and then he ruins it ruins it just let it go he's such a thin-skinned egotistical maniac just let it go so so he tended that so we want to show what the students actually said in their press conference so and then we'll break down why he might have predicted that he might not get a thank you so let's jump to a video to here you're gonna see the press conference of some of the students now saying you know what had happened in their ordeal to president Trump in the United States government thank you for taking the time to intervene on our behalf we really appreciate you helping us out I'd also like to thank President Trump in the United States government for the help that they provided as well thank you to the pac-12 and the Hulk UCLA community that helped us to hold with and thank you to United States government and President Trump for your efforts to bring us all so you asked for it you get it now what is everyone happy now does that change anything does it make you feel better oh yeah my president got his props from written statements from college kids who went over and they did a minute by the way in that press conference that they do yeah yeah it was yeah and then because that was I think some of the questions was whether or not they were targeted and wrongfully accused and all that stuff so they did they all admitted that they were took part in it and so oh my god did he got his apology and I tweeted this earlier oh so what is President Trump gonna we're waiting I'm demanding is your welcome to these thankful students who bowed their heads and made sure they said oh yeah I'm sorry thinking Thank You mr. president like this is is this useful this do anything for you except for humiliate these three guys so why in the first place rather than simply waiting to see what they said why did he come out and say I'm not probably I'm really I'm probably not gonna get it thank you why is that I know what we know okay we'll look why why jry because go ahead well first off he wants he wants to be put on notice that he's the shit mom when am I gonna get some some attention and some some kind of respect somebody's got to talk about things I've done this is a win for me I was about to give you some respect in regard to this story until you went off and acted like a child a freaking child on Twitter just it's it's amazing he's like completely unaware of how to behave like an adult seriously I again for the billionth time I was super supportive of how this all went down until he tweeted that yeah and so look we got it we got acknowledge that he rallied his supporters to his side just a couple of months ago with the NFL issue trying to turn the American public against people who are trying to draw just a little bit of notice to some of their extremely long-standing racial grievances against the the justice system in the US against police and those sorts of things and they they loved that they ate that up the Trump fans and so now you have some more athletes I noticed they weren't all white and for some reason he automatically assumes that they're not going to credit him with helping them out and I I didn't I didn't pull the tweets or anything like that but you had given me tweets when Fox reported on this there were tweets about these damn thugs they're entitled do all that stuff and so this is again an attempt to use racial grievances to try to rally support for him and of course the kids didn't they did granted him you could have simply waited a few minutes maybe it was hard for them to say something because they were in a Chinese prison and then on an international flight just do it yeah he didn't even really give them an opportunity to you know say thank you considering that it was just announced yesterday that they would be released and then you're right that international flight you know you don't even have Wi-Fi on a lot of those flights exactly or you gotta pay extra they don't give us a day they got to get home that's the first important point homeboy hasn't had any legislative wins he hasn't succeeded in anything other than naming a Supreme Court justice right and he's this is a story we're gonna do in our to but he's going to foreign countries begging them to buy our weapons so he can show the world that he's doing something yeah as if American voters are like you know I'd really feel better about my life if we were selling more of our weapons to foreign countries exactly yeah like he's desperately trying to show that he's winning at something and instead of actually focusing on policy driven you know intentions he's focusing on bullying college basketball players into giving him credit for what he did yes look as we transition to some good news I have no idea what the politics of those particular students are they play a sport and CEO be shocked to find out I don't know who they're probably huh but probably not at all I was thinking for myself and so I turned this to you how long would you be willing to be in a Chinese prison rather than be sprung by Donald Trump and you have to thank him I I have I do we have a high Dori week I think Young Turks membership creates independent media believe me no ads believe me all the show believe me on demand believe me support independent media believe me it's awesome tremendous you'll love it believe me and by the end you'll be thinking you know I'm like a smart person tea white tea network.com /join
