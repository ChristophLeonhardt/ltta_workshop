>> DONALD TRUMP REVERSING THE
OBAMA ERA ATOMIC AGREEMENT AND
PROMISING TO USE THE FULL FORCE
OF AMERICAN SANCTIONS TO
SUFFOCATE IRAN'S NUCLEAR
AMBITIONS.
STATE DEPARTMENT PRESS OFFICER
ANALYST FOR THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT MORGAN ORTEGAS.
GOOD MORNING.
YESTERDAY EVERYBODY WAS TALKING
ABOUT WE LOVE THE AGREEMENTS, WE
HATE THE AGREEMENT BUT WHAT
HAPPENS IN 90 DAYS?
>> THERE IS A FALSE EQUIVALENCY,
THERE IS THE DEAL OR THE WAR, A
BINARY CHOICE AND I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL HAPPEN.
HERE IS WHERE IT BECOMES AN
INTERESTING MOMENT IN TIME WITH
OUR ALLIES.
WE HAVE OUR ALLIES ON A
DIFFERENT PAGE.
WHEN THE PRES. MADE THE DECISION
YESTERDAY SAUDI ARABIA AND
ISRAEL CAME OUT WITH SUPPORTIVE
PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND BACKS UP
WHAT THE PRES. SAID ABOUT HIS
DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE
DEAL, BAILEY BALLISTIC MISSILES,
THE WHOLE LIST.
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH OUR EUROPEAN
ALLIES.
THEY HAVE OVER THE PAST WEEK 2
YEARS AND SANCTIONS WERE
RELEASED DONE A LOT OF BUSINESS
IN IRAN.
YOU SAY TO THESE EUROPEAN
COMPANIES UNDER WHAT THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT SAID
YESTERDAY YOU HAVE TO WALK BACK
THAT BUSINESS.
IT WILL BE A HARD POOL FOR THE
EUROPEANS TO SWALLOW.
WHAT YOU SAW THE IRANIAN REGIME
COME OUT WITH, WE WILL CONTINUE
TO ABIDE BY THE DEAL.
HERE IS THE TOUGH CHOICE FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION AND THE TREASURY
DEPARTMENT, IF THE EUROPEANS
STAY IN THE DEAL AND EUROPEAN
BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO DO
BUSINESS IN IRAN WILL WE START
SANCTIONING EUROPEAN COMPANIES?
YOU HAVE SEEN MANY EUROPEAN
BANKS IN NEW YORK CITY THAT WERE
FINED HEAVILY FOR DOING BUSINESS
IN IRAN.
BANKS HAVEN'T GONE BACK IN SINCE
THAT ACTION HAPPENED.
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE
SHOWDOWN.
IT IS A FALSE CHOICE.
ROB: IT SEEMS TO BE LOOKING AT
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID, THE US
MAYBE GET SANCTIONING BANKING,
ENERGY AND RELATED ACTIVITIES
BUT IN 90 DAYS THE US MAY
SANCTION ANYTHING ELSE EXEMPTED
UNDER THE JC TOA.
ALL THINGS IN LIFE --
>> YOU ARE SEEING SOME DEALS
WITH BOEING AND OTHERS THAT HAVE
WAIVERS, BUSINESS DEALS, TO DO
THOSE DEALS IN IRAN THE TREASURY
SECRETARY, STEVE MNUCHIN SAID
THOSE WAIVERS WOULD BE WALKED
BACK BUT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE
ALLOWED.
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A
TOUGH DECISION TO MAKE RELATING
TO EUROPEAN ALLIES BUT A FALSE
EQUIVALENT TO SAY ALL OUR ALLIES
ARE POURING OUT.
OUR ALLIES ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE
OF THIS, THEY ARE THE MOST
DIRECTLY THREATENED BY IRAN AND
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE SUPPORTING
THESE ACTIONS.
>> MIKE POMPEO, WHAT IS HE GOING
TO ACCOMPLISH?
JUST GETTING THESE INDIVIDUALS
BACK, SETTING THE STAGE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM DO?
>> I HAVE LUNCH WITH SOMEONE
FROM BILL CLINTON'S WORLD GOING
TO NORTH KOREA WITH THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, HE WAS BLOWN
AWAY WITH WHAT TRUMP HAS BEEN
ABLE TO DO IN GIVING MEETINGS TO
THE TABLE.
SECRETARY POMPEO WAS CLEARLY
THERE TO LAY OUT THE TERMS OF
THE DEAL BUT THE REAL REASON IS
TO HOPEFULLY GET THESE THREE
AMERICAN HOSTAGES BACK AND
HOPEFULLY THEY ARE IN BETTER
CONDITION THAN AUTO --OTTO WARMB
CONDITION THAN AUTO --OTTO WAR B
WARMBIER
WARMBIE
WARMBIER.
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT OUR
FRIENDS IN THIS PRES. IS RIGHT
TO BE TALKING -- POMPEO IS THE
BEST MESSENGER.
ROB: WHEN YOU START A JOB YOU
