WITHOUT POWER. Shannon: RICK REICHMUTH, THANK YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP FRESH OF A RALLY IN ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA, MONITORING THE DEADLY STORM MOVING TO THE SOUTHEAST COAST, HE JOINS US NOW ON THE PHONE. MR. PRESIDENT, WELCOME TO "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT." President Trump: HI, SHANNON. Shannon: LET ME START BY ASKING ABOUT THE HURRICANE RESPONSE AND CORONATION. I GREW UP IN THE PANHANDLE. A LOT OF FOLKS I LOVE OR HATE TODAY. I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL GOVERNORS. HOW DOES IT LOOK? President Trump: IT WAS A TOUGH WIND STORM. THE WIND WAS PROBABLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I WAS LISTENING TO RICK. THIRD OR FOURTH EVER IN RECORDED HISTORY AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S SO DARK. ELECTRIC IS OUT. WE HEAR THERE'S A LOT OF DAMAGE. TREMENDOUS WIND DAMAGE, A LOT OF THINGS BLOWN OVER. HOPEFULLY NOT HOUSES WITH PEOPLE IN THEM. Shannon: YOU ARE CRITICIZED TONIGHT BY SOME FOR GOING TO THE RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO YOUR CRITICS. President Trump: IF I DIDN'T GO, THEY WOULD ALSO CRITICIZE. THIS WAS SET UP A LONG TIME AGO. WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED UP FROM YESTERDAY. I MEAN LITERALLY THEY STAYED 24 HOURS AND SOMETIMES MORE THAN THAT TO GO TO THESE RALLIES. THEY LIKE THEM. YOU PROBABLY SAW THE PICTURES ON TELEVISION TONIGHT. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE AFTER THE ARENA. IT WAS A BIG ARENA. BUT IT WAS FULL. WE HAD 15 OR BEYOND THAT THOUSAND PEOPLE OUTSIDE. YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE WAITING FOR HOURS, MANY HOURS. IF I DIDN'T GO, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG THING TOO. MORE PORTLY THAN ANYTHING, WE HAVE PEOPLE IN FLORIDA, PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I HAD EVERYTHING SET UP ON AIR FORCE ONE. I WAS IN TOTAL COMMUNICATION. I SPOKE WITH THE GOVERNORS OF ALABAMA, THE GOVERNOR, AS YOU KNOW, OF GEORGIA. I SPOKE WITH RICK SCOTT. WE WERE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION. DID THE RALLY AND PEOPLE HAD A FANTASTIC TIME. WAS A VERY IMPORTANT RALLY TONIGHT BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN VERY UNFAIR TO HAVE PEOPLE WAITING FOR TEN, 12, MORE THAN THAT HOURS AND THEN SAVED BY THE WAY, I'M NOT GOING TO BE THERE TONIGHT. STU AND MR. PRESIDENT, AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE TO GO, YOU LIKE TO GO TOO. YOU LIKE TO BE CAMPAIGNING. POLITICO HAD THIS HEADLINE YESTERDAY. G.O.P. HOUSES CRUMBLING. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TURNED OUT FOR YOU IN 2016, ARE YOU CONFIDENT THEY WILL SHOW UP IN THE MIDTERMS? President Trump: THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET OUT. I GUESS PEOPLE LIKE ME BECAUSE YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND YOU SEE THE POLL NUMBERS. 52 TODAY, ONE OF THE BIG POLES. THEY SAY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE BEYOND THAT. WHEN THEY HANG UP, THEY SAY THAT'S A TRUMP MOTOR AND THAT'S MY KIND OF PERSON. I THINK WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL. LOOKING AT THE SENATE VOTES. RACES THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO CONTEST, WE ARE NOW WINNING. IF YOU LOOK AT NORTH DAKOTA. I COULD NAME FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM BUT I DON'T WANT TO JINX MYSELF. MANY OF THE SENATE RACES WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE EVEN GOING TO BE CONTESTING TO A LARGE EXTENT, WE ARE NOW LEADING. WE HAVE SOME GREAT CANDIDATES. VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE FINDING THE SAME THING NOW WITH THE HOUSE. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE HORRIBLE ABUSE THAT NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH SUFFERED LAST WEEK AT THE HANDS OF THESE DEMOCRATS. THEY WENT ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. IT WAS DISGRACEFUL. I THINK THEY DISGRACE THEIR PARTY AND THEY DISGRACED THEMSELVES. Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU. TODAY THE FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY WAS TAKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM SOME OF THOSE DEMOCRATS. SOME ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND WHO OPPOSED NOW JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. THEY WERE PRESSING THE FBI DIRECTOR ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU OR OTHERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE TIED HIS HANDS WITH REGARDS THE SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION. WHAT DO YOU SAY? President Trump: WHAT DID HE SAY? I WAS WORKING ON THE HURRICANE AND OTHER THINGS. Shannon: HE SAID THERE WERE SOME THINGS HE COULDN'T DIVULGE AND THEY WERE CARRIED OUT BY STANDARD PROCEDURE. A LOT OF FOLKS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD RELEASE THE FBI SCOPE LETTER. President Trump: I WOULD DO WHATEVER THEY SENATE WANTED. THE SENATE WAS SO WELL RUN BY SENATOR GRASSLEY. WHATEVER THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO IS OKAY WITH ME. IF THEY WANT TO RELEASE, IT'S OKAY. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO, I CAN UNDERSTAND IT ALSO. AGAIN, IT WAS GOING TO BE THEIR VOTE AND ELECT THEM DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO DO. THAT INCLUDED THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF. WHAT THEY WANTED AND IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING, THEY WANTED ME TO LET THEM KNOW OR THEY COULD HAVE DIRECTLY LEFT THE FBI KNOW AS FAR AS I WOULD BE CONCERNED. OBVIOUSLY THE REPORTS WERE VERY STRONG BECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT READ THEM CAME AWAY AND SAID EVERYTHING SAID WAS TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED OR NOT TRUE. I THINK IT WAS A DISGRACE FRANKLY. AND I AM GLAD WE WENT THE EXTRA WEEK BECAUSE BY COMING THE EXTRA WEEK AND GOING THE EXTRA WEEK, WE ENDED UP EXACTLY WITH THAT. SO IT WAS IT WAS IN MANY WAYS A VERY SAD. LACK OF TIME FOR THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE THAT GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH AND HIS FAMILY AND HIS YOUNG DAUGHTERS TO GO THROUGH A SITUATION LIKE THAT WHERE THEY WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW WHO LEAKED IT. THEY WERE LEAKING THINGS AND DOING THINGS AND SAYING THINGS THAT WERE INAPPROPRIATE. I THINK DEMOCRATS DISGRACE THEMSELVES DURING THE HEARINGS. Shannon: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DR. FORD? DO YOU THINK SHE WENT THROUGH A TOUGH TIME? DO YOU THINK SHE WAS ACTING ON HER OWN? DO YOU THINK SHE WAS ACTING ON POLITICAL OR PARTY PRESSURE? President Trump: I DON'T HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT. THAT WAS 36 YEARS AGO. THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS DURING THIS LONG, LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT, SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT THERE OR HOW SHE GOT BACK WHERE THE TIME OR THE YEAR. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE HOUSE. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT SECTION, THE AREA. SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD ONE BEER. SHE SAID SHE HAD ONE BEER. THAT'S ABOUT IT. DO I HAVE A STATEMENT TO MAKE? NO, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS. I REALLY BELIEVE YOU NEED A LOT MORE THAN THAT TO TAKE SOMEBODY WHO IS A WORLD-CLASS STUDENT, WHO WAS A HARD WORKER, NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. THIS WASN'T COVERED BY A FEW TAKE FROM THE TIME HE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE TO RIGHT NOW, HE LET A VERY SPECTACULAR, CLEAN LIFE, A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IF HE DIDN'T, HE WAS A HIGH JUDGE, SECOND HIGHEST COURT, AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO. IF HE DIDN'T COME IT WOULD'VE BEEN REPORTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALMOST LIKE IT WOULD BE REPORTED IF I DID IT. Shannon: WITH THE MINOR EXCEPTIONS, I WOULD SAY MOST FOLKS THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY RESTRAINED WHEN IT CAME TO DR. FORD COMMENTING ON THE KAVANAUGH PROCESS, WAS THAT DIFFICULT FOR YOU? IS IT SOMETHING YOU THINK YOU WILL TOO WITH OTHER MAJOR ISSUES AS WELL? President Trump: I LIKED THE JOB THE SENATE DID. I THOUGHT THEY WERE DIGNIFIED IN TERMS OF THE REPUBLICANS THAT IS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT TIME. THEY COULD'VE TAKEN A MUCH EARLIER VOTE, AS YOU KNOW. THEY WAITED. THEY WATCHED. THEY ASKED THE FBI TO DO A SEVENTH INVESTIGATION. DON'T FORGET THAT WAS THE SEVENTH INVESTIGATION, SHANNON. THEY ASKED FOR A SEVENTH INVESTIGATION OBVIOUSLY IT WAS VERY STRONG. SUSAN COLLINS AND LINDSEY GRAHAM AND EVERYBODY THAT WENT TO READ IT CAME OUT AND SAID WOW. NUMBER ONE, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THOROUGH. NUMBER TWO, THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. I'M GLAD WE TOOK THE EXTRA WEEK AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID I WAS RESTRAINED. I THINK THAT'S GOOD. I WAS RESTRAINED ALSO BECAUSE THE SENATE REALLY WAS DOING THEIR JOB, AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S COME UP TONIGHT. SENATE AND FOREIGN POLICY, THE ISSUE OF THE MISSING "WASHINGTON POST" JOURNALIST, THE SAUDI MAN. THERE IS CONFLICTING INFORMATION BUT SENATOR CORKER HIMSELF, REPUBLICAN, SAID BASED ON U.S. INTEL THAT HE HAS SEEN, HE SAYS EVERYTHING POINTS TO THE SAUDIS BEING RESPONSIBLE THAT HE DISAPPEARED OR HE'S BEEN KILLED. THE TURKS SAY THE SAME. THE SAUDIS DENY IT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAUDIS? IF YOU BECOME CONVINCED, THE ADMINISTRATION BECOMES CONVINCED THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEATH OR TO PARENTS. President Trump: IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY AT ALL. I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY SO FAR IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT WERE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE. WE ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON IT. IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE A GOOD THING AT ALL. Shannon: WHAT ABOUT THE SENATORS, BIPARTISAN TALK THEY WOULD BLOCK ANY FURTHER ARMS SALES TO SAUDI. WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT? President Trump: THAT WOULD BE HURTING US. WE HAVE JOBS. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S DOING PROBABLY BETTER ECONOMICALLY THAN IT'S EVER DONE BEFORE. PART OF THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH OUR DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND EVERYBODY IS WANTING THEM AND FRANKLY I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY TOUGH PILL TO SWALLOW FOR OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE QUICK TO JUMP THAT WAY. I WOULD HAVE TO FIND OUT REALLY BEFORE I DISCUSS IT, I'D HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WE ARE LOOKING AND SO ARE OTHER PEOPLE. TURKEY IS LOOKING. A COUPLE OF OTHERS ARE LOOKING. THEY ARE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE INVOLVED. WE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. I DO HATE TO COMMIT TO WHAT RECOURSE WE WOULD TAKE. IT'S TOO EARLY. Shannon: HAVE YOU NARROWED YOUR LIST OR MADE A DECISION ABOUT REPLACING AMBASSADOR HALEY? President Trump: FIRST OF ALL, NIKKI WAS FANTASTIC AND THE INCREDIBLE THING IS I REALLY HAVE FIVE OR SIX FANTASTIC PEOPLE. I THINK THEY WOULD ALL DO THE JOB REALLY WELL. THE ANSWER IS YES, I DON'T EXPECT TO BE ADDING ANYBODY TO THE LIST. WE HAVE SOME REALLY TALENTED, BRILLIANT PEOPLE THAT WILL DO A GREAT JOB. PROBABLY OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO, I WILL ANNOUNCE IT NIKKI IS GOING TO BE HERE TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND SO ANYBODY WILL BE WORKING WITH HER FOR A LITTLE PERIOD OF TIME AT LEAST WHICH WILL BE GOOD. BUT IT'S SOMETIME IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, I WILL BE ANNOUNCING THE NAME. Shannon: YOU CAN COME BACK HERE AT 11:00 ANY TIME. President Trump: THE SHOW IS GREAT. I THINK I WILL DO IT. Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A PIECE YOU WROTE GOING AFTER THE MEDICARE FOR ALL IDEA. YOU CALLED THE DEMOCRATS RADICAL SOCIALIST. YOU SAY THEY WANT TO TURN THE U.S. INTO VENEZUELA. NOT SURPRISINGLY, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS SAID YOU ARE LYING ABOUT HIS PROPOSAL AND HE SAYS THE POLL SHOWED THAT AMERICANS WANT WHAT HE IS PROPOSING FOR YOUR RESPONSE. President Trump: I DON'T THINK SO. IF YOU DO WHAT HE SAYS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE VENEZUELA AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIFT UP YOUR TAXES BY THREE TIMES. WE HAVE BEEN CUTTING TAXES. WE ARE GIVING GREAT HEALTH CARE PLANS. WE JUST CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER CONCEPT OF A PLAN TODAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LIKING VERY MUCH. WE ARE DOING A REAL JOB. WE GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT PEOPLE HATED WHICH WAS HORRIBLE. IT WAS THE OBAMA PLAN AND OBAMACARE. WE ARE ALSO KEEPING THE PREMIUMS DOWN AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL THAN THEY EVER WERE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. WE HAD IT BEAT OTHER THAN ONE SENATOR. YOU COULD PUT IT DIFFERENTLY. ONE SENATOR LATE IN THE EVENING HAPPEN TO VOTE AGAINST IT, SHOCKINGLY EVEN THOUGH HE CAMPAIGNED FOR EIGHT YEARS AGAINST IT. WE HAD IT DOWN. IT WAS REPEAL AND REPLACE. WE ARE COMING UP WITH, REALLY COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE JUST AS GOOD AND IN SOME CASES MAY BE EVEN BETTER. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE PREMIUMS DOWN MUCH LOWER THAN THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THAT'S REALLY THROUGH GOOD MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE THINGS HAPPENING ON HEALTH CARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY EXCITING. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT BERNIE AND NOBODY EVER SAYS IT, BUT THE COUNTRY IS NOT RICH ENOUGH TO EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND NUMBER TWO, IF YOU DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO, IT WOULD BE LOUSY HEALTH CARE. REALLY LOUSY HEALTH CARE. I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL. WE ARE RIGHT ON IT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE ARE RIGHT ON IT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, I AM SEEING POLL SHOWING US AS PER THE FIRST PART OF OUR CONVERSATION, THAT THAT THE SENATE, EVERYONE SAYS WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. THE HOUSE. I THINK WE'RE DOING ALMOST AS WELL WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSE. Shannon: WITH THE POLLS THAT SHOW THE HOUSE SLIPPING AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICANS AND INTO THE HANDS OF THE DEMOCRATS, DO YOU THINK THEY ARE INACCURATE PURPOSELY? DO YOU THINK THEY ARE FLAWED? ARE PEOPLE NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND DON'T TRUST POLLSTERS? President Trump: I HAVE HAD MANY INACCURATE POLLS AND I'VE HAD SOME I FOUND RASMUSSEN TO BE ACCURATE. THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES" WAS A VERY ACCURATE POLL. BUSINESS INVESTORS DAILY. WE HAVE SOME POLLS THAT WERE VERY ACCURATE HAVING TO DO WITH 2016. BUT WE HAD SOME POLLS THAT WERE SO FAR OUT AND WE KNEW THEY WERE PHONY POLLS. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT. I THINK POLLS, THEY CALL IT A GENERIC POLL AND ACTUALLY THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING WELL IN THE GENERIC POLL BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT A GENERIC POLL MEANS ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE INDIVIDUAL RACES, THE HOUSE. MANY INDIVIDUAL RACES. I THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL. WE'RE LOOKING AT RACES THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO BE WINNING AND NOW WE ARE EVEN AND UP. HONESTLY WE ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW UNTIL NOVEMBER 6. WE ARE REALLY NOT GOING TO KNOW. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WHATEVER IT IS. I AM OUT THERE WORKING HARD, DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS FOR HOUSE MEMBERS AS WELL AS FOR SENATE. THEY ALL WANT ME OUT THERE AND WE ARE GETTING TREMENDOUS CROWDS AND WERE GETTING THE WORD OUT. WE ARE GETTING THE WORD OUT. Shannon: WANT TO ASK YOU ANOTHER HEALTH CARE QUESTIONS. CRITICS SAY YOU'RE STRIPPING AWAY PRE-EXISTING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN THESE PLANS. THEY SAY THAT THE PLANS ARE CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY OFFER LESS. WILL YOU COMMIT TO COVERING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS? President Trump: I HAVE FOR MONTHS. IF YOU LISTEN TO MY SPEECHES, I'M SAYING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COVERED 100% AND REPUBLICANS ARE DOING THAT. THERE WAS A TIME WHERE THERE WASN'T BEING DONE. THERE WAS A TIME FOR MANY YEARS WHERE IT WASN'T DONE AT ALL AND NOT EVEN THOUGHT OF. WERE 100% PER PRE-EXISTING UNCOVERING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND IF YOU LOOK AT MY LAST, FOR MANY MONTHS, SPEECHES, I COVER I SAY WE WILL COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THE DIFFERENCE IS DEMOCRATS WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT IN THEIR PLANS AND IT DOESN'T WORK MONETARILY. THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT. Shannon: TOMORROW YOU HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST FOR LUNCH, KANYE WEST IS COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. HOW DOES THIS WORK? DOES HE TELL YOU WHAT HE WANTS FOR LUNCH? DO YOU PICK? President Trump: THAT WAS NEVER DISCUSSED. JIM BROWN, MAYBE THE GREATEST RUNNING BACK EVER. HE WAS A GREAT LACROSSE PLAYER. SOME PEOPLE SAY HE WAS A BETTER LACROSSE PLAYER. HE'S A GREAT ATHLETE. JIM BROWN IS COMING. JIM HAS BEEN A SUPPORTER FROM THE BEGINNING OF ME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT, IT'S THE BEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL EVER IN HISTORY. YOU LOOK AT MEDIAN INCOME FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN. IT'S AT THE BEST EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. I AM DOING THINGS FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN DONE BY THE DEMOCRATS AND AS YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS REALLY HAVE HAD THAT VOTE. THEY'VE HAD THAT VOTE LOCKED UP. IT'S NOT SO LOCKED UP ANYMORE. I AM PRODUCING NUMBERS THAT THEY WERE NEVER ABLE TO PRODUCE. IT'S A GREAT THING. KANYE WEST SAW THAT. KANYE IS A SMART GUY. HE SAW THAT. JIM BROWN SOUGHT. I COULD NAME MANY OTHER GREAT BLACK STARS AND ATHLETES THAT ARE ON OUR SIDE. YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE A NEW REPORT ABOUT THEM. WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND IT'S GAINING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE I'M PRODUCING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT NUMBERS LIKE THAT, WHEN IT'S THE BEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, HOW CAN SOME OF? Shannon: HOW LONG DOES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STICK AROUND, MR. PRESIDENT ? President Trump: WELL, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. LET'S ALL SEE. THE NICE PART IS THAT WE ARE, EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOGETHER. I HAVE A GREAT, I REALLY HAVE A GREAT CABINET. EVERYBODY IS WORKING HARD. THEY ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER. AS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE, THINGS ARE GOING VERY WELL. WE FINISHED A BIG DEAL WITH CANADA, MEXICO. WE FINISHED THE DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. WE ARE WINNING WITH CHINA. CHINA WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL BADLY. WE ARE WINNING WITH CHINA. WE ARE WINNING AT EVERY FRONT AND THAT'S THE WAY WANT TO KEEP IT. WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH SOME OTHER POSITIONS BUT I WILL SAY WE HAVE A GREAT CABINET. I THINK WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST CABINETS EVER. Shannon: HOW WOULD YOU RATE, I'M GETTING TO GIVE YOU THREE SENATORS. WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE? MITCH MCCONNELL, CHUCK GRASSLEY, LINDSEY GRAHAM? President Trump: ALL OF THEM. I LIKE THEM ALL. DON'T GET ME INTO THAT. IT COULD GET ME INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE. CHUCK GRASSLEY IS A STRONG GUY, GRUFF. I SAY THAT IN AN AFFECTIONATE WAY. HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THAT WAS NOT EASY AND THEN THEY SEND THE PHONE HE PAID PROTESTERS AND SCREAMING ALL THE TIME. FRANKLY, THEY LET THEM SCREEN BECAUSE THEY DISCREDITED THEMSELVES AND THEY WERE ALL PUT UP BY THE DEMOCRATS. THE DEMOCRATS ADMITTED THAT THEY WORKED WITH THESE PEOPLE. IT'S TERRIBLE. CHUCK GRASSLEY DID A GREAT JOB. AS YOU KNOW, LINDSAY WAS OUTSTANDING. I MEAN, LINDSAY WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. HIS LEVEL COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IT WAS SO NASTY AND SO FALSE AND SO, SUCH FABRICATED STORIES AND LIES. LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS INCREDIBLE. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF MITCH FOR A LONG TIME. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WHICH AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS TOGETHER AND MITCH WAS FANTASTI FANTASTIC. REALLY ALL THREE WERE STARS. Shannon: ONE LAST QUESTION TO YOU BEFORE WE GO. THE DOW, A LOT OF FOLKS CONCERNED. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD SOME THEORIES. SOME CRITICS SAY IT'S IN PART BECAUSE OF THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? President Trump: I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT AT ALL. THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM TARIFFS FROM CHINESE GOODS AND IT HASN'T HURT US. WE ARE TAKING IN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PRODUCTS HERE THAT WE ARE BUYING IN CHINA. THAT WASN'T AT. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITH THE FED. THE FED IS GOING WILD. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PROBLEM IS THAT THEY ARE RAISING INTEREST RATES AND IT'S RIDICULOUS. I DON'T CALL THEM TRADE WARS. I SAY WE ARE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF BATTLE, NOT MUCH BUT CHINA, YOU KNOW, WE PUT $250 BILLION WITH OF TARIFFS AND POTENTIAL TARIFFS AT 25%. WE HAVE 267 BILLION MORE IF I WANT TO DO IT. THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. HEY, YOU SAID AND WE ALL SAID OH, CANADA WILL NEVER MAKE A DEAL. CANADA MADE A DRILL THAT'S A GREAT DEAL. WE OPENED UP CANADA FOR OUR FARMERS. YOU LOOK AT MEXICO BARELY MADE THE DEAL. LOOK AT THE HORRIBLE DEAL WITH WE HAD WITH SOUTH KOREA. THAT WAS THROWN OUT AND RENEGOTIATED AND NOW IT'S A GOOD DEAL. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IN MY OPINION IS TREASURY AND THE FED. THE FED IS GOING LOCO AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM TO DO IT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. Shannon: ON THE ISSUE OF CIVILITY TODAY WE HEARD FROM THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER SAYING INCENTIVE WE GO LOW, WE GO HIGH. HE SAID WHEN WE GO HILLARY CLINTON SAID WE DON'T RETURN TO CIVILITY BECAUSE POWER IS THE ONLY THING REPUBLICANS UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU PRESS PEOPLE ON THAT, THEY WILL SAY YOU STARTED THIS BY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO ROUGH UP PROTESTERS AND BY GOING AFTER PEOPLE WITH NICKNAMES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS. HOW DO YOU RESPOND? President Trump: I DON'T THINK SO. MY RALLIES HAVE BEEN VERY PEACEFUL AND EVEN AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THERE SEEMED TO BE CONFLICT, THEY SENT PAID PEOPLE TO DISRUPT OUR RALLIES. WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW, BAD THINGS HAPPEN. THEY WERE THE ONES THAT STARTED EVERYTHING. NO, IT WASN'T US. IT WAS TOTALLY THE OTHER SIDE. I WOULD HAVE A RALLY AND PAID PEOPLE WERE GOING INTO THOSE RALLIES CAUSING TROUBLE. IN MANY CASES, IT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL FOR THOSE PEOPLE. Shannon: BUT NOT OKAY TO PUNCH THEM. President Trump: SHANNON, PAID PEOPLE WERE IN THOSE RALLIES. WHEN I HEAR HOLDER MAKING A STATEMENT LIKE HE DID TODAY, IT'S A DISGRACE. HILLARY, I REALLY UNDERSTAND. SHE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. SHE NEVER DID. SHE NEVER WILL AND THAT'S WHY SHE LOST THE ELECTION. Shannon: I THINK WE ALL HOPE WE CAN GET BACK TO SOME FORM OF CIVILITY OR WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS AND RESPECT EACH OTHER IN THE PROCESS. President Trump: I HOPE SO TOO. I DO. Shannon: MR. PRESIDENT, WE
