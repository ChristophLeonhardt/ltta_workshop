is Donald Trump going to talk to Robert Muller and answer questions about the Russia investigation when asked about this in an impromptu get-together with reporters he just stumbled into it he was at the White House they were over at another office and Trump comes by and staffers you could almost see them going no so he comes by and they say hey are you gonna talk to Muller he says I'm looking forward to it actually great can't wait he says here's the story just so you understand there's been no collusion whatsoever there's no obstruction whatsoever and I'm looking forward to it oh please talk to mama please please please please okay so he thinks he's gonna outsmart Muller I got more on that in a second oh great it's gonna be awesome but then here's the most important part but would you do it under oath because if you lie under oath that's a crime quote I would do it under oath absolutely now here was his Republican allies reaction to that quote when then he asked about Hillary Clinton did she do it on he said she didn't do it under oath when she talked to the FBI but he continued but I would do it under oath I would okay great have at it Hoss can't wait now I don't believe him as I'll explain at the end here but just so you understand under oath is usually in front of a grand jury he's never gonna do that but it's okay he doesn't need to be on the road when you return to the FBI if you lie to the FBI that is a felony so that would already be a crime all he has to do is go and talk to Muller the special counsel and and if he lies he'll already be in that'll already be a criminal violation so but he doesn't understand anything he told the reporters that he's just fighting back and he says if you fight back oh it's obstruction no no there's two different ways of fighting back which are very very important one is hey I didn't do it let me explain to you how I didn't do it and here's my evidence for my no links to Russia or you don't have evidence that I could prove that or I could show that to you right we're gonna just flat-out denied that's fighting back and you've got every right to fight back in every way in that sense the other way to fight back is what Trump is doing oh the guy investigating me I'm gonna fire no you can't that's not fighting back that's obstruction of justice that's not saying I'm right about the case and I'm and I'm talking to investigators that's saying I'm gonna fire the cop who's on the case I'm gonna fire the detective on the case in this case it was FBI director James Comey they asked him why he said he was investigating he was investigated Russia so I fired him that's not fighting back that's obstruction of justice you can't end the investigation of yourself but he's too stupid to understand that and he stupid is stupid to understand that he has no chance of outwitting anyone let alone Muller let alone anyone at the FBI okay people familiar with mr. Trump's thinking have long described private conversations with the president in which he has said he is eager to meet with mr. Muller a product of his belief that he can sell or coax almost anyone into seeing things his way oh please do that please I'm begging you do that oh no no Donald you are totally right I bet that you are smarter Robert Miller I mean I know that you're a very stable genius I know you're like a very smart person so you scored a 30 out of 30 on a test that decided whether you have dementia or not so you've got this brother you got it okay coach I bet you talk mother out of it go for it now here was Republican reaction to him thinking he could outsmart Robert Muller all right they said you sure you want to do this he said quote I would love to do that I'd like to do it as soon as possible another mistake so then his lawyer Ty Cobb jumps in with his funny name and mustache and he says uh he's ready to meet with them but he'll be guided by the advice of his personal counsel in other words you know I think we have video from his lawyer too okay Christopher ruddy is one of his better friends they golf together all the time we talk on the phone all the time when he goes on TV and and sticks up for Donald Trump he runs Newsmax at conservative outlet he said Trump should treat mother like a plague he should assert executive privilege in every opportunity they can in fact we have a clip of Christopher ruddy on television Roger stone says the president would be very poorly advised to give Muller an interview Roger Stone's a devious guy but ain't stupid you're an idiot and in fact one more Roger stone said I find it to be a death wish and added now here comes other conservative figures to say likewise here's rush limbaugh there are complete seeing opinions on whether or not Trump has to talk to Mahler whether he should do he shouldn't if you ask me don't do it I don't care what format I don't care what circumstances don't do it there's nothing to gain especially if they're off the collusion business there's nothing to gain by talking the Mahler a one more clip from Rush Limbaugh okay look the reality is these guys know the same thing we know which is Donald Trump's an idiot he's not gonna outsmart anyone let alone Muller second of all he did it so he's gonna accidentally spill the beans and then he won't be able to back out of it because lying to the FBI is a federal crime so but he and all of his friends who claim on TV that they think he's a genius and all this stuff here's Lou Dobbs I mean the president is insisting that he will speak with a special counsel I think all these leaks that we've gotten from the special counsel's office indicate that there isn't there there in terms of Trump colluding with Russia to steal an election and that they are interested in coming up with something else to justify their probe we have a trap and he needs to be careful and he needs to not I know he thinks well he didn't do anything wrong so what's the problem just talk to them that's not how the FBI works that's not how Moeller works he needs to be thoughtful about this right right my favorite was Dobbs like oh no don't do that because even Dobbs knows he's a moron oh sorry one more from Dobbs what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm / join
