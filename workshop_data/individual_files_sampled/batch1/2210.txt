he looked at me and said Jim you've done some stupid things in your life this is about the dumbest thing you've ever done I thought my dad would like put his arm around me you know when I'm going back into the family business I'm gonna keep alive this you know 150 year old tradition I thought it'd be like a father-son bonding moment and it wasn't at all I had you know a really good job I was making something like a quarter of a million dollars a year my dad had been a brewmaster my grandfather my great grandfather my great great grandfather my great great grandfather and beer was kind of in my family it was in my blood about a point o4 so a nice safe level 95% of the breweries in America have been squeezed out of business by the big national breweries he couldn't see that there'd be any place for a small brewer in that industry consolidation I was gonna make very high quality American beer made with traditional brewing processes and the best highest quality ingredients and give it to people fresh finally you know my dad sort of absorbed it and came around and he took me up in the attic and opened up a trunk and out of that were the family brewing materials long story short I got a recipe for the beer that became Samuel Adams Boston lager
