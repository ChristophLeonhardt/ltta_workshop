KINETIC ENERGY FLOWING.

53
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:37,962
FOLKS ALL OF A SUDDEN SAID, THIS

54
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:39,497
ACTUALLY DID NOT HAPPEN AND IF

55
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:40,898
YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN, WE HAVE TO

56
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:44,636
START MOVING.

57
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:47,005
THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING VERY

58
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:47,605
POSITIVE MOVES.

59
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,407
>> THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TWO

60
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:51,776
TEAMS IN THE REGION, ONE LED BY

61
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:52,844
DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF JOE HAGAN

62
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:55,146
IS IN SINGAPORE TO WORK OUT THE

>> WE ARE STILL FINALIZING

69
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:10,961
EXACTLY WHAT THAT WILL LOOK

70
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:12,631
LIKE, AND RETURNING SOMETIME ON

00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,165
THURSDAY.

72
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:14,466
I THINK IT’S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

73
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,601
LOOKING AT WHERE WE WERE SIX

74
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:20,605
MONTHS AGO, AND NOW WE HAVE

75
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:26,144
OTHER THINGS TAKING PLACE.

79
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,987
THURSDAY.

80
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,922
THE THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA’S

81
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:37,656
INTERMEDIATE IMMEDIATE BALLISTIC

82
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,559
MISSILES AND JAPANESE CITIZENS

83
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,594
KIDNAPPED BY NORTH KOREA.

84
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,229
AT THEIR MAR-A-LAGO SUMMIT IN

85
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,631
APRIL, PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED

86
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,967
HE WOULD RAISE IT.

87
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,501
>> President Trump: WE WILL DO

88
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,302
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEM

89
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,637
BROUGHT BACK AND BRING THEM BACK

90
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,805
FROM JAPAN.

91
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:57,743
I GIVE YOU THAT PROMISE.

92
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,545
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SOUGHT

93
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,347
THE PRESIDENT’S HELP, BUT THE

94
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,948
WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED IT WILL

95
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:05,551
SOON IMPOSE A 25% TARIFF ON

96
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:11,524
50 BILLION IN CHINESE AND PLUM,

97
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,159
IMPORTS CHINA RESPONDED TERSELY

98
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,363
TO WHAT IT SAW AS A NEGOTIATING

99
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,765
A TACTIC.

100
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,966
IN A STATEMENT THE MINISTRY OF

101
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,168
CONGRESS IS SAYING WE ARE

102
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,870
SURPRISED BY THE STRATEGIC

103
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,637
STATEMENT BEING RELEASED AT THE

104
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,639
WHITE HOUSE BUT AT THE SAME TIME

105
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,541
IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPECTED.

106
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,410
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT SOME LOW

107
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,511
BACK AFTER A TWEET HE SENT OUT

108
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,647
ON MEMORIAL DAY WHERE HE POSTED,

109
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,148
ABBY MEMORIAL DAY.

110
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,783
THOSE WHO DIED FOR OUR GREAT

111
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,550
COUNTRY WOULD BE VERY HAPPY AND

112
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,052
PROUD AT HOW WELL OUR COUNTRY IS

113
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,556
DOING TODAY.

114
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,958
IT’S THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT

115
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,560
NUMBERS FOR BLACKS AND HISPANIC

116
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,962
EVER AND WOMEN IN 18 YEARS.

117
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,530
THAT PROMPTED A SOBER RESPONSE

118
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,266
FROM THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE

119
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,601
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

120
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,102
GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY TWEETED,

121
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,404
THIS DAY OF ALL DAYS OF THE YEAR

122
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,573
SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT ANY ONE OF

123
00:03:59,573 --> 00:03:59,973
US.

124
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,775
NO MATTER HOW STRATEGIC OR

125
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,344
POWERFUL, NO MATTER HOW SIX

126
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,245
SUCCESSFUL WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES

127
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,948
TO BE.

128
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:12,686
THE PRESIDENT’S TONE WAS MUCH

129
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,954
DIFFERENT.

130
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,823
THE FIRST DAUGHTER, IVANKA     P

131
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,024
SEEM TO GET IT JUST

132
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,160
PITCH-PERFECT WHEN SHE TWEETED

133
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,963
OUT, AS WE REMEMBER OUR FALLING

134
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,531
MEN, ACADEMIC FALLING MEN AND

135
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,668
WOMEN, WE REMEMBER OUR GRATITUD

136
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,936
GRATITUDE.

137
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,005
>> ANOTHER ASPECT OF

138
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,774
IVANKA TRUMP RAISING SOME

139
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,610
EYEBROWS.

140
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,278
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THE

141
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:44,352
PRESIDENT CUT A DEAL AND ABIGAIL

142
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,388
CLEM WHO RUNS THE IVANKA TRUMP

143
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,155
BRANDON SAID THAT IT WAS

144
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,959
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

145
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,962
AND THERE ARE SO MANY TRADEMARK

146
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,397
VIOLATIONS, THE WHITE HOUSE IS

147
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,732
POINTING OUT THAT WHILE THE

148
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,435
PRESIDENT DID CUT A DEAL, HE

149
00:05:00,435 --> 00:00:00,000
ALSO THIS MORNING SAID HE WAS
