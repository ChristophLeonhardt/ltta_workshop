in the text of today's briefing and I would like to once again say that the website of the foreign ministry we will return to it later I'd like to say that the website has a section called events in foreign nations and on the request of our embassies we presented in more vegetable fashion we have made a special option a special window on the front page and on a regular basis this section includes information and photographs on the life of foreign missions on their events and on what is going on in our foreign missions and the large part of these materials is published on a daily basis and even more materials will be devoted to the diplomatic day that is why you can find the information there once again we will as usually make a special section on the website on the occasion of our holiday and the section itself events in foreign missions will also be more noticeable now let us move on to the main international problems I would like to begin by speaking about the situation in Syria in general it is characterized by a positive trends and the turn toward peace is especially noticeable in Damascus where the situation for a long time has been controlled by the government in Aleppo and Homs life is getting normal again and people are starting to restore the city's restore normal life without serious violations of ceasefire regime especially in the desolations owns the knot in the south of the country and to the north of Homs and in large part of East guta with the exception of heresy and robbery which are used by the terrorists for their armed attacks the flash points remain in the town of the friend where the armed forces of turkey supported by the Miller militants and the armed opposition hold an operation known as Olive Branch I will talk about it later as well as Italy and this province which did not see the final separation between the terrorists and the so-called opposition continues to host the al-nusra front and this region continues to face provocations which are meant to create and aggravate the situation in the desolation zones following the decisive actions of the Syrian forces supported by the Russian Air Force al-nusra fled from the abode whore airbase captured in 2015 which is now under the control of the government forces an important event which will have a serious effect on the development of the situation in Syria took place this week in Sochi where at the initiative of the Russian Federation which was supported by the United Nations and our partners in the Aston informant Turkey and Iran as well as influential Arab countries and neighbors of Syria hosted the Congress of Syrian national dialogue this forum was attended by 1,500 Syrian delegates and we took the exact final figures before the briefing so with this 1511 people they were representing a wide spectrum of political ethical and confessional layers of the Syrian society of course we regret the position of the Syrian opposition representatives who for different reasons including the first of all influence of external forces decided at the last moment to refrain from taking part in the Congress we were trying to convince them to change their mind and even as you might know we delayed the opening of the forum to do so but to no avail and we are convinced that this was a political mistake but at the same time this refusal did not aggravate the atmosphere at the forum the Congress as you know was attended by the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who gave a introductory worth of the President of the Russian Federation to the participants and international observers and allow me to give some of the figures there were questions and we are ready to answer them and Sochi we had accreditations for 53 foreign servers and they obtained their accreditation and were there they include the delegation of the United Nations who led by the special representative of the secretary-general of the UN mr. de Mistura they also included representatives of the embassies of Great Britain France and the United States and Moscow this was also mentioned yesterday by Sergey Lavrov Anka was answering the questions of the journalists and as far as the representatives of the media are concerned the Congress which concluded yesterday late in the evening it was covered by 500 Russian and foreign journalists and besides for those who did not attend the work on the spot we had live broadcasts of the opening and closing plenary sessions all the working part took part without cameras without broadcasts because we needed a good atmosphere and an important result of the inter-syrian discussion which sometimes was more than acute was the adoption of the final declaration and the address as you know the text including their translations into Russian and English are published on the website of the foreign ministry on our social media accounts a decision was taking to create a constitutional commission with a white representation of the government of Syria the opposition's civil society international tribal leaders as well as women the secretary-general of the UN received a call to appoint the special representative on Syria to promote the work of the organization in Geneva we have put a star too wide into Syrian dialogue to restore peace in Syria and prevent the consequences of the long-lasting conflict the decisions taken in Sochi we hope and we will be doing everything we can to do so will become the heritage of the Syrian negotiation process under the auspices of the UN in Geneva and other forums to promote the settlement of the conflict in Syria including all the Syrian participants first of all in Astana the voice of the participants of the Sochi forum which called for the restoration of peace in Syria and the reconstruction of the country in such a way which would safeguard and ensure the comfortable coexistence of all the parts of the Syrian people its unity and sovereignty and territorial integrity security and citizens rights this call should be heard of course at the same time I would like to congratulate those whose forecasts did not come true I answered a great number of questions many journalists was saying that the forum would be a failure that it would not take place so this is what I have to say the forum did take place and we did everything we could the Russian Federation did everything in order for it to be a success in order for the forum to become an important point to launch the Syrian dialogue I would also like to remind you that apart from those who express their doubt about the success of the Congress before the start there was a large number of negative events some of them were even saying that even if the forum took place it will lead to nothing that this parties will not agree and so on and right after the forum ended instead of admitting that this negative forecast did not come true there was a storm of fake news everything was there I cannot but quote one of them I have not seen it anything like it yet I do not even give you the name of the publisher but if you have the questions I will not give you the name not to give any unnecessary advertisements so this edition decided to count how much time was devoted to the Congress and how much was left to food and recreation and this material has received a large interest on the Internet because it was said that there were just six hours to define the destiny of Syria while 32 hours were meant for food recreation and movements as you know those who were in Sochi those who followed the events online you know that the situation was different for two days from early in the morning to the late evening the representatives of different groups of the Syrian opposition and the government devoted all of this time to their work this is not what I was going to say I just want to ask those who write this nonsense would you like to remind yourselves and your audience for example how long the Syrian war lasted we can help you it lasted at least 60 1320 hours at least this is how long the blood-shedding war in Syria lasted it would be interesting to count how many hours of phone and direct contacts was penned on international talks to settle the Syrian crisis we're in Moscow in Geneva in Astana in Cairo in many other world capitals in the UN how many hours were spent by the heads of diplomacy of the leading powers of world powers of different countries of all continents how many hours were spent to discuss the problems of Syria we talked about the time frame so if we speak about these curious maths we should also proceed from these figures first of all now drawing a certain conclusion I would like to say that and I would like to remind you once again of what the Syrians themselves were talking about what was said by the Russian representatives yesterday in Sochi the decisions taken in Sochi we hope will become the heritage of the Syrian talk process under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva and other forums which include the participants of Syrian parties first of all on the Astana forum and we hope that this will become an important basis for moving forward and it is important that this movement should go at a higher speed now now I'd like to dwell upon the operation now conducting about turkey as they call it in Ankara or the olive branch in Syria we see a lot for publications on the in this matter and we closely monitor the situation on the north of Syria which caused a serious concern the Turkish authorities announced that the energy operator operations started on the 23rd of January against the Kurdish a detachment of the Democratic Union Party is conducted in accordance with the right of the in charter regarding a de sel defense and the elimination of terrorist groups according to the latest information about 100 people including the civilians were among the victims and Moscow has also paid attention to the statements of Kurdish politicians in Norwich Russia as they say along with the Syrian regime is blamed for penance to the Turkish aggressions and is accused about the treachery regarding the Kurds I would like to mention of that in the north of Syria are these conditions were not secreted out by Russia that it is not Russia which is to blame all for preventing the restoration of the control of the legitimate government of Syria in its territory it was not Russia which formed power structures with the functions under the competence of the Syrian government and which ignited separated spirits and neglect of the international law and the lopsided interpretation of these international rights are fraught with the turbulence and new threats in Syria and in the Middle East in this our context we are confirmed the position of Russia to support the unity the sovereignty and territorial integrity and also to for the Syrians the right of Syrians are to determine the effete in order to support these goals we've initiated the probe Congress of Syrian national dialogue and Sochi and as for the Kurdish parties at parties and the opposition we have done everything to attract the attention and we are convinced in the necessity of settlement and normalizing the situation in Syria in accordance with the resolution two to five four of the Security Council and that should be done in Geneva and Astana and in other fora which should take into account the interest of Syrians Syrians wish their country to return to normal life comfortable for our dear citizens without any foreign interference or dominance now we turn to the situation and in other regions now I'd like to command to the situation in Venezuela now this country is preparing for the presidential election that should be held until April this year and we hope that the progress the process of organizing this voting will be live in line with the international recognized principles and norms in a peaceful and calm situations as we have seen in the case of a gubernatorial and municipal elections last year we are convinced that for all political forces of this country it is a nursery to comply with the Constitution of the current legislation we think premature to give an assessment of the voting the statements of many opposition leaders on this respect are reflect the desire to spread cares and this discord and to prevent the reading the struggle between different political forces we consider unacceptable the intentions to interfere into the internal affairs of Venezuela and unilateral restrictive measures are also very destructive we also known to their progressive sanctions pressure which is far from given a way to normalize in the social situation and improving the communitarian situation in Venezuela we regret that the anti Venezuelan campaign inspired from the north from Latin America is still going on and under these consequences it is very important to develop a the constructive dialogue between now there is well and sides and to develop compromises and reach agreements in the interest of the broad population that would help to promptly resolve for social and economic tasks in Venezuela in these contexts it is gratifying to see the parties come back to the talks which are very important for the future of Venezuela when we read the materials regarding this country these are materials coming under the pressure from the north and when we hear the calls for democratization and they explain is by these process of democratization we ask ourselves what are the real values and goals are for democracy and the second thought is whether these attempts to exert pressure on the situation in Venezuela as a discredit of these values of democracy another topic we have seen with a great anxiety are the attacks on out the law enforcement agencies in Colombia and Ecuador and we expressed condolences to the families of those who were killed and we expressed the wish for the speedy recovery of the victims Russia strongly condemns any expression any manifestation of terrorism which is a serious threat to the security in Latin America and we also encourage to deny such methods and no matter what the models are we assure that the organizer said most minds of our these crimes will be severe severely punished now we turn to our Great Britain's could not have mentioned or the statement of the defense secretary of this country who spoke of the willingness of Russia to attack the British infrastructure facilities and to kill thousands of our civilians and this is a moment when the defense secretary of the UK made a statement it seems that he was imagining himself as James Bond bond and we know that UK is undergoing in a very difficult stage of exiting the European Union and it faces anterior divide in the British society it is quite comprehensible that to destruct the social attention are they need an exterior enemy and they didn't manage to explain this by the interference of the Kremlin and they decided to do it in in a different way but such treatment were seen as puzzling in the same Great Britain and they can be called as mere deal and the latent ISM and even the leadership of the special services recommended the defense secretary stop these speculations and scaremongering these absurd stage statements just complicate our bilateral relations their prospects of rectifying them which was mentioned to by our heads of our ministries Foreign Ministries during their talks in December now we will talk about Russia the so-called Russian interference in the u.s. again if it is but we will talk about Netherlands we you know that special materials on the journalists investigation and was published according to which the employers of the members of the general intelligence service of our Netherlands stated that in 2014 the massive hack a computer network of some Moscow firm which was connected to Russian hackers and they set up surveillance for this firm this is mentioned with a connection with interference with the election of voice of Hillary Clinton and with the interference all the kind of interferences and the French TV channel to Diamond said that these Intelligence Service agents a transfer theater which helped to minimize the damage of the Russia interference in other presidential elections in the years so it means that they've tried to conceal this information and we suffered from that but they were just waiting for someone to win in the elections frankly speaking why we were not child for myriad two and a half years about that we had direct contacts with Netherlands and the topic of security is regularly discussed with our partners so it seems that they have waited for something they have waited for the S presidential elections if Clinton won then this information wouldn't have been disclosed even if we suppose that this information is true but if Clinton didn't win so the situation would have been quite the opposite so this is outrageous as usual we do not have any facts any evidence you know these journalists investigation but journalists explain us that they were ordered not to disclose this is an information of state secret we regard that this is ridiculous and we have a question why and it seems that we have an answer in March this country will hold municipal elections we're together with the Consultative referendum regarding the widening of the powers of the special services and the Dutch public is actions about these plans which can be a source of more abuse from the part of the state and the logics tells us that it is an attempt to intimidate these citizens by the image of the insidious please God for Kremlin but the fact is that we saw similar stories regarding the agreement of the Association of between Ukraine and the European Union when the government of Netherlands didn't take into account the position of its own citizens so this is everything that we can see without with our own eyes as for Europe we've taken out of all the statement of a mr. Morales key who spoke about polish official who spoke about non stream to and during his talks with mr. Tillerson he spoke about the intention are just suspend this project so this negative attitude of Poland towards our this non stream is well-known and we've made comments on that regard under the comments given by the Warsaw officials does not stand out analytic critic criticism I found one of the quotes saying that the United States the United States should be a great supplier of natural gas to Europe and Poland should be a transport harper organized in these it has sweets but it is well known that the prices on liquefied gas is a higher than the pipeline gas coming from russia so if it is well known the prices are known that are higher so where can we see these energy security which is a much talked about in the very same poland we should remind the polish side that the not stream does not damage the security that energy security in Europe but minimizer that transport risks and ensures the gas supply to the and consumers this project is not aimed at preventing now the arrivals from transporting the gas to this country to those countries and after the Russian now site has many times cited stated its will Anessa to keep transit in certain pellets of gas to Europe even after the Commission and alpha are not stream actually and this we think that it is a normal situation as for the spreading of the American jurisdiction in this project our European partners has its have expressed their concern over the attempts of the yes to resort to this and fear competent competition and we condemn these attempts to torpedo or the constructive initiatives of Russia and in the area of energy resources as you know there were shipments of Russian liquefied gas to the s and we had such kind of information now we speak about the advanced held all over the world and they were devoted to the day of the victims of Holocaust on their 20th 27th of our January you know that these events were attended by foreign minister Lavrov and he was present at the opening of for the exhibition and he had contacts with the prisoners of the concentration camps and in Moscow there were some events with their participation of Russian officials now I'd like to say that number of major events were held in Brussels attended by of the represented alpha EU institutions including the ceremony in European Parliament on the 24th of January it's regrettable that the statements of the EU officials unlike the representatives of Jewish communities and organizations these people this representative does not mention of the contribution of the so a diamond to the liberation of the Auschwitz this day was chosen not accidentally this is a day of the liberation of for the Auschwitz was which was due to the contribution of the Soviet Army in spite of the historic truth we didn't hear any word about this I'd like to remind you that such kind of silence is silencing the real rule for the Red Army and the Red Army soldiers the rule of the Soviet Union in liberating the Auschwitz and Europe is deeply regrettable to us like to attract your attention to other news there's another issue related to the events of the Second World War the Minister of Foreign Affairs the Ministry of European affairs of Croatia and Belgrade devoted an event of the opening of the exhibition at the UN about the crimes committed on the territory of Croatia during 1941-45 we support the efforts of Serbia that were aimed at preservation of the memory and the grievance of the Second World War and this is the day when we all remember the victims of Holocaust and I had mentioned already this fact in the concentration camp that I have mentioned they were tortures took place of many people of various people various ages and nationalities the Serbs in Romani people the Jews and we moon all people who were killed in this camp and we all remember always the hard way towards the victory and we will account to the attempts to revise the history to rewrite the history especially in the context of the events that took place in various cities and many countries of Europe violations of the monuments devoted to those who made a great contribution to liberate Europe from fascism I would like to remind that the text of the resolution of the General Assembly of the UN describes and establishes the day the Remembrance Day the resolution of 21st November 2005 and it says the following the General Assembly is grateful to those states that were actively contributing to preservation are the concentration camp and prisoners that were used during Holocaust I can't bite see that in the same context and the same vein their beard just on there is a tweet and as far as I know it is still there in the internet you can find it and it was a message published in Twitter by the director of the international problems demske mr. tomski if I'm right in pronouncing his name that it was no Netherlands and not Poland the country that blocked Russia's participation in the managing committee of sub or memorial establishment as we know that weeds are difficult to eliminate from the internet and we can check the correctness of this information and check if this person has something to do with the health situation I would like to remind you that from people from other countries of the members of the managing management committee gave us different information for us it is very important to fully participate in this project without replacing the responsibility of the shoulders of other states and this is what we see our polish colleagues do now I would like to go to other issues that are also related to the European continent I would like to mention the Russian seasons in Italy in January 14 in Rome and the National Academy of Sciences took place in Opening Ceremony Russian seasons and a symphonic orchestra Orchestra concert of mariinsky theatre directed by gear give took place there and representatives of the chairman of the government of the Russian Federation go laureates was present there and many representatives of political public and businesses circles and the event was widely covered by the media both countries on January 15 in Russian center of science and culture in

seasons has to show the achievements of our culture and arts and to give impetus to bilateral cooperation and cultural and humanitarian area this is an event that took place two weeks ago but I would like to remind this to you this event and it was the project that includes around 200 events that will take place in 40 cities in Italy among those cities Rome Milan Florence Venice the Apple and other cities and they will show the performances of the most popular CH and dancing troupes the exhibition's of the national museums first of all self movies and concerts during interviews and some public events the Italian side evaluated how with the contribution of the Russian side in maintaining bilateral relations in this area next today we have these screams there is not an accident and as I said that will be back to the internet portal of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and now we do this we launch the webpage in Arabic we'll have another language version of our portal it will be limited of course it will be not the complete version of our Russian site especially for the Arabic users and for those who speak this language will select the messages and the materials of greater interest for them and the first news it's one of the first materials that we have selected is about Syrian national dialogue that took place in Sochi and the relevant materials are attached and then work on popularization and the availability of the information published on the official web page of the Minister of Foreign Affairs would like to draw attention to the fact that aerobic version of the web page of mfa that was launched today will be working in a test format and the users have to provide their comments and proposals and - and we will respond in urgent manner and for the Arabic users we have the accounts in Twitter there is microblog at russia AR and in facebook the links they are available they will be additionally published in the text of today's telegram and we will publish there also the materials from our web page in Arabic before I start answering your questions I would like to answer the questions that we received right before the briefing or during our previous briefing so we were asked to comment on the priorities of Russia of our presidency in EA EU the integration processes in the Eurasian sphere is actively developing the Eurasian Economic Union for three years of work achieved great results it was one of the crucial elements for economic development for Member States Russia Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan and through Asia there is single market for goods the common rules for market of services capital and labor markets from January 1 the new custom code came into effect in 2018 member states marked the rise of turnover in general the Gross's 1.8 percent between member says there is increase in goods turn over for the first three quarters of 2017 the mutual trade increased 26 comma nine percent and the supplies to local markets by twenty four point seven percent in 2018 Russia Hamas is functioning as the president of the Union and it will be based on the priorities announced by the president in his address to heads of the Union on January 17 and we are open to all proposals from our partners in the union would have an integration agenda which is ambitious and was sick not only to further configurator union but to develop the agenda was new and most relevant initiatives and projects and the priority will be given to the creation of common digital space of the Union and there is good opportunity to strengthen relations between five countries in nuclear energy renewables ecology medicine space tourism in sport these issues were not included in the agenda at the first stage but it is hard to imagine sustainable development without a cooperation in these areas the key role in the development of the union plays close cooperation with the foreign partners in from 2016 there is a free trade zone with Vietnam functioning successfully we hopeful positive outcome of the negotiations on establishment of free trade zone with Singapore Iran India Israel Egypt and Serbia there are wide prospects in signature of trade and economic cooperation between trade and economic operation is agreement between the Union and China there is opportunity of some serious countries to be observers at the Union and with determined to strengthen the positions of the Member States at the WTO and to involve this organization into the work of other international organizations the engineer in the near future will be developed a plan for implementation of Russia's priorities as the president and we will report on the implementation of our of this plan and other questions that we received during the previous briefing from Armenia we were asked to comment on the Russia's role in possible strengthening of monitoring mission of the OEC role in the governor Karabakh and the settlements in this region I do not see anyone from who asked the question Russia with other members of all we see means group States takes efforts and at strength strengthening the mandate expanding the monitoring mission in the area - this event was devoted greater part of the meeting when the President of Russia and the President of Azerbaijan in Armenia in June 2016 and they also disc this issue was discussed during the meeting the meeting of Sergey Lavrov in Baku and Yerevan and there was a document that regulates activity of additional observers in crak of the place in a meeting of Sergey Lavrov with the three countries members of the conflict and the ministers gave their principal agreement to follow the steps prescribed in the document prepared by the mediators that they have to agree on some technical issues before they launched the mechanism of expansion as for the questions that was about peaceful settlement I would like to stress again that only the police themselves had to show their willingness to put the end of this protracted conflict in October last year in Geneva took place immanuel by Johnny summit and after that there were two meetings of the ministers they made the statements and the first 10 days of February the co-chairs plan a visit to specify the country's positions on this issue and on the problematic issues of the settlement two more questions that we received unfortunately there is no representative from Bulgaria but I know that he was in Sochi the question about the development of Russia Bulgaria development on the before the anniversary 140 years of liberation of Bulgaria from the Osman Empire it is a good moment to discuss the relations between Russia and Bulgaria there is good positive movements in trade and economic sphere the mutual Turner will was increased by one third and it is all happened in the backdrop of the sanctions from the European Union at the same time the two countries understand that there is not the limit we have to develop our relations in various spheres and considering the celebration of 140 years of liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman Empire there were various events in some cities the June and in June and December and August were other events that we plan to celebrate and in March the patriarch of Moscow and all Russia cereal will visit the country and the visit is still in is being prepared and will give additional details later Sofia is the president of the Council of the European Union and it could help to develop our relationship relations as for energy truck there are no serious changes the parties are seeking the approaches to launch much energy projects the branches of gas pipeline in Bulgaria and seek to start again the construction of the nuclear power station billion the spectrum of cooperation must be expanded it would be helpful for both countries I can reassure you that any aspiration to develop relationships with our Bulgarian colleagues will be positively welcomed by a Russian side as it is well known that any type of relations have those features that are characterized by some positive moments especially if they are moving in the positive direction and another question which seems kind of absurd how could you comment on the launch by the Latvian Centre for state language of the mobile app language friend which allows to report Russian speakers of these Baltic Republic for using their mother tongue when I first saw it I could not believe my eyes I checked it once again and I saw that yes really only 24th of generally Latvian Center for state language launched a mobile app using which any an indifferent citizen of the country can send a report on the violation of language norms by a certain person it is worth noting that the functions of this app also include feedback and the so called good citizens will be informed by the center about the results of the consideration of their report and this creative approach which resembles something Orwellian becomes a new example of repressive to set to drive Russian language out of all areas of public life and this action is of course discriminatory and anti-russian I do not have any other examples other than a comparison with the times of the Inquisition and the things that are happening right now things that they create in the form of such an app this is an example of language Inquisition of course we hope that respected international organizations will give their evaluation of this provocation and speaking frankly another question arises for many years Latvia in particular as well as other states of Eastern Europe have been declaring their wish to say goodbye to the past to their past and we talked about the Baltic States it means their Soviet past the Soviet heritage they call this the heritage of the totalitarian regime what can be more resembling the tool set of a totalitarian regime other than such mobile phone apps to report their own compatriots who use the language that they can see their mother-tongue and now I am ready to answer your questions yes please I know son of a Moscow Baku Information Agency Russia regularly accuses the west of its involvement in various points over the world in their involvement in the elections but in fact everything seems absolutely different during the previous briefing you noted that Russia has information on the plans of destructive involvement of certain countries into the Russian internal affairs in the context of the presidential campaign but Russia is not the only country that faces such pressure as you know is there by John this year will also have elections and Baku has already seen certain amounts of pressure how can we fight against this is it not pressure from Moscow of course not well how can I comment on this I think I can just tell you to publish all of this to cover all these events and facts because these are serious things and you should also provide this information about the enrollment into internal affairs to the specialized international structures which have meant to not only take note but also to react to such facts of foreign involvement the formula is simple yes please news dot are you Portal Anton Murdoch I'm sorry once again news dot are you Anton Lord Asif I have two questions for you the first one on Sochi are there any expectations to capitalize on the results of the Sochi Congress in the Geneva process can you explain how the foreign ministry sees the constitutional community's participate in the Geneva format keeping in mind that other formats there's the government delegation and how does the Constitution committee comply with the existing mechanism keeping in mind that the precedium of the Congress included the representatives of the Moscow platform what is the contradiction what is unrealistic here can they work in a parallel fashion who in who existing mechanism and the Constitutional Commission Committee and another question the foreign ministry that's the foreign ministry comment on the Kremlin list yesterday the foreign means though the Russian Federation made a comment and the text is published on the website around 10:00 p.m. you may have seen the comments by the President of the Russian Federation by the head of the Russian government and by the representative of the president all the comments were already given the question is as was said by the administration of the Russian President these apparently unfriendly steps that are being taken by a certain part of the American establishment require serious and deep analysis because of course this all looks absurd and strange and so on but we need to analyze to see what is behind these actions and how can they actually affect the situation the bilateral relations and what is their final goal because apart from the part that was published and the US representatives said that there is another part which was not published it all requires serious and deep analysis but the initial comments were made yesterday through several channels including the foreign minister of the Russian Federation as full your first question the evaluations they were given yesterday by the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as for the work of the constitutional reform structure in Geneva I can say that of course this will be a matter for the Syrian representatives for the government and the opposition themselves to solve of course they will work in close coordination with the representatives of the United Nations who moderate the Geneva platform I can get more details to answer these questions on the mechanisms of cooperation and I think that today we might send you the answer to your question yes please Afghan she knew the Information Agency the day before yesterday Donald Trump during his meeting at the UN Security Council declared that the United States no longer intend to hold talks with Taliban on the other hand the Russian Foreign Ministry recently declared that it is necessary to build dialogue with Taliban how can you comment on this yes you know we received numerous questions including questions on these statements of our American colleagues we have a whole number of questions resembling yours people were asking if Russia was ready to act as an intermediary in any peace negotiations between the representatives of the Taliban and the United States government and whether Russia suggested to the Taliban to work as an intermediary or if Russia was working on the possible meeting of the Taliban with the United States and if Russia was supporting the talks between Taliban and the u.s. this wave that was started by the US and all that is happening right now in the that you have just mentioned caused a large number of questions and I can give a complex answer to all of them first of all none of the parties involved addressed any addressed us asking for any assistance and there is no need for that because the Americans have can have direct contacts with the Taliban and as far as I know the Washington considers the idea or rather used to consider the idea of direct talks with the Taliban as unacceptable while the Taliban is ready for talks with the US with the understanding that the main topic of the discussion will be the withdrawal of the US and NATO forces from Afghanistan this is the answer to your question and we ready and we will continue to promote the development of the process of national reconciliation in Afghanistan and if necessary we are ready to provide in required context to Kabul and the Taliban for example we can provide them with a Moscow platform for contacts and we have sent numerous invitations to Washington to take part in the multilateral efforts within the Moscow format of consultations on Afghanistan in order to create the required conditions to launch direct interaction dialogue unfortunately we do not see any aspirations of our us colleagues to take part in this process and the strategy taken by the United States I use repeat they keep changing it constantly but the declared recent Washington position to build up the military presence in Afghanistan only demonstrates the fact that Washington still puts a bat on the military scenario even as though the developments in this country especially the recent ones proof and keep proving that this approach is absolutely futile we've already talked about this we've been to talking about this and several months ago when they announced the new national security strategy and the national strategy towards Afghanistan we see that they do not have a long term strategy towards this state keeping in mind that no matter how good the plan is it never does anything to help the settlement of the conflict because the u.s. approaches keep changing especially on Afghanistan and the talks with Taliban they've been changing for a rather limited period of time and such short-term policy may be characterized as short-sighted that is why it is not only regrettable this is not about regret this is about concerns because the events in Afghanistan our serious threat to regional peace and security yes please thank you Nathan Hart CNN will there be any comments on yesterday's speech of President Trump in which he declared both Russia and China as rivals of the u.s. we comment on this regularly such declarations and statements are often heard from different representatives of Washington in certain form this was declared in a number of concepts and strategies concerning the matters of national security of the United States which were recently adopted and speaking in general unfortunately in the recent years there has been nothing new here to a certain extent as we say they are resyncing the old approaches and songs is this a deep analysis I do not think so we proceed from the principled approach towards cooperation with the United States of America and we did not hear about any other approaches from Beijing at the same time we see a policy towards Russia that Washington has been carrying out for several years this policy can be characterized as non-compliant with the goals of constructive cooperation and interaction and so on there are no examples unless we make them up for example such as the influence or the involvement of Kremlin in certain elections the examples of unconstructive and unacceptable behavior or attitude of Moscow towards Washington are not there you cannot cite any of them so let us leave this made-up story of our involvement in the elections out of the equation because there is no proof and there cannot be any proof because there is none all the rest from one declaration to another from statement to statement Moscow keeps emphasizing that our priority is cooperation with the United States of America in different areas of politics humanitarian links economy information security cyber security all of it starting from ecology to disarmament from finance to cooperation through the media and we are ready to such cooperation and moreover so up until recently all of this was actively developing we had presidential commissions and so on so where does these analytics come from where did the American experts get this information when they say that Russia along with China are as you said rivals or opponents and so on I would like to say this once again I hope that this part will not be out from the CNN coverage but we have seen a similar approach from President Obama the same song it was made up by him and it was not grounded anything it did not have any basis so your question from your channel which apparently does not support President Trump is meant to point out a certain lack of progress in the normalization of bilateral relations on the president Trump but I would like to remind you that the administration that your channel used to support so actively did everything to ruin the bilateral relations it cannot get any worse worse than it got under Obama administration I will not give you the examples you know them all too well from the expulsion of diplomats to closing down the Commission's the Joint Commission's and all the subgroups of this important organ structure of our cooperation from the visa matters to the constant accusations of Russia and all deadly sins you know this all too well be that is why I think that the origin of all these problems is not in today's declarations not in yesterday's declarations but rather in the statements that were made by the Obama administration and so on Martha's emphasize once again that even with back then on the Obama administration now on the Trump statements of unconstructive attitude towards our country are still there and we always proceed from our vision of the prospects of cooperation these prospects do exist and our country and our peoples require that when I talk to the people on both sides of the ocean in both countries I see that all of them are tired of what is happening in the media they're tired of the visa problems and when in the 21st century in order just to apply for a visa they need to spend a month we have examples of great cooperation in the most complex issues in with Washington and I do wish to hope that the tonality set by Obama and his supporters in the bilateral relations in the public area and in reality someday will finally go to the past will be re-evaluated by Washington it is high time to change it just listen to what the people say listen to the US citizens to the Russian citizens they all are tired of this flow of absurdity on the Russian matter yes please gusano Baku News Agency a question on the border between Russia and Azerbaijan in February there will be a meeting and then the installment of border sign posts who will meet where and how yes yes I understand I will get more precise information and give you an answer yes please hello a bit more than a year ago the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation in the Republic of Belarus Alexander Surikov in fact publicly accused the Belarus citizens of radicalism and he expressed his doubts that the arrested journalists were patriots of their own country and now during the course hearing they they found out that the words of the Ambassador were not true and the worst he quoted were not published so keeping in mind these circumstances do you think that mr. ambassador should give this provement of his false statements comment in today's topic many times yet please X and there's a sense of Arabic calm melody Mariner could you tell us what are the further contacts with the US and what what context you mean on what context and diplomatic context but we maintain regular contacts with us and we have regular meetings in Moscow and Washington with a participation of our embassies we raise questions we receive answers and we exchange views this is the dialogue which is continuous and has never been interrupted do not listen to the statement made by American experts we still have a dialogue but we just wanted to be more intensified to be more constructive for us not to stumble under these aggressive statement statements made by the different branches of power in the u.s. we still have this dialogue and I would like to draw your attention to the foreign ministry website to our website of our embassy in Washington and you can get more detailed information on the Russian ambassador's contacts in the US and the contacts between the Foreign Ministry of Russia and our us colleagues one of the example is the interaction and context at the end and in the Security Council in particular we cannot say that we lay dialogue dialogue we have it but it's time to make it constructive we hear constant accusations from the United States and we have to answer these accusations we still have to resolve all the issues constant issues on the agenda of the UN Security Council and other fora on the website we published in-depth information about the telephone calls conversations between Lavrov and mr. Tillison and you can also see the website of the russian federation russian mission at the UN and the u.s. party side also publishes the relevant information and we still have dialogue RIA Novosti news agency on Tuesday of the official representative of wadiya's Department commanded the incident in the Black Sea when the Russian ship approached the US aircraft and it was announced that Russia violated our the norms and the regulations and Russia was called for stopping such an activities Russia has a commander on the incident saying that it was in line with the international regulations and I would like to hear your opinion please when our American colleagues are reminded of the agreements that we have they say that they do not remember but in some cases they refer to different regulations but and in this case I think we do not have to repeat this comment once again what about the calc and the Russian Urania cooperation can be used in a different context I like the nagorno-karabakh conflict it is not very comprehensible question Russia Turkey Iran and the nagorno-karabakh I think we should not confuse two topics a Syria and the nagorno-karabakh settlement think this are very different problems and the attempt to mix them up it's quite an adequate inadequate space on Russia Porter we congratulate you on the side of the revocation of a web portal of the ministry the cheer of of the Syrian delegation one said that the constitution of Syria should be discussed and agreed upon in Damascus it was Bashar Ja'afari how could we implement these proposals I think this is not the exact quote I understand that is a quite a misleading way of citing people when we understand that it had had crawled rather profound more profound sense in it such words the conflict in Syria did not allow us to discuss this issue in particular the Constitution within Syria nobody has opposed these possibility but the Syrian are conflicting parties have not found any ways to realize this owed option and that is why we've decided to organize such an event in Sochi in order to create conditions for launching this bruce's constructive successful way nobody has ever said that the work of the Constitution should not include Syrians this is a priority that Russia has played has paid major attention to and we have always stressed that this is a matter of Syrians as for the venue of the event this is the result of the confrontation but we have no doubt that Syrians should leave this way one of our colleagues that it should be in Damascus so second question five plus five Matt and discussed the problem of Libya how can you comment on this meeting mr.
