hillarie blames every single person in america except for you-know-who for her election loss plus we talked about President Trump and whether he's about to cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and I give you the full Berkeley update plus should ESPN fire Jamel Hill we'll talk about it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so tomorrow hurricane Ben makes landfall in Berkeley is apparently the headline that we're getting from the left-wing media and we will explain to you what exactly is gonna happen tomorrow at Berkeley and how you can get standby tickets they are sold out but there is talk about a bunch of protesters having taken tickets and then walking out until we have a standby line I'll explain to you how you can take advantage of that plus I will give you the entire rundown on Hillary Clinton and why the Democrats are now saying that Trump may actually be President Trump man should be Teflon I'll explain why that might be true and why it might not be true but before we do any of that first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at helix sleep so as I have said before I am terrible at sleep or at least I was terrible at sleep up until we got our helix sleep mattress there are a lot of online mattress retailers and they're popping up these days all with this one-size-fits-all solution but helix sleep has a proprietary algorithm they look at your weight how you how it's distributed across your body they run it through their algorithm they asks what sort of mattress you want to want it firm do you want it soft do you want them to be

mattress I've slept on and again use that / Benz that they know that we sent you and they and they understand that their advertising is working well okay so the the big story of the day is of course Hillary Clinton continuing to make the rounds before I get to that I want to explain how you get tickets to the Berkeley speech so it is sold out they sold out all of the tickets in 45 minutes they had actually closed the other thousand seats we would have sold that out to probably in the first 45 minutes as well except that they closed the upper tier at this auditorium Zellerbach Hall at Berkeley they closed it because they were afraid that an sefa members were going to infiltrate and actually rip I guess the the chairs off the floor I think they're bolted em they're gonna rip the chairs off the floor and then start flinging them down onto the unsuspecting crowd members below which is just insane the answer to that by the way is more security not banning a thousand people from the hall that's that's absurd but in any case Berkeley does seem to be doing what they should be doing for security Berkeley City Council today or last night passed a vote six to three that said that the Berkeley PD are allowed to use pepper spray on violent offenders how this is even a question is beyond me but I guess I am the cause of that so yay me it's about time they started using pepper spray on people who get violent their rioters they are not protesters once they start getting violent apparently there's been a 20 year ban in place on using pepper spray against violent protesters because Berkeley is one of the world's dumbest places so if you want to get standby tickets then you can go over to the the Berkeley College you can go over to the Berkeley campus tomorrow for those who reserved to ticket online you have to pick up your tickets at a time prior to 6:30 p.m. on Thursday September 14th any tickets that are unclaimed by 6:30 p.m. will be forfeited by those who reserved them and they're setting up a standby line right now there's a standby line forming a Memorial Stadium box office at the UC Berkeley campus beginning at 5:00 p.m. starting at 6:30 p.m. they'll start distributing unclaimed or forfeited tickets right now I think they're only about 15 tickets actually but if that changes then be first in line to receive all of those because I have a feeling there might be more than a few unclaimed tickets I think that they're gonna be a lot of people on the Left who reserved tickets just to make sure that there are seats that are empty so if you really want to get in then go over to go over to Memorial Stadium box office at the see Berkeley campus beginning at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow and I will see you there because it should be a lot of fun widely anticipated a lot of media coverage of this particular speech and I'm very much looking forward to seeing all of you so that is that is exciting stuff okay so Hillary Clinton is doing her own book junket she will not leave and this is the worst thing in the world for the Democrats because she was such a deeply unpopular candidate that she really lost the election more than Donald Trump on it and I say that you know knowing that that Trump may have been the only Republican candidate who could beat her that's not a rip on Trump this is just to point out how unpopular Hillary Clinton was she won fewer votes fewer votes in Michigan then Donald sorry Donald Trump won fewer votes in Michigan and won the state than George W Bush won in 2004 in Michigan and George W Bush lost the state of Michigan that doesn't demonstrate a vast Trump movement it demonstrates everyone dislikes Hillary Clinton same thing in Wisconsin Mitt Romney actually outperformed Donald Trump in Wisconsin in 2012 Mitt Romney lost the state Trump won the state why no one showed up to vote for this lady no one showed up to vote for her so she now comes along and she is gonna give her explanation for why she lost it naturally the explanation for why she lost is because everyone is mean to her it's just the end of the world everyone is cruel and mean and vicious her book came out yesterday and apparently it is a heaping pile of garbage there are amusing parts of it I will admit I've read some of the sections of it I haven't had a chance to pick it up as of yet it's been a bit of a busy week and I mean frankly if I can somehow put it off to the point where it becomes irrelevant to the news that be Gregg's I would not want to spend four hours reading her book but she is blaming everyone I think my favorite part of this of this book is there's a quote that came out from her book that is just astonishing where she just completely misses how it is that the Orwell novel 1984 what it was about so that she actually writes this in her book attempting to define reality is a core feature of authoritarianism this is what the Soviets did when they erased political dissidents from historical photos this is what happens in George Orwell's classic novel 1984 when a torturer holds up four fingers and delivers electric shocks until as a prisoner sees five fingers is order the goal is to make you question logic and reason and to sow mistrust or Trump as with so much he does it's about simple dominance so basically says the big problem in 1984 is that it's supposed to make you distrust that Trump's stick is to make you distrust the press and the authorities just like in 1984 which is not what 1984 is about that's about why you should not trust the press and the authorities the entire book is about not trusting the press and the authorities but Hillary Clinton is nearly as bad at literary analysis apparently as she is at things like running for office okay so here is Hillary doing her stack sheet she first of all rips the press she starts off with it's the presses fault it's all the presses fault they they were just mean to me if they hadn't been so cruel then I would have won this election but I don't think the press did their job in this election with very few exceptions so the hard questions about what was real and what was realistic and what could happen with the right kind of election outcome we're never really joined and so you know I found it frustrating obviously because I think I could have defended and lifted up a lot of what I believed we could do but really Ezra when you get 32 minutes in a whole year to cover all policy how does that work okay so tell me if she wanted to talk policy but the media were just too mean now what's hysterical about this is that essentially what Hillary Clinton is doing is she sang the entire 2016 election was wait for it fake news right she's suggesting that the media didn't do their jobs the media were all part of this evil conspiracy to stop her now I remember when there was a guy named Donald Trump and he said this all the time and continues to say it all the time and the media say how dare Trump how dare he insult us this way but Hillary Clinton says the same thing and they just sit there and take it well she's probably right you know maybe we didn't do our jobs this time maybe we should have been more sycophantic the big problem for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats is that the media were so sick of fancy during the primaries they refused to acknowledge what a bad candidate she was so by the time she was exposed to the light of day she's just withered in the light of day if the media had been honest about what a terrible candidate she was early on the chances that she would have not won the nomination would have been exceedingly exceedingly low I mean the media bias is always to the left the best example of this today there's an amazing tweet from Christian Lisa over at CNN sometimes I think Chris Chili's does some interesting stuff but he tweeted something today that's just incredible here's what he tweeted quote The Today Show did Ted Cruz porn video and Seattle mayor resignation in its first 10 minutes banner day for politicians and why do I bring this up because when he says the Today Show did the Ted Cruz porn video in Seattle mayor resignation you have to understand what those stories are to understand how biased the media is Hillary says the media are biased against her and Democrats okay that's insane the Ted Cruz porn video no Ted Cruz was not in a porn video no Ted Cruz was not caught watching a porn video one of his interns liked a porn video on his Twitter account that he doesn't even run okay that's the Ted Cruz porn video story that was worthy of Chris Chile's his tweet and what is this Seattle mayor resignation story that's Democrat Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle who's a garbage mayor he had to resign because there was a fifth allegation of child molestation against him child molestation okay mo allegedly molested five kids okay and here he is and Marie resigning but how is that characterized by Christian ISA as Seattle mayor resignation would you get from that that he was resigning because of alleged molestation is that what you would get from that if you just read those two phrases Ted Cruz porn video and Seattle mayor resignation which one of those do you think would actually include a sex scandal have you just read those two phrases the cruise one right but the cruise things and nothing the Seattle mayor just had to resign he was by the way an up and comer in democratic circles there was talk about him running for governor of the state of Washington ed Murray he's I think the first openly gay mayor of Seattle his $15 minimum wage guy in Seattle progressive hero molested allegedly five children five underage people and Chris chillyzack characterizes that a Seattle mayor resignation but no we're supposed to believe that Hillary really she was the one who's treated roughly by the media not Republicans not Trump it was really Hillary Clinton then Hillary said you know who else is to blame you know who else is to blame for all of this I'll tell you it was James Comey James Comey was so mean here's Hillary Clinton explaining I believe absent Comey I might have picked up one or two points among white women I'll give you the example I use in the book so before the Comey letter in October 28 I was 26 points ahead in the Philadelphia suburbs that could have only happened if I had a big vote from women Republican women independent women a week later 211 days later I win the Philadelphia suburbs by 13 points I needed to win by 18 points to be able to counterbalance the rest the state that wasn't just me that's how Democrats win Pennsylvania in presidential campaigns it stopped my momentum and it hurt me particularly among women and I have so much anecdotal evidence for this and now researchers are starting to pull some of this together you know all of a sudden the husband turns the way I told you she's gonna be in jail you don't want to waste your vote you know the boyfriend turns to the girlfriend and says she's gonna get locked up don't you hear she's gonna get locked up I mean all of a sudden it becomes a very fraught kind of conflictual experience what I love here also the statement from Hillary Clinton ear that it's all the evil men who are telling their women these stupid women if only the stupid women wouldn't listen to their men it's their men who are turning them and saying she's gonna be locked up and the women are going Oh darlin okay I guess I won't vote for her and more like that's how Hillary Clinton actually pictures her own female voters I can't imagine why this lady lost I cannot imagine why this deeply unlikable human being lost then she says it wasn't just Comey was also Russian meddling so first of all just to point something out about the the Comey thing yes James Comey botched this thing all the way through but if you recall the boxer he started with him not indicted her in the first place not recommending indictment in the first place by actively changing the standard of law back in July instead of just handing over his recommendation to Loretta Lynch he did the bidding of Barack Obama right he basically was writing her exoneration statement before he even interviewed her you don't get to complain about James Comey when it's James commis fault that you were even running competitively up until the end of the election cycle it wasn't just calling me though and it wasn't just the press it was also the Russians the Russkies the evil Rooskies you notice there's one person who's missing in all of these calculations her name runs as Miller Eve Linton yeah but Hiller here is Hillary Clinton explaining that it was the Russkies they they won't have to take her out election was how effective the Russians through WikiLeaks were in weaponizing information against me and how they were getting really good political advice about placement both Geographic and platform from somebody and we'll leave it at that yeah but we didn't really see that that was not clear to us at the time in the campaign and in retrospect you know we saw how if you analyze Google searches they were spiking in places that had been sort of swing had ended up voting for President Obama but were you know subject to being persuaded by the other side WikiLeaks searches were off the charts people were trying to understand and they were trying to make sense of some of the stuff they were hearing on their Facebook you know feeds or a friend lovely invocation here by the weapon that they were cleverly weaponizing WikiLeaks okay I was there well WikiLeaks did is they just released giant caches of documents the idea that they were strategic strategically releasing portions of them in various outlets just is not true that's not how WikiLeaks worked they would dump a bunch of documents than people like me and my staff would crowdsource them okay that was just stuff that happened during the election cycle but it was also the Russians and it wasn't the fault of the DNC for not actually protecting their servers it was the Russians it wasn't Hillary Clinton's fault in any way it was that Hillary Clinton was victimized by the Russians so now here are the people she was blamed the press James Comey the Russians and now we're about to find out that it was sexism and misogyny that's really what happened here as people don't like women right as people don't like women it wasn't even like Hillary Clinton and so they'll they don't like women in general like white women who by the way went for Donald Trump by a pretty wide margin it's that white women hate women that's really the problem here I was really quite taken aback at the attitude and the behavior of my general election opponent because he made no bones about it literally he was so sexist and not just about me but about his Republican woman opponent his women and reporters on TV and elsewhere so it was really a part of the atmosphere and I want not just but men as well to know this is endemic sexism and misogyny are still endemic we've made progress but we can't allow ourselves to go backward and as I point out in the book it never was just about me I happen to have the big bullseye on my head but it was about women and in the months since we've seen reports out of Silicon Valley and other businesses as well as politics we're distinguished women like Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris or Kirsten Gillibrand or you know others in the media are being treated to a level of overt sexist okay this is absurd people don't like Hillary Clinton something I don't like women that's ridiculous okay Kamala Harris is only being talked about for the presidency because she's a woman she's been in the Senate for five minutes and done nothing Elizabeth Warren being talked about for president is an absurdity I know Elizabeth Warren she's a professor at Harvard Law School and I was there okay the idea that Elizabeth Warren is being talked about as a presidential candidate is an absurdity kirsten gillibrand these are absurdities but the idea that these are being treated oh it's that sexism was unlocked in the last election cycle no what happened is that people got tired of people like Hillary Clinton labeling them sexist and they didn't care what Trump had to say anymore that's what happened here people had a choice right they could either take Trump with yes some of his sexism but at least he wasn't calling them sexist or they could take Hillary Clinton who's lecturing them every single day about how they hated women and that was an easy choice for most people but no it's that Americans are sexist Americans are brutal and sexist that's the real issue here I don't remember Hillary Clinton speaking out the same way about any of the various Republican women over over the course of her over the course I've heard of long illustrious career I remember her speaking out the same way when she was targeting Juanita Broderick when she was targeting Kathleen Willey when she was targeting Monica Lewinsky I remember her speaking out the same way in favor of women obviously so I love this revisionist history that it's all about Americans decided they hated women just like Donaghy C Coates has said Americans decided they hated black people Hillary says Americans decided that they hated women but it's not just that Hillary also blamed Bernie Sanders and we'll get to that in just a second again everyone has to be blamed and the reason this is important folks is because I don't think the Democratic Party has actually moved beyond this mentality I think they are stuck in a rut they're stuck in a place where they basically want to divorce from the American people over this election cycle I'll explain in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors

and that she beat Bernie Sanders in a landslide during the interview with NPR she said she totally rejects that Bernie Sanders was the guy who's supposed to win the nomination should I find this criticism from Sanders supporters to be so off-base he's not even a Democrat right so this is the big problems that he's not even a Democrat he said she said he and his followers attacks on him he kept getting more and more personal despite him asking me not to attack him personally and you know I really regret that but now he's got a chance to prove he's something other than a spoiler and that is to help other Democrats I don't know if he will or not but I'm hoping he will right so there she is attacking Bernie Sanders everyone has to be attacked she attacks voters too right finally she ends up attacking voters this I think is probably the best portion of her pathetic book it's pretty a spectacular here's what she has to say in her book she says since November more than two dozen women of all ages but mostly in their twenties had approached me in restaurants theaters and stores to apologize for not voting or not doing more to help my campaign I responded with four smiles and tight nods on one occasion an older woman dragged her adult daughter by the arm to come talk to me in order her to apologize for not voting which she did head bowed in contrition I wanted to stare right in her eyes and say you didn't vote how could you not vote you abdicated your responsibility as a citizen at the worst possible time and now you want me to make you feel better of course I didn't say any of that these people were looking for absolution that I just couldn't give we all have to live with the consequences of our decisions whoa whoa there's only one word for that okay and it's not it's a five letter word and it's and it's not something I wish to say I mean that's that's really nasty stuff right somebody comes up to you and they say I wish I had done more and your first reaction is you little pissant if you've done more to serve me me the mistress of all evil then I would be sitting in the White House right now it's your fault you you didn't work hard enough I work plenty hard sure I took a nap every day sure I clapped into a van sure I was terrible in debates sure I was mechanical and awful and nasty and called half of Americans deplorable z but it's you you didn't get out and vote you and I'm not gonna provide you absolution I am like the Pope and I will never provide you absolution I will never provide you absolution okay it's no wonder and then Hillary finally finishes up by saying listen I'm not going anywhere you think I'm gonna leave I'm not leaving and I'm telling you I'm not going and she won't leave right I mean she has nothing better to do with her time what's she gonna do wander around in the woods like Bigfoot so she's just gonna stick around sinking her claws into whatever Democrat starts to move toward the top pretending she's helping them but actually hurting them Hillary is electoral poison and much worse than Barack Obama was and Obama didn't help anyone get elected Hillary's even worse because at least people liked Obama or at least people pot Obama was cool people think Hillary Clinton is awful and the more people see of her the better so yeah I totally am in favor of Hillary Clinton sticking around I think it's great here she is explaining and that she's not going any where she she won't go she just won't like Jennifer Holliday in Dreamgirls here she is there are many people including some Democrats who would be happier if Hillary Clinton stayed in the woods didn't write this book didn't reopen the wounds of 2016 well they're gonna be disappointed because I think it's important for people with my experience and my insight into what went on in the campaign but more generally about our country to speak out Clinton says she is done running for office but she plans to keep speaking up oh please please do please do the thing is that Hillary Clinton as just a human being is an incredibly vindictive person and you can sense the vindictiveness of the Democrats in her issues a good avatar for their vindictiveness that what they really are about is castigation of the other if they really wanted to win they'd run somebody like Joe Biden right okay I'm just I don't make a habit of giving advice to Democrats if you wanted to win you'd run somebody who didn't spend their time ripping on Americans as a bunch of no nothing sexist bigoted racist homophobes who wouldn't get out and vote for you because I deserved it but unfortunately that's not something that Democrats are doing I think Sarah Huckabee Sanders actually got this exactly right yesterday she said it's kind of sad it's a little bit sad right here is Sarah Huckabee Sanders doing that I think it's pretty clear to all of America I think it's sad that after Hillary Clinton ran one of the most negative campaigns in history and lost and the last chapter of her public life is going to be now defined by propping up book sales with false and reckless attacks and I think that that's a sad way for her to continue it is pretty sad and thank God for the sadness of the Democrats because otherwise they might actually be competent to this now there's some conflicting information about what Democrats here are going to do so Politico has a big piece today I got him to edward isaac doe beer reporting the democrats are having trouble they think that that trump may in fact be Teflon that using trump as sort of the the rallying point for their crowd is not going to do it here's what he has to say he says data from a range of focus groups and internal polls in swing states paint a different picture for the Democratic Party heading into the 2018 midterms and one 20 presidential election it suggests Democrats are naive if they believe Trump's historically low approval numbers mean a landslide is coming so what's the big problem well there are a bunch first off Bernie Sanders's economic program is not convincing to people so today it came out that a bunch of Democrats I've written about this and talked about it yesterday a bunch of Democrats Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris Gillibrand Wilson jump on board all of the front Cory Booker all of the front running 2020 Democratic candidates are talking about embracing Bernie Sanders Medicare for all plan okay this is really stupid strategy for a general election it's really dumb people do not trust the idea of a government takeover of the health care system they didn't like Obama care and so the Democrats are actually doing something worse they're talking about a full government takeover of the government health care system throwing lots of people off their insurance because you have to pay for this somehow and you some have to force doctors to take Medicare insurance in the first place the only way to do that is by getting rid of the competitors in terms of reimbursement rates you're gonna have to force people off their insurance that's what Medicare for all would probably mean but Democrats are pushing that but they're also actively undercutting the their own point when they when they did Obamacare they said listen Obamacare is not gonna be about single-payer we're not moving towards single-payer guys I mean that's how dare you that's not President Obama said this well this this is you know first step toward making health care better but we're not looking at single-payer and now you've got every Democrat in the world saying single-payer is on the table the American people don't want any of that Democratic Democrats in the base do radical Democrats in the base want all that but nobody in middle America wants a nationalized health care system but Democrats are moving to the left on these economic programs in order to get that base revved up for the full-on election cycle big mistake big mistake I'll explain to you the other mistakes Democrats are making why they're taking their lead from a combination of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton which is a really terrible combination in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriots supply so right now you look at the headlines as a hurricane in Texas there was a hurricane in Florida there are tornadoes hitting the middle of the country there's a possibility that North Korea is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile tipped with nuclear weapons and all of that means that the very least you should have some food in your house in case things go bad it's not too much to ask for 99 bucks you get a hundred and two servings of breakfast lunches and dinners from my Patriot supply get their new survival food supply for just 99 bucks less than $1 per serving order now at 888 803 1413 888 803 1413 or online at preparer with Ben Calm it's 99 bucks plus free shipping prepare with Ben's calm my Patriot supply believes in old-fashioned values of good folk so go over and work with them at 8 8 8 8 o 3 14 13 8 8 8 8 o 3 14 13 prepare with Ben's calm again protecting your family for 99 bucks is a no-brainer you store the food you don't worry about it ever again people at the office say it tastes like home cooking so it's good stuff and there you see how the shelves basically empty anytime there's any sort of disaster don't be the person who's caught left holding the empty bag goto instead my Patriot supply prepare with Ben calm its prepare with Ben calm okay so as I say the Democrats are now lashing out at the American public and that's what we've seen for the last seven months they just keep the women's March is a lashing out at the American public the support for the black lives matter movement it's a lashing out at the American public we're seeing a consistent lashing out at the American public and it's really ugly and that's what's driving people into Trump's camp so what are their new strategies to fight from well they're trying to move way left on economics like Bernie Sanders but as the as political rights many of the ideas party leaders have latched on to in an attempt to appeal to their lost voters free college tuition raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks even Medicaid for all tests poorly among voters outside the base and the reason that they test poorly among voters outside the base one reason is because this is all basic class warfare stuff right the idea is there's someone screwing you and we're going to rectify that situation well vilification and nastiness is not going to help you it's funny in 2016 there was this general idea that Trump was the nasty guy and Hillary was the candidate of up left no you basically had two nasty people going at one another and and Hillary was actually more alienating to two Americans than then even Donald Trump was which is an amazing statement worse for Democrats Trump is actually being given credit for the continuing strong economy according to Politico and personal attacks on him have been so variegated meaning that they've been so diffused that they dilute the message entirely voters actually don't care that Trump fibs because they feel like Democrats think of them badly like who would you prefer to hang out with the guy who tells you fish stories but is nice to you or the person who rails against you for being a racist sexist pig and homophobe who needs his soul hey obviously there's a reason that the Trump is more popular than some of the Democratic program and all of the attempts to paint Trump is a closet and white supremacists have failed too because again the Democrats are just so extreme right I explained this to Don Lemon on CNN I'm amazed the Democrats haven't picked up on this after the Charlottesville incident when Donald Trump I thought did a terrible job of handling it instead of Democrats staying on that Trump immediately swiveled to defending Confederate statues and Democrats like the fools they are decided to follow him there that's a losing issue for them and they're so radical that they're actually justifying a lot of what Trump had to say about the statutes right from said once you get rid of the Confederate statues the next move is to get rid of the Jefferson statues today report from Charlottesville students at the University of Virginia have now draped in black tarp the Thomas Jefferson statue Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia he founded it okay now they're draping his statue with a black tarp and you wonder why people are resonating to Trump hey Trump also has the advantage on immigration and trade in these focus groups as well the biggest problem for Democrats is that is is not Trump it's them they come off as people who look down their noses at everyday Americans who see Trump voters as losers and as morons who see people who didn't even vote for Hillary Clinton has to be alienated right this is how they see Americans and Americans pick up on this there's nothing that people pick up on more quickly than a sneer if you sneer at people people pick up on it incredibly quickly and people didn't feel like Trump was sneering at them they may have felt like Trump was sneering at the media because he was they may have felt like Trump was sneering and Democrats because he was they may have felt like Trump was tearing and fellow Republicans because he was in fellow candidates but they didn't feel like he was sneering at them and they got the feeling that Hillary Clinton was sneering at them and Democrats are having a tough time getting out of that right so their alternative was okay well if we can't stop sneering at Americans at least we'll castigate Trump is evil but Trump is actually undercut that a little bit because now he's working with Democrats how do you castigate Trump is Hitler when you're making a deal with them when you're going to the White House there's a meeting today between Pelosi and Schumer and Trump now I'm not saying that's good politics for Trump I think that making deals with Pelosi and Schumer is what he was elected not to do but for Democrats it's very difficult for them to make the simultaneous case that Trump has to be stopped because he's so evil and then they go and work with present Trump so may not be the Trump is is Teflon so much as Trump is rubber and the Democrats are glue and whatever they throw at him bounces off him and sticks back to them now here's here's the truth I want to mitigate this statement a little bit do I think that the Republicans have the upper hand going into 2018 I think you'd be foolish to think that I look at the data and what I see is Democrats winning some victories and possibly taking the house right now the generic democrática the generic ballot has Democrats up anywhere from six to eight points in the congressional race there's a lot of talk in 2005 about George W Bush was Teflon too and then in 2006 he got blown out and in 2008 Barack Obama took office with a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate and nearly a supermajority in the Senate okay so it's a little bit early and it's worth noting that there are statistics that cut in favor of Democrats here so on the question of who fights for people like me trumping the Democrats were split at 50% each in February Democrats are now ahead by 17 points that's a big gap that they've opened up right there and we are seeing some Republicans retiring because they don't like working with Trump and because they're afraid they're gonna be primary and we are seeing special state elections in places like Oklahoma swing Democrat there's a +31 Democrat state seat Republican states in Oklahoma yesterday it swung for the Democrats okay that's that is not good news for Republicans all that said though the Democratic program right now is not geared towards success it's not geared toward success specifically because of the scorn if they don't get rid of the scorn that Hillary that the drips off of Hillary they're gonna have a problem they need a candidate with authenticity who actually does not sneer at the American people and feel like they are owed this position if they don't do that then they're gonna be in serious trouble now I want to talk about what's going on with the ongoing attempt by outside forces to manipulate President Trump

we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation never talks a lot about the Democratic failures how they're going to try Bernie Sanders economics which is not popular and does not hold up with the American people and how they've tried Barack Obama intersectionality and have a scorn that Hillary Clinton holds for American voters is infused throughout the Democratic Party because they just can't believe that Americans would have elected Donald Trump but on the other side of the aisle there's a lot of confusion with regard to President Trump what's he gonna do now so there's a big meeting today between Trump and Pelosi and Schumer he had a meeting last night with a bunch of people Republicans and Democrats about his tax reform bill and then he tweeted something out about tax reform go Congress go okay if the extent of Trump negotiating on tax reform is going to be him tweeting go Congress go it's gonna be very difficult for anything to get done we already tried this exact plan with health care it did not work Trump's gonna have to be more involved than that the problem is that Pelosi and Schumer offered him an easy way out because they come to him they say we'll pass stuff we'll put our name on it with you you'll get great plaudits in the new york times it'll be awesome so we have to be very wary the White House yesterday came out and said Trump has always been in favor of amnesty seriously the White House actually said that okay I was there this is not true this is it I know that there's an attempt right now to try to prop up Trump on the immigration issues it's just not real so yesterday Drudge Report put up a big headline about how Trump was finally gonna start paving the way to building the law building the wall yeah not really okay so here's what it said from K VOA the Department of Homeland Security has issued a waiver it's waived certain laws regulations and other legal requirements to ensure the expeditious construction of barriers in the vicinity of the international border near collec so California the waiver was published in the Federal Register today so is that really a waiver that we're gonna get started building on the wall well not really because from 2005 to 2008 the department actually used that waiver authority five times okay wasn't wall built though a wall was not built that does not mean that we are gonna be building new wall it means that they are replacing current wall they're replacing border fence that currently exists so no that is not the building of the new wall don't be fooled by the headlines well there's also an attempt that's quite fascinating a lot of Republicans on various sides of the aisle have decided that it's imperative to flatter Trump into backing their positions so the fascinating thing to watch right now is that Steve Bannon who sees himself over at Breitbart is sort of the avatar of trumpism right the great philosopher king of trumpism he's been pushing Trump on some things that I agree with actually and some things I don't agree with but the people who are who are not on Team Bannon a lot of those people who want Trump to do different things they're now using Bannon as a foil and they're picking on Van Daan's criticism of Trump in order to drive a wedge in other words I think a lot of people have now figured out Trump's gig his whole shtick his whole shtick is if you praise him he likes you and if you criticize him he doesn't that's Trump's entire stick so a lot of people are basically now pecked picking up on this and they're trying to find instances where their own political opponents have attacked Trump and then they're trying to highlight to trump those people are attacking him so he'll move away from their policies good example of this so Sarah Huckabee Sanders who is obviously in the administration a lot of people in the administration are not big band and fans he was just out stat a couple of weeks ago she Steve Bannon had said that Trump's biggest mistake was firing James Comey the FBI director Sarah Huckabee Sanders is trying to drive a wedge between Bannon and Trump here she's doing it I think that everybody knows exactly where the president stands on that issue the president is proud of the decision that he made the president was 100% right in firing James Comey he knew at the time that it could be bad for him politically but he also knew and felt he had an obligation to do what was right and do what was right for the American people and certainly the men and women at the FBI I think there's no secret Comey about his own self admission leaked privileged government information weeks before President Trump fired him coming testified that an FBI agent engaged in the same practice they'd face serious repercussions I think he set his own stage for himself on that front his actions were improper and likely could have been illegal coming leaked memos to the New York Times your own outlet he politicized an investigation by signaling he would exonerate Hillary Clinton before he ever interviewed her or other key witnesses so then it's smart for Huckabee Sanders to do all this because she's defending Trump now from Manning but here's here's the giveaway here's what Mitch McConnell is doing today okay here's the Senate leadership fund they're specifically going after Steve Bannon because Bannon is trying now to undermine a lot of Mitch McConnell's favorite candidates so here's what McConnell said Senate leaders funf president and CEO Stephen law today released the following statement in response to Steve ban and calling James commies firing the biggest mistake in modern political history quote Steve Annan is dead wrong every fact that has come out about James commies handling of the Clinton email investigation has affirmed the rightness of President Trump's decision now do you think that Mitch McConnell actually believes that or do you think that Mitch McConnell is trying to play the president in Mitch McConnell is pretty clearly trying to play the president you're gonna get more of this the Democrats are trying to play Trump by praising him Mitch McConnell is trying to play trump by attacking Bannon for attacking Trump everyone knows the game now and the game is personal it is not political it'll be interesting to see how it plays out okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate and then a quick Bible talk so things that I like I'm doing children's movies this week because I just have to be in that mood man I mean like going to Berkeley it's it's gonna be fun and all but it's also kind of stressful and so watching children's movies with my kids or my kid because one of them is too young to watch movies is is really fun my daughter right now is obsessed with Bambi she loves Bambi this was the Golden Age of Walt Disney's films I believe this was the third Walt Disney film I think that it went Snow White Pinocchio Bambi in order but Bambi is a masterpiece I mean it's just the artwork is a masterpiece again the the the attempt to promulgate traditional values in Bambi is very strong the idea of the fathered year and the mother deer and the and the baby deer Bambi growing up into the protector of the herd right males are there to protect is the very strong theme in Bambi mothers are there to nurture males are there to protect is a very very strong theme in Bambi here's a little bit of the preview such a charming film well is me the world's greatest storyteller brings the world's greatest love story to the screen Bambi the story that proves that love can be loaded with rocks well they're twitterpated whoever painted nearly everybody get put your feet into the springtime it's not gonna happen to me me neither anybody for example you are walking along minding your own business when all of a sudden you run smack into a puppy face begins to get weak in the knees whoa I mean the movie today would be art skits heteronormative it's too dark for children I mean Bambi's mom gets shot halfway through the film I mean it's a very dark film but again and teaches some life lessons that I think yeah remember people just tougher that okay Bambi came out in 1942 we were already the middle of World War two a lot of dads were off to war and the idea that that you know it was the mail job to protect the civilized society I think it's pretty clear actually in the film I don't think that it's particularly well hidden I'm wrong about this being the third film this is actually film number five because it goes Snow White in the Seven Dwarves Pinocchio Fantasia which is also a masterpiece a Dumbo which is a masterpiece Bambi which is a masterpiece those all I mean those five films are all masterpieces they're all amazing films and then you get in sort of the second iteration of Disney in 1950 right that's when you get Cinderella Alice in Wonderland Peter Pan a lady in the Tramp Sleeping Beauty all of these are good movies but I don't think they're quite to the level of the originals and then you get the dark period for Disney that's when you get Robin Hood the sword in the stone the Aristocats they're the only great film from that particular period is The Adventures of Robin Hood but you get the rescuers the Black Cauldron right movies that no one's ever seen because they're not good and then you have kind of the second you have the the third wave for Disney which is Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King Pocahontas right a lot of great movies and now it's been taken over by Pixar but but Bambi is obviously a phenomenal movie and well worth watching with your kids especially you can sit there with the kids so you can fast-forward through some of the scary parts okay others okay so time for some things that oh one other thing that I like there's a Barry Weiss column over at the New York Times that I think is really terrific talking about my visit to Berkeley it's well worth reading yes we have reached the apocalypse when the New York Times opinion page is defending my visit to Berkeley basically saying that you know the left's attempt to lump everyone is in his Nazis is utterly absurd great column by Barry Weiss and I thank her for writing it ok time for a couple of things that I hate so one of the things that has happened is that as our technology gets better we get dumber we seem to have less purpose in the world I'm starting to write a book on this right now we seem to have less purpose we seem to have less meaning in our lives and so our technology continues to grow our science continues to get better and then we use it for the stupidest available crap you could possibly imagine if you can imagine people saying oh we've developed technology that allows facial recognition and we develop technology that allows us to map your face what could you use that for you know and in a good way well maybe you could use it to help for example teach autistic kids how to recognize emotion right now that seems like a good use of it because a lot of autistic kids have difficulty recognizing emotions and faces how exactly are we going to use it however the way we are going to use it is we are going to make ourselves into talking pieces of poop this was actually in the Apple iPhone 10 presentation yesterday in in they're big they're big roll out the truth that camera also enables new experiences by bringing emojis to life by mapping more than 50 facial muscles in real time so you can be happy or sad or cross you can be any animated character you wish to be you can be a talking piece of poop yeah well welcome to the 21st century we we may have given up on you know values and systems who may have given up on the idea of a God that cares about you in the universe but on the other hand we can also we can also make you we can devolve you to the level of a talking piece of human feces we can make that happen for you so that's very exciting stuff okay other things that I hate there's a lot of talk today about firing Jamel Hill Jamil Hill she is a a host on ESPN she does it a truly awful show with Michael Smith called sd-6 I know because whenever I'm working out at the gym this thing is on it's a really crappy show I'm but this is not a critique of the show which is indeed garbage Jamil Hill came out and she she tweeted this yesterday Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself with other white supremacists the height of white privilege is being able to ignore his white supremacy because it's of no threat to you well it's a threat to me Trump is the most ignorant offensive president of my lifetime his rise the direct result of white supremacy period he is unqualified unfit to be President he's not a leader and if you were not white he never would have been elected okay an ESPN quickly responded with this statement they said the comments on Twitter from Jamil Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPM we have addressed this with Jamil she recognizes her actions were inappropriate okay I hate everything about this first of all Jamil Hill is wrong the idea that Trump is in a white supremacist is not true Trump is not good on race issues but the idea that he himself is a white supremacist rather than pandering to a group of white supremacist I think is false you know maybe it's a distinction without much of a difference but I think that it does matter if you're going to attribute motives to people we should at least be specific about the motives we attribute yeah this idea that that Trump is is the root of all racial evil in the United States is just a repeat of Tana he's he coats but she has every right to say it obviously she can say whatever she wants now ESPN would be well within its rights to suspend or fire her they could say listen you just alienated half our audience you're here to talk about sports not to talk about Donald Trump but instead they issue this kind of milquetoast statement saying they don't that her her actions were inappropriate well I don't think they're actually inappropriate I mean she gets paid to talk about all this stuff including politics on her show it seems kinda ridiculous to me then now ESPN is backing off with this but do they think we don't watch the network the big problem you span is happening right now is that I just want to see the highlights of the Cleveland Indians winning their 20th game in the row instead I turn on the TV and I got Colin Kapernick talk for 45 minutes I get how many gay college football players are there for 45 minutes I get what's the latest with Caitlyn Jenner for 45 minutes like I can't get to the actual highlights because all you're doing is spending time talking about stupid political nonsense that I don't care about in any in any form and then the SPN is shocked when Jamil hill feels the freedom to go out and do this now there's another story that came out yesterday that Linda Cohen who's a longtime anchor that she was reportedly suspended because she spoke out on politics at the network she said I don't think these politics are great at the network and the president John skipper told her not to come to work and to think about what she said so she was suspended for saying ESPN was talking too much politics Jamil Howe was not suspended for saying Trump was racist they say here's my feeling about this Jamil Hale shouldn't be fired she shouldn't be suspended let the audience make their decision about you male ho Linda Cohen certainly should not be fired or suspended for having the temerity to point out the stupidity of ESPN for going full-scale political it's one of my pet peeves I've been talking about it for years turning ESPN into MSNBC with footballs is just absurd okay time for a quick Bible talk here so as we do every week we are going through portions from the from the prophets because in the Jewish community we last year we went over the entire five books of Moses piece by piece this year we are going through the the portions from the prophets that are associated with them this is from Isaiah chapter 61 it says for like the earth which gives forth its plans and like a garden that causes its seeds to grow so shall the Lord God cause righteousness and praise to grow opposite all the nations there's kind of an interesting verse the reason it's an interesting verse is because the idea is that all things are invested with potentiality I've been reading too much Edward feasor that's that book that I recommend it a couple of days ago and he talks about the Aristotelian notion that objects are are imbued with potentialities that a pen is imbued with the potential to write that a cup is imbued with the potential to hold liquid or to be melted down we all have potentials right we as human beings have potentials and the earth has the potential to give forth plans and a garden has the potential to to give forth to give forth the the its seeds to grow and you have the potential to be a righteous person and God can help you reach that potential if you trust in him but you have to understand that in the Aristotelian argument that there is no unmoved that there is an unmoved mover that that when it comes to growth that growth requires a mover now you have freewill imbued in you by God and you can use that to change your life you can use that to make your life better you are you you have potential just like the earth just like the garden you have potential trust in God which really means faith in your own free will to make decisions doing that allows you to fulfill that potential if you sit back and you wait for things to happen for you if you blame the garden for not growing the seeds if you blame the earth for not giving forth the plans if you blame God for your problems you're not gonna get anywhere you have to understand that your it is your job to reach your own potential and that potential does exist within you and once you start moving in that direction I firmly believe that God lends a hand okay we will be back here tomorrow and we will preview the speech at Berkeley so tomorrow is gonna be a big day hope you're here I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
