00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,777
THANK YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT.

9
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:16,911
YOU KNOW THE KAVANAUGHS WAY

10
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:18,680
BETTER THAN THE REST OF US.

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,315
IT SEEMED TOWARD THE END OF THE

12
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:22,417
INTERVIEW, HE WAS EMOTIONAL,

13
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:23,251
SAYING THAT HE WILL STAND BY AND

14
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:23,251
SAYING THAT HE WILL STAND BY AND

15
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,619
HE SAID IN HIS LETTER, HE OWES

16
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,754
IT TO THE WOMEN LIKE YOU HAVE

17
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:28,390
GOT TO BAT FOR HIM.

18
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,026
>> THEY ARE A VERY STRONG FAMILY

19
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:31,026
>> THEY ARE A VERY STRONG FAMILY

20
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,628
BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN

21
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:37,632
EXCRUCIATING PROCESS.

22
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,133
IT’S VERY PAINFUL.

23
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:38,834
IT’S A PAINFUL THING FOR YOUR

24
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,369
CHILDREN TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

25
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:41,770
BUT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG

26
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,173
AND HE IS DEDICATED TO CLEARING

27
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:46,642
HIS NAME AND HAVING AN

00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,977
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY.

29
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:50,445
I THINK THE CONVERSATION THAT HE

30
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:50,445
I THINK THE CONVERSATION THAT HE

31
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:51,546
HAD WITH MARTHA EARLIER TODAY

32
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:55,184
WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND HAVING AN

33
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:55,184
WAS REALLY HELPFUL AND HAVING AN

34
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:57,453
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I THINK

35
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:58,787
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

36
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:00,589
>> Shannon: THERE ARE THOSE

37
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:01,423
WHO, WHEN YOU EXPRESS ANY

38
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:03,225
EMPATHY FOR HIS FAMILY, THEY

39
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:05,027
WILL SAY, WHAT ABOUT THESE

40
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:05,394
ACCUSERS?

41
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:07,429
WHAT ABOUT THESE WOMEN?

42
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,198
BY THE SYMPATHY OR EMPATHY FOR

43
00:01:09,198 --> 00:01:10,232
THE KAVANAUGHS AND NOT THE

44
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:12,034
WOMEN?

45
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:14,603
>> TO BE CLEAR, I DO HAVE GREAT

46
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:16,205
EMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN

47
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:16,205
EMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN

48
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:17,239
THE VICTIM OF ASSAULTS.

49
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,043
IT’S A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING.

50
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:21,043
IT’S A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THING.

51
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:23,312
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, I HAVE

52
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,581
KNOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR ALMOST

53
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:25,581
KNOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR ALMOST

54
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:26,215
20 YEARS.

55
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,985
HE IS A GOOD, MORAL PERSON.

56
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:29,886
HE’S AN UPSTANDING PERSON, A

57
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:33,222
PERSON OF INCREDIBLY HIGH

58
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:33,856
INTEGRITY.

59
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:36,125
HE HAS A SPOTLESS RECORD.

60
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,494
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS DO NOT

61
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:41,798
DRIVE WITH THE PERSON THAT I

62
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,032
KNOW WITH THE MORE THAN 100

63
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:44,834
WOMEN WHO HAVE SIGNED LETTERS,

64
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,169
SPOKEN OUT PUBLICLY, WHO KNOW

65
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,605
HIM PERSONALLY.

66
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:49,539
SIMPLY, YOU CAN’T RECONCILE

67
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,673
THESE BEHAVIORS WITH THE PERSON

68
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:53,776
THAT WE KNOW.

69
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,611
WITH THIS INCREDIBLE FATHER AT

70
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,846
THIS INCREDIBLE HUSBAND AND THIS

71
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:56,846
THIS INCREDIBLE HUSBAND AND THIS

72
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:57,347
INCREDIBLE FRIEND.

73
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:59,082
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU

74
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,885
AND OTHERS FOR ALL OF US, THIS

75
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:02,352
IS CHALLENGING.

76
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:06,389
PEOPLE COME AFTER US FOR

77
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,791
DEFENDING OUR FRIEND, BRETT.

78
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,092
BUT HE WOULD DO THE SAME THING

79
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:09,893
FOR US.

80
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:12,395
HE HAS THAT KIND OF PERSON.

81
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,797
I THINK IT SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF

82
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:13,797
I THINK IT SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF

83
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:14,731
HIS CHARACTER.

84
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,733
>> Shannon: I WILL PLAY

85
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:17,601
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR JOE

MANCHIN, A DEMOCRAT, ONE OF

87
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:20,637
THOSE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE WHEN

88
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,038
IT COMES TO THIS, HERE’S WHAT HE

89
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:22,038
IT COMES TO THIS, HERE’S WHAT HE

90
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,440
SAID ABOUT ALL SIDES OF THIS.

91
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,677
>> WHOEVER OR HOWEVER MANY, THEY

92
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:26,677
>> WHOEVER OR HOWEVER MANY, THEY

00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,512
ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND WE

00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:28,512
ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND WE

95
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:30,047
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AS QUICKLY

96
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:30,580
AS POSSIBLE.

97
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,915
HE ALSO HAS A RIGHT TO CLEAR HIS

00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:31,915
HE ALSO HAS A RIGHT TO CLEAR HIS

00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:32,883
NAME.

100
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:33,450
HE TRULY DOES.

101
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,952
THAT IS WHAT I AM HOPING FOR.

102
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:36,653
WE CAN GET TO IT AS QUICKLY AS

103
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,155
WE CAN THIS WEEK OR WHATEVER HE

104
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:38,455
TAKES.

105
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,057
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK YOU

106
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,259
WILL GET A FAIR SHAKE?

107
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,060
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DEMOCRATIC

108
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,794
SENATORS IS SAYING THAT THEY

109
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,029
BELIEVE HER AND HE IS GUILTY,

110
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,497
WITHOUT HEARING FROM BOTH OF

111
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:47,831
THEM UNDER OATH.

112
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:51,802
>> IT’S UNFORTUNATE THAT FOLKS

113
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,437
ARE MOVING SO QUICKLY TO THAT

114
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:55,139
AND NOT GIVING BOTH SIDES AN

115
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,074
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.

116
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,076
HE DOES DESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE

CORROBORATING EVIDENCE?

149
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,253
THAT’S VERY TROUBLESOME.

150
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:44,823
AS THE MOTHER OF BOTH A SON AND

151
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:45,490
DAUGHTER, IT IS ESPECIALLY

152
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:45,857
TROUBLING.

153
