let me show you what Krista Freeland said about America okay biggest diplomatic Fiasco since well I guess India Trump offered a concession in private to Justin Trudeau Trudeau accepted it in private and the concession was about the five-year expiration of leptin so Trump and Trudeau got along in private Trump made a concession to Trudeau and then when Trump Khan was playing in left in public Trudeau had a press conference saying Trump was insulting Canadians and pushing us around right after Trump made a concession and gave you know what he wanted of course Trump was furious that's a big problem in fact Trump said that little outburst by the shiny Pony is gonna cost Canada a lot of money I actually like Justin hey you know I think he's good I like him but he shouldn't have done that that was a mistake that's gonna cost him a lot of money okay so here's Canada's attempt at damage control the 2 3 2 tariffs introduced by the United States are illegal under WTO and NAFTA rules they are protectionism pure and simple they are not a response to unfair actions by other countries that put American industry at a disadvantage they are a naked example of the United States putting its thumb on the scale in violation of the very rules it helped to write Canada has no choice but to retaliate with a measured perfectly reciprocal dollar-for-dollar response and we will do so we act in close collaboration with our like-minded partners in the EU and Mexico they too are your allies and they share our astonishment and our resolve yeah I'm guessing that crack team of Christians angels wrote this speech I hear that when you're in a insult fight with Donald Trump the best way to win is keep poking him I mean it's not like the US economy is 10 times larger than if Canada US trade were to fall in half because of an insane Armageddon trade war I don't even think it could ever get that bad well that would reduce u.s. GDP by 1% so great for America but they're on pace for what 4 percent four and half percent record GDP growth this year so you take one percent off that that's not even gonna dent it but if you cut Canada US trade in half that would reduce Canadian GDP by ten percent in other words it would be the worst depression in Canada since the dirty thirties that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
