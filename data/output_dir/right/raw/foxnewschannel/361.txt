1
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:02,999
ON NO DOUBT.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,735
THANK YOU FOR LEADING US ALL.

3
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:07,036
HEAR JOHN KENNEDY FROM

4
00:00:07,037 --> 00:00:07,403
LOUISIANA.

5
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:10,172
HE SITS ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY

6
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:10,706
COMMITTEE.

7
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:11,340
GOOD EVENING.

8
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,842
>> GOOD EVENING, ED.

9
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:14,644
>> Ed: LAST WEEK YOU CALLED THIS

10
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:18,180
AN INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW.

11
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:21,117
WHERE ARE WE TONIGHT.

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:23,686
>> IT'S AN ENTER GALACTIC FREAK

13
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:24,921
SHOW ON STEROIDS.

14
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:26,122
>> Ed: WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

15
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:27,523
WE THINK HE WILL BE CONFIRMED

16
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:28,457
UNLESS THERE'S A SURPRISE.

17
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,159
>> I'M VERY PLEASED.

18
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,427
THERE'S NO WINNERS.

19
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:34,297
I'LL BET YOU THIS TIME JUDGE

20
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,298
KAVANAUGH TOMORROW NIGHT, JUDGE

21
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,200
KAVANAUGH, WHO I THINK WILL BE

22
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,535
CONFIRMED AND I'M VERY PLEASED,

23
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,404
HE WON'T FEEL LIKE A WINNER.

24
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,206
I BET DR. FORD AND HER FAMILY

25
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:46,242
WON'T FEEL LIKE A WINNER.

26
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:49,946
IT ALL COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED

27
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:53,883
IF SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAD TURNED

28
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:56,686
OVER DR. FORD'S ANONYMOUS NOTE

29
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:59,889
TO US, WE COULD HAVE

30
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,326
INVESTIGATED WITHOUT THE

31
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:04,327
INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW.

32
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:05,528
IT'S VERY, VERY SAD.

33
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:06,529
THERE'S NO WINNERS.

34
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,066
>> SPEAKING OF SENATOR

35
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,268
FEINSTEIN, YOUR CHAIRMAN,

36
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,004
REPUBLICAN CHUCK GRASSLEY ON

37
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:15,771
"FOX AND FRIENDS" DID NOT NAME

38
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,506
HER BUT HE SUGGESTED THAT

39
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,442
DEMOCRATS TRIED TO COACH

40
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:20,443
WITNESSES TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY

41
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:21,243
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

42
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:25,114
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

43
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:27,583
>> WE UNDERSTAND THAT LELAND

44
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:29,885
KAISER, THE FORMER FRIEND OF

45
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:33,055
DR. FORD, FEELS -- FELT PRESSURE

46
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:35,891
TO RE-VISIT HER DENIAL OF

47
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:37,393
KNOWING ABOUT THE ALLEGED

48
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:37,727
ASSAULT.

49
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:39,061
>> I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT

50
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,497
BECAUSE IT'S IN THE FBI REPORT.

51
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,100
BUT THERE'S EVIDENCE ABOUT OTHER

52
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,835
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED

53
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:47,303
THAT THEY WERE LED INTO IT AS

54
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:47,603
WELL.

55
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:48,738
>> YOU SAW THAT FBI REPORT.

56
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:54,110
WHAT IS HE REFERRING TO?

57
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,745
>> I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT

58
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:56,078
EITHER.

59
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,947
IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE NOT TO

60
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,515
RELEASE THE FBI REPORT.

61
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,317
I TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL

62
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:04,353
DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

63
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:06,288
>> Ed: YOU'RE TANTALIZING US

64
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,424
MORE.

65
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,725
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO CALLED FOR

66
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:10,860
TRANSPARENCY, I NOTICED SHE

67
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,461
KEEPS SAYING WE NEED TO KEEP

68
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:15,031
THIS FBI REPORT CONFIDENTIAL.

69
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:16,999
THAT'S BECAUSE DEMOCRATS DON'T

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,267
WANT US TO SEE SOMETHING?

71
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:21,170
>> I DISAGREE WITH HER.

72
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,205
I AGREE WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY'S

73
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:23,572
COMMENTS.

74
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:25,241
UNDER THE LAW, WE CAN'T TALK

75
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:26,308
ABOUT THE DETAILS.

76
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,643
I WISH WE COULD.

77
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:29,145
IT'S CLEAR TO ME NOW MORE THAN

78
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,881
EVER THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

79
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,649
POLITICS INVOLVED IN THIS.

80
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,585
FBI INTERVIEWED EVERY ONE OF THE

81
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,454
WITNESSES SUGGESTED BY

82
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:39,955
MRS. RAMIREZ AND DR. FORD.

83
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,757
NOT A SINGLE ONE CORROBORATED

84
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:42,792
THE ALLEGATIONS.

85
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,527
AND THERE WERE SOME INDICATIONS

86
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:45,594
OF POLITICS.

87
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:47,997
AND I THINK WE'RE MAKING A

88
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:50,232
MISTAKE NOT TO ALLOW THE

89
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,400
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THIS

90
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,270
REPORT AND JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES.

91
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,304
I TRUST THEM.

92
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,440
>> Ed: YOU SAID ALSO IN RECENT

93
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,041
DAYS THAT CONGRESS HAS HIT ROCK

94
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,843
BOTTOM AND KEEPS ON DIGGING.

95
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:01,677
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE

96
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:02,378
REFERRING TO THIS.

97
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,882
BUT THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER

98
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:07,583
NANCY PELOSI COMPARED JUDGE

99
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:10,252
KAVANAUGH TO A DICTATOR.

100
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:10,586
LISTEN.

101
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:13,022
>> I GUESS THERE'S A SIMILARITY

102
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:15,791
THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THE PEOPLE

103
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:21,397
THAT THEY -- LOVE WITH KIM

104
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:22,798
JONG-UN, THINKS KAVANAUGH IS A

105
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,667
GREAT OUTSTANDING PERSON.

106
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:25,468
YOU KNOW WHAT?

107
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,105
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S

108
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:31,373
TALKING ABOUT.

109
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,109
>> Ed: HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT?

110
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,944
>> I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SAY

111
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:38,781
THIS, BUT I'M GOING TO BE FRANK.

112
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:41,317
BILLY GOAT BRAIN,

113
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:41,617
MOUTH.

114
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:42,151
>> Ed: WOW.

115
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,019
>> THAT'S JUST TYPICAL.

116
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,323
THAT'S SYMBOLIC OF ALL THAT HAS

117
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:48,290
GONE ON.

118
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,494
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS

119
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:58,734
WAY.

120
00:03:58,735 --> 00:03:59,969
THERE'S SOME HIGH POINTS --

121
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,437
>> Ed: SUCH AS WHAT?

122
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,105
LET'S GIVE A POSITIVE.

123
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,441
>> I'M SO PLEASED THAT JUDGE

124
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,209
KAVANAUGH WILL BE CONFIRMED.

125
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,178
I'M SO PLEASED THAT DUE PROCESS

126
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,213
STILL MATTERS IN AMERICA.

127
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,816
I'M SO PLEASED THAT THERE'S MORE

128
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:16,218
AWARENESS ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE

129
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,220
IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S

130
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:18,621
REAL.

131
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:19,889
IT'S ABSOLUTELY REAL.

132
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,791
>> Ed: IN FACT, YOU SAID THE

133
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,859
OTHER DAY THERE'S NO ROOM FOR

134
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,194
CREEPY OLD MEN OR CREEPY YOUNG

135
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:25,461
MEN.

136
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:28,197
BUT THIS IS NOT A COUNTRY, THIS

137
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,598
IS NOT AMERICA WITHOUT INNOCENT

138
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:30,499
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

139
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,167
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

140
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:33,402
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

141
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,570
ADVANCED THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE

142
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,839
MORALLY TAINTED IF YOU DON'T

143
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,407
AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THE

144
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:38,774
ACCUSER.

145
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,176
THAT'S WRONG.

146
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,210
THAT'S UN-AMERICAN.

147
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:42,778
YOU'RE MORALLY TAINTED IF YOU

148
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,580
DON'T TREAT BOTH THE ACCUSER AND

149
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:47,216
THE ACCUSED WITH FAIRNESS AND

150
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:50,386
WITH RESPECT AND WITH DUE

151
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:50,719
PROCESS.

152
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,423
BUT THIS PROCESS, I MEAN,

153
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,592
FINALLY WE DECIDED THAT PEOPLE

154
00:04:56,593 --> 00:05:01,697
WERE GOING TO HAVE DUE PROCESS.

155
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,200
BUT IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE

156
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,935
EPISODE, IF OUR FOUNDERS COULD

157
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,037
HAVE ENVISIONED CONFIRMATION

158
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,439
BEING LIKE THIS, A COUPLE

159
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,974
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE STUCK WITH

160
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:17,012
KING GEORGE.

161
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:17,680
IT'S BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT.

162
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,315
>> YOU'RE HAPPY THAT JUDGE

163
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:21,116
KAVANAUGH WILL BECOME JUSTICE

164
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:21,483
KAVANAUGH.

165
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:24,119
BUT THERE MAY BE AN ASTERISKS IF

166
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,754
YOU LIVE TO DEMOCRATS.

167
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:28,190
JOHN PAUL STEPHENS HAD THIS TO

168
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,925
SAY ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT.

169
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:30,292
LISTEN.

170
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:33,462
>> HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED

171
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:38,968
WHEN HE WAS EARLIER.

172
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:42,338
BUT HIS PERFORMANCE CAUSED ME TO

173
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,306
CHANGE MY MIND.

174
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:47,643
>> Ed: I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY

175
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:50,579
HE WAS ACCUSED FALSELY OF RAPE.

176
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,714
BUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH ADMITTED

177
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,983
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GONE TOO FAR,

178
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:54,516
SIR.

179
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,619
>> LOOK, JUSTICE STEPHENS IS

180
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,386
ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION.

181
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:58,554
THIS IS AMERICA.

182
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:00,756
WHAT I SAW FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH

183
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:04,760
AT THE HEARING WAS A HUMAN BEING

184
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:08,297
RESPONDING TO BEING CALLED RICH,

185
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:10,733
LYING, DRUNK, SEXUAL PREDATOR

186
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,402
AND HE RESPONDED HE WAS OFFENDED

187
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:16,772
ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF, HIS

188
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:18,140
REPUTATION, HIS SPOUSE, HIS

189
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,742
13-YEAR-OLD AND HIS 10-YEAR-OLD.

190
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:22,177
I SAW A HUMAN BEING RESPONDING

191
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,579
TO WILD ACCUSATIONS.

192
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,880
THAT HE HATED WOMEN.

193
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:25,981
HE HATED CHILDREN.

194
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:28,684
HE HATED LITTLE WARM PUPPIES.

195
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:29,551
HE WAS EVIL.

196
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,420
THIS THING -- THIS THING WOULD

197
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:33,255
BE OVER THE TOP IF SOME PEOPLE

198
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:34,156
BELIEVED IN A TOP.

199
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:36,425
>> Ed: SENATOR, I HAVE LESS THAN

200
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:37,259
A MINUTE.

201
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,694
YOU JUST HEARD JOHN ROBERTS

202
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:39,695
REPORT THAT PEOPLE ALREADY ON

203
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:42,831
THE LEFT SAYING THAT SUSAN

204
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,400
COLLINS FOR VOTING FOR THE JUDGE

205
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,735
IS AN APOLOGIST FOR RAPISTS.

206
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,037
YOU HAD PEOPLE ACCUSE JUDGE

207
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:50,172
KAVANAUGH OF BEING A RAPIST HE

208
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:50,806
SAYS FALSELY.

209
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:52,708
HOW DO WE PICK UP THE PIECES?

210
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,910
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO PRESIDENT

211
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,210
TRUMP?

212
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,079
WE HAVE A MID-TERM ELECTION THAT

213
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,213
MIGHT BE NASTIER.

214
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,916
AFTER THAT ELECTION, HOW DO YOU

215
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,117
PICK UP THE PIECES?

216
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:05,454
>> I WOULD SAY NUMBER 1, WE HAVE

217
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,556
TO RECOGNIZE THAT SEXUAL

218
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,924
VIOLENCE IS REAL IN THIS

219
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:09,258
COUNTRY.

220
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,859
THERE'S NO COUNTRY FOR CREEPY

221
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,728
OLD MEN OR MIDDLE AGED MEN, BUT

222
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,264
IT'S NO COUNTRY AT ALL WITHOUT

223
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:16,165
DUE PROCESS.

224
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,934
PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND

225
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,069
THEMSELVES.

226
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,371
NO ONE IS GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN

227
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:23,505
INNOCENT.

228
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:25,040
YOU'RE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN

229
00:07:25,041 --> 00:00:00,000
GUILTY.
