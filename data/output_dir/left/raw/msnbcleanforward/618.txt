I THINK ROSENSTEIN IS THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL IS BASICALLY

25
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,710
ATTORNEY GENERAL IS BASICALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN THE

26
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,478
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO THE

27
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,613
WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

28
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,747
MUELLER INVESTIGATION. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL REGULATIONS

29
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,082
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL REGULATIONS WHICH I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:02,796
ARE MADE ULTIMATELY BY ROSENSTEIN.

37
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,299
ROSENSTEIN. SO IF ROSENSTEIN GOES, THEN YOU

38
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,733
SO IF ROSENSTEIN GOES, THEN YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE REPLACING HIM

39
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:07,934
KNOW YOU COULD BE REPLACING HIM WITH SOMEONE WHO IS THE

40
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,837
WITH SOMEONE WHO IS THE PRESIDENT’S LACKEY AND THE

41
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:11,238
PRESIDENT’S LACKEY AND THE PRESIDENT IS FOND OF DOING THAT

42
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:13,006
PRESIDENT IS FOND OF DOING THAT IN ALL SORTS OF OTHER AREAS,

43
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,641
IN ALL SORTS OF OTHER AREAS, WHICH IS ONE REASON HE HAS BEEN

44
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,376
WHICH IS ONE REASON HE HAS BEEN SO CRITICAL OF ROSENSTEIN.

45
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,845
SO CRITICAL OF ROSENSTEIN. AND WHEN WE WROTE THE

46
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,447
AND WHEN WE WROTE THE REGULATIONS IN 1999, WE

47
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:21,748
REGULATIONS IN 1999, WE UNDERSTOOD PRESIDENTS WERE GOING

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,350
UNDERSTOOD PRESIDENTS WERE GOING TO DO BAD THINGS AT VARIOUS

49
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:23,650
TO DO BAD THINGS AT VARIOUS TIMES.

50
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:25,620
TIMES. WE THOUGHT ABOUT NIXON WHO WAS

52
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:29,623
KIND OF AN AMATEUR LEVEL WRONG DOER.

53

TRUMP HAS TAKEN THIS PRO. HE’S GONE PRO ON THIS.

55
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:33,360
HE’S GONE PRO ON THIS. THAT’S THE REAL CONCERN, THAT

56
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,062
THAT’S THE REAL CONCERN, THAT YOU CAN HAVE SOMEONE COME IN AS

MY UNDERSTANDING NOW IS THAT IF HE’S FIRED, THEN IT JUST GOES TO

69
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,886
HE’S FIRED, THEN IT JUST GOES TO THE NEXT PERSON IN THE

APPELLATE LAWYER LIKE KEN STARR. HE’S NOT A PROSECUTOR AND I

79
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,868
HE’S NOT A PROSECUTOR AND I THINK IT’S FAIR TO SAY HE’S BEEN
