1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
I was born only a year after Columbine,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,580
Called one of the worst school shootings in our nation.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,360
Every couple of months, every
couple of weeks, throughout my entire life -

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,080
Virginia Tech.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,840
Newtown.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,040
29 dead.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,340
26 who were killed, children.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,880
We had seen it disappear, we had seen people forget.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,860
It's not the time to talk about gun
control.

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,560
Gun control is not the answer here.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,000
If all our government and president can do is

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,180
send "thoughts and prayers," then it's time
for victims to be the change that we

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,940
need to see.

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,720
The students of Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School are

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,460
changing the narrative around school
shootings.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,780
Why should they listen to me?

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,800
Because I had to sit in a classroom, in
the dark,

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,510
next to 20 of my friends watching us all
text our parents that we love them,

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,980
because we didn't know if the shooter
was going to come up to our door.

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,580
That's why I'm credible.

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,300
We wanted to know what
other students might be thinking, so we asked.

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,720
And got over 1,600 responses.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,980
Generally I think I could say I feel
pretty safe in my school.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,660
I should feel safe.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,080
I definitely don't feel safe at
schools right now.

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,520
*Scoffs* Well, no. No. It's a clear "no".

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,540
School shootings have kind of just been a lot

28
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,248
this year.

29
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,720
What if we're next?

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,860
I feel very safe. Our school

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,220
just spent a bunch of money on like,
security upgrades, which

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,720
you know.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,460
Perhaps I'm just telling myself I'm safe, because
I want to be.

34
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,240
We do have campus carry here. I do
sometimes feel safer when I'm with my

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,840
friends that I do know like, have
concealed carry weapons with them.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,240
I sit in school in fear, because of the status
quo.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,700
Ever since I was a kid really that I

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,000
can remember, I remember school shootings
being a thing.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,750
I haven't felt safe since

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,009
Sandy Hook happened and I was only in
like sixth grade back then and I just

41
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,009
haven't really felt safe, I've always had
some kind of anxiety going into school.

42
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:05,340
Maybe this is a real possibility, like
this is something that could happen to me.

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,220
Yeah I feel safe, but there's this
part of me that wonders if I should be

44
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:11,820
feeling safe.

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,620
The lights went out in the
library a few days ago and everyone was

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,260
just kind of prickled up like, what's
going on?

47
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,318
Do we need to run?

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,020
Do we need to hide?

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,240
We do routine lockdown drills.

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,480
This is pretty terrifying, the fact that we have
to sit here and pretend that a shooter

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,740
is coming into our school.

52
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,820
We have a
policy that's called "Run Hide Fight" for

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,780
an active shooter.

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,840
I am lucky enough that
I have a school with outdoor hallways

55
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,760
which means, in an event of an evacuation
I have much more exit points than a

56
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,860
normal school would.

57
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,350
I know a couple spots
that I could potentially hide in if they

58
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,220
were unlocked.

59
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,160
They say, "oh if they come
into your classroom start throwing

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,960
textbooks, start throwing desks, go and
punch them and that's gonna do nothing."

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,140
What do I think of teachers having
access to guns?

62
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,960
I don't like the idea at all.

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,900
It's a terrible idea.

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,720
Quite possibly
the stupidest situation I could ever think of.

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,660
Arming teachers is
normalizing school shootings.

66
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,280
It could be

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,440
beneficial, but it has to, I mean it'd have to
be done right.

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,340
Teachers with guns is like

69
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,520
not a good teaching environment for
young kids who need like sunshine and rainbows.

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,880
I would feel much safer
actually, with them being armed.

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,080
The day I recorded this, March 14th, 2018

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,209
a student
in California was injured because of a

73
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,460
teacher having a firearm and
accidentally discharging it in the classroom.

74
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,039
This plan reminds me a lot of what
students call "bullsh*t."

75
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,260
We need to start

76
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,320
thinking about what we can do before the
gun enters the school.

77
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,200
One solution

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
could just be having metal detectors.

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,669
Universal background checks, raising the

80
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,920
age by a firearm to 21.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,879
I'm not one for banning guns, because I feel like there

82
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,930
are good law-abiding citizens that
deserve to have the right to have a gun.

83
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,769
If your right is apparently harming the
lives of other students, it shouldn't be

84
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,240
considered a right anymore.

85
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,250
I think really the only guns that should be

86
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,480
allowed at the most are hunting rifles.

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,239
The average citizen does not need to be

88
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,460
able to purchase any of the AKs, the 47
the 10. Any of those.

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,820
Regulate ammo a lot more.

90
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,980
Nothing in the Second Amendment
states anything about ammo.

91
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,579
Would it be

92
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,800
so bad to consider similar laws to what
exists in the UK and Australia and

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Canada and all of these places where
they don't have a mass shooting every week?

94
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,180
Our government needs to really step
up and do what they're supposed to do,

95
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,759
because it seems like students now are
being the leaders that our leaders are

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,560
supposed to be.

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,030
I feel like there isn't really
much I can do because you know I'm like

98
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,940
one person, but I feel like we can all do
something together.

99
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,860
I just wrote a letter to my senator.

100
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,940
If I can talk to Congress,
I would just you know flat out say

101
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,820
"put more security in schools."

102
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,860
Stop taking money from the NRA.

103
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,979
I don't understand

104
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,719
how anyone can feel okay with themselves
knowing that students are dying and you

105
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:02,420
have an opportunity to fix it and you're
not.

106
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,159
It's not the liberal lobbyists that

107
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,610
the NRA has to fear, it's not our
representatives, or even our senators.

108
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,860
It's not our parents.

109
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,900
It's us.

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,280
And you should be scared. I'm 18, I voted in my primaries.

111
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,360
I'll be able to vote in the
next elections, so.

112
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,220
I'll be 18 next month, so I will be able
to vote in midterms.

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360
We need to vote people

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,880
out who take money from the NRA.

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,099
Let our legislators to know that we are not

116
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,480
gonna remain silent, that we demand
change.

117
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,569
And they should really be the

118
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,590
ones dedicating time to thinking and
solving these issues, not a 15 year old

119
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,600
like in a classroom.

120
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,719
I just want to say
thank you to the 1,635 students that

121
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,680
wrote in to us from around the world.

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,039
I'm sorry we couldn't put every single one

123
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,039
of you into this video, but trust me we read

124
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,320
every word you sent in and it was
integral to us making this video.

125
00:05:59,320 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.
