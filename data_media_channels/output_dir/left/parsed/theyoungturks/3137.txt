TODAY, MIKE FLYNN PLED GUILTY
TO LYING TO THE FBI, HE WAS
FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
TO DONALD TRUMP, WE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT ALL THE CHARGES HE FACED
IN ANOTHER PORTION OF THE SHOW
AND HOW HE TOOK A PLEA DEAL ON A
SMALL CHARGE, MEANING HE'S GOING
TO GIVE OVER WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON
OTHER PEOPLE TO INVESTIGATOR
ROBERT MUELLER, THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL, OTHERWISE HE WOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN THAT PLEA DEAL.
SO
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
CONSEQUENCES FOR DONALD TRUMP,
AND THERE'S SEVERAL LAYERS TO
THIS.
NUMBER ONE, SOME IN THE
PRESS BEFORE TODAY WERE
SPECULATING THAT, WELL, MAYBE
THE INVESTIGATION WILL LEAD UP
TO MANAFORT AND FLYNN AND THAT'S
IT.
NOW, WE ARE DONE WITH THAT,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS
COMICAL -- WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT GETTING FLYNN?
AND IF IT
TURNS OUT THAT ALL MUELLER HAD
WAS FLYNN LYING ABOUT HIS
CONTACTS WITH THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR, OKAY, MAYBE HE DOES
SOME PRISON TIME AND WE ARE DONE
WITH THAT, THEN IT TURNS OUT
TRUMP WAS NOT GUILTY IF THAT'S
ALL THEY COULD GET.
BUT NOW THAT
MUELLER HAS GIVEN HIM A PLEA
DEAL, THAT MEANS FLYNN HAS
SOMETHING ON SOMEONE HIGHER UP,
OTHERWISE THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE
LET HIM GO WHEN HE WAS FACING AT
LEAST 60 YEARS IN PRISON ON
OTHER CHARGES THAT THEY DIDN'T
CHARGE HIM WITH.
SO THAT ERNEST
CONVERSATION SOME IN THE MEDIA
HAD ABOUT MAYBE IT'S JUST FLYNN
AND NOT TRUMP, WE ARE DONE WITH
THAT.
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THEY
WILL DEFINITELY GET TRUMP, IT'S
TO SAY THEY ARE GOING FOR PEOPLE
HIGHER THAN FLYNN.
AND FLYNN WAS
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THERE
WEREN'T MANY PEOPLE HIGHER THAN
HIM.
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS KUSHNER,
MAYBE PENCE, BUT HE LIED TO
PENCE, THEN THERE IS TRUMP.
>>KUSHNER SORT OF TECHNICALLY,
THERE IS A STRAIGHT LINE FROM
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO THE
PRESIDENT.
>>IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS
THE SON-IN-LAW IS NOT IN THAT
LINE, IT'S ABSURD THAT WE ARE IN
THIS CONVERSATION BUT WE LIVE IN
ABSURD TIMES.
THE OTHER THINGS
RELATE TO DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT
WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR
QUITE SOME TIME, ONE IS
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS.
THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF
COLLUSION, IT COULD HAVE BEEN AS
FLYNN HAS BASICALLY ALREADY
ADMITTED TO IN THEIR TRANSITION,
AFTER THE CAMPAIGN, BUT BEFORE
THE ADMINISTRATION BEGINS, IN
THAT INTERREGNUM, IF YOU WILL,
HE TALKED TO THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR, APPARENTLY A LOT OF
PEOPLE THERE, JEFF SESSIONS, A
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE PART OF
TRUMP'S TEAM, AND THAT COLLUSION
BEFORE THEY TAKE OFFICE.
THAT IS
THE SMALLEST POSSIBILITY.
THE
OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT THEY
COLLUDED WITH RUSSIANS DURING
THE CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS A BIG
DEAL AND WOULD BE A MUCH HEAVIER
CHARGE.
WHAT WOULD BE THE WORST
IS IF THEY ARE CONTINUING TO
COLLUDE WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING
THE ADMINISTRATION, WHEN HE IS
PRESIDENT.
WHAT WOULD BE A
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS
ALONG THOSE LINES?
WELL, WE
WON'T DO THE SANCTIONS, YOU
HELPED US WITH THE ELECTION,
THAT IS ONE POSSIBILITY, THANK
YOU FOR THAT, FOR MAKING ME
PRESIDENT, SO I WON'T ENFORCE
THE SANCTIONS.
TRUMP HAD TO SIGN
FURTHER SANCTIONS INTO PLACE AND
KEEP THE OLD SANCTIONS BECAUSE
THE SENATE VOTED 98-2 IN FAVOR
OF THOSE SANCTIONS, SO HE KNEW
THAT EVEN IF HE VETOED IT IT
WOULD BE OVERWRITTEN.
BUT SINCE
HE HAS SIGNED IT HE HASN'T
ENFORCED IT, THE SANCTIONS ARE
NOT BEING ENFORCED ON RUSSIA.
SO
THAT IS YOUR DEAL, THAT IS YOUR
COLLUSION.
SO THAT'S A
POSSIBILITY.
THE SECOND LAYER IS
OBJECTION.
HE KNOWS THAT FLYNN
HAS SOME MATERIAL ON HIM, HE
TELLS COMEY TO DROP THE
INVESTIGATION ON FLYNN AFTER HE
TELLS EVERONE ELSE TO GET OUT OF
THE ROOM, THAT HE TOLD LESTER
HOLT ON NATIONAL TV THAT HE
FIRED COMEY BECAUSE OF THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THAT
COMEY, HEAD OF THE FBI, WAS
DOING, THAT ALSO OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.
AND NOW THAT FLYNN IS
COOPERATING WITH THE AUTHORITIES
THAN HE CAN TELL THEM YES, TRUMP
WAS SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS,
INCLUDING TELLING ME TO WAIT FOR
IMMUNITY, BECAUSE THIS IS THE
INFORMATION I HAD ON HIM THAT HE
DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT, THAT
ALLOWS MUELLER YOU WERE TRYING
TO BLOCK THAT INFORMATION,
THAT'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE --
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH.
THE
COLLUSION, IF IT'S IN THE
INTERREGNUM, PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH
TO GET TRUMP OUT.
COLLUSION
WHILE HE'S PRESIDENT, DEFINITELY
ENOUGH TO GET HIM OUT.
IF YOU
CAN PROVE IT.
DURING THE
CAMPAIGN, I GOT THAT AT 50-50, I
KNOW EVERY DEMOCRAT AND EVERYONE
AT MSNBC AND EVERYONE ON TV
THINKS IF HE DID COLLUSION WITH
THE RUSSIANS TRY TO GET
HILLARY'S EMAILS HE WILL BE
IMPEACHED, I'M NOT CONVINCED OF
THAT, I THINK THAT'S 50-50.
THAT
IS WHAT THEY THINK IS THE
END-ALL, BE-ALL.
I THINK THAT'S
THE SMALLEST THING HE DID,
POTENTIALLY, IN THIS ENTIRE
AFFAIR.
OBSTRUCTION IS A CLEAR,
CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE LAW.
>>THAT IS WHAT NIXON WAS GOING
DOWN FOR.
>>THAT'S RIGHT, NIXON WAS GOING
TO BE IMPEACHED, AND THAT'S WHY
HE RESIGNED.
BUT THERE'S A
FOURTH LAYER NO ONE IS TALKING
ABOUT, THAT WE TALK ABOUT ON THE
SHOW ALL THE TIME.
THE FOURTH
LAYER IS THE REASON HE'S NOT
DOING THE SANCTIONS IS THAT
TRUMP HAS HAD A DEAL WITH THE
RUSSIANS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW -- IF WE ARE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT, AND IN OUR
THEORY IT'S A FINANCIAL DEAL --
I'VE GOT DOZENS OF PIECES OF
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE I'VE
TALKED ABOUT FOR MONTHS, THEY
ARE ALL OUT OF THE OPEN, BUT
WHAT YOU NEED IS A SMOKING GUN.
SOMEONE THAT KNOWS ABOUT THAT
DEAL TO TALK ABOUT IT TO
MUELLER, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,
ETC. IS FLYNN THAT GUY?
WE DON'T
KNOW.
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE IF
THAT DEAL EVEN EXISTS, OR IF IT
DOES IF FLYNN KNOWS ABOUT IT.
BUT IF FLYNN KNOWS ABOUT IT, IT
DOESN'T APPEAR PAPADOPOULOS DOES
-- OR IF MANAFORT KNOWS ABOUT IT
AND HE FLIPS BECAUSE FLYNN
FLIPPED, OH BOY.
NOT ONLY IS
THAT HE'S DEFINITELY GONE, IF
THEY WANTED TO PURSUE IT, IT'S
PRETTY MUCH TREASON.
THEY COULD
PUT HIM IN PRISON.
THEY PROBABLY
WON'T, IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING FOR
THE COUNTRY, THEY WILL CLAIM HE
HAS ALZHEIMER'S, HE'LL RESIGNED
IMMEDIATELY.
>>THERE IS EVIDENCE TO THAT.
>>THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR
THAT.
BUT THAT IS THE MOTHER
LODE.
>>FOR ME THE POSSIBLE FINANCIAL
DEALS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
YOU ARE RIGHT, THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
ABOUT THAT IN THE MEDIA,
PARTICULARLY THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA, AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
OR NOT THAT IS ANY PART OF
MUELLER'S FOCUS.
I WOULD HOPE
THAT IT IS.
BECAUSE HERE IS THE
THING -- IF COLLUSION IS PROVEN,
WHY WOULD RUSSIA CARE SO DEEPLY
ABOUT GETTING TRUMP ELECTED?
NOW, IT COULD BE ABOUT THE
SANCTIONS, BUT IT COULD ALSO BE
ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT RUSSIA
WANTS, OTHER FAVORS RUSSIA
WANTS, AND ALSO WHY WOULD TRUMP
RISK EVERYTHING TO DO THAT?
WHY
IS HE SO FRIENDLY FOR THE
RUSSIANS?
WHY DOES HE HAVE A
SOFT SPOT FOR PUTIN?
>>WHEN HE DOESN'T HAVE A SOFT
SPOT FOR ANYONE ELSE APPARENTLY.
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT IS CLEAR,
THE SANCTIONS ARE COSTING THEM
TRILLION DOLLARS, THERE IS A
$500 BILLION DEAL WITH EXXON
MOBIL, OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON
IN THEIR MINDS BLOCKED IT, OBAMA
DEFINITELY DID -- I GET WHY THEY
WANT TO OPPOSE THE DEMOCRATS AND
HILLARY CLINTON, I GET WHAT THE
RUSSIANS WANT, THEY WANT THE
SANCTIONS LIFTED.
THE QUESTION
IS, WHY DOES TRUMP CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT?
OKAY, THE FRENCH WANT THAT,
THE COLOMBIANS WANT THAT, BUT
WHY DOES TRUMP CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT?
HE
MADE THE DECISION TO BRING ALL
THESE GUYS ONTO HIS CAMPAIGN
EARLY ON, MANAFORT, ETC., BEFORE
ANY OF THE SO-CALLED COLLUSION
ABOUT HILLARY'S EMAILS, ETC.
WHY
STACK YOUR TEAM FULL OF RUSSIAN
ALLIES IN THE FIRST PLACE?
AND
TO US WHAT IS A LOGICAL ANSWER,
BUT AGAIN THE AUTHORITIES WILL
HAVE TO SEE, AND I HOPE THEY ARE
LOOKING INTO IT, IS THAT HE
ALREADY OWED THE RUSSIANS, AND
THAT'S WHY THE RUSSIANS THOUGHT
NOT ONLY DO WE GET TO KNOCKDOWN
HILLARY CLINTON, WE GET A GUY
WHO IS IN OUR BACK POCKET TO
BECOME PRESIDENT TO LIFT THE
SANCTIONS.
>>ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL
DOCUMENTS, AND THIS ISN'T A
FLYNN THING, ALTHOUGH I THINK
FLYNN IS WELL-PLACED TO GIVE
INFORMATION ON LONG-STANDING
DEALS WITH RUSSIA -- BUT THE
THING THAT MUELLER NEEDS IS THE
TAX RETURNS.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE
CAN GET THEM, I ASSUME HE CAN --
THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT.
>>I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE
TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THAT'S YET
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP NOT
BEING FORTHCOMING AND I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY, BECAUSE HE IS
THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL WHO LOVES
TO FLAUNT HOW WEALTHY HE IS.
MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO RELEASE
THE TAX RETURNS BECAUSE HE'S NOT
AS WEALTHY AS HE SAYS, THAT
WOULD EMBARRASS HIM, BUT THERE'S
ALSO THE ISSUE OF HIM GOING
BANKRUPT IN THE UNITED STATES SO
MANY TIMES THAT LENDERS IN THE
U.S., BANKS IN THE U.S., REFUSED
TO LEND HIM MORE MONEY SO HE HAD
TO GO TO OTHER BANKS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO GET THE
LOANS NECESSARY TO BUILD HIS
DEVELOPMENTS AND CONTINUE WITH
HIS BUSINESS.
HOW MANY OF THOSE
LOANS CAME FROM RUSSIA?
HOW MUCH
DOES HE OWE RUSSIA?
IS THAT
PLAYING A ROLE IN POSSIBLE
COLLUSION?
ALL OF THOSE THINGS I
THINK ARE RELEVANT AND I HOPE
THERE IS MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON
THAT IN MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION,
WE KNOW THERE IS NO EMPHASIS ON
THAT IN THE MEDIA BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT BEING
INVESTIGATED.
>>I FEEL LIKE THERE WASN'T AS
MUCH NEWS IN PAST YEARS.
SOMETIMES YOU HAD TO REMIND
YOURSELF OF WHAT HAS COME
BEFORE, BECAUSE SO QUICKLY,
LIKE, JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
TAKE DOWN TRUMP WE FORGET IT
HAPPENED.
SOME THINGS FEEL SO
SIGNIFICANT AND WE JUST HAVE
SORT OF PASSED BY THEM.
THIS
CAME UP AGAIN, BUT ON THE
QUESTION OF POSSIBLE COLLUSION,
DONALD TRUMP, JR.
RESPONDED TO
AN EMAIL ABOUT THE RUSSIANS'
ATTEMPTS TO GET HIS FATHER
ELECTED AND HE SAID I LOVE IT,
ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE SUMMER.
FINE, FORGET THE COLLUSION THING
-- ON THE OBSTRUCTION THING, I
FOUND EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE, I DID SOME RESEARCH, I
FOUND A VIDEO, AND THIS LOW
LEVEL TRUMP EMPLOYEE CALLED
DONALD TRUMP TOLD LESTER HOLT I
WAS THINKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA
THING SO I FIRED THE FBI
DIRECTOR.
THAT IS OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.
HE SAID HE IS
INVESTIGATING RUSSIA, I DON'T
LIKE IT, SO I FIRED HIM.
HE'S
INVESTIGATING MY ALLIES, I DON'T
LIKE IT, SO FIRED HIM.
HE SAID
HE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.
>>HE SAID HE IS INVESTIGATING
MY DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA.
>>WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
>>MUELLER IS CAREFUL, HE IS
TRYING TO BUTTON UP THIS
INVESTIGATION.
I MENTIONED
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, I KNOW
THERE ARE 12 THINGS, LET ME LIST
YOU A QUICK COUPLE OF THINGS IF
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM.
NO
AMERICAN BANK WOULD LEND TRUMP
MONEY ANYMORE, HE HAD GONE BACK
UP SIX TIMES, SO HE BORROWED
MONEY FROM DEUTSCHE BANK, THEY
HAD HIS MONEY IN THE SAME
PORTION THAT WAS INFORMALLY
CALLED THE GLOBAL LAUNDROMAT, IN
THE SAME SECTION WITH RUSSIAN
OLIGARCHS.
THE RUSSIAN ALL THE
DARKS BUT A HUGE SECTION OF
TRUMP TOWER TO KEEP HIM AFLOAT,
THEN HE DOES A COUPLE REAL
ESTATE DEALS WHERE HE FLIPS
PROPERTIES FOR HUGE SUMS, ALL
INVOLVING THE RUSSIANS, WHICH
SOUNDS LIKE MONEY LAUNDERING.
BY
THE WAY, MUELLER BROUGHT A MONEY
LAUNDERING EXPERT ONTO HIS TEAM.
THEN THERE IS HIS SERVER IN
PENNSYLVANIA, TRUMP HAS A RANDOM
SERVER IN PENNSYLVANIA, INTERNET
EXPERTS SAY THIS IS WEIRD, HE
KEEPS GETTING PINGED -- AND IT
TURNS OUT 80% OF THE PINGS ON
TRUMP'S SERVER ARE COMING FROM
ALPHA BANK IN RUSSIA.
BY THE
WAY, 18% OF THE REST OF THE
PINGS WERE COMING FROM THE
DEVOS FAMILY, WHICH WOUND UP
GETTING A CABINET POSITION.
AND
BETSY DEVOS'S BROTHER GOES AND
HAS A MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS
AFTER THE ELECTION.
THERE ARE NO
COINCIDENCES THAT LARGE.
I DON'T
KNOW IF MUELLER WILL REVEAL THAT
LARGER PART OF THE FINANCIAL
DEAL HE HAS WITH RUSSIA, BUT I
THINK THAT IS WHY TRUMP IS SO
PANICKED.
YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE
PANICKED ABOUT THE OTHER
CHARGES?
YOU COLLUDED WITH THE
RUSSIANS TO GET HILLARY' IS
EMAILS.
BIG DEAL.
DON'T LOOK AT
THE BANK ACCOUNTS, I WON'T GIVE
YOU MY TAX RETURNS!
HE DID IT,
WHETHER MUELLER FINDS OUT IS THE
BIG MYSTERY, AND THAT WOULD BE
SPECTACULAR.
BECAUSE IF HE DID
THE CRIME THAT LARGE AND
PROMISED THE RUSSIANS THAT HE
WOULD LIFT THE SANCTIONS, CHANGE
U.S. POLICY, OR NOT ENFORCE THE
SANCTIONS, CHANGE U.S. POLICY
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN FINANCIAL
DEAL WITH THE RUSSIANS?
OH, LOCK
HIM UP, LOCK HIM UP.
THAT WOULD
BE ONE OF THE GREATEST SCANDALS
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
AND IF
THERE'S ANY JUSTICE AT ALL HE
WOULD LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE IN
HANDCUFFS.
