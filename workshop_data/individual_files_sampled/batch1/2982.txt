you are graduating at a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason just log on just log on to social media for 10 seconds it will hit you right in the face people denying science concocting elaborate hurtful conspiracy theories about child abuse rings operating out of pizza parlors drumming up rampant fear about undocumented immigrants Muslims minorities the poor turning neighbor against neighbor and sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity some are even denying things we see with our own eyes like the size of crowds and then defending themselves by talking about quote-unquote alternative facts but this is serious business look at the budget that was just proposed in Washington it is an attack of unimaginable cruelty I'm the most vulnerable among us the youngest the oldest the poorest and hard-working people who need a little help to gain or hang on to a decent middle-class life it grossly under funds public education mental health and efforts even to combat the opioid epidemic and in reversing our commitment to fight climate change it puts the future of our nation and our world at risk
