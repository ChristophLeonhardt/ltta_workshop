1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:06,140
On August 9, 2018 -- These young boys boarded
a school bus for what was meant to be a daylong

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,590
field trip filled with excitement.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,320
But that day of fun, soon turned into a day
of horror and tragedy.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,560
A Saudi Arabian-led military coalition reportedly
dropped a 500 pound laser guided bomb on the

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,829
bus, killing at least 40 children, 11 bystanders
and injuring about 79 other people.

6
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,560
The horrific images that emerged from the
scene of the attack not only drew the world’s

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,370
attention to this tragedy, but also to the
international partnerships that are supporting

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,230
Saudi Arabia’s relentless bombardment of
its neighbor to the south.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,760
Especially after subsequent reporting revealed
that the bomb used in the attack might have

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,309
been supplied by the United States.

11
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,079
I’m Judah with NowThis World, and in this
episode we’re going to look into this horrific

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,579
attack and the role that the U.S. continues
to play in Yemen.

13
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,079
The conflict in the country has created what
the United Nations has called “the worst

14
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,409
humanitarian crisis” in the world today.

15
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,719
“We are here, afraid in Yemen.

16
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,609
They are targeting bridges.

17
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,290
They are targeting schools.

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,180
They are targeting roads.”

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,090
Conservative estimates say that this war has
resulted in death of at least 5,000 civilians,

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,140
created a famine in the country that has claimed
the lives of about 50,000 people, pushed 8.4

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,700
million Yemenis to the brink of starvation.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,050
It also sparked a cholera epidemic that has
affected more than 1 million people.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,040
And the United States has supported this Saudi
Arabian-led military campaign since March

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,590
2015.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,990
This recent conflict began with Yemen’s
civil war, which launched out of the instability

26
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,100
that followed a popular uprising in 2011.

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,970
That uprising, eventually led to the removal
of Yemen’s longserving authoritarian leader,

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,450
Ali Abdullah saleh.

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,380
He eventually ceded power, handing over the
presidency to his deputy, Abd-Raabu Mansour

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,550
Hadi.

31
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,390
But he was never able to fully assert his
authority in the divided country, that was

32
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,590
dealing with an armed rebellion by a Shiite,
Iranian-backed group called the Houthis.

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,780
By September 2014, that group gained control
of large parts of Yemen, including its capital

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Sana’a.

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,130
And by March of 2015, Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia,
where he’s been ever since.

36
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,320
And that is when the war got worse.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,070
A Saudi Arabian and United Arab Emirate-led
military coalition began an airstrike campaign

38
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,660
against Houthi targets in the country.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,970
Enter the United States, and other western
powers.

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,920
The U.S. sells weapons to Saudi Arabia, provides
logistical support in the war, and even refuels

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,440
Coalition fighter jets during flight.

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,300
To put it all very simply; The Saudi Coalition
is dropping American-made bombs from planes

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,510
refueled by American soldiers, which kill
innocent civilians, including children.

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,870
And while this might come as a surprise for
some, it shouldn’t.

45
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,420
That’s because globally, the U.S. exports
more than a third of all major weapons -

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,730
and the biggest beneficiary?

47
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,700
You guessed it: Saudi Arabia.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,930
The U.S. supplies more than 60% of Saudi Arabia’s
arms imports – billions of dollars worth

49
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,510
of weapons including cluster bombs and anti-tank
missiles, as well as armored vehicles, tanks,

50
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,319
attack aircrafts, and other equipment.

51
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,370
Experts say that though sales of equipment
is easy to track, the Pentagon doesn’t publish

52
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,380
when the arms have been delivered or how they’ve
been used.

53
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,530
They’ve also claimed numerous times that
U.S. officials don’t track or investigate

54
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,410
airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition.

55
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,340
But, in recent months, exclusive reporting
from outlets like the Intercept and New York

56
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,569
Times have challenged that, indicating that
officials may know more than they say they

57
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,459
do, and may be more directly involved in Yemen
than they say they are.

58
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,970
Some of these weapons are reported to have
ended up in the hands of ISIS and al-Qaeda

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,100
militants.

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,050
To complicate things even further, according
to recent AP reports, the U.S. has conflicting

61
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,260
interests on the Peninsula, which include
both counterterrorism efforts to eliminate

62
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,510
al-Qaeda, and simultaneously driving out the
Houthis – a fight al-Qaeda has joined.

63
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,150
U.S. weapons support ramped up under the Obama
administration, under which, according to

64
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,220
the Center for International Policy calculations,
more than $115 billion in military sales were

65
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,590
offered to Saudi Arabia from 2009 to 2016.

66
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,329
Support for Saudi and the UAE further expanded
under the Trump administration, with the state

67
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,059
department approving billions of dollars in
arms sales.

68
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:24,439
President Trump has also met with Saudi King
Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman

69
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,050
on several occasions.

70
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,009
His first overseas trip as president, in fact,
was to Riyadh.

71
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:34,199
The Trump administration has argued that selling
precision-guided munitions could result in

72
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,759
fewer civilian deaths, because the targeting
is more precise.

73
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,180
But experts we’ve spoken to say that’s
not the case.

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,979
“All that argument about helping them be
more careful is nonsense.

75
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:50,479
And we’ve seen this by the increase in civilian
casualties and the kinds of targets like school

76
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,020
busses and weddings and so forth that have
been hit.

77
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,099
From my point of view when you’re hitting
those kinds of civilian targets repeatedly,

78
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,740
to me that looks like a war crime.”

79
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,589
So what actions, if any, are U.S. lawmakers
taking?

80
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:07,749
Senator Elizabeth Warren recently wrote a
letter to the U.S. Central Command asking

81
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:12,460
for answers about an intelligence report uncovered
by The Intercept that appears to contradict

82
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,949
the Pentagon’s reported lack of involvement
in the Saudi-led airstrikes.

83
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:21,740
“I think the Pentagon is well aware that
U.S. bombs are being used to hit civilian

84
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
targets.

85
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,969
This fiction that they’re putting forward
that ‘we don’t even track those things,’

86
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:26,969
first of all is unconscionable.

87
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:30,849
I mean, if you're selling the weapons, you
should try to track how they’re used.

88
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:35,440
Second of all, as Senator Warren suggests,
doesn’t square with the truth.”

89
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,939
Earlier, in March 2018, a group of Senators
led a bipartisan effort to pass a resolution

90
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,841
ending U.S. involvement in the war.

91
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:48,420
The resolution was tabled, but it wasn’t
the first time members of Congress tried to

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,229
pass legislation to get out of Yemen, and
it certainly won’t be the last.

93
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:59,819
“So the responsibility is clearly on our
shoulders, the shoulders of our companies,

94
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,039
our government.

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,600
And the citizens of the United States have
a responsibility to push their government

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:00:00,000
to stop enabling these kinds of crimes."
