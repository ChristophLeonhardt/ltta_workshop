as from Levant and you're watching battleground hey everybody welcome back to the rebel I'm the rebel commander just back from the UK where I have been for the better part of a week I have been attending at courts with Tommy Robinson as the Court of Appeal issued their scorching repudiation of the court in Leeds that had inappropriately and illegally tried sentenced and convicted and sent them off to prison in a matter of hours I don't know if you've watched any of my stories from the ground in London you can find them all at Tommy Trial calm but I mean I've been reading legal cases for more than 20 years I guess it's been 22 years since I graduated from law school I don't know how I have I read a thousand cases I can't recall a Court of Appeal being more scorching in their overturning of a lower court case in fact I can't think of anything that the judge in Leeds did that was right the charges against Tommy were inappropriately put they were not put in writing as is required by the Criminal Procedure rules in the UK the immediate hearing rather than letting things cool off was specifically mentioned by the Court of Appeal as inappropriate the fact that Tommy was sentenced as a criminal rather than as civil a civil contempt was pointed out by the judge the obviously disproportionate sentence I cannot think of a single way in which what was done to Tommy was appropriate again Tommy would use the language stitch-up Court of Appeal uses fancier phrasing but it's the same thing Before we jump in we got a lot of stuff to talk about Tommy the name I just want to give you a reminder of what we do on these super chats what they are this is live I'm coming to you live it's 12 noon in Toronto 5 p.m. in the UK and as you can see to the right of the screen comments are ticking by all the time we've got about 500 people watching now out of the corner of my eye I notice if a comment is put in bright high lighting that's called a super jet that's something that Google YouTube invented it highlights it in fact I saw one go by already as first a regulars Thank You Ezra for supporting Tommy from the start well you're welcome and Tommy's obviously most welcome in this beautiful family so what a super chat does is just like that when it puts it in a bright color so I can spot it out of the corner of my eye it costs a few bucks or a few pounds but the good news is Google actually shares that money with us and most of our videos are d monetized by Google so this is a small way to supplement what we our revenues so I'm going to give you a report some thoughts upon my return to Canada after half a week in the UK but first let me show you a moment I was sort of I don't know it's a I let it speak for itself here's the moment where I saw Tommy he had just got out of prison by the way before we show this clip the results for Tommy was announced at about 11 a.m. Tommy was not advised of this right away he was not he did not join the court by video connection I don't know why that is and he was not advised that he won until some prisoner ran by his cell saying you're going home bruv can you imagine that so was that gossip was that just someone taunting him or teasing him well indeed he was let out that day bruv but it took him hours to be let out of prison why just grab his bag he doesn't have a lot of stuff open the cell have him sign up few papers be on his way but half an hour max why did it take hours do you know why it took hours I'll tell you why it took hours because Tommy is in one of the most densely Muslim prisons in the United Kingdom dominated by Muslim gangs his cell was actually just outside the cell was the mosque the prison mosque five halal meals a day the prison how long prison it's run by the tenants of Islam people who go in the prison to be protected from gangs they joined the Muslim gang but it's not just yeah I'm a Crip now I'm a blood you have to convert to Islam so a lot of people convert to Islam imprisoned not just for the ideology for the loss of philosophy but to stay alive and of course they knew that Tommy was in the prison everyone knew him and he was subject to constant threats so to extricate him from his cell where he had been caged like a like an animal for two months and just to walk him out the first time he was allowed out in such a manner they had to lock down the entire prison do you understand I'm saying every single prisoner in HMP only had to be sent back to their cells locked and accounted for before Tommy could go home to his family think about that the entire prison is basically a Muslim prison the mosque is the center of the prison politically philosophically criminally whatever and so to get Tommy out they had to lock the whole place down as if it was on riot because of course he would have been murdered and he was repeatedly told in prison he would be murdered he was actually told that his wife would be the subject of an acid attack and they spoke her first her full first and last name to him just to make it seem more menacing and more planned that's why it took hours to get Tommy out I see some super chats are coming by let me quickly read them and then I'm gonna show you the clip of when I saw Tommy but about two hours after he got home the first super chat Joe will f -ing ten dollars thanks very much true if you have a comment or a question feel free to make it super Chad isn't just about the dough but thanks for that you can append a comment or a question to it and I'll read that Jonathan brian says glad to have Tommy freed from prison yeah me too Ronnie big says have you seen the difference between how ahead to me me and Tommy Robinson were treated yes I have seen that and I will refer to that a little bit later Kevin Wilkinson says you have been an amazing answer during this whole disgraceful ordeal Tommy left you last year to go on his own but you are a true hero in what you've done thank you a true friend for freedom well thanks very much for that Laura Cooper says thank you for all your help with Tommy and getting him home to his family our country's gone to pot well I've got a lot to say about this thing but I want to show you the moment where I first saw Todd I hadn't seen Tommy since what February March I forget when he left us and you know we left on good enough terms I mean but it's like a breakup right the boyfriend or a girlfriend or whatever I mean even if it's amicable it's still a breakup right I mean we had some e-mails back and forth and there was nothing hostile but when you break up with someone you break it up so I actually hadn't seen Tommy face-to-face I mean I had some emails and text with him or whatever but I had not actually seen him face to face in what like five months take a look at when I first saw Tommy he had just he had got a haircut he in a shower he put on some clothes he met his lovely wife and his three beautiful kids and then he said as where I I'll come over to say hi I just want to show you that it is I didn't know I mean I was I didn't want to be too much but I wanted to show him how I felt that he was the same way take a look do you've audio guys we do that again with audio we're gonna do that again with audio maybe we can get Hannah in here to do that I want to show you that let me go back to some super chats while we get that ready with the audio foxy below said Ezra for a night but yeah what's the likelihood of that name it's about as likely as Tommy being appointed to the House of Lords I think Adele Rogers nine pounds nine and I thank you very much for that feel free to ask a question or a comment along with your super champ let me know when we're ready with that video with audio guys no attempt to jail visits dog backwards that's no attempted jail visits that's a very good point obviously I wanted to meet Tommy right away in jail even before I was doing crowdfunding with him because of course his first legal approach was not even to appeal and I wanted to talk to him directly and said Tommy that's crazy we got to appeal that did not but I couldn't get in because he was only in his entire term there I think he only had two meetings with his wife and two meetings with his lawyers so he was in prison for what ten weeks and he was only permitted for meetings in his entire time so obviously I wasn't going to take up one of those slots can you imagine that just shocking and his phone calls were very limited and he had to pay for them let me know when we're ready with the audio guys stampy bear answer thank you for your hard work and professionalism god bless and protect all those seeking the truth Thank You Diane Oliver Ezra do you know why his case wasn't quashed on Wednesday yes it was quashed on Wednesday the conviction that a first result in Leeds was thrown out but the underlying matter that called him into court because the first trial was so faulty instead of throwing the whole thing away that the court has decided to have a rehearing now I personally think that's quite abusive why would they put Tommy through anything more again I mean for God's sakes the man's been through enough and they want to have another hearing on that so yes it's the conviction was quashed but the whole matter remains alive in that Tommy must return to the old bailey now for another hearing and I talked a little bit with Tommy's lawyers and about Tommy for that I'm just going to quickly blow through some more not blow through I'm going to read respectfully and with gratitude some more of these super chats and then I'm going to properly play for you with audio the video of me greeting Tommy Neil Nigel esra legend thanks very much Arthur Stephens when I watched Tommy's reaction to you after his release I thought I'm going to send enough to buy a pint well that's nice of you Jacqueline Han great work as for appreciate all what you're doing well thank you coold being god bless Ezra Tommy and your families greetings from Australia well thank you very much I know he's got a lot of Tommy supporters here Keith McIntosh practive contributed campaign a few questions what percent were Canadians responsible for and Americans and Aussies and have his legal fees today being covered or is more required thank you that's a very good question I would say I mean I haven't done a proper study of where the funds came from I think about 35 to 40 percent of the funds came from the UK about the same percentage came from Canada and then maybe 20 percent came from the rest of the world and obviously Tommy is well known in Canada in the UK obviously our rebel superfans are based in Canada so that's why Canada was heavy but yeah US and Australia would be would be strong third and fourth I should tell you that yes I mean in fact on Tuesday I am proud to say we paid the last of Tommy's legal bills and so we have shut down the account that saved Tommy calm because he's out and his legal bills are paid now that's not to say we won't engage again for the rehearing I talked to Tommy a little bit about that yesterday I'll give you a little more info about that later on but we are not now collecting money for Thomas legal bills because they're paid off and it was a great feeling to pay those off I think it was on Tuesday we pay the last one and then on Wednesday to have the result it was very very good I'm very pleased with that British man 5 pounds your alleged and Ezra that's very nice of you Gabriel sir Thank You Ezra for helping Tommy it was a pleasure it was a duty I felt I felt we had the skills and the knowledge to do so alright I think we're ready I want to show you the moment when I saw Tommy for the first time in March April May June July was like five if I hadn't seen him in five months I talked to his family of course a fair bit and we fought hard in the court of public opinion and in the court of law and here's when I finally had again I just said yeah obviously Thank You Norris a considerable rebels but me my state from the snow you know them in there and you thought I sprained my water it's not to be they messages and get me sit back before and I'm not but I knew you got the man's have money and now they want to go again tell me it touches my hair they say that and I'm getting a weird Gabri pretty closer in the last two months than they ever were before nine but the Khalid boy no no and I'm so happy to see you it looks like you had a crime in there looked like they weren't treating you like when you're here with it when they're not lay it all out it's just by fasting saying that they can get away around and we're not here movies no ears on here viruses I give you these people talking okay or completely appears in everything that can appear so that was when I met Tommy now we turned the camera off because we talked privately for a few minutes his beautiful wife and kids came in I talked to them a bit you know I had seen his family before when when I would go over there and I would bring the kids little little maple syrup things from Canada what would you bring a British kid I don't know I I got him some some little maple syrup so I was sort of dumb I don't know what's a Canadian thing but so I had seen them a before and his wife is so lovely I mean let's be honest Tommy doesn't deserve such a beautiful wife and beautiful kids but maybe in the karmic scheme of things it's God's reward to him there they're a perfect family they're just amazing and I was I mean I obviously didn't spend a lot of time with the wife and kids but it was nice to meet them in the home and I had to forget that his real name I had to remember his real name is Stephen so I would say Tommy this Tommy that and the kids are so who so I had to switch into saying Stephen because I mean Tommy is his nickname of course and boy his kids were taking it hard as kids were taking it hard and so to see the pure pure joy in the face of those kids and I know was especially hard on his son I mean obviously sons and dad's fathers and sons you know and tommy was a boxer and the time he was teaching his son in a box and they were close and this was so hard on him and to see the pure joy I have to tell you my eyes watered a bit and Jenna said are you crying and I said no I said no I'm not crying it's just a little dusty yeah anyway so that I turn off the camera for that cuz I didn't I didn't you know I didn't want to obviously show what the kids look like and so they were so excited to see their husband and and their dad and Tommy said well why don't you join us for for dinner and boy I wanted to boy I wanted to but I thought there's no bloody way that three hours after he's out of prison I'm going to inject myself into the family reunion dinner I wanted to I wanted to cheer him up I wanted to tell him things I wanted to learn things obviously I wanted to you know there was so many reasons but there's no bloody way I mean it was very nice for him to offer but there was no bloody way I was going to do that what I did say though is sit down with me for 10 minutes let's just talk for 10 minutes and then go with your family to dinner and then me and my cameraman got on the train and went back to London so I'm gonna read some more super chats and let me tell the team in the control room get ready with the 10 minute video with audio of my interview with Tommy I'm just gonna read a few super chats that I missed just an archer greetings from northern Indiana it seems like double jeopardy is entirely legal in the UK what a backwards legal system love your content Ezra I've been trying to make content and rebel help me become conservative very nice for you to say Justin yeah the UK it's not as free as the United States see 180 to OPR said when the loss when will the lawsuits begin let's hit the tops where it hurts the most their bank accounts ready to donate just tell me when and where well thank you I mean I had a I think I told you I had breakfast with Tommy yesterday so I I didn't go to his dinner on on Wednesday when he was free but when he had a good night's sleep his first good night's sleep in his own bed without people shouting at him screaming at him with air conditioning in two and a half months and a first proper meal we'll get into the meal thing in a bit and just knowing he was safe and at home and with his family so I I had breakfast with him and and actually his son came and one other person and he looked better already actually just being out and and we talked a bit cuz I don't I don't want I told Tommy I said I like being your buddy a lot more than I like being your boss and we had a chuckle about it because I mean Tom I don't want to be the nag you know when Tommy worked for us I was always saying don't do this don't do that best too dangerous that's get us in trouble that's no fun who wants to be the guy saying Tommy don't write it the fun is watching Tommy do outs can you call up a very short cliff clip of Tommy punching the migrant in Rome I've shown you this before you probably know this shorter the clip the better it's it's shortly after Tommy left us to go independent he went to Rome and he encountered a migrant on the street and he got into some banter and the migrants said I'll kill you and Tommy just clocked him remember that I woke a can we get it as with sound on tape please and there was a bit of banter and down he went play this b-roll we'll get the sounds if we need it so so you'll we got to get ready with the sound guys let's assume that if there's a clip that I want was sound well this is played as b-roll right now all right you know script yeah okay let's do you think you're gonna take mine you know what why don't we do this game with sound let's just okay let's just forget about that my point is that's fun to watch isn't it it saw me clocking some guy and Downey down he goes it's fun to watch as a viewer but as a can we get Hannah in the control room here but but as a boss that's no fun it's no fun to think okay now is Tommy going to be arrested do I have to get a lawyer in Rome at midnight to bail him out of jail or god forbid if Tommy would be stabbed or something do I have to find out where he is and get him health care and maybe get him back to the UK so for the first time when I watched that clip of Tommy clocking the migrant in Rome and down he goes like a sack of potatoes I can enjoy the violent spectacle as a spectator instead of as someone who has to say oh shoot now what mess are we in I don't want to get back into nagging with Tommy I don't want to get back into that role all right we're gonna figure out our our video challenges here let me read some more super chats in the meantime so to your point see 182 opr I'm sure there will be lawsuits I certainly hope there will be and we if there are I think we may have a role to play in that we I mean I'm a former lawyer myself so I understand a little bit about the law I understand Tommy's cases having been involved with him not only in this one but in the Canterbury case beforehand but I also now know a number of law firms in the United Kingdom and I think I just think because I come from the legal world myself I think I I can manage lawyers a bit that's something that I would do with Tommy that's not being Tommy's boss that's sort of quarterbacking some of the legal action that is something I would be interested in and Tommy and I had a brief chat about that obviously I don't want to get ahead of myself but in answer to your question if there are more things to do I think we at the rebel would choose certain projects to be involved with with Tommy if he wanted our help I mean maybe he doesn't you seemed he was grateful as you saw for what we did this time remember he's going back for a rehearing of this contempt case next month so when Tommy's back from vacation I'll talk to him I'll talk to his lawyers if he wants us to get involved with it I mean I don't need to fill the room anymore because Tommy himself is out so Tommy can call the shots on a lot of things I he couldn't do that when he was behind bars but I'm happy to to supplement in this it sees fit that's a long way of saying I'm interested in helping if it's help that we can truly make a difference crowdfunding is one of the things that we can make a difference providing some legal strategy or at least managing the lawyers or something we can make a difference obviously it's different now that Tommy is out he no longer needs like charity you know he's a businessman himself and he's got his own thing but we still believe in him enough that if we can make a difference we will it's different now though because he's not he's you know he's not incapacitated in prison all right well let's try one more time here with sound for the for the Rome clipped go ahead I guess not okay take it down I don't need it I don't need it okay that's fine Calvin flower says rebel meanies incredible freedoms voice thank you very much Venice case as I hope you've seen upfront the state of our MSM in the UK they help in the stitch up and now they will ramp it up thank you for coming over you know what I did about three interviews with the BBC and they were awful the BBC did not want to talk about Tommy's victory the Court of Appeal they wanted to talk about anything else they wanted to talk about Canterbury they wanted they were literally pulling up quotes that Tommy said seven years ago in 2011 one BBC presenter read to me some quote Tommy allegedly said in 2007 okay so you're quoting a guy 11 years ago I guess he was 2024 at the time because he would rather talk about literally anything else in the world than the fact that he had a resounding vindication at the Court of Appeal that absolutely thrashed his conviction I mean the BBC was a caricature of itself I did three BBC interviews in the same day and one of them said why's Tommy have such support and I said it's because unlike the rest of the media he's not afraid to talk about Muslim rape gangs and for the next 10 minutes the host said well there's there you can't call them muscle rankings there's no such thing as Muslim rankings and I say you've just sort of proved my point buddy I mean it was I've never seen the media that bad I mean Canadian media is awful American media is awful but in the UK it's other than an authoritarian regime I've never seen the media so uniform in their narrative and you know I just was reminded today that the independent that's when British newspaper its it just received a major investment from a Saudi owner so are you surprised that a Saudi controlled newspaper called the independent how ironic that they're bashing Tommy Robinson and the BBC why would the state broadcaster be any less anti Tommy than a court let's read some more super chats for as was first two regulars from the UK thanks to all who donated or protested that's true I concur v6 Tommy Robinson's experiences are thriller movie material yeah a little bit but you know two months in prison being starved and losing 40 pounds it's not thrilling I'm gonna call for the 10-minute video clip and fellas can we have sound thank you I hope your name kim al t says i hope your name goes down in history for leading this revolution thank you for your hard work and thank you to everyone who helped them donated I agree with you come on on with so many people so you're nice to credit me but of course there was hundreds and hundreds of people who together did it okay I think I've gotten through the super chats maybe my friends can email me any ones I've missed I am now going to play for you with sound a 10-minute conversation I had with Tommy at that restaurant so remember Tommy just came in we had a little hug and a handshake he said come to dinner I said no way we turned the camera off I kibbutz with his wife and kids bent I did not cry although my eyes may have watered and then Tommy and I sat down and I thought okay I got 10 minutes with him I'm just gonna ask him questions I'm gonna try and restrain myself from over talking because you know me I'm a chatterbox and I always got something to say so I should have probably listened more and talked less but but I just you know I genuinely wanted to say eff Asselin things to him so without further to do here's my ten minute talk with Tommy Robinson hours after he was out of prison take a look Tommy it's good to see you I'm very sad for what you've been through but I'm thrilled that you've been emancipated I feel like you've been freed in so many ways yeah I'm so happy there and I'm happy from I feel mean I am happy that I don't feel happy for card spreads so super happy that's four strains I thought you are abused I don't want to I don't want to be condescending but I think what they did she was a form of the physical and psychological abuse yeah so I haven't had a conversation to mouth munch I'm singing so other than one hour twice where I was I saw my wife and children even one hour only yeah and when it's murderers get more time than that and then I saw them it was a a warm you for that one huh it was a big thing too I don't know by the end of it it's not what pattern I'm is just I heard that in prison you had constant threats is that true so what's gonna not I face every day yeah right you know this heat that we've had here why couldn't have my cell windows open because they would be spat through or shit put through them unlike God and so I have my windows shot all the time and then at the same time is that I had just forum ever and then at the same time is that the police was in my mother and my wife to tell them that there's intelligence that's gonna be acid attacks on them no I don't know if you know how bad it is for me oh I don't even fit I don't believe their Intel I think all of this and the timing for all of it is so on so let's you can find and this is happening outside which I can't deal with but when I do get a chance to bring home I find out the police rep my house oh and my wife's crying and they're scared and is there really intel saying that and every everything they done do you know why they moved you to add more dangerous prison they moved me from HMT hole that suppose a seven percent Muslim population so you're the most densely Muslim populated prison in the Hunter they give you a reason no if they think they give nice they have no reason but then what they I know why they did it because what they then did is they use the excuse of more safety which don't when I got there they they put me straight on site so you can find him they locked me straight away which was twenty three and a half hours daily locked in a room and a flu map and then for five minutes day they open the cap they open the door and you walk into a cage this size small and you walk around the cage in your own and then they open the door locked back in like an animal yeah and the only do it and joy that you know if every prisoner had that if that was the sentence for prisoners it was the fact that you know every other prisoner cell door opens I eat up in the morning and they're out of their cell working having football playing for and then they get locked up for six o'clock or not and I think I haven't done anything baby what baku stay put and bought meat um muslim run prison they used the excuse that this is why they have to do that and how about the food so muslim prisoners were cooking your food is there right now had them to first date how was your dinner time so i didn't see much so most people who in prison you come out that way you're so thin did one eat the pony looked really worried worried they were gonna put those in yours every prisoner comes out you walk into a chat kitchen canteen and you see the person hand you dinner ya know pays prisoners yeah muslims yeah ah I didn't even get to see so that I could see what they've done to the food my dinner was brought to me on a plane and hand it to me at my door and who knows what were the hell then I've got them telling me how was your dinner tongue oh yeah and it's easy to get anything smoke and it's ants oh yeah so essentially but they nearly date them so then they the person knew this and I put in I've got a copy of everything I put in complaint off the complaint say that all you need to do because I could only spend 12 pound a week that's what finally brought me five tins of tuna so basically why they if you there's a tin of tuna a day and fruit that's just there as a form of torture yeah and you know what if they treat one ton will be prisoners better than you know I mean probably and asking for I plan on asking so I put in complaint saying I need I need extra money you start can buy food and they they wouldn't let you buy the move the in fact I think of people here the when you it's like and Joe what I hate I've seen him but there was something on on the TV some human rights expert Louie are a human rights were talking about why I should be in Jess either one and I'm sitting in jail thinking my Cuban wife so absolutely being abused right now and not one person which Amnesty International where's reporters without borders it's not waste anyway when they step back in it's like I know it's just something out you just got home you met your wife and your beautiful kids yeah and I and I'm I don't want to keep you away from them at all but I just wanted to get a message from you I was coming so uh with the first people in my scheduler I wanted to sue and I'm done the way Friday morning some that I'm so glad that you're still and look like the opportunity to segment and say I'm thank you I my wife thank you my children thank you and well it's a rebel viewers they're the ones I know yeah I know okay the most they love you because you did so much great work with us and we love that you're we respect your work as an independent guy it was our honor to help you my friend when I saw him taking away I thought we have one more mission with Tommy I know and yet every person wherever you are in the world who took the opportunity to even donate to the need we'll fund share the article share the news stories just you know the sort of get that get me so much tell me about the emails because and cuz we we spread the word a little bit about emails from you've done it you've done with James Denton public most recently how because you have some how many letters do you get in your two months inside oh I've got six black bags this big this wide were they encouraging oh man it's like you know some of the things to understand what I understood from this sentence is that something huge has happened not just our country but the whole world is feeling this one I'm not my course I've become a symbol of something that everyone is galvanized under and I'm realizing from the letters and letters and letters and read them and people who have never been politically minded people who have not been interested in politics people who feel so passionately and strongly about this MOOC what's happening now and the fact that they feel oppressed and I could tell in those first few weeks but over the months that something huge is something the massive block of revolution is brewing and people feel so angry and you know what I did is that as I've read the letters I've read the letter and on and on every day from two o'clock till 6 o'clock that was my time that I'd sit and read and that because I split my day up in today just to have those little moments yeah the door open to 12 o'clock that's a moment that's yeah so from there and and not separate their letters into new stories and into things and you know the understanding that these people have taken the time I know so many people's life stories that they're telling me the stories of their life people arriving sim different people from different countries rights being everyday I hear a woman she's one of the first people that when I get back on holiday I'm gonna go and visit I want to spend a week motion yeah yeah because young yeah it's been good chummy and you have a lot of fans out there more I think than you ever have before you also have people who are gunning for you I am furious to hear about what it was like in prison I'm furious we'll do whatever we can and just take a week with your family and don't even think about things they just couldn't Nate so so part of what I believe they're doing or what this has been about which is similar to happened in 2012 which this is a you used to mentally break me or believe and they still couldn't just accept okay the thing the gun was wrong and let me go it what they've done is they're gonna do it again yeah they're gonna take me back to walk again and they're gonna try and do all of this again well it's like a dark cloud always hanging over and it's like take a week take it take time with your family when you come back we can talk more privately about what we can do to help we want to help we don't I said I'm going to lead crab core and for the white reason you'd be said though you know you got because you would have wanted me did that be prisons but all the time I said yeah yeah Tommy I've said you're the last line here and I mean it and you've inspired me personally you've inspired thousands and millions of people and I just want to say one thing because I promised people I would yeah I just want to say because they're gunning for you so hard we all want you to be 10% more careful and because 90% Tommy it's still better than anyone else right and if and if a 90% Tommy like just not floor in it if that keeps you out of jail or I'd have been stabbed god forbid I've just had people wanted me to tell you that you know I felt I watched I sort of lift and watched I had a lot of time to reflect so I lift and watched and saw the probably you have a lot of people who love you people you'll never even know I spend time to watch to see the effect is heard of my family again I Stan forget a good thing I'm glad you're free someone connect with your family my facts minute ranks all right thank you every single I think you've ever meet you well there you have it you know I I'm looking back on that interview in it I don't think it was quite a interview interview was really that other than the brief section we cut out where I was saying hi to his wife and kids that was just me for the first time talking to him so I didn't just wanted to go straight into journalist mode I wanted to tell him some things and a lot of people and I had been thinking that I wanted just to have a message with him dial it back just 10% that was my nag I'm done nagging him there were some moments there where he was very emotional I felt like I wanted to jump into the conversation because I didn't want him to he was obviously still stressed in fact right at the beginning he almost had trouble conversing in an energetic way cuz think about it he was in a cage by himself for two months didn't talk to anyone other than to meetings with his family and to meetings with his lawyer in what was he in prison for for about 75 days he had four hours of conversation in 75 days and then he was shouted at by Muslim prisoners and prisoners threatening him spat upon starved I'm sorry that's called psychological torture as well as physical torture that's what starving a man is you know I know that in the UK they have an organization by Muslim terrorists called caged prisoners these are terrorists who released from Guantanamo Bay we have a Canadian named Omar Khadr who was detained at Guantanamo Bay and I know enough about Guantanamo Bay of not being there myself but I've seen that photos and video it's not a prison people at Guantanamo Bay have not been convicted of crimes they're just detained like a prisoner of war camp I mean in the Second World War for example we took tens of thousands of prisoners of Germans they were not you know we didn't have a prosecutor and have a trial you did they because they mostly if there was a war criminal they were prosecuted but just being in a foreign country's army it's not a crime you're just detained and kept off the field of battle till the end of war went on omo bay is that p o w camp like detention center for terrorists so Omar Khadr was sent to Guantanamo Bay he was later also charged with murder and convicted but his time at Guantanamo Bay was pleasant he put on and he put on a lot of weight the average Guantanamo Bay detainee puts on what about 20 pounds of weight they get about $100 a day worth of halal food and it's gourmet food and I'm not saying that as an exaggeration I've seen some of the specialty food requests they have there I mean 100 bucks a day worth of food it's it's all hollow they have soccer fields they have video games they have you know PlayStation Nintendo they have satellite TV they have movies it really is like a hotel they have the finest medical care around so compare that to Tommy Robinson's treatment Tommy Robinson was treated far worse than Muslim terrorists and I mentioned Omar Khadr because he's a Canadian case I've written a book about it called the enemy within terror lies in the white washing walmart caught it so I know his case fairly well and again he was in Guantanamo Bay he murdered a US Army medic named Christopher spear I know this because he confessed that he pled guilty to it he admitted he was convicted and sentenced but he was set out early of course and he came to Canada and he sued the Canadian government huh want anima base run by Americans why are you sue the Canadian government because apparently there were a couple nights where his sleep was interrupted he was kept up late interrogated by the US intelligence agencies about his terrorist knowledge that's what you did with terrorists you try and find out what you can from them to stop other terrorist attacks so apparently Canadian diplomats were aware of this and didn't intervene or something like he was obviously not in Canadian custody at one time obey but nonetheless he sued the Canadian government and the Canadian government settled with convicted confessed al-qaeda terrorist and murderer Homer Cotter for 10.5 million dollars and a public apology delivered to him by Justin Trudeau so compare these two men al-qaeda terrorists convicted and confessed murderer of a US Army medic Omar Connor who was sleep deprived a few nights hey any new moms and dads out there sleep deprived for what like a month in a row so that's not torture Syria kept up a couple nights Tommy Robinson not a terrorist thrown in prison for 13 months thankfully just bailed out solitary confinement starved 40 pounds later psychological torture kept in a cage for 444 what two two months in a week yeah I think Tommy Robinson has more justice coming to him than they see and received all right I was not paying attention to the super chance can I get some an email if I've missed any super chats fellas can you send me send me those I just want to make sure I read them out there is one more video I want to play and it's you're gonna laugh at me but can I just checked it have I missed any super chance no cabin missed any super chests sorry if I if I did miss yours I will come back to it folks try and bring it to my attention when I was over in the UK they're still talking about the brexit right just over two years ago a majority of Brits voted to get out of the European Union for reasons of sovereignty and patriotism but also because of open borders and it was a it was like a warning tremor of what would hit America later that year in Donald Trump's presidency for the last two years the British establishment has been trying to push back against brexit and invalidate it even though it was a democratic victory and they're still they're still going on about it they're still trying to deal agenda mais it just like there's in America they're trying to deal agenda mais trump of 600 days into his presidency but I came across a clip on the BBC which is the worst network it's you know it's a state broadcaster like Russia today is but it's not even as good as Russia today and the Russian today you know you're getting Vladimir Putin's for you of the world but at least it's exciting and fun and well done the BBC is so dreary look at you know you're getting the the elites point of view it's so awful some watch BBC and they have a guy on from the British sandwich Association now first of all if I was a Brit I would immediately join the British sandwiches Oh see a ssin because I love sandwiches I may have such interesting sandwiches over there they have like apple and cheese sandwiches you know they have all these things I can't even pronounce they're like chutney this and you know all that no no you know it's just British sandwiches so I would join the British salmon sociation and they would say you have to be a sandwich company sir so I would obviously incorporate because I really would want to be part of the British Salmons Association I'd love a membership card I'd like you know if I were single it's a Hey ladies you're looking at a VIP member of the British sandwich so she a ssin they look at me and they say yeah we could tell buddy anyways I'm joking around the fact that there is something called the British sandwich dissociation makes me laugh I actually googled that because I didn't believe it was real but here's their website the British sandwich and food to go Association member directory awards I would definitely win an award for sandwich eater of the year Members Only that's the spot that's the secret stuff sir I can't tell you my secret sandwich handshake events I would be at all the events I would just I would be like one of those Grateful Dead groupies just travelling around following the band all around the UK a man British sandwich the socio that's here crustless a cross on we're kind of say anyways I didn't believe there was something called British Sammis Association but I check them out and it's real because I didn't believe it because I saw this guy the boss or the British Sammis Association saying if brexit is allowed to happen there will be no more good sandwiches in the UK you're probably thinking what you're talking about that sounds fake well yeah the Prince salmon Association sounds fake to watch the head of the British sandwiches Oh see a ssin say people we cannot leave the European Union we cannot close our borders we cannot take back our sovereignty we not could not keep our tax money because sandwiches won't be good anymore take a look what does No Deal mean for you for the sandwich industry I don't think it means absolutely no sandwiches because our industry is very creative and cover it coming up with new recipes but certainly there would be serious problems in terms of some of the fresh ingredients we bring in from the European Union and also from overseas if particularly if we have problems in the ports and we can't get ingredients through because they are all fresh and don't have a very long shelf life and we've got no chance to stop piling fresh ingredients so I think the answer from the sandwich industry is going to be that it's going to limit the amount of choice to consumers have if we suddenly crash out a brexit in the way that's being talked about you know if I were a member of the British sandwich sociation I would launch a coup against Jim Winship first of all doesn't he look like the perfect boss of the sandwich association but you did you hear when he said he said I'm not going to say there won't be absolutely no sandwiches because that might sound a little made-up but there will be and I'm quoting him serious problems for sandwich lovers if Rexy goes through because I understand that there were no sandwiches in the United Kingdom especially there were no good sandwiches until the European Union came along you know you know sandwiches are named after the Earl of Sandwich right a Brit but now why am i showing you this silly sandwich clip above the silly sandwich Association saying I won't say there will be absolutely no sandwiches because we're very creative but we're going to have some serious sandwich problems maybe even a sandwich crisis he didn't say that last part I made that up but you couldn't tell why am i playing that for you why am i laughing so hard at the British sandwiches Oh see a shoe because imagine a culture the country a media dialogue and narrative a political class an establishment where you seriously have the British sandwiches Oh see a ssin guy on your state broadcaster to whip up sandwich phobia sandwich mania sandwich dislocation syndrome and and I think most sane people would say you're crazy but I think enough people would say oh my god the state broadcaster they wouldn't lie to me interviewed the British sandwiches Oh CA ssin they would never lie to me especially about sandwiches and if we are allowed to leave the European Union we we'll have quote a serious problem with sandwiches what kind of culture is that that's a culture of passivity of bureaucrats of rules and people saying oh well the experts said that's how it is so that's how it is the BBC said that's how it is we just got to live with it that's how it is and that is what I hate most about the United Kingdom in 2018 could you imagine if Jim Winship the big cheese of the British sandwich - so CA ssin we're leading something more important than the sandwich Association imagine if his tremendous executive and leadership skills and his raw charisma not to mention his sexy beard were deployed let's say - defending the United Kingdom against the Nazi Menace in 1940 well we can't fight I mean hair Chancellor Chancellor Hitler hair Hitler has offered us these terms and you know if we don't accept them we're gonna have some serious sandwich problems I mean the passivity and the surrender ISM and that's just how it is folks what are you gonna do the United Kingdom of 2018 is not the United Kingdom that it once was the spirit of free men and women does not burn as brightly today as it once did there's a state broadcaster that dominates the narrative if you speak out of it like Tommy does you're punished thrown in jail what was so incredible to me besides the sandwich Association clam show is that not a single broadcaster not a single presenter with the BBC we're glad that Tommy was freed were appalled by his treatment question putting in journalists in jail for 13 months not at not a single one all of them condemned Tommy anestine a national silent reporters without borders silent what kind of a culture is that a culture of passivity a culture of sheep and lambs that's not healthy some people have remarked why did it take Canadians to come and try and fight for freedom with Tommy there were some Brits obviously there were but where where's the official people I mean I'm just I'm just me but where's the official people not one elected MP stood with Tommy Gerrard baton and remember the European Parliament leader you keep spoke for him Lord Pearson of the House of Lords spoke for him not one MP not one mainstream journalist not one NGO why what what's happened there all British sandwiches Oh CA ssin bosses aren't they oh if we if we speak up for free speech for Tommy Robinson we will have no sandwiches you know I'd like to stand up for freedom of speech but you see we're going to have serious sandwich problems if we do that and we don't want sandwich problems I'm a little embarrassed for the United Kingdom that's the mother country we're here in Canada a daughter of the Commonwealth I'm embarrassed embarrassed there are good people there you know I really enjoyed meeting grassroots Tommy Robinson supporters at the court I felt at home with those folks and there's some characters all those people from different walks of life I felt at home with those folks but these BBC presenters who were saying no no no no no no no no no no no no no there are no Muslim rankings in the UK that's racist to say that I have been missing super chats can you send me the ones I missed by email and I'll read them Olli Larson chipped in 200 Danish kroner a system that let prisoners rule the prison is not a justice system is a shitty system Tommy would stand up for every abused girl you're exactly right my friends have emailed me a list of the super chats that are missed I'm going to read those right now to do answers first regulars after Chad opened all celebrations and reflections thanks to all who helped free Tommy and thanks to you Ezra for making it happen well thank you very much for saying that did I read david Crump thanks for your effort regarding Tommy Tommy

you've been a rock to Tommy and supporter Thank You Ezra no problem I read Justin archers I think I'm catching up let me go back to the super chat it's 12 54 so I'm not gonna play any more clips because we don't have time because we're done at the top of the hour oh and I have one more here prim pal oh wait five bucks Hawaii was originally called the Sandwich Islands it just needed to be said I didn't know that I thought the Sandwich Islands were another thing I obviously am NOT as much of a sandwich expert as my shapeliness would suggest but I'm willing to learn but sadly I can't trust the damn word the British sandwich so CA ssin has to say anymore imagine imagine that savvy dude chipped in five bucks thanks very much if you have any comment you want to add to that feel free okay I'm just gonna read random comments now if there's any more super chat so I'll read those right away I'm sorry if I miss the super chat I've done my best to keep an eye Australia's abies this is from Colleen Walker Australia's ABC would deny deny deny - as they do hear about things - Plus create fake news oh the fake news in the UK you know they make the American media look like quality broadcast they make CNN look fair unbelievable and and the BBC I'm sure of it that they are as dominant in the UK or more as Canada is here and as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation isn't Down Under Colby don't believe doomsayers Britton yeah exactly the British economy is doing better since they voted for brexit not worse and you know London's a real financial center like London New York Hong Kong and now Frankfurt is - I've been the frankfurt and i read some of the project fear remain campaign so the all these banks and bankers which are a source of so much wealth in the UK they're gonna leave London and go to Frankfurt I've been to Frankfurt nice people nice city I have a tough time imagining that these you know Titans these Masters of the Universe making a million quid a year are gonna leave the city of London with its theaters and restaurants and culture and life and and go to Frankfurt how many bankers livin the vida loca in London would say yeah I'm going to love to move my whole life and family to Frankfurt I got nothing against Frankfurt I'm just saying anyone who thought that all of these stock brokers and bankers and wheeler-dealers couldn't move to Frankfurt as a brexit you've got to go to Frankfurt to know what I'm talking about good people got nothing against frankfurters again as you can see frankfurters hamburgers Bologna Bologna Bologna I'm a bit of an expert okay let's read some more here shall we you can't keep Britt's down well they're trying aren't they the trying been oh hey Azhar why are you a zionist s because i believe that the bible which refers to Mount Zion as the place of the Jews I believe that's not only theologically accurate but I believe that it's historically geographically and politically agreeable I think that science is the place of the Jews Chris T the world is going to end Britain won't have no sandwich yeah my name is love Ezra stop making racist videos against the First Nation people I don't make racist videos against First Nations people in fact I regard myself as a First Nations ally I simply don't believe in the racist Indian Act which in my view treats Aboriginal people as second-class citizens in fact it's sort of been an editorial policy of mine that whenever I do a story criticizing what I call official Indians or the Indian industry that I always like to balance it with a hopeful positive peace on an Aboriginal person doing something entrepreneurial or positive because I think there's too much media coverage of Aboriginal people in Canada that is pathetic or negative or or just bad news periphery Pete Ezra do you have a nice single brother nope no both my brothers are married but that's very friendly of you to say okay I got time for one more Kendra Oppenheim Ezra's working for us not against us well I don't know who the US there is my goal is to express myself honestly and to tell you my views in the world and we have rebel supporters some of whom agree with a lot of what I have to say some of whom don't agree with what a lot of I would I have to say but they just like the fact that we're pretty free in our debates because we're not controlled by a government and we don't have corporate masters it means we're poor all the time but I think people like the debate and we've had some interesting characters passed through our doors since we were founded three years ago I mean some people are no longer with us tommy's independent we're still in touch with him some of our other alumni Gavin McInnes I remain friends with him I talk with him by email text or phone several times a week others are somewhat more estranged but we have some paternity over there journalism whether it's faith Goldie or Lauren southern you know but we have interesting characters here at the rebel and not everyone agrees with each other here at the rebel but I like the fact that we are a house of debate and we tend towards freedom speech and we tend to lean in to converse he's not shy away from them and that's why we have colorful characters like Tommy I see that it is one o'clock I'm gonna read the last super chat from Keith Jenkins with five pounds thank you very much it's one o'clock so we're going to wrap up sorry for the technical glitches today but I think you got the point of most of our videos if you want to see all of my videos on the Tommy Robinson case go to Tommy Trial dot-com as I said about half an hour ago we will stay engaged with Tommy Robinson it'll be different now because he's no longer a charity case in prison he's out he's a businessman in his own right he's independent so we'll have to figure out what our relationship is but as I told him over breakfast yesterday we will help him in a practical and useful way that makes a difference we're not gonna I'm not gonna be his boss I'm not going to be his nag I'm not gonna be a babysitter he doesn't need this things just want those things and I don't want to do them but if there are things that we can do that's useful and helpful and make a difference and there may be legal that may be crowdfunding will be there for me it's on vacation now I'll connect with them with these monies back and I'll tell you what our decisions are when the time is right that's it from us here at rebel world headquarters in Toronto it really is world headquarters isn't it we have viewers around the world we even have supporters around the world until next time good night and keep fighting for freedom you
