SURROUNDING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS OPENING MONOLOGUE. WE ARE EXCITED. IT IS OFFICIAL. WE ARE HITTING THE ROAD. NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE ON THE GROUND IN SINGAPORE. OF COURSE TO COVER THE LATEST FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HISTORIC AND CONSEQUENTIAL TALKS WITH THE DICTATOR KIM JONG UN. TONIGHT WE ARE DAYS AWAY FROM THE DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND NORTH KOREA. SOMETHING MANY THOUGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. SOMETHING OBAMA, CLINTON AND KERRY AND OTHERS AND THE FRIENDS ON THE LEFT COULD ONLY DREAM OF. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT SUMMITS OF MODERN HISTORY. President Trump: I HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL MY LIFE. I BELIEVE IN PREPARATION. I HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL MY LIFE. THE ONE-WEEK PREPARATIONS DON'T WORK. JUST ASK HILLARY WHAT HAPPENED TO HER IN THE DEBATE. I HAVE BEEN PREPARING ALL MY LIFE. Sean: WE REMINDED EVERYBODY REMEMBER THE DEBATES WITH HILLARY? AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO WHO HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON ALL OF THIS. HE WEIGHED IN. LOOK AT THAT. THE FACT THAT THE TWO LEADERS ARE COMING TO THE TABLE SHOWS THAT THE TWO SIDES ARE SERIOUS. THE DIPLOMATIC MODEL USED TODAY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST EFFORTS. OUR EFFORTS GIVE US HOPE WE CAN FIND REAL SUCCESS FOR PAST EFFORTS HAVE FALLEN SHORT. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HOPEFUL. HE IS ALSO GOING IN THE SUMMIT WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN. WE HAVE SEEN HOW MANY INADEQUATE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN STRUCK IN THE PAST. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT STAND FOR A BAD DEAL. Sean: ALL RIGHT. HOW DO WE GET TO THIS POINT? HISTORY LESSON. "HANNITY" HISTORY LESSON. WE START IN THE '90s. BILL CLINTON. HEB HE MET WITH KIM JONG UN'S FATHER, KIM JONG IL. HE PROMISED THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HE PAID BILLIONS IN ENERGY SUBSIDIARIES AND MADE CONCESSIONS AS IF THIS WOULD MAKE FOR WORLD PEACE. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS. THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE UNITED STATES. NORTH KOREA WILL FREEZE AND THEN DISMANTLE THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. SOUTH KOREA AND OUR OTHER ALLIES WILL BE BETTER PROTECT ED. SOUTH KOREA WITH SUPPORT FROM JAPAN AND OTHER NATIONS WILL BEAR MOST OF THE COST TO PROVIDE KOREA WITH FUEL TO MAKE UP FOR THE NUCLEAR ENERGY IT IS LOSING. THEY WILL PAY FOR ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM TO ALLOW THEM TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY TO MAKE IT HARDER TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE UNITED STATES AND THE INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS WILL CAREFULLY MONITOR NORTH KOREA. TO MAKE SURE IT KEEPS ITS COMMITMENTS. ONLY AS IT DOES SO WILL THEY FULLY JOIN THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS. Sean: BILL CLINTON WAS DEAD WRONG. NORTH KOREA SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. UNDER EIGHT YEARS OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA, HIS WEAK AND FECKLESS LEADERSHIP, WHILE KIM JONG UN'S ACTIONS BECAME MORE HOSTILE. PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT TRUMP WITH UNFETTERED INTERNATIONAL DISASTER AFTER DISASTER. THIS IS JUST ONE. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE IN 2017, THE SITUATION IN NORTH KOREA WAS AT A BOILING POINT. REMEMBER, KIM JONG UN SHOOTING THE LONG-RANGE MISSILES OVER JAPAN. THREATENING TO BLOW UP GUAM. AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF WEAK, PATHETIC SPINELESS LEADERSHIP UNDER OBAMA, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED. YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS. President Trump: NORTH KOREA BEST NOT MAKE ANY MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE, FURY AND FRANKLY POWER. THE LIKES ANY HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. PEOPLE QUESTIONING WAS IT TOO TOUGH? MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME. FOR MANY YEARS. IT'S TIME THAT SOMEBODY STUCK UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES. IT'S A TRAGEDY AND IT CAN'T BE ALLOWED. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO GUAM, THERE WILL BE BIG TROUBLE IN NORTH KOREA. IF HE DOES ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO GUAM OR ANYPLACE ELSE THAT IS AN EMERGENCY TERRITORY OR AN AMERICAN ALLY HE WILL TRULY REGRET IT. HE WILL REGRET IT FAST. ROCKET MAN ON A SUICIDE MISSION FOR HIMSELF. AND FOR REGIME. Sean: OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT THEN BACKED UP HIS TOUGH RHETORIC WITH ACTION. AND HE SENT MULTIPLE CARRIER AND STRIKE GROUPS TO THE REGION. HE RAMPED UP DEVASTATING SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREA. AND, OF COURSE, PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA'S BIGGEST ALLY, CHINA. HE FORGED A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT. WHAT THIS IS CALLED, THESE WORDS ARE PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. BY THE WAY, IT SAID YOUR MAIN STREAM CORRUPT DESTROY TRUMP MEDIA TO A HYSTERICAL FIT. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP. TAKE A LOOK. THE IDEA OF A NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN WITH NORTH KOREA KEEPS YOU AT NIGHT? I WOULD RECOMMEND DELETING YOUR TWITTER APP. HE'S NOT BEING CAVALIER WITH A THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR, IT'S CAVALIER IN A WAY THAT MAKES HIM SEENDY MEANTED. THIS IS FROM A PERSON WHO IS NOT WELL, FROM A LEADER NOT FIT FOR OFFICE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOODING KIM JONG GOODING GOADING KIM JONG UN TO TEST THE NUCLEAR FACILITY AND SHOW HIM WRONG. FUNDAMENTALLY IT COMES ACROSS AS TWO KINDERGARTENERS JOSTLING EACH OTHER BUT THEY EACH HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. TOO LATE AFTER 100 MILLION AMERICANS DIE. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. TRUMP'S COMMENT ABOUT THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE THE EXPERTS WORRIED HE COULD TRIGGER A CATASTROPHE. Sean: WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE MEDIA IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG. THEY WERE WRONG. THEY ARE WRONG. ALL ICBM TESTS DONE. THEY RETURN THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES. THEY AGREE TO DISCUSS THE COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA IN EXCHANGE FOR NO CONCESSIONS. HE CROSSED OVER THE D.M.Z. TO THE ARMS OF THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT AND DISMANTLED ONE OF THE NUCLEAR TEST SITES. DESPITE THE DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS YOUR MEDIA IS HATING AND DOUBTING AND SADLY MANY EVEN ACTIVELY ROOTING FOR FAILURE. THIS WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE WORLD. OUR KIDS, OUR GRAND KIDS. LOOK AT THE NBC CONSPIRACY HOST QUESTIONING TRUMP'S PREPAREDNESS FOR THE UPCOMING SUMMIT. WATCH THIS. WE HAVE TO POINT OUT, THE PRESIDENT WAS CRITICAL WHEN WE PLAYED THAT CLIP OF HIM TALKING OF BEING PREPARED FOR THE NORTH KOREA SUMMIT WE DIDN'T ADD WHAT HE SAID AT THE END. HE WAS CRITICAL. HE SAID, "I'VE BEEN PREPARING ALL MY LIFE." I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHEN WAS THAT? WHEN YOU APPEARED IN A PLAYBOY SOFT CORN MURPH VIE OR BODY SLAMMED VINCE McMAHON OR WHEN YOU WERE LEAKING INFORMATION WHEN YOU DISGUISED YOURSELF AZURE OWN P.R. GUY TALKING TO TABLOIDS ABOUT WHAT A GREAT LOVER YOU WERE. Sean: TAKE A LOOK AT THE COVER FROM "THE ECONOMIST" SHOWING PRESIDENT IN PLACE OF MILEY CYRUS, THE WRECKING BALL THAT WAS INFAMOUS. SAYING EVEN IF HE STRIKES A DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA THE FOREIGN POLICY WILL HARM THE WORLD. THAT IS ROOTING FOR FAILURE. THE MEDIA TRIES TO BASH THE PRESIDENT AT EVERY TURN THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES. HE HAS A LOT OF REALLY IMPORTANT DIPLOMACY TO TACKLE. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE UPCOMING TALKS ON SINGAPORE THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. WE'LL BROADCAST THERE NEXT WEEK. FIRST TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP LANDED IN QUEBEC IN CANADA TO MEET WORLD LEADERS AT THE ANNUAL G7 SUMMIT. TENSIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH AHEAD OF THE MEETING AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED PLANS TO TACKLE SOME OF THE UNFAIR TRADING INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES WITH RETALIATORY TARIFFS. HE WANTS FREE AND FAIR TRADE. HE WROTE PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU IS BEING INDIGNANT BRINGING UP THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE U.S. AND CANADA HAD OVER THE MANY YEARS AND OTHER THINGS. HE DOESN'T BRING UP THE FACT THEY CHARGE UP TO 300% ON DAIRY. HURTING OUR FARMERS, KILLING OUR AGRICULTURE. HE CALLED IT'SLATED AND THIS IS WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT WHAT COULD BE A TENSE AND THE INTERESTING G7 TRUMP SUMMIT. TAKE A LOOK. President Trump: IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A DEAL, WE WILL TERMINATE NAFTA AND HAVE A BETTER DEAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A DEAL, WE WILL BE BETTER OFF. THE E.U. TREATS US UNFAIRLY. CANADA, UNFAIRLY, MEXICO, UNFAIRLY. WITH THAT SAID I THINK WE WILL PROBABLY EASILY MAKE A DEAL. Sean: WHILE THE PRESIDENT IS BUSY DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST, THAT IS NEGOTIATING, I KNOW IF I ASK HIM TO COME ON THE SHOW, I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE. 15. HOW ABOUT SIX? GIVE YOU 14. THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES. THE MEDIA HAS BEEN BEING DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST. SPREADING ANTI-TRUMP IT HAVE HAVE VITRIOL. ESPECIALLY AT NBC NEWS. LOOK AT HOW DISGUSTING THE CLIP IS NBC HOSTS ARE TRASHING THE WOMEN IN THE PRESIDENT'S LIFE. THIS IS SO DERANGED AND OFF THE RAILS. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE TRUMP WOMEN, THE TRUMP FAMILY THAN ANYONE. WHAT DO THEY DO ON A DAY LIKE TODAY? ARE THEY THE MOST STOIC HUMAN BEINGS? ARE THEY NUMB, DEAD INSIDE, PAID OFF? WHAT IS THE DEAL? YES, YES, AND YES. I THINK THEY DO NOT SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP THE WAY THAT ALL OF US SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY HAVE A DISTORTED IMAGE OF WHO HE IS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE REACTION WE DO. THEIR MOTHERS KNOW. THEY SEEM TO BE RAISING NICE KIDS. HOW DO THEY WALL IT OFF? DEAD INSIDE? ARE YOU PROUD OF THIS? THIS IS YOUR NETWORK. IS THAT NEWS TO YOU? WHAT ABOUT THE CLIP BY THE WAY FROM YOUR MORNING ANCHOR? LIBERAL JOE. AND ANDY LOOK, ARE YOU REALLY PROUD OF THIS BIZARRE CONSPIRACY THAT SHE IS NOW, WELL, PAWNING OFF AS NEWS ON YOUR SO-CALLED NEWS NETWORK? HERE YOU GO. I HOPE YOU LOVE IT. THE HYPOCRISY IS ASTOUNDING BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEONE WHO SPOKE TO DONALD TRUMP RECENTLY ABOUT LIFE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND DONALD TRUMP'S BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH PORN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. SO THERE YOU GO. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF NEWS FOR YOU. HE IS UPSET HE CAN'T WATCH PORN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I BET THEY HAVE THOSE ONE-900-NUMBERS BLOCKED, TOO, WHICH MUST BE A DISAPPOINTMENT. I'M NOT SURE BUT IT FLIES IN FACE OF ALL OF THIS. Sean: OF COURSE, NBC NEWS IS FAR FROM BEING THE ONLY NEWS OUTLET WITH THE EXTREME BIAS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. MANY IN THE MEDIA, WELL, THEY HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER YOURS TRULY ALL WEEK BECAUSE OF A MONOLOGUE I DID EARLIER IN THE WEEK. ALL I DID WAS HIGHLIGHT A SAD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS A TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY. WE DON'T HAVE EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE FOR THE CLINTONS AND ONE FOR THE REST OF US. I WAS OBVIOUSLY BEING SARCASTIC AND MAKING A COMPARISON. I SAID WHAT IF I SAID THAT THOSE THAT ROBERT MUELLER REQUESTED THE PHONES FROM, WHAT IF I SAID IT'S A BAD IDEA. KIDDING. I SAID ALL SORT OF CAVEATS. WHAT IF THEY FOLLOW HILLARY CLINTON'S LEAD? WHAT IF IN FACT THEY DECIDED TO DELETE THE E-MAILS, WIPE AWAY ALL EVIDENCE, ACID WASH AND BLEACH THE HARD DRIVES ON THE PHONES AND SMASH THEM UP TO ITSY BITSY PIECES WITH HAMMERS. THEY WERE MORE MAD OF THE ME THAN THEY WERE AT HILLARY FOR ACTUALLY DOING THESE THINGS. THIS IS A TASTE OF HOW THEY DISTORTED THESE COMMENTS. SEAN HANNITY IS NOW LITERALLY TELLING POTENTIAL WITNESSES AND SUBJECTS IN THE MUELLER PROBE TO DESTROY THE EVIDENCE. AND HAMMER THE PHONES TO PIECES. HANNITY DEFENDERS MAY CALL THAT SARCASM AND POETIC LICENSE BUT WORDS ARE WORDS. SEAN HANNITY LIVES OFF HIS WORDS AND WE KNOW THEY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT. IF ANYONE DOES WHAT HE SAYS THERE, THEY WOULD BE COMMITTING A CRIME. WHAT SEAN HANNITY ADMITTED TO AND WAS ENTICING PEOPLE TO DO AND ASKING THEM TO DO IS DESTROY EVIDENCE, WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF THE WITNESS TAMPERING STATUTE. NO RESPONSIBILITY PERSON ON TELEVISION, NO RESPONSIBLE SO-CALLED JOURNALIST SHOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR PEOPLE TO DESTROY EVIDENCE IN A SERIOUS FEDERAL INVESTIGATION. I DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE HIM PROSECUTED. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS GIVE PEOPLE A WIDE BERTH ON FIRST-AMENDMENT RELATED CONDUCT SO UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC TO LINK IT UP THIS IS WHAT WE CATEGORIZE AS AWFUL BUT LAWFUL CONDUCT. LISTEN, IF HE IS ADVOCATING FOR MUELLER'S WITNESSES TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE MAYBE MUELLER SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM AND ASK WHERE THE IDEA HAS COME FROM? SAY THIS? KNOWING MUELLER HE IS NOT GOING TO LIGHT THAT FIRE UNDER SOMEONE WHO GETS FREE AIR TIME EVERY DAY. HE CAN GO TO A JUDGE AND SAY CEASE AND DESIST WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. AND DID TRUMP GET THIS IDEA FROM YOU? Sean: CEASE AND DESIST?
