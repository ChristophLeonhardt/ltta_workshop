three choices we can either walk through
the front door or walk to the sides now
a lot of you guys were saying don't show
all the ways I already showed two funny
ways so basically we need to take the
elevator but all these gods are guarding
it so I can't walk through the front
door okay we're gonna go through the
sides okay here we go
climb down the ladder okay we're gonna
sneak him sneak him right in that bump
up there not gonna see it coming I'm
telling her right now holy shit we're in

okay take us disguise okay we are now
disguised as a god no one's gonna mess
with us now blow me look at me I'm like
a goddamn cowboy dude okay I'm gonna go
help me some people okay so we can now
go up here and I won't be suspicious
okay guys basically we need to take this
elevator but there's people are guarding
it okay so we need to make an epic
distraction so down here is some man
working on the electrics and he is
covered with water that's right ladies
gentlemen we're gonna kill him okay so
if we turn on this generator okay and
now the logistics odd and now what we're
gonna do is we're gonna electrocute
