I didn't want to build a company but I actually explicitly did not want to build a company it wasn't even that I that I kind of wasn't thinking about building a company and that's why early on where most people would probably launch it at schools that they thought it would have the highest chance of working what I did was I wanted the schools that I thought would have the lowest chance of working right and so those were schools that already had some kind of school community the reason why I did that was because I wanted to know early on if this was something that that was just worth spending a lot of time on as a project you know in college I I just built a whole lot of different things and that's just a passion of mine is kind of kept doing building things very quickly what you and I mean the first version of Facebook I built in in two weeks right and and then we improved the application when it worked and and spread extremely quickly at these other colleges that already had something similar to it that people were using we figured okay this is something that that maybe could grow to be a lot bigger and that's when my roommates joined me and and we really started growing it aggressively
