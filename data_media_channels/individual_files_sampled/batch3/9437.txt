Shannon: AND A LEG, THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HE ARGUES DEMOCRATS ARE NOW WHAT HE CALLS A PERJURY TRAP FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. AN OP-ED ENTITLED? IS THE MOOD BOURQUE, HE ARGUES THAT CABINET SHOULD BE DENIED CONFIRMATION OR IF CONFIRM SHOULD ACTUALLY IMPEACH BY LATER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS ON THE BASIS OF LYING ABOUT DRINKING OR TERMS. LET'S BRING A MAN, JONATHAN TURLEY. PROFESSOR, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HOW WORRIED ARE YOU THAT THIS IS THE PATH THAT WE ARE GOING DOWN? AND ON YOUR PC IS SAID THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT GETTING TO HIM WHAT KIND OF JUDGE SHE WOULD BE, THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING UP STATEMENTS AND POTENTIALLY PUTTING HIM IN A PLACE WHERE HE WOULD HAVE DISCREPANCIES OR LIES ABOUT THINGS FROM HIS PAST. IT WAS AN OTHERWORLDLY FEELING ABOUT THESE HEARINGS. WHEN YOU'VE A U.S. SENATOR GOING LITERALLY THROUGH A YEARBOOK AND SAYING, WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS THIS OR THAT? THAT REALLY DID HAVE A FEELING OF A PERJURY TRAP. WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC QUESTIONS IS THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY PRESS THAT MUCH ON THE ACTUAL ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. THEY KEPT ON TRYING TO GET HIM TO DEFINE TERMS THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE EMBARRASSING. THE IDEA BEING THAT HE COULD EITHER REFUSE AND SAY THAT IS JUST NOT A VERY DIGNIFIED QUESTION, WHICH FRANKLY I THINK HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED DOING. OR HE MIGHT ALLY AND WHICH POINT YOU CAN SAY THAT ALL OF THIS DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE HE HAS LIED UNDER OATH. AT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE NEW STANDARD, ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US. Shannon: AND HOMELY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH THAT. HE SAYS, I CABIN SPENT COVERING POLITICS FOR THAT LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH, 11 YEARS BUT I THINK ENTITLED TO PLAY THIS CARD. THE POSITION THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS BEING HONEST ABOUT HIS DRINKING IS THE WORST TO DIE UPON THAT I'VE EVER SEEN OTHERWISE, SMART PEOPLE TRY TO DIE UPON. WE PEOPLE FROM THE BEGINNING SAY, BEFORE YOU HAVE A NEGATIVE AND WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO STOP THIS PERSON. WHETHER IT IS ABOUT TEMPERAMENT, DRINKING, WHAT HE WENT ON A CALENDAR IS ANYTHING TOO SMALL TO GO AFTER? NO. WHAT IS BEING ARGUED HERE IS THAT COME WITH HER HE LIED IN ANY SUBJECT. THE SCOPE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER HAS NOW EXPANDED TO THE POINT WHERE IT DEFIES DEFINITION. ANYTHING CAN BE ASKED. AND THINK AND BE ASKED OF A NOMINEE. ANY ANSWER THAT IS NOT OPENLY AND FRANKLY EMBARRASSING AND DISCLOSING OF YOUR PAST COULD BE VIEWED AS PERJURY. THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS WHAT WE WANT FROM THE CONFIRMATION HEARING AND IF IT IS, WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE TO BE EXPECT TO GET? IF EVERYTHING IN YOUR PAST CAN BE BROUGHT UP AND YOU CAN GET CONFRONTED AND DEMANDED THAT YOU ANSWERED. MY GREATEST CONCERN ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE ARE SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL OBLIGATIONS. ORIGINALLY THEY WERE ASKING ABOUT DRINKING AND THESE TERMS BECAUSE THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO HIS BEING A BLACKOUT DRUNK. AND IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THAT WAS SORT OF AN ARTIFICIAL EXCUSE. THERE WERE ASKING AND DETAILS FOR HIM TO BECOME A HOLY DRINK WITH, HOW HE DRANK AND WHETHER HE WAS BELLIGERENT. THEN YOU REALIZE THAT THIS IS REALLY A PERJURY TRAP. Shannon: AT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF IMPEACHMENT? I WANT TO PLAY WHAT A DEMOCRAT COME IF THEY RETAKE THE HOUSE AS MANY PEOPLE THINK THEY WELCOME HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE HEADING UP THE HOUSE COMMITTEE AND HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE I WORD, IMPEACHMENT. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT AND THE SENATE HASN'T INVESTIGATED, THEN THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO. WE WOULD HAVE TO INVESTIGATE, ANY ALLEGATION OF PERJURY OR THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPERLY LOOKED INTO BEFORE. Shannon: UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAD A PIECE SAID THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER SHOULD PLEDGED OUT THAT IF THEY WIN A MAJORITY, THEY WILL CONDUCT AN IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW ONLY ONE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO WAS IMPEACHED BY THE SENATE AND KATE COME OUT. WHAT ARE THE ODDS THEY GOT ON THIS PATH? YOU CAN'T COUNT ANYTHING OUT. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THESE MEMBERS TAKE SUCH A RECKLESS TASK. I WAS THE LEAD COUNSEL IN THE LAST JUDICIAL COMMITTEE. IT IS A TERRIBLE PROCESS. IT IS A LONG ONE. I HAVE NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THEY WOULD NOT SUCCEED. THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY WOULD LAY WITH THIS TYPE OF MOVE WOULD BE INHERENTLY DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR SYSTEM. THEY CREATED A TYPE OF PROTECTIVE PERSONA FOR OUR JUSTICES. THAT IS WHY THEY MADE IMPEACHMENT SO DIFFICULT, YOU CAN REDUCE THE SALARIES. IF YOU ARE IMPEACHED AS SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE DONE WELL IN OFFICE, IF HE IS CONFIRMED THAT MEANS THE MAJORITY OF SENATORS FOUND THAT THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THIS RECORD. YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH THAT, BUT TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO A DO OVER WOULD OPEN UP ANY JUSTICE TO THAT TYPE OF TREATMENT. ELENA KAGAN WAS ACCUSED OF IT BEING EITHER LYING OR MISREPRESENTING FACTS AND HER BACKGROUND. PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF WORK WITH THE HEALTH CARE LITIGATION. WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS A SUBSTANCE OR NOT, IT GIVES AN EXAMPLE THAT ANYONE CAN CLAIM TO HAVE A DO OVER AND THE COURT WOULD THEN BECOME VULNERABLE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE. THE VERY THING THAT THEY WANT US TO AVOID. Shannon: WE WILL WATCH AND WAIT.
