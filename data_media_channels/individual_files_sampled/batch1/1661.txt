is the United States becoming more belligerent John Bolton is to take over as the US national security adviser after previously backing attacks on Iran and North Korea and voicing a strong America first policy long before Donald Trump what signal is the White House sending to the rest of the world now this is inside story hello welcome to the program I'm Sahil Raman the legal case for striking North Korea first and to stop Iran's bomb bomb Iran well two of the articles penned by John Bolton in leading US newspapers over the years Donald Trump's choice for national security advisor appears to match the president's confrontational views on the rest of the world which often rejects consensus building and supports using American economic and military power to punish anyone who doesn't fall into line Natasha Gilliam has more John Bolton has worked for three Republican presidents and caused controversy even among members of his own party now he joins a trump administration apparently in turmoil analysts say Bolton is a hardliner and Donald Trump is sending a very clear message by choosing him instead of a more moderate voice mr. Bolton didn't see a war that he didn't like you know when he was at the United Nations as an acting our ambassador there because he couldn't get confirmed by the Senate he said you know diplomacy is useless it could might as well flow it out into the sea and sink I think what we can see is an escalation of tensions Bolton has a history of imposing American military might he advocated the invasion of Iraq in 2003 while ambassador to the UN he took a hard line against North Korea and Iran by pushing sanctions the United States has followed a policy for over four years essentially of deferring to European efforts to negotiate with Iran I think it's clear that that policy has failed the seasoned politicians returned to the front line of foreign policy gives him an opportunity to shape the president's views on North Korea and Iran at a critical moment Trump is spoken of wanting to rip up the Iranian nuclear accord and he's due for a much-anticipated meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong hoon in May the talks with North Korea go poorly Trump will walk out and say you know that didn't really get us anything and Don and John Bolton I say look I told you we should strike North Korea John Bolton's but on the record he said twice in last six months the US attack North Korea even within Trump's inner circle there's disagreement about whether Bolton is the right man for the national security job his ideology is thought to be aligned with his boss he's already tried to ease fears that he pushed the United States and to another conflict saying he will be one voice among many who are advising the president and there should be a free exchange of ideas as an ever growing number of trump's right-hand men and women have learned Bolton's biggest challenge may be keeping the continued faith of President Trump and his job Natasha Ganesha al-jazeera for Inside Story john bolton has several immediate global challenges to deal with he'll get to weigh in on whether the US should abandon the Iran nuclear deal which he strongly advocated president Trump has to decide by May the 12th also in May Trump's much-anticipated meeting with North Korean leader Kim jong-un the Bolton is an enthusiastic supporter of Israel and it said in a past that a two-state solution is dead he's even mooted a so-called three state solution with Garza becoming Egyptian territory and the occupied West Bank going back to Jordan on Russia and like Trump Bolton is known for his deep distrust of the Kremlin well joining me in on this edition of inside story from Boston we have Jim Walsh senior research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology security studies program welcome to you from Singapore Evan Reznik coordinator in the United States program at institute of defense and Strategic Studies at the S Rajaratnam School and here I'll set with me is Ali vittala Nejad a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center good to have all of you with us on the program mister watch can I come to you first I mean observers and analysts across the board described the move as one that is you might see bringing a hardliner or one of more hawkish nature and substance to the US cabinet what does Bolton bring to the cabinet that his predecessors didn't well for the time being he's bringing support from the president all the reporting was that McMaster and Trump were not a good combination it is reported that mr. Trump didn't like McMasters sort of slowly going over the pros and cons and pushing back when he disagreed with the president john bolton is a skilled bureaucratic player a been in washington a long time he obviously has been able to cozy up to the president and convince him that they're on the same page even though there are differences between the two but what they share and I want to underline this a lot of you know what we're hearing is that this is signaling or it has to do with policy or ideology I disagree completely for this president this is not a policy president this is not an ideologies it's about emotion and personality and what he finds in John Bolton for the moment is a personality that syncs with him and some views that's that he's an agreement with if Lincoln had a team of rivals than this president is looking for a team of people he gets along with and who agree with him I think it's much more about personality than it is about policy but the result will be a more hawkish America idea mr. Reznik is is agreeing with you but it's not does she want more question mr. Walsh and as you've touched upon it and that his advisers around him generally members that agree with the president I mean does he just really want yes-men around him I mean if you're an observer looking into the American cabinet at the moment anybody that disagrees or stands on sides on the air of caution is out yeah the one exception to that now is secretary mattis a secretary mantis has also been a very skillful player here he does not show up on the evening news very often on the US media he's never shown to be publicly disagreeing with the president so he seemed to be able to hold on to that relationship but we'll have to see now that the the mix the equation has changed with the Secretary of State Tillerson out with McMaster out and only madis remaining whether that change in the equation will lead to a change in results I suspect it will but time will tell and very briefly before we can let them expand this mr. Walsch Richard painter the former chief ethics officer for george bush's george w bush's administration tweeted mr. bolt is hiring is an invitation to war perhaps nuclear war it's worrying some quarters now or will certainly in in the coming days of the political establishment in Washington DC surely yeah we're running the u.s. is running a gigantic national security experiment we have a president who is inexperienced uninformed and prone to rather rash decisions now he surrounded himself with people who he believes mostly agree with him and the question is in this permissive environment is he going to do things that lead to war now the positive case here is such it is such a scary situation that it will scare other countries into complying with u.s. demands that would be the the happy scenario the unhappy scenario would be we have a president who is unconstrained makes poor decisions and we result that results in chaos and conflicts you know I hope it's the former is distasteful as it is but I suspect it will be the latter well mr. Walsh I think you've certainly set the scene for us let's bring in our Singapore guest Evan Resnick who is also I think nodding quite vigorously with some of the issues that you mentioned I mean it does bring us very closely rarely to the nuclear issue within asia-pacific it's a hot topic certainly with North Korea mr. bolt has been very clear Evan on that situation the Bush administration he advocated for a first strike but of course it's only early hours not even days of his appointment now and he won't take that job until early April he's being very tight-lipped at the moment what do you think his position is going to be John Bolton has a long history of being very consistent in his foreign policy and national security policy views they tend to be wrong but at least he's very consistent in them he's a true ideologue so I don't anticipate that he is going to radically become a dove now that he has come on board the Trump administration so my sense is that he will continue advocating what he has long advocated throughout his political career is it is it an easy choice to actually have someone like John Bolton in that position as mr. Walsh Jim Walsh in our Boston guests suggested when there are already so many you might say Hawks in the cabinet that could give him the say the good the president the same advice again I think Jim Walsh was absolutely right on this to some degree if Trump was was going to play the skillfully when he meets with Kim jong-un in May he you know that Bolton's a appointment will be sort of lingering in the background and may provide him Trump with more bargaining leverage right you agree with me or I'm gonna start listening to John Bolton and take his advice so if Trump is a sort of a skillful deal maker which he's not he says he is but he's not at least not proven to be thus far then Bolton's appointment might conceivably provide some leverage to the administration there's always someone worse out there so you better give me what I want how concerned are you that if Trump does have this meeting with Kim Jong and comes away empty-handed and is then advised that he has to take more severe measures other than sanctions it's possible I North Korea as best we know has a rudimentary nuclear weapons capability it has some couple of dozen of nuclear devices if nuclear deterrence theory holds then even you know if if nuclear weapons deterred Stalin and Mao presumably they would also deter Donald Trump from doing something absolutely crazy namely attacking a nuclear-armed adversary but it's hard to tell everything in this administration seems so ad hoc and chaotic all the rules keep getting broken so it's it's very hard to predict my my hope is that Trump he sort of talks a big game but he usually backs down he he tends to sort of flit from from topic to topic and when he's proven wrong or he he doesn't he seems sort of congenitally incapable of losing face okay so that if there is that aspect to his personality that if the meeting doesn't go well he can always just sort of move on to the next topic or forget about it or he'll just lie about whatever happened okay Ivan let's just hold it there and Jim obviously find it very entertaining what you're saying let's bring in ally for Tola and the adherend are really interesting scenario here because if you have a scenario in North Korea where you want them to get rid of their nuclear weapons and bring them into you might say the international on the other hand with a country like Iran President Trump and behind him perhaps now John Bolton want to rip up the Iran nuclear agreement which could then force Iran to start its uranium enrichment if it wanted to again and that's a real danger in terms of instability in in the Middle East yeah I mean first of all I'm not sure if the Trump ad machine administration does this linking between the North Korean and the Iran a nuclear case but what is true is that once John Bolton is going to assume his position they're gonna be one month left and in during this one month we were we have to see what kind of dynamic will evolve with the European partners of the United States if they will as Jim indicated on a general level be willing to give more concessions to the u.s. position on points that Trump mentioned to be issues of concern regarding the Iran nuclear deal that is Iran's ballistic missile program but also Iran's regional policy so if we're gonna be seeing if the Europeans are gonna be more willing to give concessions on the other hand during this month we're gonna see a likely a war of you know between different kind of institutions and the in the United States when it comes to the direction of your own policy whether it gonna be a change towards a regime change policy or it gonna be just to be putting more pressure to give to have more concessions when you have a cabinet that is between repeatedly a more intensely right-wing if we can put it like that then you add John Bolton into that mix and this particular issue episode of inside stories about John Bolton how much influence is he going to have on the cabinet considering when it comes to Iran he's absolutely adamant on what he wants to see when we had these demonstrations in Iran early in 2018 on the streets across the country he was advocating full regime change and really pursuing that quite vocally in many newspapers and television interviews I mean there is no doubt then john bolton has a very problematic view on iran it is to be known to be a supporter of the medina hug organization mko which is basically totalitarian cult and he has been speaking at their rallies quite often and we've also been seeing pictures now the problem is he is very much close to that group that is being backed by Israeli Hawks us Hawks but more recently by Saudi Arabia so this position will be conserved perceived into Iran as a change perhaps towards a u.s. regime change policy on Iran yet I have to be also adding that that the geopolitical situation in the region is very much different than during the Bush years where the neocons were in the corridors of power in the United States because back then Iran was not such an influential player all over the place as it is today so to argue that John Bolton is a sign for a regime change policy on Iran to be materialized is I think in which true and not it's too early to tell indeed let's move on to another one of the big issues at Jim Walsh in Boston if there was any issue that's that's highlighted certainly the the Trump administration it's the issue of a two-state solution for both the Israelis and the Palestinians the Palestinians have cut off communications ever since the US and Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel Bolton arriving into the cabinet is really not good news for the Palestinians and though at the perhaps present moment it wouldn't really care about it too much because they know that they have they can't really negotiate with the Trump administration yeah I think that's right particularly the last thing you said I don't think there's the peace process is going anywhere there's no sign that it's going to go anywhere and both the current prime minister in Israel will see how long he lasts has certainly made noises during his previous election campaign talking about a one-state solution and so I and in a moment of political crisis for him it's not clear to me there's going to be any movement I guess my concern would be less about the peace process in particular and more generally about the region will Israel think that it has a blank check to do whatever it wants in the region whether that's actions in Syria and go lon or elsewhere do they believe rightly or wrongly that they can carry out attacks with impunity and have the White House backed them with this more vigorous foreign policy to or muscular foreign policy team I think that's the real danger I think unfortunately the peace process is sort of frozen right now and that's I guess in relative terms the good news because the bad news is things would get very get much worse in the region Alif Attila the Jedi mean how worse can it get for the Palestinians at this moment do they have every any Avenue beyond Trump which I suppose is their is their first port of call to look to Bolton in any shape or form for solace a way to talk or way to negotiate I mean the picture has not been bright in any case and now there is also I mean it has become darker with John Bolton being clearly on this underside of the Israeli government but I think that there is you know a lot of continuity in US policy anyways what Trump has done is to say what is how it has been long-standing US policy for a long time and I think the u.s. standing as a whole India in the Middle East will suffer from that because it is more and more seen to be when it comes to the israel-palestine issue to be firmly on one side of the equation Jim can I come over to you embossed I mean John Kelly is the chief of staff we've got James mattis to fence secretary dare I say they are the only reasonable voices within a very largely nationalistic cabinet at the moment yeah I think that's right but I think there's other things going on too it's not just a battle of ideology or of caution versus nationalism there is a sort of chaos here you have people who are cycling in and out even before this most recent announcement there were many chairs that would have been left unfilled the US has no ambassador to South Korea we're talking on the air now about a possible attack on North Korea we don't have an ambassador in South Korea there's the no confirmed Assistant Secretary of State for asia-pacific and on and on mr. Pompeo has been nominated to be the new secretary of state but he remains to be confirmed and that might turn into a battle and so we have many people who are leaving the administration we have holes that had not been filled and those holes are growing in number at the same time that the president is increasingly giving his attention to the Muller investigation and is growing obviously more aggressive and more angry about that so to me the sort of frame here is the is this unsettled chaos and new people coming on the job and other people leaving and deadlines soon to approach that's one thing and the second thing very briefly is there are some things the president can do all on his own for example pull out of the Iran agreement and it doesn't matter what anyone says as with the Paris climate Accord if he wants to pull out well he's gonna pull out but when it comes to launching military strikes let's say against Iran the agreement falls apart Iran starts re enriching Bolton advocates for bombing those enrichment facilities well it's at that point that CENTCOM the part of the Pentagon that's responsible for the Middle East that's when they start to have a say that's more important sure and I will point out that the head of CENTCOM has come out in favor of the Iran agreement of course mattis has been in favor of keeping it as well so once we get to a point of actually using military force more constraints might be applied but at the end of the day the military will do what its commander-in-chief tells it to do whether mr. Bolton likes it or not let's go to heaven Renwick ate in Singapore I mean obviously this is all playing out with a timeline of a potential meeting with Kim jong-un Pyongyang must be either scratching their head or smiling at the chaos that is being created in Washington at the moment how do you assess how North Korea are going to approach this potential meeting with Trump in what less than two months time I have no idea it's again it's sort of a testament to the to the sheer chaos of this administration we speak of hypothetical way I mean for Kim jong-un this could be a massive propaganda victory for him if this the summit goes well and if he flatters Donald Trump and and and and and and Trump's ego is sufficiently stroked that they get along well it's a it's a tremendous diplomatic and propaganda victory for Kim if the summit somehow goes haywire or there's some sort of clash between the two personality clash then all hell could break loose so it's actually a very high risk potentially high reward gamble for kim jeong-hoon to participate in this in this event now usually the analysts of US foreign policy are used to talking about unpredictability and risk when it comes to North Korean foreign policy not the foreign policy emanating out of Washington indeed Kim jong-un looks like a pillar of stability by comparison with what we've seen in the White House well we shall see what certainly happens in May I mean Ally for total energy let's come in here I mean obviously we know potential hopefully not conflict in in in the Korean Peninsula but sort of Vietnam Iraq Cuba to name a few areas where regime change was sought by the US you know we've heard these words coming from John Bolton in recent months over Iran body bags with American soldiers or operatives have come back home it seems that lessons are not being learned from history and armed conflicts and neva tably have to come back to negotiation diplomacy talk this is what perhaps is the way forward if mr. Bolton has it in him to even take a step back and think about what's going on absolutely I mean we have now the anniversary of the us-led invasion of Iraq and it has not been only a disaster in humanitarian and moral terms with hundreds of thousands of people maybe 1 million Iraqis killed in its wake but it also has been a strategic disaster for the United States because basically what has happened after the mid-2000s and that Iran could establish itself as the prime power in West Asia so also strategically speaking it has been a disasters something that John Bolton was very much advocating and supporting so to do the same again on Iran would be a huge mistake as well in both humanitarian terms and also strategic terms when it comes to the stability of the region so one would only hope that trumps pick is driven by personal preferences and it will not translate into a policy that is far more hawkish than we have seen so far just very briefly we've heard John Bolton being very critical of Iran is it just sabre-rattling or do you think the worst is yet to come I think for now it's early to tell because it can put a pressure on the Europeans to have more concessions on when it comes to the Iran nuclear deal but what is the most important factor is that John Bolton is really viewed to be on the side of this opposition totalitarian called the mko and so also for the Iranian state it will be more easy to crack down on dissidents because it would you know be easy to portray them as to be Stu - Stu tears of a new regime change policy from the United States where Bolton is instrumental well we shall see what does happen in the coming weeks and months and there unfortunately we have to leave it I think all of my guests Jim watch they embossed and Evan benzevich there in Singapore and Ali Fatah Nejad here with me in the studio in Doha thank you for all of my guests for joining me on this edition of inside store and of course thank you for watching as well you can see the program again any time by visiting our website at aljazeera.com and for further discussion go to our Facebook page at facebook.com forward slash AJ insights story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle there is at age 8 inside story from meeting Sahil Raman and all of the inside story team thanks very much for your time and your company you you
