and joining me now is former VA secretary David Shulkin mr. Joffe can how do you know that you were fired over what you say was your opposition to privatizing the VA well I think that the president made a decision on who he wants to represent Veteran Affairs in the cabinet that's that's a decision the president makes there was clear evidence though that the political appointees inside VA were working against me and my leadership team because they felt that we were trying to strengthen the VA rather than move it towards privatization I mean I I'm a little confused about how this state of affairs comes about you you you haven't really named names you're saying there are individuals you know who they are who were working at cross-purposes to essentially sabotage you I'm absolutely saying that and the names have been named they there are documents that have been shared and published they're in the they're in the newspapers right now that show the political appointees who have written memos to try to disrupt the operations at VA and we've been focused on trying to make the progress that our veterans need to be able to fulfill the mission that this country owes the responsibility to take care of those who have served well you just tell me the names of these individuals I'm not going to start naming names right here but but they're all available they've been published in the New York Times has it and others has it as well they are people that have represented the office of public affairs they're the White House representatives who are in VA a number of them have already been identified does this come altum Utley from the White House do you believe the President of the United States was essentially favored this agenda the USA was sort of a fifth column inside your own your own Department no I don't I don't have any evidence that that's the case I think that the president wants to improve care for veterans I think that he has not served well by political appointees or taking their own personal agendas much further than I think that he intended them to when's the last time you spoke to him I spoke to the president yesterday what was that conversation like we spoke about the progress that I was making what I needed to do from a policy perspective to make sure that we were fixing the issues in VA very focused he was very inquisitive about the things that we were working on making sure that we were focused on the job at hand wait that's before you were fired that's correct you spoke to him he made no mention of the fact that he was about to terminate you that's correct and then you found out via tweet right before that the chief of staff Kelly gave me a call which I appreciate it gave me a heads-up and so but but that was much after the phone call what was the president receptive to the what you were saying on that phone calls you were updating him on the improvements he say you were making at the VA I think that the it was a normal conversation with the president where where he asked me what was going on this is not atypical I gave him the updates and told him where we were focused and he had questions about that and there was a very interactive exchange as we normally have our discussions does the president understand the nuts and bolts of how the VA functions and what you were doing there I think that this is a very complex organization and from the outside it seems easy why aren't things fixed faster the truth is is that the VA has had systemic problems for decades which spans multiple administrations and in order to get this fixed I believe I was on the right track which is working in a bipartisan way with Congress doing what the veterans groups wanted us to do which is to strengthen the VA at the same time giving additional choice in the private sector and this is a very complex formula to move an organization this big in the type of transformation that it needs to undergo you were on a phone call of the president was easy we're now in retrospect understanding that was a call the president was calling to fire you and just never got around to it look I don't know what his intention was I take it at face value that that he was thinking about veterans that day picked up the phone to ask me a series of questions and then later on that that afternoon decided that he felt that it was time for a change so you know I'm not good at the crystal ball game I'm just I've been here to try to focus on veteran issues I don't do politics very well obviously but the important thing is is is that we have to get this organization working again I wanna I want to pivot back to that but you just said you don't do politics well and I want to ask about the Inspector General's report because the sort of the the putative reason that someone could point to that you were you were dismissed is there as inspector general's report is very critical of you and particularly your chief of staff for a public trip you took to England with your wife in which there were wimbledon tickets that have been acquired for airfare as well and travel paid for by public money subsequently reimbursed do you deny that you did anything wrong in that trip yes listen here's what happened this was a trip of the five allies that had been going on for 43 years attended always by the United States as the major force in the Allied forces we had forty hours of lectures I did at least three hours of those lectures myself a meaningful exchange the only government money involved was a single coach airfare for my wife she was invited officially VA secretaries have always brought their wives were officially invited it was pre-approved by the ethics officials there were no surprises here no one raised any concerns this was done a hundred percent proper in retrospect six months later when the IG looked at this report they found that the staff had made a mistake when that came out I wrote a check to the US government and paid back every penny but there were no other expenses the Wimbledon tickets were no expense to the government they were a Saturday afternoon with our friends no business involved there was nothing wrong with that just I want to follow up because the Inspector General report did say that your chief of staff essentially changed records and an email to essentially cover-up well the expenditure is that true is that was that wrong well listen if you change records of course that's wrong but the Inspector General report also said very clearly that wasn't involved in that I had no knowledge of that right and and and so you know I think that the chief of staff decided to retire rather than go through a full investigation but look I have you know you know I had very strong confidence in her okay your understanding and I think you said this explicitly that the IG report and the stories about the trip were essentially an attempt to get rid of you that variable there's no question about it this was politicized the political appointees within the VA that did not like the type of progress that we're making do you know that were you watching this happening you were saying the people who work in the building with me who are appointees of the president are actively trying to get me fired right now through this yes that is correct and reporting to who was there what why were they to whom did they report this to well the political appointees have dual roles to the administration at the White House and also back into the department and of course you know you can't run the department like this with people pursuing their own agendas so so this was a major concern and this is what I've been dealing with the last couple months which is why I said that it was very difficult to get the type of work done that we needed there get done there were stories in the newspaper saying you have centrally had lost it then you would become paranoid that you had an armed guard outside your door what's your response to that well listen this is just all part of the nonsense that they do in in Washington there were no changes to my security protocol guess what every cabinet secretary has armed guards we're all in presidential succession but there was no changes in any of my security at all okay if this is a situation you are working in this what sounds like a hornet's nest you're saying is there's these people that are trying to undermine you sabotage you they are appointees of prezi United States you're talking to the president did you talk to the President or chief of staff Kelly and say this is outrageous I can't work like this this is bad for the veterans we serve yes I did and what was their response their response was was that I needed to do what I needed to do again the organization back on track and when I tried to do that there were people that were blocking that so this was I want to be clear here the president specifically the president said do we have to do to get on track but did not intervene to break this bizarre standoff that you were happening inside having inside your department well look I wouldn't expect the president of that to do that the president's always been clear with me that he wanted to make progress and make progress fast at the VA something that I shared but you know working in an organization where people have multiple agendas is always tough I don't think that that that this is unusual circumstance but I think that in this circumstance in the politicized environment that we have in Washington this became a pretty significant issue and one that I was determined that we were going to get back on track unfortunately the president made a decision that he wanted to go a different direction how did those people this final question on this and then I want to ask about your successor how did those people get those jobs who recommended them who put their resumes in front of the chief of staff were the folks in the White House to put them at the VA yeah the way that this works is after after the inauguration all the departments get large numbers of political employee appointees sent to them most of them come from the campaign who were moved into the administration that's how we got all of our political appointees Ronnie Jackson who is the president's personal physician was the president's personal decision before this he has been nominated to your job he has never as far as I can tell being an administrator you're both if I'm not mistaken both the physician and have been a hospital administrator have some familiarity with the difficulties and the complications of that is your successor qualified for your job well look I know dr. Jackson personally he's a guy with high integrity a very honorable man this is a tough job for anybody to take on this is the second largest department in government it's almost a two hundred billion dollar budget with three hundred and seventy thousand people dr. Jackson I believe is going to do this with the right intention he's going to need a lot of help around him and the team around him to be successful and I certainly believe that I will do everything I can to make sure that that is that he is doing the job he needs to do but it's certainly the case that if what you are saying is true and I don't have any independent way of confirming it but if what you're saying is true that he can't possibly succeed in the mission of strengthening a VA if the same people are there who you say are actively working to subvert that purpose so that the place can be privatized well I I think it's clear that that VA needs to rid itself of people that aren't there for the sole intention of focusing on improving services and care for veterans and nobody should tolerate this type of pullet is a ssin of an important department like VA alright former VA secretary David Shulkin thank you very much for making time tonight thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
