12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,000
fan<font color="#CCCCCC"> of glossy stuff so I really had to</font>

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,059
find the matte finish one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it feels</font>

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,100
so nice sometimes I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch myself</font>

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,950
touching as it goes it's just so smooth

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,010
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found this case in green hills for</font>

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,200
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> 600 pesos I just found it in one of</font>

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,260
those random chunky areas I was even

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,800
able to handle it used to be 800 pesos

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,809
and then I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle it down to</font>

21
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,989
such a red besos so yeah I am very happy

22
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this case next up we have lip balm</font>

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,049
so i alternate between two different lip

24
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,360

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,880
lip balm it's the strawberry flavor it

is super<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and this is my everyday</font>

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,390
lip balm it has a nice red tint to it so

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't even need to wear lipstick it</font>

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">already adds a natural color to my lips</font>

30
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,840
so yeah that is why this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my everyday</font>
