hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report let's talk about the overall economy how's it doing max we're talking about the GDP now forecast Atlanta office of the Federal Reserve predicting a 5.4 percent GDP in q1 2018 Preston J Byrne responds wow these are Reagan early 1980s numbers that's a lot of growth brought on by policies that would stimulate growth and so what is the opposition gonna say to try to make this sound bad I don't know well I imagine your guests in the second half is going to say the Atlanta Fed has always had an outlier of saying wow the economy is booming and in fact they'll have to revise it down to like two or three percent right now they're saying is five point four percent it could just be a parting gift for Janet Yellen who was the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve I gonna pull up my collar and honor her you know as she is you know Vulcan or something I have no idea but she does seem to prefer putting her little collars up not assets she wears pantsuits again with the pantsuits look all this growth is also being reflected in the rising yields of the bond market or falling prices which is an indication of inflation and of course that would put the kibosh on a 38 year old bond bull market and that brings all kinds of new wrinkles and twists and turns to this stock and bond markets of course the markets have been kind of tumbling relative to what they're used to they're not real tumbles of the 1987 magnitude that you're used to which would be a 6,000 point drop but you know markets or certainly the media gets quite hysterical when it falls like $200 200 points which is a fraction of a percent so the markets have responded negatively to like the positive job numbers that also came out last week this GDP forecast being forecast higher all these you know bonuses that major corporations are giving their employees the tax cuts those were all priced in last year and now they're kind of I guess some say seeing inflation on the horizon and that this is going to be negative for bonds and markets well yeah you know Wall Street and Main Street tend to go at odds with each other what's good for one is usually not good for the other and if Wall Street's going to take a breather with rising rates and falling stock and bond prices that would generally mean rising relative strength in wages so those are the voters that put this guy in office back in 2016 and they'll do it again in 2020 if wages are going up 2018 is a little bit more important that's the midterm elections coming up this September this November so we'll see what happens there but here's another tweets regarding the markets and the economy and this is unreal another five billion dollars into ETFs last night brings January total to seventy eight point six billion dollars which destroys all-time monthly flow record by eighteen billion dollars or thirty percent this is nearly four billion dollars per day pace retail investors are pouring into ETFs you know they're the Millennials really love these ETFs with the to the top two recipients of the of these funds flowing into Egypt where State Street's sp500 ETF and then shares sp500 ETF so they're going for the S&P 500 ETFs the next the previous largest inflow of ETFs funds was in December 2016 well it's very dangerous because this a multitude of ETS would have the same stock in their ATF so you'd have multiple claims on the same stock it's a fractional reserve model and so if there is a downturn let's say the market dropped 20 25 30 percent and there's liquidation and he's trying to liquidate these ETFs and 10 or 20 ETFs on the same thousand shares of IBM or General Electric or Microsoft which one truly has those shares them have it for sure and it's a compounding of the cascade as it drops down into a black call called a era Dima Balma catastrophe sucking sound posing as the grim reaper as they rapaciously steal from the millennials their hard-earned cappuccino money in one fell swoop due to their over exuberance brought on by the cheap rates engineered by the central bankers who have no accountability other than their academic overlords who write Keynesian based falled or all in their textbooks based on theories that have never been proven and always end up catastrophic Lee well of course they've been a perfect contrarian indicator these Millennials they have stayed out of the market since 2008 in fear for a crash and now they have finally gone long as we covered in a previous episode they somehow believe that donald trump provides some sort of insulation i have no idea what they mean when they say they they think he provides insulation to the markets nevertheless this is what they're pouring their money into etf's now as somebody's selling to them it's like wearing a Donald Trump rubber mask in a bathtub while throwing a toaster plugged into the wall and saying I don't know why I got electrocuted I had this Donald Trump rubber mask on wasn't I insulated there is another interesting story out in the past week as well and that was from China and Zero Hedge covered that Chinese stocks tumble as Hong Kong officials monitor surge in ATM withdrawals apparently there were reports of mainland Chinese citizens arriving in Hong Kong with like up to 50 bank cards so they would go to machine after machine and withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars this has been happening according to the Hong Kong monetary authorities there have been a few robberies they say of people of mainland Chinese with having hundreds of thousands of dollars stolen so there seems to be some sort of capital flight situation we don't know of course a lot of information that comes out of China is a hard to interpret well this is as much to do with money launderer capital flight the liquidation of stocks cryptocurrencies and now mass ATM withdrawals suggest more is going on than the usual pre-new year liquidity hoarding there's a mad dash for cash because the 38 year bull market and bonds looks like it's coming to an end inflation is upon us and bond prices are gonna fall they're already falling yields are rising of course I've been saying this for five years and others in the financial punditry space have been saying this for five years and have been wrong for five years so with that caveat I will emphatically once again say without equivocation that I could be wrong again that the bond market will not crash this time it'll continue yields will go even lower and negative yields on various bonds will increase from the multi trillion dollars with the negative yielding sovereign debt now to even more multi Multi multi trillion dollars of negative yielding sovereign debt and we're gonna go down the rabbit hole even further but it certainly smells like with the panic cash withdrawal and places like China and with the sell-off and all these various markets and with the oil prices climbing higher and gold looking better that we've got here an old-fashioned reversal it's a rotation well I want to actually turn to a tweet now that you posted yeah and this is a tweet I found interesting you also sent me some text message server yes but this is a tweet from Twitter so people could go there and look at this and that is Max Keiser store of value plus liquid means of exchange is got utility and it's a great investment it's portable fungible divisible and desirable yes that's more of laundry detergent and if you look closely you can see that this is a photo from a US supermarket somewhere the laundry detergent has to be tied down secured with locks and it's not just a marketing gimmick because it's called tied now I didn't mention name but even though you could see it I don't want to promote them - that's right even though that well there's a big in the news it was it covered people are eating and I forgot to add a table onto that yes edible edible now we've covered this actually before Lord your detergent like this in poor neighborhoods has been a currency for years and years it's you go in there you snap some of this laundry detergent and it's highly desirable which is any currency is desirable portable fungible and divisible and this is what in the ghetto in the in the slums in the poor areas is used as currency an entrepreneur can go into a bodega they can snatch some of this bodega bodega bodega but they go at the bodega goes go into the bodega and they have a nice bodacious sandwich oh and they rode out of the shop with their purloined laundry detergent you can quickly exchange that for a little crack or something and then mark that up for a few bucks and you're an entrepreneur you're on your way to being the next Donald Trump I think Trump got his way he got to be where he is actually all those tied together in the next headline because we have Deutsche Bank which Donald Trump owes 300 million dollars to we have a crime running away with ill-gotten gains and we have a fungible transferable get out of jail free card for these bankers and the headline reads from Reuters business US CFTC orders deutsche bank unit to pay seventy million dollar penalty penalty yes well this is a CFTC and they have basically find Deutsche Bank a civil fine of manipulating that is the fix benchmark between January 2007 and May 2012 so you know May 2012 long after they appeared before the public and prostrating themselves and said will never commit these crimes again we will never commit these crimes again well of course that is the fixed market is a many many many trillions if not quadrillions of dollars market and they rigged it for their own benefit to profit for the bank to profit on their own derivatives positions so here they are paying a small fine we don't know they didn't they didn't say in their statements how much they gained from rigging is the fix but they're paying a seventy million dollar fine and to the ordinary person who's running off with some laundry detergent as their own fungible transferable tradable currency well they thank well 70 million dollars well that sounds like that's like 35 350,000 gallons of liquid laundry detergent as you point out this is coming after all these banks promised not to do all these crimes again going back to the 2008 period you know what index or fix hasn't been ranked is the LIBOR Forex gold and silver now multiple banks have been finally irrevocably irrefutably convicted or found to be guilty of fixing those prices and they pay it fine now if you apply the same justice to the people that were stealing the laundry detergent from various shops in the ghetto you would go to them and say hey man don't steal everything from the store and they would give you like ten bucks and say here's my fine here's a ten buck fine leave me alone don't bother me I got stuff to do and then they would do this crime these prison population and the cost of prison population would die would go down substantially if they apply the same sense of justice to people stealing stuff from stores as they do when they allow banks to commit larceny and wholesale theft willy-nilly without any deterrent whatsoever think of the jails would be only half empty or a quarter empty just oh you know charge people a small fine and allow them to go steal from their moms and Grandma to pay that fine like the banks do to pay the fines these banks steel in the open market from each other from the public from their families from Donald Trump they're serial fraudsters and that's what they used to pay their fines and the regulators say I love you so much for the way that you're abusing me because I'm a child and I don't know how to respond to the way that you bankers are absolutely you know at serial rapaciousness but if it wasn't for fraud there would be no economy hey we got to go to the second half don't go away stay right there welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time had to go to Chicago and talk with mich shed lock of mich talk.com mich welcome back and pleasure to be back on max we're seeing some fireworks their little volatility what do you think that's going to do to all the European funds short selling volatility I'm gonna get smashed on this trade max yeah that's an interesting idea there's been a trade on for a few years now in the hedge fund community in particular where they are short volatility they're short the VIX and this has been highly profitable for a few years and the VIX made a huge leap on the upside and I guess what you're suggesting there is you got some blood in the street now with that particular trade well so where do you see this market going mish it depends there they typically what we've seen is just a one-day pull back and then renewed highs but we're seeing what down a few days in a row the dow as we're talking here is down 500 points we're not sure where it's going to close that's a pretty significant move it was down over 300 points a couple days ago so we're seeing the start of something here what these hedge funds are doing max is their attitude is whenever volatility spikes they just short more up and more of it well max if you keep doing enough of that you're eventually gonna get blown out of the water and I actually think that's gonna happen right there's a martingale system of betting yeah you're constantly doubling down on a betting on red at the roulette wheel with the idea that eventually you will win before you run out of money but this is what you have in an environment where you can borrow money from the Fed at 0% interest rates and you can borrow virtually unlimited amount of money from the Fed at 0% interest rates the martingale strategy of betting is a winner because you never run out of money and that's why we've seen these incredible dislocations in these markets and a collapse of capitalism as we know it but let's talk about GDP the Atlanta Fed says a q1 2018 will show and pretty remarkable 5.4 percent growth your thoughts pretty remarkable how about it I don't know I suppose by some perversion it can happen I mean you and I are not responsible for being able to measure this thing they are but what we've typically seen a three in a row or maybe even four out of five the Atlanta Fed comes out early in the early in the early to start of the quarter with these remarkable forecasts you know they were there were four percent to start of the last one it came in 2.6 now they're five point four percent I like every time these reports come out max III feel as like I'm betting on a spread the over-under line at a football game in the NFL and I made my typical comment here about the Atlanta Fed model it was I'll take the under way under you know this is an over/under batting line and the line is five point four percent max it does portend some inflation and we've had a 38 year bull market and bonds going all the way back to 1980 with Volcker was the Federal Reserve Chairman Reagan was in office and we've had a bull market and bonds ever since then and we have zero wrenches straights we talked about in some countries dial interest rates are negative but so the question is with rates now climbing higher is this finally the end of that bull market what do you see their mission I don't know but I don't think so people are claiming Bill Gross has claimed I believe this is the third time now max the end of the bond bull market well maybe he's right this time but maybe he's not certainly we are seeing an inflation scare if nothing else here maybe the real deal and maybe the real deal through maybe the real deal for a quarter but what happens if the Fed hikes once too much starts the recession as the next recession is baked into the cake you're gonna blame it on the Fed for hiking one time too much and that's not what's gonna have done it it's going to be all the excesses the Fed is created in this bubble just like they created the dot-com bubble and the housing bubble you know the everything bubble max so and people are gonna say we raised rates one time too many they'll probably blame it on the the new incoming Fed share power but this this was baked in the cake under janet yong with these baby steps just as greenspan did until a housing bubble finally blew up did the same thing under Yellen so what's gonna happen over here this is the question max if we get an asset bubble if stocks start falling and more importantly if commercial real estate and oil prices start falling again what's second or two to bank profits what's that gonna do to their ability then you're gonna become banks you're gonna become capital impaired we're gonna be in the same situation or a similar situation we were in in in 2007 asset place is fine no one wants to buy loan borrow money so what's the Fed gonna do but they're gonna cut rates that's how I see it and and actually if the asset bubble gets big enough actually think we're going to see outright deflation so the feds move maneuvers to prevent deflation or what's gonna cause it in my opinion right I've said that many times the feds attempt to fight deflation actually cause the deflation and Danny branch flower always jumps in on Twitter and says that's crazy talk but you know that's exactly what's going on but let's return to this martingale betting theme which is that you can keep doubling down on a bad bet until it becomes a winning bet you mentioned that stocks pull back on a one-day situation then hit new highs you talked about the housing bubble in 2006-2007 it looks like we're returning to that kind of era and all of this if you were to point to one common theme or this source for all of this global asset inflation and you'd have to come back to the Bank of Japan you know Bank of Japan has been the go-to currency the driving this entire bubble anomic sand the top of everything and now they've recently said mish they're proposing to spend quote unlimited amounts buying their 10-year bonds at 0.11% so if that is that so if their kid is still doing that missed and then yeah this is just gonna continue on for a while right it wasn't even a that's the funny thing they came out and said that three days ago right I said hmm haven't we heard this message sure before yeah and indeed we did I went back then I and I looked and I found a they said the same thing in Financial Times report I think it was August I think of last year what when they said they probably said it before that so now they've drawn this line in the sand max it's at 0.11% so I started my blog yesterday and I said hmm what's the message here that that Japan can't stand a 1 basis point rise in in in bond deals on 10 years as a G the the 10-year note in Japan must be really attractive at point 1 1 % all of these fund managers you know in Japan want to hold on to these things no one else in the right mind has them anywhere else in the world so you know so I did the sarcastic post max on my blog and I said why does it why does Japan you know threaten to you know just buy all of these at this floor why does they just do it max go out there and just buy every bond why not the you know of course some fund managers might not want to give up those attractive yield 1.1.11 percent yielding bonds on 10 years so I said the way they can get them to release them max is is if they tax anyone who holds bonds at 1% now these guys are losing percent a year on these things we're gonna unload the things in the mask in master Bank of Japan can buy them all up every one of them now look at the beauty of this max we can finally test MMT the monetary theory that that government spending doesn't matter and we owe it to ourselves is after they buy the wall up they can cancel all of the debt null and void let's do it max what do you say let's test mmm - mmm tea now what do you sell your pants get the highest debt to GDP they've got the highest debt - versus you know their central bank all these bonds bonds cancel the debt married start with a clean slate let's do it let's go for it and and I propose one more step while they're at it why don't they just buy up all the debt of corporations - given that they're buying all these stocks will we know as is what the the Swiss National Bank yes this is what mmt says we can do well I mean okay so just to follow up on that the reason why that the problem there is that these deaths have been rehypothecation in pledged against other assets and banks all over the world so cancelling Japan's debt would in effect put the global economy into a freefall and it would immediately come to a grinding halt because of the fraud that happens on the subject we might think that this isn't what the MMD's there's before we have to leave it now let's talk about something that's I think the most ridiculously off the charts nonsense I've seen in quite some time and you know I know you tweet a lot about Bitcoin I talk a lot about Bitcoin you know you see Bitcoin as being fantastical and not you've comment but compared to this story mesh it makes Bitcoin look like a triple a gilded bond okay your own state of Illinois they have a plan to fill the pension black hole by selling a hundred and seven billion in bonds and then using the proceeds to buy stocks better now at all-time highs I mean mish what are you smoke it over there in Illinois a little bit a few days ago the the it is kind of amusing what I proposed there their idea there was gonna float a hundred and seven billion in barns and they were gonna use it to buy stocks now my guess is the interest rate would be seven percent probably greater I think it would spook the bond market especially right now but but let's assume they could borrow these things at 6% they would need to have 6% returns just to break even my proposal was was similar to the Bank of Japan's proposal was was to buy those bonds and and do something different you know you know through a billion dollars in the month on on mixed best that it's not gonna sink but gonna rise my god they would have made a fortune this month here already if they could a dollar well no that's not what they want to do they want to buy this money and do the same old thing meanwhile Illinois is pensions are what forty percent funded or so assets where where sanada believe that's what they claim but the next downturn is gonna kill mich we got to say goodbye we're gonna pick this up again you've got a wealth of information but we just are out of time thanks for being on all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser reportable to me max geyser and Stacy ever I'd like to think I guess mish shed lock if you want to find us on Twitter go to cause a report on Twitter yeah until next time bye yeah you
