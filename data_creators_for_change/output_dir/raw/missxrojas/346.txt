calcifications can be taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

50
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,830
seriously throughout the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

Exeter now I did it

66
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,680
I regret<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing but all throughout</font>

67
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,180
first year I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was on the proofreading</font>

68
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,680
team it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

69
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
first many hours you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to prove me</font>

70
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issue and they would order pizza and</font>

71
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,330
if ever there when the pizza there I was

72
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,700
really good good times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that period</font>

73
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,380
of time I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so adjusting to how I was</font>

74
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,759
going to ban to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create about what I did</font>

75
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to review to burn through my writing</font>

76
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,000
with what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do at University</font>

77
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,410
and also with why I was having to

78
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,930
provide in terms of essays and homework

79
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and research and that sort of thing but</font>

80
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,380
as I'm still writing for other outlets I

81
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,030
didn't think it was a huge loss but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

82
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">you haven't written for anything before</font>

83
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,700
it's a great idea to get starting

84
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,319
student newspaper especially if you're

85
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,760
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know things like journalism</font>

86
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
where you have to show a keen interest

87
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,870
throughout your mind a lot of you like

88
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,030
crazy Claire 88 like the headband in my

89
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,910
last video I would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the little</font>

someone gets romney look it was in the

92
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,080
sale i think was about to bounce I

93
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't ever really go into you look and</font>

94
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,959
then I went in and suddenly these things

95
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,640
that I really liked were just there in

96
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,530
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me pulling my name's they often</font>

97
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,330
do clothes I loads and loads and loads

98
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,069
of people have asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the course of</font>

99
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,390
my videos during my time at<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it's okay they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like going</font>

101
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,350
out of course it's completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font>

102
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,640
you don't like going out and you will

103
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,049
find other people that don't like going

104
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,000
out as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a huge</font>

105
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
problem within maybe nerdier communities

106
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,799
is there seems to be this great project

107
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,690
to attack people who do like going out

108
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,160
and who do like drinking you do like

109
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,810
dancing who do like age club and as

110
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,220
someone who falls into that cash<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font>

111
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,660
and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody falls into that</font>

112
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,010
category<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel a little</font>

113
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,720

114
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,310

115
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's the wisest thing to do</font>

116
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,150
all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just sit in the words</font>

of wil wheaton it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not to like</font>

118
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,120
things just don't be a dick about it

119
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">something now more than at any other</font>

120

<font color="#E5E5E5">other situations where a parent failure</font>

124

has made you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> about us because</font>

I<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like knowing about this could be</font>

126
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,680
really helpful to me I think translating

127
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,480
that sense of failure into a sense of

128
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplishment is something that you do</font>

129

getting into Harvard Yale Princeton

132

Stanford which will few months later it

133
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,410
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt like I'd learned from</font>

134
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,670
that first experience and I was

135
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,410
disappointed by the same time it wasn't

136
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,450
soul crushingly hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> dying Lee</font>

137
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,380
devastating

138
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,670
is that you've all seen it by now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

accomplishment even with the rejection

150
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,620
from all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> US universities because I</font>

151

said to myself I had done<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>
