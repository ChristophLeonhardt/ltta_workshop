a Missouri lawmaker wanted to show just how against abortion he is by killing a live animal on camera yeah all right so the video that we're about to show you is graphic it's difficult to watch especially if you are believe in animal rights and you don't like watching animals getting killed uh but this is a Missouri State Representative Mike moon he is a Republican and in the past he has supported legislation that essentially grants a zygote a the same constitutional rights as a living breathing viable human being and he makes his you know extreme point of view very evident in the video you're about to watch let's just take a quick look when the governor called to the second special session this year I was right in the middle of a summer job but like any good career politician when I get the call and one after work God be even man dominion over life he allows us to I had to cut out of it early you get the point he later on starts talking about abortion as he's cutting this chicken into pieces um think ripped his heart out all this time yeah okay so he's getting criticism forward he's like oh the people criticizing me probably don't understand what abortion is yeah abortions a little different right um there's a difference between a living thing which by the way I mean I'm not a vegetarian so I know that it's a little hypocritical for me to be like you know a chick is a living thing but it's different for as I know it's different from a zygote it's different from a zygote if that woman right somehow expelled that zygote from her body it would not be a living breathing viable thing it wouldn't be it wouldn't be it's not the same thing I am so tired of these middle-aged white dudes trying to pretend like they know anything about Anatomy you know nothing you know nothing killing a chicken for such shock value isn't gonna help your cause at least among people who know the difference between a zygote and a living breathing human thing that isn't attached to something in order to survive we just had a conversation about art our criminal system in our jails and how we throw lives away so quickly that way as long as to make some money was he outraged when an unborn baby died uh inch one of Sheriff Clark's prisons in Milwaukee was he outraged by it did he say a single word about it did he denounce sheriff Clark about it a woman went into labor in an in a prison in Milwaukee begged for medical attention she's going into labor begging for medical attention did this guy say anything about it she was denied medical attention her baby died but I don't hear any conservatives talking about it I mean conservatives can't stop fellating sheriff Clark they can't get enough right you really care about life you really care about life you guys run around talking about individuals who need public assistance as if they're like you know the bane of your existence you don't care about okay for a second let's just take all that away this argument isn't even clear so to be a what the villain yes he obviously I was like Oh Anna Anna got it cool because Amir and I talked about on pop true today and we ended up in some wackadoodle discussion about was it the chicken or the egg you know why because this isn't a clear argument like I'm very impressed that you were even able to mature to draw the conclusions you were able to draw from that video because I watch it I was like wait man has dominion over life but isn't he technically pro-choice because he's choosing to end the life of that chicken like what is happening my exact doesn't make sense to me and he's saying that he he came back from his summer job as a chicken farmer maybe okay but what does that have to do with you being a representative and you also you're not complaining but at the same time you are kind of complaining because you know you're one of those things it's like I don't mind coming back from the set like dude it I just can't believe that you even understood what if the point he was trying to make I have no what was happening I understand his point simply because I know who he is and I know what type of policies he's pushed for in the past so even though his argument doesn't make a lot of sense I know what he's trying to get at and look my biggest issue is that we're supposed to live in a country that is not dictated by any one religion so if you have a religious issue with abortion I totally understand don't have abortions don't you don't have abortions your wife shouldn't have an abortion there's chicken women around you who also believe in your religion your religion shouldn't have abortions I would never go to a woman who's pro-life who's pregnant and pro-life or anti-abortion and tell them no my religion says that you have to get an abortion overpopulation unacceptable abortion right now we're not the Young Turks you're The Young Turks you power this show together we build something amazing we broken stories like the
