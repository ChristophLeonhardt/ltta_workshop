I WAS WATCHING THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT IN BILLINGS, MONTANA.

59
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,049
LAST NIGHT IN BILLINGS, MONTANA. IT WAS HIS DELIVERY AROUND THE

MAXINE -- MAXIME WATERS. HOW DO YOU IMPEACH SOMEONE WHO

69
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:24,746
HOW DO YOU IMPEACH SOMEONE WHO IS DOING A GOOD JOB?

70
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,313
IS DOING A GOOD JOB? THE ECONOMY IS GOOD.

WE WILL IMPEACH HIM. BUT HE’S DOING A GREAT JOB.

76
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:34,222
BUT HE’S DOING A GREAT JOB. IT’S SO RIDICULOUS.

77
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,257
IT’S SO RIDICULOUS. BUT WE’LL WORRY ABOUT THAT IF IT

78
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:36,925
BUT WE’LL WORRY ABOUT THAT IF IT EVER HAPPENS.

79

> GENERATIONALLY, THAT’S A SET HE’S DOING.

94
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,119
HE’S DOING. THAT’S A SET PIECE.

95
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:06,654
THAT’S A SET PIECE. THAT’S BORDERLINE STANDUP.

96
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,422
THAT’S BORDERLINE STANDUP. >> YEAH, I MEAN WHAT HE’S DOING

97
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,025
>> YEAH, I MEAN WHAT HE’S DOING IS THE SORTS OF PEOPLE THAT HE

98
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,960
IS THE SORTS OF PEOPLE THAT HE WATCHED ON TV STARTING IN THE

99
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:13,728
WATCHED ON TV STARTING IN THE LATE 50s INTO THE EARLY ’70s AND

100
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,530
LATE 50s INTO THE EARLY ’70s AND REALLY ALTHOUGH I MEAN

101
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:17,065
REALLY ALTHOUGH I MEAN TECHNICALLY HE DOESN’T DRINK, IS

102
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,967
TECHNICALLY HE DOESN’T DRINK, IS HE YOUR UNCLE SITTING BY THE

103
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,969
HE YOUR UNCLE SITTING BY THE POOL WITH A BEER, THAT BEER IS

104
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,938
POOL WITH A BEER, THAT BEER IS LIKELY A BUDWEISER AND HE’S JUST

105
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,840
LIKELY A BUDWEISER AND HE’S JUST KIND OF RUNNING HIS MOUTH IN A

106
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,641
KIND OF RUNNING HIS MOUTH IN A COLORFUL WAY AND ENJOYING THE

107
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:28,443
COLORFUL WAY AND ENJOYING THE ATTENTION OF HIS LITTLE NIECES

108
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:30,278
ATTENTION OF HIS LITTLE NIECES AND THE TEENAGER FROM NEXT DOOR.

109
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,447
AND THE TEENAGER FROM NEXT DOOR. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS,

110
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:34,282
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS, THAT IT SHOWS SOMETHING MORE

111
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:35,450
THAT IT SHOWS SOMETHING MORE GENERAL ABOUT HIM.

112
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:36,384
GENERAL ABOUT HIM. THIS GOES BEYOND LANGUAGE.

113
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:38,887
THIS GOES BEYOND LANGUAGE. I CANNOT THINK OF A PRESIDENT IN

114
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:41,490
I CANNOT THINK OF A PRESIDENT IN THE GRAND SUCCESS WE’VE HAD WHO

115
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,492
THE GRAND SUCCESS WE’VE HAD WHO HAS SPENT SO LITTLE EFFORT IN

116
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,193
HAS SPENT SO LITTLE EFFORT IN TRYING TO BE SOMETHING LARGER

117
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:47,095
TRYING TO BE SOMETHING LARGER THAN THAT SWIMMING POOL

118
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:47,796
THAN THAT SWIMMING POOL BUDWEISER BAKE.

119
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,298
BUDWEISER BAKE. HE NEVER TRIES.

120
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,001
HE NEVER TRIES. SO YOU THINK OF SAY ARISTOCRAT

121
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,870
SO YOU THINK OF SAY ARISTOCRAT LIKE FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT WHO

122
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:55,670
LIKE FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT WHO FORGED THE NEW DEAL.

123
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:57,105
FORGED THE NEW DEAL. HE WASN’T THINKING ABOUT THAT

124
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,540
HE WASN’T THINKING ABOUT THAT WHEN HE WAS A KID.

125
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,509
WHEN HE WAS A KID. JOHN F. KENNEDY, TO TELL THE

126
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,910
JOHN F. KENNEDY, TO TELL THE TRUTH, THERE WEREN’T A LOT OF

THINGS WILL HE HIS MIND ON TILL HE BECAME PRESIDENT.

129
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,249
HE BECAME PRESIDENT. HE WAS ABOUT TO DO GREAT THINGS.

130
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:09,084
HE WAS ABOUT TO DO GREAT THINGS. LYNDON JOHNS WAS SOMEBODY WHO

131
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,287
LYNDON JOHNS WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS A VERY PAROCHIAL UNEDUCATED

132
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,522
WAS A VERY PAROCHIAL UNEDUCATED BIGOTED TEXAN AND THE GREAT

133
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:15,157
BIGOTED TEXAN AND THE GREAT SOCIETY COMES FROM HIM.

134
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,325
SOCIETY COMES FROM HIM. DONALD TRUMP NEVER DOES ANYTHING

135
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,092
DONALD TRUMP NEVER DOES ANYTHING THAT STRETCHES BEYOND EXACTLY

136
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:19,128
THAT STRETCHES BEYOND EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS WHEN.

137
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:21,262
WHAT HE WAS WHEN. I HAVE THIS ON GOOD AUTHORITY.

138
00:04:21,297 --> 00:04:23,899
I HAVE THIS ON GOOD AUTHORITY. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO TOOK A

139
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,634
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO TOOK A RATHER GENTLE CHILD IN HIS

140
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:27,102
RATHER GENTLE CHILD IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN HE WAS A

141
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,938
NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER AND HUNG THAT KID OUT

142
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,606
TEENAGER AND HUNG THAT KID OUT THE WINDOW BY HIS FEET AND

143
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,141
THE WINDOW BY HIS FEET AND ENJOYED WATCHING HIM YELL.

144
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:33,676
ENJOYED WATCHING HIM YELL. HAVE I IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY,

145
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,945
HAVE I IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY, BELIEVE ME AS TRUMP SAYS.

146
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,848
BELIEVE ME AS TRUMP SAYS. HE’S NEVER GOTTEN BEYOND BEING

147
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,749
HE’S NEVER GOTTEN BEYOND BEING THAT LITTLE NOSE PICKING JERK.

148
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:42,251
THAT LITTLE NOSE PICKING JERK. HE’S JUST EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS

149
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,986
HE’S JUST EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS WHEN HE BEGAN.

150
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,654
WHEN HE BEGAN. IT STRIKES ME THAT EVEN AFTER

151
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:47,456
IT STRIKES ME THAT EVEN AFTER ALMOST TWO YEARS, HE’S NEVER HAD

152
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:49,058
ALMOST TWO YEARS, HE’S NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST IMPULSE TO GROW.

153
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,527
THE SLIGHTEST IMPULSE TO GROW. THAT’S WHAT YOU SEE IN HIS

154
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:51,927
THAT’S WHAT YOU SEE IN HIS AURATORY.

155
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:53,529
AURATORY. HE GETS UP THERE AND TALKS

156
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,431
HE GETS UP THERE AND TALKS WHETHER HE ANY OTHER PRESIDENT,

157
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:57,466
WHETHER HE ANY OTHER PRESIDENT, I’M SURE ZACK RIL TAYLOR TRIED

158
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:01,904
I’M SURE ZACK RIL TAYLOR TRIED TO OH RATE.

159
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:02,371
TO OH RATE. HERE WE ARE.

>> YOU JUST SAID BELIEVE ME. THAT’S A VERBAL TICK OF HIS.

162
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,042
THAT’S A VERBAL TICK OF HIS. I’LL USE HIS METHOD TO MAKE A

163
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:06,375
