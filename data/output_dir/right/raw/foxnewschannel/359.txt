FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR

00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:05,840
FOR HARRY REID.

4
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:07,208
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

5
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,910
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THIS

6
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:12,580

00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:17,552
FORD, ACCORDING TO LELAND KEYSERTRIED TO GET KEYSER TRIED TO GET

00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:17,553
TRIED TO GET KEYSER TRIED TO GET

10
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:18,620
HER TO CHANGE HER SWORN

11
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:20,255
TOMORROW, WHICH IS A CRIME.

12
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:21,189
IT’S WRONG.

13
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

14
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,359
>> WELL, I DON’T KNOW THAT I

15
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,527
AGREE IT’S A CRIME AND IT’S

16
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:27,229
SOMETHING THAT WE’VE SEEN ON

17
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,196
BOTH SIDES.

18
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,332
WE KNOW THAT KAVANAUGH WAS OFF

19
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,968
TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, SHE WAS

20
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,169
OFF TALKING TO HERS.

21
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,871
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN --

22
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:37,773
>> Tucker: I MEAN, I THINK I

23
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:38,807
FOLLOWED IT CLOSELY.

24
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:41,543
IS THERE AN ALLEGATION THAT

25
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:42,644
SOMEONE WAS PUSHED TO CHANGE

26
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:43,979
SWORN TESTIMONY?

27
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,347
>> THERE WAS TALK ABOUT

28
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:46,949
KAVANAUGH TALKING WITH HIS

29
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,684
FRIENDS THAT MIGHT BE APPROACHED

30
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:50,118
BY THE FBI.

31
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,086
THE WAY --

32
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:52,788
>> Tucker: BUT THEY --

33
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,089
>> THE SWORN TESTIMONY WAS NOT

34
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,725
THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE

35
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:57,426
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" --

36
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,527
>> Tucker: SHE SAID SHE WAS

37
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,029
PUSHED TO CHANGE --

38
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,830
>> SHE SAID SHE WAS ASKED TO

39
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:02,464
RE-VISIT HER ACCOUNT.

40
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,800
I’M NOT DOING TO DEFEND THAT.

41
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:05,901
IT’S NOT FOR ME.

42
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:06,735
I DON’T KNOW IF IT WAS THE RIGHT

43
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,470
THING NOR DO.

44
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:09,638
BOTH SIDES ARE GUILTY.

45
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:12,541
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS FOR

46
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,776
EVERY ONE TO TAKE A BREATH.

47
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:15,111
TAKE A STEP BACK.

48
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:16,746
ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME TO GO IN

49
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:18,281
AND INVESTIGATE ALL THE STUFF.

50
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,650
BOTH ON BEHALF OF THE ACCUSED

51
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,851
AND THE ACCUSER.

52
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,786
SO THERE COULD BE SOME CLARITY

53
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,054
BROUGHT TO THIS.

54
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,623
THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO BE HELD

55
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:28,024
ACCOUNTABLE.

56
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:29,292
THAT’S WHAT IS MISSING IN THIS

57
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:30,359
PROCESS BECAUSE THERE WAS A RUSH

58
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,661
TO GET IT DONE.

59
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,629
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE --

60
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,431
>> YEAH, ONLY SEVEN FBI

61
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:36,733
INVESTIGATIONS INTO KAVANAUGH.

62
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:38,334
I THINK WE WOULD NEED AN EIGHTH

63
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:40,036
FBI, TOO, TO CLEAR HIS NAME FROM
I THINK WE WOULD NEED AN EIGHTH

64
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:40,037
FBI, TOO, TO CLEAR HIS NAME FROM

65
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:42,705
CHARGES THAT DON’T MAKE ANY

66
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:43,006
SENSE.

67
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:47,744
>> AND HASTERT HAD CLEARANCE AND

68
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,612
HE WAS A CHILD MOLESTER --

69
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,381
>> Tucker: WHAT WE’RE NOT GOING

70
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:53,850
TO DO IS IMPUGN BRETT

71
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,585
KAVANAUGH’S REPUTATION BY

72
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:57,921
COMPARING HIM TO A CHILD

73
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:58,288
MOLESTER.

74
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,561
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

75
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:06,830
YOUR SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA,

76
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,965
JOE MANCHIN, ANNOUNCED HIS VOTE,
YOUR SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA,

77
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:08,966
JOE MANCHIN, ANNOUNCED HIS VOTE,

78
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,968
WHICH IS WHAT HIS VOTERS WANT

79
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,070
AND ANGRY LEFT WING CHILDREN

80
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,106
SURROUND HIM AND SCREAM AT HIM.

81
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:18,342
DOES THAT BOTHER YOU?

82
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:19,743
IS THAT THE KIND OF DEMOCRATIC

83
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:20,544
PROCESS THAT YOU WANT?

84
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,145
>> PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

85
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:27,985
TO APPROACH THEIR ELECTED

86
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:28,452
OFFICIALS --

87
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:29,753
>> Tucker: JOE MANCHIN --

88
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:31,021
>> NOT SCREAM.

89
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:31,421
I AGREE.

90
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:32,489
>> Tucker: I DEFEND THE FIRST

91
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,624
AMENDMENT THE WAY THE LEFT DOES

92
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:33,891
NOT.

93
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,926
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO IT, I

94
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:37,728
GUESS, BUT IS THAT WHAT YOU

95
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,028
WANT?

96
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:40,197
DO YOU WANT PEOPLE SCREAMING AT

97
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,131
LAWMAKERS UNTIL THEY CHANGE

98
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:41,865
THEIR VIEW?

99
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:46,303
IF THAT’S OKAY, WHY IS IT NOT

100
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:47,638
OKAY TO SLASH THEIR TIRES?

101
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,806
THROW MOLOTOV COCKTAILS?

102
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:50,241
IF YOU’RE GOING TO BULLY PEOPLE,

103
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,009
WHAT IS THE KIND OF LIMIT TO

104
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:52,309
THAT?

105
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,978
>> YOU HAVE BULLYING ON BOTH

106
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:54,278
SIDES.

107
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,212
WE KNOW --

108
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,213
>> Tucker: NO, YOU DON’T.

109
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:59,550
>> YOU ABSOLUTELY DO, TUCKER.

110
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:02,887
>> Tucker: SHOW ME THE MOBS OF

111
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:06,090
SCREAMING RIGHT WING CHILDREN --

112
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:08,192
>> IT’S A WASTE OF TIME TO

113
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:09,060
SCREAM AT MANCHIN.

114
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:10,995
HE VOTED THE WAY I EXPECTED ALL

115
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:11,496
THE TIME.

116
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:14,232
WHICH IS VIEWED BY HIM AS THE

117
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,166
POLITICALLY SAFE WAY TO GO.

118
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:18,536
I’M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH

119
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:21,406
SENATOR COLLINS, HOWKOWSKI AND

120
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:21,773
HEITKAMP.

121
00:03:21,774 --> 00:03:23,641
IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT ALL THREE

122
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:24,943
OF THEM PUT SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT
IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT ALL THREE

123
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:24,944
OF THEM PUT SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT

124
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:25,543
INTO THIS.

125
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:27,679
I STILL EXPECTED COLLINS TO VOTE

126
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,447
THE WAY THAT WE EXPECT HER TO

127
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,882
VOTE TOMORROW ON THE

128
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:31,649
CONFIRMATION, BUT IT WAS CLEAR

129
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,418
THAT SHE PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO

130
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:33,685
IT.

131
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:35,286
I DON’T AGREE WITH WHAT SHE SAID

132
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:36,788
BUT IT’S CLEAR SHE PUT THOUGHT

133
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,188
INTO IT.

134
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,022
>> Tucker: SHE MADE A REASONABLE

135
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:41,226
CASE AND NOW SHE’S BEING

136
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,293
DISMISSED BY SOME RIGHT WING

137
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:42,994
CRAZY --

138
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:45,630
>> THE SAME THOUGHTFULNESS CAN

139
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:51,036
BE APPLIED TO LISA MURKOWSKI AND

140
00:03:51,037 --> 00:00:00,000
HEITKAMP.
