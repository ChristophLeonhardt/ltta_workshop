<font color="#E5E5E5">partner with Richie Rich and travel rain</font>

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,960
what happens then well I start throwing

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,729
money at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fashion shows they</font>

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,160
were getting for free or for 50,000

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,110
we're now half a million dollars because

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,270
everybody knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had the money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,219
what we realized is<font color="#CCCCCC"> richie rich and</font>

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Trevor rain are excellent and amazing</font>

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,410
costume designers high-fashion runway

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,020
designers but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business of everyday</font>

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,570
clothes too form-fitting to a woman that

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,789
you mass-produced is not necessarily

24
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,070
their specialty and it took three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

25
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,440
and six million dollars and I realized

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we didn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything even though</font>

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,370
we're great partners the business never

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,319
got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the level that I believe it</font>

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,760
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I just threw money at it I</font>

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,590
hired a great staff around them we had

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,900
all the best fashion shows and I threw

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,670
money at it instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me rolling up my</font>

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,830
sleeves getting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and working</font>

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,200
with my partners<font color="#CCCCCC"> and making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,090
had the best product for the best

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,420
consumer at the time and that taught me

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,460
a valuable lesson that<font color="#E5E5E5"> money does not</font>

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,380
buy you anything it actually gives you a

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:00:00,000
false sense of security
