it was the centerpiece of Donald Trump's late campaign strategy to reinforce it over and over that Hillary Clinton put America at risk with her reckless use of a private email server a Secretary of State lock her up was a regular chant at Trump rallies Trump argued that state secrets were vulnerable to hacking on a private server fast forward to this afternoon there's this from Politico quote too inconvenient Trump goes rogue on phone security apparently the president has two phones one only capable of making calls the other for tweeting and reading the news but here's the key part while aides have urged the president to swap out the Twitter phone on a monthly basis Trump has resisted their entreaties telling them it was too inconvenient the same official said the president has gone as long as five months without having the phone checked by security experts it is unclear how often Trump's call capable phones which are essentially used as burner phones are swapped out of the panels what are we turn our phones for the commander in chief here oh you're going by it's a mess or something yes well Obama obviously had is not obviously had his phone checked every 30 days predicted an end of days we've got one behind us in this scene of rain at the White House you know just let me tell you what Obama did so Trump's call capable cellphone as a camera and a microphone unlike the White House issued cell phones used by Obama keeping those components creates a risk that hackers could use them to access the phone and monitor the president's movements the GPS location tracker however which can be used to track their president's whereabouts is disabled well that's nice look this is on brand for Trump beyond being a hypocrite we can cover this all the time he operates above the law in his mind I mean they come to him and say this way it's done I don't care and - you and I discussing in the green room before and this is one more example of what is a thing that happens to Donald Trump that in any way affects his 40 41 42 3% somebody will hear this every not around this table and maybe not around the tables don't recycle yeah okay you know that's the way he rolls so yeah and and that's the story here but is there queenly where where the Trump brand was about saying that which was rude it was the brand wasn't about being a big fat hypocrite it was about being blunt with the American people about just how swampy DC I mean this does seem dangerously off-brand for the president but I will say him saying it is inconvenient to change his phone like we would all agree that it is inconvenient to have to change right so I'm not the leader of the free world there are lots of nice things don't flunk and they say to you I don't care I'm not going to like us like he doesn't wait in line at Starbucks I mean exactly but he's not gonna he's gonna say I don't play by any of those rules I don't have to do any of those things none of these rules apply to me and all of us around this table would say that's insane you're the leader of the free world but it doesn't apply to him just just to really elucidate the degree of hypocrisy on display here the the Sox train with us all the video we played at the beginning was very nice what was what you really need though is you need to show the Hillary Clinton shot stream from 2015 to 2016 where she gave her explanation for why she used a private server over and over again it was I'd set up I used personal private email because it was convenient it was inconvenience which she said he was attacking her for not just for being for being pretty being a sloppy he was Hearst precise explanation for why she did what she did which he regarded as a reason to criticize her is now the explanation that he's giving for why he's doing the same thing she did so I don't use my point Jonnie I don't care because I actually just want to point out I want again stay focused on reality and the truth the president someone needs to call the president on his hypocritical time yes that's our point these are I do get it but our point is to live in reality and the reality of the Trump is creators these things don't matter these things don't matter we need to accept that instead of you but I don't think that nothing matters right and I think everything matters but we these truck voters have a breaking point I agree she's not a weak point that's my point but we are not living in a world where these people can be dehumanized to the point where we're blatant hypocrisy that is at the center of the case he ran on is something that we don't talk about as we talk about we meet to talk about talk about that it's not making a difference so what has to make a difference we need to not stop talking about but not be amazed ago here goes another one just say no no we get that what's built into the Trump brand is this ability to skate in places nobody has skated before where do we have to extend that rink so finally it gets them I don't think we extend the rink but I do think it is our job to identify the thin ice and I think this is really I think rock recei is a political vulnerability I think he has maybe two or three and I don't think being on the phone with Vladimir Putin is one of them but I do think flagrant hypocrisy could be on apocrypha the closing argument of the Trump campaign is information secure with Hillary's emails dirty for international dealings of the Clinton Foundation Bill Clinton's tarmac meeting with Loretta Lynch to influence a federal investigation what do we have right now we have built we have Donald Trump we have Donald Trump with his insecure cellphone secure self we have you know these meetings with Trump Tower with Middle Eastern officials trying to influence policy by donations whether to the Trump or Kushner camp companies and of course we have meddling with the federal investigation with the ongoing Russia probe including this meeting is summit at the White House this week that is all on display from the president in the last 24 hours I can't get a break with Johnny anger at me I want to get let's see second I'm not maybe I'm not being articulate for because I'm agreeing with you what I'm saying is how do we move the discussion to take as a given these kind of things not accepted as a norm but a given in the mind of the Trump voter that this is all baked in where do we have to move the discussion where do we have to hope Muller is going where do we have to open up a new investigation that maybe that maybe he's not baked into that our job can't be to make a calculation about what will or won't persuade any given motor of any given thing our job has to be to call BS when there's BS and say over again when the president lies he's lying and and then it's up to voters to decide but our job is to call people on when they lie blatantly when they're hypocritical blatantly we have to call them on it and then again it's up to the voters but I'm not gonna sit around and make calculations based on how we treat these stories on calculating will this change on I guess the difference between actually my job and your job yes I'm not saying that you give it straight and my mind is immediately going to as a businessman as a brand or as a influencer this is great got it the consumer is turning it off how can we move the news not create the news in a way that maybe they're gonna listen more and that's just my point let me talk about the difference hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if
