by any measure the March for our lives protest was a success hundreds of thousands of people came to hear from those whose lives have been touched by gun violence around the world the refrain of never again was heard loud and clear but while crowds gathered close to the White House President Donald Trump was in Florida his Twitter account has remained silent on the issue although the White House issued a statement that in part said we applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights keeping our children safe is a top priority of the president's on Friday the President signed a bill that includes legislation that aims to strengthen background checks moves to ban bump stops which turn rifles into fully automatic weapons are also underway campaigners say it's not enough the fact that nobody is disco in the bill they don't say the word gun once what causes all these shootings what's the one thing to tie everything together there's no specific mental health problem that makes all these shootings happen is the weapon and the fact that they aren't taking any action towards it is proof that we need to keep on going my name is Stephen said and I'm marching from my coach Chris Nixon organizers hope that this is the beginning of a movement but translating never again into significant changes will be challenging former astronaut Mark Kelly whose wife survived an assassination attempt says it'll be a long road ahead I would warn them not to get discouraged you know this is often two steps forward and one step back I had the opportunity to talk to a few of them yesterday and they have a plan and this is this is not the last you're gonna see these kids the protesters that came here may be gone but their list of demands remains banning assault weapons extended magazines and raising age limits will be challenging while the Republicans remain in power and the National Rifle Association continues to wield so much influence the next revolution say organizers will be at the polls Andy Galica al Jazeera Washington
