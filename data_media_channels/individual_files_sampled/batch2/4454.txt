during the preparations for the planned summit between President Trump and Kim jong-un it is important to know how each side defines the end goal of denuclearization for the United States it's cvid it's based on a concept known as complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization of the North complete means that Pyongyang needs to identify all of its uranium and plutonium that's uranium this is plutonium enrichment programs both of these give it a path to nuclear weaponry plutonium being the more advanced weapons fuel verifiable means the u.s. well the u.s. understanding of it is that it's always involved outside weapons inspectors could mean the United Nations weapons inspectors or officials from the IAEA the International Atomic Energy Agency but any inspections would require trust that the North Korean regime isn't still hiding weapons or production facilities sometimes that includes surprise visits of them they can't hide stuff irreversible means total dismantlement of the country's nuclear energy program to prevent any future forays into nuclear weapons testing it's not clear if the country's ballistic missile program would also be part of the CVID but these are some of the very tricky issues that need to be worked out before a meeting between the regime and the US president and complicating things the president has insisted that the north koreans agreed to denuclearization but they didn't agree to it they they just agreed to parts of things so we're gonna be talking about that the north is looking for denuclearization of the entire peninsula the entire Korean Peninsula and since the u.s. actually hasn't stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea since the end of the Cold War despite seeming to drop a demand for US military withdrawal as a condition for the talks the North likely still sees any American military presence in the south as a nuclear threat meaning the administration might be facing a choice between peace and more than half a century of a defense posture in Asia joining us now is NBC News military analyst retired army official Major General Robert scales he's the former Commandant of the US Army War general skills good to see you thank you for being with Ally good to be back so we just described this what what did it what did it mean to you when you heard that the North had agreed to stop certain testing and and and potentially agrees to denuclearization well not much only the bottom line is the legitimacy of the North Korean regime today is defined by owning nuclear weapons I think the best that we could hope for in the coming talks is to is to limit the expansion of nuclear weapons and to have some verifiable means of reducing the probability that the North Koreans can deliver a nuclear weapon against the United States nuclear weapons and the delivery systems for nuclear weapons are simply baked into the North Korean defense strategy and it's simply not likely to change and it certainly won't change after an initial meeting with moon and of course later with the president so it sounds like you do not believe CVID is achievable complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization you don't even think that's on the table it's on the table Stephanie but it's not going to happen but that doesn't mean that good things can't come out of this I mean just to have North Koreans table their research and development effort stop producing fissile material put on the shelf their technology for developing an ICBM capable of reaching the United States and have some form of verification in the north in exchange for the lifting of sanctions for the reduction of American wargames in the south as a quid in the long term probably will work to the advantage is both countries and reduce the probability of war in the future Donald Trump keeps on making references to how this should have been done a long time ago what's your sense on why it hasn't been done a long time ago well that's a great question Ollie and I want to go out on a limb here a little bit a couple of things they're different this time if I could just say that number one Kim is in charge he has murdered 300 of his potential rivals number two the sanctions are actually working thanks to the Chinese over a 95 percent reduction in imported products from China over the last four or five months and number three I think Kim has been spooked by the bluster coming from the president and he's afraid that the United States might even consider a preemptive strike against the north all of these factors have changed the complexion from all of the discussions that have occurred over the last 20 years this potentially could be different than the failed attempts to achieve denuclearization in the past it's really really interesting it supports sort of this argument that Trump's crazy talk people make Y it's so crazy it's just well I hang on guys crazy before we go there let's understand that the 800-pound gorilla in the closet here is the Chinese not Donald Trump if the Chinese choke off North Korea then Kim is no longer able to feed his elite remember he doesn't care about the health of his people he cares about that 7% of the ruling elite in Pyongyang who's who's feeding is necessary for him to sustain his power base the Chinese cutting off goods and services going into Korea is a big thing and as long as the Chinese play along with this then we stand a chance of achieving some serious outcomes in the next few and as you mentioned the other day satellite imagery of the border crossings into China indicate a lot less trade going on if stunning then they're absolutely yeah Major General Robert scales always a pleasure to talk to you thank you sir hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
