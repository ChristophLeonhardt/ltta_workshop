which has 19 rooms or 19 bedrooms I

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,990
very similar to ballet shoes in that

61

just right I think it's set in the 70s

67
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,570
so there's lots about pop music and

68
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,860
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the story also</font>

69
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,750
falls under the category of the timeslip

78
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,240
this book reminded me not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

79
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
way I felt when I first read<font color="#E5E5E5"> I captured</font>

the castle but also the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">when I first read magical realist books</font>

as a half Mexican magical realism has

83
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,040
always been very close and very

84
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,540
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I find</font>

85
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,100
strangely comforting when I find it in

86
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,360
books while this doesn't fall neatly

87
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,740
into that category it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonderful book and instead of keeping</font>

it close and dear to me as<font color="#CCCCCC"> its kind of</font>

91
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,790
tempting I will instead take advantage

92
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,160
of the weird evangelical zeal with which

93
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,140
I have been filled and recommend to you

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right if I wore</font>

close to the fire her face burning and
