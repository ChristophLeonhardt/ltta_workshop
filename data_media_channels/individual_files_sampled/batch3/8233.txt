♪ ♪ Sean: HERE WITH MORE REACTION TO ALL THE NEWS OUT OF SINGAPORE, WHERE FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST, SEBASTIAN GORKA. RETIRED CIA OFFICER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR DANIEL HOFFMAN. I WILL START WITH DR. GORKA. I LISTEN TO THE PRESS AND YOU WOULD LITERALLY THINK THEY DON'T WANT ANY SUCCESS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER ESPECIALLY THE LEAD UP TO THIS WHICH MADE IT WORTHWHILE TO TAKE A SHOT. TAKE THE POLITICS OUT OF IT, WHOEVER YOU VOTED FOR. IT'S THE FACT. DONALD TRUMP COULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED MORE THAN 24 HOURS, 25 HOURS HE WAS AWAKE. WHAT MORE COULD HE HAVE ACHIEVED? AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE IS SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OTHER PEOPLE LEFT FOR HIM. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THIS IS ABOUT THE LAST 25 YEARS, FROM BILL CLINTON ONWARDS, THE SITUATION IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD ON THE PENINSULA WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE BY THE YEAR. THE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY, DETONATING NUCLEAR WARHEADS, LAUNCHING BALLISTIC MISSILES OVER THE SEA OF JAPAN WITH A RANGE OF MORE THAN 2,000 MILES. THOSE ARE NOT PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. BUT GUESS WAS TRYING TO SOLVE IT? IT'S JUST FACTS. Sean: AS I SAID YESTERDAY, YOU WERE SOMEONE WHO WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS. DID HE EXCEED THEM? I THINK HE HAS. I ALSO THINK HE HAS EFFECTIVELY MANAGED THE SUMMIT. IT SPARKED A FLURRY OF DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT. FOLLOW-UP MEETINGS, WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SECRETARY POMPEO'S ENGAGING IN SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY. IT Sean: NORTH KOREAN MEDIA SAID THEY ARE COMING TO THE STATES. THERE WILL BE A LOT OF MEETINGS IN PREPARATION FOR THAT. IT REINFORCES THE BAN OF TESTING OF NUCLEAR MISSILES AND ICBMs. I THINK THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOLLOW-ON AGREEMENTS, MAY BE IN PYONGYANG IN WASHINGTON, D.C., SO WE CAN SUPPORT THE ENGAGEMENT. Sean: THE PRESIDENT SAID NO DEAL UNLESS IT'S COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE. IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE ALSO BEING RESOLVED OF OUR 7,000 MIAS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ISSUE YOU CHOOSE Sean: THAT'S AN ISSUE. 7,000. Sean: TRYING FOR YEARS. THERE MIGHT'VE BEEN PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND IN VIETNAM.
