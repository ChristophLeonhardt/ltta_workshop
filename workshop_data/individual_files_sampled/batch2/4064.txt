we can actually determine even if special representatives of the United States including the members of this very Commission headed by mrs. Miller we can let them into the country and they will be present to this questioning but in this case there is a there's another position and this kind of effort should be a mutual one image a day then we would expect the Americans reciprocate and they they would question officials including the officers law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States whom we believe who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia is the least and we have to to request the presence of our law enforcement what does he not understand about good guys and bad guys I'm sorry how's that for an offer Russia helping to get to the bottom of campaign collusion collusion with Russia under Putin s grand scheme robert muller steam the good guys will be allowed to observe russians the bad guys questioning the 12 intelligence officers indicted by the good guys on Friday go figure don't trust though call that an incredible offer of course he did once again reinforcing something the New York Times reported after the indictments that Trump quote is almost wholly untethered from his administration when it comes to dealing with Moscow and given the response we've seen to what's gone on in Russia today here's a question worth asking his robert muller the last remaining guardrail between Trump and all-out chaos joining the panel's MSNBC contributor Betty Woodruff politics reporter for The Daily Beast we'll give you the first stab at that it seems that even Republicans who have been loath to criticize this president seem to have reached their their their statements of support for the work Bob Miller's doing I watched Fox on Friday after the indictments that I didn't hear many Republicans criticizing the indictments of 13 Russians and I'm wondering if you're hearing anything in terms of some of the more moderate Republicans sort of pulling back from criticizing Muller there's an interesting contrast between the president's legal team you know Rudy Giuliani tweeted shortly after that indictment came out that the Moller probe needed to be shut down and Republicans on Capitol Hill sort of one of the big flash points over the last couple of weeks has been the role of rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General who's in charge of molars investigation and the friction between himself the DOJ and Republicans in Congress who are trying to sort of investigate the investigators by trying to force rod to turn over documents related to the inception of the Russia investigation Rosen Stein has resisted that and now there are some voices in Congress that have been calling for his impeachment however there's some pretty influential Republicans with strong conservative bona fides who've been opposed to that probably most notably trey Gowdy a congressman from South Carolina who's on his way out not running for re-election who suggested he didn't know why Rosen Stein would potentially be impeached so there is this interesting friction within the Republican Party I think it's something that's not going to go away it will be percolating but broadly and the fact that Miller was able to emphasize in this indictment that no Americans have been charged with collusion is something I think that has quieted a little bit of the concern at least from Republicans on Capitol Hill Rosenstein seems to be seems to have acknowledged with this close circle of his own advisers that he had to get himself on a little more offense he's still you know dodging and weaving bullets from all the lunatics in the Republican Party especially in the House Republican side but he knew what he was doing on Friday I'm guessing he had a sense of the president's reaction because he'd been briefed about the indictments before he went over there crawled into jammies and got into the covers with Vladimir Putin today what do you think is going on at the Justice Department with Rosen starring his deputy ed O'Callahan who know everything that's going on inside the Moller investigation and who knew very well how those indictments would look juxtaposed against the president's you know basically you know wedding dance with Vladimir Putin today I think he's declaring the Department of Justice's independence and I think he's doing it in the way that the department can which is with facts you know they can't come out and defend themselves against the president's attacks by talking about what they're investigating they can't kind of you know leak things out but they can roll out indictments when they have them and it wasn't a coincidence that the indictment was released on Friday before this big summit you know I don't know that they've scheduled it for the day for three days before the summit but they I knew it was happening and they didn't delay and there was no reason that they needed to have it on Friday versus I mean that would have been something that they could have faced criticism from the other side right if they did if they delayed it to make the president look good in Russia yeah they absolutely could have been one of the things Rosen Stein said on Friday that I thought was so powerful which is we had named the victims of this in of this hack in the in the indictments they were obviously Hillary Clinton in the Clinton campaign because we thought the entire American public was the victim the entire American people our elections were the victim what did you see Donald Trump to do did they do today instead he went over to Russia and while he was excusing Vladimir Putin he attacked the victim he attacked Hillary Clinton he attacked the investigators that are investigating this case and you see this this distance between the attack the FBI you see this distance between the Justice Department the president now you you ask why can't he just accept these indictments these aren't about collusion these are just about the Russian side of it he can't accept anything Bob Muller does because he doesn't know what the next shoe to drop is gonna be and it might be his son it might be his son-in-law it might be him so once he accepts one piece of Bob Muller's investigation is valid he owns the next piece as well how does playing in Moscow for for Vladimir Putin to have brought Donald Trump so far away from his own political appointees in the intelligence community so far from his own Justice Department to literally stand and say exactly what Vladimir Putin says about Russia's attack on the 2016 election get unpacked this year there's a number of things on one hand of course Trump is the chaos candidate this is perfect for Moscow this is perfect for Putin this is what he's wanted all along and to break the bond between Western Europe in United States at the same time too the Russians have to worry a little bit about this president he is a little bit off the reservation who knows where he could go with these kind of things and I think a little bit with the indictment here the Justice Department dealing in facts I think there's some stuff here that's a shot across about a Putin to that the amount of intelligence information that was likely in this indictment they have specific name specific ranks there's a lot of information here that's dvch makes you wonder if you're in Moscow how much do they know about what we're doing how much deniability can we have we often talk about Putin is deniability as implausible Diana he'll just deny things that you know complete nonsense stuff and so but in this case they have to worry about what the u.s. knows Betsy let me come back to you because I didn't notice that this was the most detailed indictment unsealed so far in the Moller investigation there's been a lot of analysis from legal experts that he's he's held a lot of information out of these indictments and that this was the most we've learned about both the methodology of the investigation the reliance on technology to sort of unpack and unravel the the forensics that are going into his investigation were revealed more in the Friday indictments than we've seen before in previous indictments that's right and that's certainly not a mistake when it comes to counter espionage investigations and particularly two indictments of hackers people who engage in Internet and computer crimes attribution is one of the most important things that prosecutors can do it's a key part to the success of a counter espionage effort that you can show your work that you can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that we as the United States are able to assess which individuals took which specific steps at which specific points in time as part of a hack targeted at American citizens the reason attribution is so important to cybersecurity experts is that it's viewed as one of the only deterrence that exists when it comes to this type of computer crime many hackers are less likely to engage in computer crimes if they know that they will eventually be found out part of the reason that hacking can be such a potent crime to commit whether you're talking about state backed actors or non-state actors is because of the anonymity so naming names is incredibly important here and that's why this indictment is significant not just I mean look nobody's going to get extradited to the United States despite Putin's comments at the press conference today that's basically unthinkable so the text of the indictment in and of itself is really important and that's why Muller seems to have crafted it the way he did with just that granular level of detail and he our friend David Ignatius writes today Putin must be asking himself how did the Americans find out all these facts as he said what other operations have been compromised and how much else do they know what do you think the president knows about just how much Muller knows about the original crime and I guess what I'm asking you is do you think there will be any sort of effort to shield the Muller probe or shield the Justice Department in in letting Trump just sort of know what he sees on Fox News and not much else I mean I mean do you think this could have a chilling effect on just how deep they get with the president I I hope not or I hope so I don't know I'm not well I hope that Muller can continue doing what he's doing and I do know that Trump has has he behaves like a man who's deeply afraid that he's scared and with this 29 page indictment there's a question of whether or not it's going to go towards Putin or whether it's coming back to the states you guys know this stuff more than I do better than I do but whether or not he's actually coming by just coming back to the states to see which Americans colluded who actually participated or participated in this stuff so I think Trump is really scared but Trump's narcissism is such right that he can't it knows no bounds he can't make a distinction and here I'm shifting a bit he can't make a distinction between the idea of him colluding and the idea of the Russians actually attacking the country right right and to the extent to which he can't make that distinction he's gonna meddle in something he's gonna get in he's going to behave in such a way to try to disrupt it so I don't I just hope my hope is that Muller can continue to do what he's doing you're an expert what do you think the intelligence I mean do you think there's a natural reflex to not tell the president everything that we know about what I mean if they think that this may end in some discovery that someone close to the president or the President himself knew about what they were doing to help him do you think they want the President to know everything they know the instinct of the intelligence community is to tell the president all he needs to know and all that we have to the extent that he needs it to do you know foreign policy and national security policy however in this case because it's a counter espionage investigation the FBI plays a role here too and so if the intelligence community has information that that impinges on counter espionage investigation there may be choices and this is tough to hold back certain information or did this you know maybe without even knowing it yourself what stuff you're willing to give and not given maybe in this sense the fact that Trump doesn't like a lot of information or can't process a lot of information might be good for them well you know we could put it in writing cuz he doesn't read it we also know though that I'm in the Oval Office with circuitously Ark and an ambassador Lavrov he shared classified information he told them that he was glad that he had that nutjob Comey off his you know off the radar they got he gotten rid of him and he shared some intelligence so there is a pattern of sharing and again I don't know if it would be reflexive or or deliberate but do you think that he's getting all the Russia intelligence I know the intelligence community including the FBI started this administration by trying to establish a relationship with him where they would tell him what they need to know that's why Jim Comey went and briefed him and told him about the dossier they were trying to tell him lost his mind about her but I know there are concerns that the Justice Department now about what's happening with information in this in this news there is the is the professor in London who helped with the FBI with its investigation the informant his name become became public every source he worked with is now worried every investigation he worked on is now burned I know there's a very real concern that information that goes to the president through either through direct means or through Congress through House Republicans eventually became his public expert that's I mean any chance there'd be a leak investigation involving the president and that sort of information superhighway to Fox News and his allies in the House Republican Judiciary Committee the likelihood of investigating the President as an individual is unlikely but look there are all sorts of questions about the relationship between the White House White House officials and particularly Devon Nunez and the House Intelligence Committee we've seen a significant amount of sort of what appears to be quite a cozy relationship there and that's something that of course has people concerned part of the reason that the Justice Department has come to such loggerheads over and over with Capitol Hill over these document requests including requests from the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee the list kind of goes on and on is because there's this understanding or almost resignation to the fact within the DOJ that if they give a document to Capitol Hill it will leak by the time the inks dry on the paper that it's a matter of minutes before these documents go from the hill to Fox News or to other conservative media outlets and of course if you're in the Justice Department and you're working on an active investigation that's a prospect it's extremely galling and one senior Justice Department official said to me that there's not a lot different about information requests from the hill but what's so different is that it all gets leaked to conservative media outlets within minutes as you just described hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for
