1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,749
This tiny little wafer thin chip

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,050
could be a better way to explore
space

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,650
than the

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,159
gold rush to space we can say

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,010
we're like the shovel.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,179
Once upon a time Natalya Bailey

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,590
had big dreams of working for NASA.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,759
I would sleep on my trampoline

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,219
at night and watch the stars

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,199
and thinking about aliens

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,119
and watching the Space Station

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,139
pass overhead

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,029
and I went on

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,219
to apply to NASA twice

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,359
to become an astronaut

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,099
and have gotten there thanks

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,029
but no thanks.

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,760
Postcards from NASA

19
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,500
but I'll keep applying.

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,089
So she had to settle for being a
plain

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,499
old rocket scientist

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,869
and a founding member of Accion
systems

23
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,849
a startup poised to revolutionize

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,800
space travel

25
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,759
with these wafer thin chips that
believe

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
it or not our engines.

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,260
Low earth orbit is

28
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,769
becoming more

29
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,799
and more accessible to organizations

30
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,269
universities hobbyists

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,169
and their garages,

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,449
people that before never would have
even

33
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,090
imagined launching a satellite.

34
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,989
So we're talking about you know

35
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,849
tens of thousands of satellites
being

36
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,580
launched over the next decade

37
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,779
and currently they have no
propulsion

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,589
solutions.

39
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,660
And that's what Accion is building
as

40
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,759
is an engine that works on

41
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,830
small satellites.

42
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,307
OK this is actually rocket science,

43
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:26,179
so here's the bare minimum

44
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,270
you need to know- an ion

45
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,420
is a charged atomic particle

46
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,799
by pushing ionic liquid which is
basically

47
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,779
a molten salt into this chip

48
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,029
the size of a penny billions of ions

49
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,889
can be discharged at mind boggling

50
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,810
velocities.

51
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,769
If you could picture an astronaut

52
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,220
sitting on the back of a satellite

53
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,449
and she's throwing tennis balls off

54
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,160
the back,

55
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,329
each time she throws a tennis ball
off

56
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,369
the satellite moves a little bit in
the opposite

57
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,208
direction. In Accion's engine these

58
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,262
tennis balls are actually ions,

59
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,639
and our smallest ion

60
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,679
engine is about the size of a pack

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,570
of cards.

62
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,519
Now we still need conventional
rockets to escape

63
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,470
Earth's gravity.

64
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,759
But once in space Accion's chip

65
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,739
will increase the shelf life of
satellites by

66
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,510
years,

67
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,859
and eventually enable deep space
travel

68
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,350
without chemical propulsion

69
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,759
rockets. Our engines operate without
any

70
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,739
fire flames

71
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,590
or loud noises so

72
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,629
they're not quite as visceral as say

73
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,469
a Falcon Heavy rocket for

74
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,536
example, but they're very efficient.

75
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,950
This is a Berkut.

76
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,490
It's a canard pusher

77
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,444
and it's kind of like our family
car.

78
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,309
I've always wanted to

79
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,419
be an astronaut.

80
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,279
And aviation is kind

81
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,650
of like the next best thing.

82
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,620
Fortunately I married a pilot

83
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,229
and were raising the youngest pilot

84
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,630
here.

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,719
First electric propulsion engines

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,819
were actually developed in the 50s

87
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,809
and 60s

88
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,040
but they were largely ignored after
that,

89
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,069
and it seemed to me during college
that

90
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,929
there was this whole branch of
rocket

91
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,740
science just waiting to be advanced.

92
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,669
Natalya's studies accelerated at
such

93
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,589
a rapid pace she had to learn what
it meant

94
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,539
to own a business while still a
student

95
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,319
of science.

96
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I don't think business comes

97
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,769
naturally to me.

98
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,079
I was in a lab

99
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,659
at MIT trying to finish up
experiments

100
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,609
with headphones on listening to

101
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,490
how to be a startup CEO

102
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,389
and trying to learn on the

103
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:45,448
job essentially.

104
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:45,699
Our

105
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,039
serious long term customers

106
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,109
are right now people like the
Department

107
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,149
of Defense and folks like Lockheed

108
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,550
Martin and Boeing.

109
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,479
But our first fight delivery that
went

110
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,930
out the door was actually to Irvine
high school.

111
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,829
So a group of high school students

112
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,933
is going to be launching a cube sat

113
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,460
with our system on it.

114
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,139
After hawking these chips to
everyone from

115
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,270
school kids to the Department of
Defense,

116
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,459
Natalya envisions Accion playing an
even

117
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,580
larger role in space exploration.

118
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,969
Shoot for Mars

119
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,500
or

120
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,070
Alpha Centauri.

121
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,219
It's pretty a B Hag, a Big Hairy

122
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,275
Audacious Goal.

123
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,211
Is that sort of like your whole

124
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,147
career bascially?

125
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,090
Yes.

126
00:04:32,940 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would you have any other way?
