there's a kind of a cartoonish view of
CIA my wife and I went to more than 50
stations and bases while I was director
not once did we meet Jack Bauer no Jason
Bourne didn't even talk to Jack Ryan
you've got this kind of Hollywood image
of what CIA or NSA does and it's usually
pretty dark and pretty ominous ominous
and I get it
these people do not have different
values than you these people share your
values they went to your high schools
they go to the same churches they share
essential American values they are just
required to apply those values in
circumstances that most Americans will
never face and about which most
Americans will never become aware
