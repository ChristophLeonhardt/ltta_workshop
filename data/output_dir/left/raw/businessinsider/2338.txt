2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,949
market made zillow more relevant you

3
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,270
have a ton of content on your site

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,250
people advising other people you have

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,680
the QA has the activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,900
increased over the last year activities

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,189
increased a lot and part of that's been

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,599
driven by the housing downturn part of

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,550
it by an increasing feature set but our

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,380
traffic was up about<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty seven percent</font>

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,190
in 2009 verse 2008 and market volatility

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,890
benefits information providers so a lot

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,360
of our traffic growth has come<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the housing downturn so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes and</font>

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,129
now especially owning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font>

16
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,050
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> than than renting and I know</font>

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,149
that zillow recently entered the rental

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,739
market was that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of necessity or is</font>

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,059
that just a natural progression of the

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,680
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's natural</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> progression we always</font>

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,420
had rentals in our sites i mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,160
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense really to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have for sale and</font>

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,440
rentals on the same website in fact when

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,059
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> launched rentals just last month we</font>

25
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">became</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first major real estate site</font>

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,930
to have for sale homes and for rent

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,580
homes available in the same map and the

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,020
same list to look at at the same time

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,150
and about a quarter of all home shoppers

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,890
now are looking for for sale and for

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">rent homes at the same time so it's</font>

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,920
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a benefit to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,659
look at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> side by side so you grew up</font>

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">in New York I know that you've lived in</font>

35
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,830
LA how does zillow approach these dense

36
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,229
markets it's got to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult we have</font>

37
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,840
our niche sites like bid on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city and</font>

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,670
citi habitats and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot how does the</font>

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,470
low think about these cities um it's

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,150
hard it's very hard particularly was

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,650
estimates which is probably what zillow

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,119
is still best known for these valuations

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,650
on almost every home the country it's a

44
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,689
very hard to value Manhattan real estate

45
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,400
for example I mean it's it's hard for

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
real estate agents<font color="#CCCCCC"> or buyers to evaluate</font>

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,600
no less for a computer algorithm which

48
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,100
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> zomos trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so it's</font>

49
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,869
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult those are bright</font>

50
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,840
spot geography of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is any place</font>

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,880
where housing market is actually booming

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,189
or doing better than save<font color="#E5E5E5"> Detroit not</font>

53
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,200
quite booming but but those data shows

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,700
that Boston in LA I've actually already

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,310
bought them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there now it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

56
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,770
very long slow climb off that bottom but

57
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,479
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst is behind us some</font>

58
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

59
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,760
values in Boston in LA not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font>

60
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">York yet right so what are you</font>

61
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,930
estimating them for 2010 and beyond um

62
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,760
what's the housing market<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like so</font>

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,790
the numbers at the end of 2009 we're

64
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,260
home values were declining around six

65
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,850
percent year-over-year which was

66
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,020
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lowest rate of decline</font>

67
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,000
since december two thousand seven so

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,710
home values are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down but not</font>

69
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">nearly as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as they were a couple</font>

70
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,880
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we still think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's another</font>

71
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,330
10 or so percent drop down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> downside</font>

72
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,760
nationwide now nationwide<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of not</font>

73
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,010
that interesting to any individual but

74
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,020
you know in terms of how we learn a data

75
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,200
it's it's important but some markets and

76
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,550
some price ranges are already starting

77
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,140
to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think more importantly is</font>

78
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,730
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a very slow recovery</font>

79
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,220
from there it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be five or more</font>

80
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,530
years of low single-digit appreciation

81
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,720
rates we should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

82
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the boom times this is not going to</font>

83
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,220
we're not going to return to that it's

84
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a long period of slow</font>

85
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,980
recovery so you say we still have ten

86
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,280
percent down side wins the bottom coming

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,270
nationwide we think the bottom is still

88
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,730
about 9 to 12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> out but again some</font>

89
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,320
markets have already reached it great so

90
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,950
we're looking at 2015 for back to normal

91
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,989
levels well the normal is a relative

92
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,410
term<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be normal oh yeah but yeah</font>

93
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,790
in terms of returning to the peak we

94
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,930
think it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite a long time</font>

95
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">five to ten years before he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> returns to</font>

96
00:03:20,520 --> 00:00:00,000
people great thanks Spencer thank you
