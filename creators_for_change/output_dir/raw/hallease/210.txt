00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,290
hey guys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm back and I finally</font>

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished combing out my locks it took</font>

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,690
about three weeks to pass by the time I

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,259
watched a season of ugly betty that is

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,370
what got me<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this process</font>

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,210
honestly

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,419
mmm things I've noticed um I have about

8
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,250
three different girl patterns all over

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,009
my head the back of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> head is a lot</font>

10
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:31,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">more z-type a lot more course more of</font>

11
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,149
that cotton<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose feel and so as</font>

12
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,989
such it gets dry very quickly it which

13
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,280
makes a lot of sense because<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,739
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pat in the past and stuff the</font>

15
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:43,210
back of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hair it always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,589
grew the slowest but it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

17
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">grew the slowest it just lost moisture</font>

18
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,870
and therefore broke easily so I'm

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely catering now my regimen to</font>

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,129
the different curl patterns and sections

21
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,290
of my head with moisturizing I

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,350
definitely seal in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back a lot like</font>

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll put right now i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using a deep</font>

24
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,509
treatment mask by shea moisture as a

25
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">product that a lot of people have ranted</font>

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,780
and raved about i first<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought this</font>

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,299
actually a year two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my locks and i</font>

28
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,040
even did a review of it if you look

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,400
through my videos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i loved it then</font>

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,170
just as a moisturizer which is what i'm

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">using it for now I put it in my hair and</font>

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't wash it out I'd leave it in and</font>

33
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:25,000
I seal that then with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> haha boil and</font>

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,040
so that's what I've kind of been doing

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,440
the front of my hair is more of a curly

36
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,040
like s type pattern I know if I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,220
show you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some sections</font>

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,800
where it's like so defined like the curl

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,700
is just like so defined it's crazy time

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,630
like are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you serious right now I don't</font>

41
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,420
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can see that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font>

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,610
curled you know there's definite

43
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,409
twisting just<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a curl there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

44
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do like a serious</font>

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,049
moisturize like they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so noticeable</font>

46
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,090
so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting the front</font>

47
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,379
very curly back<font color="#CCCCCC"> zzzz so what can you do</font>

48
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,470
um I like it though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely like it</font>

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a length check so you</font>

50
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,120
can see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how I've much I've</font>

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,860
retained and all of that keep in mind

52
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is after I trimmed my ends I'm</font>

53
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,709
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to wait a couple months</font>

54
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,380
but with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I'm probably wait a couple</font>

55
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,100
months and do a more in-depth

56
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,890
like go somewhere and get it trimmed

57
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,300
because I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see what I was</font>

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing I didn't wanted it wrong but add a</font>

67
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,130

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,410

74
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,050
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and</font>

00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,400
dating it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> still a little damp</font>

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,960
so so the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you can see how much</font>

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,870
it shrinks like crazy time so that's

82
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,660
aside the front

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,860
