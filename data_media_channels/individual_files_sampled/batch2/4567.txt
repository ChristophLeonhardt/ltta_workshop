Eric Holder the former attorney general under President Obama mr. Attorney General welcome to the show good beer I want to get you reaction to what rod Rosen as I said I'm sure you agree with this sentiment but I'm curious is how did you get the sense that he's concerned people are about the big in their hails even more yeah I think he's probably reacting to that which we saw yesterday up on the hill and what we have seen over these past few months where the Justice Department has been under attack partisan attack by people of his own party and making charges that are clearly unsubstantiated the Department of Justice is comprised of Democrats Republicans all who put those feelings aside and do their jobs on the basis of the facts that they find and the law that they have to apply I'm sure when you saw Peter struck go through that hearing you're like hmm that's familiar being in there with the House Republicans particularly the handful of House Republicans that sit on the it's the same group that sits under judiciary that seems to be part of the Trump sort of protective wing there what did you make a gesture that I thought that struck though he had done some things I think were inappropriate and it was appropriate for him to be removed from the investigation did a really good job in defense of himself and of the FBI and I thought that the Republicans did not cover themselves in glory you know the same people you know Louie Gohmert Jordan and let's take up let's take of a collection let's get Jordan the jacket you know what's that open darrell Issa you know people going at at struck in ways that are designed to protect the president above all else protect the president not to protect protect the nation so this issue of politicizing the Justice Department right Republicans believed you were there to protect President Obama on everything and whether there was faxed to somehow justify the accusation just happened there's a there's going to be a belief that there's a group of people here to protect President Trump right and I think there's some what we are getting now is now you have the extremes of both parties that essentially believe government is in the pocket of whoever's in power how do we erase this well I think we have to you know push keep pushing facts out there and the reality is that the Department of Justice by and large and there have been exceptions conducts itself in appropriate ways and when it does when a Department of Justice gets too close to the White House that's when the department finds itself in in trouble I think that what rod has done here you know this would be was some of the tactics that that he's used I think you should push back a little harder a little sooner but I think he's done a good job in trying to navigate a pretty difficult political situation you've been a prosecutor you've been a US Attorney you've done this prosecutors sometimes want to send a message with timing of indictments or timing of subpoenas or timing of no-knock subpoenas sometimes mala could have easily waited till Tuesday he intentionally did not what do you make of it that's very interesting clearly this is something given the fact that I understand the president was briefed about this Robertson Science said so on the pot on the record that's a public statement that he said he briefing well this then could have been done after the summit and I think this was a message in some ways it was being sent by the Justice Department at a time that would have maximum maximum impact I think that on the basis of this the president should clearly cancel that trip to say Helsinki unless he's gonna take this indictment with him I was just gonna say isn't there a case to say the other side of it is here's the evidence buddy enough of this stop denying I mean I just like take give him the benefit now yeah but there's no basis to believe he's gonna ever do that every time that they've had some kind of interaction he's returned from that saying that you know denied that he did anything and he seemingly agreed with what Putin said I don't have any basis to believe that Trump would would take that indictment or confront Putin in a way that would be appropriate you have a long history with Bob Muller you I think hired him to be a deputy when you were the US attorney here in DC what have you seen in this investigation that looks familiar to you and and when what is different oh I think this is typical Bob Muller this is thorough this is precise it's systematic each step is built on the one before and leads to something that is to come we have seen I think in this instance now we have pretty I think putting up a pretty complete picture what happened on the Russian side was earlier now the question is what happened on the American side and I think that's the thing that you could probably see will probably see next is he equipped for 21st century information warfare Bob Muller and the reason I say this is that you you have a president that is seeded the ground in a different way the facts facts may not matter by the time they come out most being thorough he can't make a single mistake I think he knows we've learned this and we make one mistake the president accuses a fake news he can make 17 mistakes it doesn't matter I think Mullah realizes he's in that there's no you're not allowed you have to have a hundred percent in the exam is he prepared for the modern information warfare that I think our prosecutors in general prepared for this you know I think prosecutors generally Bob specifically they are crippled by the obligations they have to maintain secrecy only speak when they have the ability to reveal an indictment something like that and that in this era is not necessarily an effective way of countering that which they have to what they have to deal with and so I think it's incumbent upon people who know the system people like me who have served before to do as much as we can to reassure the American people that what's being done in their names is being done correctly and being done appropriately look I want to in full disclosure to wait scheduler I thought we were going to talk about an array of topics so we were going to talk one but I want to bring up one non-rush related issue and this is this new call by the a lot of progressive Democrats says get rid of ice what do you make of those calls and what would you say to him I mean I don't think that substantively or politically that makes a great deal of sense I think I obviously needs to be reformulated it needs to be reformed but I think we need to focus on that which is most important and that's the separation of these kids from their parents now I see no played a role in that but I think in some ways you're giving the Republicans a gift by saying we're gonna have a debate now about whether ice should be abolished and the focus ought to be on what this administration did to those children I am curious of what you think and sort of you've done if you've had whiplash here yesterday at that hearing you had Republicans trashing law enforcement and you had Democrats standing up for the FBI and the rule of law that you know the the characterization of both parties it you know is and I think he did Cedric Richmond said as an african-american man it not always easy to defend the FBI yeah yeah and I hope that voters will remember this when Republicans in 2018 2020 try to cast themselves as the law enforcement party will remember all the things that Republicans have done to attack the credibility of well-intentioned good serving people in the FBI the Justice Department and our intelligence agencies as well I bring that up in relation to the ice thing because I do think that sends a mixed message mm-hmm yeah Democrats sometimes yeah that's why I mean I think that there is a substantive concern it ought to be about those kids it's a political benefit to focusing on those kids in that secondary I think to the substantive concern and I don't think that we need to be as concerned about a bottom now again that's an agency that needs to be redone reformatted but the focus ought to be on those children all right Eric Holder are you running
