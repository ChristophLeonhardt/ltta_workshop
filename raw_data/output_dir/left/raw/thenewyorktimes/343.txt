1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,620
“The city is awake.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,125
Across the length of
its five boroughs,

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,930
a vast stream of
humanity will move.”

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,140
This was what a New Yorker’s
commute looked like in 1961.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,274
“— can be seen the daily miracle
that is the New York City

6
00:00:16,274 --> 00:00:16,900
transit system.”

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,700
But that was then.

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,536
And this is now.

9
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:21,964
[screaming]

10
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:25,109
“Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.”

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,650
Subway riders demanding an end
to their commuting nightmare.”

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,140
“So fed up with all the
delays and cancellations

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,439
that they are suing the M.T.A.”

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,170
The New York subway now has
the worst on-time performance

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,000
of any major rapid transit
system in the world.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,841
And commuters are pissed.

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,900
This woman’s commute
has gotten so bad,

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,100
she’s considering leaving
a job she really likes.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,600
“No.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,920
I got a new job.”

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,250
This rabbi was sent into a panic
when his train stalled just

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,384
before Shabbat.

23
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:53,800
And then there’s
this guy, who was

24
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,810
stuck underground for
so long, commuters

25
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,980
sang to pass the time.

26
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,480
“... Gonna make
me lose my mind up in here ...”

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,967
“It’s been two hours.”

28
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:03,550
They ended up making
a Facebook group.

29
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,507
They’re still in touch.

30
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:05,590
“Yeah.”

31
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,690
“The mornings where every
single line is delayed —”

32
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,690
“It was like cruel or arbitrary.”

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,230
But it really
wasn’t that long ago

34
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,780
that New Yorkers would laugh
at other city subway systems.

35
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,030
Four lines in Boston, two in L.A.?

36
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,260
That’s cute.

37
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,060
In New York our trains run 24/7.

38
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,770
We have 665 miles of track,
472 stations, 27 subway lines,

39
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,805
and almost six million
riders every single day.

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,770
“Does it really have
to be this way?”

41
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,840
“Also, has it always
been this bad?”

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,085
Turns out the M.T.A. has recovered
from a transit crisis before.

43
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:47,480
“Ladies and gentlemen, we
are being held momentarily

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,370
by the train’s dispatcher.”

45
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,547
These were the
trains in the 1970s.

46
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:59,240
“Poor maintenance, high crime
and widespread graffiti.”

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,870
“It was kind of scary.”

48
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,650
And that’s Jim.

49
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,380
He’s been reporting on the
subway since before I was born.

50
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,360
“He wrote the book about
the subway, literally.

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,479
In the ’70s, it was
really, really bad.”

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,140
“Maintenance really had suffered.”

53
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,431
So officials poured money into
the system, and it improved.

54
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:19,931
[cheering]

55
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,404
“They are working on it.

56
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:22,877
They’re doing the best they can.”

57
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:23,750
“They’re fixing the tracks.

58
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,041
Well, they’re fixing the track.

59
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,770
They put in a new
escalator downstairs.”

60
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,480
“They improve it in the ’80s.

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,800
“Today we got better equipment,
better parts and better tools.”

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,940
“In the ’90s it gets to be
the best it’s ever been.”

63
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,250
The 1990s were the golden
era of subway functionality.

64
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,860
“So if you want to
prove to someone

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,550
that New York has it all, just
show them your MetroCard Gold.”

66
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,770
New York’s governor at
the time, George Pataki,

67
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,960
called it a transit renaissance.

68
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,360
But then, that city
that has it all started

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,565
taking the system for granted,
starting with Mayor Rudolph

70
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:54,065
Giuliani.

71
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,660
“Cut down the size
of city government.”

72
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,580
Just a year into his
first term, the mayor

73
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,890
cut the city’s contribution
to the M.T.A.’s budget

74
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,405
by millions of dollars.

75
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:04,190
Then, Governor Pataki
followed Giuliani’s lead.

76
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,800
And so began a trend
of mayors and governors

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,390
diverting part of their
budgets away from the M.T.A.

78
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,765
and toward their own
priorities. And then blaming one

79
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,390
another for the
problems that followed.

80
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,890
“Right.”

81
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,470
So while the city and
state contributions

82
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,560
got smaller and
smaller and smaller,

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,800
subway ridership went
up, and so did the fares.

84
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,620
But fares still weren’t enough
to make up for the budget cuts.

85
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,100
So a group of Wall Street
executives came to the M.T.A.

86
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,650
with a deal.

87
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,430
[cash register ringing]

88
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,010
These Wall Street execs, they
went to the head of the M.T.A.,

89
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,565
also known as the governor,
and said, give us your debt.

90
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,850
We’ll pay you cash.

91
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,540
Pay us back later.

92
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,000
Pataki agreed to the deal
to refinance the M.T.A.’s debt.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,930
“Basically, they used the Amex
to pay off the MasterCard.”

94
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,390
And these bankers, many
of whom were donors

95
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,350
to Governor Pataki’s campaign,
walked away with $85 million

96
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,290
in commissions and fees.

97
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,941
And that debt lives on today —

98
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,630
“... finally reaches
its destination.”

99
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,970
— even if some of the equipment
we’re still paying for

100
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,470
does not.

101
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,192
“Great habitat enhancement
for fish and shellfish.”

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,952
Then —

103
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,250
“It was a fiscal crisis globally.”

104
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,730
“That was a really big
turning point for the M.T.A.”

105
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,892
“Maintenance was withdrawn.”

106
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,600
“You’re checking the
cars less frequently,

107
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,150
you’re repairing the
cars less frequently,

108
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,700
then they’re going to
break down more frequently.”

109
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,410
“So basically —”

110
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,790
“The trains became
slightly less reliable.”

111
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,860
But there were millions
of dollars draining

112
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,730
from the M.T.A.’s budget that could
have been used for maintenance.

113
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,690
“So what happened was —”

114
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,850
This summer Governor
Cuomo’s administration

115
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,640
forced the M.T.A. to bail out
some upstate ski resorts

116
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,710
after an unusually warm winter.

117
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,170
“So we set out to
try and find out

118
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,830
if there were a lot of other
examples of the M.T.A. being

119
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,260
forced by the state to spend
money on things that had

120
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,060
nothing to do with the subway.

121
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,180
And we found out about
these bond issuance fees.”

122
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,306
Bond issuance fees may
sound a little boring.

123
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,180
So I hired a busker to
write a song about it.

124
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:42,295
“Let me put it this way — the
M.T.A. brings in a lot of money.

125
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,620
The state has used that
money as a piggy bank

126
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,171
for other priorities.”

127
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:52,440
“The next stop is Fulton Street.”

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,500
“Fulton Street was
the pet project

129
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,750
of a guy named Sheldon Silver.”

130
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,300
He wanted Fulton Street
to be the Grand Central

131
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,730
Station of downtown Manhattan.

132
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,160
So construction started,
the years went by,

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,020
and the day of the
grand opening arrived.

134
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,580
“Oh, that’s way over budget.”

135
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,820
At this point, the M.T.A. board
wants to scale things back.

136
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,110
And one of the board members —

137
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,120
“Nancy Shevell, wife
of Paul McCartney,

138
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,600
said, we’re not
building cathedrals here.”

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,474
But the next day,
Sheldon Silver demanded —

140
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:23,890
”You’re going to build this
thing the way it was originally

141
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,870
supposed to be
built, or else I’m

142
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,040
going to veto your
capital budget.”

143
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,440
So the M.T.A. complied.

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,990
“A billion and a half
dollars on one station.

145
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,590
It didn’t get an extra subway
car, an extra foot of track,

146
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,810
nothing.

147
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,490
Did I say it was
in his district?”

148
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,069
Fulton Street was
just one example.

149
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,610
“These politicians
really wanted to be

150
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,070
able to have a big project
they could champion,

151
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,247
mosaics and artwork and
everything is brand new.”

152
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,455
“Clean, shiny subway stations.

153
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,570
This is exciting, right?”

154
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,500
I did this for you.

155
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,878
Here is my gift to you.

156
00:06:58,878 --> 00:06:59,378
“Yeah.

157
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,842
And I feel good about that.”

158
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:03,770
“Of course you should.”

159
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,590
“You can’t really do that with
replacing some ancient subway

160
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,650
signal system that people
don’t even know exists.”

161
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,371
“No one wants to talk
about the signals.”

162
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,680
“I don’t think I understand
how the signals even work.”

163
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,670
And neither did I. So I
watched a documentary released

164
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,640
by the M.T.A. to learn more.

165
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,530
“People know that
the system is old,

166
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,650
but I don’t think they
realize just how old it is.

167
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,940
It’s not just the architecture
that’s 100 years old.

168
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,380
It’s a lot of the basic
technology as well.

169
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,710
We never really know
where the train is.”

170
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,620
“Um —”

171
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,380
“Yeah.”

172
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,960
“The workers don’t actually know
where the trains are exactly,

173
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,460
precisely, on the tracks.

174
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,500
They know what
section they are in.

175
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,750
So they have to keep
them a safe distance

176
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,296
apart as they go
through the system.

177
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,420
You can’t just go to Best
Buy and pick up something

178
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,090
to replace this 1930s
piece of equipment.”

179
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,760
New signals would mean more
trains running more efficiently

180
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,290
and closer together.

181
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,500
But it’s been two decades since
the M.T.A. first began its push

182
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,730
to upgrade its signals.

183
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,790
And so far, they’ve
completed just one line.

184
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,190
“If you don’t focus on the
core needs of the system,

185
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,724
bad things can happen.”

186
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,700
“So the trains were not
as well taken care of,

187
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,840
the signal system
deteriorated, and there was

188
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,750
very little margin for error.”

189
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,450
And then that margin gets even
smaller with Hurricane Sandy.

190
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,414
“The worst disaster in the
history of the subway system.”

191
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,010
So this is the part
of the story where

192
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,943
all of those bad
decisions of the past

193
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,110
really start wreaking havoc.

194
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,990
“The M.T.A. is openly violating
its own safety directives.”

195
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,080
A tunnel wall in Brooklyn
collapses onto the track.

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,935
“We just boarded
the rescue train.”

197
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,460
“There have been 22 derailments.”

198
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,260
Overcrowding is
definitely a problem,

199
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,520
but the M.T.A. can’t blame
everything on overcrowding.

200
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,511
“The issue is there’s
not one person to blame.”

201
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:56,010
There’s been a lot
of back and forth

202
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,468
between the governor
and the mayor.

203
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,125
“Blame everybody who has
been in power in New

204
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,560
York in the past 25 years.”

205
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,250
A train careens off the tracks
in Harlem, injuring 34 people.

206
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,980
And in summer of 2017,
the waiting and crowding

207
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,170
and derailments reach
a breaking point.

208
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,050
And at long last, Governor Cuomo
declares a state of emergency.

209
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,550
“I mean

210
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,460
there is some light at
the end of the tunnel.

211
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,510
No pun intended.

212
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,720
I actually did not
intend that pun.

213
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,300
There are some signs
that politicians are now

214
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,165
taking the maintenance of
the subway system seriously.”

215
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,720
“Elected leaders are finally
expected to come out

216
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,632
with a plan to pay for the M.T.A.

217
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:37,590
And I think there’s a
consensus they can’t just

218
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,450
rely on debt anymore.”

219
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,836
“I believe in you, subway.

220
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,860
But you’ve got to
get it together.”

221
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,370
“We want to do this.

222
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,890
We need to do this.

223
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,100
We will do this.”

224
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,870
“I think delay is,
in a messed up way,

225
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,290
our way to bring
people together.”

226
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,970
“There’s no New York City
without the subways.

227
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,032
I regard it as the great
public commons of New York.”

228
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,270
“Yeah, it’s good.”

229
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,605
“Nice meeting all of you.”

230
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:05,250
“They ride together.

231
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,960
And in this journey can be
seen the daily miracle that

232
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,260
is the New York City
transit system, upon which

233
00:10:12,260 --> 00:00:00,000
the very existence of the
city and its people, depend.”
