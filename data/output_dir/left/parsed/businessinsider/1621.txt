I stumbled across individual trial sized
cups of chocolate pudding from healthy
choice that each had their own bar code
that we're selling for 25 cents apiece
I basically grabbed the entire display
case and threw it in the shopping cart
and bought all the chocolate pudding
that they had in that store I drove
about 200 miles to to hit all 10 of the
grocery stores and filled up a minivan
full of chocolate pudding and then I
went to work peeling off the label
I found a guy with a sense of humor at a
local Salvation Army and he said yeah
sure yeah I'd be happy to take you know
take all the chocolate pudding as a
donation and I said what there's a catch
if you know once you take it I want to
get the bar codes back
my net cost ended up being $2,500 for
all of the chocolate pudding
we did lots of family trips to Europe to
the Caribbean I did crazy guy trips and
trips with some colleagues at work where
we would fly to Korea for the weekend
and go kind of the wrong way via
Amsterdam it probably took me about
seven years to burn through all of the
all the miles from the pudding project
