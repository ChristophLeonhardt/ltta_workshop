00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,310
I already ride a bike and this just

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,509
makes it a lot more convenient

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,490
especially if you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do cross</font>

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,850
town so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take this bike to another</font>

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,770
subway station dumped the bike I don't

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,859
have to worry about the bike and I think

7
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,669
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great way to get</font>

8
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:23,599
around the city and in a fairly cheap

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,339
matter and not have to worry about

10
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting your bike ripped off everywhere</font>

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,490
you go I'm sure there'll be some

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,919
accidents but anyone who gets on a bike

13
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:34,340
in New York City<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it knows what</font>

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,920
they're getting into it's not exactly

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,170
you don't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and go wow I'd</font>

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,690
love to ride a bike here so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,010
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are using other people who</font>

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,320
feel comfortable on them certainly that

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,480
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I usually I have a bike and I</font>

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,190
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time but i'll tell you</font>

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,320
coming down here and seeing these

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,270
sitting here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing i got to go 10</font>

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,220
blocks I'd much<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather do this and get</font>

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,280
get a cab for twenty bucks or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,900
even ride to a subway three blocks away

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:00,000
from here and it's still safety time
