dogs tend to howl because the part of their social repertoire part of their vocal behavior for communicating with other dogs or other canines what's interesting is the different type of vocalizations dogs have our function of what they're trying to accomplish if you think about growling which is sort of a low sound is really Curt at a short distance but it's really meant to say you're too close I don't want you to come any closer to me howling has the opposite purpose it's you're far away I want to communicate with you I want to gather so a howling is really a gathering sound and acoustically it actually carries farther than the growl and so that's the purpose of the howling by a dog they're lonely and they want you to come to them or they want to be with another dog or with you the reason sirens will set this off is because the acoustical signature of the siren will sometimes mimic the the frequencies that you'll hear in the howling so it stimulates that in the dog and the dog will holler along with it Oh
