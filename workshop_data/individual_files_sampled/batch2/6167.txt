Donald Trump has suddenly endorsed a completely different plan for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act now of course members of the Senate and the house have tried to come up with a replacement plan to no avail it's been very difficult for them to get some of the more moderate Republicans on board however now Trump is saying why don't we just like repeal it man and then maybe later on we'll come up with a replacement plan let me give you his tweet he says if Republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date okay so where is this coming from turns out that senator Ben Sasse came up with this idea and got together with other colleagues who agree with him and are now convincing Trump to propose this idea SAS wrote a letter to Trump Friday morning suggesting a plan to repeal Obamacare now with a year-long delay in implementation setting up Congress to work on a replacement plan this summer okay he says we should include a year-long implementation delay to give comfort to Americans currently on Obamacare that a replacement plan will be enacted before expiration okay so let me get into why they're doing this first of all it's because they're all children not just Donald Trump they they don't really go so hard replacing it this is kill it and see what happens well if you don't replace it with a so what are people gonna do that were on these plants that Obamacare set up in the first place I mean I get it they think we'll solve it later well maybe maybe they also I imagine they think and I don't know that they right that the pressure then on Democrats to me is where they need to a few Democrats because then though then then it won't be in reconciliation then they might need 60 votes that they'll need some Democrats because then there'll be no health care plan so you'll be essentially starting over so a plan that covers some people right in a totally new way will be different and they'll be pressure on some moderate Democrats who want to do something you know or the other possibility is simply they've repealed Obamacare so those tax break and they that's essentially the tax break that goes to the goes to the wealthy and then as we think does never replace it because they don't care that's not they don't mean to their the thing that sticks with their core voters wasn't repeal and replace it was just the repeal part that's the wind that they need to get politically from from their base yeah and I so I won't talk about tax because I think that's the main point here but you made a great point that I hadn't considered because if they don't do anything but they've repealed Obamacare in a year from now that's gonna take effect under this plan right well then a lot of people are going to lose a lot of people are gonna lose their insurance and it's gonna be in desperate straits and that allows for what the Republicans always do hold the American people hostage and they know that some Democrats have a conscience and so they'll be like well they're all gonna lose their insurance so you better give us what we want otherwise these people are gonna die right right and and so some Democrats like god damnit now we got to work with them because they actually some of them actually care about people and it's such a dirty like that you could only do that dirty tactic if you don't care about people at all well I think it's been obvious that you know some portion of Congress doesn't genuinely care about people at all I mean considering the types of proposals that they've come up with but one thing to also keep in mind is it goes further than losing you know subsidies that that help you pay for your insurance think about all of the positive things that came out of the Affordable Care Act like the fact that insurance companies can't deny you for a pre-existing condition you can stay on your parent's insurance plan until the age of 26 think about how many people are going to be harmed by just simply repealing it and then maybe maybe they'll come up with a replacement plan later oh no no guys look the way the YouTube explained it I'm now pretty sure this is the route to figure to go I mean I hope not but because then they'll be able to say oh well it's a press is your job to call it 50/50 I mean no Obamacare is going away in in two weeks and you know when the time comes a little bit later and if the Democrats don't work with us it's equally their fault equally their fault right mostly their fault we plan here's our plan right right they'll have a plan Democrats will either join it or not it'll be on the Democrats and and bear in mind that a plan again that makes you be covered with a pre-existing condition that makes you expensive to cover the way insurance companies were able to do that was by forcing people who were extremely healthy to pay for their insurance it I mean it took me a long time to understand that but that's essentially what what the Affordable Care Act was so they're not gonna have that right because they're not gonna sub they're not gonna give the enormous subsidies then that would enable people who can't possibly pay when they're making $21,000 a year in pretty healthy can't possibly get insurance so your good luck finding coverage that that will cover a pre-existing condition because insurance companies we know don't want to cover that and we only have as evidence of that the entire history of the insurance industry so if they go with that plan they're Democrats should scream bloody murder about how they've just taken the American people hostage and they're willing to kill the hostages in this case somewhat literally right but they won't you know the Democrats yeah their messaging is always well yes so some some have fought back really aggressively now Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders and others but if we're left to the Democrats saving the day on messaging we're in a world of trouble finally to the second point that Ben was making look the number one priority of these Republicans is repealing those tax increases on the rich that came with Obamacare so that's why they're like replace like whatever dude as long as we take away those you know those tax increases and hence now they now that they're in the law they'd have to do about eight hundred billion dollars in tax cuts like mission accomplished who cares right there there's a constant talk of Medicaid expansion goes away right if you repeal Obama cares and there's no Medicaid expansion yeah there's constant talk by the Republicans about how what this is urgent we have to act now that is you know what is wait what what changed right no it's that the donors are putting and we covered a story the donors brag about it how they're putting all the pressure on them and one of them from Dallas said we're gonna stop the piggy bank for the Republican unless they get us those tax cuts by repealing the health care bill okay so we know what their objective is it's it's um this is why I get so frustrated with the mainstream press like they cover for the Republican Party they have only one objective there is no if there's no interpretation of the health care bill where it is better for middle-class Americans you can say hey it's better for young guys who are not sick and are never gonna get sick okay good luck with that strategy by the way okay but you can't say that it's better for middle-class Americans and you can't say they care it is obviously their policy proposals but they don't give a damn I got I have to jump in and comment on what you just said real quick because it is true that they're not saying that this health care plan would actually be worse than Americans and by the way I'm basing this off of my own consumption of cable news I've been watching and listening to it quite a bit lately but they do attack the right they they attack the right a lot lately but they specifically attack the right on Russia and Russia alone and I think that that is a miscalculation by the mainstream press I think it's important to cover that story in fact we have a Russia related story in the rundown today however again the thing that Americans care about most are the policies and they need to get actual detailed information about how his policies and how the Republicans in Congress are working tooth and nail really really hard in order to basically do away with any type of positive thing that happened during the body can't stand the mainstream press and corporate Democrats the reason they only stay focus on Russia is because it doesn't hurt the donors at all to talk about Russia but if you talk about - there's six to eight hundred billion dollar tax cut well some people are upset about that so we're good but I mean there are plenty of people who would be named as by some as corporate Democrats who literally are talking about health care every day I mean cory booker every day don't know so and and he would certainly meet the standard of a corporate Democrat youngters now has over six billion lifetime views you know who did that you did that we're now larger than CNN ABC name a news network online we're larger than them and you built all that as everyone scoffed and didn't believe and here we are guys thanks to you build into meta media together
