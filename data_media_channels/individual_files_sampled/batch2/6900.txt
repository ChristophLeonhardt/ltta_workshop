it's incredibly likely that this week will be the beginning of the end for either Obamacare or Trump care cloaked in secrecy with effectively no debate whatsoever Republican senators are working to push through the AHCA as quickly as possible they're going to advance it they're going to vote on it and you will know effectively nothing about what the Senate version of AHCA is until the vote actually happens unless we do something to stop that and so that is going to be the theme on today's show and throughout this week now I want to give a little bit of credit to Claire McCaskill late last week talking with Orrin Hatch over this secrecy I think that she could have gone a little bit harder but she is actually bringing up the issue so let's play this video and then discuss will we have a hearing on the health care proposal will we yes I think we've already had one but no I mean on the proposal that you're planning to bring to the floor of the Senate for a vote will there be a hearing and I get to participate in the process and we are open to ideas and suggestions well I don't know that there's gonna be another hearing but we've invited you too can you say that you're inviting us and I heard you mr. secretary just say we'd love your support for what we don't even know we have no idea what's being proposed there's a group of guys in a back room somewhere that are making these decisions there were no hearings in the house I mean listen this is hard to take well you couldn't have a more partisan exercise than what you're what you're engaged in right now we're not even going to have a hearing on a bill that impacts one-sixth of our economy we're not going to have an opportunity to offer a single amendment it is all being done with an eye to try to get it by with 50 votes and the vice president I am stunned that that is what leader McConnell would call regular order which he sanctimoniously said would be the order of the day I'm just well when the Republicans took the Senate over right we are now so far from regular order the new members don't even know what it looks like if you're coming up as an American trying to understand American politics in the past couple of years I don't think anyone knows a regular order looks like on a wider sense um but yeah he I think he was Federline he asked for someone to tell him what to say there now he's not the problem at the end of the day it's all of them he's all on the get gaming of the day is a problem in the show sir and he is part of the problem but I love this idea that we already had a hearing you had a hear I don't first of all remember that hearing and I don't believe that there was a hero but it wasn't about this bill but yeah but even if they had had it even if he wasn't lying there I mean do you guys remember when they were debating Obama care from the beginning of the debating to the bill actually being passed I think three fast and furious movies came out that's how long it was how many hearings there were how many amendments there were just constantly trying to get Republic to sign onto it here is like well we already spoke once why would we do it again so 20 or 30 million Americans are going to lose their health insurance maybe 30 thousand Americans are gonna die unnecessarily every single year we talk twice about this No and so that's absurd now that's their defense but it we're gonna talk a little bit procedurally how they're trying to advance this more quickly but we do know that this is not just Orrin Hatch's position this is the default position of the Republicans and Senate they're not going to make this clear until at least after the CBO scores it to Senate GOP aides said this we aren't stupid we're still in discussions about what will be in the final product so it is premature to release any draft absent further member conversations and consensus members there being Republicans since the Democrats don't even know what's in the bill and one of the reasons they're not stupid I guess and don't want this to be discussed is summed up in this poll from Quinnipiac showing the approval rating for the HCA is that seventeen percent making Donald Trump look like Justin Bieber that's an old reference I don't know if he's that popular anymore but it's not popular I'll tell you that much yeah a couple things there first of all we you know he said we're not stupid because they know exactly what they're doing they're trying to go the roundabout route with this and get something through without very many people being a part of it so that's what they're saying they're not super we're not stupid politically yeah and that just explains the implicit in that is that they know exactly what they're doing because they are not stupid and they are gonna try and force-feed this the one thing about which to be somewhat encouraged is that there aren't any sort of nationally ambitious or aggressive Republicans on the Senate side who are going to run with this and run as people who think that that by supporting it they need to appeal to Republicans and by opposing it they wound themselves at Bill Cassidy of Louisiana as one to watch and a lot of the moderates have been kind of you know a little bit dull on this a little bit saying hey you know I don't know that we should go ahead with this and now you see them starting to speak a different language about a Dean the of Nevada you've been to Nevada mark Dean Heller Dean Heller is uh is somebody who's up for re-election next year in what is a blue state and he's a Republican he has a lot to do with what happens with this so coming out of them this isn't a done deal but it's still so discouraging to see the process go in the direction that it's gone on this because they're not going through regular order like you said John and they are not telling people what's in this bill you talk about GOP though attaching themselves to this I mean there is not a lot of political capital to be gained by being associated with this bill right remember the GOP so I'd be surprised if it you know it's it should have some ten-foot pole marks all over it because which it did as recently as last week and right now he starts hearing people who are moderate Shelley more capital of West Virginia speaking just kind of a little bit more carefully well maybe it's a little better than it was yeah yeah and so there are those people that are what we don't know for sure if they will support I mean it being at 17% and not in there there are policies that could theoretically be at 17% approval that they would still pass but like the wards Rock exactly yeah but particularly salient when the topic that's so unpopular theoretically will strip your own constituents of their health care and leave their families destitute and they're bad businesses bankrupt I think that will have an effect and we return to those people in the middle that might be swayed just a second but I want to talk again procedurally how are they working on this last week McConnell deployed rule 14 a fast-track procedure that bypasses the committee process and moves the bill directly the floor just as in the house we're on track to have a vote with no hearings when there were more than 100 for the ACA so just in case Orrin Hatch is watching they didn't have just two by the way and knowing the coverage loss will be significant McConnell plans to vote within only days or possibly even hours of the release of the CBO score and before and after the CBO will be discredit by the Pope by the Republicans as much as possible possibly shut down I've heard that uh bandied about as well and so they're not even going to bother with the whole committee procedure but going through that step they're going to pass it immediately to the house or the floor I should say and they're hoping that they get the score they vote on it maybe a basketball game is on or something and you just slip it through and they don't have to worry anymore and that could come within the next couple of weeks theoretically yeah and they also have the white house behind it too and so the white house doing all of whatever it is they're doing trying to get some positive news trying to get you know that the president's been between 34 and 38 percent and approval ratings not not just Quinnipiac which by the way you're from Bridgeport Connecticut Quinnipiac is in Hamden Connecticut you have to be able to say Quinnipiac better it's been like seven years of using Quinnipiac I was fairly certain that I was saying it correct I don't think you were the only direct experience I have with the other than polling is that I played a tennis tournament there once of course when you were in Bridgeport and they were handed and yet you probably said it wrong then too but the point isn't likely that these that that the White House is looking for and the Republicans want to change that tie because they need to be able to say something's going on that isn't Russia that isn't Jared Kushner that isn't the hearings and the special counsel and so they need this to the White House is giving them a lot of leeway they need to show that they can do something right now the summary is look they've got controlled everything and they can't get anything done this may be the wrong I think it clearly you're right at the end of it all they just want to say hey look and we've got this past you know we are we undid that awful Obamacare I just don't know once the dust settles and and they're keeping it dusty so it may not settle for a while what we're really going to be left with I mean if that is to say whether they're going to be left with anything they can be proud of might be another way to put it yeah yeah well as a country we certainly won't be left with anything about everybody also we gotta make them proud by the way are not necessarily that's a good point the benchmark and don't build talking points about what around whatever comes out yeah exactly and we're not going to go through all the stats again we've done it dozens of times over the course of the past year but I mean there's there's perhaps other than maybe climate change related issues are maybe the tax code I don't know if there's a more consequential thing that the Republicans are going to attempt to do during this first term in terms of the impact on American families lives welfare and there to wealth as well I mean the numbers are stark if you're talking about the numbers of hundreds of billions of dollars of effective tax giveaways that are gonna go to the richest Americans the number of Americans are gonna lose health insurance the effect is dire you already know that so we're not gonna go through it again uh but we do want to give you something you can do with this and it's a fairly old-school political thing but here I do think that it could have some effect so if we could bring up this lower third here is a very simple thing so that's the switchboard at the US Capitol where you can talk to you can try to get to at least the office of your senator and they are going to have an aide who's working in particular on their health care policy and you have got to call in and you've got to make yourself heard because as Michael was saying there are some Republican senators who are rightfully horrified about what effect voting for this might have on their electoral prospects the next time around some of them are up in just a year and a half those people can theoretically be persuaded and while it seems ridiculous in this time that they would actually care about people calling into their their offices everything I've read leads me to believe that they do still actually pay attention to that welllook Capitol Hill is trapped that these guys are back there turning the wayback machine in 1950 believe me the phone ringing off the hook matters to these guys they don't they don't know of texting yet really the guys deciding on this are a bunch of old white guys in Washington so yeah ring those phones and we only have two old white guys on this panel so that's we're not the Young Turks you're The Young Turks you power this show together we build something amazing we broken stories like the Donna Brazile story the mainstream media wouldn't break we built the studio we built this network it's now number one all thanks to you guys let's come build it even bigger and stronger TYT Network dot-com /join
