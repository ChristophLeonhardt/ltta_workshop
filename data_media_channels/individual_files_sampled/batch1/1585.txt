can Saudi Arabia get away with murder the kingdom continues to deny Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered or knew about Jamal her shoulders killing Turkey's president is promising to reveal the quotes naked truth about what happened in Istanbul can the Saudis be pressured to hold a credible investigation this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Peter Dobby the naked truth about the killing of Jamaal hachioji Turkey's president is vowing to reveal all on Tuesday three weeks in and this will be the first official release of the details unofficially Turkish sources have repeatedly leaked gruesome accounts of how the journalist was killed and his body dismembered three weeks ago he was missing for two weeks before Saudi leaders eventually admitted his killing by a mistake inside their consulate in Istanbul their story has changed since then the phrase rogue operation is the latest what isn't changing is the kingdom's insistence that the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did not order any killing as the international outcry continues critics are skeptical that the heir apparent didn't know anything about it guess where guests in just a moment but first let's hear now from Turkey's president we are going to make it clear what happened to Jamal keshavjee and God willing on Tuesday I will have a group meeting and hopefully by then I'll be able to find out what happened because we are looking for justice here we want simple and straight justice it will not be achieved by some simple steps we will make everything clear 15 people came here subsequently 18 people are arrested or detained so all these pieces of information need to be clarified and on Tuesday I will go into details of this situation Saudi Arabia's foreign minister says Hitachi's death was quotes a huge and grave mistake Adel al-jubeir denied the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the operation the minister telling Fox News the crown prince is not aware of this even the senior leadership of our intelligence services were not aware of this this was an operation that was rogue the individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority there obviously was a tremendous mistake made and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover it up that was unacceptable in any government these things unfortunately happen we want to make sure that those who are responsible are punished okay let's get going let's bring in our guests today all in Washington we have ali al ahmed who's the director of the gulf affairs institute and a former saudi political prisoner we're also be joined by matthew broadsky a senior fellow with the security studies group in DC and finally on skype is Mustafa Akyol senior fellow with the Cato Institute Center for global liberty and prosperity he's also a contributing writer to the New York Times welcome to you all Ali al Ahmed first if I may come to you how isolated are they feeling in Riyadh right now I believe they feel extremely isolated for the first time the Western governments have targeted not the Saudi Arabia in general but specifically the the rolling family for criticism when you see the UK specifically who has been greatest the greatest defender of the Saudi monarchy making such statements then this is a great indicator of the isolation of Saudi Arabia still however the country or the the government feels it has allies within the Arab world and Egypt and the UAE and others but generally it's in the west its position has diminished greatly in the past two weeks Matthieu coming to you also in Washington what is it about the Saudi leadership they don't seem to understand that since day one they've been hemorrhaging credibility with this right well I think now that it turns out that they decided to say that they were responsible for it or at least elements within the government were responsible for it that it was taking time to figure out exactly how they were going to handle the situation as far as credibility certainly it has taken a shot as a result of this I think a lot of the reporting has also taken a shot and most of the leaks which came out happened to come from state-run news organizations that were that ended up giving out details that happen to turn out not to be true so there was also a way in which other regional governments were of course trying to use this crisis and which in order to benefit themselves but I mean it's a tough situation clearly for the kingdom Mustafa Akyol as far as the ultimate response is concerned and we don't know what that will be yet were probably several weeks away from that perhaps months does that rely on the truth coming from Riyadh not Riyadh's truth not even a truth that's acceptable to Washington the Trump administration but the real truth well first of all let me say that Riyadh taking responsibility in this is not very credible because right after the disappearance of Jamal coccidia the first thing they said for four days after the incident the crown prince said he came in and he left and you can search the consulate we are all safe and you know we're proud nothing nothing went wrong so they insisted that there was nothing wrong and only after weeks of exposures by the Turkish authorities by the Turkish media and ultimately Western media and going after after after they finally had to admit that Jamal Kochi was killed on that day but now they are saying giving us another story saying that he was accidentally killed and so on so forth and I think that's not credible either and I think we will see the exposure of this second line of defense if you will in the days and weeks ahead I think a lot of people who look at this objectively without falling into the agenda of any government that be Ankara or Washington or the art can see that there is really good grounds I think that this was a just yet another operation to crackdown on dissent by either spouted crown prince and his his or her establishments which was the very thing that Jamal Kikuchi was writing about this wisdom what main reason he was out of Saudi Arabia and he had raised his voice and that is the main reason he was killed Ali Ahmed the more that Donald Trump hardens his stance because he has to because he has to react towards what to what people like Mike Pompeo saying does that make the powers that be inside the royal palace in Riyadh does that make them look even more alone absolutely I want to make sure that to point this out that the president Trump despite his detractors has been the the the most vocal American presidents on the Saudi human rights issues in relation to this to this case so no American president before him has even spoken and this way in public and even you know talked about punishment or sanctions and so on but his private feelings apparently are also doubting his public statements I don't take them at face value sometimes but I think his private feelings and some of his public statements are making Riyadh fearful that he may turn against them and let's wait and see but the this is the greatest American reaction to anything coming out of Saudi Arabia it's greater than September 11 and it's different because it's targeting a monarchy this time it's not talk it's not blaming the people of the country or the so-called the extremists in the country it now explaining the monarchy and in particular there the man in charge of the country Mohammed bin Salman and that's to offer Mustafa would the leadership perhaps feel less isolated if they could point the world towards where the body is but if we believe the reports they can't do that because they desecrated the body for Muslim in the worst possible way I think so I mean I don't think they I think they said the minimum they can say for a cover-up they said he accidentally died and we don't know and the body was disposed and they don't even explain how that happened and and this is not a credible story and and Turkish intelligence has been leaking to the Turkish press and and let's say okay Turkey has a political agenda here or some some bias against fiatter but there is evidence there's evidence like oh footage video footage for example showing that a team of hit two hit squad came from Saudi Arabia that day specifically for this ultimately as I think they desecrated the body they turn it into pieces and buried in different parts of Istanbul Turkish police is in search of body parts and if they find that that will be of another you know blow on the now we see as the narrative coming from Saudi air yeah and of course Turks are I mean Turkish sources are speaking of a tape audio tape that was allegedly recorded inside the consulate and how that came to be it's not that clear but if that tape exists and I do think it does based on my context in Turkey and based on what I've heard from other people who might have heard the tape but if that comes out too I think that will be the another blow and let's not forget that for example today Turkish daily initial published and the very important story as well apparently based on some leaks from intelligence sources they have evidence that the head of the squad who killed him al kasha - called the Secretary of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman four times that afternoon the head again goes against the narrative we're now hearing from Saudi Arabia that this was a rogue element a mistake and the crown prince didn't know and now he's going for the after the killers for justice and yet another reason now this is to think that this is not well as we've been hearing during the last twenty days of this saga international pressure continues to map the UK France and Germany are jointly calling for an urgent clarification of what happened they say the Saudi investigation needs to be backed by credible facts the German Chancellor Angela Merkel has suspended arms sales to Saudi first we condemn this act in the strongest terms as we made clear yesterday second there is an urgent need to clarify what happened we're far from having this cleared up and those responsible held to account thirdly if I agree with all those who are saying that there will be it already limited and exports can't take place in the current circumstances Matthew why are the Germans happy to up the pressure in this way up the ante well I mean the Germans or the Europeans have nothing to lose in this and frankly the main pressure is on the United States and on Washington and really that's what this entire affair gets down to is what Washington is about to do about this situation in which case there might be the type of sanctions like according to the Magnitsky Act which is something that was to punish for humanitarian violations that started in the context of Russia of course the u.s. applied those to the interior and justice minister of Turkey when it came to the arrest and detention ongoing detention of pastor Brunson so this is some type of middle ground where the US could sanction some Royals depending on who it would be and still send a hard message that the u.s. is not going to tolerate such type of behavior especially against the press I will say though that the United States especially the Trump administration is quite aware of the deplorable record of many of those who have been in the accusing role right now when it comes to media especially of course how Turkey locks up all kinds of journalists and of course pastor Brunson as it turned out so there are really bad records that need to go the United States might do well to promote a humanitarian type of agenda and a freedom of the press and those type of ideals throughout the region as opposed to merely focusing on Saudi Arabia I mean let's also remember right now the Interpol chief has been gone disappeared apparently resigned so we hear from China no one really talks about that and that kind of seems to be something along the exact same lines that we're seeing here I don't particularly want to get into it but what about these other people conversation Matthew I think we we do need to keep this focused on what we're discussing today ali-a lactMed does King Salman have a clear vision of where he's going with this at the moment I mean King Salman we got you know regardless of what you hear in the media is not in in in in the place or capacity to to run the state his health is not well his age and he is basically isolated he hasn't seen his wife for four years and his son Hamad bin Salman has control absolute control over him his he controls his access so he is he is the the picture in the frame but he is not the person holding the wheel of the of the state it is Mohammed bin Salman you like him or hate him he is the man in charge and he makes all the decisions the father is used as a shield here if Mohammed bin Salman finds it useful so the king is not in a capacity to make any decision himself having said that I think it's important now with the u.s. stirring government it's not enough to rely on Saudi and Turkish investigation that's why an international investigation I think by the UN Security Council to conduct this investigation and this has a strategic value because it's not only going to tell us the truth of what happened and who did what but also it will go it will play an important part in in improving the human rights records of Saudi Arabia and its neighbors because what happens Saudi Arabia is a central country that will impact the rest of the Muslim world and another thing is the the this murder happened in the consulate which is built which is under the control of Adil jubair the Saudi foreign minister so I hope somebody will start talking about what did he know and what was his role because the council is his employee and that some of those people and in the team were Saudi diplomats so let's talk about also Adil Joubert not only MPs and what he knew about this murder and what was his role into it Mustafa let's just stay with that talking point that Ali's just mentioned there the crime Prince aka is also known as mb/s Mohammed bin Salman what's your reading in amongst this isolation that they are apparently feeling in Riyadh what's your reading of the way that we're told it's reported they may just be leaks we can't confirm them that the crown prince does feel dismay he feels Aang he feels confusion because he apparently completely misread the signals when it was coming to the International reaction to what happened yeah I can imagine I'm not the weakest expert on Saudi monarchy and its dynamics but I can imagine that the Saudi Crown Prince is angry at the reactions but what we would he expect or what would anybody who does this expect I mean there is a there's a dynamic here there is this the dynamic of this new young Crown Prince liberalize in his country doing social reforms some good reforms in needed we all praised in the past few years but then uses that to win brownie points in the West and then to crack down on a position and this this Jamal keshiki murder is not an isolated incidents we've read reports in the Washington Post that Saudi officials go to Canada and threaten the Saudi dissidents in Canada saying that go back go back to Saudi Arabia otherwise your family members will go to jail and they said we are giving you the blessings of Crown Prince Salman so this was going on and I think he had this naive idea that he can crack down on dissent silence all his critics and then make whole the whole world loved him and how the world doesn't work that way luckily so ultimately this strategy had blown up and it just worked against him and I want to say one more thing on the what about ISM I think in that voice Turkey my country is not great on press freedom either so let's all honestly about that and I'm a critic of the journalists who are in jail in Turkey for trumped-up charges that that very fact but but this is an incident in itself and something like this is too wild for Turkey no Turkish journalist has ever been killed I mean recently in in his body got lost and every incident I think should be looked at itself in this case Turkish officials Turkish media have been leaking giving to the press helpful information to show what really happened thanks to that we know that the Saudi squad came from Saudi area that day fifteen men into private planes and got the body of Jamal culture and and killed killed him and now as we understand that I mean if that didn't happen we wouldn't know this so the State it's might have their own political interests and political positions they might have on their glass houses but every incident should be I think observed in itself and at this point in the gem architecture incident we have acting a state establishment coat bloody red-handed Matthew the Crown Prince we understand is in charge of reforming his own intelligence services that means point number one how does he do it and point number two it also means his father King Salman clearly still sees him as heir apparent right yeah and I think it would be completely ludicrous to think that there would be reform of intelligence agencies that would be open and transparent and that goes against everything that an intelligence agency is so of course he's going to be the one who redoes the intelligence agency I mean the lesson is hopefully that you can't act in such a manner and get away with it without having some form of punishment but the overall perspective of the United States is of course going to be as you said focused on the long term idea of the 2030 reform plan which the United States stands fully behind it understands the Trump administration that it's going to occur unevenly and this is of course a extraordinary divergence from that plan but the idea of a reformed modernized Saudi Arabian society serving as an example for the rest of the region is something very important and the United States of course needs them in a coalition to push back on Iran which happens to be the number one goal that the president has articulated for the region which outweighs the idea that some are peddling which is that the United States should of course just sever its relationship with Saudi Arabia and then essentially stab itself in the foot as it comes to its own interests and its foreign policy early on I made Jamal Hajj he was undoubtedly at the front line of free thought as that front line now jumped over the border into Saudi Arabia has that front line now found itself inside the inner chambers of the Royal Palace in Riyadh the what I'm getting from the palace that many are shocked and dismayed and fearful of Mohammed bin Salman and the the his action on this you know but killing and murdering the this Joffrey but Saudi Arabia supported by the United State has always silence critics and executed critics and opposition figures and the Saudi monarchy would not have been able to do this and maintain control and deprive room endure for example from driving to be the last country in the world and cinemas without American support I want to make sure that the Saudi Palace would would not have been able to do what it does without American British support so I I disagree completely with the notion that the US is wanting to reform the country building some projects and economic project that's not reform otherwise we should call mister you know Kim jong-un in Korea as a reformer because he actually built more you know buildings in North Korea since he took over then Saudi Arabia did so this is not the real reform this is reform is when when you allow the people a voice when you allow people participation in the government that is a reform but building a project industrial project or something that's not reform these are just merely economic projects and any anybody can do that okay so Ali I just wanted you because I just want to get into one final point if I may Mustafa is this is a huge wake-up call for the Saudis in as much as do what you want in Yemen no consequences pick a fight with the Canadians no consequences steer the GCC blockade of Qatar no consequences snuff out that one reasonable voice of free speech and do it in the way you allegedly did it there will be consequences there should be consequences and president Trump's that there can be smear responses and that should happen whatever that is and I think us should take a much more tough stance against Saudi Arabia they after this incident I also want to say one more thing if there will be a genuine reform in Saudi Arabia that would be turning into a constitutional monarchy not an absolute monarchy where a young prince can come and grab all the power and kill and silence whomever he wants and make some cosmetic reforms but a constitutional monarchy when there's an elected parliament where people can join the system the balance of the monarchy is the power of the mountain monarchy is balanced a system like in Morocco or late-late Ottoman Empire otherwise a despotic Prince may go another one may come may be a good Prince can go by somebody else can come the question is how the constrained power in Saudi Arabia and in the rest of the Muslim world and I think the path for that is structural reform not just one young prince coming up with some fancy ideas and doing some social cosmetic things but also butchering his dissidents in in foreign consulate that's not acceptable and I think that's not the kind of reform that we should go for and we should hail you know in the Muslim world gentlemen we have to leave it there but thank you so much for your time today thanks to all I guess
