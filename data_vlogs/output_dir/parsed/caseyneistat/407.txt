in the morning which is fine makes you
more productive I'm going for an early
morning run with Ryan right now
hi Ryan which way can we get back to our
run now yeah where are you going Ryan

miles in there got a little lost mostly
we just ran around in a circle we did
seven miles but I bet we covered about a
mile look at solid run I needed that I
feel like a new man
shower get dressed breakfast
I can't for the life of me figure out
who had the right-of-way where you're
supposed to stop with the way I'm in
Amsterdam to speak at this big
technology conference which is today
alright hey guys times wanna say that
what is nothing I'm good
I think we're relying on you being late
so it's okay everyone waiting for you
every one of the volunteers are like oh
my god we there you will be met by two
people who will take you and wire you up
for the stage okay
since you are slightly late or not and
then you'll be on ready we're gonna go
you see the stage manager now get Mike
Duff I guess all these computers the
only thing I speak next they're gonna
introduce me in like two seconds my
talks 25 minutes long so we're still 2.8
million followers or as you grown three
point one three point one last
thank you guys
got it
that was super fun that was awesome
if you've ever done public speaking it's
always the audience that makes the talk
the audience here is incredible
back in my hotel for a minute because
I've got to charge up the boosted board
but they're like 20 kids outside this
hotel right now
those people down there
I'm gonna go say hi this is gonna be the
selfie sequence let it go
this is it this is my only free time of
all the time I've had an Amsterdam this
is my only free time the talk is done I
fly out tomorrow I met some people
earlier they highly recommended I check
out a place called Bogle or something
like that local park which is like the
park and Amsterdam beautiful outside I
got a boosted board I'm gonna try to
like soak in as much of Amsterdam as I
can and that's like two hours
kind of a car is this
take care
all right next mission I'm gonna go try
and find a sweatshirt I'm cold I didn't
bring one I do have some concerns about
the boosted board battery but
I've made to the park it's pretty
incredible here it's a friend's birthday
and we have a petting zoo here because
she really loves those
whose support is illegal here they're
legal
I got to fight for four other zeros
booboo support well they'll never catch
me and if they do on that
it's just after 8 o'clock now this park
is incredible I'm so glad I came down
here
alright I'm gonna head back now I don't
think my boosted board has enough juice
to take me all the way back to the hotel
but I'll figure it out I'm trying to go
to sleep these guys are swimming in the
canals
all right really quick what are all
their names he's one with all the names
