OUT OF THIS PROCESS.
STEVE: AS BRETT KAVANAUGH
GETS READY TO DEFEND HIMSELF
ON THURSDAY AT THE BIG
HEARING, WHERE DOES THE
BURDEN OF EVIDENCE LIE?
DOES IT EVEN MATTER IN THIS
CASE?
BRIAN: HERE TO WEIGH IN FOX
NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANNE
ANALYST JUDGE ANDREW
NAPOLITANO.
WHAT CHANGES AFTER THAT
INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT?
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT
ANYTHING CHANGES AFTER THE
INTERVIEW, BRIAN.
IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING
QUESTION.
I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO
HAVE SAID A LOT MORE BUT HE
WAS EXCEPTIONALLY SELF
RESTRAINED AND SAID TWO
THINGS TO MARTHA I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I
HAVE NEVER DONE THIS IN MY
LIFE TO ANYONE AND SECOND, I
WANT THE PROCESS TO BE FAIR.
SHE ASKED UNBELIEVABLY
SUPERB AND DIRECT AND
THOROUGH QUESTIONS.
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD
PREPARED HIM NOT TO GO THERE
IS THIS BECAUSE OF ROE V.
WADE?
OF COURSE IT'S BECAUSE OF
ROE V. WADE.
>> OF COURSE IT'S BECAUSE OF
ROE V. WADE.
IS IT BECAUSE YOU ARE
CATHOLIC?
OF COURSE IT IS BECAUSE IS
HE CATHOLIC.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO THERE
BECAUSE IT OPENS UP A CAN OF
WORMINGS.
WHERE IS THE BURDEN OF
PROOF?
THERE IS NO BURDEN OF PROOF.
THERE IS NO RULES HERE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
HAPPENED.
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT IS THE
IMPRESSION AMONGST THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC AT 5:00 P.M.
ON THURSDAY.
IS THERE IMPRESSION SHE IS
MORE CREDIBLE OR IS THERE
IMPRESSION HE IS MORE
CREDIBLE.
THAT'S WHAT WILL DECIDE.
THIS LOOKING AT FIVE
SENATORS, FIVE REPUBLICANS,
CORKER, FLAKE, MURKOWSKI,
COLLINS AND CAPITO.
THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO THIS IS
AIMED.
APPEAR AN YOU ARE SAYING
CAPITO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A
GIFT TO PRO-LIFE
EVANGELICALS BUT IT'S
ANYTHING BUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I THINK THAT UNTIL TWO
WEEKS AGO THE EVANGELICAL
BASE SUPPORTS THE PRESIDENT
VERY, VERY STRONGLY FELT
THEY HAD BEEN REWARDED BY
HAVING ONE OF THEIR OWN
CATHOLIC, CONSERVATIVE,
TRADITIONALIST.
NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
NOMINATION MIGHT BE IN
TROUBLE.
NOW, THE REACTION TO THAT
COULD BE WHAT YOU GUYS WERE
JUST TALKING ABOUT IN THE
LAST SEGMENT THAT
REPUBLICANS COME OUT IN
DROVES TO EXPRESS THEIR
ANGER SO THAT WOULD BE A
BENEFIT TO THE PRESIDENT.
BUT IF THE REPUBLICANS THINK
IF THE REPUBLICAN BASE
THINKS THAT THE
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IN
THE WHITE HOUSE COULDN'T
MANAGE A NOMINATION AS SAFE
AS THIS, THEY MIGHT STAY
HOME I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY
IT WILL GOVERNMENTAL WE WILL
KNOW AFTER THE BIG TV SHOW
ON THURSDAY:  PERHAPS
DR. CHRISTINE FORD IS
GETTING COLD FEED BECAUSE
HER ATTORNEY SENT BACK TO
CONGRESS A LETTER SAYING
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, I
THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE
A FAIR PRESENTATION OF MY
SIDE AND, YET, YOU
APPARENTLY ARE GOING TO HIRE
A SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR TO
ASK THE QUESTIONS.
AND MITCH MCCONNELL MADE
IT'S A SMEAR CAMPAIGN SPEECH
YESTERDAY ON THE FLOOR OF
THE SENATE.
MAYBE SOME ARE SURMISE SHE
GO IS NOT GOING TO SHOW.
>> IF SHE DOESN'T SHOW THIS
HAS TO BE OVER WITH HE
CANNOT ANSWER AN ALLEGATION
THAT IS NOT CREDIBLY MADE.
AND RIGHT NOW THE ANSWERS HE
GAVE TO MARTHA MCCALLUM LAST
NIGHT AND IN HIS LETTER TO
SENATOR GRASSLEY WERE BASED
UPON AN INTERVIEW IN THE
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND
THE ONE LETTER THAT DR. FORD
WROTE TO SENATOR GRASSLEY.
THAT DOESN'T CUT THE MUSTARD
F SHE HAS ALLEGATIONS OF
THIS MAGNITUDE, SHE HAS TO
STATE THEM UNDER OATH.
BRIAN: EXIT QUESTION ON
RAMIREZ.
THE SECONDS ACCUSER THAT
APPEARED IN THE NEW YORKER
FEATURE.
>> ISN'T THAT TOTALLY
DISCREDITED BY NOW?
BRIAN: SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS
IS ON THE RECORD SAYING I
WANT TO HEAR FROM HER.
>> Judge: I DON'T THINK THAT
WILL HAPPEN.
SENATOR COLLINS IS ON THE
COMMITTEE.
THE COMMITTEE IS FED UP WITH
THE DRIVEWAYS GOING ON.
BRIAN: IF SHE VOTES NO.
>> THEY HAVE NO ROOM TO
SPARE.
IF SHE VOTES KNOW AND
EVERYBODY ELSE THINK IT WILL
BE 50-50 TIE WITH THE VICE
PRESIDENT BREAKING IT.
STEVE: PREDICTION?
>> I THINK THURSDAY WILL BE
HIGH DRAMA.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE HIM,
JUDGE KAVANAUGH A LOT MORE
FORCEFUL.
ALMOST CLARENCE THOMAS LIKE
THAN WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT
BECAUSE HE HAS TO WIN THE
DAY.
BRIAN: JUDGE, GOING TO BE
EXCITING.
>> YES.
BRIAN: YOU CANNOT REST.
KEEP WATCHING.
>> ONE OF THOSE WEEKS.
BRIAN, WERE YOU THERE WHEN I
