listening to the grassroots is essential not only for a leadership race but to win a general election I'm with Jim Carey Hollis and he is essentially the conscience of the PC Party of Ontario he's a man that started acts the carbon tax and take back our PC party and lo and behold it was in protests of the direction that Patrick Brown was taking the party well that was in this is now brown is gone Jim is back and has been formally apologized to and we have a new leader don't know who quite yet but what are you making that first of all a Jim a whole lot of nothing was determined tonight a well finally Jim Carr Helios is back at a PC Party convention Dave because the last convention they had they threw me out because I was campaigning against Patrick Brown's carbon tax last time I talked to you last week at the debate we said it was going to be a nail-biter coin toss I told you and that's what it seems like it is tonight because they've wrapping up the convention and they are still counting ballots so we don't know which way it's going to go but it is a nail-biter but after months of campaigning one thing is clear we've got four candidates all against the carbon tax and Tanya came out of the gate against the corruption in the party and the themes of the take-back RPC party Doug agreed with her so we've seen where the direction of the party's gone recently going in this leadership and Jim in the department of misery likes company you're kicked out of a convention so to where we as the members of the media not given an official excuse but I mean what do you make of that kind of vindictiveness that they would look upon you know a conservative leaning media outlet as media non grata well there's a disconnect between what's going on at the top of this party and the grassroots look it's evidence right here I'm a former member who was running two campaigns one against the carbon tax and one about the corruption in the party and having proper governor governance of the party so think about this we just had a leadership campaign where all four candidates we're talking about opposition to the carbon tax and corruption in the party so the themes of this campaign were driven by someone they threw out of the party is that's a disconnect between what's going on on the ground and the grass roots and what the what the people that are running the party think about that it is astonishing and assuming that it is indeed Doug Ford who is the new leader I mean my goodness what a 180 switch a leader Patrick Brown who was making this party liberal light if you will to someone who is on board with the issues that are near and dear with your heart first and foremost no carbon tax well if Patrick Brown ran on a Pro carbon tax I don't care what the PC Constitution says he would have never been leader to the party but we're seeing the votes we're seeing the votes adding up for those candidates in the race that we're embracing the positions that the grassroots wanted Tonia Granick Allen jumped out of the gate she embraced the take back our PC party themes she talked about corruption she's gonna over perform on the final ballot for someone that no one knew she's gonna do great on the final ballot because she embraced those themes that I've been writing about for six months and dug forward right out of the gate I'm gonna axe the carbon tax it's been a campaign that's been going on for a year and that's why he's got a good shot at winning this thing even Christine initially she benefited from the fact that she was the person who lost to Patrick Brown last time she started out of the gate as the anti Patrick brown candidate she made the right choice on the carbon tax she finally came around to agree that the Constitution had not been followed and they benefited Caroline on the other hand who took two days to figure about what her position was on the carbon tax and who couldn't admit that there was an issue of the party because she was Patrick Brown star Kennedy she underperformed or it looks like she's going to underperform on the final ballot and Jim regardless of who is the leader hopefully comes Sunday or Monday or whenever it's chosen is there not still a lot of housecleaning I know that the clock is ticking but you know more than anyone that there being so many writings that have ended in disarray controversy even outright fraud that we have a criminal investigation in one Hamilton Ancaster West on desk is there enough time to have new nomination writings or is the leader going to have to go with whoever's installed already know that's there's plenty of time I mean not all the nominations have been done but look when I was talking about my campaigns about governance to the party in the Constitution people thought it was eye glazing what's the what's the big deal you know some people even suggested this has happened before and then yesterday on Friday all the media was talking about the BC Constitution when the court challenge came so it's quite clear that is a legal document and it matters democracy matters so we heard today Vick Fedele at the convention talked about the party uniting because there are bigger issues at hand the unit India of the party is easy to do the leader the next leader has to step forward and say we're gonna follow the constitution of the party and we're gonna listen to the grassroots it's not it's not a really dramatic question or a difficult thing to do the next leaders gonna have to address these things and those nominations that were not done in an open public democratic fashion Tanya Granick Allen took the lead on that Doug has agreed with her and I'm hoping whoever comes out ahead is gonna make the right call on those and Jim what do you make of what's happened tonight I mean everyone was thinking oh thank goodness especially after the eleventh hour Court decision of yesterday we are going to have closure we're gonna know a new leader and here we are kept in suspense as I don't know is it is there some tie breaking process going on is that some scrutineering of ballads what do you make of what's going on so I don't have good knowledge I mean if it's a close race and it's neck-and-neck there's gonna be recounts probably I don't really know challenges of votes we don't know they've been locked in a room but this is an example a highlight or an anecdotal example of what happens in an association or political party when the rules are not followed and the Constitution of the parties not followed for two or three years when you park it and when and when the party needs to come together and you've dismissed the Constitution in the past this is what happens at the end and it's not a clean process that it should be but this is why in future this party has to take governance seriously and follow the governance processes that are in place both in the Constitution and traditionally so we avoid this chaos and this party avoids this chaos again because it's not a small thing you know Vic said let's unify because our small differences and he did a great job as interim leader trying to rude out the rot but fair voting and corruption in a voting system and cleaning out that corruption and governance those are not small things Dave those are fundamental to our democracy we can't just roll over and say what's the big deal and one last question Jim is this a measure of vindication for you I mean we go back a few months and Patrick brown is the leader of the party kicked you out of the party suing you now Patrick Brown is yesterday's man and the things you are fighting for are being embraced by the candidates I mean it must feel good well I don't think vindication for me is the word but I'm happy for the supporters of axe the carbon tax and for take back our PC party because for a long time people were dismissing us you know commentators are saying anyone can just put up a website it doesn't mean that the grassroots care you know Patrick Brown was saying the grassroots before the carbon tax so it is vindication for those supporters who came and supported acts the carbon tax and take back our PC Party and candidates like Doug and Tanya embraced the message that these supporters wanted to hear and Carolina and Christine came around at the end of the campaigns so yes grassroots campaigns matter and and and a leadership race is not the time to come up with new ideas and that's why grassroots campaigns matter because they affect the vote and and listening to the grassroots is essential not only for a leadership race but to win a general auction you know it's funny I see so many people walking by they recognize you there doing thumbs up somebody held out a way to go Jim so again good for you Jim and thank you for spending time with us I'm always looking over my shoulder you're welcome back here we're not welcome here I'm looking I don't want that Magilla gorilla security guard to give us the bum's rush again so thank you so much Jim okay hey folks have you heard the rebel has a brand new app please download the rebel app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
