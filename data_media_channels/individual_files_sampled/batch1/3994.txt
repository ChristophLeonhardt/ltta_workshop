he was unable to sell stakes in the fattest country on earth Donald Trump will say that his show Celebrity Apprentice helped my career tremendously he is 100% right he made me look great and I loved working with him and I'm very grateful for being on the show with him you can be very grateful to someone and not want them to be president of all the people who worked on Celebrity Apprentice with Donald Trump I believe I liked him the most of anybody that was on I mean everybody else had horrible things to say about him but I could have enjoyed them I thought that within the framework of a reality television program being capricious volatile unpredictable illogical are all really good qualities having no filter is really good quality but I don't think it's a good quality for a president the funny thing was all I did was I went on a television show and said that I like Donald Trump I don't think he'd be a good president and all of a sudden he started firing out these tweets about how I'm horrible and I'm garbage and my show sucks and I just thought wow is there ever been a politician in history like Abraham Lincoln did he ever go for score and seven years ago there's this magician that isn't that good I think someone Matt Petty in that thin-skinned and that volatile is is not a good person from another you
