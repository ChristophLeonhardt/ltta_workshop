>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

15
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:20,853
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

16
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:21,553
WHAT THE CHAIRMAN REQUESTED.

17
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:23,555
THE MAN THAT JAMES COMEY SENT

18
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,890
THE CONTENTS OF HIS MEMO TO.

19
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,925
THEY WANT TO KNOW ALL THE

20
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:27,860
RECIPIENTS OF THE COMEY MEMOS.

21
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,760
THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT

22
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,462
RICHMAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

23
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:31,964
FBI BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND HE DID

24
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:33,098
HAVE SOME RELATIONSHIP AND DOING

25
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:33,699
SOME WORK FOR THEM.

26
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,467
THEY WANT TO KNOW HIS SECURITY

27
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:36,101
LEVEL.

28
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,903
THE ACCESS THAT RICHMAN HAD TO

29
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:39,471
THE DOJ AND FBI, THE

30
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:40,472
COMMUNICATIONS WITH OTHER

31
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:40,839
EMPLOYEES.

32
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,107
TODAY WAS THE DEADLINE.

33
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:43,141
THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY, WE

34
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,909
UNDERSTAND, HAVE THE DOCUMENTS

35
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,444
BUT A PHONE CALL ABOUT WHEN THEY

36
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:46,845
MAKE ON.

37
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,081
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING AS

38
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:52,117
WELL, AN ORAL PROMISE, ANOTHER

39
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,051
PROMISE MADE TO GET THESE IN THE

40
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:53,919
NEXT FEW DAYS.

41
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:55,888
IS ANYBODY SURPRISED BY THAT?

42
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,856
THAT HAS KIND OF BEEN THE M.O.

43
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,291
HERE.

44
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,359
THAT'S THE PATTERN, WE MIGHT GET

45
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,126
IT TO YOU AND THEN WHEN THEY GET

46
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,362
IT TO YOU IT MAY BE WRITTEN BUT

47
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:04,096
IT'S HIGHLY REDACTED AS WELL.

48
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,098
WE ARE THEN SAYING NO CLEAR UP

49
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:09,434
THE REDACTION, WHY DID YOU

50
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,036
REDACT AND THIS IS A CIRCULAR

51
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:12,070
SWEEP HERE THAT KEEPS GOING ON

52
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,839
AND ON AND IT'S VERY

53
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:14,273
DISHEARTENING.

54
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,875
>> Shannon: OKAY SO THE

55
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:17,643
RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE

56
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:18,343
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS SAID

57
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:18,677
THIS.

58
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:19,845
THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING IN

59
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:22,281
THEIR POWER, THE G.O.P., TO

60
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,149
DISTRACT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

61
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,484
LEGAL TROUBLE AND DISCREDIT THE

62
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:26,251
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS A HEDGE

63
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:28,320
AGAINST THE NEXT ROUND OF

64
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,720
INDICTMENTS.

65
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,421
INCORPORATED ABOUT ALL OF THE

66
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,923
GOOD OUR COMMITTEE MIGHT BE

67
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:31,857
DOING INSTEAD.

68
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:32,891
THINK YOUR RESPONSE?

69
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:34,226
>> THAT'S WRONG ON ABOUT THREE

70
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:34,559
LEVELS.

71
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,228
FIRST OF ALL, THE REASON THAT

72
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:36,962
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LEGAL

73
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:41,033
TROUBLES IS BECAUSE THE DOJ

74
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:46,438
WRONGFULLY SET A WHOLE LITANY,

75
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:47,806
ALL TIMELINE PATTERN OF

76
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:48,640
INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT TRUMP

77
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,142
WHEN HE WAS A CANDIDATE,

78
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,643
INVESTIGATING THE REPUBLICAN

79
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:51,944
PARTY.

80
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:52,711
WHEN JERRY SAID THAT WE COULD BE

81
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,314
DOING OTHER THINGS, NAME ONE.

82
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:59,484
WE TRY TO DO IMMIGRATION AND

83
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:00,452
THEY PUT THE BRAKES FOR THAT.

84
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:02,287
IF YOU GO BACK FOR THE FIRST SIX

85
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:03,021
MONTHS WHEN I WAS ON JUDICIARY

86
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,424
COMMITTEE YOU WILL HEAR JERRY

87
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:06,925
ADLER AND HIS COLLEAGUES, EVERY

88
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,592
TIME WE WOULD TALK ABOUT

89
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,696
IMMIGRATION, NAVY INTELLECTUAL

90
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:12,931
PROPERTY, EVERYTHING WAS ON

91
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,566
RUSSIAN COLLUSION AND NOW THEY

92
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,868
ARE MOM ON THAT BECAUSE THE ONLY

93
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,437
POLLUTERS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

94
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:19,137
PARTY WITH THE FBI HONCHOS.

95
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:20,906
>> Shannon: WE ARE A YEAR INTO

96
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,240
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

97
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,309
INVESTIGATION.

98
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:25,844
WE FED FOLKS SPEAKING OUT FROM

99
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:26,545
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE SAYING

100
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:29,047
THERE'S NO CONCRETE HARD

101
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:29,848
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.

102
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:31,516
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY THERE

103
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:32,517
ARE CIRCUMSTANTIAL THINGS, BUT

104
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:34,219
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET.

105
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,087
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INDICTMENTS

106
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,289
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ABOUT CRIMES

107
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,224
THAT AREN'T RELATED TO

108
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:39,591
COLLUSION.

109
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,059
THINGS ABOUT LYING TO A FEDERAL

110
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,861
INVESTIGATOR OR FINANCIAL CRIMES

111
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:43,962
THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THESE FOLKS

112
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:44,830
WERE CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO THE

113
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,197
PRESIDENT.

114
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,365
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

115
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:49,034
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

116
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,303
>> WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT IS

117
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:53,472
THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE

118
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,873
DIRECTED BY HIS BOSS, THE

119
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,274
ATTORNEY GENERAL, TO PULL THE

120
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:57,642
PLUG ON THIS INVESTIGATION,

121
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:58,410
WHICH AS YOU'VE SAID --

122
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,813
>> Shannon: CAN HE?

123
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:03,048
HAVING BEEN RECUSED.

124
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,082
>> YOU ARE THE GUY SUPPOSED BE

125
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,717
RUNNING THIS, LET'S MAKE IT

126
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:06,451
WORK.

127
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,020
MR. ROSENSTEIN PROBABLY SHOULD

128
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,286
GO.

129
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:09,187
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED HE SHOULD

130
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,088
GO.

131
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,356
BUT MUELLER IS CLEARLY OUTSIDE

132
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:12,257
HIS BOUNDS.

133
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,760
WE ARE TALKING MANAFORT FROM

134
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,227
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

135
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:18,063
WE ARE TALKING PAPADOPOULOS HAS

136
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,565
NOTHING REALLY TO DO WITH THIS.

137
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,800
THEY THEMSELVES HAVE AGREED,

138
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,101
EVERYBODY WHO HAS LOOKED AT THE

139
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,302
SAID THERE'S NO COLLUSION HERE

140
00:03:24,302 --> 00:03:26,071
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

141
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:26,671
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE.

142
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:27,939
THAT MEANS YOUR PURPOSE IS GONE,

143
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:29,841
PULL THE PLUG, BUT WE DON'T

144
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:30,776
REALLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE

145
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,943
ROSENSTEIN WON'T GIVE US THE

146
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:32,477
SCOPE LETTER.

147
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,678
>> Shannon: WHICH OUTLINES

148
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:34,713
WHAT AUTHORITY THE SPECIAL

149
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,249
COUNSEL HAS TO LOOK INTO THINGS.

150
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:37,816
IT'S HEAVILY REDACTED.

151
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:40,052
I KNOW YOU HOPE YOU WILL GET IT.

152
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,120
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL GET IT

153
00:03:42,120 --> 00:00:00,000
ON REDACTED?
