NORMALIZE THEIR RELATIONS AND HAVE THE AMBASSADORS BACK AND FORTH TO OPEN UP DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. MANY MEETINGS AHEAD. Sean: HERE WITH REACTION, FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT, DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA AND RETIRED SEAT BY A SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, DANIEL HOFFMAN. I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT BOTH OF THEM WILL BE WITH THIS PROGRAM IN SINGAPORE. SARAH CARTER WILL BE THERE AS WELL, AS OF COURSE THE IG REPORT, TWO DAYS AFTER THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT. LOTS OF GROUND TO COVER TONIGHT. LET'S START WITH YOU DANIEL HOFFMAN. THE PRESIDENT SHOWING STRENGTH, I WILL WALK AWAY ANY TIME. IT'S RIGHT OUT OF THE ART OF THE DEAL, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. I BELIEVE I KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE WOULD ABSOLUTELY WALK AWAY IN FOUR SECONDS. I THINK HE IS ALSO DOING THE RIGHT THING BY MANAGING EXPECTATIONS, HE'S DEALING WITH DECADES OF FAILED POLICY, FROM WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE SUNSHINE POLICY WHICH WAS MORE LIKE THE MOONSHINE POLICY FOR NORTH KOREA AT THE END OF THAT 10-YEAR PERIOD, WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN $3 BILLION FROM SOUTH KOREA AND ALMOST $2 BILLION FROM CHINA, INCREASED OF THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY, AND WE HADN'T BEEN A COLORIZED OR TAKEN MANY STEPS TO DO NEWCO RISE THE PENINSULA. THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN ON BOARD ALL OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PAST AND I THINK HE IS REALLY WELL PREPARED TO GO FORWARD WITH A REALLY BOLD STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THIS CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE. I THINK THE CHALLENGE WILL BE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES FROM THE SIX PARTY TALKS LIKE RUSSIA AND CHINA WHO ARE MEDDLING, AND NOT ALWAYS HELPFUL ON THE PART OF RUSSIA TO SOLVING THE CRISIS. Sean: YOU KNOW SOMETHING COME UP THE WORLD WOULD BE A LOT BETTER OFF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE KIM JONG UN AND THE KOREAN PENINSULA THREATENED BY NORTH KOREA. AND ENDING THE KOREAN WAR, DR. GORKA SEEMS TO ME TO BE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA AND WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE WORLD. WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT KIM JONG UN WILL TALK ABOUT COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF HIS REGIME. GOOD FOR THE WORLD. AFTER 65 YEARS, ABSOLUTELY. JUST THE ABSURDITY THAT THIS WAR IS STILL REALLY, ACCORDING TO THE LACK OF A PEACE TREATY, IN EFFECT. IT'S JUST A CEASE-FIRE. SO, YEAH, LET'S DO IT. LET'S GO THERE, BUT STAY NUCLEAR AS THE PENINSULA. THIS ISN'T A DICTATORSHIP THAT WILL FALL TOMORROW. IT WON'T SOLVE ALL OF THE PENINSULA'S PROBLEMS, BUT IF ANYONE CAN END THE WAR OR DO YOU NEED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. Sean: AGREED. IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU THAT A REPORTER'S NOTES AND SOURCES AND EVERYTHING DOJ HAS OBTAINED, DR. GORKA, INSTINCTIVELY THIS SOUNDS REALLY BAD TO ME. I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE PRESIDENT IS A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT OR WHO THE REPORTER WORKS FOR. THAT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION BEING DEMANDED OR CAPTURED FROM THE DOJ COME ON WHAT BASIS? Sean: AND AT THE BAR IS VERY HIGH, AS WE KNOW. ALL RIGHT, I WILL GET TO BE WITH
