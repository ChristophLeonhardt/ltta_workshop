yeah German Chancellor and her party leaders are holding crunch talks on the possibility of going back to the same coalition which governed the country before September's poll MPs do say the so-called grand coalition with the second-largest party the Social Democrats is the only way to effectively govern the country talks began on Sunday night and will continue through Monday after negotiations on a three-way coalition with other groups broke down with more here's our Europe correspondent Peter Oliver two months out from September's general election in Germany still no government and we appear to be going round and round when it comes to what the solution to that problem will be we heard from German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the weekend saying that she wanted to form a government in the country as soon as possible and saying that she welcomed and valued talks with the Social Democrats over potentially forming a new grand coalition we should value possible talks with the Social Democrats of course we're prepared to have talks we have been in a grand coalition for the last four years and we have done a good job we achieved a lot well in order for those grand coalition talks to go ahead it's half the results in a massive 180 turn around from a Martin Schultz the Social Democratic Party leader pretty much since the first ballots were counted back in September he was saying there was no chance of his party going back into coalition with Angela Merkel he has certainly changed his tune on that of course the SPD and the acting federal governments will continue to work together there is no other way only one thing is now completely clear the talks must be carried out so that in this way we can always defend our institutions the members of our party would agree on that but when it comes to what options are left everything is essentially on the table we can have a coalition in Germany we could have a minority government in Germany or everybody goes back to the polls for fresh elections in Germany now previously Angela Merkel had said that she favored new elections over a minority government well it now seems she certainly doesn't favor actions at all either and another change in in this world increasingly complicated saga as Germany tries to find her a new government but when we're looking at the will of the people to go to the latest polls 63% of Germans who were polled said that they wanted to see new elections in the country compare that to 29% who said they wanted a minority government when it comes to the coalition talks that broke down that was of course the Jamaica coalition a four party coalition and Angela Merkel was trying to put together 57 percent of Germans almost 60% saying that they were saddened but those talks broke down perhaps the reason for that is that Jamaica coalition promised to bring new faces and fresh ideas into the government particularly if you look at the Free Democrats the party that opted and walked out of talks causing that coalition to collapse they wanted to particularly bring in new legislation very different legislation when it came to refugees in migrants than the Merkel government had in place but it does seem as it stands at the moment and these things are thrown to change that the best option at the moment the most likely option at the moment would be and not new faces but a reformation of the old gang in the grand coalition that had ruled Germany before the elections in September
