“I mean, we knew — they said
that this storm was coming.
But I blew it off,
I swear I did.
I would say, ‘Oh, you know,
we’ve heard this before.’
And then a tree fell
through my apartment.
So I felt it real stupid
after saying that.
It breaks my heart.
It’s really heartbreaking
because I don’t really
have a home to go to now.
I have keys
and my rent is paid,
but I don’t have a home.”
This is what’s left of
Douglas Smallwood’s home
after Hurricane Florence
ripped through Wilmington, N.C.
“So we’ve
come back here.
You can see that
this tree here,
it hit the roof
of this building
and it just plummeted
to my apartment.
My apartment means
a lot to me
because I worked
very hard to get it.
You know, I saved
up a lot of money.
I stayed with my sister
for a little while —
was prepared to start
a new home.
I always say, I have
a great apartment.
It’s in the back.
It’s quiet.
But when you’re dealing
with a hurricane,
I was really concerned
about these trees and —
it’s just real sad.”
Douglas just moved
into this apartment
two months ago.
When he heard
about the hurricane,
he quickly evacuated
to his sister’s house
in the northwest of the city.
But he wasn’t the only
one who was hit hard.
The entire city of
Wilmington was affected.
Record rainfall
and wind damage
downed trees and
flooded neighborhoods,
isolating many of Wilmington’s
roughly 119,000 residents.
Local and
out-of-state firefighters
rushed to rescue more
than 450 stranded people
from flash floods here.
The waters have now
receded, but there are still
more flash flood warnings,
and the river
may crest again.
“We’ve got a lot of trees
that are down
on houses,
around their driveways.
We can also tell where
there’s been
quite a bit of flooding
up into the yards
and even up to the houses.
A lot of these areas where
we’re pulling people out of,
they’ve lived there
for 20, 25 years.
They’ve never
seen it that high —
and they were always told it
would never get that high there,
but obviously it did.”
And even as the sun started to
peek back in the coastal city,
thousands of people
are still without power
or stranded by floodwaters.
For residents like Douglas,
that means cleanup
won’t begin for another few days.
“When you actually
see the damage
that’s done to the inside,
it’s mind-boggling.
Oh, the tree’s right there.
That’s the tree, right there.
So it fell in, right here
on top,
caved the window structure in,
completely broke it.”
For now, without
renter’s insurance
and more flood warnings
on the way, the hard work
for Douglas is just beginning.
“And nothing else in here
really I want to look at.
This is all just demolished —
all of my picture frames.
So, farewell apartment.
I’ll see ya.
I probably won’t be back
in here no time soon.”
