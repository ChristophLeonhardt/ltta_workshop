michael steele is something NFL's PR problem yeah for the for the time being look this is one of those compromise you had owners like jerry jones who were very adamant in in the argument that there should be a high price to pay for these types of protests i think they didn't go as far as they didn't do in a basketball but the fact of the matter is this seems to be the space even though the NFL Players Association the union is upset on behalf of the players I think this works itself out it's this is a such a non-story well I agree it's a non-story except that they've continued to play into it I don't know why the NFL leaves it bothers with it exactly that I don't get to me though they've actually created I Ruth what I don't get here is so they're saying they don't want players to express their political views but the players have to abide by the owners political views that's what this comes across as well the players aren't the the good news about this policy is that the players aren't conscripted to stand there when they don't want to be standing there I personally don't see what the big deal is about kneeling kneeling feels like a pretty respectful activity to me but the players aren't able to expand in an appropriate respectful way express their views they can either they don't have to be conscripted but they don't get to you know remember the a fleet with the Black Power salute if they don't get to express their views during that time I have never understood why it was so disrespectful to the flag to to have a cow about them doing it seems to me to be respectful to the Constitution to allow some let's put up the Mike Pence Twitter feed today yeah I understand I mean Mike Pence beliefs hey winning that's what he tweeted winning charlie so winning by silencing win it winning or winning ed you're like cuz you got the NFL to be cowed by Donald Trump I did the long term solution of all this is just to D politicize the games entirely dude we didn't used to have all these you know let's stand and sing god bless america and the seventh-inning and well you know this is go back to the pageantry of the hyper patriotism after 9/11 Sports really doesn't necessarily need any of that and it's just asking for trouble all the different times when we've gotten into these things about doing the national anthem I think it was a world war one respectful thing it's always been around a time of when we've been in you know about our democracy and stuff like that so it's showing respect in a moment tying the yellow ribbon when the hostages are there we're not we're not in that no but that's the thing Chuck it's a moment in a game it is the beginning of the game it is the seventh inning in baseball those moments they're nice but they now seem to consume the sport and that's what I think the owners and the management of these teams have to get away from this is not a playground for you to express your political ideology day in and day out game after game you're there to play the game and you take that moment to your point Ruth you can either go on the field and stand or you can stay in the locker room struggling with this is the NFL whose ownership demographic is closer to Trump exactly or the other school that's it not baseball not bastard that's right the old and you can't tell me that isn't a part of this if it weren't for the ownership demographic right we wouldn't be having that NFL would have ignored Trump yes but you know but Trump went on is his rampage against the NFL and Trump argued don't know we I guess we're back to James clapper territory about what the impact is that that ran his rampage and the NFL players behavior was responsible for lower lower ratings who knows but they clearly were responsive and look on the culture wars Trump's people follow Trump's lead they watch Roseanne because Roseanne's pro-trump hey I watch rows in I know but I'm saying they got that extra man I watched football but you know in some ways this is good for the NFL just because we're not talking about concussions and this stuff is trivial you're right they actually have an existential threat to their game that's much bigger they're wrecking their brains to play the game yes when you think about that you can't enjoy the game when you watch it and so let's think about this instead Charlie it's rock drop Debra hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more beat the press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
