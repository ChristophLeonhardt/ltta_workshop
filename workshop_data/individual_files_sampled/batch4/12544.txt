I gotta tell you about this insane paper it's really funny this insane paper from an author and Helen Wilson is a peer-reviewed journal okay it's a peer-reviewed journal in in an actual feminist academic journal and the article is titled I kid you not human reactions to rape culture and queer poor my poor Matt performativity at urban dog parks in Portland Oregon let me read that again human reactions to rape culture and queer performativity at hew at urban dog parks in Portland Oregon I can't even get it out it's so stupid and it's based on approximately 1,000 hours of observing dogs and their owners the author Helen Wilson claims there was one dog rape humping incidents every 60 minutes so the dogs are sexist according to Wilson this is not a joke the corn Cassie Dylan over at Daily wire dog parks are just the place to observe toxic masculinity and heterosexuality quote dog parks are microcosms or hegemonic masculinity and queering behavior and compulsory heterosexuality can be observed in a cross-species environment according to Wilson dog parks are oppressive spaces that lock both human and the animals into a geminate patterns of gender conformity adding a pressure of patriarchal norms reached Zenith reached their Zenith in dog parks and then it gets even where nobody can actually say whether this woman has a PhD she says she has a PhD in feminist studies and these the lead researcher for the Portland on gender research initiative so that the academic journal is called the Journal of feminist geography I can't believe this is real I mean if this is real it's just it's just unbelievable maybe one of the reasons that heterosexuality is the norman dog parks is because dogs in order to reproduce have to have sex with other dogs of a different sex I'm not sure how these dogs actually self-identify but I don't think it matters at the dog park because everything is terrible and weird so just well done everyone what why don't we take women's studies more seriously folks why don't we take feminism more seriously nobody knows
