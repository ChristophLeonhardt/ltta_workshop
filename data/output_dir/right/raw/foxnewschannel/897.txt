1
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:09,088
THIS IS THE FIVE.

2
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:10,756
AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT AT THE

3
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:11,724
WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING,

4
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:13,059
PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING HIS WAY

5
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:15,661
THROUGH A MOB OF REPORTERS FOR

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:18,431
AN IMPROMPTU INTERVIEW ON

7
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:18,898
"FOX & FRIENDS."

8
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:21,200
THE PRESIDENT THEN ON LOADING ON

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,436
TOP FBI BRASS ON THE

10
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:24,103
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT.

11
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,738
>> AT THE TOP PEOPLE WERE

12
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:26,639
HORRIBLE.

13
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:27,840
WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO COME

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,643
UP THEY WERE PLOTTING AGAINST MY

15
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:31,010
ELECTION.

16
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,980
THE IG REPORT WITH A HORROR

17
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,047
SHOW.

18
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,783
IF YOU LET THE FBI TAKE A REPORT

19
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,920
OF THE REAL FBI, NOT THE SCUM ON

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,522
TOP.

21
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:43,656
I THINK THE REPORT YESTERDAY MAY

22
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,791
BE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN

23
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,227
ANYTHING, IT EXONERATES ME.

24
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:49,662
>> Kimberly: THE PRESIDENT

25
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:55,134
ALSO TOOK AIM AT AIM AT SPACE

26
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:57,336
SPECIAL AGENT PETER STRZOK.

27
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,070
>> President Trump: I AM

28
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,238
AMAZED THAT PETER STRZOK IS

29
00:00:59,238 --> 00:00:59,872
STILL AT THE FBI AND SO IS

30
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:02,275
EVERYONE ELSE THAT      DUMB LIE

31
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:02,308
EVERYONE ELSE THAT      DUMB LIT

32
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:02,341
EVERYONE ELSE THAT      DUMB LIA

33
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:02,575
EVERYONE ELSE THAT      DUMB LIT

34
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:02,909
BEFORE.

35
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:04,443
AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT

36
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:07,113
THE REPORT, I'M TALKING ABOUT

37
00:01:07,113 --> 00:01:09,248
LONG BEFORE THE REPORT.

38
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:12,685
>> Kimberly: PRESIDENT TRUMP

39
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:13,686
HAMMERING FIRED FBI DIRECTOR

40
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:14,120
JAMES COMEY.

41
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,820
>> President Trump: IF THEY

42
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,922
SEEM LIKE VERY CRIMINAL ACTS TO

43
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:16,255
ME.

44
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,057
WHAT HE DID WAS CRIMINAL, WHAT

45
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,560
HE DID WAS A TERRIBLE THING TO

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,060
THE PEOPLE.

47
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,962
WHAT HE DID WAS SO BAD IN TERMS

48
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:27,833
OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE

49
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,901
WELL-BEING OF OUR COUNTRY WHAT

50
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,436
HE DID WAS HORRIBLE.

51
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:33,573
SHOULD HE BE LOCKED UP?

52
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:36,075
WE WILL LET THEM MAKE THE

53
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:36,509
DETERMINATION.

54
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,077
>> Kimberly: STRONG WORDS

55
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:39,845
COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT THIS

56
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:42,815
MORNING IN AN IMPROMPTU

57
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,918
CONFERENCE THERE, SPEAKING WITH

58
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:47,453
STEVE DOOCY.

59
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,422
AND THE OTHER DEUCE HE WAS THERE

60
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:52,058
AS WELL.

61
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:52,892
IT WAS A DOOZY SANDWICH.

62
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:57,163
>> DOUG DUCEY DEUCE.

63
00:01:57,163 --> 00:02:00,466
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

64
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,834
AND REVIEW FROM THE PRESIDENT,

65
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:04,303
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT HE

66
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,504
SAID ABOUT STRZOK, THAT GUY

67
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,039
SHOULD NOT BE THERE.

68
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,041
AND A STRZOK OF IT AND HIS

69
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,276
COMPATRIOTS, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY

70
00:02:10,276 --> 00:02:11,244
ARE MEMBERS OF THE RESISTANCE

71
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:13,279
THE WAY THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP

72
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,046
SUPPORTERS.

73
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:17,783
THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE ALL

74
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:21,687
MIDDLE-CLASS, UNEDUCATED, LAZY

75
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:22,688
POS'S, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

76
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:26,225
STANDS FOR.

77
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,861
AND HE SAYS WE WILL STOP THEM TO

78
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,096
LISA PAGE.

79
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:32,865
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PRO TRUMP

80
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,066
TEXT.

81
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,068
THERE'S NOT ANY ANTI-HILLARY

82
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,237
TEXTS, IT'S ALL AGAINST THE

83
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:39,872
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

84
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,274
SO WHEN THE IG REPORT COMES OUT

85
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,842
AND SAID THERE'S NO POLITICAL

86
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,210
BIAS, THERE IS EXTREME POLITICAL

87
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,510
BIAS.

88
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,078
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY COULD SAY

89
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:47,713
THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.

90
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:49,982
IT WAS ANTI-TRUMP FROM THE JUMP,

91
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:52,618
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU LOOK

92
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,687
AT JAMES COMEY, HE KNEW LORETTA

93
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,490
LYNCH AND HER BOSS,

94
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,958
BARACK OBAMA, DIDN'T WANT

95
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,592
HILLARY CLINTON CHARGED.

96
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,627
HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP THE FIRST

97
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,095
FEMALE PRESIDENT FROM TAKING

98
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:03,929
OFFICE.

99
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,498
THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THE FBI

100
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:06,265
AGENTS WERE INTIMIDATED AND THEY

101
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:08,434
DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO TOUGH,

102
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,037
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WHEN SHE

103
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,872
GETS INTO THE OVAL, SHE WAS

104
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:14,840
GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON THEM.

105
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,275
THEY KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE

106
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,644
PRESIDENT AND THAT'S WHY THE FIX

107
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:19,145
WAS IN.

108
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:20,479
THEN ONCE TRUMP OUT THE

109
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,847
NOMINATION THEY TURNED THE

110
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:23,949
SCREWS TO HIM AND TREATED HIM

111
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,919
AND HIS PEOPLE VERY UNFAIRLY.

112
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,487
THE WAY COMEY BEHAVED DURING

113
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:32,825
THIS WHOLE TIME, HE USED PRIVATE

114
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:33,125
EMAIL.

115
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,061
HE EXONERATED HILLARY.

116
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,896
HE CHANGED THE LANGUAGE OF THE

117
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:40,266
LAW TO MAKE IT ABOUT INTENT, AND

118
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,069
INTENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

119
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:43,703
IT.

120
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:46,305
THIS REPORT JUSTIFIES TRUMP'S

121
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:49,075
FIRING OF JAMES COMEY, AND

122
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,042
PRETTY MUCH EXONERATES A

123
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,944
PRESIDENT WITH REGARD TO WHAT HE

124
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:54,146
HAS BEEN SAYING ABOUT THE

125
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,749
HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

126
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:57,550
IT WAS CROOKED AND REMAINS EVEN

127
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:57,983
MORE CROOKED.

128
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:01,654
>> Kimberly: BUT JESSE, WHAT

129
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:02,755
JAMES COMEY IS CRITICIZED FOR IN

130
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,657
THE AG REPORT, THE THINGS HE

131
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:06,258
DID, GOING OUT IN JULY AND

132
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,860
HAVING THAT PRESS CONFERENCE,

133
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,096
GOING IN OCTOBER AND TALKING

134
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,864
ABOUT REOPENING THE

135
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:13,265
INVESTIGATION, THOSE THINGS ALL

136
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,401
HELPED DONALD TRUMP.

137
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,101
IT DIDN'T HURT HILLARY.

138
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,904
>> HE COULD HAVE CHARGED HER AND

139
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,539
TAKEN HER TOTALLY OUT OF PLAY.

140
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,709
>> LET ME COUNTER BACK THOUGH.

141
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,511
THERE ARE A LOT OF FBI OFFICERS,

142
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,146
MOST OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

143
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:28,914
TENDS TO LEAN CONSERVATIVE.

144
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,717
>> HAVE YOU HEARD THEM TALK?

145
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:32,685
THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE

146
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:33,319
CONSERVATIVES.

147
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,720
>> LET ME FINISH.

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,522
IF THIS DEEP STATE

149
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:37,923
LAW ENFORCEMENT FBI GROUP WANTED

150
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:38,657
TO TAKE DOWN DONALD TRUMP, WHY

151
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,961
DIDN'T THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT

152
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:42,728
HIS CAMPAIGN WAS UNDER

153
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:43,162
INVESTIGATION?

154
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,865
>> THEY DIDN'T THINK HE WAS

155
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:47,233
GOING TO WIN.

156
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,701
>> IF THEIR GOAL WAS TO TAKE HIM

157
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,870
DOWN, WHICH I DON'T THINK IT WAS

158
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,405
THEN WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

159
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:57,476
WHY DIDN'T THEY LEAK -- >> THEY

160
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,745
DID LEAK TO THE TIMES IN

161
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:00,079
OCTOBER.

162
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,249
>> THEY WERE QUITE CERTAIN OF

163
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,350
THAT AS A DETERMINATIVE OUTCOME

164
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,184
WHICH WAS THAT HILLARY CLINTON

165
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:09,455
WAS GOING TO BECOME THE

166
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:10,456
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

167
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,858
THEN THEY SHIFTED TACTICS AND

168
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:14,860
MOVED TOWARDS UNDERMINING THE

169
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,462
CANDIDACY OF DONALD TRUMP AND

170
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:17,430
ULTIMATELY THE PRESIDENT.

171
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,064
SO THIS IS JUST PART OF WHAT IS

172
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,699
GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD IN

173
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,668
TERMS OF THE IG REPORT.

174
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,470
YOU HAVE THOSE REVELATIONS BUT

175
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,274
KEEP IN MIND, THOSE DOCUMENTS,

176
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:29,041
THE VOLUMINOUS AMOUNT AND PAGES

177
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:33,078
THAT WE SAW, THOSE ARE STILL

178
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:34,079
REDACTED BY ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHO

179
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,716
IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

180
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,652
NEFARIOUS CIRCLE OF MALFEASANCE.

181
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:40,619
>> THERE STILL A LOT OF

182
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:41,687
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED HERE.

183
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,456
YOU'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON

184
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,124
WHO HAD HELPED AND WHO WOULD

185
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:46,292
HURT, BUT ISN'T THE PROBLEM THAT

186
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,461
THERE WAS POLITICS TO BEGIN

187
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:48,761
WITH?

188
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:51,897
THE SAD THING TO ME IS, YOU HAVE

189
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:52,765
OVER 100,000 PEOPLE THAT WORK

190
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:55,134
WITHIN DOJ AND MANY OF THEM ARE

191
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:55,901
GREAT PEOPLE.

192
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,735
THE PRESIDENT POINTED THAT OUT

193
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:58,003
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO

194
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,505
MAKE BECAUSE YOU FEEL FOR THEM

195
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:00,539
IN THIS MOMENT.

196
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,608
THEY ARE THE ONES DOING THEIR

197
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:03,209
JOB THAT ARE POLITICAL.

198
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,679
THERE WILL BE A HEARING ON

199
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:07,847
MONDAY, AND TUESDAY I BELIEVE IN

200
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,882
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.

201
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,484
THE BIG QUESTION, KIMBERLY, DOES

202
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,253
ACTION NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT

203
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:15,721
LUNGED NOT JUST PETER STRZOK AND

204
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,023
LISA PAGE ABOUT OTHER AGENTS?

205
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,258
THEY SAID TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT

206
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:21,527
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OF THE

207
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,428
PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT

208
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:24,463
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

209
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:25,197
SO WHERE DOES THIS END?

210
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:29,668
DO THEY SAY, THAT'S PRETTY BAD,

211
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:30,903
LET'S MOVE ON?

212
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:32,238
OR DO THEY LEARN FROM IT?

213
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,673
>> THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

214
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:35,307
SAYING, CONTINUE THE

215
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,909
INVESTIGATION AND FIND OUT IT

216
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,777
WHAT IF ANY ACTION NEEDS TO BE

217
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:39,178
DETERMINED.

218
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:43,549
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO JAMES

219
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:44,583
COMEY.

220
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,019
>> CAN WE FIRST ADDRESS WHAT

221
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:52,658
HAPPENED THIS MORNING WHICH WAS

222
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:53,092
IN GENERAL?

223
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:54,860
THIS IS THE TRANSCRIPT I HAD TO

224
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,862
COME UP IT'S 50 PAGES.

225
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,031
THE MEDIA SHOULD STOP AND THANK

226
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,866
DONALD TRUMP FOR BEING THE MOST

227
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:01,634
TRANSPARENT PRESIDENT.

228
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:05,838
HE TALKS FOR 51 MINUTES ABOUT

229
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:06,238
EVERYTHING.

230
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,473
FORGET THE IG, HE'S THE OG.

231
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:13,479
>> HE WENT LIKE 300 DAYS ALMOST.

232
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,049
THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN

233
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,684
DONALD TRUMP'S WORLD AS, NO

234
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:19,018
COMMENT.

235
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,053
IF YOU LET HIM GO, AT SOME POINT

236
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,489
HE WILL SAY YOUR NAME.

237
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,691
WE SAW THAT WITH STUART VARNEY.

238
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:28,060
IF HE KEEPS TALKING, HE WILL

239
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,662
SAY, KITTENS ARE JUST LIKE

240
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:33,165
UNICORNS, BUT SMALLER.

241
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:37,069
SO THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE ACTUAL

242
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,637
PRESSER, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS

243
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:39,371
FANTASTICALLY ENTERTAINING AND

244
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,240
WILL GIVE US THREE SEGMENTS

245
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,041
TODAY ON FRIDAY.

246
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,611
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG

247
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:48,847
DEAL.

248
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:52,751
HERE, THE TEXT BETWEEN PETER

249
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:55,354
STRZOK AND LISA PAGE.

250
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,256
90% OF MY TEXTS ARE CARELESS AND

251
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,724
HYPERBOLE.

252
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,326
AT THE TIME I'M KIND OF BUZZ

253
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:03,662
WHEN I TEXT PEOPLE.

254
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,265
>> THEY ARE FRIGHTENING.

255
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:06,599
[LAUGHS]

256
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,701
>> WHEN YOU READ A FELLOW

257
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:09,668
INVESTIGATOR SAYING COME UP THEY

258
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:12,304
WILL STOP TRUMP, IF THAT'S NOT

259
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:14,273
POLITICAL BIAS, WHAT CONSTITUTES

260
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:14,907
POLITICAL BIAS?

261
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:15,941
THERE'S ALMOST NO STEP BEYOND

262
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:20,479
WHAT HE SAYING, SHORT OF

263
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,448
ADVOCATING VIOLENCE FOR AN

264
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:23,148
OVERTHROW, OR SOMETHING.

265
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,216
I MEAN IT'S LIKE, WHAT WOULD YOU

266
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:28,454
HAVE TO SAY THAT IS BEYOND THAT?

267
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:30,055
THAT'S THE LIMIT.

268
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:32,658
SO I THINK -- I THINK YOU COULD

269
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,827
INTERPRET IT AND SAY IT'S LIKE,

270
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,462
TWO LEVERS TRYING TO IMPRESS

271
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,429
EACH OTHER, TO HEROES IN THEIR

272
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,366
OWN LOVE STORY, BUT WHEN YOU

273
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,769
LOOK AT THAT, MAN, IT ISN'T

274
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:44,303
PRETTY.

275
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:46,071
>> AND LET'S REMEMBER WHO HE

276
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,139
WAS, HE WAS THE LEAD

277
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,275
INVESTIGATOR FOR THE CLINTON

278
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:50,676
EMAIL PROBE.

279
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,244
HE INTERVIEWED ALL OF HILLARY'S

280
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,712
PEOPLE AND HE TRAVELED TO

281
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:56,882
ENGLAND TO TALK TO THE QUOTE

282
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:57,282
UNQUOTE SPY.

283
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:59,284
HE WAS THE ONE THAT OFFICIALLY

284
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:00,052
OPENED UP THE

285
00:09:00,052 --> 00:09:00,586
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

286
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:01,320
INVESTIGATION INTO DONALD TRUMP

287
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,355
AND HE WAS THE ONE THAT

288
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:05,858
INTERVIEWED MIKE FLYNN.

289
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:10,863
HE WAS HANDPICKED TO GO ON TO

290
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:12,297
MUELLER'S TEAM.

291
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:13,332
THE KEY PLAYER IN BOTH

292
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,366
INVESTIGATIONS AND HE'S OUT

293
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:15,668
THERE TALKING ABOUT, WE NEED TO

294
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,670
STOP HIM FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT

295
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,305
AND IT NOW THAT HE IS PRESIDENT

296
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:21,507
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

297
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:21,874
IT.

298
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:24,243
>> AND THAT'S WHY TREY GOWDY

299
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:25,110
SAID THIS MOLAR PROBE IS

300
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,678
TAINTED.

301
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,080
NO MATTER WHAT COMES OUT OF IT,

302
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,282
SHOULD WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY?

303
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:33,052
BECAUSE AS HE SAID, PETER STRZOK

304
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,119
WAS ONE OF THE TOP PEOPLE

305
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,721
ORIGINALLY ON THAT INVESTIGATION

306
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,322
AND YOU HEARD RUDY GIULIANI THIS

307
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:38,991
MORNING, HE SAID WE ARE NOT

308
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:40,492
GOING TO COOPERATE ANYMORE.

309
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,428
WHO KNOWS HOW THIS ENDS, IT MAY

310
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:44,830
END UP GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE

311
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,731
SUPREME COURT BUT YOU CAN'T

312
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,800
ARGUE THAT THE EARLY DAYS OF

313
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,203
THIS INVESTIGATION CERTAINLY

314
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:51,670
WERE TAINTED.

315
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,772
>> I THINK THE TEXT MESSAGES ARE

316
00:09:53,772 --> 00:09:56,075
AWFUL AND THEY GIVE THE

317
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:56,608
APPEARANCE OF BIAS.

318
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,143
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ALSO SAID

319
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:01,013
THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE

320
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:04,083
THAT IMPACTED THE INVESTIGATION.

321
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,851
>> THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

322
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:07,352
>> THEY ALSO SAID THAT PETER

323
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,887
STRZOK AT TIMES ADVOCATED FOR

324
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:09,922
TOUGHER ACTION AGAINST THE

325
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,990
CLINTON PEOPLE INCLUDING THE USE

326
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,192
OF SUBPOENAS THAN OTHER PEOPLE

327
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,694
ON THE TEAM AND THAT HE WAS NOT

328
00:10:15,694 --> 00:10:17,196
THE SOLE DECISION-MAKER ON

329
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:18,497
ANYTHING RELATED TO THE

330
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:19,331
INVESTIGATION.

331
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:22,301
SO I AGREE, THESE TEXTS GIVE A

332
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:23,035
VERY BAD APPEARANCE OF POLITICAL

333
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:23,802
BIAS AND IT WAS STUPID AND THEY

334
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:26,271
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT WE

335
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:29,141
HAVE TO ALSO FOLLOW WHAT THE IG

336
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:29,541
SAID.

337
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,744
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE IG WHERE

338
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:34,880
THEY SAY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

339
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,181
THAT IMPACTED INVESTIGATIVE

340
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:41,687
DECISIONS AND IN FACT, STRZOK

341
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:45,791
ARGUED FOR TOUGHER TREATMENT.

342
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,293
>> WHEN HE WROTE THE EXONERATION

343
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,463
LETTER, RECKLESS OR NOT, HE WAS

344
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:52,297
THE ONE THAT DOWNGRADED AND

345
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:52,698
CARELESS.

346
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:53,866
THE OTHER THING HE DID WHEN THEY

347
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,101
GOT THEIR HANDS ON THE

348
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:56,802
ANTHONY WEINER EMAILS, HE WAS

349
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,103
THE ONE THAT SAT ON THEM FOR A

350
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:59,271
MONTH AND THEY DIDN'T FUNNEL

351
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:02,207
THEIR WAY UP TO MUELLER UNTIL

352
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:03,275
RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION.

353
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:06,745
>> BUT THAT HURT HELLO RAY.

354
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:09,481
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT

355
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:12,284
HELPS OR HURTS, THOUGH.

356
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:13,285
IF YOU ARE CHOOSING POLITICAL

357
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:17,289
BIAS IN FAVOR OF HILLARY -- >>

358
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:19,057
IT'S IN WRITING, WE DON'T NEED

359
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:19,491
TO SPECULATE.

360
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,460
IT'S THERE FROM BEGINNING TO END

361
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,828
THAT THEY HAD A SPECIFIC

362
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:23,529
INTENDED PURPOSE OF WHAT THEY

363
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,330
WANTED THE OUTCOME TO BE WHICH

364
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,466
DOES TAINT THE INVESTIGATION

365
00:11:27,466 --> 00:00:00,000
MUELLER IS DOING BECAUSE THE KEY
