ROB: NEWLY FREED AMERICAN
HOSTAGES BACK IN THE UNITED
STATES AFTER MONTHS OF
IMPRISONMENT IN NORTH KOREA.
ARRIVING AT WALTER REED MEDICAL
CENTER AFTER A WARM WELCOME HOME
FROM DONALD TRUMP AND THE FIRST
LADY.
JILLIAN: THE AUTHOR OF NUCLEAR
SHOWDOWN GORDON CHANG.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE WERE
WATCHING THIS AT 3 AM.
>> GREAT DAY WHEN AMERICANS ARE
FREED FROM TIERNEY AND THAT
HAPPENED TODAY AND THEY WERE
ABLE TO WALK ON THE PLANE UNLIKE
OTTO WARMBIER WHO CAME BACK IN A
VEGETATIVE STATE SO THIS IS A
JOYOUS MOMENT AND A GOOD SIGN
FOR NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS BUT
LET'S SAY FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE
THIS WAS A TERRIFIC DAY.
ROB: YOU MENTIONED THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTTO WARMBIER
AND THESE THREE AND THAT SHOWS A
CHANGE IN THEIR AGENDA, THAT
THEY ARE HAPPY AND HEALTHY AND
COMING HOME.
>> THE NORTH KOREANS WANTED TO
CREATE A GOOD ATMOSPHERE SO THEY
WERE IN GOOD CONDITION.
WITH NORTH KOREA THERE ARE VERY
WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SAY
WITH WE WANT TO HAVE GOOD
RELATIONS WITH THE US.
WE ARE ENTERING THESE
NEGOTIATIONS, LET'S BE FRIENDS.
JILLIAN: A LOT HAS CHANGED OVER
THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR.
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS
COMING SUMMIT?
>> WE INSIST ON NORTH KOREANS
GIVING UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
BALLISTIC MISSILES.
>> DO YOU THINK THEY WILL?
>> IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER
DONALD TRUMP IS WILLING TO USE
ALL THE ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN
POWER TO FORCE THE NORTH KOREANS
TO DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT
TO DO AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD
NEVER DO.
IT IS A TRUMP QUESTION, NOT A
KIM QUESTION.
WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF WE CAN DO
NOT ONLY TO THE NORTH KOREANS
BUT MAJOR POWER BACKERS,
RUSSIANS AND CHINESE.
ROB: LOOKING AT THE WORLD FROM
WESTERN PERSPECTIVE, YOU SEE HOW
WELL WE ARE ABLE TO LIVE AND HOW
THEY LIVE IN NORTH KOREA, YOU
WOULD THINK THE IDEA OF OPENING
THE COUNTRY AND PLAYING TO BUY
INTERNATIONAL RULES WOULD
BENEFIT EVERYBODY, WHAT DO THEY
FIND SO THREATENING?
>> IT WOULD BENEFIT THE NORTH
KOREAN PEOPLE BUT KIM,
>> IT WOULD BENEFIT THE NORTH
KOREAN PEOPLE BUT KIM, AN
INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED POSITION,
WHEN PEOPLE ARE POOR, THEY DON'T
HAVE THE MEANS TO RESIST AND
THAT IS WHY THIS REGIME EVEN
THOUGH IT IS COMPLETELY
DESTITUTE AND HAS BEEN THAT WAY
FOR MANY DECADES HE IS ABLE TO
SURVIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK
FORWARD.
JILLIAN: WE EXPECT TO LEARN
INFORMATION FROM THE THREE
AMERICANS BEING CHECKED OUT
MEDICALLY.
AT SOME POINT WE WILL HEAR
THINGS.
WHAT ARE WE LEARNING FROM THEM.
>> AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO OTTO
WARMBIER, I DON'T THINK THEY
WILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN KEPT
IN SILOS SO NOT SURE THEY KNOW
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO OTHER
DETAINEES BUT ANY BIT OF
INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT
GOES ON IN NORTH KOREA.
IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT AND COULD BE
CONSEQUENTIAL IN CONNECTION WITH
OTHER THINGS.
>> ANOTHER ONE WE TALKED ABOUT
LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE.
>> HE DISAPPEARED UNDER
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE REALLY
SUSPICIOUS AND THESE ARE
INDICATIONS HE IS IN NORTH KOREA
THAT MAKES SENSE FROM A NUMBER
OF PERSPECTIVES.
CHINESE POLICE REPORTED THIS IS
FABRICATED FROM ALL WE KNOW.
I THINK THE NORTH KOREANS SHOULD
SAY WE HAVE A MORE WE DON'T.
