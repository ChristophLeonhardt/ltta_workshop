1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,859
A decade ago, robots still seemed pretty limited.

2
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:09,990
Now, not so much.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,450
And computers don’t just win chess any more,
they can win Jeopardy.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,450
“Watson.”

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,580
“What is the of the Elegance of the Hedgehog?”

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,580
They can win Go.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,430
“There are about 200 possible moves for
the average position in Go.”

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,810
This is all happening really fast.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,910
And it’s causing some to forecast a future
where humans can’t find work.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,160
“There will be fewer and fewer jobs that
a robot cannot do better.”

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,829
“And what are the people gonna do?”

12
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,550
“That’s the $64,000 question.”

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,800
I believe this is going to be one of the biggest
challenges we face in the coming decades.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,699
“People who are not just unemployed.

15
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:42,539
They are unemployable.”

16
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,059
But if you ask economists, they tend to have
a pretty different view from the futurists

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,800
and Silicon Valley types.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,059
Do you worry that new technologies could cause
mass unemployment?

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,560
Yes. No.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,299
I have devoted my career to worrying about
the labor market, particularly worrying about

21
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,020
the living standards of low and moderate income
workers.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,670
So I worry a lot about things.

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,940
I am not worried about this.

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,940
One of the reasons a lot of economists are
skeptical about robots taking all the jobs

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,610
is that we’ve heard that before.

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,799
There was a spike of automation anxiety in
the late 20s, early 1930s when machines

27
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,520
were starting to take over jobs on farms and
also in factories.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,390
This article from 1928 points out that there
used to be guards who opened and closed the

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,070
doors on new york subway trains, and people
who took tickets before there were turnstiles.

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,649
And I just love this quote: It says “building
materials are mixed like dough in a machine

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,130
and literally poured into place without the
touch of a human hand.”

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,799
Automation anxiety surged again in the late
1950s, early 1960s.

33
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,409
President Kennedy ranks automation first as
job challenge.

34
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,929
“Computers and automation threaten to create
vast unemployment and social unrest”

35
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:07,400
“What should I do Mr. Whipple?”

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,820
“Stop him!”

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,260
This article from 1958 is about 17,000 longshoremen
who were protesting automation on the piers.

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,340
And if you don't know what longshoremen are,
that’s because there aren’t many of them left.

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,020
Technology destroyed a lot of those jobs.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,260
And yet, we didn’t run out of work.

41
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,290
This chart shows the percentage of prime-age
people with jobs in the US.

42
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,100
Ever since women joined the workforce in big
numbers, it’s stayed around 80%, outside

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,230
of recessions.

44
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,159
During this period, technology displaced some
8 million farmers in the US, 7 million factory

45
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,690
workers, over a million railroad workers,
hundreds of thousands of telephone  operators,

46
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,960
we’ve lost gas-pumpers, elevator attendants,
travel agents.

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,420
Tons of jobs have died but work persists.

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,670
What you realize when you look through those
old reports is that it’s really easy for

49
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,670
us to see the jobs being replaced by machines.

50
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,939
It’s a bit harder to visualize the jobs
that come from what happens next.

51
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,379
New technology creates jobs in a few ways.

52
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,330
There are the direct jobs for people who design
and maintain the technology, and sometimes

53
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,590
whole new industries built on the technology.

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,689
But the part we tend to forget is the indirect
effect of labor-saving inventions.

55
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,439
When companies can do more with less, they
can expand, maybe add new products or open

56
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,370
new locations, and they can lower prices to
compete.

57
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,760
And that means consumers can buy more of their
product, or if we don’t want any more of

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,930
it, we can use the savings to buy other things.

59
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,829
Maybe we go to more sports events or out to
dinner more often.

60
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,019
Maybe we get more haircuts or add more day-care
for the kids.

61
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,470
This process is how our standard of living
has improved over time and it’s always required

62
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,470
workers.

63
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,299
The key economic logic here is automation
does indeed displace workers who are doing

64
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:05,689
work that got automated, but it doesn't actually
affect the total number of jobs in the economy

65
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,489
because of these offsetting effects.

66
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,370
Warnings about the “end of work” tend
to focus on this part and not all of this

67
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,930
-- like a widely cited study from 2013,
“According to research conducted by Oxford

68
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,389
University, nearly half of all current jobs
in America --” “47 percent of all our

69
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,509
jobs--” “47 percent of US jobs in the
next decade or two, according to researchers

70
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,580
at Oxford, will be replaced by robots.”

71
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,710
That study assessed the capabilities of automation
technology.

72
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,080
It didn’t attempt to estimate the actual
“extent or pace” of automation or the

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,890
overall effect on employment.

74
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,220
Now, all this doesn’t mean that the new
jobs will show up right away or that they’ll

75
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,300
be located in the same place or pay the same
wage as the ones that were lost.

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,020
All it means is that the overall need for
human work hasn’t gone away.

77
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,030
Technologists and futurists don’t deny that’s
been true historically, but they question

78
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,000
whether history is a good guide of what’s
to come.

79
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,280
Fundamentally the argument is that this time
it’s different.

80
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,660
That’s what I think.

81
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,430
Imagine a form of electricity that could automate
all the routine work.

82
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,220
I mean, that’s basically what we are talking
about here.

83
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,780
And so It’s going to be across the board.

84
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,370
And it is easy to underestimate technology
these days.

85
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,060
In a 2004 book, two economists  assessed
the future of automation and concluded that

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,020
tasks like driving in traffic would be “enormously
difficult” to teach to a computer.

87
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,250
That same year, a review of 50 years of research
concluded that “human level speech recognition

88
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,900
has proved to be an elusive goal.”

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And now?

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,380
“Ok Google.

91
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,160
How many miles has google’s autonomous vehicle
driven?”

92
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,000
“According to Recode, that’s because the
company announced its self-driving car project,

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,360
which was created in 2009, has racked up over
two million miles of driving experience.”

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,190
This is the textbook chart of advancement
in computer hardware — it’s the number

95
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,330
of transistors that engineers have squeezed
onto a computer chip over time.

96
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,349
Already pretty impressive, but notice that
this isn’t a typical scale: these numbers

97
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,990
are increasing exponentially.

98
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,610
On a typical linear scale it would look more
like this.

99
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,800
It really is hard to imagine this not being
massively disruptive.

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,440
And as the authors of The Second Machine Age
point out, processors aren’t the only dimension

101
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,330
of computing that has seen exponential improvement.

102
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,569
The idea of acceleration in your daily life

103
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:26,569
when do you encounter that?

104
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,810
Maybe in a car for a few seconds?

105
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,110
In an airplane for seconds again?

106
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,610
The idea that something can accelerate for
decades literally just continuously is just

107
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,639
not something that we deal with.

108
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,270
I mean, we think in straight lines.

109
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,470
But even though there’s been all this innovation,
it’s not showing up in the data.

110
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,710
If we were seeing this big increase in automation
we would see productivity growing much more

111
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,650
rapidly now than it usually does, and we are
instead seeing the opposite.

112
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,949
Labor productivity is a measure of the goods
and services we produce divided by the hours

113
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,250
that we work.

114
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,940
Over time it goes up - we do more with less
labor.

115
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,970
We’re more efficient.

116
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,100
If we were starting to see a ton of labor-saving
innovation you’d expect this line to get

117
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,210
steeper, but when you look at productivity
growth, you can see that it has been slowing

118
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,210
down since the early 2000s, and not just for
the US.

119
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,560
It’s possible that new technologies are
changing our lives without fundamentally changing

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
the economy.

121
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,220
So will this all change?

122
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,800
Will today’s robots and AI cause mass unemployment?

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
There’s reason to be skeptical, but nobody
really knows.

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,000
But one thing we do know is that the wealth
that technology creates, it isn’t necessarily

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,370
shared with workers.

126
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,580
When you account for inflation, the income
of most families has stayed pretty flat as

127
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,800
the economy has grown.

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,629
One of the problems we've seen over the last
40 years is that we have seen all of this

129
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:55,370
rising productivity growth but actually hasn't
been broadly shared, it's been captured by

130
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,289
a thin slice of people at the top of the income
distribution.

131
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,240
Even if unemployment stays low, automation
might worsen economic inequality, which is

132
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,289
already more extreme in the US than it is
in most other advanced countries.

133
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,090
But technology isn’t destiny.

134
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,599
Governments decide how a society weathers
disruptions, and that worries people on both

135
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,560
sides of the debate about the future of work.

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:26,481
We’ve adopted policies that instead of really
trying to counteract the trend caused by technology

137
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:30,849
and globalization and other things, we’ve
in many cases exacerbated them.

138
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,870
We’ve put a wind in the back of them and
made them more extreme.

139
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,000
And that’s a big problem.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,730
We will probably always be fascinated by the
prospect of robots taking our jobs.

141
00:08:40,730 --> 00:00:00,000
But if we  focus on things we can’t really
control, we risk neglecting the things we can.
