1
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:14,250
They told me that they had to go on a trip to Damascus.

2
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:21,250
I was not aware that they were planning this protest

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,292
in the city’s main souk.

4
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,334
That evening,

5
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:33,209
they said that the “Brides of Peace”

6
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,334
staged a protest.

7
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,083
They showed their pictures, 

8
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,542
they even said their names.

9
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:42,876
I couldn’t stop thinking, 

10
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,334
“What will happen to them?”

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,792


12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,751


13
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,626
Ever since I can remember, my dad used to talk about

14
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:07,959
how Syria’s situation should not be like this,

15
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,042
about the corruption of the Assads, about their crimes.

16
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:13,084
We knew that there was something wrong.

17
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:17,459
But just like everyone else, we adapted ourselves to the situation.

18
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:18,042
But when the Arab Spring started

19
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:24,584
with the revolution in Tunisia,

20
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,959
we knew that the wheel would turn

21
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,917
and the revolution would reach us.

22
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,167
We were hoping for a revolution,

23
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:38,167
but not really expecting it.

24
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:43,042
The situation was very difficult. People were extremely oppressed. 

25
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,542
But it was a great feeling, 

26
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,626
an unusual feeling, 

27
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:52,500
to see the revolution starting in Syria.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,667
I participated in peaceful protests because

29
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:05,000
I believed that they could change the authoritarian regime.

30
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,667
Unfortunately, the situation started to deteriorate

31
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,626
and people started taking up arms.

32
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:13,250
Men were starting to reject peaceful actions, 

33
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,792
thinking that with this regime, pacifism would not achieve anything. 

34
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:20,459
We wanted to prove that it was still possible. 

35
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,250
We met a group of women, including Rima Dali and Roa Jaffar.

36
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,042
We sat together one evening and began to brainstorm.

37
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,334
Someone suggested wearing something distinctive, 

38
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,000
something that symbolizes peace. 

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,667
This is how we came up with the idea of wedding dresses.

40
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,834
I remember that day very well.

41
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,667
We tried on the dresses.

42
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,500
We had prepared black abayas

43
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:49,042
to wear on the way, over the wedding dresses.

44
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,083
Even this was a symbol, 

45
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:56,083
throwing off the black covering and appearing in white

46
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:01,709
to say that we wanted peace for Syria.

47
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,917
So Rima nodded, we took off the abayas...

48
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:11,042
“FOR THE SAKE OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, CIVIL SOCIETY DECLARES:

49
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:11,042
STOP ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SYRIA. 100% SYRIAN.”

50
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,000
People were stunned.

51
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,626
We started walking. 

52
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:25,626
And as we walked, people were walking ahead of us, facing us

53
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,334
but in silence. 

54
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,000
I felt as if we were flying.

55
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,167
I don’t know where I got the courage

56
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,000
to talk out loud and say,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,709
“Cheer, cheer for the Brides of Syria!”

58
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:43,542
And I made the sound we make at weddings.

59
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,959
Suddenly everyone started making the sound! 

60
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:56,500
I remember the face of one particular person, an old man.

61
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:01,209
I looked at him, and all I could see were tears running down his face.

62
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,709
He came close to us and said, “May God protect you, go on! Go on!” 

63
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:11,250
We thought we would not even have time to unfold the sign, 

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,167
but we were there for a while, around 15 minutes.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
We marched and blocked off the road.

66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:24,751
Then security forces arrived and arrested us.

67
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,709
I’m not sure what was going on with us. At this moment, with security forces before us,

68
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,917
we didn’t care about anything. We weren’t afraid of anything.

69
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,959
We were standing there, filled with joy, eager to convey our message. 

70
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,125
We thought they would interrogate us for a while and let us go.

71
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,209
We didn’t expect to be arrested.

72
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,292
They got us into a military jeep.

73
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:52,209
It was a strange scene; brides in police cars. 

74
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,584
They led us up to a building. 

75
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:59,375
Here, the real horror started.

76
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:04,083
Groups of young men here and there, all blindfolded.

77
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,059
The sound of beating,

78
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,209
the smell of blood was everywhere. 

79
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,334
When I first heard the news, 

80
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:16,167
I had this feeling as a father,

81
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,751
it was something great for me.

82
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,626
It meant that they had beliefs. 

83
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,334
Of course I also felt sad because 

84
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,751
I know the brutality of the regime.

85
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,083
One of the interrogators had an electric cable. 

86
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,917
He beat me with it.

87
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,125
Lubna heard me screaming 

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,459
and she collapsed.

89
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,584
I was so afraid that something would happen to her there.

90
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:41,042
It was a horrible moment.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,375
The good moments were when someone was released.

92
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:50,292
We’d spend the days talking, crying or singing. 

93
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:54,584
 Mother, the song of love is my song

94
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,083
These were special moments.

95
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,500
I wish that there was a camera to film those small things we did.

96
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,375
Eight days after the New Year, 

97
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:14,876
they said each one whose name is called should go stand in the hallway.

98
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,167
Our four names were called

99
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,334
and we went out. 

100
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:21,626
The next day, after two months in detention,

101
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,167
we were released. 

102
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,292
After we were released, we were even more determined.

103
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:34,500
Unfortunately, by that time, the peaceful movement was fading.

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,876
The voice of gunfire was rising higher.

105
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:42,626
And it became very dangerous to call for a peaceful activity.

106
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:45,959
Most of the residents of Sweida, our town,

107
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,917
80 percent of them, are pro-regime Syrians.

108
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,167
The landlord evicted us from our home

109
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:58,042
and they closed our father’s restaurant.

110
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,042
We no longer had any means to live.

111
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,292
The circumstances imposed on our family 

112
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:10,417
by our own Druse community from one side

113
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:15,334
and the regime from the other...

114
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,751
It became too much for us to handle

115
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:21,292
and we decided to leave Syria.

116
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:28,042
I met my husband, my love, through the revolution.

117
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:39,459
We got engaged on the boat to Turkey.

118
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,459
No one was ready for a wedding.

119
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:48,792
My husband, Asaad, and I celebrated alone.

120
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,667
My husband’s name is Ali Jilani, 

121
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,917
he’s from northern Syria — Kobani.

122
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:03,000
Of course, he knew that I was from Sweida, and Druse.

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,375
And I knew he was Kurdish, Sunni.

124
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:13,167
My immediate family had no problem with the issue. 

125
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:15,917
The problem was with the extended family. 

126
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,250
They said they disowned us. 

127
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,876
We even recieved death threats.

128
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:24,042
I used to imagine that I would have a big, beautiful wedding 

129
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,042
just like those on television.

130
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:35,125
Instead, I wore jeans and a T-shirt.

131
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:38,626
I’m a bride of freedom, a bride of peace. 

132
00:08:40,208 --> 00:00:00,000
This is even more important than celebrating my own wedding.
