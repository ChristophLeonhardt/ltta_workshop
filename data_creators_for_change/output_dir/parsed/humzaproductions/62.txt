boss might have a bit of a problem with
you being here he's a bit of a dick I
heard that he's the best boss ever
considering your last day he's a DJ King

Chinese guy on all the screen savers in
the library yeah I remember that
anyway have you had some humza recently
nah not spoken to him since this still
up two years ago it's just I've been
calling him and he's not been answering
and I've spoken to a couple of people
and no one seems to know where he is so
I'm a little bit worried but trust me
he's all right
most probably in a sushi place bourbon
on some Asian girls and sharing one gray
perm in between seven man's trust me and
I know I just have a bad feeling about
it aren't you concerned look just stop

not work time is it it's a tiny time
without fun oh yeah I'm sorry but she

up before you get back it's obvious I've
outstayed my welcome gives you more time
with your new BAE
oh by the way I'm onion stood in Windows
95 3.0 it's cheaper
my daughter is ignoring me
and it's all your fault for having a
daughter I am NOT talking to you
okay technically you are talking to me
you spastic but what is amiss your son's
stupid butt kicked at Chucky one oh god
I need some food something simple like
nobody listen uneducated pendo I am NOT
your slave go for Ciaran dinner tonight
okay but why do people say I am good at
nothing only better looking and I'll use
one less ingredients one thing that you
always use in your cooking food
poisoning well clearly I don't use
enough because you're still here if you
want better food go get another wife
whoa what are you talking about just be
stupid now obese or ridiculous why would
I do that to wise means to birthday yes
oh yeah we're not a planet modest I am
leaving you I'm leaving this house I'm
going to go stay with my mother okay
look look look
shut up I can't make you do this your
mother I have seen her without from the
table she looking like a Donald Trump
she stares shit out of me I don't want
to do this to you I am done with you you
are impossible if you don't fix
everything between you and your daughter
and your son I will never forgive you
and I will never go back
so another holiday have you ever run
away from something I have remember I
packed the essentials and then went to
Malaysia and then my dad forced my
friends to go get me back but from
Dexter cause he's technically not my
friend
so then Galia and Asif went to Malaysia
finally caught up with me and after a
few mishaps involving a snake in my
willy they finally took me home but
before they came I was so scared at
first I was alone but after a while for
some reason I was okay
you see we stopped being lonely when we
become okay with being alone but then
again people are lonely because they
build walls instead of bridges we were
born alone we live alone we die alone
only through our friendships can we
create the illusion for the moment that
we're not alone is that a negative way
to think
I guess I just needed a lucky break to
live us you never know I managed to find
a place lately
so I've been trying to look for honza
but no one occurred or theme premiere
needed this has been missing I haven't
been able to eat or sleep properly I
just
don't know iseman doesn't count
well I think my worries I've spoken to
players
I'm not one of them
faier said that he doesn't want to be
associated becomes anymore
he always gets in trouble for us as a
professional dentist and can't hang
around people like that Auster for the
next day got jumped by summer PJ's blaze
they beat him bad to the point that he
was too shocked to even go out so he
stayed away to debts his mom found out
and told him he can't see homes anymore
as he's a bad influence on him
Dexter really wanted to visit Hamza but
his parents wasn't happy we all had our
reasons why no one came to see Hamza a
decision I know we all regret I guess
friendship can be really complicated
but
a real friend does make mistake but
doesn't try to rectify that mistake
would never a true friend to start with
I'd really need Viktor I know I miss him
so much he is my best friend well he was
why
I just don't talk back
you
I guess what I realized was every test
in my life can either make me better or
better every problem can break us or
make us but it's our choice and
sometimes we need to remind ourselves
that maybe God has sent everyone away so
it's only you and him because at the end
of the day only God can help me
enlighten what's darkened me strengthen
what's weakened me mend what's broken in
me bind what's bruised in me heal what
sicken me and lastly revive whatever
peace and love has died in me
oh let's see funny how convenient
yes funny Rajee finished so i can we
talk
I take that as a silent yet enthusiastic
yes namaste
so how school and college shit what do
you wanna talk about
oh cool stop you know this hippity hop
stop as you kids always say no one says
that
hop you know before I was listening -
where to - Jay said and for a white guy
he's pretty cool
yes do you mean jay-z hmm yes yeah
that's the lobster and and I was
listening to six-packs
Tupac ah that's the ones different
numbers and also a Gris of black Miss
Brown know he's black and the new guy
who's the new guy what's his name you
know he's just coming to the scene then
you got ah Michael Jackson he diet in
using what shut oh my god what's it the
monkey it's a monkey I just don't trust
it how can something look so friendly
yeah the sequel at the same time dad
what do you want why are you here
ah yes Oh mmm okay what
you know Betty when I was young like you
I also had the best friend his name was
father yes he was my next-door neighbor
we grew up together but after 15 years
he came up to me and he told me that her
spirits they are buying a new house and
they are moving Hey
then kind of knew everything would
change it's not broken I had no idea how
I would spend the rest of my life and
without fahad by my side I was angry at
him I was angry at his parents I was
angry at everyone and then one day my
father he saw me on the farm sitting
alone so he came in sat next to me and
he said this thing that I'll always
remember he said better life is not
consistent you know life is like the
weather keeps changing and friends
unfortunately sometimes friends they
come and they go but the most important
thing is family and my father he was a
very straightforward guy you know he was
a manly man he found it very hard to
show his emotions like me but he did
something that I would never forget
try to hug maybe tell you something me
I've never heard but on that day he
tried but I was so angry I pushed anyway
screamed at him shouted at him and I
rang I just rang I went to my cousin's
house and I stayed there for the night
and thinking about it
eventually I realized I was wrong
my father was right the most important
thing in life my plan my plan was to
wake up in the morning see my father
apologize and finally finally get that
long over to work what happens did you
hug him
my father the night before had a heart
attack he passed away I never got to
give him the talk
you
I remember the day before my friends
arrived I was still alone but I realized
that sometimes you have to be your own
hero sometimes we have to look for
something positive in each day even if
some days you have to look a little
harder sometimes is about striving for
progress and not perfection
and even though I've seen a few
disturbing things
I was now a man as I've learned from a
painful yesterday live for the gift of
today and hope for a better tomorrow and
even though as I've said I've seen a few
disturbing things I was finally better
our eyes are in front because it's more
important to look ahead than to look
back don't dwell on things in the past
learn from them and keep moving forward
