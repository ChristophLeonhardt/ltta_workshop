Amazon has revealed
the 20 locations

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,170
in the running for
its next headquarters.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,040
238 bids came in from across
North America

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,130
in hopes that “HQ2” could create jobs
and boost their local economy.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,550
The fight to be Amazon’s
next home was fierce

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,960
and some places made
very impassioned pitches.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,950
“Alexa, where is the most
interesting company in the world

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,740
going to locate?”

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,920
“Obviously, Washington, D.C.”

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,550
A city in Georgia offered
to change its name.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,520
“Greetings, Amazon
and Mr. Jeff Bezos.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,230
Welcome to Amazon, Georgia.”

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,300
New York City lit up the
Empire State Building

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,600
in orange lights.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,650
Calgary, Alberta, said
they would fight a bear

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,520
for the headquarters.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,360
And Tucson, Arizona, sent a 20-foot cactus
to Seattle on a flatbed truck.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,400
Many cities, including
Newark, Chicago and Los Angeles,

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,640
offered tax-related perks.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,040
Others vowed to invest
in public transportation

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,500
to reduce traffic.

00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,340
Amazon promises to bring as
many as 50,000 high-paying jobs

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,071
to the winning city over
the next 10 to 15 years.

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,700
The company said 
they’ll announce

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:00:00,000
their decision later this year.
