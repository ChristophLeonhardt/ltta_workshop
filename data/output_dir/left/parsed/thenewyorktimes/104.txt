Lassie would certainly free
this suffering dog owner
from her little cubicle.
But what about Ralph, the pug?
He’s one of 34 dogs that
faced a similar test of empathy.
“Help!”
Kiki was another.
And there was KOOZA!
“Help!”
Each dog had to solve
the same problem:
What to do about an
owner apparently trapped
behind an easily opened door?
The dogs reacted in
all sorts of ways.
Some became anxious and
circled the room, repeatedly.
Others headed to a door
at the back of the room
where the researchers
were, perhaps
hoping for some human help.
Others just stared.
Some dog owners cried,
indicating distress.
“Help!”
While others hummed
“Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,”
and said “help” in a
tone that carried no emotion.
“Help.”
Some of the dogs,
like poor Kiki,
were so anxious that that
may have even interfered
with their ability to act.
She was one of the dogs that
didn’t complete the test,
as was the case
with several others.
Overall, more than half
the dogs opened the door.
Surprisingly, the dogs
with crying owners
didn’t do any better than
the ones with calm owners.
But speed told a
different story.
The dogs with crying
owners opened the door
three times as fast.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!”
“Hello, my KOOZA!
Yay!
All right.”
But what happened
to Ralph, the pug?
Was it all too much for him?
Of course not.
Never underestimate a pug.
