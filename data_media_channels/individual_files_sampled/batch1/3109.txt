I had planned on monitor trusted and although it would have been a very difficult primary I think I could have one I don't know maybe not I thought I could have one and I had a lot of data and I was fairly confident that if I were the democratic party's nominee I had the better need a chance to be president when I said I would make a decision by the fall following fall one year before the general election everybody's announced well before that the press began to think i was playing a game but I couldn't tell them about my boy he didn't want anybody feeling sorry for you if he wanted me to run but people who were close to say well I didn't run because it wasn't good for the family I have to be honest with you I didn't run because no man a woman should announce for president nited states unless they can look the public in the eye and say I promise you giving one hundred percent my attention is dedication to this effort I knew I couldn't do that but I couldn't do it because he kept saying don't announce you're not running because my son Hunter my daughter Ashley my wife all thought I should I didn't but at the end of the day I just couldn't do it so I don't regret not running in the sense that it was the right decision for my boy for me for my family at a time but do I regret not being president yes and I know that sounds I know what it sounds like but no man or woman announcements for president on his face unless they honestly believe from their experience they're the best qualified person to do that and at the time I thought that the circumstances are such that I was the best qualified not every year would you be the best qualified but the things that I've spent my whole life doing American foreign policy I the ability to bring people together the respect of both sides of the aisle I thought there was a need to bring the country together and I thought I could have done it but you know is my mother would say everything happens for a reason and some being as honest as I can possibly mean try agreed not being president yes there get not running for president light of what was going on in my life at the time no I don't regret I made the right decision
