1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:01,911
TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA.

2
00:00:01,912 --> 00:00:02,978
GRIFF.

3
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:05,080
>> JOHN, IT'S THE SOUND OF

4
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,149
CHAIN SAUCE AND BULLDOZERS HERE

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,616
IN TALLAHASSEE.

6
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:11,120
THIS IS JUST ONE OF DOZENS OF

7
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,488
STREETS WITH THIS TREE CLEARING

8
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:12,988
GOING ON.

9
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:14,824
LOOK AT THIS.

10
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:15,991
SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE TASK AT

11
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:16,292
HAND.

12
00:00:16,293 --> 00:00:19,228
YOU HAVE IN THIS CASE THIS

13
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:20,529
BULLDOZER TRYING TO GET THIS

14
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,564
TREE THAT'S CRASHED ONE OF

15
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,799
SEVERAL ON THE STREET OUT OF

16
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,767
THE POWER LINES.

17
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:27,536
QUITE A MESS, QUITE A TASK.

18
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:29,605
THEY'RE VERY LUCKY.

19
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:30,272
THE SUSTAINED WINDS ONLY 75

20
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:31,807
MILES AN HOUR HERE.

21
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:33,108
MORE THAN DOUBLE DOWN ON THE

22
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:33,409
COAST.

23
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,977
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

24
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:37,079
VIDEO THAT WAS SHOT IT'S REALLY

25
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,247
UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE THEY

26
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:39,448
AREN'T DOING RECOVERY DOWN

27
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:42,318
THERE, THEY'RE DOING SEARCH AND

28
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:42,985
RESCUE.

29
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:43,919
THE GOVERNOR TOURING MEXICO

30
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,455
BEACH IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE IN

31
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:46,922
THIS HOUR.

32
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:49,291
BUT THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF

33
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,659
RESCUES AND EVACUATIONS EVEN OF

34
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,761
PEOPLE THAT DECIDED TO STAY

35
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,095
BEHIND.

36
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,331
OFFICIALS SAY THAT AS MANY AS

37
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:57,433
250 MAY HAVE STAYED BEHIND IN

38
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:58,767
MEXICO BEACH ALONE.

39
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:02,071
THAT'S A TOUGH TASK AS THE DAY

40
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:05,140
GETS GOING HERE, JON.

41
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:09,111
>> Jon: YOU WERE ABLE TO GET UP

42
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,279
IN THE AIR OVER MEXICO BEACH.

43
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,914
TELL US WHAT THAT WAS LIKE.

44
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,315
>> I GREW UP GOING AND PLAYING

45
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,651
AS A KID IN THE SANDS OF THE

46
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:18,420
PANHANDLE AND TO FLY OVER AND

47
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,756
SEE THIS FOOTAGE THAT WE SHOT

48
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,825
IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE

49
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:24,660
ENTIRE HOMES RIPPED OFF THEIR

50
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,429
FOUNDATIONS AND CAST ABOUT LIKE

51
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,664
A TOY HOUSE.

52
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:29,965
THE STREETS ABSOLUTELY

53
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:30,332
DESTROYED.

54
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,769
THE COMBINATION OF THE STORM

55
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,005
SURGE AND THE 155 MILE-AN-HOUR

56
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:36,872
UNPRECEDENTED CAT 4 WINDS

57
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:38,340
LEVELED THAT ENTIRE PLACE.

58
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,209
WHEN PEOPLE SAY IT LOOKS LIKE A

59
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:40,676
BOMB WENT OFF.

60
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,012
WHEN PEOPLE SAY IT WAS TOTALLY

61
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:45,214
DEVASTATED, IT IS REALLY NOT AN

62
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:45,814
OVERSTATEMENT.

63
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:46,649
IT IS CRAZY.

64
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,449
I ASKED THE PILOT.

65
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,388
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SOUND BITE.

66
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:53,989
THE PILOT, BRANDEN, FLYING FOR

67
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,256
US.

68
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:55,891
I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS IT LIKE,

69
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:58,661
HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

70
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,129
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH GREAT

71
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,398
DAMAGE FROM A HURRICANE IN A

72
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,299
COASTAL AREA.

73
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,334
I'M GLAD I WASN'T THERE WHEN

74
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,302
THAT STORM CAME THROUGH.

75
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:09,338
I HOPE EVERYBODY GOT OUT SAFE

76
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,272
AND HOPEFULLY THEY GET

77
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:11,941
EVERYBODY TAKEN CARE OF AND GET

78
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:12,641
IT REBUILT QUICKLY.

79
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,944
IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE

80
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:17,980
IT'S EVER WHAT IT WAS BEFORE.

81
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:19,281
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T AFFECT

82
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:20,549
THEIR TOURISM TOO MUCH.

83
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,418
GREAT PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

84
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:23,786
HOPEFULLY THEY GET IT REBUILT

85
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:24,253
QUICK.

86
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:28,757
>> IN THE AIR WE SAW SEVERAL

87
00:02:28,758 --> 00:00:00,000
BLACKHAWKS AND MEDEVAC
