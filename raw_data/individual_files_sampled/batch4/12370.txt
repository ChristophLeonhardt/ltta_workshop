President Trump gives an uncomfortable press conference to say the least the left decides an MTF are the same as world war ii allies and the media decides that everything is hitler i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show okay so we're going to go through in detail president Trump's unnecessary and ridiculous press conference yesterday he said a couple of things that were true and then he did something that I thought was just morally egregious we're going to talk about all of it in the most fair-minded way that I think that we can we're going to go through all of the evidence on what President Trump said we're going to talk about the media response to all of it so get ready for a very very full show but before we get to any of that first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at rapper so you lose your wallet you lose your phone you lose your keys my wife is famous for losing her phone she loses it all the time or at least she did until we started using tracker eight

they know that we sent you has made my marriage in s similarly better and so you should use it for yourself as well save yourself time and effort okay so yesterday president Trump is doing a press conference it's supposed to be infrastructure week ok I'm getting there is something hilarious about the fact that every week with President Trump is a new week in which he declares the theme right it's American jobs week or its infrastructure week or it's relaxation week well this week was another infrastructure week and naturally he decided to burn every Bridge in sight in honor of infrastructure week so he gave his statement on Monday right he gave you yesterday and I talked briefly about or Tuesday and I talked briefly about that statement yesterday yes he said sorry to give the statement Monday he gave an original statement Saturday on Charlottesville lending of a statement Monday which we talked about yesterday and then after we finished the show yesterday Trump went out and did in unnecessary press conference he was not asked to do the press conference for anyone no one wanted him to do the press conference his own people didn't want him to do a press conference but Trump obviously had something on his mind and he wanted to say it and so he said to the press here now I'm going to take questions so he began he basically to sum up the press conference he spoke about a few different topics he spoke about the outlet what he called the alt left which would be an Tifa presumably alt left is a term I believe coined by Sean Hannity as sort of a councillor to be outright it I've never liked to turn alt left because it sort of legitimizes all right there is no alt left there is just the hard left and Antipa but in any case he went after what he called the alt left which I assume means an T but he talked about Confederate statues being removed he talked about whether what happened on Friday night and Saturday was bad and then he also talked about the people who were present at the at the rally he was specifically about the alright so he talked about those four things and so we'll go through all of those four now I will say as just a preparatory note the fact that the left has decided that everything that he said yesterday was false and the right has decided that everything that he said yesterday was true is really discomforting to me it's a serious problem for me okay he said some of the things yesterday they were true and then he said a good many things that I think we're actually immoral and we will talk about all of them but I think that it is necessary to go through in detail what exactly he said so we can tease out what he said was true and what he said was false so he started off by ripping and he feh here is what the President had to say about antiva what about the alt left they came charging at the as you say the alt right do they have any semblance of guilt whatever we ask you this what about the fact that came charging that they came charging with clubs in the hand swinging clubs do they have any problem I think they do you know as far as I'm concern that was a horrible horrible day wait a minute I'm not finished I'm not finished fakeness that was a horrible day I will tell you something I watch this very closely much more closely than you people watched it and you have you had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent and nobody wants to say that but I'll say it right now you had a group you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very very violent okay so the fact that Trump put so much focus on what he called the alt left here and I assume he means antifoam when he talks about them had the left up in arms they're saying why aren't you focusing more on the white supremacist rally and the fact that a white supremacist actually was responsible for murder rammed a car into 20 people at that at that particular rally on Saturday why are you focusing so much on the on the alt left I think that it is perfectly appropriate for the President of the United States to talk about the violence of NPFL which has been violent in Seattle they were violent Seattle again yesterday violent in Berkeley violent in Sacramento violent in Richmond violent yesterday okay so this is tape from yesterday this is still in Charlottesville they're at the courthouse and here's an Tifa getting into it with the police okay so Antipa has been violent and consistently violent for a long time now and what I'm seeing from the left is an attempt by the left two percent that NP f are the great heroes of this story then and people are standing up to tyranny that antia are standing up to the alright and therefore that an tyfa is is somehow a good force that something good is happening with NC fine you're seeing this from the left almost universally this morning it's a huge mistake by the left okay so here's your just a couple examples mit romney right who's not on the left but MIT Romney tweeted this out this morning or last night he tweeted no not the same one site is racist bigoted not see the other opposes racism and bigotry morally different universes okay again it is true that some of the protesters who were there to protest the the white supremacists were there and are completely morally different universes but Antiqua is not in a completely morally different universe and Tifa is it violent communist anarchist group that's been making violent trouble all around the country and then you had members of the press who are mimicking this talking point Hendrickson John Hendrickson is a writer at Esquire here's what he tweeted this morning he tweeted alt left Dougs who battled Nazis right and it's a picture of a bunch of World War two vets hey those were not alt left dogs those were American soldiers who were fighting armed Nazis who are engaged in violence and the sovereign and the takeover of a sovereign nation I assume that the alt-right white supremacist neo Nazis had actually in armed fashion taken over Charlottesville the we'd have sent the armed forces not an Tifa hey the alt left is much more akin to as I said yesterday the red mobs who were fighting the Brown Church in 1932 Germany and actually led to the increase in the vote chair for Hitler's for Hitler's Nazi Party because people got sick of watching the Reds fight the Browns and they sided with the Browns over the Reds but he's not the only one making this comparison Jeffrey Goldberg at the Atlantic needs to be tell watching Saving Private Ryan a movie about a group of very aggressive outlets protesters invading a beach without a permit well no that's idiotic it's about a group of American soldiers who are invading sovereign and French territory in order to oust the Nazis who are an actual fighting force okay not the same thing to compare people who are not behaving violently in charlottesville to people who are behaving violently on the beaches of France and to compare people who are our American soldiers - alt left protesters by the way would never join the American army in a thousand years to compare those people is just asinine it's morally asinine but you saw this this became a meme over the over the evening Brian Fallon is a Hillary Clinton spokesperson and here's what he tweeted it also confronted the Nazis without a permit and it's a picture of the guys from World War two waiting on to Normandy Beach insane okay same routine from Chris Cuomo who's an anchor over at CNN anti-fascists disrupting a large gathering of white supremacists and then it says let's not forget that's what Chris Cuomo wrote and it's not just the sort of idiots in the movement Marc Bray is a historian here's what he wrote in the pages of the Washington Post today quote this is again defending n Tifa the vast majority of the anti-fascist organizing is nonviolent but their willingness to physically defend themselves and others from white supremacists violence and preemptively shut down fascist organizing efforts before they turn deadly distinguishes them from liberal anti-racist anti-fascist argue that after the horrors of chattel slavery in the Holocaust physical violence against white supremacists is both ethically justifiable and strategically effective the history of anti-fascist demand that we take seriously the violence of white supremacist the days of just ignoring them are over and since European anti-fascist fought Hitler and they fought Stalin and they fought well even said they fought Stalin actually that would be actually incorrect they fought Mussolini's as they fought Franco there's only one problem with that the anti-fascist forces who fought Hitler and Franco and Mussolini they all lost okay the reason one of the reasons they all lost is because they actually made those movements more popular by going out there and engaging in street fights in vimar in 1930 31 32 230 people were killed in street clashes between the brown shirts and the Reds in 1932 that led to the rise of the brown shirts it led that people wanted a restoration of order so backing the so-called Anti Fog rupes is really bad okay it's really bad and keifa's tactics actually helped the all right because it makes people see the alt-right as victims it makes people feel that the alt-right are a group of people who just want to protest non-violently and then Antipa shows up and gets violent with them and world war ii allies fighting hitler shoulders soldiers were not fighting protesters they were fighting armed men with guns that's why we sent tanks and howitzers to fight them we don't send tanks and howitzers to rallies of neo-nazis the ACLU defended Nazis by marching in Skokie we didn't say guys with guns the alright isn't an army okay they're evil they believe in evil things the minute they get violent they should be arrested they should be put down but the idea that you can meet and the idea that can meet nonviolent protests even if people that you hate with violence is really dangerous it's really dangerous stuff and so when Trump says this stuff when Trump says that an Tifa attacked the all right and that there's evidence of that he's correct that is true okay that's true so that's what he said that I think was was true in a second I'm going to get to more what he said about the statues and then I want to get to what I think was the heart of his press conference which really wasn't that his the heart of the press conference was him doing a soft defense of the alt-right and really giving me all right what they wanted I know that a lot of people on the right are angry with me for saying this but that's the way I see it and I will explain in full context why that is in just a second but first I have to say thank you to my friends over at Birch gold so if you are looking at the situation in the United States look at the

totally fine okay but there are some problems okay and I'll get to the problems in a second he said something else that was true he was talking about the movement from the left to tear down statues now as I said yesterday I think there's a very solid case for taking Confederate war memorials and moving them into private museums moving them into private hands you know that the idea that black people should have to pay tax for the upkeep of statues of people who were attempting to keep them in slavery I understand that argument perfectly well and I sympathize to a large degree that argument I also think like Condoleezza Rice has said that ripping away historic monuments actually prevents people from discussing history openly the chipping away Woodrow Wilson off the name of buildings at Princeton prevents us from having honest discussions like if I would walk with my child pass Confederate war monument it would give me an opportunity to say look here's the history of the country here's how far we've come here's what the Civil War was all about and here's why the Confederacy deserved to lose so you know the truth is that when you drive through a city the vast majority of war memorials are things people walk right by so these are really not flash points they've been made flash points by two separate groups of people black lives matter which is decided these Confederate memorials are somehow the the gas in the tank for racists and racists themselves who have in retaliation have used the Confederate war memorials as gathering points which is really negative and and problematic here is a President Trump though saying here's his bigger problem is it the left isn't just focusing on Confederate war memorials there is a campaign among people on the left to go after memorials to Thomas Jefferson the writer of the Declaration of Independence and George Washington who was a slave owner and what he says here is also eminently correct George Washington was a slave owner was George Washington the slave owner so will George Washington now lose his status are we going to take down excuse me are we going to take down are we going to take down statues what how about Thomas Jefferson what do you think of Thomas Jefferson you like him okay good are we going to take down the statute because he was a major slave owner now we're going to take down his statue so you know what it's fine you're changing history you're changing culture okay so what he says there I think is at least arguably correct I think what he says there you can make a distinction I think logically pretty easily between robert e lee and george washington robert e lee fought on the side of a rebel of a rebel army attempting to destroy the union in an attempt to uphold slavery and George Washington was the great preserver of the Union so there's a pretty strong distinction there but the case that he's making is not wrong considering the left has actively made the case against keeping up statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson a University there was a big protest attempting to do all of this there's a big protest attempting to get rid of a statue of Thomas Jefferson at University of Missouri led by the black lives matter movement so Trump isn't wrong on this particular thing either and the right is jumping on the two points that I've talked about to say that everything Trump said was correct right what he said been on teapot is right and condemning both sides that's fine and the statute stopped he's right okay but here's the problem what the President of the United States had to do more than anything else was stick by his statement of Monday the statement rates and neo-nazis and white supremacists and their ilk these people are unacceptable in polite society and what they say is evil right that's that's all he had to do is all he had to do is keep saying that so what Trump did is he played a double game in his press conference he started he said I'm not talking about neo-nazis and white supremacists I think that they're bad right but he said also there are a lot of good people who showed up at these rallies and then he also said that he didn't know what the alt-right was somebody asked him specifically about the alt-right and he said he didn't know what it was so we're going to play all of these clips and you're going to see that Donald Trump provided the alt-right most what it wanted the alt-right wants to be known not as a white supremacist group they want their face to the public to be we're just defending Western civilization not white supremacism even if they are actual white supremacists and they want the President of the United States to lend them credence as though they're a bunch of very fine people this is what the alt-right wants okay we talked on Monday about exactly what the alt right is the alt rights basic Creed is that Western civilization is inherently bound up with ethnicity and race and that white people were the builders of Western civilization and therefore people of other races and cultures cannot adapt to Western civilization right that is the basic argument of the alt-right Trump knows that because his chief strategist at the White House is Steve Bannon who helped promulgate the outright and said that Breitbart was in fact a platform for the alt-right to rest quote from Steve Danon I'm a trump played stupid and in doing so he gave the alt-right what they wanted he focused on the left again that's fine but if you're going to focus on the left you can't you can't poo poo with you all right yeah this is the problem on both sides the left is saying everything he said about NTP is wrong and the right is saying everything that he said about NT was right and therefore he's right or therefore he's wrong no he's right about Antipa and he's totally wrong about the outright and even granting them a smidgen of credibility is morally disgusting okay and that's what he yesterday to pretend otherwise is to ignore that when Barack Obama did the same thing to black lives matter the right went nuts and rightly so when Barack Obama granted credence to the people who are burning down Ferguson in Baltimore the right right Lee went nuts we went nuts as well we should have we said he was vague and Watson wait he condemned the people rioting and we said that wasn't enough he needed to condemn what they were rioting about okay President Trump really tried hard to soft-pedal this stuff yesterday so he started off by defending his statement on Saturday why exactly he was asked why didn't take till Monday for you to say neo-nazis in the KKK and neo Confederates were bad why didn't you just say it on Saturday here was his answer I had to see the facts unlike a lot of reporters unlike a lot of reporters out there because I know Jamie Duke was there I wanted to see the facts and the facts as they started coming out were very well stated in fact everybody said his statement was beautiful if he would have made it sooner that would have been good I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts frankly people still don't know all of the facts okay so this is nonsense everyone knew all the facts virtually immediately and Tifa got violent and then in alt-right protests or drove a car into a crowd of people who included a bunch of innocent non Antipa people and the alt-right people were violent as well okay so he says he had to wait for the facts first of all you know that's a tell okay Trump has never ever in his entire life had to wait for the fact this is a guy who spends a year proclaiming the Barack Obama without evidence was born in Kenya this is a guy who goes out preemptively and declares Muslim terrorist attacks before all the facts are in and some of that is not a huge problem but to pretend that he is the considerate arbiter of the fact is just a joke okay that is not a good excuse from President Trump it's obviously not a good excuse you repeated muscleman ten times in a three-minute segment how he was waiting for all of the facts such nonsense such an absolute nonsense especially since we know from Eliana johnson over at the washington post by the way Eliana is kind of conservative okay she's a claremont color when i was a quitter my fellow Eliana johnson who writes for The Washington Post she reported that Trump had a statement exactly the same as the one on Monday on his desk on Saturday he was standing with him right there and he went off script and decided not to say it okay so there's another reason that Trump didn't want to do this and that's because Trump is happy to pander to the alright he was always happy to pander to the alright during the campaign he pandered to the alt-right he continued to pander to be alright because he thinks that they're his biggest supporters and they're nice to him so he has to soft-pedal them and he did that again yesterday who's that specifically about the alt-right okay the alt-right had to find it now 1,000 times they define it themselves Richard Spencer was at this rally okay Jared Taylor his people were at this rally the daily stormer neo-nazis were at this rally it was it was it was actually pitched like this okay the ad promoting the unite the right rally it was designed to evoke a fascist posters with John pine warrants right he's correct invited speakers like Mike anok who hosts a podcast called The Daily Show up Augustus Invictus and all right figure who once said I have prophesied for years I was born for a great war that if I had not witnessed the coming of the second American Civil War I would begin it myself and Christopher Cantwell who called himself a fascist along with Johnny monoxide who said who calls himself a she okay the March the March his organizer Jason Kessler described the views of the people who showed up and you don't give a damn about white people you people are implementing policies which are displacing us in our home countries and we will not be allowed to survive okay the goal of this rally was extraordinarily clear so much so the Gavin McInnes the head of the proud boys and a guy with whom I've been friendly Gavin said I will not go to this rally because it's infused with white supremacist and neo-nazis okay the alt-right was a group of people who decided to show up for this rally because they are part of this movement and the alt-right and here is Trump being asked about the alt-right and here is Trump pretending he doesn't know what it is when you say the alt-right define alt-right to me you define it the militants to find it for me come on let's go define it for me it's not a fight how about you define it how about you say if by the alt-right you mean X then I then I condemn it if by the alright you mean people who like memes I don't alright how about he could do that but the defensive nasaw right is really truly incredible and then it gets even worse and I'll show you the even worse part in just a second but first I want to tell you about upside calm so right now upside calm is the best travel site on the web you bundle your flight and your hotel you

that promo club and they know that we sent you okay so as I say he went out of his way not to condemn the alright and then here's the part that a lot of his allies are relying on he says that he's condemned neo-nazis and white supremacist but here here's what he says I've condemned neo-nazis I've condemned many different groups but not all of those people were neo-nazis believe me not all of those people were white supremacist by any stretch okay so combine those two statements he doesn't know what the alt-right is and not all of those people were neo-nazis and white supremacist that is the defense of the alt-right that is an attempt to paint the alt-right as non white supremacist non neo-nazi that is what that is okay and then it got worse then it got worse he said he specifically cited the Friday night torchlight March okay the one where he had Richard Spencer and he had Christopher Caldwell he had all these people literally chanting in the street carrying tiki torches and shouting Jews will not replace us right this is what he had to say about that particular rally and if you reported it accurately you would say I mean you had a very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides you had people in that group excuse me excuse me I saw the same pictures as you did you had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a park from robert e lee to another name okay so again this is really quite despicable when you look at the actual tape okay so here is the tape of the protests okay this is what the protest that he is talking about or filled with very fine people this is a tape of the protest it to be a clip three this is what that actually looked like Oh person's right there yeah general advice has some pretty good tape of all this day the 22 minute documentary they brought out about this the first 10 minutes is really stunning material the rest of it is is vices bias but the first 10 minutes of this is stunning material here's what the rally actually looked like on Friday night in the center there the anti what just happened they base week yeah I don't know one second okay so number one you see that Friday night that was not a lot of good people there weren't some very fine people marching and by the way if you find yourself in a March just a tip to people if you find yourself in a March where people start shouting Jews will not replace us maybe you should leave maybe you should leave if you're not a piece of garbage maybe you should leave why is it that even the people who are all right friendly even people who ally with the alt-right from time to time looked at this unite the right event and decided not to show why is that there's a reason for that even people like Mike Serna metric he spent a year propping up the alright why is the people like Mike Stern vich said I'm not showing up why do you think was it because it was filled with very fine people as president Trump says there were a lot of very fine people okay also important to notice on this tape the guy who's wiping his face off here is again and Christopher Caldwell open racist says that president he wishes President Trump or more racist and he's very upset the president Trump would allow his daughter to marry a Jew and he was maced here again Christopher Caldwell is a disgusting piece of garbage but macing people is not something that you get to do in the United States for peacefully protesting even for evil causes here's some more of the tape from Vice we're here obeying the law we're doing everything that we're supposed to do trying to express opinions and the criminals are over there get in their way and that is a that is a foundational problem our society and whatever you think of my opinion that's going to be something puts you in danger and that is because this city is run by Jewish communists criminal we did not initiate force against anybody we're not a nonviolent dope you kill these people be happy although he is he's saying that he'll kill people if he has to but again this is why auntie phones activities are really bad okay auntie feh is just grams and credibility to the alt-right saying oh we're just here for defensive purposes we're just here for offensive for okay so a lot of sorry almost cursed there a lot of really crappy people on both sides okay that is true but it is unfair for the presidents of the United States to say that there were a lot of very fine people who are marching on Friday night there were not or if there were I would like to see the evidence of it does not mean everyone who opposes the robert e lee statue coming down is a bad person okay i've said that i started the show with that I think the Trump is not wrong about some of the things he says about the Confederate statuary but when he says there are a lot of very fine people and oh what's the alt-right I've never heard of it what does it do okay that is really really gross and you can see why people are reacting so negatively to it the President of the United States is a moral responsibility to say not only that white supremacists and neo-nazis are terrible and believe terrible things but that the alt-right is terrible particularly because they claim him as an ally that does matter it does matter when people claim you as an ally it becomes a more incumbent on you to disassociate from them if you want to disassociate from them if somebody says if somebody says publicly today for example is stupid example martin shkreli's like the weird pharmaceutical brozac who's now in jail for fraud he tweeted something out about how he wanted to run for president make me his vice president and i immediately tweeted out if elected I will not serve if nominated I will not run like what the hell hey that's not my guy right that time that's not somebody who I'm interested in being associated with and that's not that's a funny ridiculous example but if you have an entire movement of people who believe what Christopher Caldwell believes but are just a little quieter about it and they claim that you support them as president of the United States why don't you do what Ronald Reagan did and just denounce them and say I don't want your support I don't want you anywhere near me but apparently Steve Danon over the weekend was telling Trump that he couldn't alienate a lot of these people because if he did then he'd lose his base the truth is that it would actually alien a Bandhan space but not from space okay Trump space is very large Trump is the President of the United States his responsibility to stands up for everyone in the United States and Steve Antin space is not that large Steve Maddens base is very alt-right driven there are a lot of people on the alt-right who like Bannon and see him as their great protector and that's why Bannon is motivate to protect the alt-right Trump is motivated to protect them not confuse a racist or a neo-nazi because Trump is motivated to sound off in favor of any or at least protect anybody who is ever nice to him anybody's and this is

because of the left's willingness to go all the way with an Tifa there's a reactionary side to the right that says okay well the alt-right isn't that bad like what Trump said yesterday wasn't that bad there wasn't anything morally wrong with it you see people are so hesitant to alienate sort of the hard core all right Trump support base and that's not that's a small percentage of Trump supporters by the way the vast majority of Trump supporters are not alright support it's a very small group of people but people are so hesitant to alienate that they are hesitant to condemn in moral terms what the president did yesterday and what he did was immoral yesterday it was an immoral thing the president did yesterday by pretending he didn't know what the alt-right was and then suggesting that there were very fine people who showed up for that rally on Friday night and then suggesting that not all those people were white supremacists and putting this sort of equal focus on the what he called the alt left with the with the all right again the alt left the the NP faux groups are evil but it was an all right guy who murdered someone on Saturday it was an all right guy who drove a car into a crowd and murdered a woman and killed and hurt 19 other people there is plenty of time to discuss the evil to man Tifa there's plenty of time to discuss the evils of leftist violence we do it on the show routinely you know yesterday it's fine dimension Antiques is violent it is not fine to either equate the activities of the two at these particular rallies or to suggest that the or to suggest that the alright was not a part of this it's it it's what they all record of wished for the proof was in the pudding both Richard Spencer and David Duke celebrated president from statements yesterday if I were President Trump I wouldn't want David Duke or Richard Spencer celebrating me for any reason Under the Sun in any case this is broken out into into an intellectual fight on the right Laura Ingraham who of course has been a very very strong supporter of President Trump throughout the campaign and was talking about as press secretary when she was on Fox News and she said well the big problem is that this doesn't forward the president's policy agenda I always like to think about it this way is he advancing his agenda that's what happened this afternoon and I will say when you had Gary Cohen up there talking about they're going to hit the ground running on tax reform we're ready we spent the whole day doing it I was like I wanted to hear more and more and more that's great and we got sidetracked on this horrific event of the weekend which he had made the subsequent statement about that was I think really really good I think he could have been more specific clearly on Saturday but when he said we must love each other show affection for each other unite together and condemn that hatred bigotry of the violence that we thought that was so great yesterday I think today he's really torched about people conflating Trump's support with white nationalists you can see it and hear it as responsive and I understand that but he's not there to win every debating point people want to see a calm president in the storm I think today why think he made some points that were factually right there were the word lot that was violence on both sides in that event on Saturday anyone who's watched the video could see it okay what she says there is not all wrong but it is also a massive misdirect and that's what Krauthammer immediately comes back ancestry says you know that is that it's really a cop-out to say that what Trump said yesterday was wrong because it distracts from his agenda he's a real cop at what he did wrong yesterday was wrong it was just wrong I mean it was a morally wrong thing to do so Krauthammer says that and then Ingram immediately comes back by doing this this tired boring talking point where she says that anybody who's just satisfied with anything Trump does it's just because they hate Trump personally I am so bored with this bull crap I can't even tell you the fact is I want the same things that Laura Ingraham wants in terms of policy at least 70% of the way the idea that I'm sitting there rooting for Trump to fail is nonsense I want Trump to do the right thing I want him to do the right thing not only for the agenda but morally I want him to do the right thing I want him to do the ethically right thing I want him to come out and condemn the all right I want the alt-right exercise I think there are cancer on our movement I want him to call out mpfi celebrate him calling out an Tifa but he needs to also call out the people who are evil within his own movement and if he won't do that clearly and concisely not just 99 times out of 100 not just I'm irritated having to do it it should be easy okay I remember a couple of weeks ago I was on with the Dana Perino on Fox News debating some guy from care and I said why don't you condemn the Muslim Brotherhood and he said why don't you condemn the KKK I said sure the KKK is going to garbage human beings without any skin off my nose did I feel bad about that defi like oh how dare he demand that I did who cares defend bad condemned bad people why is this difficult it's not difficult it's such a gimme it's such a gimme and the fact that he didn't do it is immoral it's immoral you can see that people around who know it here's tape of John Kelly okay John Kelly his new White House chief of staff the guy who's going to save the Trump administration from Trump's sort of chaos this is actual tape of John Kelly an honorable man reacting to president Trump's press conference yesterday was beautiful is what if they as soon as ever vision I couldn't make it sir because they didn't jump all of the facts frankly people still don't know it was very important to me to get the facts up and correct because if I would have benefited and the first thing we paint without really much other than what we would see the second look how uncomfortable is it not what were the many side you were talking about sorry still sighs mr. president okay Kelly did this for 15 minutes it was just him staring into the abyss for 15 minutes Kelly was not a happy camper nor should he have been nor should he have been and I'm tired of this cop-out that you know if he does something immoral it's only a distraction from polity immoral things are immoral and also tired of this cop-out that if I think something he did is immoral it's because I want him to fail or I'm anti-trump he's the president I want him to succeed he's the president I want him to do good things just enough now the media is not helping any of this of course because the media have decided not just condemn Trump for doing what he's obviously doing pandering to the all right but they have decided that it is important to call him an actual Nazi so Jimmy Kimmel suggested that President Trump cuts eye holes out of his venture use natural member of the KKK that's another another disturbing Monday in America you know we went into the weekend worrying about Kim Jong Un's starting a war we came out of it wondering if our president is cutting eyeholes out of his bed sheets you know as you know this weekend of Virginia the worst people in the United States went to the hardware store bought tiki torches lit them up in March in Charlottesville and nonviolent protesters was killed by a white supremacist and to the president who is the president by the way went on television to say this we condemn in the strongest possible you know it's gone with Kimmel Big E you can see the Kimmel is obviously calling Trump a Nazi David Axelrod who was the the former White House communications director I believe under President Obama he was his campaign strategist in 2008 he said that Trump bleached the white robes of the KKK listen this this press conference was in every way shape and form a car wreck for the president it showed a guy who was melting down it showed a guy who was small-minded intemperate and sending dog whistles to white supremacists and neo-nazis which is why they have thanked him for his comments I mean he he was bleaching their white robes and he was shining their shields with his remarks today and he may say he condemned them but that's not the way anybody in America read that it's the idea that this is the idea that from Axelrod is of course that Trump isn't doing this for political gain he's doing this because he actually sympathizes with white supremacism I don't think that's what's going on with Trump and this is one of the things that's bothered me about the leftist take on all this it bothered me with Steve Danon okay Steve Annan is a guy I know and personally dislike very strongly I think Steve's a bad human being but when people said that Steve was a racist or an anti-semite I had to say I don't see any evidence of that I do see evidence that he's willing to pander to those groups for political gain the left can't just stick to the truth they cannot just stick to the truth I've been saying this for a year okay they can't just stick to the truth of what's going on they have to declare not only that Trump is a Nazi but everyone who supports him as a Nazi everybody on the right is a Nazi and then an Tifa is a group of glorious World War two allies who are fighting the bad guys okay and keifa shut down a rally in Portland or a bunch of Republicans just wanted to march in the Rose Parade as they do every year but this is what the left is doing I said this yesterday both of the radical the rabbit of the left is embracing the radical left and the right in response is increasingly winking and nodding at the radical right and and I don't even think that the alright is right but I think that they are Trump supporters in the main because they see in Trump and Ally against the sjw's and and against political correctness and it's dangerous on both sides it's getting more dangerous at the very least can we start with no violence can we start with an Tifa should be arrested when they commit acts of violence and then we'll talk about how everybody in the United States needs to condemn including the President of the United States need to come out and and cut out the cancer that is the alt right okay all right is the cancer there blight I mean and in fact the president will do that is it's so disheartening I can't in some days it's very hard to do the show because it's so disheartening when you see the moral the moral emptiness on both sides of the political aisle for partisan gain it really is quite horrifying to me and I'm I'm as conservative as anyone in America and I find this to end and not only do I think that that you know in spite of my conservatism I think all this stuff is terrible I think because of my conservatism I think all the stuff is terrible conservatives believe in individual liberty and individual value we believe in the idea that human beings were made in God's image each and every one of us we believe in the idea of respect and tolerance for other people's views we believe in the idea the best views will win we believe in the idea that the government shouldn't get involved in the stuff because we believe all the things I just mentioned and if we if we are willing to wink and nod at all of these bad things in order to advance in order to advance our agenda on either side then we're just we're part of the problem we'll make in the country a lot worse place it's really it's really horrifying okay what that said time for some things I like some things I hate in a quick Bible so quick Bible study so things I like over the weekend they had a chance to read a highly recommended book called the sojourn by Andrew Quebec and there's a book about world war 1 and it's about a guy who is he grows up very very young in the United States and then he moves back to Czechoslovakia or what becomes Czechoslovakia and ends up joining up with the austro-hungarian army in World War one it's a very beautifully written novel it's very spare it's very reminiscent of A Farewell to Arms by Hemingway and it's already being counted as sort of a world of one classic he apparently wrote a sequel that I'm looking forward to reading about Vietnam War it's called the sojourn by Andrew Kovac good piece of fiction and it reminds us that despite partisan fights and there are certain human values that we should hold dear together it's very good book go out and buy it okay time for some things that I think so I've been I've been focusing a lot on sports TV lately because it seems like everything is becoming more more politicized and so Stephen H Smith has come in for some heavy criticism on the show recently yesterday Stephen a Smith suggested that the race of a protester grants that protester legitimacy or illegitimacy here's Stephen hmm suggesting that white people should never be able to tell black people not to protest no white person has the right to tell black folks when you should protest about something because usually protests that emanates from the black community is due in large part because of the transgressions exactly against that community by those who don't happen to be black and then you wonder why there's an alt right now you want to write there's a white identity politics white people can never tell black people not to protest for any reason so what about when white people say the same thing what about in the alt Rights is the same thing what about when the alt-right white identity disgusting human being say well black people can't tell us not to protest after all there are policies like affirmative action why should how can they tell us that went on the victims this is what's wrong with the country but this is happening in the mainstream okay that's not a march around a robert e lee statue in in the middle of virginia this is on national TV on ESPN Stephen H Smith is a sports commentator this sort of stuff makes the country worse it makes the country worse okay one more thing that I hate so Iran is now threatening a nuclear restart thank you Obama administration thank you on August 15th Iran's president warned it could restart its nuclear program within hours or days if the Trump administration continues its confrontational policy toward the Islamic Republic I thought that we were guaranteed that Iran was now going to be non-nuclear I thought that everything was going to be hunky-dory now ya know it turns out that when you deal with evil people when you cut deals with evil people you end up with with the crap in your lap and that's basically what's happened here okay so time for a very quick Bible study a little bit of inspirational uplift in the middle of a very dark week so as I mentioned every week that we've been going through not the Torah but the haftorah the tour is the five books of Moses every week the Jews also read a portion from the prophets and the writings that corresponds to the portion from the Torah reading we do that because back in Roman times Jews were not allowed to read from the Torah they were barred from reading from the Torah so instead they started reading references from the prophets and the writings that people could could easily cross-reference to the Torah itself so this comes courtesy of Isaiah this is chapter 54 of Isaiah incline your ear and come to me hearken and your soul shall live and I will make for you an everlasting covenant the dependable mercies of David behold a witness to nations I have appointed appointed him a ruler and a commander of nations he's talking about King David messianic era may idea that eventually there will be a messianic era in which the kingdom of David will shine forth there's a part that I think is really interesting here is where he says behold a witness to nations I have appointed him a ruler and commander we tend to think about the messianic age a lot as the idea that that good will rule and command but it's not just that it's about witnessing and this is something we should all take to heart okay we are all witnesses we are not just about ruling we're not just about power it's not just about who controls the levers of power we are all witnesses to good and evil we all are going to be called on by God to testify when our time comes as to whether we stood up or whether we stood with or whether we stood against and we are all witnesses we're witnesses to all the things that go on around us and to shut our eyes to blind ourselves that we are not called upon to witness is part of the problem we are all part of this together if we don't witness evil and speak out about it if we're not able to testify even on our own behalf as to what we think about bad things that are happening then we don't deserve the Messianic era let alone good in the afterlife or even good on this planet I think that as people who are delegated at certain responsibility by God and and by our fellow man we have to stand up to evil when we see it we have to call it out when we see it okay we'll be back here tomorrow hopefully we'll have a good day of news how about that'd be nice wouldn't it and then we can do something fun please mr. president please mediate please for the love of God can we have a nice day I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you
