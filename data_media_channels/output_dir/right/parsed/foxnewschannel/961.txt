>> Shannon: THIS IS A FOX NEWS
ALERT.
CANDIDATES BACKED BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP SCORING WINS
TONIGHT.
COREY STEWART, DEFENDER OF
CONFEDERATE STATUES, WINNING
VIRGINIA G.O.P. SENATE NOMINEE.
WHAT COULD BE ANOTHER UPSET,
INCUMBENT MARK SANFORD TRAILING
REPRESENTATIVE KATIE ARRINGTON
IN THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY
ELECTION.
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIPPED SANFORD
TODAY, SAY HE'S BETTER OFF IN
ARGENTINA.
A REFERENCE TO HIS AFFAIR WITH
THE JOURNALIST.
>> IT MAY HAVE COST ME THE
ELECTION BUT I STAND BY EVERY
ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS TO
DISAGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT.
STEPHEN CHRIS STIREWALT.
MORE RESULTS IN KEY RACES.
WELCOME.
MARK SANFORD HAS NEVER LOST AN
ELECTION BEFORE.
>> THAT IS RIGHT.
>> Shannon: THIS GUY HAS BEEN
A WINNER THROUGH ALL KINDS OF
TUMULTUOUS THINGS.
>> HE WAS A WINNER AFTER A
PERIOD AFTER HE WENT DARK,
STEPPED BACK FROM PUBLIC LIFE
AFTER HE RESIGNED THE
GOVERNORSHIP.
BLOW UP SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICS.
THIS WAS A GUY ON TRACK TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENT.
HE WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PICK IF
YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE FIELD
FOR 2012.
HE WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT PICK
UNTIL HE EXPLODED HIS CAREER.
THEN HE CAME BACK WITH A LOT OF
HUMILITY, A LOT OF DEFERENCE AND
SINCERE APOLOGY.
VOTERS GAVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.
WHAT HE FOUND OUT WAS HE HAD A
SHORT LEASH.
THAT MEANT ANY CRITICISM OF THE
PRESIDENT, ANY BUCKING THE PARTY
LINE, THIS IS A GUY WHO'S VERY
CONSERVATIVE.
MEGA CONSERVATIVE.
THE GUYS ON THE FREEDOM CAUCUS
LIKE HIM.
THE LIBERTARIAN LEADERS LIKE
HIM.
THE VERDICT HERE WAS BECAUSE OF
HIS BAGGAGE, AND SHE WENT RIGHT
AFTER HIS BAGGAGE AND HER ADS,
MADE A LOT OF HIS AFFAIR AND
SCANDAL.
SHE WENT AFTER THAT IN ADDITION
TO THE POINTS HE'S DISAGREED
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> Shannon: PRESIDENT TRUMP
FIGURED INTO A RACE IN VIRGINIA
WERE COREY STEWART, IT LOOKS
LIKE, GOING TO BE THE G.O.P.
NOMINEE AGAINST TIM KAINE IN THE
FALL.
THE AP DESCRIBED COREY STEWART
"HE CAMPAIGNED LAST YEAR ON
PRESERVING VIRGINIA'S
CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS AND IS AN
IMMIGRANT HARD-LINER.
"THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO
LOVE HIM.
THAT'S WHY THEY VOTED FOR HIM.
THIS LINES UP WITH WHERE THE
PRESIDENT'S.
HE'S BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE
PRESIDENT.
HE GOT IN TROUBLE WHEN HE WAS
COCHAIRING THE STATE CAMPAIGN.
HE DECIDED TO HAVE THE
DEMONSTRATION IN FRONT OF THE
RNC OFFICE.
FOLKS SAYING THEY WONDER HOW
IT'S GONNA PLAY BROADLY.
AND DOWN TO GET IN VIRGINIA.
>> REPUBLICAN TURNOUT IN
VIRGINIA WAS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW
WHERE IT WAS LAST YEAR THE
PRIMARY.
COREY STEWART WAS TRYING TO TAKE
ON ED GILLESPIE.
COREY STEWART ISN'T GOING TO BE
A BIG PART OF HELPING TURN
VIRGINIA BLUE.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE HIS SUPPORT
CAME FROM, HOW FEW PEOPLE TURNED
OUT TO VOTE, AND IF YOU LOOK AT
HIS MESSAGE AND YOU LOOK AT HIS
PERFORMANCE IN THESE NORTHERN
COUNTIES IN VIRGINIA, HE IS OUT
OF STEP.
WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO TRY
TO DO.
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE
COREY STEWART THE FACE OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THAT WILL PUT THE NATIONAL
REPUBLICANS.
THERE WILL BE A SPLIT.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY
DISAVOW COREY STEWART BUT AT THE
SAME TIME --
>> Shannon: THE PRESIDENT
SHOWING UP TO CAMPAIGN WITH HIM.
DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN?
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN.
I WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU HE WAS
GOING TO HAVE A BILATERAL SUMMIT
