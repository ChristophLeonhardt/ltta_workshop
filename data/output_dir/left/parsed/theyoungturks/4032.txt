THERE IS WORD THAT A UNITY
TICKET FOR THE 2020 ELECTION IS
GOING TO BE COMING ACROSS OUR
LANDSCAPE.
JOHN KASICH, YOU WILL
REMEMBER, THE WINNER OF THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY, THE LAST
REALLY VIABLE CANDIDATE TO LEAVE
THE RACE IN 2016, THE GOVERNOR
OF OHIO, HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY
THAT FIRST, HE AND JOHN
HICKENLOOPER, THE GOVERNOR OF
COLORADO AND FORMER MAYOR OF
DENVER, THERE ARE RUMORS THAT
THEY WILL FORM A UNITY TICKET.
THE SOURCE THAT BROKE THIS STORY
TO CNN SAID 
THIS --
JIMMY, WHY CAN'T IT HAPPEN IN
WASHINGTON?
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I DON'T
KNOW THE ANSWER OF WHAT IT CAN
HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON, BUT THIS
IS SO BACKWARDS.
PEOPLE THINK
THIS IS WHAT AMERICA WANTS.
PEOPLE IN A BUBBLE THINK THAT.
NO NORMAL, REGULAR PERSON THAT
I'VE EVER TALKED TO WANTS TO SEE
THIS HAPPEN.
HICKENLOOPER, WHO
WAS IN BED WITH FRACKERS, HE'S A
NEO-LIBERAL, I HAD HIGHER HOPES
FOR HIM THAN WHAT HE'S TURNING
OUT TO BE, BUT NO ONE IS SAYING
WE REALLY NEED FOR DEMOCRATS TO
BECOME MORE LIKE REPUBLICANS, OR
FOR REPUBLICANS TO BECOME --
NO ONE IS SAYING THIS.
THIS IS SOME FAKE IDEA THAT
CHRIS MATTHEWS PROBABLY
THOUGHT UP, BECAUSE I'VE HEARD
HIM SAY THIS BEFORE, HE
TOLD HILLARY CLINTON THAT SHE
SHOULD PICK JOHN KASICH.
THEY DIDN'T INVENT IT,
HISTORICALLY PEOPLE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE FROM
OPPOSITE SIDES TO JOIN TOGETHER,
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED, NOT SINCE
GORE PICKED LIEBERMAN --
THAT TURNED OUT WELL.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
POLITICAL CONVERSATION, THEY
WERE IN THE SAME PARTY,
LIEBERMAN WAS A DEMOCRAT, IT WAS
BEFORE HE TOOK AN INDEPENDENT
RUN -- BUT I AGREE WITH YOU,
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN POLITICS
DON'T WANT THAT, PEOPLE ON THE
OUTSIDE OF POLITICS HATE HEARING
THE FIGHTING, THEY HATE CONGRESS
AT 8% BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS
BIGGER AND NOT GET ANYTHING
DONE.
AND I'M TALKING IN BROAD
STROKES HERE, BUT I AGREE WITH
YOU.
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THIS, I
WOULDN'T WANT THIS, BUT WHY
DON'T THEY?
IF THESE PEOPLE
CAN'T STAND THE FIGHTING SO
MUCH, HAVE THESE PEOPLE JOIN, DO
A UNITY CAMPAIGN, AND GET US
OVER THE HUMP.
A SORT OF A
GERALD FORD TO GET US OUT OF
THIS MESS.
BECAUSE THAT THE OPPOSITE OF
HOW POLITICS IS SUPPOSED TO
WORK.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
TWO PARTIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT
IDEAS, AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH OUR POLITICAL CLASS, THEY
DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS.
HICKENLOOPER AND KASICH ARE
BOUGHT BY THE SAME PEOPLE,
THAT'S WHY THIS IS EVEN AN IDEA.
BECAUSE IT'S PALATABLE TO THEIR
DONOR CLASS, WHICH AS WE KNOW
RUNS OUR GOVERNMENT, THE
PRINCETON STUDY HAS REVEALED
THAT WE DON'T LIVE IN A
DEMOCRACY, WE LIVE IN AN
OLIGARCHY.
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
GET UPSET WHEN PEOPLE FIGHT IN
WASHINGTON, DC, PEOPLE GET UPSET
WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS IN
WASHINGTON, DC.
PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE BERNIE
SANDERS OR TRUMP FIGHTING,
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE PEOPLE
FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING, NOT
PRETENDING WE DON'T HAVE TO
FIGHT FOR SOMETHING.
THEN I MISSPOKE A LITTLE BIT,
BECAUSE WHAT I MEANT WAS NOT
LIKE THAT NOTHING GETS DONE
BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING, NOT
THAT THEY DON'T WANT PASSION.
AND YOU ARE RIGHT WITH THE
BEGINNING OF WHAT YOU SAID,
WHICH IS THE ANSWER, POLITICS
IS ABOUT FIGHTING HARD FOR
YOUR SIDE, MAKING COMPROMISES,
BUT NOT COMPROMISES ABOUT
WHO LEADS THE COUNTRY AND THE
PARTY.
I AGREE.
YOU ARE RIGHT, THE
OLIGARCHS WOULD LOVE THIS.
THEY
WOULD LOVE FOR DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS TO COME TOGETHER TO
DO ALL THE STUFF THEY WANT YOU
TO DO, ALL THE CORPORATIST
STUFF.
SLASHING CORPORATE TAXES,
GUTTING REGULATION, ALLOWING
THEM TO HAVE A MONOPOLY
IN EVERY INDUSTRY.
THEY CONTROL EVERYTHING.
AND THE OLIGARCHS WOULD LOVE
JOHN KASICH.
THEY WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY LOVE JOHN
HICKENLOOPER, BUT JOHN KASICH I
WOULD IMAGINE WOULD BE THE
PRESIDENT IN THIS SITUATION.
SO
IT'S NOT A COMPROMISED TICKET,
I'LL MAKE HICKENLOOPER MY VICE
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT
DOES NOTHING, IT WON'T HAVE ANY
EFFECT.
JOE BIDEN WAS A GOOD
CHEERLEADER, THE SENATE LOVED
HIM, HE WAS A GOOD LIAISON, MIKE
PENCE HASN'T MADE AS MUCH OF AN
IMPACT, PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD
BE ABLE TO SWAY CONGRESS MORE
THAN HE HAS, BUT HICKENLOOPER
WOULD DO NOTHING.
IT WOULD BE A
KASICH PRESIDENCY, EVERYONE
WOULD LOVE JOHN KASICH, WHO IS
AN OLIGARCH.
THAT'S THE WHITEST
FLAG DEMOCRATS COULD THROW UP.
THE VICE PRESIDENT'S JOB IS TO
GO TO FUNERALS, IF THIS HAPPENED
JOHN HICKENLOOPER WOULD GO
TO THE FUNERAL OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
YOU KNOW WHO TRIED THIS WAS
BARACK OBAMA.
THERE WAS A
DISCONNECT BETWEEN OBAMA AND A
LOT OF THE MASSES, SO WHEN HE
SAID HE WOULD CHANGE WASHINGTON
IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY I THINK
PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD CHANGE
THE WAY POLITICS IS DONE IN THE
SENSE THAT LOBBYISTS WOULD BE
OUT AND POLITICIANS WOULD BE
MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE.
WHAT BARACK OBAMA MEANT WAS THAT
HE WILL HELP THE TWO SIDES STOP
THE BICKERING AND THE FIGHTING
AND INSTEAD OF A RED AMERICA AND
A BLUE AMERICA THERE WILL BE A
PURPLE AMERICA AND WE ALL GET
ALONG, THAT WAS HIS VISION OF
CHANGING THE WAY WASHINGTON
WORKS.
BUT AS JIMMY SAID, PEOPLE
WANT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO
FIGHT FOR WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU.
THEY DO, BUT THEY DO CARE,
STEVE, ABOUT NOT GETTING
ANYTHING DONE.
BUT THERE IS
FIGHTING WITHIN A PARTY TOO
