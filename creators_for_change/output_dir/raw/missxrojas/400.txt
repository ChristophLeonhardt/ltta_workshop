00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
hey guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">old-school eyesight video blog ething</font>

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,970
today's challenge was to watch a classic

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,649
film but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a lot of work to do</font>

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,450
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so which day I started</font>

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,070
watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back on vales</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go I decided</font>

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,719
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch the graduate and because I've</font>

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">never seen it and I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I haven't</font>

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,599
claimed trip seen it but it's kind of

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,100
release things that you know you're

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,020
supposed to have seen after it was quite

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,000
appropriate because I graduate in about

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,949
six months or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was really good but</font>

14
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,359
it was quite surprising i didn't i

15
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,519
didn't expect that I mean there's the

16
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,740
famous mrs. Robinson song but I didn't

17
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">expect that music would pay such a key</font>

18
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,640
role in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> film there's these huge</font>

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,370
elapsed silences and and the music

20
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,680
really works kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill the absence of</font>

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,980
dialogue you really feel Ben's apathy

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,350
like he's just recently graduated people

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,940
keep asking him what he's gonna do with

24
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,680
his life a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that I am becoming</font>

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,690
very very familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just kind</font>

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,129
of unusual I didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

27
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,989
the absence of dialogue I thought it

28
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be quite like a sharp quick witty</font>

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
film and the humor was happening there

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a very specific style of humor but it</font>

31
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't and it wasn't dialogue heavy like</font>

32
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,940
that wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all the focus of it so</font>

33
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,739
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really good and because we're</font>

34
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,020
just just<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking unexpected and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love</font>

35
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,930
the style of it I loved what the the

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,229
actress I think Connie was like my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

37
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,560
was and but she plays<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elaine and she has</font>

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,490
great kind of 60 style hair and and kind

39
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the cusp of the 70s and and it's</font>

40
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,200
like this in this amazing jacket and

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,759
these political boots and it was just

42
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,710
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch yeah the soundtrack</font>

43
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,320
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant and and a lot the time</font>

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,140
you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one song would be playing for</font>

45
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,460
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes because it would be</font>

46
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">broken up with dialogue and then the</font>

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,180
song will start again or with like with

48
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,770
some cases with them the sound of

49
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,750
silence funnily enough would be one that

50
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,630
was recurring and he'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like bits of</font>

51
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,970
it kind of halfway through the film and

52
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,950
then it would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up again it's the</font>

53
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,049
very last song played so yeah I think

54
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,850
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font>

55
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,310
to me was the use of sound but I love

56
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,640
Benjamin's very nice red convertible and

57
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,619
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> storyline was good like</font>

58
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,360
anything it was a particularly

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
exceptional storyline and i think that

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,429
the story line itself and necessarily

61
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">just something critically unique but I I</font>

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,569
did like the way that the film was

63
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,830
executed in terms of

64
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,680
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why it's thought</font>

65
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,890
to be as important of a film as it is

66
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,770
yeah say yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the graduate but</font>

67
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,090
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of films I haven't seen</font>

68
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,460
