1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,939
here in Pyongyang government officials
are strongly condemning this latest

2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,560
round of UN Security Council sanctions
using words like evil vicious calling it

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,700
a full-scale economic blockade but when
you go out on the streets and speak with

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,130
regular people they don't seem concerned
at all it's tough to find a traffic

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,159
light in Pyongyang traffic cops direct
the flow of cars the streets noticeably

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:30,949
busier each time I come here busier at
least for now the US says the latest UN

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:35,210
sanctions threatened to cut North
Korea's oil supply by nearly a third

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,790
which could spike prices for everything
from taxis to energy a ban on textile

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,440
exports and the end of foreign labor
contracts could further slash the income

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,330
of this cash starved country but if you
ask Rhee hate young she's not worried

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,300
her refreshment stand has a steady flow
of customers

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,920
she says life is improving despite round
after round of increasingly heavy

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,410
sanctions we have no problems she says
everything I'm selling is made locally

14
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,960
we don't worry we rely on ourselves Kim
hae song casually shrugs off threats

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,860
from the United States the US president
Donald Trump said that these sanctions

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,300
are just not a big deal and that there's
much worse to come

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,950
does that worry you at all we don't care
what the US president says or what the

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,150
outside world thinks about us she says
we don't worry because we believe in the

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,010
leadership of marshal Kim jong-un keep
in mind this is a very thin slice of

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,299
life in this closed country good
reporters like us can only see what the

21
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,950
government allows but all over the North
Korean capital we see plenty of new

22
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,600
construction an increasingly modern
skyline a mandate from North Korea's

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,420
leader Kim jong-un determined to prove
he can grow the economy and the nuclear

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,850
program all in the face of unprecedented
sanctions for his repeated violations of

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,700
international law
you see these posters all over Pyongyang

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,439
and they pretty much sum up North
Korea's official response to increase

27
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,239
pressure from the US more missiles North
Korean propaganda is built around their

28
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,040
nuclear program it symbolizes strength
independence it's key to their national

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,510
identity is
there anything anything at all that

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,100
could get North Korea to walk away from
its nuclear program will never give them

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,230
up says reach Hong Sun if we did it
would mean our destruction around town

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,240
new posters show a pair of hands ripping
up UN sanctions resolutions North

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,040
Korea's defiant message they will never
give up their news even if that means

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,380
life is about to get a lot harder and
that really is the bottom line North

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,000
Korea says nuclear weapons are vital to
their survival as a nation and they say

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,110
these latest UN sanctions will only
speed up not slow their development of

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,310
weapons of mass destruction threatening
to escalate an already dangerous

38
00:02:53,310 --> 00:00:00,000
situation even further I'm will Ripley
