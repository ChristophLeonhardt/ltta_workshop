were canceled after Monday he can't understand that he was doing so well and suddenly I went on in sauce zip recruiter is the smartest way to hire all right you know there's a new poll out that shows that the this projected Democrat blue wave this imaginary Democrat blue wave is suddenly receding not so much you know and then I know that the left especially the hard left that the base of the Democrat Party thinks this is because of Trump and in the evil of Trump in the corruption of Trump it's because of leftism it's because of them it's because the base of the Democrat party the problem they have you know I believe leftism is a wrong per se a wrong in and of itself I believe that it is wrong to take people's property away I believe it's wrong to curtail their freedom beyond what you need to do to protect other people's freedom I believe this leftism is morally wrong per se but the other thing about leftism is it doesn't work because it has no real sense of human nature and that means we can see in front of our eyes what happens to the places that left us control we can see leftism in operation and it's not working and it does terrible things this new poll I mean it's an amazing new poll it's released on Monday from a left-leaning news publication Reuters it showed the Democrats are paying dearly for their disastrous week last week where they lied about President Trump's comments regarding violent ms-13 gang members but it's more I think it's more than that I think that is what leftism makes them do the Reuters poll revealed that the double-digit lead that the Democrats held over Republicans last month in generic ballot voting for the 2018 midterms among registered voters is now completely gone and Republicans are now in the lead for the first time in this generic in this generic poll recent polls have also shown that Republicans could win up than nine seats in the Senate and the mall at that Millennials are leaving the Democratic Party in droves and again they think the problem is Trump but the problem is leftism we can see what it does not you know not we can see what it does turns countries into like Venezuela we can see what it does to cities like LA and San Francisco and Chicago which are now cesspits Portland because of leftism but also we can see what it does to them to human beings saying with Tommy Lehren you know Tommy Lehren is this kind of blonde good-looking firebrand on Fox and she's always you know she's a provocateur kind of in the end Coulter mode she's in a restaurant a rooftop restaurant in Minnesota and she's with her mom and dad and she suddenly somebody's just starts screaming obscenities a couple of people started screaming obscenities with her she got into it a little bit with them and as she's walking out a little video if somebody's just tossing water at Tommy and she's walking out the door and unbelievable unbelievable even worse even worse they put this out on Twitter and all these people on Twitter are going yeah that's it that's the way I would do the same thing that she has no right to hate it's 8:00 it's 8:00 let's listen to her response she was on Fox News and Tommy responded this was something that was embarrassing for me and embarrassing for my family at the end of the day I'm a person too and I do get humiliated and in Paris just like anyone else but I'm tough my family's tough we can handle it I think that those that through the water and that we're applauding and laughing about it wanted to get their 15 minutes of fame by making a video of me I think looking back those are the people that are gonna be embarrassed by their actions I think their parents raised them better and furthermore you don't have to like me you don't have to agree with my political opinions but you don't have the right to throw things at me so they put this up and a lot of people are screaming or congratulating the people who did this to her screaming the obscenities and throwing the water including Kathy Griffin who said you know it's not it's not cool it's not cool to take physical action but look what left isn't did to Kathy Griffin see we see what it does to people I'm just talking about the practicality of it I'm not even talking about the morality of leftism I'm talking about the practicality of it what it does to Venezuela countries like Venezuela and Russia what it does to cities like Chicago and San Francisco and what it does to human beings and turns them into that why why because leftism the thing about leftism is it once we know that it doesn't work we realize it's never about the problem it's about what how it makes the problem-solver feel it's about the problem so you'll notice when people start talking leftist start talking about blacks and the problems and black communities in the crime they always end up talking about whites they always end up talking about whites it's always about well it's white privilege and white policemen and white this and like that it's never about the actual people who have the problem it's always about other people and why because leftism is actually about how it makes white people feel it's not about solving problems for black people if it were just about solving problems for black people white people would be for it right we don't want problems in the black community white people that are sitting around going yeah I'd like there to be crime in Chicago you don't know nobody's thinking that nobody's thinking that so it's always about it always comes down to the white people because what it does is it makes you feel it confers on you a sense of righteousness a sense of virtue a sense that you're doing these things for people and when it doesn't work and somebody says it's not working you lose that you lose that sense of righteousness and that's why people who attacks a woman like that in a restaurant for her opinions who does that you have to be a degraded human being to do that and it's leftism that makes people degraded if you look in the mirror if you're tweeting yeah go ahead that's what I would have done look in the mirror if when a philosophy does that to you when a philosophy turns you into that change your philosophy basic rule of life change your philosophy if it turns you into that right have you have you noticed on if you go on Twitter there are I'm on a guest thousands of people who say I've taken the red pill and I used to be a liberal like me I used to be a liberal but now I'm a conservative nobody you can't find anybody who used to be a conservative and became a liberal because conservative conservatism is ennobling you know we get in a lot of arguments I'll call them arguments but they're not hostile audience we get a lot of arguments here at the Daily why're we you know Ben will see something one way and I'll see it another in Knowles we don't care what Noel's things but you know he is an opinion too and we're all into it and yelling each other but but we all change our opinions nobody ever says oh yeah you were right but we do change our opinions when we hear something yeah that's that makes sense in all this that's ennobling that is makes you grow that makes you better you are thinking remember we ought we do remember you know I started out obviously very much against Donald Trump during the primaries I haven't changed my opinion about him as a person but I see that no matter what kind of person is he's to quit a great job as president why don't I care that he's a bad person or that he's done bad things because my problem is the country that's what I'm I care about I'm not here about myself I'm not here to feel righteous I'm not here to feel like a good person I'm a Christian I already know I'm not a good person I already know I suck right that comes comes with the religion that's the first the first thing on the religion I did not a lot of people know that's they think it's like you know we believe in one God or something like that no it's oh I suck that's the first thing it said so so I don't have that sense of righteousness and it and conservativism also makes the world better you know what I'm saying here is that it's not about people and this is another thing that leftism does to people it makes the because the actual ideas don't work they have to glorify the human beings we don't have to do that I can say to you you know I don't really like Donald Trump very much as a human being I can say that because we agree that the point is the principle the point is the country the thing that we want is the freedom the freedom is going to be here after Donald Trump is gone it was here before Trump got here it'll be here after he's gone it's the freedom we're trying to preserve this unique idea that we the individual is really what the government is about it's not about the government so do you remember when Obama I brought a couple of things god prizes like show-and-tell I brought a couple of things into work just to remind you of what it was like when Obama was running for president and it was like the second coming right they had that thing this thing actually turned my stomach and not because of these poor children it's not their fault but where they had these little kids come out and sing the Obama song play this again we're gonna change the world so I mean to me using children like that for a political candidate and convincing them that their ideals are connected to this human being I mean one of the things the Bible says is put not your faith in Princes or in any human being that cannot save you you know to teach these children that their ideals which are good you know freedom and a better world and all these things all kids should be believe in those things but to teach them that their ideals are tied to a human being you know who else thought this Obama thought it you know we have we haven't cut number nine just remember this speech that he made after he won and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick the ocean began to flow and our planet began to heal you know the New York Times a former newspaper has a story today deep in the desert Iran quietly is advancing its missile technology and I thought I read that I thought but that can't be right because that would mean that Barack Obama was a gormless buffoon you didn't know what he was doing he didn't know what he was doing and he was a leftist and leftism doesn't work and so they're there they're furious it corrupted the press as they protected him from the truth you know when you when you when your enemy is reality the price of the battle is your soul you lose your soul because you're fighting reality you have to accept reality first I mean it's one of the reasons like I don't really like the welfare state but I think the welfare state has helped to preserve capitalism and so I think all right a little bit of welfare state we got to cut it back and keep it down but it's but it's actually worked against the the logic of socialism that actually saved capitalism from socialism okay I'll make that compromise I'm not you know I'm not an a an absolutist in any way but think guys you know the base of the Democrat Party is saying to the Democrats resist resist resist Trump Trump Trump but really what they should be resisting is the base of the Democrat Party because they're the problem they make it easy on Trump you know Trump went to Planned Parenthood gave a speech at Planned Parenthood I think was yesterday and maybe the day before but he's he's cutting back you know the there's this title ax title 10 family planning program which was established to send government funds to family planning agencies but not to fund abortion but it goes to Planned Parenthood because they pretend they have other family planning roles instead of abortion which is very dubious assertion but they say they do and they say well this money doesn't go to fund our abortions but of course money is fungible right you it doesn't matter if you give it to me here I can use it there I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna spend that money there how do you know which dollar it is that's going into this stuff so Trump is saying we're gonna cut this back and of course this is I think this is a tremendous thing and he goes out and he starts to rip on the Democrats at this speech before Planned Parenthood he's he's celebrating the fact which is true that this is a very anti-abortion a pro-life administration and he goes after the Democrats on abortion listen to what he says it's cut number three the house just passed the bill but Democrats in the Senate are doing everything within their power to block it although some are actually on our side but they are working overtime to block it so the story is 18 midterms we need Republicans and that will happen on this issue like so many other issues the Democratic Party is far outside the American mainstream far outside the United States is one of only seven countries in the world to allow elective abortions after 20 weeks when unborn babies can truly feel the pain yet Democratic senators like John tester Heidi Heitkamp Claire McCaskill debbie Stabenow all voted against the 20-week bill and in favor of late term abortion see we're talking about this is so brilliant because the all the press does is try to make people feel that that's not amazing but what he's saying is not mainstream and he's turning it on his head the thing is now we can see what leftism turns people into at 18 weeks at 18 weeks with them you know with those what are they called ultrasound things you can see a baby in the womb smiling you can see it clapping you can see it's sucking its thumb okay 20 weeks he's right 20 weeks a baby feels the pain when you murder it when he when he was fascinated so you know what kind of person supports that what kind of person you know it's kind of like the thing with the ms-13 people where they're sitting around talking about the spark of divinity in a ms-13 gang member and you think like what what kind of person is is doing that and part of that is just reaction to Trump but part of it is leftism failing and making people defend the failure that makes them defend the failure the rule of law I mean this is so basic the rule of law just just saying hey we make the laws and then we have to obey the laws if we don't like the laws we change the laws you know Thomas Holman who's the acting director of ice you know the Immigration and Customs Enforcement he goes up before Congress and from California one of our own or the lovely rep congresswoman Nanette beragon she caused them anti-immigrant she says you're the Isis anti-immigrant listen to what Thomas Holman says because I've been making this point for a long time first of all no one on this panel is anti-immigrant we're law enforcement officers when forcing law that you all enacted so to sit there and say we're anti immigrants is wrong we are enforcing laws if you think it's okay to enter this country legally shouldn't be arrested that's just wrong that lost clearly state and you enter the country legally it's a crime and no one's up here saying all criminal illegal aliens are criminals a certain percentage of our criminal take they commit yet another fence actually here I've said many times I certainly understand the plight of these people and I feel bad for some of these people but I have a job to do I have to enforce a law and uphold the oath I took to enact the laws enacted by you Congress see that virtue signaling that thing that leftism gives you the sense of righteousness and virtue falls apart when you look at the logic of the fact that they passed the laws and now they're telling us oh yeah wait you don't want to pay that one it's only the laws that make us feel good about ourselves that we should obey change the law go in and change the law make your arguments go before the people you're the people's representatives change the law you know we went through this in the 70s say I'm sure net you know most of you don't remember this but we went through this in the 70s when our cities became cesspits and what crime skyrocketed and you know the the the streets were filthy and people were aligned and it's it's going to happen again we can see it happening again in cities like San Francisco I have friends who just got back from Portland Oregon they said they now have a right to rest law where you can sleep on the verge beside the sidewalk so outside your home is a homeless guy sleeping on the street that's what New York used to look like during the leftist 70s we saw it already we can see it with our own eyes this is the problem they have that's why their press is so important because they think they can cover it up but they can't cover it up forever and they can't cover it up if the president is talking about it we can see with our eyes what leftism is we don't like it and that's the problem they have in the midterms it's not Donald Trump it's not they're not resisting enough they're not they're normalizing Donald Trump it's none of that it's their base believing in the principles that cause cities and countries and human beings to become degraded you know I have to talk about Starbucks for them in a Starbucks nation I think like I think that we've becoming Starbucks nation I I'm not going to Starbucks anymore and I'm not boycotting them I love Starbucks I'd mean Starbucks coffee I always thought it was great it's stronger you know I love really strong coffee only my wife makes the coffee I like it outside a Starbucks she really I don't know what it's that magic wife Dutch she has but but but partly it's her coffee as the old joke goes you could the spoon stands up on it in her coffee the spoon doesn't only stand up it kind of doesn't dance it goes like oh I feel good it's good to be in this coffee because it's so strong in Starbucks coffee is strong like European coffee I used to love coffee in Europe they come over here and they think our coffee tastes like water with a little ground in it you know that's it and I'd like that European cause I like Starbucks coffee I'm not going in there anymore until they straighten themselves out Starbucks is not a bigoted company Starbucks is not a racist company there's nothing racist about Starbucks at all not a thing nada nothing but they bought into this thing they got played by a couple of guys who came in and sat there and tried to use their bathroom didn't buy anything refused to buy anything refused to leave when the police told them to leave refused to leave when the police told them to leave they weren't buying anything they were violating store rules and they refused to leave and that's my problem that's a race problem that's not a race problem that's a loitering problem that's a trespass problem so the first thing star but and Starbucks of course has been apologizing oh okay now everybody can use any drug dealer who wants to come in and use it you know Cohen smoke drink but now they're saying well you know you can't do that and you can't use drugs and you can't so now they're gonna please snap but they're but the underlying there's two problems here with that really have turned me against Starbucks one is that they accepted this kind of bullying they didn't just say hey are you kidding me we hire all kinds of people we serve all kinds of people we don't have a problem the problem was these two guys that was the problem they didn't have the nerve they didn't have the nerve because they live in that leftist universe where anytime somebody says racist you're supposed to fall over and cower and curl up in the in this in the corner and say oh my gosh you know please beat me you know beat me like it's just like a Stalin show trial that you're supposed to come out with the sign I apologize and all this stuff they didn't stand up for themselves that's the first thing but the second thing is they they have accepted the underlying idea that business is bad the reason you have to buy something when you go into a Starbucks or should have to buy something before you can use their facilities it's because they are a business they're not just a meeting place like one of these clowns said they're not just like some you know the the third way of getting together a place we can sit together they're a business they make their living doing this and the thing about capitalism I mean we're talking about this this vault the virtue signaling and the thing about capitalism is it doesn't give you a lot of chance to virtuous signal because capitalism uses our natural greed and ambition so that it serves other people in capitalism if I obey the law and I want to get rich and I want to have my ambitions I got to do something that you like like give you a cup of coffee you're willing to overpay for it because Starbucks is overpriced but the coffee is so good and the place is so nice that you pay the over price for that you pay it for the experience but there's no virtuous signaling in that you have to choose to be good under capitalism you have to choose to say yeah I made a lot of money and I'm gonna give some of it here and most of these guys do most of these billionaires they they get plenty of money away most millionaires give plenty of money away capitalism does have a lot of charity in it but its individual charity it's not enforced charity like socialism so people don't like capitalism because it doesn't make them feel good because they're not forcing other people to give money away you have to have your own righteousness you have to do it so but they accepted was that there was something inherently wrong in there being a business they not only accepted this baloney of this race mongering bow which I just is appalling to me I don't know why every business doesn't do a chick-fil-a didn't stand up for their right to have their own beliefs and the right to have their own world and their the way they run their business but they accepted the idea that it was wrong that they were a business this is the the Silicon Valley syndrome we're changing the world you know it's we're not just we're not just inventing iPhones we're changing the world you know how you changing the world you invent an iPhone and you make billions of dollars for it and the world is a better place because we we chose your iPhone because it made our world better that's why we gave you the money for it they accepted this notion that they were somehow just the friendly face and it wasn't friendly if you had to pay you have to pay because it's a business you have to pay cuz that's how they make their living and it just I just find it appalling that they let this happen and we say you know again we see you we see the world of the left we see it eating its own we see it taking an innocent company like Starbucks which is just selling an overpriced cup of coffee in a nice place and being it we see them being accused of racism and that they have to fall to their knees like somebody at a stalinist show trial that to me is just appalling and it's appalling they fell for it and I ain't going in there until they knock it off and I'm I don't I don't think I'll ever go back in there unless they they actually turn around which is very unlikely all right we got the mailbag coming up and you know what that means your problems are minutes away from being solved but we've got to say goodbye to

right never mind from tomorrow they've got some very intense personal ones this time so would literature we're gonna read these from tomorrow hello great and wise man I guess it's to you Robin no no it's having I'm having a difficult time in my marriage due to my husband's tendency to tear a strip off me whenever some little thing goes wrong that means criticized or an attacker granted he does a lot and is an incredibly hard worker and a great father to our three boys he has a high-pressure lifestyle full of work and balancing the kids schedule as do I I'm a stay-at-home mom however I'm his emotional punching bag and I believe I'm taking for granted since we don't believe in divorce I grew up without a dad and was hell-bent on doing life properly when it came to my own children but I find myself increasingly saddened and jaded at the state of our marriage and looking at apartments and divorce lawyers online I'm no pushover I stand up for myself but I'm exhausted having to stand up for myself my boys are unfortunately watching us fight too my husband can't understand why I would rather watch a million episodes of the Michael Noel's show and never have sex with him that is bad things were really going wrong here in this valley even one episode would be it would be too much he keeps telling me the problem is that I can't forgive when forgive is all I have done for the past 15 years of our marriage I think the problem is I have no more trust in him or faith that he'll ever be good to me I need to know how to get through to him as I really am growing tired of all the berating and belittling I'm being subjected to I really did not sign up for that in my life when I decided to get married first of all obviously when I get a letter I only know what you tell me in the letter and I'm going to take it at face value but but I also think there are two sides to every story and you do want to look at yourself and just say okay where's where's my contribution in this you know am I am I making a contribution maybe or not I don't know I'm just gonna but I'm gonna take your email at face value and just assume that you are in the right first if that's the case if he is really being this hyper critical of you and for and taking everything out on you I have to challenge your assertion that he's being a great father to your three boys your three boys are not seeing how to treat a lady and how to treat a wife and how to cherish somebody and the most important thing a father can do is create a world of respect and love in the household and you can't do that if you're constantly you know pounding on your wife and picking on or whether you're working hard or not doesn't matter it doesn't matter whether you're working hard if you have three boys and I assume if you've been married 15 years then they're all still at home and they're all still pretty young divorce is a very very serious thing it's going to shatter their world is going to be a big deal however you do not have to be abused and that is that's what's happening taking your letter at face value you are being abused that is abuse it's emotionally abusive and it's wrong and there's no excuse that's that's it so here is what I would suggest the one thing you do not want to do is threaten divorce and not mean it and the one thing you want to do not want to do is go through with the divorce before you have tried every possible thing you can to fix this situation so what I would do in your situation is this I would first come to a decision do I mean it do I am I ready to leave am I going to go will I do it because there's no bluffing about this if you Bluff you only make the situation worse if you come to the decision that you are ready to leave that you're ready to go then I would go to my husband and say to him here's the deal here's the deal I'm I'm ready to leave I cannot do this anymore you have hurt me too badly I'm ready to get a divorce but I would happily save this marriage with you if you will come into couples counseling with me I will happily save it if you will come into couples counseling with me but if you will not I'm leaving if he will not you got to go there's no bluffing about this because if your bluff you just make it worse it just goes on and on and on forever okay but if he will say if he says as I hope he will cuz I by the way a lot of husbands this is just true a lot of husbands don't take this situation seriously until the wife actually walks out and then they're shocked they're absolutely shocked this happens again and again the husband suddenly says why what happened she says I've been telling you for 10 years that you've been abusing me yeah but you didn't say we were gonna leave so if he says which I hope and believe he will he says yes I will go into a couple therapy then put all your money on it you know really do it you got to really go into it you got to let find a good therapist listen to what he or she tells you you know work together to patch this marriage up for the sake of your children it doesn't have to be Cinderella it doesn't have to be a romance but it can't be abusive right because these children need their parents they need both their mom they need both their dad if if possible they need them in the same house treating each other with love and respect and you know obviously in the case of sex if you're denying sex as a weapon you can't do that but I can see why you wouldn't want to have sex with someone who's abusing you've got to solve this problem for your kids sake you really do and so if you actually mean it and you're ready to go tell your husband you're ready to go but you're willing to work it out and then work it out all right from Amanda to the wise mr. Clavin my question for you today concerns depression and motivation hopefully this isn't too similar to past questions regarding this I was diagnosed with serious depression a few years ago and a thankfully come a long way since then with the help of therapy and meds but I still feel like I'm dragging my heels I can't help but feel impatient about the fact that my health is not where it once was and that I want to move forward with my life but whenever I know I should be doing something productive to achieve that I can't find the motivation to actually get on with it even if it's just going out for a walk on a nice day or picking up a book I'm starting a full-time program again at University and I'm worried that if I don't start working on my mental stamina more I'll run the risk of burning myself out once in school do you have any advice on how you kept up with your depression maintenance once you start to feel better and how did you motivate yourself to do things even when you felt that you may not have had the energy Cheers Amanda okay again I'm taking it at face value when you say that you have felt better due to therapy and meds I'm assuming that you remained in therapy because one of my bugbears about this is you know I understand that some people do need meds I get it I think they're way way over prescribed I mean incredibly over prescribed but I do think that they that some people need them but they're supposed to be to prop you up so you have the energy to go into therapy and you should continue to go into therapy because depression doesn't hit you out of the blue in 99% of the cases it is due to something in your past and things in your past is not being able to work out so I hope you're still in therapy let me know assuming that let me just address the actual question because this is a real deal how do you how do you build discipline first you got to understand there is no doing it without doing it it altum Utley comes down to you there is no like oh I don't have the energy you got to do it and and so if and and if you fail to do it you got to do it I go back into doing it you know don't say oh I failed now I'm not doing it anymore go back to doing it if you're trying to do something so uh you know I I'm a very disciplined person and I've built my discipline over time but there are always things we have to work on I always keep my drinking in check because I love alcohol but I don't like being a drunk I don't like drinking you know I don't like mean I don't like being drunk at all and so you know I have to be careful don't step over the line don't step over the line and I do it in certain ways here is my technique and if it works for you great first let's decide what you want to accomplish and then do less than you think you can so there's two things you got to do when you're depressed one is you got to get exercise and the other is you got to associate with other people you got to do something be in a book group be in a church group and go out and feed the homeless with other people something that's going to bring you into contact and conversation with other people and you got to get exercise those are the two things that really really will help you out of your depression so if it's a card game I don't care what it is don't have to have any moral content it's a card game once a week or a church group once a week or something once a week the other thing is you got to get get exercise so the first thing you do is you you set a goal that's lower than you can achieve if you think you maybe can run for 15 minutes every day run for five run for seven you know run for less than that and do it every day or whatever whatever goal you set for yourself then as you get the discipline to do it and you know you're gonna do it after say a month or two months or three months then start to increase it just a little bit a little bit each time don't push it to the point where you can't do it anymore just keep the discipline going just keep building on what you do but don't stop doing it you know if that's all it do less than you can do okay the other thing with this and and again you know if you want to go out for three days and associate with people go out for one day you got to do this these are the two things you got to get exercise you got to associate with other people the other thing is try to develop a mindset that's positive right like when you're trying to eat less don't think about eating less think about how good you're gonna look think about how healthy you feel think about how you feel how your digestion is better you know if you drink a little you sleep better you can you wake up in the middle of night cuz I don't sleep very much anyway I can read and my mind is clear those are the things I think about I don't think don't drink so much you know I think like oh yeah if I do this then bad things are gonna happen so think about the positive things that you're developing and if you do that you know if you if you get out and you get exercise and you associate with other people and you do some therapy I I think you can beat depression even without the meds don't you know I'm not a doctor don't go off meds because I say so but I think that the important thing should be making your life whole making yourself whole okay from Evan dear professor Eck's the daily wire is it from the x-men as a professor with some so many books and movies making their way to Broadway which one of your literary works could you see as a musical that's pretty funny you know because I write crime stories there wouldn't be a musical but I've always I have this one book called man and wife which is the book I always recommend to women who don't like don't like bloody criminal stories and I always thought it would make a good opera or operetta you know it's very dramatic very has very big characters but in a very domestic and dramatic situation it reminds me there's a one called the seance on a wet afternoon that's been made into an opera and Henry James's turn of the screw has been made into an opera and I've always thought man and wife would make a good opera or operetta alright from Ashley hi mr. Clavin aka drinker of leftist ears I could really use your guaranteed correct thoughts on the following question that I've been struggling with I used to want to go into teaching psychology and conducting research and universities I know universities are losing to the radical left and that the field of psychology is being consumed by social justice warriors too true but I feel guilty walking away from the training of those who will be responsible for the mental health of future generations I'm not sure when to keep fighting or when to walk away and could use some advice thank you in advance Ashley he wanted to teach psych I got it you know firstly you should never stop fighting never stop fighting I mean they're wrong we're they're they're wrong I mean that is the thing they're wrong we're right and psychology is an important field that you can be very helpful as a psychologist you know I think what I would do in your situation and you're absolutely right about the psychological field that is filled with social justice warriors and you do not want to give them any quarter whatsoever because it's harmful to people's psychology not helpful to do social justice war what I would do is I would build a career that wasn't dependent on them and you might do it by doing but I guess it's called clinical work I mean I would see clients I would see I would do therapy and once you do therapy and you're building a successful career with that you can start to write about it you can write a column even a blog you can start to write about that then you can start to teach you can start the lecture you can start to go places and that way you don't have to be beholden to the university now there are universities that are not as taken over by the left I mean we we hear about the ones that are because so many big ones are but there are universities where they still hire you so you can try them too but you know being a psychologist is something you can do on your own it's something you can build your own career with and once you do that you can then use the authority you get from your successful career to become a voice against what they're saying and that way they can't stop you and that way you can actually be open and start to teach people through other means without actually standing in a class that's what I would do because you shouldn't stop fighting it's an important fight it really is so I got a lot of emails about Devin new news or new knees name and how it wasn't funny and a lot of them were lovely and just explained your point of view and thank you very much and I hear it I'm not here to annoy you I'm really not I'm just I just loved kidding around I have a big crazy sense of humor and I use it and it comes out in Devon Nunez name some of them were enraged enraged my ROI is that unfair though it's true if some of them were enraged and all I can say about that is if you're enraged about me saying Devon knew knew no no you're too enraged that's too angry you don't want to be that angry you're a conservative you should be full of joy you should believe in God you should have God in your life you should have freedom in your life we're winning we're winning it doesn't matter if I make sure you should be you should be happy but I do I do have to play this piece about because there's a lot of people just said Oh their joke was getting old and I get that I you know the thing is yeah I I always berate myself for not sticking with running gags cuz I like a running gag but I get tired I get tired of them I get tired of just about anything doing it too often so I use Kofi fee for a long time I've calf EFI and I felt like then I stopped and nolé stolid he's so you know I can't I can't leave these jokes lying around because it he takes but but I mean III do let my running gags die after a time but this cracked me up but then I saw Chuck Schumer making the speech and he's attacking Devin whatever his name is and listen to what he says while an investigation is open and active demands for oversight are tantamount to interference especially when the folks demanding the information are the most biased irresponsible actors a man like Devin Nunez Chuck Schumer is a mean matter what but Devin Nunez it and then people sell me well its newness and then somebody else there is other people so you knew net it's not just me it's nice anyway it strikes me as funny I won't do it if it's gonna drive you crazy but if it drives you crazy you should think about why it's so crazy we're just kidding around we are just kidding around and having a good time all right tickety-boo news so what Trump and Mitch Michael Pence are doing in this abortion fight is great it genuinely is great that that we now have as Trump himself said we now have a pro-life president of pearl-like vice president of pro-life Congress and obviously they're up against roe v wade but they are doing wonderful things and just the fact that they're reminding us that they are in the mainstream that people do see you note when we talk about that 20 week old baby but that's five months that's five months old but also great also tickety-boo is the fact that science is really on our side and is more and more you know that you know Thomas Aquinas one of the greatest minds in the West at ever I believe I add I didn't refresh my memory on this but I'm pretty sure that he said that abortion was allowed until what's called the quickening when you could hear the baby move and a lot of people say well Thomas Aquinas have you know a father of the church said you could wait till the quickening but of course he didn't have ultrasound an ultrasound and all these scans and all this that are showing us these babies laughing and clapping their hands and sucking their thumbs in the womb are really helping us change people's intuitive mind and I've said this before but the same people who are tearing down same kind of people who are tearing down robert e lee's statue in this generation are going to be tearing down nancy pelosi statue in the next generation when they really becomes clear what a baby is and how how much it is now now personally i think the DNA is dispositive i think the fact that you can be convicted of a crime on the basis of DNA shows that DNA identifies you as an individual and it's unique to you the baby's DNA is unique and i keep hearing this argument that that well it's not fair to force this woman to carry a life to term and there is this argument about this famous violinist if you heard this that's alright this is a big argument and somebody tweeted me and said what's the answer to this argument it's by I think it was originated by a woman named Judith Jarvis Thompson she says I propose that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception how does the argument go from here something like this I take it every person has a right to life so the fetus has a right to life you wake here's her proposition you wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist a famous unconscious violinist he's been found to have fatal kidney ailment and the Society of music lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help they have therefore kidnapped you and last night the violin a circulatory system was plugged into yours so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own the director of the hospital now tells you look we're sorry the Society of music lovers did this to you we would never have permitted it if we had known but still they did it and the violinist now is plugged into you to unplug you would be to kill him but never mind it's only for nine months by then he will have recovered from this ailment and can safely be unplugged from you do you have the right to pull away and let the violinist die which obviously I think you do if people say wow wow that's I read this on philosophical website what a great argument now it's not a good argument it's what it's what's called I believe it's what's called am NOT a philosopher but I believe it's what's called a category error it is taking one category of and comparing it to another category of thing and expecting them to correlate in terms of moral arguments or any kind of arguments the woman grants that the fetus is alive that the fetus is a person right if the fetus is a person then the woman is a mother and the fetus is her child that is the relationship there and it's a unique relationship there is no other relationship with mother and child and we acknowledge that mothers have a responsibility to their children if the child could only thrive on breast milk the mother would not be allowed to walk away from that child and not feed him or her the breast milk because that would be because it's her child it is her child and we also know that the child didn't just appear there that woman had took an action and had sex and that created the child so the only way you could connect that would be through a rape but still even though that's that's a rape that causes a pregnancy is a tremendous injustice a tremendous crime it's a tremendous crime but the criminal is not the baby the criminal is the criminal is the rapist right so it's still a mother with the child it's a totally different and unique category and she does have a responsibility to keep that child alive you know the thing is once the the reason they don't want to accept this of course is because of the freedom of the woman which I'm very in favor of I want her to be free but I don't want her to be free at the cost of somebody else's life but if they start to accept if science forces us to accept the uniqueness the individuality the humanity of the child we're going to have to reconsider our attitudes towards sex and you know what that's going to be a good thing for everybody because right at this minute our attitudes toward sex are so broken and it's hurting so many people especially young women and so when young women start to reconsider what sex is what it's there for what it means and what it does to them I think that that's going to be a good thing rather than oh I created a human let's kill it and go back to having sex I think that is a good thing I think it's happening I think it will happen because I think the science is ultimately irrefutable we have a great interview tomorrow with Mike Rowe isn't oh yeah good really good interview with the great Mike
