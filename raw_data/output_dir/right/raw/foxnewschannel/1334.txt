1
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:02,641
BORDER.

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,608
A LIVE REPORT FROM ISRAEL

3
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:06,445
COMING UP IN OUR NEXT HOUR.

4
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:06,878
ANXIOUSLY?

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:08,613
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, PETE.

6
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:09,715
TENNESSEE VOTERS TURNING UP

7
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:11,116
IN DROVES TO THE RALLY LAST

8
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:11,416
NIGHT.

9
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:12,451
PRESIDENT TRUMP STILL HAD A

10
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,319
STRONG WARNING.

11
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:19,391
>> IN NOVEMBER, WE WILL

12
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,593
REVERSE A TREND.

13
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,628
WHEN YOU WIN THE PRESIDENCY,

14
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:25,197
FOR SOME REASON, YOU ALWAYS

15
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:27,899
END UP LOSING THE HOUSE.

16
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,368
YOU GET COMPLACENT.

17
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:30,102
YOU WIN.

18
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:34,072
AND NOW YOU SIT BACK AND YOU

19
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:34,373
RELAX.

20
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:35,340
THAT'S THE WORST THING THAT

21
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,941
CAN HAPPEN.

22
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,376
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU HAVE

23
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,211
ANOTHER ELECTION.

24
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,579
AINSLEY: WHO SHOULD BE MORE

25
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:41,413
WORRIED HEADED INTO THE MID

26
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:42,814
TERMS IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS?

27
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:45,751
HERE TO DEBATE IS G.O.P.

28
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,620
POLSTER JUSTIN WALLEN AND

29
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,321
JOEL PAIN.

30
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:51,456
JUSTIN, I WILL START WITH

31
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,723
YOU.

32
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:53,191
DEMOCRATS NEED TO FLIP 23

33
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:53,558
SEAT.

34
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:54,826
EXPERTS ARE SAYING THEY

35
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:55,927
PREDICT THEY WILL FLIP

36
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:57,596
ANYWHERE BETWEEN 25 AND 40

37
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:57,896
SEATS.

38
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:58,663
KNOWING THAT INFORMATION,

39
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:00,966
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY TOUGH.

40
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,167
WHAT DO REPUBLICANS NEED TO

41
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:02,434
DO?

42
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:03,935
>> THIS ELECTION, JUST LIKE

43
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:04,903
PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER IS

44
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:05,670
ABOUT ISSUES.

45
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,572
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT

46
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:08,006
PERSONALITIES.

47
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,408
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

48
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:10,609
MISSTEPS THAT COULD HAPPEN

49
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,843
ON EITHER THE DEMOCRATIC OR

50
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,078
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.

51
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:14,379
I TEND TO SEE IT A LITTLE

52
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,547
BIT MORE ON THE DEMOCRATIC

53
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:15,847
SIDE.

54
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:17,349
I DON'T SEE THE MESSAGING OR

55
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,617
THE THEMES QUITE AS STRONG

56
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:20,852
WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE STRONG

57
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:22,320
IS THERE WERE TWO HUGE

58
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,422
ISSUES LAST YEAR THAT NEED

59
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:24,389
TO BE PUSHED FORWARD.

60
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:25,457
ONE WAS TAX REFORM.

61
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,059
THE OTHER WAS HEALTHCARE

62
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:27,559
REFORM.

63
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,760
FAILED WITH HEALTHCARE

64
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,194
REFORM.

65
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:30,495
SUCCEEDED WITH TAX REFORM.

66
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:31,997
AND THE THIRD ISSUE, WHICH

67
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:33,331
IS MUCH SMALLER IS

68
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:33,799
INFRASTRUCTURE.

69
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,499
IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE

70
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:35,934
WITH THAT AT LEAST

71
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,169
REPUBLICANS CAN CLAIM

72
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:37,536
OWNERSHIP.

73
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,104
OWNERSHIP IS BIG RIGHT NOW.

74
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:40,172
ACTION IS IMPORTANT.

75
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:41,473
WE NEED TO SEE THAT IN ORDER

76
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,308
FOR REPUBLICANS TO HAVE A

77
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:44,876
CHANCE TO BUCK THE

78
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,312
HISTORICAL TREND OF MID

79
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:47,679
TERMS.

80
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:48,346
AINSLEY: JOEL, WHAT DO YOU

81
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:49,815
THINK THE REASON IS FOR

82
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:50,682
DEMOCRATS -- IT LOOKS LIKE

83
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,050
IT'S IN FAVOR OF THE

84
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,417
DEMOCRATS.

85
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,351
DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE THE

86
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:53,652
HOUSE.

87
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:54,853
WHEN YOU HAVE NANCY PELOSI

88
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:55,687
SAYING I WANT TO INCREASE

89
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,289
YOUR TAXES, I WANT OPEN

90
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,658
BORDERS AND SUPPORTING MS-13

91
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:01,026
BACKING THEM, HOW DO THE

92
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:02,094
DEMOCRATS WIN WITH THAT

93
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:02,427
MESSAGE?

94
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:03,829
>> THAT'S A NONSENSE WAY TO

95
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,131
LAY OUT THE DEMOCRATIC

96
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:06,531
AGENDA.

97
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,199
AINSLEY: CORRECT ME THEN.

98
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,100
HOW DO YOU LAY IT OUT.

99
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,601
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

100
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,368
AINSLEY: THAT IS TRUE.

101
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:11,036
SHE HAS SAID THAT.

102
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:11,903
>> THAT'S NOT.

103
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:13,772
BUT WE CAN AGREE TO

104
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:14,206
DISAGREE.

105
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:14,673
AINSLEY: OKAY.

106
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:15,807
>> THE PRESIDENT IT'S VERY

107
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:16,875
INTERESTING THAT HE WAS EVEN

108
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:17,809
IN TENNESSEE LAST NIGHT.

109
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,044
I HAVE WORKED IN POLITICS.

110
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,179
I WORKED FOR THE FORMER

111
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,114
MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID.

112
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:23,281
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE

113
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,050
EVEN IN TENNESSEE AS A

114
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,685
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHAT,

115
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:27,919
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE

116
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,753
ELECTION DAY DEFENDING A

117
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:29,888
SEAT THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER

118
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,357
HAVE TO DEFEND, A STATE THAT

119
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:33,892
THE PRESIDENT WON WITH OVER

120
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,193
60% OF THE VOTE IN 2016,

121
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,495
THAT SHOWS YOU HOW WEAK IS

122
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:37,395
HE IN TENNESSEE.

123
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,365
THAT SHOWS YOU HOW

124
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:41,166
RUTTERLESS THE REPUBLICAN

125
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:41,800
ESTABLISHMENT IS IN

126
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,400
TENNESSEE BECAUSE THE

127
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,435
PRESIDENT HAS PUT THEM IN

128
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:44,102
THAT POSITION.

129
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:45,804
BECAUSE IS HE FAILING IN

130
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:47,038
TRUMP COUNTRY.

131
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,507
REPUBLICANS ARE RUN AWAY

132
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,741
FROM HIM.

133
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,609
MARSHA BLACKBURN IS GOING TO

134
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:52,544
HAVE TO CLING ON -- HOLD ON

135
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,745
FOR DEAR LIFE TO HOLD ON TO

136
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:54,246
THAT SEAT.

137
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:55,380
I THINK THAT'S THE BIG STORY

138
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,648
FROM LAST NIGHT THAT THE

139
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:57,782
PRESIDENT EVEN HAD TO DEFEND

140
00:02:57,782 --> 00:02:59,284
THAT SEAT IN TENNESSEE LAST

141
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,118
NIGHT.

142
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:01,653
THAT'S "THE BIG STORY."

143
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:02,187
AINSLEY: WELL, EVERY

144
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:03,488
PRESIDENT HAS DONE, THIS

145
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,589
RIGHT, JUSTIN?

146
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:05,490
EVERY PRESIDENT GOES INTO

147
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,558
AREAS WHERE THE RACES ARE

148
00:03:06,558 --> 00:03:07,859
TIGHT TO TRY TO RALLY THE

149
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:08,193
TROOPS?

150
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:08,994
>> YEAH.

151
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:09,294
SURE.

152
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,295
ONE OF THE FUNNY THINGS

153
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:10,996
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

154
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:12,697
SAID LAST NIGHT IS WHO IS

155
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:13,365
THE OPPONENT?

156
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,233
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

157
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,301
SUCCESSFUL GOVERNOR OF

158
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:16,668
TENNESSEE.

159
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:18,770
I MEAN, IF THE DEMOCRATIC

160
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,038
PARTY WAS GOING TO PULL

161
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,072
TOGETHER THE RIGHT CANDIDATE

162
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:22,574
FOR THIS RACE THAT'S THE

163
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:22,941
CANDIDATE.

164
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,309
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S TIGHT.

165
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,379
IT'S NOT BECAUSE TRUMP IS

166
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,947
LOSING SUPPORT IN ANY

167
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:29,881
MEANINGFUL WAY FOR

168
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:30,282
REPUBLICANS.

169
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:34,286
I MEAN, THIS IS MARSHA

170
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:34,920
BLACKBURN NOT NECESSARILY

171
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,887
ABOUT TRUMP.

172
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:37,355
>> HIS NUMBERS ARE DOWN BY

173
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:37,822
10 POINTS.

174
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,424
>> ACTUALLY THEY HAVE BEEN

175
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:40,992
CONTRACTING EVER SINCE FALL.

176
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,160
HE IS UPSIDE DOWN.

177
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,962
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT PRETENDING

178
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:44,429
ABOUT ANYTHING.

179
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:45,664
IS HE UPSIDE DOWN.

180
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:46,998
BUT THEY ARE CONTRACTING.

181
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,967
AND TRUMP IS SEEN AS, YOU

182
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,834
KNOW, RELATIVELY

183
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:50,235
INDEPENDENT.

184
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:52,337
HE IS NOT NECESSARILY FULLY

185
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:53,738
TIED TO THE REPUBLICAN

186
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:54,039
PARTY.

187
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,407
THIS CAN BE A GOOD THING AND

188
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,409
IT CAN BE A BAD THING.

189
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,109
AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT I

190
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,277
SAID EARLIER STILL STANDS.

191
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:00,378
IT'S ABOUT ISSUES.

192
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:03,215
AND IF BLACKBURN OWNS THE

193
00:04:03,215 --> 00:00:00,000
ISSUES THAT MATTER TO
