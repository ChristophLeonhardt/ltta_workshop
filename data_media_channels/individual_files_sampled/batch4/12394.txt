my first question what is the secret of the art of the insult Donald Trump's secret of course I guess it starts with some New York hutzpah that he's willing to stand his ground and with that he comes up with branding of his opponents people forget that Donald Trump was in the entertainment business for thirty years they think of him as a real estate guy right but he was doing a professional wrestling pro boxing Miss America Miss Universe of course The Apprentice he owned a USFL football team so he has seen and done it all when it came to marketing and hype and being in New York he knew how to manipulate the media very easily so he came up with his brand names for his opponents and they were so effective because they had a little mix of truth and humor the first one that most people remember that was so effective was of course low energy Jeb it killed him it totally destroyed jeb Bush's presidential yeah I mean 120 million dollars in the bank and Trump came along with a marketing concept called Low Energy and he had very little money he had this massive office in Trump Tower with three guys in it and he would fly around in the you know Trump airplane and landed these hangars on this Trump Appaloosa tour and you'd have 20,000 people waiting five six seven times a day and he'd go into this hilarious performance art where he'd mimic and imitate the people that he was branding and it was so entertaining and so much fun he was able to use this performance art in combination with the branding to just destroy his opponents and the the media just fell right into it one of the funniest things I would always you could just tell that the protesters would come to protest they say we're gonna stop Donald Trump we're gonna embarrass him and you know we're gonna make him look bad and as soon as they would start protesting he would suddenly smile he'd say look looked at the protesters and they didn't realize that they were the ones that were drawing all the media right to Trump's events so he got two billion dollars in free earned media just by manipulating everybody who is masterful
