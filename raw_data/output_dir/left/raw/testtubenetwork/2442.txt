00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,700
The First Amendment. It gives us the right
to say whatever we want without being locked

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,000
up for

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,720
the crime of talking, right?

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,150
But wait – what about that troll who posts
fake and harassing stuff about you online?

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,460
Should he

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,830
be locked up? When does being annoying actually
become illegal?

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,169
The answer is “that depends”.

8
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:25,710
Let’s say there are three holes: Hole A,
Hole B, and Hole C. Each represents a different

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,289
person:

10
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:32,229
A-hole is the jerk. He's verbally attacking
our victim, Hole B, who we’ll call Steve.

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,539
And Hole C is

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,510
“the reasonable man”. That’s an actual
legal term for how the community thinks a

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,329
reasonable

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,850
person would act in the same situation.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,989
Under the First Amendment, A-hole has the
right to free speech. That is, until those

16
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:46,320
rights

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,660
infringe on someone else’s freedom.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,409
For example, if A-hole says something so annoying
to Steve that he is forced to react violently,

19
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,510
A-hole would be guilty of harassment. If,
and only if, a court rules that any “Reasonable

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,030
Man”

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,339
would respond the same way.

22
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:08,930
It’s called “fighting words”, and “fighting
words” that incite violence are not protected

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,220
under the

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,390
First Amendment.

25
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,210
Obscenity isn’t protected either, but there
are some caveats. For example, if A-hole’s

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:16,420
obscenity

27
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,270
has artistic or political or scientific value,
then it’s totally within his rights to say

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,979
it. And once

29
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:27,469
again the judge of what is and isn’t obscene
is our “reasonable man.”

30
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,590
As for racial slurs and other derogatory language,
those fit soundly in both the “fighting

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,170
words”

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,189
and “obscene” categories, so they are
pretty much a no-go. Unless, again, the reasonable

33
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:38,619
man

34
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,450
is cool with it. Hence racial tension in America.

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,950
So, the bottom line is... you can say whatever
you want to anyone, unless a reasonable person

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,859
would find what you’re saying obscene or
so annoying that it would incite violence.

37
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:55,649
In practice, of course, it's usually much
murkier than that. So curse away sailors – it's

38
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,920
a-okay, as long as you're doing it for art
or science. 

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:00:00,000
