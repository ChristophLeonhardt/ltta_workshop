US House of Representatives has voted to demand the pentagon investigate the alleged involvement of US military personnel in torturing detainees at secret prisons in Yemen according to a UN report suspects that the sites were exposed to beatings electrocution and sexual violence some were imprisoned in a metal cell in the Sun others were denied medical treatment now there are reportedly 18 secret torture prisons in Yemen and neighboring countries the sites are mostly run by one of the main US allies in the region and that's the United Arab Emirates now those prisons were reported on in an investigation by The Associated Press their sources at the Pentagon acknowledged that US forces had been involved in interrogations but denied any participation or knowledge of abuse however even if that was the case this could still amount to complicity and torture if American personnel interrogated detainees who had been tortured human rights advocates have condemned the reported methods of interrogation the u.s. hasn't learned the lesson they're cooperating with forces that are torturing detainees and ripping families apart is not an effective way to find extremist groups the United Arab Emirates has officially denied any involvement in running secret prisons in Yemen as well as torturing suspects let's bring in a guest now let's go live to political analyst Marwa Osman and marwah thank you for joining us on the program tell us your thoughts will the Pentagon's investigation reap any results well the idea of them starting an investigation is definitely not new and especially not new considering the events knowing that the US Army and he was CIA has been involved in torture for as long as I can remember but I can bring up dates and I can bring up baby events of starting from the Vietnam War entering into the war on Iraq where they had we all know and we have seen the tortures of Abu cadet prison and also going through Lebanon for example southern Lebanon went was by their allies by the Israeli entity occupied they also had the Han Detention Center and unser Detention Center where tortures were a normal thing to do now when we go to Yemen this has been the case for the past three years I mean we have in our Arab media we have heard about this we have even seen some photos about this for as back as three years now about these prisons that are run by the United Arab Emirates that torture people and they inflict all sorts of psychological torture as well on them by holding their families as well hostage so I think this is something that the US has known about but but the investigation is only new because it was set up set out by representatives from the House of Representatives now what their own not this will be taken seriously we're gonna have to wait and see because I think it's gonna have to be a hundred and twenty days of investigations until the report is out that despite the fact that 120 days which means more 120 days of torture for these prisoners inside of these camps tension camps run by the UAE the real question here is are we going to see also some sort of an investigation concerning the us-made bombs that are falling on the heads of the Yemenis as well there's been very little coverage in the media about these allegations why do you think that is well basically when it's something related to the imperial world woods related to the Western world especially when the US cover-up is a major issue I mean look at the current CIA head of the CIA I mean she has an entire history of torture and it was well known and still she got to be the head of the CIA this is not a matter of whether the the u.s. does it or not I mean what's laughable for me was when the California Democratic Representative mr. Khanna who actually issued or demand that such an investigation he literally said this is not the way that the u.s. does business oh I bet I bet it is and I promise it is this is what the US has been doing all over the world in every base that it has every time they catch someone allegedly someone who is linked to terrorism or at least someone was against the u.s. Imperial demands or requests inside of this country they are treated like animals even worse they are treated in torture centers they are I mean can you really deny the fact that the u.s. is involved in this one we have seen what have been done in Libya for example it's it is it is hard aching that we don't know exactly how deep it goes inside of Libya I'm talking about the u.s. involvement especially with torture ourselves now when we when we talk about Yemen and specific the entire Yemen war has been not covered properly by the main mainstream media especially because it has been funded and waged by a major airline for the u.s. which is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even the numbers if you want to talk about the numbers of fatalities the number of people who are even dying from diseases inside of Yemen the numbers that we get from the UN and the UN are not entirely true to be honest because the UN representatives cannot bear to be in all of these places that are highly risky and that are fatal places for them so basically when we we want to talk about Yemen it's it's more related to what the US wants to cover more than what for the US wants to uncover for the media okay political analyst Marwa Osman thank you for your time and sharing your thoughts on this issue
