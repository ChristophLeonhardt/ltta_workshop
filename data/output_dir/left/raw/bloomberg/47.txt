1
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,670
Just like Lady Liberty or the Stars and Stripes
a mouthful of perfect pearly whites screams

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,960
USA.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,340
In fact, Americans spend more than $111bn
on their smiles every year

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,439
and it’s inspiring the rest of the world
to dig deep into their pockets too.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,780
Here’s how America got such pretty teeth.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,560
The sound of the dentist’s drill is enough
to keep plenty away but the global industry

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,050
for cosmetic dentistry is growing fast.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,339
Straightening and reshaping are increasingly
popular and whitening products are now easily

9
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,850
available off the shelf.

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,060
Worth nearly $16bn in 2015, the cosmetic dentistry
market is expected to hit nearly $28bn by

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,920
2024.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,700
And while cosmetic dentistry is big all around
the world, it’s most famous in America,

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,620
where it all began.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,700
Specifically, Hollywood.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,939
Or, Hollywoodland as it was known back then.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,440
In the 1930s American cinema was booming.
After the silent era when sound was introduced

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,180
which meant stars suddenly had to bare their teeth.

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,700
This would have a dramatic effect on the industry
and an even bigger impact on dentistry.

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,720
One moviegoer was a dentist and his name was
Charles Pincus.

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,700
Pincus had recently moved to Hollywood and
he sensed an opportunity in the movies.

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,680
“The camera is cruel in its relentless
exposure of the smallest flaw in the mouth.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,409
A tooth turned even slightly out of line casts
a shadow”, wrote Pincus in an essay to fellow

23
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,530
dentists.

24
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,920
Pincus had connections in the industry - the
max factor family, who were already revolutionizing

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,770
makeup for the movies - needed his help in
the studio.

26
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,000
For actors of that generation makeup wasn’t
always enough.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,850
The notion of oral hygiene was barely in its
infancy.

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,910
Pincus invented snap on caps to cover crooked
or missing teeth.

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,470
Made out of powdered plastic and porcelain
they became known as hollywood veneers.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,880
Among his patients he counted Joan Crawford
and James Dean.

31
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,300
One of his greatest achievements though was
probably the youngest of them all.

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,050
“She’s been a leading lady from the start”

33
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,840
Despite featuring in hits since she was just
six years old, audiences would never see

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
Shirley Temple lose a single baby tooth.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,960
That was thanks to Pincus’s veneers.

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,840
Afterall, stopping filming for a missing tooth
would cost tens of thousands of dollars.

37
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,300
Moviegoers were wowed by the perfect smiles
of their favorite stars.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,630
Having good teeth became an aspiration.

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:04,090
But despite that developing into a near national
obsession with perfect teeth, Americans don’t

40
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,920
actually have the healthiest teeth.

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,380
Nearly 1 in 5, older than 65, doesn’t have
any teeth at all. And that might be because

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,380
of access to healthcare.

43
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,300
Of those who didn’t visit the dentist last
year 59% claimed cost as the top reason.

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,250
When countries are ranked by how few fillings
or missing teeth they have - the US doesn’t

45
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,840
make the top ten.

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
In joint first it’s actually the British,
despite what everyone thinks.

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,391
“Since you’ve been frozen, there have

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,020
been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry
- What do you mean?”

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,380
While Americans might not have the very healthiest
of teeth, having the best looking might be

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,100
just as important.
Americans spend more each year on beauty than

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,830
they do on education.

52
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,740
But it’s not pure vanity, it’s an investment.

53
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,250
Attractive people tend to earn more, appear
more healthy and are more likely to marry.

54
00:03:59,250 --> 00:00:00,000
Making teeth good for our health in a different
way.
