when water came in we ran away with
whatever we could grab the water came
very fast we had to save our lives the
rainfall has led to massive landslides
where chunks of the mountain have come
down blocking the entire stretch
although the clearance team is working
to open the road unlikely it will happen
people have been shifted to camps in the
nearby areas
in our village everyone's houses were
destroyed it will be a long time before
we can go back I have no idea how long
it's going to take and where I will take
my family it will take a long time to
rebuild
