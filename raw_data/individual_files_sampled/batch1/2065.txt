you I think in Donald's case it came naturally that he would appreciate what wrestling was all about Donald has inhabited a character I think in wrestling terms it's often called the heel you know this is the guy who's the bad guy but he often prevails so he's the winner that we kind of love to hate he adopted this character he might call it the people's billionaire we in fact we used that phrase when we had conversations and he likes it a lot the people's billionaire is a guy who gets out there and fights he'll do and say outlandish things but ultimately he prevails and it's a World Wrestling Federation kind of approach to life but it fits Donald perfectly
