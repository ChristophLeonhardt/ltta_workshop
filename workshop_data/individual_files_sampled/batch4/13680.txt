he's the favorite comedian of a lot of people out there - and you know you can go down a YouTube wormhole of all the norm clips and the reason we're talking about norm now is he's getting a show on Netflix in I think two or three days I think it's airing either this week or next week and so the left is already trying to get him now it norm it's not like he's some Brooks Brothers wearing conservative it's not like you know he's this right-wing apologist or something he's just not politically correct and he's a comedian who cares about actually making people laugh unlike men net unlike Kathy Griffin unlike people who they go for claps and not laughs norm actually goes for laughs and so they're so angry at him because he isn't politically correct because he isn't making jokes about Trump because jokes about Trump are super duper lame he did this interview yesterday or two days ago with The Hollywood Reporter where he was asked what do you think about Roseanne Barr and louis c.k both of whom are friends of his going back decades I believe and he said well you know they were really broken up about the whole thing and they're really sorry and I'm I'm glad to see them back on their feet something to that effect and they are pillory him for this he made a comment he said that the me2 movement got a little bit crazy and so he's glad that there's some balance you know that because of their look there were false accusations some of the people who were accusers are now being accused of sexual harassment themselves some of the people who were accusers have details have come out where they were in consensual relationships not non-consensual relationships so he's just pointing out that it maybe got a little out of hand and it's glad that it's not as crazy as it was before he is being raked over the coals they're already trying to cancel his show there were actually people tweeting who said I hate his show it's boring and terrible the show hasn't premiered yet and all I look I like norm so I want to defend his show and I look forward to watching the show but what this is really about is all of the hysteria that is gripping all of America we're all so trigger-happy for those of you who are not familiar with norm just to give you a little context here as a joke he did on David Letterman's last show I think you'll understand why he's such a favorite on this program here there is one country that worries me though not Iraq not Iran that North Korea the only country that really worries me is the country of Germany I don't know if you guys are history buffs or not but in the early part of the previous century Germany he decided to go to war and who did they go to war with the world had never been tried before and so you figure that would take about five seconds for the world to win but no it was actually close then about then about 30 years pass and Germany decides again to go to Oran again it chooses as its enemy the world and this time they have that guy can I actually that guy I'm not even gonna dignify him by saying his name but I mean you know I've done but you think at that point the world will go listen Germany here's the deal you know ya be a country no more on account of you keep attacking the world so you get the sense we've talked about similar things before on this show with due respect to our German viewers and listeners so anyway the left is very upset because he's not being mean to Trump burries not telling this joke or that joke he's actually telling jokes just that are funny you know and that you're not allowed to do that anymore were in the Nannette comedy world now so he norm actually was booted from the Jimmy Kimmel show because of this non traversée this is the stupidest non traversée since the mark Duplass thing you remember the whole Mark Duplass he said I kind of like ben shapiro now it's all career is ruined this is the stupidest non traversée since then Jimmy Kimmel goes up to Norm Macdonald say you can't come on the show because you said that you still sort of like Roseanne Barr and you still sort of like Louie CK my producers are crying because of your comments my producers are crying Millennials in the workforce folks safe spaces at The Tonight Show I buy though I will actually give it to those Millennial producers certainly they undoubtedly millennial producers because they were able to negotiate in warm milk and pacifiers into their nightly contracts oh great good work I mean that's the art of the deal right there Oh Jimmy Fallon I'm sorry was Jimmy Fallon not Jimmy Kimmel is really sad because those two guys used to be different people that one was the crazy lefty one was just you know sort of having fun and now unfortunately looks like Jimmy Fallon is falling into that left-wing claptrap too easily confused though sorry to say that it's all of this trigger-happy hysteria producers shouldn't be crying because of a common sense observation they should people in show business is a horrible industry and we know that this town is rife with emotional physical and sexual abuse and they're crying because a guy made a normal observation this we're so the left is being hysterical that's what this is that's the only way to describe it it is hysteria get ahold of yourself people get ahold of yourself that you people should calm down this is what you know I think this is all Trump's fault this obviously is all Trump's fault because when Trump was elected everyone was told the world was gonna go to hell in a handbasket and then he was president for two years now and everything is going fine now common sense your gut instinct would tell you this would make people change their mind everyone would calm down because of this but that's not how people work in real life what actually happens when they're all they're totally hysterical they're expecting the worst something good happens they ignore the reality and double down on their prejudice they double down so they say will it but Trump is president so things can't be going well so it's really awful Zara and that's why they're getting crazier and crazier as the economy improves as the jobless numbers go down as the world is at peace relative peace they're not getting happier they're getting crazier they're getting this is how conspiracy theories work when you a guy has a conspiracy theory and then you tell you point out the holes in his conspiracy theory he doesn't stop believing a conspiracy he just thinks you're part of the conspiracy he gets even Wilder so you saw this morning Joe humiliated himself yesterday was a despicable column on 9/11 he said that Donald Trump is worse than 9/11 worse than 9/11 he said quote for those of us still believing that Islamic extremists hate America because of the freedoms we guarantee to all people the gravest threat Trump poses to our national security is the damage done daily to America's image as the New York Times is Roger Cohen wrote the month after Trump's election America is an idea strip away freedom human rights democracy the rule of law from what the United States represents to the world in America itself is gutted America's gutted under Donald Trump according to morning Joe and some dumb-dumb over at the New York Times first of all America is not just an idea America is a country found in part on ideas end on a tradition in a land at a particular time with particular people so not just an idea doesn't float in this rationalist if you're real cloud it's a real place it's a country it's a nation which we're gonna be talking about in a little bit but also does anybody believe that the Donald Trump has stripped America of freedom human rights democracy nor the left one who disturb America of democracy they wanted to overturn they still want to overturn a presidential election they but Donald Trump has only increased the freedom experienced by Americans deregulated the government let Americans keep more of their money is America gutted of course not but they can't admit this because they were so wrong in their predictions they can't admit it so they have to get crazier Morning Joe called Trump a politician who has done more damage to the dream of America than any foreign adversary ever could Donald Trump worst them Pearl Harbor I guess worse than blowing up the harbor killing all those Americans worse than killing 3,000 Americans do you really believe that maybe he does but what a morally idiotic fool if that's what he really believes Jeff Bennett at NBC the White House correspondent tweeted out he said quote Trump in Shanksville talks to US troops fighting the Menace of radical Islamic terrorism a controversial campaign catchphrase that he didn't use last year a controversial catchphrase radical Islamic terrorism is a controversial catch controversial to whom it's just reality it just describes it but NBC can't admit the reality because for years and years Barack Obama wouldn't use the term the Democrats wouldn't use the term and but it turns out the enemy that we're fighting or radical Islamic terrorists or they they're not moderate so they're not moderate they're radical they're not Methodist they're Islamic and they're not legal participants in war they're terrorists they're radical Islamic terrorists that's not a controversial catchphrase that's just a basic description of who they are but as we've seen this time and time again 65 terrorist attacks in Europe in just the last four years as we've seen it time and time again a stabbing happens to be happening every month or so in in Europe we've had seven I think of a seven might have been nine terrorist attacks since 2001 in the United States we can't the more that we see the evidence the more that we see who this is the more the left is going to double down and pretend that it isn't happening this this is very important because this hysteria seems to be ripping the country apart people have always been a little hysterical they referred to Ronald Reagan as a Nazi it's the election of Hitler as well they so everything they said about Trump they said about Ronald Reagan but now because of social media this is sort of the downside of social media it seems like it's so much louder that it's happening in a different way it does appear to be tearing the country apart Morning Joe talking about America being gutted fortunately we have an expert your amazon e who wrote this great book the virtue of nationalism but first I need to invite you into my boudoir come on in it's okay come on let me I'll give you a little tour around what I'm sleeping on purple mattress baby that purple mattress is saving my marriage I can say it certainly say that because I had a dinky little queen-size mattress before now I've got that California King thanks to purple and purple is the trick I don't sleep very well I've always I've always had mattresses that don't feel great or a little quirk in the neck or whatever purple mattress feels terrific it was designed by rocket scientists I've told you I have a very simple tastes I'm a man of simple tastes I'm easily satisfied by the best and that is purple mattress it is this brand-new material it was developed by an actual rocket scientist it is not like the memory foam that you are used to it is unique because it's firm and soft at the same time I know that sounds like a contradiction in terms it is not you just got to try it to find out and it sleeps really cool I obviously being of Sicilian descent I pour sweat in the middle of the night it will keep you really cool it's really nice you're gonna love purple right now my listeners get a free purple pillow with the purchase of a mattress that's pretty good free

you can think about me every time you lay your head on your pillow purple comm promo code cough fac of e fe fe that's the only way to get the free pillow use promo code cough fac o BF e f e wow that's really good now we're gonna share that together too you're gonna think of me every time you lie down on your bed here is dr. Hassan II dr. Hassan II thank you so much for being here thanks for having me I have told you already extensively how much I love this book it is so good it is an argument that you don't see people make it is totally politically incorrect it is a vigorous defense of nationalism we've heard in the conservative movement for years and years even even on the right that nationalism is a bad word Bill Buckley would always say I love patriotism but I hate nationalism as though there were some distinction between the two which I can't figure out what is the it you know in in five words or less you know in 20 seconds here what what is the argument for nationalism the simplest argument is is the world better off if it's governed by a diversity of independent nations each one with its own different customs and traditions in in constitutional and religious issues each one an experiment in what it is for human societies to to live is that better or should we go for some kind of centralized rules-based order that somebody's going to decide about and then impose on the rest of the world the argument is that the first is far superior it's not utopia but it's better well it what is amazing in the book is it's a it's a simple premise which is that there are two orders of the world you can have an imperial order the order of Empire or you can have a national order you trace that national order all the way back to the Bible and you trace the imperial order all the way up to institutions that we don't even think of necessarily as imperial the European Union the United Nations all these super national organizations oh why is it that the progressives seem to be advocating for Empire and how is the EU no different than the empires of Antep are as the progressives don't don't forget that that Marxism was a clearly Imperial a universalist ideology that sought to conquer the whole world and get everybody to live according to it to a single theory so the fact that progressives continue to believe in something like that isn't terribly surprising it's maybe a little bit more surprising to find people who are or liberals or classical liberals who are for a very long time allied with conservatism even today also advocating some kind of let's tear down all the borders and impose a single regime but I think for me that's personally more surprising well it's interesting too from your vantage in Israel because Israel comes out is born out of the second world war a nation for the Jewish people and now not shortly after the end of the Second World War we saw that nationalism was being blamed for the Nazis it was about nationalist expansion and nationalist hatred and nationalist fervor and that's why we all decided we have to totally get rid of nationalism and become one big kumbaya a community of people across the earth you say that this argument and this common knowledge that we have is totally ridiculous how so well it's not totally ridiculous it's just mostly wrong I mean look if you read about the policies of somebody like Dwight Eisenhower hey Dwight Eisenhower his foreign policy was was based on fighting imperialism and supporting nationalism because he believed in the self-determination of peoples and you can name lots of others on the left and on the right with Woodrow Wilson Teddy Roosevelt in his in his later years to golf batcher Gandhi David ben-gurion I mean so many people who are revered heroic figures politically and intellectually subscribed to one version or another of of a nationalist World Order that it really takes just an extraordinary degree of a - to just blame all of that say all of that is like Nazism and I just want to say the deep that that that the people saying this obviously I mean I don't recommend it people actually read mine comp but if you're going to talk about this it's not fun to read but if you're going to talk about this subject it's worth actually looking at what the Nazis believed the Nazis were from the first moment and in imperialist movement whose goal was as Hitler wrote - to make German in Germany the the mistress of the globe and the Lord of the earth his goal was to overthrow the order of national States which he viewed as corrupt and and contentious well I wonder one when we look at these historical examples even in our present time why is it that the the international community the Empire builders the advocates of the European Union and the advocates of the United Nations or whatever they seem to support nationalism for certain countries but not other countries they seem to support nationalism in other areas of the world the Middle East Southeast Asia parts of Africa but then they want to break down borders in Europe in the United States and in Israel why is that why why do these different countries seem to be treated differently you're absolutely right and and the the answer is because this internationalist worldview you know in both its progressive and its liberal forms is descended from an Enlightenment theory of history which goes an excellent example is conch which says that first first a society is tribal and barbaric and everybody killing one another then tribes gather to the unite under a law and peasant nation as the National States and then they only kill the the other nations and then finally you reach moral maturity what God calls it moral maturity when you realize that you need to take down all the borders and unite in one international state to cover everything and what's happening is that that the the progressives and liberals who support this kind of movement they look at the third world or Islamic countries or Southeast Asia the the countries that you're naming and they say oh those are just you know the primitives that barbarian haven't reached the level of moral maturity that we've reached but if anyone steps out of line among the descendants of European people's you know that could be the UK with brexit or it could be Israel or the Trump movement in America or Poland or Italy the moment you step out of line if you're descended from you know some kind of European background then you're attacked as a traitor as a traitor to the moral maturity that that Europeans are supposed to have reached that's right and it one of the ironies that you explain in the book is truly one of the enduring historical lessons which is that the Jews can't catch a break and so within 50 years of the foundation of the Jewish state of Israel you've got the people who helped found it say okay pish-posh let's drop those borders now let's be oh let's be nice let's have a nice international community or whatever how did that change so quickly you know in the in as you write about in the Bible the Jews are called out to be a nation not to be an empire but to be a nation and they get this nation state in the aftermath of the Second World War but now all of a sudden Israel is under attack on every college campus in America all over the world people are boycotting Israel but what is that about well there was a there was a mistake that the Americans in the British after world war ii III I think originally wanted to see a European Union because they were trying to build up a strong continental resistance to so expansionism but i think that that was just a terrible mistake and what what happened is that at an hour and the other founders of the the european community just unleashed this this vision of claiming that the independence of nations is the is the cause of warfare and and therefore the root of all evil and that that that argument they guess had tremendous emotional traction after world war ii among liberals and Marxists and since you know as you know the universities and and the media are very very sympathetic to these kinds of our arguments and so that they mean they've been educating an entire it's now two or three two or three generations first of europeans and now americans to the idea that national independence is actually the source of evil and that concentration of power in the hands of international bodies is the solution to it i want to know in what we're talking about concentrations of power and you make it pretty clear in the book there there seems to be a spectrum here between Anarchy chaos you know the kind of fever dream of libertarians maybe in the american right and empire the imperial order and then the nation nationalism is somewhere in the middle of that how do you arrive at that we hear nationalism bandied about by everybody from good conservative Americans to wacko white supremacists where what is the nation and what makes nationalism work why is that the best order for nations well the nation when I use the term nation I'm using it in in a traditional traditional way according to the the Anglo American political tradition which is which is rooted as you say in in script especially in the Hebrew Bibles so if you take let's say the King James Bible and you look up the way the word nation is used in the King James Bible then you'll get a really good idea of of what it is that shaped the the English Scottish Dutch American conception of of a nation but it's it's it's it's based on the diversity and unification of the ancient Israel Israelite tribes in the Bible but at the same time it's not based on race in in any way and we know that because when the Israelites weave Egypt Egypt that what we're told that Egyptians joined them and stood at the foot of Mount Sinai and received the Ten Commandments and joined the Jewish people or that Ruth the Moabitess even though she's a Moabite she she comes over to Israel and she embraces she says your people will be my people and your God will be my god and and when she adopts that mutual loyalty with the with the faith of the Jewish people and belief and it's God then she she becomes a part of the Jewish people right so the the biblical concept of a nation is is not based on race at all it's a unification of a number of tribes that are diverse internally but at the same time share some kind of basic cultural inheritance around which they can unite which is usually a language a religion a legal system and so on well that that is such a wonderful clarification because I'm reading it and I'm thinking this is the best defense of nationalism I've heard this is a very compelling argument and and yet I wondered where these you know they call themselves white nationalists fit into it because I've always found their arguments to be weak to say to put it charitably to not be very compelling at all and it's it's just a misunderstanding it seems by these various xx racists who exist in America misunderstanding of what the nation is what the nation has and throughout history read all of history well yeah white racism white nationalism is an oxymoron I mean you can't have a white nation I mean there is no white nation there's historically never been such a thing as a group of people who are the whites and they are a nation so that the the whole arguments the the biblical and anglo-american arguments is based on the assumption that nations are not some kind of fantasy that somebody came up you can't came up but you can't just say oh people with blue eyes they're a nation there's an actual historical thing that is a nation the French are a nation the Dutch are a nation the English are a nation and so on and you can argue on the margins about whether some group or another qualifies but but the fact that there are nations is that they're distinct from one another and that they're internally cohesive and that's that that's an empirical fact now the question the question that you you asked before about why is this a good way to organize the political order so the argument that I make in the book is is that is that national political or get a national form of political organization where nations are independence but it fits roughly halfway between conditions of anarchy where you know like like every family or every clan is independent and they're all at war with one another and at the other extreme a universal vision where the goal is for the whole world as much as possible to be brought under a single legal and political regime and what what the idea of independent nations what it does is it it tries to strike a balance between the two which is obviously difficult to maintain but it tries at the same time both to to embrace the the value of particularity of particularism of diversity the different nations are different from one another and the competition among nations is in fact what advances us towards innovation and and advancements you know in politics and religion science the arts so that's on the one hand on the other hand the the national state does resemble international empire in that what it does is it unifies a very large group of people and and drives warfare to to the to the periphery of of life so it creates a an internal sphere of peace and prosperity the difference between Empire and national independence is it is that that the nationalist when he's behaving himself at least is looking to take care of his own nation and actually sees it as a tremendous waste of resources to fight an unending war at the other side of the world to conquer all sorts of other peoples which would you then don't know how to govern right III this is something I've always loved about your writing even beyond the book I'll let you go because I know you're very busy and doing the book tour right now but something I love about it is you make conservative arguments you don't make argue liberal arguments as a conservative you don't say I'm a conservative because I'm a liberal you make conservative arguments and it's not just pie in the sky we're talking about real facts and things that are demonstrable in history and therefore demonstrable in the way that we should order our nation's and order our world and one of those facts is the nation it's a terribly compelling argument you have to go read it I encourage everybody to go read it the virtue of nationalism by doctor Yoram Hasani dr. Hasani thank you so much for being here sure thanks so much more to get to today I'm sorry though if you're on Facebook and YouTube how'd you do it how did you manage to stay on and that get kicked off if you're not if you're on daily wire.com thank you very much you help us keep the lights on in Co FFA in my tumblr but if you're not sign up it's ten bucks a month $100 for an annual membership you get me Ben Shapiro and replacement Matt Walsh questions in the conversation questions in the mailbag that's coming up tomorrow get your questions in none of that matters this is what matters the Kathy Griffin here's tumblr is that where are we starting that new vintage I'm litter I'm in a Twitter fight right now with Kathy Griffin because she always gets really angry with me and she said like f you michael knowles all you all you daily wire idiots don't know that comedy is subjective just very funny cuz then she's angry with us because we subjectively think she isn't funny maybe objectively think it either way it's led to an overflow of Kathy Griffin tears make sure you get your tumblr or you're going to drown the only reason that this studio isn't underwater right now is because we have the tumblr it's the FDA approved vessel go to daily wire calm we'll be right back all right we have some bad election news today not for the midterm elections that I'm not convinced about I'm there saying that the midterm generic ballot is terrible for Republicans but they always tell us this there was all Republicans don't even go out to vote there's no reason for you even to go vote because it's gonna you're gonna do so bad and then we win so I don't really believe that also because there's no such thing as a generic congressional candidate there's no jand when you're talking about these national polls giant blue states like California end up giving the Democrats a disproportionate representation in these polls so I'm not that concerned about that what I am concerned about is a poll that came out today from The Associated Press which is that only 25% of Americans think it is very important for their political candidates to have religious faith and this is a major low only 25 percent so more people think it's moderately important but this is a big low and it tells us a lot about the mis-education of Millennials and it tells us a lot about the cracking up of institutions like mainstream mainline Protestantism and I'm sorry to say Catholicism in America so you've got to look at these numbers because when you dig into this bowl from the AAP you'll learn about the political views and the views of candidates but there's another poll from Pew that came out a little while ago that shows that the lion's share of Millennials are religiously unaffiliated they're not Protestant they're not evangelical they're not Catholic they're not there noticed they're not whatever they're religiously unaffiliated this number is double that's that number for their parents generation and it's triple that of their grandparents generation really scary number now why is it scary well John Adams said that the American Constitution was built for a moral and religious people and that it's unfit for the governance of anyone else that's because it's a government that allows you to be free but the only way that you're allowed to be free the only way that you can govern yourself is if you have virtue if you have discipline if you have a religious foundation that inculcates those virtuals and that moral law into you and gives you a view of what the purpose of your freedom is if you don't have that you're just going to descend into Liberty nonsense and not be able to control yourself we look around and you know we've got a Burning Man culture basically it's descended into chaos and it'll only get worse if you can't control yourself if you can't discipline yourself the government is going to discipline you because you're not capable of your own freedom you're not capable of governing yourself I don't totally blame Millennials for this though because they've just been miss educated I don't think that the lion's share of Millennials have tried Christianity and found it to be wanting I think they haven't learned anything about Christianity at all I think they haven't been really raised with very much religion at all and this can be a great opportunity I mean this look I was an atheist for 10 years and then it struck me the intellectual side of it struck me later the spiritual side of it struck me the historical the cultural everything finally hit me and nobody's more enthusiastic than a revert or a convert so this this is a good opportunity but it requires that we show Millennials what they've been missing the whole time this also shows the breakdown of institutions of mainline Protestantism and of Catholicism because when you dig into that a peephole you'll see that among white evangelical Protestants the majority of them still believe it is extremely or very important that a candidate has strong religious beliefs so it's still the majority of white evangelical Protestants and it's not a racial thing because even among non-white evangelical Protestants almost 50% 47% believe the same thing that it's extremely or very important that candidates for public office have deeply held religious views when you get down to Catholics that number drops in half to 25% when you get down to mainline Protestants Episcopalians Presbyterians Methodists whatever it drops even lower to 18% why is that it's because those institutions have been hollowed out from within in the United States even the Catholic Church we're seeing the crack up of the Catholic Church now in the US where bishops have been incredibly accused of covering up abuse not just abuse of kids but abuse of seminarians abusive priests whole sexual networks within the clergy and credible allegations from a major archbishop archbishop vegan oh the former nun CEO to the u.s. accusing Pope Francis of being complicit in some of these cover-ups of priests and seminarians abuse this is a major issue but that isn't the whole issue a lot of the issue is that a lot of churches in America catholic churches to teach weaksauce weak religion there was a theologian in the 20th century I forget his name who said well I forgot which one it was who said that most of the sermons that he heard on Sundays amounted to I might suggest that you try to be good that's the homily that's the sermon and the same thing is obviously it's much worse among the mainline Protestant churches which have totally they they've you know fly PC transgender flags outside they've adopted the religion of political correctness and the religion of modern leftism but it's really bad because what you're going to end up with is what Richard neighbor the Christian ethicist described as a God without wrath leading a people without sin into a kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of Christ without a cross and that is not true religion and that's not compelling religion and the pews are going to empty if they try to teach that let that religion the the line is that if you marry yourself to the spirit of the age you're gonna find yourself a widow in the next stage and that's what we're seeing people thought in the Catholic Church after vatican ii after the traditional liturgy was nixed and they started inviting in all the acoustic guitars and all of the liturgical craziness they thought that that would modernize the church that now we're going to have a huge awakening what happened the pews emptied and what i see from my own vantage as a Catholic is that the traditional liturgies the Troodon teen mass the Latin services those are the ones that are filled up and you when you see it with families you know you know how the Catholics feel about babies you see like father mother kid kid kid kid kid kid kid you know they're there single-handedly filling up the pews that is what you need either that the church is going to be the church or there won't be a church but it's not going to become something else it's not going to become the leftist hippie dippie happy-hour that isn't going to compel people for very long that is a fad and this is true if the Catholic Church doesn't it's true if the Methodists do it it's true if anybody doesn't and I've really got to give credit where credit is due to evangelical Protestants in America who are still in many cases practicing what they preach there was a survey out of American Catholics I think also from pew that showed that roughly half of American Catholics support abortion the church is clear about its teaching on abortion people should be clear about the teaching on abortion abortion ends a human life Christ is very clear he says whatever you do to whoever causes the littlest one to sin it would be better for that man if he had a millstone tied around his neck and were cast into the bottom of the sea whoever harms the least of me and things aren't going to aren't going to turn out very well for that person and yet half of American Catholics support abortion this is insanity clearly they don't believe what they say that they believe and either the those churches are going to be the church and authentically preach the gospel or they're gonna fall apart and fall away and you're gonna get another generation of religiously unaffiliated and then another and another until the took to quote I think it was Pope Benedict the the flames of Christianity are extinguished throughout the West that's the direction that we're headed in and we need some of that old old-time religion don't try to I don't I don't think the rock star churches are going to do that I think you need to authentically preach the gospel and then you'll get people who are taking their religion seriously John Adams was not a crazy person he was not just a product of his time he was not a guy who thought in a shallow way he knows that this country which exalts freedom which protects freedom is only built for a moral and religious people even if you don't consider yourself religious give it a second thought I remember when I was an atheist in college and Coulter or I would have called myself an atheist I actually don't believe atheists really even exist you know if I don't believe in unicorns I don't spend all of my life talking about unicorns so I don't really even believe they exist but I would have called myself that and Ann Coulter made this great argument she said if all you care about is low taxes and you've got one guy who's pro-life and one guy who's pro-choice one guy who's religious one guy who's irreligious vote for the guy whose religious who's pro-life was those cultural aspects to his conservatism he will lower your taxes more because there is a coherence to his thought it's okay if you consider yourself atheist and you want to lower taxes that's that's better than being a leftist but there is a coherence to that thought that you you've got to you've got to understand and we get a lot of this out of the the framers and the founders of the country now to attack the Catholic Church even more not really do I attack the church but to attack people who were abusing the church and to attack corruption in the church we have heard from Pope Francis Pope Francis who said I will not say one word about this scandal I will not say one word about the accusations credibly made against me I will not say one word about this now he's saying some words he's saying multiple words he is now blaming the exposure of this corruption in the bishops and in the clergy not on the bishops but on Satan he's blaming the exposure of that corruption he's not even blaming the corruption he's blaming the fact that we now can see it that a light has been shed on this he's blaming that on Satan he said quote in these times it seems like the great accuser has been Unchained and is attacking the bishops true we're all sinners we bishops he tries to uncover the sins so they are visible in order to scandalize the people the great accuser is he himself says to God in the first chapter of the book of Job roams the earth looking for someone to accuse it bishops strength against the great accuser is prayer that of Jesus in his own and the humility of being chosen a remaining close to the people of God without seeking an aristocratic life that removes this unction let us pray today for our bishops for me for those who are here and for all of Bishops throughout the world every response has been so totally tone deaf as so totally missed the point yes Satan is the accuser Satan does accuse people the trouble with the church right now is that theirs is is not that there's too much shame that there is there are too many accusations the trouble with the church is that there are rotten corrupt bishops who were covering up for sex abuse for decades and they're lying through their teeth and they need to be rooted out because they're a scandal Christ talks about it he talks about the millstones he remember the millstones people it this is a really really tone-deaf response and we've heard this before but when the last time that Pope Francis responded after he said he wasn't going to respond he said that people who were talking about these things should be silent and pray yes people should pray but he told them to shut up this is not the right response and you're gonna see those numbers those religiously unaffiliated go up and up and up as long as this sort of corruption is is being tolerated by the Vatican or by bishops in the United States really really upsetting to see them but sit we're running late again we're always running late okay well we've got a lot more to talk about an attorney general candidate in New York has really really stepped in it she's violated the only rule that matters to the left which if they didn't have double standards would have no standards at all we'll just have to get to it tomorrow I want to leave you on this note however there was a video that came out yesterday on the anniversary of 9/11 it is perhaps the most American thing I've ever seen I'll just play it for you right now hey guys we're out here live on the highway 10 bridge I want to show you what's going on here on the bridge look what landed on top of the aerial on 9/11 isn't that unbelievable this Eagle just landed on the aerial while we're doing the 9/11 memorial phenomenal really incredible does make you think about the role of Providence in America from the founding of the country from the Mayflower all the way to the present there does seem to be a providential hand even as the religiously unaffiliated increase and increase and increase maybe that should all give us some thought we've got a lot more to talk about tomorrow in the meantime I'll see you then get your mailbag questions and
