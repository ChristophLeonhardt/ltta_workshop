it appears that Donald Trump has reached an agreement with both Canada and Mexico in terms of trade and first thing is that he wants to change the name no more NAFTA in fact he now calls it the United States Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA okay so I'm gonna get a just say because you stopped paused on the name you said it has a good ring to it doesn't it not really not at all like it doesn't roll off the tongue at all but it says it's Trump's idea Oh Jo it's great it's fantastic it's a very strong word USC's do something something MA mm a rolls right off the top yeah whatever I mean sure you want to rebrand it do you boo I don't really care and look I might give him credit we're gonna go into the details of these trade agreements in just a moment but before we do so I want you to hear from Trump himself and then again I will tell you what these new trade agreements entail it's my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand-new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA once approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up-to-date and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed if you look at the reviews people that would normally not under any circumstances say good things because automatically they have to say bad even some Democrats say that's amazing we had some there they haven't been given the sound bites yet I guess Mike but actually you had some Democrats say this is really amazing if he really got all of that but by tomorrow I would suspect they'll change their tune but that's okay because people know how good it is it's an amazing deal for a lot of people okay so he's unbelievable so look we're the fairest people in America let's just acknowledge the fairest okay so in the postgame I'm actually giving of Donald Trump credit for one honest thing he said during this press conference so TYT calm /join to become forget all of our shows including the postgame that's just for members so I will I'm not kidding I'm gonna give him credit for something he said that that made sense and here in this deal it's not I don't think it's a disastrous deal so we'll kind of give him credit for that but my reading of it I'm curious what you think Ana is that he took NAFTA and added protections for dairy farmers and just gave it a new name there's a little more than that so yeah we I am gonna give him a little bit of credit but I also think that it's a little too soon I like you you have to see how this agreement really plays out there's one thing in this agreement that I think is utterly disastrous and it has to do with pharmaceutical drugs we'll get to that in just a minute but yeah if you want like an overall look at what he's done the agreement sets new rules for automobile production meant to incentivize production of cars and trucks in countries that pay higher wages that's good it reduces barriers for American dairy farmers to sell cheese milk and other products to Canada it retains a tribunal for resolving trade disputes that the United States had sought to eliminate but I want to give context there because there's three things they mentioned there the cars is in reference to how Trump wanted to do extra tariffs on for on cars that come from Canada so now we will not be doing that now if you and I will say this look if you use those tariffs as a thread and then in return you get the dairy farmer concession from Canada okay good that's and this is when you're supposed to renegotiate a deal and we talked about that in the context of other tariffs it's that time to do it in time not to do it right so okay well played you got the dairy farmers back that's and again we're telling you as it is whether we dislike Trump on other issues okay but it is like so that was not a big win for us it was just we're just not going to do a Tavor we were going to do the dairy farmer things a win and then the this last thing that was mentioned in that quote about adjudicating things is what Canada wanted so we gave them something back in return now in terms of the dairy farmer thing what was the big concession we got from Canada that they will treat our farmers the same as they treat farmers in Europe and Asia which I'm sure is a very difficult thing to do look I'm gonna keep it 100 I'm an American I have deep concerns with the way we process food right especially meat and dairy and all that I think that other countries literally have had an incentive in not importing American meat or dairy just keeping it 100 we're pumping everything with hormones and antibiotics so again that's why you go to other countries and they specify that their meat is not from the United States so it's okay it's safe to eat it but anyway let me give you more details into that so and like the thing that kind of made me a little uncomfortable with this deal is like forcing them to import American dairy so the new agreement gradually opens the Canadian market to more exported American dairy products including fluid milk cream butter skim milk powder cheese and other dairy products Canada agreed to eliminate a program that helps Canadian sellers of certain milk products at home and abroad so that was the biggest concession from Canada yeah I think look we have a subtle difference here but I think it's a win the Republican I mean an American president is supposed to argue on behalf of American industries and is there's a lot worse we sell weapons that kill thousands of people milk I'll take it I'll take it so fair's fair right but is it a gigantic win it's no like the big big concession we got is that Canada will treat us the same as Europe and Asia when it comes to milk and other things that affect dairy farming it's not a thing that turned what Trump called the worst deal ever signed that's what he said about NAFTA - now you saw him saying this is everybody talking about how this is one of the best deals ever such a strong yoke really the whole thing was just milk NAFTA would have been great if it had milk in it too got milk and that solved it that solved it so he's helping the dairy farmers but he's also helping the pharmaceutical industry as well okay so let's let's go to that graphic 22 I'm sorry graphic 21 the provision to extend the intellectual property protections of American pharmaceutical companies selling prescription drugs in Canada that's also included in this new deal huge you're waited it's cute yes absolutely and it's going to increase drug prices in Canada it will grant longer protections to American biologic drugs against biosimilar competitors and it will probably not probably definitely raise the profits of those drug makers when they sell in Canada so Trump is essentially looking out for those dairy farmers who are likely to vote for him keeping it 100 and also the pharmaceutical companies which he had argued that he would go after should he get elected or to make sure she ate those drug prices ridiculous he hasn't done any of that pharmaceutical prices for Americans through the roof always has been always will be as long as we have these liar politicians and now the prices will probably go up in Canada as well based on these longer intellectual property protections by the way one other quick thing that I wanted to mention we're getting involved in wine as well so apparently this new agreement mandates that an escalating I'm sorry the mandate essentially says that in in stores in Canada where they only specifically sell wine from their own country they can't do that anymore they have to now include American wine as well yeah I'd like to get into the wine business right about now yeah okay so last thing on this is important what I predicted was that Trump would come into office and just change the names I literally said this change the names of the trade deals and now say they went from the worst deal to the best deal okay and I joked around how he would change trans-pacific partnership to Trump Pacific Partnership and then say it's now wonderful it's fantastic i renegotiated i'm such a good deal maker it's so beautiful right and here we have in essence exactly that so what was the progressive critique of TPP and NAFTA it was that it allows corporations to write the rules instead of the real representatives of the American people the Canadians the Mexicans etc right by the way they you can tell that this is not very very progressive deal because they rushed it through before Obrador takes office in Mexico that was their deadline because they'd asked me 90 days before then and over door is a progressive they're like a progressives not gonna like this deal because this is a very pro corporate deal so at the end of the day what happened yes we got to win on dairy farmers but instead of us paying lower prices from drugs from Canada Canada is now forced to pay higher drug prices from drugs in from America so once again corporate interests win we all lose but hey Donald Trump called it a different name so now he says it's the best deal ever made the TYT Plus app is now
