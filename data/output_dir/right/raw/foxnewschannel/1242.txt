1
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,117
>> IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A

2
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,952
TOUGHER OR MORE IMPORTANT JOB

3
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,087
THAN BEING A AIR TRAFFIC

4
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:11,487
CONTROLLER.

5
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:12,989
GO AHEAD AND TRY, IT WILL TAKE

6
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:13,789
YOU A WHILE.

7
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,858
EVERY DAY MORE THAN 2.5 MILLION

8
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:17,760
AMERICANS FLY IN OR OUT OF U.S.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,061
AIRPORTS, ALONG WITH MANY

10
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,631
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CARGO.

11
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,734
AT ANY ONE TIME THERE ARE 5,000

12
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:25,401
AIRCRAFT ABOVE THE UNITED

13
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:25,735
STATES.

14
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,471
ON 9/11, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS

15
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:29,739
GUIDED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO A

16
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,641
SAFE LANDING IN A LITTLE OVER AN

17
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:31,941
HOUR.

18
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:32,875
GO AHEAD AND TRY THAT.

19
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,710
IT'S A JOB WHERE A SMALL MISTAKE

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,611
COULD LEAD INSTANTLY TO THE

21
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,013
DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

22
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:39,015
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE HIRING

23
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:40,149
STANDARDS FOR AIR TRAFFIC

24
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,550
CONTROLLERS WERE LONG AMONG THE

25
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,286
MOST SELECTIVE OF ALL FEDERAL

26
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:44,587
JOBS.

27
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,355
APPLICANTS TYPICALLY NEEDED TO

28
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,256
COMPLETE MILITARY SERVICE OR

29
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,192
PASS THE FAA'S COLLEGIATE

30
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,193
TRAINING INITIATIVE PROGRAM.

31
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:54,096
AFTER THAT THEY SAT FOR A

32
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,032
SPECIALLY-DESIGNED EXAM THAT

33
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,900
TESTED FOR MATH ABILITY AND

34
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,035
COMPLEX PROBLEM-SOLVING.

35
00:00:59,035 --> 00:00:59,902
ONLY THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST

36
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:01,070
SCORES MADE THE CUT.

37
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,471
THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO

38
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,406
CHOOSE THE BEST.

39
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,174
FOR DECADES IT WORKED.

40
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:08,277
THEN DURING THE OBAMA

41
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:08,911
ADMINISTRATION, ACTIVIST

42
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:09,712
BUREAUCRATS DECIDED THAT THE

43
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:11,747
POOL OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS

44
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:12,948
WASN'T DIVERSE ENOUGH.

45
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,750
THEY NEVER EXPLAINED WHY

46
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,553
DIVERSITY OUGHT TO MATTER IN AIR

47
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:19,755
TRAFFIC CONTROL, OR WHY IT WAS

48
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:21,390
MORE THAN TRADITIONAL GOALS LIKE

49
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,525
COMPETENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

50
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,393
THE FAA WITHOUT A VOTE, JUST

51
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:26,829
SCRAPPED THE OLD HIRING SYSTEM

52
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,331
AND REPLACED IT WITH A DIVERSITY

53
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:30,066
FRIENDLY VERSION.

54
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:33,502
MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA THIS

55
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:33,936
HAPPENED.

56
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,071
THE FAA REQUIRES APPLICANTS TO

57
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:37,807
FILL OUT A BIOGRAPHICAL

58
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,109
QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE ANOTHER

59
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:40,543
SCREENING.

60
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:41,944
THOSE THAT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS

61
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:49,885
IN A WAY THAT DIVERSITY MONITORS

62
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,221
DON'T LIKE WILL NOT GO FURTHER,

63
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:56,692
BECAUSE THE BIOGRAPHICAL

64
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:57,760
QUESTIONNAIRE IS ALL IMPORTANT.

65
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,729
WE GOT A COPY OF THE

66
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,596
QUESTIONNAIRE, HOW IT'S SCORED.

67
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:01,597
IT'S SHOCKING.

68
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:04,934
FOR EXAMPLE, ONE QUESTION ASKED

69
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,203
TEST-TAKERS TO NAME THEIR WORST

70
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,871
THE PROTESTER ANSWER FOR THAT IS

71
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:09,205
SCIENCE.

72
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,906
IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU CAN'T DO

73
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:12,208
SCIENCE, THE FAA IS SPECIALLY

74
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,610
EAGER TO HIRE YOU AS AN AIR

75
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,511
TRAFFIC CONTROLLER.

76
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,346
YOU GET 10 POINTS FOR BEING BAD

77
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,781
AT SCIENCE, ACCORDING TO THE

78
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:19,582
SCORING SHEET.

79
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:20,483
ANOTHER QUESTION ASKED ABOUT

80
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:21,383
WORK HISTORY.

81
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,018
ACCORDING TO THE FAA, THE BEST

82
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,920
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS YOU

83
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,821
HAVEN'T WORKED AT ALL IN THE

84
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,556
PAST THREE YEARS.

85
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:30,559
YOU GET 10 POINTS FOR NOT

86
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:30,893
WORKING.

87
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:32,995
APPARENTLY UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE

88
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,530
MAKE THE BEST AIR TRAFFIC

89
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:34,930
CONTROLLERS.

90
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,998
THIS IS DEMENTED, BY THE WAY,

91
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,299
BUT IT'S REAL.

92
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,300
SO DO APPLICANTS WHO PLAYED A

93
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,635
LOT OF SPORTS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

94
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,237
THEY'RE REWARDED TOO.

95
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:43,439
BY CONTRAST APPLICANTS WHO SAY

96
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,741
THEY KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT AIR

97
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,009
TRAFFIC CONTROL GET ONLY FIVE

98
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:47,576
POINTS.

99
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,011
TRAINED PILOTS GET TWO POINTS.

100
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,279
ONCE AGAIN, APPLICANTS WHO

101
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,580
HAVEN'T WORKED AT ALL, WHO HAVE

102
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,415
BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR THE PAST

103
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:56,452
THREE YEARS, GET 10 POINTS.

104
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:57,653
PILOTS TWO POINTS.

105
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,455
THIS IS INSANE.

106
00:02:59,455 --> 00:02:59,955
IT'S DANGEROUS.

107
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,390
IT'S ALSO INDEFENSIBLE.

108
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,359
WE ASKED THE FAA'S TOP SPOKESMAN

109
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,228
WHY APPLICANTS FOR AN AIR

110
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,030
TRAFFIC CONTROL JOB WOULD GET

111
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,266
MORE POINTS FOR HIGH SCHOOL

112
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,433
SPORTS THAN FLYING PLANES OR

113
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,835
KNOWING A LOT ABOUT AIR TRAFFIC

114
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,169
CONTROL.

115
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,770
HIS RESPONSE, QUOTE, I'M TRYING

116
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,239
TO FIND THAT OUT AS WELL.

117
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,340
WELL, NOT TRYING VERY HARD IT

118
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,475
TURNS OUT.

119
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,310
WE STILL HAVEN'T HEARD BACK WITH

120
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,745
A REAL EXPLANATION, AND OF

121
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,846
COURSE WE WON'T BECAUSE THERE

122
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:26,215
ISN'T ONE, OTHER THAN SHUT UP,

123
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:26,582
DIVERSITY.

124
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,283
WE WON'T SHUT UP.

125
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:28,317
THIS IS TOO PAR.

126
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,752
LIVES ARE AT STAKE.

127
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,153
JOINING IS MICHAEL PEARSON, A

128
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,088
LAWYER REPRESENTING A MAN SUING

129
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,792
THE FAA FOR ITS UPDATED HIRING

130
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,693
PRACTICES.

131
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:38,327
MR. PEARSON, THANK YOU FOR

132
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:38,861
COMING ON.

133
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,795
>> THANK YOU, TUCKER.

134
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:40,996
GOOD TO BE HERE.

135
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:43,532
>> WHY WOULD THE FAA AWARD EXTRA

136
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,568
POINTS FOR INCOMPETENCE?

137
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:46,135
SCIENCE, FOR EXAMPLE?

138
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:52,808
>> WELL, THE BIOGRAPHICAL

139
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,009
ASSESSMENT WAS MADE TO SCREEN

140
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,244
OUT PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE.

141
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,046
IT WASN'T MEANT IN ANY FORM OR

142
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:58,914
FUNCTION, THAT I CAN FIND -- AND

143
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,749
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR

144
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,751
ALMOST FOUR YEARS NOW, INCLUDING

145
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:03,652
LOOKING OVER MANY DOCUMENTS WE

146
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,888
HAD TO FIGHT THE FAA FOR SEVERAL

147
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:08,891
YEARS THAT THEY KEPT HIDDEN --

148
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,459
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

149
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,594
THE TEST WAS BASICALLY MEANT TO

150
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,996
SCREEN OUT PEOPLE WITH AVIATION

151
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:14,430
EXPERIENCE.

152
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,464
THERE'S EVEN WORSE QUESTIONS AND

153
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,934
ANSWERS ON THE TEST, BUT YOU DID

154
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,971
A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF PORTRAYING

155
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,973
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND

156
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:24,740
ANSWERS ON THE TEST.

157
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,574
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

158
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:27,276
JUST TO RESTATE FOR OUR

159
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,978
AUDIENCE, SO NUMB TO THIS KIND

160
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,013
OF THINKING THAT IT MAY NOT

161
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:31,380
PENETRATE.

162
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,083
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HIRING A

163
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:34,950
SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR.

164
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,353
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AIR TRAFFIC

165
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,955
CONTROLLERS, WITH A LINCHPIN OF

166
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:40,990
PUBLIC SAFETY AND

167
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,457
TRANSPORTATION.

168
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:44,426
WHY WOULD THE FAA WANT PEOPLE

169
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:46,729
WITH LESS RELEVANT SKILLS IN AIR

170
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,631
TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR AIR TRAFFIC

171
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:49,198
CONTROLLERS?

172
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:51,066
>> BECAUSE A GROUP WITHIN THE

173
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,968
FAA, INCLUDING THE HUMAN

174
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:53,936
RESOURCES FUNCTION WITHIN THE

175
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,771
FAA, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL

176
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,673
BLACK COALITION OF FEDERAL

177
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,507
AVIATION EMPLOYEES, DETERMINED

178
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,809
THAT THE WORKFORCE WAS TOO

179
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:01,410
WHITE.

180
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,512
THEY HAD A CONCERTED EFFORT

181
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,747
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

182
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:05,381
TRANSPORTATION, THE OBAMA

183
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,715
ADMINISTRATION, TO CHANGE THAT.

184
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:08,350
AND QUITE FRANKLY, THEY'RE

185
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,553
SACRIFICING, AND HAVE SACRIFICED

186
00:05:11,553 --> 00:05:14,123
SAFETY AT THE 589ER OF POLITICAL

187
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:15,157
CORRECTNESS.

188
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:19,628
IT OFFENDS THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUS,

189
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:20,896
BUT ALSO FEDERAL LAW.

190
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:21,463
WE'RE EXPOSING THAT.

191
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:23,666
>> WHY WOULD THIS GO ON FOR

192
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,169
YEARS WITHOUT ANYBODY IN ELECTED

193
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,304
OFFICE SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

194
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:29,905
JUST ONCE AGAIN -- I'M HARD TO

195
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,473
SHOCK, BECAUSE I DO THIS STUFF

196
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:34,109
FOR A LIVING -- WE ARE LOWERING

197
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:38,180
THE STANDARDS, AND INTENTIONALLY

198
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,948
HIRING PEOPLE LESS COMPETENT FOR

199
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:41,450
ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL JOBS IN

200
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,584
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?

201
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,219
WHY WOULD NO ONE IN CONGRESS DO

202
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,823
ANYTHING TO STOP IT?

203
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:49,525
>> WELL, OUR LAW FIRM, ALONG

204
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,093
WITH MOUNTAIN STATE'S LEGAL

205
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:51,994
FOUNDATION, FILED THE INITIAL

206
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:52,328
LAWSUIT.

207
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:54,897
THEN THE GROUP OF SCHOOLS GOT

208
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,666
TOGETHER, OVER 30 COLLEGIATE

209
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,367
TRAINING INSTITUTIONAL SCHOOLS

210
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,535
GOT TOGETHER AND WENT TO

211
00:05:59,535 --> 00:05:59,902
CONGRESS.

212
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:04,974
THERE HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF

213
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,208
CONGRESS THAT HAVE HELD HEARINGS

214
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:06,875
ON THIS.

215
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:11,380
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UNION

216
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,652
CONTROLS A LARGE PACT THAT FUNDS

217
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:18,487
POLITICIANS, AND NOTHING WILL

218
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,555
GET PAST WITHOUT THE BLESSING OF

219
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,223
THE CONTROLLERS UNION.

220
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,624
THEIR POSITION RADICALLY CHANGED

221
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:23,859
WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

222
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,527
CAME IN.

223
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:27,696
I'M NOT SAYING THAT LIGHTLY.

224
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:28,731
I WAS AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

225
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,565
AT FOUR OF THE BUSIEST

226
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:30,733
FACILITIES IN THE COUNTRY FOR

227
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,434
ALMOST 27 YEARS, ALONG WITH

228
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,236
BEING AN ATTORNEY AND PROFESSOR.

229
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:36,472
WHEN I SAY THESE THINGS, IT'S

230
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:37,840
NOT ONLY BASED ON EXPERIENCE,

231
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,707
BUT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND

232
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,809
PROOF I HAVE.

233
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,344
AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERYONE

234
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:43,545
FLIES, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF

235
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:44,680
CONGRESS, WHO FLY QUITE OFTEN.

236
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,182
I THINK THE ONES THAT HEARD THE

237
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:49,518
STORY WERE OFFENDED BY IT,

238
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,487
BECAUSE IT'S IN THEIR BACKYARD.

239
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,288
IT'S A SAFETY INTEREST FOR THEM.

240
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,923
THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE,

241
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:56,825
QUITE FRANKLY, BECAUSE, AGAIN,

242
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,261
IT'S THE SAFETY OF THE NATIONAL

243
00:06:59,261 --> 00:06:59,862
AIRSPACE AT RISK HERE.

244
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:01,530
I CAN TELL YOU FROM TRAINING

245
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,232
WELL OVER A HUNDRED, PROBABLY

246
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,767
300 CONTROLLERS IN MY LIFETIME

247
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,769
AS AN FAA CONTROLLER, THAT THERE

248
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:07,936
IS A DIFFERENCE.

249
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,506
THIS IS AIKEN TO THE VETERANS

250
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:11,707
ADMINISTRATION HIRING DOCTORS

251
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,941
AND TRYING TO TELL THE PUBLIC

252
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,910
THAT THE BEST PHYSICIAN IS ONE

253
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,245
THAT NEVER WENT TO MEDICAL

254
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,080
SCHOOL AND THAT THE VA CAN TRAIN

255
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,581
THEM BETTER.

256
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,783
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S OCCURRED

257
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,150
HERE.

258
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,919
TO BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD, THE

259
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,055
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS NOT COVERED

260
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,523
THIS, AND HAS COVERED UP THIS

261
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:29,958
ISSUE, AND HAS NOT REVEALED

262
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:30,659
WHAT'S GOING ON.

263
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,061
IT'S A SHAME.

264
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,364
IT'S NOT ONLY SHAMEFUL, IT AGAIN

265
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,132
SACRIFICES PUBLIC SAFETY.

266
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,767
>> IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,

267
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,602
PEOPLE IN THE FAA WE SPOKE TO,

268
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:44,640
WERE SUCH COWARDLY WORMS, I

269
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,976
DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY, BUT THEY

270
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,778
WON'T COME ON AND DEFEND THIS.

271
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,213
A RHETORICAL QUESTION, DID THE

272
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:51,947
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EVER SHOW

273
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,816
WITH DATA THAT SOMEHOW INCREASED

274
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:57,086
DIVERSITY?

275
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,554
THE RANKS OF AIR TRAFFIC

276
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,222
CONTROLLERS WOULD MAKE THE

277
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:00,656
PUBLIC SAFER?

278
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,191
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

279
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,059
THERE'S DATA THAT SHOWS IT'S A

280
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:04,993
PUBLIC FARCE, INCORRECT.

281
00:08:04,993 --> 00:08:07,062
THERE'S NO DATA TO SUPPORT THAT.

282
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:08,297
THIS IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING AT

283
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:10,999
ITS FINEST AT THE SACRIFICE

284
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:11,834
AGAIN OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

285
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,669
>> IT'S TOTALLY DEMENTED.

286
00:08:13,669 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'LL RIDE THIS UNTIL IT'S MADE
