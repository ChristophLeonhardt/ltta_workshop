she's Kurt from McDonald's only in Wisconsin so here we go we're gonna try them out they're gonna be about a beam ladders only because it real chewy real salty and I like a little more crunching my fried cheese curds but they're good for McGowan's they're very salty I mean not overly salty but I can't believe I'm saying this it's on par with some of the bar cheese curds I've had not all of them there's some really damn good bar cheese curds these are actually pretty damn good I'm not gonna lie I'm very impressed right now I am very shocked after tasting that McDonald's cheese curd because I thought it would taste the same as a mozzarella stick just chopped up in small bits I was completely wrong it's a complete new product it tastes like an authentic Wisconsin cheese Kurt that is battered and then fried and it tastes like it is fresh from the Wisconsin State Fair complete new and innovative product that I would recommend
