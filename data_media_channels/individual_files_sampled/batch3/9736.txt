SUCH TIME AS WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZED. PAUL: THAT WAS MIKE POMPEO IN SEOUL THIS WEEK INSISTING SANCTIONS WILL NOT COME TO NORTH KOREA UNTIL IT COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZES. A PROCESS THE SECRETARY OF STATE COULD TAKE A LONG AS 2 AND A HALF YEARS. PYONGYANG STAGED THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF ITS TEST SITES LAST MONTH BUT DISMANTLING ITS ENTIRE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS ANOTHER MATTER. HOW CAN THE U.S. VERIFY WHAT NORTH KOREA ACTUALLY HAS IN ITS ARSENAL, LET'S ASK DAVID ALRIGHT, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND FORMER WEAPON'S INSPECTOR. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO BE HERE. PAUL: SO LET'S START OUT BY HOW MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS DO WE THINK NORTH KOREA REALLY HAS? WELL, IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT ESTIMATE TO MAKE BECAUSE WE KNOW NOT THAT MUCH. I MEAN, ESTIMATES I'VE MADE ANYWHERE FROM 15 TO 35 NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE NUMBER COULD BE HIGHER IF THEY HAVE MORE CAPABILITY THAN THAN WE ARE ESTIMATING, SO IT'S VERY TOUGH BUT THEY HAVE, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF DOZEN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, MAYBE, THERE'S A CHANCE IT'S FEWER, BUT, AGAIN, UNCERTAIN. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHERE COUNTRIES MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WHERE THEY STORE THEM, SO WHAT WE FALL BACK TO TYPICALLY IS TRYING TO LOOK AT THEIR CAPABILITIES TO MAKE PLUTONIUM AND WEAPON GRADE URANIUM AND THOSE FACILITIES TEND TO BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND TO INSPECT. PAUL: ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY OF THOSE FACILITIES DO WE HAVE, FOR A WHILE WE HAD A PLUTONIUM SITE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ENRICHED URANIUM SITE? THAT'S RIGHT, PLUTONIUM IS MUCH BETTER UNDERSTOOD. A FOCUS OF THE SIX-PARTY TALKS IN THE 2000'S AND EARLIER, AND A LOT IS KNOWN ABOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A SECRET REACTOR BUT THEY DO HAVE A SECRET ENRICHMENT PLAN WE ARE PRETTY SURE, AND WE DON'T KNOW WESTERN INTELLIGENCE HAS A GOOD IDEA WHERE THE PLANT IS. THEY ALSO HAVE ANOTHER ONE WHICH THEY BUILT IN SECRET AND REVEALED IN 2010. SO I THINK THE WORKING ASSUMPTION IS THEY HAVE TWO SUBSTANTIAL URANIUM ENRICHMENT PLANTS, ONE NORTH KOREA ADMITS TO, AND ONE IT DOESN'T AND THOSE PLANTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE THOROUGHLY INSPECTED, BUT BEFORE THAT, I MEAN, WHAT YOU WANT IN VERIFICATION IS FOR THE COUNTRY TO REVEAL IN AN HONEST WAY WHAT IN THIS CASE INCLUDING ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES AND SIZE OF NUCLEAR ARSENAL. PAUL: RIGHT, THAT MEANS THAT AT A FIRST STEP WHAT YOU WANT FROM NORTH KOREA IS ESSENTIALLY A DECLARATION, A LIST, HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF OUR WEAPONS, IN TERMS OF OUR SITES FOR BUILDING THOSE WEAPONS, IN TERMS OF SITES ON BUILDING URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM AND SO ON AND SO ON. AND THE INITIAL LIST COULD BE ALMOST JUST LIKE A LIST, BUT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM FOR THEM TO ALLOW VISITS TO THOSE SITES SO INSPECTORS CAN IN A SENSE GET THE LAY OF LAND AND INSPECTORS SHOULD NOT BE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC AGENCY. IT SHOULD BE EFFORT ORGANIZED BY THE UNITED STATES AND ALLIES IN THAT REGION INCLUDING CHINA, WELL, NOT CALL THEM ALLY BUT AT LEAST A FRIEND ON THIS ISSUE AND THEN NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO CREATE A NARRATIVE OF ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON'S PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD BECOME A FULL-BLOWN DECLARATION WHICH COULD BE VERIFIED BY INSPECTORS. PAUL: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT INSPECTORS, AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, NOT THE UN AND THE U.S. SHOULD BE PART OF THAT, BUT DOES IT HAVE TO BE INSPECTIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY ON DEMAND, THAT MEANS ANYWHERE WE WANT TO LOOK, WE CAN GO AND YOU'LL HELP US LOOK AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT? THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THAT INTRUSIVE, I MEAN, BUT NORTH KOREA HAS TO BE WILLING TO ALLOW, WELL, TO TELL AN HONEST STORY, I MEAN, IN THE SENSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE IT, THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME PLACES. WE HAVE LIST OF SITES THAT ARE SUSPECT NUCLEAR SITES AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALLOW SOME LEVEL OF VISITS TO PLACES WHERE WE JUST WANT TO CHECK IT OUT, YOU KNOW, WHERE WERE WRONG AND WERE WE RIGHT, IS IT FALLING OFF THE LIST BECAUSE IT'S CLOSED DOWN BUT SO THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE FAIRLY BROAD AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THE CASE OF IRAQ WHERE THE INSPECTORS HAD THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO GO ANYWHERE. IT CAN BE LESS THAN THAT. PAUL: BUT WHY LESS THAN THAT IF WE KNOW FROM THE PAST THAT NORTH KOREA HAS NOT TOLD THE TRUTH, WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE JUST AS INTRUSIVE BECAUSE SADDAM LIED FOR YEARS AS WELL AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS INTRUSIVE? WHAT I'M SAYING IT WOULD BE GREAT IF COULD BE THAT INTRUSIVE. NORTH KOREA HASN'T ALLOWED INSPECTORS TO GO OUTSIDE BEYOND MAYBE ONE OR TWO CASES WHERE U.S. HAD A SPECIAL MISSION TO DO AND PAID QUITE A PRICE TO GET THERE. SO I THINK WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESIGN A SYSTEM WHERE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH, BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO DEMAND PERFECT. PAUL: OKAY, DO WE HAVE TO INSIST THAT THEY STOP ENRICHING URANIUM AND WE BASICALLY BE ABLE TO HAUL OUT ALL OF THE STOCKPILES OF ENRICHED URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM AND HAUL IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY? THEY CERTAINLY HAVE TO STOP. I MEAN, THAT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. NORTH KOREA WILL SAY, WE HAVE NEEDS, CIVIL REACTORS, WE WANT TO FUEL, I THINK THE UNITED STATES HAS TO BE VERY FIRM. NO ENRICHMENT AT ALL. IT'S JUST A BAD IDEA GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE WHOLE EFFORT WITH NORTH KOREA. THEY SHOULD BE SHUTTING DOWN AND DISMANTLING URANIUM AND ENRICHMENT PROGRAM ALONG WITH PLUTONIUM AND WEAPON'S PROGRAM AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. IT'S NOT ABOUT FREEZING, IT'S REALLY ABOUT GETTING RID OF IN A VERIFIABLE MANNER AND SO IT'S CRITICAL TO DO THAT. PAUL: I WOULD ASSUME THAT WOULD INCLUDE PLUTONIUM AS WELL? FOR SURE. THEY MAY KEEP REACTOR OPERATIONAL THAT IF SOMEHOW MAKING ELECTRICITY, THEY MAY EVEN IMPORT REACTORS BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE ENRICHING URANIUM FOR THOSE REACTORS, THOSE REACTORS WOULD BE STRUCTURED OR DISSIGNED IN A DESIGNED, PROLIFERATION RESISTANT, BUT THAT PART OF THE PEACEFUL ENERGY PROGRAM WITH NORTH KOREA HAS TO BE NEGOTIATED CAREFULLY AND REALLY I DON'T THINK WE ARE EVEN AT THAT STAGE YET. PAUL: RIGHT.
