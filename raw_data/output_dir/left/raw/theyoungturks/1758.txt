1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:02,399
IT'S MAY
1, A.K.A.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,399
INTERNATIONAL WORKERS

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:09,590
DAY, ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE
ARE PROTESTING FOR WORKERS'

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,590
RIGHTS.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,360
THESE ARE PHOTOS FROM
NEW YORK.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,980
AN ORGANIZER OF ONE OF

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,159
THE EVENTS IN NEW YORK SAID --

8
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:37,320
THIS IS ACCORDING TO AN
ADVOCACY GROUP.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
IN RECENT YEARS

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:50,320
THERE HAS BEEN A MARRIAGE OF
MAYDAY AND IMMIGRANT GROUPS FOR

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,160
THEM TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE
CHANGE, ONE OF THE FOCUS IS ON

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,949
THE ELECTION, YOU SEE ARCHES
FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND THE

13
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,330
UNITED STATES, AND TRYING TO
FOCUS ON MAKING AN ELECTORAL

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,330
DIFFERENCE.

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,400
THIS IS FROM
ANGELICA SALAS IN LOS ANGELES

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
WHO SAID --

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:22,560
ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE NEED TO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN EVERY

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,920
ELECTION THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN
NOW AND FOREVER TO GET THE KIND

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,420
OF CHANGE WE WANT.

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,690
REACTIONS TO
THE INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,690
SITUATION?

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,930
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU
KNOW ABOUT MAYDAY AND ITS

23
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,590
ORIGINS BUT IT'S REALLY
INTERESTING BECAUSE MAYDAY

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,240
STARTED HERE IN THE U.S., IN
CHICAGO, IN 1886.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,900
BUT IT'S NO

26
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,700
LONGER CELEBRATED HERE, AND IN
FACT I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,030
VERY PURPOSEFUL AND INTENTIONAL
EFFORT TO WIPE IT FROM OUR

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,030
HISTORY.

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,650
IT'S CELEBRATED
WORLDWIDE, IT'S WHERE WORKERS

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,260
GATHER AND CELEBRATE THE
IMPORTANCE OF WORKERS' RIGHTS.

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,830
SO IN 1886 IN CHICAGO AT
HAYMARKET THERE WAS A

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,040
DEMONSTRATION, THAT THEY I
BELIEVE THERE WERE 300,000

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,320
WORKERS NATIONWIDE THAT WENT ON
STRIKE.

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,830
IT STARTED THERE AND A

35
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,780
WOMAN NAMED LUCY PARSONS WAS THE
LEADER OF IT, SHE WAS A FORMER

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,380
SLAVE, SHE WAS ALSO PART
MEXICAN-AMERICAN, PART

37
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,740
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, AND SHE GOT
FOLKS TO COME TOGETHER AS

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,600
WORKERS ACROSS RACIAL LINES.

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,300
AND
THAT'S VERY THREATENING TO THE

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,430
POWER STRUCTURE.

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,621
SO COPS, LIKE
THEY DID AGAINST OCCUPY, THEY

42
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:39,490
BROKE THAT PROTEST, AND THEN A
COUPLE DAYS LATER THEY CAME BACK

43
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,500
IN THE SPIRIT OF, WELL, YOU MAY
HAVE KILLED SOME OF US BUT WE

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,880
AREN'T GOING TO GO AWAY.

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,520
THE
WORKERS GATHERED AGAIN WITH THE

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,480
MAYOR OF CHICAGO, AND IT WAS A
PEACEFUL PROTEST, AND COPS AGAIN

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,400
CAME AND SOMEONE THREW A BOMB,
THE COPS FIRED INDISCRIMINATELY

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,880
INTO THE CROWD, A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE DIED, AND SEVEN PEOPLE

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,690
WERE CHARGED WITH ALL KINDS OF
CRIMES IN RELATION TO THAT

50
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,690
INCIDENT.

51
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,210
FOUR WERE HANGED,
THREE WERE LATER PARDONED

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,490
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WEREN'T
EVEN PHYSICALLY THERE -- ANYWAY

53
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,480
THE WHOLE THING WAS A DISASTER,
BUT IN AN EFFORT TO WIPE MAYDAY

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,650
FROM OUR HISTORY BOOKS IN THE
U.S. IT WAS CHANGED TO LABOR DAY

55
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,160
IN SEPTEMBER TO KIND OF
DISCONNECT FROM MAYDAY.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
AND 70

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,470
YEARS LATER IT WAS STILL ON THE
MINDS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE

58
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,640
EISENHOWER TRIED TO CHANGE
MAYDAY INTO NATIONAL LAW AND

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,680
ORDER DAY, MAY 1, WHICH SOUNDS
NOT FUN AT ALL.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,490
NOW YOU COULD JUST GET
TOGETHER AND WATCH A LOT OF LAW

61
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,490
& ORDER.

62
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,210
IT GIVES IT A WHOLE DIFFERENT
MEANING.

63
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,810
SO THAT'S MAYDAY, AND TODAY
THERE ARE CELEBRATIONS AND

64
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,660
COMMEMORATIONS ALL OVER THE
WORLD, BUT IN THE U.S. IT'S

65
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,660
LARGELY FORGOTTEN.

66
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,272
WE SHOULD LEARN ABOUT LUCY
PARSONS AND MAYDAY IN OUR

67
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,272
HISTORY BOOKS.

68
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:05,150
WE JUST DID, STEVE OH, THANKS
TO YOU.

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,819
I FELT LIKE YOU WERE THE
RACHEL MADDOW OF THE SHOW.

70
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,770
WE HAVE THE SAME HAIRCUT.

71
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,140
GOOD FOR YOU.

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,190
DIRECT YOUR
TWEETS TO STEVE OH ABOUT

73
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,759
APPEARANCE, AND I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

74
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,759
ANYWAY,

75
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,340
PUERTO RICO, IN PUERTO RICO IT
WAS KIND OF REMINISCENT OF THE

76
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:42,419
VIOLENCE YOU KIND OF MENTIONED
--

77
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,240
THEY HAVE A GROUP WHICH IS A
PLAY ON THE PROMISE THAT WAS,

78
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,169
LIKE, THE BAILOUT DEAL MADE WITH
PUERTO RICO AND HAS ESSENTIALLY

79
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,520
BEEN RENEGED ON IN THE EYES OF
THE LABOR MOVEMENT THERE.

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
THEY

81
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:08,059
SAY, ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG --

82
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:12,839
BUT IT SEEMS THAT WITH THIS
NEW -- THERE'S A FEDERAL PANEL

83
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,370
THAT'S SAYING, LISTEN, WE WILL
HELP YOU OUT AND BAIL YOU OUT

84
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,569
FROM YOUR DEBT AS LONG AS WE
KIND OF ESSENTIALLY DISMANTLE

85
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,110
YOUR PENSION PROGRAMS.

86
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,330
WHICH IS
JUST UTTERLY UNFAIR, AND HAS TO

87
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,930
BE VERY FRUSTRATING IF YOU SPENT
YEARS AND YEARS WORKING AS A

88
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,430
PUBLIC EMPLOYEE, AND IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S ALL KIND OF GOING

89
00:05:32,430 --> 00:00:00,000
AWAY.
