1
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:11,498
>> Laura: THE MAJOR MEDIA ARE

2
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:12,966
SELECTIVELY REPORTING THE FBI

3
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,501
AND DOJ BRIEFING OF KEY

4
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,469
LAWMAKERS LAST WEEK ABOUT THAT

5
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:20,673
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

6
00:00:20,673 --> 00:00:22,075
WHILE TYPICAL OF TODAY'S

7
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:24,477
SCREAMING HEADLINES, ABC BLARED

8
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:26,479
GAUDI DISPUTES THE TRUMP SPY

9
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,881
CLAIM AND SAYS FBI ACTED

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,248
PROPERLY.

11
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:30,650
BUT THAT IGNORES A NUMBER OF KEY

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,252
POINTS THAT OVERSIGHT CHAIR

13
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:33,586
GAUDI MADE ON FOX GLIDE LAST

14
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:34,721
NIGHT.

15
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:39,692
THE FIRST WAS THAT THE DOJ MADE

16
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,894
CLEAR THAT TRUMP WAS NOT AND IS

17
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:45,265
NOT A TARGET OF THE

18
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:47,066
ADMINISTRATION.

19
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:48,735
HE COULD NOT ALSO EXPLAIN WHY

20
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,103
THE FBI COULD NOT DO THAT

21
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:52,138
DEFENSIVE BRIEFING OF THE TRUMP

22
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,140
CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF RELYING ON A

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,876
FORM IT INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN.

24
00:00:56,876 --> 00:00:58,344
FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR ANDY

25
00:00:58,344 --> 00:01:00,580
McCARTHY LAID OUT HIS THEORY.

26
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,449
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,417
THEY SPIED ON THE CAMPAIGN.

28
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:05,318
IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT A

29
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:09,455
CORPORATION AND THEY THOUGHT THE

30
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:10,890
CORPORATION WAS CORRUPTED BY

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,659
THREE PEOPLE, YOU GO TO THE CEO

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,328
AND YOU SAY, I THINK WE HAVE A

33
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:15,762
PROBLEM HERE.

34
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:19,866
BUT THEY DIDN'T SAID INSTEAD WAS

35
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:22,168
SEND COVERT OPERATIVES TO PRY

36
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:22,635
INFORMATION OUT.

37
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:25,471
>> Laura: THAT'S WHY THEY WERE

38
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,740
UNHAPPY THAT GAUDI KIND OF MUDDY

39
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,875
THE WATERS.

40
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,443
ONE OF THEM IS DAN BONGINO OF

41
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:33,780
NRA TV, AND ALSO JOINING US IS

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,215
DANIEL GOLDMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT

43
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:36,683
ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN

44
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:37,483
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

45
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:40,086
IT'S GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

46
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,322
DAN BONGINO, FIRST.

47
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,490
LET'S GO TO YOU.

48
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,492
WE INVITED GAUDI ON THE SHOW,

49
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:48,127
AND WE WANT HIM TO COME ON

50
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,964
BECAUSE HE'S A VERY SMART GUY.

51
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:54,834
KIND OF CONFUSING HOW HE COMES

52
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:57,971
ACROSS, BUT WHERE DO YOU COME

53
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:03,676
DOWN ON SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE

54
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:06,880
SAID ABOUT THE SPYGATE

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,247
SITUATION?

56
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:08,948
>> APPEARANCE IS NOW BEING USED

57
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:11,484
AS PROPAGANDA BY THE LEFT, AND

58
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,287
WHAT HE SAID WAS SO COMPLETELY

59
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:14,921
OUT OF LINE AND FACTUALLY

60
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:15,588
INCORRECT.

61
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:18,992
LAURA, LET'S RUN THROUGH SOME

62
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,661
BASIC FACTS.

63
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,330
SO THE FBI RENTED BY THE BOOK,

64
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,099
THE WAY AMERICANS WANTED HIM TO

65
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,100
RUN THE INVESTIGATION.

66
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,268
REALLY?

67
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,069
THEN WHY DIDN'T THEY NOTIFY

68
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,071
CONGRESS ABOUT -- FOR EIGHT

69
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,474
MONTHS, WHEN PRIOR PROCEDURE WAS

70
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:36,709
TO NOTIFY CONGRESS QUARTERLY ON

71
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:37,744
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS.

72
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:38,244
ANOTHER QUESTION.

73
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:39,679
IF THEY RAN IT BY THE BOOK, HOW

74
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,882
IS IT THAT TWO SUSPICIOUS

75
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:43,850
POTENTIALLY FELONY WEEKS OF

76
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,752
INFORMATION HAPPENED IN BOTH

77
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,887
OCTOBER AND JANUARY TO

78
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:48,488
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND

79
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,088
"WASHINGTON POST"?

80
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:52,458
IS THAT AN EXAMPLE, MR. GOWDY,

81
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,693
OF A FINELY TUNED INVESTIGATION

82
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:56,696
RUN THE WAY AMERICANS WOULD HAVE

83
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:58,698
WANTED, HIDDEN FROM CONGRESS?

84
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:00,133
HE DID NOTHING BUT FEED THE

85
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:00,900
LEFTIST PROPAGANDA MACHINE

86
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,335
YESTERDAY AND HE SHOULD GO BACK

87
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:06,940
AND CLARIFY THOSE OUT

88
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,607
OUTRAGEOUS, ABSURD REMARKS.

89
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,475
>> Laura: I THINK HE'S

90
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,277
OBSESSING OVER THE DEFINITION OF

91
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:13,279
SPY WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE

92
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,113
COMMITTEE VERSUS AN INFORMANT IN

93
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:16,282
AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION, WHICH

94
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,951
I THINK IS BEYOND THE POINT.

95
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:22,188
I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU A

96
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:22,822
SOUND BITE FROM FROM JASON

97
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:23,189
CHAFFETZ.

98
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,192
>> IF JEFF SESSIONS IS THERE IN

99
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,094
NAME ONLY, IS ABSOLUTELY

100
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:28,461
WORTHLESS.

101
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,129
THE SOONER THE PRESIDENT NEEDS A

102
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,497
NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE

103
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:32,298
BETTER.

104
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:34,100
HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER RECUSED

105
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,336
HIMSELF, HE NEVER NEEDED TO ANY

106
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:37,437
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION.

107
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:38,137
>> Laura: THIS IS OF COURSE

108
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:40,306
REGARDING THE TRUMP TWEET TODAY,

109
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:44,277
COMMENTING ON WHAT GOWDY DID SAY

110
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,679
WHICH MANY OF US TOOK NOTE OF,

111
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,881
WHICH IS, YOU COULD HAVE THAT IN

112
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:51,084
A TOP LAWYER BE THE

113
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:52,051
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

114
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,253
MEANWHILE, YOU PICK A GUY WHO

115
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:54,921
EVERYONE LIKES BUT RECUSED

116
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:58,291
HIMSELF RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

117
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:58,825
FOR REACTION?

118
00:03:58,825 --> 00:03:59,692
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

119
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,494
DO HIS HOMEWORK A LITTLE BIT

120
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,297
MORE BECAUSE THIS WAS AN OBVIOUS

121
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:05,064
RECUSAL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF

122
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:05,665
JUSTICE REGULATION.

123
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:07,500
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A

124
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,502
SURPRISE TO HIM OR HIS LAWYERS.

125
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:11,504
SO THE FACT THAT HE THEN

126
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,539
ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS RECUSING

127
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,041
HIMSELF, BECAUSE HE WAS AN

128
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,142
INTEGRAL PLAYER IN THE CAMPAIGN

129
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,611
AND THEREFORE COULD NOT OVERSEE

130
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,012
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE

131
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:23,583
CAMPAIGN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A

132
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:23,950
SURPRISE.

133
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,087
THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT I SEE AS

134
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:28,921
A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR

135
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,924
ABOUT THE WAY THAT TRUMP VIEWS

136
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:32,558
SESSIONS AND THE ATTORNEY

137
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,861
GENERAL IS HE SEEMS TO BE

138
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:36,696
TALKING A LOT ABOUT WANTING

139
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,865
SOMEONE WHO IS LOYAL TO HIM.

140
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:40,867
WHICH, ON ITS FACE IS FINE, HE

141
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,703
GETS TO CHOOSE HIS CABINET, AND

142
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:44,103
I GET THAT.

143
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:46,472
BUT WHAT HE IS REALLY INDICATING

144
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:47,707
AND EMPLOYING AND MAKING THAT

145
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,675
STATEMENT IS THAT YOU WANT

146
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:52,178
SOMEONE LOYAL TO HIM AT THE TOP

147
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:52,879
OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHO

148
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,083
WILL SQUASH AN INVESTIGATION

149
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,086
INTO EITHER HIM, OR HIS

150
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,789
CAMPAIGN, ASSOCIATES, CHILDREN,

151
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,090
OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE.

152
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,692
>> Laura: WAIT A SECOND.

153
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:09,028
WAS ERIC HOLDER PERCEIVED TO BE

154
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,898
LOW

155
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:12,865
LOYAL TO BARACK OBAMA?

156
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,501
I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE THAT

157
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,103
ERIC HOLDER WENT ABOVE AND

158
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,304
BEYOND WHAT THE LEFT IS NOW

159
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,906
SAYING THAT TRUMP SHOULD NOW

160
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:20,907
HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

161
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,275
SESSIONS.

162
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:23,576
SO I THINK THAT LOYALTY WENT

163
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:26,712
REALLY DEEP BETWEEN THE TWO OF

164
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,681
THEM, WHETHER IT WAS THE IRS

165
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,016
INVESTIGATION, HOW THEY HANDLED

166
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:31,884
FAST AND FURIOUS, HOW THEY DID

167
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:33,286
THE ROADS AND OVERSIGHT, WHETHER

168
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,487
THE PRESIDENT KNEW ANYTHING

169
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:35,321
ABOUT THIS AND WHETHER THEY WERE

170
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,523
EVER BRIEFED ON IT.

171
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:38,324
YOU COULDN'T GET INFORMATION OUT

172
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:41,494
OF THESE PEOPLE SO I THINK

173
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:44,097
LOYALTY MATTERED TO OBAMA OFF

174
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:44,664
THE TOP OF THE JUSTICE

175
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:45,064
DEPARTMENT.

176
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:48,768
>> I THINK LOYALTY IN SOME

177
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:49,268
RESPECTS MATTERS.

178
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:52,505
>> THE PRESIDENTS WING MAN,

179
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:53,639
THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED HIMSELF.

180
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,575
>> WHILE I DON'T KNOW BUT WHEN

181
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:59,045
TRUMP IS SAYING THAT HE WANTS

182
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,213
LOYALTY, AS A FORMER ORGANIZED

183
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,280
CRIME PROSECUTOR, I HEAR

184
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,118
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN

185
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,487
WANTING SOMEONE WHO IS CLOSE TO

186
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:08,888
HIM, WHO IS LOYAL TO HIM.

187
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:10,490
THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE THAT I

188
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,492
THINK YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE,

189
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:14,260
BOTH OF YOU, IS THAT

190
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,894
BARACK OBAMA WAS NOT UNDER

191
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:15,628
INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT

192
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,096
OF JUSTICE.

193
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:20,299
SO WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

194
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,301
DAN, HE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.

195
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,369
SO YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

196
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:28,474
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

197
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:30,877
INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESIDENT

198
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:31,611
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

199
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,013
>> Laura: WHILE HE IS ALSO THE

200
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:34,914
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE

201
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:37,083
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, OF THE

202
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,085
GOVERNMENT.

203
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,120
AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

204
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,289
SO IF HE WANTED TO, HE COULD

205
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:45,491
FIRE ANYONE HE WANTS.

206
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:46,292
IS IT POLITICALLY APPROPRIATE?

207
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,194
I THINK DANIEL GOLDMAN'S RIGHT,

208
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,896
IT WOULDN'T BE POLITICALLY

209
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:50,763
APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT.

210
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:54,500
BUT IF HE WANTED TO GET RID OF

211
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,269
COMEY, OR ROSENSTEIN WHO WAS A

212
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,703
DISASTER FROM THE BEGINNING, HE

213
00:06:57,703 --> 00:06:58,905
COULD GET RID OF THEM.

214
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:00,439
WE COULD GET RID OF SESSIONS IF

215
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,208
HE WANTED.

216
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,709
>> WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THOUGH IS

217
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,679
HE IS COMPLETELY ABOVE THE LAW

218
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,882
AND HE COULD FIRE ANYBODY FOR

219
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:10,683
CORRUPT PRACTICES.

220
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:12,385
>> DAN, YOU ARE JUST MAKING

221
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:13,519
STUFF UP NOW AND I WISH SHE

222
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,153
WOULD STOP DOING THAT.

223
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:16,889
YOU SAID BEFORE THAT, THE

224
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,158
PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

225
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:20,526
TO QUASH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

226
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:21,527
I'M GUESSING YOU ARE NOT

227
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,496
FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THE

228
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:25,097
CASE BECAUSE, IT'S ALREADY OPEN

229
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:26,332
SOURCE THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID

230
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,534
MULTIPLE TIMES THAT IF THERE WAS

231
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,836
A RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE ASSET IN

232
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:31,437
HIS CAMPAIGN TRYING TO

233
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:34,473
COMPROMISE HIS CAMPAIGN, HE

234
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:36,509
WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

235
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,810
SO, DAN, YOU MAY BE HEARING THIS

236
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,111
FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WILL

237
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,447
GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO RETRACT

238
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:42,281
THAT.

239
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:44,550
BUT WHO QUASH IS AN

240
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,985
INVESTIGATION WELL ASKING THE

241
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,119
FBI SIMULTANEOUSLY TO

242
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:47,620
INVESTIGATE THAT.

243
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,822
I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER.

244
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:51,257
>> Laura: I THINK HE WANTED TO

245
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,125
BE FAIR AND HE WANTS AN

246
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,494
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO DOESN'T

247
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:56,596
MELT WHEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

248
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:57,697
EDITORIAL BOARD GETS UPSET ABOUT

249
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,066
A RECUSAL THAT HE NEVER HAD TO

250
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:00,566
DO.

251
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:01,334
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE

252
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:05,371
WANTS AND WHAT MOST PRESIDENTS

253
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:08,474
WANT.

254
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:11,644
>> HE HAD TO DO IT UNDER THE

255
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:12,211
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

256
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:13,980
REGULATIONS.

257
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,284
>> Laura: NO HE DIDN'T.

258
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,253
BECAUSE -- WHAT DID HE HAVE TO

259
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,487
DO WITH RUSSIAN COLLUSION?

260
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,856
HE HAD ZERO TO DO WITH IT.

261
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,024
I THINK IT WAS CONVENIENT.

262
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,892
>> I THINK IT HAD TO DO WITH IT

263
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:29,095
THE FACT THAT HE WAS AN INTEGRAL

264
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:31,697
PART OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE

265
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,299
CAMPAIGN WAS A SUBJECT TO

266
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:34,734
INVESTIGATION.

267
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:37,068
>> Laura: WAS STARTED WITH A

268
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:37,736
RIDICULOUS INFORMANT WHO WAS

269
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:40,706
TROLLING FOR GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT

270
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:41,073
AND MONEY.

271
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:43,676
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

272
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:44,977
>> Laura: YOU ARE SAYING JEFF

273
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:49,749
SESSIONS WAS INTEGRALLY

274
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:50,283
INVOLVED.

275
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,684
THAT WAS A PRUDENTIAL DECISION

276
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:54,654
THAT HE MADE AND I WOULD SAY --

277
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:57,890
I DON'T THINK IT WAS REQUIRED AT

278
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,157
ALL.

279
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,226
>> ALL RIGHT, READ THE RAGS,

280
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,394
THEY ARE VERY CLEAR.

281
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:03,129
>> Laura: HOW MANY OF THE

282
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,097
OBAMA PEOPLE EVER RECUSED

283
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,566
THEMSELVES, RARELY IF EVER?

284
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,135
>> YES BUT OBAMA WAS NEVER

285
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:10,369
INVESTIGATED.

286
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:12,471
I'M JUST SAYING TO YOU IF THERE

287
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:13,339
IS A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT THAT

288
00:09:13,339 --> 00:00:00,000
HAS INFORMATION OF WRONGDOING IN
