Laura: WE RECENTLY WITNESSED THAT WEIRD SPECTACLE OF ALLEY THEY'LL SEE READING SCRIPTURE TO ATTACK THE ADMINISTRATION'S IMMIGRATION POLICY. THEN JEFF SESSIONS QUOTING THE DEBATE. LET'S DISCUSS THAT NOW WITH A PAIR OF VERY DISTINGUISHED RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND I'M DELIGHTED THEY ARE BOTH WITH US. COUNCIL AND DR. ENGEL. DR. ENGEL, LET'S START WITH YOU. YOU ARE ACTUALLY, I THINK A SUPPORTER OF THE PRESIDENT BUT YOU DISAGREE WITH HIS POLICY THAT IT INITIALLY, AT LEAST, SEPARATED FAMILIES, CHILD IN ONE AREA, PARENTS MORE AND A FORMAL AND HE IS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING HE WANTS TO UPHOLD THE LAW OF THE LAND, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. I THINK THE ISSUE THERE WAS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION WHICH HE WANTS TO DO AS IT RELATES TO BORDERS. AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT PROTECTION, AND HOW DO YOU BRING THE HUMAN ELEMENT INTO THIS SITUATION, SO YOU CAN PROVIDE HUMAN DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND OUR PRESIDENT WILL STEP UP, IN A OUR LEADERS WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND PROVIDE THAT PROTECTIVE AND COMPASSIONATE PIECES TO THIS LEGISLATION. Laura: PASTOR SCOTT, THIS IS BISHOP MICHAEL CURRY WHO IS JUST SLAMMING JEFF SESSIONS OR INVOKING THE BIBLE. LET'S WATCH. TO OUR CHRISTIANS TO QUOTE ROMANS 13 OVER JESUS OF NAZARETH AS IF JESUS OF NAZARETH DOESN'T EXIST, THAT IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC. IT'S FLAT OUT HIGHLY UNBIBLICAL, UNCHRISTIAN AND UN-AMERICAN. Laura: YOUR REACTION TO THAT? AND I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BIBLE BELIEVER. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO REFER TO SCRIPTURE AS A BASIS TO VALIDATE ANY ACTIONS THAT YOU ENGAGE IN. ONCE AGAIN, IF YOU ARE A BIBLE BELIEVER, WE OFTENTIMES USE SCRIPTURE TO VALIDATE ACTIONS OR ACTIVITIES THAT WE ENGAGE IN. SCRIPTURE, BECAUSE THAT OBEY THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES. JESUS NOR THE APOSTLE PAUL ENDORSED SEDITION OR REBELLION OR A VIOLENT UPRISING AGAINST ROME AND USING THAT SCRIPTURE, NOT THE WAY. OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND SO THEY DON'T HAVE A REASON TO ACCUSE US OF ANY WRONGDOING. OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PUT OTHER MATTERS INTO THE HANDS WELCOME A STRANGER AND IT'S VERY POWERFUL. WELCOME INTO YOUR TABLE, INVITE A STRANGER TO YOUR HOME FOR WALL, REALLY NICE WALL. BUT THAT MEANS ANYONE WHO STEPS FOOT OVER THE BORDER HAS TO BE PROCESSED INTO THE COUNTRY AND RELEASED. HOW IS THAT WELCOMING THE THAT DOES NOT MEAN TO BE DEVOID OF ALL LAWS OF THE LAND TO COME UP DOES IT? ABSOLUTELY. AND I GO BACK TO THAT PASSAGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REFERRED TO IN ROMANS 13 TALKING ABOUT, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF GOD'S LAW, GOD'S LAW ALWAYS FOR PROTECTION, ALWAYS FOR PEACE ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM, ALL THE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COME LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF COLLABORATING ON PROVIDING SECURITY AT THE WALL. FAMILIES. WE ALL DO WHAT WE CAN TO DONATE TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT CENTRAL AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, AFRICA AND AROUND THE WORLD, THAT'S WHERE WE AS INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE THROUGH OUR FAITH, OUR CHURCHES AND ORGANIZATIONS. IT DOESN'T MEAN WE COMPLETELY HAVE TO SMASH OUR OWN RULE OF LAW. IF YOU HAVE A REALLY SAD LIFE AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S HORRIBLE, YOU COME IN. AND I WANT TO GET PASTOR SCOTT KNOWN AS FATHER JAMES MARTIN. HE'S NOT A BIG FAN OF TRUNK TO PUT IT LIGHTLY. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. NO ONE WANTS TO BE A REFUGEE THEY HAVE LOTS OF GUTS TO DO IT AND IT'S UP TO US TO WELCOME OF THESE CHRISTIANS WHO SAY THEY READ THE BIBLE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT BIBLE THEY ARE READING BECAUSE THE BIBLE I READ HAS JESUS REACHING OUT TO THOSE ON THE MARGINS, INCLUDING AND MOST ESPECIALLY, MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. Laura: PASTOR SCOTT, A LOT OF AMERICANS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE ON THE MARGINS. LIKE TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE WE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIGRANTS, REFUGEES AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. CRIME WHEN THEY ENDEAVOR TO SNEAK INTO THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY BUT THEY TRY TO SNEAK IN ANYWAYS. NOW ANYONE, AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IF THEY DON'T LIKE YOU ARE ENGAGED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME AND YOU ARE CAUGHT, APPREHENDED, AND YOU HAVE A CHILD IN YOUR CUSTODY, THAT CHILD WILL BE REMOVED FROM YOUR CUSTODY AND BE PLACED INTO CHILD SERVICES UNTIL SOMEONE EITHER TAKING ANY CULPABILITY FROM THE CRIME BEING COMMITTED AWAY FROM THE PARENTS AND MAKE IT JUST GRABBING KIDS AND PUTTING THEM INTO CONCENTRATION CAMPS, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL. THERE IS A CRIME BEING COMMITTED AND THE CHILDREN ARE IN THE CUSTODY. Laura: AND ITS DONALD TRUMP'S FAULT.
