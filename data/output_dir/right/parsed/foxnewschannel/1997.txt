>> Shepard: BY THE WAY, ALL OF
YOU HAVE BEEN RESPONDING ON THE
PULLOUT OF THE IRAN DEAL, THE
RECKLESS DECISION TODAY MAKES A
WORLD LESS SAFE BY WITHDRAWING
FROM THE JCP OH, OUR PRESIDENT
IS UNDERMINING AMERICAN
CREDIBILITY AND ISOLATING US
FROM OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES AND
ABANDONING COMMITMENTS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.
WE DID REACH OUT TO MR. PEREZ TO
SEE IF HE COULD JOIN US ON THE
SHOW BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE
HEARD BACK.
WE DID HEAR BACK FROM THE RNC
CHAIRWOMAN JOINS US RIGHT NOW.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Shepard: WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT REACTION, ALMOST
UNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION FROM THAT
SIDE, ODDLY ENOUGH INCLUDING
CHUCK SCHUMER WHO WAS ORIGINALLY
AGAINST THE DEAL, ONE OF THE
FOUR DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED AGAINST
BARACK OBAMA'S DEAL ON THIS.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> CHUCK SCHUMER IS PLAYING HIS
PARTISAN ROLE.
THE REALITY IS THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION ENTERED INTO A
RECKLESS DEAL WITH IRAN, ONE
THAT MADE THE WORLD LEFT BASED.
THEY DIDN'T PUT THE PROPER
INSPECTIONS IN PLACE, AND THESE
ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO PUT IN
PLACE TO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY.
IRAN HAS CONTINUED TO FUND
TERRORISM AND NOT BEEN GOOD
ACTORS.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED
ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TODAY AND
SAID WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN
A DEAL THAT IF WE GO BACK TO THE
DEAL WITH IRAN MAKES THE WORLD
SAFER.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BARACK OBAMA
SHOULD HAVE DONE, AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP ONCE AGAIN IS
TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE
WORLD AND CORRECTING THE
MISTAKES OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
>> Shepard: IF THE 90-180 DAY
WAITING PERIOD DOES NOT PRODUCE
ANY RESULTS, OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF
BUSINESS DEALS MADE WITH IRAN
WOULD BE BROKEN AND WE COULDN'T
HONOR THEM, AND THAT INCLUDES
BOEING WHICH HAS A NUMBER OF
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR CONTRACTS
WITH THE IRANIANS.
WHAT ARE WE TELLING BOEING, WHAT
ARE WE TELLING THESE AMERICAN
COMPANIES?
THAT WILL BE UP TO THE
ADMINISTRATION TO COMMUNICATE
WITH PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THOSE
DEALS.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS
THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AGAIN
AND HE'S DONE IT WITH SYRIA
COMPANIES DOING IT NOW WITH IRAN
COMPANIES DOING IT NOW WITH IRA
IRAN, AND HE HAS SAID WE ARE NOT
GOING TO STAND FOR BAD ACTORS
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE
DEALS THAT ARE NOT MAKING OUR
WORLD SAVIOR.
HE HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN ALL
OF THOSE FRONTS AND HE DELIVERED
ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND I
THINK WE WILL COME OUT WITH A
SAFER WORLD BECAUSE OF TODAY.
>> Shepard: WE HAVE ALL THESE
PRIMARIES GOING ON TONIGHT IN
FOUR DIFFERENT STATES.
EIGHT MORE NEXT WEEK, DOZENS
MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.
DO YOU THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE
THAT WILL AFFECT VOTERS OR IS IT
JUST REALLY THE ECONOMY?
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE PAYING
ATTENTION TO WHAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS DONE WITH
COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA.
AND WITH SYRIA TAKING THAT
DEFINITIVE ACTION WHEN THEY USE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
BUT I DO THINK THE ECONOMY IS
THE OVERRIDING ISSUE.
PEOPLE IN STATES LIKE OHIO,
WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA
WHO ARE VOTING TODAY, THEY KNOW
THAT JOBS ARE COMING BACK TO
THEIR STATES, THEY KNOW THAT
WAGES ARE UP AND PEOPLE ARE
GETTING BETTER PAYCHECKS AND
THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE THE
COUNTRY IS GOING.
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL SEE NOT
JUST THROUGH THE PRIMARY SEASON
BUT THROUGH NOVEMBER WHEN THEY
GO TO THE BALLOT BOX AND SAY,
WHO IS THE PARTY THAT DELIVERED?
AND THEY WILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO
THEIR VOTERS FOR THAT.
>> Shepard: THE FORMER COAL
INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE WHO WAS IN
PRISON FOR, DOES HE PROVIDE
SAFETY STANDARDS THAT LED TO
THAT COAL INDUSTRY ACCIDENT
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
IF HE WINS, WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE
HIM, WHAT THE
PRESIDENT RECOGNIZE HIM AS A
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SENATOR
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SENATOR ?
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF
ANY ELECTION TAKING PLACE
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE OUT VOTING,
BUT WE WILL SUPPORT NOMINEES
THAT FURTHER PRESIDENT'S AGENDA.
WE KNOW JOE MANSION WON'T DO
THAT, AND HE WOULD VOTE FOR
CHUCK SCHUMER TO BE THE LEADER.
SO LET'S MAKE SURE THE VOTERS
HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT
DECISION WITHOUT WEIGHING IN
BEFORE THE VOTE IS DONE.
>> Shepard: UNDERSTOOD, BUT IF
HE IS THE GUY, YOU WOULD STILL
PREFER HIM TO JOE MITCH?
>> I'M GOING TO SUPPORT PEOPLE
WHO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S
AGENDA.
JOE MANSION TALKS A GOOD GAME
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE
VOTES, HE VOTED NO FOR HIGHER
WAGES, MORE JOBS, A BETTER
ECONOMY.
HE HAS VOTED NO AGAINST HIS
STATE AGAIN AND AGAIN.
I THINK HE IS A NICE GUY, I HAVE
HIM OVER FOR A BARBECUE BUT
DON'T SEND HIM BACK TO THE
SENATE.
I LOVE THESE MAY PRIMARIES
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO FIND WHO
ARE ENEMIES ARE GOING TO BE AND
COALESCE AROUND THEM.
COME TOGETHER, WE NEED ALL HANDS
ON DECK BECAUSE WE NEED TO BEAT
THAT DEMOCRAT INCUMBENTS AND
GIVE THE PRESIDENT MORE HELP IN
THE SENATE.
>> Shepard: YOU PROBABLY HEAR
THE BACK AND FORTH AS
JOHN McCAIN HAS BEEN PLANNING
HIS OWN FUNERAL, APPARENTLY,
SUFFERING FROM BRAIN CANCER.
YOU KNOW THE STORY.
BUT HE HAS APPARENTLY MADE KNOWN
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THE
PRESIDENT AT HIS FUNERAL.
THE VICE PRESIDENT, YES.
BUT NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
>> I HAVE A HARD TIME WEIGHING
ON ON SOMETHING I'M NOT PRIVY TO
FIRSTHAND.
I THINK RIGHT NOW, THE WHOLE
COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE
JOHN McCAIN AND HIS FAMILY AND
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.
HE'S AN AMERICAN HERO, HE
SUFFERING THROUGH OBVIOUSLY A
VERY SERIOUS BRAIN TUMOR AND
CANCER.
WE WANT HIM TO HEAL.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THINKING
ABOUT HIS FUNERAL, I WANT TO BE
THINKING ABOUT HIS RECOVERY.
>> Shepard: THE SAME APPLIED
TO HIS REGRETS APPARENTLY IN HIS
BOOK ABOUT PICKING SARAH PALIN,
ALTHOUGH HE HAS GREAT RESPECT
AND ADMIRATION FOR HER STILL,
THAT MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE PICKED
JOE LIEBERMAN AS HIS RUNNING
MATE?
>> I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HIS
BOOK, OBVIOUSLY HE HAD AN
HISTORIC CAREER IN THE SENATE,
AND BEFORE THAT SERVING OUR
COUNTRY.
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING
HIS INSIGHTS ON WHAT HE WISHES
HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY.
I WISH HE HAD A VOTED AGAINST
OBAMACARE, OF COURSE, BUT IT
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
HIS BOOK COMES OUT.
OVERWHELMINGLY, THIS COUNTRY IS
THINKING ABOUT HIM AND HOPING HE
RECOVERS.
HE IS IN OUR AND PRAYERS.
