money it's now former homeland security secretary under President Obama and jeh Johnson mr. secretary good to have you with us good morning Willie so before you were homeland security secretary but also under the Obama administration in 2010 about 1200 troops National Guard troops were sent to the border correct you believe it's a good idea for President Trump to do the same in this case well the reality is as you and Joe have pointed out many times over the last 24 hours apprehensions on our southern border are a fraction of what they used to be the high was FY 2001 point six million then over the next 15 16 17 years through investments in border security by the Bush Clinton Obama administrations which included building a wall pursuant to the secure Fence Act of 2007 we act 2006 we actually built a wall in the places where it makes sense to build a wall surveillance technology aerial surveillance more Border Patrol agents ask any Border Patrol expert any border security expert they'll tell you what they need more is surveillance vehicles roads lights and possibly people and this idea of putting the military on the border is problematic for several reasons one you know when you talk about military and the border it conjures up an image of soldiers in uniform standing there with bayonets on the Rio Grande we actually have a law against what we refer to as a Posse Comitatus where the US military cannot engage in domestic law enforcement for good reason that's been true since 1878 and so if you deploy the guard to the border they can do no more than support and though illegal migration is a fraction of what it used to be the demographic is totally changed the stereotype in need the traditional model were single adults from Mexico with the improving economy in Mexico over the last 15 16 years which has also contributed to the downturn what we see now are women and children from Central America coming in and a lot of them don't really expect to evade capture in the first place and that's the issue we have to address I in Central America with aid to Central America we began that at the beginning of the last administration with Congress and if you really want to move deportations through the system we need more immigration judges that's the bottleneck in this whole system putting more national guard on the southern border I feel like I've seen this movie before so under certain circumstances though it is a good idea to send the National Guard in other words in 2010 it was appropriate because of the number of crossings that were happening or do you believe fundamentally that troops on the border is not a good idea fundamentally what we need more of is aid in Central America these women and children are coming here because they are desperate to get out of Central America it's as bad as places in in Syria and I've spent hours and days in southern Texas with these women and children asking them why did you come here right and the story very often is my mom sent me here because she told me the gangs were gonna kill me and there is no amount of there no number of National Guard personnel they're going to deter that frankly in the longer term perceived changes in in migration policy send a shock through the system at last short turn you see short term downturns but then it always reverts back to its traditional patterns which is what we're seeing now yes Steve Schmidt you know we hear the generals are always fighting the last war that's the case with the president in Syria but that's also the case in immigration he he's got some idea that it's still 1996 when as as secretary John said I mean and as we've been saying for some time again border crossings illegal border crossings are at a 46 year low and border crossings from illegal immigrants from Mexico also moving towards record low rates for at least over the past 25 30 years the war that Donald Trump is fighting is a war that no longer exists it's it's far more diffused look the United States has had a long and complicated relationship with Mexico but one of the things that certainly true is that over the last thirty years we've had an uninterrupted arc of improved relations and one of the things that has contributed mightily to the decrease of illegal immigration is a liberalized Mexican economy a privatized energy industry it's on the verge of becoming a wealthy nation what Donald Trump will have precipitated when the Mexicans choose their next president is the election of someone lopez obrador who is anti-american hostile to free-market capitalism likely to do great damage to that Mexican economy and of course with the Mexican economy crashes where do Mexicans go do they go to El Salvador do they go to Brazil or they try to come to the United States they try to come to the United States so Donald Trump is going to be the architect of the problem that that that he frequently denounces and lastly on all of these policy issues profoundly so they are disconnected from reality when you read the tweet about China we're down five hundred billion dollars these are the musings of an imbecile right this is this is completely profoundly detached from economic reality from the bilateral reality of the trading relationship between the United States and China and when you have someone incompetently making decisions incompetently applying ideological solutions to too deep and serious problems when you have all of that combined what you will get is real pain in the American economy and for the American people ultimately and maybe at the end of the day when we look from a national security perspective we'll see someone precipitate in national security prices that could get a lot of people killed well that sort of gets to my question to you which is if you just step back and look bro what do you think is the biggest threat to the homeland right now we've seen that Facebook now is saying that 87 million users may have had their information and properly shared is it cyber is it the border and what is it cyber in my private life that's the threat everyone wants to know about cyber security cyber security cyber security in many facets I believe that the cyber threat to our homeland is going to get worse before it gets better the cyber threat is coming from a range of actors including nation-states criminals hacktivists and so forth and we've yet to turn that corner so that that is my that's the concern everyone is talking about and that was as I was leaving office probably my biggest concern why isn't the government doing more I mean you were pretty open we had to run several months ago that maybe the Obama administration could have done more Adam Schiff came out and said the Obama administration should have done more about Russia's intrusion now that we know what we know about what Russia has done according to our intelligence services why do you suspect more hasn't been done to batten down the hatches well I've been impressed that the Treasury Department in our departing national security adviser gave a pretty strong speech on this the other day is stepping up doing more to deter Russian behavior when you're talking about a nation-state and defending our cybersecurity all nation-states whether they're communist regimes dictatorships respond to sufficient deterrence and so clearly more is necessary we put on a number of sanctions in the end of the Obama administration but mores got to be necessary if you believe our intelligence chiefs they're still at it with the 2018 election and so I've been pleased that we're stepping up our deterrence in response to this in response to what happened in the United Kingdom but a lot more needs to be done in election infrastructure cybersecurity and the private sector as well and in fact HR McMaster the National Security Advisor said two days ago we have failed to impose sufficient costs against Russia
