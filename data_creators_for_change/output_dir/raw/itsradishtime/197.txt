23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,460
these big heavy metal doors to get into

24
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,550
school but somehow my foot was weirdly

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,399
angled and when I open it the metal door

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,590
just kind of like sliced along the top

27
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my foot and I didn't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

walking and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> my day until maybe half</font>

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,750
an hour later I noticed this big mass of

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,970
red<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was spreading along the tights</font>

34
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,830

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,740
a pretty nasty scar when I was playing

38
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,890

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,270
where the swings were and so there's

44
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,759
this big ledge before you got to the

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,280
rest of the ground and it used to be fun

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to run and jump off the ledge and land</font>

47
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,520
