now in that neutrality we had very bad news recently I did PI the head of the FCC let it charge to get rid of net neutrality which means that now we don't have freedom on the internet and the Internet service providers like Verizon AT&T and Comcast can control how fast or slow the different websites are how much they can charge different people they're not mandated to be to treat everyone equally or to treat each website equally so the only thing that they have is their guide is to maximize their own profit so they could do that any way they like so that can obviously lead to a disastrous dismantling of the internet for their benefit not for our benefit so some folks in Congress have decided to fight back some good news on that front the hill reports Senate Democrats have put together 50 votes for a measure meant to block the Federal Communications Commission's December decision to end net neutrality rules put in place by the Obama administration of course they don't have the tiebreaker in the Senate the Republicans do so they're gonna need one more vote they explain here Democrats are just one GOP vote shy of the 51 vote threshold for a Senate resolution of disapproval which would strike down the FCC's December rule changes so super important now don't get too excited there's a huge caveat there in a second but Edie Markey senator from Massachusetts is leading the charge here he's been fantastic on this issue I beat up on the Democrats all the time rightfully so but credit where credit is due is senator Marquis doing a wonderful job in fighting for freedom on the internet and it doesn't matter if you're a conservative or liberal probably right-wing sites would be the first targeted if there were any issues of corporations wanting to clean things up and make the internet more safe right so mark you fighting for all Americans there and he has gotten some Republicans to join including Susan Collins but he does need one more colleague to come to that side to win in the Senate but the measure if it passed the Senate faces a murky future as it would have to pass the GOP held house and get president Trump's signature go into effect so there's still plenty of hurdles and obviously the biggest one being Donald Trump but look this is how you build momentum if it winds up passing the Senate at least they're moving it then you go to the house and you might be surprised that there might be somebody some degree of bipartisan agreement there as well whether it's enough to win in the house the different question but even if you don't win in the house you set it up for a vote and after the 2018 elections you use it as an election issue you route the Republicans and then you bring in new congressmen who will vote in the opposite direction and if you build up enough momentum yes you could even override the veto of the president so at a minimum there at least on the road now look a lot of this has to be done within 60 days to get rid of a regulation is it gonna get done at 60 days where you win in the Senate yes you can win in the Senate in 60 days you just need one more brave Republican or one funded by the internet companies let's keep it real the reason we have a fighting chance here is because we also have giant companies on our side so they have Verizon Comcast AT&T etc and the good guys have Facebook Google Netflix who don't want to take away net neutrality look I don't care why they're on the right side I just care that they are and and so and by the way to be fair and open and honest The Young Turks have business dealings with almost all of those companies so on both sides but in this case the Internet companies want to keep freedom on the internet and and almost the entirety of the internet agrees there's a couple of people pretending to be in favor of protecting the internet but want to hand it over to those private corporations but they haven't really convinced the right wing either good luck Ted Cruz keep trying by the way Ted if there's no freedom on the internet you might not be able to watch the accidental porn you tweeted out the other day I'm just saying so finally I want to go to Ed Markey for one last quote on this he says Republicans now have a clear choice be on the right side of history and stand with the American people who support a free and open Internet or hold hands with a special interest who want to control the internet for their own profit well that's nearly a perfect description of what's going on here and I don't have to spend too much time commissioning you guys because like I said right wing left wing in the middle almost the entire internet agrees yes we would like to have freedom on the Internet the only people who don't agree are the corrupt politicians who have taken money from the Internet service providers and with those legalized bribes they've decided now we'd rather give the Internet away to them so they can make more money and give us more legalized bribes perhaps we shouldn't base our elections on private financing they might wind up working for private interests think about it wolf dash pack.com get money out of politics let's go back to democracy and actually have real debates over the issues and not have the corruption we have now you just watch the video by The Young Turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full
