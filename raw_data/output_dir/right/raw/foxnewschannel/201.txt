1
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:11,527
>> STEVE: LAST NIGHT SATURDAY

2
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:12,194
NIGHT LIVE DIDN'T SURPRISE

3
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:12,928
ANYONE, OPENING UP THEIR SHOW

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,595
MOCKING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,297
KANYE WEST.

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:16,765
>> SOME PEOPLE CALL IT CHAVEZ

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,699
BUT THE MURDER RATE IS GOING

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,036
DOWN 20% EVERY YEAR.

9
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:21,937
YOU SOON IT'S GOING TO BE A

10
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,939
NEGATIVE MURDER RIGHT.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,673
WERE GOING TO BE TAKEN BODIES

12
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:29,144
OUT OF THE GROUND.

13
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:29,678
>> HE DOESN'T STOP.

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,083
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ANYONE BUT

15
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:38,220
HIMSELF.

16
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:38,854
LUNACY REMIND ME OF?

17
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:39,588
>> I DON'T WANT TO BREAK BUT I

18
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:40,055
HAVE A HIGH IQ.

19
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:40,556
I'M STABLE GENIUS.

20
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:46,295
I HAVE A BIG BRAIN.

21
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:52,568
>> OH MY GOD, HE'S BLACK ME.

22
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:53,268
>> STEVE: LET'S BRING IN OUR

23
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:54,036
COHOST OF THE FIVE AN AUTHOR OF

24
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:54,803
THE NEW BOOK, WHAT THE HELL DO

25
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:59,241
YOU HAVE TO LOSE.

26
00:00:59,242 --> 00:00:59,975
OUR FRIENDS JUAN, LET'S HAVE A

27
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,409
HEATED DEBATE.

28
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,176
LET'S START WITH THE KANYE THING

29
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:06,715
IN MAKE SURE WE GET CLEAR ABOUT

30
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:07,382
WHAT YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT.

31
00:01:07,383 --> 00:01:09,618
I THINK THE WAY KANYE WEST HAS

32
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,019
BEEN TREATED AND YOU KNOW I

33
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,892
TOTALLY DETEST RACISM WE'VE HAD

34
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:17,659
GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT IN

35
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,026
THE PAST.

36
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:18,860
I THINK THE WAY HE HAS BEEN

37
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,062
TREATED HAS BEEN RACIST.

38
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:27,035
HE'S BEEN SINGLED OUT FOR HIS

39
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:29,538
BELIEFS BECAUSE HE'S BLACK.

40
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,272
THAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM FROM

41
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:30,939
THE LIBERAL COMMUNITY.

42
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,607
>> I DON'T THINK SO STEVE.

43
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:32,407
CLEARLY IF HE HAD US SPECIFIC

44
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:33,075
BELIEF OF SUBSTANCE OR AN

45
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:34,977
ARGUMENT TO BE MADE AND

46
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,580
ESPECIALLY A POPULACE ARGUMENT

47
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,348
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF

48
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,583
BLACK PEOPLE WHO WANT THE KIND A

49
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:44,486
POPULACE RESPONSE THAT YOU

50
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,921
ADVOCATE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

51
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:50,559
HIS AGENDA WAS.

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,326
I THOUGHT IT WAS A TROUBLING

53
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,629
SESSION.

54
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,097
USING PROFANITY, USING THE RED

55
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:59,034
MAKE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

56
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:12,214
WAS HIS SUPER HERO.

57
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:12,948
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THERE

58
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:13,682
WAS REAL SUBSTANCE IN THERE.

59
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:14,283
HE TALKED ABOUT FAMILY

60
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:14,883
BREAKDOWN, BUSINESS AND

61
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,384
ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

62
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:23,759
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY SERIOUS.

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,526
WHEN YE USE WORDS LIKE TROUBLED

64
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:25,327
AND THAT THAT'S THE BIT THAT I

65
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:25,827
FIND PATRONIZING.

66
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:26,495
YOU SAY THE KEY HAS TO BE

67
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,195
MENTALLY ILL OTHERWISE YOU AND

68
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:27,929
HAVE A BLACK PERSON SUPPORTING

69
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,463
TRUMP.

70
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:29,097
>> I SAID HE, HE'S BEEN

71
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,199
HOSPITALIZED BY HIS OWN

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,602
ADMISSION, HE TALKS ABOUT

73
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:37,773
BIPOLAR DISORDER.

74
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:38,907
AFTER HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE HE

75
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,675
WENT OVER TO AN APPLE STORE, GOT

76
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:40,442
ON A TABLE AND STARTED RANTING.

77
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:41,176
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE

78
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:46,715
SAY WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY.

79
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:47,449
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE POINT.

80
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,319
I THINK THAT WOULD BE INSULTING

81
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,587
I THINK THE POINT IS THE

82
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:52,954
SUBSTANCE.

83
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,190
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING

84
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:55,991
ABOUT VIOLENCE, THIS IS PART

85
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,492
OF A DISTORTION.

86
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:03,432
TRUMP IS NOT TALKING TO THE

87
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,099
BLACK COMMUNITY EVEN WITH

88
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,800
KANYE WEST SITTING ACROSS TO

89
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:05,067
HIM.

90
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:06,168
HE'S TALKING TO WHITE

91
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:06,935
AMERICANS WHO SAY RACE

92
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,538
RELATIONS ARE WORSE UNDER THIS

93
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:09,905
PRESIDENT.

94
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:10,572
THEY DISAPPROVE OF HOW HE

95
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:11,006
HANDLES RACE.

96
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,676
HERE'S TRUMP SAYING I HAVE A

97
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:18,680
BLACK FRIEND, LOOK AT HIM, A

98
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,681
BLACK FRIEND IN A RED HAT,

99
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:20,482
DON'T WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

100
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:21,717
SAY I HAVE A PROBLEM WHETHER

101
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,685
IT'S WITH RACE OR

102
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,152
IMMIGRATION.

103
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,922
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY

104
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:27,289
OFFENSIVE.

105
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:33,695
LET'S GET TO IT IN A SECOND.

106
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,597
THEY BROUGHT IT OUT A BIT AND

107
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,066
TELL US THE ARGUMENT.

108
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:44,439
>> THE ARGUMENT IS HE WAS

109
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,008
SAYING THIS TO BLACK AMERICA

110
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,012
YOU LIVE IN BLACK AND AMERICAN

111
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:51,713
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MORE

112
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,849
VIOLENT THAN AFGHANISTAN, YOU

113
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,319
HAVE NO JOB, YOUR SCHOOLS ARE

114
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,053
TERRIBLE, YOUR STREETS ARE

115
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,454
FILLED WITH TRASH AND YOU BEEN

116
00:03:59,455 --> 00:03:59,788
BOATING.

117
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:00,155
DEMOCRATS.

118
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,158
COME OVER TO MY SIDE AND VOTE

119
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,492
FOR ME.

120
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,826
I THINK HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE

121
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,627
WHITE PEOPLE COME HE NEVER

122
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,530
WENT TO A BLACK COMMUNITY TO

123
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,831
SAY THAT OR SPOKE TO A BLACK

124
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:14,536
CONVENTION ABOUT IT.

125
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:15,604
I THINK HE WAS SAYING I,

126
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,773
DONALD TRUMP AND NO SNOW

127
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:18,073
FLAKE.

128
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,107
I'M GOING TO POINT OUT THE

129
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,542
PROBLEMS OF THE BLACK

130
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,376
COMMUNITY AND FAITH THE THREAT

131
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,911
TO ALL OF US AND STAND UP

132
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:28,784
THERE AND RAPPEL IT.

133
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:35,090
HE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT MOST OF

134
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:41,596
BLACK AMERICA, CLEARLY.

135
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:42,631
>> BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT AN

136
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,432
UNDENIABLE FACT THAT SO MUCH

137
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,066
OF THE DISADVANTAGE THAT HAS

138
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,001
HURT BLACK PEOPLE AND BLACK

139
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:48,503
FAMILIES HAS COME ABOUT AS A

140
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:52,541
RESULT OF POLICIES IN CONTROL

141
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,478
FOR DECADES BY THE DEMOCRATS.

142
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,016
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD TO

143
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:03,852
SEE MENTAL ILLNESS EXPLOITED

144
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:07,989
IN THAT WAY.

145
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,757
HE HAS TALKED ABOUT MENTAL

146
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:12,294
ILLNESS AND THERE HAS BEEN

147
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,061
SOME GOOD POINTS DISCUSSED,

148
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,162
BUT LET'S KEEP IT REAL IN THE

149
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,598
FIELD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

150
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,667
WATCHING.

151
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:25,740
THE SIMPLE FACT THAT HE WENT

152
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,541
AGAINST WHAT THE BLACK AGENDA

153
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,576
OR THE BLACK DELEGATION TOLD

154
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,643
US WE CAN AND CANNOT SAY,

155
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:29,177
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A

156
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:30,078
DISAGREEMENT OR AN OPINION

157
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,812
THAT'S DIFFERENT ON WHAT THE

158
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:31,513
DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT TELLS

159
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:32,914
YOU WHAT TO DO IT, YOU ARE

160
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,418
AUTOMATICALLY OSTRACIZED.

161
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,420
I'VE LOST MY CONTRACT BASED ON

162
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:49,865
WHAT I SAID AND ONE BEEN TOLD

163
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:50,499
HE WAS A SELLOUT.

164
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,099
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT.

165
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,633
WE ARE NOT BIPOLAR.

166
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,534
LET'S ASK JUAN, ARE YOU

167
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:53,301
MENTALLY ILL QUEST MARK IS

168
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:54,402
THAT WHY PEOPLE DRAG YOU ALL

169
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:55,036
OVER TWITTER BECAUSE YOUR

170
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:55,337
BLACK?

171
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,104
IF YOU'RE BLACK AND HAVE A

172
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:56,872
DIFFERENT NOTE PINION OTHER

173
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:57,873
THAN WHAT THEY'RE TOLD YOU TO

174
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:02,644
SAY YOU GET OSTRACIZED.

175
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,746
I DON'T AGREE WITH KANYE

176
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,681
ANYMORE THAN I DID WITH

177
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,384
JAY-Z.

178
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:10,285
SAME BOOTS ARE BEING LICKED,

179
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,821
JUST A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT.

180
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:22,764
>> HOLD ON, WAIT, YOU.

181
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:23,298
MUCH SUMMED IT UP.

182
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:23,932
YOUR PASSION IS OBVIOUS.

183
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:24,699
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

184
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,033
BEFORE.

185
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:25,800
THE FACT THAT HE'S THERE AND

186
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:26,434
INSPIRING OTHER BLACK

187
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:27,235
AMERICANS TO COME OUT AND

188
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:28,169
SUPPORT WHO THEY WANT TO

189
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,271
SUPPORT, THE INDEPENDENT

190
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,006
ANCHORS, I THINK THAT'S GREAT

191
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,541
HOWEVER I THINK KANYE GOT WHAT

192
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:33,475
HE WANTED AND THAT'S THE

193
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,177
UNITED STATES TALKING ABOUT

194
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:36,578
KANYE WEST.

195
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,512
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE STILL

196
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:47,122
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

197
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,290
I WISH WE ARE TALKING LESS

198
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,324
ABOUT THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE

199
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,159
ISSUES THAT IMPACT REAL

200
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,793
PEOPLE.

201
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:52,527
>> I WILL JUST SAY THAT

202
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,462
THERE'S A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO

203
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,298
DO NOT FIT IN A CONSERVATIVE

204
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,600
OR LIBERAL BOXES.

205
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:02,170
MY FEELING IS THEY TEND TO GET

206
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:07,108
LOCKED OUT OF OUR POLITICAL

207
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:10,312
CONVERSATION.

208
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,279
>> IS A REALLY GREAT BOOK BY

209
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,180
THE WAY AND EVERYONE CARES

210
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:12,948
ABOUT IMMIGRATION, YOU OUGHT

211
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,448
TO GET THIS BOOK.

212
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,182
IT'S SERIOUSLY GOOD.

213
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,585
THE IDEA OF ANNIHILATION, AND

214
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:20,789
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO EXIST

215
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,356
ALONG PEOPLE OF OTHER

216
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,090
POLITICAL OPINIONS, THE TRUTH

217
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:23,091
IS WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT

218
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:28,830
DIVERSITY.

219
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:29,931
IT CAN BE A SOURCE OF STRENGTH

220
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:31,132
BUT WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT AND

221
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,901
NOT STIGMATIZE IT OR DEMONIZE

222
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:33,234
IT.

223
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:39,274
>> WE HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME.

224
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:39,975
>> I WAS REALLY APPRECIATIVE

225
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:44,913
OF THAT COMMENT.

226
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:45,680
THERE WAS SUCH HYPOCRISY WHEN

227
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,247
YOU HEAR CONSERVATIVES

228
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,183
ABSOLUTELY THROWING THEIR ARMS

229
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:49,117
AROUND KANYE, KANYE WEST, THE

230
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,986
GUY WHO SAID GEORGE W. BUSH

231
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:51,786
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK

232
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:55,156
PEOPLE, BUT ALSO WENT KANYE,

233
00:07:55,157 --> 00:08:01,997
JAY-Z AND OTHER RAPPERS CAME

234
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:02,998
TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH OBAMA

235
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:03,999
THAT WOULD LIKE THESE GUYS ARE

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,699
THUGS THEY TALK ABOUT

237
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,667
GANGSTERS AND USE THE N WORD.

238
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,536
I THOUGHT BOY THIS IS CRAZY.

239
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:09,471
NOW THEY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND

240
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,138
KANYE, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS

241
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:10,705
POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE.

242
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,339
IT'S NOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE.

243
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,806
THAT'S THE KEY.

244
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:12,540
I'M SOMEONE WHO DOES GET BEAT

245
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:18,146
UP BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN

246
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:18,647
OPINION.

247
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,247
THEY ARE WHAT I THINK.

248
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:19,914
I WILL TELL YOU.

249
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:20,682
I DON'T TRY TO OBEY ANY

250
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:21,049
ORTHODOXY.

251
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,917
WHEN IT CAME TO KANYE, I DON'T

252
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:23,752
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE AGENDA

253
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,021
OR SUBSTANCE WAS OTHER THAN

254
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,188
PROMOTING KANYE AND TALKING

255
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,224
ABOUT HIS EGO AND HIS DESIRE

256
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,626
TO HAVE TRUMP AS A FATHER.

257
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:32,961
>> ALL RIGHT.

258
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:36,197
IT FELT TO ME LIKE THERE WAS

259
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,299
SERIOUS SUBSTANCE THERE.

260
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:38,732
>> LIKE WHAT.

261
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,435
NAME ONE THING.

262
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:46,174
>> ON FAMILY.

263
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:46,574
[INAUDIBLE]

264
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:46,908
HANG ON.

265
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:47,442
ABSOLUTELY HE WAS.

266
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,645
HIS OWN FAMILY, NOT TO MENTION

267
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:52,781
EVERYONE ELSE'S, HOW MUCH THAT

268
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,281
HAS HURT HIM.

269
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:53,915
IT WAS DEEPLY EMOTIONAL.

270
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,616
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE

271
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,151
TALKING ABOUT IN POLITICS ON

272
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,686
WELFARE AND BUSINESS AND

273
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:58,353
ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CRIME.

274
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:08,163
THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES.

275
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:08,863
>> HE WOULD'VE SAID THAT'S

276
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:09,164
GREAT.

277
00:09:09,165 --> 00:00:00,000
HE DID NOT DO THAT.
