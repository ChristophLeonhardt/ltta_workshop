Betsy DeVos has hired a number of individuals who used to work at for-profit colleges throughout the country and then proceeded to squash any investigations into fraudulent behaviors or activities by said for-profit colleges now for-profit colleges are different from traditional public and private universities in that they have investors they are solely there to turn a profit and any money that they make outside of the revenue used to pay for their costs to operate goes into the pockets of these investors so a lot of these for-profit colleges in the past have gotten into a lot of trouble because they essentially lied to students during the recruiting process lied to them about job placement numbers they inflated statistics they also convinced a lot of these students to take out tens of thousands of dollars in federal student loans and then proceeded to give them a degree that in a lot of cases weren't even accredited and wouldn't get them hired so under the Obama administration there were some new regulations to help stop this behavior from happening but then Trump gets elected Betsy DeVos gets named as the education head of the education department and then she undoes or decides to undo those regulations now according to a recent report by the New York Times the unwinding of the team this was an investigatory team within the Department of Education killed investigations into possible fraudulent activities at several large for-profit colleges where top hires of Betsy DeVos had previously worked just to give you a little more information about these investigations the investigation into DeVry University for instance ground to a halt early last year later DeVos named Julian Schmoke a former dean at DeVry as the team's new supervisor so the guy who used to be a Dean at DeVry gets named the supervisor of this team that's supposed to investigate for-profit colleges like DeVry and specifically DeVry itself no that's the thing about the Trump administration they rub the corruption in your face and they go what are you gonna do about it Trump can shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his idiot followers will say that that guy had it coming and so did they're not paying attention they don't care they don't care how corrupt Donald Trump is he just made a deal with the Chinese and sold out American jobs that was the core of his promise and he did it so he can get money from the Indonesians they don't care so here they're like well there are no rules left nobody's minding the shop and everybody's worried about porn stars in Russia etc just run roughshod so who should we get to investigate the riot look at the demon the bride did was the bride that's a nice little joke on the rest of us so the investigation into DeVry wasn't the only investigation that ended investigations into Bridgepoint education and career education corporation also went dark by the way that schmuck guy isn't the only person who got hired by DeVos and who has a past working for these four prophets robert Edel was a top lawyer for for-profit universities he got hired into the education department Diane Ayers another example Carlos mu√±oz is another example these are all Betsy DeVos hires who had very comfy cozy ties with for-profit colleges that again defrauded students put them in a massive amount of debt and gave them in some cases if the students finish the the program degrees that wouldn't get them hired so I want to give you guys a little more background on for-profits I used to talk about it a lot in the past and then after Obama passed some regulations you know luckily a lot of these schools shut down a lot of them had to pay huge settlements including DeVry by the way but Fox did a really great video kind of giving you an explainer as to why these schools are so problematic take a look compared to other colleges for-profit institutions attract more low-income people veterans and other non-traditional students also known as proprietary colleges for-profit institutions are operated by private profit-seeking businesses which means earnings get passed on to owners or shareholders that sets them apart from most universities and colleges which are nonprofits those state schools community colleges and private nonprofits are funded by a bunch of different sources in addition to tuition like donations investment income or government subsidies but for-profit schools rely almost entirely on tuition and fees paid with federal student aid money so they have a strong incentive to recruit more students and set them up with large financial aid packages which happen to veterans military benefits so they specifically target federal money in order to make a profit so that's important because that federal money comes from where it comes from you the tax payer so these corporate shills are getting rich off of your taxpayer money by defrauding students but it shouldn't surprise you under the Trump administration it shouldn't surprise you that they would push for these types of deregulation and stop any investigation into you know institutions that defraud students Trump himself had to pay a massive settlement because of Trump University which was a fraudulent for-profit College so it's just it's all disgusting and these students in a lot of cases aren't able to get rid of this debt even if they were defrauded right student loan debt is the only form of debt that people cannot get rid of even if they file for bankruptcy and when you look at the these statistics in terms of those who default even though about 11 percent of students go to for-profit colleges about half of the defaults come from these institutions students who went to these institutions so let me give you a couple other quotes that I think are really interesting so we're gonna go to graphic 50 years 61 here so if you're wondering well I mean do they really do it those are they really differ on people well DeVry agreed to pay a hundred million dollars in 2016 to settle a separate Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging that it misled prospective students with ads about employment and salaries after graduation now here's what for-profit corporations do not do pay one hundred million dollar fines if they didn't do it they've got an army of lawyers so they figured oh that's so small part of what we took off the students our scam so we'll pay them so those investigations definitely should have continued the education department and and they were snuffed out so when asked about Elizabeth Hill a spokeswoman for the Education Department had one of my favorite quotes she said well yeah this team has been greatly diminished it's down to three people that are doing the investigations and and it's again the people who used to run those institutions so by the way real quick they don't even do investigations anymore the only thing they do is student loan forgiveness application processing in fact that's what this quota bet is about she says conducting investigations is but one way the investigations team contributes to the department's broad effort to provide oversight what would be the other way not conducting investigations it's called the investigations team she just said well do we really need to conduct investigations they're so brazen they don't care the corruption is right out in front of everybody for you to see finally I want to give a quote from senator Elizabeth Warren who's been fighting against these scams for a long time because I I do want to give credit to progressives who have had enough of this crap and and are fighting back forcefully and there's not a lot of them most of the Democrats love to work with the Trump administration while they huff and puff about resistance but in this case Warren said secretary DeVos has filled the department with for-profit college hacks who only care about making sham schools rich and shutting down investigations into fraud there you go that is exactly right senator Elizabeth Warren fighting the good fight there but in this case all those investigations will come to an end and the fraud will continue thanks to the Trump administration two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of
