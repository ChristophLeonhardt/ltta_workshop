one of the great things about our democracy is it expresses itself in all sorts of ways and that includes people protesting I've been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years and I suspect that there's not a president in our history that at some point hasn't been subject to these protests so I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign and I wouldn't advise them to be silent what I would advise what I advised before the election and what I will continue advised after the election is that elections matter voting matters organizing matters being informed on the issues matter and what I consistently say to young people I say it in the United States but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life I think there is a tendency because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful at least in advanced countries where living standards have generally gone up there is a tendency I think to assume that that's always the case and it's not democracy is hard work in the United States if 43% of eligible voters do not vote then democracy is weakened if we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in sound bites and snippets off their phones if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems if people whether they are conservative or liberal left or right are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents then democracy will break down
