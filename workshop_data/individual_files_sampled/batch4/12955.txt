Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has now introduced a new Democrat program called a better deal we being hysterical tears Schumer delivered a speech to the group of a soggy stuffed animals he keeps hidden in his bedroom closet saying quote we have called our new program a better deal in the hope the word deal would make people think of Donald Trump so they might like us for being him instead of hating us for being who we really are unquote the sobbing Schumer went on to say quote when you lose an election like the one we lost in 2016 you can't blame James Comey or the Russians or anyone else you have to look in the mirror unflinchingly and blame Hillary Clinton who you can see behind you in the mirror trying to sneak away before anyone blames our unquote in a position paper that the segments of the Democrat Party that is called the Democrat Party released to the segments of the Democrat Party that is called the news media the democrat party democrat party told the news media democrat party how it would now attempt to appeal to working-class americans who voted for Donald Trump rather than to the Democrat base which is six guys who wear dresses and an 80 year old homeless man who agreed to vote 17 times in return for a bottle of Jim Beam the position paper outlined a program whereby the Democrats would raise the minimum wage so businesses would hire fewer people than raise taxes on the businesses so that there would be fewer businesses then use the taxes from the businesses that are no longer there to give welfare to the people who aren't working because Democrats raise the minimum wage and there are no more businesses falling to his knees and pounding his chest as he wept Schumer told his dripping security blanket quote capitalism isn't working sure it's made much of the world richer than it's ever been but it isn't working because it doesn't let us steal middle-class people's money in order to buy votes from the poor with useless programs that foster dependency illegitimate and crime we need to have more government involvement in the economy so we can drive those cool 50s cars they have in Cuban Venezuela and stage fun activities like food riots and show trials unquote noting the success of Donald Trump's make America great again campaign Schumer said the demo would try to catch some of that magic by wearing orange wigs and pretending to love the country we want to make a better deal with working-class Americans Schumer said the deal is will pretend not to hate you and you'll vote for us and then we'll hate you again president Trump responded to the Democrats new plan by humiliating all his friends firing all his political allies and hiring the guy from the hot dog stand outside of Trump Tower to run the new Department of relish so on the Republican side everything is pretty much the same as usual trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin all right off your dosed off this cut reflected enough what's that about I thought wait a minute these words aren't moving now I won't know what I was wondering now I write these things on sometimes I wonder can I remember no all right it smell bad day that was great now so you made up for with an absolutely great woo if you want to get your questions in the mailbag you have to subscribe to the daily wired.com and I can answer your questions the answers are guaranteed 100% correct and will change your life on occasion for the better Bajau subscribe lousy ten bucks a month lousy ten bucks a month if you subscribe for a year which is only allows a hundred bucks a month you get the leftist two years mug which will keep your leftist ears cold hey by the way well I'm asking you for things let me ask you for a favor if you like this show if you enjoy the show go on iTunes and give us some good reviews you know they people don't think about it they I get a lot of really nice letters you send me nice letters and it's embarrassing for me to write back in your letters and say is it you know put in a good review in iTunes so I'll just do it here and just embarrass myself here it's true it's true for my books as well the great good thing you liked it go on Amazon and give it a good review they really help it really promotes promotes the show so I have to talk in speaking of my books I have to say I was speaking I was thinking about watching the incredible it was just an incredible Shakespearean drama taking place in Washington DC and I was thinking about a book I wrote called Empire of Lies which is one of my favorites of my books and I book that I felt I got it did well it it sold ok but it it got a kind of ignored it was a elderly conservative book and the book I've written before and when people didn't know I was conservative got something like 300 major reviews 300 review reviews and 300 major venues this book got one review in a major venue and I was called a right-wing crackpot okay and I thought the problem with it is I think the book is really good I think you know I think it's a really complex book it is not just blindly conservative it's about a conservative but I talked about as problem but it's called Empire of Lies because there's an exchange in it where he goes and he talks to a college student and the college student explains to him why people get destroyed when they stand up against the left wing machine and the kid says to him there are a lot of powerful people who believe things that aren't true things like one culture is as good as another or there's no such thing as good and evil you only have to think about the statements for two minutes to see that they can't possibly be true but these powerful people think they should be true and they think they'll seem to be true if no one is allowed to say that they're not true so they attack anyone who says that they're not true they call him names they demand apologies from him they make his life a misery so it's like the emperor's new clothes but instead of clothes it's the Emperor's lies and in an empire of lies only a crazy man would speak the truth and crazy people do crazy things the powerful people don't destroy the crazy people for saying that their false ideas are false they destroy him for doing something crazy but you have to be crazy to say their false ideas are false because if you do they'll destroy you and so that is what I couldn't help thinking this about Donald Trump you know Donald Trump the thing that people love about Donald Trump is that he just said the words that number dying to hear that we're being told we couldn't say Islam is associated with terror how hard is that it was in front of everybody's eyes and they were telling us it was virtue in lying about it not just not just that we should lie about it but that was virtually good to lie about it people criminals were coming in from Mexico we know as all Mexican people aren't criminals that they're not criminals because they're Mexicans but we know that people who break the law tend to be criminals and when they broke into the country some of these people were criminal people and if you go into a California prison a lot of these people are Hispanic you know and that's what was happening and he said the thing that people didn't like they didn't like their laws being violated you just came out say he called Hillary a crook you know that was it but anywhere is to do that in order to violate and remember you know again and again and again the people saying this is the end of Trump's career oh my god this is the end and we kept saying and people kept saying no this is what we like we like this meaning it's the reason why he swept all those more stately statesmen who were running against him away is because we recognize people recognize and I shouldn't say we because at that point I didn't but people recognize that this guy was a bull in a china shop of Lies and all the China was lies it was breaking them people like that but but entails a certain kind of wild hair in the guy that I think you know sometimes sometimes is great and sometimes threatens what he's trying to do and yesterday was just so dramatic we were talking about this a little yesterday as part of what we're talking about that Trump learned stuff and he's learning how to be president and part of being president is holding the Republican senators and congressmen feet to the fire and saying to the people using a bully pulpit of the presidency to say to people these guys promised you and promised you had promised you and now they're not going to do it and all they were trying to get is a vote to continue debate on health care in the Senate to open debate on health care in the Senate so John McCain he can't make this stuff up John McCain who is in Arizona because he's got a brain tumor right and he's got this big they had to take a blood clot out he's got some big scar on his face he comes flying back to cast of for a bill he doesn't even like he says he will not vote for it as it is but he comes flying back and essentially he makes the speech and talk about Shakespeare right the guy the Senate the institution of Congress was leveled by Barack Obama by polarizing the country the wave Obama did the guy was supposed to bring the country together by making putting the Republicans in a position where he would not negotiate with them and he would negotiate and then pull the rug out from under their feet the only thing they could do was oppose him and now the Democrats are fighting back you know turn around this Fair Play now all the Democrats will do is obstruct and opposed there's no conversation between what used to be this collegial body the the people people the partisans the people on the far left in the far right always would get furious at the Senate because they would negotiate they would say here we reaching across the aisle you're negotiating with the enemy you know and that but that was the collegial Senate that's how they got things done that's gone so here is this 80 year old McCain standing in the ruin of this institution that he loved and it's levelled and it's just if you picture it it's really just like you know pillars lying on their side and dust everywhere oh you know light coming in through the broken ceiling and he makes this speech is sad speech where he calls on them to be the Senate that he knew again so here let's let's play a couple of clips of this cuz we're really what's something let's start with clip number 6 our system doesn't depend on our nobility it accounts for imperfections and gives us in order to our individual strivings that has helped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on earth it is our responsibility to preserve that and even when it requires us to do something that's satisfying than winning even when we must be of a little to get a little even when our efforts managed just three yards in a cloud of dust while critics on both sides announced us for timidity or our failure to triumph I hope we can again rely on humility on our need to cooperate on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us stop listening to the bombastic loud mouths on the radio and television and the internet to hell with them they don't want anything done for the public good our incapacity is their livelihood so the thing is I find so touching about this and I listen I have plenty of you know problems with John McCain he has always genuinely annoyed me as a politician but I say this it's rude to say it I know we're supposed to say he's fighting can't they he's probably dying you know he's probably dying he's a tough guy he knows the score he knows that like he's up against something where he's got something that like I said the survival rates for this kind of brain cancer he has or in single digits he's in the you know he's an old man he know he knows what he's looking at he's not like sitting there thinking oh this is you know this is the best time of my life the best is yet to come he knows reason this is his valedictory he came to say goodbye to the to the Senate and it's really really moving now part of what's moving about it is is that he's speaking to an institution no longer exists it not that the Senate doesn't exist but the Senate that he talked about the news media that he talks about you know people on the right obviously he's striking out at the Trump with the lines about winning and if you can't watch if you're just listening he makes a little quote you know scare quotes in the air talking about winning this we have to be beyond winning and all this stuff but when he talks about the idiots on the radio of course you immediately go to the right wing you immediately think of Rush and Mark Levin and you know all of us I mean I hold the whole family of right wing commentators who are were you know Russia's children as it were but what he doesn't understand is is the front page of the New York Times is exactly the same they're fighting back against the front page of the New York Times which is just as biased look I go I do not pretend when you come here you are getting an objective version of the news you're getting my version of the news rush does not pretend that he is giving you all the news that's fit to print he is giving you the rush limbaugh version of the news same with Sean Hannity the New York Times flies they pretend that their front pages all the news that's fit to print they say it right there but it is just as biased as rush just as biased as Hannity and worse because those guys are honestly giving you their opinion and The Times is pretending it's the news so that's what's at you know it's out of date to sit and strike out at rush to sit and strike out at Sean or any of these guys you know that when you have a new you know McCain has always played to the new york times he's always one of the new york times to like him so that landscape that he's talking about he's standing in the ruin of it and making this farewell speech to an institution that's gone and when he calls out for civility you know it is just it's so touching because i'm sure they're all moved to hear about this but it's just not going to happen because chuck schumer is sitting on the other side and he's not going to do one damn thing to help you know help trump get his agenda moving so here's McCain's call for civility let's trust each other let's return to regular order we've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle that's an approach that's been employed by both sides mandating legislation from the top down without any support from the other side with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires we are getting nothing done my friends we're getting nothing done and all we've really done issue is confirm the old horses to the Supreme Court our health care insurance system is a mess we all know it those who support Obama care and those who oppose it something has to be done we Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price we haven't found it yet and I'm not sure we will all we've managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn't very popular when we started trying to get rid of it so he comes this ailing you know probably dying senator comes to make this valedictory speech flies in and through hook and by crook they get together 50 votes and they get this thing out there and of course Mike Pence cast the deciding vote I mean you can't be like I said you can't make this stuff up it's a tremendous even though later on in the day they voted down they lost a vote that would they never expected to win it on a repeal and replace but but even so this is a tremendous victory for Trump a tremendous you know confirmation of what I was saying that he is learning how to do this president thing that this is the important thing that he does it's not about you know tweeting it's not about anything like that but this is the important stuff he does she wins Trump wins and then and then like a character in Shakespeare his character flaws threaten his own victory I'll talk about that in a minute but I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube where you've been watching video for free you can come over to the Daily wire comm and here's the rest of the show and for a lousy 10 bucks a month you can just watch the whole show you don't have to be cast out like this into the exterior darkness where there's great weeping and gnashing of teeth come over to the Daily wire calm all right the mailbag is still to come I should have said that before you signed off but I forgot the mailbag is still to come all your questions answered answers guaranteed correct and then oh yeah that's right I knew you were trying to tell me something and I never listened to you that's why I just try to ignore them and hope that it'll just stop saying things but but in fact we're going to try and take questions live if you're there and you want to send in some questions live we will do our best to see if our new technology can handle this without exploding if you just see a large flash of light you killed us all right we do have questions that were sent in already but we'll also take extra questions so what is Trump doing while he scores this victory he shows yes I can be President I can move you know this forward it's a longshot that this health care thing will actually get passed but at least it's still in there look two days ago everybody was saying it's dead it's gone it's finished you know Trump pushed it through and I think you have to just the credit lies very largely with him obviously all the got Mitch McConnell and all that you know they had a lot to do with it but it was Trump pushing them through that's how you and what is he doing he is doing this thing with Jeff Sessions that is just embarrassing I mean he obviously has lost his temper over the fact that his family Jared Kushner has been pulled into this nonsense Russian probe and again I don't blame him but we all lose our temper you know hit to be a big boy he's President of the United States it's not the same as when he was as when he was a candidate you know he these these people if he if he fires Jeff Sessions or forces Jeff Sessions to resign and everybody saying he's going to resign I'm not sure I believe that but if that happens what do you think is going to happen what do you think is going to happen if he fires Jeff Sessions nobody worth his salt it's going to want to be in that position Rudy Giuliani maybe Julie only 70 years old he's making a lot of money he's done the stuff that's gonna make him great man he doesn't really want to be involved in this anymore maybe he'd do it maybe but is he gonna get confirmed I don't know Rex Tillerson has been kind of making noises there have been rumors that he was going to quit he says no he's just taking a break but obviously working for Trump is not a picnic it's not a picnic he's got a great staff a great cabinet that he appointed if they start to abandon ship this presidency will go down and they will these are big guys isn't that guys were going to be pushed around by Donald Trump or anybody else much Tillison doesn't give a rat's what the whole trunk does if he's having a bad time if he feels he can't get work done he's going to lead so here is Trump attacking he's been attacking and attacking sessions on the fact that he recused himself from the Russian investigation the sessions did that because he forgot that he had in fact had a meeting with the Russian ambassador you know obviously had nothing to do with any of this but he forgot it and then he asked said oh okay well now that I've made a mistake under oath I'm gonna have to recuse myself so here is Trump attacking him for that in a press conference but I am disappointed in the Attorney General he should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me prior to taking office and I would have quite simply picked somebody else so I think that's a bad thing not for the president but for the presidency I think it's unfair to be and that's the way I feel you know he said this thing into in an interview with The Wall Street Journal I mean everybody points out the Jeff Sessions was saying early Trump's he signed on to the campaign early he was faithful to Trump when Trump got in trouble with that you know entertainment I tape whatever it was where he talked about grabbing women you know sessions stood up for him stayed in there formed a lot of this policy Trump said this in an interview with The Wall Street Journal he said you know he said sessions were senator from Alabama I had 40,000 people at a rally in Alabama sessions looks at 40,000 people and he probably says what do I have to lose and he endorsed me so it's not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions a crappy thing to say you know it I mean it's typical of Trump it is typical of his of nasty Trump when Trump is being nasty but this is a guy who did support him this is not the opposition this is not going after Hillary and this is the other thing you know he says he after saying he didn't want to go after Hillary which would not be a good idea I know a lot of people want to see Hillary in prison not a happy thing for democracy to have its candidates go to prison whether you think it's she deserves it or not I think she does deserve it I think she does it I don't want to see her go to prison and and now he's attacking sessions for not cracking down on the leaks which by the way session says he's doing you know sessions is doing a lot of the stuff he just that you know the AG doesn't always announce what he's doing but now he has to announce it so the Trump can hear it it's being done but here he is attacking the leaks I want the Attorney General to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before at a very important level these are intelligence agencies we cannot have that happen you know many of my views in addition to that but I think that's one of the very important things if they have to get on with I told you before I'm very disappointed Bernie general but we will see what happens time will tell Time Warp town so I just I just find this heartbreaking you know that that as he is getting better at his job he is also you know at like a Shakespeare character is also you know cannot there's things that he can't change about himself and that he doesn't really realize that this is not the way the president should treat the Attorney General and again forget about whether you think he's right or not forget about whether you think sessions is good doing a good job or not this is not what he should be focusing he shouldn't be distracting the the Senate shouldn't be giving the Senate an excuse not to vote on the health care bill the Senate says oh there's so much drama in the White House we can't focus you know these guys these guys it's natural for them not to want to take political chances he's got to be hurting them every minute not talking about this stuff what really touches me about this also is that Trump was in Ohio and to this rally in Ohio and he was the usual Trump stuff I'm not going to play cuts from that but I have to read this piece from Selina Zito at the New York Post who did something that none of these reporters ever do she went to Ohio you know she's got chases is there a place between New York and LA I thought it was a black hole she is reporting on the people turning out for this event she says the town was on fire by 1:00 in the afternoon on Tuesday every main thoroughfare downtown was filled with happy people heading toward the coselli Center folks dressed in red white and blue criss cross the main grids as vendors sold make America great again ball caps American flags and bottles of water thousands had filled the gravel parking lot to wait until the doors opened at 4:00 license plates revealing they had traveled from as far as Indiana Michigan Pennsylvania and West Virginia she starts to interview some of these people I am very pretty happy shucks - Donald scour and a retired Youngstown police officer who drove his green pickup truck up and down champions Street with a wooden Trump pen sign straddling the bed of the truck he says I am very happy with the president's performance so far he has set the exact tone I was looking for although I'll be honest I wish he didn't tweet all of the time but that is hardly anything to complain about Skowron said he is encouraged by reading about Trump's constant meetings with industry leader as well as Union and Trade members we have a president this is the scour and talking again we have a president invested in trying to navigate between the people who create jobs and the men and women doing the jobs and how repealing regulations help both six months after Donald Trump was inaugurated as 45th president he received a hero's welcome on in this town the advance ticket requests of over 20,000 and exceeded the 6,000 C capacity this I mean this this is amazing okay this is after eight years of listening to you know I I'm going to tell you which mentally ill child should use which bathroom in your little neighborhood okay so here is Dave Torrance another interview he's black he says he gets his fair share of criticism from folks when they find out whom he supports he got more when he told the view is driving to see Trump in person at a rally the man says they don't understand why I think he is doing okay they don't think because I am black that I should support him I am polite about it but I tell them that politics isn't about color it's about accomplishments and I think Trump is doing the right things he finds him refreshing he says I don't care for the hatred directed towards him or the people who supported him there have been plenty of precedents I did not vote for but I always want them to be successful so that our country is successful so Voice of America you're listening to and they're waiting for this they are sick and tired of the Russian garbage they're sick and tired of the hatreds he's getting from the press and they love that this guy is their voice he is speaking for them you know he went to this Boy Scout Jamboree thing and gave this speech and it was you know if the place was rocking the place was rocking so the left-wing press is going oh it's like a Nazi youth rally so now you have the left-wing calling the Boy Scouts the Nazi dude I mean he's got these guys trolled into insanity he's got them trolled into insanity if he can keep doing stuff like that he'll win Oh every state in the Union except for New York and California you know I mean he has it in his hand and he may just blow it by alienating the people who are his allies the guys like sessions the guy like Tillerson you know the people who he's pointed who were such great appointments if he a lien aids them if he humiliates them if he treats them like the underlings who he can slam he will blow this presidency up right on the border of success it's an incredible drama it's incredibly entertaining to watch I hope he succeeds I hope he pulls himself together but it is something it is something else I cannot remember the last time just governing in a free country was this dramatic the mailbag is um let's see um Reef Adler big king Clavin nice it should be old king claim I see the world as containing absolute good and evil but I don't understand the view that good is in charge why isn't the universe a battle between good and evil truth being a neutral absolute power instead of an all-powerful and good God wow that is I think manage Shiism I think that's called and it is a heresy and so I'm sorry Rafe we have to burn you at the stake that is I that's part of the mailbag I didn't include you know that we do solve your problems but if you commit heresy we have to kill you so that all right I will it is kind of a answer to that question is of course complicated and I'm probably not the best / I mean I'm a thrill director I'm not a theologian I'm not a philosopher I'm just a barefoot teller of tales but I will try and answer this question you know first let me say this when we talk about religion nowadays it's very offensive when they say oh you know to the left politics is religion global warming climate change is a religion what we mean by that is it's irrational our religion the Christian religion and I would say this is true the Jewish religion is not irrational at all our faith is faith that our logic will be true that our logic that the human logic can describe the world so much of this stuff has been reasoned out by people over centuries and our faith is that just because we can't see it doesn't mean that our logic doesn't hold so it's reasonable the world can't be divided the Manatee and if that's what if I'm right if that's what it's called to get heresy cannot be true the world cannot be divided equally between good and evil because of what good is because of the nature the definition of the word good and the definition of the word evil good is in everything is the highest attainment of the essence of something so the highest attainment of the essence of what it means to be a man is to unite with God that would be his purpose his cause his good that would be as good take take morality out of it for just a minute just take it take a circle let's say everybody in this room draws a circle chest draws her probably excellent and attractive circle Austin draws you know something we can barely recognize as a circle I draw a circle they're different colors and all this stuff none of them is the perfect circle even if my computer draws a circle it will not be a perfect circle there'll be something wrong with it but we all know there is a perfect circle we have it in our heads we all know these no matter how badly we draw the circles we all know there's supposed to be circles and we all know that they are part of what Plato would call this form of a perfect circle that is the good it is trying to attain the good there there is a good circle of the circles get good as they attain that perfection there is no worse circle there only is a circle that doesn't exist right I mean you if it has some form close to a circle it has some good in it okay that is the way you have to think about these things okay so being itself existence itself is like that the ultimate existence the ultimate existence is the good right that is what it is the fulfillment of the good there is no the highest being the highest being is the good being not just because he's the highest but because it is the nature of goodness to be the absolute fulfillment of Deen okay I hope that make it business am I making sense okay good there is no absolute evil person even Satan even Satan is a fallen angel he is a broken good thing even Satan in like if you read Paradise Lost he suffers in his evil because there's still something in him that knows the good there is nothing and then there is bad and then growing up the level to good and that's why the Manichaean the heresy is wrong that's why we're not in a you know truth is not just empty it is there is a good and ultimate good and that ultimate good is the ultimate being and the ultimate being is the ultimate intelligence and that is God that's my answer I hope that made sense like I I feel like you know I feel like we have I'll bring a philosopher on in a few weeks and we'll talk to him about it but that's as good as I can do all right supreme overlord Clavin as a Christian I often think of Ephesians 4:1 where Paul urges followers of Christ to live a life worthy of the calling you have received though I accept my salvation through Christ often struggle with what it means to be a good person and live a worthy life what are your thoughts on this thanks for all you do Luke we all do of course we all struggle but not only knowing the good but doing the good once we know it Paul himself struggled with it and said the good that he wanted to do he didn't do in the bad that he didn't want to do he did do that's the nature of eNOS sinful creature just trying to remember this the word the name Satan if I'm getting this right means accuser it is the accuser he is the accuser Satan is the one who is in your head when you were tormenting yourself with guilt guilt is like pain it's there for purposes there to let you know that something is wrong so fix it you cut yourself right and you say oh that's correct what's wrong oh I've cut my finger you don't then sit there and say oh the pain ah the pain I think I'll just sit here and think about the pain I'll live with the pain you fix your fingers you don't like you hold yourself accountable vain you live with the pain forever guilt is the same way you do something wrong you fix it you try and do your best to not do it again that's what you do that voice that torments you over this that torments you about your your flaws the things that you can't fix in yourself that voice is not God's voice that is not God's voice that is the voice of your accuser he does that to keep you from turning toward the love and forgiveness that God is offering there so that is what I would say we all struggle to do right we all struggle to know the right but you know it yet that voice that tangles you up and guilt a tangle it keeps you from proceeding past your guilt toward love and forgiveness that is not God's voice and it's not your voice either all right you got an actual life question I do alright let's hear it from Jeremiah 9 Oh Clayton whip forever I appreciate my god we know that you're a gamer yep have you ever tried an escapism hi you know at first of all I've only recently about a month or maybe two months ago I've heard of about escape rooms now I'm a little bit torn about this okay I will tell you why I love games and I love escape right I think escape movies are some of my favorite movies like The Great Escape one of my favorite movies I love anything where I write these stories I mean we write these stories where these guys get in impossible situations can they get out and I always loved that Hitchcock scene where the guy is surrounded in a theater and then he shouts fire and everybody panics and that's how he gets past you know every door and also love that stuff I don't when I'm playing games I don't like intense pressure I mean I live I live with a lot of pressure which I accept and I'm pretty good under pressure actually but I don't like it as I'm playing you know and sometimes even when we play party games and things get too competitive I think like do I need this yeah I have a lot of competition and pressure in my life so I'm a little bit torn about it I'm not actually sure I want to do it I'm not sure I'd have this as much fun but I kind of love the idea of it and I played I played the iPad games where they have those escape things and I have enjoyed them so I'm a do it yet it does sound kind of fun I got to admit all right let's do one more and then we'll move on to stuff I like from max dear mr. Clavin I am aspiring novelist who is also a religious conservative I want to give up no I want to and inevitably do incorporate themes which correspond with my beliefs into my writing my question is since popular arts has become a vehicle for the delivery of leftist ideology can novels with more right-wing ideas and messages still sell thanks Mac first of all yes there's a huge market for Christian novels I mean the Christian literature is a big deal and there are Christian publishers they're fewer because they're all now boned by HarperCollins and they might I when I started with Thomas Nelson writing novels for them they were like this wonderful little company there's still many many wonderful people there but now they're part of this big HarperCollins Corporation but you know the novel business is a tough business I love it I love doing it I love being in it but it is a tough business and obviously if you are in keeping with the left-wing the left-wing prejudices of the mainstream publishing industry you will have a way forward but there still it is better than TV and better than much better than the movies there's still many different voices there that you can get into so yeah I would not I would not give up on that account I mean obviously you don't want to be preachy you don't want to be like selling this stuff you want to tell a story and let the story tell it to tell but your have your values in it but that but that is not a reason not to do it I mean it's just it's a tough business it is a tough business and that will maybe add to the toughness but like it still can be done all right let's move on to stuff I like and you know I want to do instead of just recommending stuff this week I really did get off in this thought yesterday we're talking about Boras and talking about this idea that we're in a crisis of ideas and conservatism has to even if we come back into the in the future with a new conservatism it is going to be different simply because of the time that it's in it's not going to be 1950s the 1950s are not coming back nothing comes back everything changes the change continues all the time Edmund Burke talked about this that you want to change in keeping with your traditions you want to change in keeping with the things that are essential essentially and always true but we have deviated from the path there's no question about it what I want to just point out is this deviation has been going on for centuries and they're one of two ways this can go the reason I'm returning to something I used to talk about it when the show began I guess it's almost two years now since the show began in Jeremy boring the god-king of the daily wire we started in his pool house broadcasting out of his pool house now we have these fabulous studios and all this but we started just doing it with a mic in his in his pool house and at that time I talked a lot about Hamlet and Hamlet is really interesting I believe that Hamlet is Shakespeare's reaction to the Reformation always people always say the Shakespeare was not a religious writer I don't believe that at all I've done a whole shows about how I think he was a religious writer but it doesn't make any sense that a writer of Shakespeare's genius was living during the time of this Reformation where people were being burned at the stake for their beliefs and people were being killed and arrested for reading the Bible in their native language and stuff like that it doesn't make sense he wouldn't write about that that wouldn't inform the way he thinks and one of the things that Hamlet is the story of a man it's based on another play play called Hamlet in which a guy is told that his father's ghost comes and says I was murdered you have to avenge my murder and Hamlet goes and avenge is's murder we don't have that play but we know that's what it was about Shakespeare writes a play in which the ghost comes to Hamlet and says you have to avenge my murder and chemicals well how do I know that this is really a ghost how do I know this is really how do I know that this was I'm supposed he can't make up his mind well why what happened and one of the things about Hamlet is he goes to school in Wittenberg in Germany even though the play takes place before the Reformation takes place of some dark you know backward time Shakespeare never cared about that he never cared about anachronism and he went to he goes to school in Wittenberg which is where the Reformation began it's where Martin Luther not nailed his 95 theses up on the cathedral door so I believe that this is Shakespeare saying this play is about what happens when the monopoly on truth that is owned by the church when the authority of absolute truth that we had in the church disappears what happens how do you make up your mind how do you know it's true now you're just living out of your own head how can you know where the truth lies and in this famous speech his Mel Gibson in a great movie he cut the he cut a four-hour play down to an hour and a half and it really works and it's one of the best Hamlet's performances I've ever seen Mel Gibson talks about the fact that his mood changes everything the very nature of the world seems to change with his mood so here's this speech I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth so go on all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this looking frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire I have Epirus nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how Express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no no woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say sir Shakespeare always throws in a dirty joke if he can get it he took it took his man but I slapped me in the guy last time yes but you like women don't you you know so Hamlet is saying that the entire world the sky the world mankind himself seems to be at the mercy the very nature of him seems to be at the mercy of his moods and when he's depressed suddenly man who seems to be an angel looks like nothing but dust that's not quite what that statement means but for now that's fine you know the sky is no longer beautiful the earth is no longer beautiful how then do you know the truth how then do you know what's right and wrong how then do you know that you're what you think is right is not just your anger if we don't have a church that is going to tell us these things how do you know and this this idea that Shakespeare saw coming from so far away in Hamlet they're hints of post-modernism this hints of you know deconstructionism all kinds of things he just saw into the future really all the future he saw everything that was going to happen he reasoned it out and that's what I believe the play is about and that's why I think it's so great at the same time this was happening a scientific revolution started to take place and in that Scientific Revolution man and his man's perceptions began to be disproved it seemed like the Earth Stood Still or that the earth was at the center of things it seemed like the Sun moved around the earth turned out nope you know it was the earth moving around the Sun that was the camper Nikken revolution you know they get that was why that well Galileo and the church got into it over this that's not actually entirely why but it doesn't matter the thing is it was changing where man was the only truth that you could count on was the truth that you could measure with Sciences truth and there the idea was basically that man's perceptions now are unreliable and the only real truth was physical truth measurable through the distances between things and the soul got relegated to this kind of ghostly place you know this was Descartes it was Descartes who said this who's talked about basically the soul he turned the soul into a ghost in the machine those are not de cartes words with what somebody said and that's what we've been fighting about we fight about whether there's a ghost in the machine of course there's not a ghost in the machine people before the Scientific Revolution did not think that's what the soul was they thought the soul was the nature of being alive it was the very fact of what you were when you were alive and so you could have a soul but it didn't have to be some ghostly thing anyway the Scientific Revolution was so successful that this idea took hold even though it makes no sense and what I have been arguing is that the sense that it doesn't make is now coming to an end the fact that we are now saying things people are sitting there going well we don't really exist we have no we have no self we have no free will we have you know we're going to presume we're going to learn every piece of machinery that makes every decision for us all these things are untrue and they are going to be disproved but they are being disproved as we speak the very nature of reality the very nature of reality has suddenly become connected to the observer in quantum physics and things the logic of the Scientific Revolution that took place back in Shakespeare's time is falling apart and the logic of there not being a moral reality a spiritual reality is also I believe falling apart but as we rediscover that reality I do not believe we're going to go back to thirteen fourteen fifteen century theology I don't believe that's going to happen it happened and what we have to be talking about is what is just what we were talking about earlier on what is the good of man in the modern world what does sin look like in the modern world what is right and wrong and what is and who is going to decide and how can we decide and how does the reason of guys like Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas Hauser's apply to the new world I'll talk about this a little bit more tomorrow I hope if we get to it we have a guess tomorrow we have a priest on tomorrow right we have we have Patrick confidence that isn't I want to say Costner's that's his name let me just make sure it is a Patrick coughing you out the priest will talk to him about sex we'll talk to him about a lot of this stuff I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we'll be back again tomorrow either you
