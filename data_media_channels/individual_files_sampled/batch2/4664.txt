when Donald Trump thinks he's doing a terrific job as president so do his supporters agree with that we gathered a group of voters together here in Mississippi yesterday some back Trump for president some didn't and of course there was plenty to talk about here is somewhere here are some of their impressions of President Trump after 600 days in office what's Donald Trump's best quality the fact that he will identify problem believe he's right in the way that he goes about something that or tackling that problem he doesn't sidestep it he doesn't aside separate he goes full head-on with how he believes it should be handled and he doesn't seek anyone else's approval to do that I would agree with Rita that he is a strong charging man in terms of trying to move forward his agenda I don't find him to be the kind of person that holds his finger up in the air to see which way the wind is blowing before he makes a decision so I think that's an admirable quality I would have to say is direct assess probably his best quality and it comes from there's days in Manhattan is selling real estate and strong brand but he he has the you know the he conveys the sense that he is absolutely certain of his position what's his worst quality his self-centeredness is what I get he's not at in terms of being president his worst quality is his lack of inclusiveness he panners to a very small subset of the Republican side of the ledger he didn't run as a Republican wasn't a Republican candidate he basically was co-opted into the Breitbart Fox News machine he needed it because he needed a sense of coherence and policy and approach to politics they provided that for him how he what's the president's best quality worst quality I think like others have said it's this fact that he believes wholly himself and what he can do but I would also argue that that is his worst quality as well because so many times that he's he is ill informed and he refuses to seek out counsel who whether it's being a lawyer or an engineer anybody else he refuses to listen to them and what they have to bring to the table and a lot of times throughout its history he's shown he had that good evening go hire lawyers for the people to mop up his mistakes and that's a that's a why do we have to have a mistake with the president you can't make a mistake when you're president of states best-quality inception that's as high as I can go okay so it's deception because you know for example when you look at the economy and he's taking credit for the economy we know that when Obama inherited his economy we were in a recession and over time we were emerging out of that or evolving out of that recession and so now you know Donald John Trump is taking credit for us being where we are and that's deception you like that middle name his worst quality is division division divisive news best quality I guess this is more most beneficial quality to him is his ability to just deny deny deny and never never accept you know never admit to having done something because you know in the past politicians if something like that says Hollywood tape would come out you know they would have come out and apologized and admitted they did it and you know with with Trump he said I will just locker room talk you know there was no big act of contrition and when he did that I started realizing that actually works you don't if you just don't admit to something and you don't really show contrition you can actually just move forward as a politician and it won't ruin your career like it has so many others so that's been very beneficial to him in many circumstances I think worse quality I would have to get with his his narcissism because I think he finds a really difficult to disentangle Trump from America in terms of what's good for Trump and what's good for America I think he tends to see those things as intertwined and so he can't really see when he's doing something that that he thinks is beneficial for him he can't see the damage it might be causing to the country as a whole so you know me who I was in I think the most interesting tag was first of all the four people that voted for Trump mm-hmm are still with from yeah even if one of them wouldn't use Trump's name you said I voted for Pence and they will vote for him again but they said they would vote for him again in the general but he was very unhappy on every single one I said well what if Mike Pence or nikki Haley ran against him in a primary it so it would be totally up into that which is interesting you wouldn't have gotten that with Barack Obama and Democrats 18 months in you wouldn't have gotten that with george w bush supporters and but but everyone who said we are behind donald trump all said oh yeah nikki Haley ran against him if Mike Pence ran against him I would certainly consider that that was by far the most surprising take away I'm sitting down with this group of voters because I've listened to probably 50 60 focus groups of voters around the country and I've never really seen that shift to looking at the prospect of supporting another candidate for the Republican nomination from voters who identify as strong Trump supporters I would say that's definitely a fault line that President Trump should be aware of going into the midterms and over the next two years as he looks to his reelection yep that doesn't that doesn't usually happen with with incumbent presidents in certain parties but again these same Trump supporters weren't willing to say that he lied or they weren't willing to say that he said anything that was racially insensitive they weren't but I mean you just go down the list and they sounded like Trump supporters they were going to defend him but you get the real impression it was yes we will defend Trump instead of Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton are the mainstream press but at the same time you could hear they were Republicans a lot of them said yeah one of them said John McCain leaked into this great word-association again John McCain hero robert muller you know FactFinder they had positive things to say about a lot of the people that donald trump's been critical of but you know what I saw out of that I saw at the end of the day Republicans Republicans who had a chance to beat Hillary Clinton yeah and don't want fortune allows you to be Speaker of the House I think that I mean the great primary challenges afford and Reagan against for Kennedy against Carter both set up defeats it wouldn't stunned me to see the same same dynamic because there is if anything that divided between the elements of the party or is even more Pro bar even more profound now I listening to him it sounded and wasn't like this in the room it sounds as though they're describing their kid has stolen the neighbors car wreck dead but they still love the kid yeah and so know what I mean I did yeah no yeah we know he's you know doing drugs but you know he's a good kid I'm about for example stormy Daniels and it was like the answer we got a couple times over as I would not want my spouse to do that right so it's I this is the question I wanted to ask I mean there Joe you were saying they were Republicans right and in the context of the conversation did you get a sense that there that the country that the well-being of the country was was more of a concern than their identity as well I get what Trump was doing I can tell you especially with Pat the one that kept winking at me cos saying bless your heart with had she believes that America is in trouble and that Donald Trump is the only one fighting fighting to to revive the country and I know Elise is a I don't know if you're a fellow former Republican but at one point we were both Republicans for most of our lives the great frustration with Republicans have been we elect Republican presidents we knock on doors for them we you know we have blood sweat and here for these people we contribute to them and then they appoint liberal justices or then they back down then they try to make a deal on immigration with Ted Kennedy then they try to make a deal with Ted Kennedy on education then they do all of these things that they told us they weren't going to do because they all tell us they're gonna all move the embassy to Jerusalem they all tell us that and it all ends up being a lie Annelise what they were saying was unlike every other Republican president we've elected this guy is doing exactly what he said he was gonna do he's delivering on the economy they like the job numbers and they like the tax cuts overall one question at the very beginning of the round table was striking I think in illustrating kind of how we arrived to this moment that was when you were asking the sources of media that everyone listened to or read and they were talking about how their habits it changed from reading local newspapers to now just watching you know strictly say Fox News and so I think that it's contribute we have this just cycle of super polarization right that if we just insulate and just go further into our own caves don't listen to anyone else that the country it's only going to be this you know crisis of rancor ya know and I also saw a something happening with the truth in this conversation and I asked several Trump supporters you know when he lies in tweaks and they said what do you mean and I said a President Obama a wiretapping trump tower well did he or didn't he and then you think about the tweets about Puerto Rico and it was really for me as someone who at least wants the truth to not be in question that was yeah but let's face it though Willie Democrats did that with Bill Clinton yeah I mean I remember none other than Daniel Patrick Moynihan saying if Bill Clinton's lying about Monica Lewinsky he has to he has to resign right then he finds out that Bill Clinton lied about Monica Lewinsky and suddenly he's shape shifted and decided that he needed to stay I mean did all parties do this yep Republicans did this with george w bush we're fiscal conservatives you know he doubled the national debt democrats did this with bill clinton it does seem a hell of a lot more extreme with donald trump but I'm not so sure who are we I'm not so sure that Donald Trump is not just the logical conclusion to a lot of dysfunction that we've been seeing for thirty I would also say quickly just up your focus-group the hardcore Donald Trump supporters are even harder core than they were on election day because they believe that he is under assault from the media from Democrats and from the Justice Department with the Russia investigation what I'm interested in are the Republicans who took a flyer on him because they didn't like Hillary Clinton are they today
