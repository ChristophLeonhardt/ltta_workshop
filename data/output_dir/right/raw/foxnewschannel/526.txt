RAMIREZ MAY HAVE EXPOSED THE

93

HOLES IN HER OWN STORY BY

94
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,192
ADMITTING TO FANS THAT SHE

95
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:45,529
COULDN'T BE SURE IF

96
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:47,331
KAVANAUGH WAS THE GUILTY PARTY.

97
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,699
THERE ARE NO CORROBORATING

98
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:49,133

99
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,568
KAVANAUGH HAS DENIED THAT IT

100
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,236
HAPPENED AND RAMIREZ HERSELF

101
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,538
ADMITS TO BEING BUMPED, SLURRING

102
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,340
HER WORDS OF THE TIME, AND

103
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,841
SHE CONCEDED THAT HER MEMORY WAS

104
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,344
"FOGGY."

105
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,578

RESISTANCE, HER ALLEGATIONS ARE

111
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,490
ALREADY GETTING BAD REVIEWS.

112
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,059
SHE SAYS SHE ATTENDED AT LEAST

113
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:21,832
TEN PARTIES WHERE GANG-RAPES

114
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,499
WERE TAKING PLACE.

115
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:24,601
SHE ALSO SAID SHE WENT BACK TO

116
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,537
ONE SUCH PARTY IN APPROXIMATELY

117
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:27,304
1982 AFTER KNOWING THAT THESE BE

118
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:29,139
THESE BE 21s WERE TAKING

119
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,474
PLACE, WHERE THEN SHE HERSELF

120
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:32,843
WAS RAPED.

121
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,279
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IN 1982,

122
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,781
SHE WAS A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE.

123
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,783
HOW MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS DO YOU

124
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:43,721

125
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,289
FUNCTIONS WHERE GANG-RAPES HAD

126
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:45,823
PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED?

127
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:46,957
NONE OF IT MAKES MUCH SENSE AT

ALL.

129
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,927
BUT THIS DOES.

130
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,895

MORE ABOUT AVENATTI'S NEW PRIZE,

133
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,534
ACCORDING TO POLITICO, HER

134
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:58,936
EX-BOYFRIEND PAINTS A DISTURBING

135
00:03:58,936 --> 00:03:59,937
PICTURE OF HER OWN CHARACTER.

136
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,739
IN A PHONE INTERVIEW WITH

137
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,506
"POLITICO," HE SAID THIS ABOUT

138
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:04,742
HIS 2001 INJUNCTION.

139
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:07,911
RIGHT AFTER I BROKE UP WITH HER,

140

TO DO HARM TO MY BABY AT THAT

144
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,419

146
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:20,958
HE SAID NOT AT ALL.

147
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,759
WOW.

148
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,559
DESPITE ALL OF THAT, OF COURSE

149
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,528
