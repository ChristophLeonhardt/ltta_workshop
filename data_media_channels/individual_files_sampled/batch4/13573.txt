so what the hell happened to the sports media because many years ago now it's probably six seven years ago maybe longer I was a Sports Illustrated subscriber from the time that I was probably 13 years old to the time that I was probably 27 28 years old and read it cover-to-cover every single week and then I unsubscribe because they decided to put Caitlyn Jenner on the cover because I just felt like this is not athletically relevant whatever I have to do with with anything and I began to notice that ESPN was doing the same thing I had the same experience that you did which I would get up at 6 o'clock in the morning West Coast time so I could be the first person to see all the highlights and then it became I don't want to watch any of this stuff anymore because I'm gonna get a human interest story on hands up don't shoot which has nothing to do with with sports itself so why do you think that the it was that the athletes start to get more political so the media got more political do you think it was that the media got more political and so the athletes rushed to sort of meet that moment and why it's it's a tremendous question and one of the things that I really grapple with in the book that I wrote so I've spent a ton of time thinking about this issue exactly and I think there are several threads at play one is I would say this social media all right I think that a yes PN and then I write about this some their business started to collapse they had a hundred million subscribers the court is getting is fraying the number of kids who were subscribing the old Cable subscribers are dying off and I think ESPN I had this interesting conversation back in 2012 when Alabama played Notre Dame I remember having a conversation with a lot of top ESPN executives because I used to have and still do have a really good relationship with a lot of people they or despite the fact that we've kind of gone at loggerheads at times and their discussion at that point was do we pay attention to what people say about our talent on social media on Twitter in particular or do we pay attention to the public reaction we see and I remember having this conversation specifically about Chris Berman and Lou Holtz and they said everywhere Chris Berman and Lou Holtz go they get mobbed and people love them if you go on social media and you read what people say about them on Twitter they're old white guys and they get crushed and at the time ESPN was making the argument we think we need to pay more attention to what we see and face-to-face interaction over social media I think as ESPN's business collapsed they looked for salvation on social media and believed that if they made Twitter happy if we promote the locust people who are getting the most attention on Twitter that will lead to success on television as well it will combat our dying business so I think they looked for salvation and Twitter and instead found a way to drown faster like a big rock because I think politics was basically a rock they were holding over their head and they thought it was a lifejacket
