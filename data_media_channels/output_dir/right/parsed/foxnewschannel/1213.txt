>> ERIC: MR. WACTHEL IS THE U.N.
BUREAU CHIEF FOR FOX NEWS AND
WORKED TOGETHER OVER AT THE U.N.
DID YOU EVER THINK WE WOULD GET
THIS FAR.
YOU AND I SPENT SO MANY YEARS AT
THE UNITED NATIONS, THE FIRST
TIME THE ISSUE OF NORTH KOREA
WAS ALLOWED TO GET TO THE
SECURITY COUNCIL WAS IN 2006.
NOW WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF A
HISTORIC SUMMIT.
>> IT'S MORE THAN A DECADE WE
WERE FOLLOWING NORTH KOREA
AFFAIRS.
IN 2006, THINGS LOOKED PRETTY
GRIM.
HEAVY SANCTIONS WERE WANTED.
CHINA BLOCKED ANY ATTEMPT TO DO
SOMETHING.
THE UNITED STATES HELD THE PEN
AS IT WERE AS THEY SAY IN
U.N.-SPEAK, IN DRAFTING ONE
RESOLUTION AFTER ANOTHER, TRYING
TO HOLD THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT IT WAS
DOING.
THESE WERE TOUGH TIMES.
>> ERIC: WHAT DO YOU THINK
CHANGED?
WAS IT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS?
HIS WORDS?
HE WAS SO BLUNT AT THE U.N. IN
SEPTEMBER WHEN HE DIRECTLY
ADDRESSED WHO HE CALLED ROCKET
MAN IN FRONT OF THE STUNNED
AUDIENCE THAT BASICALLY GASPED,
INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATS THAT
NEVER HEARD THIS TYPE OF TALK
BEFORE.
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS.
THERE'S A WORD ZEITGIST, THE
SPIRIT OF THE TIME.
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE ABLE TO
DEVELOP THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO
SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT STARTED TO
ACTUALLY CONCERN THE CHINESE TO
A LEVEL THAT THEY THOUGHT YOU
KNOW WHAT, WE CAN'T PLAY THIS
GAME ANYMORE OF CAT AND MOUSE
WITH THE UNITED STATES USING OUR
PROXY, NORTH KOREA ANYMORE, WE
HAVE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT
WITH OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR
BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL.
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE AN
ECONOMIC PRESSURE THAT'S COME TO
BEAR OF COURSE WITH THESE VERY
STRINGENT RESOLUTIONS,
SANCTIONS, RESOLUTIONS ON THE
ECONOMY OF NORTH KOREA, PULLING
THE CHINESE TOGETHER.
THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON.
YOU ALSO HAD THE LEVEL OF
DIPLOMACY HAPPENING BETWEEN THE
NORTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE
THAT HAD ALSO STARTED TO GET A
LITTLE OUT OF SHAPE IN WHICH YOU
HAD DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.
SO ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS
COME INTO PLAY.
BUT MOSTLY IT IS THIS HEAVY DUTY
CAMPAIGN OF PRESSURE, MAXIMUM
PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA.
IT'S AN ECONOMY OF NORTH KOREA
THAT'S HURTING AND IT'S A
WEAPONS, POWERFUL NUCLEAR
COUNTRY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.
>> ERIC: THE IMAGE IT WORD IS
DENUCLEARIZATION -- THE MAGIC
WORD IS DENUCLEARIZATION P.
THAT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS FOR
THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA.
DO YOU SEE KIM JONG UN GIBBING G
DO YOU SEE KIM JONG UN GIBBING V
DO YOU SEE KIM JONG UN GIBBING N
DO YOU SEE KIM JONG UN GIBBING G
DO YOU SEE KIM JONG UN GIBBING U
DO YOU SEE KIM JONG UN GIBBING P
HIS NUCLEAR ARSENAL?
WHAT POE TEN DO YOU SEE THE
NORTH KOREANS AGREEING TO WHEN
THEY'VE PLAYED CAT AND MOUSE FOR
SO MANY DECADES OVER THIS ISSUE.
>> THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL THAT KIM
JONG UN HAS RIGHT NOW IS HIS
LIFE INSURANCE.
IF HE FEELS THAT IN THE
NEGOTIATING PROCESS OR THE
OUTCOME OF THE NEGOTIATING
PROCESS WILL LEAVE HIM
VULNERABLE, I DON'T SEE IT
HAPPENING, I DON'T SEE HIM
GIVING UP HIS ONE WAY TO
MAINTAIN SURVIVAL.
HE'S SEEN THE CALAMITIES OF
ANYBODY WHO HAS GIVEN UP NUCLEAR
CAPABILITIES OR MOVED IN THAT
DIRECTION AND LET THEMSELVES UP
TO THE OWN POPULATION THAT HE
HAS OF PRESSED, THAT
HAS -F PRESSED, THAT
HAS -- PRESSED, THAT
HAS -- ORESSED, THAT
HAS -- ONESSED, THAT
HAS -- OPRSSED, THAT
HAS -- OPRESED, THAT
HAS -- OPRESSE, THAT
HAS -- OPRESSED.THAT
IF HE PUTS HIMSELF IN A
VULNERABLE POSITION, THE NUCLEAR
DEAL IS OFF.
>> ERIC: DO YOU SEE A PHASING IN
OF DISMANTLING SOME OF IT, IF
NOT POTENTIALLY ALL.
>> WE COULD SEE -- WE MAY NOT
GET AS FAR AS WE WANT TO GET IN
TERMS OF GETTING ALL THOSE
WEAPONS OUT OF THERE AND
CLEANING THE WHOLE PLACE AND
THEN DECIDING TO GO SOLAR IN
NORTH KOREA AND FORGET ANY SORT
OF NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND
ENRICHMENT.
WHAT COULD END UP HAPPENING, WE
COULD SEE HAPPENING A NORTH
KOREA THAT FREEZES ITS EFFORTS
TO NUCLEARIZE THESE BALLISTIC
MISSILES THAT IT'S TESTED SO WE
DON'T HAVE TO FACE THE PROSPECT
OF ICBMS RAINING DOWN ON US AND
BLOWING UP OUR CITIES.
COMPROMISE WHERE THEY MAY KEEP
SOME OF THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM, BUT
AS YOU POINT OUT, NOT IN THE
BALLISTIC MISSILES THAT THREATEN
THE UNITED STATES.
>> WE COULD HAVE A MOVE TOWARD
HAVING NUCLEAR ENERGY AS AN
OPTION FOR THEM, STOPPING THE
PROGRAM, FREEZING THIS PROGRAM.
IN TERMS OF GIVING IT ALL UP AND
SAYING HEY, WE'RE OPEN TO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, UNITED
STATES, WITH US AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY INSURANCE POLICY, I JUST
DON'T SEE IT.
>> ERIC: ALSO A QUESTION, THAT
WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE JAPANESE
AND SOUTH KOREAN CONCERNS OVER
THE SHORT RANGE MISSILES.
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
JAPAN HAS BEEN TERRIFIED.
FISHERMEN AT SEA ARE FISHING FOR
SQUID.
THEY COULD AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
HAVE A ROCKET COME FLYING OVER
THEIR HEADS AND CRASH INTO THEM.
IT'S A CRAZY SITUATION.
YOU CAN'T GO ON WITH THAT TYPE
