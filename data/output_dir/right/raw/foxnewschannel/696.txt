1
00:00:01,282 --> 00:00:03,717
WOULD YOUR HOUSE STILL BE YOUR

2
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:10,290
THAT IS THE LEFT'S PLAN FOR

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,892
AMERICA AND FINALLY THEY ARE

4
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:13,460
SAYING IT OUT LOUD.

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:15,295
WE ARE GOING TO PAUSE AND BRING

6
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:16,897
YOU TO A NEWS CONFERENCE

7
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:17,264
UNDERWAY.

8
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:17,964
OFFICIALS IN MARYLAND BRIEFING

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,673
NOTIFYING THE NEXT OF KIN.

10
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:31,878
WE HAVE FIVE CONFIRMED FATAL'S

11
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,480
AND TWO INJURIES.

12
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,247
THE INJURIES TO MY UNDERSTANDING

13
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:40,220
ARE SUPERFICIAL, POSSIBLY FROM

14
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:43,657
GLASS FROM THE SHOTGUN BLAST.

15
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:46,426
WE ARE WORKING ON NOW SECURING

16
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:46,860
HIS RESIDENCE.

17
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:52,265
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

18
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,501
SECURING THAT RESIDENCE AND

19
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,869
PREPARING FOR SEARCH WARRANTS.

20
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,839
SO THIS IS THE NEXT PHASE OF

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,474
THIS SCENE, AND THAT IS THE

22
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:05,679
INVESTIGATIVE PHASE.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,914
THIS IS THE PART THAT TAKES THE

24
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,649
MOST TIME, AS I WOULD ASSUME

25
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,518
MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD

26
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,386
FROM MANY OTHER POLICE AGENCIES

27
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:14,554
IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND AND

28
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,890
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE

29
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,857
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS IS VERY

30
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:18,224
DIFFICULT.

31
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,460
WE MUST BE THOROUGH AND THAT IS

32
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,429
WHY YOU WILL NOT GET THE

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,397
INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA OR

34
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:25,832
FROM US UNLESS IT HAS BEEN

35
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,266
CONFIRMED.

36
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:28,501
WE HAVE ALLOWED OUR

37
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:29,202
INVESTIGATORS TO DO THEIR JOB

38
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:31,871
AND THEY ARE THERE NOW, AND WE

39
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:34,407
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

40
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:37,877
YOU WITH INFORMATION.

41
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:39,112
I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH

42
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:41,648
YOU THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT.

43
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,452
WE MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT THE

44
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,853
IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.

45
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:51,825
THAT IS NOT AN IED, IT WAS

46
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:52,492
ACTUALLY CANISTERS OF SMOKE

47
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:54,461
GRENADES THAT HE USED INSIDE OF

48
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:59,633
THE BUILDING WHEN HE ENTERED THE

49
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:01,668
ESTABLISHMENT.

50
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:02,335
SO THIS PERSON WAS PREPARED

51
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:04,871
TODAY TO COME IN.

52
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,875
THIS PERSON WAS PREPARED TO

53
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,682
AND, AS I STATED BEFORE THE

54
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:16,883
INVESTIGATIVE PART OF THIS IS

55
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:19,653
GOING TO BE THOROUGH AND IT'S

56
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:21,454
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.

57
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:24,658
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND US, WE

58
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,291
OPENED UP THAT ROAD.

59
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,294
WE THOUGHT THAT WE MAY NEED TO

60
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,264
SECURE THAT ROADWAY FOR A LONG

61
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:33,867
PERIOD OF TIME, AND AS WE GET

62
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:34,601
FURTHER INTO THE INVESTIGATION,

63
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:35,535
WE REALIZE THAT WE DON'T NEED

64
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:38,204
THAT ROADWAY.

65
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:41,808
THE BUILDING, 888 THAT SKATE

66
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,877
WILL BE SECURED FOR SOME TIME.

67
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,478
I DO NOT HAVE A TIME FRAME ON

68
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:45,979
THAT YET.

69
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,481
WE WILL BE INSIDE OF THERE FOR

70
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,284
QUITE A BIT, UNTIL THIS

71
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:55,522
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.

72
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,856
WHEN I HAVE MORE CONFIRMED

73
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:59,793
INFORMATION, I WILL SHARE THAT

74
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:01,861
CONFIRMED INFORMATION WITH YOU.

75
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,264
>> EXACTLY WHAT WAS HIS BEEF

76
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:05,832
WITH THIS NEWSPAPER?

77
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,300
>> THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

78
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,368
INVESTIGATING NOW.

79
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,537
>> IT'S ALREADY BEEN REPORTED HE

80
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:13,239
HAS A HISTORY WITH THE NEWSPAPER

81
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,740
YEARS AGO.

82
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,842
>> THAT'S WHAT WE ARE HEARING

83
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:19,679
BUT WE NEED THE INVESTIGATORS TO

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
CONFIRM THAT.

85
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:26,453
>> IS HE LIVING IN AN ANNAPOLIS

86
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:34,227
>> NO, I CAN'T SHARE THAT WITH

87
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:34,494
YOU.

88
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,162
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD

89
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,270
HE IS AT OUR CRIMINAL

90
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:44,871
INVESTIGATION DIVISION.

91
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:45,839
OUR DETECTIVES ARE DOWN THERE

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,207
WITH HIM AND I HAVE NOT

93
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:51,778
INTERRUPTED HIM TO ASK IF HE'S

94
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:04,824
>> THE ONLY CONNECTION THAT I

95
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,293
CAN TELL YOU ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS

96
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,696
POSSIBLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.

97
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:12,332
I HAVE NO OTHER CONFIRMATION.

98
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:12,932
>> [INDISTINCT QUESTION]

99
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,534
>> WE ARE STILL LOOKING INTO

100
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:14,834
THAT.

101
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:16,302
I CANNOT CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT

102
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:17,303
OUR DEPARTMENT HAS COME INTO

103
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:18,570
CONTACT WITH HIM AND WE WILL

104
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:20,540
HAVE THAT AT A LATER TIME AS

105
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:20,907
WELL.

106
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:23,877
>> HAVE YOU HAD ANY COMMENTS

107
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:24,978
FROM ANY FAMILY MEMBERS?

108
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:27,147
>> CAN YOU TELL US IF HE IS A

109
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:29,115
RESIDENT OF MARYLAND OR IF HE

110
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:29,682
CAME FROM OUTSIDE?

111
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:33,119
>> HE'S A RESIDENT OF MARYLAND.

112
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,923
INVESTIGATION.

113
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,860
YOU JUST TARGETED THE BUSINESS

114
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:43,263
IN GENERAL.

115
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:46,900
>> CAN YOU TELL US WHERE IN

116
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,667
MARYLAND?

117
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:48,468
>> NO.

118
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:51,538
>> WHEN WILL YOU CONFIRM HIS

119
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:55,975
SHOTGUN?

120
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:59,879
WAS IT A SPORTING SHOTGUN OR

121
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,147
WHERE THE SMOKE GRENADES

122
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,484
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT

123
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:04,884
INFORMATION.

124
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:07,887
>> WERE ALL THE PEOPLE SHOT IN

125
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,255
THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE?

126
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,694
>> DEPUTY CHIEF, THERE'S TALK

127
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:15,528
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO

128
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:19,465
HIDE HIS IDENTITY IN CERTAIN

129
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,367
WAYS, MAYBE WITH HIS

130
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:23,670
FINGERPRINTS BURNED OFF AND

131
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:26,940
>> THAT'S A FIRST TIME I'VE

132
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:27,941
HEARD FACIAL RECOGNITION AND THE

133
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,276
FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD

134
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:31,144
FINGERPRINTS, NO VERIFICATION OF

135
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,281
RECORD?

136
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:38,451
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM THAT.

137
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,153
>> [INDISTINCT QUESTION]

138
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,187
>> WE KNOW THERE WERE THREATS

139
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:47,460
THE THREATS WERE SENT OVER

140
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:48,895
SOCIAL MEDIA AND WE ARE TRYING

141
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,563
TO CONFIRM WHAT ACCOUNT THAT WAS

142
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,665
AND TRYING TO CONFIRM WHO

143
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,368
ACTUALLY SENT THEM.

144
00:05:55,369 --> 00:00:00,000
>>  >> WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONIT
