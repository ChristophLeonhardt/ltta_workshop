SENATE. SENATOR GRAHAM. ARE YOU AWARE THAT AT 9:23 ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 9, THE DAY YOU WERE NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT BY PRESIDENT TRUMP, SENATOR SCHUMER SAID, 23 MINUTES AFTER YOUR NOMINATION, I WILL OPPOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE. I HOPE I HAVE A BIPARTISAN MAJORITY WILL DO THE SAME. THE STAKES ARE SIMPLY TOO HIGH FOR ANYTHING LESS. IF YOU WEREN'T AWARE OF IT, YOU ARE NOW. DID YOU MEET WITH SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN ON AUGUST 20th? I DID MEET WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN. DID YOU KNOW THAT HER STAFF ALREADY RECOMMENDED A LAWYER TO DR. FORD? I DID NOT KNOW THAT. DID YOU KNOW THAT HER AND HER STAFF HAD THIS ALLEGATIONS FOR OVER 20 DAYS? I DID NOT KNOW THAT AT THE TIME. IF YOU WANTED AN FBI INVESTIGATION YOU COULD HAVE COME TO US. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT HOPE AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020. NOT ME. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. WHEN YOU SEE SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN THAT LINDSEY SAID HELLO. I VOTED FOR THEM. I WOULD NEVER DO TO THIS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY. IN IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SCAM SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW THE TRUTH, YOU SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID TO THIS GUY. ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST? NO. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH. BOY, YA'LL WANT POWER. GOD I HOPE YOU NEVER GOT IT. I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM. THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU HELD IT. YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF PROTECTING DR. FORD. NONE. SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU ARE. GOD I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS. LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT COMES TO THIS, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FAIR PROCESS? YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND. YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB INTERVIEW? THE ADVICE AN CONSENT ROLE DO YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A JOB INTERVIEW? I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS OF ADVICE WOULD YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL? I'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL AND THEN SOME. THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW. YEAH. THIS IS HELL. THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS CRAP. YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK. YOU HAVE INTERACTED WITH PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR LIFE, NOT ONE ACCUSATION. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BILL COSBY WHEN YOU'RE A JUNIOR AND SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GOT OVER IT. IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF YOU DRUG WOMEN AND RAPE THEM FOR TWO YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL, YOU PROBABLY DON'T STOP. HERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING. IF YOU LIVED A GOOD LIFE, PEOPLE WILL RECOGNIZE IT LIKE THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION HAS THE GOAL STANDARD. HIS INTEGRITY IS ABSOLUTELY UNQUESTIONED, HE'S A VERY CIRCUMSPECT IN HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT, HARBORS NO BIASES OR PREJUDICES, A DECENT PERSONAL, WARM, FRIENDLY, THE NICEST PERSON IN THE ABA. ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF, ASHLEY, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS. THAT YOU RAISED A DAUGHTER THAT HAD THE GOOD CHARACTER TO PRAY FOR DR. FORD. TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF YOU VOTE NO, YOU'RE LEGITIMIZING THE MOST DESPICABLE THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN POLITICS. YOU WANT THIS SEAT? I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT. I HOPE YOU'RE ON THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE YOU SHOULD BE. AND I HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SEE THROUGH THIS CHARADE.
