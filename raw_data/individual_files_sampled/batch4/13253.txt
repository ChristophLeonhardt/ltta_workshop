I do have to get to the best part of all of the hearings mr. Jones take it away you're not gonna stylish me you are like you are literally a little gangster so there's so much here if you couldn't hear that that would be mr. Marco Rubio and Alex Jones comes into this little press gaggle and she starts getting right in Rubio's face there's a big debate happening right now over how Rubio handled this I got to say I think he could have handled it better I don't think this was the best way if Alex Jones gets up in your face starts screaming at you you're at a hearing about a big tech censorship of people Alex Jones is one of the big faces of bit of tech censoring people on the right I use the term the right broadly because Alex Jones probably wouldn't be considered a conservative or call himself a conservative he's a little a little more out there than that but certainly he does fall broadly within the right there is no way that Marco Rubio doesn't know who he is of course Marco Rubio knows who he is everybody knows who he is he's on TV all the time because Alex Jones as you saw in that clip is very good at making a spectacle so of course he does I just felt like this is the kind of classic politician respond say oh I haven't seen that whenever there's a damaging video or somebody does a hit piece or does a damaging advertisement or something they were say oh I haven't seen it I've heard about it but I haven't seen it and they deny and they deny but that's not credible here and then then Marco Rubio says I swear to God I don't know who you are which is I think for a lot of listeners a little jarring because we all know that Marco Rubio knows who Alex Jones is so you say I swear to God just like this this what are you doing here what is the game that you're playing and also Alex Jones isn't gonna take that for an answer and I'll show you how this ends up too to give you a recap here's the rest of that frat-boy so cool just so what this I pity Marco Rubio here because you know what was he going to do in this situation but I think that what he did was just leave at the end right he said okay I'm leaving my little press gaggle and you guys can talk to Alex Jones I'm getting out of here because it was so awkward it was not making good video it didn't look good he should have done that the second he saw Alex Jones from down the hallway said like no Nadia see ya you can't win an altercation with Alex Jones that's not gonna happen he know Alex Jones creates spectacle there is no way to win that there's no way to look cool doing that denying that you know who he is trying to laugh at him trying to get in his face trying to threaten him whatever it doesn't work the guy isn't mewn to it because they're turning the frogs gay you know I mean that's really so I think he should have just walked away sooner if you if you get down into a fight with alex jones you can't leave it looking good you can't lay this is true of a lot of people in politics but you can't leave it looking good when there's a note when it's a lose lose lose get out of there he should have done it sooner but I do have some sympathy for Marco Rubio but Alex Jones oh what a regardless of whether they're turning the frogs gay or any you know conspiracy theories of Alex Jones's you've got to give the guy credit cuz he is so compelling on camera it
