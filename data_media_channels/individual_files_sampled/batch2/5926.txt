I want to walk through exactly how we got here it started yesterday afternoon around 2:30 when nunberg told The Washington Post he was refusing to appear before grand jury despite a subpoena from Robert Mullen just fifteen minutes later he called into MSNBC to speak to Katy tur and explain exactly why what they said me was absolutely ridiculous they wanted every email I had with Roger stone and would Steve Bennett what is Bob Butler need to see my emails when I said Roger and Steve clips and we talked about how much we hate people Sam he doesn't have to tell you why he just has to say do it he also called the whole investigation a witch hunt but then then he seemed to contradict himself by saying he thinks Muller might have the goods on the president do you think that they have something on the president I think they well I think that he may have done something during the election but I don't know that I think they may that doesn't sound like a witch hunt shortly after 3 p.m. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders well she fired back with this as we've said many times before there was no collusion with the Trump campaign anything further on what his actions are he hasn't worked at the White House so I certainly can't speak to him or the lack of knowledge that he clearly has but he didn't work with the campaign as if Paul Manafort Rick gates Carter page she said no collusion no she never mentioned money laundering but none Berg he wasn't done by 4:00 p.m. he was on CNN doubling down on his defiance of Bob Muller subpoena about cooperating a referee you're not writing a residue I'm not cooperating your boys been happy you learn arrest me arrest me move throughout the day nunberg never stop making news he alleged that Carter page was in fact colluding with the Russians he said Bob Muller was trying to build a case the Trump is indeed a puppet of Moscow and he launched personal attacks against Sarah Huckabee Sanders by the evening there were questions about why nunberg opted for such a public display talking to you do I have smelled alcohol on your breath this is for real throughout the day number repeatedly shrugged off the possibility of being held in contempt and facing jail time listen to what he told are a number you keep saying you don't think there'll be a consequence what if the quality that is going to jail Sam they're not gonna send me to jail you know what mr. Muller if he wants to send me to jail he can send me to jail and then and then I'll laugh about it and I don't make a bigger spectacle that I am on your TV show right now I would have no problem going to the grand jury but I once again don't want to have to spend 80 hours going over email you'd rather spend possibly a year in jail than I'm not going to jail I don't know I've never been to jail but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't be laughing but by the end of the day reality seemed to set in for mr. nunberg late yesterday he finally reversed course telling my colleague Katy tur that he would in fact cooperate with Robert Muller's team hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
