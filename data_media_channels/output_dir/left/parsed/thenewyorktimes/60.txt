“Please raise
your right hand.”
These are the Supreme Court
confirmation hearings —
“This is day two.”
— you’re probably
all familiar with.
“Bigly.”
“You just said ‘bigly.’”
“Bigly.”
Big partisan productions —
"A charade and
a mockery."
“Anything else you want
to say, Judge Bork?”
— that dominate the
headlines and the airwaves.
This is how they used to be.
Yeah, there actually
weren’t any.
So how did we
get from here —
— to here?
We’ll start in 1937 with
former Senator Hugo Black,
who’s being congratulated.
That’s because
he’s just been confirmed
as a Supreme Court Justice.
He’s also been outed
as a former member
of the Ku Klux Klan.
So to explain himself,
he gets on the radio.
“I did join the Klan.
I later resigned.
I never rejoined.”
People are not happy.
They’re basically asking:
How could the
Senate Judiciary Committee
let this guy through?
Answer:
Since the first hearing
back in 1873, for this guy,
there were no standard
ways of holding hearings
for Supreme Court nominees.
They didn’t have
to go and testify,
and the hearings didn’t
need to be made public.
The senators reviewed the
nominees among themselves.
But then came a
couple of amendments
to the Constitution.
The upshot is they gave more
voting power to the people.
So the senators needed to
start paying more attention
to public opinion.
And they’re paying
attention when
Black’s controversial
confirmation
drives Americans to ask: Why
are these hearings private?
It’s a big reason why the
next nominee to come along
gets a public hearing.
And it’s not just
a public hearing,
it’s the first
that includes
no-holds-barred questioning
by the committee.
Things are
beginning to change.
Then World War II
comes, and goes.
America is suddenly
a superpower.
Business booms,
suburbs grow.
“The protest took the
form of a boycott.”
And we see the beginning of
the modern civil-rights era.
In 1954, the court rules
to end racial segregation
in schools.
And this marks a
point where we really
start to see the court
using its power to shape
parts of American society.
That means Americans
take a greater interest
in who is on the court.
That means even more
pressure on senators
to vet these candidates.
Starting with the first nominee
after the Brown decision,
almost every nominee
will have a public hearing.
Now change is in full swing.
“I Have a Dream,” the
march from Selma,
“The Feminine Mystique.”
The court keeps making
controversial rulings
on race discrimination,
gender discrimination,
personal privacy.
That means more
public interest,
more pressure on
senators, more issues
to parse in the hearings.
So the hearings get longer.
But just wait.
1981 — game changer.
“Good evening.
Sandra O’Connor —”
First woman nominated
to the Supreme Court,
first nomination
hearing to be televised.
The longer senators talk,
the more TV time they get.
The more TV time
they get, the more
they can posture for
voters watching at home.
So the more they talk.
With the cameras rolling,
we’ll see
10 out of the 12
longest hearings ever.
One of those is
for Robert Bork —
“With a negative
recommendation
of 9 to 5.”
— who famously
doesn’t make the cut.
Now onto the aughts.
There’s an 11-year gap
between nominees.
Meanwhile, America has become
more politically divided,
so has the Senate.
“Over and over again —”
“Wait just a second —”
“How many times do we do
this before —”
Here’s Chief Justice Roberts
to explain
what happened next.
“I mean, you look at two of
my colleagues, Justice Scalia
and Justice Ginsburg,
for example.
Maybe there were two or
three dissenting votes
between the two of them.”
Yep, three votes against
Ginsburg in 1993.
No votes against
Scalia in 1986.
“Now you look at my
more recent colleagues
and the votes were, I think,
strictly on party lines.”
That’s pretty much right.
“And that doesn’t
make any sense.”
And that’s how we got here.
“I’m not looking to take
us back to quill pens.”
Very long —
“Nah, I just asked you where
you were at on Christmas.”
Always very political —
“So your failure to answer
questions is confounding me.”
— very public Supreme Court
confirmation hearings.
Also, something else to notice:
Sometimes these nominees
give pretty similar answers.
“The right to
privacy is protected
under the Constitution
in various ways.”
“And it protects the right to
privacy in a number of ways.”
“In various places
in the Constitution.”
“In a variety of places
in the Constitution.”
“It’s protected by
the Fourth Amendment.”
“The Fourth Amendment
certainly speaks
to the right of privacy.”
“It’s founded in the
Fourth Amendment.”
“The first and
most obvious place
is the Fourth Amendment.”
