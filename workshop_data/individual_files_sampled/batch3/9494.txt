Sean: JOINING US NOW, LOTS OF BREAKING NEWS. FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN RON DeSANTIS I'M HOPING WILL BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA, THE SUNSHINE STATE. FULL DISCLOSURE FOR YOU DOPES OVER AT MSNBC, AND SARAH CARTER, LET'S START WITH YOU. WHILE I WAS SPEAKING WITH YOU LAST NIGHT, AND WE WERE SPEAKING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WE WERE BOTH WORKING OUR RESOURCES, AND THEN AGAIN THIS MORNING AT 7:00, THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE RELEASED DOCUMENTS FROM THE DOJ EARLY IN THE MORNING, THEN THEY PULLED THEM BACK. WHAT HAPPENED? THE DOD GA FIELD TO MENTION THAT WHEN THEY ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE THE DOJ, SAYING THEY WOULD TURN OVER DOCUMENTS NEXT WEEK OR AT LEAST ALLOW CONGRESS TO REVIEW DOCUMENTS NEXT WEEK EITHER MONDAY OR TUESDAY, AND ASK MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD REQUESTED ON APRIL 24TH, WHICH WAS A SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BASICALLY SHED LIGHT ON THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. IT IS THESE DOCUMENTS THAT THE DOJ AND FBI ARE RETURNING TO TURN OVER TO LAWMAKERS. THEY HAVE BATTLED WITH THEM ON MAY 24TH, REMEMBER THAT MEETING THAT THEY HAD TO WEAR THE DOJ AND FBI WERE SUPPOSED TO SHARE DOCUMENTS WITH NUNEZ AND REPRESENTATIVE TREY GOWDY AND OTHERS, AND THEY DID NOT. THEY IN FACT TOLD THEM THAT THEY WOULD NOT SHARE THOSE DOCUMENTS WITH INVESTIGATORS ON THEIR COMMITTEE. SO THIS HAS BEEN A BACK-AND-FORTH BATTLE. THEY REFUSED TO TURN THEM OVER THIS MORNING AND INSTEAD ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE LATE LAST NIGHT THAT NOBODY WAS AWARE OF EXCEPT FOR THE REPORTERS. BUT THE CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS WERE LEFT IN THE DARK. THEY HEADED TO CAPITOL HILL AND WERE WAITING FOR THE DOCUMENTS, AND ONCE AGAIN, THEY WEREN'T THERE. Sean: ALL RIGHT, I GOT SOME BREAKING NEWS IF I CAN THROW THE SITE YOU WILL. THIS WAS IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES," FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE HEADLINE IS, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEES AS TIMES REPORTER'S EMAILS AND PHONE RECORDS IN LEAK INVESTIGATION. OFFICIALS SECRETLY SEIZING A YEAR WORTH OF "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER'S PHONE AND EMAIL RECORDS THIS YEAR AND INVESTIGATION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION LEAKS. EXCUSE ME, DON'T WE HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT HERE? BY THE WAY, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE DEFENDING "THE NEW YORK TIMES," THEY DO SUCK. BUT WAIT A MINUTE, THEY DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO THIS REPORTERS NOTES AND RECORDS. ARE THEY ALLOWED TO PROTECT THEIR SOURCES? DO WE HAVE FREEDOM OF PRESS? THAT SOUNDS SCARY TO ME, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? IT'S ALSO AGAINST THE BACKDROP, NO ONE HAS BEEN PROSECUTED WHO HAS ACTUALLY DONE LEAKING SINCE THIS ADMINISTRATION TOOK OVER. REMEMBER MICHAEL FLYNN AT INTERCEPT, THE PFIZER INTERCEPT, THAT WAS LEAKED GRATUITOUSLY BY SOMEBODY, PROBABLY AN OBAMA HOLDOVER. THERE HAVE BEEN A CASCADE OF LEAKS AND NO ONE HAS BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS. I NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE. I KNOW THERE IS A FORMER STAFFER ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE INDICTED. I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS WORKING FOR A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, ALTHOUGH I HAVE MY GUESTS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE A SERIES OF LEAKS AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY UP TO THIS POINT. Sean: I WILL TELL YOU, THE NEWS MEDIA, AND THEY WRITE THIS IN THE TIMES PIECE, MINING A RECORD FOR SOURCES WITH A MASSIVE INTRUSION INTO THE FIRST AMENDMENT. SARAH CARTER, WE WORKED SOURCES LAST NIGHT AND IT'S NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS WHO WE TALK TO OR WHO YOU TALK TO, WHO I TALK TO. MUELLER DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO THIS INFORMATION. Sarah: ABSOLUTELY. I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT OVERALL, WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE, LOOK. JAMES CLAPPER HAS NOW BEEN OUTED PRETTY MUCH AS SOMEONE WHO THE CONGRESS BELIEVES HAD LEAKED INFORMATION TO CNN. WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT CONVERSATIONS 'S PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WERE LINKED TO THE MEDIA, BUT THAT DOES NOT GIVE THE RIGHT FOR THE DOJ TO START MINING REPORTERS' TELEPHONE NUMBERS, AND INFORMATION TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO WAS THE LEAKER. I THINK THEY PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHERE THE LEAKS ARE COMING FROM. GIVE POLYGRAPHS. Sean: MAYBE THERE IS A LEAK AT THEIR OWN OFFICE. Sarah: EXACTLY. IF MIKE FLYNN GAVE SOME POLYGRAPHS TO FIND OUT WHO WAS LEAKING INSIDE OF THE DOJ OR THE OFFICE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, THESE ARE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED LEAKS. Sean: THIS IS HUGE NEWS AND I'M JUST PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. "THE NEW YORK TIMES," EVEN THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP IS COMMENTING ON THIS. MAYBE THEY WILL REALIZE THAT PEOPLE LIKE SEAN HANNITY AND SARAH CARTER AND GREGG JARRETT AND SO MANY OF US WERE RIGHT, BECAUSE WE POINTED OUT PFIZER ABUSES, LYING TO PFIZER COURT JUSTICES, OMISSION BY LYING TO PFIZER COURT JUSTICES, AND, HILLARY CLINTON'S CRIMES, AND THE DUAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY, ONE FOR HILLARY, AND FIXING INVESTIGATIONS WITH EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. THAT HAS BEEN OUR POINT THE ENTIRE TIME. HOW DO WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS? AND COME UP THEY FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO PROVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT ACTIVITIES. ROSENSTEIN, AS SARAH SAID IT, EVEN JUST LAST NIGHT WAS REFUSING TO TURN OVER THESE DOCUMENTS. THEY ARE BREAKING CERTAIN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAYING, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT THE FBI TO DO. IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN, SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DOCUMENTS, SHOW CONGRESS, SO WE CAN SEE HOW GOOD OF A JOB YOU DID. THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO DO THAT TELLS ME THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS SO-CALLED COLLUSION INVESTIGATION. THEY WON'T SHOW US THE PAPADOPOULOS STUFF, THEY WON'T SHOW US THE INFORMATION ABOUT HELPER. YOU HAVE TO ASK WHY THEY WON'T COME CLEAN. Sarah: WHAT WAS THE SCOPE OF ALL OF THIS? I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS ONE SMALL PORTION OF MASSIVE ABUSE, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE THE TRUTH BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY RELIES ON THE FOUNDATION THAT WE BUILT OURSELVES UPON AND IT'S NOT MEANT FOR SPYING, IT'S
