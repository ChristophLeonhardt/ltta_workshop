fun little story for you guys Donald
Trump's back at it with really awkward
hand-holding and handshakes McCrone the
leader of France is in Washington he's
gonna do have issues with him and his
second he's had issues with handshakes
with him before as well but first we're
gonna go to Melania because she is
apparently having trouble deciding
whether she should hold his hand this is
gonna be a really fun video but I want
to give you context first now earlier
I'm actually gonna go to video 9 first
video 9 is from when they were in Israel
and he was trying to grab her hand on
the tarmac let's take a look at what
happened there now we're gonna go to
so that hand SWAT was awesome
and it's obvious that they're having
some sort of issues well the repeat
comes in today let's take a look at the
beginning of this video
well that was uncomfortable watch both a
little creepy and sad let's give you the
full context now here's the video
overall we're at the end she finally
takes his hand watch
and at the end he says thank you to her
he says thank you that's his wife
now I do have a picture that might
explain why let's go to that
well now it's screwed but anyway you get
well so is he so is she anyway you get
it okay so now we go and move on at
McCrone now yeah we're gonna go back in
time to last year when they first have
their first awkward handshake because
this is fun
no that's this year not yet guys
we're gonna go to the videos let's go to
video 10
children okay anyway Trump has made it
public that he likes to have a firm
handshake and be the last one holding
the shake now Mike Rowan knows that and
has publicly said that that is why he
won't let go so they have these
incredibly long bizarre awkward and
shakes it's almost the opposite of
Melania she just want anything new of
this hand a macaron can't let it go
here's another handshake from last year
thank you very much oh yeah yeah okay
now fast forward to present day did they
do it again well and another awkward one
this is fun let's watch people's thank
you thank you I like him a lot
relationship in fact I'll get that
little piece of dandruff or little piece
we have to make them perfect he is
perfect vive la France
messy long live the United States long
live France thank you
what's going on here I know the French
sometimes kiss on both cheeks not
usually at the presidential level but
okay he's kissing him I like to scry a
lot he's cleaning them up and then the
little tap on the hand but I'm not
letting it go
neither one of us is letting it go dude
both of you let it go so one last
picture for you guys this also happened
for God's sake let go it's this man
maybe what Trump is doing is he's trying
to make up for how little Melania holds
his hand if you liked this video
bless your heart we got a lot more where
that came from we do a full show every
day Monday through Friday come enjoy
