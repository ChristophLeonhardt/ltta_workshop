1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
Senator Durbin thanks for joining us
President Trump says the newness memo

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:11,700
totally vindicates Trump in the probe
does it no of course it does not and the

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,320
fact that the Republicans in the House
refused to allow a Minority Report the

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,550
Democratic response to their memo is an
indication that this they're just bound

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,230
and determined to continue to find ways
to absolve this president from any

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,390
responsibility I agree completely with
John McCain it was John McCain who said

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,559
trying to undermine the FBI and the
Department of Justice is really not in

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,790
the best interests of America and
frankly it's doing Putin's work we ought

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,500
to be trying to focus on a investigation
and a professional level by Bob Muller

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,600
and not trying to find a way to obstruct
justice or to absolve this president

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,860
from any responsibility he has I want
you to take a listen to what the House

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,879
Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin
Nunez said about the allegations laid

13
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,180
out in the memo of FISA abuse take a
listen

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,700
I think the American people understand
that the FBI should not go to secret

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,840
courts using information that was paid
for by the Democrats to open up

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,830
investigations get warrants on people of
the other political party now come type

17
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,950
of stuff that happens in banana
republics now it seems as though the

18
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,880
judge was told that the information from
the steal dossier was funded by a

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
political source but it was not
specifically referred to as having been

20
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,070
paid for by the Democratic National
Committee and the Clinton campaign do

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,939
you think that's problematic

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,380
what Nunez conveniently ignores this
investigation was under way too long

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,790
before the involvement of the steel
dossier and in fact the court was

24
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,020
advised that there was a political
source to it the judge in issuing a FISA

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,430
warrant has to weigh whether or not
there's something in the background here

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,070
that should disqualify the issuance of a
warrant and he decided repeatedly that

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,270
it did not the Nunez memo if they
allowed the Democratic response to come

28
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,890
out would be discredited itself the
information the facts tell a totally

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,030
different story
so senator just to play devil's advocate

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,750
here one could really look at this
objectively and say look I get what

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,060
you're saying about the new
his memo but the Democratic Party isn't

32
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,170
exactly bathed in glory here Mother
Jones magazine broke the story of the

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,420
dossiers existence in October 2016
the intelligence chiefs felt the need to

34
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,810
brief the incoming and outgoing
presidents of the existence of the

35
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,870
dossier in January 2017 and the fact is
the public didn't find out that the

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,860
Hillary Clinton campaign in the DNC paid
for the dossier until a little over

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:46,140
three months ago in October 2017 this
dossier was used for this FISA warrant a

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,900
surveillance warrant of a trump official
and the Clinton campaign and the DNC

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,230
didn't disclose that isn't that
problematic I could tell you that that

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,700
is one piece of evidence its credibility
has to be judged by law enforcement

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,739
officials first ultimately by a judge
and perhaps by a jury but to say that

42
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,660
that's the end of the investigation but
this is all the Donald Trump needs to

43
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,860
fire Rosenstein or to fire Bob Muller
I'll just tell you this could

44
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,120
precipitate a constitutional crisis if
the House Republicans believe they've

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,590
set the stage for this president to end
this investigation they are basically

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,329
saying that in America one man is above
the law and that's not a fact I've got

47
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,900
to make sure that we explore all the
possibilities and all the evidence I

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,410
want to get to that and I understand
your larger point but would you would

49
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,930
you grant the point that the DNC and the
Clinton campaign should have disclosed

50
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:48,209
much earlier than they did to the public
that they actually funded this dossier

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,739
of course you know as well Jake that the
actual political motivation and

52
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,470
beginning of this was on the Republican
side

53
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,250
it was then switched over where there
was Democratic funding it really goes to

54
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,030
the credibility but that is an issue
that the judge and issuing the FISA

55
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,019
warrant takes into consideration and all
of at least some other Trier of fact

56
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,950
will as well but the same now that we
can say as the president said it's all

57
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,010
over stopped the investigation I'm above
the law

58
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,760
and I shouldn't be investigated any
further that is an extreme position and

59
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,029
it's inconsistent with one of the
fundamental rules of law in this country

60
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,450
well I think in point of fact the
opposition research project was funded

61
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,620
by Republicans but this
dossier per se was funded by Democrats

62
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,039
but this appears to be a dry well so I'm
gonna move on before the memo was

63
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,520
released Democrats were sounding the
alarm that putting it out could

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,849
compromise national security and
intelligence sources and methods take a

65
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,430
listen to the ranking member of the
House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff

66
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:49,090
last week I think we have crossed a
deeply regrettable line in this

67
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,330
committee where for the first time in
the 10 years or so that I've been on the

68
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,710
committee there was a vote to politicize
the declassification process of

69
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,319
intelligence and potentially compromise
sources and methods do you see any

70
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:08,590
evidence of sources and methods
compromised in the memo I tell you I

71
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,909
can't answer that without being on the
inside and understanding the sources it

72
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:17,319
was the FBI itself not Adam Schiff whom
I respect very much but the FBI itself

73
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,439
that said the release of this memo would
be reckless

74
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,250
that was their work reckless and yet the
House Republicans were bound and

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,150
determined to do this in order to stop
this investigation of the president and

76
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,620
those around him I want to ask you it's
about the fact that the president as you

77
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,580
alluded to it seems pretty clear from
the response of Trump and his allies to

78
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,629
the memo that it could if not likely
will be used as pretext for the

79
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,960
President to fire Deputy Attorney
General rod Rosen Stein or Special

80
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,930
Counsel Bob Muller what will you do if
he does if he carries out either one of

81
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,279
those actions listen this would be an
extreme event and one that I say with

82
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,210
some caution could create a
constitutional crisis in this country

83
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,860
the question at that moment is whether
or not the majority Republicans in the

84
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,849
House and the Senate will stand up for
the rule of law in the Constitution if

85
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,080
the president takes that extreme
position trey gowdy who's retiring from

86
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,759
the house and republican conservatives
in South Carolina said he saw nothing in

87
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,310
this memo that undermined the
investigation and he still had

88
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,539
confidence in Bob mower I hope people
like mr. Gowdy will continue to make

89
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,430
those statements and stand behind the
rule of law if the president takes this

90
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,360
extreme action this precipitous action
I'm afraid that it could lead to a

91
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,440
confrontation we do not need an America
but can you be more specific about what

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,279
Democrats might do

93
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,979
well I can't I don't want to predict
that I think that's too hypothetical but

94
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,969
we understand what the Constitution says
we must do and that is hold everyone in

95
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,090
the United States including the
president the United States accountable

96
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,259
if they have violated the law no one
including the president is above the law

97
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,020
let's switch to immigration the
Democrats have been protesting the

98
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,129
changes that President Trump has
proposed to the legal immigration system

99
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,719
limiting family reunification or
so-called chain migration so it's only

100
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,620
for spouses and minor children and
ending outright the diversity Visa

101
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,210
Lottery you in 2013 voted for the gang
of eight immigration bill that contained

102
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,500
similar provisions ending visa diversity
lottery and eliminating the ability of

103
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,389
brothers and sisters to enter the
country on family reunification visas so

104
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:33,529
why oppose it when President Trump is
proposing at this time the answer is

105
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,069
very obvious the comprehensive
immigration reform dealt with 11 million

106
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,330
people in the United States and gave
them a path to legal status over a long

107
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,460
period of time we swept away all of the
existing applications for family members

108
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,319
of seeking visas over three million of
them were going the backlog was going to

109
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,919
be wiped away and we were going to bring
them into the United States and then

110
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,789
moving forward change the standard that
is not what President Trump is

111
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,719
suggesting understand what they are
proposing they want to cut legal

112
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:06,560
immigration into the United States a
family members some of whom have waited

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,449
20 years or more to join up with their
families here this is no longer about

114
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,129
the security of the United States it is
not about competition for American jobs

115
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:20,509
it is an effort by them to make a
different immigration policy in the

116
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,740
future one that envisions in America
that is much different than it is today

117
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,539
this is not an acceptable premise
senator has CNN poll after the

118
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:32,630
government shutdown when Democrats
forced the government shutdown over the

119
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,549
over the dreamers two weeks ago found
that 56% of Americans polled thought

120
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,958
that keeping the government opened was
more important than continuing daca the

121
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,769
next deadline to fund the government is
Thursday do you vow right now that you

122
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:49,160
will not shut the government down again
if there's not a dock a deal before the

123
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,610
deadline there is not likely to be a
dock idea though we're working every

124
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,380
single day on telephone calls and
person-to-person to try to reach this

125
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,160
bipartisan agreement I think we're
making real progress I want to salute

126
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,230
the moderates in both the Republican and
Democratic caucuses in the Senate they

127
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,769
have really been a positive voice
Democrats and Republicans sitting in the

128
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,880
same room working to try to solve this
problem I don't see a government

129
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,350
shutdown coming but I do see a promise
by Senator McConnell to finally bring

130
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,310
this critical issue that affects the
lives of hundreds of thousands of people

131
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,240
in America finally bringing it to a full
debate in the Senate that's what we were

132
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,660
looking for when there was a shutdown we
have achieved that goal we're moving

133
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,910
forward
Senator Durbin I understand you're

134
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,430
rooting for the Patriots this evening
I'm not gonna bring up the subject and I

135
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,750
hope you have an OK Sunday night thanks
so much for watching for joining us I

136
00:09:41,750 --> 00:00:00,000
mean thanks Allen
