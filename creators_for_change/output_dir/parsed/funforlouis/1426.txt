there's been another awesome day that's
such a good time in the water park
earlier quite a lot of my friends have
gone home now but I'm staying till
Thursday I think getting a lift with
Dave I thought I'd answer a few more of
your questions before I go to bed um
someone said did I go to college and if
so what did I study I went to sixth form
college I didn't a level in IT fine art
and graphic design and I got an A in
graphic design a B in fine art and a C
and IT and I did a year of biology but
got kicked off the course because I kept
on falling asleep how long does it take
to edit a daily vlog
anything from half an hour to two hours
kind of depends but I kind of find it
therapeutic and it's a nice challenge to
kind of do at the end of the evening
anyway I'll leave it there I don't know
what we're doing tomorrow yeah I think
we might try to find some horses and go
horse riding on the beach that's what
I've heard
so that should be fun
anyway peace out enjoy life and live the
adventure Bay
