>> Bret: WELCOME TO THE
METROPOLITAN THEATRE HERE IN
MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA, AND
THE KICKOFF OF THE 2018 MIDTERM
PRIMARY DEBATE.
GOOD EVENING, I AM A BRET BAIER.
>> Martha: I AM
MARTHA MacCALLUM, YOU WILL
HEAR FROM THE CANDIDATES TAKING
ON JOE MANCHIN IN NOVEMBER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON HERE IN
2016, AND REPUBLICANS BELIEVE
THAT THIS SEAT MAY BE RIPE FOR
THE TAKING.
>> Bret: WE WILL MEET THE
CANDIDATES, FIRST WE HAVE EVAN
JENKINS, REPRESENTING THE THIRD
DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA.
THEN WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY
GENERAL PATRICK MORRISEY, AND
FINALLY FORMER CEO DON
BLANKENSHIP.
WELCOME.
>> Martha: THE RULES OF THE
DEBATE ARE SIMPLE, CANDIDATES
WILL HAVE 60 SECONDS TO ANSWER
THE QUESTIONS, 30 IF THEY ARE
GIVEN A FOLLOW-UP AFTER THAT
QUESTION AND THEY ALSO GET 30
SECONDS IF THEIR NAME IS
MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE OTHER
CANDIDATES.
>> Bret: IF THE CANDIDATES GO
OVER THEIR ALLOTTED TIME, THEY
WILL HEAR THIS.
WE DO NOT LIKE TO DO THAT,
BECAUSE SOME OF THE DOGS AT HOME
THINKING THAT SOMEBODY IS AT THE
DOOR.
LET’S TRY NOT TO USE THE BELL
AND GET GOING.
>> Martha: AS YOU ALL KNOW,
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC HAS HIT THE
COUNTRY HARD.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN GREAT
DETAIL, BUT LET’S GET STARTED AT
THE TOP OF OUR QUESTIONS.
>> Bret: GROSSMAN JENKINS, YOU
ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE STAGE
BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADING IN THE
FOX NEWS POLL IN THIS RACE, YOUR
OPPONENTS ON THE STAGE HOWEVER
CALL YOU A CARD CARRYING MEMBER
OF THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT.
YOU VOTED FOR THE 1.3 TRILLION
DOLLY OCEAN SPENDING BILL THAT
CONSERVATIVES CALLED UPLOADED
MATERIAL AND REPUBLICANS ALIGN
WITH MITCH McCONNELL ARE
SPENDING MONEY TO HELP YOUR
CAMPAIGN.
SO HERE’S THE QUESTION, HOW DO
YOU CONVINCE WEST VIRGINIA
VOTERS THAT YOU CAN DRAIN THE
SWAMP IF THEY THINK THAT YOU ARE
A PART OF IT?
>> THANK YOU, BRET AND MARTHA
AND TO EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT ARE
HERE THIS EVENING.
FROM A PROUD WEST VIRGINIA, I
HAVE NOT BEEN UP IN THE SWAMP A
VERY LONG.
I TOOK OUT A 38 YEAR INCUMBENT
JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
I AM UP IN WASHINGTON ACTUALLY
WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS
ESTABLISHMENT.
I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE SWAMP.
AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE AN
ELECTION MAKES.
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE
WEST VIRGINIA TURNING AROUND.
WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,
STANDING UP WITH HIM.
I PROUDLY ENDORSED
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE MAY
THE ONLY ONE UP HERE ON THE
STAGE WHO DID THAT AND HAVE BEEN
STANDING WITH HIM EACH AND EVERY
DAY.
SO WE ARE BRINGING REAL RESULTS,
YES, WE ARE CUTTING TAXES AND
REDUCING REGULATION.
MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN
WEST VIRGINIA.
LEADING THE COUNTRY IN A LOT OF
WAYS TO STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE
BELIEVE IS WEST VIRGINIANS.
>> Bret: CONGRESSMAN,
THANK YOU.
>> Martha: MR. BLANKENSHIP,
YOU WERE IMPRISONED ON A
CONVICTION IN THE MINE EXPLOSION
CASE, YOU HAVE BLAMED THE OBAMA
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THAT
ADMINISTRATION’S WAR ON COAL,
BUT TOO MANY OF THESE MINING
FAMILIES DID BLAME YOU.
CAN YOU BLAME THEM IF THEY DO
NOT THINK THAT IT IS RIGHT FOR
YOU TO GO FROM THE JAIL CELL TO
THE UNITED STATES SENATE?
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT IS A
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO BE
ASKING.
TO THE QUESTION WE NEED TO BE
ASKING IS WHETHER WE CAN PREVENT
A BIG BRANCH FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN.
AT THIS TIME AND HAVE THEM
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IT
IN HALF AND FINISHED ALMOST
EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THERE WAS
EXISTENCE FOR 17 YEARS EXPLODED.
BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT
BLAME ME, THEY BLAME THE COAL
MINERS WERE NOT DOING THEIR JOB,
WHICH WAS TERRIBLY UNTRUE.
NEARLY 400 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,
THEY DID THEIR JOB.
AND I PLEA BARGAIN DURING THE
TRIAL, THAT WOULD’VE BEEN
AMAZING THAT THE MINERS DID NOT
DO THEIR JOB, I CANNOT DO THAT.
FACING 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A
FIXED CHARGE, AND I BEAT ALL
THREE OF THE FELONY IS, THEY PUT
ME IN JAIL, BECAUSE I DID NOT
STOP THE COAL MINERS FROM
TELLING EACH OTHER THAT THE
INSPECTORS HAD ARRIVED.
THAT IS NOT A LAW THAT IS ON THE
BOOKS.
THAT IS A LAW THAT THE OBAMA
PROSECUTORS MADE UP IN
REPARATION FOR THE TRIAL.
THE TRIAL WAS VIOLATED OF A
PERSON’S HUMAN RIGHTS TO A FAIR
TRIAL.
TODAY DID THINGS LIKE IN ORDER
TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE THAT
THEY HAD TO GIVE THE DOCUMENTS
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE AT
TRIAL, THEY GAVE US 1 MILLION
AND A HALF DOCUMENTS AND SAID
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO USE THE
DOCUMENTS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
THEY SENT ME IMPRISONED FOR A
MISDEMEANOR, I WAS THE ONLY
PRISONER THAT WAS A MISDEMEANOR.
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING
TO THE END THAT IT WAS A FAKE
PROSECUTION.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
THOSE THAT SAY THAT YOU HAVE
MADE IT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DEATHS OF THOSE 29
MINERS?
>> I AM ACCEPTING THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN.
THE GOVERNMENT CUTS IT IN HALF.
THE JOB WAS FINISHED EIGHT HOURS
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION.
THERE’S NOT MUCH YOU CAN SAY
ABOUT IT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE
ATMOSPHERE NO MATTER WHETHER YOU
HAVE SHARP BIDS, DOLE BEDS, PLUG
WATER SPRAYS, NO SPRAYS COMING
HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE
ATMOSPHERE.
TO THE WAY YOU PREVENT IT IS A
LOT OF AIRFLOW, AND THESE GUYS
THEY DO THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO
MAKE THAT CHANGE.
THEY SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THEM
AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH.
>> Martha: WHY DID YOU INSIST
THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE THAT
CHANGE?
>> BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT
THEY WERE MAKING THE CHANGE.
WHEN YOU HAVE 119 COAL MINES, IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH
WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING.
WE NEED TO BRING IT TO A
REGULATORY INSPECTOR GROUP AND
INVESTIGATIVE GROUP LIKE THE NTS
IN THE AVIATION INDUSTRY WHEN
YOU USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE
WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A RELIEF
VALVE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU
DO NOT WANT THEM TO DO FOR YOUR
ENGINEERS AT ODDS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT ENGINEERS, THEY
SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DICTATE
WHAT YOU DO.
>> Bret: MR. MORRISEY, THIS IS
NOT YOUR FIRST ATTEMPT TO GET
ELECTED INTO CONGRESS.
YOU RAN IN YOUR NEW IN JERSEY,
WHICH JENKINS MENTIONS ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
JOE MANCHIN GREW UP HERE AND
NEVER LEFT.
HE WILL SURELY CALL YOU A
CARPETBAGGER.
SO HOW DO YOU COUNTER THAT
CLAIM?
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE
FOX NEWS IS GIVING US TO BE HERE
TONIGHT TO SHOW OFF
WEST VIRGINIA.
WE HAVE AN AMAZING STATE.
AND I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT I
AM ONE OF THE FOLKS UP HERE WHO
MOVED TO THE STATES BY CHOICE.
I LOVE WEST VIRGINIA WITH ALL OF
THE FIBER IN MY BEGINNING.
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL,
I KNEW THAT WE NEEDED A CHANGE.
WE HAD A 20 YEAR INCUMBENT WHO
WAS WREAKING HAVOC ON THE STATE
OF WEST VIRGINIA.
I KNEW THAT WE NEEDED A
CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER TO GO AFTER
OBAMA OVERREACH AND GIVE OBAMA
EVERYTHING HE HAD.
FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO WIN IN
COURT TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME
AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.
IF ANYBODY RAISES WEST VIRGINIA
VALUES, SHOW ME SOMEONE WHO HAS
DONE MORE TO GO AFTER THE
ABSOLUTE WRETCHED EXCESS OF THE
BARACK OBAMA ERA.
WE WENT AFTER IT AND WE WON THE
CLEAN POWER PLAN, THE LEGAL
AMNESTY.
WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR
PRO-LIFE PRINCIPLES.
WE ARE THE CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER
OF ANYONE STANDING HERE TONIGHT.
>> Martha: WE HAVE BEEN
WATCHING ALL OF THE COMMERCIALS
AND THE ADS GOING AFTER EACH
OTHER.
SO CONGRESSMAN JENKINS, FROM
NEW JERSEY, WHAT ARE NEW JERSEY
VALUES AND WHAT IS WRONG WITH
THEM?
>> YOU LOOK AT THE AD WHEN HE
RAN FOR CONGRESS IN NEW JERSEY.
GREAT PICTURE OF HIM IN HIS
CAMPAIGN LOGO WITH NEW JERSEY
AND THE AD SAID I WILL STAND UP
AND FIGHT ANYBODY WHO GOES
AGAINST JERSEY VALUES.
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE NEED SOMEBODY
REPRESENTING OUR VALUES.
YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR VALUES
JUST BECAUSE YOU CHANGE YOUR
ZIP CODE.
>> Martha: WHAT ARE JERSEY
VALUES AS OPPOSED TO
WEST VIRGINIA VALUES?
>> WE HAVE TWO FOLKS FROM JERSEY
HERE, I WILL LET YOU TALK ABOUT
IT.
>> Martha: I’M JUST CURIOUS
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM.
>> YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE YOU
BEING HERE.
WE DO WELCOME OUTSIDERS.
WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE.
PEOPLE NEED TO BE COMING TO
WEST VIRGINIA FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS.
PATRICK MORRISEY GREW UP IN
JERSEY, MADE ALL OF HIS LIVING
IN THIS MONEY AND THE MILLIONS
OF BUCKS LOBBYING
WASHINGTON, D.C., AND THEN HE
WENT BACK TO JERSEY TO RUN FOR
CONGRESS.
AND HE DID ON HIS JERSEY VALUES.
HE CAME IN LAST PLACE IN THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THEN HE
MOVED BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C.,
MAKING MORE MONEY.
THEN HE CAME TO WEST VIRGINIA,
PUT HIS NAME ON THE BALLOT.
WEST VIRGINIANS SEE THROUGH
THAT.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SHOPPING FOR A
STATE FOR YOUR POLITICAL CAREER.
CANDIDLY, WE HAVE THAT WITH A VY
WELL-HEELED DEMOCRATS WHO
MOVED TO WEST VIRGINIA OUT OF
THE NORTHEAST.
ONCE THEY SET UP SHOP, IT IS
TOUGH TO GET THEM OUT.
WE WELCOME OUTSIDERS.
WE LOVE PEOPLE MOVING TO
WEST VIRGINIA.
BUT WE WANT THEM COMING TO
WEST VIRGINIA FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS.
>> Bret: LET’S HAVE A RESPONSE
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL MORRISEY.
>> IT IS VERY CLEAR, WEST
VIRGINIANS WANT SOMEONE WITH
CONSERVATIVE VALUES.
I LOOK UP HERE ON STAGE AND I
CAN SAY THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE
ON THIS STAGE WHO HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A CONSERVATIVE.
I HAVE BEEN STRONGLY PRO-LIFE MY
ENTIRE CAREER.
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, THERE
IS A REASON WHY I AM THE
ENDORSED SECOND AMENDMENT
CANDIDATE, THE CONSERVATIVE BACK
CANDIDATE, BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW
THAT I HAVE THE CONSERVATIVE
WEST VIRGINIA VALUES.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONGRESSMAN,
HE ACTUALLY HAS BEEN VERY
LIBERAL IF YOU GO OBAMACARE,
CHECKED A BOX, HE SUPPORTED,
HILLARY, HE WENT AND RALLIED FOR
HER.
NANCY PELOSI, JOHN KERRY,
PLANNED PARENTHOOD SPENDING JUST
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
EVAN, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR
YOURSELF OR THAT OUTRAGEOUS VOTE
KILLING THE UNBORN.
>> FORTUNATELY PATRICK IS NOT
BEING HONEST.
THERE IS NOT A PENNY IN THE BILL
THAT WE PASS TO FUND THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT THAT IS GOING TO
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
IF ANY MONEY GOES TO PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, THAT WILL BE THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
I ACTUALLY LED THE CHARGE AND
FOUGHT TO DEFUND PLANNED
PARENTHOOD.
I’VE STOOD UP FOR LIFE, AND AS A
MATTER OF FACT, THE NATIONAL
RIGHT TO LIFE ORGANIZATION HAS
GIVEN ME A 100% VOTING RECORD.
I’M THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY HAS A
VOTING RECORD, PATRICK, DAWN,
THEY CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THEY
WILL VOTE TO 100% PRO-LIFE, 100%
DEFENDING THE SECOND AMENDMENT
WITH THE NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE,
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I WILL NOT
ALLOW YOU TO CHALLENGE MY
WEST VIRGINIA VALUES, MY PROUD
HISTORY OF FIGHTING FOR OUR
STATE EACH AND EVERY DAY OF MY
LIFE.
>> Bret: MR. BLANKENSHIP,
LET’S GET YOU IN THE MIX PAID
WHEN YOU ARE ASKED ABOUT THE
CARPETBAGGER QUESTION, A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAVE HOUSES IN DIFFERENT
STATES, BUT ISN’T IT TRUE THAT
YOU LIVE IN NEVADA?
YOU PAY TAXES IN NEVADA?
AND YOUR PROBATION OFFICER IS IN
NEVADA, BUT YOU ARE RUNNING FOR
U.S. SENATE IN WEST VIRGINIA?
>> YES, PROBABLY PAY MORE TAXES
THAN ANYBODY ON THIS STATE TO
WEST VIRGINIA.
AND IF IT WAS NOT FOR ME,
UP HERE.
IT IS FUNNY THAT PAT SAYS ONLY
CONSERVATIVE ON THE STAGE,
CONSERVATIVES WERE NOT EVEN
POPULAR IN WEST VIRGINIA THEN I
CAUSED THEM TO BE CONSERVATIVE
BY INVESTING $5 MILLION OF MY
OWN MONEY.
HONESTY, IT IS FUNNY TO HEAR
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT HONESTY.
I THINK THAT THAT IS ODD.
AND AS FAR AS A VOTING RECORD, I
VOTED FOR THE UNBORN AND I HAVE
GIVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS TO WRITE FOR LIFE.
THAT IS A REAL VOTE.
BEING ABLE TO USE THE STATES
MONEY, THAT IS PRETTY EASY TO
DO.
IT DOES NOT TAKE ANY PERSONAL
SACRIFICE TO DO THAT.
I HAVE MADE A LOT OF PERSONAL
SACRIFICES IF YOU WILL TO STOP
THE BOMB THAT WOULD HAVE WASTED
MONEY IN WEST VIRGINIA CUT YOUR
FOOD TAX.
THOSE TYPES OF SACRIFICES WHEN
YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE OR YOU
TAKE A POSITION THAT IS NOT
POPULAR IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO
TAKE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.
YOU CANNOT DRAIN THE SWAMP BEING
LIKE THE SWAMP.
>> Bret: IF JOE MANCHIN COMES
AFTER YOU FOR LIVING IN NEVADA,
WHAT YOU SEE A QUESTION MARK >>
THAT HE HAS LIVED IN D.C. TOO
