Numan rat that kills time by helping out in an emergency kitchen his family sought refuge in this government shelter after they were forced to leave their village three months ago the Indonesian government has ordered families not to return as long as the volcano remains at its highest alert level my future looks pretty bleak if I have to stay here in the shelter how can I pay for my children's education I've got no work here at least 70,000 villages in the danger zone have been forced to leave their homes but three months have passed and boredom has kicked in local authorities are struggling to keep them away from danger every morning no man like many others goes up the mountain back to his village a thirty kilometer journey by motorbike Cebu de village lies nearest to the crater and yeomen knows exactly how dangerous the volcano can be just five kilometers away with Mount Agron looming dangerously near no man and his neighbors are mining stones and sand spewed from the eruption fifty-four years ago the villagers are getting some benefit from the natural disaster then I forced myself to be brave enough although the government doesn't allow it I'm fed up in the shelter how long do I have to stay there so while only a little smoke comes out of the volcano I take my chance to earn some money in case there's a major eruption no man hopes he will have enough time to run while the government continues to urge people to stay out of the danger zone its policy has recently become more lenient because the situation is taking so long and because of volcanoes activity is not always high we allow people to get back to their villages during the daytime to work and come back to the shelter at night but no man decides not to return to the shelter and spend the night at his house trying desperately to get his old life back hoping and praying that Mount Agung will go back to sleep very soon step fasten al-jazeera Cebu de village Bali
