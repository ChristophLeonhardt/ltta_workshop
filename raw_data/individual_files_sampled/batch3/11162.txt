another Palestinian anti-occupation rally expected in Gaza on Friday as part of the ongoing great a great march of return in the past month the event has seen 40 Palestinians killed and over 5000 injured the Israeli army denies using excessive force against the protesters it also accuses Hamas which controls Gaza of using children to carry out acts of terrorism Israel's Defense Minister her call has called on people not to approach the border meanwhile Doctors Without Borders recently released a report saying their teams have provided medical care to over 600 Palestinians injured by bullets since the start of the month they also say that the number of patients treated in just three weeks of this month is higher than the number treated during all of 2014 that was the year of the Gaza war we spoke with the head of the mission in Palestine who believes many of the injuries will result in disabilities what I can tell you is that what about doctors and their surgeon will observe we observe very wide injuries the Israeli we use a disproportionate use of the force and we use live ammunition against protesters I think this it is a most important point to remind you sister burns completely destroyed in the colon we have a lot of fragments you see vascularization enough which are affected so it means that all the wounds is is is completely exploded and these people they are fractures we have very severe injuries so it means that they will request a lot of time for the rehabilitation we will need some surgeries so it's not a question of just to be strident which will last a lot of months and even for some of them years and we are quite sure that some of them will be disabled and we are very afraid of the high risk of infection with the bones which are exposed we know already that in Gaza it would be very difficult to treat these complications and that we will be obliged to request special authorization for the patient to go outside being scalene was one calling Jolla we've sent a request to the IDF asking for comment on the Doctors Without Borders report as well as on claims that its crowd dispersal methods can leave people with serious disabilities so far no response on that inquiry meantime Israel says it uses non-lethal sponge tip to bullets however they're believed to be a harder and heavier than previous versions they can not only cause severe injuries but can kill has happened in 2014 but an Israeli human rights group recently released a video showing soldiers in the West Bank discussing the use of live ammunition one Israeli ex-policeman received a nine-month sentence for killing a Palestinian teenager in 2014 the court accepted the claim that he had mistaken a live bullet for a rubber one the story caused outrage after earlier this month a Palestinian girl was sentenced to eight months in jail for slapping an Israeli soldier and we asked political commentator amir oren to comment on the two crimes and punishments course it is not symmetrical and when one puts on a scale eight months for just longing at an officer or trying to slap him in the face and nine months for the earlier case it doesn't seem just but yes there is no level playing field always and everywhere in the world governments will give their uniformed personnel more leeway and would be more lenient towards them then thoughts those who resist the government we may find it totally unjust but this is the reality and not only in Israel
