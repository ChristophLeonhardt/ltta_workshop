EASILY CLEARED THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE. BRET. Bret: PETER DOOCY LIVE ON THE HILL. THANK YOU. NOT A FULL DISMANTLE OF DODD-FRANK BUT A BIG WIN FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. VOTERS ARE GOING TO THE POLLS IN TEXAS, ARKANSAS, KENTUCKY, GEORGIA. CORRESPONDED JONATHAN SERRIE'S IN GAINESVILLE, GEORGIA, RIGHT NOW WITH AN INTENSE BATTLE AMONG REPUBLICANS BUYING FOR SPOT ON THE GUBERNATORIAL TICKET THERE. GOOD EVENING, JONATHAN. GOOD EVENING, BRET. I AM AT THE CASEY CAGLE WATCH PARTY. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ENJOYS STATEWIDE NAME RECOGNITION BUT HE'S 1 OF 5 G.O.P. CANDIDATES IN THE PRIMARY. A JULY RUNOFF APPEARS INCREASINGLY LIKELY IN THIS RACE. THE OTHER STATEWIDE OFFICE HOLDER IN THE REPUBLICAN RACE FOR GOVERNOR, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE BRIAN KEMP.

FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE STACY ABRAMS HAS BEEN RUNNING A DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGN TO ATTRACT NEW VOTERS WITH LEFT-LEANING VALUES. YESTERDAY ABRAMS PICKED UP THE SUPPORT OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHO RECORDED A ROBO CALL FOR HER. SHE HAS THE ENDORSEMENT OF SENATORS KAMALA HARRIS, CORY BOOKER, AND BERNIE SANDERS. BRET, TONIGHT DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING TONIGHT'S PRIMARY TO SEE WHICH OF THOSE TWO STRATEGIES RESONATES MOST WITH VOTERS AND THEN YOU WILL LIKELY SEE THAT STRATEGY IN FUTURE CAMPAIGNS GOING INTO THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. FOR REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE OF THE SHEER NUMBER OF G.O.P. CONTENDERS, THIS RACE MAY NOT BE DECIDED TONIGHT. ANALYSTS SAY THE CAMPAIGN FOR A RUNOFF ELECTION FOR THE G.O.P. COULD BE BOTH NASTY AND VERY
