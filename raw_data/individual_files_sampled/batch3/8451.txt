THIS IS "THE FIVE." KANYE WEST MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SPARKING A MEDIA FIRESTORM A QUICK REFRESHER OF WHAT WENT DOWN YESTERDAY. YOU KNOW, THEY TRY TO SCARE ME TO NOT WEAR THIS HAT. MY OWN FRIENDS. BUT IN HAT, GIVES ME POWER IN A WAY. WHEN I PUT THIS HAD ON, MAILED ME FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN. IF HE DON'T LOOK GOOD WE DON'T LOOK GOOD. THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT. HE HAS TO BE THE FLIEST, THE FLIEST PLANES, I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. LET ME GIVE THIS GUY A HUG. LY ON HAVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. Dana: THE SITDOWN SETTING OFF CNN'S DON LEMON. WHAT DID YOU THINK, DON? WOLF, LISTEN, I DON'T I HAVE NO ANIMOSITY FOR CAN TE WEST. WHAT I SAW KANYE WEST. WHAT I SAW WAS A MINSTREL SHOW, HIM IN FRONT OF ALL OF THE WHITE PEOPLE EMBARRASSING HIMSELF AND EMBARRASSING AMERICANS, BUT MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS. IT WAS SO HARD TO WATCH. HIM SITTING THERE BEING USED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Dana: LEMON TAKING HIS DISAPPROVAL FURTHER, INVOKING THE RAPPER, HILLS LATE MOTHER HIS LATE MOTHER. AN EMBARRASSMENT. KANYE'S MOTHER IS ROLLING OVER IN HER GRAVE. I SPOKE TO ONE OF HER FRIENDS TODAY, TEXTED WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS FROM CHICAGO, I USED TO LIVE THERE. SHE SAID DANDA WOULD BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS. SHE WOULD BE TERRIBLY DISTURBED BY THIS. HE NOODZ A FATHER FIGURE, SOME ONE TO HELP HIM, GUIDE HIM, HE NEEDS TO HUG MORE THAN ANYTHING. KANYE, BACK AWAY FROM THE CAMERAS, GO GET SOME HELP, AND THEN COME BACK AND MAKE YOUR CASE. Dana: OTHERS IN THE MEDIA BLASTING THE KANYE-TRUMP SUMMIT. WATCH THIS. THIS IS SUCH A BLITZKRIEG OF BLATHERRING IGNORANCE, AS A MAN WHO LOVES KANYE WEST, WHO ADMIRES HIS GENIUS, AND CONSIDERS HIM A FRIEND. THIS IS THE KIND OF CONVERSATION THAT WOULD TYPICALLY HELD BETWEEN PEOPLE WEARING HOSPITAL BRACELETS. A DEEP SENSE OF BETRAYAL AMONG PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW HIP-HOP AND RAP. THIS WAS A GIANT, SHINY OBJECT IN THE OVAL OFFICE WEARING A RED HAT. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET THOUGHTFUL PLAY-BY-PLAY AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS YOU ARE NOT. THAT WAS AN ASSAULT ON OUR WHITE HOUSE. WHY GIVE IT THE HYPE, WHY FAN THE FLAMES OF THE FOOLISH? AND IT'S NOT OKAY WHAT HAPPENED HERE. Dana: CELEBRITIES CRITICIZING KANYE, FELLOW RAPPER T.I. POSTING, THIS IS THE MOST REPULSIVE, DISGRACE WHY, ACT OF DESPERATION AND AUCTIONING-OFF OF ONE'S SOUL TO GAIN POWER I'VE EVER SEEN. OTHER HOLLYWOOD STARS, CHELSEA HANDLER, ROSIE O'DONNELL SLAMMING IT. BUT WE WANT TO GET TO THE DISCUSSION. JESSE, HYSTERIA, OVER THIS MEETING, WAS HOT AND HEAVY. Jesse: RIGHT. SO, IF KANYE IS SO MARGINALIZED AND SO INSIGNIFICANT AND SUCH A CLOWNIES THE MEDIA SO ANGRY? WHY ARE THEY SO UPSET? HE'S INFLUENTIAL, BECAUSE HE'S MAKING A LOT OF MONEY, HE'S VERY TALENTED. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIM, HE'S POPULAR. IF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS OPEN-MINDED ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEN THAT POSES A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO DEMOCRATS ELECTORALLY. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE WRITTEN OFF THE WHITE WORKING CLASS, WRITTEN OFF VETERANS, THEY HAVE WRITTEN OFF A KEY CONSTITUENCY WITHIN THE PAR THINK. EF PARTY. THEY HAVE TO DRIVE UP NUMBERS WITH MINORITIES TO SAY THERE WITH DONALD TRUMP IN 2020. THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR THEM. YOU REMEMBER WHEN KANYE WEST SAID GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. THE SAME MEDIA THAT IS CRITICIZING HIM NOW APPLAUDED HIM THEN. WHEN YOU CRITICIZE, A BLACK MAN, A REPUBLICAN YOU'RE SANE. AND THEN WHEN YOU SPREAD LOVE TO A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT YOU'RE INSANE? I DON'T LIKE HOW THAT WORKS. DONALD TRUMP WON ABOUT 8% OF THE BLACK VOTE. DOES THAT MEAN ALL THOSE 8% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE CRAZY? THEY'RE IG NOMPBT? THEY'RE ALL FOOLS? IGNORANT? WOMEN WHO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP ARE THEY GENDER TRAITORS? HISPANICS? WHEN THE MEDIA SAYS THAT VOTING AS A BLACK MAN FOR DONALD TRUMP IS AGAINST YOURSELF INTERESTS, WHO ARE THEY TO DETERMINE WHO IS SOME ONE'S SELF INTEREST. WHY CAN'T BLACK AMERICANS DETERMINE THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST BY THEMSELVES. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE LIBERAL MEDIA TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON BALANCE, DONALD TRUMP'S TRADE AGENDA, MANUFACTURING AGENDA, IMMIGRATION EVEN GENTLEMAN, IS BENEFICIAL TO BLACK VOTERS. POLICY-WISE. AND YOU CAN DISLIKE HIM FOR OTHER THINGS, THAT'S FINE, BUT ON BALANCE IT'S FAIR FOR BLACK AMERICANS TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN CONSIDER THE TRUMP AGENDA. BACK IN 2005, AT LEAST IN THE LAST RECENT PAST, KANYE WEST APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING THAT. Juan: I WAS SOME ONE HIGHLY CRITICAL WHEN HE SAID THAT ABOUT PRESIDENT BUSH. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. HERE YOU COME, WHY CAN'T BLACK PEOPLE BE OPEN-MINDED ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP? GUESS WHAT, JESSE, BY YOUR OWN MEASURE 92% OF BLACK PEOPLE SAID OUR SELF INTERESTS IS NOT BEING SERVED BY THE AGENDA BEING PROMOTED BY THIS PRESIDENT. Jesse: HE CAN'T THINK FOR HIMSELF? Juan: IF HE WAS THINKING FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE HAD SOME SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT TO MAKE. INSTEAD HERE'S WHAT HE SAID, JESSE. OH, I POUT THIS HAT, AND IT GIVES ME SUPER POWER. I REALLY WANT A FATHER FIGURE. THEN HE SEPARATED BY THE DESK, HAS TO WALK AROUND, HE'S THERE HUGGING TRUMP LIKE HE'S HOLDING ON. HE'S TRYING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS. Jesse: JIM BROWN Juan: LET ME FINISH. YOU HEAR THIS MAN, SAY STUFF LIKE, TRUMP IS ON A HERO'S JOURNEY. MAYBE HE'S ON A FOLLY. I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT ALL LOOKED LIKE, SOME GUY RANTING, AND I AM, PERSONALLY OFFENDED, BY THE KIND OF PROFANITY HE BROUGHT. THERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYBODY WOULD TOLERATE THAT. I DON'T GET THIS. WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE COMMON, JAY-Z, KENDRICK LAMAR DOING THINGS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA THE RIGHT WING WENT NUTS, THEY SAID THEY'RE RAPPERS, SOME OF THEM ASSOCIATE WITH THUGS AND BEGANSTERS. WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY? THE MAN WHO INSULTED REPUBLICANS, THE MAN WHO HAS NO TO SAY OTHER THAN HIS HAT GIVES HIM SUPER POWER IS A REPUBLICAN HERO? THIS IS RIDICULOUS, ABSURD. DON LEMON, AMEN. THIS IS SOME ONE WHO IS A SHAMEFUL EXAMPLE OF BEHAVIOR IN THE PRESENCE OF A POWERFUL WHITE MAN. Jesse: IT WAS SHAMEFUL HE WENT AFTER HIS MOM LIKE THAT. Juan: HE DIDN'T GO AFTER HIS MOTHER, HE SAID HIS MOTHER WOULD BE ROLLING OVER. Jesse: THAT WAS A CHEAP SHOT. Juan: YOU DISTORT THIS RGS CONFIDENCE. THIS WAS NOT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE OR HIS IMPACTS ON THE BLACK VOTE. THIS IS HOW WHITE AMERICANS, WHO SAY, HEY, TRUMP HAS PROBLEMS WITH RACE, FEEL ABOUT TRUMP. NOW TRUMP SAYS, HEY LOOK, AMERICA, I HAVE A BLACK FRIEND IN A RED HAT. Dana: THE REASON I WAS LOOKING LIKE THAT, WE HAVE TAPE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. President Trump: FROM TURKEY, IN GOOD SHAPE, HE WILL BE STOPPING IN GERMANY FOR A FULL CHECKUP, AND THEN HE'S GOING TO BE COMING TO THE OVAL OFFICE, MOST LIKELY, ON SATURDAY. BUT WE'RE VERY HONORED TO HAVE HIM BACK WITH US. HE SUFFERED GREATLY BUT WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO PASTOR BRUNSON IS IN THE AIR, HEADING TO GERMANY, AND THEN COMING TO THE U.S. HE WILL BE LANDING ON SATURDAY, MOST LIKELY SATURDAY IN D.C. WHAT IS THE RELIEF, MR. PRESIDENT? President Trump: WELL, WE SPOKE TO TURKEY. AND HE WENT THROUGH A SYSTEM, AND WE GOT HIM OUT. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM OUT FOR A LONG TIME. President Trump: THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING, NO DEAL WAS MADE AT ALL, NO DEAL. BUT WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE HIM. AND HAVE HIM IN GOOD SHAPE. I HEAR HE'S IN VERY GOOD SHAPE. MR. PRESIDENT ARE YOU REEVALUATING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI ARABIA? President Trump: WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE TERRIBLE SITUATION IN TURKEY, HAVING TO DO WITH SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE REPORTER, AND NOBODY KNOWS QUITE YET, NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FORM IDEAS. AS THEY'RE FORMED WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. BUT IT CERTAINLY IS A TERRIBLE THING. HAS THEIR RECORD BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR TOO LONG? President Trump: A LOT OF RECORDS ARE OVERLOOKED IF YOU LOOK AT IRAN, IF YOU LOOK AT SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, SYRIA, A LOT OF COUNTRIES, A LOT OF COUNTRIES' RECORDS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS THING AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IN A VERY SERIOUS MANNER. AND WE'LL SEE YOU, WE HAVE A BIG CROWD. HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE KING OF SAUDI ARABIA? President Trump: I HAVE NOT. I WILL BE CALLING HIM. I WILL BE CALLING AT SOME POINT KING SOL ON MOP, YOU'RE RIGHT IN A WAY. I'M SURE THEY THINK YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING GUY. MAYBE NOT THAT GOOD FROM THE BACK, RIGHT? YOU PLAN TO CALL HIM President Trump: I WILL BE TALKING TO HIM. WHAT THE CONVERSATION BE LIKE? President Trump: THEY ARE LOOKING HARD AND FAST, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO FIND OUT. IT'S NOT JUST US. IT IS POTENTIALLY A TERRIBLE SITUATION. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WAS IT A MISTAKE FOR JARED TO DEVELOP A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP? President Trump: I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ANY CLOSER THAN OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. WE HAVE A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LOT OF COUNTRIES. BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THANK YOU. President Trump: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING OVER TO AN INVESTMENT CONFERENCE. HE ACTUALLY CALLED THIS MORNING, AND HE WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. BUT HE WAS PARTIALLY OVER THERE ANYWAY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING OVER TO THE INVESTMENT CONFERENCE. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. MAYBE SOME WON'T BE GOING. WE'LL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION VERY SOON. WE'LL SEE YOU OVER AT THE RALLY. . Dana: PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT PASTOR BRUNSON, THE AMERICAN WHO WAS RELEASED FROM CAPTIVITY, BEING HELD BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT, AND NOW HE IS GOING TO BE RETURNED TO AMERICA. THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE SHOULD BE BACK IN D.C. BY SATURDAY. PROBABLY SATURDAY, A SFO IN GERMANY FOR A CHECKUP, THEN RETURNING TO AMERICA A BIG WIN FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE GLAD THAT PASTOR BRUNSON IS BEING RETURNED TO AMERICA. SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HELD IN THE FIRST PLACE. BACK TO THE STORY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, JESSE AND JUAN HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT KANYE WEST MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND REACTION TO IT. GREG AND JEDEDIAH HADN'T HAD A CHANCE. SGG GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE PASTOR, WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T BLINK. THEY KNEW HE WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE HIS MIND. Dana: AND THE ECONOMY IS IN A FREE FALL. Greg: I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT THAT LEMON AND OTHERS HAVE, WHEN YOU DESCRIBE SOMEBODY AS A MINSTREL OR A PROP. I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE, ANY CRITICISM THAT CAN BE APPLIED EVERYWHERE IS USELESS. IT'S POINTLESS. FOR EXAMPLE, I COULD JUST AS EASILY LOOK AT DON LEMON AND SAY WOW CNN PULLED OUT THEIR PROP, THEY NEEDED SOMEBODY TO TALK ABOUT KANYE, SO THEY CALLED UP THE BLACK GUY. YOU CAN USE THIS. YOU CAN USE THIS ON "THE FIVE" WITH JUAN, I CAN CALL YOU A PROP BUT I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. THIS SORT OF CRITICISM CAN BE APPLIED ANYWHERE THERE ARE BLACKS AND WHITES TOGETHER. THAT'S MY POINT. WHEREVER YOU SEE AN OLIVE BRANCH BETWEEN A BLACK PERSON AND A WHITE PERSON, SOMEBODY CAN SAY, HA, THE WHITE IS USING HIM AS A MINSTREL AND THE BLACK IS SEEKING POWER. YOU CAN SAY THAT FOR EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHY IT'S DANGEROUS, WHY NOT JUST TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE ACTUALLY 6G A DIALOGUE, WHEN YOU REDUCE SOMEBODY TO A MINSTREL, OR YOU MAKE OR YOU HAVE THE GAL TO ACTUALLY BRING UP HIS LATE MOTHER TO MAKE A POINT, USED HIS LATE MOTHER AS A VESSEL FOR YOUR OWN ENVY, WHAT I SAW THERE, I SAW LEMON, A PERSON, WHO FELT INEFFECTUAL, HE'S NOT PART OF THE GAME. HE SEES WHAT'S ON GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE, LEMON IS SAYING WHY CAN'T THAT BE ME, THAT'S NOT FAIR, I SHOULD BE THERE. HE WENT AFTER THIS GUY, BECAUSE THIS GUY HAS THE GUTS TO STAND UP AND TAKE THE SLINGS AND ARROWS. IF CNN WERE AROUND 2,000 YEARS AGO, THE C WOULD STAND FORS CRUCIFY HIM. Dana: JEDEDIAH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE COMMENTS HE'S MENTALLY ILL, THAT FELT OVER THE LINE. WHAT BOTHERS ME, THEY HAVE INFAN TALLIZED KANYE. HE'S SUCCESSFUL, A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, NOT TALKING NONSENSE, STOP AND FRISK, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE CARES ABOUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ALL OF THE CELEBRITIES THAT WENT INTO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, YOU THINK THEY WERE ALL POLICY EXPERTS? THEY WENT IN AND SAT DOWN, DANA PERINO? NO, THEY HAD AN OPINION, THEY CARED ABOUT ISSUES, THEY WENT IN, THEY MADE THEIR CASE. THE CRITICISM FROM THE RIGHT WAS NOT PERSONAL ATTACKS OF THOSE PEOPLE. IT WAS NOT SAYING THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT KANYE THAT HE'S DUMB, HE'S SICK, HE'S A MADMAN, A TRAITOR. PEOPLE WERE SAYING, FOLKS ON THE LEFT, WERE GOING IN, CELEBRITIES ON THE LEFT GOING IN TO MEET WITH OBAMA AND ALL THAT, THE COMMENTARY WAS, WELL THIS IS TYPICAL, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS AND HOLLYWOOD ARE HAND IN HAPPENED. NO ONE WAS GOING OUT THERE AND SAYING PERSONALLY, GEORGE CLOONEY IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE. THIS IS OVER THE LINE. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HANDLE DISSENT. THEY CAN'T HANDLE DISSENT. SOME ONE WHO HAS LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY HER WHOLE LIFE, I WENT TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, I TAUGHT IN LIBERAL ACADEMIA, WHEN YOU STAND OUT, THERE IS A PATTERN ON THE LEFT OF HAVING TO MARGINALIZE THAT PERSON, HAVING TO POINT OUT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM, DRIVE THEM OUT. THEY ARE TRYING TO RUIN THIS GUY'S CAREER. AND RUIN HIS CREDIBILITY. AND THEY'RE GOING TO STOP AT NOTHING. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT WHETHER I AGREE WITH KANYE OR NOT THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED. Juan: GREG, I DON'T WANT IT TO GO WITHOUT COMMENT, I DON'T THINK I'M A TOKEN. Greg: THE SEE THE POINT. Juan: I DON'T AGREE, NO ONE WOULD SAY THAT TO YOU. I DON'T THINK GIVEN MY RECORD THERE'S ANYWAY YOU SAY, OH, JUAN WILLIAMS IS SUPERFICIAL. GS I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LOOKING AT COLOR, OH, THERE'S A BLACK PERSON AND A WHITE PERSON. Juan: YOU AS A WHITE PERSON, I WOULD SAY, LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT JEDEDIAH IS LOOKING AT, LET'S MAKE A JUDGMENT. WHEN I LOOK AT THE SUBSTANCE I SAW NOTHING BUT A PUBLIC REWHAT ISES OPPORTUNITY. PUT ON BY THE PRESIDENT. MAYBE KANYE DECIDING IT HELPS HIS REPUTATION. Greg: I AM THE TOKEN SHORT PERSON.
