>> Harris: MEGHAN KELLY'S NBC
TALK SHOW COULD BE IN JEOPARDY.
HOWIE KURTZ JOINS US NOW.
>> MEGHAN KELLY HAS TALKED HER
WAY INTO BIG TROUBLE AND FOX
NEWS CAN NOW CONFIRM HER JOB
HOSTING THE THIRD HOUR OF THE
TODAY SHOW IS EXPECTED TO END
PER HAPPENS IN THE NOT TOO
DISTANT FUTURE.
KELLY WAS ASKED TO STAY HOME
TODAY AND TOMORROW AFTER FIERCE
CRITICISM WHICH INSIDERS SAY WAS
ALMOST UNANIMOUS WITHIN NBC NEWS
OVER RACIALLY CHARGED REMARKS
SHE MADE OF ALL THINGS
HALLOWEEN.
>> WHAT IS RACIST?
YOU GET IN TROUBLE IF YOU ARE A
WHITE PERSON WHO PUTS ON BLACK
FACE OR BLACK PERSON WHO PUTS ON
WHITE FACE ON HALLOWEEN?
WHEN I WAS A KID THAT WAS OKAY
AS LONG AS YOU WERE DRESSED LIKE
A CHARACTER.
>> THAT LED TO AN APOLOGY FIRST
IN A LETTER TO HER COLLEAGUES
AND THEN HER VIEWERS.
>> I'M MEGYN KELLY.
I WANT TO BEGIN WITH TWO WORDS.
I'M SORRY.
I LEARNED THAT GIVEN THE HISTORY
OF BLACK FACE BEING USED IN
AWFUL WAYS BY RACIST IN THIS
COUNTRY, IT IS NOT OKAY FOR THAT
TO BE PART OF ANY COSTUME,
HALLOWEEN OR OTHERWISE.
>> A SERIES OF LEAKS IS SAYING
THAT ANDREW LACK HAS HAD
DISCUSSIONS WITH KELLY BY ENDING
HER SHOW BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
ALSO BLACK SAYING HE CONDEMNED
THE BLACK FACE REMARKS THAT HAVE
BEEN HEAVILY COVERED BY NBC.
THE FACT IS WHILE SHE APOLOGIZED
TO THE STAFF, SOME NBC STAFFERS
ARE STILL UPSET.
KELLY'S ALSO PARTED COMPANY WITH
HER TALENT AGENCY.
IT WAS A HUGE STORY WHEN KELLY
LEFT FOX WHERE SHE WAS BEST
KNOWN FOR CLASHING WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER ACCUSING
THE LATE CHAIRMAN OF SEXUALLY
HARASSING HER.
DESPITE A $17 MILLION A YEAR
