00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
hi friends I am NOT a punctual person I

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,480
haven't talked about this yet because

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,740
there are certain people that I don't

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to know this about me and get the</font>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,290
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea hi future employers I will be</font>

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,870
on time for work but I tend to have a

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">more casual relationship with time when</font>

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,240
it comes to less important things like

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,119
my mental health if one shows up at

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's appointed time to my therapist</font>

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,170
office<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will come down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the waiting</font>

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">area and greet you but if you don't well</font>

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,440
here's every text that I have for my

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,630
therapist on my phone hi come up when

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,219

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,620
hi come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> up when you're I come on up</font>

17

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,730

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,430

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,739
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was thinking we're at three on my way</font>

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,690
coming up and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived come up when</font>

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,840
you get here and finally come on up when

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,390
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived oh man those tiny sentence</font>

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,420
variations are so charitable like I

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,000
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't feel her getting more sick</font>

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,339
of my every time showing up on time

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,229
at this point would be like kind of

28
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,840
inconsiderate she knows she's got four

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
to seven minutes to check her phone

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,430
maybe get a glass of water<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font>

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,650
want to ruin<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for her honestly I</font>

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,140
know my lateness could be fairly

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,810
perceived as a lack of respect for other

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,420
people's time and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible about</font>

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,000
that but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's less that I don't</font>

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,610
care about making people wait it's just

37
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I believe in myself more than I</font>

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in physics like when google maps</font>

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
tells me it takes 18 minutes to walk

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,580
somewhere I'm re-routing that down

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,410
my head look I'm a fast Walker I could

42
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,540
do it in 15 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in 15 minutes</font>

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,370
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to be there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm walking</font>

44
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">around my house with a mascara wand in</font>

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,000
one hand trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out where i</font>

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,250
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off my socks and i think i</font>

47
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,350
could probably listen to the last six

48
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,120
minutes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this podcast and still be ok</font>

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,220
so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm out the door I've got</font>

50
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,380
seven minutes and point 82 miles and

51
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,840
very short legs and it just doesn't math

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,310
you know they tell you you can do

53
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,010
anything if you set<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mind to it</font>

54
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,720
except for become a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video game with</font>

55
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hedgehog but my biggest problem is that</font>

56
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,880
other people seem to believe in me<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

57
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,000
like I show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just all oh no</font>

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,620
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no problem or we weren't even</font>

59
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,600
waiting that long or if I don't

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,490
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> profusely they don't even</font>

61
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,410

62
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,380
nice to me i would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> shame once</font>

63
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,380
just once for being late I would never

64
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,420
do it again just once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show up</font>

65
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,650
