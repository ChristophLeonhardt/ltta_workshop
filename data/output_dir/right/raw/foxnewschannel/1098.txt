1
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,963
>> Julie: SO DEMOCRAT JOE

2
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:13,332
MANCHIN HINTING HE COULD SUPPORT

3
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:14,733
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2020.

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,668
THE WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR FACING

5
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:19,805
A TOUGH RE-ELECTION BATTLE IN

6
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:22,708
NOVEMBER SAYS HE REGRETS BACKING

7
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,476
HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016.

8
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:26,945
HE TELLS POLITCO, I'M OPEN TO

9
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:27,946
SUPPORTING THE FIRST WHO I THINK

10
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,482
IS BEST FOR MY COUNTRY AND MY

11
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:31,016
STATE.

12
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,785
IF HIS POLICIES ARE BEST, I'LL

13
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:34,953
BE RIGHT THERE.

14
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:37,589
JOINING US NOW, FORMER

15
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,625
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR

00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:44,997
SENATOR MARCH RUBIO, ISAAC

17
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:45,330
WRIGHT.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,099
THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

19
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:47,966
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

20
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,469
>> Julie: YOU AS A DEMOCRAT,

21
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,104
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF MANCHIN'S

22
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:54,139
HINT OF SUPPORTING PRESIDENT

23
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:54,873
TRUMP?

24
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:56,508
>> BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE

25
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:58,477
LIKE JOE MANCHIN AND WASHINGTON

26
00:00:58,477 --> 00:00:59,545
POLITICIANS, WHETHER YOU AGREE

27
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:01,346
WITH HIM OR NOT, JOE MANCHIN

28
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:04,550
TELLS YOU WHAT HE THINKS, WHERE

29
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:04,950
HE STANDS.

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,718
THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN SO

31
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:07,119
SUCCESSFUL.

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,588
HE STOOD UP FOR THE ISSUES IN

33
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:10,589
WEST VIRGINIA OVER AND OVER

34
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:12,124
AGAIN AGAINST WASHINGTON NO

35
00:01:12,124 --> 00:01:13,792
MATTER WHAT THE POLITICAL PRICE.

36
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,627
HE TELLS YOU HOW HE FEELS, TELLS

37
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:17,262
YOU WHAT HE BELIEVES.

38
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:18,564
HE STICKS BY IT.

39
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:20,132
>> AS A DEMOCRAT, DO YOU SUPPORT

40
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,934
HIM SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT?

41
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:24,837
>> I SUPPORT RETAKING THE SENATE

42
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:25,204
MAJORITY.

43
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:26,505
I THINK JOE MANCHIN WILL FIGHT

44
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,307
FOR THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA

45
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,709
AND DO IT IN GOOD CONSCIOUS.

46
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,644
WHEN THE RUBBER HIT THE ROAD AND

47
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,746
DONALD TRUMP PUT UP A TAX PLAN

48
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,215
TO SABOTAGE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE

49
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,783
THAT HAS LED TO MILLIONS LOSING

50
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:40,486
THEIR HEALTHCARE, UP TO 33

51
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:43,155
MILLION MORE LOSING THEIR

52
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:44,923
HEALTHCARE, THE TAX CODE SAYING

53
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:47,726
80% WILL GO TO THE WEALTHIER,

54
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:49,394
JOE MANCHIN TOLD HIM NO.

55
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:50,963
AT THE SAME TIME, HE WORKED FOR

56
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:54,099
THE PRESIDENT ON OTHER ISSUES.

57
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:57,336
MAYBE HE CAN REIN IN THE BAD

58
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:57,669
IDEAS.

59
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:58,871
>> Julie: ALEX IS THIS THE CASE

60
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,005
OF BUYER'S REMORSE?

61
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:00,572
>> NO.

62
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:03,275
WHAT WE HEARD IS A GOOD SPIN.

63
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,877
THAT'S WHAT JOE MANCHIN IS DOING

64
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:05,577
RIGHT NOW.

65
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:06,812
MANCHIN OPPOSED PRESIDENT

66
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,680
TRUMP'S AGENDA, VOTED AGAINST

67
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,884
THE TAX CUTS, REPEALING AND

68
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:13,252
REPLACING OBAMACARE AND NOW

69
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,687
FACING A TOUGH RE-ELECTION

70
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:18,056
BECAUSE HE'S TOO LIBERAL FOR THE

71
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,491
STATE, OUT OF STEP WITH TRUMP

72
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:21,226
WHO IS WILDLY POPULAR.

73
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,427
SO NOW HE'S SAYING THE NICE

74
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,029
THINGS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT,

75
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,732
SAYING HE MIGHT SUPPORT HIM IN

76
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:27,032
2020.

77
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:28,600
I WOULD WELCOME HIS SUPPORT.

78
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,870
IT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL FOR

79
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,972
HAVING MANCHIN SUPPORTING HIM.

80
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,807
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR, MANCHIN IS

81
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,176
PLAYING POLITICS.

82
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:41,446
>> Julie: OR IS HE A CHAMELEON?

83
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,748
IT IS JUST SURPRISING TO HEAR

84
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,450
THAT MANCHIN WILL ACTUALLY

85
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,185
CAMPAIGN AGAINST A REPUBLICAN

86
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:49,087
AND BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATS ARE

87
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,623
GOING TO BUY THAT HE HIMSELF IS

88
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,926
GOING TO FOLLOW IN LINE WITH

89
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:54,927
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE'S BEEN

90
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:56,929
OF COURSE, A BIG SUPPORTER OF

91
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:57,796
COAL MINERS.

92
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,631
HE APPLAUDED THE STATE OF THE

93
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:00,766
UNION ADDRESS.

94
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:04,670
HE BACKED GINA HASPEL.

95
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,872
HE MADE A NUMBER OF MOVES AWAY

96
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:08,106
FROM TRUMP LIKE OPPOSING

97
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,142
OBAMACARE REFORM AND TAX REFORM.

98
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:11,910
HOW ARE DEMOCRATS --

99
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,612
>> HE OPPOSED OBAMACARE

100
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:14,846
SABOTAGE.

101
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,149
HE OPPOSED THE SABOTAGE OF

102
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,584
HEALTHCARE FOR 33 MILLION

103
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:18,951
AMERICANS.

104
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:21,453
HE OPPOSED RESTRUCTURING THE TAX

105
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,589
CODE IN A WAY THAT DEVASTATES

106
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:25,324
WORKING WEST VIRGINIANS.

107
00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:27,826
WHETHER IT'S D, R, WHATEVER

108
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:28,927
WASHINGTON WANTS TO SAY, JOE

109
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:29,895
MANCHIN STANDS UP FOR THE PEOPLE

110
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:30,929
OF WEST VIRGINIA.

111
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:32,431
IN THE END, THAT WILL COUNT.

112
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:33,665
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

113
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,867
PEOPLE WILL IDENTIFY WITH THAT,

114
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,769
NOT WITH A NEW JERSEY LOBBYIST

115
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:40,138
MOVED TO WEST VIRGINIA TO TURN

116
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:40,539
POLITICIAN.

117
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,741
>> Julie: GO AHEAD, ALEX.

118
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,376
>> LOOK, YOU'RE HERING THE

119
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:49,848
ATTACKS ON PATRICK MORRISEY.

120
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:51,817
VERY WELL-RESPECTED IN WEST

121
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,951
VIRGINIA, RUNNING A STRONG

122
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,120
CAMPAIGN AND WILL PROBABLY

123
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,787
WIN --

124
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:57,723
>> WELL-RESPECTED BY THE OPIOID

125
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:58,123
LOBBY.

126
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,591
>> HOWEVER, JOE MANCHIN IS

127
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,392
PLAYING POLITICS HERE.

128
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,027
HE VOTED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT

129
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,962
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND FACING A

130
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,797
TOUGH CHALLENGE AND NOW HE LOVES

131
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,632
THE PRESIDENT.

132
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,367
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE HAD A ABOUT

133
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,568
WASHINGTON D.C. AND WHY THEY

134
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,036
DON'T LIKE POLITICIANS.

135
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:15,674
>> Julie: IT IS POLITICS --.

136
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:19,711
>> WEST VIRGINIA IS THE APEX

137
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,947
FROM THE OPIOID CRISIS, THIS IS

138
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:25,617
A PHARMACEUTICALS --

139
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:27,586
>> Julie: IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD

140
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:28,487
FOR MANCHIN.

141
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,389
THE REPUBLICAN IS OBVIOUSLY

142
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:31,056
AHEAD THERE.

143
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,190
SO --

144
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,060
>> NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAST

145
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,394
PEOPLE.

146
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:37,012
55

147
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:37,329
5

148
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,197
55% APPROVAL RATINGS.

149
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,832
TRUMP IS 57% --

150
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,267
>> Julie: WE STILL HAVE MONTHS

151
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:42,567
AWAY.

152
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,970
IF WE LOOK AT THE PRESIDENTIAL

153
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,171
ELECTION, THEN CANDIDATE TRUMP

154
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,439
WON THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

155
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,774
BY MORE THAN 40 POINTS.

156
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:50,709
SO MAYBE HE'S GOING TO TRY TO

157
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,044
LATCH ON TO THE WINNER?

158
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:55,013
THAT'S THE WHOLE PART OF WHAT

159
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:55,947
WE'RE TRYING TO SAY.

160
00:04:55,947 --> 00:05:01,320
>> AND OBAMA WAS OUTPERFORMED.

161
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,388
>> Julie: AND THE FACT THAT HE'S

162
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,589
GETTING BEHIND THE PRESIDENT IS

163
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:05,357
HELPING HIM.

164
00:05:05,357 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF DEMOCRATS
