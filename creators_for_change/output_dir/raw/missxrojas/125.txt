00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,879
things done by a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things done i mean</font>

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,130
about 17,000 before the project for

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,830
Sabrina's on Friday and before I have to

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">do all these other things before i go</font>

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the light just went out</font>

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,809
inconsiderate there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot to get done</font>

9
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a bit of a weird morning</font>

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,590
like not necessarily difficult but just

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,630
when those mornings where you just can't

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,550
by the time it got to about<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine am I</font>

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,140
could right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eat an</font>

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,300
English muffin of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is nothing</font>

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,619
English other than the fact that they

16
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not crumpets and we're doing is</font>

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,940
going which is to be expected as I said

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,880
yesterday lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on it's fine i'll</font>

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,440
get it done today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was actually can</font>

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,270
talk to you about subscribers but i'm

21
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,320
not gonna do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now because i</font>

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
will get back to work any<font color="#E5E5E5"> my feet that's</font>

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,489
a note to my future<font color="#E5E5E5"> self oh it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 530</font>

24
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">mike the clock of my cooker is lying i</font>

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't even ate you at kearney let's see</font>

26
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,989
it earlier today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to talk about</font>

27
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,610
the idea of subscribers and

28
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,260
subscriptions because we see this word

29
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,239
everywhere when we use in youtube even

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,550
like on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> note on the screen oh</font>

31
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,140
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> have far too much faith in</font>

32
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,789
how sticky these little less as i got

33
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,440
from paper source are<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway said so why</font>

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,940
don't we interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of lots of</font>

35
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,080
different context probably more than

36
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,670
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> two big definitions come to</font>

37
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,140
mind this is kind of like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

38
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,430
secondary school assemblies when you're

39
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,200
hosting them<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you say a dictionary</font>

40
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,020
definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subscribe is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather the</font>

41
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,880
teachers actively discouraging that and

42
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,710
thinking why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would they do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

43
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,060
always like to know what the oxford

44
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,619
english dictionary definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a word</font>

45
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,330
is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the distinction in dictionaries</font>

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,770
as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i recall is the distinction</font>

47
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">between subscribing to a service and</font>

48
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">their subscribing to like a mode of</font>

49
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,140
thought or an ideology what's

50
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,579
fascinating to me though is where the

51
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,259
two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross over so when you are</font>

52
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,820
subscribed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are in many</font>

53
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,200
ways subscribing to an ideology

54
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,490
especially if you're giving them the

55
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,920
money because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your funding what makes it</font>

56
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,240
possible for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

57
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,409
things when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about things like</font>

58
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,270
later on i think about it in the context

59
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,649
of patron it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't really</font>

60
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,820
thought about it that much in the

61
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,770
context of subscribing that concept of

62
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,320
subscribing and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> aligning</font>

63
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,320
yourself with this thing is really

64
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
interesting to me now one distinction

65
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,030
between patronage and subscription is

66
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,920
that patronage is kind of a top-down

67
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,550
view where the person handling them

68
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,770
has the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a subscription is a</font>

69
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,780
bit more bottom up I think it's

70
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that you subsidize it's a</font>

71
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,300
sub-portion underwriting something but

72
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,460
not sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking down it and</font>

73
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,290
dictating it in some ways it's that's 80

74
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,670
to me at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> we live in such a</font>

75
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,350
subscription heavy culture or what feels

76
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like one to me for many people there are</font>

77
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">several sort of basic subscriptions like</font>

78
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,660
you subscribe to things on YouTube

79
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,760
that's for free aside from<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube bread</font>

80
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,530
which you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it you might</font>

81
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,750
subscribe to like Netflix or Hulu you

82
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,640
subscribe to Spotify or the google music

83
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,350
future or you subscribe to Apple music

84
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,660
which I can't undo on a free trial I was

85
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,430
actually just listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a song that</font>

86
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,650
habits into an ages it's some peaches by

87
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,420
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stranglers and I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never listened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

88
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,710
the lyrics before and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wow</font>

89
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,450
this song<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not what I thought it was</font>

90
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,400
about how naive was I where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

91
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,770
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bambi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esque as does pertain to Bambi</font>

92
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was listening to a famous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

93
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,830
music a few amps ago that's called lads

94
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,650
lads lads points points points fantastic

95
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,480
playlist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just for me like it was</font>

96
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,910
clearly targeted at this demographic and

97
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,870
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that was</font>

98
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,250
seeing more and more now especially with

99
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">paywalls as subscribing to newspaper</font>

100
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,940
services for me personally and this is

101
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,470
true all these services<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

102
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,300
experiences have really narrowed by

103
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,980
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explore things and discover</font>

104
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,180
things there's all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

105
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,340
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people have subscriber</font>

106
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,320
services and pay walls and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

107
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that within one type of subscription</font>

108
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,709
service and looking at the different

109
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,820
ways that they're built and the

110
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,260
different sort of purposes that they're

111
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,880
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve and also the different</font>

112
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,440
ways that people interact with them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,050
subscribe to The Economist but I put it

120
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already mentioned that</font>

I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna mention here i will</font>

you i'm going to have cable subscription

125
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,070
that sort of thing subscriptions for me

126
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,860
then function on the supporting

127
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,720
discovering and reliably sending me<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

128
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,340
of things and then there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> axe</font>

129
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,870
to information<font color="#CCCCCC"> sections that to which</font>

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,280
does play into everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else what's</font>

131
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,629
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me in those models</font>

132
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,010
especially when there are two components

133
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,019
when there's like a free section and a

134
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,330
subscribe section how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that affect</font>

135
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,800
the way the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> is creative is it</font>

136
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
geared more towards people who are

137
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,310
paying subscribers or is it created in a

138
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,080
way that doesn't affect the flat

139
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,820
experience of everyone that some use the

140
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,649
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have when for example I go</font>

141
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,418
on the New York Times website I didn't

142
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:21,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a subscription to the new york</font>

143
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,690
times but I can read these articles and

144
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,340
know that even though i'm getting a

145
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,460
limited amount of stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font>

146
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,960
cut me off after I think it's 10

147
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,760
articles a month in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime I still</font>

148
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,470
have access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same website as</font>

149
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,479
everyone else who is pay I think

150
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,820
probably probably not actually there's

151
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,050
probably something else that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

152
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,669
ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and that world will</font>

153
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,350
forever be unknown to me and then people

154
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,030

always been really intrigued by that and

160
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,570
I might take that up at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

161
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,190
the new year I also was given so I

162
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,840
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid to say it or required to</font>

163
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,360
review it but I was given a like free

first vegan cuts books which any of you

165
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:02,810
guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

166
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">much it's made around on other blogs and</font>

167
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,020
things I haven't released I haven't seen

168
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,400
it much elsewhere but it's a little

169
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,350
books like this with some slightly

170
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,330
larger than sample size vegan products

171
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,100
it has some cool products it has like a

172
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,750
hair milk and a body lotion I think

173
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,860
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an out monish in here</font>

174
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,900
somewhere yeah there's an hour varnish

175
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,789
and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't try to</font>

176
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,289
understand and haven't used yet a

177
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,960
calming blend botanical facial esteem

178
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,419
sounds wages better for me it also had

179
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:30,260
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyeline there from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred</font>

180
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent pure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really liked and</font>

181
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked so much that I've actually</font>

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put it in my handbag and he's at</font>

183
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,650
most days that I where liquid eyeliner

184
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,060
but to me this kind of service is

185
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,250
fantastic for discovery and fantastic

186
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,930
for me be someone who's not sure about

187
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,030
where to start with vegan makeup or

188
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,349
cruelty free makeup that sort of thing

189
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how much it's something</font>

190
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">ongoing or how much is something that if</font>

191
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,060
I stopped it I would start it up again

192
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,860
with music what's appealing to me is

193
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,360
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge library of things that I</font>

194
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,840
can access at any time

195
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,100
it's also something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

196
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,960
use up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't need</font>

197
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to like work my way through that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

198
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,960
of the same with things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> The</font>

199
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Economist I subscribe to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because I'm</font>

200
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,440
getting access to today's articles but

201
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,090
also because I'm getting access to like

202
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,100
this archived articles then the other

203
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,810
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is a financial culture of</font>

204
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,790
charges and like direct debits and all

205
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,440
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff which sometimes can get</font>

206
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,419
really over my head especially in the US

207
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,720
where I feel like the direct debit

208
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,100
mechanisms at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> unlike chase and so</font>

209
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,919
on aren't quite up to speed up to par

210
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,940
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to someone earlier</font>

211
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,710
today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> described the chase website</font>

212
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,590
is something that was built in like

213
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,360
2006-2007 it doesn't refill responsive

214
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
to things but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you</font>

215
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,030
subscribe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something though because</font>

216
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,919
there is a certain like time period

217
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,990
involved you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are making a commitment to</font>

218
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,580
what you're going to want out of this

219
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,919
experience like five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the line</font>

220
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,500
or a months down the line or wherever it

221
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it's obviously different depending on</font>

222
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the severity of your subscription for</font>

223
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,570
example if you subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gym</font>

224
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,560
although I guess you don't really

225
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,090
subscribe to Germany or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of a</font>

226
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,090
gym which is another language play of

227
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,820
the most immense proportions and to me

228
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,110
at least it's a really clear way of

229
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,180
showing that money talks and money is

230
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,370
effective at saying something about

231
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,710
ourselves obviously it doesn't define us

232
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,740
an encapsulating sort of terms but money

233
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,870
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we choose to put on money</font>

234
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">and where we choose to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put our time</font>

235
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,930
coming back to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else with met</font>

236
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,710
yesterday and as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what we expect</font>

237
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,410
to want from our future<font color="#E5E5E5"> selves I think</font>

238
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,150
all of those things say a lot about our

239
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,039
identity so it's fascinating to me

240
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,050
actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube has that term</font>

241
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,400
subscribers I think it's interesting

242
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,780
that you tube which<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

243
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years now was maybe a bit ahead of</font>

244
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,070
the curve on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subscribers thing of</font>

245
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,720
the subscription culture or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

246
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,280
hand it never went away and just as I

247
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,810
become more of an adult and had the

248
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,400
ability to subscribe to things that

249
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">require money of me and the inability to</font>

250
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,720
subscribe to other things that require

251
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,450
money of me it has made me more aware of

252
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,310
it I would be fascinated to hear your

253
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,330
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this front because it's</font>

254
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about constantly and</font>

255
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">also if there are any subscription</font>

256
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,130
services that aren't available that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

257
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,139
would love to see a subscription<font color="#CCCCCC"> service</font>

258
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:55,670
that I

259
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,710
that is now like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setting i think is</font>

260
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the word that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they used to describe it</font>

261
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is oyster books which is the netflix for</font>

262
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,470
books kind of setup where you get to

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,020
something similar over there yeah we've
