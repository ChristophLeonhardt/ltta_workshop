so how is the press going to react to Donald Trump's new strategy in Afghanistan now he claims he's not gonna tell us how many troops he's sending him that's nonsense we already know it's we know the exact number three thousand nine hundred as CNN reported we've told our 39 allies there's going to be 12,000 troops overall and so we know all those details now the media has been pretty tough on Trump to be fair they really have but whatever it comes to war oh they sing a different tune now first I'm gonna show you Brian Williams this is when not during Afghanistan but when Trump decided to launch missiles against the Syrian government here's what Brian Williams had to say we see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two US Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons and they are beautiful pictures of of fearsome armaments making what is for them a brief flight over to this airfield what did they hit Oh so even his guests had to remind him you know that when they land they kill people so take it easy with all the taco the beautiful weapons and at the time oh my god the press turned on a dime and they all went and said yeah this is the moment he became president more war yes so how will they react this time well we it's not as universal as it was during the attack against the Syrian government but there are definitely those in the press who were celebrating this I mean after all this time we're still talking about a pivot and how he's gonna become president maybe Phillip Rucker from the Washington Post tweeted tonight is a new president Trump acknowledging a flip-flop and talking about the gravity of office history and substance whenever they go to kill people and spend more defense contractor money all of a sudden that is the gravity of the office way to go Donald J Trump 16 years of wars not enough give us another 16 years and although the Washington Post which has been Donald Trump turns around goes Bravo Bravo now he doesn't speak for all the Washington Post to be fair but he is a writer there now we're gonna go to Fox News and Edie Henry Edie Henry keep in mind is not one of their opinion hosts he's supposed to be a straight news guy and to be fair to him this is what a lot of mainstream journalists do whenever there's war but here he is beside himself with joy about the new war that the Trump is expand it's not the new war it's a very very old war that he is now expanding watch this is a president giving his first major foreign policy address he's talking about war and peace and he's talking about finally winning this war by the way here's the bottom line one word leadership he stepped up to the plate tonight he had a rough week last week and he said I am going to show leadership he admitted that basically this is a flip-flop that's not easy for any president to do especially this president he likes to show that he's tough right he said again and again before he was running and when he was running going back to at least 2011 get out and he said if I'm elected I'm out enough with the money enough of the lost lives enough with the misadventure but he said look I got behind that desk in the Oval Office and I was elected to make tough decisions this is a tough decision but he kept using the other word not just leadership win we're going to win big picture here it was a leadership moment for him she stepped up to the plate big time god these guys on TV drive me crazy believe it or not I used all my willpower to try to not call them stupid because look come on let's break it down this is leadership it's leadership but wait a minute it's leadership no matter what he does if he decide to withdraw that would have been a tough choice and all the mainstream media would have been like oh my god what are you doing all these people are gonna now be without our leadership in Afghanistan without our guidance and counsel and our defense contractor making billions of dollars how could you do this right but that would have been a tough choice and it would have been leadership no matter what he decided its leadership so saying that is a nonsensical talking point and then he says now remember the important thing here guys is now we're going to be oh are you kidding I mean is that a joke we've been over there for 16 years at the end of this troop edition we're gonna have 12,000 troops there before we had a hundred and fifty thousand troops there Obama had a hundred thousand troops there as well so all those troops didn't lead to winning now the twelve thousand is going to lead to winning and Ed Henry what the hell are you talking about what does winning in Afghanistan mean you've had 16 years to figure it out and no one on TV can still tell us or no one in government can tell us what winning means in Afghanistan so for him to come out there and be like oh my god I am a straight news reporter on Fox and I'm here to tell you this president cares about winning oh for Christ's sake how silly how preposterous you didn't define it you didn't say anything meaningful just like way to go Donald now we're going to be winning that just makes you I can't help but I tried but that makes you a stupidest Trump well we're not gonna be losing any more we was a mess before but now we're gonna be winning okay so then Edie I'll keep you to account on this as well for every and once in a while we'll check back in and see if he's winning in Afghanistan with his great leadership I've got a rock-solid prediction you could put it in stone head we're not going to be winning a goddamn thing in Afghanistan we took we tried for 16 years and even then none of our leaders define what winning was and we can try for another 16 years and we won't quote unquote win they don't even know why they're fighting us and why we're fighting them as I quoted earlier in the show 92 percent of the people in Kandahar and Helmand - two provinces where we fight do most of the fighting I have no idea what 9/11 is they just say you're in my valley I fight you and because you're in my valley people every once in one comment in Urdu our Valley and we fight them so the longer we stay in their valleys the longer they fight us there is no winning that war all these guys on TV with all their pomp and circumstance just filled with nothing but vapid talking points and and God they love them some war nothing they like more than endless war it's sickening if you like this video you probably like
