00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,619
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and we stayed at hostel we had</font>

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,840
a good time and something I did which

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,660
was just in my random nature I kept

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,149
going true story and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said</font>

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,219
something random which was true and it

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,809
was in hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would shock him or</font>

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,660
entertain him but it mainly just boredom

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,579
and made them want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give me a cup of</font>

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,530
shut the fuck up so when I got back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

practicing for a gig I don't know why it

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:48,989
was going through my head at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

21
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,750
thought why not do a video on true

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,879
stories so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's going to</font>

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,710
work now true stories are always more

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,570
interesting the fake ones because it's

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,070
the fact that oh my god it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,559
really did happen they can be funny they

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,349
can be serious they can be shocking or

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,420
