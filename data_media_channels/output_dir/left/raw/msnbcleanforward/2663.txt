1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,194
IT WAS TO KEEP PERPETRATORS FROM BEING DETAINED ALONG WITH KIDS.

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,595
BEING DETAINED ALONG WITH KIDS. NOW WE SEE THE UNINTENDED

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:05,995
NOW WE SEE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,765
CONSEQUENCE. BUT WE DO NEED TO DEAL WITH IT.

5
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,101
BUT WE DO NEED TO DEAL WITH IT. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT IN A

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,436
I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY AND GET SOMETHING

7
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:12,903
BIPARTISAN WAY AND GET SOMETHING DONE THIS WEEK.

8
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:13,771
DONE THIS WEEK. >> YOU TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

9
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,005
>> YOU TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A LEGISLATIVE FIX WHICH I

00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,506
FOR A LEGISLATIVE FIX WHICH I WANT TO GET INTO WITH YOU A

11
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,474
WANT TO GET INTO WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE.

12
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,309
LITTLE BIT MORE. AS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FACTS,

13
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:19,976
AS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FACTS, LET’S DO THAT.

14
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,312
LET’S DO THAT. THE PRESIDENT COULD STOP THE

15
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,914
THE PRESIDENT COULD STOP THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WHICH

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,182
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

17
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,216
WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED.

18
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,484
FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED. THAT’S A PACT.

19
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:27,717
THAT’S A PACT. SO.

20
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,218
SO. >> YOU’RE RIGHT.

21
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,553
>> YOU’RE RIGHT. >> SHOULD THE PRESIDENT STOP

22
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,587
>> SHOULD THE PRESIDENT STOP MISLEADING PEOPLE BY ACTING LIKE

23
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,988
MISLEADING PEOPLE BY ACTING LIKE THIS IS ALL ON CONGRESS?

24
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,125
THIS IS ALL ON CONGRESS? >> WELL, IT IS CONCONGRESS,

25
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:35,459
>> WELL, IT IS CONCONGRESS, HALLIE.

26
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,493
HALLIE. HERE’S THE INTERESTING THING.

27
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,794
HERE’S THE INTERESTING THING. COT PRESIDENT SAY OPEN UP THE

28
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,296
COT PRESIDENT SAY OPEN UP THE BORDERS AND EVERYBODY THAT COMES

29
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,232
BORDERS AND EVERYBODY THAT COMES HERE SEEKING ASYLUM CAN COME IN

30
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:42,666
HERE SEEKING ASYLUM CAN COME IN REGARDLESS?

31
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,400
REGARDLESS? YES, WE DO THAT.

32
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,202
YES, WE DO THAT. I DON’T THINK THAT’S IN OUR

33
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:45,836
I DON’T THINK THAT’S IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS.

34
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,371
NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. I DON’T THINK THAT’S WHAT MOST

35
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,440
I DON’T THINK THAT’S WHAT MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

36
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,807
AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

37
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,441
BE DOING. BECAUSE WE’RE TALKING ABOUT

38
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,542
BECAUSE WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ASIEP LUM AND WE’RE TALKING

39
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,945
ASIEP LUM AND WE’RE TALKING ABOUT POLITICAL ASYLUM AND MANY

40
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,713
ABOUT POLITICAL ASYLUM AND MANY OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE TRAVELED

41
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:00,117
OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES TO GET HERE.

42
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,852
THOUSANDS OF MILES TO GET HERE. AND DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT AS

43
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,587
AND DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT AS A PRO FAMILY MEMBER OF CONGRESS?

44
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,055
A PRO FAMILY MEMBER OF CONGRESS? I SAY ABSOLUTELY.

45
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,724
I SAY ABSOLUTELY. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME JUST

46
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,462
AND YET AT THE SAME TIME JUST CHANGING THIS POLICY FROM AN

47
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,464
CHANGING THIS POLICY FROM AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH STANDPOINT

48
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,232
EXECUTIVE BRANCH STANDPOINT WON’T SIX THE PROBLEM IN

49
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:15,665
WON’T SIX THE PROBLEM IN PERPETUITY.

50
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,767
PERPETUITY. >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU’RE MAKE THE

00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,636
SECURITY ISSUE, WHICH I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ARGUING

54

WORLD, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE HUMANE THING TO DO?

59
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,047
IS THE HUMANE THING TO DO? IS THIS POLICY HUMANE?

60
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,682
IS THIS POLICY HUMANE? >> I DON’T BELIEVE SEPARATING

61
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,884
>> I DON’T BELIEVE SEPARATING KIDS FROM PARENTS IS A HUMANE

62
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,219
KIDS FROM PARENTS IS A HUMANE THING THAT’S WHY I TOOK ACTION,

63
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,487
THING THAT’S WHY I TOOK ACTION, THAT’S WHY I WORKED OR THE

THAT’S WHY I WORKED OR THE WEEKEND TO INTRODUCE A BILL WHEN

WEEKEND TO INTRODUCE A BILL WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.

IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. I’M HEARING FROM PEOPLE BACK

WERE BROUGHT OVER THE BORDER WITH ADULTS.

00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:12,389
WITH ADULTS. THAT LEAVES 2,000 KIDS SEPARATED

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,991
THAT LEAVES 2,000 KIDS SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS, THAT’S A LOT

THAT, THERE IS ONE COMPONENT FROM A CIVIL COMPONENT, BUT

119
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,070
FROM A CIVIL COMPONENT, BUT YOU’RE NOW GETTING IN AND MIXING

120
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,371
YOU’RE NOW GETTING IN AND MIXING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AS

121
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,774
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AS PEOPLE COMING ACROSS.

122
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:05,010
PEOPLE COMING ACROSS. ONE’S ASYLUM THE OTHER IS

123
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:05,777
ONE’S ASYLUM THE OTHER IS ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS.

124
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,945
ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS. SO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT

125
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:07,979
SO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT JURISDICTION THERE’S, HALLIE.

126
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,381
JURISDICTION THERE’S, HALLIE. BUT WHAT I’M SAYING IS WE CAN

127
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:11,149
BUT WHAT I’M SAYING IS WE CAN FIX IT LEGISLATIVELY, WE JUST

128
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,650
FIX IT LEGISLATIVELY, WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL

129
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:13,485
HAVE TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO THAT.

130
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:15,687
TO DO THAT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE CHUCK

131
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:16,888
I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE CHUCK SCHUMER COME OUT YESTERDAY

SCHUMER COME OUT YESTERDAY BEFORE HE READ ANY BILL THAT

BEFORE HE READ ANY BILL THAT SAYS HE’S NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH

134
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:20,191
SAYS HE’S NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS.

135
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,126
THIS. I MEAN, THAT’S WRONG TOO.

136

ADDRESS THIS. I THINK THEY’RE OPEN TO THAT.

143
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:37,976
I THINK THEY’RE OPEN TO THAT. IT’S JUST INCUMBENT ON CONGRESS

144
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:38,310
IT’S JUST INCUMBENT ON CONGRESS TO ACT.

THERE ARE SOME OF OUR MEMBERS WILLING TO SUPPORT THAT, SOME OF

165
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,605
WILLING TO SUPPORT THAT, SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT.

166
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,140
OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT. I’M LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS.

167
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,741
I’M LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS. IT’S BROADER THAN JUST THE

168
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:12,043
IT’S BROADER THAN JUST THE FREEDOM CAUCUS BECAUSE AS WE

169
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,545
FREEDOM CAUCUS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THE COMPROMISE BILL I’VE

170
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,113
LOOK AT THE COMPROMISE BILL I’VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN MANY OF THOSE

171
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:16,849
ACTUALLY BEEN IN MANY OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS TRYING TO FIND THAT

172
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,750
NEGOTIATIONS TRYING TO FIND THAT ISSUE THAT WILL DEAL WITH FAMILY

173
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,053
ISSUE THAT WILL DEAL WITH FAMILY SEPARATION WHICH IS IN THE

174
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:22,755
SEPARATION WHICH IS IN THE COMPROMISED BILL.

175
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,023
COMPROMISED BILL. BUT ALSO DEALING WITH A NUMBER

176
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:24,757
BUT ALSO DEALING WITH A NUMBER OF THE OTHER ISSUES.

177
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,258
OF THE OTHER ISSUES. THE PROBLEM IS IT GETS VERY

178
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:28,560
THE PROBLEM IS IT GETS VERY COMPLEX AND THAT’S WHY A MORE

179
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,996
COMPLEX AND THAT’S WHY A MORE NARROWLY TAILORED BILL HAS THE

180
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,064
NARROWLY TAILORED BILL HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PASSING.

181
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:33,465
BEST CHANCE OF PASSING. I HAD THREE DIFFERENT DEMOCRATS

182
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,567
I HAD THREE DIFFERENT DEMOCRATS COME UP TO ME YESTERDAY AND SAY

183
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:37,336
COME UP TO ME YESTERDAY AND SAY THAT THEY’RE WILLING TO LOOK AT

184
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,171
THAT THEY’RE WILLING TO LOOK AT MY LEGISLATION TO PERHAPS

185
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:41,106
MY LEGISLATION TO PERHAPS COSPONSOR AND GET THIS

198
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,825
GETTING THIS DEALT WITH. IF IT’S A NARROW BILL COMING OUT
