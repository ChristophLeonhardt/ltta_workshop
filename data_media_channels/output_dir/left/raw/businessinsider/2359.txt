how is allowing user-generated content

important or influential when it comes

to branding or entertainment well the

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,449
interesting thing about this is that

this user generated content from fans in

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,410
question the property owners have to ask

<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves is what am I going to do</font>

internet digital piracy basically

drowning in a sea of content where users

one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they can do under our</font>

studios or networks can incorporate

user-generated content I mean there's

53
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,610
got to be a slew of ways what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the examples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there well what</font>

you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now right for example a</font>

56
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,460
orgies alternate reality games are very

57
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,469
popular as a marketing device in a

58
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,709
pre-launch campaign up to a particular

product could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font>

you could be a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> game they've been</font>

64
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,870
essentially cost centers and they are

<font color="#CCCCCC">one-time playable entities they cannot</font>

66
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,920
be repeated or they really won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

67
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,510
repeated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the player because they saw</font>

68
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,770
the puzzle and the mysteries already

69
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,930
done or the products been released so

70
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,490
one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think can</font>

71
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,200
happen is that user-generated content

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,090
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a way to create a</font>

73
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,540
persistent ongoing monetizable growing

74
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,490
property where both the property owner

75
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,410
and the community large contribute to it

76
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,230
so being in the community and being a

77
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,630
co-creator of content or<font color="#E5E5E5"> participating</font>

78
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,550
what is the value proposition for me is

79
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,250
it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun well I would say that the</font>

80
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,110
value proposition<font color="#CCCCCC"> is different depending</font>

81
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,700
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are because lots of people</font>

82
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,260
are creating content for free and

83
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,000
throwing it up on the internet with with

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,010
no expectation of monetization some

85
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,450
people are doing it hoping that they'll

86
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,130
be monetization down the road whether it

87
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,930
be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the form of my script got bought</font>

88
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,610
or my company got bought or I got

89
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,380
funding some people are my advertisement

90
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,530
correct now advertising obviously is a

91
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,690
huge component and is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

92
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing people think about when they're</font>

93
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,630
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about online content the more</font>

94
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,100
content I have the more I buzz I'll get

95
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,360
the more advertising dollars I'll have

96
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,550
this obviously allows a new revenue

97
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,050
stream for property owners beyond what

98
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,580
they're currently doing so who is a

99
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,440
forward thinker in this space in terms

100
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of allowing your audience to co-create</font>

101
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,990
certain aspects or riff off of what's

102
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,910
already out there are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any studios</font>

103
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,360
or in the networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually</font>

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying this i would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at the</font>

105
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,810
industry level there still seems to be a

106
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,240
strong reticence based I think purely on

107
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,520
legal frameworks that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current model</font>

108
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,800
with the litigious in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this environment</font>

109
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,690
that we have the current model<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

110
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,490
wants the entertainment property owners

111
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,230
to say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to have to give</font>

112
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,820
credit or money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyone and I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

113
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,410
retain full ownership because if I don't

114
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,150
I'm opening up the door to a huge slew

115
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,790
of lawsuits however what I'm seeing is

116
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain companies are beginning to</font>

117
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,720
explore with this and say we're going to

118
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,550
release our content and we're going to

119
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,680
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> and invite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to play with</font>

120
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,690
the content to repurpose it remix it

121
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,120
remash it make it their own and then

122
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,740
contribute that back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

123
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,839
most of them still<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped short of</font>

124
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,910
monetary compensation most of them

125
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,380
stopped short of some type of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font>

126
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,019
or

127
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,810
type approach but a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are</font>

128
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,370
beginning to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this however at the</font>

129
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,870
industry level there still seems to be a

130
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,940
large reticence to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

131
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,949
mostly from a legal perspective it's not

132
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">a creative issue per se</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its major</font>

133
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,419
roadblock is legal legality of it that's

134
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,800
what I keep hearing when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

135
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,870
large media companies it is the lawyers

136
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,460
will never go for this this will never

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">get past legal there are creative</font>

138
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,840
concerns but the biggest robot that I

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,940
see right now to true collaboration is

140
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> legal aspect so say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a writer i</font>

141
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,380
right TV show if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> studio opens up</font>

142
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,139
that platform to people contributing and

143
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,610
whatnot doesn't that put my job at

144
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,190
jeopardy it certainly can that's a good

145
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,659
incentive for you to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best writer</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically talk</font>

is not to disparage what's on youtube

158
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,330
the most popular videos are not

necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that most</font>

160

entertainment companies would want to
