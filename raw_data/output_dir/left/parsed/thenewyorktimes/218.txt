History is made as Kim Jong-un
crosses the border.
It’s the first time
a North Korean leader
has set foot in the South.
This step is the latest chapter
in Kim’s head-spinning makeover
from a stern-faced despot
into a smiling diplomat.
Somebody President Trump
ridiculed as “Little Rocket Man” —
“Rocket Man is on
a suicide mission
for himself” —
has suddenly
become “very honorable.”
“He really has been very
open, very honorable.”
Here is how Kim did it.
Kim may have felt that
he had the leverage
to turn a diplomatic corner
once he was able to show
that his country could
be a nuclear power.
Kim kicks off his charm offensive
by dispatching his
so-called army of beauties
to the Winter
Olympics in Pyeongchang.
He also sends his sister
Kim Yo-jong — the first time
a member of the Kim family
visited South Korea
since the Korean War.
She becomes an overnight
sensation in the South.
Kim hosts a delegation of
high-level South Korean officials
in Pyongyang.
The officials from the
South deliver a bombshell
to the White House:
Kim wants to meet Trump,
and Trump, shocking the world,
says yes.
“Trump responded saying yes.”
“Surprise, praise, skepticism.”
“This was indeed a shocker.”
Kim secretly leaves the
country for the first time
since taking power.
His destination: Beijing,
where he visits
with Chinese President
Xi Jinping.
It’s Kim’s first meeting with
another head of state.
Kim hosts the International
Olympic Committee
in Pyongyang to thank
them for their support
and to say that North Korea
will take part in the Tokyo
and Beijing Olympics.
Kim loosens North Korea’s
iron grip on pop culture as he
and his wife rock out at
a two-hour K-pop concert
in Pyongyang.
He even poses for a photo with
a popular South Korean girl band,
Red Velvet.
Kim secretly meets
and has a photo op with
then-C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo,
signaling planning
is underway for a summit.
North Korea announces
a new pledge
to end nuclear and
missile testing
and close a nuclear test site.
Kim takes his historic stroll
and calls for an age of peace.
It may mark the beginning
of a historic thaw.
Whatever happens, it’s clearly
the start of a new Kim Jong-un.
