“If you look at what’s
happening with trade in China,
it hasn’t been fair
for many, many years.”
When President Trump
rails against China,
he says things like, “Our country
is being taken advantage of,”
or, “We lost years ago
by presidents and others
allowing this to happen.”
He’s probably referring
to the past four decades,
when China has grown faster than
any major economy in history
and gone from a poor,
developing country
to an economic powerhouse
that is challenging America’s
spot at the top of the
international food chain.
“Its emergence as a global power
was so sharp and so extreme,
faster than the world
can handle,
in some ways faster than 
China can handle.”
The U.S. and other
Western nations
kick-started much of China’s
rise by opening up trade.
What they haven’t
figured out
is how to get this fundamentally
different economic system
to play by free market rules.
A pivotal moment came in 2001
after 15 years of negotiations.
China joined the World
Trade Organization,
which sets the rules for 
free and fair trade
between member countries.
“All of the countries that
were in the club at the time
put enormous demands on China
for what they needed to do.”
The Chinese committed to
sharply lower tariffs
and reduced some of the government’s 
role in how business gets done.
But they argued then, 
as they still do now,
that China is
a developing country
and so should be held to less
stringent free trade standards.
The hope was that these
first steps
would lead to even more 
sweeping changes.
“Why did we assume that?
The experience of communism was 
through the lens of the Soviet Union
and its satellite states, which
was ultimately not a success.
And so the presumption was,
China’s going to want
to become like us,
more market oriented.”
“After China joined
the W.T.O. in 2001,
you saw this enormous
surge of Chinese exports
to everywhere in the world,
and to the United States in particular.”
“They were kind of an elephant
hiding behind mice with respect
to other countries in global
trade negotiations at the time.”
The U.S. and other countries
complained that China was not
opening its markets enough,
and keeping the value of its 
currency artificially low
to make Chinese exports 
more attractive.
“China has been
making great strides
using tools that are
really not acceptable
under the global trade system.”
China has continued to operate
as a centrally planned economy.
The government owns,
influences or subsidizes
major industries, giving them
an artificial competitive edge.
There are heavy restrictions
on foreign investment,
and foreign companies
are pressured
to share their technologies.
“China has become
more market oriented,
but dating back to
probably 2007, 2008,
I think it was recognized
that China wasn’t on the path
to become more like us.
And so then countries
began to think about, well,
what do we do instead?”
“Some view the rise
of Asia-Pacific
with suspicion and fear.
America doesn’t.”
Enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
initiated by Bush, 
signed by Obama.
“When implemented, It 
won’t just boost trade
and support jobs in
our 12 countries.
It will help set
stronger rules for trade
across the Asia-Pacific.”
Put less politely, It was also
supposed to be a bulwark
to China’s growing
economic power.
“The idea was that China would
want to join this great trading pact,
and so they would
have this incentive
to reform their economy.”
“This is the one that
President Trump ripped up
on his third day in office.”
“The first one is 
withdrawal of the United States
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”
“I had seen the erosion of popular
and congressional support
for trade for many years.
But I’d never seen anything
like Donald Trump.”
“Our founding fathers
understood trade
much better than our current
politicians, believe me.”
Trade is generally accepted
by economists as win-win
for countries on the whole.
But Trump says that
China is winning
and the U.S. is losing.
“He and people in
his administration
argue that past approaches to 
dealing with China haven’t worked.
It’s not actually that profitable 
to negotiate with them.
We need to focus on this
much bigger trade measure,
and then we can really hit
them with a very aggressive,
forceful action.”
“He seems intent on generating
a moment of crisis.”
“We put a $50 billion tariff on,
then we put a $100 billion tariff on.
And you know at a certain
point, they run out of bullets.”
But dynamics have changed.
Today, China sees its
economy is strong enough
to withstand almost anything
the U.S. can throw at it.
