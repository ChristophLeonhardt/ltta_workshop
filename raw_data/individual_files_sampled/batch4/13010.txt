caught up in the first season don't worry everything you need to know is explained in the story and now season two of another Kingdom so now I was a hunted man hunted haunted broken-hearted I looked in the motel mirror was that really me I was thirty years old and I looked like death like death on a Monday morning after a weekend binge a week ago four days ago even I was Austin Lively boy failure Hollywood schmuck a wannabe moviemaker who never made a movie a writer who sold one script straight out of film school then faded away to become the shadow of an L a nobody I was a reader for a crappy production company named mythos I was also a hypochondriasis tall hope of ever having the big career of his dreams funny I never thought I would miss being a dreamless hypochondriasis nobody but those were the days all right now my life was gone my job was gone my friends were gone the cops were trying to pin a murder on me and all-powerful billionaire Serge Orosco wanted me dead my family my mom my dad my brother were all in a Rosco's pay only my kid sister Riley was above suspicion and guess what she was nuts plus she'd gone missing even her insane conspiracy videos had vanished off the internet and all that trouble I was in that was just in this world the real world what other world was there glad you asked Galliano the 11 lands a magical mystical brain tumor of an elucidation I seemed to walk into without warning from time to time could happen any time I went through a door and if things were crap here believe me it was nothing compared to the way they were in that lunatic fantasy the woman who loved me their lady Beth array the woman I was supposed to defend and protect was dead murdered her husband Lord iron the tyrant of the country and curtain his pet wizard wanted to capture and torture me I was supposed to be on a quest to find the emperor anastasius who would restore the wise Queeny Linda to her throne I know it sounded ridiculous to me too but ridiculous or not it was a job for a knight in shining armor a fighting man of brave heart and right belief not some SoCal dickhead in a cheap motel that's where I now a motel so cheap they let me pay in cash a rundown hole on a small highway just south of Salinas I was waiting for dark fall there so I could finish my run to the Bay Area it was too dangerous to try it in the daylight the cops might be on the lookout for me and Aras goes bald-headed thug the guy I called billiard ball was almost certainly on my trail as well but somehow I had to get there had to find my sister had to find the manuscript she might or might not have a novel called another Kingdom which seemed to have some power to connect this crazy world - that crazy other one I turned away from the mirror I looked around the room room six in the shangri-la motel a cinder block rectangle the cinder blocks were painted urine yellow the carpet was sewage II brown there was a double bed with a floral bed spread that was mingled green and red sort of like vomit there was a particle board dresser with a lamp on it under the mirror there was a TV and a cheap table and a couple of cheap chairs there was a locked door that I guess connected to the next room over beside the table there was a small window it looked out onto the parking lot and onto the rest of the one-story u-shaped barracks like motel through the misty veil of the privacy curtains I could watch the light dying over the drab highway as soon as dark came I'd be on the road again I moved to the bed I lay down on the vomit colored bedspread my hands clasped behind my head I looked up at the ceiling my heart felt like ashes that was the odd thing about Galliano it was an acid trip of a fantasy world filled with ogres and centaurs and fairies and the like it couldn't be real but when you came back you brought your wounds with you and the wounds were real and so was your grief my hand went to the chain I wore around my neck down to the golden locket that hung on the end of it it had belonged to Beth Array I pulled the chain up over my head and held the locket up in front of me I pressed the clasp and the locket opened there was a portrait inside a miniature painting of queen'll inda I gazed on her serene and regal and exquisitely feminine face engraved on the lock its other half was a coat of arms a sword across an open hand and the Queen's motto let wisdom reign and each man go his way I reread the words I could hear my mother's arch response what's wisdom I wonder I had no idea as I lay there gazing at the picture I thought I felt a strange heat coming off the medal of the locket a strange power it seemed to grow heavier in my hand heavy as a stone quickly on instinct I snapped the locket shut and held it tight and something happened something weird for a moment I lost myself in a kind of wrap to other nests the motel room disappeared from around me I was in a different place a place I knew the house were I'd grown up in Berkeley the living room I could see it I could hear a child crying not just crying screaming hysterical terrified it was so real so startling i loosed my hold on the locket and let it drop to my chest at once the other nests the image the memory whatever it was vanished I was back in the motel back on the bed when I tentatively picked up the locket again it wasn't heavy anymore no power came off it the experience was over it had lasted only a second it was easy to convince myself that I had imagined it just nerves that's all so I lay there holding the locket thinking of Beth Rey missing her blaming myself for not being man enough to protect her I watched as the shadows in the small room shifted as the evening came on outside then finally it was dark time to go with the locket still in my hand I rolled off the bed there was nothing to pack I had nothing with me I ditched my phone so no one could trace me I'd stopped at an ATM near La to stock up on cash I couldn't use credit cards they could trace those two i dismantled the GPS in my car no internet no social media I was invisible and I was utterly alone I crossed the shit Brown carpet to the door I opened the door onto night outside there was billiard ball he stood gigantically on the threshold framed in the doorway with the parking lot lights glaring behind him before I could react he jabbed me in the neck with a stun gun the electric blast sent me reeling back into the room convulsing down to the floor I dropped to the carpet jerking and shuddering my muscles were locked up in mobile all I could do was lie there and judder and watch his billiard ball stepped calmly into the room and calmly shut the door behind him his enormous shoulders were packed into a leather jacket his muscles bulged through the thin sweater he wore underneath he looked down at my quivering body without a smile without a sneer without any emotion at all he hardly seemed interested in what he saw he reached into his jacket and slid the little stun gun into his left inside pocket then he reached across into his right inside pocket and drew out a small leather case terror exploded inside me as I watched him unzip the case and deftly remove a syringe I made a horrible helpless gurgling noise in my throat as I battled to get control of my body it was no use my muscles had been severed from my will billiard ball was going to poison me kill me and I couldn't do a thing to stop him they would find me in this crappy motel room dead of what seemed like natural causes my mother and father would pretend it was a tragedy my brother would tell himself it couldn't be helped the police would lie no one would ever know that Orosco had had me murdered to preserve his crazy plan to establish the Orosco age a utopia on earth I had to move I had to run I had to but I couldn't my muscles were strung out tight billiard ball knelt at my feet he laid the syringe on the carpet he calmly untied my right sneaker he calmly removed my sock like a mother undressing a toddler he was going to inject me between the toes where no one would find the needle mark I gurgled I struggled I made a high-pitched scream of useless effort I could not move anything and then I could a little my hand the fingers of my right hand by focusing all my effort all my will into my fingers I could stretch them out even as they went on trembling I could bend my right wrist just a little that horrid helpless noise kept spitting out between my teeth as I battled to shift my forearm meanwhile billiard ball finished taking off my sock he set it down on the floor by his left knee next to a sneaker he'd already removed it was all very neat very efficient he wanted to be able to find the sock and sneaker quickly so he could put them back on my corpse after I was dead I moved my hand across the carpet a little half an inch I touched something something cold the locket better Ray's locket I had dropped it when I fell I fought to close my fingers around it it was like bending bars of iron my whole body shook violently with the effort my spine thrumming like a bowstring but slowly slowly slowly my fingers closed having set my sock down beside my sneaker billiard ball now turned to pick up the syringe lying on the carpet by his right knee I closed my hand I gripped the locket in my fist like an explosion I felt that odd power radiates off the metal again the power pulsed into my flesh flashes of vision interrupted the reality of the moment the house where I grew up the living room a child screaming somewhere I fought to stay focused on the real world the motel by swiftly approaching murder the power of the locket flowed into my hand my wrist my arm giving me more strength I lifted the locket from the floor it felt heavy as it had before heavy as a rock billiard balls sniffed absent-mindedly as he's lifted the syringe in his right hand and held it upward needle pointing at the ceiling working in a deadpan businesslike manner he used his left hand to pry my big toe away from the toe beside it to make a space where he could inject me he brought the syringes needle down toward my foot I flicked my arm and threw the locket at him it was a good throw or maybe his head leaning down over his homicidal work just gave me a big target or maybe there was some Galliano and magic in the locket itself I don't know but the locket the locket with its extra heavy load of Bizzaro energy smacked hard into the thugs temple the blow knocked billiard balls head to one side he dropped the syringe it fell onto the carpet to the left of me with a great shout and a mighty effort I threw my arm across my body my shoulder lifting with the motion I found the syringe and grabbed hold of the barrel all this took less than a second but long enough for billiard ball to recover from his surprise a flicker of annoyance crossed his face as he saw me go for the syringe he reached out and clamped his hand around my wrist in a grip of Steel he held me fast there was no way I could get the syringe anywhere near him so I shifted my hand and his grip bent the wrist aimed the needle at him and pressed the plunger down with my thumb whatever poison was in the tube squirted out in a thin steady stream I pointed the stream at his face then bent my wrist further and slashed the stream across his nose until it hit him smack in the eye billiard ball let out a monstrous roar of pain he let me go and clutched at his eye with both hands his huge body fell sideways against the bed my muscles were still stiff and half frozen grunting loudly I managed to turn myself over onto my side then my belly I dropped the empty syringe and pressed both palms into the carpet I pushed myself up it felt as if there were a huge block of cement on my back I crawled a few inches just trying to put some distance between me and the killer in that tiny room I reached the particle board dresser I could hear billiard ball cursing and pain behind me but I didn't look back I grabbed the dresser the drawer handles I dragged myself up to my knees letting out another shout of desperate effort I grabbed hold of the dresser top and hold myself to my feet my legs felt like spaghetti under me I had to will the strength back into them I saw my image rise into the mirror as I rose a face like a corpse three days buried I heard a noise behind me I saw a billiard ball in the mirror - he was rising - clawing his way up the vomit colored bedspread as he got his feet on the floor beneath him his eyes streaming his teeth gritted in fury he hoisted his torso onto the bed the room was so small we were barely a foot apart no way I could get past him to the door I needed a weapon now the lamp on the dresser it was all there was I grabbed hold of it it was heavy the wire ran over the side of the dresser and was plugged into the wall behind I looked over my shoulder at billiard ball he looked at me his one good eye was a flame with rage his jacket had fallen open to expose the holster under his arm oh god he had a gun of course he did I lifted the lamp no more than a few inches the cord held it in place after that I yanked the lamp as hard as I could it didn't come free I yanked it again billiard ball reached into his jacket for his gun there was a pounding knock at the door it startled us both into a moment of inaction we both looked at the door an old woman's voice came through it it was the woman at the front desk the bent nearly humpbacked old woman who had checked me into the motel what's going on in there stop it whatever it is I called the police they're on the way she pounded on the door again bang bang bang my face twisted and strain I yanked the lamp with all my might the cord broke snapped away from the plug spitting orange Sparks billiard ball worked himself up into a sitting position on the edge of the bed he drew his gun out of the holster bang bang bang at the door the police are coming screamed the motel lady billiard ball aimed the gun at me and pulled the trigger I swung the base of the lamp at him as hard as I could it smacked him in the side of the head full force the gun went off the noise in that small room was like the end of the world only louder I thought I felt the bullet whistled by my ear the mirror shattered behind me billiard ball wobbled where he sat stunned by the blow from the lamp when the deafening gun blast subsided everything seemed muffled and far away weirdly quiet and dreamlike was the old lady still pounding on the door I didn't know I couldn't hear was billiard ball making some sort of noise through his contorted features maybe I wasn't sure but I could see see through a hazy days that thug was coming to his senses bringing the bore of the pistol around to point at me again if there was any advantage to my time in Galliano it was this I had learned how to focus and how to fight on this side of my existence here in what I laughingly called the real world I had always been a nerd a wimp the sort of guy who knew how to smile and snicker and shuffle on by without getting noticed by anyone who would do him harm but in Galliano in Galliano I was a knight in armor I had battled for my life I had dueled with expert swordsman and watched them die on the point of my blade I had learned that I could clear my mind I had learned that I could focus even through panic I had learned that I could kill what little skill I'd acquired what little skill and what little courage I had brought back with me here to California so now as billiard ball turns the gun on me again I didn't flinch I just went at him gripping the neck of the desk lamp I swung the bass at him again at his gun this time as I brought the lamp around the lampshade snapped off and fell leaving the bulb bare the heavy base hit billiard balls hand his gun went flying it dropped to the floor it spun a few inches over the carpet and came to rest by the door I rushed for it or tried to as I went to get past him billiard ball lunged off the bed and tackled me I fell on my back he fell on top of me he wrapped his hands around my throat and closed them tight I couldn't breathe I tried to swing the base of the lamp up at his head but I couldn't get any leverage I couldn't put any force into it and now billiard ball shifted his massive body and drove his knee into my bicep pinning it to the rug and all the while he went on strangling me I gagged my mouth came open my tongue stuck out I could feel my eyes bulging blue spots floated in the air around me the spots turned black billiard balls enormous bald head leaned down toward me his twisted face filled my field of vision I was still deaf from the gunshot everything around me seemed far away and dreamy I was sinking toward unconsciousness toward death I shifted the lamp in my hand I bent my elbow I stab to the lamp upward hard driving the bear light bulb into billiard balls face the bulb exploded on impact I closed my eyes as glassy dust spilled down over me but I felt billiard balls hands fly off my throat I felt his weight fly off my body I sucked air into my lungs as I squirmed away from him as I turned over and tried to rise the glass pouring off my face in a sprinkling sheet on my side I opened my eyes and looked I saw a billiard ball sitting with his back against the dresser he was clutching his face he was rocking his body blood was pouring out between his fingers I still held the lamp in my hand the broken bulb now just a jagged shard of glass sticking out of the socket at the end my ears were beginning to clear I could hear something a siren more than one police car is approaching from who knows how far away I had to get out of there I knew the police could kill me just as quickly as billiard ball could and they would if they were in a Rosco's pay I rose to my knees grunting billiard ball dropped his hands his face was a mass of blood with one blood-streaked eye and his gritted teeth showing white through the Scarlet he let out a wild roar of rage and threw himself at me his hands reaching for my throat again reflexively i jabbed to the lamp at him like a bayonet the force of my movement in the force of his combined and he was impaled the broken glass of the bulb sank into the side of his neck and part of the metal socket followed it he was pinned in midair as he fell back the lamp dropped out of him and the blood spurted after it dousing my face and shoulder billiard ball dropped to the floor in indescribably awful paroxysms I stared in open mouthed horror as he thrashed and died in a shower of gore a moment later he lay still there was blood everywhere I was covered with it so was the rug there were red streaks on the bedspread in the walls I could still hear sirens they were louder now and growing even louder fast gasping I pulled myself up onto the bed then rolled off it onto my feet I stumbled to the table to the window I looked out through the white haze of the privacy curtains I could see the flashing red lights of police cars racing into the parking lot my silver Camaro my sister's boyfriend's car was parked right outside right beside the door but there was no way to get to it with first one cop car then two bounding over the sidewalk ramp on shooting across the lot toward me a moment later the first car braked tires screeching two officers left out their guns drawn a third uniformed stepped out of the second car even as it swerved to a stop I had to get out of here I looked around me there was only one possible exit a locked door that led into the next room over biting down the urge to puke my guts out I forced myself to head across the room squinting through the blood on my face weaving like a drunken man billiard ball lay sprawled across my path splayed in the narrow aisle between the bed and the dresser his head was propped against the dresser so that his still open eyes white in his red drenched face seemed to stare at nothing his gun lay on the rug near his motionless right hand better raised locket lay right beside it I stepped over him trying not to look but I had to bend down to retrieve the gun and the locket as I did those dead eyes of his stared right into mine it sent a chill through my entire body I straightened the gun in my fist the locket chain dangling from my fingers I slipped the chain over my head as I walked unsteadily to the back of the room behind me still somewhat muffled in my blown out ears I could hear a fist pounding on the room door I could hear a voice shouting police open up I reached the other door the locked door it had no knob just a dead bolt protruding from the wood I lifted the gun and slammed the butt of it down onto the mechanism once then again it was all cheap stuff the deadbolt came loose on the first blow on the second blow it fell from its hole and dropped the floor the police went on shouting open up or we're coming in they pounded on the room door again to make their point I pushed on the inner door it rattled in its frame using what little was left of my strength I lifted my leg and kicked it just beneath where the deadbolt had been the door gave way flew open I gasped aloud there was Galliano right in front of me the hazy ghost of another country a fantasy of night and distance shimmering on the far side of the threshold this was a new magic it had only happened once before earlier that day in the police station in Los Angeles there for the first time I had seen the veil of transition from this world to the other before I stepped through it It was as if my mind was adjusting to the bizarre fact of my impossible double life as if it were beginning to get some control over the seemingly random passages back and forth or maybe my brain tumor was just advancing to the point where the hallucination seemed more real than they had before who knew not me in any case when I kicked the door in I saw a Galliano the dark and storey landscape outside the walls of the town of East Room from where I stood in the motel I could even hear the faint noises of battle as the freedom fighters of the forest King Torretta neo fought against Lord irons oppressive armies I hesitated one more second panicked half mad I was standing there bathed in blood with a dead man on the floor behind me and the police about to come bursting through the door there guns blazing and yet even so even so I felt a weary sadness wash over me as I contemplated going back into that other world that world where I had failed in my duty so entirely where I had left my lover dead and where my heart had been broken but the pounding of fists on the motel room door grew louder and more insistent the shouts of the police grew angrier more intense this is your last chance open this door awake in shooting I took one last glance around the blood-soaked room then I stepped through the veil into another Kingdom of all the strange things about Galliano the strangest might have been this I could not hold on to my sense of its reality when I was back in LA I could not believe in it at all not truly no matter how many scars I returned with no matter how much grief or what memories I felt my adventures there must have all been a dream or an hallucination but then then the minute the very instant I stepped across some threshold somewhere and returned to the castles and enchanted forests and wasted planes then suddenly it was all as solid and alive as any place I had ever been then there could be no question about its substance it was as there as there could be that's how it was now a moment ago under siege in my cheap motel outside Salinas this kingdom seemed no more than a symptom of some brain dysfunction a split second later after I walked through that door here I cut early was astride my black stallion in an open field galloping into the autumn night the mists of the ancient East Room graveyard where the great battle had been waged where the emanations of the Dead had fought over the souls of the Fallen where Lady Beth array had died in my arms while her spirit rose and vanished into the upper atmosphere that mist was gone the air was thin and chilly and clear as a bright new windowpane the stars were strewn across the sable sky like diamond dust at my back centaurs bathed in the rainbow light from swirling hordes of fairies battled against human warriors while Pete capped trolls fought to keep the city gates open in order to allow tora tanios army of forest creatures to retreat and escape no really that's what was happening right behind me but I couldn't stop to watch all I could do was take advantage of the melee and confusion and spur my stallion in a hot gallop over the fields toward the deeper darkness of the four in the far distance I rode and rode hard soon the woods surrounded me the still black trees stood like still black sentinels watching me pass their tangled branches hung above me silhouetted against the Stars their dried and dying leaves chattered in the wind I rode and rode and finally slowed and stopped for the first time I became aware that I was exhausted a battle here the death of bethe array the fight with billiard ball back in California they had sapped all my strength my body felt like a dead weight even my mind seemed heavy as lead I slid off my horse like human gelatin I plunked down on my ass on the forest floor open mouthed staring still holding the reins in my hand I was panting wheezing I couldn't catch my breath I was dazed with shock and weariness waves of emotion passed over me flashes of memory Beth erased sagging lifeless in my arms my escape from LA and the speeding silver Camaro billiard ball thrashing on the motel floor spewing blood as the police sirens came closer grew louder all of this had happened within the space of a few hours I felt used up hollowed out as if there were nothing left inside me I dropped onto my back with a heavy sigh dead leaves kicking up around me as I fell I lay there and stared stupidly up through the darkness up at where the Stars winked out from behind the branches I began to weep I know wimpy but I couldn't help it it was Beth array it was my failure to protect her it was the dead man in the motel and the cops coming after me they'd still be there pounding on the motel door whenever I got back if I did get back it was the despair it was the loneliness it was everything I mean after all what was I just some guy just some gormless Schmo who'd been trying to make it in the movie business without much success another Hollywood wannabe circling the career drain in a few more years I'm sure I would have given up the whole enterprise I would have gone back to school like my parents wanted I would have gotten some teaching job at some college somewhere married some girl had some kids from time to time I would have reminisced about my wild and crazy years in showbiz the toxic sting of failure would have faded to a dull throb I'd have gotten over it sure I would have not everyone's dreams come true but instead it was this I was here in the dark woods with the branches creaking with the leaves chattering and God knows what animals making god-knows-what noises often the tangled blackness of the night I could almost hear the voice of my friend the mutant squirrel woman Maud I could almost hear her weird buzzing screech telling me be a man Austin be a man but I couldn't do it I couldn't be a man I lay there on my back on the dead leaves and cried like a baby wow-wow-wow some hero I don't know when exactly my eyes sank shut but the next thing I knew the Sun was slanting low across the earth in misty beams all around me the cheery birds were tweet tweet tweet in the trees the red and green and yellow leaves were dancing in the air above me i sat up I remember the night before the sobbing I shook my head and self-disgust and cursed myself for a weakling then I climbed to my feet I was ready to begin my quest I washed my face in a nearby rim I knelt on the bank and drank the clear quick water from my cupped hands I stood and pissed in the leaves beneath a maple tree then I mounted my stallion again I rode here was the deal the quest I was wearing a talisman around my neck a golden pendant on a golden chain it had an s-shaped bolt carved into its center it was a gift to the good Queen and Linda from her fiance the emperor anastasius Anastasius was currently fighting a war on the far side of the 11 lands wherever the hell that was my mission my quest was to bring this talisman to him as a signal that a Linda was in danger then he and his armies would drive out of the East to defeat Lord iron and restore the Queen to her throne let wisdom rain and each man go his way that was our password we of the Queen's party our password and our battle cry that was the sort of world we were supposed to be defending now it probably goes without saying I had no idea how I was going to accomplish what I was supposed to accomplish my friend Maud had instructed me to keep the North Star on my left shoulder and follow the Rising Sun eventually she said the emperor anastasius would call to me somehow so that was the plan such as it was I saw the fiery disc of the Sun burning white through the farthest trees and I headed toward it after a long while I broke out of the forest and I just kept riding toward that yellowing fire Galliano was a country with a blasted gothic beauty seer Fields abandoned towers impoverished shacks and dark forbidding woods there were people here and there along the way but no one I would have stopped and spoken to they were all of them hungry and feral looking their eyes baleful their lips white their bodies tense and jittery as if they were getting ready to pounce and devour you I'm told when the good queen rained it was all different here all lush and serene and joyful but now even in the bright fall morning it looked to me like an old black-and-white horror movie everything slanted and gloomy vaguely haunted vaguely strange still it was autumn harvest time there were fields here and there with gleanings left on them ears of corn my horse and I could peck at some peppers and the like I even found an apple tree with a few ripe apples left that kept us going for a while I rode until dark then slept in a rickety shed then mounted and rode again then slept then rode toward dusk the third day I felt a change in the atmosphere around me it began with a thin stream of fresher cooler air that smelled like springtime it curled alluringly beneath my nostrils like the aroma of baking bread weary as I was i sat up straighter on my horse the air grew even cooler fresher my heart stirred and rose I came to the top of a ridge and looked down on the view spreading out below me I knew right away I had come into a different country the grass was green here wild flowers yellow purple and white were scattered everywhere great white clouds sailed like mighty ships across the deepening blue of the twilight horizon chalky hills rose in the distance and at their feet in the midst of freshly harvested fields there was a village it was a jolly looking little place not fancy or anything just a cluster of little buildings with the hills looming over them but the houses were all clean and attractive their thatched roof tops were decked with brightly colored pennants their walls were whitewashed and decorated with newly painted beams all in all it was a welcoming homey neighborly sight hungry lonely weary I spurred my stallion and started down the slope toward the village as I approached I could make out men and women going about their business hauling sheets into red barns driving oxen and their ploughs through fields of gold and stubble the Sun sinking toward the horizon behind me blanketed the entire scene with a warm orange glow but as I came near the village the people stopped whatever they were doing and stood watching me people in the fields and among the buildings too they all stopped where they were and stood and stared at me with expressionless faces there was no sound of voices there was no breeze everything was suddenly motionless and quiet it felt odd more than odd well I shrugged it off they weren't used to seeing strangers here that's all I told myself why else would they be gawking at me like that there was nothing particularly weird about me I had cleaned the blood off my face and hands there were still bruises on my neck from where billiard ball choked me I had seen them in my reflection in some pooled water a while back but how strange were bruises they couldn't be gaping at those could they and it couldn't be the magic sword at my side or the liquid armor that would sometimes cover me they were invisible they only appeared when I went into battle no I was dressed in plain brown clothes like a stable hand and if I was a bit grimy from travel what about it none of that explained why they were just standing there just staring at me like that yet they were all of them I reached the village and came among the buildings no one moved every single person I could see had stopped dead in his tracks and was gazing my way I tried nodding to a few of them I even smiled but there was no reaction no one smiled back they just kept staring it really was downright eerie in fact close up like this I saw the people themselves were kind of bizarre looking I wasn't sure what it was about them at first then I realised they all looked sort of the same somehow I mean they were all different enough at first glance there were short ones and tall ones fat and skinny blonde brunette redhead but they were all dressed in the same rough Brown cotton shirts and more than that their faces their features their eyes noses mouths they were all so similar small and vague like they were pinched in putty doll like like the features of something fashioned rather than someone born I spotted a Tavern at the centre of the town The Invisible Woman that was the name on the sign dangling from a post above the door out on the dirt street in front there was a hitching rail with a drinking trough like the ones I'd seen in movie westerns I dismounted and threw the Stallions reins over the rail like I'd seen the movie Cowboys do my horse whittled and lapped at the water aside from that the village was absolutely silent the villagers all the villagers every single one just went on standing there standing and staring at me without making a sound I stared back turning my eyes from one to another of them and I thought suddenly no children that was strange too wasn't it shouldn't there be children here but there were none I let out a long breath I turned away from those staring samey faces I walked to the tavern door I pushed inside like the town the tavern seemed a nice enough place to look at at first at first it seemed warm and welcoming big windows let in lots of the last sunlight a chandelier with burning candles cast a dancing glow so did the burning torches in sconces on the wall a great big blaze in the great big fireplace spread its heat across the whole room wall-to-wall it all seemed very bright and cheery there were two men standing at the long bar each had a nail in one fist each had one foot up on the wooden rail they were looking over their shoulders at me there was a young man and a woman seated at a rough wooden table to my left there was an older man and an older woman at a table to my right they were all silent they were all turned my way they were all staring their doll-like features were all the same I was starting to feel well and truly creeped out by now but I was starving too I needed something to eat I walked up to the bar a woman was standing there her back to me she was round as a ball dressed in the same brown shift as everyone else round headed round bodied no shape to her but round just as I stepped to the bar she turned and faced me my breath caught she had the same face as all the others the round version of the same small featured face not a woman's face either not a woman's and not a man's sexless and the eyes were pinched and suspicious weak and afraid like she had a secret and she was worried I'd find it out they all looked like that the barkeep was holding a beaker of beer in her fist she set it down on the bar top with a whopping bang my eyes went to the frothing head and I felt my mouth begin to water it's on me came a voice at my back I turned and saw another woman just coming in she was very tall very broad shouldered with long brown hair that fell to the curve of the large breasts shaping her Brown shift she wore a bright white ribbon slantwise across her chest I guessed it was the mark of an official position other than that she looked well she looked like everyone else like the bartender and the drinkers and also like the people who were now slipping in through the door behind her I'm the mayor of this city the woman said she stepped toward me expressionless but with her hand outstretched mayor Adriana I shook her hand her grip was powerful not like a woman's grip at all come to think of it it was sort of surprising to see a woman serving as mayor in these medieval surroundings not that I was a scholar of history or anything it just seemed like a medieval female mayor was the sort of thing you'd see in a fantasy movie or a novel not in real life but then was this real life who the hell knew right all the same if I was creeped out before I was more creeped out now a sense of actual horror was growing in me but why I wasn't sure meanwhile more and more villagers were pushing in through the door behind the mayor one after another they spread out across the tavern slowly filling the large room as each one found a spot for himself he would stop there stop and stare at me silently a growing crowd standing there staring silent it really was getting on my nerves I said well thanks for the beer that's nice of you thanks and uncomfortable under her strange gaze under all their strange silent gazes I looked away and my eyes were caught by something on the wall behind her an empty space a large rectangle paler than the wood around it and with a nails sticking out near the top it seemed a picture had hung there and had only recently been taken down sure enough when I lowered my eyes I saw it in the corner a large framed painting leaning against the wall facing the wall so I couldn't get a glimpse of it what was it a painting of I wondered who had removed it and why was it just leaning there like that the mayor gave a high trilling ladylike laugh that somehow didn't suit her it seemed put on fake it's just my way of saying welcome she said welcome to you Austin Lively I straightened as if an electric bolt had gone through me it was always a little strange to hear my name spoken in this otherworldly world as if I were a character in a movie I had never seen but to have it spoken here after three days ride from any place I knew in an obscure little village in an obscure little Valley in a country I had never heard of or been to well that was downright spooky supremely spooky shocking really I mean what the hell was going on and all the while the bar was filling up with villagers and the villagers with their sexless doll-like faces just looked at me just stared saying nothing you know me I said to the mayor how do you know me your fame has spread she said with a friendly wink of one small eye then she gestured at the bar behind me help yourself I was about to ask my question but at her gesture I glanced over my shoulder and as I did I was struck full force with a smell that made my stomach growl like a beast the round woman behind the bar was just now setting a meat pie down beside the beaker of beer the aroma was rich and delicious and I was ravenous after my long ride licking my lips I nodded my thanks at the mayor that's very kind of you really would you mind if I I swallowed hard I haven't had a meal in days please said the mayor in a peculiarly bland tone dig in I probably should have heeded my sense of unease or horror or whatever it was but I was just too damned hungry to care I stepped back to the bar there was a spoon by the pie plate I grabbed it by the spiraling metal handle and dug into the pie when the spoons tip broke through the crust steam came up to my face Oh Lord steam filled with that rich warm meaty smell I lost all reticence and began scooping the thick confection into my eager mouths I ignored the villagers ignored the staring eyes that I knew were boring into my back I forgot all about them I ate and ate only when I was halfway through the pie only as the ache of my hunger began to subside did I try to carry on the conversation what is this place anyway I said to the mayor through a succulent mouthful I grabbed the beaker and washed the food down with ale am I still in Galliano the mayor had not moved from where she stood I had to turn sideways so I could see her and stuff my face at the same time no she told me you left Galliano miles back you have entered the 11 lands this is the village of new fell in the country of edgemon seems like a nice place I went on scarfing PI swigging beer it has a whole different climate a whole different feel it's almost like it's a different season here yes spring it's always spring really that's a neat trick is it the mountains that do that do they create some kind of microclimate or something the mountains the mountains I know when I glanced at her again I thought she was examining me tilting her head and studying me measuring me as if she were judging my looks or my physical condition or something the rest of the villagers were as they had been just standing just staring it is the work of our nation's governor said the mayor we are under his protection he guards us against the consequences the consequences I said of the revolution in Galliano you mean when the mayor didn't answer I glanced up from the ruin of my meat pie and saw her smiling smiling as if to herself with a distant dreamy look of satisfaction in her eyes whatever she'd been searching for in the look of mine she'd obviously found it what consequences I asked again what Oh all of them she said revolution winter tragedy none of them happens here I laughed nervously through my growing unease Wow good deal who is this governor of yours God she laughed right back at me God she said hardly God God is all consequences and she shifted her pinched doll eyes away from me she looked down at some else the painting maybe the painting leaning against the wall hard to be sure hard to see anything but the villagers their faces they were everywhere now the room was packed with them plus night had fallen into windows and while the chandelier and torches and firelight filled the tavern with a deep orange glow it was darker than it had been there were deep wavering shadows in every corner I blinked hard to clear my head the pie the Ale I had been so hungry and now I was so full a thick sated feeling muddied my mind and yet I wanted more to eat more how I said thickly scooping out another spoon full of meat he never answered my question how did you know my name slowly the mayor lifted her gaze back to me it came to us she said it came to us upon the fabric of the air whispered by the spirits of the inferno that stretches across all universes and all dimensions it became part and parcel of the identity with which our master blinds and blesses and rules us all and will one day rule the very framework of eternity I had lifted my spoon halfway from the pie plate to my mouth and there my hand froze what I said the mayor's tone of voice had changed all at once it was Hollow and empty and weirdly musical the voice of a ghost calling up the cellar stairs her eyes were suddenly bright I mean scarily bright lantern bright even worse even stranger everyone's eyes were suddenly bright all the villagers were now staring at me with white bright eyes their little mouths curling up into sharp nearly v-shaped grins well why did you say I asked again but I could barely get the words out the spoon fell from my slack fingers it dropped onto the pie plate with a soft nauseating splash I was dizzy I was swaying I gripped the edge of the bar to hold myself steady there was a noise there was motion I looked around me it was even harder to see now than it had been before was it the nightfall was the fire dying the room seemed sunk in shadow the shadow seemed distorted by a wavery mist as if the whole place were suddenly under water through that oscillating atmosphere I saw that the villagers had begun to move bright-eyed grinning they were stirring from their places as if they had just awakened from some sort of standing coma some were reaching up to take the long wigs off their heads some were reaching inside their blouses to remove and withdraw bra like contraptions containing fake breasts the mayor herself was sliding her long hair down the side of her face it gave the strangest impression through the gathering fog it looked as if her head were melting I widened my eyes trying to clear my vision I stared at her squinting through the gathering gloom except she wasn't to her the mayor she wasn't a woman at all she was a man in dress up I turned and looked around the room it was the same with all the women they were all men and dress up once they removed their wigs and fake breasts once all the villagers revealed themselves to be male they all looked even more alike than they had before they all had the same blandly brown colored hair now and their features what I could make out of their features as they went in and out of focus their features which before had seemed androgynous had become clearly the features of men dead heart had feminized men It was as if I were standing in a room full of eunuchs zombies a whole village full of eunuchs Sambas by now of course I realized I'd been poisoned the fog in the tavern was really fog inside my mind and it was growing thicker by the moment all those faces those identical grinning bright-eyed malevolent faces were blurring and slurring together my mouth was hanging open and I somehow couldn't gather the strength to close it I lost my grip on the bar and when I tried to grab it again I knocked the pie plate off I heard its wobbly clatter on the floor as if from far away I sensed more movement in the room I turned toward it turned painfully as if my neck had rusted on my shoulders I saw two men one of them still with a woman's figure they were lifting the painting that had been leaning in the corner lifting it up above the heads of the others lifting it until they could hang it on the nail at the top of the pale rectangle on the wall back where it had been hanging until just before I came in a short man wearing a robe of deepest indigo that flowed around him like liquid night his face was shriveled and wrinkled and yet somehow ageless he had a tuft of gray hair on his head and another on his chin his eyes were small but they burned and boiled with a lava red intensity of malignant power I knew him Curtin the evil wizard who had helped depose the Queen of galliano he was the one who had manipulated the minds of the people made them believe they were building a utopia even as they transformed their country into a hellhole the Queen's justice gave to each what he deserved but Curtin had promised to give all to everyone it was he who had turned that once free and lovely nation into an oppressive wasteland Lord iron ruled there but Curtin was the real power and he was the guardian of New fell Village had turned out the governor of the land of Ejim and the leader who protected these people from the consequences all the consequences and he had turned them into what they were whatever that was I tried to speak his name aloud I couldn't my legs buckled under me I clutched desperately at the bar trying to stay on my feet had they killed me was i dying now helpless i tumbled to the floor next time on another kingdom my gays passed over piles and piles of corpses the people have been lowered down here and then then they had been slaughtered torn to pieces I could see that some of their corpses had been partially eaten I looked around me at the cave walls this was a place of sacrifice but sacrificed to whom to what what awful creature was down here with me the very second that question entered my mind the answer came the earth shook underneath me I heard a thunderous pounding from deep within the foggy corridor to my right one reverberating thud and then another and then another after that it was the sound of footsteps the footsteps of something monstrous and whatever it was it was slowly coming toward me this has been another kingdom by Andrew Klavan
