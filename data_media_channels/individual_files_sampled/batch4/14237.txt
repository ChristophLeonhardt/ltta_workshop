amidst the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis it turns out that Britain didn't take in a single Christian refugee in the first few months of 2018 new figures from the Barnabas fund charity which were obtained through a Freedom of Information request have shown that out of the 1,100 Syrian refugees that were brought into Britain in the first three months of this year not a single one of them not one was Christian the Daily Mail reported more than 1100 Syrian refugees were brought into Britain in the first three months of this year without a Christian among them despite the suffering of Christians during seven years of civil war including persecution by Islamic state all the arrivals were Muslims and a 4830 to Syrians invited to settle here last year only 11 were Christian this tells us all we need to know doesn't it this isn't about being good people this isn't about the government doing the right thing this is ideologically driven why else would it be true that over the span of three months when we were importing Syrian refugees at the beginning of this year not one of them were Christian what other explanation is there because statistically our on average that doesn't make any sense surely some of them if we were taking a random sample would have been Christian this is ideological the thinking behind this is well this is what the far-right don't want so let's do it and it further enriches our society why else would why would they want more Christians in this country when the tryna stop us from being a Christian country the Mail reported further and they said the Barnabas fund charity which obtained the figures on the Freedom of Information Law said it is widely accepted that Christians constituted up to ten percent of Syria's pre-war population have been specifically targeted by jihadists and continue to be at risk yet out of more than 1,000 Syrian refugees resettled in the UK this year there was not a single Christian as last year statistics more than amply demonstrate that this is not a statistical blip it is a significant evidence of discrimination and the government has a legal duty to take concrete steps to address this see even the charities admitted they say ten percent of the population so why are ten percent of the refugees not Christian and by the way most refugees aren't even refugees sorry I know we've gone through this before that let's talk about this again they're not refugees John snow had provoked presenter from Channel four News said to me have you even been to Syria have you even been it's a very civilized society and I had to remind him that even that you use stats Eurostat a show that most of these people aren't from Syria this is not beef we have with Syrian people this is beef with a system that's letting people in from all over the world in fact Yura stats own figures showed that four out of five migrants were not from Syria four out of five so when we talk about this first off we've got the problem off the government are importing people and they don't know whether from their from Eritrea and elsewhere secondly they're all mostly Muslim and thirdly if they're meant to be from Syria if they genuinely are from Syria how can the government explain the fact that ten percent of these people are not Christians this is ideologically driven it's a plan it's a scheme to do wrong by the British people when the government invites thousands of refugees into our country while the EU zone statistics show us that four out of five of these people are not only not from Syria but there are also not refugees at all we know there's a political goal in mind here and this is proven further when one considers the fact that the Barnabas fund charity admits themselves that the government is discriminating against Christian refugees coming from Syria who have been targets from Isis and extremist Islamic groups and now the government is importing almost exclusively Muslim refugees in the first three months of this year not a single Syrian refugee was Christian not one it's time to get sensible with this we must stop importing fighting age males from Eritrea and Beyond into Britain and stop buying into the proven fake narrative on Syrian refugees we need to start thinking about our own people if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
