1
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,350
It is inspired by the ancient quipu
idea of talking knots,

2
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,800
which was how the Incans
recorded history.

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,769
The visitor would come into the
room at first unsure of how to

4
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,160
interact with these ropes.

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,939
But as soon as they knew that
they could touch these ropes,

6
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,089
that they could feel them, that
they could throw them around,

7
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:48,559
everything changed. It was like their
bodies became part of the work.

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,690
There was a kind of childish delight
in moving through the space.

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,940
The first thing you encounter is the
smell. It was this earthy, loamy smell.

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,330
Lewis had filled the entire
foyer with couches and this

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,939
explosion of house plants that
were almost aggressive in nature.

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,839
At times it was unclear who was
part of the work and who was a visitor,

13
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:20,640
who was a dancer and who was just
there to see what was going on.

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm not sure the distinction mattered.

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,710
"Anywhen" resisted description.
Hashtag, you had to be there.

16
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,280
An amalgamation of video
footage, of ventriloquism,

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,620
cuttlefish and cityscapes,
a manic marquee sign,

18
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,140
a graceful beacon lamp that slid
the length of the space,

19
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,460
a motley assortment of inflatable
fish and a plethora of tiny speakers.

20
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,300
No two moments were the same,
and here was the kicker,

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,999
this whole universe was
controlled by a jar of yeast,

22
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:02,740
the sounds of the museum
and an algorithm.

23
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,140
Sounds complicated?
Good. It was.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,510
"London Fog" felt at once
minimal and complex.

25
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,710
There was a sort of profound
dialogue between the elements

26
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,840
and the artists, between museum
and the city around it.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Around me, the fog was
changing with the breeze.

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,910
It rose up and twisted,
obscuring the world beyond.

29
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,820
For a moment, I was trapped in a cocoon,
completely transported.

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,370
And then the mist broke,
and I was standing next to a

31
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,880
museum inside a great
and beautiful city.

32
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,630
There's so many different ways
to move through the museum.

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,409
You can use it as a thoroughfare,
as a picnic spot

34
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,029
as a place to declare your love,
as a place to fall asleep.

35
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:57,449
A museum needs to contain
all of these spaces.

36
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,740
In a way a city should be
designed like a museum.

37
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,650
Places for collision,
places for thinking,

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,490
places for commerce,
places for art-making.

39
00:03:11,490 --> 00:00:00,000
A city and a museum should
not be all that different.
