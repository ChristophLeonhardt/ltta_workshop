I am for me okay annual in the stream bail or pretrial release is an integral part of justice systems around the world it maintains an accused persons freedom in the run-up to trial but bail in the u.s. is rather different judges often set money bonds at levels way above what people can pay and many people have little choice but to go to private bond providers or face jail I'm Malika Bilal today we look at how the bail system in the u.s. keeps people who should be presumed innocent under lock and key and we'll examine a social movement pushing for social justice reform we're live on YouTube more than half a million people in the US are being held in pretrial detention that is they've been charged but not convicted of a crime and they're awaiting trial many are in jail not because they're a flight risk or pose a threat but because they just can't afford to pay the cost of bail have a look say you're arrested for allegedly committing a crime one of three things will happen you get released until your trial you're denied bail and sit behind bars until trial or you're offered bail an amount of money that you have to pay to get out of jail until trial it's like the courts insurance policy that you don't skip town once you show up to trial you get that money back paying bail allows you to go back to your kids your job while awaiting trial but what if you can't pay that bond it is an explicitly class and wealth based discriminatory process for determining who gets to be free while they await trial and who is forced to remain incarcerated while they maintain their innocent well online people are using hash tags in cash bail bail reform and end money bail to force an end to what's been called a discriminatory and even predatory system together the hash tags have had well over 100,000 mentions as celebrities politicians lawyers and activists use them to call for an end to the money bail system now I'm on Twitter is blunt in her assessment of why money bail needs to go she tweets hate the system hate the money making scheme hate the unchecked destructive powers of the cash bail while Jena spins treats the system penalizes people of color and the poor the bail system has come under scrutiny following high-profile stories of african-american men and women who died while in or following pretrial detention kalief Browder was 16 when he was arrested and sent to Rikers Island jail in New York he spent time in solitary confinement he committed suicide months after his release his bail which he and his family couldn't afford was $3,000 Sandra bland died while being held in a Texas jail her bond was set at $5,000 painted black tweets even a few days in jail can cost someone their job their housing their children or in the case of Sandra bland their life online campaigns have sprung up to raise money to pay bail bonds for those in pretrial detention in the run-up to Mother's Day last month people raise funds for black women under the hashtag free black mamas the aw party tweets don't forget that in money bail is also a woman's issue women are the fastest-growing correctional population in the country and nearly 80% of women in jail are mothers this year the free black mamas campaign bailed out more than 147 women now people are using free black fathers to do the same in time for Father's Day and this month believers bailout is raising funds through Ramadan to bail out Muslims who are in pretrial detention a campaign pitch to us by stream community member matha Al Hassan the group says it's an opportunity to learn about the in justices of money bail so today we'll talk more about u.s. bail reform and want you to weigh in tweet us at aj stream i mean thanks so much Malika so for more on this were joined by Cherise Freneau burden she is CEO of the pretrial Justice Institute Jeff Clayton is executive director at the American bail coalition which advocates for the bail bond industry from Chicago we have Sawad abdul kabir she is senior editor of sapelo square as a website dedicated to the black us Muslim experience and she's involved in believers bailout as a program which is raising funds throughout Ramadan to pay the bail bonds of individuals held in jail and from New Orleans we have FLA's Elle Daniels jr. he is CEO and president of foundation for Louisiana that's a community engagement organization hello everybody it's good to have you here thank you for joining the stream Jeff did you notice as in our introduction we didn't mention anything positive about money bail well that's really no surprise that we're under attack right now so obviously I'm not too worried about it because I know the truth which is that bail is a core associational and constitutional right the bail out of various communities is important because people can get together and challenge overreaches by the government and that's why the bail system is important one of the things we're seeing right now is that a system of preventive detention giving the government to lock people up without the ability to challenge it with bail whether it's from a commercial bondsman or somebody else will result in increases in the car serration we're starting to see that so this is what I brought up from your Twitter feed bail works Louis failure to appear rate lowest crime rate more accountability no taxpayer funding that that's quite a list of pluses Charice for for saying that cash bail is really important how do you respond to that so I usually talk about bail being broken in two fundamental ways one you've got highlighted at the top of the show which is that we have a lot of people in this country who cannot afford to post the money bond and get out of jail and actually in the u.s. the money bond that is paid to get out of jail to bail bondsman it isn't returned even if you do show up for court it's a premium that goes to the bondsman but the system is broken actually at the other end as well which is that people who should be detained and there's really a small percentage of those folks they're often able to use the same money bond system to get released pending trial without any court-ordered supervision so we're really trying to ensure victim safety community safety public safety and I would also suggest that there actually is a cost to the taxpayer for the current system we have as you said five hundred thousand people sleeping in jail tonight in a pretrial detention status and for the most part they have been released by courts they're just too poor to post that bond so we're sort of subsidizing the bail bonding industry by taking care of people in jail who if they were had not had a money bond set would be their families I hate you froze out guy uh-huh what's behind I think that was thank you that I was just agreeing with sharise's assertion and also thinking about a recent analysis we did here in New Orleans as we celebrated our 300th year we wanted to look at the historical ramifications and really found through accurate historical telling that everything Cherie said is true and is tied to our extraordinary history in this country of enslavement of people of African descent in racialized bias and behavior this is a real connection between these practices these policies who gets enriched by them and how we still practice them and they often have very little to do with accountability or safety I hear what you're saying they're close I want to bring up the perspective of someone on Twitter we actually heard from several employers and employees of the bail bondsmen industry this is Kyle and I'll direct this to you Jeff Kyle says blaming the bail bondsman is like blaming the mailman for delivering bills you don't like cash bail is used by 99% of judges because it works I think the 99% numbers probably a little inaccurate I mean if you look at the stats I mean in felony cases release on bail is only about 30 to 35 percent of the cases so it's not even the most common form or at least the United States of America do judges think at work in some cases yes they do our judges the gatekeeper on this system and our national policy that makers the gatekeeper in the system the answer is yes we're not we don't set bails all we do is post them and help people get out of jail so that part of it I think is a little inaccurate so I'm just trying to give our international audience a sense of the kind of impact that either having to meet a cash bail or failing to meet a cash bail actually has on communities who are either impoverished or communities of color can you give us an example yeah so I mean one of the things that I found and so you know getting involved believers bail out for me was really once I discovered that this was happening right as many people talk about it like this injustice in plain sight and so you have people for example there was a woman in Chicago who was in jail first 14 months right just because she couldn't afford to pay the bond there's another young man in Chicago who's been in jail since 2016 just because they can't afford can't afford to pay the bond the woman lost her business she almost lost her child you know we have people who losing jobs losing those family members you know people who have mental health issues or health issues that aren't being addressed and so this idea that only reason you're in jail is because you can't pay really it's about you being penalized right because you're poor and when I heard that and when I sort of discovered initially I heard about the Mamas they bail out you mentioned and that really got me thinking about you know what is going on what is going on in these jails and what can we do to change it and you know the Mamas they bill it really resonated with me as a black person right this idea that we're going to free ourselves and we're not going to wait we're to interrupt the system and the ways that we can the long term you know game it's the end money bail but until then we're going to free ourselves and so believers bail out came out of that same impetus right that you know it's also a tradition of Muslims freeing each other and it's Ramadan and it's a time where people you know want to give and want to help each other and so it just seemed like the perfect time and the perfect opportunity to really sort of get involved and really raise the consciousness because I think one of the big things about this bail system is that you really have to shift perspectives right people have to recognize that jail and prison actually doesn't work this question of being effective I mean for what I've read I know in DC like Washington DC they don't use money bail and 88 percent of us are somewhere around there of the people who actually you know get released come back but they're a rest free you know so this idea of bail being effective you know to me seems a bit of a fallacy and what's really effective I think is sort of helping communities with what their needs are you know helping communities putting the energy and money we might give to jail to community to Clemson's I think I would make on that would be that you can't blame the bail industry for the problems in Illinois because we don't operate in the state of Illinois so it's not our fault of what's going on in Chicago that's that's we have nothing to do with that but what I would say is that Washington DC is a potential alternative and really it's a cost for policymakers you're looking at 65 to 70 million dollars and fuss probably would be inflated if we were to apply it to other jurisdictions but there's a taxpayer cost to implement that system and you're also opening the door to detention without bail which we've seen abuse is not necessarily slowed you down a little bit from international audience and actually for some for American orders in Washington DC and New Jersey two states that do not have cash bail that's right let's say New Jersey the latest number is almost one out of two people are having the prosecutor file a motion to detain them without bail so that so exactly what they're doing in Chicago they can't bail those people out because they're locked up without she's biting her tongue but not for long not for long well I am Jeff and I are both actually committed to accountability and data with government and so I think we ought to just sort of tell the truth about what's happening as Sawad said most of the people in DC go home they go home pending trial they go home under some conditions of release DC is unique because they have in-house services that make that system more expensive but in other places where there are county run behavioral health services it's not as expensive and we have to say the reason DC and New Jersey did this was because they felt that they were injustice is happening to poor people people of color just couldn't offense repay that's right if the New Jersey bail system had been working before they would have left everything the way that it was but now we have 94 percent of people going home pending trial our goal really as an organization is get down to get down to below 10% pretrial incarceration and New Jersey and DC are two places that have done that New Jersey weed man and ask him how it went for him because he's a small-time drug dealer who spent 14 months in prison for a crime he didn't commit the Weed Man that you talk about but this is someone who spent time this is someone who spent time in New Jersey and the New Jersey correctional system six one seven just chatted to us on YouTube live says I believe my experience was fair bail in New Jersey is based on a number system based on prior convictions part skipped court appearances your charges and history with the court so that's one example in which some might say they're doing it right but I want to share with you another example and this flows I'll I'll give to you this is a video comment from a woman in Chicago named LaVette maze have a listen to what she told the stream in 2015 I was a mess for altercation which led to a judge to assess my bail at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars twenty five thousand dollars to law I could not afford it I spent five hundred and seventy one days in Cook County Jail this caused me to nearly lose my children I lost my home I lost my business it hurt my family I ended up taking a plea deal not because I could not I don't think I can beat the case but because my family had been through enough so falls out she took a plea deal even though she thought she could have beat the case is that something you see often I think it is something we see often and we hear people particularly lawyers civil rights lawyers here in New Orleans and across Louisiana who are looking at these issues with us part of the unspoken story and I'm really glad miss Mays brought this up is that prosecutors often want the person they're charging to be incarcerated so they can force the plea right 97 percent cases in Louisiana and with plea deals because the system wants to as efficiently as possible prosecute and incarcerate as many people as possible and so you know we get right back to this issue the other thing that Miss maze brought up is that we have a number of people in jail who are not there for the reasons that the normal person would think we think oh very violent people are the ones who should be in jail the truth is if we looked in New Orleans today nearly half the people in the local jail would not be there but for the case that they can't pay and so again bail doesn't work money bill is not working because it's tied to other people have resources not to whether they are dangerous or whether they'll return to court yes I just want to show our audience what the high price of us spell actually means I want to share some figures with you so the average mean income of somebody who's being asked for a bail payment is about fifteen thousand dollars that's average some people have a whole lot less the average bail bond that you're being asked to pay $10,000 hey that's your income that's the bail bond and then a typical bond provider fee so you then you say okay we can't pay this but we're gonna go to something who can help us pay it they will ask typically at least for $1,000 maybe more but about 10 or 15 percent of your overall bail price and then this is the realistic viewpoint of how much cash do Americans have and so 44% of people who are asking for a bail bond they can't even come up with four hundred dollars in an emergency so this is the problem Jeff do you see that I do see that these are official statute them up we're not massaging them that's almost impossible so if you're poor you're going to jail even before your trial I think your numbers are probably low there's probably people more people who can't afford it but the reality is that bill is a third party provided benefit at no cost to the state usually it's a third party it's not the defendants self bailing and so can I just ask you then see you're talking about the cost of the state but what about the cost to the community the cost to families and kids and to employers I understand what you're saying in terms of this doesn't cost the state much anything no what about the human cost I think the entire criminal justice system it has a disparate impact we've seen that I don't think bill is unique or non unique as a result of that I'm not sure exacerbates the problem any worse than it already is and I agree that the criminal justice system is dysfunctional right now and changes need to be made to it but I don't think this issue is the main driver of all the disparities and all these I mean what I would say I mean and I'm not the expert here I'm just a community member trying to help other people but from what I've read people who are on bonds actually are more likely to sort of like take a plea they're also more likely to get longer sentences like all these things happen because it's hard to defend yourself when you're in jail and so you know but it's a it's about this being set up in the first place right that people are not able to today believe we can say that it doesn't actually have an effect I think bail has a clear effect on people's outcomes and so this is why we need to end it right because there's no reason for this right in Chicago 70 percent the people right who are in Cook County Jail are nonviolent offenders right so this idea of safety is not the case here right and so there's a lot of efforts it's we partnered with the Chicago community bond fund to sort of provide resources and to challenge us legislatively because we know it's not working and that the cost is just way too high the cost of people were people again jobs families lives are being lost and so we really have to sort of intervene so this idea that bail itself is not really the problem I think is really wrong so here's their I wanted to bring this this in from Twitter this is a true seeker who says the people benefiting from the bail system don't want to see that go away it brings a whole lot of money it's unfair that because someone who has a rich family can get out of jail others that can't afford it have to stay the bail system should be abolished ASAP but sure you say I want to bring the other side of that conversation because we also got this on Twitter this is Rebecca who says this this focus on the inability to pay is false and misleading most bail agents offer affordable payment plans and are good and honest I own an agency and offer 0% down low monthly payment no interest throwing the entire bail industry out is the wrong path towards improvement that last part of her her statement throwing the entire bail industry out what are your thoughts on that how do how do you reform this yeah so I'll tie that statement to something a Sawad said as well which is I think that that bail Reform is one piece of overall criminal justice reform that has to happen and if you look at a place like New Jersey the success we've seen in New Jersey of reducing the number of people who are in jail pretrial is not just a function of doing something better once they got booked in they've actually reduced the number of arrests and bookings into the jail in all across New Jersey so you have about a hundred and forty thousand people last year who did not actually have to get checked in to the to the jail or booked into the jail and go through an assessment and and be potentially up for pretrial detention so this is part of an overall reform including assigning people counsel so that they go to these hearings represented by counsel and can maybe avoid some of the issues so odd mentioned about people getting worse outcomes as a result of being detained pending trial I think that the main point is this the country's worried about public safety and money bill has no impact on public safety and so what we're really talking about in communities is can we help the system identify those maybe eight or ten people out of a hundred that should go to a detention hearing and let the Court decide based on evidence whether or not they should be detained and everybody else should go home with court reminders or supports in the community and be able to participate in their own defense and potentially work through their cases that way so you know we're not trying to throw out bail bail is the contract between the court and the defendant we're actually suggesting that we should be evolving past money Bond I want to show you some of the campaigning audience watching this discussion right now to actually reform the bail system so there's believers bail outs so I've been telling us about this national bailout campaign also something that sharise has been talking about pretrial justice Institute so there's a lot of reform or pushing for a reform let me show you what that reform actually looks like so on the 11th of May color of change an organization and several of their partner organizations actually paid the bail for 59 mothers here's one of the months have a look Plus ow paying bail for people who can't afford to PayPal is that on the path to reform what we need to do something better something bigger well I think it absolutely is on the path to reform it what it does is it reminds the public that the storyline the narrative that we've heard for years now is actually not true we've heard repeatedly even on this conversation that you know this is about accountability this is about fairness actually our ability to end money bail and to make the kind of reforms that have been mentioned Macerata and Charisse really get us to what we should be um I come from a community that has had its fair share of safety challenges this system actually doesn't allow us to create the kind of safety that we want and I think seeing these examples of what liberating people looks like of what democratizing this system looks like is a reminder for the general public and especially for affected communities that we should be moving in the right direction in doing so means that we would end money fail and add one thing so when he said and I agree completely it's also we have to remind ourselves this is not normal right the United States incarcerate more people like 25 percent of the world's population half a million people the majority of them are in bail in jail because they can't afford to pay bail like that's not normal and it doesn't have to be this way most of all nations don't have money bonds right so like it does not have to be this way so I think that's also really important to keep track of that you know there are other ways to resolve issues social issues that we have that you know that we're worried about there other ways to deal with safety you know primarily with increasing support to communities improving our school for schools you know in more job opportunities better health care I mean this is what we need we don't need them that's right yeah the the the video is showing OPP right here in New Orleans part of what we learned in our analysis is that we spend as much or more money going after people for bill than we do do we get in return and so it's just a nonsensical system every level and Cherise I know you want to get in here I just want to read this tweet that would agree with you so I tatarin chief is there handle paying bail for people that can't afford it it's a great way to show solidarity with people incarcerated pretrial but it was only a bandaid of a much larger problem Cherise I know you wanted to ask yeah so I was just gonna contextualize that I mean I love Mama's bailout I love Father's Day bailout I love all of these and thank you so much for what you're doing in Cook County so on but on Mother's Day when we were able to find out 149 women we incarcerated 30,000 people that day so the scope of the problem is immense and these are great ways to call attention to systemic the need for systemic reform and early on I misspoke I was talking about New Jersey and DC as being state sued actually got rid of cash bail and I live in DC so I should know that DC is not a state it is a district but I'm sure you understood what I was going for okay Jeff and Cherise and so add of Roselle thank you for being part of this discussion it will be ongoing because cash bail isn't going anywhere quite yet thank you very much being part of this conversation and we will continue it always online using hashtag h h stream or at a doe stream on twitter see you soon
