In 2013, TIME magazine selected Pope Francis
as their person of the year and since then,
he has only become more popular and influential.
According to one study, he is now the most
influential person on twitter with nearly
17 million followers, and an average of over
17,000
retweets per tweet he sends out in multiple
languages.
The question is - why?
What has Pope
Francis done to attain all of this popularity,
and does a more influential pope really matter?
Well, he’s done a lot to bring the Catholic
Church out of the dark ages and as a result,
he’s
pushing humanity as a whole forward in innumerable
ways.
In science, he has accepted the theory of
evolution and the Big Bang.
In October 2014, he
said, God is not “a magician with a magic
wand,” and that “the Big Bang, which today
we hold
to be the origin of the world, does not contradict
the intervention of the divine creator but
rather,
requires it.”
His stance lessens some of the resistance
to science, that many religious groups
have had, making it easier for people to work
in or teach the sciences.
The Pope has also softened the church’s
stance on the LGBT community.
In 2013 he said,
“If they accept the Lord and have goodwill,
who am I to judge them?”
He also reaffirmed
that sentiment in 2014 by encouraging parents
to accept their children no matter their sexual
preference.
This is still a far cry from accepting gay
marriage or allowing open homosexuals
into the priesthood, but it does do a lot
to lessen the divide between Catholicism and
the LGBT
community.
Pope Francis has also made the topics of contraception
and abortion less of a priority for the
church, insinuating that they should focus
more on fighting poverty instead.
He also wants them
to focus more on protecting the environment,
reforming the global economy and eradicating
sex
crimes and corruption within the church.
This includes eliminating the influence of
the Italian
Mafia.
He also favors more casual daily mass held
in public places.
He lives in a guest home, not
the Apostolic Palace.
He cruises Rome in a normal car - not a bullet-proof
Mercedes limo.
And
when he was elected, instead of blessing the
people, Pope Francis asked the people to bless
him.
Just recently, he also struck a note with
animal lovers when he said “Paradise is
open to all
of God’s creatures.”
This more personal and open approach is part
of how he’s gained so much
popularity.
But fighting for good causes that affect all
of humanity and modernizing the church
itself to be less judgmental and exclusive
is why Pope Francis matters.
