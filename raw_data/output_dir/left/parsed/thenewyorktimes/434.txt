Hey everyone, my name is Lucas Peterson.
I am the Frugal Traveler
for The New York Times. I am in Jerez,
which is part of the Sherry Triangle
in southern Spain, the cities of
Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Jerez
and El Puerto de Santa María.
Within that triangle is where
sherry has to be made in order
for it to be called sherry.
And I am at the bodega or
wine cellar of Tio Pepe and
I'm going to get a tour.
Manuel María González started
this company in 1835.
He was very young,
only 23 years old.
And his uncle, Uncle Pepe,
was an expert about wine
and he helped to start this business.
And you're saying this is the special,
this is the Albariza soil?
This is Albariza soil, white on the
surface and you can see a little darker
because of the humidity.
And the grapes are required to
be grown in this kind of soil?
We have different kinds of soil.
But this is the same as this
is what you're saying.
This is, this one is coming from here.
The only difference is the age.
This is coming from here. This is the
starting point of this, 12 years old.
