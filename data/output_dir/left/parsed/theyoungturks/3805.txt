A POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE HAS STRUCK
A TOWN NEAR MEXICO CITY AND SO
FAR, AS OF THIS MOMENT, THE
DEATH TOLL HAS REACHED 100
PEOPLE.
IT WAS A MAGNITUDE 7.1
EARTHQUAKE AND WE DO HAVE SOME
FOOTAGE THAT WE WILL TOSS TO
RIGHT NOW AS B ROLL WHILE I GIVE
YOU MORE DETAILS ON WHAT'S GOING
ON.
THESE VIDEOS WERE ACTUALLY
SHARED TO US BY A VIEWER BY THE
NAME OF JORGE, SO I
WANT TO THANK HIM FOR SHARING
THIS WITH US.
THAT IS A SCENE FEATURING PEOPLE
ON THESE TOURIST BOATS AND YOU
CAN ALSO SEE SOME DAMAGE THERE,
THE HIGHWAYS ARE DESTROYED.
THERE ARE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED.
DURING THE QUAKE, MORE THAN
20 BUILDINGS AND OTHER
STRUCTURES FELL, INCLUDING AT
LEAST TWO SCHOOLS, OFFICIAL
SAID, CRUSHING CARS AND TRAPPING
SOME PEOPLE INSIDE.
IT ALSO CAME LESS THAN TWO
WEEKS AFTER THE MOST POWERFUL
EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO IN A
CENTURY, A MAGNITUDE 8.1
QUAKE THAT KILLED AT LEAST 90
PEOPLE, DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF
HOMES AND WAS FELT BY TENS
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN MEXICO
AND IN GUATEMALA.
THE INCREDIBLE THING IS THAT
THIS EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED ON
THE ANNIVERSARY OF A HUGE
EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURRED IN
MEXICO CITY IN 1985.
IT KILLED AS MANY AS 10,000
PEOPLE IN MEXICO, SO THERE WERE
INDIVIDUALS DOING EARTHQUAKE
DRILLS AS THIS QUAKE HIT WHICH
IS AMAZING AND IT'S ALSO
DEVASTATING.
ALL OF THESE NATURAL
DISASTERS ARE STRIKING AT ONCE
AND PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR
HOMES, THEY ARE LOSING
THEIR LIVES, AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT
OTHER THAN IT IS SO INCREDIBLY
DEPRESSING.
THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS
THAT GO INTO IT BECAUSE
WE'RE BOTH FROM THE VALLEY AND
WE LIVED TO THE NORTHRIDGE
EARTHQUAKE IN 1994 AND THAT WAS
A 6.8 EARTHQUAKE.
THE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE
RICHTER SCALE IS
EXPONENTIAL NOT LINEAR SO THE
BIGGER IT IS, OVER A
NUMBER, IT ACTUALLY GETS
EXPONENTIALLY LARGER SO A
7.1 QUAKE IS MUCH STRONGER THAN
A 6.8 QUAKE.
ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT THAT GOES
INTO CONSIDERATION IS THE
TIME OF DAY.
THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WAS A
431 IN THE MORNING AND PEOPLE
WERE IN THEIR HOMES AS OPPOSED
TO EARTHQUAKES LIKE THIS ONE AND
THEN THERE WAS ONE IN SAN
FRANCISCO IN THE 80S DURING A
WORLD SERIES GAMES ARE PEOPLE
ARE OUT AND ABOUT AND EACH
SITUATION BRINGS ITS OWN DANGER
IS NOT TO MENTION THE LOCATION
AND THE KIND OF, WHAT'S
UNDERNEATH THE CITY AND WHERE
CITY IS BUILT SO WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT MEXICO CITY AND
EARTHQUAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
MORE AFRAID, THERE HAD BEEN
REPORTS FROM THE PREVIOUS
EARTHQUAKE WERE FOLKS, EVEN
THOUGH THAT WAS OFF THE COAST TO
THE SOUTH, PEOPLE FELT IN MEXICO
CITY AND OUT OF FEAR, THEY DID
WITH THEY DO IN MEXICO CITY
WHICH IS MORE OFTEN, RUN INTO
THE STREET BECAUSE UNDERNEATH
MEXICO CITY, A LOT OF IT IS
BUILT ON THE LAKEBED AS A POSTER
HARD BEDROCK WHICH LENDS ITSELF
MORE TO STABLE CONSTRUCTION.
THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT GO
INTO IT.
YOU SEE THEM ALL PLAY OUT AT
ONCE AND IT INCREASES THE
DEVASTATION, NOT TO MENTION ALL
THE COLLATERAL ISSUES LIKE
GAS LEAKS AND MAYBE TRIGGERED,
BUYERS, BUILDINGS THAT
DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY WERE
CREATED AND BUILT ARE
ENGINEERED TO WITHSTAND
LIKE THIS OR NOT AND THEN
YOU'LL SEE DIFFERENT
POCKETS THAT JUST RANDOMLY
SUFFERED MORE DEVASTATION THAN
OTHERS BASED ON THE GEOLOGICAL
UNDERPINNINGS OF THAT SITE.
EXACTLY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEATH TOLL
IS EXPECTED TO RISE AS THE
STORY DEVELOPS.
THIS EARTHQUAKE DID STRIKE
TODAY IN THE AFTERNOON AND SO
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE PRELIMINARY
REPORTS.
WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION,
OR DETAILS AS THE STORY
DEVELOPS, BUT IT'S AMAZING.
LAST NIGHT THERE WAS AN
EARTHQUAKE IN LOS ANGELES.
IT WAS SMALL.
NO DAMAGE, NO DUST, NO NOTHING
BUT WERE SEEING THESE
NATURAL DISASTERS OVER THE PLACE
RIGHT NOW AND IT'S CONCERNING.
OBVIOUSLY THERE CAUSED BY
DIFFERENT THINGS.
ALSO PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT
SEEMS LIKE IT ALL IS
HAPPENING AT ONCE AND THE EFFECT
THAT THAT HAS ON EVERYBODY.
ALSO, THE AFTERSHOCKS SO THIS
IS NOT THE ONLY QUAKE THAT
WILL HAPPEN.
THIS CAME TWO WEEKS AFTER THE
MOST RECENT QUAKE AND THEN
WHEN THERE IS ANY KIND OF
EARTHQUAKE, THE IMMEDIATELY
THING YOU THINK OF IS THIS A
FORESHOCK OR THE MAIN EVENT?
IF IT'S A 7.1
EARTHQUAKE IMMEDIATELY ALL THE
SEISMOLOGISTS SAY THERE MIGHT BE
A LARGE ONE JUST AROUND THE
CORNER BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NOT,
I REMEMBER DURING THE NORTHRIDGE
QUAKE, 5.5 EARTHQUAKES WERE THE
NORM FOR THE NEXT WEEK.
I REMEMBERED THAT WE WERE
SITTING OUTSIDE IN THE
FRONT YARD.
WE HAD A FRIENDS RV DOWN THE
STREET MAKING HOT CHOCOLATE
FOR EVERYBODY.
HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE IN
MEXICO IS AFFECTED BY THIS AND
WE WILL KEEP YOU GUYS UPDATED ON
THE STORY AS IT DEVELOPS.
