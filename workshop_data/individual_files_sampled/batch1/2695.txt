some dogs and cats will chase their tails because it's a it's a type of play they are often attracted to motion they're predators I like to small moving things when they turn to look at their tail the tail moves and so it's a natural reflex and a reaction to chase it so when you think about the fact that they like to chase small balls or mice or something like that the tail is a small moving thing when they see it so they'll twirl around and chase it and it's usually not a problem because most of them will do it for a brief period of time often when they're young you do need to be careful because some animals will get into it's a compulsive disorder just about where they'll do this for an extended period of time and sometimes if they actually catch their tail they'll chew it and damage it if your cat or dog does that you should see a veterinarian or behaviorist about it
