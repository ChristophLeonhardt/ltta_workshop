THEY WENT NORTH TO SOUTH.

19
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:34,292
NOW THEY PUT AGENTS ON THE

20
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:36,127
BEACH AND WALK THEM FROM SOUTH

21
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,697

PERSPECTIVE WILL YIELD MORE

23
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:41,533

TRAPPED.

25
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,102

35
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,820
I'M TOLD THAT NUMBER WILL BE

36
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,622
DYNAMIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

37
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:04,556
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES

38
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:06,558

DEBRIS OUT HERE BUT TRACK

00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:11,596

00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:15,100

44
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:16,968

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,043
UNACCOUNTED FOR, THAT NUMBER

50
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:25,477
COULD CHANGE.

51
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:28,079
THAT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF

52
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,546
COMMUNICATIONS.

53
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,848
BAY COUNTY OFFICIALS WITH THE

00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:31,182
COMPLAINING.

56
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:33,852
THEY WANT THE PRESIDENT TO PUT

57
00:01:33,853 --> 00:01:35,720
PRESSURE ON THE COMMUNICATION

58
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,122

00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:40,225
CANNOT COMMUNICATE.

62
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,326
THEY CAN'T GET THE MESSAGE OUT

63
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,695
TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHERE TO GET

64
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:43,962

67
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,731
