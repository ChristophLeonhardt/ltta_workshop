a new survey indicates that white Christians are for the first time a minority in the United States well first time since whites came and basically did their colonial thing let's and wiped out everyone exactly now the survey that was done by public religion Institute actually talked to over a hundred thousand people in the US and the whole point was to find out whether or not there are differences in religious leanings and what the minorities and majorities are in regard to religious affiliation here's what they found white Christians once predominant in the country's religious life now comprise only 43% of the population just to give you an example of what that population used to be like four decades ago about eight and ten Americans were white Christians Wow that is half it used to be eighty eighty percent now is forty three percent that is a giant difference in four decades and that is by the way exactly why we're seeing the overreaction from the right wing that we are today they're in a panic oh my god our time is almost up we used to rule everything and soon everybody will be equal ah and so that is mainly in the white evangelical conservative Christians politically it's of course does not apply to all white Christians in the country but the demographics are a huge swing there's more information right so first let's explain why we're seeing this drop in the number of white Christians first of all keep in mind that the percentage of people living in the United States who identify as Christians is still high it's around seventy percent however when it comes to white Christians we're seeing these drops in membership and predominantly white mainland Protestant denominations such as Presbyterians and Lutheran's also there's an increasing Latino presence in the Roman Catholic Church as some non Hispanic white Catholics leave and also shrinking ranks of white evangelicals which is Jake has mentioned on the show before is really bad for Trump especially because he relies pretty heavily on that vote right yeah look the fact that there's more Latino religious people in the country and less white it doesn't that is to me is irrelevant god bless either way appropriate is right so the racial component of this is uninteresting except for how it affects politics and so and Latinos are not uniformly voting Democratic they're you know they're a little bit more split that for example African Americans but white evangelical voters are voting as a bloc eighty percent of them voted for Donald Trump and they had a voter turnout of eighty five percent which is unheard of now given that they are shrinking part of the population and will get more numbers for that up for you in a second - it is not sustainable you can not even if by the way even if 85 percent showed up and voted again and eighty percent of them voted for Donald Trump in in 2020 he still wouldn't win unless Hillary ran again but even in that scenario even if Hillary runs again like the worst of the worst candidate he'll probably still lose based on demographic shifts yes now let's also talk about the emergence of those who do not identify as religious it's an increasing share of Americans and according to this survey it's about one-quarter who don't identify with a faith group so these are of course agnostics and atheists now when you go back to the evangelical population in the u.s. you can see how significantly it's shrinking seventeen percent of Americans now identify as white evangelical compared to 23 percent a decade ago so actually that's not really a rapid decline but it's still a decline no no no it's ten years no but Ana this these numbers didn't move forever and so now they're moving faster and faster go from 17% of population or 23 to 17 is a giant I mean you've lost six out of 23 points that you had that is enormous is that look at these numbers I think man and nah-uh so look the racial component but I don't care about at all I don't care if they're white evangelicals are purple evangelicals I care about two things one is the political atmosphere because the way that conservative white evangelical voters have voted is disaster yeah in our opinion disastrous and basically it has been they've had a privilege in this country for a long long time and it is this is their last desperate gasp to protect special privileges I celebrate that we are all going to be equal we don't think like conservatives don't worry conservatives we're not going to take your rights away we're not going to make you less than we're not going to say hey because straights for example in this country had way more privileges than gay Americans and gay Americans didn't have certain rights haha now that we generally meaning progressives are in the majority will now take your rights away from straights no of course not right I think I don't know I would really like to start banning a Christian from coming into the country from predominantly Christian countries until we figure out what the hell what Jenks saying is so right on though because it is look the legislative agendas that come forward as a result of Christian dominance of white Christian dominance in the past they've been brutal I mean we're talking about the abridgement of civil rights and women's right to choose I mean these are things that really have a serious day-to-day impact on people so these demographic shifts they play out legislatively and that's really what you care about right you care about these laws that are made based on Christian tenants and they pull whatever Bible verse they want to justify whatever legislative agenda they have that's the real danger and that's why this is so very significant I think yeah it's a complete death though with just one last thing about it look these are facts of things that happened and that happened today so there was Jim Crow and let alone slavery and but in Jim Crow blacks didn't have the same rights as whites so they had different fountains and they weren't allowed to vote and they had to pay poll tax etc and don't worry white evangelical conservatives blacks are not going to do that to you there's not going to be a Jim Crow white laws like Oh from now on all these goddamn whites there I don't move don't let them in the pool right or you know they don't get the same voting rights no today there's voter ID laws to make sure that African Americans of all don't vote at the same rate as whites they have more polls open in the white areas of town event Christian evangelical areas without richer areas of town and less in the poorer or student areas of town words more likely to vote Democratic look I hope you got Democrats it when things are equal okay don't do likewise because we're not in favor of discrimination that's not what we're in favor of and so there's not going to be look I you know I've just said in the past that Democrats should strike back on voter ID laws so we can get to balance but no one in reality who is a progressive thinks that no let's not be equal let's be above them whatever who them is it's just not that's against the tenants of progressivism so and and that's part of their panic but look what the other thing is putting all that stuff aside the real reason I celebrate these numbers is did you hear that that is one quarter of Americans now who don't identify with a faith group now by the way they some of those could be spiritual people but they just have like over religion so they might be say think I think there's a higher power I think by believing this and I believe in that but I don't believe in a text from 2,500 years ago written by a guy who didn't know a goddamn thing kind of literally so and and so what did I tell you guys I mean we started this show a long time ago 15 years ago and I've been saying from day one the the people who are against the religion witches which includes me we're gonna win the other side is gonna lose and I wrote a scathing article about religion back in 2005 and I said look it's a frothing sea of insanity okay but and we're the island and they're the ocean but if we're gonna turn it around and we're in the middle of turning it around even just in when I wrote that article in oh five if you had said one five percent of Americans wouldn't believe in organized religion in the year 2017 would have said you're crazy they did say you're crazy he said I'm crazy they said there's no way you're gonna wipe out religion in the short term well we're in the middle of doing it and so I know why religious people or fundamentalist people flip out it's our culture war they're coming for us well you know other liberals might run from that I don't yes we are coming for the idea that a sky god should rule us well we have no freaking idea what this guy got thanks partly because he doesn't exist so no we should rule based on secular law and logic and the fact that that side is winning is awesome news it's great news so and if you don't like that sad day for you because all you're going to do from here on out is loose because there's a thing called the Internet what it does is it provides you information and knowledge so your kids are going to look up things and go oh virginal births those seem to happen that often guys walk it on water with no evidence that they actually did 2,000 years ago or a guy going on top of a mountain and telling him that that Allah talked to him and came back well you look at that Allah said I should I'd get all the chicks right your kids aren't going to believe that because that's nonsense so you could hate the messenger all you want but the proofs in the pudding and it's in the numbers if you like this video you'll love the
