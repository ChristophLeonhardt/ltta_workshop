WHO IS WHO IN THE CARAVAN. THE PRESIDENT GENERATED CONTROVERSY WHEN HE SAID THERE WERE DEFINITELY MS-13 AND OTHER ELEMENTS, ISIS ELEMENTS WITHIN THE 7,000 HE SAYS AS MUCH AS 10,000, AS MANY AS 10,000 MIGRANTS WHO ARE MAKING THEIR WAY HERE TO THE UNITED STATES, GUATEMALA HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR. THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY. WE HAVE SEEN NO WAY TO VERIFY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE MS-13 ELEMENTS OR ANYTHING APPROACHING THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE IS NO PROOF OF ANYTHING WHICH SEEMED TO REMOVE ANY OF THE DOUBTS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE VERACITY OF THAT STATEMENT. WE HAVE SIMPLY NOT HEARD SEPARATE CONFIRMATION OF ANY SUCH THING THAT THERE WERE ELEMENTS LIKE THAT WITHIN THE 7,000 TO 10,000 MIGRANTS WHO ARE MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE UNITED STATES. MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE MAKE JUMP OF THIS CARAVAN AND WHO IS IN IT, WHO IS NOT IN IT. I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE THREE COUNTRIES IN QUESTION, THAT THEY ARE LARGELY THOSE THREE, SOME MEXICANS COULD BE ADDED. THERE IS OBLIGATION THE PRESIDENT SAYS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS DUE PROCESS THERE HE DID SAY THAT WE ALLOW MANY INTO THIS COUNTRY 1 PULP 6 MILLION THE LEGAL WAY. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. THESE ARE CASES THAT WOULD BE TAKEN ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE ONCE THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM STATUS COME INTO THE UNITED STATES, THEIR PAPERWORK IS PROCESSED. THE RAP YOU HEAR FROM CRITICS OF THIS SYSTEM THAT THAT ULTIMATELY THEY ARE GIVEN A DATE TO COME BACK AND RETURN TO COURT AND STATE THEIR ASYLUM CASE. BUT, BY THAT TIME, THEY HAVE LONG SKIPPED TOWN AND THEY ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. NOW, ANOTHER IDEA THAT'S BEEN BAN TEED ABOUT THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T TOUCH ON IT HERE OR ONE IDEA APPROACHED THAT MAYBE THE MEXICANS HOLD THEM UNTIL THEY ARE CLEARED OR THEIR COURT DATES ARE CLEARED. I WANT TO STRESS HERE, THERE HAS BEEN NO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF SOME OF THESE MIGRANTS BEING TERRORISTS OR CERTAINLY PARTS OF MS-13 OR ANY OTHER NEFARIOUS ELEMENT. THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO PROVE THAT THE SUSPICIONS NOT WITH STANDING, SUSPICIONS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THE PRESIDENT SAID AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE TAKE AWAY. THERE IS NO PROOF OF ANYTHING, WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A REASSURING COMMENT TO MAKE WHEN YOU MAKE A CHARGE LIKE THAT. HAVING SAID THAT WHETHER THERE ARE SUCH ELEMENTS WITHIN THAT GROUP OR NOT. THE QUESTION IS AND BECOMES SUCH A LARGE GROUP COMING TO OUR BORDER AND HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM RIGHT WALID. IT IS A PROBLEM, OF COURSE, THE SIGHT OF IT AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, THIS IS NOT INDIVIDUALS COMING THROUGH OUR BORDERS AND THEN WE NEED TO DO SOME VETTING THAT ALONE IS A HEADACHE. THIS IS A SUPER HEADACHE. WHY? BECAUSE IN SECURITY ASSESSMENT, IT'S NOT THE JUDICIAL CLEARING. THE JUDICIAL CLEARING, YES, DID YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THIS PERSON IS MS-13 OR MS-13 HEZBOLLAH OR AL QAEDA, NO SECURITIES ASSESSMENT LOOK AT THE FRIEND. MULTIPLE TRENDS HERE. ALL THESE GANGS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AMERICA AREA PLUS, IN ADDITION TO THE CARTELS HAVE TRIED BEFORE FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR HEARINGS IN CONGRESS SO THE TREND IS THERE NUMBER TWO, THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT. HE SAID WE HAVE INFORMATION FROM OUR ALLIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA THAT THE VENEZUELAN REGIME, WITH WHOM WE ARE IN CONFLICT RIGHT NOW OVER MANY, MANY THINGS HAS BEEN PARTICIPATING IN PUSHING FOR THIS DEMONSTRATION. THAT, I WILL STOP AND SAY WAIT A MINUTE, VENEZUELAN REGIME THAT IS NOT ASSESSMENT. THIS IS INFORMATION WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT. AND VENEZUELA HAS AN ALLIANCE WITH IRAN. HAS AN ALLIANCE WITH HEZBOLLAH. THIS IS HOW THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT WOULD SAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SECURE. Neil: JUST GETTING IT ON A WHISPER AND QT FROM ALLIES DOESN'T MAKE IT SO. THIS IS NOT A NEW THING WHERE CARAVANS OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO COME IN USING SHEAR NUMBERS TO TRY TO WALK THROUGH TO THINK THEY HAVE TO BE INSPIRED OR BROUGHT ON BY NEFARIOUS ELEMENTS. WHILE THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE PROOF OF THAT, DO WE? I DON'T THINK I'M IN THE POSITION TO SAY WE HAVE THE PROOF OR NOT, OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, COUNTER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE ACTUALLY INSIDE THE DEMONSTRATION. THAT'S WHY YOU FELT HESITATION ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT TO GO IN DETAILS. IN THEIR SECURITY ASSESSMENT, I IMAGINE THEY HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION TO OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. I IMAGINE THAT SOME ANSWERS WERE MADE AVAILABLE. Neil: ALL RIGHT. WALID, IN THE MEANTIME, YOU MIGHT BE OF THE IMPRESSION HEARING ALL OF THIS, THAT WE ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE BORDERS OF THIS COUNTRY, WHEN IN FACT, WE HAVE BEEN AVERAGING ANYWHERE FROM 1.1 TO 1.2 MILLION LEGAL IMMIGRANTS INTO THIS COUNTRY GOING THROUGH THE LEGAL METHODS PER YEAR EVERY YEAR. AND THIS HAS CONTINUED UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. SO ACTUALLY ACCELERATED A LITTLE BIT. SOMETIMES THERE IS THE MISNOMER OUT THERE THAT WE ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE BORDER. I'M WONDERING FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT, DOES THIS GIVE AN IMAGE THAT WE ARE JUST TRYING TO POLICE PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT OR PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT THE WRONG WAY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? LOOK, MY FRIEND, I HAVE BEEN A LEGAL IMMIGRANT. THAT'S HOW I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES. I WAS NOT BORN HERE. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME CAME AND COME EVERY DAY TO THE UNITED STATES THAT'S A NORMAL THING. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS AN ORGANIZED MOVEMENT WHICH BASICALLY IS NOT HEEDING THE ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION OF LET US DO THE RIGHT THING, THE VETTING. LET US CLEAR OUT THINGS THEY WANT TO GET TO THE BORDER AND CROSS THE BORDER AND PROVE IDEOLOGICAL POINT. THAT IS SUSPICIOUS. HAD THIS MOVEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPT YOU HAD THE NOTION OF U.N. SPONSORED HUMAN ZONE NORTH OF GUATEMALA OR SOUTH OF MEXICO. MANY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE IN THAT DIRECTION. THE ORGANIZERS REFUSED. SO THEY DON'T HAVE. Neil: CARAVANS THEMSELVES GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME GOAL OF GETTING TO THE UNITED STATES OR INTO MEXICO
