the Senate has passed its version of the spending bill and Donald Trump is not too happy about it because of the lack of funding for the border wall now remember Trump had said this about funding the border wall it'll be a real wall there's gonna be a real wall it's gonna be a real wall it will be a real wall it's gonna be a real wall a real wall and Mexico will pay for the wall Mexico is going to pay for it and they'll be happy to pay for it the wall is gonna be paid for by Mexico they don't know it yet but they're gonna pay for them we're gonna make them pay for that wall but they're gonna pay for the wall trust me Mexico will pay for it and I will have Mexico pay for that wall mark my words Mexico's gonna pay for the wall one hundred percent a hundred percent a hundred percent who is going to pay for the wall who who's gonna pay for the wall who's gonna pay for the wall well that's literally what he has today yeah I got an answer he's definitely the new salt babe because he is really upset that the Senate has not allocated the funding that he wants for the wall in fact he shared his dismay on Twitter saying I want to know where is the money for border security and the wall in this ridiculous spending bill I know where it is Donald it's in Mexico yeah well I mean aren't they gonna pay for it and where will it come from after the midterms Mexico right Dems are obstructing law enforcement and border security Republicans must finally get tough okay now keep in mind this is the Senate voting the House of Representatives has not voted on the spending bill yet but this is only going to fund the government up until December 7th after that the lawmakers will get together again and make a decision about the future of spending now lawmakers have so far failed to reach any larger deal over immigration but they have allotted nearly one point six billion dollars this year for border security so they did not want to put any poison pill riders in this bill what does that mean it both sides from time to time like to put things that are unrelated to a bill within a bill that must pass like overall spending bills like this one to try to squeeze it in and so in this case they both sides really wanted this to pass before the elections because they didn't want to screw up their chance of winning the elections so they all agreed 93 to 7-6 Republicans voted no and of course Bernie Sanders voted no because it's overspending and he's fiscally responsible and for many other reasons and so a poison pill is for example Mike lead if the Republicans said he oh he wanted what he calls a pro-life provision in there but the Democrats wouldn't vote for it and it wouldn't pass hey you don't have to put it into a spending bill Mike Lee if you think you're gonna win why don't you just introduce it you guys are in charge and see if you win on that issue oh you're not gonna win are you so why are you crying that it didn't get snuck into a completely irrelevant bill why don't you just play fair and honest and you claim the country's what you call pro-life now the polling shows you're wrong that the country is at least two-thirds pro-choice so why don't you put up your bill and see how it does well you don't want to do that you want tricks so okay now another poison pill would have been the wall if they had put in what Trump requested which is 25 billion dollars to build that nonsense wall well the Democrats would have voted no and they wouldn't have had a deal so now Donald Trump is saying oh my god I can't believe it where are you gonna get the money but don't we just showed you your claims that you weren't just gonna get it from Mexico you were gonna get 100% from X right exactly so we all knew that that was a joke and it wasn't gonna happen and so how much is Trump asking for for the border wall I'm not just talking about border security okay take border security out of it what does he want specifically for the border wall 25 billion dollars in taxpayer money so look I think it's important to look at this in the the bigger picture which is we have less revenue coming into the federal government because of these giant tax cuts for the wealthy and Trump loves to spend he doesn't like to spend on you but he certainly loves to spend on things like the wall he wanted to spend on a military parade it looks like that's been shelved for the moment okay he wants to spend on increased defense contracts that's what I was thinking about so he and he did he proposed an increase to that as well and so he wants to spend like crazy on these issues that don't actually benefit taxpayers and then he also wants to bring in less revenue and cut taxes for the wealthy and and so he said in those in that clip you watch for yourself he said trust me Mexico's gonna pay for it he even did the rest thinking like okay who's gonna pay for it right so I don't know why the Democrats would ever engage in this debate and to their credit they didn't and they blocked it here but they'd say the minute the Republican was asked for funding of any wall and by the way it's already one point six billion dollars in there for the wall I would have given zero dollars and go I heard from your guy that a hundred percent was gonna go from Marc from Mexico and he said mark my words and I marked his words okay my favorite part of that clip was when he said they're gonna trust me they're gonna pay for it and they're gonna be happy to pay for he's such a weird over-the-top liar and all the supporters like the minute the election is over I can tell you to them it's just wrestling they don't take him seriously to be fair I really enjoyed watching that clip it is entertaining yeah okay so I and I don't think his voters care that he lies they knew he did in Mexico was they were gonna pay for it right they're like okay yeah so it makes it was that pay for it whatever our guy's a liar who cares let's move on but he was entertaining liar
