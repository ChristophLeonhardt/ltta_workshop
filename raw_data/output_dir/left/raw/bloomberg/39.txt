1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,129
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,960
bin Salman isn't waiting for his

3
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:06,089
turn at the throne to take his
country

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,880
in a radically different direction.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,200
The 32 year old prince is distancing

6
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:12,059
himself from hardline Islam

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,610
progressing women's rights

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,890
and looking past oil for income.

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,479
But not since the reign of the
country's founder

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,610
has this much power been in one
man's

11
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,350
hands.

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,940
Here's a man who identifies

13
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,799
himself as the leader of this
country.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,860
Even though his father still remains
king

15
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,800
this is the story of a Saudi
millennial

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,449
whose progressive yet autocratic
tendencies

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,580
are sending shock waves through the
entire

18
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,260
region.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,999
Mohammad bin Salman also known as

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,890
MBS hasn't always been in

21
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:46,380
line for the Saudi throne.

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,460
For decades the throne has been
passed

23
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:50,440
from elderly brother to a slightly
less

24
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,420
elderly brother.

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,910
All sons of the founder of Saudi
Arabia.

26
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,020
But MBS is set to buck

27
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:56,880
that trend.

28
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,700
His relationship

29
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,249
with his father has put him in a
position

30
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,679
that has allowed him to leapfrog

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,019
other members of his immediate

32
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,439
family because of the trust of his
father

33
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,050
seemingly has in him

34
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,290
that close bond was years in the

35
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:11,940
making.

36
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,529
Unlike his brothers the prince was
educated

37
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,720
in Saudi Arabia.

38
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,610
He was by his father's side

39
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,699
through most of most of his
childhood

40
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,149
and so he understands how

41
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,249
the royal family works.

42
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,310
From an insider's playbook

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,870
a few years after graduating from
King

44
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,730
Saud University the prince went to

45
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:32,740
work for his father then the
governor

46
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,689
of Riyadh in 2011.

47
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,690
His father was named defense
minister.

48
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,770
But MBS was initially barred from
entering

49
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:40,750
the ministry because of rumors that
he was

50
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:42,600
disruptive and power hungry.

51
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,890
Gradually the prince worked his way
back

52
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,899
into the then kings good graces

53
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,050
and he was assigned to Ministry of
Defence

54
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,249
where he brought in western
consulting firms

55
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,730
to streamline bureaucratic
inefficiencies.

56
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,230
In 2015 his father became

57
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,750
king and gave his favorite son
unprecedented

58
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,140
control over the majority of
government.

59
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,006
The Prince became known as Mr.

60
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,020
Everything.

61
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,360
Finally in the summer of 2017

62
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,430
the king named him crown prince

63
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,599
the first in line bypassing his

64
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,309
uncle one of many older

65
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,340
and more experienced statesmen.

66
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,770
He would describe himself as

67
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,879
the first Saudi

68
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,700
leader of this stature

69
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,690
raised in the Internet

70
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:23,400
age

71
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,480
and as someone who grew

72
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,279
up playing video games.

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,299
Peter Waldman writes about the
Middle East

74
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,230
interviewed the prince for
Businessweek

75
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,360
he compares himself to the

76
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,980
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs

77
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,460
and says I'm going to take my state

78
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,200
in a kind of visionary

79
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,250
direction.

80
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,329
In 2016 the prince launched

81
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,190
Vision 2030 his plan

82
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:48,080
to transform Saudi Arabia by

83
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,699
weaning the nation off of oil

84
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,490
and liberalizing society.

85
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,660
He's lifted the prohibition on women

86
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,580
driving. He's introduced public

87
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,129
entertainment such as concerts

88
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,169
and he's allowed cinemas to

89
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,700
open.

90
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,139
The prince also plans to fulfill
what

91
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,969
he calls different dreams

92
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,790
for a post carbon future

93
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,760
a major piece of that plan is to
sell

94
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,030
shares in a state owned oil company

95
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,110
Saudi Aramco which could create

96
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,170
the biggest IPO in history.

97
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,519
The reaction to the Aramco IPO

98
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,349
has been one

99
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,369
of them

100
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,260
and I think a bit of shock depending
on where you're

101
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,180
looking at it.

102
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,090
For years the kingdom has relied on
petroleum

103
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,980
for 90 percent of the state budget.

104
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,959
Almost all of its export earnings

105
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,860
and more than half of its gross
domestic

106
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,570
product.

107
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,040
They brought in huge oil revenues

108
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,900
and spent it for their own

109
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,329
survival as a royal

110
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,110
family in terms of subsidising

111
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,390
lifestyles among Saudis

112
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,350
so they wouldn't push back

113
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,390
against this very autocratic

114
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:50,200
family.

115
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,360
The collapse of oil prices from one
hundred forty

116
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,900
dollars a barrel to the 30s in 2016

117
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,100
caused the IMF to declare that the
country

118
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,930
would be bankrupt by 2020 if

119
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:02,170
it carried on spending as much as it
does.

120
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,340
What this 32 year old prince

121
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,310
has said very clearly is

122
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,950
we can no longer rely on oil

123
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,080
to fund our lifestyles.

124
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,210
We have to begin to contribute

125
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,820
on a personal level to work

126
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,959
to be entrepreneurial to find

127
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,998
investments to find businesses

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
like a normal state.

129
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,190
The crown prince introduced taxes

130
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,480
slashed handouts

131
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,560
and is trying to make Saudis
actually

132
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,470
pay for the energy they consume.

133
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,960
The prince also heads an
anti-corruption

134
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:35,389
commission and in the fall of 2017

135
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,609
he carried out an unprecedented
purge

136
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,440
of the Saudi elite arresting

137
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,569
four ministers 11 princes

138
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,120
and countless businessmen.

139
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,050
Most were freed after returning what
were

140
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,230
alleged to be ill gotten gains

141
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,100
by taking on his cousins in

142
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,260
the royal family.

143
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,459
He's sending a signal that

144
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,320
he is dead serious about

145
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,089
changing the Saudi system.

146
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,699
However it has not apply to himself

147
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,520
thus far

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,059
and I think his own personal

149
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,240
excesses undermine

150
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,550
the signal he's trying to send.

151
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,280
While his approach may seem
unforgiving

152
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,239
Mbius is shaping the Middle East

153
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,250
in ways no one could really have
ever

154
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,080
imagined

155
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
and being so young he's likely to

156
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,670
hold power for over a half century

157
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,869
meaning there will be continuity of
government

158
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,680
but without the checks

159
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,250
and balances needed to prevent a
dictatorship.

160
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,209
Saudi Arabia is a police state

161
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,610
from top to bottom

162
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,870
and it will continue to be for

163
00:05:29,871 --> 00:00:00,000
the foreseeable future.
