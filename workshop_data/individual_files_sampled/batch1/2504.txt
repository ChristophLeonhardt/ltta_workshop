um what have you made about the news about Obamacare in recent weeks with insurers pulling out of exchanges in states how troubled is the Affordable Care it's trouble I mean this is a real the way I would put it is Obamacare was put together it is kind of it's kind of a Rube Goldberg device I've always said that it's an attempt to simulate a single-payer system without single-payer by through a combination of regulations subsidies and so on which is you know country other countries have made it work parts of the US system are here where California seems to be doing fine but it was done we have to say it was done kind of on the cheap for political reasons all of the pieces are leader under strength or underfunded the the individual mandate is not as strong as it should be so sick people you know healthy people still find it too easy to wait until they get sick the subsidies for consumers are little underfunded the outreach efforts are underfunded so it sits low threadbare and we're possibly seeing it start to unravel at least in not in all of the country but in parts of the country so this is of course it would not take a whole lot of money a whole lot of effort to fix except almost certainly the fixes would require legislation and then we talk about divided government
