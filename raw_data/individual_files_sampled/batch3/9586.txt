AHEAD AND DROP IN AND WE'LL TAKE YOU LIVE TO SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA AND GREG PALKOT. THIS LETTER IS TO CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN, CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE AFFAIRS COMMISSION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF KOREA IT READS AS FOLLOWS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, PATIENCE AND EFFORT WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECENT NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS RELATIVE TO A SUMMIT LONG SOUGHT BY BOTH PARTIES SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE ON JUNE 12 IN SINGAPORE. WE WERE INFORMED THE MEETING WAS REQUESTED BY NORTH KOREA BUT THAT TO US IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT. I WAS VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING THERE WITH YOU. SADLY, BASED ON THE TREMENDOUS ANGER AND OPEN HOSTILITY DISPLAYED IN YOUR MOST RECENT STATEMENT I FEEL IT IS APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO HAVE THIS LONG-PLANNED MEETING I FEEL IT IS INAPPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME TO HAVE THIS LONG-PLANNED MEETING. THEREFORE, PLEASE LET THIS LETTER SERVE TO REPRESENT THAT THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT FOR THE GOOD OF BOTH PARTIES, BUT TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE WORLD, WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES BUT OURS ARE SO MASSIVE AND POWERFUL THAT I PRAY TO GOD THEY WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE USED. I FELT THAT A WONDERFUL DIALOGUE WAS BUILDING UP BETWEEN YOU AND ME AND ULTIMATELY IS ONLY THAT DIALOGUE THAT MATTERS. SOMEDAY, I LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO MEETING YOU. IN THE MEANTIME I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES WHO ARE NOW HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE AND WAS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND HAVING TO DO WITH THIS IMPORTANT SUMMIT DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME OR WRITE. THE WORLD AND NORTH KOREA IN PARTICULAR HAS LOST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR LASTING PEACE AND GREAT PROSPERITY AND WEALTH. THIS MISSED OPPORTUNITY IS A TRULY SAD MOMENT IN HISTORY.
