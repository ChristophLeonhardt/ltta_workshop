I would say due to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 - oh baby love the government because God is obtained ordain the government for his purposes okay Goff just cause because you know who also used this very same Bible passage to rationalize their actions slave owners so I guess it's no surprise that Jeff pulled out this passage but if you plan to use the Bible to justify separating children from their parents take a look here and ask yourself how does this make you feel is this what it means to be making America great again what about when you hear stories of the four-year-old child who was left to take care of other children for days yeah she was reportedly so traumatized that she simply stopped talking she just curled up in a ball or what about the 16 year old - had to teach other children in the detention center how to look after other children by showing them how to change diapers or about the mother who was told by Border Patrol agents that they were taking her child to get bathed only to be told half an hour later you won't see that child again or what about this two years old seeking asylum from Honduras is separating her from her parents biblical is this what it means to be tough on immigration because these are just some of the countless horror stories that American citizens even American citizens who voted for Trump would be appalled to find out about happening anywhere else in the world children separated from their families locked together given foil sheets as blankets and forbidden from playing but the thing is it's not happening in any other country it's right here in the United States and it's not coming from Obama or the Dems it's Donald Trump he's the president you see Dhoni is an expert on pilling blame on others and his audience eats it up it makes it easier for them to digest this horror and still feel good about it but this policy is not anyone else's but his a total of 1174 children have been taken away from their mothers and fathers in the Border Patrol's South Texas Rio Grande Valley as a direct result of Trump's zero-tolerance policy that requires children to be separated from their parents and you better believe his menus will do anything they can to deflect or pass the blame such as secretary Kirsten Nielsen who tweeted we do not have a policy of separating families at the border period well that's interesting because that contradicts exactly what senior policy adviser Stephen Miller pushed for the policy changed that Jeff Sessions gleefully announced so unless close to 2,000 kids voluntarily decided to leave their parents I get a sense she's channeling her fearless leader and lying through her teeth but I guess both each line isn't as bad as Jeff and Sarah Huckabee Santos citing the Bible as a means to justify the inhumane acts of their administration's I can say that it is very biblical to enforce the law because we know while Jesus broke bread and fed the masses it really supported keeping them in cages with foil sheets until dental time the reality is this new zero-tolerance policy is in reaction to a very flawed policy and acted on the previous administration's the existing catch and release program offer the Gateway for people looking to enter the States in needed rectifying but how is the solution to a bad policy a wicked policy that dehumanizes and separates babies from their models this cruelty is essentially justified because of this consistent fear-mongering that has been absorbed by Trump voters they're bringing crime they're rapists an approach that was based on fallacies to begin with about being tough on illegals because they were bringing crime despite the fact that statistically speaking states with a larger influx of unauthorized immigrants have slightly less violent crime not more but the thing is we know this all the line and demonizing of immigrants was never about just targeting ms-13 there's a way to open the gates to justify unimaginable cruelty like the port's in a Kansas College professor who's lived here for thirty years over a 2012 traffic stop so let me ask the Trump votos is that the type of violent criminals your fearless leader was talking about is this the America you're so proud of because this is the America you voted for follow me on Instagram Francis and Max Owen on Twitter also Francis and Maxwell like and share this video you can get the TYT app here and as always continue to resist
