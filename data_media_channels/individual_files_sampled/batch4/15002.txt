what is a beauty pageant without beauty I don't know I don't think it's a thing anymore it reminds me of the phrase in the book of Matthew in the Bible about salt that has lost its saltiness it's nothing it's like water that's not wet that's that's just not a thing I'm talking about the announcement that Miss America will no longer have a swimsuit competition not just that they won't be judged on appearance at all that's what their new boss says it's not just the swimsuits it's physical appearance that is now gone if you're scratching Carlson who runs Miss America with the announcement we are no longer a pageant we are a competition we will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance that's huge huge hole that's my chance I've never really had the finger that's code for I'm fat but I've got a chance now since looks are out here's a tweet by the Miss America pageant with a very short video in it it's going poof as you see up in smoke yeah I mean who knows maybe people will tune into a beauty pageant without the beauty part or maybe that puff of smoke is just a lot of investors money just evaporating maybe we could have the Indy 500 without all that driving part I'm just brainstorming here now the Miss America bosses say it's not a pageant at all anymore it's now a competition well okay TV is full of those there's a ton of them American Idol Canadian Idol they really got the ball rolling America's Got Talent x-factor whatever I don't watch anything I don't want you Miss America reality TV talent shows that I think all this is now is Miss America is just another talent show but only for women I mean well prettiness even be a factor anymore if so how will it be measured if not then what exactly is this besides a weirdly named talent show that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
