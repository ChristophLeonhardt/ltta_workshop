00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hi guys so yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was planning to</font>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,259
put up a second video<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my 52 weeks</font>

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,910
project but I have decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scrap it</font>

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,120
because I can't look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and can't</font>

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,550
edit it I can't focus on anything

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,160
because I'm just too upset and too sad

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,630
since you are an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet person</font>

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,310
watching this I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have already</font>

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,859
heard and read<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a UC Santa Barbara</font>

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,710
shooting and you've probably been

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,399
looking at the yes all women tag on

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,739
Twitter and Tumblr across the internet

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,420
so I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in too</font>

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,540
much detail but the gist of it is that

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,180
we live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world where while not all</font>

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,230
men harass or commit sexual violence

17
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,930
against women all women experience

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,289
harassment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and/or sexual violence we</font>

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,489
repeatedly constantly it's the fear that

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,280
accompanies going out with your friends

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,790
and having a drink or two or walking

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,890
home by yourself or taking public

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,790
transit or existing as a woman in the

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,400
world in general when you as a woman

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
start telling your friends a story about

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,350
some creepy guy who harassed you or

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,840
followed you or made you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel unsafe</font>

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,020
they invariably have stories of their

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,960
own to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell and I say I've been sexually</font>

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920
harassed every single women out there is

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,600
thinking me too so while not all men

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,420
feel entitled to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our attention or our</font>

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,210
affection or our physical bodies and

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not all men obviously feel that</font>

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,329
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a killing spree is a logical</font>

36
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,540
response to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexual frustration all women</font>

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,060
live in some kind of fear to sound agree

38
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,330
that that could

39
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,390
and offs if you track that tag on the

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,460
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media of your choice you will</font>

41
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,160
find thousands of better and more

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,710
thorough responses so I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,100
offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this one challenge if you've</font>

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,580
never done<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hurt or</font>

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,210
intimidate or harass commit violence

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,900
against a woman that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic but</font>

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,390
please take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a moment and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

48
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're doing to stop it because we</font>

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
haven't been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at ourselves</font>

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,720
it and there are too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out</font>

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,150
there still perpetuating this violent

52
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,690
and entitled bullshit idea that refuses

53
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,140
to even see women as human so please

54
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,320
think about what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to make sure</font>

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,090
that women are respected and that

56
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're safe because our pain and here</font>

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,880
is too much to shoulder alone anymore

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll see you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next week</font>
