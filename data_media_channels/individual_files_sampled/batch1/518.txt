his path to the presidency began in 1999 as deputy under the leadership of Thabo Mbeki but personal differences and power struggles put a strain on their relationship in June 2005 President Mbeki fired Jacob Zuma as South Africa's deputy president over allegations of fraud related to a multibillion-dollar arms deal four months later Zuma's financial advisor Shabbir shaikh was convicted of corruption and fraud by december zuma was charged with raping an hiv-positive family friend but was acquitted by April 2006 despite the scandals zoomer remained popular and by December 2007 he was elected president of the ruling African National Congress ten days later Zuma was charged with fraud corruption money laundering and racketeering in 2009 Zuma was elected president just a month after corruption charges were dropped in 2010 he announced a major overhaul to South Africa's hiv/aids policy rolling out life-saving antiretroviral drugs but his government faced criticism for poor economic performance growing unemployment poor service delivery and corruption in his second term Zuma faced one of his biggest scandals the 23 million dollar refurbishment of his private residence with taxpayers money and as public officials and opposition parties demanded that he pay back the money when is repaying the money as directed by the public protect of all I am sitting about is that sir Africans will remember all the bad scandals that Jacob Zuma was Maya de we are not going to forget this scandal so I think that his will be a legacy of the very scandalous leader who did not know what to do with a mission by the end of 2015 Zuma was accused of acting in the interests of his political and business associates his clothes and allegedly corrupt relationship with the Guptas a prominent and influential family was a source of disk and tenth within his party and the public several questionable cabinet reshuffles and allegations of influenced by the guptas further weakened public confidence in Zuma still Zuma resisted calls from within and outside of his party to resign is the president willing to take accountability for the decision and resign in front of the people of South Africa in 2017 Zuma returned to court to fight the reinstatement of decade old corruption charges throughout this time Zuma faced several motions of no-confidence in Parliament by December of that year deputy president of the ANC so Ramaphosa replaced him as party leader no longer president of the ruling party Zuma's position of strength weakened making way for a dramatic end for a leader who many say routinely courted controversy rather than inspiring confidence Scheherazade Ghafoor al-jazeera
