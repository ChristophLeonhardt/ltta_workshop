you
you
these last words I speak shall never
echo again this is my last cry to be
your friend
you're confused disillusioned you're
falling down I do anything to help you
stop you drown the night you won't
accept my extended hand you hit the
ground and I turn to sand the lights are
out is anyone there there you are torn
and scared or the Riyadh the walls close
in there is no one there except the you
and I reality of our
so tell me did it ever cross your mind
that I cared view so tell me did it ever
cross your mind these perceptions you
have made I've just not true
I'm confused disillusioned I'm falling
down I don't see you there I'm gonna
drown but now you won't put out your own
hand I hit the ground but this time it
is i who turns to sand
the lights are out is anyone there there
you are torn and scared the walls close
in there is no one there except for ye
and thy beauty of our minds are such
so tell me did it ever cross your mind
that I cared for you so tell me did it
ever cross your mind these perceptions
you have of me are just not true I've
just not true
you
you
