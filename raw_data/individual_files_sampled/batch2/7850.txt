so during Brett Cavanaugh's interview with Fox News one of the things that he really wanted to drive home was that he needs an opportunity to be heard which is fascinating because usually it is the victims of sexual assault who feel like their voices haven't been heard but nonetheless here's Kavanagh talking about how he just wants people to treat him fairly I wanna I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity and all I'm asking for is fairness and that I'd be heard in this process all I'm asking for is a fair process where I can be heard again again just asking for a fair process where I can be heard and I can defend my integrity I would say fair process let me be heard fair process hear from both sides and listen to me I just want a fair process where I can be heard you don't have any thoughts on what's Janet where this is coming from I just want a fair process where I can be heard defend my integrity defend the integrity of my family again I'm just asking for a fair process where I can be heard and defend my integrity and defend my family's integrity we're looking for a fair process where I could be heard and defend the my integrity what I want to talk about where you think this is coming from I just want an opportunity a fair process where I can defend my integrity okay we did not repeat any of those he said every single one of those so gee I wonder if it was rehearse I can't quite tell and but there's something greatly ironic there I just want a fair process where I could be heard well good news for you you're in the middle of a national interview you could be heard right now right so she's asking you questions are you gonna do the same thing in the hearings where you don't answer the questions and that's an incredibly friendly interviewer from Fox News if you if you can't answer her questions and you're gonna go with the rehearse answers your lawyer gave you then what are we doing here what do you mean fair process where you can be heard you've been heard over and over and over again and you will be heard again on Thursday well like who's who's shutting you up actually I disagree with you Jane because I do think that he's being treated unfairly okay and it's because of the way Senate Republicans have been behaving specifically those on the Senate Judiciary Committee red Cavanaugh absolutely deserves a fair process and the only way that we will get to the truth is an FBI investigation not a criminal investigation as I've said a billion times I'm specifically calling for a background investigation which is what the FBI did in the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas hearings okay to get to the bottom of the truth is there anything they can find in his background giving given this new information that can get to the heart of the matter that can get to the bottom of the truth and figure out what's really going on right no that's that's a great point and and he keeps saying that he wants he at the bottom of it there is a good way to get to the bottom of it that's the FBI and look and you have to understand that would be stacked totally in his favor why do I say that because the FBI is biased no no no in this case I'm I don't think they're biased towards Republicans which would be the charge here if you were saying that no I'm saying they're likely to find it inconclusive because it was 35 36 years ago so if you have the FBI look into it very likely they'll either come back with you know it you know there's if he's right they'll come back with there's no other witnesses no only other witness mention is the one that dr. Blasi mentioned my a mark judge who is a friend of Cavanaugh in Backson it might clear him in that sense they wouldn't say guilty or not guilty in an FBI background check but they would say there are no other witnesses that'd be a huge win for him the other thing that they could do is come back and likely say inconclusive and then he can say come on you gonna deny me over inconclusive I guess the one thing he's afraid of is the percentage chance that they come back with witnesses many other witnesses or many other women so he says he wants a fair hearing but meanwhile he's like let's hurry up and vote that's exactly right and Senate Republicans have been clear in that as soon as this testimony happens as soon as this hearing happens they want to rush a vote as soon as possible they have no interest in hearing what the accuser possibly accusers if Debora Ramirez is included have to say about any of these cases now let's go to Cavanaugh mentioning all the people who back him listen to the people who've known me best through my whole life the women who've known me since high school the 65 who overnight signed a letter from high school saying I always treated them with dignity and respect you know I was good friends with them and we remain good friends that's how sixty five people on a moment's notice 65 women listen to the women who've known me my whole life a letter from friends I knew in high school produced overnight 65 women who knew me in high school listen to the people have known me throughout my life the men and women the women have known me throughout my life the women I knew in college and the men I knew in college says it's inconceivable that I could have done such a thing but the women who knew me when I was 14 years old for the last seven years I've been coaching girls basketball as the moms so 63 women who have signed that letter because two of those women have since withdrawn their names in fact one of those women appeared in the judicial crisis network ad that we had shown you when the story first broke but those women Luisa Gary and Dino you egg have decided to withdraw their names because of probably all the developments that have happened since they agreed to sign the letter supporting Cavanaugh yeah in a mansion look there's no way of knowing that the Ramirez story didn't happen so I don't want to be part of a letter that says that seems to indicate that these things didn't happen when there's no way we could know and so that's a super fair response they're not saying Cavanaugh did it they're just saying we also don't want to say Ramirez is lying or bla Z's lying because we don't know that yeah but I think the most important part of that is that it was a woman in the ad I mean the the the corporate PAC that is supporting him judicial Christ's Network I don't know who funds them but they have millions upon millions of dollars that they are spending to back Kavanaugh and they picked a woman who they apparently thought this is the perfect person out of all those people to represent Cavanaugh now she's backed out and going man I don't know about that yeah in fact I I want to bring that judicial crisis Network ad back to give you a sense of how aggressively she supported him at first and now again she's withdrawing that support because she says I don't know I wasn't there and I don't want to be associated with people that are just outright denying that these things happened so Luisa Geary is her name again she appeared in the judicial crisis network ad in support of Brett Kavanaugh the judicial crisis network is essentially a group of right-wing conservatives who specifically want to make sure that the Supreme Court is stacked with conservative Supreme Court justices let's take a look at their ad friends with Brett Kavanaugh for 35 years never thought about doing a TV commercial I'm not involved in politics I'm a teacher I'm I believe that we need to have bright curious open-minded thoughtful empathetic people who are judges and I trust that bright is that person oops so whenever you see an ad glossy ad like that you should wonder where it came from so these guys have are gonna spend at least five million dollars bagging Cavanaugh you guys know anybody who's got five millions long $1.00 lying around who's gonna give to things like no no no it is very very wealthy people who have an interest in having Cavanaugh on the bench and then they a lot of times Republicans can't find people to real people to put in the ads and they'll put in actors in this case they got a real person and oops and now she's backed out going okay so that's not good now look at the risk of nitpicking a little bit when he says hey I coached girls sports and you could ask the their moms at dude it's a low bar right I mean okay you didn't molest any of the girls with their moms when you were their coach yeah I know but we're like I get it he's trying to know but okay I'm gonna explain why that's an insanely weak defense okay because look all of us have different characteristics depending on who we're dealing with right and so we're not all innocent right I mean we're not all engaging in possibly criminal activity but I'll give you an example so when I'm with my friends like I'm a high school student or college student with that when I'm with my friends I behave a certain way right I let loose so I might drink or I might partake in other things that I wouldn't want adults knowing about but then when I'm around my my friend's parents I'm not like what like I don't do that right so for someone to say go ask my friends parents they think very highly of me of course they do because you make sure to edit your behavior when you're around those people I mean so it's a great point and people always like who's the real you know fill in the blank Howard Stern the guy on air or not on there it said there is no real anyone you're a hundred percent right you act completely different nice to your parents than you would next to your friends and so yeah if you were going nuts while coaching little girls that would be like really weird and to be problematic but I know he's just trying to thrash about trying to make any defense for himself so look in the postgame I'll tell you guys embarrassing stories about me in high school not high school junior high and in fifth grade where I told two terrible lies and it still kind of haunts me to this day and and it's weird like that he can't just be human for a second and say man this stuff I did in high school was I feel really bad about it because we were kids and we were knuckleheads and we were trying to brag to each other just be a human for a second and what's super ironic is that the Republican Party and I'm specifically talking about voters found Trump so appealing because of how real he seems right how authentic he is when he speaks off-the-cuff and how he doesn't follow the typical political script when he's communicating but then with Brett Kavanaugh he is the definition of traditional politics in the way he carries and conducts himself and it it doesn't really seem to matter with Trump's pace they're still very supportive of Kavanagh yeah and by the way if you want to hear those outrageous stories of my youth tea y-t-dot-com slice join to become a member and get all of our shows including
