with an exploding volcano in Guatemala deadly protests in Nicaragua an ongoing crisis in Venezuela the Organization of American States annual assembly couldn't have been more timely there are 35 nations at the gathering in Washington if only a few are dominating discussions after weeks of protests and Nicaragua were more than 100 people have died calling for the president's resignation countries here expressed growing concern but Nicaragua's foreign minister claims it's locked in a battle with criminal gangs Nicaragua has come to this General Assembly to express its commitment to peace security and stability of our nation which is currently undergoing an attack by criminal groups America's new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was addressing the OAS for the first time revisiting what he sees as an old problem he's demanding greater sanctions against Venezuela and his president Nicolas Maduro a call on fellow member states to apply additional pressure on the Maduro regime including sanctions and further diplomatic isolation until such time as it undertakes the actions necessary to return genuine democracy and provide people desperately needed access to international humanitarian aid we call on all a OAS nations to do this today as the small round of applause died the Venezuelan delegation insisted the US was breaching the rules of the organizations it was calling to action you do not have the moral authority of any kind to try and undermine our government and we see that in the articles articles 19 to 20 of this Charter you are violating the OAS Charter the UN Charter and what are you seeking calls to suspend Venezuela from the OAS are virtually redundant Venezuela itself has said it's going to leave the organization and that two-year process will end next year but it's clear that while Venezuela says it won't take any part in the formal OAS gathering here in Washington it won't allow what it perceives to be a tax to go unanswered Nicolas Maduro won a new six-year term as Venezuela's president last month in an election which was widely criticized internationally but the US position in Venezuela is a big challenge to the OAS Latin and Caribbean nations have always been reluctant to act against the country it regards as a long-term friend and Ally but there is a sense that patience is running out although no one is clear what comes after the warmth of condemnation Alan Fisher al Jazeera as the OAS General Assembly in Washington
