"You want me to say on television
that I support arming 3 and 4 year olds?
Is that what you're asking?"
"Uhh yes."
"Typically members of congress don'’t just
hear a story about a program and indicate
if they support it or not."
"I support the kinderguardian program. 
We in america would be wise to
implement it too."
"Rocket ship rpg will take you to the moon."
"The bad guys are going to the
moon if they attack your school
with big scary fireworks."
"A 3 year old cannot defend itself
from an assault rifle by throwing a
hello kitty pencil case at it."
"This lunchbox and push it
into it’s tummy like this."
"Just remember to point puppy pistols mouth
right at the middle of the bad man."
Conservatives, arming
3-year-olds to own the libs.
This is the mentality of
Republican congressmen.
And it’s f**king terrifying.
Putting guns in the hands of law 
abiding citizens whether it be teachers
or whether they actually be
talented children or highly
trained pre-schoolers.
In his latest act of comedic genius,
Sacha Baron Cohen goes undercover
as anti-terror expert Erran Morad, and 
effortlessly dupes countless Republicans into
supporting a campaign to arm
children in America.
Now, while most sane people would
be outraged that government officials
support stuffed animal pistols, that group
of sane people doesn’t seem to include a
vast majority of conservatives in America.
Who, rather than comment on their fellow
Republicans’ mind blowing absurdity, instead
voiced their outrage at Cohen’s disguise 
and his ‘disgusting’ techniques.
Like let’s just break this down into 
even simpler terms shall we.
People in this country are
more upset at a comedian being a
comedian than they are at
congressmen saying they want to
put grenades in lunchboxes.
What’s next, will conservatives
be more outraged at a comedian
making fun of Sarah Huckabee
Sanders’ eyeliner than the
actual president who disparages
woman on a daily basis?
Wait yeah.
I mean what’s next, will they be more
outraged at a black man peacefully
kneeling in protest than a group of armed
white vigilantes who engaged the
FBI in a 30 day standoff oh wait?
You get the picture.
One of those endorsing
kindergrenaders was former
republican congressman Joe
Walsh, who you may know him as
the guy who hates muslims as
much as he hates paying child support.
Well, unsurprisingly, he fell hook, line and
sinker, to the point where he’s shown
gleefully endorsing the made up program.
Specially selected children 
from 12-4 years old to pistols.
Only to blame his willful endorsement 
on his love for Israel.
But this is what conservatives are doing
in response to being exposed like this.
Blaming Cohen’s methods in
order to deflect from the terrifying
reality that Republicans know no 
boundaries when it comes to protecting the
toxic gun culture in this country.
These people make decisions
in this country.
These people.
"Well how about the magical uzicorn. 
Well this is one for the girls its a lovely
little unicorn that you can play with."
Nobody forced them to say these things.
Cohen did nothing but shine a magnificent
light on the GOP’s mentality and how
they’d rather see toddlers with
AR-15’s than discuss reasonable
gun control measures, because in
doing that it may poke a hole in
their NRA-filled pockets.
So to conclude, if you are more
concerned with Sarah Palin, the
person who claimed her proximity
to Russia meant she could keep a
closer eye on Putin, being
duped, than with the fact that
countless decision-makers in
this country were happy to
endorse arming toddlers, then
you are quite clearly are part
of the problem, and need to take
a long hard look in the mirror.
