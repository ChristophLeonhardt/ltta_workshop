1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,110
DONALD TRUMP'S PERSONAL
LAWYER IS IN A PARTICULARLY

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,880
INTERESTING POSITION RIGHT NOW.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,529
HE'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF

4
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:09,780
THE LEGAL DEFENSE FOR DONALD
TRUMP ON ISSUES HAVING TO DO

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,730
WITH RUSSIA, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT
TO KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT MARC

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,360
KASOWITZ DOESN'T ACTUALLY
HAVE A SECURITY CLEARANCE, WHICH

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,450
MEANS THAT MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS
WHICH COULD THEORETICALLY BE A

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,140
PART OF THIS CASE IF THIS CASE
DEVELOPS, THE LEAD LAWYER WON'T

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,280
EVEN BE ABLE TO LOOK AT BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ACTUAL

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,020
ABILITY TO DO SO LEGALLY.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,740
WE CAN
SPECULATE ABOUT WHY THAT MIGHT

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,170
BE, THERE ARE REPORTS ABOUT
POSSIBLE CONCERNS ABOUT

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,350
ALCOHOLISM, WHICH OF COURSE HE
AND HIS REPRESENTATIVES DISAGREE

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,589
STRONGLY WITH, BUT THAT STORY IS
OUT THERE, AND APPARENTLY IN

15
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:45,050
RESPONSE TO THE STORY WE HAVE AN
EMAIL EXCHANGE INVOLVING MARC

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,159
KASOWITZ THAT REALLY GETS TO
THE CORE OF WHO HE IS.

17
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,159
THIS IS

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,379
THE LAWYER FOR OUR PRESIDENT.

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,239
A
STRANGER WHO HAS NOT BEEN

20
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:03,461
IDENTIFIED EMAILS MARC KASOWITZ
LAW FIRM AND SAYS THIS, I

21
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:06,910
BELIEVE IT IS IN YOUR INTEREST
AND YOUR FIRMS INTEREST TO

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,360
RESIGN FROM YOUR POSITION
ADVISING THE PRESIDENT IN

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,320
PENDING FEDERAL LEGAL MATTERS.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,310
NO GOOD CAN COME FROM THIS AND

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,760
YOUR NAME MAY TURN OUT TO BE A
DISPARAGING HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,650
TO THE PRESIDENCY OF DJT.

27
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:27,420
WHICH
TO ME SOUNDS A SUPPORTER.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
AND

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,660
MARC KASOWITZ SENDS OUT
STANDARD LEGAL BOILERPLATE --

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,980
FUCK YOU.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:44,990
BUT TO BE FAIR, HE PUT
THE ASTERISK IN THAT EMAIL, AND

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,990
I APPRECIATE, THAT'S FUNNY.

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,870
THAN
12 MINUTES GOES BY, AND HE'S

34
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,360
LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,570
THAT'S NOT
ENOUGH, I'VE GOT TO REACH OUT TO

36
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,660
THIS TOTAL STRANGER ON THE
INTERNET MORE.

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
YOU DON'T KNOW

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,340
ME, BUT I WILL KNOW YOU.

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,030
HOW
DARE YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL LIKE

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,030
THAT?

41
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,240
I'M ON YOU NOW, YOU ARE
FUCKING WITH ME NOW -- THE

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,330
ASTERISK IS GONE NOW, LET'S SEE
WHO YOU ARE, WATCH YOUR BACK,

43
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,330
BITCH.

44
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,330
THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S
LAWYER.

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:13,069
YOU ARE A PIRATE, BITCH.

46
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:20,730
THE INTERNET STRANGER RESPONDS
WITH, THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND

47
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,190
REPLY, I MAY BE IN TOUCH AS
APPROPRIATE.

48
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,190
THAT'S CLEARLY A

49
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,270
TROLLING RESPONSE, LET'S BE
CLEAR.

50
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,620
HE'S SAYING I MAY BE IN TOUCH
AS APPROPRIATE, BECAUSE I'M

51
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,700
GOING TO REPORT YOU.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,709
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU, WATCH
YOUR BACK, THAT'S THREATENING.

53
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,270
KASOWITZ'S RESPONSE TO THAT
JUST TWO MINUTES LATER SAYING

54
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,770
CALL ME IF YOU WANT A
CONVERSATION, I WILL HAVE IT

55
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,770
WITH YOU.

56
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,100
YOU ARE SUCH A PIECE
OF SHIT.

57
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
CALL ME.

58
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
DON'T BE

59
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,740
AFRAID, YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

60
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
STAND
UP.

61
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
IF YOU DON'T CALL, YOU'RE

62
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,740
JUST AFRAID.

63
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
CALL ME.

64
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,470
HE REALLY
WANTS TO TALK.

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,840
HE WANTS TO TALK TO HIM WHILE
HE'S STANDING, CURIOUSLY.

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,551
STAND UP AND TALK TO ME.

67
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:13,230
FIVE
MINUTES GOES BY AND HE'S STILL

68
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,349
MAD, HE SAYS, I'M JEWISH.

69
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:19,590
I PRESUME YOU ARE TOO --
WE DON'T KNOW WHY, IT COULD BE

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,740
THE NAME, WE DON'T KNOW, IT
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S

71
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,490
ANY OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
PERSON.

72
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,190
IT HAS TO BE THE NAME.

73
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,520
STOP BEING AFRAID, CALL ME, OR
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER AND I WILL

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
CALL YOU.

75
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,069
I ALREADY KNOW WHERE
YOU LIVE, I'M ON YOU, YOU MIGHT

76
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,370
AS WELL CALL ME.

77
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,599
YOU WILL SEE
ME.

78
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,880
I PROMISE.

79
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
BRO.

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,540
BRO, THE GUY IS LIKE 70 YEARS
OLD.

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,970
HE ENDED WITH BRO.

82
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,290
IT WASN'T A
BRUH, FOR THE RECORD, IT WAS A

83
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,290
BRO.

84
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,160
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WILL
PAUSE AND REALIZE WE ARE IN

85
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,739
A SURREAL MOVIE.

86
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:05,210
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA'S
LAWYER SENT THIS NOTE TO ANYONE?

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,209
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
LARGEST SCANDAL IN OBAMA'S

88
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,080
PRESIDENCY BY AN ORDER OF
MAGNITUDE.

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
HERE

90
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,370
IS THE DIFFERENCE, WE NEVER KNEW
WHO OBAMA'S LAWYER WAS.

91
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:20,350
THERE WASN'T AS MUCH LEGAL
JEOPARDY GOING AROUND.

92
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,910
LOTS OF LAYERS TO THIS, WHICH
I'M AMUSED BY.

93
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,090
FIRST OFF, THE

94
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,940
FIRST EMAIL SENT BY THE GUY, THE
HEADLINE WAS, THE TITLE WAS,

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,380
RESIGN NOW.

96
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,550
SO I DIDN'T READ THE
TEXT OF THE EMAIL UNTIL LATER, I

97
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,730
JUST KNEW THAT IT SAID RESIGN
NOW.

98
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,370
I SAW KASOWITZ'S REPLY

99
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,451
FIRST, I WAS LIKE, IT SAYS
RESIGN NOW BUT HE MUST HAVE LIT

100
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,150
INTO HIM IN THE BODY OF THE
EMAIL.

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,540
IT TURNS OUT WHEN YOU

102
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,980
READ THE BODY OF THE EMAIL,
RESIGN NOW PLEASE, I THINK YOU

103
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,350
ARE HURTING THE PRESIDENT, IT'S
INCREDIBLY POLITE.

104
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,350
HE RECEIVES

105
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,880
THIS POLITE EMAIL WITH A BENIGN
RESIGN NOW.

106
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,740
ONLINE?

108
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,640
YOU WANT TO SEE VITRIOL?

109
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,250
RESIGN NOW TRIGGERED YOU?

110
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,080
THAT'S NICER THAN ANYTHING
ANYONE HAS SAID TO ME ONLINE.

111
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,410
THIS IS THE MOST SPECIAL
SNOWFLAKE I'VE EVER SEEN.

112
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,410
RESIGN

113
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,919
NOW -- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

114
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,160
HE SAID, I'M ON YOU.

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,030
WHAT THE

116
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,030
FUCK?

117
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,729
I THINK HE'S STANDING AS HE'S
TYPING ANGRILY.

118
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,950
AT THE SECOND PART THAT AMUSES
ME.

119
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,280
HE TYPES THE FUCK YOU, AND

120
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:36,650
THEN 12 MINUTES LATER, I'M GOING
TO GO AGAIN.

121
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,930
YOU BITCH!

122
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,570
LET'S

123
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,900
GET BACK TO THE THING THAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT, WHICH IS,

124
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,490
KASOWITZ DID NOT WANT SECURITY
CLEARANCE.

125
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,490
FIRST OF ALL IF YOU

126
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,330
ARE DONALD TRUMP AND YOUR LAWYER
WON'T REVIEW THE MATERIALS HE

127
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,490
NEEDS TO IN ORDER TO
DEFEND YOU, YOU'RE FIRED.

128
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,400
HE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY FIRED,
THAT'S INSANE.

129
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,850
HE SHOULD RESIGN NOW.

130
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,100
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

131
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,550
WHOA, WHOA, SORRY.

132
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,210
BUT TRUMP IS AN IDIOT SO HE
SAYS THE PROSECUTORS WILL

133
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,020
LOOK AT THE MATERIAL BUT MY
LAWYER WON'T.

134
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,490
HE HAS USED THIS GUY FOREVER.

135
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,360
AND THIS GUY HAS REPRESENTED
FIVE OUT OF THE SIX MAFIA

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,310
FAMILIES IN NEW YORK.

137
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,880
HENCE I'LL FIND YOU, I GOT
YOUR PHONE NUMBER, BRO.

138
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,760
MAYBE SIX OUT OF SEVEN NOW.

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,540
THEY SAID HIS EXCUSE FOR NOT
GETTING SECURITY CLEARANCE, HE

140
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,080
DIDN'T SAY THIS AND HE DENIES
IT, WAS THAT HE HAD PROBLEMS

141
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
WITH ALCOHOLISM.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,940
I DIDN'T
BELIEVE THAT, I THOUGHT LOOK,

143
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,850
DUDE, YOU HAVE DONE SOME SHADY
THINGS IN YOUR PAST, AND YOU

144
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,210
AREN'T GOING TO GET THAT
SECURITY CLEARANCE -- NUMBER ONE

145
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,510
YOU AREN'T GOING TO GET IT,
NUMBER TWO THE STUFF THEY FIND

146
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,630
OUT ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU GO TO GET
THAT CLEARANCE WILL GET YOU IN A

147
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,729
WORLD OF TROUBLE, THAT'S WHY HE
DIDN'T GET THE SECURITY

148
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:01,729
CLEARANCE.

149
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,979
EXCEPT HAVING SEEN
THESE EMAILS, I NOW THINK

150
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,400
THERE'S SOME CHANCE HE IS A
DRUNK.

151
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,740
THAT IS A DRUNK MOVE TO

152
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,790
DO, THREE OR FOUR TIMES IN A
ROW, WE ARE, BRO?

153
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,490
JUST BECAUSE I THINK
KASOWITZ IS ALREADY

154
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,600
STARTING TO EMAIL US,
THAT'S SPECULATION.

155
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,169
BACK OFF, BRO.

156
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,030
BY THE WAY I'M TRYING TO BE
NICE TO HIM, BECAUSE IF HE

157
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,340
IS AN ALCOHOLIC THAT'S NOT A
GOOD THING, BUT AT LEAST

158
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,690
THERE'S SOME EXCUSE.

159
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,490
HE DID APOLOGIZE THROUGH A
SPOKESPERSON, EVENTUALLY

160
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,789
HIMSELF, HE APOLOGIZED.

161
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,639
HE SAID THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
TIMES WHEN ONE WISHES HE

162
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,539
COULD REVERSE THE CLOCK,
BUT OF COURSE I CAN'T.

163
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,770
AND INTERESTINGLY THE DAY AFTER
THE EMAILS HE IS TYPING

164
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,770
MUCH BETTER.

165
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,770
INTERESTING.

166
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,240
BUT HE ALSO SAID THIS CAME AT
THE END OF A LONG DAY, IT WAS AT

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,639
10 PM AND THE DAY WASN'T EVEN
OVER YET.

168
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,660
SO I GUESS HE WAS TIRED.

169
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,810
MAY BE PEOPLE EMAIL THINGS WHEN
THEY ARE TIRED.

170
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,949
THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF TIRED
WHERE I FUCKING RIP INTO A

171
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:05,810
GUIDE WHEN I'M THE PRESIDENT'S
LAWYER AND SOMEONE SENDS ME

172
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,419
THE MOST BENIGN EMAIL.

173
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,900
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER.

174
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,350
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT, THOUGH.

175
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,539
WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT HIS
LAWYER IS THIS GUY?

176
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,110
COME ON, GUYS.

177
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,229
IF YOU CAN'T
TELL BY NOW WHO TRUMP IS, YOU

178
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,889
JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.

179
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,050
HE'S
BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH GUYS

180
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,509
LIKE THIS FOR DECADES AND
DECADES.

181
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,321
LIKE MICHAEL SAID, I

182
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,700
DIDN'T KNOW THE DEGREE TO WHICH
HE HAD REPRESENTED THOSE

183
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,830
FAMILIES, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT
TRUMP'S RECORD OF WORKING WITH

184
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,059
THOSE FAMILIES, THE CRIME
FAMILIES IN NEW YORK, IT'S

185
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,059
AMAZING.

186
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,630
HE LITERALLY REPRESENTED FIVE
OF THE SIX MAFIA FAMILIES

187
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,320
IN NEW YORK AT DIFFERENT TIMES.

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,709
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT
HE'S ALSO REPRESENTING TRUMP.

189
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,450
YOU WANT TO KEEP DENYING WHO HE
IS, THAT'S FINE.

190
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,450
AND I WILL END

191
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,570
ON A JESSE QUOTE FROM BREAKING
BAD.

192
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,580
TO BE FAIR TO TRUMP, WHEN

193
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,420
THE GOING GETS TOUGH, YOU DON'T
NEED A CRIMINAL LAWYER, YOU NEED

194
00:09:04,420 --> 00:00:00,000
A *CRIMINAL* LAWYER.
