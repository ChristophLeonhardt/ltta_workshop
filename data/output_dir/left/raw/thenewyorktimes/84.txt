1
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:03,984
“Testing, can you hear me?”

2
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:08,710
[playing piano]

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,322
“I don’t want nobody.”

4
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:20,040
The simple thing
about Aretha Franklin

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,787
is she was a great singer, a
singer who could do anything.

6
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:27,125
“The moment I wake up …”

7
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:30,300
She could do rhythm and blues,
she could do jazz,

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,920
she could do opera.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,470
She could do country, probably.

10
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:38,740
They started calling
her the Queen of Soul

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,740
in the ’60s, when she
was barely in her 20s,

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,967
and nobody argued.

13
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,800
People heard Aretha,
and they were inspired.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,370
And it was an inspiration that
she channeled from gospel,

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,410
into soul music,
into music that spoke

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,620
to people’s daily lives.

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,960
There were songs like “Think,”
which is a warning shot

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,340
across a relationship.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,440
It’s one of the few
songs she wrote,

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,780
and it’s one of her
strongest messages.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,900
She had 100 songs in
the Billboard R&B charts

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,890
and 17 pop hit singles,
but what was more important

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,380
was the way she
freed other singers,

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,430
the way she showed
other singers

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,368
this is how a voice can fly.

26
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,670
You can hear Aretha Franklin
in Whitney Houston.

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,980
You can hear Aretha Franklin
in Chaka Khan.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,160
You can hear Aretha Franklin
in men, too, Luther Vandross.

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,310
I mean, you can hear
Aretha Franklin across R&B

30
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,960
and across American music.

31
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:36,520
She wasn’t always
in the charts.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,940
There were long stretches of
the late ’70s, the late ’80s,

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,290
when she couldn’t get a hit.

34
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,810
I think the people who were
giving her material often

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,365
let her down.

36
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:47,192
“What do you do if
you forget a lyric?”

37
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,335
“I keep stepping.”

38
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:49,424
[laughter]

39
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:51,145
“You keep moving fast?"

40
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:54,440
You see here at the end of her
career singing an Adele song …

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,990
and you think what if Aretha
had better songwriters

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,410
all the way
through her career?

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,430
She would have even more than
those 100 R&B singles.

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,690
“Respect” was first
recorded by Otis Redding,

45
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,030
and for Otis Redding,
it was, “Come on, when

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,729
I get home, baby, you know,
be nice to me, I worked.”

47
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,370
When Aretha gets it as a
woman and turns it around,

48
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,795
“R-E-S-P-E-C-T.”

49
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:16,250
It’s about much
more than that.

50
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,420
It’s about respect
for her as a woman,

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,510
it’s about respect
for her as a person.

52
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,080
It’s about respect for her as
a breadwinner in this song.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,530
But it’s also about

54
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,800
sexual respect and
physical respect —

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
it’s everything.

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,100
“Anywhere I’ve gone in the
world, people love that song” —

57
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,380
“They do” —

58
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,590
“Did you have any idea when
you recorded ‘Respect’ that it

59
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,065
was going to be what it was?”

60
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,590
“No, I really did not.

61
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,480
I did not have any idea
that the civil rights movement

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,420
would adopt
that as its mantra.”

63
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,874
“My country, ’tis of thee …”

64
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,290
Her father had been involved
in the civil rights struggle.

65
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,420
She was close to
Martin Luther King.

66
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,610
She was involved
back in the ’60s.

67
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,490
To see America’s first
African-American president

68
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,220
be inaugurated, this was a
culmination of something,

69
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,498
and you had to have
Aretha Franklin there.

70
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:09,960
[applause]

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,379
“All right, thank you.

72
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,824
Good evening, how’s
everybody tonight?

73
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,780
Feel good?

74
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,660
Looking out on
the morning rain ...”

75
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,090
Aretha Franklin was
the Queen of Soul,

76
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,680
gospel music applied
to secular topics.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,720
And that meant putting all
of the airborne improvisation

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,230
of gospel into songs about
fighting with your guy,

79
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,560
and bringing that spirit,
channeling that ecstatic

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,697
spirit into really
down-to-Earth situations.”

81
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,290
“Gospel goes with
me wherever I go.

82
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,870
Gospel is a constant with me.”

83
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,620
“Amazing Grace” is
a gospel standard.

84
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,080
Everybody who sings gospel
music knows “Amazing Grace.”

85
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,470
It’s a beautiful song.

86
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,650
And when you hear
Aretha Franklin sing that song,

87
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,482
it’s just transcendent.

88
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:18,357
“Amazing grace, how sweet …”

89
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:19,940
There was always
that feeling that she

90
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,856
was channeling some
higher power into whatever

91
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:22,920
she was singing.

92
00:04:23,260 --> 00:00:00,000
“... the sound.”
