when it comes to the issue of repealing the Affordable Care Act oftentimes a lot of the news is targeted toward Republican members of Congress or Donald Trump but the managing editor of The Young Turks Jonathan Larson did some digging and found out that a bipartisan congressional group known as the problem solvers caucus is working together to repeal a pretty important part of the Affordable Care Act that was supposed to generate twenty nine billion dollars in revenue over ten years now it's specifically in regard to the medical device tax and the medical device tax was a 2.5 percent tax that was implemented on the sale of medical devices and of course those working in the medical device industry absolutely hated it so what did they do they got their money together and went after both Democratic and Republican members of Congress to try to get them to repeal that portion of the Affordable Care Act now the 40 or so House members who form the problem-solvers caucus earlier this year include a roughly equal number of Democrats and Republicans they unveiled a health care reform plan including permanent the permanent repeal of a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices that was temporarily suspended under Obama but is set to resume on January 1st so January 1st is quickly approaching they're realizing that the suspension is about to become undone and so they're worried about it and so they start spending even more money and they're specifically targeting those who are part of this bipartisan congressional group now members of the problem-solvers caucus on average receive ten thousand fifty one dollars during the campaign cycle for the 2016 elections as opposed to non-members of the caucus who averaged five thousand seven hundred forty nine the numbers do not include members first elected in 2016 for whom complete data is not yet available so just to give you a specific example there's the co-chair of this bipartisan group Tom Reed who was a Republican from New York he received a total of twenty five thousand six hundred fifty from the industry during the 2016 cycle now I want to focus one specific corporation that makes medical devices it's known as Stryker now the Stryker CEO Kevin Lobo has appeared on national television calling the tax a killer of jobs and innovation but a TYT report found that strikers own financial documents suggest the company enjoyed considerable growth and financial success while the tax was in place after the tax was suspended Stryker announced it would expand one Michigan's facility and laid off 50 workers in the process now I love this report I think Larson is a really good job digging in and figuring out what's going on let's hear from Jonathan Larson he'll give us a little more context into this Stryker story strikers claims about the jobs impact of the medical device tax began to shift and even contradict themselves even before the tax took effect on November 10th 2011 they issued a press release this was one year before the tax was even going to go into effect the press release said that Stryker was going to layoff 5% of its global workforce they had about 22,000 employees at the time worldwide so they were going to layoff 5% of their workforce that was according to their November 10th 2011 press release the same day however they submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission about that planned layoffs and the SEC as you may know has very strict requirements about the veracity of the statements that you make to them and here's what they said about those layoffs in that SEC filing they said quote these actions are being initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources following recent acquisitions to allow for continued investment in strategic areas in an ongoing challenging economic environment and market slowdown in elective procedures nowhere in the filing do they mention Obamacare or the medical device tax so they were gonna lay off people before this tax was even implemented and then when the tax was implemented they're like look at what happened this tax we got to fire these people we got to lay them off yeah so there's two parts of this story that I think John did a great job by with and thank you for helping us Hyrum one is the I you're welcome them one is how much campaign donations they take conveniently the guys who are fighting to for the on behalf of these companies take twice as much as people who are on the other side I know the people who believe that money in politics is awesome we'll sit that's just a wild coincidence total quizzes and they and the chair of this problem-solvers caucus takes approximately five times as much to another wild coincidence so the second part of the story is gentleman does a great job and you should read and we'll have the link down below and he's done a story on this before about what the companies say so what he does is he'll show them on TV going oh my god this tax is gonna cost us so much jobs it's a job killer and then he'll show you that they bragged about how many jobs they created while the tax was in place and then he'll reversing this because this tax actually got pause under Obama so they if they they stopped doing the tax and they're like great this will allow us to create more jobs and as you see and he's got a documented one after another and the time and it's amazing actually at the time they said oh great this will lead to more jobs they fire people right right and it's the money that they save from repealing the tax never goes toward hiring more people in fact he has shown in case after case that what usually happens is the executives of the given corporation will take the the money that they've saved from taxes and then buy shares of their own company to increase the stock value so it's it's about hoarding the money for themselves they don't create more jobs in fact it usually leads to the opposite outcome yeah and let me talk about the opposite outcome because the money when they do the stock buybacks mainly goes to the executives okay so that's the hoarding but actually the other stuff is worse because then they'll will say again in their SEC filings where they're not allowed to lie on TV they can lie all day long and on CNBC Fox's they're not gonna get challenged on those in fact they're not a chance on almost anywhere on cable news in there SEC filings they'll say now we're going to use the money to consolidate to do mergers and acquisitions and so and to auth and to build more offshore that's right so when you did that means they're offshoring your jobs and during mergers and acquisitions they switch to companies together one company said oh we created a hundred jobs you know why they bought another company so they didn't create the jobs those hundred jobs came from the other company in fact they'd laid off a hundred people from the company they acquired so Jonathan is exposing all those lines so this whole mythology of don't worry give to corporations tax cuts and out of the goodness of their heart and because of economic forces they'll create more jobs it's just not true and by the way where there's one other person culpable here and that's Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer has NGO dynamics a medical device maker headquartered in upstate New York and a lot of these legislators will use this as an excuse and someone will earnestly believe it well that's in my state that's in my district right also they give me a lot of money that part they leave out okay and the fact that they're in their state leads them to have more incentive to donate to their local senator and so Schumer was a lot of the guys who were saying all medical device tax now on that one I agree with the Republicans in Mitch McConnell of course to his advantage but not necessarily to the company's advantage and that problem solvers caucus with the Republicans Democrats working together only problems they're solving is for their donors no no I have to I have to elaborate a little more on what Schumer did because it was so incredibly shady and and I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I guess I'm also still a little naive so in September of 2016 appearing alongside future problem solvers member solvers member representative John Catco a New York medical device maker Welch Allyn Schumer said that suspending the tax played a pivotal role in the company's creation of 100 new jobs but that's actually not what happened in fact the announcement came one year after the company's new owner laid off a hundred workers as part of its acquisition of Welch Allyn well at the time that's what's so great about Jonathan's reporting - is he shows you the timing of when they said these things and when they happen every so but in that November 10th thing at the very beginning most most in a most pronounced way but yeah this is what politicians do and this is that's like 101 go back to when they did hire doesn't matter that all those people have been let go since the acquisition which I probably helped to facilitate in some way but and I don't know in that case I'm just I'm speaking tongue-in-cheek but but yeah that's that's how they operate so when you go and you do this get this kind of reporting and this kind of reporting points this stuff out it's really important to read this and you'll say yeah and understand that the things that you see on TV are talking points it just because you saw it on TV doesn't mean that they're verified or that anybody actually checked it to check those facts and when you go to check the facts you realize that a lot of it is propaganda and it and the television companies which take a ton of money from health care companies in advertising are happy to push that propaganda the politicians get a ton of money from donations from those same companies or help happy to push that propaganda but the minute you scratch the surface a little bit you realize how false it is and and that's exactly what we're trying to expose here on The Young Turks support independent media come join us the Young Turks TYT Network dot-com / join
