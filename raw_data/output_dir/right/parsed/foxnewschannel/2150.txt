AND HE TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT.
NBC ISSUED A CORRECTION SAYING
THAT HE WAS SURVEILLED GOOD THE
MEANING AND THE DIFFERENCE OF
THAT AND A MOMENT.
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, MICHAEL
CAVUTO, AND JONATHAN TURLEY,
FIRST WE GO TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN
MANAGER CORY LEWANDOWSKI, NICE
TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE
SEEN A REAL SORT OF TACT, REAL
CHANGE IN HOW THEY ARE GOING
ABOUT THIS.
>> YES, I THINK THAT THAT IS
RIGHT.
WHAT YOU SEE IS MAYOR GIULIANI,
VERY WELL-KNOWN, WELL-RESPECTED,
FORMER PROSECUTOR UNDERSTANDS
WHAT THE MUELLER TEAM IS TRYING
TO DO AND WHAT HE IS OUT LYING
IS VERY CLEAR, THERE'S BEEN NO
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION
WHATSOEVER.
SO FOR THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE
INVESTIGATION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE LOOKING INTO WHETHER
RUSSIA COLLUDED WITH THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN TO IMPACT THE ELECTION,
THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED.
AND NOW IT HAS SPUN OFF IN A
SERIES OF DIFFERENT OTHER THINGS
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING INTO AND
WHAT THE MAYOR IS SAYING IS
LET'S END THIS WHERE WE ARE
GOING TO FIGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU
REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO.
>> Martha: WHAT YOU THINK RUDY
GIULIANI REALLY PICKED UP ON IN
THE MEETING WITH ROBERT MUELLER
WHEN HE TOOK OVER THE JOB AND
SAID, LET'S SIT DOWN AND TALK
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE PICKED UP
ON THAT TRIGGERED?
>> WELL, I DO NOT KNOW, BUT MY
GUESS WOULD BE THAT THE MAYOR
SAT DOWN WITH THE MUELLER PROBE
PEOPLE AND TO REALIZE THAT THEY
HAD NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF
COLLUSION, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING
AND EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN
SAYING FROM DAY ONE, THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.
IF THAT IS WHERE THE GOAL WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE WAS TO FIND ANY
POTENTIAL EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
RUSSIANS OR FOREIGN OFFICIALS,
NONE OF THAT EXISTS.
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT
THE MAYOR FOUND OUT DURING THAT
TIME WAS THAT IT DID NOT EXIST.
>> Martha: WE ARE ABOUT TO
TALK TO MICHAEL CAVUTO THAT SAYS
THAT HE WAS SHOCKED AT
EVERYTHING THAT THE MUELLER
TEAM, KNEW ABOUT EVERY INTRICACY
OF THIS CAMPAIGN.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I AM STILL
GOING BACK TO IS THE ISSUE OF
THE 49 QUESTIONS.
I WANT TO TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY
AT THIS PASSAGE FROM
"THE WASHINGTON POST" STORY.
IT SAYS IN THE WAKE OF THE TEST
MARCH 5TH MEETING, MUELLER'S
TEAM AGREED TO PROVIDE THE
PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS WITH MORE
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE
SUBJECT THAT THE PROSECUTORS
WANTED TO DISCUSS.
WITH THOSE DETAILS IN HAND,
TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW
COMPILED A LIST OF 49 QUESTIONS
THAT THE TEAM BELIEVE THE
PRESIDENT WOULD BE ASKED.
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE 49
QUESTIONS DID NOT COME FROM
MUELLER SIDE, THEY CAME FROM JAY
SEKULOW.
DO YOU KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE?
>> I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS TRUE,
BUT WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS HOW
ALL OF THIS INFORMATION GETS
PLAYED OUT IN THE MEDIA EVERY
DAY.
LOOK, IT IS REALLY ASTONISHING,
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SERIES
OF PROFESSIONALS HAVING
COMMUNICATIONS BACK AND FORTH
ABOUT IF THE PRESIDENT IS GOING
TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE AN
INTERVIEW, WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE
CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE,
INTERROGATORY, QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERED, OR SOMETHING ELSE?
WE SEE ALL OF THIS IN THE NEWS
EVERY DAY.
MAYBE THAT IS A CREDIT TO SOME
OF THE MEDIA AGENCY IS PAID BY
IT TO ME IT IS MORE DISTURBING
OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS
GETTING OUT OF BEING LEAKED ALL
OVER THE PLACE.
>> Martha: THERE IS A LOT OF
IT, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK OF $130,000, HE SAID THAT
