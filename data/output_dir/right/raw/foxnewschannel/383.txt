A COVER-UP.

121

CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION?

WE DON'T HAVE A LOCATION TO

00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,325
INVESTIGATE, NO DATE TO

00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:02,992
INVESTIGATE.

158
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,727
THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,

159
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:05,495
THERE IS NO FORENSIC EVIDENCE.

160
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:07,797

00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,633
EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,541
THE ONE I WITNESS THAT SHE

167
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:20,143
LISTED, TOTALLY REFUTED HER

168
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:20,476
CLAIMS.

169
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:23,179
EVEN LONGTIME FRIEND HAD NO IDEA

170
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,148
WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

171
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:25,949
THEY'LL REFUTED HER CLAIMS UNDER

172
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,551
PENALTY OF PERJURY.

173
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:28,952
NOW TWICE.

THE OTHER ALLEGATIONS AGAINST

175

KAVANAUGH, THEY ARE EVEN MORE

176
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,923
SHAKY.

177
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:34,958
THE SECOND ACCUSER MAKING

178

DECADES-OLD CLAIMS THAT

179
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,926
KAVANAUGH HAD EXPOSED HIMSELF AS

180
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,729
A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE AT A

181
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,129
PARTY.

182
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,931
SHE WASN'T EVEN SURE THAT

183
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,466
KAVANAUGH WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

184
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,100
EVEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

185
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,235
WOULDN'T PUBLISH HER CLAIMS, AND

186
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:48,037
THEY SEARCHED FAR AND WIDE FOR

187
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:48,805
EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE HER

188
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,105
STORY.

189
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,107
THEY FOUND NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT

190
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,776
SHE HAD BEEN MAKING CALLS TO

191
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,179
OTHER YO CLASSMATES AT THE TIME

192
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,147
SAYING, I'M NOT SURE IT IS HIM,

193
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:58,615
DO YOU REMEMBER?

194
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:04,587
THE THIRD ACCUSER, SYSTEMATIC,

195
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:05,755
DRUGGING, GANG RAPE ALLEGATION

196
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:06,823
AGAINST TEENAGE GIRLS GET HER

197
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,257
STORY HAS IT CHANGED MANY TIMES

198
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:09,292
IN ABOUT A WEEK.

199
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,561
SHE IS FACING SERIOUSLY

200
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:14,130
CREDIBILITY ISSUES.

201
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,398
OF COURSE, REPRESENTED BY

202
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,133
MICHAEL AVENATTI, LAWYER OF THE

203
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:17,967
YEAR.

204
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,136
NONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS HAVE

205
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,538
DATES, LOCATIONS, WITNESSES,

206
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:23,940
EVIDENCE, CORROBORATION, OF ANY

207
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:26,943
KIND, OF ANY OF THESE CLAIMS.

208
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:27,744
SO DO DEMOCRATS REALLY EXPECT TO

209
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:31,347
BE FBI TO MAGICALLY FIND

210
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:32,048
DECADES-OLD EVIDENCE PROVING

211
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:36,019
THAT KAVANAUGH WAS AN EVIL

212
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,453
PREDATOR, SYSTEMIC GAME RANK IS,

213
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:41,124
SOMEBODY THAT DRUGGED

214
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,924
TEENAGE GIRLS.

215
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:43,159
THEY REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE

216
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,727
AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD SUSPEND

217
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:45,528
ALL DECENCY AND COMMON SENSE AND

218
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,829
A BELIEF THAT A MAN WITH AN

219
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,831
IMPECCABLE 40 YEAR TRACK RECORD

220
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:51,734
WAS REALLY SECRETLY A MONSTER IN

221
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,269
HIS YOUTH AND DID THIS ALMOST ON

222
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,871
A WEEKLY BASIS?

223
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,574
IN REALITY, THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN

224
00:06:58,575 --> 00:06:59,942
ABOUT POLITICS AND POWER.

225
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:00,410
A DELAY TACTIC.

226
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,546
A TRANSPARENT ATTEMPT TO

227
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,748
LITERALLY RUIN A MAN'S LIFE,

228
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:06,549
DESTROY HIS FAMILY.

229
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,084
BECAUSE THEY LOST AN ELECTION

230
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:09,752
AND THEY WANT THE POWER.

231
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,354
THIS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL

232
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,155
DISGRACE.

233
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:15,158
IN SOME CASES, THESE POLITICAL

234
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:16,526
TACTICS WORKED.

235
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:17,360
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM

236
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,327
NORTH DAKOTA, HEIDI HEITKAMP, BY

237
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:19,595
THE WAY, NOW DOWN 11 IN THE

238
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:22,331
LATEST POLL, CAME TO BE AN

239
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:23,466
INDEPENDENT VOICE FOR THE PEOPLE

240
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:23,933
OF NORTH DAKOTA.

241
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,736
TONIGHT, WE KNOW SHE IS NOTHING

242
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,503
MORE THAN A SHILL FOR

243
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,505
CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE DEMOCRATIC

244
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:30,239
PARTY.

245
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,641
SHE ASSUMED SHE IS NOT GETTING

246
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:34,777
REELECTED, SO SHE IS TRASHING

247
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,746
THE WILL OF HER OWN CONSTITUENTS

248
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,381
IN VOTING "NO."

249
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:39,949
YOU HAVE JOHN DONNELLY, OF

250
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,953
INDIANA, ALSO A "NO" VOTE.

251
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,688
INDIANA VOTERS, YOU CAN SEND HIM

252
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,391
A MESSAGE AND GET OUT AND VOTE.

253
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:52,128
NOW WE ARE SEEING THE DEMOCRATIC

254
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,229
PARTY -- LITERALLY, THEIR

255
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,564
PLAYBOOK ROLL OUT IN FULL FORCE.

256
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:55,498
EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE

257
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:57,600
CHRONICLED ON A REGULAR BASIS ON

258
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,168
THE SHOW, WE NOW BEGIN OUR 23RD

259
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,804
YEAR ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL, 30

260
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,306
IN RADIO.

261
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:05,675
A BIG CRESCENDO INTO ONE OF THE

262
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:08,945
MOST DESPICABLE DISPLAYS IN

263
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,512
ANYTHING WE HAVE OTHER

264
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:09,946
WITNESSED.

265
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,981
I WARNED YOU THEY ARE GOING TO

266
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:12,949
TRY TO THWART KAVANAUGH OR

267
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,351
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT PICKED AND

268
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:17,053
BRING BACK THE CLARA THOMAS

269
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:17,386
TACTICS.

270
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:20,857
THE SMEAR MACHINE ON THE LEFT IS

271
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:25,528
IN FULL GEAR.

272
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:26,929
SOME ARE CLAIMING THE

273
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,630
ALLEGATIONS DIDN'T WORK, LET'S

274
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,932
GO AFTER JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S

275
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:30,333
TEMPERAMENT.

276
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,935
THAT MIGHT BE DISQUALIFIED.

277
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:33,636
SAYING HE WAS JUST TOO

278
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,804
AGGRESSIVE WHEN DEFENDING

279
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,307
HIMSELF AGAINST FALSE

280
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:43,279
ALLEGATIONS OF DRUGGING AND GANG

281
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,114
RAPING TEENAGE GIRLS.

282
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,115
ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION.

283
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:48,451
HOW WOULD YOU REACT IF YOU WERE

284
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:50,186
FALSELY ACCUSED OF RAPE?

285
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:54,056
OF DRUGGING TEENAGE GIRLS?

286
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,592
HAPPENED ON AN EVERY WEEKEND

287
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:58,261
BASIS.

288
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:01,964
GANG RAPING THEM, BOYS LINING UP

289
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,166
AND HE HALTED HOW WOULD YOU

290
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:03,733
REACT?

291
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,168
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE

292
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:05,535
REACTION?

293
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:06,969
HOW WOULD YOU REACT IF SENATORS

294
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,838
WERE ON NATIONAL TV CALLING YOU

295
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,873
EVIL, COMPARING YOU TO

296
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,375
BILL COSBY, SUGGESTING THAT YOU

297
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,242
ARE GUILTY OF SERIOUS CRIMES YOU

298
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:16,579
NEVER COMMITTED?

299
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,548
FAR LEFT RETIRED JUSTICE

300
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,282
JOHN PAUL STEVENS WEIGHING IN,

301
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,217
THIS SHOULD DISQUALIFY HIM FROM

302
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:22,718
BECOMING A JUSTICE.

303
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:25,021
THIS IS THE SAME RADICAL FORMER

304
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,688
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT

305
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:26,823
DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE

306
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:27,456
CONSTITUTION BEER HE ONCE

307
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:30,193
DEMANDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT BE

308
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:30,226
DEMANDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT BR

309
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:30,259
DEMANDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT BP

310
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,293
DEMANDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT BA

00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:30,326
DEMANDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT BE

312
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,327
DEMANDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT B.

313
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,563
WROTE THAT THE ELECTION OF

314
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,230
GEORGE W. BUSH VIOLATED OUR

315
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,232
CONSTITUTION PEER JUST MOMENTS

316
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,267
AGO, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IN AN

317
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,435
OP-ED JUST

318
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:40,837
RELEASED WITH

319
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:41,537
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," HE

320
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,906
ELOQUENTLY DEFENDED HIMSELF ON

321
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,341
THE EVE OF WHAT WILL BE A

322
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:45,908
HISTORIC VOTE.

323
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,777
THIS IS A TIPPING POINT FOR THIS

324
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:48,978
COUNTRY.

325
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,346
HE TALKED ABOUT THESE RIDICULOUS

326
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:51,747
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WROTE,

327
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,115
"AFTER ALL THOSE MEETINGS AND

328
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,117
AFTER MY INITIAL HEARING

329
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:57,720
CONCLUDED, I WAS SUBJECTED TO

330
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,921
WRONGFUL, SOMETIMES VICIOUS,

331
00:09:58,922 --> 00:09:59,322
ALLEGATIONS.

332
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,157
MY TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL AND

333
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,792
COLLEGE, MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO,

334
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,328
HAS BEEN RIDICULOUSLY DISTORTED.

335
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:07,196
MY WIFE, MY DAUGHTERS, HAVE

336
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:10,533
FACED A VILE VIOLENT THREATS.

337
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,134
AGAINST THAT BACKDROP, I

338
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:12,835
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE JUDICIARY

339
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,537
COMMITTEE LAST THURSDAY TO

340
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:17,940
DEFEND MY FAMILY, MY GOOD NAME,

341
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:20,643
MY LIFETIME A PUBLIC SERVICE, MY

342
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:21,510
HEARING TESTIMONY WAS FORCEFUL

343
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,912
AND PASSIONATE.

344
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,981
THAT IS BECAUSE I FORCEFULLY AND

345
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:25,581
PASSIONATELY DENIED THE

346
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,718
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ME.

347
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,152
HE CONTINUED, I WAS VERY

348
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:30,753
EMOTIONAL LAST THURSDAY.

349
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,922
MORE SO THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN.

350
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,656
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL

351
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,124
AT TIMES.

352
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,692
I KNOW THAT MY TONE WAS SHARP, I

353
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:38,127
SAID A FEW THINGS I SHOULD NOT

354
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:38,928
HAVE SAID.

355
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,763
HE DID APOLOGIZE ONCE IN THE

356
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:41,264
HEARINGS.

357
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,299
I HOPE THAT EVERYONE CAN

358
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,735
UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS THERE AS A

359
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:48,404
SON, A HUSBAND, A DAD, AND I

360
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:51,140
TESTIFIED WITH FIVE PEOPLE

361
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,341
FOREMOST IN MY MIND.

362
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:55,144
MY MOM, MY DAD, MY WIFE, AND

363
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:58,347
MOST OF ALL, MY TWO DAUGHTERS.

364
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,116
SADLY, THIS KIND OF COMMON SENSE

365
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,051
AND LOGIC AND DECENCY FROM JUDGE

366
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,185
KAVANAUGH, IT MEANS NOTHING TO

367
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:05,521
THE LEFT.

368
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:06,322
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND?

369
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,724
BY THE WAY, IT MEANS NOTHING TO

370
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:09,892
THEIR COHORTS, THEIR FRIENDS, IN

371
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:11,661
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

372
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:14,730
YOU OF ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE

373
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:15,665
LEFT WHINING, CRYING,

374
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,135
COMPLAINING, THOSE THAT BELIEVE

375
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:19,902
THAT GUILT BY ACCUSATION -- JUST

376
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:22,738
DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST TODAY.

THESE PEOPLE ON THE JUDICIARY

380
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,912
COMMITTEE, THE SNOWFLAKES ON THE

381
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,213
FLOOR OF THE SENATE BEING TAKEN

382
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:33,015

PROTESTED BILL CLINTON LIKE

384
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:34,951
THIS?

385
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:36,052
DID THEY EVER STAND UP FOR

386
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,353
JUANITA BROADDRICK, KATHLEEN

387
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:39,355
WILLEY, PAULA JONES?

388
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:40,323
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, DIANNE

389
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,192
FEINSTEIN, WHO RECOMMENDED DEBRA

390
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,695
KATZ, DEBRA KATZ DID NOT BELIEVE

391
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:46,162
IN PAULA JONES.

392
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,798
IT WAS ONLY TEN OR 12:     12 MI

393
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:48,831
IT WAS ONLY TEN OR 12:     12 MU

394
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:48,864
IT WAS ONLY TEN OR 12:     12 ME

395
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:51,534
IT WAS ONLY TEN OR 12:     12 M.

396
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:52,735
FEIGNED, SELECTIVE MORAL OUTRAGE

397
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:55,137
HERE TODAY YOU ARE FAR LEFT

398
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,105
PROTESTERS ERUPTING ALL OVER

399
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:56,539
CAPITOL HILL.

400
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,907
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, EMOTIONS

401
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:58,407
WERE RUNNING HIGH.

402
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,344
LOGIC WAS RUNNING VERY LOW.

403
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,378
EVEN SENT OUR OWN CHRIS JENKINS

404
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,713
TO THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THIS IN

405
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:04,380
THE MIDDLE OF THE MOM COME

406
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:07,817
ASKING THESE PEOPLE WHAT THEY

407
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:09,919
THOUGHT ABOUT DUE PROCESS,

408
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,587
THE PRESUMPTION OF IMMINENT

409
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:12,621
SENSE, THE RULE OF LAW.

410
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:14,390
THE ANSWERS MOST ON YOU, TAKE A

411
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:14,690
LOOK.

412
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,760
>> THERE IS NO RESUMPTION OF

413
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,795
INNOCENCE IN A JOB INTERVIEW.

414
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:22,198
>> DO YOU BELIEVE HE WAS GIVEN A

415
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,134
FAIR CHANCE IN HIS CONFIRMATION.

416
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,535
>> A FAIR CHANCE?

417
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:27,770
MISS AMANDA SITTING AMONG

418
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:28,504
FRIENDS OF HIS PEERS >> CLEARLY

419
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:31,507
THERE BEEN ENOUGH ALLEGATIONS

420
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,241
THAT WE KNOW THIS

421
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:33,909
JOB APPLICATION NEEDS TO BE

422
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,243
DENIED.

423
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:35,011
>> THE PUBLIC ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

424
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:37,113
SHOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT

425
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,582
WHAT THEY DESERVE, NOT THE

426
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,216
[BLEEP] RICH WHITE MAN WHO

427
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,320
DOESN'T GIVE A [BLEEP] ABOUT US.

428
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:44,987
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH MADE IT

429
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:46,922
PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE DOES NOT

430
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,357
HAVE THE JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT,

431
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,925
HE BELIEVES THE SUPREME COURT IS

432
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:50,626
JUST ONE MORE POLITICAL

433
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:50,993
FOOTHOLD.

434
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:51,894
THAT IS NOT WHAT THE

435
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,129
SUPREME COURT IS ABOUT, AND I

436
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,797
THINK IN THAT HEARING, JUDGE

437
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:58,334
KAVANAUGH DISQUALIFIED HIMSELF.

438
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,301
>> Sean: NOPE RESUMPTION OF

439
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:00,936
INNOCENCE, NO DUE PROCESS.

440
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,705
LET ME TELL YOU, THAT IS THE

441
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:04,840
CASE, THERE IS NO COUNTRY, THERE

442
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,741
IS NO CONSTITUTION.

443
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:08,110
IT IS SAD, IT IS SHOCKING, AND

444
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,345
IT IS FRANKLY BEYOND CHILLING.

445
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:10,112
COMING UP, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

446
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:13,716
A LOT MORE, INCLUDING HIS FULL

447
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:14,784
INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR ELIZABETH

448
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:15,951
WARREN PEER TODAY, SHE LED THIS

449
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:18,487
HORDE OF DEMONSTRATORS DEMANDING

450
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:24,427
THAT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE AND

451
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,961
NOMINATION

452
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:29,799
BE -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ALLS

453
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,832
BE -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ALLA

454
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,299
BE -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ALLE

455
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,434
BE -- REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ALL.

456
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,701
THERE HAS TO BE SUMP RESUMPTION

457
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:33,135
OF INNOCENCE.

458
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:33,869
THE ONLY GOOD NEWS TONIGHT IS

459
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,806
THE LEFT, THEY HAVE BEEN

460
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,474
OFFICIALLY EXPOSED TO THE

461
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,110
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

462
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,677
SEE THOSE PROTESTERS?

463
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,879
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RADICAL

464
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,149
LEFT DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

465
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,518
THE PARTY OF SMEARS, LIES,

466
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,152
CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS.

467
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:53,456
FAMILY BLUDGEONING WITH NO PLANS

468
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,790
TO OFFER THE HARDWORKING,

469
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,926

THAT IS NOT THE PEOPLE OF THIS

475
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:08,337
COUNTRY.

476
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,905
THAT IS ONE PARTY, THOUGH SADLY,

477
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:14,910
THAT HAS ABANDONED ANY SENSE OF

478
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,112
FUNDAMENTAL DECENCY, FAIRNESS,

479
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:17,113

DO YOU WANT THEM IN POWER AND 33

521
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:12,968
DAYS.

522
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:17,706
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE

523
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,408
CAUSING PANDEMONIUM IN THE

524
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,109
NATION'S CAPITAL BECAUSE THEIR

OKAY.

528
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:30,686
THAT DEFINING SOMEONE AS A

529
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:36,292
RAPIST, A GANG RAPIST IS OKAY?

00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:38,027
THOSE ARE THE TACTICS OF TODAY'S

531
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:38,694
RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

532
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,262
THIS IS WHY, FOR YEARS, I

533
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:41,897
POINTED THIS OUT ON THE SHOW.

534
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,199
THIS HAPPENS EVERY TWO GOING

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,101
FOUR YEARS, AND NOW WITH EVERY

536
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,903
SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENT.

537
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:48,504
NEARLY EVERYONE.

538
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,838
THEY DISSEMINATED SALACIOUS LIES

539
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,041
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP BEFORE AND

540
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,310
AFTER THE ELECTION.

541
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:56,812
THEY ADVANCED A BIZARRE

542
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,847
CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT ONE

543
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:02,952
CANDIDATE ACTUALLY PAID FOR.

544
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:07,489
HOOKERS URINATING EMBEDS.

545
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,824
THEY DO IT TO START UP A

546
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:12,127
WITCH HUNT INVESTIGATION AND

547
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:12,828
CONSPIRACY.

548
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:17,099
THEY CALL PEOPLE RACIST, SEXIST,

549
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,534
MISOGYNISTIC, XENA PHOBIC,

550
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,402

00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:23,072
THE AIR.

553
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,107
WE WANT CHILDREN TO DIE.

554
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,909
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO RAISE

555
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,643
MEDICARE 7% PER YEAR, YOU WANT

556
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,712
TO THROW YOUR OWN GRANDMOTHER

557
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:30,312
OFF THE CLIFF.

558
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,681
WE HEAR IT EVERY TWO AND FOUR

559
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:32,982
YEARS.

560
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,383
