3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,220
It's so cold :(

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,686
We've got a big
announcement for you today.

5
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:12,179
If you're a subscriber you've probably noticed that
we've been asking for your help a lot

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,600
more in the past year in the community
tab.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,870
Now we're going to make that

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,360
experiment bigger.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,420
Way bigger.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,600
Wo we're
starting this huge new show with YouTube Originals

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,380
where we'll look at some of
today's most important issues and we

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,020
want to start with your questions.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,220
What is the most important question in your

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,380
world that desperately needs to be
examined, answered, or explained in 2019?

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,210
It can be anything, from health and
science and money to tech, relationships

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,540
the government and beyond.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,600
Could we engineer a technological

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,140
solution for climate change?

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,550
Why are more
women all over the world giving birth by

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,360
c-section?

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,079
Why is it so important? Why
does it affect your daily life? We're

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,190
gonna choose 12 questions and if your
question is selected, you'll be invited

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,900
to be part of the show.

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,380
All you need to
do is send us a cell phone video like this.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,060

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,580
