1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,435
LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION AND

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,536
THAT MAY BE BROADER THAN JUST

3
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,006
THE CLINTON EMAILS.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:07,339
SANDRA?

5
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,874
>> Sandra: THANK YOU FOR YOUR

6
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:10,910
REPORTING ON THAT.

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,111
HERE IS LINDSEY GRAHAM, A MEMBER

8
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:12,711
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY

9
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:13,679
COMMITTEE WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN

10
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,414
AT THE CENTER OF GETTING TO THE

11
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,016
TRUTH OF ALL OF THIS.

12
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,452
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT.

13
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,186
THEY ARE CLEARLY NEW QUESTIONS,

14
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:24,023
I SUPPOSE IT'S FAIR TO SAY, OVER

15
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:27,293
JAMES COMEY'S HANDLING OF EVENTS

16
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,196
SURROUNDING THE 2016 ELECTION.

17
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,997
>> I THINK -- WE WILL SEE WHAT

18
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:34,433
THE REPORT SAYS BUT I THOUGHT

19
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:35,768
DIRECTOR COMEY WAS SORT OF

20
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,169
OUT-OF-CONTROL BOUNCING FROM ONE

21
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:37,670
IDEA TO THE NEXT.

22
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,507
I WILL HOPE THAT THE REPORT WILL

23
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:45,711
LOOK AT THE FISA WARRANT ABUSE.

24
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:49,181
I HOPE THEY WILL TELL US HOW IT

25
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:51,016
BEING WOUND UP BEING USED TO GET

26
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,219
A WARRANT ON AN AMERICAN

27
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,421
CITIZEN, IN THIS DOSSIER STILL

28
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,056
UNVERIFIED TO THIS DAY.

29
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,591
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVE

30
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:58,624
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVH

31
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:58,657
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVA

32
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,258
SPEAK     AND >> Sandra: WE HAVD

33
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:01,026
SO MUCH FROM JAMES COMEY, AS YOU

34
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:01,594
JUST REFERENCE.

35
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,863
HE WAS ON HIS BOOK TOUR AND

36
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:04,830
ACROSS VARIOUS NETWORKS AND

37
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,866
PUBLICATIONS, IT WAS HARD TO

38
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,299
MISS HIM.

39
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:08,934
WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF HIM AND

40
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:11,170
NOW TO LEARN THAT HE IS THE

41
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,172
FOCUS OF THIS IG INVESTIGATION,

42
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:17,776
WHAT SHOULD THAT TELL US?

43
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,411
>> WHILE I THINK THE IG HAS

44
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,547
LOOKED AT HIS LEADERSHIP MODEL

45
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:25,417
AND FOUND IT LACKING.

46
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,586
WE BELIEVE THERE WAS SOME

47
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,622
INTELLIGENCE COMPROMISING THE

48
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,389
ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH.

49
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:34,493
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE TWO

50
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,696
FBI -- PETER STROKE AND PAGE

51
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,832
PACE, THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF THE

52
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,634
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION.

53
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,636
IF YOU TRUST THESE TWO, YOU ARE

54
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,236
CRAZY.

55
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:45,538
LOOK AT THE EMAIL CHAIN BETWEEN

56
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,238
THEM.

57
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:47,006
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF

58
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,074
JUSTICE WAS IN THE TANK FOR

59
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:49,441
CLINTON.

60
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,777
THE FBI DID NOT DO A VERY

61
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,112
GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AT THE

62
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,648
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION.

63
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,851
IT WAS A SHAM INVESTIGATION.

64
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,085
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE

65
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,654
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THE

66
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,655
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS USING

67
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,456
MATERIAL PROVIDED TO THEM BY A

68
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:07,459
FOREIGN AGENT, A FORMER BRITISH

69
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,061
AGENT, PAID FOR BY THE

70
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:09,862
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

71
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:13,265
SO THERE IS A LOT TO LOOK AT

72
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:13,566
HERE.

73
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,869
>> THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN MEMO,

74
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:18,504
AND THE ANTICIPATION IS BUILDING

75
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,706
BY THE DAY TO FINALLY SEE THIS

76
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:21,640
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT.

77
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,946
WE HAVE SEEN, AND IN THIS CASE,

78
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,447
PERHAPS IT IS VERY CRITICAL OF

79
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:28,847
JAMES COMEY.

80
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,216
PERHAPS DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE IT.

81
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,017
THEY COULD DISCOUNT IT, WE HAVE

82
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:35,287
SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN THE PAST.

83
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,222
WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS

84
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,056
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT AS THE

85
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,691
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TOLD THAT IT

86
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,260
IS SO HIGHLY ANTICIPATED BY

87
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,661
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND BEYOND?

88
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,498
>> NUMBER ONE, IT'S NOT A

89
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:49,301
REPUBLICAN REPORT OR A DEMOCRAT

90
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,269
REPORT.

91
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,306
HE IS HIGHLY RESPECTED AND IS

92
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:57,243
VIEWED AS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.

93
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,279
AND TO CALL OUT ABUSES FOR THE

94
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,280
FBI, I THINK IT WILL HAVE

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,550
CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS

96
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,022
AND THE PERSON HE IS.

97
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,157
THE FBI AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE

98
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:16,629
CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION

99
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,229
ACTED OUT-OF-BOUNDS.

100
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,632
THERE IS A BREACH OF THE LAW

101
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,233
WHEN IT CAME TO MR. STEELE AND

102
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,836
HOW HE WAS USED AS A

103
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,771
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT.

104
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:26,839
MR. ORR, THE NUMBER FOUR IN

105
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:41,153
CHARGE OF THE G

106
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,693
CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THEE

CHARGE OF THE G       THAT, THET

112
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,727
OF BAD SITUATIONS HERE AND I

113
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:49,395
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SPECIAL

114
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,095
COUNSEL LOOK AT THIS NOT JUST

115
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:50,796
FROM AN INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW

116
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,530
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CRIMES WERE

117
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:51,897
COMMITTED.

118
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:52,598
>> Sandra: MEANWHILE YOU HAVE

119
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:53,198
BEEN A CRITIC OF ROBERT

120
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:53,832
ROSENSTEIN, OVERSEEING THE

121
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:54,533
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.

122
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,234
YOU HAVE SAID HE IS CONFLICTED

123
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:55,868
AND, THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.

124
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,535
HE WROTE A LETTER SAYING HE

125
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:57,236
NEEDS TO RECUSE HIMSELF.

126
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,070
HE RECEIVED A LETTER BACK AND

127
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,639
YOU ARE GOING TO SHARE WITH US

128
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,241
WHAT YOU HEARD BACK TONIGHT.

129
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,209
>> ONE, IT DIDN'T COME FROM HIM,

130
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,246
IT CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

131
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,548
SECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

132
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:10,449
JUSTICE, NOT FROM

133
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:10,916
MR. ROSENSTEIN.

134
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,118
HE IS A FINE MAN, IT'S NOT THAT

135
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,286
I DOUBT HIS CHARACTER OR

136
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:15,054
QUALIFICATIONS.

137
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,654
THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS, I BELIEVE

138
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:20,459
HE WILL BE A WITNESS IN ANY

139
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,026
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

140
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:27,099
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY MR.

141
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:27,499
MR. MOELLER.

142
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:31,737
HE'S THE ONE THAT WROTE THE MEMO

143
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,072
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP SUGGESTING

144
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,240
WHY MR. COMEY SHOULD BE FIRED.

145
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,609
HE'S ALSO IN THE FISA WARRANT

146
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:39,078
THAT WAS ISSUED BASED ON A

147
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,245
DOSSIER COMING FROM A FOREIGN

148
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:43,415
AGENT WHO WENT TO RUSSIA, PAID

149
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,018
FOR BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

150
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,386
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD LOOK

151
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,455
AT THAT ASPECT OF THIS CASE.

152
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,623
TO ME, HE SEEMS TO BE

153
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:52,024
CONFLICTED.

154
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:54,660
I DIDN'T GET A VERY GOOD ANSWER

155
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,296
AS TO WHY.

156
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,164
>> WHAT WAS IT?

157
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:02,434
>> IT WAS GOBBLEDYGOOK.

158
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:05,804
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MR. MULLEN

159
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:10,042
ROSENSTEIN IS NOT PART OF THE

160
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,643
WITNESS CHANGE.

161
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:11,944
CHAIN.

162
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,846
MAYBE I'M WRONG, BUT THE LETTER

163
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,247
DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION.

164
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,849
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON

165
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,017
THIS, I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT HE

166
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,052
CAN DO HIS JOB WITHOUT

167
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,653
INTERFERENCE BUT IT REALLY DOES

168
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,089
BOTHER ME THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN

169
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,792
HAS NOT APPOINTED A SPECIAL

170
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,229
COUNSEL LOOK AT THE DOJ AND FBI

171
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,030
ABUSES.

172
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,500
AND CAN HE OVERSEE THE MUELLER

173
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,434
INVESTIGATION GIVEN THE ROLE HE

174
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:35,834
PLAYED?

175
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,837
>> ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE

176
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,272
WITH THAT?

177
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,074
>> ABSOLUTELY.

178
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,643
>> Sandra: MEANWHILE, THE

179
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:45,477

TO BRING THE PRESIDENT.

183
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:52,117
HE SAID THIS.

184
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:52,451
LISTEN.

185
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,053
>> A GROUP OF 13 HIGHLY PARTISAN

MUELLER, EXCLUDING HIM --

MUELLER TEAM, EXCLUDING HIM,

189
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,762
TRYING TO GET HIM IN TROUBLE

190
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,165
WHEN HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING

191
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:06,465
WRONG.

192
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:11,036
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU THINK

193
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,440
OF THAT, SENATOR?

194
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,276
IT APPEARS THAT WE HAVE LOST THE

195
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,444
SENATOR.

196
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,178
THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES WITH LIVE

197
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,881
TV, WE WILL TRY TO GET HIM BACK

198
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,482
IF WE CAN.

199
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:28,086
OKAY, SENATOR, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

200
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,622
ALL RIGHT, THE BEAUTY AND JOY OF

201
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,123
LIVE TELEVISIONS.

202
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,791
>> IT WAS THE RUSSIANS, THEY ARE

203
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,693
TRYING TO KNOCK ME OFF THE AIR.

204
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,128
RUDY, ALL I CAN SAY IS HE'S

205
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,096
PITCHING FOR THE PRESIDENT AND

206
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,364
HE IS GOOD LAWYER.

207
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,632
LET'S SEE WHAT HE FINDS IS HIS

208
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:45,137
JOB TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE

209
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:45,537
LEGISLATION.

210
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,439
TIME WILL TELL AND WE WILL SEE

211
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,609
WHAT KIND OF REPORT THEY HAVE.

212
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:55,714
I SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE

213
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,951
PRESIDENT WAS INVOLVED WITH THE

214
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,318
RUSSIANS.

215
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:04,323
>> IS INTERESTING TO HEAR, THE

216
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,424
ATTORNEY TRYING TO FRAME THE

217
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:05,791
PRESIDENT.

218
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,626
AND I KNOW YOU ARE AT THE

219
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:08,227
WHITE HOUSE TODAY.

220
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,829
YOU MET WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND

221
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:11,830
TALKED ABOUT TRADE.

222
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,131
WHILE THAT WAS HAPPENING, I HAVE

223
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,435
TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE NEW

224
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,135
REPORTS OF AMERICAN DIPLOMATS.

225
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,837
WHILE YOU WERE IN THAT MEETING,

226
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:21,073
THESE REPORTS COMING OUT.

227
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,308
NEW DIPLOMATS FALLING ILL IN

228
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,844
CHINA AFTER HEARING ODD NOISES,

229
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:28,046
THEY ARE REPORTING.

230
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,047
THEY HAVE BEEN EVACUATED, THE

231
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,016
STATE APART MAKE OUT THEM OUT OF

232
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:31,650
THERE.

233
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,486
BUT WE SAW A SIMILAR EVENT IN

234
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,622
FLORIDA.

235
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,389
LET'S GET YOUR RESPONSE TONIGHT.

236
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,258
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S

237
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:39,958
HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD BUT

238
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:44,563
SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO HURT OUR

239
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:44,897
PEOPLE.

240
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,633
IN CUBA, I DON'T BELIEVE IT

241
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,500
HAPPENED WITHOUT THEIR

242
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,434
KNOWLEDGE.

243
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:50,102
SECRETARY POMPEO IS VERY

244
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,036
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND SO AM

245
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,871
I.

246
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:55,941
I'M VERY CONCERNED AND I'M IN

247
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,043
CHARGE OF THE OVERSIGHT OF OUR

248
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,044
STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY SERVE

249
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,979
OUR COUNTRY AND VERY DANGEROUS

250
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,247
PLACES LIKE THE MILITARY.

251
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,449
THIS MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT,

252
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,450
HERE'S MY TAKE AWAY.

253
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,486
PRESIDENT HAS A PLAN TO GET US

254
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,655
BETTER TRADE DEALS THROUGHOUT

255
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,089
THE WORLD INCLUDING OUR OWN

256
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:11,456
BACKYARD.

257
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,258
HE HAS A PLAN TO GET A BETTER

258
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:14,459
DEAL WITH CANADA AND MEXICO AND

259
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,663
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO

260
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,765
UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT'S ABILITY

261
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,066
TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER TRADE

262
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:21,466
DEAL.

263
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,969
SO I DON'T THINK NOW IS THE TIME

264
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:24,870
TO DO THAT.

265
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,538
THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING BACK

266
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:27,472
AGAINST CHINA, SOMEBODY SHOULD

267
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,274
HAVE DONE IT A LONG TIME AGO.

268
00:08:29,274 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE WAS A PLAN IN PLACE THAT
