1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,058
>> THE FACT IS SANCTUARY

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,060
COUNTIES ARE NOT MORE VIOLENT,

3
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:14,527
MORE DANGEROUS.

4
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:17,497
QUITE THE CONTRARY.

5
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:19,833
THE WALL IS A MONUMENT TO

6
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:20,500
STUPIDITY.

7
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,735
WHILE IT IS INTENDED TO THIS

8
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:23,069
COUNTRY.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,637
>> Shannon: CALIFORNIA'S FIRST

10
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:26,439
AND ONLY GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,174
TOOK PLACE TODAY.

12
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,076
REPUBLICAN JOHN COX GOING

13
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:30,743
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH DEMOCRATIC

14
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,112
DARLING GAVIN NEWSOM.

15
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:34,948
DID HE GET A FAIR SHAKE?

16
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:35,515
LET'S ASK HIM.

17
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:37,350
JOHN COX IS HERE.

18
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,053
WE HAVE INVITED GAVIN NEWSOM

19
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:41,721
NUMEROUS TIMES, HIS DEMOCRATIC

20
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:42,088
OPPONENT.

21
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,690
WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK.

22
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:45,692
JOHN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

23
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,627
HOW DID YOU FEEL THE DEBATE

24
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:47,927
WENT?

25
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:49,929
>> IT WAS CALLED A CONVERSATION

26
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,497
AND I CALLED IT THE

27
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,500
NONCONVERSATION CONVERSATION.

28
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,502
WE GOT ASKED A BUNCH OF

29
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:55,869
QUESTIONS.

30
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,637
WE OBVIOUSLY TALKED ABOUT

31
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,139
AFFORDABILITY AND THE COST OF

32
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,941
LIVING, THE COST OF HOUSING, THE

33
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:02,876
COST OF GASOLINE AND THE GAS

34
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:03,543
TAX.

35
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:05,512
WE HAD A WHOLE HUGE DISCUSSION

36
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,347
ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE AND GUNS,

37
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:08,314
NEITHER OF WHICH I AM RUNNING

38
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,916
ON.

39
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:11,551
NEITHER OF WHICH IS MUCH IN

40
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:12,118
CONTROVERSY.

41
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,053
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WATER WHICH

42
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:17,924
IS A HUGE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA.

43
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,893
MR. NEWSOM IS IN FAVOR OF

44
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:20,260
RATIONING.

45
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:22,061
THE LEGISLATURE JUST ENACTED

46
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:22,428
RATIONING.

47
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:23,963
OUR FARMERS OUT HERE, WE ARE THE

48
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,165
SALE OF ALL OF THE COUNTRY.

49
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,734
OUR FARMERS ARE BEING STARVED OF

50
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,768
WATER.

51
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,436
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT EDUCATION.

52
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:32,172
EDUCATION IS A KEY ISSUE BECAUSE

53
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:33,573
WE HAVE GONE FROM BEING ONE OF

54
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:36,075
THE TOP STATES IN THE NATION IN

55
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:39,179
EDUCATION TO WHERE WE ARE NOW

56
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,115
47TH IN PROVISION C.

57
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,516
MR. NEWSOM IS A WHOLLY-OWNED

58
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:44,250
SUBSIDIARY OF TEACHERS UNIONS

59
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,685
AND WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO

60
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,720
TALK ABOUT IT.

61
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:48,721
>> Shannon: "THE SAN FRANCISCO

62
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:50,023
CHRONICLE" SAID TIME AND AGAIN,

63
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:52,258
JOHN COX FOUND HIMSELF ON THE

64
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,361
DEFENSIVE WHEN NEWSOM CHALLENGE

65
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,497
CHALLENGED.

66
00:01:57,498 --> 00:01:59,332
COX EXHIBITED A BIT OF

67
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,533
FRUSTRATION WHEN NEWSOM BROUGHT

68
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,936
UP CONCEALED WEAPONS AND OTHER

69
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,637
GUN-CONTROL ISSUES.

70
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:08,541
THEIR HEADLINE WAS "GAVIN NEWSOM

71
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,943
THE CLEAR WINNER."

72
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,711
>> I TALKED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY.

73
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:12,912
THE REAL IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT

74
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,380
DO THE VOTERS CARE ABOUT?

75
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:17,116
WE HAVE VOTERS ALL ACROSS

76
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:17,850
CALIFORNIA WHO CAN'T AFFORD

77
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,920
RENT, CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR

78
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:21,721
GASOLINE.

79
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:22,889
THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOOD.

80
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,925
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE TWICE WHAT

81
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:27,360
TEXAS PAYS.

82
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,928
OUR SCHOOLS ARE AN ABSOLUTE

83
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:29,295
DISGRACE.

84
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,530
THEY ARE FAILING.

85
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:33,299
OUR ROADS ARE CONGESTED.

86
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,734
MEANWHILE, WE HAVE GAVIN NEWSOM

87
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,936
IN FAVOR OF A TRAIN THAT IS WAY

88
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,805
OVER BUDGET, WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE

89
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:40,340
AND IS SOAKING UP BILLIONS

90
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:42,709
OF DOLLARS THAT COULD BE SPENT

91
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:48,281
BUILDING ROADS AND OUTFITTING

92
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:48,781
OUR FIREFIGHTERS.

93
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,116
WE HAVE GOT A REAL DISGRACE OF

94
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:52,719
MANAGEMENT IN SACRAMENTO.

95
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,887
MR. NEWSOM WILL ONLY DOUBLE DOWN

96
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,723
ON TAXES AND A ROTTEN BUSINESS

97
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:57,156
ECONOMY.

98
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:58,925
HE WILL MAKE THIS WORSE THAN IT

99
00:02:58,926 --> 00:02:59,192
IS.

100
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,760
>> Shannon: WE HAVE DONE A LOT

101
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,695
OF STORIES OF THE TROUBLES

102
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:03,496
FACING CALIFORNIA.

103
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,798
POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS, ALL KINDS

104
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:06,499
OF THINGS.

105
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,900
CALIFORNIA VOTERS CONSISTENTLY

106
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,469
CONTINUE TO VOTE AND PRIMARILY

107
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,737
SEND DEMOCRATS TO SACRAMENTO AND

108
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,339
TO OVERSEE THINGS IN THE STATE

109
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,108
CAPITAL.

110
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:16,609
YOU HAVE AN UPHILL BATTLE.

111
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,078
>> IT'S GOING TO CHANGE.

112
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,513
YOU MENTIONED THE HOMELESSNESS.

113
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:23,082
I WAS IN SAN FRANCISCO TODAY AND

114
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,285
GAVIN NEWSOM WAS THE MAYOR OF

115
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:26,052
SAN FRANCISCO AND IT'S REALLY A

116
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,487
SAD SITUATION.

117
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:30,023
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES

118
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:31,524
OF THE WORLD.

119
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,126
NOW IT'S THE NATIONWIDE LEADER

120
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:34,227
IN PROPERTY CRIMES.

121
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:37,096
YOU CAN'T EVEN RIDE THE BART.

122
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:39,966
THE STREETS ARE FULL OF HUMAN

123
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:40,700
WASTE AND HYPODERMIC NEEDLES.

124
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:42,902
AND REALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST

125
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:46,105
LIVING ON THE STREETS STRUNG OUT

126
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:47,840
ON DRUGS AND MR. NEWSOM'S ANSWER

127
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,475
IS TO GIVE PEOPLE CLEAN NEEDLES

128
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:53,513
AND AN INJECTION CENTER.

129
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,415
I THINK WE NEED TO TREAT THESE

130
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,282
ILLNESSES.

131
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,817
WE NEED TO TREAT MENTAL ILLNESS

132
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:00,520
AND THE ABUSE OF DRUGS AND

133
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,120
ALCOHOL AND THAT'S THE

134
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,121
COMPASSIONATE THING TO DO.

135
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,757
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

136
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:05,491
REJECT GAVIN NEWSOM SO CALLED

137
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,328
SOLUTIONS THE HOMELESSNESS

138
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,095
PROBLEM.

139
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:09,696
THEY WANT A CHANGE IN

140
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:10,730
CALIFORNIA.

141
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:11,898
THEY WANT A STATE THEY CAN BE

142
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:12,799
PROUD OF AND I THINK THEY WILL

143
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,901
HAVE THAT STATE WHEN I'M THE

144
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,035
GOVERNOR.

145
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:16,736
>> Shannon: YOU HAVE DEFIED

146
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:20,540
EXPECTATIONS BY ENDING UP IN THE

147
00:04:20,541 --> 00:00:00,000
SO-CALLED JUNGLE PRIMARY.
