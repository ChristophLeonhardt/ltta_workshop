get ready for the ultimate definition of irony apparently one cannot screen a documentary in a Canadian library if it is about radical Islam and apparently one can also not screen a documentary about a documentary screening being quashed either oh boy just wait until you hear this one folks so last year Danish expatriate filmmaker Michael Hanson made a doc on radical Islam entitled killing Europe the documentary warns of the dangers of the islamification of Western Europe and it was set to be screened at an Ottawa Public Library now from what I can tell the doc appears to be factually bulletproof and is in no way slanderous or libelous or defamatory but today we are all about protecting certain people from hurt feelings and as such the truth is indeed the first casualty last November a cabal of individuals actually got together ranging from Ottawa city councilor Tim tyranny to the rank and file of an Tifa and of course the infamous Richard Worman a man who is sometimes an employee of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and sometimes just a citizen using the Interior Human Rights Commission to sense or anything that he doesn't agree with on an ideological basis he and no conflict of interest here when it comes to warm and wearing those two hats right so when the Ottawa library caved in to the bullies and denied a screening of killing Europe Hansen made a documentary about the assassination of his film entitled Oh Canada now I recently took in a screening of Oh Canada and folks if you care about the radical erosion of free speech in Canada this documentary is required viewing in the meantime here are a few excerpts for starters some media party journalists who in theory should be the strongest advocates of speech condemned the killing Europe documentary without actually viewing it and they even admitted to this fact check out Hansen's interview with Kieran dellamonte of Metro Ottawa did you actually sit down and watch the whole movie no this is just all I've seen the trailer it's all in the video and get this it turns out that even though the film was greenlit for screening based on a previewing by library staff and even the police it was cancelled nevertheless CEO of the library Danielle McDonald stated that she looked at the policies and procedures which include the police actually viewing it the staff viewing it it passed those tests but if it did not violate any hate speech laws why was the screening cancelled local councilman Tim Tierney explained there were some other hurdles that were there and we decided that the best decision was we aren't going to show the movie we're not about closing out people's views on things but this one doesn't pass the test well actually counselor you are indeed about closing people's views on things because the film did pass the hate speech test but the enemies of the doc wanted to ensure that it was not only banned in Ottawa but elsewhere too and if a screening were to go ahead there would be a price to pay potentially because certain vested interests such as the uber litigious mr. Worman would be watching and listening for any offensive opinions the existence of the Human Rights Commission and the grievance industry that has emerged behind it is being justified by the argument that Canadians are inherently racist based on this premise that is therefore not only justified but necessary to suppress free speech Canadians are constantly being bombarded with headlines and statistics reminding them of their bigotry and readiness to violently oppress defenseless minorities now allow me to cut to the chase Hansen made a doc about his killing Europe doc being banned in Ottawa the new doc is entitled old Canada and get this incredibly inexplicably and ironically Oh Canada has been given the boot too even though this dock is not about the islamification of Europe at the end of the day the problem with Canada today is that we have too many Tim tyrannies too many Richard wormans left us who are doing everything they can to take away our freedom of speech and we have too few Michal Hansen's free speech champions on a crusade to slay those dragons who had loved to curtail free speech especially if that free speech pertains to criticism of a certain protected class in Canada and the rest of the Western world for the rebel media I'm David the men's I'd Minzy hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
