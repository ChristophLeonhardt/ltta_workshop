the left is once again trying to sanitize and revise history but this time 57% of Americans disagree and are fighting back I'm one of them and I'm gonna tell you all about it this time progressives are attacking Christopher Columbus and Columbus Day which to me is ridiculous because when I was a kid I loved Columbus Day as did everybody else it gives you a three-day holiday nobody really thought about the history behind it kids loved it parents loved because they've got off work and they got a three-day holiday and everybody went about their lives not really overthinking this not thinking too much about it or being aggrieved but enter the modern day left they've got a grievance about everything if the wind blows in the wrong direction they're filing petitions wanting to ban air flow in Congress so it doesn't surprise me that the left is now on this mission to eradicate Columbus Day and also unsurprising and that is that they succeeded in Los Angeles that doesn't surprise anybody back in August the Los Angeles City Council decided to eradicate Columbus Day just maybe believe it didn't exist and they replaced it with indigenous peoples day in fact one local legislator called it restorative justice you you really can't make this stuff up I can write pretty creatively and I could never come up with some of the things liberal politicians say they are they're absolutely their gems they're precious but but this this is about a bigger war on our culture you know I often say on social media that we're in civil war 2.0 an ideological civil war and things like this really convinced me that we are because this war on Columbus Day has very little to do with Christopher Columbus and has everything to do with traditionalism values and Western European history this is about eradicating Western European aka white history now I like history whether it's good or bad I want to know all about bad history because we cannot become better as a society unless we learn from the things we did wrong hundreds if not thousands of years ago and history is a bloody thing the left has a problem grasping there they're just afraid to think about it because they're so soft but history is a bloody thing think about the things we learned as kids in school we learned about Wars and we learned about plagues and we learned about beheadings and we learned we learned about all these terribly tragic things that made us who we are as a global society America was built on blood and bullets it's who we are as a nation we came to be because of a revolution we can't sanitize that guys like Columbus or explorers they were going thousands of miles to places they knew nothing about encountering pretty brutal tribes of course warfare was going to ensue we can get into debates all day long about who was right and who was wrong justice debates sociological debates philosophical debates about who was right who was wrong were the indigenous people right defending their land where's Columbus right in the end because society never would have advanced it never would have been technological advancements and the growth of civilization had explorers like him not taken over some of these places conquered these places explored these places those are debate debates left for a longer form those are debates left for another forum but we can talk about how stupid it is to attack cultural institutions like Columbus Day and Americans are fighting back a recent poll showed that 57% of Americans 57 percent nearly 60 percent of Americans support leaving Columbus Day alone and just as it is and I can pretty much guarantee the reason is they want their three-day holiday and they don't want to go around sounding like a bunch of neurotic liberals saying things like happy indigenous peoples day driving away in their Prius with their coexist bumper sticker on the back because the progressives who do that look moronic it's affected its contrived and we know they don't really believe in it they just have this confusing desire to be a perpetually aggrieved class and this is creating some problems in places like New York City because you have far left guys like Mayor Bill de Blasio who are these mirror in Los Angeles launching his own attack on Columbus Day but New York City has a very wealthy very large and very powerful italian-american community people like Rudy Giuliani and billionaire Ken Langone Wall Street Titans political Titans from the italian-american community with unlimited resources both financial and political are now pushing back because they see it as an assault on them Christopher Columbus has long been a symbol of the italian-american community especially in New York City I grew up there as an italian-american guy I know these people their resources are limitless their financial their political like I was saying they are they are very wealthy very well-connected people and the Blasio picked a fight here that he probably cannot win in fact just this week Italian American leaders boycotted a de Blasio event at Gracie Mansion so the New York City Mayor lives celebrating the italian-american community while the leaders of that community those people with the political context and with the money decided not to show up and when you're a politician and you lose one of your most powerful wealthiest groups when you lose not just their support but now they're now their adversaries you put yourself into some pretty hot water but I expected no less from a guy like Bill de Blasio but this is even bigger than that this is about an attack on you the things you hold the dear the things that you want to see continue progressives will not allow that until they sanitize our entire culture and bring us down to the lowest common denominator of third world country and we absolutely cannot let them do that we cannot let them win this ideological Civil War 2.0 you know I fight it every day and I know if you watch me if you listen to me if you follow me on social media you fight it alongside me we really are the soldiers in this ideological Civil War this Civil War 2.0 and we can never stop fighting because the left will never stop their baseless attacks if you like this segment if you like what we're doing here at the rebel please subscribe to our premium service www dot dot media forward slash shows thank you so
