ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT EVERYDAY VERZENIO. HOWIE: THE INTENSE FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP'S WAR WITH THE MEDIA, HILLARY CLINTON HAD SOME TENSE REWHRAITIONS HER PRESS CORPS. ONE REPORTER SAID SHE REALLY HATES ME. JOINING ME, AMY CHOZICK, THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "CHASING HILLARY." YOU WROTE IN THE BACK IT FELT DAMN GOOD TO BASS NEXT GIRL POWER WHEN SHE GOT THE NOMINATION. THEN YOU SAY WHEN YOU WROTE YOUR LAST STORY AFTER THE ELECTION, YOU FINALLY CRIED. DID YOU FEEL COMPROMISED AS A REPORTER COVERING THIS CANDIDATE WHO YOU PASSIONATELY BELIEVED IN. I CRIED BECAUSE I WAS ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED. I MAKE CLEAR IT'S NOT BECAUSE HILLARY LOST. IF YOU READ THE BOOK YOU KNOW THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLY CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND THE PRESS AND MY POSITION AS THE LEAD BEAT REPORTER. SHE CALLED THE POLITICAL PRESS BIG EGOS AND NO BRAINS. I THINK THAT TENSION CARRIED OVER AND SPILLED OVER INTO THAT U.N. PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE SHE HAD TO ADDRESS THE PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER FOR THE FIRST TIME. HOWIE: YOU SAY THE EMAIL SCANDAL BROKEN BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES," YOU THOUGHT IT HAD NO MORE NATIONAL IMPORTANCE THAN BRISTOL PALIN'S PREGNANCY. BUT YOU SAID I WOULD REGRET AND RESENT IT BECAME THE ONLY STORY. I DIDN'T COMPARE IT TO BRISTOL PALIN'S PREGNANCY. THIS IS NOT SPECIFIC TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES." THE EMAIL SERVER PAYMENT ONLY STORY, AND I THINK THERE WERE PLENTY OTHER THINGS THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT'S JUST THE FACT THERE WERE PROBABLY OTHER THINGS. HOWIE: SINCE THE BOOK CAME OUT, CHELSEA CLINTON SAYS YOU GOT A FEW THINGS WRONG INCLUDING SHE WAS POPPING THE CHAMPAGNE CORK ON ELECTION NIGHT WHEN SHE SAYS SHE WAS HOME WITH HER BABY. I IDENTIFY WITH CHELSEA SINCE I HAVE MY 8-WEEK-OLD BABY AT HOME RIGHT NOW. THEY WERE ATTACKING THE BOOK BEFORE IT EVEN CAME OUT. AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR CHELSEA. I COVERED THIS FAMILY FOR A DECADE. I KEPT COPIOUS NOTES. SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE FIGHTING OVER CHAMPAGNE AND HAIR TREATMENT SPEAKS TO THE BROADER THEMES OF THE BOOK. HOWIE: YOU WRITE THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S MALE COTERIE OF MOSTLY MALE AIDES. BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU NAME THEM IN THE BOOK. YOU GIVE THEM NICKNAMES. IT'S LIKE YOU ARE PROTECTING THEM. I DIDN'T GIVE THESE GUYS NICKNAMES BECAUSE I WAS PROTECTING THEIR ANONYMITY. YOU MADE A CONNECTION THAT YOU THINK ONE OF THEM IS HILLARY'S YOU AIDE. HOWIE: I KNOW WHO IT IS BECAUSE SAID HE PLAYED INTO THE BASE. THIS WASN'T ABOUT GRANTING ANONYMITY. MY MOM'S BOOK CLUB IN TEXAS. THESE GUYS ALL HAVE SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS. THEY ALL PLAYED THE SAME ROLE IN MY LIFE, CONTROLLING COVERAGE AND TRYING TO GET IN MY HEAD. THEY BECAME A TRAGIC GREEK CHORUS. I THOUGHT IT WOULD RESONATE WITH READERS TO GIVE THEM MONIKERS. HOWIE: I ADOPTED HILLARY'S MOOD, I WENT AROUND THE WORLD DECEMBER UPON ACCIDENT AND AGGRIEVED FOR NOT BEING LIKEABLE ENOUGH. DOESN'T SOUNDS LIKE FUN. THERE IS AN INSTINCT AS A FEMALE TO BE LIKEABLE. IF YOU PICK UP THE MOOD OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY JOYLESS PERIOD IN HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. WHEN YOU ARE TRAVELING EVERYWHERE SHE IS AND GOING TO THESE RALLIES YOU CAN'T HELP BUT ADOPT THAT BUS. MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BERNIE BUS WERE EXUDING THE CONFIDENCE OF A BUGGED INSURGENCY. HOWIE: YOU WERE ON THIS PROGRAM FOUR YEARS AGO. AFTER ROGER AILES DIED, YOU SAY FOX GAVE YOU ALL THIS MAKEUP AND THIS WAS PART OF ROGER AILES PLAN FOR SEXTING UP FEMALES. ANY REGRETS ABOUT THE CHEAP SHOT? I LOVE THE FOX NEWS MAKEUP ARTISTS. I'M GETTING VERY LITTLE SLEEP WITH A NEWBORN AND THEY TURNED ME INTO BEING ALMOST TV READY. THAT WAS NOT A SHOT AT THE MAKEUP TEAM. THEY ARE GOOD AT THEIR JOBS. HOWIE: BUT I WILL SAY YOU ARE
