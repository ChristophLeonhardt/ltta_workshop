I READ EARLIER
TODAY THAT ROBERT MUELLER HAD
MET WITH THE HEADS OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
WE ALL
WONDERED WHAT IS IT THEY
DISCUSSED.
IT SEEMS IT HAS BEEN
REVEALED THAT THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL WILL BE INVESTIGATING
TRUMP PERSONALLY FOR POSSIBLE
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
I DON'T
KNOW WHAT KIND OF CASE HE COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE AT THIS POINT.
THE
AMBIGUITY HE PUT OUT OVER THE
PAST 48 HOURS WAS DESIGNED TO
PUT PRESSURE ON THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL TO QUICKLY SWEEP THE
ENTIRE THING UNDER THE RUG,
WHICH IS BY ITSELF OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE.
I'M NOT SURPRISED BY
THIS, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS
INVESTIGATING THIS WHOLE TIME.
BUT NOW IT IS OUT THERE THAT IT
WILL BE ONE OF THE COMPONENTS
OF THE INVESTIGATION.
I FEEL LIKE IF THERE IS
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WHY FIRE
JAMES COMEY?
WHY FOOT WITH THE
IDEA OF FIRING ROBERT MUELLER?
EVERYTHING SEEMS STRANGE TO
ME.IT DOES MAKE PEOPLE MORE
SUSPICIOUS.
IF I WAS BEING
INVESTIGATED FOR HAVING
QUESTIONABLE TIES TO RUSSIA I
WOULD SAY LOOK THROUGH MY EMAIL
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT.
IT IS STRANGE HOW FAR HE IS
GOING AND TRYING TO DO AWAY
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.
IT IS ALSO DONALD TRUMP WHO
HAS SAID ON RECORD NOT FORGIVE,
NOT FORGET.
HE REALLY GOES AFTER
PEOPLE WHO FUCK HIM OVER.
HE
WILL GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
FOR REVENGE.
I THINK TRUMP IS
STUPID ENOUGH TO FIRE SOMEONE
AND NOT REALIZE IT IS
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
HOW
GREAT WOULD IT BE IF HE WAS
IMPEACHED OVER THIS?
JUST HIM
FIRING THIS GUY THAT THAT COULD
ACTUALLY GET HIM FIRED.
IT'S AMAZING.
IT COULD BE THAT HAS MESSED
UP PSYCHOLOGY MAKES HIM LOOK
CONSTANTLY LIKE A PERSON WHO WAS
DOING INCREDIBLY SUSPICIOUS
THINGS.
BUT WE CAN LOOK AT HAVE
CIRCLE TOO.
SESSIONS WAS 
ALSO
BEING INCREDIBLY SUSPICIOUS.
ALSO HIS REFUSAL TO RELEASE
TAX RETURNS, IT ALL KINDS OF
PLAYS INTO THE LARGER PUZZLE.
IF
YOU WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO
GO AWAY THE BEST THING FOR YOU
TO DO IS COOPERATE WITH THE
INVESTIGATION, AND IT
WILL GO AWAY.
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BEFORE ñ
DEMOCRATS HAVE A POOR ABILITY TO
EXPLAIN WHAT THE RUSSIA
COLLUSION IS.
BUT REALLY IT IS
MOST LIKELY THAT TRUMP JUST AS
BUSINESS DEALINGS AND SOME SORT
OF COLLUSION FINANCIALLY.
SO WHY
NOT JUST SAY THAT?
I LOVE THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT
UP ñ I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
CONFUSED AND HAVE DIFFERENT
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WHOLE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
SOME
PEOPLE THINK DID RUSSIA HACK
INTO OUR SYSTEM AND CHANGE
VOTES?
I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE
FAILING AT CLEAR AND CONCISE
MESSAGING AS TO WHAT THEY THINK
THE REAL ISSUE IS.
I ARGUE THE
REAL ISSUE IS MORE OF A CONFLICT
OF INTEREST ISSUE.
EVEN BEFORE
TRUMP GOT ELECTED, I BELIEVE IT
WAS MICHAEL PUBLISHED A PIECE ON
TRUMPS FINANCIAL TIES TO RUSSIA.
IF YOU OWE RUSSIA MONEY ARE YOU
MORE LIKELY TO PUSH FOR POLICIES
THAT FAVOR RUSSIA AS OPPOSED TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
THOSE ARE
ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED
INTO.
DEMOCRATS SHOULD FOCUS ON
AND DO BETTER MESSAGING.
BY
SAYING COLLUSION ñ MOST PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW WHAT COLLUSION IS.
OR
SAYING HACKING, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY HACKING?
IN REALITY I THINK
IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING BUT I
DO NOT BELIEVE FOR A SECOND THAT
RUSSIA HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.
THE
HILLARY SUPPORTERS THAT KEEP
PUSHING THAT NARRATIVE ARE
RIDICULOUS.
HILLARY NEEDS TO
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT AND
SO DO YOU GUYS.
MORE THAN
ANYTHING, FOCUS ON WHITE AS THE
DEMOCRATS LOST AND DO BEHAVIOR
CORRECTION THERE.
IN TERMS OF TRUMPS COLLUSION,
HE IS COLLUSION WITH EVERY
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
HE IS THE
FIRST BONA FIDE BRAND.
I WISH
TRUMP ACTUALLY REVERSES SOME OF
THE POLICIES.
THE COLD WAR IS RESURRECTED.
THAT WAS THE ONE GOOD THING I
THOUGHT WOULD COME OUT OF HIS
PRESIDENCY, SOME NORMALIZATION
WITH RUSSIA, INSTEAD 
IT IS THE
OPPOSITE.
