THE WOMAN IN THE VIRAL PHOTO OF
A BIKER FLIPPING OFF TRUMP'S
MOTORCADE HAS BEEN FIRED OVER
THE IMAGE.
THIS WOMAN IS JULIE BRISTOW MAN,
A 50-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF TWO.
SHE SAID SHE WAS STUNNED THAT
SOMEONE HAD TAKEN A PICTURE
OF HER GIVING TRUMP THE MIDDLE
FINGER.
APPARENTLY HE WAS DRIVING BACK
FROM A GOLF COURSE AND SHE
WAS ALONG THE ROUTE.
SHE SAYS SHE GAVE IN THE MIDDLE
FINGER A FEW TIMES AND THE
PICTURE WAS SNAPPED BY A WHITE
HOUSE PHOTOGRAPHER.
IT HAS SINCE GONE VIRAL.
AS THE PHOTO CIRCULATED ONLINE
SHE DECIDED TO TELL HER
COMPANY WHAT HAPPENED.
WHEN SHE WENT TO WORK ON MONDAY
– BY TUESDAY HER BOSS IS CALLED
INTO A MEETING AND HAD VIOLATED
THE COMPANY POLICY BY
MAKING THE PICTURE OR PROFILE
PICTURE.
SHE WANTED TO GIVE HER COMPANY A
HEADS UP, THEN ON TUESDAY
THEY FIRED HER OVER THIS PHOTO.
THE COMPANY SAID THE 
PHOTO COULD
HURT THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE
THEY ARE A GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTOR.
THAT LOGIC DIDN'T SEEM TO HOLD
TRUE IN OTHER CASES.
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE MAY BE A
LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL
BIAS THERE.
IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT HE WOULD
KEEP HIS JOB FOR SAYING THAT BUT
THEN FLIPPING OFF TRUMP'S
MOTORCADE, THAT SEEMED MORE
OBSCENE AND RUDE THAN USING THAT
SORT OF LANGUAGE ONLINE.
IT SEEMS SORT OF ANTITHETICAL TO
A LOT OF THE RHETORIC YOU HERE.
THEY ARE ALL AGAINST THIS PC
CULTURE, AND THEN SOMEBODY FLIPS
SOMEBODY OFTEN THEY ARE
FIRED OVER THAT?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
>> THAT IS KIND OF THE DANGER OF
SOCIAL MEDIA.
THERE'S A LOT OF PERKS, BUT ON
THE DOWNSIDE IF YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
TECHNICALLY AND THEN YOU USE IT
AS YOUR PROFILE PICTURE AND THEN
PEOPLE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU WORK,
THEY KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND.
I DON'T REALLY AGREE WITH HER
USING IT AS HER FACEBOOK
PHOTO BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS
KIND OF CRAZY THAT SHE GOT
FIRED OVER THAT.
>> I THINK IT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
>>YOU REALLY ARE ASKING FOR IT.
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.
>>AND THEN YOU GO TO HR AND YOU
POINTED OUT TO THEM.
YOU MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN
ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT.
BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE
PICTURE THAT NECESSARILY
INDICATED WHO SHE WAS.
THERE COULD'VE BEEN ANONYMITY
BUT CLEARLY SHE WASN'T GOOD
WITH THAT.
>>SHE WAS PROUD OF WHAT SHE DID,
BUT THEN TO MAKE IT AS YOUR
SOCIAL IDENTITY – WHAT IF PEOPLE
GO TO THAT BUSINESS AND SAY THIS
EMPLOYEE IS WORKING THERE, AND
THEN IT BECOMES THEIR
BURDEN AND RESPONSIBILITY.
I FEEL LIKE THEY REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE BUT TO DO THAT.
>> THE LAST THING ON THIS, IF
YOU ARE AWARE OF THE CULTURE AT
YOUR ORGANIZATION YOU SHOULD BE
AWARE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT YOU CAN POST ON SOCIAL
MEDIA.
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THERE IS
CLEARLY THE KIND OF
CONTRADICTION THAT HANNAH JUST
OUTLINED.
LIKE I CAN CALL PEOPLE
LIBTARD SAND THAT IS NOT
OBSCENE?
>> BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE
CULTURE OF THE COMPANY
AND SOME YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH
IT.
>> THIS COMPARATIVELY IS NOT THE
SAME SORT OF THING AT ALL.
>> THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE
CONSEQUENCES AS WELL.
>> I FEEL A LITTLE CONFLICTED
AND I DO THINK THAT TO SOME
EXTENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
EXPRESS YOURSELF HOW YOU
PLEASE IN YOUR FREE TIME.
IF YOU ARE ON COMPANY TIME, OR
IN A BUSINESS SITUATION,
THAT IS ANOTHER STORY.
>>THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID, IT WAS
NOT COMPANY TIME.
>> SOCIAL MEDIA COMPLICATES IT
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN SEE
WHERE YOU WORK.
>>YEAH, DON'T POST WHERE YOU
WORK.
>>BULLETS HAVE SOME FREEDOM OF
EXPRESSION.
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE IN OUR
SOCIETY WE DO KIND OF BASE
THINGS ON OUR OWN
POLITICAL VIEWS?
DO YOU THINK THAT LIBERALS DO
THAT AS WELL?
OR DO YOU THINK IT IS JUST
SOMETHING THAT THE RIGHT
DOES MORE?
>> NO, I THINK IF I HAD SEEN
SOMEBODY FLIPPING OFF OBAMA OR
BERNIE SANDERS AND HAVE THEIR
JOB LISTED, I DON'T THINK
THEY SHOULD BE FIRED, OF COURSE
NOT.
WE ARE GOING TO GET TO A STORY
THE NEXT STORY WERE GOING
TO DO IS TALKING ABOUT RAND PAUL
BEING ASSAULTED.
I DON'T AGREE WITH RAND PAUL,
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
SHOULD BE ASSAULTED.
YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY'S
POLITICAL OPINIONS OR AGREE WITH
THEM, BUT STILL I THINK THERE
ARE CERTAIN COURSES OF ACTION
THAT SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE
BECAUSE –
>>I THINK SHE WAS JUST SORT OF
INVITING –
>>I
THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT MAYBE IT
WASN'T THE SMARTEST THING.
BUT TO YOUR POINT IT IS IRONIC
BECAUSE THE SIDE OF THE
AISLE THAT CALLS OUT SNOWFLAKES
ALL THE TIME FOR POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE
FLIP OF THE BIRD IN TRAFFIC.
>>IT WAS CLEARLY JUST
EXPRESSION.
>>I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN IT
FIRST BROKE.
>>SHE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT A
LOT OF US FEEL.
>> PLUS IT WASN'T A PICTURE OF
HER IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE
SO SHE WASN'T REALLY IN THE
HEART OF INTENSE CONTROVERSY BUT
AS WE ALL NOW HAVE SAID, HER
TERRITORY WAS NOT SO –
>>I DON'T PUT THE SPECIFICS AS
TO WHAT I DO.
I PUT THE SPECIFIC PLACES I
CONTRIBUTE TO BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT PEOPLE – IT IS JUST
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.
IF YOU ARE AN OUTSPOKEN PERSON
AND YOU HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA THERE
ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE
SURE YOU HAVE A SAFE SPACE
FOR YOUR OPINION.
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, PEOPLE
WILL DISAGREE AND
ULTIMATELY FIRE YOU, LIKE THIS
WOMAN.
I HAVE FRIENDS WHO DON'T REALLY
PUT THEIR GOVERNMENT NAME ON
FACEBOOK, THEY HAVE ANOTHER NAME
AND THEY DON'T PUT THEIR
OCCUPATION SO IT IS LIKE THEIR
FREE SPACE – IT IS THEIR FREE
SPACE TO KIND OF SAY WHAT THEY
WANT AND DO WHAT THEY WANT.
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
AND YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR
PROFILE PICTURE LIKE THAT,
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR
OCCUPATION UNDER THERE.
>>HOW WOULD THAT HAVE CHANGED
IT?
>>MAYBE IT WOULD'VE TAKEN A
LITTLE LONGER FOR THEM TO
IDENTIFY WHO SHE WAS?
>> I FEEL LIKE IF YOU ARE
TAKING A PICTURE OF YOURSELF –
THAT IS ONE THING.
BUT THIS IS THE MOST INNOCUOUS
THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
>> AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL WHO
SHE IS, IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
WEARING A COMPANY JACKET.
>> TOO ABSURD.
