BE SHOOTER, DEAD WITH 
SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND BUT
A WOMAN, SOMETHING WE'VE NOT 
SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME.
DEFINITELY NOT IN LAST YEAR IN 
MAJOR SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT, TOM.
POLICE ENCOUNTERED A CHAOTIC 
SITUATION, A DECEASED WOMAN ON 
THE FLOOR AT YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS APPARENTLY FROM 
SELF-INFLICTED WOUND.
THAT'S WHY THINK SHE'S THE 
SHOOTER.
EXTREMELY RARE, DID A STUDY OF 
THESE INCIDENTS AND ALL THE 
PERPETRATORS WERE MALE.
>> BRING IN BRAD GARRETT.
YOU HEARD THE NEWS CONFERENCE.
SHOOTER IS APPARENTLY DEAD, 
FEMALE.
THREE TO FOUR OTHER VICTIMS WITH

YOUTUBE, A SPRAWLING CAMPUS, 
1,700 EMPLOYEES.
POS
POSSIBLE TARGETING LUNCH HOUR.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THIS?
>> REAL QUESTION IS MOTIVE?
DID THE SHOOTER GO TO SHOOT A 
PARTICULAR PERSON IN LUNCH HOUR 
AND TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES AND 
OTHERS HAPPENED TO GET SHOT?
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
KEY IS MOTIVE.
AND IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE 
CONNECTED TO HER?
>> BRAD, THE TARGET HERE OR 
PLACE WHERE THIS HAPPENED, 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, OWNED BY 
GOOGLE.
COULD THIS HAVE NO CONNECTION 
WHATSOEVER OR A HUGE CONNECTION 
BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT 
LOG ON TO YOUTUBE EVERY DAY AND 
USE GOOGLE?
>> THIS GOES IF PERSONAL, GOING 
TO SHOOT AN INDIVIDUAL TO I HATE
GOOGLE, YOUTUBE, DON'T LIKE 
SOMETHING ON YOUTUBE.
REALLY HARD TO SAY UNTIL WE HAVE
MORE INFORMATION.
YOU HAVE TO FUNCTION IN WHAT DO 
WE KNOW ABOUT THIS WOMAN?
DOES SHE HAVE CONNECTIONS OR HAS
SHE SENT OUT OTHER PIECES OF 
INFORMATION TO SUGGEST THIS IS 
BIGGER THAN JUST HER?
>> MAJOR REVELATION NO DOUBT, 
FEMALE SHOOTER AT YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS WHO WE NOW 
UNDERSTAND IS DEAD.
ONGOING AND ACTIVE SITUATION.
CONTINUE TO MONITOR
