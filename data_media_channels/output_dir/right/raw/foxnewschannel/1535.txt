1
00:00:01,628 --> 00:00:05,665
A SHIFTING TIMELINE ON HIS

2
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:06,599
MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,436
DICTATOR KIM DRONE ON.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,237
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION ARE

5
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:12,405
BEGINNING TO MAKE WATERGATE LOOK

6
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:15,375
LIKE CHILD'S PLAY.

7
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,510
THE REVELATIONS OF THE OBAMA ERA

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,612
POLITICAL TARGETING GROW MORE

9
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:20,346
OMINOUS BY THE DAY.

10
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:23,983
THE FBI IS UNDER INCREASING

11
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:24,817
PRESSURE TONIGHT TO EXPLAIN WHY

12
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,387
IT WAS SURVEILLING THE TRUMP

13
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,688
CAMPAIGN AS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

14
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:30,089
CONTACTED BY INFORMANTS

15
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,326
CONTINUES TO INCREASE.

16
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,161
SAM CLOVIS, GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS

17
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,729
AND CARTER PAGE WERE TARGETED.

18
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,832
THE LETTER RESPONDING LAST NIGHT

19
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,936
ON THE "ANGLE."

20
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,038
THE PERSON I WAS SPEAKING WITH

21
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:48,174
WHO IS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AT

22
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,276
CAMBRIDGE IN THE U.K. AT THE

23
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,844
TIME.

24
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,180
I WAS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,750
A CONFERENCE IN JULY OF 2016 AND

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,786
EVERYTHING SEEMED TOTALLY NORMAL

27
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:00,420
EVERYTHING SEEMED TOTALLY NORMA

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,753
NORMAL.

29
00:01:00,753 --> 00:01:01,387
>> Laura: IT'S CALLED

30
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:02,922
GROOMING, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO,

31
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:03,623
CARTER.

32
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:05,024
BUT A MUCH MORE INCENDIARY CLAIM

33
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,826
WAS MADE BY ONE OF OUR OTHER

34
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:07,560
GUESTS.

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,494
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR

36
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:10,463
MICHAEL CAVUTO TOLD ME LAST

37
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,165
NIGHT THAT HE KNOWS FOR A FACT

38
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:16,970
THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE

39
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,904
INFORMANT TARGETING TRUMP TEAM

40
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:20,373
MEMBERS BECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF

41
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:20,807
THOSE TARGETS.

42
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:21,474
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING

43
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:24,210
THAT I KNOW FOR A FACT.

44
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,578
THIS INFORMANT, THIS PERSON THAT

45
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:27,580
THEY PLANTED, TRY TO PLANT INTO

46
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,983
THE CAMPAIGN AND EVEN INTO THE

47
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:30,683
ADMINISTRATION IF YOU BELIEVE

48
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:32,185
AXIOS, HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON

49
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:34,454
THAT CAME WITH THE CAMPAIGN AND

50
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:37,490
THE FBI IS NOT THE ONLY OBAMA

51
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,591
AGENCY THAT CAME WITH THE

52
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:38,958
CAMPAIGN.

53
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,793
I KNOW BECAUSE THEY CAME AT ME.

54
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:41,961
>> Laura: THE PRESIDENT

55
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,797
RESPONDED TO THE INTRIGUE TODAY.

56
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:46,032
>> IF THEY HAD SPIES IN MY

57
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:47,600
CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD BE A

58
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,703
DISGRACE TO THIS COUNTRY.

59
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:52,238
INSULTS THAT ANYONE HAS EVER

60
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:52,639
SEEN.

61
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,539
THAT WOULD BE VERY ILLEGAL ASIDE

62
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,641
FROM EVERYTHING ELSE.

63
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,309
IT WOULD MAKE PROBABLY EVERY

64
00:01:56,309 --> 00:02:00,213
POLITICAL EVENT EVER LOOK LIKE

65
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:00,680
SMALL POTATOES.

66
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,281
THAT WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED IN

67
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,750
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

68
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,151
>> Laura: CAVUTO ADVANCED HIS

69
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:07,320
CLAIM EARLIER ON FOX CLAIMING

70
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,989
THAT SOMEONE, A SHADOWY FIGURE

71
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,758
FLOATED THE IDEA OF PASSING

72
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,393
ALONG EMAILS RELATED TO

73
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,328
HILLARY CLINTON TO THE TRUMP

74
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:18,765
CAMPAIGN.

75
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,600
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU RAISED

76
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,701
THIS ISSUE WITH MUELLER'S TEAM

77
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,771
WHEN THEY WERE QUESTIONING YOU.

78
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:26,572
AND THEY DID NOTHING?

79
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,740
>> THEY WEREN'T EVEN INTERESTED.

80
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,609
THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO BE

81
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:30,043
TAKING NOTES.

82
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:32,845
I OFFERED THEM THE TIMELINE.

83
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,080
>> Laura: WE AT "THE INGRAHAM

84
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,948
ANGLE" ALONG WITH A DOJ PRODUCER

85
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,418
AT FOX LOOKED INTO THESE CLAIMS

86
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,219
AND HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FIGURE

87
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,454
IN QUESTION.

88
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,624
OUR SOURCE CORROBORATED SOME OF

89
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,126
CAVUTO'S CLAIMS BUT HE DENIED

90
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:49,028
TRYING TO ENTRAP CAVUTO AND HIS

91
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:49,429
ASSOCIATES.

92
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,197
HE FURTHER INSISTED THAT HE DID

93
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:53,599
NOT WORK FOR ANY INTELLIGENCE

94
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,071
AGENCY.

95
00:02:58,204 --> 00:02:59,706
FBI'S TARGETING OF INFORMAL OR

96
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:00,573
LOW LEVEL TRUMP ASSOCIATES TO

97
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:01,708
GET DIRT ON HIGHER-UPS WAS

98
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,712
SOMETHING OF A TREND, PERHAPS A

99
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:06,446
DANGEROUS ONE DURING THE OBAMA

100
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:06,913
ADMINISTRATION.

101
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,615
LET'S TURN TO NEWT GINGRICH TO

102
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:10,616
REACT TO THE LATEST REVELATIONS

103
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,219
ABOUT THE DEEP STATE'S MISDEEDS.

104
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,587
MR. SPEAKER, IT IS GREAT TO SEE

105
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:14,887
YOU.

106
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:18,991
MY GOODNESS, THIS IS WILD.

107
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,226
YOU HAVE THIS PERSON, A

108
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:22,695
PROFESSOR IN ENGLAND WHO IS

109
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:23,362
MAKING THESE CONTACTS WITH

110
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,298
VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP

111
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:26,199
TEAM, THROWING THE WHOLE TIME

112
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,901
LINE INTO.

113
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,836
ORIGINALLY WE HEARD FROM COMEY

114
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,536
THAT THE INVESTIGATION REALLY

115
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:34,373
BEGAN ON JULY 31ST, NOW IT LOOKS

116
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,608
LIKE THIS PARTICULAR INFORMANT,

117
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:36,976
SPY, MOLE, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

118
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,077
CALL HIM, MET WITH CARTER PAGE

119
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,846
IN EARLY JULY.

120
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:45,251
>> IT ALL KEEPS GETTING MORE AND

121
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,987
MORE OPEN.

122
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:48,955
PRESENTLY, REMEMBER THERE WAS A

123
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,957
REFERENCE AT ONE POINT VERY

124
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,860
EARLY ON TO SENIOR OBAMA

125
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,797
ADMINISTRATION PEOPLE BEING

126
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:58,131
BRIEFED.

127
00:03:58,131 --> 00:03:58,831
PRESENTLY SOMEONE WILL FIGURE

128
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:01,167
OUT TO ASK WHAT DID VALERIE

129
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,602
JARRETT KNOW AND WHEN DID SHE

130
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,203
KNOW WHAT YOU MAX ME WHEN I

131
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,805
ASKED THAT LAST NIGHT ON THE

132
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:06,606
"ANGLE."

133
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:08,174
>> YOU ARE RIGHT ON TARGET.

134
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:08,875
WHAT DID BARACK OBAMA KNOW AND

135
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,409
WHEN DID HE KNOW WHAT?

136
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,678
BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

137
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:13,713
HAPPENED IS ON EVERY SINGLE

138
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:14,680
LEVEL, AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

139
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,649
WITH REALLY BIG SCANDALS, THEY

140
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,218
KEEP UNFOLDING AND THEY KEEP

141
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,120
UNFOLDING AND THEY KEEP

142
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,687
UNFOLDING.

143
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:26,192
SO WE ARE NOW SUPPOSED TO

144
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:27,460
BELIEVE THAT THE DIRECTOR OF

145
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,061
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE WAS LYING

146
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,798
TO US, THE HEAD OF THE CENTRAL

147
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,800
INTELLIGENCE

148
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:33,833
INTELLIGENCE                   C

149
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:33,866
INTELLIGENCE                   N

150
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:33,900
INTELLIGENCE                   R

151
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:34,901
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WAS LYING TO

152
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,469
US, THE HEAD OF THE FEDERAL

153
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:37,136
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION WAS

154
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,037
LYING TO US.

155
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,172
THE NUMBER TWO PERSON IN THE FBI

156
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:41,407
WAS LYING TO US.

157
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,141
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS LYING

158
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:43,843
TO US.

159
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:44,944
SHE WAS MEETING WITH

160
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:45,745
BILL CLINTON ON AN AIRPLANE IN

161
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,580
PRIVATE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR

162
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,014
GRANDCHILDREN.

163
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:48,748
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU JUST SAY

164
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,017
GIVE ME A BREAK?

165
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:51,918
AND ALL OF THIS I BELIEVE WAS

166
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,389
BEING COORDINATED BY OBAMA AND

167
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:56,923
BY VALERIE JARRETT.

168
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,457
>> Laura: YOU WILL WRITE TO

169
00:04:58,457 --> 00:04:59,892
OBAMA ON THIS.

170
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:00,793
YOU THINK IT'S INCONCEIVABLE

171
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:01,527
THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

172
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:05,331
OF THE COUNTRY WAS NOT TOLD THAT

173
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:07,066
THEY HAD SEEN THIS CARTER PAGE

174
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,601
ON THE LIST OF THE FOREIGN

175
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,435
POLICY ADVISORS AND THEY DECIDED

176
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,370
TO GO INTO OVERDRIVE?

177
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,006
>> I DON'T BELIEVE -- LOOK AT

178
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:15,641
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THINGS GOING

179
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:15,908
ON.

180
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:20,146
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS

181
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:20,780
ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS A

182
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,547
TIGHTLY CENTRALIZED AS THE OBAMA

183
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:22,548
ADMINISTRATION, YOU COULD HAVE

184
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:26,485
HAD AS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS

185
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,621
GOING ON, ALL OF THEM ARE

186
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,322
ILLEGAL WITHOUT THE PRESIDENT

187
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:31,891
HAVING BEEN BRIEFED.

188
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,960
FURTHERMORE, AN EXAMPLE.

189
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,064
THE PRESIDENT IS EMAILING

190
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:42,635
HILLARY CLINTON ON HER INSECURE

191
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:43,302
EMAIL.

192
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,005
THEY CAREFULLY REWORD THE FBI

193
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,541
REPORT TO AVOID TELLING US THAT

194
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,408
PRESIDENT OBAMA CLEARLY HAD TO

195
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,410
KNOW SHE WAS USING AN ILLEGAL

196
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,613
EMAIL BECAUSE HE'S WRITING TO IT

197
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:54,280
EMAIL BECAUSE HE'S WRITING TO I

198
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,647
IT.

199
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:55,648
>> Laura: SUSAN RICE SAID

200
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:56,782
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID EVERYTHING

201
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:57,183
BY THE BOOK.

202
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,685
REMEMBER SHE WROTE THAT EMAIL TO

203
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,053
HERSELF, I HAVE TO MENTION IT IN

204
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:01,587
EVERY SHOW.

205
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:02,889
THIS IS WHAT JIM CLAPPER SAID

206
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,057
TODAY ON THE VIEW ABOUT WHETHER

207
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:05,658
SPYING REALLY OCCURRED.

208
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,461
LET'S WATCH.

209
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,863
>> WAS THE FBI SPYING ON TRUMP'S

210
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:11,230
CAMPAIGN?

211
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,865
>> THEY WERE NOT.

212
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:16,335
THEY WERE SPYING -- A TERM I

213
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,270
DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE -- ON

214
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,271
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WERE DOING,

215
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,706
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

216
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:22,208
RUSSIANS INFILTRATING, TRYING TO

217
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,443
GAIN ACCESS, TRYING TO GAIN

218
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:25,378
LEVERAGE?

219
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,078
>> Laura: IF THE RUSSIANS ARE

220
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:29,615
PULLING THE STRINGS.

221
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,684
>> I'VE KNOWN JIM KLAPPER FOR

222
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,251
YEARS.

223
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:34,320
I AM ASTOUNDED HOW BAD HE LOOKS

224
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,821
NOW.

225
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,223
I'M ASTOUNDED HOW DISHONEST AND

226
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:38,457
INCOMPETENT HE LOOKS.

227
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,426
HE WAS A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT

228
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,627
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

229
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:42,628
BUT WHEN THE DIRECTOR -- FORMER

230
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,530
DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE TELLS

231
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,933
YOU HE DOESN'T LIKE TO USE THE

232
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:47,767
WORD SPYING YOU HAVE TO ASK

233
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:48,668
YOURSELF --    --

234
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:49,835
>> Laura: THAT IS FUNNY.

235
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,704
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

236
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,338
>> HE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

237
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:53,639
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

238
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,308
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WAS IN

239
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:55,775
CHARGE OF DOING?

240
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:57,810
HE WAS IN CHARGE OF SPYING.

241
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,612
AND THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST --

242
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,314
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, I THINK WHAT

243
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:05,952
HAPPENED WAS PEOPLE LIKE CLAPPER

244
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:06,585
AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE

245
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:07,787
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, ALL

246
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:08,487
THESE GUYS THOUGHT THEY COULD

247
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,623
GET AWAY WITH THIS BECAUSE

248
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:12,625
HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN.

249
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,893
AND WHEN HILLARY WON THE FIX

250
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,128
WOULD BE IN, EVERYTHING WOULD BE

251
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,931
COVERED UP AND AROUND 10:00 ON

252
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:20,933
ELECTION NIGHT THEY ALL BEGAN TO

253
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:24,470
REALIZE THIS COULD GET REALLY

254
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,204
BAD AND THEY WERE SHIFTING GEARS

255
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:27,406
FROM PROTECTING HILLARY, WHICH

256
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,808
HAD BEEN THEIR JOB FOR TWO

257
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,609
YEARS, TO TRYING TO DESTROY

258
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:33,079
TRUMP AND NOW YOU ARE WATCHING

259
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,814
PEOPLE WHO I THINK IN EVERY CASE

260
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:37,049
ARE IN DANGER OF GOING TO JAIL.

261
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:39,986
IF THE SYSTEM WORKS AND PEOPLE

262
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:41,053
ARE ACTUALLY TESTED ON DID YOU

263
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:43,389
TELL THE TRUTH UNDER OATH AND

264
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,025
THEN VIPER IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

265
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,893
>> Laura: HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

266
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,228
THAT BIG MOMENT WHERE HE DIDN'T

267
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:51,430
TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE

268
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,998
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM.

269
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,466
HE ADDRESSED THIS TODAY.

270
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,266
>> THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING ME A

271
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,937
LYING MACHINE.

272
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,605
OKAY.

273
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,707
WHAT THAT STEMS FROM AS AN

274
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,309
EXCHANGE I HAD WITH A SENATOR

275
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:07,880
FIVE YEARS AGO IN MARCH OF 2013

276
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,647
ABOUT A SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM AND

277
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,249
HE WAS ASKING ME ABOUT ONE AND I

278
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,986
WAS THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER.

279
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:14,653
SO I MADE A MISTAKE, BUT I

280
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,823
DIDN'T LIE.

281
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:18,824
>> WHAT YOU ARE REFERENCING IS

282
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:19,992
THAT WHEN YOU SAID -- WHEN

283
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,927
YOU'RE TALKING BUT JAMES SNOWDEN

284
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:23,996
BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON THE NSA

285
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:24,730
ILLEGALLY SPYING INTO THOUSAND

286
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,565
13 WHEN YOU WERE ASKED ABOUT YOU

287
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:27,400
SAID NO.

288
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,402
THAT IS A LIE.

289
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,670
I'M SORRY.

290
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,672
I WAS THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING

291
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:34,273
ELSE.

292
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:36,075
>> Laura: I WANT TO BUY A

293
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:36,708
VOWEL.

294
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,743
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING

295
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,010
ABOUT.

296
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,379
>> I HOPE GENERAL FLYNN WATCHED

297
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,246
THAT AND I HOPE GENERAL FLYNN IS

298
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,249
PREPARED TO GO BACK.

299
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:46,185
OBVIOUSLY THE CLAPPER DEFENSE,

300
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:47,019
WHATEVER YOU THOUGHT I SAID I

301
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:47,787
DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY AND IT WASN'T

302
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:50,222
WHAT I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU

303
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,223
THOUGHT I SET IT BECAUSE I

304
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:52,058
WOULDN'T HAVE SET IT IF I HAD

305
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,293
KNOWN YOU THOUGHT I SAID IT AND

306
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:55,494
THEREFORE CAN'T REALLY BE A

307
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:55,828
PROBLEM.

308
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,196
THIS TELLS YOU HOW PATHETIC THIS

309
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:58,230
IS GOING TO BE.

310
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,465
>> Laura: THIS IS THE

311
00:08:59,465 --> 00:08:59,999
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

312
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,834
THESE ARE LIKE THE MOST

313
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,468
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN OUR

314
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:05,271
INTELLIGENCE -- YOU SAY HE SUCH

315
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,038
A CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL.

316
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:07,073
HE SOUNDS LIKE A BUMBLING IDIOT.

317
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:08,340
SORRY I'M BEING CRUEL HERE I

318
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,641
GUESS.

319
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,444
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

320
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:13,012
>> WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING IS A

321
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,246
MAN WHO WAS A GREAT PROFESSIONAL

322
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:15,681
WHO IS NOW IN A TOTALLY

323
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,950
IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.

324
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,652
TO GET OFF TELEVISION

325
00:09:19,652 --> 00:00:00,000
DESPERATELY TRYING TO EXPLAIN
