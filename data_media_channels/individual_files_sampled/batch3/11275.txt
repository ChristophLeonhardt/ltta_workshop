Rush's envoi to the United Nations says the UK has once again thrown a baseless accusations at the country over the souls brew nabhi chakra tag marcelina been Xia dubs the accusations a cocktail of lies as he clashed with Britain's own voice Aaron Pierce based on a thorough analysis of our intelligence the UK government has concluded that the two individuals named by the police investigation are in fact officers from the Russian military intelligence service also known as the G you seriously man with a well known level of confidence which is highly likely it is stated that they have connections to the Russian security forces their real names are unknown however it is known that they work for the GRU how you can detect that not knowing their real names is a mystery to us the names may be fake but the crimes are real London needs this story for just one purpose to unleash disgusting anti-russia hysteria and involve other countries in this hysteria we have clear evidence of Russian state involvement in what happened in Seoul speak justice courage in the Duelist us you would have to be frank we very much hope that today we'd hear something convincing that sheds light on this mysterious incident unfortunately our expectations were once again not met in today's statement we heard the same cocktail of lies on Wednesday Britain charged two Russian nationals it's aspects of poisoning Sergey and Yulia scruple the latest released evidence though seems to be creating more questions than answers some media outlets have already started digging looking for matches with the suspects names even though UK police say these were probably only ever aliases artis Daniel Hawkins reports all the recent news of Russian assassins probably has UK residents worried and while we must be clear assassination attempts are no laughing matter some British media might be scare mongering just a little within hours speculation was rife who exactly are these men after some digging journalists found a possible match with one of the alleged perpetrators alexander petrov same name and date of birth working for biological medication company mic region perfect cover for a spy media were quick to point out it wasn't case closed though we actually found that eggs and ur and he told us he rarely even gets out of his own city of Tomsk let alone weekend trips to London Yakko but I'm sorry X is done in Flushing doctors genius pre-echo London calculus appears intact above the six year one video kinda I mean I wish to Ksenia or the sort of businesses which n is this but then even more information came to light which explains everything it turns out mr. Petrov has a long family history of spy catchers alexander petrov grandfather events starching who served under stalin as a commander of SMERSH which was also the name of the russia spy team in James Bond classic From Russia With Love now it makes sense but hang on one minute didn't count the terror police chief Neal Basu say the men's identities were likely fake aliases the reason we're releasing that footage today is we need the public's help we strongly believe they entered this country under aliases somebody out there will recognize them somebody out there knows them we'd like those people to come forward and tell us who they really are so the alleged perpetrator who likely used the fake name anyway allegedly has a grandfather who worked for SMERSH an intelligence organization dissolved in 1946 and SMERSH is also a fictional soviet spy agency featuring in James Bond films such as From Russia With Love so everything must make sense you know who I am colonel club head of operations for I have selected you for a most important assignment its purpose is to give false information to the enemy and if I refuse and you will not leave this room alive but are we ignoring some other important links here there are plenty of alexander petrov sin russia the name is just as common as john smith and some of them are really suspicious hiding in fact in plain sight meet russian actor alexander petrov here he is avenging his comrades here he is revealing his real career ambitions a slip of the tongue perhaps but to be honest Petrof always left hints of his real duties in his movies elusive once the name speaks volumes he was never caught until now that is and his latest project to be reborn could be him trying to find a new alias after his cover was blown sorry mr.
