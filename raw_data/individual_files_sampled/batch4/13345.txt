it's time to take a look at the news of the week San Francisco congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has been reelected to her post as House Democrat leader one hundred and fifteen year old Pelosi won the ballot because Democrats said they felt there were still some areas of the country they hadn't alienated these include the rest area between exits 15 and 16 on interstate 40 outside Russellville Arkansas and the last three rows of the old movie theater in Zanesville Ohio Pelosi said she would immediately get to work on issues Americans care about like weather urinals should be installed in women's bathrooms to accommodate women or actually men wearing a dress Dylann roof the man accused of murdering nine people at a historic black church in Shelby North Carolina has decided to act as his own attorney at his trial experts say this proves the truth of the old adage a man who acts as his own lawyer has a racist psycho killer for a client roof is already participating in the jury selection process and says he's looking for jurors who think slaughtering innocent people on mass is a-ok those jurors who have been impaneled so far have already been asking the judge some clarifying questions such as do we have to sit through the whole trial before we convict him and is there a slower more painful version of the death penalty the new Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Republican plans to privatize Medicare show the GOP is going to wage a war on seniors president-elect Donald Trump has said he has no plans to change Medicare but Schumer says it's still a Republican war on seniors because something something something House Republican leader Paul Ryan said he was disappointed in Schumer's remarks because Republicans had been hoping to begin the war on seniors with a surprise attack featuring GOP congressmen leaping out from behind trees to steal seniors canes and push over their wheelchairs Ryan said that after the federal government lost the war on drugs and the war on poverty they were hoping this would be an easy one since the enemy would be old people who can't really fight back is Lama cthe or ''tis in Morocco's say they were shocked by a new segment on a state-owned moroccan television station that showed women how to use makeup to hide the signs of domestic violence local Imams flooded the TV station with phone calls in protest the Imams say using makeup as only for hussies and harlots who are trying to lure innocent Muslims into sin with their sweetly smooth cheeks and lusciously round bodies the Emma the Imam said any woman found using makeup should be beaten leading the television station to rerun the original segment and finally Anthony Weiner has returned to New York from a more than month-long stint in a Tennessee sex clinic Weiner says the clinic taught him that sexting underage girls was bad which surprised him because he'd always thought it was absolutely great Weiner admits his political career is probably over because there's no place for him in the Democrat Party now that he's no longer a sexual deviant trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show I love that story about Dylan roof acting as his own attorney you could just see the judge if you just see the judge going you act as your own attorney go for it baby it reminded me it reminded me of the guy Jeffrey Dahmer the serial killer who got murdered in prison and people said how could this happen and I thought well it happened because the murderer came in and said to the guard excuse me you're standing my way I'd like to kill Jeffrey Dahmer the guard said excuse me let me step it's like a little rough justice going on all right I don't do this often in fact I'll probably never do it again but I want to give a birthday shout-out to my fan Dakota Havel who was turning 24 years old today his his fiancee Sarah Malan said that this would make her the greatest fiancee on earth which I thought was like you know yeah Dakota you are way out chicked because they don't come along that often all right it's this Christmas season has begun we are going to talk about God today because you know I did this we'll do it after the people on Facebook go away because they're going to be cast out into the exterior darkness where there's great weeping gnashing of teeth but you who are what among the Daily Caller writes who can hear the whole show at the Daily Caller like anybody can hear the ocean with the Daily Caller site The Daily wire gosh sorry about that I've been thinking about what is it the anyone can hear the show at The Daily wire but if you want to watch the show you have to subscribe Laozi 8 bucks a month come on subscribe so we'll be talking about god because i had this interview with dave rubin on the reuben report and i've just been getting like hammered all these people all these atheists are so upset that i believe in god and and can explain why they didn't like that all right I have to tell you we were just talking about this before we came on I I have been feeling so jolly you know about this political situation if you had told me if you had told me a month ago all right November 1st if you had told me that I would be feeling jolly because Donald Trump had been elected president I would have laughed twice one the Donald Trump was gonna be elected president although I knew it was gonna be closer than everybody else said I'd have to give myself that but but also that I would feel this good about it I mean and it's not just me it's not just me I'm watching all the guys Krauthammer who said he could never vote for Donald Trump you know as a matter of ethics he's been saying this is going very well you know he he says you know Trump looks like he wants to get stuff done Jonah Goldberg was on the Fox panel I love Jonah Jonah was one I think one of the best political writers out there just a terrific writer great sense of humor really well-informed and he was saying kind of what I've been saying it's like yeah can I pick this apart you know some of this apart from the conservative point of view sure you can sure you can I mean right now as I speak I think Trump is in Indianapolis touting the fact that he saved a thousand jobs at the carrier firm the carrier air-conditioning firm and I think what I saw as I was coming on air was that the deal is that they're gonna give him 7 million bucks and tax incentives and they'll keep a thousand a thousand workers their big this is a big victory for Trump it probably obviously engineered by pence who's the governor still the governor of Indiana so he can do this stuff and you know is there a moral hazard to thinking oh we're gonna do this with all every business but remember this is standard operating procedure every state gives breaks to businesses to induce businesses to come Texas comes to California and says you know you're paying these tremendous taxes if you come to Texas you won't be doing that well maybe we'll give you New York I'll say we'll give you 10 years where you don't have to pay any taxes and that brings jobs into the state and then they start to tax them there's all there's always these things going on but it's but as I said yesterday this is a symbol of a guy who means to move forward and watching by the way watching the White House get upset about this was hilarious here's Josh earnest the presidential spokesman saying well I guess it's all right but not as good as us or the early indications are that this is good news and obviously we'd welcome that good news I know the president-elect has indicated that he deserves credit for for that announcement and I guess what I would observe is that if he is successful in doing that 804 more times then he will meet the record of manufacturing jobs that were created in the United States while President Obama was in office there were 805 and manufacturing jobs that weren't just protected or saved but actually created while President Obama was in office so President Obama has set a high standard and President Lex Trump can meet that standard if this carrier deal is completed in the way that he expects that it will be and if he does set 804 more times then he will have matched the standard established by President Obama at least when it comes to manufacturing jobs the one difference would be that the president-elect is talking about them protecting jobs and the metric I'm using is actually creating jobs if we go to protecting jobs there are more than a million jobs in the industrial Midwest that were saved when President Obama made the decision to rescue the American auto industry here's from The Washington Times with a hat tip to Deborah Hine at PJ Media according to manufacturing employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics since mr. Obama took office in 2009 the US has lost about three hundred and three thousand three hundred three thousand manufacturing jobs I'm not sure even spins that into a positive says the writer moreover in his 2012 re-election campaign mr. Obama promised to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of this year and said he was working to double American exports over the next five years but statistics show he's fallen short on both measures between the time he made the promise in October 2016 the most recent data available the number of manufacturing jobs only rose by 297,000 far below the 1 million jobs he promised so it's all untrue and remember also that this you know we always made fun of Obama for saying he saved jobs cuz there's no way to measure that there is a way to measure this they were carrier was going to move a thousand two thousand jobs to Mexico is now going to only move a thousand jobs so yes he did say them but also remember how Obama used stories like this to spend eight hundred million dollars in stimulus that went basically to the people in the stock you know buying stocks I went to it went to the rich it didn't go to anybody you know the we know it just keep bolster the bolster the stock market so look this is a symbol you know is it fraud is this the way we want them to go forward no do we want them going around giving tax deals to businesses no of course not that's not the point but as a symbol as a symbol that the guy has turned his mind from who's using which bathroom which is so offensive to people not it's not even offensive people because they dislike transgender people that's not the point the point is they're serious stuff going on and he's telling him that he is going to attend to this serious stuff and the thing that is beneath this that is so encouraging and the reason I'm so jolly is it speaks to the fact that it turns out that Trump this wild man this guy who assaults people this guy who talks about crazy stuff like Ted Cruz's father killing Kennedy or being associated with Lee Harvey Oswald all this crazy stuff he has he actually has a plan he has now appointed the sky Stephen minuchin Stephen minuchin who has this to say about the economy all right sorry that was Steve munchkin he's a union guy you know it's like from that Lollipop Guild okay but Steve minuchin is from goldman sachs and yes you know they demonize goldman sachs and go and goldman sachs also has a it's like just stacked with these kings ii and leftist i mean that's the other thing they they make fortune off capitalism and then tell us that it's alright for for us to go into into debt ceaselessly but listen to what he's saying it's important because it shows the Trump is not entirely the wild man we thought this has been an admission administration for the last eight years where we haven't had enough growth our number one priority is going to be tax reform we think that by lowering the corporate tax rate we're going to make US corporations incredibly competitive and create enormous amounts of money that comes back onshore and creates jobs let's talk about how you do that Steven because of obviously you follow Trump throughout the entire campaign process in terms of your first steps during this transition period and first steps in January how do you get that tax reform moving well the good thing about this is Wilbur and I have worked together on the economic plan with the president-elect throughout the campaign we were integral to both economic speeches the one in Detroit as well as the one in New York and we have a plan we've been working with the policy group we're already sitting down and discussing this with Congress and this is going to be something that happens absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency we're gonna have a major tax reform biggest tax reform since Reagan and it's not just going to be a cut in corporate taxes but it's also going to be a very large middle-income tax cut that's gonna help this country this is all stuff that makes a Conservatives heart you know warm and the thing you know all and even the things that I've been worried about like the spending on infrastructure which I think can just become a graft pit and not really create as many jobs as they say it's it's going to even though we need some infrastructure work they're talking about bringing this money on shore and privatizing some of this work and giving incentives to people to do infrastructure work that's very different than just throwing money at the problem which is essentially what Democrats do Plus Democrats always keep control of anything they throw money at if they pay for it they want to run it and they want to tell people how to hire thing hire people and they want to say what the regulations are and these endless endless endless regulations so so look you know by the way when we talk about this protectionist thing the the trade thing where we feel that Trump is a little it's weird that he doesn't like free trade even though we understand the free trade sometimes cost jobs in one sector and while it creates wealth and other sectors there are places there are places where our trade policies have gone wrong in exactly the way the Trump says you know I I'm out here in Hollywood the special effects business which ten years ago was thriving here he's virtually gone and you know I don't want to say it's come to China China everything China but it has yeah and not only is it going to China it's gone to England and it's gone to Canada and the reason it's gone over to those places because they subsidize the work the government pays people money so they can charge us less so all these lefty Hollywood guys go off to Canada go off to England to do the special effects work and all the work goes away which by the way is illegal even according to the established rules of the trade but they just don't enforce it they don't enforce those things because they're so afraid of starting trouble those things can be renegotiated and enforced and they should be here I'm gonna have to say goodbye we're gonna have a great conversation about Christmas and god it's really gonna be interesting but you got to come over to the Daily wire now that I remember where I work they come over to the deli wire to hear it and while you're there subscribe and you can be part of the mailbag you can watch me you can watch your peer oh it will be great
