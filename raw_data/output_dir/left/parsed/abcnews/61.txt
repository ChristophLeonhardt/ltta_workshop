>>> MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR RIGHT 
NOW BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
ABOUT TO SPEAK IN LAS VEGAS IN 
THE AFTERMATH OF THAT MASS 
SHOOTING ON MONDAY.
THERE YOU SEE THE COMMAND CENTER
IN LAS VEGAS RIGHT NOW.
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE SURROUNDED
BY POLICE AND OTHER FIRST 
RESPONDERS, ELECTED OFFICIALS AS
WELL.
WE SPENT MUCH OF THE AFTERNOON 
IN LAS VEGAS.
HE'S MET WITH VICTIMS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES.
MEETING PRIVATELY WITH THEM AT 
THE HOSPITAL.
ONLY THE SECRET SERVICE IN THE 
ROOMS WITH HIM ALONG WITH THE 
FIRST LADY.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO MET WITH 
FIRST RESPONDERS.
HIS MESSAGE TODAY, HE TOLD THE 
PEOPLE OF LAS VEGAS, I AM WITH 
YOU 100%.
PROUD OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, 
SAID THE FACT THEY GOT THERE SO 
QUICKLY, GOT TO THE ROOM WITH 
STEPHEN PADDOCK SO QUICKLY SAVED
LIVES.
HE SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR, 
FAR WORSE.
THE PRESIDENT CALLING THE 
SHOOTER A SICK AND DEMENTED 
PERSON.
AS WE AWAIT THE PRESIDENT, I'M 
HERE WITH BRIAN ROSS.
BRIAN ROSS, AS THE PRESIDENT WAS
MEETING WITH FIRST RESPONDERS, 
INVESTIGATORS MEETING WITH 
STEPHEN PADDOCK'S GIRLFRIEND.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE'S BEEN INSIDE THE FBI OFFICE
IN LOS ANGELES FOR ABOUT TWO 
HOURS AND 15 MINUTES NOW.
SHE ARRIVED OVERNIGHT ON A 
FLIGHT FROM THE PHILIPPINES.
SHE HAD GONE THERE ABOUT TWO 
WEEKS BEFORE THE SHOOTING.
HER RELATIVES SAYING PADDOCK 
HIMSELF SENT HER THERE AND ONE 
SISTER OF HERS SAID HE SENT HER 
THERE SO SHE WOULDN'T BE IN THE 
WAY OF HIS PLANS.
MARYLOU DANLEY SAID SHE WOULDN'T
TALK TO THE FBI UNTIL SHE HAD A 
LAWYER.
AUTHORITIES HOPE SHE CAN UNRAVEL
THE MYSTERY OF THIS MAN, THEY'RE
STILL BAFFLED BY WHAT LED HIM TO
DO SUCH A HORRENDOUS THING.
ONE INDICATION IS THAT HE WAS A 
MAN DESCENDING INTO MADNESS WITH
SOME SERIOUS MENTAL ISSUES.
>> WE LEARNED HE BOUGHT 33 GUNS 
IN THE LAST YEAR.
>> EXACTLY, HE HAD BEEN PLANNING
THIS FOR SOME TIME, METICULOUSLY
PLANNING, CREATING A SORT OF 
ST
STOCKADE IN THAT ROOM.
>> THERE IS NEWS HE PERHAPS 
LOOKED AT ANOTHER CONCERT A WEEK
BEFORE.
>> AUTHORITIES ARE LOOKING AT 
WHETHER HE HAD A DRY RUN OR HE 
CHANGED HIS MIND.
THEY'RE STILL NOT CLEAR AND THEY
HOME THE FORMER GIRLFRIEND WHO 
HE MET AS A CASINO HOSTESS WILL 
BE ABLE TO UNRAVEL SOME OF THE 
MYSTERY.
NO ONE KNEW HIM BETTER THAN SHE 
DID.
>> SHE IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED 
AS A PERSON OF INTEREST, NOT A 
SUSPECT.
HER RELATIVES SAY SHE HAS A 
CLEAN CONSCIENCE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, SO FAR NO 
CHARGES AGAINST HER, NO 
INDICATION THEY SEE HER AS 
SOMEBODY WHO CAN JUST TELL THEM 
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE MIND OF
THE MAN.
>> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON
THAT ROOM, BUT TO SAY, OF 
COURSE, THE PRESIDENT COMING TO 
LAS VEGAS FOR THESE MEETINGS IN 
THE WAKE OF THAT VISIT TO PUERTO
RICO YESTERDAY.
>> EXACTLY RIGHT, GEORGE.
HE'S MADE A NUMBER OF STOPS HERE
ON THE GROUND SINCE HE AND THE 
FIRST LADY TOUCHED DOWN A COUPLE
HOURS AGO.
HE'S AT THAT COMMAND CENTER 
RIGHT NOW WHERE HE WRAPPED UP 
SPEAKING TO A ROOM OF FIRST 
RESPONDERS THANKING THEM FOR 
THEIR WORK.
WE'RE HEARING THE PRESIDENT KEEP
IN THAT SOMBER TONE THAT HE 
STRUCK ON MONDAY IN THE HOURS 
AFTER THE SHOOTING FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE THERE.
WHAT HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT AND 
HE'S BEEN ASKED POINT BLANK BY 
THE REPORTERS WHO ARE TRAVELING 
WITH HIM, ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS
A NEED FOR GUN CONTROL.
HE'S SO FAR AVOIDING THOSE 
QUESTIONS, SAYING THAT THAT'S A 
ONCONVERSATION WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE AT A DIFFERENT TIME.
HE WAS ALSO ASKED SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS SHOOTER TODAY, ASKED 
IF WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE 
MOTIVE IS YET, AND THE PRESIDENT
SAID NOT YET AS FAR AS HE CAN 
SAY.
YOU MENTIONED IT, GEORGE.
THERE'S A WORD THAT THE 
PRESIDENT KEEPS USING, A 
DEMENTED MAN, A VERY SICK MAN.
BUT REALLY THE FOCUS FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT HERE ON THE 
GROUND IN LAS VEGAS IS THESE 
VICTIMS.
IS THESE STORIES OF HEROISM.
HE'S FOCUSING ON THOSE RIGHT NOW
AND PRAISING THOSE FIRST 
RESPONDERS FOR THAT SPEEDY 
WORK OUT HERE ON THE GROUND.
>> GOVERNOR BRIAN SANDOVAL AT 
THE PODIUM.
>> THEIR BRAVERY, THEIR 
PROFESSIONALISM AND EVERYTHING 
THEY HAVE DONE FOR US MAKES ME 
SO PROUD AS GOVERNOR.
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND HOW 
THEY REACTED TO THE SITUATION, 
PROVIDED SO MUCH LOVE AND CARE 
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE HARMED BY 
THIS HORRIBLE INCIDENT.
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
THE MEN AND WOMEN AT ALL OUR 
HOSPITALS WHO CAME TO THE AID OF
ALL THESE PEOPLE.
THE EMPLOYEES AT MGM RESORTS AND
HOW THEY RESPONDED AS WELL, AND 
EVERYONE ELSE, PERFECT STRANGERS
AND HOW THEY RESPONDED TO THIS 
AND GAVE LOVE AND ASSISTANCE TO 
THEIR FELLOW MAN.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE 
FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND 
ACROSS THE WORLD FOR THEIR 
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT AND 
GENEROSITY THAT HAS COME HERE.
IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR 
HISTORY.
IT MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT 
ALONE AND GIVES US STRENGTH.
BRIEFLY, I ATTENDED A 
CANDLELIGHT VIGIL LAST NIGHT AT 
THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA.
IT WAS AN IMPROMPTU EVENT.
OVER 1,500 PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON 
VERY SHORT NOTICE.
WE ALL HELD CANDLES.
WE ALL HUGGED ONE ANOTHER.
WE HELD HANDS.
AND WE HELD THOSE FLAMES OUT IN 
FRONT OF US TO SHOW A TRIBUTE TO
THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES 
OF THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 
EVENT.
AND AT THAT MOMENT, DESPITE HOW 
DARK AND COLD IT WAS, I SAW AND 
WE ALL SAW THAT THE GREATEST 
DARKNESS CAN'T PUT OUT THE 
SMALLEST LIGHT.
AND WE COLLECTIVELY FELT FOR THE
FIRST TIME THE FIRST PANGS OF 
HOPE.
WE SAW THAT DESPITE THE SADNESS 
AND GRIEF ALL AROUND US THAT 
WE'RE RESILIENT AND WE'RE 
COMMITTED TO FIGHT AND RECOVER 
AND BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF 
HEALING.
AS NEVADANS WE HAVE A LONG 
HISTORY OF PULLING TOGETHER.
AND YES, WE'RE HURT.
WE'RE HURT BADLY.
BUT WE'RE NOT BROKEN.
AS I SAID, WE HAVE SEEN 
GENEROSITY ON A SCALE THAT IS 
UNPRECEDENTED IN NEVADA HISTORY.
WE KNOW, WE KNOW THAT WE WILL 
NEVER, EVER FORGET THIS HORRIFIC
EVENT.
BUT WE WILL MARCH FORWARD AS A 
FAMILY.
GIVEN EACH OTHER COMFORT, 
SUPPORT, AND LOVE.
THE FUTURE'S GOING TO COME ONE 
DAY AT A TIME.
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE HOW WE'RE 
GOING TO LIVE EACH DAY.
WE MUST BE GLAD.
WE MUST BE GOOD.
WE MUST BE BRAVE.
AND WE MUST HAVE FAITH.
AND WE WILL EMERGE AS A 
STRONGER, KINDER, BETTER STATE 
AND NATION.
SO GOD BLESS THE VICTIMS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES.
MAY THEY GIVE THEM PEACE.
GOD BLESS OUR GREAT STATE, AND 
GOD BLESS OUR NATION, THE 
GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.
AND WITH THAT, I'M VERY 
PRIVILEGED AND HONORED TO 
INTRODUCE THE FIRST LADY AND THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK THEM 
ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF 
NEVADA FOR TAKING THE TIME TO 
COME OUT HERE AND PROVIDE US 
THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR COMFORT 
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO BRING TO US.
SO WITH THAT, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, I WOULD LIKE TO 
INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT OF OUR 
GREAT NATION, DONALD TRUMP.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
GOVERNOR.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
AND I WILL TELL YOU THE PEOPLE 
OF NEVADA AND THE EXTRAORDINARY 
CITY HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD THEIR 
INCREDIBLE CHARACTER, COURAGE, 
AND RESOLVE.
NEVADA REALLY IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PLACE.
I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY AT 
THE LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, IN THE 
COMPANY OF HEROES.
THANK YOU TO OUR POLICE, OUR 
FIREFIGHTERS, AND TO OUR FIRST 
RESPONDERS, AND OF COURSE, TO 
SHERIFF LOMBARDO, INCREDIBLE JOB
YOU'VE DONE.
MAYOR GOODMAN.
HELLO, MAYOR GOODMAN.
>> I CAN'T BE BLOCKED BY 
ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL IN THE 
WORLD.
>> SENATOR HELLER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO, MAJORITY 
LEADER.
WHERE IS KEVIN, MAJORITY LEADER?
KEVIN McCARTHY.
ADAM, ALL OF THE GREAT 
CONGRESSMEN THAT WE HAVE WITH US
TODAY.
FROM BOTH PARTIES.
WE JUST ARE VERY HONORED THAT 
YOU COULD BE WITH US, AND ON 
BEHALF OF THE GRATEFUL NATION, 
MELANIA AND I THANK EACH AND 
EVERY ONE OF YOU IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT.
IN THE DEPTHS OF HORROR, WE WILL
ALWAYS FIND HOPE IN THE MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR 
OURS.
THE MASS MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT FILLS AMERICA'S 
HEART WITH GRIEF.
AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN 
MOURNING.
I VISITED THE HOSPITAL EARLIER 
TODAY WHERE MANY VICTIMS ARE 
STILL RECOVERING FROM THEIR 
WOUNDS, AND WE ASK GOD TO EASE 
THEIR SUFFERING AND TO SPEED 
THEIR HEALING.
WE PRAY FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE 
INJURED AND THOSE INJURED 
OFFICERS WHO SO BRAVELY THREW 
THEMSELVES INTO DANGER WHEN DUTY
CALLED.
AND WE GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THE 
LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL WHO 
WERE KILLED IN THIS VICIOUS 
ATTACK.
MANY FAMILIES TONIGHT WILL GO TO
BED IN A WORLD THAT IS SUDDENLY 
EMPTY.
THE PEOPLE THEY SO DEARLY LOVE 
WERE TORN AWAY FROM THEM 
FOREVER.
OUR SOULS ARE STRICKEN WITH 
GRIEF FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO 
LOST A HUSBAND OR A WIFE, A 
MOTHER OR A FATHER, A SON OR A 
DAUGHTER.
WE KNOW THAT YOUR SORROW FEELS 
ENDLESS.
WE STAND TOGETHER TO HELP YOU 
CARRY YOUR PAIN.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE.
HERE AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, 
WE REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN WHO 
DIED THIS WEEK.
CHARLES HARTFELT.
HE WAS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL 
PERSON.
OFFICER HARTFIELD WAS A PROUD 
VETERAN, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, A 
LOVING FATHER.
HIS DEATH IS A TRAGIC LOSS FOR 
THIS POLICE FORCE, FOR THIS 
CITY, AND FOR OUR GREAT NATION.
WE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORDS TO 
EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN HOW SUCH
EVIL CAN EXIST, HOW THERE CAN BE
SUCH CRUELTY AND SUCH SUFFERING.
BUT WE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE 
EVIL THAT THREATENS US OR THE 
VIOLENCE THAT INCITES SUCH 
TERROR.
WE'RE DEFINED BY OUR LOVE, OUR 
CARING, AND OUR COURAGE.
IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS, WHAT 
SHINES MOST BRIGHTLY IS THE 
GOODNESS THAT THRIVES IN THE 
HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE.
THAT GOODNESS IS OUR LIGHTHOUSE 
AND OUR SOLACE IS KNOWLEDGE THAT
THE SOULS OF THOSE WHO PASSED 
ARE NOW AT PEACE IN HEAVEN.
HERE ON EARTH, WE ARE BLESSED TO
BE SURROUNDED BY HEROES, AS ONE 
EYEWITNESS RECOUNTED THIS WEEK, 
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE WAS 
CROUCHING, POLICE OFFICERS WERE 
STANDING UP AS TARGETS, JUST 
TRYING TO DIRECT PEOPLE AND TELL
THEM WHERE TO GO.
THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING UP IN
THE LINE OF FIRE TO HELP THOSE 
IN DANGER AND TO FIND OUT WHERE 
THOSE HORRIBLE SHOTS WERE COMING
FROM.
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE 
BRAVERY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD 
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.
AMERICANS DEFIED DEATH AND 
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH 
WHEN THE WORST OF HUMANITY 
STRIKES, AND STRIKE IT DID, THE 
BEST OF HUMANITY RESPONDS.
PARENTS AND SPOUSES USE THEIR 
OWN BODIES AS SHIELDS TO PROTECT
THEIR LOVED ONES MUCH AMERICANS 
DASHED INTO A HAIL OF BULLETS TO
RESCUE TOTAL STRANGERS.
JOINING US TODAY ARE MANY OF THE
HEROES WHO WERE HERE DURING THAT
HORRIBLE MOMENT.
THAT HORRIBLE NIGHT.
INCLUDING LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN
POLICE OFFICERS, TYLER PETERSON 
AND TANA GURLEY.
OFFICER PETERSON WAS ON HIS 
SECOND DAY ON THE JOB WHEN THE 
SHOOTING BEGAN.
I JUST VISITED HIM IN THE 
HOSPITAL.
WITHIN MINUTES HE JOINED A GROUP
OF OFFICERS RUSHING BETWEEN 
FLYING BULLETS TO CLEAR THE FAIR
GROUND AND SAVE LIVES.
OFFICER GURLEY WAS OFF DUTY 
ATTENDING THE CONCERT, ALTHOUGH 
SHE WAS UNARMED AS SOON AS THE 
SHOOTING BEGAN SHE THREW ON A 
YELLOW POLICE VEST AND BEGAN 
EVACUATING THE VICTIMS.
AND AARON STALKER, A VETERAN, 
RUSHED TO THE SCENE TO SEARCH 
FOR HIS LOVED ONES.
WHEN HE COULDN'T FIND THEM, HE 
BEGAN HELPING EVERY PERSON HE 
COULD.
AS HE RECOUNTS, WE USED THE 
PLASTIC BARRIERS AS GURNEYS TO 
CARRY THE INJURED TO 
TRANSPORTATION.
I MADE SPLINTS OUT OF WHATEVER I
COULD FIND AND USED ANYTHING TO 
STOP THE HORRIBLE BLEEDING.
AMONG THE WOUNDED WAS THE MOTHER
OF AARON'S GIRLFRIEND.
SHE IS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL AND
WE ARE ALL PULLING FOR HER.
TO EVERY HERO WE HELPED, EVERY 
HERO SAVED SO MANY LIVES.
AND BELIEVE ME, A GRATEFUL 
NATION THANKS YOU.
THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHOSE FINAL
ACT WAS TO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES 
FOR THOSE THEY LOVED, SHOULD 
INSPIRE ALL OF US TO SHOW MORE 
LOVE EVERY DAY FOR THE PEOPLE 
WHO GRACE OUR LIVES.
IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, WE WILL ALL
HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THE HORROR 
OF WHAT HAS UNFOLDED THIS WEEK, 
BUT WE WILL STRUGGLE THROUGH IT 
TOGETHER.
WE WILL ENDURE THE PAIN 
TOGETHER, AND WE WILL OVERCOME 
TOGETHER AS AMERICANS.
MAY GOD BLESS AND WATCH OVER 
THOSE WHO PROTECT US.
MAY GOD BRING HEALING TO THE 
FAMILIES OF THE WOUNDED, THE 
INJURED AND THE FALLEN.
AND MAY GOD BLESS OUR GREAT 
COUNTRY, AMERICA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU GOVERNOR, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
>> PRAISE FROM THE PRESIDENT FOR
THE FIRST RESPONDERS, LAS VEGAS 
POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS, OTHER 
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, SAYS HE'S 
IN THE COMPANY OF HEROES TODAY, 
OFFERING CONSOLATION TO THE 
VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
SAYS ALL OF AMERICA IS IN 
MOURNING.
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CALLED 
UPON TO PROVIDE CONSOLATION TO 
BE ON THE GROUND IN THE WAKE OF 
NATURAL DISASTERS, IN THE WAKE 
OF THIS HORRIBLE SHOOTING AND 
CECILIA VEGA, ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE SAW THERE.
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM 
PUERTO RICO YESTERDAY, THE 
PRESIDENT STICKING TO THE 
SCRIPT, SOMBER WORDS.
>> WHAT A MONTH IT HAS BEEN FOR 
THIS PRESIDENT, AS YOU 
MENTIONED, COMING HERE DIRECTLY 
FROM PUERTO RICO, AFTER TEXAS, 
AFTER FLORIDA, THIS IS A VERY 
DIFFERENT TONE THAT WE ARE 
HEARING FROM THIS PRESIDENT 
TODAY.
WE ARE A NATION IN MOURNING.
THIS IS THE JOB OF PRESIDENTS.
THIS IS THE CONSOLER IN CHIEF, 
THE COMFORTER IN CHIEF IF YOU 
WILL, HE SAYS IT IS IN THE 
GOODNESS IN PEOPLE THAT IS OUR 
LIGHTHOUSE, SO TRYING TO INSPIRE
SOME HOPE HERE, AND WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY LEAVE 
HERE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES
THEY WILL GO ON AIR FORCE ONE 
AND HEAD BACK TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, WHERE NOW THE NEXT STEP 
FOR THIS PRESIDENT WILL BE TO 
HAVE TO TAKE ON THIS ISSUE OF 
GUN CONTROL.
AND IN THE LAST FEW DAYS THIS IS
NOT AN ISSUE THAT THIS WHITE 
HOUSE HAS BEEN WILLING TO TALK 
ABOUT, IT'S PREMATURE TO 
POLITICIZE THIS ISSUE, WHILE 
THIS INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
GOING ON RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME, 
RIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING HE'S GOING TO
BE ABLE TO AVOID.
WE SAW PROTESTS BY DEMOCRATS ON 
CAPITOL HILL, AND IF THE TALKING
POINTS THAT ABC NEWS HAS SEEN AT
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS FLOATING 
AROUND RIGHT NOW, IS ANY 
INDICATION OF WHICH WAY THIS 
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT GO, YOU 
KNOW, THEY SAY NEW LAWS WON'T 
STOP MAD MEN.
SO PERHAPS THAT'S A SIGN OF 
THINGS TO COME, CERTAINLY THIS 
IS A DEBATE THAT WAGES ON, AND 
IT'S IN THE LAP OF THIS 
PRESIDENT.
>> A DESCRIPTION BY THE 
PRESIDENT CALLING HIM SICK AND 
DEMENTED.
MATT HAS BEEN THERE SINCE EARLY 
THIS MORNING.
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T SAY 
ANYTHING ABOUT THE GUNMAN IN 
THAT SETTING RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LEARNED MUCH 
MORE ABOUT HIS FINAL 48 HOURS IN
THAT HOTEL.
AND THE METICULOUS PLANNING THAT
WENT INTO THIS MASSACRE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE, WE KNOW
THAT IN ADDITION TO THE 23 
FIREARMS, THAT THOUSANDS OF 
ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, HE SET UP 
AT LEAST TWO SURVEILLANCE 
CAMERAS, HE MAY HAVE HAD A 
TABLET DEVICES HE WAS ABLE TO 
MONITOR.
THE POINT WAS TO MONITOR THE 
APPROACH OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE 
SAW, NINE MINUTES INTO THE 
SHOOTING, WHEN A SECURITY GUARD 
FROM THE HOTEL APPROACHED THE 
DOOR, HE SHOT HIM THROUGH THE 
DOOR, THAT WAS KEY.
OFFICIALS ARE HERALDING THAT 
SECURITY GUARD AS A HERO, 
ALERTING THEM, TELLING THEM 
WHERE THE SHOOTER WAS, SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER, THE SHOOTING 
STOPPED.
HE'S BEING CREDITED WITH 
STOPPING THIS.
NOW, WE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT HIS 
MOVEMENTS WITHIN THE HOTEL.
SOURCES TELLING US HE HAD 
GAMBLED THE NIGHT BEFORE THE 
SHOOTING, SPENDING EIGHT HOURS 
PLAYING HIGH STAKES POKER.
MAYBE NOT UNUSUAL FOR A GAMBLER 
WHO'S THERE FOR A WEEKEND, BUT 
CERTAINLY UNUSUAL FOR SOMEONE 
WHO'S ABOUT TO PERPETRATE SUCH A
HEINOUS ACT.
>> THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> WE KNOW A LOT MORE NOW ABOUT 
HOW THIS WAS CARRIED OUT, STILL 
NOTHING ON WHY.
>> AGENTS ARE STUMPED.
THEY REALLY HOPE THE INTERVIEW 
THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT AT THIS 
MOMENT IN LOS ANGELES WITH HIS 
ONE TIME GIRLFRIEND WILL PROVIDE
CLUES THEY NEED.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
I KNOW ALL OF YOU WILL BE 
JOINING DAVID MUIR IN LAS VEGAS 
TONIGHT.
ALL OF YOU AT HOME CAN GET THE 
LATEST BREAKING NEWS ALERTS ANY 
TIME BY DOWNLOADING THE ABC NEWS
APP.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW ON GMA.
