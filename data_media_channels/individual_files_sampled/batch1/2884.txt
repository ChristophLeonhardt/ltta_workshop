all right so let's start off with today today's news this morning NBC fired Matt Lauer 24 hours after learning about some incident that we know about Charlie Rose was fired in 24 hours Fox News famously had a relatively long period it seemed with a lot of folks who were accused of similar things before they departed the company does this make you rethink that at all no well first of all say and with Matt Matt Lauer and I don't know anything more than what we've all seen read or watched the headlines this morning and it's important I think for us all take perspective from the outside looking in around any allegation or investigation that a company has and certainly we've lived through this for the last year and a half is that the fact set of these allegations or whether there's being harassment or not can be very different in very different cases which the headlines don't know we're show so a harassment case or claim against one person and one one situation versus someone else might be concluding different situations and also might be much more difficult for a company to act on now presumably here in NBC's case they've had actionable information that they were able to move very quickly and you've got to commend them for that and it's a terrific sign to see the companies moving that quickly to - I'm eradicate if that's ever possible we hope it is sexual harassment in the workplace but with with Fox News for instance it took us 13 days from the time we had the first we learned of the first allegation against Roger Ailes until the time we should've walked him out of the building and so you know I'm not sure when an NBC first we don't know when NBC first heard this this allegation but certainly I think 13 days by historical standards removing a CEO of a business I think it was a pretty good tracker and with Bill O'Reilly seem that there was a private settlement that he was then allowed to continue him things changed around that no so what happened for us is that I'm again you have to look at the facts and the facts that's around the Roger Ailes situation and and the Bill O'Reilly situation you know appeared very different and still appear to be still are factually different with with Roger Ailes what we were able to do is going we hired an independent law firm us our outside law firm to work for us and I'm not technically any better but work for us to go in and investigate all the allegations which included speaking to speak no time to with the women involved corroborating their stories getting them you know firsthand our corroboration from when the harassment was claimed to have happened so a really very rigorous investigation where we were able to talk to our employees and gain the fact that we needed to act upon that right and and to exit an executive with Bill O'Reilly that was a very different in that there were private settlements that have happened in the past the wouldn't the company had never had a complaint and the private settlement precluded anyone from from talking to us so we had a complete inability to actually dig into the story and to him to find out what had actually happened once however these claims became public and we were aware of them what we were able to do was change his contract and say that yeah and you know if there was any further allegations that are that arose we could fire them for calls immediately which is what we did and in Fox and more generally is it now no longer okay that someone could have a private settlement where their gag orders on the other side and still stay at work I mean is that is that the company's business it yes that's that's what it should be you should not have situations where and what we do as well and this is the this is the disappointing thing is that we have you know very strong you know HR departments we now having you with a global head of HR and so that the the local HR departments don't in these situations don't talk to their local management they should come straight up to the senior management and ultimately if the situation looks serious to my brother or myself and we also have hotlines throughout the company we have a you know a number of an anonymous hotlines and and and for for complaints or for people if they want of them to go on the record with us about a complaint so these are important mechanisms that you need people to trust and to use so that we can then act on that and if people don't use that it's very hard for the for the information to filter up the weekend of them that we can you know take advantage of let's talk about other recent news I was met an executive the other night who was worked with you and your family and the company for a long time he that's before sorry sorry Henry before I think the fundamental thing no can we talk about the headlines and these are juicy media stores it's so important no I think this has been a fantastic thing and frankly we should all see those are very a very good year because it is completed completely unacceptable for from Menem and particularly well unfortunately were seeing powerful men you know to to have an allow or engage in harassment in the workplace and the fact that we're going through this sort of cathartic moment not just in media but as we see throughout all of society and all sort of business and elsewhere I think it's a tremendous thing and I think we come out of this as a community you know far far stronger you're here other news recently I saw a friend an executive former executive of the company he said I never ever thought that the Murdock's would ever consider selling anything and now here we're reading that you may sell half of your crown jewel the company what's changed you know a backstage hangout we're just talking about our children we both have 13 year olds and my 13 year old was tell me though today how the one thing is disappointed with going into middle school was the schoolyard gossip and and so you know a lot of our rumors and speculation can't get out there that aren't necessarily true and so my advice to him and my advice to myself is let's not feed that gossip and that speculation and that's worth you know a long-standing policy of the company so we're not going to talk about the stuff that's bubbling out there in the media and and in in sort of Hollywood hallways but um but you know the reality is what this is cause this speculation that we might ever sell a part of our business this is caused a debate around scale in the media and you know when I look at scale we've been saying I've said on stages like this over last you know a couple years that absolutely there are sub scale businesses in in media today which will be the losers going forward in a digital world and that that's absolutely the case if you have if you haven't invested in your programming and your channel so you have an investigate and best in your sort of a distribution distribution platforms you you are unlikely to get on the new digital services and and you'll subscale you'll really struggle we don't believe we're in that situation and we can demonstrable point to you know growing affiliate fee growth I think we'll one of you may be the only company in America is growing sort of a large media companies that's growing subscribers actually net subscribers across our channels because of our our mix of younger cable channels um so we feel very well I'll talk about it more in a few minutes but we feel very strongly about where we're positioned to grow the company as a standalone company and yet it is the job of analysts and others to evaluate schoolyard gossip as you put it and one of the very strong media analysts said about the reports that you might sell half of 21st Century Fox this makes quote immense sense so if we go the other way on that if you don't sell them the analysts would say makes less sense so can you shed some light on what he is seeing and and and to do reports so the reports are that you're considering selling your stake in sky the satellite controls pay TV in Europe and you are UK rather National Geographic effects the film and the TV studio your site hilt of Hulu keeping Fox Sports Fox News and box broadcast hypothetically what would be the reasoning there like why would that make amends sense so again I'm not going to comment on the exact speculation but what's happening so you're you are and then the reason I analysts are saying they'll be consolidation in the industry right in the industry is you know if you look at what's happened at digital so as the cable universe is declining that the traditional cable universe is declining in the United States at a pace which is slowed a little bit of around overall and traditional cable to two and a half percent if that continues obviously cable affiliate fees are the key drivers for you know the big American media companies a little bit less fresca we have such a big international business but still in our US business are you know very important area of revenue so what's happening though is the new digital MVPD so the YouTube YouTube YouTube TV which is a tremendous service the new Hulu Live service which is the DMV PD service not the it's video on-demand service but the the television service the live television service these are beginning to grow tremendously and it's very early days but they're now significantly in them in the sort of mid hundreds of thousands of subscribers when you aggregate them YouTube TV advertised for the first time in a significant way in the World Series and it tremendously will added a huge number of subscribers so it's very early days of this now we see in that traditional as a traditional cable business is declining absolutely they're our subscriber growth is being the declines being and ameliorated by this digital growth now here's the key though you have to be on those digital MVPD packages and those packages are only valuable and they're out to subscribers if the cheaper than the current loaded cable bundle and so to be in that core bundle you need to be have core channels that people want and so our investment in in in in Fox in Fox News in FX in National Geographic in Fox Sports which mean tremendous consolidation of our programming market investment in those five core brands has resulted in those brands being on every single one of the significant new digital MVPDs you can't say that for other companies um you can't say for a Viacom right you can't say for ane you can't say for discovery and they'll have to have a come up with a separate strategy but for us we're seeing them our investment in these core brands really starting to pay off and you know I mean that will be you know winners and in the new world going forward and you talked about YouTube TV and somebody over the top solutions which are really incredible when you when you get it and it's early early days like we're the first you know the first of the starting block of this new industry and our people within them watching television are they actually using it are they using it as a DVD player or so the services are all different and this is this is the other I think exciting thing because they're marketing to different types of people so for instance I'm sling is really marketing itself or or or direct to be now it's called really marketing people that are court cutters that are coming off of the traditional services and they're trying to replicate a traditional to spin down effectively a traditional MVPD customer YouTube TV is is there is a assortment of the the core live channel so do you know the top 40 or 50 cable channels and local TV that you want to uh that you'd want to watch right so how do you get the lowest price for the highest of ratings right a highest interest YouTube is a sorry um who's a little bit different but they're both Hulu TV or who live you also get the S VOD service so there's no video on demand service on YouTube TV but bundled into the ins five dollars more expensive bundled into the Hulu service you get video on demand and people who are picking up are very much even though they're younger right this is cool younger they're very tech savvy but they're watching a lot of the same shows that you expect the broader audience to watch so let's talk about Fox News a little bit a little bit more is Fox News fair and balanced I look I think you've gotta look at Fox News is the New York Times fair and balanced and I think you've got to look at the news organization and the opinion organization and just like the New York Times has a news organization their rights are for the front page they also have an editorial board their rights their opinion pieces and you know one of the reasons why the New York Times is such a well-respected newspaper and a very fine newspaper is that you know their opinion is also very strong and and there is clearly a direction and opinion for that speaks to their their readers and it's the same at Fox News and so the news organization is completely different construct and reporting lines to the opinion pieces and I think that's I think it's appropriate for news and and what is the opinion section represent is this a Murdoch family view of the world ya know it okay it's absolutely there there was a gap on the you know center-right of the market a lot of the media so laughter Center laughter you want to call it very well there's a lot of competition there you know Fox News is found and found a market and antiquity to the right and and certainly in the opinion pieces and that's um that's certainly that's the strategy although I've got to say when Fox News was started there's a common misconception which is that if you look at how we've launched media businesses over you know my father has over 60 years and you have to remember back to CNN you know 30 years ago how state it was and how how static was that the the the opening for Fox News is actually the energy the pace the graphics you know the production values of the channel which now everyone is copied so it doesn't look as unique but back when I launched it was a it was quite revolutionary and when you hear people refer to Fox News as quote state TV how's that make you feel like yeah the right guy because I don't think that's true I don't think that's true and I don't think any media organization should be behind an individual all right you me behind ideals or concepts you can be behind whether you think um your viewers want lower taxes or you know higher employment and there are certain things that um that you can you can principles that you're either your readers or that are important your readers or your viewers that are important and should be important to the organization and particularly in the on the opinion side but you should never get behind an individual because in the individual individuals on can be fallible right so and that's an important thing and I think if you look at Fox News across the whole Bay part and Fox News is now the only channel so I think 20 22 hours there's 20 hours live in the 24 hour cycle and you look at our Shepard Smith I think you know you can't say the Shepard Smith is behind the predictors their president so it's definitely clear delineation there between the news and and the op-ed the James your brother spoke last year I think about wanting a diversity of voices on the networks would you ever hire a left-wing op-ed my boys I don't think they were do well necessarily with with so rachel maddow yum it would be bad for her and probably bad for us if we hired her on we could we could offer her all the money in the world but you know since she lose her audience which is a very strong audience you've worked very hard to get at MSNBC and good luck to her I should have a smaller audience on Fox News just because of you know the the nature of all audience and what they're interested in so you've got to be careful with me changing the format too much and would you ever if CNN were to become available in the negotiations with the Justice Department about the ATT Time Warner thing would you ever consider buying CNN no we couldn't oh we wouldn't be allowed to and when we know me shouldn't be allowed to so absolutely not okay a former editor and the company said about your father he runs in his veins he is a news guy your dad's famous for walking into the newsroom and cozying up to journalists and saying you're not gonna believe what I hear heard you but Lachlan and James their entertainment driven is that fair I think I think both James and I we've grown up in newsrooms right we understand journalism and we understand the importance of it and by the way if something is you know very sincerely and deeply under threat at the moment a phone from a business model how people are you can afford you know great investigative journalism and I sat down some of this some stuff we would go back to the sexual harassment cases it's fantastic to see some of these newspapers I mean the more and more cases a case in point where Washington Post has done a huge amount of investigative journalism that they can stand up to you know to them to to raise allegations against people and so when when when news organizations can remain there can retain the resources to do really excellent and really important in our democracy investigative journalism that's something we have to fight for and I know the next couple days is you interview some of the the Internet and social media giant is someone base should really be thinking about because if we lose that ability for investigative journalism in this country and around the world it's a terrible thing for all of us as individuals as well and we've already lost it on the local you know I'm told if you go to Albany in New York there's not a lot of journalists covering over there certainly not anywhere near the amount that used to be some ten years ago so it's a significant issue and so whether James and I are I think I think we have a very strong journalism base in understanding these organizations but we're also running businesses that are you know are you know hugely invested in entertainment as well and and we're really at the beginning of your regime if you follow in your father's footsteps you have another forty five years at least ahead of you what more change can we see in the new regime like where do you and James agree about where you're headed but we're gonna continue to expand globally I think we're one of the only companies that we don't see the businesses a domestic business and an international business that's the biggest mistake anyone can make we're on planes all the time we see our business in India and not only as a as important as our US business but frankly more important in many ways star TV in India and people don't realize this is it is an incredible rounded media business on its own it's not a it's not a satellite television provider it's a media company that produces 17,000 hours of local content in seven languages not including in English there's a little bit of English it they also produce or eight languages including English you know that's just entertainment content 17,000 hours we own low blow rights to that content we'll make 500 million dollars this year in EBIT ah out of Star TV growing to a billion dollars neighbor dog by calendar 2020 so it's huge growth business for us around the world the sky is another case important and by the way these are all businesses that we started right and so when we see ourselves as out whether it's entertainment or in journalism we very much see ourselves as underdogs who like to come into a market offer choice whether it's again in journalism or entertainment and and sort of break up the status quo and that's where we in most successful if you were to suddenly come into a huge pool of money from the divestiture of some assets or even just to borrow capital what would you invest in I mean you're famous for having built so many of the Fox networks from scratch you know all media companies right are gonna be direct consumer right so whether it's you know in the next few months and we'll see more launches in next few months and over the next couple years every single media company will have direct to consumer products and ultimately everything will be available direct consumer so if I see what's the big change what's happening is it that the media business model is bit from a Content point of view hired from a Content point of view the media business model is based on 1950s technology and you might say it was slightly altered in the 70s with the with the growth of cable and pay television but it's really 1950s technology where we sell our rights historically exclusively to Windows across different technological platforms and that's that's terrible for its outdated and it's frankly it's terrible for the consumer so what you'll see is you'll see a media content being sold non-exclusively across multiple platforms but in a way the consumer can can access our our product where there's a a new movie or new TV shows you know when and where they want it and you know for an affordable price and not with these crazy blackout periods and crazy exclusivity that the consumer that just doesn't make sense to consumer anymore and speaking of film and television just as BuzzFeed and any other companies building these incredible studio capabilities wanting to get into television make long-form and so forth I hear that you may be considering selling the Fox television film studios why would you do that long-term believers in the TV studio and particularly the prophets in the in the television studio are you know are growing and I think will continue to grow Netflix has for a long time you know being to buy up a lot of content from from all the Hollywood TV studios if you actually look and for all the kind of the talk around Netflix is you know eight billion dollars worth of a production they they're there look they're self produced content on Netflix is like less than a fifth of the viewing right the other four-fifths comes from the big studios right and and that's been very profitable and for us to sell them but it's not it's also not the best model for them to run in the day so we'll still sell the Netflix but we want to be non lucidly on all the other platforms as well come Banda if you talk about you talk about a TV studio and the film studio so a film that model has to change this all you know the film studio the film distribution tactical distribution model is also outdated and we had them think James might have touched on the slightly last year but we have but we make a movie like Kingsman to write the Golden Circle will spend about a hundred and fifty million dollars in the production of that movie and then we'll spend another hundred million dollars in the launch domestically and global for marketing that movie see if a two hundred and fifty million dollar creative best right that you just you push out and and yeah then as a city story goes to these different windows that you monetize what's crazy at the moment it goes into theaters for about forty five days and then the theaters by contract have a forty five-day blackout well you're not allowed to show that to anyone before you go on to you know cable or video on demand and that's where thing and that has to collapse right there's no reason why particularly if the weight of the the marketing you know why the consumer should suddenly not be allowed and that's not be allowed to get the content in the only place they get it is actually from the piracy sites so movie theatrical windows will also will collapse then will collapse quickly Lachlan that's all the time we have thank you so much great to Hank Aaron thanks everybody
