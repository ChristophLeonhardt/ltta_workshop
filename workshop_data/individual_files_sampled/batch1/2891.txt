sometimes it's very hard to pick yourself up sometimes we are in a in a place that we have no control we can't seem to find control we're not connected to what the company is doing we don't understand what the whole goal of the company is and that's time to just quit just commit suicide now it's time to realize that not all jobs have the same appeal to everybody and you know motivation is one of those things that everybody benefits from so imagine that you're working in a company in you're just miserable you're miserable and you're not contributing on the other hand if you work in a company that you're happy you're happy and you're contributing more everybody everybody benefits if you're stuck in a situation where you say you know I'm just I just can't find happiness here I'm just here from paycheck to paycheck and that's the only reason for being here it's probably not a good reason to stay you should probably try to find something else now if you move to a very similar job and you hope that in this new job just because we change it things will be different it's kind of just hopeful thinking what you're thinking so the question is what kind of job should you look for to try and find meaning and happiness in something that you would still be doing but will be different from what you've tried and failed
