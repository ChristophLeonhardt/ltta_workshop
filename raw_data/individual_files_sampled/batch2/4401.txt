my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country America's so true didn't expect that reaction but that's okay that was the sound of the world literally laughing at Trump his claim in an address to the UN General General Assembly that the administration has accomplished more than any other in history causing a stir among the world leaders and top diplomats in the crowd but the puffery didn't end there the president went on to boast about America's strength and power touting his commitment to an America first foreign policy and rebuking globalism his at times aggressive message drying head shakes at the UN as the AP reports joining us at the table NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell so I want to deal with the elephant in the room which was that I worked for a president who sometimes came to the UN GA where there were a lot of disagreements about extraordinary renditions or about the war in Iraq or about Nance interrogation and those were policy differences but he was never scoffed I mean he took that speech seriously it was written by serious foreign policy advisors like Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell and others and and New York Times is reporting that Steven Miller his immigration and liner wrote this speech today it seems like it doesn't seem like an overstatement to call it a disgrace it was very very awkwardly written and you had the President of the United States coming and saying we're being taken advantage of and from now on we're going to give foreign aid only to countries that helped us rejecting the line he was speaking to a global assembly of people who are there because they believe in burden-sharing in helping each other in getting each other out of crises not cutting the peacekeeping money that the US has cut not cutting all o UN Palestinian refugee a zero doubt and expecting the Palestinians to come back to the table crawl back to the table after you've pummeled them even rejecting the appeals of wrong Lauder you know former Pentagon official in the Reagan administration the head of the World Jewish Congress pleading with them not to start taking money away from Lutheran hospitals in East Jerusalem in Arab East Jerusalem which they have done so they have turned their back on Canada no meeting with Justin Trudeau he criticized Angela Merkel and had no unkind words no words about Vladimir Putin when Theresa May was giving a speech today about scruple and about the chemical use of chemical weapons and you know a nerve agent turnings back on Europe certainly no Middle East peace plan from the son-in-law and we've yet to see any progress and this is why because he came to the UN and said we've been taking advantage of we don't believe in these global deals we don't believe in world trade and from now on every country for itself but oh by the way we don't like the way you're running a regime in Iran with good reason we don't like what's happening in Venezuela which is a disgrace and let's get together and you know do something about those governments it made absolutely no sense we spend a lot of time here and I know you do too talking about the obliteration of norms but never do you see on full display what that looks like for all of us I mean in in in this country we sort of we talk about him in his 35 to 37 percent hardcore base but when he stands on the stage at the UN he is for better for worse all of our president and that seems to be where things fell apart today you're talking about he is his I guess idea logical underpinning on on aiding other countries is what do they do for us I mean it's not a it's not a campaign slogan a lot of foreign aid is is to secure our national security to help people with less than us who do we talk too much do we make too much of these alleged guardrails it doesn't sound like any of the guardrails got a copy of today's speech well it it gets lost in the swamp of threats counter threats the threats against Iran now let's give credit where credit is due and I am reluctant to do this because of all of the US intelligence which contradicts it but he's no longer calling Kim Jong on rocket man he's no longer saying we can destroy you if it becomes necessary he's talking about a second summit I don't think the first one was warranted but better that they're talking than hurling missiles at each other and so perhaps that could lead to something the intelligence is that Kim jong-un has not started either disclosing his weapons inventory dismantling them or permitting verification the three demands that a very smart guy secretary Pompeo made when he was put in charge of this very difficult negotiation so there is that it's no longer fire and fury against North Korea and Iran it's now just around hey there are Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click
