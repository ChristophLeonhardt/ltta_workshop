there was some booing in there but they're really cheering for him and they're cheering for him because you're coming up to the national anthem of course the NFL which you know I've always loved I love football I love watching the NFL I have a hard time following the college rankings that's why I don't follow college football so I avoid follow the NFL they are tanking and they are now in a very exciting postseason and nobody is watching their ratings are further down than ever and I like you know I say that I'm boycotting them but it's not quite true I didn't make a decision and say until they stand up for the flag I'm gonna boycott them I just the heart went out of me I don't want to watch a game you know this is America's game the NFL baseball these are these are American games I don't want to watch a game where they just the flag I just don't want to do it I can't I cannot bring my heart to like focus on the game when these guys look I disagree with their protests but that's not the problem they have the right to the protest they have the right to their opinion but that's not the way you do it because what they're asking for are American rights so don't this the American flag what you're asking me to kick you're asking me to care about you as a fellow American don't diss the American flag it's it's self destructive it's not helping your own cause what kills me about this though is the NFL gets together and they're thinking why are our ratings dropping what is it you know it must be injuries it's injuries to our big players like Aaron Rodgers and all this stuff and one guy says a director of the University of Alabama sports communication program I'd be stunned if any single factor contributed more than two percent to the ratings decline and now a new survey finds that 33 percent of NL fans have boycotted the league because of the flag I mean what the thing I'm trying to get to is we now live in a world of two realities reality and the news we live in a world of which these in which these people you know who give us the news who give us entertainment who give us Hollywood they give us Handmaid's Tale they give us football they do all this stuff they are living in a reality that is just them talking to each other and the rest of are living in the real world the rest of us are living in the real world these guys can not believe that they are destroying their brand by letting these guys diss the flag and again it's not about their protests they have the right to their opinions like their political opinions just like you and me that's not the point the point is you don't diss the flag because that represents all of us in all political stripes of all political stripes of all political opinions you don't diss the flag I mean that's it's so so basic and nobody wants to watch you make a million dollars throwing a ball around if you're not going to respect the country that is supporting you
