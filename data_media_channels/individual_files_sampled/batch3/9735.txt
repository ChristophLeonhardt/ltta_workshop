AND WE WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS. THAT AND MORE AND ARE VERY IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS OPENING MONOLOGUE. AS WE SPEAK, THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO IS IN THE AIR WITH THREE RELEASED AMERICAN HOSTAGES WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK THANKFULLY TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER SPENDING MONTHS INSIDE HARD LABOR PRISON CAMPS ACROSS NORTH KOREA. THIS WAS A MAJOR DIPLOMATIC WIN FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR NORTH KOREA. MOST IMPORTANT, THREE AMERICAN LIVES THANKFULLY WERE SAVED. NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN IS NOW MOVING FORWARD, AS PLANNED. TAKE A LOOK. I APPRECIATE KIM JONG UN DOING THIS AND ALLOWING THEM TO GO. WE PICKED A TIME. WE PICKED A PLACE FOR THE MEETING. OR SUMMIT, AS YOU LIKE TO CALL IT. I THINK IT WILL BE VERY SUCCESSFUL, BUT AS I ALWAYS SAY, WHO KNOWS. WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT. AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NOBODY THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR YEARS OR MORE. WHERE IS THE SUMMIT GOING TO TAKE PLACE? WE WILL ANNOUNCE THAT WITHIN THREE DAYS. WE ARE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS. DO YOU DESERVE THE NOBEL PRIZE, DO YOU THINK? EVERYONE THINKS SO BUT I WON'T SAY IT. I WANT TO GET IT FINISHED. THE PRIZE I WANT IS VICTORY FOR THE WORLD, NOT FOR EVEN HERE. I WANT VICTORY FOR THE WORLD BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S THE ONLY PRIZE I WANT. Sean: 88 HAS BEEN SET FOR THE UPCOMING MEETING BETWEEN TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN AND WE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE DETAILS AS WE GET THEM HERE LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS, IT'S NO ACCIDENT. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK THE REINS FROM BARACK OBAMA, LITTLE ROCKET MAN WAS LAUNCHING BALLISTIC MISSILES OVER JAPAN. HE WAS THREATENING GUAM, THREATENING THE REST OF THE WORLD. OF COURSE, TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS LEFT AND RIGHT AND OF COURSE BALLISTIC MISSILES. NOW ALL OF THESE AGGRESSIVE TACTICS TO HAVE ENDED. AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT. THIS, THANKS TO THE HARD WORK, NEGOTIATING SKILLS OF THE PRESIDENT AND HIS BRAND-NEW SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO. AFTER TIGHTENING SANCTIONS, DEVELOPING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA AND THREATENING TO INTRODUCE NEW TARIFFS, SENDING MULTIPLE CARRIER STRIKE GROUPS TO THE REGION, AND BERATING KIM JONG UN ON THE WORLD STAGE, THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR IS NOW LIMPING TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. IT IS ON THE TERMS THE UNITED STATES SET. WAIT, HANG ON. REMEMBERS A FEW MONTHS AGO YOUR CORRUPT MEDIA WAS TELLING YOU DONALD TRUMP WAS LEADING US TO A NUCLEAR WAR WITH NORTH KOREA. HOW COULD THEY EVER GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRONG? TYPICAL. TAKE A LOOK. THE IDEA OF A NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN WITH NORTH KOREA KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT, I WOULD RECOMMEND DELETING YOUR TWITTER APP. NOT MERELY BEING CAVALIER WITH THE THREAT ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR. HE'S BEEN CAVALIER IN A WAY THAT MAKES HIM SEEM DEMENTED. THESE ARE THE MESSAGES FROM A PERSON WHO IS NOT WELL, FROM A LEADER WHO IS NOT FIT FOR OFFICE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOADING KIM JONG UN TO TEST A NUCLEAR MISSILE AGAIN, TO PROVE ITS RELIABILITY, TO SHOW HIM WRONG. FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK IT COMES ACROSS AS TWO KINDERGARTNERS WHO ARE JOSTLING EACH OTHER, EXCEPT THAT EACH HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. TOO LATE AFTER 100,000 AMERICANS DIE. AFTER A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST. OR AFTER A MILLION DIE. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION. EXPERTS ARE WORRIED HE COULD INADVERTENTLY TRIGGER A CATASTROPHE. Sean: THE TYPICAL MEDIA BARRAGE DIDN'T END WELL OR AGE WELL. I ONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, ARE THEY GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE HYSTERICAL COVERAGE, JUST LIKE THEIR PHONY RUSSIAN COVERAGE, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE I GET WRONG? IT'S UNLIKELY BECAUSE JUST YESTERDAY, YES, "THE NEW YORK TIMES," THE PAPER OF RECORD, THEY ACTUALLY SLAMMED SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO BECAUSE HE WAS ABSENT DURING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL ANNOUNCEMENT. THEN THEY FOUND OUT HE WAS ACTUALLY NORTH KOREA RESCUING AND SAVING AMERICAN HOSTAGES. SOMETHING BARACK OBAMA COULD NEVER GET DONE. TRUMP RESPONDED TWO HOURS AGO ON TWITTER, HE WROTE: "THE FEELING "NEW YORK TIMES" CRITICIZE THE SECRETARY OF STATE, POMPEO, FOR BEING MISSING, WHEN HE WAS FLYING TO NORTH KOREA. FAKE NEWS SO BAD." WE WILL GET BACK TO THE ABUSIVELY BIASED MEDIA IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST WE ARE ALSO FOLLOWING VERY CLOSELY A DEVELOPING SITUATION INSIDE OF IRAN. THE IDF IS REPORTING THAT ISRAEL'S ABLE TO INTERCEPT MULTIPLE ROCKETS FIRED BY IRANIAN SOURCES FROM A SYRIAN SYRIAN-BASED. NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A HIGH-RANKING ISRAELI OFFICIAL WHO IS NOW CONFIRMED TO ME THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO ISRAEL'S MILITARY ACTIONS, AND IN FACT I HAVE CONFIRMATION ISRAEL TONIGHT NOT LONG AGO HAS RETALIATED. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF THAT IN THE MOMENT WITH COLONEL OLIVER NORTH. YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE IMPORTANT DECISION TO PULL AMERICA OUT OF THE INCREDIBLY FLAWED IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL. IN A FEW WEEKS, U.S. SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN WILL BE REINSTATED, LIKELY SQUEEZING THE ROGUE NATION ECONOMICALLY AND ESSENTIALLY IRAN WILL NOW HAVE LESS MONEY TO FUND, LET'S SEE, THEIR PROXY WARS IN SYRIA, IRAQ, YEMEN. THEY ARE FUNDING OF TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD, WEAPON SYSTEM AIMED AT ISRAEL AND OTHER ALLIES. OF COURSE THE CORRUPT ISLAMIC NEXT POLITICAL LEADERS IN IRAN AND THE MULLAHS, THEY ARE NOT TAKING THE SOIL. PETULANT IRANIAN LAWMAKERS YELLING ONCE AGAIN DEATH TO AMERICA FROM THE PARLIAMENT FLOOR. EVEN BURNING AN AMERICAN FLAG. AS YOU CAN SEE, IN OTHER WORDS, A PRETTY NORMAL TUESDAY FROM THE PARLIAMENT IN TEHRAN. MEANWHILE, IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER WENT ON A TOTALLY UNHINGED TWITTER WRAPPED SAYING THE U.S. PRESIDENT SHALLOW, LUDICROUS BEHAVIOR WASN'T UNEXPECTED. THE SAME BEHAVIOR EXISTED IN PREVIOUS U.S. PRESIDENTS YET IRANIAN NATION IS PERSISTING WHILE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENTS PASSED AWAY AND THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN IS STILL STANDING. THIS MAN CORPSE WILL ALSO BE WORM FOOD WHILE THE IS LONGBOAT REPUBLIC STAND STRONG. COMING FROM A MAN PRESIDENT OBAMA, THINK ABOUT THIS, TRUSTED AND HANDED OVER $150,000,000,000.02. A PROMISE HE GOT BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD NUKES BUT WE GOT HE GOT TO CONTINUE TO SPIN THOSE CENTRIFUGES. NATURALLY, THE MULLAHS OF IRAN ARE THREATENING TO RAMP UP THE URANIUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAM. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT BOWING DOWN TO THE EMPTY THREATS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF IRAN STARTS UP THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM? THEY WILL FIND OUT. I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD DO THAT. I WOULD ADVISE IRAN NOT TO START THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. I WOULD ADVISE THEM VERY STRONGLY. IF THEY DO, THERE WILL BE VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCE. Sean: SADLY, IRAN'S MORALLY CORRUPT POLITICAL LEADERS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES MELTING OUT OF THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION. YOUR VERY OWN MAINSTREAM MEDIA THEY ARE ALSO IN FREAK OUT MODE YET AGAIN. I GUESS THEY DIDN'T LEARN FROM THEIR NORTH KOREAN COVERAGE. TAKE A LOOK. DECISION BY THE PRESIDENT THAT SOME SAY MARKS THE UNITED STATES' BIGGEST SELF-INFLICTED FOREIGN POLICY WOUND SINCE THE IRAQ WAR. WHAT WE HEARD WAS NOT FOREIGN POLICY. IT WAS VANDALISM. DOESN'T THIS GIVE IRAN A PROPAGANDA WIN? OF COURSE. I GUESS THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT JOHN BOLTON IS FINALLY GETTING THE WAR HE HAS ALWAYS WANTED. REINFORCES THE NOTION THAT WE ARE SOMETHING OF A ROGUE COUNTRY, THAT WE DON'T UNDER OR HONOR OR LIVE UP TO OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS IS HE KEEPING A CAMPAIGN PROMISE CUSTOMER DOES HE KNOW WHAT HE PULLED OUT OF? THE TOTALITY OF THIS PRESIDENT'S BEHAVIOR AND DECISIONS LEADS ME TO QUESTION WHY HE DOES ANYTHING AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS TO DEFLECT FROM SOMETHING ELSE. I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE MORAL COMPASS TO MAKE A DECISION BASED
