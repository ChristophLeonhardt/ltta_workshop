00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,860
I WAS PRETTY FLABBERGASTED WHEN SHE SAID THAT IN THE INTERVIEW

20

WITH KATY TUR THIS AFTERNOON, AND I THINK KATEY WAS SURPRISED

AND I THINK KATEY WAS SURPRISED AT ALL.

00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,006
AT ALL. WE’VE NOT HEARD ANYBODY MAKE

THIS CHARGE THAT HE KNEW ABOUT WIKILEAKS.

26
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,277
WIKILEAKS. OF COURSE HE’S BEEN DENYING FOR

COLLUSION, HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA, THAT HE DIDN’T KNOW

31
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,219
WITH RUSSIA, THAT HE DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF.

32
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,089
ABOUT THIS STUFF. I DON’T KNOW WHERE OMAROSA

I DON’T KNOW WHERE OMAROSA MANIGAULT-NEWMAN CAME UP WITH

34
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:06,823
MANIGAULT-NEWMAN CAME UP WITH THAT.

35
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,059
THAT. I DON’T KNOW IF SHE WAS SORT OF

00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,827
I DON’T KNOW IF SHE WAS SORT OF SAYING IT IN THE MOMENT IN AN

EVIDENCE TO BACK UP HER CLAIM. BUT IF SHE’S CORRECT IT COULD BE

45
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,546
BUT IF SHE’S CORRECT IT COULD BE A LEGAL PROBLEM FOR THE

46
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:28,913
A LEGAL PROBLEM FOR THE PRESIDENT.

47
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,549

AND CAN PROVE ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF THE E-MAILS COMING OUT IT

50
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,422
OF THE E-MAILS COMING OUT IT SEEMS TO ME AT MINIMUM COLLUSION

51
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,224
SEEMS TO ME AT MINIMUM COLLUSION AND AT MOST BALL GAME, CORRECT?

52
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,859
AND AT MOST BALL GAME, CORRECT? >> WELL, IT SEEMS SO.

53
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,427
>> WELL, IT SEEMS SO. THE FACT IS SHE’S ALREADY BEEN

54
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,562
THE FACT IS SHE’S ALREADY BEEN BEFORE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL.

55
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,497
BEFORE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT SHE’S GOING

56
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,867
IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT SHE’S GOING TO GET CALLED BACK I WOULD THINK

57
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,035
TO GET CALLED BACK I WOULD THINK AND PROVIDE WHATEVER ELSE SHE

58
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:51,268
AND PROVIDE WHATEVER ELSE SHE HAS.

59
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,604
HAS. AND SO I THINK YOU’RE RIGHT.

60
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,973
AND SO I THINK YOU’RE RIGHT. I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THESE

61
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:57,408
I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THESE NOTIONS, I MEAN WHEN I HEARD

62
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,276
NOTIONS, I MEAN WHEN I HEARD THAT TODAY MY MOUTH JUST WAS

63
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:02,046
THAT TODAY MY MOUTH JUST WAS OPEN BECAUSE THAT IS THE WHOLE

64
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,281
OPEN BECAUSE THAT IS THE WHOLE BALL GAME RIGHT THERE.

65
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,982
BALL GAME RIGHT THERE. AND SO NOW SHE’S IN A POSITION

66
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:06,817
AND SO NOW SHE’S IN A POSITION WHERE SHE REALLY DOES HAVE TO

67
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,287
WHERE SHE REALLY DOES HAVE TO PUT UP.

68
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,089
PUT UP. >> JONATHAN LEMIRE, THERE’S A

>> JONATHAN LEMIRE, THERE’S A THEORY THAT STARTED FLOATING

70
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:15,559
THEORY THAT STARTED FLOATING AROUND YESTERDAY, TODAY.

71
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,563
AROUND YESTERDAY, TODAY. IT WAS THE THING TO SAY THAT

72
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,164
IT WAS THE THING TO SAY THAT MAYBE MANAFORT COULD BRING DOWN

73
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,699
MAYBE MANAFORT COULD BRING DOWN THE HOUSE.

74
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,102
THE HOUSE. MAYBE IT WOULD BE GATES OR

MAYBE IT WOULD BE GATES OR FLYNN, MAYBE IT WOULD BE MICHAEL

76
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:26,871
FLYNN, MAYBE IT WOULD BE MICHAEL COHEN OF NEW YORK.

77
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,607
COHEN OF NEW YORK. BUT IN THE LAST 24 TO 48 HOURS

78
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,142
BUT IN THE LAST 24 TO 48 HOURS I’VE HEARD SERIOUS PEOPLE SAY

I’VE HEARD SERIOUS PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE WOMAN WHO COULD BURN

80
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,711

PERHAPS UNIQUELY DANGEROUS TO THIS WEST WING THAT OMAROSA

AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS SHE
